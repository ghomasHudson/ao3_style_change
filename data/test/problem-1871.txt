Well that’s pretty close to what she said anyway. Put the whole place into silence. Draco handed her his wand and Zebb proceeded to cast a spell at the dress that altered it to perfection. It was fantastic! Lesson learned. And the dress is wonderful. Stately and classic.
Just a minute, let me check something.
I have a no contact list? Take him off then! I’ll be more than happy to attend Lucy’s birthday party. Are his parent’s still dead?
“A little dry.”
“So you just brought people to Overview to torture them with potion detentions and writing reams of essays?”
32 each:
I’ll try it. But now he has two freaking wands! The one he made from a stick and your bluebell. And I know you’re teaching him because he’s gotten in the habit of floating dirty dishes to the kitchen sink. I wasn’t even finished with my coffee and my Harpies mug took off across the room.
——————————————————————————
Harry and Draco visit the Snape portrait.
“POTTER.”
“Ha!”
. . . . . . . . . .
When I said he remembers everything I wasn’t kidding. EVERYTHING. He’s like Auntie Luna’s recording machine. Tell them the one about the plant!
So it’s a no on the Norway lobster.
The pink ones? I’d love one.
“If I have anything to say about it, YES.”
You’re going to owe me.
Help!
“Nope, Scorp and Aspen are watching from upstairs. Give a wave to the blonde on the balcony!”
Mine is too, but this is different. Fascinating.
“The top floor is the private family quarters. That floor will be off limits to everyone but Mr. Trandy, Grayson and myself unless you're invited . . . . Above that is the roof garden and observatory, you’re welcome to enjoy that. Especially in the summer . . . This is a muggle neighborhood. The fidelius that keeps the house hidden will be removed sometime in the near future so I expect all of you to practice your disillusionment charms for when you’re on the roof or outside. This of course does not apply to Grayson.”
“I absolutely understand that. It’s going to take time, Dud.”
Sure! Do that! Why do you need the Aurors?
Please send healer. Mind blown.
“No.”
Not yet no.
Potter Cottage(Fidelius)
“Good. That brings me to the point I was trying to make. Like Groy, Harry most definitely dislikes being addressed by titles. Particularly the terms “Master” or “Sir”. . . .”Mr. Potter” is acceptable in a formal setting but get used to just calling him “Harry”. This is a house rule and you should all let us know how you personally prefer to be addressed. Mr. and Mrs Brick prefer the titles and we respect that too.”
They would kill us.
“Nice to meet you. And it’s actually Harry Malfoy-Potter.”
“Translation sticks. Free with purchase and for use in the store if they want them. We don’t want to have to repackage everything. Try it out.”
“Not yet. . . . . Research first.”
“I don’t want them to stay here for another minute.”
“I love that. What is it?”
“The trousers. It’s going to drive me crazy all day.”
“Well, so far according to this there’s a dining hall on the top level. . . . Three kitchens one smaller one down here. . . . Probably that large opening on the left. . . . As you can see there’s a more intimate dining area over there. A private master suite up those stairs on the far right of the fireplace. The center staircase leads up to the guest rooms and 3 “lounges” and continue up to the dining hall and balconies. I guess we’ll just have to wander around.
“How about a compromise? I’ll just shrink them and you can think about it later? Either way you’re not going to want to leave these sitting out.”
Of course the whole reason Poppy tested you for bearer magic is because your father birthed you. As did his father Fleamont birth James. As did his father Henry birth Fleamont.
“Oh no you don’t mister.”
I guess I need to bring us back to order! What’s left Hugo?
“Yeah. Is that okay?”
“It’s certainly no Borgin and Burkes anymore is it?”
“Jon made it?”
You wish.
“Reflection?”
“Showed up on my doorstep unannounced and strong armed me.”
“Oh no.”
“Very well, and you?”
“How?!”
It looks pretty. I like the windmills?
“How do you know?”
Hermione.
"It’s just a streak! We’re celebrating!"
“See what?”
Kensington
“You won’t recognize it. They’re moving on to the entertainment level tomorrow. Zebb brought them up there and gave them a lecture about not touching the walls of the dining and ballroom other than Cookey dusting. He’s in heaven by the way. They’re going to do a full sterilization and cleaning of the kitchens up there. Will not touch the potions lab. I locked it.”
“What are these?”
. . . . . . . . . .
Uncle Harry, you have collected over 200,000 songs. It would take probably more than three years just to listen to them all once.
Zebb has been the glue for my family and is especially close to Al, and now I just feel like a complete jerk. Why are we like this?
“You’re just joking with me.”
“FUCKING BITCH!”
——————————————————————————
“I’m back. They said 15 minutes. Delivery. I’ll meet them outside in front of #10.
“You guys will need lunch too. Don’t forget to eat.”
It’s lovely where it is Harry. Thank you! I might change the upholstery to a sunflower yellow.
. . . . . . . . . .
I know it sounds odd. But my testing says it works. Not addictive, and would be as calming without the excessive drowsiness.
"A couple of them were borderline, but I'll let it pass because my Husband is gorgeous.
Outfit. One outfit.
Yes I know this. However, they came to my offices this afternoon.
I think it’s a wonderful gesture. I don’t know how he really plans to keep it a secret though.
“Right here! This is awesome.”
Of course I can get you in. I’ll make the arrangements.
“Okay so then you’ve got a private back yard. And we could use the park?”
Yes. It will be fine! Don’t freak out!
You’re right. Do you have any idea how big it is?
It’s Okay. Jamie said it was urgent.
This will not end well.
Rose and Hugo then join Ted and Jamie on the platform as Louis Delacour-Weasley presents the rings to Albus and Scorpius.
“No.”
Harry Potter
“I don’t. I want to learn all the magic. I can’t do that if I don’t go.”
38 Seats. WTF HARRY!
I’m really not sure how any of this works? I just make brooms, and I’ve been doing just fine! The broom shop is running at a decent profit!
See our PHOTO on Page 3 and Post your thoughts in the comments!
YOU SNEAK!! YOU GORGEOUS FUCKER!!”
Jaydne Jr. and Rose!
So . . . they were going to relocate after the wedding anyway. Back to London for Scorpius job at St. Mungos.
Gareth and Danika have been hanging out with me at the annex. Auntie Luna and Uncle Nev went to Peru while school is out. It’s a little cold but we’ve got the boards out. Gareth is a natural surfer?
“There’s a whole new wing down here.”
“OH this part is good. . . . .”
“Gross. We don’t need those.”
Okay!
“Here comes Draco’s assistant?”
“Hello?”
“I can’t retract them. They’ve obviously already been published!”
Agreed.
You’ll have Trandy make lunch while you supervise?
See you in a few.
“I’ve got to meet with Mother this afternoon. Are you sure about the Black vault?””
Okay I’ll ask him if he’s up for it. Not right now though he’s working over on the house with Uncle Harry and Draco today. I’ll see if he can take a break this afternoon?
NO. I put them back. I’m just
Showers and Tubs:
“Bathroom! Wow look at this Draco. . . . It’s huge. . . . What do you call this?”
Do Not Tell!
When I designated the Lodge as a retreat the term could not have been more fitting for your Father and I. This lodge was a refuge and at times a shelter from the suffocation of wizard society. As you know your Father and I were never much for Wizarding functions.
Merlin.
“Yeah. Not just a dream, darling. All real. All still here. . . . . . not going away.”
Something? Aldi market? You could be anywhere there’s thousands of those!
Yes. Today. I’m going to head over there when we’re done here. Cemetery first. Then find a real estate agent!
Tying up loose ends concerning the Grimmauld opening and Potter Manor family meeting.
“Yeah. Okay help me out here let’s make this room presentable and clean up that bathroom a bit. It was actually pretty put together before I came here so let’s try to make it look like that.”
Well, all I can say is that I agree, but I have to talk with Harry first?
“I see. . . . . . . . . . . . thanks.”
“Because I’ve been working on this case for two years and I’m nervous. You two have no idea how difficult it’s been. I’ve had to fight every day for these boys. They’re special. Jonathan really does love things like the idea of a ladybug bedroom. Some people don’t get it. You do. . . .David makes wands out of random sticks and because of accidental magic sometimes they work. I can’t explain that part.”
YES. We just need to assemble.
BLAME LOUIS. The display was his idea.
“Oh.”
“Let’s at least talk with her about it. I don’t think it’s that we couldn’t do it. It’s just not what we had planned for.”
Edit: the usual
Give me five minutes and I’ll send you the changes. I’ve got the original file. Okay?
“I guess. His name is Grayson.”
“That’s a cauldron?”
“Okay. I’m thinking to not tell them too much so it can be a cool surprise anyway. But I want to get help with the pub quiz and ask Danika if he’ll team up with Phil for spinning. We’ll have to transport his DJ gear. Maybe the Iceland part and to pack for that and also swimming gear? Teddy’s going to offer a “gallery walk” too.”
I bring that out every year. Do you remember that?”
“Elf choir?!. . . . . .shirt. . . .hand it over.”
But Narcissa, again, you take the reins and lead them through it. I don’t think any of us could do it with a straight face.
Master Bedroom:
SIGH. No I didn’t know and that’s a relief.

I’m going to share my bottle of chardonnay with Gareth and Louis then call it a night, or google that 3-D thing and stay up all night.
12 Grimmauld Place
“Oh dear. Okay, well first of all it’s unusual in the fact that it’s white tile. Usually it would be dark or stone. It needs cleaning. That niche over the third table that’s rounded and arched is an area where you work on noxious potions the fumes are exhausted through there. On this short wall is a small library.”
“Okay. If I told you I was in love with you and said thanks for rescuing me from the clutches of Mungo’s?”
Okay. It’s in Scotland. It’s “fake old”. Looks like a castle on the hill from the outside. It’s a muggle building built in the early 1900’s. It’s very pretty from the outside but in major disrepair. Even with Magic it’s a real nightmare. Back in the 1970’s the owners turned it into a kind of hotel, did this really distasteful remodel on it. Green carpet glued to the hardwood floors on every surface. A lot of fake gold paint. When we bought the place it was full of potted ferns. I mean ferns everywhere on every flat surface!
“I can see that. They’re the same about him. Protective.”
“Don’t say that.”
Harry and Draco took the optional Monday off and are flying to Wales. I’ve got Harry’s schedule back up to date. Stocked the kitchen. Fed the fish for him.
“What the fuck is this. Scarhead?”
Iceland= Elf law: Does NOT allow: wages, housing allowances or BBCR1!
You two are UNBELIEVABLE!. I knew we should have sent you out with a chaperone.
“Okay you can have this back now. I know you’re keeping it for me. Don’t tell Zebb.”
“Delaunay. Gallery?”
Sure, of course.
“Day before yesterday. It was an accident. Wand started rolling off the counter and I just instinctively started to run to grab it and of course I’m moving too slow. . . Accio’d it across the kitchen!"
“You will always be our first choice. But we’ll never take advantage of it. You need to know we have alternatives.”
Louis! What on earth would make you think that I would prank you????
“I’m Gloria and this is Cel.”
How about the purple shorts I like you in?
“What colour is it?”
Seven fucking pages of photos.
Many know that in the past, Hogwarts has had requirements and restrictions concerning uniforms and wardrobe. I would like to stress that these restrictions were eliminated, but I’d also like to give a short lesson on traditions.
Draco nerds out.
——————————————————————————
“Dad’s going to live there? I’ll bet it’s too big. He’s not going to want to do it.”
“But. . ”
Well, here on the main floor as you see it’s just a big open space. There’s an entry, living space, kitchen and dining space. It’s a commercial building so it’s a lot of windows and being on the top floor we have the ceiling like this. It’s almost similar to a greenhouse, but this glass is all charmed to protect the artwork. I’m quite proud of the charm. I worked on it with Hermione.
We’ll come up with a solution.
“I gave it back!”
Wow. Cool!
“And you need to know that Mum would kill you and Draco if you hog the baby.”
“Watch your head.”
19:00 be there or be an idiot.
“I apologize. There really was no warning. I’ve had no luck trying to reach you since Friday. Five owls were returned to the office and we were out Saturday afternoon and yesterday. It has to be written correspondence and not just a phone call.”
Is this a problem? I really thought you knew about this. We’re having her house painted and a new roof and everything. She’s quite excited about a new baby.
“I do hope that Severus Snape is enjoying the parade and family event.”
“Don’t know. I’d say probably not.”
Where’s the fun in that? Harry Potter just shows up unannounced!
“You haven't made it yet this year. It may as well be a love potion. Makes me all warm and fuzzy, the boys will love it and I miss it.”
The meeting included Dean and Seamus Finnegan-Thomas and Ron Granger-Weasley Who was later joined by his Wife the Minister.
14.8 Langley Lane (Fidelius)
“I PROMISE. I’d wand out promise if I could find it.”
“There you go. I’ve got the blanket. Quick, Draco, shrink it!”
“Why is there only one green couch in here?”
“Now what! She’s still drooling.”
“Those are some pretty vintage posters.”
Please tell me what the Dads are planning?
“Ask away.”
“You can do that? How?”
Over the years, the Wizarding media and public have been spent countless hours speculating on the personal lives of these families. Unfortunately most if not all of the coverage has been (if I can say politely) inaccurate, contrived out of spite or wholly fabricated on speculation.
I’m brewing jauntyalica root. It’s a very delicate process.
What did you expect? You cannot fault your Grandmothers for running with the wedding that you gave to them carte blanche. I’ve heard that Draco has reigned them in a bit, but you’ve dug your own grave on this one :)! Oh. I’ve decided on the venue for the luncheon. I think it’s going to be fun. Do you have your outfits picked out yet?
Among the items on display will be Harry’s wand. Perhaps his beloved broom and school robes accompanied by some additional personal items. Including some very beautiful Muggle automobiles, the exhibition will change seasonally. Those who’ve always wondered about the fabled Yule Ball robes my Brother Ron wore? You might actually get to see them for a holiday display sometime (if my Brother will loan it). I’ve seen them, it’s worth it! So ugly! Harry might show his beloved train collection and selected never before seen family photo’s. The point is to make it fun. And Harry has plenty of odd and interesting things to keep people entertained for a very long time.
“Of course I can.”
“I’m sure.”
“Cancelling all of your appointments for the rest of the day. Asking Sean to do it.”
Oh no. We need an actual copy of this one!
“Jess Glynne.”
But hey, we’re getting ready for another round of tests for the new products at the WWW, are you up for it?
Correct answer = 2 points
“Hey Draco! Did our husbands blow anything up yet?!”
Unbelievable!
——————————————————————————
Rose you should invite Franklin.
We may have negotiated an appropriate price for the paintings he did for Decram with his artists representative. He’s been giving us an advantage that wasn’t necessary and we’ve corrected the error.

And yes they know about my magic and Harry doesn’t care. Harry Potter is not like what you would expect. At all. He’s really nice, and funny too. He even made me this card and told me to send it to you with one of his. Said for you to call him if you have any questions or worries. Helped me with a fireplace spell and un-shrunk my stuff. Wandless.
I told you! They’ve been holding out on us. Nicest fucking restaurant in Diagon. Probably one of the nicest places in London.
Well, I’m in my office too. Now you’ve promised that we’d SHAG like bunnies all night. My head is spinning and I can no longer concentrate. All I can think about is how pink your cheeks are right now.
Got it. But if they were forgotten by time there’s no real question to answer?
We’ll all be old and grey. . . .and REALLY hungry by then. . . . You don’t want people to die of hunger do you? It wouldn’t be nice making your friends wait that long!”
“What does the paper from Jay say?”
“Eat!
I don’t believe my Grandmother can have her mind changed once she has it set on a goal. So my only option is to say no.
But they say I don’t have to. I can refuse all of the seats if I want.
Please be gentle with Hugo when you explain this. He’s a nose to books kind of kid and he’ll take this very seriously.
“Alright, I’ll let you know how it goes.”
“I more than like it. And bookshelves.”
Bye Jay!
Bill? WHY???
“HA!”
Midweek update.
Just let me know.
“I know.”
We can’t have Wizard manufacturing there though?
Winnifred the owl return post!
“Merlin.”
LOL perhaps Wednesday then? and yes, I’m going to get Seamus to explain hurling.
“Well they still make the sparkly fairy noises, but no big explosions. We’re going to introduce a line like this at the shop. I’ve finally convinced George to give them a try.”
I’m ready. The kids are ready. Hugo is DEFINITELY ready.
“It’s like a butterfly that turns into a moth or something. . . . that’s the part everyone really likes. . . . not the moth, but the pretty butterfly . . .wait that’s wrong. . . .UGH!”
“This is a mystery that must be solved!”
Ugh. Okay. Dud get’s a pass. And his daughter Lucy is very sweet. I would love to attend her birthday.
Me, your Mum, Jerry, Molly, My Mother, Andi, Arthur, Hugo, Grayson, Rose, Lily, Eric, Ted, Jamie, Jon, Davey, Louis, Gareth, Danika, Hermione, Ron, Fleur, Bill, Trandy, Decram. Victoire and the other one just arrived.
“No, I don’t think so. Hopefully after today you will be the one “BEGONE”!
Ron and Hermione Granger-Weasley
Speaking of Liogel. Should we ask about Rosie?
We also may need you to come up here and help set up the TV. It’s being problematic?
He wouldn’t kill you.
“Alright, a tiny bit of oil in the wok and wait after you’ve turn up the heat. Pour a glass of that.”

“What?”
“It meant a lot to me too. It’s a special piece of magic.”
That’s just not possible.
“But they’re good biscuits. Everyone says they like them. . . . even the vanilla.”
REALLY?
“May I ask for an indulgence?”
Yes, that needs to change. So, our place. 15:00. If you want alcohol you’ve got to bring it. And I want Jamie’s salad without the sardine shite.
What about the Lovegood-Longbottom boys?
“OH. . . . .”
Something new then. Good?
“Sounds awful.”
“My son is not wrong!”
Library, Art Gallery and
and now it’s in the papers. . . .
They VOLUNTEERED to do it. It’s going to be fun. Like little clubs all over the house!
Hello? Did you guys mean to ask us in here? Danika is coming too.
“What?”
It really is going to be superb. They’re going to put in that big window in so you can see the trout pond.
“Trust me. The place is clean, and Jamie made that ladybug bed plenty big enough for those two.”
“He was. Months ago. Turn around, Al.”
“My trains?”
Who did we forget?
“That is all. And Mr. Delacour-Weasley has been through.”
Grayson needs to send the owls out.
(See the end of the chapter for
How did you figure this all out?
“Draco . . . you know . . .he’s letting people outside of our tight bubble see him a little more, and letting his hair down. . . . who knows, he might even bring out his ukulele.”
You already have the Shiro on your list.
“The CARS!”
“Really no petrol?”
"And it doesn't damage the paintings doing that?"
“I don’t know if there’s a limit? We’ll ask Dec when he comes back. Try the bell?”
Welcome to my new fancy chatroom courtesy of the goblins! Is it possible to get Lily in here? She’s already approved and you can invite her.
“Better. I swear.”
You can’t do it all, Scarhead. Baking the cake is enough this time.
“Any colour we like, yes sir.”
“No.”
Even the cranky old Gamp!
“So the image in the painting is more of a spirit or wraith. It’s written in the documents at the Manor. There’s an entire page describing what he called the ceremony and procedure used to transfer him into the painting at the time of death.”
12 Grimmauld Place
You have no idea how relieved I am. I didn’t even know I was that stressed out over this part.
“I’m not up for auction here Jamie!”
“Alright. So here’s your list for staff. Pen?”
“Sure. Like what?”
Works like a curtain from the stage. Pulls down from the top. Pretty cool!
“What?!”
The day begins with the arrival of Harry and Draco Malfoy-Potter in a classic Muggle automobile, a lazy pedal boat ride, picnic in the shade, champagne and a walk in the rose garden. After a leisure end to the day at a hidden waterfall in the park we have:
“No, because I’m still blonde, Weasel. Your horrifying skills at chess have not turned me grey. . . . .yet.”
“Excellent choice. I suggest ordering the hotel’s candle service. . . and don’t be shy they do it every day. . . .Tomorrow you’ll want breakfast in your room. The room service is incredible. I’m not making you travel back to London with all of this I’ll have it delivered to Draco’s. Meet me here tomorrow and I’ll take you to lunch before you head out.”
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
They’re copies of HIS memories, not anyone else. At first he just wanted to save them and give history the truth someday. Put away for safekeeping when he was in therapy with Andi when he was younger. As time went on he just kept adding things that meant something to him. Weddings and things like births and your first day of school, that sort of thing. Holidays and the like. He say’s it’s all for you to have someday.
I refuse to let Draco have to deal with all this stuff on his own. I’m taking him away from his apothecaries! This is SO NOT COOL!
. . . . . . . . .
_______________________________________
Today I’m interviewing Draco. We chose his London residence for our chat.
Yes. Please?
“No, I’m good. Zebb and Poppy have everything under control as far as the feeding schedule and changing. Poppy’s staying for a couple more days. . . .I’ve got all the help I need. We’re so fucking lucky Jamie.”
You forgot about the sex part.”
“Yes. Best day of my life . . . . That’s Ginny’s. It was a kiss on the cheek but there was no looking back after that. You can’t make them up. That’s what I want to show. . . . .Al and Jamie gave these. . . .”
Most sincerely,
“Oh Merlin, thank you Hugo.”
I will consult with the team. It can be done with your permission.
“You say this is plaster?”
Tomorrow. He’s sending over the pictures and stuff! How much do you know about Muggle cars?
“Oh Fuck!”
“Do you think it would work?”
Okay. We should make sure to ask Hanna to the park on Sunday for the lemonade stand.
I can/will give Kreacher the permission. That’s an easy one!
“Shepherds Bush. There’s a great little place. Let me look. . . . .I think I’ve got a card in here . . . . it’s not fancy.”
“Does this look familiar?”
I am actually. That chicken salad. The one with the rice noodles, cucumber and sesame-miso. Are you up for that?
Doesn’t hurt to ask. What about access though? We’re not going to want the public showing up on our doorstep. And you know they will once they figure it out.
GUESS WHO DID HER FIRST BELLY CRAWL?
The Family reacts to the pics.
I can put it off until end of day next Tuesday. That’s the last filing deadline.
“Albus why don’t you have a seat on that bench.”
Where are you?
“I think she’s working on her puff pastries.”
“Yes, If everyone would please move to the sides for a moment I have something special to inaugurate the conservatory. . . . . .
Draco and I have been up to see it and had the Goblins take it out of stasis. It’s really something else. Huge main room with sandstone fireplaces. It has these massive windows overlooking a lake. It was originally meant as a place to entertain and retreat. This is where Euphemia Potters Muggle art collection is housed.
When our intrepid team was tipped off to a huge event concerning the Potter-Malfoy families at the exclusive Clove Club, we of course RUSHED TO THE SCENE!
Love that.
“I’ll tell you a secret. Draco’s just as bad as me.”
“My lips are sealed. Oh this is very exciting! When are you going to do it?”
Anything else?
“And to make matters worse there is a perfectly serviceable powder room just to the back of the stairs on the main floor.”
Gringotts Secure Post (Personal Goblin Delivery):
“Yes.”
“We just had a conversation about life changing situations. A big move, an engagement. Another wedding someday.”
“Same for me. Dud?”
“Yes!”
Draco Malfoy-Potter

I’m going back over tomorrow to get his computer configured. Show him how to work the TV and stuff. If you PROMISE to be nice I might invite him into a chat tomorrow night. But you have to PROMISE to be good.
“You do?”
Time to open the park.
And If I do this Potter, what do I get in return?
“Yeah.”
Like when he gets excited about a project and it’s contagious.
“Your Mum and Dad are incredible people. You listen to them. . . . .
“Very good. Plan to arrive in one hour.”
How do I access it?
“I just met him like three days ago! He’s really nice and sweet and funny and smart and handsome. He’s got pretty eyes and cute hair and I want to kiss him. Does that make it clearer? I’m kinda freaking out!”
Meeting with Cibly in Conservatory
We thought maybe we’d hang out on the roof. To be fair, it’s the perfect place to view it from. But we haven’t done anything up there. It's kind of scary.
Harry, I’m the Fucking Minister of Magic. I know everything. And I mean
That is so.
Grandmother????
OH YES. We need this.
“No. Now was the right time for it. Just like us. The time wasn’t right before, now it is.”
Nope we’re all good! I’ll let you go then. Hurry home. LY
“The laceleafs are beautiful around the walkway. And I love the colourful annuals all around.”
“Not yet. . . . .Well anyway, the fish are fine. We talked to them about the lily pads.”

“Teddy, I’m sorry. I just. . . . . I just couldn’t. Can you forgive me?”
“That’s maybe a little harsh.”
You’re never going to want to leave. I love that railing.
“GAA!”
“We’ll have to let them use the place now whenever they’d like.”
_____________
Family Dinner to celebrate the return of our Canadian and Peruvian Travelers!
“Yes.”
“They’re not written in any book but I think they’re some of my best. You’ll be the judge.”
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
Perfectly lined up across the top of the building overlooking the boutique. It’s quite a sight. They look like a line of owl aurors at attention up there.
What about those empty townhouses?
Shite!
Really. What’s the big fuss over the fucking shoes?
Smart Move. Zebb laid it out for you then.
“Constantin Brancusi.”
Gran looks like she’s about to splinch herself. You’d better let them over soon. Cissa too!
These are COOL!
“That composition was extraordinary. Did someone record it? Fucking awesome.”
What is it?
SUPER HEAVY SIGH!
It’s getting chilly. They brought blankets for everyone. Tartan lambswool and down pillows from Scotland.”
“You showered yet?”
“She should. It was a gift and not Miss Irma’s favorite, but quite nice. This set was the favorite it’s much older though.”
Yes Gareth. All of us.
“Hugo. . . . let’s just Rickroll Draco!”
“We would have to do what you just did to Rose and Hugo’s place another 130 times!”
Ugh. Dad, you should have said something. It can wait!
Ginny is my oldest friend. We grew up together. I am biased. Sue me. She also hates being called “Ginevra” so that headline is all mine.
“Draco, teach her your special fix it spell!”
Okay.
Explain, Heraald.
You’re picking up the boys today?
“Why?”
Promise!
“Yes!”
“I’m completely sure. That car has so much protection it nearly drives itself.”
Love you, bye!
“Yes.”
Put on your Harry hat, scarhead.
“No, we haven’t decided. That’s still months away.”
I’m pleased to know this. Shall I also assume then that the third ritual is off the table?
“How are you holding up?”
Yes. I’ll work that part out. Don’t forget that we’re both honorary union members, and we’re asking for volunteers to staff the event. It’s not a demand. This isn’t an inconvenience for them.
“It’s fantastic.”
He’s a very nice young man. Don’t judge.
Oh, good!
“I was brought to this house as a child. My Mother was most certainly in this house before Walburga turned it. I will tell you that it did not look anything like what we saw earlier at the order viewing, but it definitely did NOT look like this. Mother never said anything about it and I don’t quite understand.”
You’re going to move the day after?
No it will be fine. We’ll work it out. Gringotts message them.
“Careful with the hair, Potter.”
“I know that one. But I didn’t care that you got into trouble because I loved it so much.”
“Go ahead and look around if you want.”

“Can Al sit down? His feet are going to swell up.”
That would be good. We can all leave together. There’s quite a crowd here.

Not a HUGE fan of scallops, but it still sounds pretty yummy!

Me too. So, I’ll double check with Uncle Harry about the code. I need to ask him something anyway.
Could think about it. Maybe that wacky taxi cab or something. I will say, people are coming out of the photo exhibit with their jaws dropped.
Yes! We had a watercolour painting date at the manor. It was SO AWESOME!

Dad and I have a lemonade stand today in the Grimmauld Park. Have you been here before?

Have a great week!
“Yes. I was just probably about your age when I went on it. Maybe a little older.”
LOL Hugo. You’re tone deaf.
In regards to the recent article titled: “THE POTTER-MALFOY NUPTIALS: WHAT ARE THEY HIDING!?” I would like to clarify some of the finer details!
“What?”
Is everyone in here now?
“You have a choice of wine, champaign or the orange drink.”
Not tomorrow either! We’ve got Goblin Hurling!
It’s not for us to tell.
Of course! What do you need?
Those are the most huggable jumpers ever made. So we’re running out of prospects on the Dad quest?
“So, overall the tone should reflect those robes and I’d also like to display them as is. They’re very effective and tell a story. I believe we should go darker with it. We will show your childhood potions lab, your final lab and the reconstructed Hogwarts office and quarters. The Spinner’s End property seems out of place other than your bedroom and lab.”
Well, if you put it that way, yes. There are a lot of conversations and ideas thrown around. It can be a little intense.
“Mr. Liogell, I’m pretty sure I won’t be able to do it.”
I knew I married you for a reason.
“You said it was pretty bad.”
She’s not wrong.
Okay we’ll do that. So what are you doing now? What are the developments on La Patrona? Is Gabriela okay?
“Was it?”
Maybe they’ll blame it on space aliens?
Shall we move on then? I would like any herbal blend with a lemon slice and no sugar.
Then all the kids can go together and it will be cool! It’s got seats for nearly 30 people! Has Grayson seen it yet? How does it look? Never mind I’m coming out!
“Yes. My composition.”
Just look over the notes. I’ve replaced the peppermint with a combination of cochineal and ginger root.

Hey guys. Just a minute.
Okay it’s time for you to come clean DRAGON BOY! What do you know about Eric Wilson?
“You okay?”
Kidding. It’s a Wizarding village in Anafi. Cissa has very graciously offered us her villa.
That's all for this weekend.
“Not really, no.”
I’m not going to do that.
“I can do it! Hugo’s got my computer hooked up to the chat now. I've already got the invite from Mr. Liogell.”
Excellent!
“Breathe through it for a minute . . . . look, it’s just an empty old store. Bill’s been here earlier and did his job. He’ll give us his report later . . . .There’s nothing left from that past. Let’s clean it up and start fresh.”
“Uncle Harry?”
Yes. We’re going to Canada. Vancouver to Halifax.
Dad, will you do your patronus?
“You’ve decided on what plants you want?”
“What the fuck.”
“I understand.”
You would do that?
Harry and Draco: Teddy’s mural.
I don’t get it?
“Hugo or Grayson?”
Where are you?
“Two people living on this planet and doing our best?”
It’s been quite a while since we’ve dined at Lima. I’m looking forward to it and the gallery afterwards. We haven’t been to a Muggle photo exhibit in a long time.
To some extent, perhaps.
“Yes. Sure.”
“Ralph it is! Ready for a solo spin?”
“Try to stop thinking the worst for a minute and try to think of all the good you can get done. This couch is getting uncomfortable Shall we?”
When do I get to interview you? I’m serious!
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“No. I love it. My turn. THREE: . . . .Truth or Dare, Malfoy?”
“I didn’t say that was bad. I might just kiss him but his wife Agruella would not approve.”
Okay we’ll talk later. We’re getting the portraits out of Grimmauld today. I’ll be back at the lab in the morning tomorrow. Then out again in the afternoon.
“THERE’S MY BOYS!”
“Well that’s actually easy. You see my Father was Lucius Malfoy. He was as vile and vicious as yourself. It’s quite frankly a toss up between who was worse, but I actually think you won.
I’m pretty sure they would like to do that. It’s a walk from their place all the way on the other side around the block. I’ll bring it up with them. I’ll try to be discreet.
“Something is NOT RIGHT. Melody drove right over and said nothing is out of the ordinary, but your door buzzer downstairs is out of order and my key doesn’t work.”
“You’re not coming?”
And I’ll have you know that EVERYONE had a crush on X at some point. Draco even admitted that he thought he was cute back in 6th year or something. Shay is/was fucking cute and nice and funny as fuck and everyone loved him. Even Hermione! Please suppress that information too. ACTUALLY PLEASE JUST DESTROY THAT LIST.
We have Ginny Weasley-Linder with the actual fucking Minister Hermione Granger-Weasley and Rose Granger-Weasley on debris control. Running around on fucking brooms throwing spells and keeping the alley cleaned up from all the dust. Let them get a shot of that one!
“Sadly, not tonight.”
“Please have a seat. . . . . . . . . . ”
But maybe we could have a cocktail hour at the beginning or something? So no one feels left out?
Ugh. Yes.
“You boys want more coffee? I’m running to the kitchen.”
“They did?”
Okay.
Sure looks like they’re having a good time.
I do!
“I could probably do something like that in a couple days. I’d need to gather the ingredients. Maybe Scorp can help with that. I need to get dried cuttlefish! A lot of it. And have my guy construct some simple frames.”
“ANYBODY HAVE A SNITCH???”
Attached you will find the Non-Disclosure agreement concerning an event you have been invited to attend hosted by Mr. Harry J. Potter later next week.
“I hadn’t even thought about that. Merlin, this should be good!”
“I don’t think it’s necessary. Everyone knows how we feel about the two of you. It’s just family. Unless you want it, or it’s spontaneous. Just as long as the two of you are happy. You tell us if there’s anything you don’t care for or would like to add.”
“Yes.”
I’ll sit down with Zebb and come up with a list of positions. I hope that will be helpful. She will choose the manager for Grimmauld and will have final say.

On Sunday morning, the wedding party arrived and enjoyed a combination of breakfast, pastries and beverages in the Wiltshire Manor library while preparing for the day. The relaxed atmosphere calmed many a nerve as the participants walked through their individual roles in advance with Ms. Narcissa Black.
Harry explains the "Consequences".
“We could try, but I don’t have any ritual potions brewed.”
“Nothing. It’s just concern about the press making up “dark lord” accusations again. We avoid that.”
Ten minutes.
Grayson. That’s wonderful.
No, I’m not mad at all. I’m fucking proud as fuck that you called me out and refused to back down.
“Not exactly, but very close. And we’ll treat it with respect.”
We are both thrilled with these recent developments.
Rebeus Hagrid-Maxime,
I did kind of think that this is where the situation was headed. We will do what we can to keep it as quiet as possible.
I’ll ask. If not I still think we’re good.

Oh that’s right, I forgot that Zebb came from the Longbottoms. Uncle Nev’s Grandmother right?
Harry you really should come down here to see this.
I would think so, but really it’s only Lily to worry about. You can get the boys over there to do their rooms right away. There’s plenty of storage at the Centre for your things and Lily’s things can go in a vault.
One more later today.
“Oh merlin.”
“Do they have to be long letters?”
YES! but the location has to be kept confidential? Sorry. More secrets. And it’s warded. OH SO WARDED, hard to explain . . . Help me out here Draco, how do we do this part???
We’re still doing off the rack muggle oxford shirts, jeans and trainers. Those are already here.

It is at this time that the Fathers and guardians take seats together and are joined by their grandsons Jonathan and David Lupin-Potter. The young boys watch their fathers stand with Scorpius (Edward) and Albus (James) on a platform fashioned for the event (a Black family heirloom). Low to the ground, the platform shimmers like water and a reflection of stars throughout the ceremony. A nod to Andromeda, Narcissa, Draco and Scorpius’ heritage. The platform fills the atrium with a comforting light that extends to the ceiling glass for the duration of the ceremonies, darkening the afternoon sunlight and creating an intimate space of deep blue sky and starlight.
“What?”
Al! She’s just fine. We went down to the conservatory for a little while. The sun came out a bit. I gave her a tour of my study. We’re back upstairs now. I’m keeping her to the Poppy chart!
“Heck yeah.”
“I like that idea? Keep it more simple? Is that a cat?”
In what way.
What your Uncle said.

“If not could it be?”
How do you want to inform the others?
Of course. Yes.
“Hey kids.”
“Does that mean you’re going to move to the garden, Draco? That would be tragic for me because you’re my favourite sneaky snake. It would be very sad if you have to live in the sculpture garden or something! I want to keep you.”
Please tell me you didn’t take him up on one of your new brooms.
Okay. Tell Draco to come over with Mum and then we’ll all walk over to Fortescue’s? Tell him that their clothes are all too small and could use an adjustment. Dad promised Jon ice cream. You two should meet us there too.
Are you looking forward to becoming a Grandmother?
“You can actually close it off if you want, but let’s take a look.”
“I thought you would. I do too.”
You’ll figure out a way.
The swearing in of a new Chief is the job of the Minister of Magic. The
You have your mother’s green eyes because of the ritual performed between parents. That is quite common. It is possible that your granddaughter will be born with bright blue/silver “Scorpius/Draco” eyes.
“He would come home every time and sulk. Rant about that awful woman. And he’s old, I know but he really is a kind man.”
“I know isn’t it cool?”
That’s pretty exciting.
Unbeknownst to me at that time (and fortunate for us in retrospect), the staff at Gringotts put the property into what is called an “Architectural Stasis” which means that it has been preserved as untouched since the day I left it and has not been allowed to deteriorate further. Trust me when I say I cannot romanticize the place. The property was in major disrepair when I had it closed up. Maintaining the home under any circumstances other than a restoration or renovation would be untenable. There also may be pizza, muggle beer cans and empty headache potions on the kitchen table. Probably a curry or Chinese take-out in the cooling cabinet or in the drawing room and wet towels on the bathroom floor.
“Are you going to test it? I’ll let you.”
“Hey Harry?”
Something like that. I’ll just say they won’t write anything more than just a description unless it comes straight out of the mouth of myself or my family. Or if they’re invited. Hence the ward. If they can’t get close enough to ask they’ve got nothing.
“You’ve been taking cooking lessons from MR. CHENG!?”

The painting titled “A Man’s Head”. Is one of 23 stolen from the private collection of The Earl of Kingstrom. The collection, valued at the time at €48 million included the works of Bosch, Rubens, Vermeer, Parmigianino, El Greco, Goya, Monet and van Gogh among others. Most of the collection was recovered in a warehouse raid in 1992 and it was concluded that because of the collections fame the gangster found it impossible for the paintings to be sold even on the black market. There are now two paintings from the collection yet to be recovered. Vermeers “Lady With a Goblet” and Monet’s “Westminster Bridge at Daybreak”.

Good idea. Okay I’ll ask him about that too.
You’re more than welcome to use Westye for appliances but with reservations. The man basically invented Muggle “air conditioning” and “freezer refrigeration” during one of the Muggle wars. He’s the company founder and not a salesperson. The other thing you have to remember is that he’s technically “dead” in the muggle world. It’s kind of a wizards curse in the States since the life expectancy is so low. So he’s “dead” now as is his wife Mary. It’s better to work with one of the kids. I’ll set up a contact for you. They are truly the best.

Again, that’s all Jamie and Teddy. . . . They were ready. The boys were ready. We were all ready. And don’t discount the fact that they’ve got a support system that most people don’t.”

Instead of the original plan to floo to the Burrow we’ll still make them believe there’s going to be a dinner in the ballroom. I’ll have the call to dinner sent out and when they arrive to the ballroom they will be handed a portkey straight to the burrow lawns? That way it’s more of a surprise and they’re not all piling up in your living room fireplace and dragging soot through your home. Draco says he can stagger the landings and have it activated for all at the same time?

“Auntie Cissa’s Blazie!
“Robert. Where’d you get the hat?”
There are owl orders to be filled.
“Too much?”
“They’re going too fast.”
I know it’s important though. . . . put it in the gallery.”
“What now? Is this the something I should have known about?”
“How long?”
Well that would be nice. Yes.

Harry. Yes it works!
“Grayson are you ready?”
Well I wasn’t going to say, but they are quite nice of you both. I’m sure Harry appreciates them as well. You look quite fetching.
“And we have all the help we could ever ask for. And we will ask for it.”
. . . . . . . . . .
“And when have you ever done that?”
Dom and I can bring some fresh fruit juices, teas and espresso drinks?
LLL: Can you disclose a location for my readers?
Google it. . . Jamie, you’re tasked with making a guest list. Don’t leave anyone out. Talk with your Sister and your Cousins too. If anyone’s left out it will be awkward and unfortunate.
“AAAAAK!”
I also like the peach . . . . Actually I’ve changed my mind. The peach is my favorite now.
“I’ve got an addition I want you to see before we open it. It think you’ll like it, but if you don’t I’ll have it removed before we open things up.”
“DAD! NO!”
We also have to go over to the cottage and decide what we want to keep. I know Dad wants the family photos and his office, but he says everything else is fair game.
“You wouldn’t.”
You’re really lucky you’re so good with silencing charms. Just tell me you’re happy.
Yes working on remixes this weekend. We’ll build a fort over the desks.
“And that's part of the reason why. . . . I trust your opinion. . . . . you can look at things and give a different perspective. I know you have no personal agenda other than doing the right thing. I need that more than anything.”

Tomorrow I’m going out with Hugo freaking Granger-Weasley to get job stuff. Can you believe that?
“Decram! You didn’t know this?”
___________dragon___________
The morning started quietly enough as Draco removed the last traces of the original signage and did away with the boards covering windows, exposing the abandoned interior to the street.
We’ll have to finish this conversation at home. I’ve got to shower and pick up the boys. They’re staying for dinner. I’m taking them home at bedtime so Jamie can take Teddy out for dinner. What should I make?
“He wanted you to have the first one.”
My motive has nothing to do with anything other than the massive galleons this investment will bring! Don’t think otherwise! Go with Draco and find a space. It should be large enough for broom production and shipping.
“I love you Zebb!”
“It’s all pretty great actually. I’ll tell you that. . . . . But give it a day? You and I both need a break.”
“I’m joking about that last part. But it’s all protected. Nobody will ever get near them.”
“Hi Kreacher!”
“Have you seen Cissa yet?”
“What was the apple for?”
“PANSY’S HERE!”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Merlin. And what about your foot?”
Explain?
Dad, what happened? It’s fucking enormous!
“Merlin has a beard!”
I knew it. Here we go!!
Give him a chance to get used to things. Let’s not overwhelm him. I’m serious here. He’s really NICE and this is all new to him. New job. New living space. He was renting a room at the Leaky! And Uncle Harry. And I promised Uncle Harry that we wouldn’t “ruin him”.
“Jerry’s inside doing some kind of ritual. He hasn't blown anything up.”
We’re still working on the exterior and it’s going to be nice and fresh. I was a little concerned about the colors at first. Once I figured out that it’s just sun damage it was good.
Just #4, and that’s okay now, nothing dangerous. Uncle Nev reorganized it and put everything on an auto-timer for watering and temperature controls. I just need to do a walk through twice a week to make sure everything is okay.
You just want to buy a Muggle popcorn making machine!

Mr. Zabini, (the Knockturn Alley property manager) showed several properties, The chosen building is the former shop known as “The Broom Cupboard”.

I have several you can choose from.

“I don’t know either.”
Narcissa too.
We’re always here for you Jamie. It’s your decision. Okay, I’m being serious now. Let’s come up with a plan.
Well I guess we have the “Where”? That sounds fantastic? I’m still a little lost with this new information. I can’t wait to see it. Art collection??????
Albus’ Grandmother, Professor Molly Weasley has also confirmed. Grandfather Arthur Weasley has declined because of previous obligations and sends regrets.
“THAT’S GARETH WITH AN ORANGE FLAT TOP!!!!!”
So this folly is my personal aesthetic. Objects that I have collected that I love. Things that I find not only beautiful, but often fascinating. Most are somewhat unconventional.
Dad. Do you have a minute to come down to Ollivanders?
“Love it!”
“Yes.”
You guys can go up there anytime you want. Just let us know.
How many?
“We’ll do it!”
“The issue that could be worrying is his use of wordless spells and charms. It’s very unusual and advanced. It could cause concern later, especially if a spell is used in anger.”
Don’t worry about what to make! Get your shower and get those boys over to the house. I’m on my way home right this minute. We’ll talk about the project tonight. You’ve got to be at Luna’s in TWENTY. Don’t be late!
“So you don’t deny it’s a bribe?”
Not a problem.
Shite! That’s wonderful and a little frightening? Congratulations!
Hey Sean. I’m going to leave this chat open for you. If you have any questions for me today let me know and I’ll do my best. Please clear me off your schedule for all of tomorrow. I’m going to spend the day with my Son.
What?
Language.
Did you get your Mr. Jordan notices?
“I love it the most. I’ll wear it to the next ministry ball.”
That’s what matters. But I reserve approval anyway.
“Not in the middle of Diagon!”
We’re very busy, Harry. Text is easier than an owl today.
She wants to do it, but I don’t understand it.
We just gave them our enthusiastic approval.
For a reason.
“I’m going to cheat and use magic on it. A LOT of magic.”
—————————————————————————
Mr. Liogell from Gringotts has contacted me and given authorization for me to correspond with him concerning the events. Minister Granger-Weasley has also confirmed that she will supply the agreement once it’s been approved.
Poor Mr. Jordan is eating her biscotti with watering eyes.
We are on our way to your office. We are open to the options.
“At least I fitted it for you, Scarhead. It was far too small.”
After that last one we need to lighten it up.
If I wasn’t
I really need to get back to my actual job. Are you going to be okay?
“Sure. It would be a lot easier not to have to travel with it.”
Harry, you’ve just added even more people!
That could be dangerous. I vote that you take it to Ollivander. I’m not joking.
“No they wouldn’t be allowed to touch. It will be treated as a museum. Visitors would be escorted through the manor to view it. They might want to hold parties either in one of the Ballrooms or the Dining Hall. No overnight guests.”
“At least now they know for sure that we’re not going to just let them bat eyelashes and get our surprise out of us.”
I might rethink the fruit pies. I’ll take requests! Molly’s pork is good! We’ll have the grills put out up there.

Edit: I added a line to clarify.
LOL the kids are concerned.
“Shall we? . . . . . . . .”
I’m not going to deny that they look good, but just UGH!
They weren’t arguing. Grayson is just animated when he gets excited. You know that. Just looked different from upstairs I guess. Also we don’t have a Muggle problem. We can just float the fish off the Lorry.

This one is a whopper. Hope you enjoy!

“Good Morning!”

“The card is charmed. I’m writing my personal number on here. If you disclose the number to anyone else, I think you’ll end up with 12 weeks of a goiter and boils or something. You got it?”
Shite. Things just got serious.
“I’ll coordinate a schedule if you’d like. . . make a sign up sheet or something.”
“Okay It’s not so bad. At least it looks cozy. Still pretty dark and the furniture is too heavy. Those two couches are alright. Art is UGH. There’s another portrait for you, Narcissa.”

ME?? You brought it up!
“Again, Louis had the idea. He found it when he was touring vaults with Jay. There are others down there too. The Peverell vault is fucking HUGE.”
“Well I might need some coffee beans from the old spike roastery then. That’s over in Peckham.”
They belong to the guy in the portrait at Grimmauld.
“Dammit!
“We’re almost there already?”
“I didn’t say that. It should be mandatory.”
“A code?”

Hang paintings with Ted. Test with Decram.
“Right over there, with Poppy and Minnie. I told her she didn’t need to but she’s really taken to her. They look very cozy under her warming charms.”
Well that’s an annual event, but yes. It’s been way too long.

The public records filings this morning included the very interesting news that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were married this past Saturday.
C%^^$(*&#**&##
That’s true.
Isn’t it a little early for the leaky?
It will be the new headquarters for Malfoy-Potter Enterprises and the foundation work.
“True, but this is a big deal.”
Please let me know if you would have interest and if you do we could arrange a meeting. First with myself, and then with the boys if that’s something you would agree with.
“Points to Slytherin.”
“Of course. Draco too.”
We already have that solution.

“Shall I assume that your favourite cabernet is acceptable for our adventure? Or do we need to carve cups out of beachwood and make a tea from seaweed?”
You’ll want to take advantage of that. If you need to soften it up or it’s too bright there’s a shade charm embedded in the glass. Just point your wand to the rune on the desk here like this.”
And she was choosing jewels to go with each set of robes! EVEN FOR BREAKFAST! AND AGAIN. I WILL NOT WEAR A TIARA!

“I think we do?”
“Okay, you sit right here. Both Davey and Jon. . . . . . .Lily, I need you to come and help me out.”
“That’s it. THAT is how you win at Wizards Chess, Weasel.”
Are you telling me that you’re sending a freaking Goblin to Australia for my signature?
“Ha ha. . . . but yeah, you’re right! I’ll check with Uncle Nev before I kiss him for sure.”
“Family meeting afterwards.”
NOPE!
Witch Weekly did.
“My hands are full of sticky fruit can you go with Draco and parsel the gate to the lab?”
“That’s perfectly fine. I’m just amazed at how they’re all so nice to her. She needs this.”
Harry finally contacts Gringotts.
LOL yes, going okay. Louis is getting everyone into the fucking freezing cold water. He’s got the wetsuits and boards out. Did you know Danika is a complete MASTER of warming charms?
I will!
Too Cute.
“This came from Decram?!”
Draco?
powder additive.
Yes! I’m too much baggage! And now I don’t even have a proper home. . . . I’m camping out at his penthouse! You’ve seen the place, I can’t live there permanently I’ll eventually break something and he’ll kick me out onto the street!
Hugo and Grayson are hot. And it was Uncle Harry, Uncle Ron and the freaking Minister of Magic. All at that cafe.
Oh no you don’t Albus-soon-to-be-Malfoy-Potter! You are not leaving the father of your baby daughter for a younger man!
I vote teams.
They SOOOO deserve a vacation. But they always say they’re most happy just staying at home.
I’ll bring your sandwiches! Want coffee or anything?
“SEAMUS!!”
Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress,
Ask Jamie and Ted. Let me go back to sleep.
Plaid slacks with a wide flair and three inch cuffs. I think a turtleneck will do in a matching colour. Hair?
Have fun!
“Draco and Dad are being all mushy. Jerry is pumped. I think he’s finally getting used to being thrown into the Grandparent mix.”
Hugo and Grayson look like a drowned rats.
“Yeah. I need to be a lot older for that one I think.”
I love you.”
The flowers are a token.
It’s a direct connection from Dec’s manor to the main reception parlour. I’ll meet you on the Grimmauld side at 11:00.
“Shall we take a stroll?”
Trandy’s got unlimited lemons and mint. He’s coming over to help you out.
I said they’re perfect. HOW?
It wasn’t cool. I thought we were under attack!
Yeah, I’m kidding about the lime green. But they are repainting the whole place and Jerry is doing the front. Even Zebbs’ cottage is getting a makeover.
“Do I get a hug?”
Hello Harry.
Mr. Harry J. Potter
Go Mister Gamp!
“Parselmouth it! The handle and lock is a snake!”
. . . . . . . . . .
“Alright. We’ll meet you down there.”
“Use it well. Were you trained for the navigation equipment?”
How about you do Christmas Eve, through Boxing and we do the New Year thing?
“I think so . . . . . It’s just weird. Who would ever think those two would bond.”
Yeah, sorry for that first bit, but like I said there are reasons.
Oh no. Not tears. None of that.
I’ll do it first thing next week. Harry and I are just getting ready to head back from the overnight. Then he’s finishing up some things at Gringotts with Zebb. Meeting tonight, then we’re with Ginny and Jerry over the weekend.
“It was on the recommendation of Mr. Liogell at Gringotts.”
What about Snaab?
Bill???
Is Ron going to freak out? He most certainly deserves to do it.
Since Grimmauld is going to be my home I’m going to be a little more selective with the staff though. I want my housekeeping manager Zebb to approve and interview with me. I’ll ask her today for assistance.
“I’ll take that as you like it then.”
“I want the kids to come over.”
“Promise. Won’t go near it!”
“I’ve got glassware for both the meade and the prosecco, see I’m not a heathen. . . . . oh I like your outfit naked spiderweb man!”
Yeah.
Time for a semi-nerd chapter.
What did you do with it?
Scorp filled them all and put the labels on. The jars are cool too. All square.
I’m sure it’s fine. Barnabas guaranteed that it would be a surprise.
I will. Love you.
Not that I know of. We can ask if there’s anything? Did you see Minnie today?
“It means, Mr. Evans that you have some magic ability. It’s a hereditary link. It is not powerful. . . . . . It passed over a generation to you . . . . . let me ask you a question. . . . . do you find tasks that others find very difficult easier to accomplish?”
“Actually I think Hugo’s back over there working with my new assistant. It’s Sunday so Rose would probably be a the Quibbler.”
Some things will not change. You will find many of what we have come to rely on as daily staples remain. These include, the weather forecast, astronomy, crossword, fitness, health, jobs, classifieds and obituaries.
“Salmonella? I see. We might have a conversation about that.”
“Sure! Do you want me to come with you?”
“Have Dean and Seamus fix it up. Like what you did at the cottage. What would you do?”
“What the hell. Okay Pizza! CRAP.”
Ha. Ha.
Woah.
“Okay well that’s disappointing, but not a complete failure. Do you thin.
Because I don’t do revenge fashion.
I really wanted to put it off longer but I agree. It’s time.
“Let me see it.”
“Of course!”
“Different generation. Professional ethics. They work together.”
“We’ve been down with Minnie to your old rooms. I’ll be honest it’s a mess.”
I think she’s right.
“In honour of this eventful day, I would like to present the full Goblin symphony in a tribute. . . . .A midnight concert if you will, silent pyrotechnics provided by George and Ronald . . . . . .I believe that the front row laps are empty and I’ve been informed that’s unacceptable. Everyone must share a lap.”

I have provisions from the Aldi market! I’m making something!
It’s new just for the four of us for now. I had an idea for Davey’s birthday I wanted to run past you guys. We can add others later if we want. It’s just us and I’ve invited Dad for now.
Tick Tock, Tick Tock, Tick Tock. . . . . . .
“Okay Trandy, have a look?”
“We’re giving all of the vanilla biscuits to the owlery?”
“Thanks for the freaking warning. That magic did NOT want to be broken.”
. . . . . . . . . .
I agree.
“I’ve never thought about it before.”
Can you tell me?
No it’s nothing like that.

“Pretty much, yes.”

As time went on I made the decision to have the property left in stasis as a tribute to the time period. This would not have been a safe space for you as an exuberant teen either. I had nightmares of you flying your broom through the windows. I feel that by the time you turn 30 you may be able to appreciate my folly.
“How are you feeling?”
It’s an anti-nausea potion. But this one is for Muggle children.
“It’s even more awesome.”

“I’ve been ready for a long time now. But we have to be in it together.”
Depends on what your last question is.
“SEE?”
Putting the defense classroom back together. Charms isn’t much better to tell you the truth.
I’ve got the map and cloak. We can show those, but the cloak isn’t much to look at. I’ve got a copy of my old wanted poster and a lot more that really is just junk. Robes as you know, school stuff. Griffindor scarves. Ginny has some stuff too if you want to go that route? Harry Potter’s junk doesn’t have to be literal does it? Other people can contribute if they want right? If it’s about that period in time we could show Luna’s lion hat. That’s actual fun.
This is the list for the the columbarium:
“Do you know we’re going to have another baby?”
So I’ll need access to the kitchen glass Monday morning if that’s okay.
What are you going to do with it?
——————————————————————————
That’s fascinating really.
“Well it’s certainly big enough.”
Okay well the thing I didn’t bring up is that we’ve been pretty much living together.
Okay that sounds fine. Hey did you hear what Auntie Luna did? I think it has something to do with the boy's.
“Dad?”
“Your Dad is the same, Scorp! I’m nearly convinced they’re taking some illegal anti age potion. I’m almost sure of it!”
“I want you to do to it what you did at the cottage?”
“Corn sugar. Are you writing this down?”
——————————————————————————
Unless you want our communication to be in your permanent files, yes.
“But you’re up for it?”
“Okay I’ll come up with something.”
You’ll never guess. I caught them trying to sneak out of the back when I came in this morning to open the store.
“So out here it’s going to look as much like a nice old curiosity shop as we can make it. Like it should have been way back. But inside it’s going to be more like a gallery of things.”
that our Sons are getting married??????!!!
“It’s just a little disconcerting that you can access my mind and my dreams.”
“It’s a long one. . . . . “quod facere in corde meo”.”
Al’s right we can’t.
So no more school?
“I know. At least it’s entertaining in hindsight. What’s through there?”
You will be able to apparate directly to the front porch! You all have floo access to the receiving parlour but Decram will be disappointed if you don’t come through the front door! Just ring the bell and come in. Door will be unlocked. Say hello to Decram and then head up the stairs to the second floor or take the elevator.
19:00 it is.
“Ah, there you are. . . . .”
. . . . . .
“What else is new over there?”
“Ha!”
I think this calls for a family weekend retreat at the Lodge.
“Probably because pizza is so easy to just order.”
“This isn’t wizard shite this time. This is Muggle cray people. Don’t blame it on the wizards!”
“I am glad that Jay’s getting some more qualified help down there. But everyone does seem to be enjoying themselves.”
“If you do, I’ll pout.”
I loathe to say I’m starting to like the place now. I’ll bet Draco knows someone for music in the entry hall.
“First it’s Lily and her boyfriend from Australia, then he brought Hugo’s boyfriend's parents from the freaking Isle of Man, and now YOU.”
“First, I’d like to give you a small gift. . . . .if you look above you . . . . . now, I’ve made one of these for every one of my Grandchildren. . . . ”

Work at Centre/Grimmauld Study.
Soon it was time for an all crew lunch. Reba’s Cafe was gracious enough to open her doors on a day normally closed to the public. And who did Reba have to assist? Albus Malfoy-Potter and family legend Zebb. Narcissa Black stepped in to help prepare and serve the luncheon with assistance from Mr. Trandy of Grimmauld Place. With Albus assisting in the kitchen, Grandparents took the opportunity to dote over our Granddaughter, Aspen Astoria Malfoy-Potter.

I swear to merlin no one is going to live down there! I own 130 fucking townhouses out there I can spare a couple for my staff to have a decent place to live!”
“Scarhead of course.”
We’ll do an afternoon thing. Bring the kids!
“Just one other bedroom. Small one and a bathroom.”
Good.
“I like it but not for the reception. How about the guest level?”
Miss Parks and Miss Cam
Why green?
“Try it and cast “mixtio”.”
“Now when I designed the offices on this level I made the walls between them with the diffused glass. It lets in the light throughout this level. There’s a privacy charm on them. You’ll see what I mean once there’s activity up here. You won’t notice anyone else up here.”
“A new routine for Mr. Brick. I think he will enjoy it eventually.”
. . . . . . . . . .
I see. Harry you should have told us this!
“Where do you have those made?”
“Al’s not going to the pool so I don’t get Aspen today either. That sucks. I didn’t have any other real plans.”
“Oh that’s just not right. We’ll have to fix that soon.”
“Technically this is probably lilac.”
“The windows are impressive. That glass is beautiful. I’ll bet it’s backlit from the outside at night.”
“OUCH no wonder they need helmets.”
—————————————————————————
We don’t really know each other much, but I really like you and I’m afraid that I’m going to mess things up with my new job. But it’s better that you know this now instead of later. I’m Gay, and I like you a lot. Do you understand what I mean?
_____________
Perfect.
I will as soon as he comes home. And now we’re definitely coming by to see the park.
“The handle alone is a work of art. What are the foot rests?”
Yes, we’ll see. So if I designated 3 seats to each of those kids that 18 right there.
“He’s not colour blind you know. You say he is because he likes to mix up the colours and doesn’t care if they clash a bit. But see, that jumper brings out your eyes and the hint of lavender underneath is genius. Plus it shows off your collarbone. It’s no wonder the press is clamoring for photos.”
See you next week!
What did I do?
“OH.”
All done. Planned. DONE MOTHER.
McGonagall thinks Walburga MURDERED THEM. This makes me SO MAD! I’m FUCKING FURIOUS!
“He wants us to go down there.”
Actually I think that’s all for today.
Waiting with bated breath.
“Look at the back cover.”
“Third with the grey and muted tones I thought for your study. It won’t clash with the
“Oh.”
COOL!
Or, you could explore the Prince Overview Point property. It's a nice juxtaposition to the others. Draco would take you there.
Blech. Not much better, but okay. Then that’s it?
Seriously Gin you could not have done a better job.
What’s happened?
“Yes. Your Mother and Zebb have it all planned. Spring rolls are involved. I’ve made an apple thing. Zebb already has it.”
I’m not making a joke Draco. You guys look good in those photo’s.
OH! Yes if you think it would work? Isn’t it too late?
Okay!
“Agreed. Go ahead.”
“Does Al ever speak parsel to you?”
I can’t tell you that I’m supposed to be neutral!
“I don’t believe this. Al, Jamie? Thank you so much. Draco. . . . . I’m pretty speechless.”
“Just say YES!”
Very good! Bye.
Okay, everybody gets to pick a spell! Let’s get this over with. Mother this is your call.
“Thanks, Zebb. No one else knows yet. Our secret for now.”
So yes to meeting at Daisy’s. Just tell me when. I’ll work it out.
Victoire = Leopard
Super short bonus chapter.
“I will! Did Scorp like it? . . . .please leave your hair down for me today? It’s so pretty in the sunlight.”
We can start higher than the baby jump.
Welcome to the family Aspen!
“Must be the snake blood.”
“Okay.”
Most Sincerely,
5 Seconds to write your answer:
Harry chat's with Jay.
Kensington
Yeah, time to hang up the Posie. And Jamie, at least he’s FIT.
“It’s light and pretty enough for any holiday. If you wanted something with holly leaves or something we’d get you some.”
“I like the doors. . . . the glass is like downstairs . . .there’s a doorbell?”
The property foundation is a hybrid of magical and muggle building techniques as requested by your Grandmother. She built the Potter Lodge in 1953 and closed it in 1964. I have asked for information concerning it’s condition.
“Al, put this in your pocket.”
“Even if he were to somehow escape, his magic has been revoked permanently. That was my special request as punishment for what he did to his son’s magic. The Department of Mysteries was more than happy to accommodate. They sucked it out of him right in front of the Wizengamot and threw it into the ether. If he were to escape, which cannot happen, he wouldn’t even have the ability to perform a Muggle card trick.”
“Grayson, just put on your nice trainers. . . . . turn around. . . . yes. Much better, You’re instructed to purchase more trainers. . . . .They’ll go with the jeans as well, but I prefer the oxfords. . . . .so we’ll do another three of those in angora and four with a shawl collar. I think a few cardigans in mohair. You can choose the colours, weave and textures here. . . . Just wear a crew neck under those. If in doubt black always works. You can choose any of these colours but I'd stay away from that boring antique parchment one. . . .Hugo help him choose.”
Okay let’s get started. I thought we’d begin with what you’re up to today.
Okay, I’ll approve then. Get back up here the parade is nearly finished and the kids are bouncing. Waiting for the freaking cake.
“I am. But I’ve been waiting for this marriage for longer than you can imagine. This cake is going to be beautiful and taste wonderful. I’ll help you along as you need it while I do the other things.”
“I mean it’s pretty and all but it’s all so much.”
I’d be up for Lost Boys. Patio is open.
I'll post the second half of this on Sunday.
The interview turned out awesome! Thanks so much.
Wow. Hello? Does this work?
“It was very last minute. You don’t recognize the dragon?”
“I thought everyone should be able to use it. Like a private park? If we do the wall around the house we could extend it to include the two townhouses on either side. Thats our new staff housing, then they could use the house courtyard too. That area would be private and the staff could enjoy it. That would be nice? And then the rest of the park would be open to the tenants.”
He’s not. I’ve just been to the Centre. He’s fine. We just needed to make a decision about the priorities. We want to change the schedule a little.
“You will need your wand. We must test your magic. I may need to adjust the charm.”
The bus seats over 30. There’s a section for the younger kids and it’s Draco and Harry approved for safety AND my driving skills!
“We can do this?”
Hope you're having a great weekend. See you midweek.
Yeah, I’d like that. Tomorrow after shopping?
“I’m all ready to go. Then, we can place and test them this afternoon.”
Scorp has been avoiding his Grandmother. You know it’s bad.
Alright. Well today we were going to ask you guys out for coffee or something?
“OH MY GOD!”
“I was so excited. . . . I wanted to hold his hand and hug him. And he was so fucking beautiful. . . . but then he insulted Hagrid . . . . sounded just like Dudley being a brat.”
No, we’re going to do it at Grimmauld in the conservatory.

Uncle Harry, It will be my honour!
I wanted Pansy to help out? I told her to sort it out but not go insane with it. Plus it’s fun for me to see Hugo crushing on his boyfriend looking so sharp.
Bring Hermione!
and these tracks could use some brushing up . . . . .
Mr. J. Liogell
Are you Fucking kidding me? Uncle Harry can get these things actually passed?
Such a simple thing, mowing the lawns. He really loves it. I forget.
It really does need an upgrade. Also it will be more “their place” and not just them moving into your old house. OMG Scorp is gonna freak the fuck OUT.
And out of fucking nowhere they just start singing songs? I call Bullshite!
Maybe have Hugo come over to #12 after the meeting.
Okay guys, I’m going to go set up! See you here at around lets say 19:00?
“WHAT?”
“Owls.”
NO! Don’t do it Louis.
“Did you know Louis was dating the Lovegood-Longbottom boy?”
Find what he likes?
Your phone?
—————————————————————————
“Mother that’s a perfect idea. And they’ll do it for Harry.”
“I apologize. This is something I just didn’t notice when we were here before.”
Regards,
Aunt Narcissa did that?
“That snitch is mine.”
Time for a party at Potter Lodge.
You’ve got it.
“YES!”
ALRIGHT??????!!!
You have no idea!
Is that your LEGAL opinion Hugo????
“So much light. Walls?”
“That’s for sure.”
Caudwell’s Castle, Oxford
This is “The Potter Manor”. Your relative of the portrait actually did build it SO, the next time you accuse your dear old Dad/Uncle of GOING OVERBOARD remember this place and be forewarned!
I’ll still make a dessert, but I want to make something different too. Who’s up for COLD TRIPE SALAD????
“Thank you.”
You wrote the list when you were 14?
“Anyone? What about someone underage?”
“I am. But do you really think I have the patience for it?”
“Thank you Harry. Thank you so much.”
“Yes.”
Yes. Just be respectful of the place.
“You’re kidding?”
“What’s the verdict?!”
“Let’s head back and meet the staff?”
Your carrot cake? With the frosting?
Okay.
is in progress and soon to be known as Malfoy-Potter Cottage! Draco designed the remodel. Dean and Seamus are doing the work so we know it’s going to be fantastic. Jerry is working on the front grounds (which you know has never been a priority before). I’ve seen the plans it’s going to be awesome. I am so happy to be able to pass this property on to the boys and future generations!
Mysteries has them on secreting people off to foreign countries to evade authorities. They have dates and locations. MLE has them on not only fraud and conspiracy charges, but Muggle tax evasion in six countries. There’s also what Muggles call a multi-level marketing scam.
“No idea.”
Phil is playing some nice chill music for our dinner, but did you notice that huge orchestra space next to the pianoforte? Looks like a dance floor to me! He’s all set up for something a little more current and upbeat after dessert! I’ve already requested Elderbrook and I think Danika Lovegood-Longbottom is going to assist him with the selections.
I would have no idea.
OH! Well this changes things.
“I will.”
Love you bye!
“So there’s nothing wrong with his foot.”
Get this: Potter acceptance. Tomorrow. 8AM.
The Clam pass is probably pre-loaded then for a years worth of trips. What’s the coffee?
“Astra.”
Edit: As usual as I find the mistakes.
Oops?
“We can do that. A whole day of nothing.”
“Hear anything about how that went with Ginny and Jerry?”
“And I love having Lily and Eric here. I’m still in a little bit of shock that we get to do this and be neighbours.”
“Help me up! Jon and the Papa’s get up here for the picture!”
“Don’t know.”
A super short chapter to tie up more loose ends, or open up another can of worms.
“This is a very unusual situation. I’ve done my analysis. It’s very unusual. . . . .nothing I’ve experienced before. . . . . . a braided heartstring.”
“Is that them?”
I have an idea. I could do something like a light blue chair, like a wingback and he would stand aside it or be seated. Also a side table with flowers or something.
“Baby’s gone. Back in a sec.”
Account Manager
“So what do you need?”
Rose = Magpie
“We don’t smoke!”
——————————————————————————
STILL CUTE :) Just teasing you. Everything going okay?
“I will. But not tonight. Tonight I’m going to watch fireworks with my husband, drink champagne and finish this cake.”
“You will?”
So what you mean is that family members have been mistakenly left out of the wedding.
THANK YOU JAMIE. Scorp is skeptical but we’re going to hand that one over to Draco.
They brought us coffee and pastries to the lake. There’s even tables down there. They’ve outdone themselves. Mr. Gunnar is a total crackup. He’s got a magic fish smoker. Danika is fascinated with it. He’s helping out. We’re all now headed to the dining hall for breakfast.
“What kind of magic can you do? I want to know!”
17:00?
“This one
“We’re coming. Is it time?!”
I see. I haven’t read anything yet today. Let me look.
“There’s Luna of course. Louis, Teddy, Dominique, Danika and Gareth?”
“Can I take you both home?”
“Go ahead Ferret!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve got writing stuff. Tonight after the meeting your task should be to write your Mum. Tell her about your new job and give her your new address. Give Snabb here some exercise. I’ve got a business card in my pocket just a sec. . . . .okay now, are you any good with geminio?”
“And it’s basically liveable I can remove the things I don’t want. Change things out. Like the portraits. I want art.”
“Okay what have you got?!”
I’m truly sorry. I won’t do it again.
Yes. Draco and I have gone over the numbers with a fine toothed comb. That’s all set. Barnabas has signed off on it. I was a little sad that Rose didn’t want to take over as editor but then we looked at the publishing statistics.
“Are you ready?”
“That’s what we’re celebrating.”
“We’ll take care of that right away. I promise! Why don’t you just get out of them and into your pajamas. Do you want to watch the TV with Teddy and Davey?”
“Good.”
“Harry look at this place. It’s perfect for it. Summertime barbecues up on the roof or in the back garden? Parties in your conservatory?”
“Yes please.”
Not totally. We can still voice our opinion when necessary.
“I love you honey! I’m relieved to know you’re happy and settled in and safe. I know you’re going to have the best time ever, okay?”
“I’m definitely not tired. Well I’m tired of being kicked in stomach! And excited. Poppy was going over the spells and telling me about what she’s going to do. Her spell book is huge.”
Start by sharing with us the parts you’re not willing to change. And we’ll go from there. Tell us what you would be really disappointed with if we changed it.
Sorry about that, Grayson!
Hope you're having a great week.
Dudley and Lucy Evans
Just let me know, I’ll work around it.
Okay if I tell, you have to promise not to tell ANYONE else and spoil it.
“Merlin it’s beautiful.”
Are you sure about this?
Oh alright. I’ll wait!
So you’ve really hired him to do it?
Most Sincerely,
Okay I’ve got to go work on the article. I’ll let you guys know before we put it out.
“I won’t disagree.”
“Have something healthy too. Both of you. Can I tempt either of you with my fruit kabobs?”
“I’ve set him up with a foundation email account too.”
“NO. I will not do that.”
“UGH. Can’t we just buy them out now?”
“Only you, Harry. Merlin’s toast. What did you do?”
I’ll go though all my stuff tomorrow. Let me know when I can come back for that kitchen table set?
“What else do you have planned for today?”
“Better?”
“It’s pretty amazing. You will really love it.”
What?!
Ginny Weasley-Linder
“The sorting hat got SASSY!”
“Okay, now what?”
“I’ve left scones from my Father’s bakery in your dining room. He’s also made clotted cream, I’ve left that in Mr. Trandy’s cooling cabinet.”
“I need a favour, can I come through?”
A better example? Harry now has like nine names and he’s just honed it down to two. Important legal paperwork carries it all, but for everyday life it’s perfectly appropriate to use the truncated name.
“OH! The Weasel is getting aggressive! . . . . . .
You know what? I’m just going to take his word for it and sign the requests. I’m calling an emergency Wizengamot session.
It’s fine we’re just hanging out now.
“Draco it’s pretty.”
Scribblifors - Incantation (quill transfiguration)
“Why, yes I did.”
“OH MY GOD THAT’S PERFECT! ONLY YOU COULD WORD IT LIKE THAT!”
Things he didn't know what to do with. That's locked up tight. He only goes in there if necessary.
The Creepy Hotel is off limits! We WILL protest! With big signs and everything!
that fabric?”
Date tonight!
We’re coming home, make sure there are not socks laying all over the place or Zebb will hear about it!
I just popped over to my office for some paperwork. When I’m done here I’m going back to your Dads.
What did you do this time?
Let’s meet at 15:00 to get ready. In the master?
“I hear there will be karaoke. Am I invited to participate.”
“I know.”
——————————————————————————
I’m wasn’t a big fan of the twist. . . . . seven.
“HA!”
“I was expecting that part. It’s going to be okay. We’re really having a party at the Burrow? And not some formal ball?”
“Shite!”
it becomes a crisis. It benefits everyone. And sometimes magic, or throwing money at a problem isn't the only or best answer. Just keep that in mind. . . . . . now, you want help getting these owls out?”
All I’ve got on Monday is the family level check in with Dean and Seamus. They’ll be here all day so we can do that later in the day.
“Going!”
“Sneaky snake!”
“Believe this.”
“It’s a mess in there though. And three floors of it. There’s a basement too.”
“I will demonstrate a falling rain. Dean will transfigure this common quill into a magic umbrella.”
“Alright so now let’s talk about the basement. The lower kitchen is mostly decorative at this point but still useful. Do what you want with it but don’t go overboard. Trandy will use it to cook for the two of you. He’ll stay out of your kitchen here. You don’t want a main cook so that’s out. And then there’s the wine cellar. Trandy’s domain. He knows his stuff, you let him do it. You let Trandy and Draco stock it. Unless you suddenly want to learn about wine.”
I think my favourite new thing is a sauna. This whole place is so relaxing. Just what everyone needed.
“House Rule! Sunblock charm on the roof and in the conservatory!”
The kids chat.
“So with the smaller ones it’s more just a bubbler in the center and the water will spill gently over the edge  . . . . like a sheet all the way around. Then .
. . . . . Alright Hugo. If you would please introduce the Legislation.
The Family Meeting will be on the same day, following the Grimmauld event. We are going to have the meeting event catered but may need serving and clean up staff that evening.

“So what do you need from me?”
“Draco!”
Yeah, pretty much.
“Zebb. Do NOT.”
A most wonderful day was had by all.
“The planters look gorgeous.”
Davey says HI. I Love You Uncle Al!
I’ll bet Dad is over the moon.
LLL: You plan to continue freelance then?
FOUR???
“I have a better idea. . . . I’m fed up with Teddy underestimating his talents. . . . For now let me photograph them. . . . Can you ask Grayson to bring the car out?”
“Okay what about this gate?”
16 each:
“That tickles!”
“YES!. . . . . . . .”
Harry
Okay, message received. We could go back to lists.
“It’s even worse than what I was expecting. Are you sure about this?”
Okay let’s do that. And I’ll okay the wands too, but I want to retrieve them myself and place them in the exhibit. I’m the only one who gets to handle them.
OMG have you seen what Ginny’s husband is doing in the front? It’s sooooooo cool.
Hold on BRB
“Yes, mother found it when we were looking for the dining room. It’s next to it behind the staircase. Looks like the door to a closet but once you're inside it's pretty big, See?”
“Do you realize how big of a deal this is?”
“You know. Snape thanked me for taking good care of you, but I know it’s the other way around.”
“Potter.”
“Grampa! This is the best cake ever made!”
“Mother I like it. It suits it much better now.”
When did this start?
“Okay, more than a little.”
“We found this upstairs and brought it down. It’s a nice heavy crystal. Spelled unbreakable.”
“Let me see.”
Oh hell no. You can’t throw that out there and expect us not to bite.
“So you just select what you want and I’ll make reservations for an elf hostel in Cuba.”
“So what else was on this main floor?
Merlin. Of course I trust your judgement. It's always better than mine. But I would REALLY like to get out of this house?
“We Love you ZEBB!”
16:00? Maybe come back with us and we’ll just make some dinner maybe watch the TV?
Probably, but that’s how it’s always worked.
“Do it again! Grampa Draco do it!”
“I know!”
Okay I’ll try to get down there asap.
“What?”
“I’m not sure? The whole car or the just lady that tells me where to turn?”
I KNOW!
“They’re crystal.”
“Sparks over there!”
“Yeah?”
Congratulations are in order to Harry and Draco Malfoy-Potter.
“You can leave that box right there where it is and never be bothered with it again, or I can open it. If you choose to just leave it there we’re finished.”
Fancy clothes! Look at the fucking hotel and restaurant.
LOL I like how they can’t just make things up!
And our hot water heater down there was FAKE! I have no idea where our hot water comes from now.
Account Manager
“So pretty.”
“Yes. . . . . Dad did too.”
“For Jon. . . . . I’ve made your favourite trail mix . . . . . . .Davey do you want trail mix too? I have cucumber chips, carrot sticks and your baby tomatoes. You can have any you like. There’s plenty.”
Have fun with Grampa.
“Come on! Bring the wine.”
I’ll have a draft for you in ten minutes! It’s going to be BLUNT.
Oh. I’m going to write up the explanation about the titles instead of doing some dumb speech. We can put it on scrolls and ask Zebb to hand them out to people as they arrive. She’ll like that. Do we have staff to pour drinks and clear tables?
OMFG.
Let me ask George.
“Cool! . . . .It wasn’t bad. Just a little tickle behind my eyes.”
Okay.
You just made my job a lot easier!
“Merlin!”
That actually sounds awesome. Unlike the rabid cockroach and her leafy animagadung beetle.
“I don’t know yet, but it will work sometimes.”
No! Really? Okay so I have a whole collection of miniature locomotives. The whole point is to keep them on the rails!
“Their Mother was originally from Mauritius. . . island off east Africa. We’re not sure why she came here, there’s no record of any family either here or there. It’s been thought that maybe her magical abilities were exposed and she fled but that’s just speculation. . . .Their Father was a potions researcher originally from Pakistan. This is what I was trying to get across. . . .they have one living biological relative who lives in a small village. . . . .It says Dera Bugti . . . .He wanted nothing to do with magic and he wants nothing to do with his son’s “tainted” children. The parent’s will was very explicit in denouncing him. Very adamant about it in fact. So we’ve had him legally severed. He was happy to do it. Identifying information is not in this file and remains sealed with the Ministry until both boys are of age. . . Here’s a photograph of the boys.”
“Ferret.”
“Nothing I guess. But this morning I’m pointing out the cute guy out working in the yard to Al and it turns out to be Harry. UGH. It was horrible. And Al knew the whole time!”
Of course not. I’m just telling you the seafood options!
“Yes the first time it definitely will be. But it’s really fairly harmless. Mostly it’s just a little rumbling and rattling. You may see sparks on his fingertips.”
“No, she has
“The kids weren’t wrong when they said he was a genius.”
We can speak about it more when you are in on Friday for interviews.
You saw the (expletive) they pulled with their wedding. (expletive) photographers hiding in the trees for merlins sake. Skeeter tried to (expletive) interview Ted as we were (expletive) walking down the aisle! I hexed that (expletive) right there on the lawn. At least they got pictures of that!. This is why Al and Scorps wedding is so secretive. We are not going to let them do something like that ever again. When they started in on Al and Scorp while they were still at Hogwarts is when we finally sued them.
Yes. Not going to tell you!
“WE’RE FINE! ”
“Say you like it.”
“Never thought I’d see the day that Blaise Zabini would be a good fit for Narcissa Malfoy, but here we are.”
“I think it’s titanium? Do you want to try it out?”
“So Lucy, I’m going to ask you some serious questions is that okay?”
The midweek update is about cars and things.
“That’s freaking Draco?”
Actually soon, but if you’re using Grayson’s it’s custom. I’ll make you some more. Family perk:) What happened to the one I made for you Hugo?
“Wow.”
“Do you think I’m going to ask my Dad if he’s taking reverse ageing potions?”
Oops.
I can book it?
So, ANYWAY, Luna and I will be happy to help out Sparky and Crystal. I’ll ask them what they need.
OH NO. This will not end well.
Soon. That’s why I need the ponds finished.
Could be?”
“That was quite the reunion they had outside.”
I get what you’re saying but you should have seen them working on the park together. It’s going to be amazing if they do it. It will be so nice to be able to go out there.
C/O Mr. Draco L. Malfoy
“Act NORMAL. Don’t stare at them.”
Free to Hogwarts students at the Wheezes.
Will you wear your Gryffindor uniform?
Ruined. I was once feared as a horrible death eater person. Intimidating! They used to write that I was aloof and a snob! Now I’ve been reduced to Ron’s chess partner and a besotted Grampa.
“Okay . . .and goodbye Decram.”
“HA!”
Okay I’m going to finish up and I’ll see you in a bit. You should check in with Ron too.
“Happy Holidays?”
A spectacular display of synchronized fireworks from the Manor, three locations on the grounds, and an island on the lake concluded the evening.
Anglesey, Wales
You can tell Ron what’s going on. I’ll talk with Draco of course.
Yes you may.
Hope you're having a great week!
I’ve been sitting on this for at least three weeks.
Uncle Harry there are tears coming out of that gallery. It’s like shock or something for some people. They’re seeing things from a different perspective.
Dear Mr. Potter,
“That’s your innate ability. It’s a form of mind magic, yes.”
“Wow. It’s stunning, Narcissa.”
Awesome! I didn’t know that.
FU Parkinson!
“The whole team is going purple for the meet on Wednesday. We’re not the only ones who can get away with looking this fantastic.”

Mr. McAlroy is on a well deserved vacation. He is no longer my personal assistant. Please update your files: Mr. Sean McAlroy is now the executive coordinator for Malfoy-Potter Enterprises and will be your point of contact for any and all questions or correspondence concerning Mr. Potter, our families and/or myself.
“You do?”
“I know. You’re in for a treat.”
We’ll find a space. Put the word out for qualified people and Jay can augment that with Goblin help.
Do you have any idea how much money is in those freaking vaults?

I’m with Jamie?
“I am???”
The birthday party team previews a muggle movie.
“So no then . . . . . . . These trousers are nice. They’d be good with this crew neck . . . . . oh wait . . . . . . those trousers with this shirt. Try this.”
“No Kidding. Wow. We need to talk about the painting.”
I’m also tasked with trying to convince Kreacher to accept independence from the Grimmauld bond and we hope to persuade him to move from the Hogwarts grounds so he can reside with his companion (who is also Minerva’s assistant).
——————————————————————————
Speaking of the move, do you or Jerry want anything from the cottage before I clear it out? I think I’ll put most things in storage and let the kids pick through it later.
If I try to speak about the THING all that comes out are dad jokes.
AWESOME!
“NO.”
“I’ll let you go while I help Zebb with the cheese platter.”
“I’ll take Draco then.”
“And the ones of you snogging at the beach that Rose is going to send over the weekend.”
“Potter. As much as I’d love to I have an appointment.”
Did you talk with Jamie?
Yes, you will. At least to maintain the properties. Actually you could probably use one of those properties for a headquarters. And have your lawyers draw up Iron Clad confidentiality contracts. Magical ones with
“I don’t know what you’re saying but keep it up.”
I’m coming to a game.
PLEASE NO.
“Excellent! Go ahead. Where's your wand?”
“Because I want to see the evidence of my kisses on your pretty skin. I didn’t say where they would be.”
“Don’t believe.”
I missed you this morning :(
“We need you.”
“See? Pasta. Cold pasta with artichoke hearts.”
Actually I think we go the other direction. Save the champaign for something worthy of it.

Maybe I’ll request some buttons for you ;)

OMG I totally do! And I could never do that at the manor anyway. Win!
So what you’re saying is that we put the date back further to 1946 and it will be more like what the earlier generation of Blacks intended.
“Yes?”
“You’re welcome! Thank you for being an awesome Grandson. I’ll make you a cake any time you want. Doesn’t have to be your birthday.”
View the baby photo and write down who you think it is.
UGH. Manipulative much?
“Bonded couple. Cibly has groundskeeping experience. She could take that position. Keeley has less experience, but she would be fine for one of the general housekeeping positions.”
“Here on the door. The markings. This one is James. Here’s me. This one is Lily. Every year. First day of school. Dad would draw the line and write the date on the door. Look.”
You’re welcome. TTYL!
But what if you aren’t available? I need to drive!
“It’s like a tunnel”
“It seems the house is accommodating your needs again.”
You should come down here to see it.
SM: Auntie Luna, you know all this but for the purpose of your interview we’ll talk about it. Al is a bearer.
The Goblin delivery service has been instructed to wait for your response. If this is not possible please use a secure owl post to the address below.
“Free to the public. Donations only.”
“And one final thing and then Lucy can get back to her party guests. . . . . I’ve made you this comforter. . . .you can use it on your bed, or take it down to your common room when it gets chilly. Normally the initial “L” would go on a jumper, but you’ll have to wait for Christmas for that. I’ve done it in this silvery grey with the green background. Once you’ve been sorted and settled into your dorm room we can change the colours if you’d like, but I’m pretty confident that you’ll get your Slytherin wish.”
That’s so weird.
“Wear it for me? I’ve even got you pants to go with it . . . . cobra pants!”
This is so bad. Harry. HELP!
Can’t sell them to Muggles. They’ve all got potion ingredients.
Yes. And I mean casual. No big freaking banquets. We can do something in your dining room, or in the larger one upstairs but just have the family over for a nice dinner. And when I say casual I mean it. No suits or robes. Just wear something nice like your soft jumper? I’ll take you shopping again?
“Most people call me Graycie. I suppose that would be okay?”
Bonus Monday!

Well, he’s from small family from New Zealand. Wilson Family. They’re all magic. He’s tall, blonde. Plays muggle football for fun. Pretty much an all around “Lad” but also very sweet and introspective. He likes computer games and composes music. He makes sculptures on a printer that uses plastic thread and turns it into sculptures. I actually can’t explain that last part but it’s really cool.
“Simple would be throwing a box of Muggle cereal and milk on the kitchen counter.”
Yes. It’s fantastic. I want you to see it before I start having work done.
I bought the building. If Ron doesn’t want it we can lease it out. I’m not joking this wizard neighborhood is in demand.
Yes that would be great!
“I swear Uncle George tried to slip him Demon Dung and Wiz-bangs.”
I’m on my way. Are you hungry?
Dudley and Lucy Evans
“What do you mean?”
“Dad says I can call you Uncle? Is that really okay?”
“This is a spare office?”
I like that.
“Well, I guess he was right then?”
UGH. We lost. It was brutal. Unbelievable Billywigs were unbelievably bad.
What?
“Or we
“Wow. Double core!”
“May I make a breakfast in the morning? Will Mister Hugo be for breakfast?”
Yeah keep thinking that. I CAN say that it won’t be embarrassing. You can trust me on that part.
What?
She says should we eat first?
RON. STOP.
“Six.”
Yes. It’s sad in its own way, but actually tells a story. I like the others too. Some of it is quite dark.
. . . . . .”•” You need this belt and shoes. . . . .
“Stop laughing at me! It’s not funny!”
“Big?”
Sweet!
“Woah it’s like the whole side of the house! That view is INCREDIBLE!”
Oh no. Don’t tell me. You know I’d spill. I’m in no mood to be hexed by either of you.
In concept it looks like a muggle wristwatch or bracelet. It has several push buttons. You push the button for where you want to go and it takes you there? There’s a safety mechanism to avoid accidents. So, say you’re at home and you need to get to work, you just push the button designated for “work” and it takes you to that pre-programmed destination or vise versa.
Crap. Rose, you have to promise me.
“No. I’ve been having her watch tv.”

“Hey! That wasn’t part of the prank! NO. I withdraw my support of this prank!”
“I have no idea what to do with this whole floor!”
I’m serious you know.
“Like what?”
That’s an affirmative then. Do you want me to bring anything home? Do we need to make something for lunch?
Not hopeless. Just a reminder that you chose those hideous oval sinks for the cottage.
“I know we’ve settled our differences, but this is a new chapter. I’m looking forward to it. And I know how fucking weird this all must be for you. Can we work on it?”
Alicia Ogden, Member thirty four - three seats.
That floor with all the classrooms. I’d like to keep the art, music and the miniature greenhouse rooms, but the others can be redone for the staff. . .Trandy can have the offices to coordinate things. There’s already a nice lounge area. We won’t use it. We could put in a small gym in that spell practice room or something.
Yes. The consequences will be harsh but I’m talking about more than words spelled on a forehead or boils and goiters. I’m talking loss of magical privileges consequences.
You know Al and I both cook, but I taught him mostly. So probably muggle appliances?
Your category is “Idiot or not idiot?” I need 4 questions and answers.
I have one. For the purpose of the Legislation can you define what you mean by a Magical Person? How does this apply to say an Elf?
“I’ve got fish to feed, owl’s to check on. I need to fix the sign on Grayson’s office and make him new business cards. Then I have a Grandson who needs me to deliver a wand to his school so he can use it for spell practice. I’m a busy man!
“It’s normally around 10 to 15 percent. I meet with Mr. Faunt at your accountants offices once per year. Taxes are just part of everyday life.”
“Okay. What about the vegetable garden then? Did you want to work on that too?"
Okay I’ll ask her. She probably will.
Luna!
“Oh merlin. . . . . . .yes, come on baby. . . . . . . bring me the pretty squid.”
Account Manager
It can wait . . . . . . . All I have to do today is go take a look at things at the Creepy . . . . . . . . . for the . . . . . .
Maybe. I can ask. His new housemates are moving in today. Not sure if he needs to be there for that or not? We’re going out on Friday night. Proper date and everything. Dinner, movie maybe.
“Oh no.”
Naw. It’s fine. I’m glad you asked me. Gareth is awesome. He’s arranged for some of the kids in Lucy’s age group to come back for the summer sessions.
Alright I’m on my way. Sean will be busy in here for quite a while anyway.
Dude. Are you okay with this?
Dinner? Want me to take you out somewhere? We could do London.
I know it’s irrational.
We’ll just have to try again another day.
—————————————————————————
How are the dragons???
I will do that!
6: Hugo
“Oh crap what about the fountain pools?”
“Come on Uncle Graycie, you too. Get some fresh air.”
_____________
Yeah, for you it is. I haven’t done it and I want one for the Family Dinner so everyone can go on there and coordinate what they want to bring, or come over and cook. That way we’re not stumbling over ourselves trying to do it last minute.
“Alright so far I don’t appreciate it. At All. It’s Fucking Ugly. It looks like a tomb. I don’t think cleaning it up is going to make it any better?”
“No. Let’s do this one again first. Just don’t let go of my fucking hand, Jamie. It’s almost like flying.”
“Figure out a time. Meet up at Grayson's next door?”
Have Jerry do it. Name the playground after your Grandmother. They all know who she was.
UGH. Perfect.
“Because if it didn’t work out we have the alternative lined up. We could tell them that it’s just temporary for a couple days while we get them moved to the next foster homes.”
It’s got to be something good. Think hard. I know it’s difficult for you.
“HA! . . .ewwww, just no.”
“What if it’s an emergency?”
“I love it.”
“That tea room is an abomination.”
After a very long day the mission was complete. A completely transformed building had emerged from the rubble that was once not only an eyesore, but a historical stain on the neighbourhood. Everyone involved was very impressed with the results.
“That’s the box the bugs came in but it’s all cru . . . . oh.”
“I’ll get to work on that back production area today. I need to get the work tables and equipment ordered.”
Pout (with batting eyelashes emoji?). . .??
And my parent’s. I’m telling your Grandparents. Both sets!
I get that. Well, we have to get you over. Soon?
“I can walk to the freaking garden. I can do that for sure.”
“Did you just stick your tongue out at me like a child?”
“YOU can’t book them . . . . . Phil and Danika will play all the insane dance tracks they’ve been crushing our ratings with. I can book them.”
Account Manager
WOAH!
=Me (Luna).
K, I’ll do that once we’re done here?
“Don’t be. Go, Potter.”
It’s relatively inexpensive. You may choose to keep it. It also pays your television licensing fee.
——————————————————————————
Can I add a couple people to the balcony?
“Medieval?”
So there you have it. They get their surprise after all!
“That was AMAZING!! Oh merlin . . . . . ”
Cannaught Park?
“Ha! Help me with those blueberries? We’re making white wine poached pears with blueberry sauce.”
Mr. Jordan likes your biscuits.
“Okay, time for bed Jon? I think there’s some tooth brushing and story reading to be done.”
“Where’s my orange fizzy!?”
Install window bank on north wall with window seat spanning length.
Albus S. Potter and Scorpius H. Malfoy
“I’ll tell you what. . . . . Use the Ravenclaw thing as a trial run for the potion convention. Pitch it to Grayson that way.”
Kids chat and catch up.
“You’re probably right, but I didn’t.”
“You’re like Uncle Dec! You’ve got a nice frame.”
“ . . . . ”
HARRY YOU ARE NOT DRIVING THESE CARS!
“Ready?”
“Potter, why aren’t you using your cooling charm?”
Excellent! I’ll do it.
“Let me try something. . . . . .Yep works. I just thought “goodbye mixer”. Much easier to remember!”
Now I feel like a total idiot.
She’ll give others a ride too if they want . . . . .
“You’ll have to show me how to back out?”
“You’ll just have an experienced person to hang out with you for a while and give you tips. I have the perfect candidate.”
“Woah.”
Yes. I know how to clean. I even own a wand.
No problem!
We show up?
“Yes.”
Done. Our beautiful Mr. Jordy is on her way.
Give them this one. I’m aching to see it too, but let Dad and Draco have this part of the surprise. At least we know what it’s going to be mostly.
“Who?”
“That’s the draught talking.”
“Care to spill?”
“Yes by memory. We need something to place them in.”
Probably true. Before your time, my opinion was listened to. Usually I was just laughed at, but I had an opinion. I’ve stayed on the Wizengamot to honor my family, much like yourself I would think. I could not let the likes of Brunhilde Aspreng force me out. In my generation my views, much like those of Alicia Ogden were considered radical or unrealistic. Today I feel a bit of vindication, I didn’t hear even a chuckle. Those wand laws are fucking bullocks.
The one with the three colored twisty noodles and artichoke hearts?
“Clearly that’s not something we speak about in front of delicate company. So for our purposes you are considered Brothers.”
I’d still like Louis to go back down to the Perverell vault, but I want something done with the Elf heads first. I’m certainly never going down there until there’s a solution. How many are there really? That thing just says “uncounted”. And why? Just WHY?
“You aren’t defined by things like who you love, or who you’re attracted to or any gender . . . . .
Good morning! It’s an exciting day.
Do you like the Ogon?
“We’ve always loved them.”
“I was very impressed with those robes. Do you still have them? Mother has mine.”
“Alright Decram we’re all set. Come on through to the portrait.”
“Hermione?”
——————————————————————————
We should probably go over some of the scheduling and specifics.
I need to contact Kreacher. He’s still magically bound to the property and I need him to help the goblins with the opening and restoration rituals.
“I don’t cook. I eat, you're silly!”
It’s cute. And comfortable.
“I like him more than just a lot. . . . and we’ve decided to go on some dates. . . .
“Bravo HARRY!”
“The fuck? Where’s the candy?????”
“We create theatre. Like Ginny and I did in Scotland. It will be FUN!”
“Yes, you’ll just have to wait.”
LOL YOU BACK.
“You’re jacket sir . . . . and your cap.”
(See the end of the chapter for
weird. Too bad you didn’t speak French though, Potter. Those Beauxbatons boys were cute.”
“NO. Your Auntie Luna says if we want to take tomorrow off from school she’ll excuse it. She didn’t cancel it.”
Does Al know about this?!
“OH. They’re so pretty.”
“Very nice.”
“Alright, this time I'm really heading to the Creepy.”
Floo to my office for three minutes then you can head back home and we can continue this conversation with your Uncle.
“Biscotti. Grampa Draco made those.”
“Does this mean?”
If I may? The Wizengamot only has one expense that I’m aware of and that’s a running tab at the Cloud Room for Brunhilde’s after meeting drinks club.
“Much better. Okay instead of pulling into the courtyard let’s go around again and this time we’ll go through the first intersection. Full stop Harry. And look left and right for oncoming traffic.”
“Mr. Granger-Weasley has passed my driving instruction class with a score of A for adequate.”
“Beautiful photos.Where did these come from?”
“I brought mine to Hogwarts. Hung it centre inside the bed. Reminded me of home when I needed it. Gave me something to gaze at and relax when things got too stressful. It’s not just a baby thing. Do you remember mine?
“Oh yes . . . . . . Give me my Granddaughter . . . . . .”
Hello my love.
“You and me and a fountain. Some fish and a few frogs. Pretty flowers too.”
Of course.
Peverell Vault (1) - claimed/unused/no activity. This Vault contains the consolidation of the original Peverell, Slytherin, Morrigan, Sayre, Gaunt and Linfred of Stinchcombe Vaults. It is the largest Vault in the Gringotts inventories. The contents include: multiple artifacts and furnishings, Family heirlooms, 14 libraries, approximately 1337 jewelry collections, 18 potions laboratories in stasis condition, 1(12th century-12,345 unit) magical seeds collection, and, we unfortunately must advise: uncounted preserved house elf heads. It should be noted and Gringotts can only confirm that the contents of this Vault date back to the year 1014. Many of the artifacts likely date earlier. All contents dated 1014+
I don’t mind. Your choice.
I’m looking through some more papers here, hold on.
“I had some trouble with the wallpaper from where those portraits had been hung, but I’m pleased with the result.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Brick are here.”
Here we go.
Draco?
“There are going to be photographers, Potter!”
“Do you really think that’s the way to go?
“I can’t wait!”
She’s not available. I tried to contact her earlier and received a mechanical reply.
Harry Potter and Draco L. Malfoy
HA! Trandy was easy. We just replicated the wedding suits and my staff went completely mad over him. Zebb got into it over the hem length first and then it escalated.
“Oh thank Merlin.”
Could we?
“These sheets are not compatible with chocolate and green frosting. . . . . . . . . Ugh, Potter.”
“A very mild tickling jinx to the foot! It will now pass away quickly!”
“And I want you to give the Minister permission to do with the information as she sees fit. She’s not going to be happy about it.”
Mr. Hawkworth and Ms. Ogden?
Can I get you to run back over to your place for a minute? I’m down in the park with Jerry. We’re on the back side of your townhouse. Go down to the basement?
“They’re planning their reunion or whatever.”
“I DO NOT UNDERSTAND! Why the hell did he never play pro?”
Okay so now that we know you’re set up I’m going to go into the other group. It’s just Al & Scorp, Ted & Jamie and Rose. You remember right?
“I don’t like all of these portraits. They creep me out.”
“Yes.”
“Let’s do that.”
Mr. Kreacher casts the first Confingo, Bombarda or the hex of his choosing. I’m teaching him my best and he’s using the wand of Sirius Black with permission from the Minister. The Black Sisters have second opportunity and I’ve got a surprise myself if they’re unsuccessful.
Ahhh no. As you can clearly see we have another issue to address.
Oh hell.
“True.”
You’ve seen it?
“Grampa Harry we need help!”
See you in a few Draco!
I’ll give it seven.
I can tell you that Al is in a panic. I talked with him about it just yesterday.
Blaise will like it.
Okay.
“What else.”
“Something from the cart dears?”
——————————————————————————
OMG. THATS AWFUL! Why didn't they just build a fucking fence! They could have just roasted the fucking goat! Or even maybe made chèvre? WTF???
“I can fold the napkins. I’ll make them look just like Great Aunt Cissa’s.”
Always. OK. I can’t do this anymore. I’m closing the office and heading home. It’s late enough in the day. I’ll clean up a little and see you there!
“Do you care? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”
Yes. We actually like him.
“That one is mine. Beach in Barcelona. When we stayed at Casa Milà.”
Owl Post to:
Moving on then, Part three:
“How did you know that Draco was the one for you?”
“May I see your list of choices?”
Yes. I’m ready. You get yourself together and over to Grimmauld. I’ll contact Hugo for you and meet you there.
With or without the sidecar? Sirius never used the sidecar. I’ve only attached it to give the kids a ride a few times. I’ve got photos of me riding it with the kids. I think you're in a few of them too. We could show some of those with it.
I just did.
Do you know if there were there any notes left from McCull?
“I know you don’t like to talk about this stuff. Skip it if you don’t want to.”
“Sign on the dotted line!”
Why would they do that? He was ready to go to work for the public defenders office!
Mr. Jordan
18:30 fish!
“MOTHER!”
Oh good!
What then?
So you’ve been basically living together for years. And something else people don't know is how much your own kids adore Draco. I’d venture to say it’s been longer than 15 though, by a few.
Don’t judge us. We’re actually having fun. And yes. . .we could hear the fucking whatever that disaster was outside even from down here! You know this is going to be in the muggle papers tomorrow. Probably on the TV news.
Stop being paranoid.
(See the end of the chapter for
I don’t know about you guys, but the whole first bit, the colour was all fucked up. It fixed itself after the totally fake tornado thing.
In one room among the guest quarters you will find my true folly, a crafts room with a weaving loom. I am terrible at it. I will never be able to tell you why I decided to try weaving.
“Trandy has it under control.”
She’s going to make them sit in a classroom at the school for an entire weekend and lecture them on how to be professionals! It’s going to be hilarious. I told her to seat them in the 7 year old's room. The one with the tiny desks. She's going to make them write an essay, on old school parchment and everything.
“This is so damned unfair!”
Whatever they want. Leave it up to them. What’s Davey like then?
“So I guess I’ll just . . . .”
I don’t get that either Rose. A tiara would just get lost up there.
“Me either. . . . . another Matisse, Man Ray and Maurice Estève, yes we’ll take those along. I used to like this Renoir but I think it’s too fussy for the house.”
What?
“I SWEAR I had NO idea!”
“So you see what I’m up against.”
“What’s your suggestion other than showing your final temper tantrum? How does that tell a story?”
“It’s very large. A few deciduous trees wouldn’t hurt.”
“It’s glitter, Severus.”
Rose has a camera.
I love your sign. Nice to meet you.”
SM: LEADING THE WITNESS AGAIN!
_____________
I’ve got some really nice Hibiscus in my greenhouse at home?
“Yes. Please take it. Keep them together.”
He just spends the night it's nothing to do with sex. He's always a welcome houseguest.
Hello.
“I know you like them too.”
It does!
I knew that’s where this was going. I’ll check with Jamie first but all roads lead to yes. They’ll be very excited.
And Scorp and Al and Aspen and Teddy and Jamie.
“Want to know something cool?”
Agree with Teddy. Don't jinx it!
“Hey there.”
“Truth or DARE! FOUR EACH!”
“He chose this year for you and made sure it was before the explosion but after the closing of the conservatory. I’m sure of it. He chose a time with Miss Irma’s last renovations and so you can make this conservatory your own. He knows you.”
“Fine.”
They are pleasantly surprised with the gesture. I brought in the pamper team. Perfectly appropriate for the dinner. Not too extravagant. Even Rose is excited now. Francois and Vincent did an amazing job. Jocelyn did her relaxing facials, neck massage and manicures all around. Completely spoiled them all.
"That poor turkey carcass"
“Oh, yes of course!”
Stand between number 10 and number 14. On the sidewalk you look down. There’s a tiny metal rune embedded in a crack in the sidewalk. I’m looking at it now.
Headline 1:
Parents head to the Leaky.
Hiply
Hugo Arthur Granger-Weasley.
“Well the jumper and denim trouser ensemble is for the event the evening before the wedding.”
Just drop the Weasley. Start your own tradition.
“It’s no wonder he loves it so much.”
AP: It’s just snowballed I’m sure. I’d have thought our Grandmothers would just lock horns and hex it out! But NO. . .They’re apparently now best buddies. . .and even more weird is that they don’t apparently disagree on anything. They’ve even got our dads writing freaking owl letters to the ministry . . .
“I’m going to talk to the professor about his toads? Uncle Harry said there’s no rush, and I’m not supposed to have a pet at the flat.”
“No. I just woke up confused. Shite, did I wake up the boys?”
Jerry Weasley-Linder is performing rituals to expand the ceiling and restore the interior. We’ve got a crew of Goblins replacing the roof. We’ve got Mothers Elf crew finishing and cleaning up the interior. It’s going to be pristine.
“Not really, he said that!?”
“Who do you think the best manufacturer is? He’s going to have to either partner with someone or start hiring.”
Our next vote concerns the Legislation titled: “Repealing the ownership of wand restrictions.”
Owl Post to:
The idiot made a getaway with a fucking balloon.
Louis? How did you convince them to allow it? Where the heck is Draco?
Ready!
I’ll talk with the Chief Warlock and call an emergency meeting. You decide if you want to do it Tuesday evening after the filing or Wednesday morning.
——————————————————————————
“What happened?”
I just know it’s “different” from other portraits.
Okay, We’ll all see you on Thursday then. If you need anything I’ll be at the centre for the most part this week.
REALLY!
Lily? Why?
I’m pretty sure he already does because of me. Maybe not in writing?
Okay GG’s first. Come on over!
Really? You’re not mad?
“We have security.”
“Do you want to go up there?”
“Not yet.”
“So if we walk back to the sundial the house just reappears?”

She’s down there. Getting things together for the morning. She says to be prepared for an edit to our letter depending on how things go first thing.
Very possible. She’s quite something.
Can I interject?
“The connection. I think my dad was my bearer, but there’s no confirmation on paper. Pomfrey never said anything about my dad, but I think that’s how she knew about me and did her tests. Maybe it was a confidentiality issue. We won’t ever know unless Minnie spills, and that’s unlikely. I'll still write her a note and ask.”
