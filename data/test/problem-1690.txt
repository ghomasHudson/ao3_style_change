“Booklists have arrived,” Draco announced, throwing Sarah’s toward her.
Hermione had just received her own copy and her brown eyes widened.
“Ravenclaw tower, he had to do something,” she replied, ignoring the sharp looks her godfathers sent her. “We were just talking about how we would need a distraction – “
Ron apologised to Sarah and Draco for his thoughtless words and they began discussing what Professor Binns had said.
Harry took a deep breath and pinched his nose, reminding himself that she had sought out his help even though he had just landed her brother in the infirmary. The thought made his stomach churn uncomfortably.
“Touch my bed and I’ll shave your head,” threatened Lyra as they walked back downstairs.
“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur. “I never meant for you to have to deal with all of this.”
“You can’t see them?” he said. He was staring directly at the front of the coaches. “They’re pulling the coaches.”
The worst part about the detentions was Angelina’s reaction. She cornered him just as he and Sarah arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast Tuesday morning and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the trio from the staff table.
Lyra grumbled in annoyance but got off the bed. “I knew I should have seduced Harry first,” she said with a huff of breath. “Showed him what a
Sarah dabbed at her eyes and beamed as Draco and Harry walked back down the aisle, holding each other’s hands tightly and waving at the guests. Luckily, the Manor wards kept out any unwanted reporters or admirers, so it was only close family and friends gathered there. The wedding party and guests all dispersed as music began to play and food appeared.
Crowing in triumph, Lyra jumped above him, her slighter weight allowing her to sit precariously on a branch that George couldn’t.
“She’s strong. She’s like Evelyn, she’s fighting through this…”
Sarah felt like she had been punched in the chest. All the air left her lungs as she stared down at her mother’s corpse lying on the ground. She heard someone suck in a sharp breath behind her as Draco’s corpse appeared next to her mothers.
They remained shut in the cupboard-like room for hours at a time. Slowly, the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted.
!” almost lazily.
forest?” said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation. “I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry for Magic permits you certain areas of land – “
Harry’s whistle interrupted them.
The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Sarah estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hemione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out five Extendable Ears and threw one to each of them, all hastily inserting the ends of the flesh-coloured strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.
Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen if before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest. Sarah watched from a window as Madame Maxine descended from the carriage and threw herself into Hagrid’s waiting arms. Meanwhile, a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Sarah was diligently avoiding contact with any of them, Harry sharing her sentiment. They both knew that if any of the officials saw Harry, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts. Sarah knew that Professor McGonagall had already tried getting an answer and that Harry had refused to give one.
“It’s
Sarah saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, “What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween?”
The sunset cast growing shadows all across the large lawn. In the far distance, Sarah saw the steel door which led to the storm shelter Remus used for his transformations. They would have to find somewhere safe for Remus after they relocated – not that Sarah, Harry and Draco would be staying for long. Sarah had already been packing a bag with an Undetectable Extension Charm on it that Hermione had given her. She had everything from essentials to books about every topic she thought might be useful. She knew Hermione had a similar bag packed with her and Ron’s things waiting at the Burrow.
“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man’s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters.
Mrs Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.
“So, I am seeing into his head. He is possessing me.”
“Harry…”
Sarah turned around to see Fleur Delacour hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Sarah could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harnesses. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.
“I don’t want to lead this alone,” Harry said quickly. “I’ll help teach you but I’m not running this by myself.” He turned to Draco with a hopeful expression. “Help me? Please?” he said, looking up at Draco with his big, round, green eyes.
“But you don’t have any equipment…?” Sarah pointed out.
“What are you – ?” Ron started but broke off with a yelp as Hermione elbowed him.
Clearly, Harry’s connection to Sirius as godson was enough for Kreacher’s magic to recognise him as a master, for Kreacher sat up, curled into a ball, and placed his wet face between his knees, rocking backwards and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen.
,” Harry teased, bumping Draco’s shoulder lightly. “Not all of us can be as pristinely clean as
you speak?”
“I know. That’s not the problem,” Harry said sourly. “It’s the principle of the matter. She didn’t trust me – ergo, I’m angry.”
“It was good,” Draco said, his face lighting up. “Professor McGonagall was saying that we may have the possibility of doing apprenticeships after we graduate. I’ve already been trying to convince her to let me apprentice with Professor Snape’s portrait for Potions.”
Lyra nodded; one hand toyed with a longer strand of George’s hair as they continued to look at each other.
Sarah nodded watched as Sirius called Kreacher, Grimmauld Place’s house-elf, and began to fight with him about getting ingredients for lunch.
Hermione quickly intervened.
“Interesting is one word for it,” Harry muttered, running one hand through his thick curls. Draco had made him get a haircut when it reached his chin and now it was cut short on the sides, with a slightly longer section on the top to help cover his scar.
what happened this summer. You and Blaise even went out to grab popcorn.” She flicked Sarah’s feet and added, “Don’t think I have forgotten about that. I’ll dish out my revenge in due course.”
“The Burrow is going to be horrible,” complained Harry. “All he’s going to be talking about is Lavender. And Hermione was supposed to go as well!”
“Honestly?” Draco said. “No. I think my father has too much control over the Committee and the Minister.” He looked sadly toward the entrance. “But at least I tried.”
“Nothing,” Sarah gasped out, closing her eyes tightly as the blade pierced her skin. She bit her lip to stop from crying out as Bellatrix drew a ragged line down her arm.
“As long as I can get out of these clothes soon,” Sarah huffed as she gripped the other end of can. “Harry’s wardrobe really needs an update.”
“Draco…” Blaise warned.
And the doorbell was ringing.
“Yeah, if it wasn’t, Harry would be on the floor,” Draco said casually.
“Mrs Weasley,” Sarah said softly.
As she and George walked toward the sitting room Floo, he suddenly laughed and said, “I’m surprised it took him that long to realise.”
“What about Snape?” Potter asked finally. “You asked him for help.”
Harry looked extremely uncomfortable with that idea.
“Of course they didn’t,” Hermione interjected. Draco shot her a grateful look. “They weren’t in there long enough.”
Sarah turned bright red and shot a Stinging Hex at her boyfriend as everyone in the room descended into laughter or shocked cries of reprimand. Mrs Weasley smacked Fred around the back of the head for his inappropriateness while Mr Weasley stayed suspiciously quiet.
Fred’s laugh echoed on the air even when they were long gone.
And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the gold rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Sarah knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. She hoped that Harry had done his part as she climbed the stairs, her long, black hair rippling behind her.
Draco looked up at the same time as Sarah to see Harry and Fred waiting by the doors of the Great Hall, both chatting and throwing the occasional glance toward the Slytherin table.
“How bad is it?” she asked the mediwitch.
“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said. “Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago…I’m doing a special favour to Dumbledore…One year and then back to my quiet retirement.”
Sarah could say nothing to him.
and staring around at the class. “Not that it matters, but that’s the first time my transformation’s not got applause from the majority of a class.”
Harry jumped in front of his boyfriend and raised his hands.
“What happened between you two?” Ron asked, munching loudly on a chicken drumstick. He yelped loudly as Hermione kicked him under the table. “What?” he asked, rubbing his shin.
Harry’s glower dropped and he fought back a smile.
“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now…to our new students, welcome! And to our old ones, welcome back! Those who wish to play for their House’s Quidditch team, please give your names to your Heads of House. It is also my pleasure to announce that Professor Slughorn has agreed to resume his old post as Potions master.”
take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks…’till he came.”
Miles Bletchley, Slytherin’s Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer to Ron.
“He’s not!” Sarah said. “We were with him all night! And he’s repeatedly said he
“Harry, don’t go picking a row with Crabbe, don’t forget, he could make your life difficult for you…” Hermione warned.
Harry didn’t stop until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.
He pulled out a folded copy of the
on Harry. Sarah glanced at Draco who suddenly looked as if he had just eaten something sour.
, Draco!”
Pansy didn’t respond and Lyra glanced over at her. The other girl’s hair was limp and her face was wan.
“Hey Harry,” he said. “You’re looking a bit pale. Are you feeling okay?”
They made it downstairs twenty minutes later. Sirius, George and Draco openly smirked at them as Harry stepped forward to pat down Sarah’s hair.
Harry, Draco and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster’s chair was empty.
“Because I like you!” Cho said. “And you seemed to like me last year! I know that whatever you have with Malfoy isn’t going to last – everyone knows that. There’s no way someone like him could ever be with you.”
of doing more.”
“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d rather I
“What about the adoption centre?” he asked urgently. “Are they okay?”
“I’m your boyfriend,” he said in a tone which indicated it should be obvious, “it’s practically in my job description.”
“When was it lost?” asked Harry.
“Good luck, guys,” Sarah said sincerely to the Durmstrang students.
“Where’s Draco?” Blaise asked, placing a hand on Lyra’s shoulder. “I saw Theo leave earlier but haven’t seen the others – “
Harry blushed but didn’t reply. He pulled Sarah onto his bed and closed the curtains behind them.
“Maybe you shouldn’t cheat on your girlfriends and you wouldn’t be left alone?” suggested Pansy, sliding into the seat beside Theo.
” Sarah repeated, but Hermione shot her a warning look; apparently she was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition.
“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s get going, then, George, Sarah.”
“What did you want to tell us, Mother?” Draco said, shooting Harry a sharp look as the other man went to open his mouth to surely make an inappropriate comment. “Your letter was quite vague.”
“I hate this, you know,” Lyra told Po –
“Oh, ha, ha, Blaise,” Sarah said, pulling the taller boy into a hug and ruffling his short hair. “Missed you, too.”
“Are you okay?” he asked softly.
“He’s not out, is he?” said Sarah, who was shivering under her cloak.
“No,” Draco said. “He’ll come out of it on his own.”
A subheading:
Sarah scoffed. “
“Harry,” Sarah said in disbelief, “Why are you embarrassed? You’re
Harry bolted toward them.
Ron’s eyes followed Harry’s and widened when he saw the blond man sitting nearby.
“But we don’t fit – “ Hermione said.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Crabbe called in his sneering drawl. “Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a mouldy old log like that?”
Harry ran up to his dormitory to collect his firebolt while the others fell into the comfy seats around the fire.
“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome – the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you  - Dimitrov!”
“It’s you, isn’t it?” she asked quietly.
Sarah let out a long groan and tugged at his hair so that he raised his head.
“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons – “
“The Forest of Dean,” Hermione answered. “I came camping here once with my mum and dad.”
Hagrid had raced over was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get to Crabbe, who had run back to the fence.
“I’m a growing boy, I need my sustenance.”
Harry blushed a dark red and quickly made his excuses to leave.
“I think I’ve heard enough,” he declared, getting to his feet. “I’m going to go home where I don’t have to listen to anyone tell me completely ludicrous allegations!”
“I’m telling you, I saw him!”
“Well, time’s ticking on,” said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. “George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we’ll be seeing you all later.”
Sarah ignored Dumbledore giving instructions to Snape – the Potions Professor sweeping out of the ward like a giant bat – and instead, focused on the feeling of Fred brushing her hair back.
Draco choked on a suppressed laugh and turned away before the Transfiguration Professor could notice.
As the days went by, Sarah and Harry began to look out for any sign of their friends. It wasn’t until the last day of the holidays that they got lucky.
Now, it was after dinner and Blaise still hadn’t left the hospital wing. Draco had promised to stay with him as long as he could, but Pomfrey wouldn’t risk everyone else staying.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Potter,” she snapped, grabbing his arm and dragging him away from all the curious eavesdroppers, “not
They each extended their right hands. Umbridge took them in her own. Sarah repressed a shudder as she touched her with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings.
Harry filled Draco in on what had happened to Katie as the common room slowly began to fill up. Ron and Hermione appeared and Harry had to repeat his story. By this point, Sarah was dozing quite comfortably against Draco and didn’t notice how much time had passed until she was being shaken awake.
Harry remained quiet but his shaking subsided. He sighed into her hair. “I might forgive him…in time, I mean…and after he’s done sufficient grovelling,” Harry admitted. “He’s a good friend – an absolute idiot and git at most times…but a good friend.”
shouted Sarah, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Sarah’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all.
He was propped up next to Draco against a tree as the blond read. Ron was lying across Sarah’s legs as she tried to braid sections of his hair.
Sarah laughed.
“Harry, we already told you we want nothing to do with it. We shouldn’t even know where you’re doing it!” Draco cried.
shouted a sudden voice and Neville’s legs began to dance violently in a frenzied tap, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again.
. Just, every second she’s latched onto me. I never thought I’d miss homework but I do!”
Snape peered at her, unimpressed. “Despite your lack of manners, Deaumont…” He glanced pointedly at the door she had left open. A flick of his wand slammed it close. “A scheduling clash occurred, if you must know.”
Harry’s green eyes filled with fire and he clenched his fists tightly at his sides. “Don’t call it that!”
“I’ve had an idea,” Hermione said, gazing into space. “I think I know…because then no one would be able to see…even Moody…and she’d have been able to get onto the window ledge…but she’s not allowed…she’s
“He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course – “
Fred smiled sheepishly and wrapped his arms around her. “I just assumed you were using charms,” he admitted, pressing a quick kiss to her lips.
“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. Of course,” she added broodingly, “that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.”
“Mm’kay,” Theo said sleepily. “G’night.”
“There’s some awkwardness here,” Luna stated dreamily. “I think I’ll be leaving now. Goodbye, everyone.”
Lyra muttered something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like “
“Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies and Care of Magical Creatures. I also want to try the Ancient Studies extra-curricular but I need to make sure that Quidditch won’t clash with it,” said Sarah, reading off her list.
“Why are you so mean to me, Lyra?” whined Pansy.
“You know my father?” Sarah said in astonishment.
Sarah hummed in thought. “Did he ever fully explain what he wanted to teach you?” she asked.
Harry snorted.
“You’re crude, Lyra,” Draco grumbled, even as his brain was assaulted by the image of him and Potter shagging – no, he wouldn’t let himself think about that. “I do not want to shag Potter.”
”, under his breath.
“I’ll be sure to mention that to him,” Sarah promised.
She had slapped Crabbe across the face with all the strength she could muster. Crabbe staggered. Sarah, Draco, Harry, Ron, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.
“Sounds like marching,” someone else replied.
Halfway across the square, however, Hermione stopped dead.
Mr and Mrs Weasley had retreated to the kitchen while the twins had disappeared to their room, leaving the others alone.
Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Colour flooded Fred’s pale face.
“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again.
“Ugh, Blaise, I do
Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep.
and a school,
Sarah choked on her drink in surprise. “Of course, Harry,” she said, coughing. “You’re more than welcome whenever.”
Lockhart seemed to have gotten over his fear of Sarah after the Quidditch game and gleefully drew her and Draco up to the stage.
Harry gaped blankly at her.
“Umbridge’s detention,” Sarah said, straightening her spine and staring Draco down. “She made us write lines using blood quills.”
“I just want Draco to wake up,” Lyra whispered. She rested her hand on Draco’s arm, a slight sheen of sweat coating it. He sucked in a breath and turned his body towards hers slightly in response.
“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?”
“I would be honoured to be his big sister!”
Hermione’s eyebrow twitched but she managed not to smile.
A cold smile curved her lips.
Sirius let out his bark of laughter and clutched his stomach. Remus was trying very hard to contain the smile that was tugging at his lips. When Sarah turned her glare onto him, he raised his hands and said quickly, “I had nothing to do with this. I was just planning on sitting you down and talking.”
Mr Weasley flushed darker than Ron or Ginny.
“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits…I just wish I’d understood Dumbledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on – Ollivander now.”
Sarah’s stomach turned over. Fenrir Greyback had stalked up behind her and was running one long fingernail across her cheek. The stench of his breath nearly made her gag.
“Harry, what is it?” Draco asked worriedly.
!” Get off, you stinking cat – “
“NO!”
Pansy succumbed again to tears, releasing all the pent-up frustration and pain within her.
to fly!” continued Mrs Weasley’s rant.
“Hey, you’re not alone this time,” Sarah said, poking Harry in the cheek. “Besides, I’d say that Draco and I are the odd ones out, considering how we’re usually outnumbered by
“Nasty little thing,” he replied, shrugging the coat on. “I could never understand why she adopted it in the first place.”
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.
Sarah couldn’t bring herself to repeat what Ernie and the Hufflepuffs had said, and neither could Harry it seemed.
“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he sneered. “Weasley, you can partner with Finnigan, Potter – “
“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and when Mum calls us down for breakfast, we’ll tell her what we did. And hopefully, she’ll be too distracted by Harry’s presence to kill us.”
Sarah looked at Fred in disbelief. “
“Why not?” Remus said, frowning.
“How did it offend you?”
“Are you staying tonight, Hermione?” Sarah asked excitedly. She was ecstatic that she had her best friends surrounding her once again.
“Right, sorry, Gin,” Sarah apologised. “He really is fine.”
“Do you know why we got cars?” Sarah asked Harry as they clambered into the enlarged internal space.
“So Miss Deaumont,” one of the Ministry officials said as the first course came to an end, “I hear you’ve just completed your Healer’s course at St Mungos.”
Ron scoffed from the armchair across from them.
Sarah nodded. “We’ll meet you guys in the Three Broomsticks in a bit,” she said to the others as they left the quill shop.
“We’ll save him, Harry,” Sarah said as they raced through the undergrowth. “We have to.”
“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their own head, incapable of a single cheerful thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.”
a monster, Remus,” she practically growled. “You may be acting like an absolute
Lyra hadn’t yet forgiven the other girl for how she had acted when Harry told her he wasn’t interested in pursuing a relationship with her. Apparently, they had gotten closer during sixth year but Harry had been adamant with his decisions. Ginny hadn’t taken it well. She had screamed at him loud enough to draw Lyra and Draco down from their rooms, with the twins arriving just in time to see the redheaded girl slap Harry full across the face and call him a “self-righteous bastard who never thought about anyone other than himself.”
Sarah spent most of her time in the Slytherin common room surrounded by Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Millicent. She had quietly told them what happened in the graveyard, Theo’s eyes going wide when his father was mentioned.
“It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!”
Unsurprisingly, it was Hermione who first figured out that Lyra and George were now dating. The unexpected part of it was that apparently, she had connected the dots after an observation from Ron.
Lyra was sitting with Draco beneath their tree near the lake when the Golden Trio approached them. Draco still looked slightly trepidatious at the knowledge that Gryffindors were willingly attempting to
“Such attitude,” Voldemort snarled, “I think I know how we can remedy that.” Voldemort smiled cruelly down at her and backed away.
“Well, that’s because Pansy is your teacher,” Draco pointed out, reclining against the couch next to Harry. “Anyone would struggle with her teaching them.”
Sirius sighed heavily. “And I’m guessing you can’t tell us.”
“When was that?” Sarah asked. Rita Skeeter had written a horrible article about Hagrid months ago about being a half-giant. It had caused him to try to resign. She had been a bit preoccupied with the issue with Ron and the second task to remember too much about it.
“What the
Sarah hummed noncommittally before getting ready for bed, a thousand thoughts clouding her mind.
“Fuck off, Nott or you’ll never have children,” Pansy replied sweetly. “Now hurry along, you overgrown ratbag.”
Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.
“Harry Potter used Gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman continued. “He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely own.
“Parents,” said Harry quietly, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless – unless they’ve got to.”
“Do you want to be partners?” Sarah asked Luna, who looked delighted.
“It’s not your fault, Leanne,” Sarah said. “Did she say who had given it to her?”
Sarah added a few more robes to the stack: a lovely dark navy with black lining, deep emerald with silver lining (“To embrace your inner Slytherin,” Sarah winked), a burgundy which Sarah thought would match Harry’s hair, and a deep gold pair.
“Doesn’t stop the discomfort,” murmured Fred in her ear.
“Morning, Louise!” called another witch in aubergine robes as she let herself into a cubicle by inserting her golden token into a slot in the door. “Such a pain, isn’t it? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?”
“He sent for some teachers and then got Hagrid to bring me back here,” Harry replied, “Madam Pomfrey should be looking after Viktor now to make sure he’s okay.”
“Great,” Draco mumbled. “I had nearly successfully forgotten about the twin terrors.”
werewolf – “
“Mr Potter,” said Umbridge, “let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr Potter…Where is Sirius Black?”
The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Remus and Sirius’s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Sarah thought she was the only one who had noticed this, until she saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.
“I have news,” he announced, “and you won’t like it.”
“I agree with Sarah,” Hermione stated. “I wouldn’t trust it, even if it
She nodded. Fred wrapped his arms around her tightly, resting his head on top of hers.
Draco turned his back on the Minister and sat down beside Sarah, calmly taking her hand again.
“You’re so romantic I may just fall for you here and now,” Lyra deadpanned.
“I just don’t want to lose you,” he whispered. “I don’t know what I’d do.”
Harry barely bit out a warning before he was coming between them, his body shaking with shudders of pleasure. Draco let out a low sound and stiffened, holding Harry close as his own orgasm hit him. When his body had stopped trembling, he pulled out and collapsed limply beside Harry.
“I thought you were coming back with me,” Draco said, slightly sadly.
“Because ‘e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
Fred smiled down at her before reaching into his back pocket and pulling out a small wrapped box.
“I have to go,” Sarah said suddenly. She stood up from the table and left the Great Hall, leaving Draco looking worried and flabbergasted behind her.
“Minister?” Draco said, stepping forward and slipping into his ‘polite pureblood’ mask. “If I may? Are you here for the hippogriff’s appeal?”
Sarah immediately straightened and sucked in a harsh breath.
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,” he told Sarah under his breath.
“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia Spinnet, one of the Chasers.
“Lead me to the weapon,” she said.
“Oi, stop looking like a statue,” Lyra shouted at him, effectively drawing his eyes away from Harry’s grinning face. “Come help us, you lazy arse.”
.” She descended into uncontrollable giggles; the wine obviously having taken effect.
“Is it true you’re staying home for the holidays, Deaumont?” Crabbe sneered, drawing the attention of the surrounding students. “Daddy don’t want you home?”
Harry’s shout had awoken the other boys in the dorm as well as Sarah. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.
like that she’d have been running as fast as she could in the opposite direction.
Thank you to everyone who was been leaving kudos and commenting, I appreciate all of you so much, you lovely people! I hope you enjoyed this one, I think it's a personal favourite.
“It makes sense,” Sarah muttered, rubbing her forearm absently. “Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in there. She was petrified we had taken something You-Know-Who would find out about.”
“Not the time, love,” she said. Fred flew alongside Alicia’s other side and Sarah reached out a hand to steady her.
“Hermione, I don’t think that is going to help you get the boys back,” Draco commented lightly as they made their way to the Gryffindor stands. “If anything, it may make Ron angrier at you.”
“Mind your own business,” he snapped at the curious eyes watching him as he passed.
“We have to clean up at least,” Draco told him.
“Am I what?” Harry asked evasively, picking at the napkin next to his hand.
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna’s magazine. Sarah gagged as she lowered her arms. She and Ginny had managed to cover themselves enough so that the foul liquid only coated their hair and laps. But Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure.
“What do you mean?” Harry deflected, avoiding eye contact.
“It also means I’ll be able to patch you boys up when you inevitably get hurt,” she said, smirking.
Sarah released him before turning to Ron, who gave her an equally tight hug. Draco put his arm around her waist once Ron released her and held tightly as they made their way to the Gryffindor table. Sarah saw that Ron had an arm around Hermione’s shoulder, as if making sure she was still there. Sarah looked around to see the other victims greeting their friends with equal enthusiasm as she sat comfortably next to Draco, who stubbornly refused to release her.
She just grunted and banged her head on the table a few times.
“Missed me already?” she teased, climbing onto the bed and crawling until she hovered over him.
“Draco’s in Gryffindor Tower,” Fred said, turning to face her and placing his hands gently on either side of her face. “He’ll be okay for a little while longer.”
and the Prince’s book, Hermione suddenly said, “You need to be careful, Harry.”
Sarah rested a hand on his shoulder and began tracing patterns absently, enjoying the feeling of Fred’s soft kisses.
Hedwig had also delivered a letter for Harry from Hagrid. It was inviting him and Ron to tea.
“Do not be angry, mon cheri,” she trilled. “Ignore zat ‘orrid woman – today is a day of ‘appiness and love.”
“I heard about Draco, how is he?” he asked Sarah, placing an arm around her shoulders.
Harry drank in every word Draco was saying but his eyes remained haunted.
“I wasn’t going to say anything,” he drawled, a smirk twisting half of his thin lips. He moved out of the way, allowing the pair to pass.
The dark-haired boy turned around quickly at Lyra’s shout, eyes darting across the entrance hall to locate her. She glided through the crowd, coming to a stop in front of the three Gryffindors. Granger was watching Lyra with a shrewd expression, whilst Weasley was outright glaring.
“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs Longbottom. “I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?”
“Chin up, Coco. It’s just Harry,” Lyra said with a smile as Draco stalked over to the only free seat.
“I can’t seem to get him alone,” Harry sighed.
This did not mean, however, that he was comfortable with the newfound ‘friendship’ which Lyra had imposed upon him.
Sarah raised a dark eyebrow at Draco, who blushed slightly but looked away.
“Kreacher if cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black – “
“Yes, you are.”
taint the image of who he
“So he presented you with this, probably rambled on about how you didn’t have to accept it, and then you told him you love him?” Sarah guessed.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of
he was enchanting it to make it
“I do,” said Remus firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. The “Boy Who Lived” remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.”
“Maybe he just didn’t hear me,” Sirius said in an uncertain tone.
Tonks nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate. Sarah thought she heard the faintest
Hermione gave her a disapproving look and Draco quickly said, “Well, come on…we’d better get started…”
“But your friends knew and that’s different.”
Harry frowned. “Now that I think about it, I have been distancing myself slightly,” he said. “I thought it was because I was tired and everyone else still thinks I’m a liar.”
the smile on his face.
“ – Snoracks?”
Remus frowned but Draco spoke before he could.
“Are you both all right?” he asked worriedly.
“Ronald, that was not the reason why!” Hermione tutted.
Crabbe leaned away, smirking over his shoulder at them.
“This
“Malfoy’s arm still isn’t fully healed,” Flint said. “We’d be at a disadvantage.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco, who hid his smirk behind his glass of wine. “I never said anything of the sort.”
“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I understood my own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?”
“Mind if I cut in?”
“Hun, you are really on a roll today,” Sarah beamed at the other girl.
They walked off, leaving behind the dumbstruck faces of Harry and Draco, the gossiping forms of Lavender and Parvati, and Ron with his strangely blank expression.
“Is there much alcohol in this?” Sarah asked, taking another sip.
“I know more than you ever will, Deaumont,” he said cruelly. “I just hope that you are all smarter than your parents.”
“Harry’s boggart turns into a dementor,” Professor Lupin explained, looking at them curiously. “That means it will be a great help to us tonight – You and I just need to stay out of its line of sight, Sarah.”
,” she muttered.
Mrs Weasley bustled into the room, a basket of washing tucked securely on one hip.
“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature: Pals of Potter.”
“Two years ago,” said Draco, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?”
“Sarah, be quiet, I can hear someone!”
Draco, who had heard her words, gave her the finger as he continued to snog Harry.
Sarah had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Draco, Pettigrew and Ron went next, awkwardly hobbling sideways. Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, help up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione followed behind them and Sarah and Lupin brought up the rear.
“It’s none of your business! Leave us alone!” Draco shouted, drawing his wand.
“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,” he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. “I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.”
“Dumbledore,” Lyra replied flatly. “You want me to go to the man that I am supposed to
“What is young Master wanting now?” muttered Kreacher.
“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” Tonks said. “Arthur won’t want too many visitors at once…It ought to be just the family first.”
“Merlin, this reminds me why I hate reporters,” Sarah muttered loudly as Rita’s eyes lit up. Draco snorted across from her as Rita shot Sarah a harsh look.
Sarah had just gone downstairs for dinner when she saw Amanda and Tom talking in hushed whispers in front of one of the private rooms. Amanda beckoned her over when she saw Sarah.
Sarah edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves. She could not hear anything nor see the slightest sign of movement.
“He doesn’t have a choice, Sarah,” Dumbledore said apologetically. “How this situation arose, we do not know. It seems to me that we have no choice but to accept it.”
“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly.
“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.
Hermione and Draco approached him one afternoon as he was studying in the library with Sarah.
“Whatever she’s telling you, you should probably listen,” sneered a new voice.
She shot off back toward the castle and Harry shook his head, laughing jubilantly as he followed her. Even if he did decide that fixing houses wasn’t his thing, Sarah was right, at least he would have tried. And who knows, maybe he would find a love for it one day and would never have to sit another bloody exam ever again.
“I love you both,” she cried before releasing them and turning back to Ron.
Draco nodded and watched her until she disappeared through the door with Fred on her heels.
Fred rolled his eyes fondly at her and said, “Draco talking about getting a drink after this. Apparently, a few of his colleagues were going to celebrate Hermione’s promotion. I asked if you wanted to go.”
Sarah shrugged.
Sarah turned back to the goblin.
“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs – “
“I’m Harry,” said Goyle’s voice.
Sarah summoned it to her and handed it to Draco.
“Don’t worry about it, Ron,” Harry assured him. “I’m pretty sure it’s going to do me more good than you.”
“For good reason,” Draco muttered quietly.
There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.
The crowd gasped in shock and Sarah grabbed Harry’s arm tightly.
“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you see what it looked like?”
Sarah nodded dazedly. Harry, however, smiled so brightly at Draco that the other boy couldn’t seem to do anything but smile in return. Harry then jumped toward his boyfriend and began snogging him so intensely that Sarah looked away. When it looked like the embrace was about to move in dangerous territory, Sarah cleared her throat and they jumped apart.
“I missed you, too,” Fred said, kissing her again.
Like Harry and Ron, Draco had grown a few inches in the holidays, meaning that he now stood nearly a head taller than Sarah.
Lyra screamed for help, the words bouncing around the cavernous room like the spells that had been flying minutes previously. Tears streamed rapidly down her face as she and Potter held their hands tightly over Draco’s mangled torso.
“I – I can’t tell you.”
“Is there anything we can do?” she asked. “I can’t imagine what the last few weeks have been like.”
“Ignore it Harry,” Viktor said, turning his attention away from where it had rested on Hermione for a while. “People vill either love you or hate you. It is just something you have to endure.”
Harry nodded and said, “Of course. Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked that.”
Their group looked up to see Pansy and Blaise standing above them, both looking equal parts amused and bored.
“I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr Weasley brightly, holding out his good arm and giving Ginny a hug. “If they could only take the bandages off, I’d be fit to go home.”
A sudden commotion upstairs made Draco and Luna freeze, the small girl subtly inching closer to Draco’s side. Moments later, a group of people appeared, two figures fighting against the restraints across their wrists and ankles. A Death Eater raised his wand and opened the cell door before shoving the two figures in, one quiet tall and the other extremely short.
Harry nodded sadly.
Sarah tried to move to her own seat at one point, but Fred gripped her hand tighter, turning pleading brown eyes on her. Instead, she settled in his lap and curled one arm around his shoulders, leaning sideways against his chest. His arms came to encircle her tightly.
“Sarah, you can’t bullshit me,” Harry said. “I don’t know if you realise it, but your eyes change colour sometimes based on your emotions. And if you’re especially tired, they go a dark grey.”
Fred scowled darkly. “I’d be right alongside you, mate,” he said. “No one just gets to hurt my girlfriend and get away with it.”
Their dinner passed the same as the one Draco had shared with Harry and Teddy all those weeks ago. Conversation flowed as easily as the wine and any discomfort Harry had stressed over was not evident. Instead, all there was, was Draco’s bright eyes locked onto Harry’s the entire night.
“I bruise easily,” Draco said stiffly. “Besides, I was distracted.”
Harry shrugged and sighed, hugging his knees closer to his chest.
Mrs Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. Despite her appearance, she was absolutely
“I’m sorry, dear,” Umbridge said in a much gentler tone. It made Sarah want to vomit. “Let’s make it just you and me…and we’ll take Potter too, shall we? Get up, now – “
“I think George has rubbed off on her,” he commented. “They’re actually quite good together.”
“Is that the Sorting Hat?” Draco said in delight.
“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.
“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, welcome…so pleased you could come…”
“You know I could have walked down that entire last corridor?” Sarah said, poking Harry’s limp form.
“You’re all allowed to come in now,” she said, hugging him back.
“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry.
“See? I’m fine,” said Draco. He stepped closer to Harry and cupped his face with his hands. “Don’t worry about me.”
Harry groaned. “I thought the whole point of telling people was so that they went and told other people, meaning
“That too,” Luna agreed breezily. “You should have some of Fleur’s quiche. It was quite delicious.”
Sarah vaulted down the steps toward the pitch, pushing people out of her way as she went.
“Er…that’s really not necessary, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said awkwardly, running a hand through his hair. “I mean, I couldn’t just let Lyra and Draco go to Azkaban. And…well…you didn’t tell Voldemort I was alive…”
Draco raised an eyebrow at her and indicated she go on.
Harry beamed and began to explain his plan. It seemed that he wanted to set up a picnic in a small clearing near the lake, one that was surrounded by trees that could be strung with little lights. More House-elves began to join Dobby as Harry got more and more animated. They were all nodding excitedly and promising that it could be done.
Harry finally cracked a smile.
“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. Ron and Harry were working together while Draco had partnered with Hermione. So far, Ron hadn’t managed anything other than a high-pitched whistling noise as he tried his hardest not to mutter the incantation. “Here – let me show you – “
Due to that, Draco began researching with renewed vigour, barely stopping long enough to eat and sleep. On more than one occasion, Sarah had to forcibly drag him away from the library or the common room just to make sure he didn’t collapse from exhaustion.
Harry jumped in the pool to avoid answering.
“Oh I definitely snogged a fifth year,” he said, “just not the one who started the rumour. It was actually her girlfriend I snogged. I didn’t know they were dating at the time – caused quite a bit row apparently.”
Pansy cocked her head at him like a cat watching its prey. “Why, Potter? Scared you’ll have some expectations to live up to?”
“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb!”
“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.
“You literally said it not five minutes ago!” he cried in return.
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin. Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have company when you’re dealing with a boggart. It can get confused. The charm to repel a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart off is
Sarah’s question was cut off when a door suddenly opened at the top of the staircase and footsteps began to descend. Harry and Sarah held their breaths as a balding man passed them. Harry tugged on Sarah’s hand and dragged her up the stairs, slipping through the closing door and emerging behind the counter of Honeydukes.
“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less him as he said it. “I am not a house-elf.”
“And shows how much you care enough to spend the time arguing instead of agreeing.”
“Well, we have to make sure we finish our homework first,” Draco voiced.
“Go try them on,” Sarah ordered, shooing Harry away toward the dressing rooms as she sat on the comfortable seat facing them.
Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire fill of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and the crumbling white-hot logs.
“But you still did,” pressed Sarah. “Please, Professor, I can’t keep listening to myself scream as I find my mother dead over and
“Don’t be a fucking idiot,” she snapped. She looked out across the attic and muttered to herself, “’
“Have you all got dates for the Ball?” Sarah asked curiously as she began to work on her Charms essay.
Draco didn’t smile. “He deserved it,” he said.
“Can you at least tell me why Dumbledore didn’t want me to know anything?” Harry asked the adults.
Reluctantly, Hermione agreed and twenty minutes later found Lyra, Hermione, Millicent and Pansy all waiting in the common room for the boys. Finally, Ron, Harry, Draco and Blaise drifted down the stairs, each with a towel wrapped around their necks and nothing else on but swimming trunks.
The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Sarah’s throat constrict, it reminded her so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves and the twins bellowing rude versions of carols in the halls, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet when he had won in a cracker, of Mrs Weasley’s hand-made sweaters…
“Ah, there you both are,” Bellatrix Lestrange said, stepping forward to caress Lyra’s cheek. “We were wondering where you had disappeared too.”
“Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,” said Alicia Spinnet firmly. “She’s never failed yet.”
“How long has this been going on? Did you know?” Pansy demanded, whirling on Sarah.
In the end, Ginny, Fred and George snapped first and ended up throwing mashed parsnip at Percy, splattering his glasses and causing him to storm from the house, ignoring Mrs Weasley’s desperate cries.
“Excuse you,” Draco said haughtily as Harry snickered beside him. “You are plenty more sadistic than me and we all know it.”
Sarah gaped at him. Her expression was identical to Harry and Draco’s.
“Can you believe that we only have two years left?” Ron asked as he slouched onto the bench in the compartment. “I mean, it feels like yesterday that we were shaking in our boots about to be Sorted.”
“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said Crabbe. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”
There were more duellers all over the stairs and in the corridors leading to the Hall. Soon, Sarah was becoming overwhelmed with the amount of blocking and attacking she was doing, but her rage and grief was fuelling her magic, making it erratic and more powerful; simple spells doubled in quantity and blew Death Eaters off their feet, through walls and windows. A body slammed into her and Sarah only barely managed not to curse them as a familiar face looked down at her.
“I’ll talk to him,” said Sarah determinedly.
before you cause me to have heart failure!”
Sarah’s heart skipped a beat.
“I’m going to – “ gasped Draco, speeding up his hand.
“Take me to your common room,” she repeated, too drained to care that she sounded rude and demanding. “I won’t –
Lyra frowned at him. “But you’ve been doing that for weeks,” she said in confusion. “That was the first part of the plan.”
a match.”
“I have to talk to a few people,” Potter continued. “But I have a house, and it’s empty right now. You and Draco can stay there until everything is over – you’ll be safe.”
“Hermione – wait!” Sarah called before Hermione could sprint away. “I’ll come with you.”
Fred engulfed her in a tight embrace as people began approaching the front to pay their respects. Mrs Weasley nearly suffocated Sarah in her teary hug before turning to her son.
…got to know one another better?” He glanced back at his friends, both of whom were looking slightly uncomfortable but determined. “I mean, we’re all allies now, right?”
Sarah and Harry laughed.
“Erm…” she said. Both Sirius and Remus’s eyes were locked onto hers and she couldn’t find it in herself to lie. “They’re from your dear cousin, Sirius. We ran into her at Malfoy Manor.”
“Crabbe, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall.
They fell asleep much easier this time.
“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. “I don’t suppose you’ve got any new leads?” she added in a whisper so that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t hear her.
Draco hugged her instead of replying. He knew that she meant well but there was no way he would ever be able to tell her what happened. It would include revealing that he was a wizard and effectively breaking the Statute of Secrecy.
“I think we can find some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs who might be interested,” Theo said.
“Look at us,” she laughed quietly. “Two maudlin souls seeking comfort for their lonely lives.”
“They can leave if they really want to,” Draco contradicted him. “Dobby used to leave to warn Harry.”
Harry sulked in faked offence as Draco and Sarah laughed at him.
“What are you doing?”
“Not that it’s any of your business,” she drawled. “But this is what you look like after a good snog with your boyfriend.”
“’Mazing,” said Lee.
“But – but – “ he stuttered.
“Ron, what - ?”
“We didn’t –
Moody picked up the spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Dunno,” Ron said, shrugging as if it weren’t a big deal. “But he didn’t get in trouble, did he? Dumbledore’s letting him enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end of year tests either…”
A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them, as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur and Harry’s night-black hair shone like bronze. Sarah held her breath as two loud voices shrieked, wands raising in the air:
through the rooms and would never dare to ‘
It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs Weasley managed to find them all. Well, all of them except the ones safely hidden in Sarah’s jeans.
“I can be much more creative,” Pansy stated. “Lord Fuckdemort. Lord Dickward. The Dark Fucker. Moldy Snake-face.”
“Mother wants Draco and I to come home for the weekend,” she told Hermione. “Apparently, she is going to contact McGonagall.”
“All except Portuguese,” she muttered bitterly. “Pansy has been trying to teach me for years to no avail. The only thing I can successfully say is, ‘I’m so confused’.”
The Slytherins snickered as Snape stared down at Draco, his lip twitching slightly.
“Over here,” Hermione said, now dragging Sarah down an alley between two shops. “Explain.”
“It’s a type of tiara,” Draco explained. “I got one for Sarah for her tenth birthday.”
“I’m a horrible person,” Lyra groaned, dropping her head into her hands.
“We’ll have to come back then,” Fred said decidedly, absentmindedly rubbing up and down Sarah’s arm with the hand that he had thrown over her shoulders.
They heard an uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted towards the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering round the side of the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: they ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves, and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. A flash of blond caught Sarah’s eye as Draco broke free of Sirius and ran towards Harry, who – who was
The air had frozen: Sarah’s breath caught and solidified in her chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling.
Lyra let out a tinkling laugh and said, “It wasn’t me that took so long.”
“Harry, you left before anyone got the opportunity!” Sarah said in exasperation. “You didn’t look at anyone of us the entire trip back. How on earth were we meant to reassure you that we
She, Blaise, Theo and Millicent had joined their group of five as they huddled in the full room.
Sarah rolled her eyes. “Send them over when they get back if they come here. I was just at Grimmauld.”
Harry said, “
“Well, well, Mr Potter, the whole thing starts with the tale…I have a copy somewhere…”
“Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.
“Fine,” said Harry.
Immediately, the eight of them flew down and disembarked with various levels of grace: Sarah and Ginny jumped off their brooms a foot above the ground and landed calmly on the ground, smiling at the others; Hermione awkwardly fumbled off hers and Bill and Charlie had to each grab an arm to keep her upright; Harry eyed Draco evilly a second before he launched himself at the other boy, causing them both to tumble to the ground; Ron simply touched down and hopped off his broom, shaking his head at the boys tackling on the ground.
“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”
“Ignore him, Hermione,” Sarah said. She pushed Blaise further down the table when he tried to sit in between her and Hermione. “Blaise will flirt with anything that works. It’s amazing his dick hasn’t broken off already because he stuck it in the wrong place.”
“No problem, Sarah,” Tom brushed off her thanks. “Yer mum was a good friend of mine.” He turned away and walked toward the door to leave. “I’ll send up some breakfast in the morn, if yer want?” he offered, light eyes dancing in the flickering light of his wand.
And we are done! The third one is complete but the next few are probably going to take a while, so bear with me loves. I'll try to get the next one up within two weeks xx. Kudos are great if you please, and share it with friends! (If it doesn't suck that is)
The four of them turned around in surprise. Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape were standing on the edge of the crowd. They fought their way over to the pair with difficulty, leaving Ron to be swept up with the rest of the students.
She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.
The moment her eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Sarah’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, greyish-white, against the leaf strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion had fully worn off now and his freckled face was draining of what little colour it had left.
Draco’s scowl deepened at the idea and he shoved his hands further into his pockets, refusing to look at his sister or acknowledge her in any way.
Greg nodded and turned back toward the window, falling into silence once more.
Ron nodded again. “So…are we okay?”
“Shut up, you idiots, or you’ll wake them.”
Draco frowned. “Not even with the She-Weasel?”
“Hello?” Sarah snapped.
“Don’t worry Sarah,” she said brightly. “When we see Fred I’ll tell him you love him.”
“Definitely!” Harry exclaimed. “But how? Dinner’s finished.”
Draco shook his head. “I’ll admit that I was curious,” he answered. “I was sure you would have gone into the Aurors.”
“I just wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Duelling Club,” said Harry earnestly.
But who
“Daphne got a boyfriend and doesn’t want to sleep with Blaise anymore,” Pansy voiced, popping a cherry in her mouth. “He’s devastated.”
“It matter’s not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed great
“I really don’t need you to finish that sentence.”
“Luna?” he asked.
“No, I want to be with the both of you,” Draco interrupted. He sniffed and raised on hand to run a finger down Harry’s jaw. “I don’t want to be alone.”
“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
Potter’s eyes – still the same stunning green colour they had been at school – widened in surprise and he wordlessly gaped at Draco for a few seconds.
“Alright,” Sarah said loudly, passing Teddy over to Harry, “you’ve officially won yourself toddler duty. He hasn’t eaten I don’t think.”
“Sarah and the boys can show you guys to your rooms,” Sirius said as Remus conversed with Mr and Mrs Weasley. “They’re on the second floor, I think.”
“But what about the conversation you mentioned?” Granger continued, directing her question toward Lyra.
“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly.
this afternoon.”
“I honestly couldn’t care less,” Draco said calmly. “If he’s heartless enough to condemn an innocent animal to its death then he bloody well deserves these letters.”
“But – Remus, that’s so dangerous,” Sarah said worriedly. Fred tightened his arm around her as she said, “What if you get hurt? How will we know?”
“You and me both, Granger,” murmured Draco. He was sitting quite stiffly beside Lyra as if he were at one of the various luncheons they had been forced to attend as children.
Draco shook his head at her. “Rosie, you don’t know the stuff I’ve done. To him – to his friends. There’s no way he’d even give me a chance.”
Sarah saw movement in one of the upper windows and hissed, “I think Harry saw us.”
Harry didn’t like that but he nodded anyway.
“You also rescued a goblin?”
“We’re going to use brooms, thestrals and Hagrid’s motorbike,” Moody replied. “Nothing that uses spells.”
“They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on. You too, Sarah.”
” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf which was sitting on his chest. Draco gripped him to stop the other boy from falling off the bed onto Sarah. “Don’t
Ron scoffed and shook his head. “I’m not some charity case,” he spat. “I don’t need you or anyone dipping their hands into their deep pockets.”
“What?” she said innocently, stirring her tea and accepting a kiss from Fred when he appeared beside the table.
Harry rolled his eyes at her. She smiled brightly and leant against his side, relishing the heat radiating off his body.
“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. “He did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now he’s playing them – oh, look, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her, she’s very nice…”
Mrs Longbottom didn’t say anything, just kept staring at them intensely.
Sirius’s mouth tightened further.
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes were patched and frayed. His next lessons were just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed; in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Sarah, Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione.
Sarah looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
“YES!” said Harry loudly.
“I don’t like her,” Draco said, scowling.
“Not dead?” choked Filch. “But why’s she all – all stiff and frozen?”
“You’ve thought of everything,” Sarah said in praise. “Next there’ll be a full body massage and a good snog.”
“It was you, wasn’t it?” Sarah asked. “You were attacked the day of the match as well,” she clarified at Hermione’s confused expression.
“All right,” said Crabbe, looking sulky and disappointed.
“With the amount of work I’m doing, they’re my customers,” Lyra said.
Harry, Viktor and Mila eagerly agreed and dragged a slightly reluctant Sarah, Draco, Hermione and Aleksander with them.
“So?” Hermione said, shrugging. “Not like anyone really cares where the eighth years sit.”
Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: the Summoning Charm had not worked on it.
“That’s only because you made me practice for hours until you were happy,” he grouched, smiling slightly.
“I thought he just liked being put together,” Harry said in a quiet voice.
“Neville, when did you get hot?” Sarah gasped out.
Sirius cursed and stood up. “I keep telling them not to shout because they wake that bloody hag.”
“Never! Wait – Lyra –
And then many things happened at the same moment.
“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole village!”
Theo coughed into his fist and said, “Well, props for spirit, I guess.”
“Then I think it’s time for us to leave, darling,” George whispered in her ear, causing a shiver to run down her spine.
“Talk to him,” she urged. “The two of you just need to clear the air. He’s probably doesn’t even mean to pull away.”
“Beaky!” He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all night!”
” and hurried away; and Professor Babbling refrained from giving them homework for the rest of the week.
Harry looked at them in shock but Sarah could tell him mind was whirring.
Sarah was breathtaking. Utterly breathtaking.
at Sarah and she laughed, waving a hand at him before leaving the hall.
“But we haven’t got any!” said Hermione worriedly.
“If you can’t reverse this, I’ll kill you,” Draco threatened.
“Do not lose these,” Bellatrix hissed.
She only turned back into the conversation when she heard Harry say, “Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol – “
“Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh.
Sarah wrenched her attention away from the stairs and looked down at her arm and saw, to her horror, that she had pushed up her sleeves, revealing the scars left by Bellatrix.
“It’s obviously the merpeople,” Draco said. “What?” he asked when Harry looked at him in shock. “Everyone knows that they can’t speak above the water.”
“It’s not something that comes up in daily conversation, Ronald,” Draco drawled. “But for your knowledge, my father was insistent on me going to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts – he’s friends with the headmaster.”
,” drawled Lyra. “Now that the entire gang is together – “
“I wanted to give this to you for Christmas but considering you’ll be leaving soon…” he said, handing her the gift.
“It’s important…because it’s Sirius and my child,” Remus admitted quietly. Hermione gasped loudly.
“That’s a good idea. Fred, can you pass me mine please?” Sarah muttered quietly, taking the potion Fred offered her and downing it in one swallow. “Ugh! They always taste so horrid.”
potions – nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to
Sarah made her way over to the odd group and sat down in one of the free chairs.
wrong.
“There are loads of secret passageways in the castle,” Blaise muttered. “Surely Black could have gotten in through one of those?”
“As some of you will have noticed,” she was saying, “we have an additional cohort with us this year. Due to lack of room in the normal House dormitories, the eighth years will be taking up residence in the newly renovated rooms which previously housed teachers in the East Wing. Professor Bayard will be your designated Head. Should you have any issues, please go to him. Now, Quidditch trials shall be held – “
Sarah took the flask.
Poor Harry also had to deal with constantly being watched now. Teachers found excuses to walk alongside him through corridors, and Percy Weasley was following him like a dog after a bone (most likely done on his mother’s orders). Sarah and Draco found it increasingly more difficult not to laugh at Harry’s rising aggravation. They both had collapsed into uncontrollable laughter when Harry returned to the library one day after a meeting with Professor McGonagall. Apparently, he had shocked the older woman by saying he already knew Sirius Black was after him when she tried to warn him.
“What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeve’s grin faded a little. He didn’t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead, he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle.
“So you are still your lovely self,” George commented as they began walking upstairs. “Good, I was beginning to worry you’d lost your spark.”
Ron turned to look at Harry, gaping. “Mate, what’s Malfoy doing in your shop?”
“Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly.
Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.
They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey, with only Hermione asking Professor Lupin questions about the upcoming school year. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets.
Harry’s domineering figure allowed them all to march straight up to the fireplaces, which were currently being sealed, preventing anyone from exiting.
“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time…” snarled Harry.
She was right.
“I’m not going to make an issue about this now because you just survived a dragon, Harry,” Sarah said, making sure to keep her voice calm. “But I
“I wonder who’ll be teaching us?” said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. “Someone told me Flitwick was a duelling champion when he was young – maybe it’ll be him.”
With a sharp whistle, the match began. Lee Jordan was providing the match commentary, to Sarah’s great amusement. He kept getting told off by Professor McGonagall for focusing on the Firebolt instead of the match.
Sarah woke up to Hermione shaking her urgently.
Sarah snorted and waved her own wand at a stubborn piece of carpet until it Vanished.
“It’s none of your business!”
“Famous Harry Potter. Can’t even walk into a bookstore without getting on the front page,” he snarled, pushing toward the group.
Lyra stared at Madam Pomfrey as she puttered around Draco’s bed, picking up and replacing various potions and ointments.
“Oh, Merlin, are you okay?” he gasped, kneeling in front of her.
The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: the Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight. Sarah took a deep breath as warmth began to flow back into her shivering limbs.
“You’re predictable, Harry, and I know you,” she shrugged. “Also, Draco found your bag and nearly lost his shit.”
Harry shrugged a shoulder. “I don’t know. Maybe. I just thought I should mention them.”
“Kreacher, we need you to clean up the place and make sure that no one unwelcome can access it,” Sarah ordered. “Can you do that?”
“Another step and I slit her throat!” Bellatrix screamed. A trickle of red began to slip down Granger’s throat and Weasley growled loudly at Draco’s aunt.
“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to protect you all from something much worse…We all know what Black’s capable of…”
Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in the corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled
Pansy growled in annoyance. Footsteps from the dormitories caught her attention and Sarah rolled her eyes as Pansy called out, “Blaise! Help me out here! Sarah refuses to study and she’s making me stressed!”
“Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding,” snorted Ron.
“Five minutes,” Sarah said as she turned back to Ron. “We’ll listen to what you have to say but we can’t promise anything.”
“It means nothing when
“We thought he may have been ace,” admitted Pansy.
“Thank you,” Sarah said gratefully, shifting to hold Sphinx’s cage more securely.
“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur’s bed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me…”
“You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione.
have better hair!”
“Hs’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. “Can’t we get anyone else?”
“Correct,” Snape agreed. “And do you understand why that poses certain threats to us all?”
She nodded and rolled her shoulders. Closing her eyes, she concentrated until she felt her body begin to change: she shrunk slightly as weight was added to her usually slight frame, dirty-blond hand cascaded down her back as her face became pudgier and slightly wrinkled. Once done, she distractedly tied her straw-like hair into a neat updo and transfigured her clothes into aubergine robes.
The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress.
“Yes, your brother definitely had some pent-up anger within him,” George said in mock-seriousness. He left out an
Draco raised himself slightly and said in confusion, “Didn’t you? I really thought you had.”
to catch the Snitch early. You can’t let them get ahead by fifty points – if they do and Potter catches the Snitch, we lose. Did you hear me? You must catch the Snitch early – “
“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly, “but we should be able to sit and talk here without any problem. And I’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the pipes and groaning so just ignore him…”
“Doesn’t have to be strong,” he argued. “Just has to make sense.”
“How on earth can you write that much?” he exclaimed quietly, eyes darting around for the hawkish librarian, Madam Pinch.
Lyra placed a gentle hand on Pansy’s arm. “He’ll be fine,” she promised. “Madam Pomfrey can fix up anyone. She’s been doing it all year.”
“Do Millicent and Theo ignore him?” Harry asked.
“Not my entire arm,” Sarah murmured distractedly, aiming her wand at her skin. “Only my bicep really.”
“None of my business?” Sarah swelled in anger. “It is
It was another half-hour until all three of them were finished. Harry kept moving his hand through the shorter top section and grimacing.
“Yes,” came Crabbe’s clear drawl, “Father said that the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron
“What did Dumbledore want?” Sarah asked as Draco hovered around Harry anxiously.
Blaise watched the pair with an intrigued expression on his face. “I wonder where Draco managed to escape to?” he said.
Sarah knew that Harry knew that Hermione meant well, but that didn’t stop him from being angry at her.
“We’re okay now,” Harry whispered to Draco. “All of us.”
“I’m okay,” Sarah promised. “The bruises will be gone in a few days.”
“Why would Sarah hurt herself?”
With Harry’s help, she wrote out descriptions of the events and Mr Crouch’s words. She asked them for any advice on what to do or if there was anything they should know about Crouch or Bertha Jorkins. When the letter was completed, she slipped it securely into her bag.
“Are they getting any better?” he asked.
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter…”
Harry was looking distraught and sleep-deprived.
“So – straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in sixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it all then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? You need to be alert and watchful. So…do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law?”
“Oh,” he said calmly. “So, I guess you heard that then?”
“Sarah, must you be so crude?” Hermione scolded. “And I told you not to tell me anything about any potential alcohol or else I’ll be forced to confiscate it.”
– what does that mean, Ron? Do we disgust you? Two boys?”
“Shot not getting him,” Pansy said quickly. Draco, Millicent and Theo quickly echoed the sentiment with Sarah being half a second too late.
Sarah huffed a laugh at that. They had foolishly agreed to let their friends help them move. Trying to work around Hermione’s suggestions, Blaise’s commentary and Draco and Harry randomly snogging in various rooms was a nightmare and one that Sarah was very glad to be rid of.
“Promise,” he said. Harry kissed him quickly. Draco pulled back and rolled his eyes. “Look at the sap you’ve turned me into,” he said dramatically. “I’ll never hear the end of it from Lyra.”
“Mother,” Sarah sobbed quietly. The ghost figure looked exactly as Sarah remembered her mother in life: hair the same colour as hers, large dark eyes, elegant cheekbones, a smile that always seemed to be slightly tilted as if she were about to tell a joke. Somehow, Sarah heard what she said despite the distance between them and the noise of the Death Eaters.
When the sun had dipped low into the horizon, Sarah realised that footsteps were growing closer and closer to where she was still sitting against the tree.
your subject does deal with myths and legends due to their impact on historical events?” Sarah asked innocently, ignoring Hermione and Harry’s beaming faces.
Lyra hummed but didn’t say anything else on the topic. With a nod to them both in farewell, she raced across the common room and threw herself on top of Blaise, who was reclining on a couch.
Sarah kept a neutral expression on her face as Draco spun the story for the Minister.
Ron held Sarah back as she took a furious step toward Crabbe. She saw Harry holding Draco back as well, an arm wrapped tightly around his stomach. No one, however, was holding Hermione. She stepped forward and – SMACK!
Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Hermione, what are you planning?” she asked.
They could not clearly see what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Sarah saw, Dolores Umbridge. Sarah glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realised what guiding him in his tear-swollen trek: Grawp, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was sitting with his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Sarah had a momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped, and she turned to face the front again.
“That’s Dolohov,” said Draco. “I recognised them. The other one’s Thorfinn Rowle.”
Sarah rolled her eyes and leapt at the boys, causing their heads to smash together in her hug.
“Come in, come in,” Naomi commanded, pulling Rosie with her.
He didn’t.
?” he repeated. “It’s called communication. Maybe you’d have that if you didn’t just sleep with everyone you met and instead tried to make friends.”
to think about the greater good! This is war!”
Fred broke off and took a shuddering breath.
“We’ll risk it, Sybill,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently, causing Sarah to snort quietly. “Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone cold.”
form?”
“I haven’t done something like that in years,” panted Draco, wiping snow off his face but leaving behind a trail of cold water.
“How long do you think I can avoid Sirius and Remus before they just summon me to them?” Sarah asked, spotting the pair eyeing Sarah intently, Teddy crawling at their feet.
For a moment, Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry thought. Ron was still white-faced and silent.
– she kept calling me an ‘outdated pureblood with a penchant for inbred blonds’.” Sarah shuddered. “I don’t even know what that
Fleur saved her and said, “Mr Ollivander leaves for Muriel’s zis evening. Zat will make things easier. Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you, Ron and Draco can take zat room.”
“Yes.”
“Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred Cattermole?”
Pansy huffed. “Fine, but I hope she falls off her broom.”
He looked around for anyone to help him but Pansy and Theo had already finished dinner and Draco was sitting with Harry at the Gryffindor table. Realising he didn’t have any other options, he shifted so that he could scoop Sarah into his arms and stood from the table.
“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron irritably.
,” said Fred.
, Blaise!”
Sarah watched as Hermione disappeared into the crowd before resuming walking. Draco caught sight of her frown and asked, “Everything okay?”
Hermione shot her a narrow-eyed look but didn’t say anything. Ron appeared in the doorway, his shirt the wrong way.
“This is a shit hole,” Millicent stated, her lip curling. “Why does Granger want us to meet here?”
Sarah tugged Fred’s beanie further down her head and huffed into her gloves.
“Sarah was right,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office examining it – “
Before he could leave, Harry hurried around the counter and grabbed his arm. He turned to address Ron.
“Shut up, Ly,” Draco said, his words muffled by his pillow. “Why must Potter be so attractive? It’s extremely unfair that I am expected to keep my hands to myself when he looks like
“Merlin, I missed that,” he sighed.
“Ah, there you are dears,” she said in a kind tone, eyeing them all critically. “I don’t know what those Hogwarts elves are feeding you. You are all too thin!”
Draco snorted. “No one tries to hurt my friends,” he stated. “Smith deserved it.”
She took a deep breath and looked out the window.
Sarah summoned a mirror and looked at herself.
“Eat that quickly before the harpy returns,” she muttered, looking around the ward.
“Hagrid doesn’t want us to see it,” Draco interrupted, grabbing Sarah to keep her seated. “We have to wait until the other’s get here.”
“Thank you, little snake,” Fred said without an ounce of remorse.
“You weren’t talking to us,” Sarah concluded. “But you are now, apparently.”
They were right – for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela.
“Just relax, Sarah,” Theo whispered as her eyes began to close.
She had always been gorgeous, but the smile that lit up her face seemed to blur everything around them until the bright aquamarine of her eyes was the only thing you could see. Harry was not surprised that Fred looked as though someone has slapped him across the face. He had never seen the other man look as happy as he was now.
A moment later, warm lips brushed against Harry’s and he sank into the feeling bubbling up inside him. He wrapped his arms around Draco, lips moving steadily against the other man’s. Draco tilted his head to the side and deepened the kiss, his hand moving from Harry’s arm to his back, drawing their bodies even closer together. Harry let out a small groan and Draco slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth. They moved together, matching each other’s pace until they had to draw back for breath.
“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.
“Sarah! Sarah! Come back!”
“I’m thinking that I’m just so
Seamus used Sarah’s distraction to his advantage and scooped up his wand, fleeing the room and slamming the door behind him.
“Oh, please, Ron, I don’t want to hear it,” Hermione began.
“When will you be leaving?” she asked them.
“Oddsbodikins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt.
“Good,” she said, removing the charm. “Now, anybody who isn’t in Slytherin or
Draco watched him anxiously as he ripped through the paper and held the small, flat box gently in his hands.
“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the crowd at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.
Sarah smiled innocently up at the nurse, who just rolled her eyes.
Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Remus, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley.
“I will,” he said, relieved that his voice didn’t shake.
Sarah laughed. “They wouldn’t have sex here, that’s what my house is for.”
Lyra absentmindedly traced over her left forearm, the constellations standing out stark against the faded image of the Dark Mark. Even after nearly two decades, the brand had never fully faded. But that didn’t matter anymore, for new memories covered the old scar.
make it worse!”
“I swear to Merlin you’re trying to kill me,” she muttered weakly, grasping Fred’s hair with one hand as the other gripped the sheets beside her.
“Is it true Potter attacked you?” Blaise asked.
“I’ve always wanted to see Norway,” Lyra said. “Maybe we should go around Europe. We could even go to America. And Canada sounds lovely.”
Ron and Madam Pomfrey looked aghast by her comment.
“Er – Harry lent me pyjamas,” Draco blushed.
“Blaise told me he’s going to Italy for the holidays,” Draco said. “But Pansy may be able to come.”
“On purpose?” Ron gaped.
“Let’s leave it to them,” Sarah said, pushing the boys in the back to get them to move.
Remus kicked at the chair he had vacated.
Harry looked extremely relieved.
She cut herself off and groaned, falling sideways to collapse against Blaise’s shoulder. He patted her gently on the head.
“I thought – I thought – “ he stammered.
Fred gripped her tighter and said sternly but quietly, “Don’t say that, Sarah. You can’t compare your suffering to someone else’s. Yes, Harry went through something horrible but so did
The very best thing Sarah could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: it was a close-run contest between Ron’s fourteenth failed save, Jack Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat and Andrew Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby’s nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty. Harry, Fred and George looked extremely dejected by the end of the match and even Sarah suggesting a snowball fight failed to raise their spirits.
They looked at her in relief.
“If it really worries you,” continued Sarah. “Contact Remus and Sirius. Get the full story from them. I know that he must have been a good person or else my mother never would have been friends with him.”
“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all – “
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the default Ministry woman’s voice. It echoed in the small space and they all glanced around nervously.
Harry stared at them all a moment longer before sighing in defeat.
“I will
“Seriously, Potter, you look like a sappy teenager,” Draco continued.
Sarah nodded and rolled her sleeves up. They worked tirelessly to close the wounds using the spell Snape had given them. Despite the Dittany they sprinkled across the cuts, Sarah knew Draco was going to scar.
“Who knew Fred was capable of uttering such a vituperative comment?” Sirius said in mock horror. “Moony, protect me from the mean ginger.”
the potion in
Sarah was secretly amused by the idea that one of Hagrid’s worse memories was saying goodbye to his baby dragon. It made her love Hagrid’s caring nature even more.
standards, Harry. Definitely wouldn’t have imagined you to be the type to sleep with someone like
Dobby nodded his head up and down vigorously. “Dobby can be doing that easily! Dobby will bring it to Mistress Sarah tomorrow morning in her room when he gets it!”
“I’ll admit it was not pleasant,” he said quietly. “But I imagine it was even worse for you.”
Harry had taken a spot just outside the tent, a blanket laid on the ground beneath with one over his shoulders.
“Sarah?” he said in confusion, “What are you doing here? Isn’t the next task about to start?”
“As far as we know,” said Sarah. “Are there still people in the passage to the Hog’s Head?”
“Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,” said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. “He has been taken to St Mungo’s for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius’ house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your mother there.”
Sarah looked up at Hermione’s worried shout. The girl was racing toward the Slytherin table, her brown eyes wild and red-rimmed.
- ? I cannot
“But – but that was
“We didn’t have anyone else with us,” Sarah argued. “We only had….” She gasped in disbelief and turned toward Ron. “
George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.
“Look what the crup dragged in,” drawled Theo, nodding at the door.
“Ron, please shut up,” Sarah said desperately in a hushed voice. “Draco and I should really be leaving. We shouldn’t be here – “
With a growing smile on his face, Draco recounted the date and the subsequent messages he had gotten from Harry since.
Draco snorted again but didn’t make any effort to disagree.
Draco shook his head. “Not hungry.”
Lyra just shook her head at him. “Not my place, darling.”
Draco was in quite a good mood for the rest of the night.
Madam Pomfrey emerged from her office and her eyes tightened around the edges when she saw Draco floating in front of their trio.
Hagrid presided over the easiest Care of Magical Creatures exam ever. He had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms and told them that to pass the test, their flobberworms had to still be alive by the end of the hour. It gave Sarah and the others the ability to talk to Hagrid about Buckbeak as they left their flobberworms to their own devices.
“Regardless,” Draco interjected. “Dumbledore couldn’t cure Mrs Norris – which means either a potion, obscure spell or something else was used to Petrify her. Along with Professor Snape, Dumbledore would have been able to determine if a potion or spell were used. Considering that they haven’t, the only logical option is to believe that the Petrification was a result of a creature or potentially a cursed object.”
“It won’t work,” Harry warned. “Aunt Petunia tried once and it grew back overnight.”
“Professor Snape told me to give this to you,” he squeaked. He thrust a rolled parchment at her and then ran away, leaving Sarah to look after him in bemusement.
“I said,
“All right, that’s enough of that.”
Hermione and Lyra smirked at each other.
They were stopped, however, by a large crowd gathered in the entrance hall. Crabbe was standing in front of Ron and Harry, waving a copy of the
“For goodness sake, Harry! Stop sighing and actually do some study!” Hermione snapped at him, not even looking up from her own work.
Everybody mounted their brooms. Sarah waved goodbye to Remus and Sirius, who smiled sadly back.
“Hey, you’re okay. We’re all okay, pup,” Sirius said. He sat beside her on the bed and ran one large hand over hair. “Look at us, we’re fine.”
“Joke shop still on, then?” Sarah muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on her spray.
myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I’m -  that I’m – “
“It’s not my fault he and Bill got all the handsome genes in the family,” Lyra said with a smirk. She had met the dragon tamer a month ago at a Burrow Sunday lunch that George had dragged her along to. Since then, she made it a habit to mention him to George whenever she could.
“The two of us?” he asked. “I thought Draco was staying as well.”
“Ronald! Wait for lunch!” Mrs Weasley snapped, slapping Ron’s hand away from the food.
The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him the Voldemort spoke first.
“No,” Draco said, belatedly answering Charles’ question. “This is a vital operation.”
“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs Weasley, tears streaming down her face.
Nothing could have prepared Sarah for what happened next. The smoky shadow of a woman with long dark hair fell to the ground, straightened up and looked, not toward Harry, but directly through the web of light toward Sarah.
Her friends stared dumbstruck back at her.
things.
“Listen,” said Harry, the rising panic Sarah felt was reflected in his voice. “I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then – “
“No, no, no, no, no,” Sarah muttered, turning away toward the castle. “I’m going to see him.”
Fred drew back and Sarah looked over his shoulder to see Goyle standing in the corridor, staring dumbly at them. She was glad for Fred’s quick thinking; their flushed faces from sprinting made it look like they had been enjoying quite a good snog.
“They were nice,” Harry commented as they strolled down the street. It had decreased greatly in temperature and Draco couldn’t hold back a shiver. Harry noticed and wrapped his arm around Draco, causing Draco to blush and shiver for an entirely different reason.
“No idea – sit down – “
Sarah kissed him back and snuggled closer to his chest. “You could visit me on Hogsmeade weekends,” she suggested. “A new café opened at the end of the main street and I’ve been wanting to see what it’s like.”
Sarah and Harry quickly left the hospital wing before separating to their separate classes, with Sarah telling Professor Babbling that Draco was in the hospital wing.
“Can you take Mackinnon, Kinkade and Laurens with you to practice shooting goals?” she asked.
“The moment that – that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and – and – “
“With all due respect, Professor,” Sarah drawled in an equally bored tone. “I have no problem showing Draco just who the better duellist is.” She shot Draco a Cheshire cat smile and he smirked in return.
“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s glass without you seeing?”
“Please do not repeat any of this to your mother,” Remus said, shuddering slightly. “Molly can be terrifying when she wants to be.”
“Oi! There you are!” Ron’s voice suddenly called.
They most likely made quite the picture: Draco was a good head taller than her now and Sarah had to tilt her head up to look at him properly. Both red in the face, neither one of them was willing to back down.
“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice shaking with laughter. “I hope Luna always commentates from now on…
Sarah looked at Draco and saw that he looked hesitant to stay with his mother.
“At least it’ll be less pointy then,” Sarah teased, shivering under her jacket.
“No,” Harry said after a moment.
“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s head, where a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name
She held her arms up and smiled when Harry rolled his eyes but pulled her up.
In a matter of seconds, the Headmaster had swept past their group and detached Mrs Norris from the torch bracket.
Blaise and Theo exchanged a glance over her head and wisely decided to change the subject.
“We have no times to collect possessions,” said Professor McGonagall. “The important thing is to get you out of here safely.”
Fred was silent for a long moment and Sarah knew he was thinking through his response. When it at last came, it was, “Have you thought at all about seeing a Mind Healer?”
“Drink up, drink up,” she said, still smiling. “Now, Mr Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr Potter…”
He scanned it quickly before looking up at Ron in amusement.
“It is an act that is crucial to succeed, Vincent!” said Snape. “Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Goyle – “
Sarah turned to face him properly.
“Draco…”
A dull
She held the magazine up so they could see. Harry’s face was on the front cover, emblazoned with the words
“Father,” she said, dodging the jet of light and sending one of her own back.
Draco nodded and took a deep breath.
She caught Draco’s eye and gave him a sly wink. He immediately blushed bright red but couldn’t contain the smile on his face.
“So what?” Harry said dumbly.
“She’s right,” he said. He hadn’t loosened his grip on Harry’s arm. “We need a distraction if we’re going to try to contact Sirius. They can help with that.”
“This is no use, though,” Draco said, snapping shut
“You’re hopeless,” Hermione muttered, putting a hand on her face. She seemed to collect herself for a moment before looking at Harry again. “Okay, new question: have you
“Come on, Harry…”
He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other.
“I don’t know!” Draco said with conviction.
“I need you to hold her down as I do some diagnostics!” The wind was getting louder so Sarah raised her voice even more. Despite that, Leanne nodded and gripped Katie’s arms, sitting on her legs to keep her still.
“Maybe I should wear a skirt more often,” Blaise commented to Sarah and Pansy as they made their way to dinner after their Ancient Studies class, “if it gets me out of homework.”
“I don’t know how you, Hermione and Draco do it,” Harry announced as he put away the last of his essays. “I’m barely keeping up and I have fewer subjects than you.”
“I sure hope everyone got out okay,” she said as she rested against Fred.
“I do!” said Harry fiercely, echoing Sarah. “I’ve got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose this fame we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!”
“Fred,” she said softly. His brown eyes looked intensely at her. “I want to do this.”
“It would’ve been better if we could’ve stayed for the whole meeting,” Fred said grumpily.
“What do you think, babe? Should I grow a beard?” Fred asked, laughing as Sarah ducked under his arm to avoid kisses being peppered all over her face.
“That’s horrible, Sarah!” Hermione said disapprovingly. “It’s not Cho’s fault she was…slightly oblivious…”
“Thank you for pulling me from that fire,” Draco told him.
“I missed you, too,” she said when they separated.
“Then I better go get my cloak.”
Sarah kissed him and wrapped her arms tightly around him. Without much warning, she suddenly flipped them so she was straddling him. She put her hands on his chest as he stared wide-eyed up at her.
Draco sat bolt upright.
When Sarah finally went down into the kitchen, her hair still damp from her shower, it was to find it a hive of activity. Harry was back from his hearing and was now sitting Draco’s arms wrapped around him, smiling at Ron and Hermione. Mrs Weasley was wiping her face on her apron while Mr Weasley, Sirius and Remus spoke in hushed voices nearby. Fred, George and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “
But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget:
Draco looked angry and betrayed. “I can’t believe he would do something like this,” he muttered.
“Didn’t he give you something before the start of term?” Sarah recalled. “You never showed us what it was.”
“There’s someone up there all right, Selwyn,” said the other man sharply.
“It’s for their safety,” Draco told him. “If they were free to interact with the other animals, they may get sicker. The cages keep them healthy and comfortable. We do have an open kennel section of the clinic as well, however. That’s where we take the injured animals that don’t have a home and we try to get them adopted.”
“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” Harry told Dumbledore, who was watching him silently, “back where it came from. it can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.”
“Why?”
“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,” said George, in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.”
Nearly an hour later, they were distracted by loud noises coming from the common room and the sudden slam of the entrance.
“Was she the nasty woman from your wedding?” Luna asked airily. “She insulted Ginny’s ankles.”
“Hagrid, she’s been cursed!” shouted Sarah. “You have to get her to Madam Pomfrey, now!”
Sirius and Remus looked surprised.
“You love us, ‘Mione,” Harry said with a bright grin before doubling over as Ron’s elbow caught him in the stomach.
“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his two best friends. The war had finally brought them together and they were both happier because of it. Blaise absolutely adored Pansy, who loved the attention but also genuinely cared for the boy in return. The only other relationship similar seemed to be of Granger and Weasley but Draco didn’t want to think too long about them in that way.
Warm sunlight on her face drew Sarah to awareness. She was still wrapped tightly in Fred’s arms, one of his hands running up and down her back slowly.
“I can’t believe
The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter, Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots and various fungi.
“Oh shit,” she heard him curse as he quickly began to lose places to step.
Draco surged forward and caught Harry’s lips with his own, swallowing the other boy’s groan as he began to eagerly attack Harry’s mouth. Harry’s hand had dropped from Draco’s waist to his arse and pulled Draco even closer, pressing them tightly from chest to thighs. Draco snaked a hand up into Harry’s hair, gripping and tugging to tilt Harry’s head slightly to deepen the kiss. Harry’s tongue dove forward when Draco let out a gasp, one of Harry’s hands sliding under Draco’s shirt.
“Go ahead,” Fred said. “I’m going to go find Bill.”
Sarah nodded, taking a large bite of her sandwich while she thought of her answer.
“Er,” he said into the sudden silence, “shall…shall we go up to the party, then?”
“That reminds me,” Sirius lowered his voice so only she could hear it. “You never mentioned if you managed to transform.”
“No problem! See you, Harry!” Colin squeaked, bouncing away to the other end of the table where a group of first-years sat.
“No second year could have done this,” said Dumbledore firmly. “It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced – “
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, “
“Have sweet dreams, Harry,” Draco said cheekily, leaning forward to nip Harry’s earlobe. “I know I’ll be thinking about you.”
“I gave you plenty of time,” Narcissa said with a slight smile. “And now you know, so I say we enjoy a nice brunch before you all head off for a delightful lunch at the Burrow.”
“But Malfoy. Really?” Ginny demanded.
She showed him her healed arm to prove it.
“Draco, breathe,” Harry said. He got to his feet and gripped Draco’s arms, forcing him to pause for long enough to draw proper breath. “Go help her. I’ll check on you later.”
“I expect to see you at Deaumont Manor at the start of next summer, Sarah,” Antonius warned. “You will not like the consequences if I do not.”
An awkward silence descended upon them before Luna was dragged away by a fuming Ginny, waving cheerfully at them all as she went.
Ron perked up, having an excuse to interrupt Draco’s rant. “Somewhere over there,” he said, pointing along the shelves. “Looking for another book. I think she’s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.”
Ron agreed and Draco chimed in that he wanted a punch as well, a sentiment that was followed by an annoyed Hermione.
“Luna?” Sarah gasped. “What are you doing here?”
“Why do I have to do it?” he complained.
Lyra looked extremely confused. “Of course not,” she said, frowning slightly. Her eyes suddenly lit with recognition. “Muggles have a problem with it, don’t they?” she asked.
“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girl’s dormitory.
“Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch.
Sarah looked around. One thing was certain: Dumbledore’s office was by far the most interesting she had ever seen. It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard’s hat – the
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harry, Sarah and Draco whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
?” Harry laughed incredulously, pulling back to look Draco in the eye. “I thought you were meant to be the pretentious one?”
Hermione stared at her intently.
“Crabbe obviously hadn’t expected people to be on watch,” Remus explained. “The fight broke out when the Death Eaters bumped into me and Bill. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Neville all arrived shortly after. The Death Eaters scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs – “
