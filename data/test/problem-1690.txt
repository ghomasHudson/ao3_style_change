"Why bother doing this at the school if it is a danger to it's occupants, no come along to our realm with those willing to take care of Harry now and we will look over the transition of you all as we have endorsed this so Harry gets all the benefits of his standing within our joint communities" she tapped the wall nearest to the window with her forefinger and muttered "Porta Inferni" creating a infernal doorway to an unknown location in front of them "this doorway spell can be used as a better alternative to apparition as long as you have been there it will send you there though very few beings use the old spell for some reason" Flora stated with a frown "ah yes it would be due to the power needed, it would suck a wizard dry to try this travel route so be careful using the Dark spell not even your Voldemort could do this even if he did know the spell" she added before extending a hand to collect the infant and gesture to the others to walk through "Remus, Sirius your decision before we leave?" The Lich asked facing them for the first time.
At first nothing seemed wrong from his distance, despite the gate hangingly ajar, the building lay silent and in tact, without the Dark Mark looming ominously over head, this should have placated anyone else who came snooping if it weren't him, the wards had unmistakably fallen or he wouldn't have known the location or seen it as he neared their residence.
In the end the impulse couldn't be denied despite needing to keep a low profile, one couldn't deny themselves when a creature meets their mate for the first time even if it was that he was known before the change.
He was about to walk back upstairs with Blaise when he stopped suddenly mid step, causing his friend to pump into him from behind by accident, "What the hell Draco mind it!" He said indignantly, trying to push Draco up the stairs so he would get moving instead of standing there but he didn't know that Draco was feeling something very weird.
"If it isn't Mrs Kettleburn of Familial Affairs, what brings you to me? Is there a creature child missing or orphaned that you need my specialist opinion on? or is it some dangerous house hold pet that someone is attempting to claim as a familiar?" He enquired softly to her, Sonia blinked rapidly in slight astonishment at his kind tone before replying "Mr Diggle you are correct I am here to ask you to accompany me to my office over a matter of a dark creature child who's current guardian is wishing to change Sire's".
Narcissa coughed "May I call you Harry? Well Draco has not been taught of your kind as it's quite obscure and has never been seen in adolescence or it's true form, you are a Dark Chimera if I am correct the more you sap magic the more inherent talents of magic as well as forms you possess, am I right in thinking you are here for Gringotts only but revealed yourself because your creature resonated with my Draco?" She asked in a light but stern voice.
If he was being honest with himself, he could feel the power swim and hum pleasantly as well as seductively as it poured out of the runes and gently caressed his newly heightened senses, the moment he caught sight of it, it was more tempting to drain the 'Pansy Parkinson' or at least he thought as he attempted to reach for the door, only to be stopped by his many escorts.
James nodded once though snarled at the mention of Snivullus being anywhere near his wife, and left as soon as he came, Dumbledore stood up from his desk, rubbed his temples muttering "The Chosen One isn't human? This could prove disastrous in the years to come but at least they are protected by the fidelius, well until Peter delivers the dark lord my little gift, I do hope Harry destroys him quickly when it happens.." he smirked darkly to himself as he moved towards the perch and tapped his pheonix lightly.
James however did not hear here through his silencing ward and instead was busy shifting through Auror reports on his desk.
~Massster do you believe you will come out unssscaved, that you will not be betrayed by that cowardsss words?~ Nagini wishpered from the corner of the room.
"Serverus, did you bring the restorative potions? We have to go there now or she and that baby won't make it, if it is as we have been led to believe and is inhuman, regardless of his mothers genealogy also having dormant creature blood, she is still too human to give birth to something with vampirism, Albus tells me James has opened the floo connection to my grate so we must be swift" Poppy spoke in clinical irritation, Snape just sneered at her "Do you think me incompetent woman? Yes I brought it all as requested, she is dear to me".
"You better fucking stay put Peter, I am warning you now, you will remain until you are interrogated at the ministry for your involvement and as you are yet to register even if you are innocent sadly you will still be fined for not registering your Animagus ability with the ministry, quite a shake huh?" Sirius whispered fiercely at him, who just squeaked, twitched and trembled in the spell bound cage, looking side to side as if for an escape route.
Fawkes nipped his fingers affectionately before withdrawing to carry out his masters orders, he disappeared in a flash of flame to find wherever his masters quarry lay hiding.
As the day war on in the Potter household, it is safe to say James was near exhausted, Harry proved to be more of a handful than even he previously predicted.
Sirius nodded despite the wounded pride that he couldn't fulfill his role adequately, Remus on the other hand interjected "I agree he needs a steady hand by someone of his kind as mortals aren't equipped and even I could not adopt him due to my lycanthropy and I agree with Severus being the guardian but not him being placed a ward of the school and giving you more leniency than that of teacher and student Dumbledore" he growled lowly, Dedalus looked at him startled for a second before actually nodding approval, "In regards to his level of intellectual ability and powers, he seems very inquisitive for his age already and shows signs of being a metamorphamagus, I've seen him cheekily change his hair and wing colour to his mothers red so that is a strong magical ability he is already capable of" Remus said chuckling.
"Time to test everyone useless vials bring them up here and pack away your utensils and ingredients back into the store room, know this anyone attempting to steal my ingredients will get more than a detention I assure you!" He barked as he collected their named vials and proceeded to eye them each critically, "It would seem we need some homework assigned to drill the correct brewing methods into your brain, homework will be twelve inches of parchment explaining the functions of each ingredient added to the potion, the correct brewing method and what could be added to strengthen or enhance the potions effects, due in next wednesday, class dismissed!" He said as the bell chimed signalling the end of the lesson.
Albus Dumbledore groaned as he awoke, draped awkwardly along the stiff furnishings of his winged high back chair after having been collapsed in it all night, sprawled over various notices and correspondences in his office.
On closer inspection however the door was blown out with charred wooden cracks along its' frame, after quickly examining it he noted the spell residue that was lingering appeared to be work of the Dark Lord "seems he went for a grand entrance and didn't have the time to spare to eradicate his raids evidence" he muttered to himself in contemplation as he eyed the damage before walking up the path to examine the inside of the bottom floor.
His green/blue eyes sparkled slightly in delight as she tickled him and stroaked his little wings eventually making him drowsy as she hummed to him a wordless lullaby. It was interrupted however by the elf noisily levitating Harry's crib into their room, making Harry wail at being woken just as he was drifting off.
All the Goblins standing admist their usual podiums waiting to serve customers, all turned and gazed and the rather abrupt entrance, most sneering openly thinking 'Who does that wizard think he is barging in here like he owns and thinks he has the right to give orders on our premises!', Ragnok the bank manager present at the far end just stared him down before signalling the armed guards to walk with him to where the Dumbledore stood with half the Order.
Sirius was taken aback, he thought Molly Weasley was a lovely motherly woman, they were friends throughout the last war for Merlin's sake, he stood up, pulled out his wand and banished all three of them outside his house, them landing hard in the square outside.
Albus conceded a nod at the observation "This is true my boy however is Remus available? I do not mind keeping the boy company until Sirius can contact and being Remus to the castle, then I am afraid I will do as you suggest as I have been wilfully negligent of letters the board of governors have been hounding me with, until then give me Harry and Severus you can go back to your potions lessons, as I understand it you had your N.E.W.T students this morning, I am sorry for keeping you so long".
Sirius descended towards the ministry, trying to fight off the strong body bind someone had sent his way. 'Who the fuck was that? A Death Eater trying to cover Wormtails tracks? Who ever it was I will take this to my Supervisor so they sanction a warrant of arrest and assign me to find the bastards, but after I have spoken to Familial Affairs as that now takes precedence, that being said Wormtail knows all the routes unguarded into the castle and his magical signature as an alumni will make him welcome by the wards, this could prove very worrisome, Dumbledore will have to know when I return' Sirius thought in agitation.
He said, Kingsley looked at him sharply during the explanation of Harry and his condition as it was not written in his report though he conceded for good reason, it presented very dangerous problems he thought so turned to eye Sonia for her response.
They stood there briefly with wide eyes before Sirius and Minerva barked out orders "Kingsley, Arthur! Grab Tonks and bring her inside we need to assess how much was taken from her by those nasty memory charms, we will then take her to St Mongo's and inform the ministry of the damage should it be long lasting and extensive" Minerva announced while Sirius was shouting "Dedalus, Alastor! Grab that bastard Dumbledore we need to bring him inside for interrogation before he is handed over to the Auror's, Mad eye do you have any magic sealing cuffs on you? If so take his wand and cuff him so we are no longer in danger, Snape feed him some Verituserum when we get inside, I want to know his plans for my godson and why he chose to attack his own!".
"Once again mutt you have put your keen and penetrating mind to the task of justice and as usual come to wrong conclusion, I knew as I think of Lily often as you gathered being there long enough to see my breakdown, I knew the wards at dropped the moment I could name their residence last night, I slipped out via portkey to conduct my own investigation and make sure the Potter's were safe, I found them hear as they are, I rushed up here to try and save her, only their son survived, how I wonder he accomplished a shield against the organ rupture curse and rebounded it is anyone's guess" he said snidely but with a lilt of awe in his final words, watching the baby fidget in his robe "the boy was cold and crying so I offered him my cape just now to keep him warm, he had been in her cold embrace all night it seemed and sustained a scar to the head I believe when the curse hit, what are your intentions with the boy? He is safe with me if you wish to find Pettigrew yourself first so we can interrogate the welp?" He asked in frustration.
"Yes parties, you see he has been giving generous donations to the Order of his as well as the Weasleys since your parents passing, I will also have to check you for Compulsions and ability blocks to see how deep he has interfered for legal purposes and presenting a case against him with your consent, as well as retrieve what was stolen, do I have permission Mr Potter?" Griphook asks as he leans over with a seperate blank parchment.
Harry had to make a double take seeing this as his insides were screaming something new as he took in the glorious sight of Draco Malfoy, somewhere deep in his mind growled 'Mate!' He briefly wondered if that was the creature in him recognising it's chosen..
Harry turned briefly to Griphook "What has this fellow done? Is it worth me paying for its release as it could be useful to me alive as either ally or slave, I do not condone chaining and abuse, if it is to be death, do not prolong it unless thoroughly deserved" Harry murmured coldly thinking of his time under uncle Vernons reign.
'This is not going to be good, after the Dark Lord sent me to teach brats it has been one thing after another with this old goat, however he has protected Lily while the Dark Lord hunts her so I have to see this through' he thought dispassionately "What is it Fawkes?, I am busy if it is not urgent tell Albus I will answer him tomorrow" he sneered as the note dropped on to his desk.
"Albus! Get Poppy over here now Lily is going into labour, it looks like she needs immediate care or she will suffer more than blood loss at this rate I think he is carrying our condition! Hurry!".
He trudged along the stone path quickly, passing rows of small cottages and the small cemetery stationed on his left side, as he edged north towards the wrought black iron gate emblazoned with the Potter crest, at the far right end of the town, from a distance he could see it slightly ajar, tell tail signs that worm Wormtail and his master were here previously 'I have to hurry' he thought to himself as he neared his destination.
What will happen when they go to start their transition into the immortal community? What training do you think Harry may be subjected to before his emergence back into the Wizarding World?
The cart lurched suddently into a sharp descent, almost like a rollercoaster in Harry's opinion, before coming to a grinding hault, facing an ancient doorway etched in extensive immaculate runes only illuminated by the soft eerie glow of the numerous flickering torch brackets either side the door.
As Harry walked further into the room he noticed a lone naked Dark Elf with spiraling silver tattoos and sigals glowing on its body chained to the wall, as he drew closer to it the beings head snapped up and caught his eye with startled purple gaze "Please no.." it croaked, it's dark skin full of lacerations and clear deformation due to malnutrition, Harry though curious wasn't wanting to sap the intelligent being before him, he actually felt sorry for his fellow creature.
"I'm sorry but you have trespassed mrs?" Dumbledore began before being lifted bodily by the Lich, "Heh you think a wizard can out rank us regardless of their achievements? You think you can decide the life of one of our own without a member of the council here to witness and approve? You are arrogant for a human with such knowledge behind those occlumancy shields, yes I can see everything and if you do what you have planned you will pay more than a life in repentance!" It said placing him back down on his feet, "The boy, our little Harry has nothing to fear from Sirius or Remus, they are loyal and know whom we are and what this boy represents beyond your Boy Who Lived title, he is very special and very powerful, we will be here until Severus Snape takes his blood oath and sires our young one, we will give them provisions and the boy will grow up with our clans until he is eleven, at which time he will return to the school as others of creature blood do to learn their magicks, the Wizarding world will do nothing to find him until he returns except file this farce of an adoption, we will not take no for an answer however we will allow Severus to remain here as long as the headmaster allows his teaching post, is that clear?" The woman said again silkily.
"You and I both Snivullus! Now hand over my godson and explain what in ever loving fuck are you doing in this house!" A familiar voice shouted at him from the entry way, causing Snape to turn sharply to the new comer, focusing his wand at the other mans gaunt face.
"As Auror's apperated to the scene in order to find out the cause for disturbance within the seemingly quiet suburban neighbourhood, an erupting explosion could be heard engulfing the boy's muggle home."
"Listen Kingsley I was hoping to sort out other matters in other departments first, feel free to accompany me if you wish? I will debrief you along the way, you will need a Quick Quotes Quill or you won't be able to keep up" Sirius asked as he was herded into a lift full of inter-departmental memos flying around the ceiling, as the grills locked them in he faced Kingsley, hoping he was ready to take notes, Kingsley's cool gaze met his and with a flick of his wand the quill and parchment appeared out of thin air to float with the quill poised to paper, Kingsley lifted his eyebrow in question prompting Sirius to begin his recount of the days events, careful not to let on Harry was anything other than human, at least until they visited the Department Of The Regulation For Dark And Dangerous Creatures later to file Harry's Dhampire Creature Blood Status, knowing the longer it took the Ministry to find out he is without Sire, the better it was for Harry.
They strolled into Griphook's office quickly, Griphook went to stand behind his desk as he gestured to the empty seat opposite him for Harry to take, which Harry actually declines by instinct, this made the goblin laugh "I see Mr Potter you are not a fool to our customs when dealing with business transactions, this is surprising but very welcome, I am sure you wish to know the extent of the matters in which we summoned you?" He searched for some documents and placed a parchment in front of Harry and hands him a small rubied ceremonial dagger with etched runes carved along the handle before saying "Please place three drops of blood on this parchment, it will reveal your inheritance and birth certificate, the next one I will give you is your rites to succession among the heir and lord Rings and properties, we will then discuss your individual vault holdings as well as discrepancies that seems to have appeared once doing a full account audit" he grins nastily when he says that.
She tapped her cheek in contemplation 'Albus Dumbledore has given permission? The man responsible for defeating Grindelwald and renown for his intolerance of segregation and also Dark Creatures? What could that man be thinking? Granted some students he has given education to were Halfbreeds or those affected with afflictions such as Vampirism and Lycanthropy, either way I should report this to the regulations' department before it is finalised so they can monitor the situation closely' she thought, "Gentleman please wait here whilst I go and get a colleague more skilled than I in matters involving children suffering such afflictions before I make a judgement on the legality of your request, a human even housing a vampire child is of great personal risk as it is despite your familiarity with dealing with them I am sure you fail to notice how to nurture one as I am sure Mr Snape doesn't" she said as she got up and left the room.
He couldn't allow the old man to play tricks with his family even if it was for the greater good, he wished nothing more than to rely on him as less as he could though it was still more or less their life in his hands being the only one strong enough to cast their estate into fidelius, he was starting to doubt even Peter was the correct choice if it weren't for Sirius's askance to change he wouldn't have.
"I need to visit Familial Affairs to change the guardianship of Harry, my godson, though I can't give you an official reason why Kingsley, it will have to be when Dumbledore calls a meeting on what to do about the Death Eaters now their master has been slain, I wouldnt be surprised if we see many a cock and bull story as they try to merge back into society, would you take that bet? 20 Galleons says we will see at least Lucius Malfoy pull it off!" He smirked slightly despite how disgusted the idea made him feel at the thought of any of them getting off scot free.
"Son must you do this? He is the most dangerous thing on the planet! And he will get even worse the more he consumes, what if he has no trace of humanity when he wakes and see's you as sustenance? You would die ten thousand deaths if you don't kill it before it awakes!" He said scared shitless.
Ragnok himself wasn't phased at all, rather bored actually, it wasn't the first wizard to ever try and cast hostile spells in Gringotts, a barrier instantly shimmered into life ensnaring the culprit quite effectively leaving half the wizards dumbfounded as Albus struggled in his bindings and before he could actually make a dent in it someone cast an anti disapperation charm at him, making his escape twice as difficult.
There wasn't even any warning as a scream erupted somewhere in the back of the room, namely Harry waking and feeling the discomfort of having said blocks removed, Dumbledore raised his wand briskly and attempted to cast a body severing charm at the goblin in front of him, his calm facade immediately discarded as his power froze most of the occupants in slight terror.
Lily woke late into the morning, aching between her legs and stomach, a reminder that just last night her Harry was born, if not for the rougish smile in the door way facing her and the soft giggle and babbling next to her, as Harry kept trying to climb all over her face and smacking her with his little black wings.
Draco tuned out the ravaging of the unknown beings mind and simply held Harry close, taking in the strange new runes now shining on his lovers skin 'where had they come from?' "Lord, I have never seen these markings, what significance do they have sir?" He asked puzzled, breaking Voldemorts concentration.
James scratched his head in contemplation "It seems so though Sirius is likely to teach him how to be a Marauder, Harry will get into all sorts if his godfather has anything to do with it or if Remus gets near the boy he will end up a book worm, shall we try the lesser of two evils considering I can feel your glare from here?" He replied hoping his wife didn't beat him with a pillow again.
"You are correct, he is asking for a legal guardian by the name of Severus Snape to be documented along with being stationed as a ward of the school under Albus Dumbledore" she nodded.
"Only the Aurors and Regulation Department have the ability to send out dispatches or coam through the evidence you have tried to access without asking the appropriate person, unless it is the Minister Of Magic, which you are neither and therefore will be taken in for interrogation to await trial for possible child endangerment, dismissing protocol, breaking into an office, a serious breach of data protection and blatant creature prejudice! Though with the laws you helped write I doubt many will not be unlenient with said sentencing which is a pity as I really do hate what you did to my Remus" Sirius boomed with a malicious glare, before shooting ropes out of his wand to bind her in place as he nodded to Kingsley who promptly dragged her out and into the Auror Headquarters down the hall.
"The thing you have to understand is that the Dark Lord you wizards are so scared of is but an insect compared to the council and once Harry is grown maybe his title of saviour will be literal given his powers already showing at infancy.. providing meddlesome tools stay out of his way" the unknown Lich added in rasp, clearly glaring at the Headmaster at his feet struggling to rise due to the gravitational spell produced by Flora.
Remus looked at him minutely, processing the mans words, detecting truth in his logic but still suspicion "if that is the case headmaster I apologise for laying a wand on you however you did so when Sirius is still his only Guardian, you have no authority as of yet over the boy and for the audacity to act without authorisation, not to mention the damage a mind spell would possibly have done to a normal human you could face Azkaban at the very least, my judgement as the appointed guardian until Sirius returns is that I will cast the correct spells on the boy and you will lay not a finger on him, Severus and Sirius will know of what you did as they are the appropriate guardians!" Remus spat before centering his wand on Harry's sleeping form.
"You could of been my apprentice if this prophecy did not exist I believe it will be a loss but it is a sacrifice I must take and as you are a dark creature I think it fitting you experience the organ rupture curse I used to end your father.. Aruspices Bombarda Maxima!" The yellow light soared towards its defenceless target however it simply bounced off the infants forehead and rebounded back at the caster, ripping Voldemort of his mortal coil into wrathe form and sending his body slamming into the back wall.
If this were a muggle town, he would seem out of place as well as breaking the statute of secrecy, merely standing silently facing to the north west of his position in the dim cold morning air, despite not breaking this however he edged forward silently, eyeing his surroundings critically, eager to avoid detection, as he headed in the direction of the Potter Estate Manor, the last thing he wanted to do was to alert the ministry and by extension his fellow Death Eaters or even Dumbledore of his presence here.
Harry edged right behind Narcissa before wordlessly casting "Finite" to end his concealment, all the occupants jumped and fumbled for their wands before pointing them at him, leading him to giggle a bit, Narcissa took in Harry's changed form and his startling new golden eyes before gasping loudly in recognition.
Petunia had her back to me as I stood in the doorway, she was hunched over the sink scrubbing away at the tell tail signs of this mornings breakfast 'seems I missed breakfast maybe there is something in the fridge' I thought reaching for the fridge handle to check, when Petunia spun around and screamed at me hysterically.
"Nice one but the way mutt now the entire school knows of our conversation and excursion by default!" Snape sneered in outrage as he pushed the door open in front of them to glance in and see all eyes on the new arrivals.
"Headmaster, I had just finished my nights' rounds and had returned to my quarters to indulge in some wine and work on a new project I have undertaken for the benefactor you already know of" he said with sharp nod and quick meaningful glance at Albus who nodded and gestured for him to continue
'Ha take that useless Weasel's! He's finally mine!' He thought gleefully hoping it didn't show on his face in public, though from the looks Blaise and his mother gave him he could tell he failed to at least hide it from them, it was truly hard to keep the smile threatening to erupt on his face at bay and display the indifferent Malfoy mask he had to uphold but he managed nonetheless to at least appear calm despite feeling particularly giddy.
He wore a cloak of deep midnight blue that clashed horribly with the mop of greasy brown hair atop his head though accented nicely with his deep ice blue eyes peering out at her as she walked through the door to take a seat in front of him, he frowned for a minute as he placed his quill in its' ink pot.
Narcissa's eyes swivel to him before interrupting "Pansy we will not deny him only his mate can and that may kill him I am not entirely sure as nothing is known about the mates of a Dark Chimera by wizard folk anyway, you will leave you are unwanted here now you have caused such a scene and angered such a powerful being regardless of your affiliations to the boy, he is now above you in every sense, I will be writing to your parents for this indiscretion!" She shouts before taking off a piece of jewellery from her wrist and murmuring "portus" and throwing it at Pansy before she could even blink, it hooked its target and the foolish girl disappeared.
'If that old fool touches Harry, I am scared of what I would do in this frame of mind' Remus thought as he neared the Hogwarts boundary gate, he took a moment to centre himself as he gazed at the numerous looming turrets and the gargoyles they occupied, hoping he would at least not fail to protect his cub if no one else.
Kingsley wiped his forehead "Luckily her being there was enough to tip us off as well as her body language and her sugary lies, if we weren't there to prevent it I'm afraid for the children given the list is mostly of partial creatures and she has a vendetta against them" Sonia sighed in relief "Thank you Auror Shacklebolt, I will be in my office if you need to further investigate with Mr Diggle and Auror Black, though I suspect both will be leaving soon to speak with Dumbledore, good day to you!" She smiles, Kingsley just nods and walks away.
As they turned a corner into the corridor where the headmasters office stood behind the stationary stone gargoyle, they stopped and spun around to look at Albus, gesturing to whatever insane password the guardian gargoyle required, "ah, Cherry Millions Millions!" As he flicked his hands in the direction of the previously stationary guardian, the ground rumbled briefly as the gargoyle leapt aside to reveal its hidden spiralling staircase, they stared at him as if he was nuts "What bloody confectionary is that Dumbledore!?" Sirius said exasperated, "ah my boy it is a delightful muggle candy I have recently indulged in! I advise you to try some I have a bowl in my office as alas no one wants either my pimpermint imps or lemon drops when they come to call so I thought to add some variety for the tastebuds!" He chuckled as he led them into his office, "Please take a seat and start at the beginning because I am aware the Potter's would not let this little one out of their sight, he is a newborn and they are meant to be under my Fidelius Charm, so why is he here and not the others, explain Severus" he gestured towards the comfortable chintz chairs opposite his own and looked directly into Snape's cold obsidian gaze as he said this, to shut Sirius up before he burst into a rant, Severus handed the boy over to him to hold while he adhered to the headmasters request and gave his report of the events and why they were there in the first place.
” Teddy cried, wrapping his arms tightly around Malfoy’s torso and burying his head in the man’s chest. Malfoy wrapped his arms tightly around the boy, lifting him into his lap and tucking Teddy’s head into his shoulder, hushing him gently.
Harry froze, eyes flickering to his closed wardrobe, before he hesitantly looked towards Kreacher’s stumbling form. “Kreacher...what do you mean, my friend brought clothes?”
“Imagine my surprise upon discovering that Ginevra is actually a rather extraordinary witch. We happen to get along quite well. However, as I refuse to call her by that ghastly nickname of hers, I told her that I would not call her anything other than her proper name.” Draco grinned sharply, silver eyes twinkling. “Unless, of course, she would prefer that I continue to call her Weaslette.”
Draco’s pale eyebrows lifted, disappearing behind his surprisingly messy fringe, pink lips parting in surprise, “You are?”
“Whatever you say, Potter,” Malfoy’s voice called out behind him as he turned the corner, leaving Harry alone, standing in the middle of the sitting room.
He took a quick breath, trying to calm himself, before following Draco up the stairs. Listening to the sounds of Draco’s soft voice, rising and falling gently as he read
Harry’s mouth snapped shut at the high, terrified voice that screamed out. Teddy only sounded like this during his particularly frightening nightmares, and Harry instantly shifted focus to his godson.
“Oh, er...” Harry hesitated, eyes flickering as he looked at the abundance of vegetables growing before him. “Well, I’m not much of a cook. Any of it would be good, I think.”
Nodding, Harry leaned forward, gingerly lifting Teddy into his arms and standing slowly so as not to jostle him more than he had to. Teddy buried his head into Harry’s chest, trembling as his sobs became whimpers, interrupted by an occasional hiccup.
“Oh, no, love. Thank you.” Andromeda smiled softly, gently placing one hand against Malfoy’s pale cheek in a quick caress, before she turned to place a soft kiss to Teddy’s forehead. “I will see you tomorrow evening, darling.”
lunch. It isn’t even fully cooked!” Malfoy said firmly, placing his hands at his hips as he narrowed his eyes at Teddy. “Tedward, that crumble is very nearly
Harry groaned, rubbing a hand over his face. He knew he should have never introduced his godson to that muggle comic.
Harry relaxed in relief at Andromeda’s words. If Teddy was with his cousin, he would be fine—it was family, after all, not bloody Mal—
Harry finished washing the dishes and took a moment to gather himself as he dried his hands against the kitchen towel. Taking a deep breath, he placed the damp towel on top of the counter before following the sound of laughter to the sitting room.
Malfoy stood before him, calmly gazing at Harry, looking as if he had no care in the world, baring the spark in his mercurial eyes, his clenched fists shaking at his side.
“Oh...I thought you’d like him, honestly,” Ron frowned, “I mean...He’s a good bloke, far as I can tell. Besides, I have the feeling he’ll be around a lot more soon.”
Laughter echoed through the cottage halls from the direction of the sitting room, and Harry quickly made his way towards it. Gary meowed excitedly before leaping from Harry’s shoulder and running ahead.
Harry’s breath caught, his eyes widening at Teddy’s words. He swore he could hear a rush of breath on the opposite side of the garden, where Draco stood stiffly. Teddy simply smiled, cheeks flushed with his excitement, pale eyes twinkling.
“...quite well done, Tedward. Although I dare say we have some work to do before you can accomplish that particular morph,” came a familiar voice, tone warmer than Harry had ever heard before. Harry’s steps faltered, for surely that couldn’t belong to Malfoy...yet, he
“I must be off. Narcissa is expecting me early today.” As she passed Teddy, Andromeda leaned down to press a soft kiss to his cheek. “Be good, darling. I will see you tomorrow.”
She smiled kindly, reaching forward and grasping both of his hands between her own. “Perhaps. You, Andromeda...and Draco. I think that you are his pack.” Hermione stood on her tip-toes, pressing a soft kiss upon his cheek. “He wants you to be happy, Harry. That’s all. So instinctively, he is trying to make that happen.”
Teddy’s fingers reached for his legs, gently prodding at the limbs before looking up with a bright smile splitting his lips. “Much better!”
?” Harry laughed shrilly. His voice sounded higher than it normally was, nearly hysterical. “Oh my god, Ron. I don’t want to
“Sure,” Harry agreed, “I don’t think Andy thinks so, though. She wasn’t too pleased when we brought Gary back on Sunday. He’ll have to stay with me, and Teddy will just visit him on the weekends.”
“Yes, of course,” Harry hurried over towards Malfoy and Teddy. He focused on the cooktop, determined not to meet  Malfoy’s judgmental gaze. “So, er...what are we making?”
“Of course,” Harry agreed quickly, reaching for a knife before beginning to slice the tomatoes into thick slices and levitating them towards Malfoy.
George said that as long as you count to one, and don’t start until then, it isn’t against the rules.”
“Er...” Harry wrinkled his nose, a soft breath of laughter escaping him. He let go of Draco’s hand, reaching back to rub at the back of his neck instead. “Well, I thought that you two were together—after that photo in
Harry blinked, dumbfounded by the question. By the look in Andromeda’s eyes, he knew he was about to be interrogated in some way. But this was perhaps the strangest prelude to an interrogation he had ever experienced.
Turning around to clean up the remainder of their lunch, Harry cast a couple of charms around the kitchen so that they would not leave a mess behind upon their departure, before turning to look at what was left of the crumble.
Malfoy froze, eyes wide as he stared down at Harry’s hand, hovering between them. Harry watched, fascinated, as Malfoy’s throat worked, hesitating for a moment before raising his pale hand and grasping Harry’s own.
“I may have misinterpreted the situation, Potter. My apologies,” Draco started, his voice low and monotone. “If you have intentions towards Healer Montgomery, I regret to inform you that I will be unable to aid you in your endeavors. Furthermore, Healer Montgomery is in, as far as I am aware, a committed relationship with someone of the female persuasion.”
Ron huffed a laugh, “Of course. He’s a Healer in Training, Harry. And he’s specializing in Emergency Healing, so he’s normally in the Accident and Emergency Department whenever we have to go in after a raid.”
Teddy waved excitedly at Harry, cherubic cheeks flushed in his delight, before darting towards Draco, saying something that made the man throw his head back and laugh.
They stared at one another for a moment. It felt as if the air vibrated between them—nearly thrumming with tension. Harry lifted a shoulder in an awkward shrug, one side of his lips sheepishly pulling into a lopsided smile as he looked at Draco. “What do you say, Draco?”
Malfoy’s lips twitched with a grin, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly, before he turned and strode towards the doors.
Harry heaved a deep sigh as he Apparated back to Grimmauld Place on Saturday morning, his body aching as he tugged the apron from his body and vanished it with a wave of his hand.
Malfoy spluttered as he clutched at Harry’s sides, warm fingers digging into his skin in an effort to keep Harry from falling to the floor.
They stared at one another for a moment. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and glanced quickly at the floor in an attempt to prevent a wide grin from spreading across his face. Taking a quick breath, he lifted his gaze once more to Draco and offered what he hoped was a welcoming smile.
As Harry reached forward, clasping the glass in his own hands, their fingers brushed and Harry felt a thrill run up his spine.
Frowning, Harry recalled some of Teddy’s most recent morphs, “He’s blond a lot, I suppose. Sometimes his eyes will change—turn kind of hazel, almost grey.”
“Fine...” Harry chewed at his lip, glancing out of the window above the sink to gaze out at his garden as he gathered himself. “You were right...okay?”
“You think you know everything, don’t you, Potter?” Malfoy spat. The passivity with which he held himself previously had melted underneath his apparent fury. “Saint
Feeling someone watching him, Harry dragged his attention away from where he had been hypnotized by the scene.
In the quiet of the garden, birds singing above them, Harry took a moment to savor this. He focused first on Teddy’s hand, small and hidden, clasped gently within his own. Then, to Draco’s porcelain skin; a stark contrast against Harry’s own rich tone. Harry breathed in, rubbing his thumb over Draco’s hand, watching reverently as the delicate skin pulled beneath his own.
“Hello there, Harry,” Andromeda greeted him from where she sat, perched on the armchair nearest to the hearth. “Teddy and Draco are in the gardens.”
Ron coughed quietly, taking another deep sip of tea. Hermione narrowed her eyes, “What do you mean, he’s corrupting Teddy?”
Draco huffed a gentle laugh, running his fingers through Teddy’s curly blond hair. “Of course I will.” Silver eyes glanced towards Harry, a question hidden beneath the wary gaze.
As he walked away from Malfoy, Harry caught Andromeda watching them intently. Her lips twitched as she cocked an eyebrow at Harry in question. He merely shrugged in response, turning to look at the entrance to the kitchen as he heard Teddy storming down the stairs.
Brushing her fingers gently against Harry’s shoulder in farewell, Andromeda swept out of the sitting room.
“He has to go because it’s important, and it’s only goodbye for now,” Teddy sighed, kicking indignantly at the dirt.
“Well, Teddy is a metamorphmagus,” Hermione pointed out softly, “Are you certain he wasn’t helping Teddy practise?”
“Please, Harry?” Teddy had begged, his eyes widening, the color shifting slowly, faltering between different hues without settling on any one in particular. “
“No, I am talking!” she said firmly. “Jesse is protective of Draco—he has mentored him since Draco entered the training program. But they are
Draco breathed in sharply as Harry’s thumb ran over his nipple, and Harry quickly looked up, sharp grey eyes staring back at him.
“Hi!” Teddy grinned broadly, finally letting go of Harry’s hand as he walked further into the shop. “We want to see the Kneazles!”
Harry inhaled sharply. The warmth that had spread through him only moments before reignited, molten lava burning through his veins. His heart was thrumming loudly against his chest, and he was sure that Draco and Teddy would be able to hear it, but Draco kept reading
“Teddy being able to control his morph. When did that happen?” George inquired, leaning against the counter as he turned to focus on Harry.
!” Ginny rolled her eyes, jumping down from her perch on the counter. She folded her arms across her chest and leaned against it, instead, watching Harry carefully. “Seriously, though, Harry. What’s going on? No one has heard from you all week.”
Malfoy startled at the noise, speedily disentangling himself and shoving off of Harry, leaving him laying on the ground, dazed and confused.
“Already?” Harry asked hoarsely, eyes lingering on Draco’s pert arse as he walked by, trousers molded perfectly to its shape. His eyes roamed upwards until they met sparkling silver. Harry grimaced at being caught out, his cheeks flushing in embarrassment, though Draco simply watched him with an eyebrow raised, his left cheek slowly dimpling in amusement. “Er...”
“Do you remember what I said about pack hierarchy?” Hermione questioned, before quickly dismissing it with a frantic wave of her hand. “No, of course you don’t. Teddy may not be a werewolf, but his father was one. It is possible that some instincts that are inherent within werewolves may be woven into Teddy’s own genes.”
A soft sigh escaped Harry’s lips as he leaned back against the cool tile wall, shivering at the contrast from the steam of the water pouring over him.
Teddy’s laughter echoed inside of the cottage. It was just before lunch, so Teddy would surely be in the kitchen with Malfoy, helping to prepare whatever meal they would be having that day. Inhaling deeply, Harry rubbed his sweaty palms against his legs. He tugged his tight shirt further down, making sure that it did not show any of his midriff, before reaching for the door knob and entering the cottage.
him there. And for that reason alone, the Weasleys would accept him. Harry darted forward, placing a chaste kiss against Draco’s lips. “Please? I’d like it if you were there.”
, Harry!” Teddy squealed as the shop came into sight, owls perched in their cages outside; toads, snakes, rats, Kneazles, and various other magical companions on display in the windows, watching the passersby stroll down the cobblestone streets.
Draco sat in Teddy’s bed, his back resting against the headboard. Teddy’s arms were wrapped tightly around Draco’s torso, his head resting lightly atop his chest.
Harry hesitated as he watched them walk away, reeling from this new version of Malfoy. He was still the snarky, stuck up prat that Harry was well familiar with. Yet, with Teddy, he was shockingly caring and gentle. Malfoy was the one that Teddy reached out to when he was hurt, when he needed comfort...
“Harry, none of the evidence right now supports that Malfoy is doing anything untoward. Andromeda trusts him with Teddy. Doesn’t that say something?” Hermione questioned, sounding so much like a prosecutor that Harry was taken aback.
A voice calls out, echoing down a hallway. You turn your head, peering over the top of the sofa as footsteps begin to approach.
“How wonderful. We are happy to have lunch with you, dear. Teddy is with his cousin in the library but I am sure they will join us shortly.”
“Yes, of course,” Harry threw back the entirety of his tumbler, turning to gaze into the crackling fire. He nodded slowly, mumbling, “Cooking...yeah, that’s it.”
broom, ‘Mione,” Harry cut in, patting her shoulder lightly as she spluttered at Ron. “It only hovers a few feet from the ground. He’ll be fine. Besides, it’ll be good for him to practise before the day camp in a couple of weeks.”
Malfoy’s pale cheeks were lightly flushed, his thin lips curling in a genuine smile, silver eyes glimmering with amusement as he stared down at Teddy.
Ginny turned towards Draco and raised one brow, lips curling roguishly as she lifted a hand. Draco’s eyes sparkled and he smirked before gracefully reaching forward to grasp her hand in his, resting the other against the small of his back. He lifted her hand, placing a kiss to her fingers.
were, trying to dance with Patil,” Malfoy chuckled to himself, “You looked like a moron, Potter. An absolute buffoon. No idea what you were doing then, just as you have no idea what to do now.”
“Oh, shut it, you prat,” Harry chuckled, kicking his pants away before jumping back onto the bed and tackling Draco.
Andromeda merely hummed, reaching for Teddy’s hand and turning her back to Harry, “Come now, Teddy. Why don’t we finish packing for your weekend with Harry?”
Malfoy was focused on Teddy, brows furrowed in contemplation and eyes narrowed as he considered the child. If he were anyone but Malfoy, Harry would think that he looked suspicious. But surely Malfoy wouldn’t be suspicious of Teddy...if anything, he was teaching Teddy his devious ways...right?
Harry put on a burst of speed, the likes of which he did not think he had ever matched before, in an effort to reach Teddy in time.
“Ah, a splendid choice!” The man slowly walked from behind the counter, gesturing towards the side of the shop. “Our finest Kneazles are right this way, young man.”
Harry felt bereft as if something—or someone—were missing. He kept looking to his side, hoping to see a blond head standing next to him, only to turn back to the pitch disappointed.
Ron nodded, his eyes crinkling as he looked up at Harry and took a long drink from his Firewhisky, “I reckon he might be, mate.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, but I thought it was rather obvious! I mean, we weren’t exactly hiding anything at the camp this weekend,” Ginny exclaimed, leaning back in her chair and throwing her hands to her sides.
“That’s too bad, Tedward,” Harry replied, ignoring when he saw Draco stiffen at his side upon hearing the nickname. “It’s time for bed. Maybe Draco will even read you a story—since he does it so much better than I do, after all.”
could meet him. The Kneazle, meanwhile, had a mind of his own and only cooperated with Teddy, largely ignoring Harry’s requests.
Harry blinked dumbly. He very rarely recalled Hermione’s cases while she was discussing them, let alone weeks later. With an exasperated sigh, Hermione rolled her eyes.
As he looked back at Teddy, Harry realized that the only way this would end with his godson happy would be if Harry apologized...to
“Hey, Tedward,” Draco said softly, kneeling beside Harry so that he could look Teddy in his bright green eyes. “We’re okay, I promise. Just some bruises—like when you fell earlier this week, remember?”
Draco laughed, throwing an amused glance over his shoulder at Harry and winking before turning back to Teddy. Harry bit his lip, following them out of the sitting room, wishing he could prevent the heat from rushing to his cheeks.
Harry melted against Draco as his release swept through him. His lips parted on a silent scream, stars bursting behind his eyelids. After what felt like eons, he surfaced to find himself laying in a heap on top of his bedsheets while Draco tenderly wiped a wet flannel across his body.
“Alright, then,” Andromeda gracefully stood from her seat, “We will discuss it when I return tomorrow.”
Harry snorted, grumbling beneath his breath, “When does Malfoy ever have any obligations other than counting his galleons?”
Draco smiled—a small, almost shy curl of his lips—as he stepped into the flames, “Good night, Harry.”
“I am washing the dishes, Potter,” he drawled, blinking innocently. “If I am washing them incorrectly, you are more than welcome to take over.”
Malfoy’s face softened and flushed slightly. The color suited him, Harry couldn’t help but think, adding some life to his porcelain skin, before he quickly shook his head and took a step towards Malfoy.
Hermione was wrong, surely. Teddy’s instincts were not playing any part in this, no matter what her theories led her to believe.
After all, Harry thought, both Draco and Ginny were obviously mischievous gits who were up to no good. They would surely only cause chaos if they worked together...
An elderly man stood behind a counter at the back of the shop and smiled kindly at them, “Welcome. What companion are you searching for today?”
“I guess,” Teddy sighed. He scuffed one foot lethargically against the floor, holding a hand out for Harry to grasp.
the best.” His eyes widened once more in excitement as he spun towards Harry, evidently dismissing any lecture he had just received. “And he
beneath her breath. Ron let out a slow sigh, lifting his wine to his lips to take a long sip while watching Harry.
But it didn’t matter what he wanted, Harry reminded himself. He needed to focus on Teddy, and how important it was to him that both his godfather and cousin were by his side during his first Quidditch Camp. He and Draco had just started getting along, and Harry could already see how happy it made Teddy. He promised himself that he wouldn’t let his feelings for Draco get in the way of that.
, Draco. I don’t want to rush into this. It’s not just about sex, for me.” He swallowed, looking up at Draco through his lashes. “I want—I
Malfoy’s shoulders tensed. Harry could see his fingers grasping the counter, knuckles white with the strength of his grip, before suddenly relaxing and falling to his side as Malfoy spun around to face Harry.
Draco chuckled, “Very well.” As the flames roared to life, Draco turned to glance over his shoulder. The green flames highlighted his sharp features, softening them in the evening light.
Harry took a jolting step forwards, fingers hesitating in front of Draco. He desperately wanted to reach for the other man, to pull him forward. But he had to be sure.
“No!” Teddy cried, though his adamance was rather diminished due to it being stated on the end of his yawn. “I’m awake. We can play again!”
“Yes! He was crying, Draco!” Harry threw his hands in the air, huffing in defeat. “He wouldn’t let me look at it—he kept screaming for you! What was I supposed to do, just leave him there? No!” He took a deep breath, biting his lips between his teeth before shrugging. “He wanted
Harry stormed down the hallway. He could hear Andromeda’s voice call his name behind him but was too focused on confronting Malfoy to stop. The doors to the library were closed, but a sudden peal of laughter echoed out. Harry hesitated for a moment—that was Teddy laughing, he knew, so perhaps nothing bad was happening—before shrugging it off, pushing open the doors and stepping inside.
Harry inhaled sharply. His shocking dismissal from the Aurors had not been private, but rather had been splashed across the papers, as everyone speculated on how The Chosen One refused to follow orders and always jumped to conclusions. That had been three years ago, however, and since then his endeavors had been kept quiet. Jumping from one job to another, Harry’s inadequacies were well known to those close to him, but kept from the gossip columns. That Malfoy knew of them could only mean he had forced Harry’s secrets from someone he trusted—Andromeda and Teddy.
You turn your head and meet questioning eyes—brown and blue, burning into you, searching for something you cannot give—before blinking, unfocused, and looking away. Turning into the rich skin next to you, brushing your lips against the salty flesh.
Draco blinked slowly as he stared at Harry, silver eyes searching as their gaze met and held. For a moment, no one moved. Then, hesitantly, Draco tilted his head in a subtle nod.
Andromeda hummed, narrowing her eyes as she observed Harry. “Well, so long as we are clear that Gary is to reside at Grimmauld Place, I suppose there is no harm.”
Hermione hesitated for a moment, narrowing her eyes in thought, whispering as if to herself, “I suspect that he may also instinctively do what he could to ensure that those bonds do, in fact, strengthen—rather than break.”
“Perhaps we will need to consider you spending more time with your godfather in the future, then,” Andromeda pondered aloud.
Malfoy ran his hand soothingly through Teddy’s turquoise hair, fingers tangling in the messy strands. “It’s okay, darling,” he whispered, “I’ve got you. Let’s go get you healed, shall we?”
“Oh!” Teddy looked pleadingly up at Harry, specks of silver beginning to glimmer in his emerald eyes. “Please, Harry, can he?”
Out of the corners of his eye, Harry could see Draco begin to part his lips, some sort of explanation ready to calm the boy. Before Draco had a chance to speak, however, Harry interjected.
Between attending Quidditch Camp each month, as well as flying regularly with Draco and Harry, Teddy was already mastering his broom. Draco had commented the other night as they lay in bed that they may need to take the training charms off soon—though Harry was more reluctant to do so.
“Of course,” Harry smiled crookedly, shrugging one shoulder in an awkward movement. “There’s plenty of room. And Kreacher made up the guest rooms—” He chuckled before recognizing the implication, eyes widening as he looked frantically at Draco. “—not that you have to stay over, of course! It’s just that...there’s room, is all. If you want to come over. To visit. Teddy. To visit Teddy, while he is staying...with me.”
“Alright...how about a rematch, then?” Harry raised an eyebrow, smirking at Teddy. He nodded towards a bed of lilies. “First to reach the lilies and then come back to the lemon tree wins.”
Harry watched Malfoy for a few more moments, chewing at his bottom lip. He could not deny that Malfoy was certainly different now—not after seeing him interacting with Teddy, after seeing the way his smile lit up his face.
“Jesse?” Draco asked, pushing himself up so that he was straddling Harry’s hips. Harry’s face flushed and he averted his eyes—he didn’t need Draco’s boyfriend seeing another man beneath his partner and
Harry’s lips twitched and he shook his head before tearing his toasty in two, dipping one half into his soup and lifting it to his mouth. Chewing his rather overabundant mouthful of toasty, Harry looked up to catch Malfoy’s gaze. The man was staring at him, eyes narrowed and focused on Harry’s bulging cheeks.
“Of course.” Slowly, the man hobbled toward the barrier. He laid a hand against the surface, raising a grey brow at Teddy, a smile tugging on his lips. “Would you like to meet him?”
“Er...well, sure. But we normally don’t leave until later. Are you sure you didn’t still want to spend time with...with your cousin?”
The door to the kitchen slammed open and Malfoy stepped through. A flush sat high upon his porcelain cheeks, his normally pristine blond hair a mess as his sharp gaze locked onto Teddy immediately.
“Oh, my!” Andromeda gasped. A deep chuckle sounded from within the room, though Harry refused to acknowledge who it came from.
“It’s not denial. I don’t know why you don’t get it, but Malfoy is up to something. He must be!” Harry proclaimed. “Just last weekend, he was in the library with Teddy, and Teddy was
Draco paused, bright eyes boring into Harry’s own. After a moment, his eyes softened, dimple crinkling his cheek as he spoke, “You’re sure.”
His back hit the soft cushion of his bed before the air rushed out of his lungs as Draco landed on top of him.
He stops in front of you, resting his hands beside your face, caging you in. His voice is low, sure—a threat. “You’d be dead without me, Draco.”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry, scoffing as he rolled his eyes—rather dramatically, if Harry dared to say—before turning to make sure that the crumble was spread evenly over the blackcurrant. “Yes, Potter. I would have you know that I am a particularly accomplished baker, and crumble just so happens to be one of my specialties.”
Teddy sniffed, offering a shaky smile as wet eyes stared up at Malfoy. Harry couldn’t move, standing in the entryway, watching the two from a distance.
Teddy rolled his eyes, pursing his lips as his hair began to lighten. “Fine,” he grumbled, shifting on his training broom to get into position, “Can we go?”
Ron groaned, rubbing his hands roughly across his face. “Mate, I love you. You know that I do. But you need to bloody
“Oh!” Harry glanced away, grimacing, “Well, er...we have Sunday Brunch at the Burrow every weekend.”
Just as he was about to dig into the meal, Harry glanced at Andromeda and paused. She raised an inquisitive brow, her gaze calculating as she observed him. He raised both of his own in response, tilting his head in question.
Letting out an anguished cry, Teddy’s morph instantly fell to reveal his tanned skin, eyes filling with tears as his hands clutched at the scratches across his cheek.
“Yes, of course,” Harry nodded, grinning at Teddy’s enthusiasm. He could not deny that the display had been beautiful. And yet, despite the evident beauty and grace of the waltz that Teddy and Malfoy had just danced, Harry could not help but question, “But...why learn how to
“Draco is helping me practise my morph!” Teddy nearly vibrated with his excitement as he looked between Harry and Malfoy. Harry clenched his jaw, forcing a smile. He didn’t want Teddy to worry.
against his bicep. He jumped back, glaring at Ginny and clutching at his throbbing arm.“Ouch! Bloody hell, Gin! What was that for!?”
“Yeah, I am,” Harry nodded, turning Draco’s hands over in his own, his thumb rubbing soothing circles over the center of Draco’s palm. He hesitated, furrowing his brows for a moment, before deciding that Ginny had been right—
“Ginny asked me to help with the camp. They needed someone here in case of—” Jesse chuckled, his voice deep and rich, and Harry frowned. “Well, in case of something like this happening. Although I am certain that she suspected I would need to tend to the children, not to two grown wizards.” He winked at Draco before turning to offer his hand to Harry.
“Tedward,” Malfoy sighed, kneeling down so that he was eye level with the boy, “I promise you, Gary is not mad at you. He was just frightened, and felt badly that he hurt you. I am sure that he is eager to see that you are okay and that you still love him.”
!” Harry threw his hands into the air in exasperation. “Andy, he is manipulating you! He’s using Teddy for his own nefarious purposes! How can you not see that?”
, do you hear yourself mate?” Ron huffed, rolling his eyes so dramatically that his head followed the movement.
Draco, leaning against the headboard of Teddy’s bed, fingers gently threading through the boy’s hair, while Teddy curled up against his side.
Harry licked his lips, unceremoniously tugging the remainder of Draco’s trousers and pants from his body as he stared down at Draco—spread wantonly across his bed, cheeks flushed and a smirk tugging at his lips, cheeks dimpling handsomely.
Hands began to linger, hips rolling against one another, and before long Draco’s thighs tightened around Harry’s waist with such force that he flipped them, pressing Harry firmly into the sheets. Draco ran his hands up Harry’s arms, fingers grasping at his wrists and holding them against the pillows.
Malfoy cleared his throat quietly, gazing down at Teddy with a fond smile, “Of course not, Tedward. I am due at St. Mungo’s early today, so there is no inconvenience on my part.”
As he approached the cottage, Harry could hear the laughter of his godson echoing throughout the home, muffled slightly by the soft swell of music drifting through open windows.
Teddy simply nodded, stepping forward and placing his hands against Harry’s back as he began to push Harry forward, towards Malfoy.
“An apple rhubarb crumble and a blackcurrant crumble,” Malfoy retorted, his voice firm, steady with no hint of inflection.
Harry narrowed his eyes as he shoved a mouthful of eggs into his mouth. He focused on chewing for a moment, before mumbling, “They’re not blood traitors.”
Harry gaped between the two of them. He felt like he was in an alternate universe. Nothing made sense.
“Well,” Hermione exhaled slowly, tilting her head as she peered at him, “did you ask him what he was doing there?”
Draco’s eyes searched Harry’s for a few seconds, then abruptly, his shoulders relaxed. He laughed, a sharp, bright sound, “Merlin, you really
Harry rushed towards the young welcomewitch behind the lobby desk, Teddy’s soft whimpers muffled by his chest.
Harry wavered, observing the Kneazle as it curled up contentedly in Teddy’s lap. He hadn’t had any other pets or familiars live with him since Hedwig, and hadn’t thought he wanted another one at all. If he had, he certainly never considered having a Kneazle. While he did not dislike the creatures, his experiences with Crookshanks had never endeared the species to him.
Her lips were pursed together, eyebrows raised in exasperation as she stared at him. Andromeda shook her head and sighed, “Must you, Harry?”
’s notorious Society column, was Malfoy in all of his glory—shirking any responsibilities he may have to gallivant around, throwing himself at whomever he pleased.
read the title. Harry rolled his eyes—trust Malfoy to throw money at everyone in an effort to make up for his past, rather than actually doing anything.
And through it all, Harry had to bite his lip and force a grin, because if he didn’t Andromeda would find out and she would...well, Harry wasn’t exactly sure what she would do, but he would really rather not find out. It was also obvious that Teddy adored Malfoy. As confusing as it was, Harry couldn’t bring himself to crush his godson’s love of his cousin.
“What if...” Teddy began slowly, fingers twisting around the Kneazle’s tail. “What if we kept him at your house?”
“Maybe he was just spending time with his family,” Hermione shrugged, reaching for her tea and taking a slow sip as she observed Harry over the rim. Ron continued to stare intently out of the window, as if the World Cup were being played in his backyard and he couldn’t be bothered with anything else.
“Well...er,” Harry spluttered, shrugging awkwardly. He could do this. For Teddy. “I was just wondering...how is training going? You know...at St. Mungo’s?”
“Er...” Harry swallowed, shifting as he looked between Teddy and Malfoy, before shrugging awkwardly, “Well, alright then.”
that I don’t deserve you. I was a right tit when I saw you at Andy’s those first few times, and I shouldn’t have been. All of my friends tried to tell me, but I didn’t see it until I spent more time with you—”
“I should be going, as well,” Draco said, pushing himself from the wall and sauntering towards the hearth. Harry inhaled deeply as he passed, reveling in the fresh scent of citrus that he recognized as
“Did he, now?” A chuckle echoed between the bookshelves, deeper than Harry would have expected. “Well, we will definitely have to work on your reptilian features so that you can surprise him.”
Instantly, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, his pupils dilating as he stared at Harry. His lips turned up in a familiar sneer as he huffed out a hoarse laugh, “You wish, Potter.”
He had thanked Rosmerta for the opportunity at the end of his shift the previous evening, but was confident in his decision that working at the Hogsmeade pub was
he always was. But maybe, if his closest friends and family seemed to believe that Malfoy was better than before, it wasn’t something quite as nefarious as Harry had originally thought?
sounded in his ear as they began to glide across the floor. His fingers dug into Harry’s hips, gently guiding him as he pleased, leading Harry as they danced.
Teddy sheepishly glanced up at Draco, still scuffing his shoes through the dirt. His hair shimmered, shifting to a darker shade of turquoise, and as he raised his eyes they were a brilliant green, “Do you really have to go?”
“Teddy is adjusting quite well to Andromeda moving to France,” Hermione observed as she sat beside Harry on the steps of the Burrow’s porch, overlooking the gardens and the pickup game of Quidditch unfolding there.
Harry could not stop the grin from spreading across his face. He glanced down, teeth at his lower lip before releasing it and stepping towards Malfoy, “Well, then. Show me what you’ve got, Malfoy.”
“What the—” Draco scrambled above Harry, knees straddling Harry’s hips and hands framing his head as he looked around, eyes wide. Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing as Draco observed the room, realization slowly dawning across his face. His gaze slid over Harry’s form, trapped beneath him, eyes heating as he drawled, “Harry...did you just Apparate us to your bedroom—? No, to your
“Draco...?” Harry started, his eyes on Teddy flying after the other boy, maneuvering his broom with more skill than Harry had ever seen. “Have you and Teddy been flying? Or, rather...have you been teaching Teddy to fly?”
“Oh, right. Of course,” Harry nodded, shoving his fists into the pockets of his jeans and looking away, focusing his gaze on his godson instead.
The door slammed behind Teddy, and the library was filled with an awkward silence for a few moments before Harry spun around. He stalked towards Malfoy, hand reaching for the comfort of his wand as he snarled.
Harry chuckled and walked towards Teddy, running his fingers through messy turquoise hair, “Of course. Go ahead and say goodbye, then we can head to Grimmauld.”
?” Teddy demanded. He shoved the Pygmy Puff towards George, who scrambled to grab ahold of the small creature lest it fall to the floor, before spinning to stare up at Harry. “You
“Harry, you’re early,” she glanced briefly at Malfoy before turning and gracing Harry with a bright smile, enveloping him in a gentle hug, “Teddy is washing up from lunch. He was rather a mess, but will be down shortly.”
Harry moaned around Draco, closing his eyes and letting him lose himself in the heaviness of Draco’s cock against his tongue, the breathy sounds of Draco’s pleasure.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, staring at the ceiling as he mumbled, “Merlin, save me.” One pale hand ran through his platinum hair, ruffling it from its pristine coif. “Fine. For your information, Potter, I know this because it is my
With a quick shake of his head, dismissing his sudden confusion, Harry made his way to the kitchen to make some hot cocoa—Teddy’s favorite drink before bed. He summoned three mugs, carefully pouring the sweet drink into each, before making his way upstairs, the mugs of cocoa floating behind him.
Andromeda smiled softly at her grandson before turning her gaze on Malfoy, “And I will see you on Tuesday for tea?”
Malfoy huffed loudly, rolling his eyes once more as he turned to fix the blackcurrant crumble that Teddy had dug into, though Harry swore he saw the other man’s lips twitch in what might have been a smile.
“Yes, Harry,” Ginny laughed quietly, her aggressive stance melting as she grinned at him, “It really was such a success! All of the parents asked if there would be another one. But with our season starting soon, we don’t know how much time we will have to organize it, even if it is just one weekend a month. We need someone to take the lead, and I think you would be perfect for it!”
matter what Malfoy thought—even if it did, the other man had accepted Harry arriving early the week before.
“Wh—no! There’s nothing weird about that,” Harry shook his head jerkily as he looked between his friends. “You know that he’s been working on his morphing with Draco. He still has trouble controlling it, is all.”
“Can we go say hello to George?” Teddy asked as they walked down to cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley the next morning. His little hand clutched a cone from Fortescue’s, caramel and pistachio ice cream melting over his sticky fingers.
Harry inhaled shallowly as he stared at the back of his godson mid-morph before gasping out, “Teddy?”
“Well...I mean, he didn’t seem to particularly like me, did he?” Harry started, lifting his shoulders in an awkward shrug. “And I don’t blame him, I guess.”
“You know—” George interjected, eyebrows raised in astonishment as he watched Teddy “—I think it’s because Harry has something even better in store for you.”
Andromeda pursed her lips together, corners twitching as if she was holding back laughter. “Well, then. Since you are here, Harry, why don’t you help prepare lunch?”
Ginny and Angelina stilled behind Teddy, gazing in confusion as they looked at the child before Ginny grinned amusedly and leaned over to whisper something in Angelina’s ear.
Harry inhaled sharply as Draco reached for his wand, whispering soft incantations, his wrist moving gracefully with the movements of the charms.
Teddy was laughing delightedly, his head thrown back in mirth as he swayed to the music. His arms were wrapped tightly around Malfoy’s hips, feet settled atop Malfoy’s shoes, as Malfoy guided them across the empty floor.
Without a second glance, Teddy scrambled out of the sitting room, his loud footsteps echoing throughout the halls as he made his way up to his room to prepare for bed.
, per se, but surely Harry should still be there as much as he could when Malfoy was with Teddy. Just in case, he thought.
, he couldn’t. Andy, he has always hated me! We may be friends now, but—he can’t—it’s not possible...right?”
“Yes, I just...” Harry took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, before spitting out, “He’s such a
They were both staring at him. Hermione’s eyes were narrowed, a thoughtful look on her face, as if she had just reached a rather intriguing hypothesis. Ron, meanwhile, was staring at Harry incredulously, lips parted and nose scrunched.
Harry narrowed his eyes as he observed his grandson. There was a mischievous spark in those silver eyes—it must have come directly from both Remus and Tonks, pranksters the both of them.
“Damnit, Potter!” Malfoy groaned as he began to untangle himself from Harry’s limbs, “You have no more skill than you did in fourth year! No wonder you think the waltz is outdated, you have two bloody left feet!”
. And everyone knows that is the best!” Teddy nodded to himself, sure of his place in Harry’s life. Harry chuckled; he couldn’t deny Teddy’s importance.
than Harry expected—which he doubted, since Malfoy had never seemed to be a particularly powerful a wizard—or something else was going on to make Andromeda not only allow Malfoy to be a part of Teddy’s life, but to defend him with such conviction.
Draco was waiting in front of the hearth, eyes roaming over the room, still wearing his lime green Healer's robes.
“Can we practice turns?” Teddy asked. His small hands were grasping tightly to his broom, keeping it steady in the breeze that lifted him in soft waves, riding the currents in the air.
myself with? Andy, Malfoy is supposed to be with Teddy on Saturday mornings, so you can get ready to visit Narcissa. What in the name of Merlin could be more important to him? God, Andy, if you didn’t realize Malfoy was bad news before, then
Malfoy’s silver eyes were soft as he gazed down at Teddy, whose brown hair shone in the morning light, creating a halo around his crown, emerald eyes sparkling as he looked up at his cousin.
The only hobby he could do here in his spare time was his art. Art had always been something he was interested in. As a child his father had wanted him to study some wizarding artists so he could impress people in the future with his knowledge. Lucius had an art dealer who had always kept him up to date with the latest ‘must have’ pieces to purchase so that they could make an impression on anyone that came to the Manor. Lucius would also give expensive pieces to people who he wanted to collect favours from at a later date but then man had never actually appreciated the work as Draco had done.
The first thing he became aware of was how dizzy he was when he opened his eyes. He closed them, counted to ten and opened them again much slower. That was better.
He went up to Harry’s office and knocked on the door but there was no answer. He opened it anyway and peered in cautiously. What he saw made him smile and shake his head. Harry was asleep at his desk surrounded by pages of scribbled notes on the book, an employee handbook and documents from the Ministry and Draco’s letter from earlier. Harry’s desk really was a mess, he’d have to do something about that but now was not the time. Harry had clearly been too tired to attempt looking through the Ministry stuff having had no sleep last night.
Draco didn’t really give anything away in his expression and Harry thought it was because he honestly didn’t really know how he felt about the situation.
I just wanted to apologise for just stopping to update this story and I wanted to say thank you for all the lovely comments I have been receiving in my inbox.
Sure enough Harry appeared out of thin air folding up the material of his cloak in his hands as he did so. Draco kept his eyes fixed on his mother whose eyes went comically wide.
His mother was considering this and she looked up to meet Draco’s eyes. Her mask had shattered and Draco could see her eyes were soft and thoughtful.
Harry shifted awkwardly, worried that Ron would ask that. “Yeah he’s fine he took it really well. I care about him a lot but we were never in love and you know he never wants to settle down and all that stuff…”
Then he felt the anger dissipate from him and he just felt exhausted. He sighed and collapsed back onto the bed.
Just then his Mother walked in and looked both of them up and down critically. “Goodness, I feel quite overdressed.” She said in a snobbish tone.
“I have an issue with control, you’re right.” He started. “I need to separate what constitutes having control over someone and what is guiding their decisions in a positive way, like you said. You need to work out a way of separating an unhealthy need to save everyone no matter what it might cost you personally and the desire to help people. You’re one of the kindest people I’ve ever known, Harry. The fact that you like helping people is what makes you who you are and I don’t want you to lose that... But if you can’t separate the two then I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be employed as an auror, even if it is freelance.”
He then realised that he didn’t even know where to buy food from, it was the one thing he’d never thought about. What do wizarding families that don’t have house elves do? Do they buy food from muggle supermarkets? He really couldn’t see himself doing that even if he knew how to cook and what to buy. Did a wizarding food shop even exist? Did they accept owl orders? He doubted he could even afford the ingredients he was used to though. He thought he had everything under control. What if he couldn’t do this? What if he failed at life on his own?
“He just gets jealous that he can’t keep up with you!” Fred said reaching over and giving Harry’s biceps a suggestive squeeze.
It was the smells coming from the fruit stalls, the spice market and the little food carts that were cooking up local delicacies on the spot. It was the sounds coming from the vendors passionately selling their products in French, English and other languages that Harry didn’t even recognise sometimes. It was the vibrant bright colours of all the stalls designed to attract attention. It was in all the handcrafted items with different materials that you reach out and touch.
Harry finished the rest of the amber liquid in the glass. He needed that. In fact he felt like he needed another one honestly but he’d seen the look on Draco’s face when he poured it and he remembered that he still had to pick up Teddy from school later.
“Fine!” Harry snapped back playfully. “Well if you think you can get better elsewhere then be my guest.”
The tears wouldn’t be sad tears, they would be happy tears, it was just all a bit overwhelming right now.
There was also the issue of the time turner which Harry hadn’t included in the book either. He didn’t really give away the details of how Sirius and Buckbeak escaped or who was responsible, just that they did. Draco had been a bit annoyed at that too. “I can’t believe they gave Granger a time turner, you three were always getting special treatments, it’s ridiculous. Lucius was so cross at me for never being the top in our year and he was livid when he found out she was doing more subjects than me. I didn’t understand how it was possible because my timetable was full.”
“Yeah I guess I’d like that, just don’t really know where to buy stuff from.” Draco said feeling relaxed and forgetting that Harry wasn’t Blaise or Daphne.
It still terrified him really, how deeply he cared for Harry, how deeply he relied on him and this connection they had. He knew that Harry had the potential to break his heart and the thought of that was enough sometimes to make him want to run away from it all just so that Harry wouldn’t have the chance. Which was totally stupid really as if he ran away from the best thing that ever happened to him then he would just be breaking his own heart. So yes, he could get his heart broken but he’d know that going into this and so far the risk had paid off. He knew what it was like to be kissed by Harry Potter, to feel asleep next to him, to laugh with him, cook with him, to cuddle him naked and there was still more to discover about life with him so right now he was more excited than scared.
But then Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a second. When he opened them they were back to normal, the intensity behind them was gone and Draco knew the moment was over… for now. He would no doubt have another wank at the image later but for now it wasn’t what Harry wanted, what he needed.
Blaise gave a tiny little laugh and shook his head sadly. “You both are you idiot, it’s the three of us against the world right?” He said, giving Draco a small smile.
Blaise looked like he was enjoying himself immensely. “And is this mystery man the only one who you’ve, erm, made full use of your private box with?”
Daphne raised his eyebrows at him. “I didn’t mean it like that, I’m not some stupid fan girl Draco give me more credit than that.” She paused and then carried on in a more serious tone. “I meant I like him, he’s different now, not like I remember him being at school at all. He knew about the shop because he was at the Weasley shop and he saw it out the window, I guess they’re good friends. He honestly was complimentary and she said he wanted a bespoke gift basket. I think he was genuine.”
“Er, yes, sorry. I did try but, erm, well he technically had a life sentence before so it probably was a bit too much to hope for.” Leo said awkwardly.
Draco smiled slightly and stepped towards him. “Harry, I'm pretty confident I would enjoy anything you did.” He said seductively but then turned slightly more serious. “But you can relax, I did mean it when I said I wanted to take things slow, not crazy slow, I want to be with you but I just don’t want to rush anything. This is all new to me and I want us to enjoy every step.”
After breakfast Narcissa said her goodbyes but she assured them both that she wanted regular dinner invitations and that she would be seeing them soon. They were left in no doubt that she wanted to be part of their life together which was nice, even if it was said in a slightly threatening way. Harry politely wished her well on the start of her building plans and said honestly that he was looking forward to seeing her new home when it was finished. He also said genuinely that he really hoped she enjoyed the time with her sister  and joked that part of him was jealous that she would be getting to spend a lot more time with Teddy.
Just for a moment he had thought he heard a hint of emotion in her voice during her confession. It was true really, she had failed him. He had often thought so if he was honest and was still rather bitter towards her for it. He had frequently wondered why he wasn’t a good enough son that she would always side with Lucius over him. She had always put her wifely duties above her motherly duties. He’d always wanted her to just be a mother to him, to just show him some kind of affection. At times he had blamed himself, at times he had blamed her but mostly he had blamed Lucius as that was easier.
He used the pretence of checking on the garlic bread to look away but carried on speaking as he did so. “There is a wine cellar in the basement, next to where the old kitchen was. There’s loads down there, really old bottles I’m guessing... I’ve never really looked at them before, erm, to be honest, I usually grab whatever is nearest but er, well I was intrigued after Sunday, so I, er, asked Kreacher to help me look for some of this and turns out we have about 6 boxes of the stuff. It’s slightly too sweet for me if I’m honest but I can see why you like it. You can take a box with you if you like… well, erm, only if you want, but er, well I’m sure you have better.”
“Uncle Harry told Miss Violet that his boy-fr-iend-” Teddy said, concentrating hard on the word to get it right. “- wouldn’t like it.”
The good news is that Harry’s call for backup had worked and Ron was very grateful for it as he just hadn’t had a chance to do that yet. The other auror teams had arrived a split second after Harry had lost consciousness and together they had successfully apprehended the criminal underground potions gang. They were now all in Ministry holding cells awaiting their trials and evidence was being gathered ready for those with the British auror force working alongside the Irish one.
“I just, erm, I wanted to know what to say to Teddy if they asked who they were on the tapestry.” He said carefully. It was the truth but he also had another reason for asking.
Daphne gave an easy carefree laugh that Harry liked. Daphne obviously had a good upbringing and liked the finer things in life but then she wasn’t stiff or overly formal and didn’t seem like a snob.
“Thanks, you too.” Draco said, giving a warm smile and then disappearing under the cloak before he even opened the front door.
“I’ll have to ask your Granny and see what she says but you might be able to come to my house next week.” He said slowly. “You have just over a week to do your homework anyway so either way I can work on it with you when I pick you up next Wednesday if you like?”
“I know Harry. It’s ok.” Draco reassured him. “I’m really glad you had them too. Obviously I didn’t exactly
Potter looked slightly flushed again which Draco found amusing, clearly he wasn’t great at talking about these things.
Harry was still looking through the open kitchen door towards Fred’s room. It was weird not to just go in and see him but he didn’t know what a normal friend was supposed to do in this situation.
This was my first ever story and it still means a lot to me but the other stories I had slowly embedded themselves more in my heart and I would rather concentrate on those.
There is quite a lot of swearing in this chapter but it is rated M so figured that would be fine and things also heat up a little ;)
Surprisingly Blaise had contacted Draco after the war and made the effort to reconnect with him, he was the only one that did. They’d exchanged letters and occasionally Blaise had even come to visit Draco in France. Once Daphne had even come too and Draco found himself enjoying her company even though they’d hardly exchanged two words together at school. It was nice to know that moving back to England he would have one or possibly even two friendly faces. Over the past two years since moving back to Wiltshire both Blaise and Daphne have proven to be the first real friends Draco has ever had. It took him a while to learn to trust them and open up to them. At first he was just sticking to his plan and coping with all his problems on his own but he had started to see the benefits in having people he could talk to.
Kreacher finally stood up and held his arms out. “Please allow Kreacher to take your cloaks for you.”
In fact Draco filled his thoughts as he finished off the rest of the owl orders that afternoon. It was probably just because he was bored that was all. It didn’t mean anything. He blamed George for putting ideas in his head.
“Well again, I hadn't really thought about it, the idea just came to me tonight.” Potter said running this hand through that damn hair.
“Fine! Let’s just get to the damn box before more people show up!” Harry said dramatically but Draco noticed a tiny hint of a smile flash through his expression before he turned around and led Blaise around the edge of the stadium towards the VIP entrance.
“I have been doing a lot of thinking and yeah it relates to everything you’ve said in the past couple of weeks I guess. I’ve been living my life how everyone expected me to and putting the Ministry first, putting everyone else first not really thinking about what I actually wanted, and erm, now I’m starting to think about how I want my life to look like now that I have the time…” He trailed off wondering if this was the best way to start afterall.
“Is this where you tell me to cure my hangover by carrying on drinking? Because I’m OK with that.” Potter chuckled as he lent down onto the bar top.
Harry laughed. “Yes George of course, don’t sound so surprised. She’s not the stuck up snobby pure-blood Slytherin witch that people might think she is.”
“Before I would have just gone charging straight in not even thinking, I would have just acted… but today I did stop, I did think. I told you my idea, gave us the opportunity to discuss it and I listened when you said no. That’s progress for me.” Harry said with a kind of feeble smile. “And you know what made me do that?”
Soon conversation turned to Hermione’s first day back at work and Molly wanting to hear all about her eldest Grandchild’s first day at school from Bill. Ron was telling anyone who would listen about how big his new office would be. No one was bothering Harry or asking him questions about why he quit, which was good. He often enjoyed just sitting back at the Burrow and watching his favorite family interact as they had always done. It was nice, Harry thought.
“Yeah, well I’m not pleased I was right and I didn’t piece it together quick enough to help you…” Harry trailed off awkwardly
It was absolutely absurd on the one hand that him and Harry could ever be together like that but yet suddenly it seemed to make perfect sense to Draco and he just knew it would happen one day. It wouldn’t be easy, there would be a whole load of obstacles in their way but they’d survived a war, surely they could get through anything? It would be worth it in the end to be together, Draco would make sure of it. He didn’t know for definite how Harry was feeling of course but he was quietly confident.
It was only at the end of the night where Harry had a brief sober thought… Draco hadn’t even asked him about any of it. He must be curious, he had to be but he’d done what Harry had asked and given him a night to leave his life behind and just be Harry.
Daphne had been incredibly unhelpful and had done nothing to lift his mood. Even the brief comfort of the hug had gone now and he felt empty once again. Still, the first week of trading had gone better than he could have hoped and he tried to lift his spirits with that. Life really wasn’t so bad. He’d been able to pay Daphne a wage and put a small amount in his vault at Gringotts to start building it back up again. He’d even had another trip to the bakery on Saturday to stock up the cupboards a bit with fresh bread, cakes and pastries. Not the healthiest but he had a really sweet tooth so he loved it.
Daphne chuckled again seemingly enjoying Harry’s mild discomfort. They walked together for a few more steps before getting to the front door. Harry held back waiting for Daphne to open it or usher him but she stopped just in front of the door and turned to him before they went inside.
it’s ok you can be nice to him again now.” Potter said in amusement. Draco had noticed him stutter over the word and it was mildly awkward, did Potter think they were friends? Had he just corrected himself because Draco was here? They were friendly but friends was a whole other matter. Friends call each other by their first name and Draco was definitely not ready to do that yet. He took his time in reaching to get his drink and bringing it to his lips so he had an excuse to look busy for a short time. Once Kreacher was gone Potter turned back to him.
“Yes, 12 months, similar conditions to you but without the terms at school of course. Quite a good result actually.”
“Also,” Harry continued. “I know he’s been looking for somewhere to live and it wouldn’t be a bad idea to have someone in your flat at night so it’s not empty. If he comes and goes a lot and loudly making it obvious that he lives there then we might be able to throw Lucius off the scent. If he knows you don’t live there he might leave the shop alone…”
Draco was looking at Harry in awe, that was genius. Harry hadn’t gone into details about the alarm system back at Grimmauld but Draco thought this plan was really good and he was reminded how lucky he was to be friends with an ex-auror. Maybe the aurors could be useful after all then.
“Despite not being that well informed, Professor, I will admit to being intrigued. I still do not see what assistance you would need from me but I will endeavour to be useful if the need arises.”
Leo laughed at this which Draco found himself smiling at. Laughter wasn’t something he had heard much of these past few years, unless you counted the manic laughter of a psychopath. Leo didn’t reply straight away, he let Draco’s words sink in a bit, thinking them over before answering.
“No it’s not.” Harry replied, shaking his head in an amused way. “I don’t know what this is but it’s not a mojito. It looks like it’s just rum and a ton of mint syrup.”
“If we’re talking about your spellwork then I could actually use your help setting up the potions lab in the basement. I still have my regular owl orders to fulfil this week so that's the first priority. Come on.”
Through the windows the golden light was shining out from the ornate gold chandelier inside. There were some beautiful gift baskets on display in the large window. Harry couldn’t quite see the rest of what was inside the shop from here but he had seen enough to make him want to go inside, it was unlike any other shop on Diagon Alley. He couldn’t see anyone around it though, couldn’t glimpse the potions master who obviously had style and a good sense for business. It seemed a bit keen to go now as soon as it opened but Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to do any preparations for his book until his curiosity was satisfied. Also Diagon Alley seemed really quiet at the moment and he really wasn’t keen on going out in public still whatever he said to Fred.
“I’m sorry…” Harry stated slightly awkwardly. “I have to go, I missed it last week. If I’m not there Molly will think something’s wrong. Plus Teddy will be there too-”
“-however, students who enrol will be redoing their last year. Last year's first year students will return as first years, second years as second years and so forth.” Redo? Draco sat up straighter, definitely interested now. Could this mean…
“I am really going to try and be better, Draco, I swear. I’m trying to sort my head out and get my life on track. I don’t want to be a mess anymore... for myself, for my Godchildren, my friends…” ‘for you’ He added silently in his head.
“Oh.” Harry blinked in surprise but didn’t seem annoyed, just slightly concerned. “Er, yeah sure, I guess that would be fine. You can’t come through the floo it’s not connected for travel, security reasons you know. I mean my address isn't public knowledge but you never know.”
“Merlin’s bollocks have you really?” George said coming back into the room with a sandwich and a bowl of crisps. He put the bowl in the middle of the coffee table before sitting in the armchair opposite the couple on the sofa. “Drink away then mate.” He said as he waved his wand in the direction of the kitchen and the bottle came floating towards Harry.
He could be strong when he needed to be and the adrenaline had kept him going so far but he wasn’t actually very good with pain and his hands were burning so much that it was beginning to make him feel sick.
He looked at Draco and placed a hand back on his shoulder. He squeezed it gently trying to say everything he couldn’t put into words at this moment. He received a soft look of gratitude from him in return.
It wasn’t long before he heard the noise of footsteps coming up the stairs and Kreacher appeared at the top with Draco following.
No one was looking in their direction though and Draco was at least glad for that. He didn’t want to join in with anyone’s sadness or anyone’s celebration because he didn’t feel happy or sad. In fact he wasn’t sure how he felt at all, mostly he just felt numb, empty. Should he be feeling happy? He had survived hadn’t he? The Dark Lord was dead wasn’t he? Yes he was, he has to be, Draco told himself. The three of them were sitting here very much alive and He was dead. That was more than he had ever hoped for in the last two years. He honestly didn’t think they would ever make it out alive but yet somehow here they were. Surely that was worth a smile at least, he thought, looking over again at his mother on his right and his then at his father on his left. Maybe, just maybe, they could move on from this now and be a family again. Could this be seen as a beginning?
Harry noticed that Draco lingered on the handshake a little longer than necessary and he broke it quickly.
But he didn’t just speak, he jumped off the bed as quick as he could and rounded on Harry. He didn’t shout, he was too stunned at what had happened to shout, but when his voice came out it was a low threatening voice that even he was scared of.
Harry took a while to arrive and Draco was pleased he’d cast a cushioning charm on the floor before he knelt down. When he did it was obvious he’d only just gotten out of bed. He was wearing blue chequered flannel pajama bottoms and a baggy grey T-shirt. He still looked quite groggy and his hair was absolutely indescribable in it’s messiness. Still though, he managed to look hot and Draco actually felt weirdly privileged to be seeing him in this natural state. He had this vision of relaxing in Harry’s home together in their pajamas or even waking up next to each other in the morning… No Draco, dangerous thoughts!
At school his gang had been Greg, Vincent, Theo and Pansy but they weren’t really friends. He’d grown up around them but his father had always instilled in him the hierarchy that the Malfoys were above the Crabbe, Goyle and Nott families so they were more henchmen than friends. As far as Pansy was concerned, their mothers had always been close and it was always assumed that Draco and Pansy would get married one day, something which Pansy was thrilled about so she hung around him as much as she could but Draco less so. Honestly, he had always found her really annoying. The Parkinson’s had somehow managed to stay neutral in the war and had since deliberately distanced themselves from the other Slytherin families. Draco had heard that they’d moved to America now to start over. After Vincent and his father had both died during the final battle. Greg and Theo had both gone into hiding with their families but eventually both their dads had been found and imprisoned. Draco didn’t know where Greg and Theo were now but he didn’t particularly want to see them again and his parents were obviously no longer in contact with their families.
Harry watched him go trying to shake the feeling of wanting to go after him immediately. It was so stupid, he was a grown man he could take care of himself and just because they lived together didn’t mean they had to be together all the time. Get a grip Harry, he told himself. He couldn’t be a clingy mess before he’d even had the chance to start a relationship with Draco, otherwise he’d definitely send the man running in the opposite direction…
Unlike the healer, they both knew of course that Harry didn’t really need it and if he wanted to leave the house then he easily could but Harry wasn’t going to upset Draco any further and he knew his boyfriend was just eager to look after him and keep him safe.
Deciding it might be safer to spend more time getting to know Blaise instead today he turned back to the man on his right.
Some cute little moments between Harry and Draco here of course as their relationship progresses and the others are... around!
“So the book then. Can we rewrite those chapters a bit? Put my name in but maybe also do the interaction from my point of view too? There were still loads of things in those chapters that I wanted to ask but we got into things a bit deeper than I thought today…” Draco sighed.
“Anyway, I don’t want the inheritance really, I don’t need the money and the house is awful. You should have seen it when we first started using it. It was filthy. Kreacher had been pretty neglectful, he was still mourning his old mistress. He worshipped the Black family, full of pureblood nonsense you know. He hated Sirius and he definitely hated us using the house for the order.”
“I’m pleased that it was to your satisfaction and that Mrs Granger-Weasley liked it.” Draco said a bit too formally for Harry’s liking but at least it was friendly. It was a start.
“I- I’ve…” Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “I’ve never done this before.” He confessed quietly with his eyes shut.
Draco looked up. “Afternoon tea? That’s a bit formal even for Mother given the circumstances of today.”
“Right, anyway we won’t take up any more of your time. Thanks so much for this guys.” Harry said standing up.
“No… No I’m not mad, I’m- I’m speechless…” He started speaking in a quiet voice looking down at the kitchen table. He tried to gather the confidence to express himself honestly but it was still a new thing for him. When he spoke again his voice was louder but still shaky.
“I expected the book to start with your childhood, before Hogwarts, you said you weren’t going to write about that which is fine, obviously you don’t have to if you don’t want to but…” Draco’s eyes flickered with uncertainty again and he looked away. “Would you tell me?” He asked softly.
Draco doesn't have the best day being forced to confront a growing list of fears but then in the ends he finds that life is not so bad.
Draco, who had carried on walking past Kreacher into the kitchen, suddenly turned around and realised the house elf had disappeared.
was interesting. Reading between the lines he’d almost say that Potter was frustrated and a bit bitter about being the Ministry Golden Boy. He thought Potter would love that, arrogant saviour poster boy that he was. Maybe Draco doesn’t know him as well as he thought… or maybe he’s just overthinking it. But then that last line about him not having the energy anymore seemed quite defeatist too. Draco was picturing the broken man he’d seen alone by the lake after the battle and for the first time began thinking about what life was really like for Potter now. Maybe he was suffering too just like Draco, maybe they all were.
Draco agreed and as quick as a flash they were out the door and back in the comfort of Blaise’s sitting room. It was then that Draco started to worry as the reality of his situation set in. He started nervously pacing but still managed to keep relatively calm.
It went on to list every possible man in the known universe that could be the mystery boyfriend including Blaise of course which was still amusing. Fred was mentioned as a possible candidate which made Draco slightly annoyed but then they had listed Charlie Weasley too so they were clearly just naming single men known to associate with Harry. There was also a whole list of aurors it could be as ‘Mr Potter was seen bringing lunch for two to the auror department at the Ministry last week’. Given that Draco knew it had been his married straight best friend Harry had taken lunch to that day the thought was just laughable.
Man, she could at least try and sound happy about it, Harry thought as he took another large sip of his wine. They never had alcohol at dinner when it was just the two of them here but Harry was pleased for it tonight. He knew it was a slippery slope though. Last Friday he drank because he was happy and relaxed with friends. Now though it was starting to become a coping mechanism again. Draco seemed to sense this too as he subtly poured him a glass of water and gave him another reassuring touch under the table.
When Draco hadn’t said anything, Harry spoke again. He still looked nervously but he seemed to take it as an encouraging sign that Draco hadn’t shouted.
I love putting these little fluffy moments in here and there and for me good food with loved ones is just one of the best things to this scene at the end for Draco is like my happy place! <3
Draco could admit to himself that it did look quite comfortable but he’d never say so out loud. In fact there was something oddly comforting about Potter in general looking so relaxed in his grey and red checked pyjama bottoms and his dark red jumper, or ‘hoodie’ whatever that was. He couldn’t help but feel privileged that he was being allowed to see this rare version of ‘the real hero’ that the public didn’t get to see.
“Of course you can.” Draco smiled. “I might write to the potions master at Hogwarts and see if there are any other promising potions students who need a leg up in their career. Maybe I could even go and visit them next term and see for myself.”
“Oh great now for laughing at me for coming in my pants like a teenager at the grand old age of 25, thanks.” Harry mumbled.
“You going to Ginny’s game on Sunday?” Harry asked George as they sat in the back room and ate their lunch.
“Will. You. Get. off. Me.” He spoke through gritted teeth as he tried to wriggle his way free, they were stronger than they looked.
Plus he secretly loved the idea of replacing all of Harry’s products with products he’d made himself. Having the other man smell of Draco’s favourite scents was definitely appealing,plus he was fairly confident that he could get Harry’s hair looking a bit glossier and softer instead of wiry, although he didn’t think anyone would ever actually be able to tame it! He didn’t mind that though, it made Harry who he was and one day he hoped he could run his fingers through Harry’s hair too.
“Good idea.” Draco said back before practically throwing Harry onto the bed. “I think I’d still like to practise my oral technique.” He said flirtatiously before climbing on to the bed with Harry.
Draco nodded. “The bath was heavenly actually, I haven’t had one since I left the Manor and it was exactly what I needed. Thank you.”
“Young master Malfoy, it is a pleasure for Pinky to be seeing you again” See said whilst bowing very low to him.
Draco shrugged almost smugly. “Like I said, as long as my personal privacy isn’t affected it’s in my favour for the world to know that you’re unavailable to date.” Then he wondered seriously if that was the right attitude to have. “I know that’s selfish though. I am sorry that you can’t be honest with your family” He said slightly quietly.
“I’m going to do some more writing this morning but I’m around if you need me. Then I’m picking Teddy up at three. I’m going to bring him here for a bit so he can pick out his bedroom and tell me how he wants it to look. I’m hoping he will draw me some pictures and give me some ideas so I can pass them onto Dean.”
“Full cooked English breakfast in bed? This is a treat.” Harry said happily, looking down at the plate.
His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching. The door opened and Auror Savage stood before them. He glared at all three of them menacingly, as if deliberately letting the family know that not all the aurors were going to be as civil to them as Proudfoot and Williamson had been.
He turned to Harry who had just come over to join them in the sitting room. “She was using her work as an excuse not to come to the final! Can you believe it!”
“I reckon you could really do it this year though Gin!” Ron said enthusiastically sitting on the vacant armchair. “I mean the Bats really messed up last week against the Magpies! I couldn’t believe it! But it really opened up the table. If you win on Saturday you could win the whole league! You just need to make sure that you win by-”
“I’d like to cancel the champagne breakfasts for the honeymoon suite.” Came a tired and frustrated voice that he knew well.
Draco was touched by her care and felt a bit guilty now about his initial response so tried to show some care back in his reply.
Their finished plates and glasses were vanished again as Daphne said. “So come on then, are you going to tell me his name?”
Daphne and Blaise grinned at each other and then back at him before they spoke one simple line in perfect unison.
“Why would I be upset? It didn’t mention me.” Draco said casually. “It was highly amusing and it works in my favour that the world knows you’re off the market.”
He took a couple of steps forward away from Draco’s hand and had his body and his face turned away from him when he spoke. “Thanks, that er, definitely helped and I’ll be sure to keep up with my suncream from now on.”
He broke away and noticed that Harry seemed more comfortable now and the happiest he’d seen him in a couple of days.
Again, it was the truth, it just wasn’t the whole truth but Harry was used to telling half truths now. It was only Fred who truly knew everything about him nowadays, even though George knew most of it.
Daphne came into the kitchen escorted by the maître d’ looking very pretty indeed. Her long  glossy yellow-blonde hair which Harry had only seen up in an elegant bun in the shop, was now flowing freely in soft waves around her face and down her back. She was wearing a very autumnal looking burgundy fitted pencil dress that hugged her petite frame beautifully. It had long sleeves and came down to her mid thigh. Her look was classic and simple but no doubt elegant and it suited her. Harry got up to greet her, pressing his cheek to her in a formal kiss, he might not go out a lot but he still had manners. She turned her cheek to accept his greeting and placed a delicate hand on his arm showing off her beautifully manicured nails.
“This room is really nice.” Blaise said approvingly as he looked around, being the only one of the three who hadn’t yet seen it.
Blaise was looking between the two of them with a half amused half suspicious look. Draco hadn't told him about his meeting with Harry on Wednesday. It seemed to him like a private day between the two of them. A second later the same woman was back with their drinks. Cobra as it turned out was a beer so Draco was glad he hadn't ordered it. His white wine looked fine but he had yet to taste it.
“Shut up Potter!” and Draco gave him a playful shove on his shoulder instinctively. The teasing felt good though, kind of familiar territory and cleared the air of emotions for a bit but the friendly teasing was much nicer than the malicious stuff of their youth.
Harry stared at him for a moment. Then he simply put his hand back on his chest, grabbed Draco’s top and pulled him back towards him kissing him full on the mouth without a care in the world. It was fierce and passionate as they claimed each other all over again. Harry thought he heard the drawing room door click shut again and after a while when they broke away he noticed they were the only two in the room.
“I still can’t believe people thought you were the heir of Slytherin, I mean you're such a Gryffindor!” Draco said about halfway into the third chapter.
“You know you’re always welcome here but I just don’t see the point of making a plan if you’re not going to stick to it!” Draco said, half annoyed half joking.
Just one night, a few drinks, a few questions answered to satisfy each other's curiosity… and then he really would leave Potter alone for the rest of his trip.
“His loyalties I guess. It's another long story but we needed his help with something last year. He was reluctant at first but I tried to order him as nicely as I could and explained to him the reasons why we were doing what we were doing… He ended up helping a lot and told us the whole story all about Regulus Black, he was a death Eater you know?” Draco nodded. “But he defected at the end. It was a pretty sad story and I actually felt kind of sorry for Kreacher. That locket he wears, I gave that to him, it belonged to Regulus and I said we were going to destroy Vol-, er, Riddle in Regulus’ name. Since then he’s been loyal to me and as nice as anything, he even fought in the battle on our side with the rest of the house elves.”
“Now drink this.” She said quietly but still commandingly handing him on of his own pain potions from his limited basement stock.
Harry sighed loudly but when he spoke it was in a really quiet voice. “Yes… it’s the only time I miss him really.”
“Good. I am happy for you though Harry, it does seem like the best of both worlds. I think you’ve been looking back negatively on your period with the aurors.” Draco said seriously. “I thought you must have really hated it but seeing you yesterday made me realise that there must have been parts you liked. Even if it was just taking witness statements you enjoyed it, you liked being Auror Potter again. You looked confident.”
“What? I told you it’s not a formal dinner party Kreacher, it's just some friends for dinner.” Draco said quickly, almost stunned by Kreacher’s behaviour.
Sunday morning his nerves were almost getting the better of him and he was wondering why he’d ever agreed to this in the first place. Just when he was thinking about floo calling Daphne from the fireplace in his office that was connected to the floo call network, there was a knock on the back door. There were only two people that ever did that, both of whom he was supposed to be meeting in an hour but he had a feeling he knew why they had come.
He sighed and then climbed onto bed next to lie next to Harry. He gently placed a kiss onto Harry’s forehead and then laid next to him just gently stroking the side of his face. He looked so handsome like this, just resting. Draco realised that he still didn’t know what happened at the shop but he figured if Harry was back then it must be OK and he was sure if something really bad had happened Harry would have led with that when he came back. He would never have returned if it meant leaving one of the others in danger and as long as everyone was safe that’s all that really mattered.
Well maybe not quite everything… there was still what happened in the forest. He’d only ever told Ron and Hermione and even then he’d only given them the facts they needed. There was only one person who actually witnessed it who was still alive and free from Azkaban and that was Draco’s mother.
“It’s quite alright Leo, you did your best I’m sure and we didn’t expect anything from you anyway.” After a slight pause Draco cleared his throat. “I should thank you for your testimony of my character, it seems to have helped a great deal... and... if you also spoke out for mother then I should thank you for that as well.”
“Well I was at dinner with both of them last night and the way they interact… well it’s like me and Hermione, they are best friends and I just don’t see anything romantic between them. I think there was more to the whole engagement than meets the eye. Maybe it was supposed to be an arranged marriage that they couldn’t go through with or something. I’m not sure.”
“Well it’s been a bit cool so far actually for this time of year but it’s going to be much hotter for the next couple of days. You need to look after your skin. Come on, out.” Draco said in an authoritative sort of voice and was already heading back towards the shore.
“I thought Harry was meeting us all at yours at midday?” Draco said to Daphne, frowning. “Please do not tell me he’s coming here and I’m not even ready yet!”
Harry thought back to his chat with George the other week. “Think about what it would be like if things got serious with them you mean?”
Draco huffed. “No not really but I never do so what’s new there!” Unlike Daphne, he was not in a good mood today.
The man had sported stubble since Draco had reacquainted him and Draco had always liked it. It made him look more mature and more manly than the boy he’d known at school. On Wednesday Draco did notice it had been longer on Wednesday but he assumed that’s because he’d woken Harry up before he’d had the chance to shave. Now though it seemed like he hadn’t shaved all week and was now sporting a short beard all over his jaw and shaped around his mouth. It looked good, very good.
Turning to his Mother he saw she was tight lipped as always. “Mother, be nice.” He warned just before he walked out the room.
Daphne took a deep breath and she had a mild flush on her cheeks. “Well he sounds like quite a man. Are you sure you’re not in love with him?” She asked with a smile.
Just then the other healer came back with the relevant emergency contact forms and passed them to Harry. He filled them out quickly and signed them before passing them to Draco so that he could add his signature. After Draco had signed them he passed them back to the main healer in charge who had examined Harry and when he spoke again he spoke directly to Draco.
On the one hand he didn’t really see why it mattered to Draco, he thought they would be discussing the events of school, their relationship and how that all fitted into the war. What came before had no relevance…
“Take it he hasn’t managed to listen to you long enough to realise the privacy measures Potter has put in place?” Blaise said raising an eyebrow at the worked up Draco pacing in the living room.
“What?” She said innocently back at him catching his expression. “You need to eat more Draco and you know it so don’t look at me like that! You’re far too skinny!”
“Dinner is at half six by the way.” He said to Harry. “Remember what I said, be yourself and challenge her back.”
If any of you lovely talented people ever drew an fan art that is based on my stories or links with them in anyway then please get in touch I'd love to see them!
Harry sighed and repeated himself more slowly giving Ron the time he needed to adjust. “Me and Draco, we’re a couple. It's official and it’s serious and you’ll have to get on board with it because he’s not going away any time soon or- well,
This week she took the opportunity to have a rare night out with Molly as they were both free of grandchildren. Harry took Teddy to the park again but fortunately there was no paparazzi this time round. Then they went back to Dromeda’s where Harry tried very hard to help Teddy with his homework and then he made him dinner. It wasn’t really cooking, he just reheated what Dromeda had made the night before but he was thinking he should probably cook next time.
Therefore, from now on this fic will only get updated once a week. I will aim to post a new chapter every Sunday evening (UK time) but I can't make any promises!
“Oh cut the crap you two!” Harry burst out in a half annoyed half amused kind of way. “I know that Pierre is really Malfoy.”
“Perhaps Miss Parkinson would be the exception, sorry if she was a friend of yours but she did try and hand me over to Voldemort in front of the whole school!” He said slightly less formally, his voice and his body language relaxing a bit now.
It was Harry’s turn to interrupt Draco now as he shook his head. “No. Thank you but no. I’ll be fine, I don’t want to take anymore. I’ll figure it out… but thank you, and erm, well if I need help then I will definitely ask you and I… erm, well I hope if you need help you’ll ask me too but I won’t push…”
“I plan on drinking myself half to death again tonight. If you have no better plans then you could join me, you know… if you want. Better than being alone.” Potter shrugged as if it was no big deal but somehow it seemed like it might be. “I’ll even let you ask anything you want.” He added with a little more confidence and a slight smile.
“Is it stupid that I’m scared you’re going to tell me that Riddle found the unbeatable wand even though I know you still defeated him?” Draco laughed nervously.
Harry groaned and rolled his head back in despair, maybe this would be harder than he thought. “Firstly, it’s not really up to me. I know that I do help raise Teddy but Dromeda is his primary carer and if she thinks it’s fine then it’s fine. Secondly, what do you think Narcissa’s going to do to Teddy exactly?!”
Once they had separately met back up at the shop coming in through the back as normal. Draco looked at the purchases he made and started putting them all in place while Daphne sorted the few kitchen things he sorely needed and then they were finally able to make some tea. Draco, being worried about finances was just going to get some of the basic stuff even though he didn’t like it that much, it would do but Daphne had insisted that as she was going to spend so much time at the shop they needed to have the posh herbal infusions and the nicest supply of biscuits. Again, Draco knew she was doing this mostly for his benefit but he allowed the pretence that she was buying them for herself. He sipped the chamomile tea as he put his clothes away.
Harry tried to make eye contact with Draco but the other man was refusing to look at him. He tried to put everything that he was feeling, all his care and affection into his voice as he spoke calmly and softly.
His head was still just about resting on Harry’s shoulder and Harry had tentatively put his arm round the back of the sofa again but this time slowly brought his hand down so it was resting on Draco's shoulder. It was still only a light pressure, Harry didn't quite have his arm around him but he almost did. Their body’s relaxed around each other into this natural position.
“It was fake?” Draco said with wide eyes. “But then the whole trip, the cave, the potion? It was a…”
“Of course not! You know stubborn he is once he’s got something in his head!” Daphne said, taking the bag from Blaise and putting it on the fancy glass dining table in the corner of the room.
Harry leaned over the table and took Draco’s free hand. “Of course you’re invited you idiot, they’re
“Good, I think I’d like some fresh air. Could you please tell her that I’m ok and that I will come to her in just a moment?”
Draco noticed that George suddenly sat up straighter and looked more fierce. “He can try.” The man practically growled.
“Also, I have been trying to keep my living situation quiet as I... was ashamed of it. Not even Blaise or Daphne knew how bad it was so when you discovered it… well that was hard for me to deal with.” Draco said slowly and quietly, still pausing to take little sips of his tea here and there and looking down at his cup as he did so.
“Looks like we’re both liars then.” Harry said as he reluctantly withdrew his hands from behind Draco’s head already missing the feel of Draco’s hair between his fingers.
Harry pulled out the chair nearest him and waited for Narcissa to take a seat, which she did cautiously, then he pushed it back in for her. She looked faintly impressed but she didn’t say anything.
Truthfully he hadn’t yet worked out what he was going to do to Harry tonight. He knew what he wanted to do… but he just wasn’t quite sure if he had the confidence.
First they talked more about the details of the case and Lucius. Harry even explained how the engagement with Daphne had been a plan to just get Draco’s parents off his back for a while and that they’d never actually been together. Even Ron admitted that he felt sorry for Draco having to deal with that form of fatherhood. He even went as far as to say he understood a little more now why Draco had been “a right royal prat” at school.
He was still lying on his right side. He rolled over carefully and sat himself up in bed. George helped pulling up the pillows behind him to prop himself up. Harry pulled the covers up to look underneath and assess the damage. He noticed he was just wearing his boxers, he couldn’t remember when they’d undressed him or bandaged him up. His knees were both covered in dressing but other than that his legs looked OK, just a few shallow cuts and scrapes down his left thigh that had been cleaned but left undressed. It was the left side of his chest and stomach that felt sore and had the murtlap soaked bandages stuck to him. He has a few patches on his left arm that were covered up too.
As they got closer to it a witch who Draco didn’t recognise but who was obviously a reporter got very excited. She started bobbing up and down stupidly as the witch next to her snapped away with a camera.
“Well just be thankful that after the war was over I could finally get some experts in to remove her, otherwise you wouldn’t find living here nearly as relaxing.” Harry said seriously.
Draco took a deep breath and separated himself from Harry having gathered the strength he needed from him. “I got the impression you still want to involve the aurors?” He asked him.
“Oh yeah that place is great!” Harry agreed anthusically. “I always go there if I fancy something sweet. Although they’re great at savoury stuff too, often I get their sausage rolls.”
Kingsley was about to carry on when a member of the Wizengamot raised their hand for the first time so he looked at the witch and invited her to speak. “Yes, Mr. Ogden?”
Fred then turned to Harry again. “Seriously though Harry, you should, and not just because it might help Georgie get laid!” George threw the cushion back and Fred caught it and put it on his lap laughing.
Harry paused for a sip of his water as the others just ate and listened. “I intend to tell him tomorrow about the fact that he does have some family still living in you and Draco. Draco expressed an interest last night in meeting Teddy too so that will be nice. He also said he wanted to meet his Aunt so I have invited Dromeda over for dinner tomorrow alongside Teddy.”
“You’re most welcome Harry. I am very impressed by you, not the Harry Potter saviour of the world but just you, Harry. You’re a good guy and you’re nothing like I thought you would be.” She said, giving him that curious look again.
“I wanted to give you the heads up about the book, you deserved to know.” Potter explained. “And I wanted permission to use your real name when I write about events but if you don’t give it then I guess I can give you a fake name… another one!”
Draco thought for a moment. He had no desire to get anyone else involved in his personal life but he couldn’t argue with Harry’s logic. It would make him feel better if he knew someone was keeping an eye out on the shop when he wasn’t there.
Daphne summoned a fourth glass and poured the rest of the bottle into it before it floated over to Harry. She then moved into the centre of the room in an effortlessly commanding way.
There was something stewing in the back of his mind during this discussion and one look at Draco told him that he was thinking the same thing. It was strange how in sync they were. He put the thought aside for now though, one thing at a time.
There was something odd there, Draco had thought about it when he’d read the first chapter of the book expecting it to mention a loving family home and being raised as the-boy-who-lived. Instead the chapter had started very differently.
Harry spoke again to fill the silence as Draco still hadn’t spoken. “Erm, you can owl me if you want, I can borrow one to reply if needed but I don’t actually have an owl so maybe just floo call me when you’ve read it and we can meet up to discuss? Er, if you want. Anyway it’s 12 Grimmauld Place and you can leave a message with Kreacher if I’m not around and I’ll call you back.”
Narcissus opened her mouth to speak and then closed it again. She looked strangely unsure of herself but still ever dignified. “Do you- do you mean… you can’t possibly mean..” She started but trailed off.
Except as soon as Draco left, Harry’s plan for the day drastically changed when he had a floo call from Ron asking him to come into the Ministry for an emergency auror briefing. He ran up the stairs to put some practical field clothing on underneath his auror robes and even remembered to grab his badge. He scribbled a quick note to Draco to let him know and asked Kreacher to send it off with Gandalf as soon as he could. He also left Kreacher in charge of Dean and the other contractors that were arriving to do the work today but Dean had been here before so would be able to let the others in.
He took a sip of water from the glass on the coffee table that was left from earlier and then spoke again in a flat even voice.
Then he hesitated slightly before he gave in to his urge. “Will you show me what you do in the kitchen from now on? Doesn’t have to be every time but bits and pieces here and there would be good. I want to learn how to cook and prepare food for myself.”
Fred had managed to sit through a meeting with Draco the previous evening and the twins were raving about the potion geniuses ideas all through dinner on Thursday. It all sounded very positive and it was helping Fred stay in a good mood. However his foot was still bandaged and George was insisting he took the rest of the week off which he was a bit grumpy about. It had worked out well though as George had advertised a new shopkeeper position on Monday and had an immediate response from someone who could start straight away. The shop had been a bit quiet and George had been able to spend Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday training him on the job.
“But the only one left out there is…” Ron said piecing together all the information in his head until he shot right up out of his seat. “Sweet Salazar Harry, you’re talking about the Malfoys.”
“From then on I knew I could do it, so whenever we were in the field and I needed to I just acted and trusted that my magic wouldn’t let me down.” Harry said casually. “Other times, away from the action I practised wandless magic all the time and slowly I started getting better at it and more controlled. My confidence grew and it just started becoming easier, I was doing really well at work, my instincts were good and my magic was good… things seemed to be going well…”
“No problem.” Harry said looking back. He spoke instinctively before he thought about it but he found he meant every word when he said “It’s really good to have you here Draco, I’m so pleased you came.”
Harry was wearing dark beige chinos with brown shoes, a brown belt and a simple navy round neck top with a short navy jacket over the top with the collar popped up. He looked good as always. Harry, unlike Draco, seemed to have an abundance of different clothes and wore something slightly different every time Draco saw him. The jeans were still his favourite but these chinos looked good too and the man did now know to put things together.
Harry forced his mind back to the present conversation in the Head Auror’s office. Fortunately Robards and Shacklebolt were still exchanging pleasantries and chatting about their weekend whilst they drank their coffee so he hadn’t missed much. It was all very nice but Harry was wondering why he was really here and when he would be reprimanded. He couldn’t help but feel like the other two men were in too much of a good mood to start telling him off, it was almost as though they were celebrating something. All too soon they started telling Harry the real reason they called him in to have this little chat. It definitely wasn’t what Harry expected but the ‘good news’ they had for him just made him angry and frustrated. This really was the last straw.
“I am close to her.” Harry clarified. “I am helping her raise her grandson Teddy, I’m his Godfather. Over the past few years she has been almost like a mother to me. Family means everything to her and I know she will want to help you. She told me that she wrote to you after the war wanting to reconnect and that she received a Narcissus flower in response.”
“I’m sorry… Harry.” He said quietly avoiding eye contact with him. “Old habits you know…” He mumbled.
This started another round of naming muggle games and trying to come up with their magical equivalents. Harry’s favorite idea was a version of Twister where as soon as you put your hand or foot on a colour your whole body would turn that colour. They were still trying to come up with a name for it but he had do doubt that they would have fun testing it.
Ron swore quietly and picked up his drink again gulping down half the pint in one go. When he was finished he slowly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and turned to face Harry.
Williamson himself has assigned the rooms that night before sitting down at the small kitchen table with Proudfoot, each with a big cup of tea. Draco hadn’t really known what to do as he didn’t really feel welcome or useful anywhere so he had simply taken the cosy little window seat at the other end of the sitting room from the fireplace that looked out onto the back garden and watched the sun go down. Before too long Williamson had announced that he was taking the night guard shift and that everyone else should get some sleep.
“Hmm, well I suppose I can’t say no to that and I have always thought you should just live your life the way you want to live it and forget what the press say.” Fred said, seemingly less suspicious now.
“Oh hey! Erm, two secs, I’m just peeing.” Harry called back from the bathroom area over the sounds of Charlie and the Chocolate factory still playing on the TV.
He remembered the way Harry’s face had lit up when Draco had suggested for him to watch a film. Draco had been slowly discovering the joys of muggle films over the past few years and Bex had suggested a lot of them she loved as a child when Draco had told her he’d grown up without a TV. It was for that reason why a large collection of his DVD’s were children’s films. Well, he could blame Bex anyway.
He’d just gotten to the bit just before Malfoy Manor when it was time for him to leave and pick up Teddy. It was a good place to stop anyway as the next bit he wanted to write with Draco given that it involved both of them and he knew Draco would want to add his perspective. He thought about Narcissa too as she had been there that day and he wondered what had been going through her mind at the time.
“Umm?” George responded looking up at Harry from his usual armchair licking the sugar off his fingers from the custard doughnut he’d enjoyed.
I didn't want Fred or Harry to come across as 'the bad guy' hopefully you can understand both of their perspectives and what this 'relationship' has been for both of them.
Blaise paused for dramatic effect and Draco let his words sink in for a moment before he continued. “It looks to me like he’s doing everything he can already to convince you to stay.”
As far as he could remember though, Harry never once spoke about his life back home. He didn’t talk about Ginny or the wedding. Hogwarts wasn’t mentioned or anyone that they used to both know. They didn’t touch on the war or even magic at all really given that they were in a muggle bar. Draco didn't even question where his scar had gone... although Harry had noticed that Draco's left forearm was noticeably absent of any Dark Mark so maybe that wasn't a mystery to him.
Blaise and Daphne seemed to sense this new acceptance of his feelings and his determination as they smiled and came to stand either side of him double checking his hair and overall appearance too.
Draco suddenly became aware that this was the first time he’d seen Fred since Harry’s revelation and he had been determined to give him at least a small amount of grief for a little while but now hardly seemed the time. He was here to help, he was a part of their team too and he was George’s twin who seemed just as worried about Daphne as he was.
This was better for washing his hair after all and Draco had his favorite bergamot shampoo in here too. He had made the formula himself so it was perfect for his hair and he had forgotten how good it smelled. It had a mixture of light floral notes and the more earthy scents of tea it soothed him as he ran it through his soft hair. He had been neglecting his hair and he hadn’t thought to care before but now he was suddenly frustrated with himself that he asked for his products before now. He silently promised himself that he would never wash without them again as he poured some of the homemade lavender shower gel into his hands to wash the rest of his body.
“Well yeah it is fast but a lot has changed in your life too… it is a bit of a whirlwind but I needed something to come in and disrupt my mundane life in the best possible way and you did that. You’re what I’ve been waiting for.” Harry said so sincerely that it made Draco smile inwardly. “You asking me if I’m really over him or something?” he added, frowning slightly.
“He wrote to me on Thursday asking if I was free for dinner on Saturday. He said he wanted to take me out as he had something to ask me but he made it clear that the invitation was purely platonic.” She looked at Draco with a bit of a suppressed smile remembering their earlier conversation.
He was just wondering what the time was, he felt like he’d had a good eight hours sleep, it had only been a small vial, but then that would make it late evening and he could see the bright summer sun poking in through a gap in the curtains. He was just about the check when a house elf in a frilly pink apron appeared at the foot of his bed with a ‘pop’.
His mother encouraged his plan to study which was good but she did increase the pressure somewhat with her typical gentle but somehow still firm reminder.
“Feels like ages since we’ve done this.” Draco commented with a smile as they resumed their regular positions on the sofa.
Well that was strange, who else could it possibly be from. He’d already had his monthly owl from McGonagall and their meeting was scheduled for tomorrow. Leo simply smiled at Draco’s confused look.
“No, trust me, he is most definitely not perfect.” Draco said, looking at the scroll now in his hands with what Draco could only assume was his own name in the slanty black scrawl. “And yes, you’re correct, his handwriting truly is atrocious, why does that not surprise me?” He said dryly.
Harry was relieved, this was the only way to ensure that Lucius really would never be free to exert his control over Draco ever again. He had always hoped that he could lead Lucius to the aurors but he knew he’d never do it without Draco’s permission. He launched into his plan thinking it through as he went like usual.
“The deep V draws the eye down to your chest and the pale colour that almost mimics your skin tone gets people thinking about your chest. It’s almost like you're not wearing a T-shirt.” Blaise finished with a glint in his eye as he was looking at Draco’s chest in a very flirty way.
“You never had to apologise, it’s ok.” Fred said, giving Harry’s hand that he was still holding a little squeeze.
“I was thinking of drinking the rest of that whiskey and shagging you all afternoon.” Harry replied half-joking.
He wasn’t quite sure how much he could get Graham to do at the shop to fill three days. There was plenty of work that wasn’t the problem, the problem for Draco would be delegating and letting go of control in a few areas. Hopefully the man was good with potions and Draco could trust him to do some of the most basic brewing in the cellar downstairs whilst he did the complicated stuff at Grimmauld. It would take a while for Draco to trust him completely but he’d start him off small and test everything he made before he’d allow it to be sold and then take it from there. At least he knew from George that Graham could do stock checks and accounts well enough. Draco hated those, they were boring so having someone manage the paperwork might be nice. He had to admit getting some help would be good as his workload was piling up. Then he would have some time to work on the book with Harry.
Fuck! He thought he’d forgotten all about the way Potter had once made him feel. It had just been a stupid crush on the boy who had been the focus of his school life in one way or another, it hadn’t meant anything and it definitely didn’t mean anything now, he told himself. It was just Potter getting to him like he always did. He told himself when he came to England that he would just be celibate. He knew he couldn’t marry a woman and told himself that no man would have him anyway even if he was free to be openly gay now. Casual sex got old pretty fast when he was in France, it was ok, some of it had even been good but he’d never really found someone who lit his world on fire.
There was silence for a short while but it wasn't too uncomfortable. Watching Harry relax in his kitchen doing simple things was nice, Draco thought to himself and it immediately relaxed him too. Draco found the process fascinating and there seemed to be some sort of machine involved.
Ron was planning on bringing Harry in next week but they’d suddenly received some intel that they needed to act on now before it was too late. They were working to apprehend a group of illegal potion makers who were brewing highly addictive potions and making a fortune by selling them to vulnerable people and getting them addicted.
It had been quiet for a little while now but it wasn’t awkward or uncomfortable, not really. Draco looked like he wanted to say something but wasn’t sure if he should or how to say that. Harry wanted to reassure him that he could say anything he wanted. He knew that Draco had barriers, hell, Harry put his own walls up sometimes, but there was something about this man, this space, this dynamic between them that made Harry want to rip down both of their walls and be completely open and honest with each other. Could they do that? Maybe they would get there in time. Small steps Harry.
“That’s precisely what I said!” George replied with a knowing look. “As you can see, I know how to take care of my guests.” He said with a smile.
Draco stilled again for a moment only to connect with those pleading green eyes. He suddenly had a vision of Harry begging him to do something very different with that ‘please’ in his voice and that hopeful look. Yes, he would very much like to make Harry beg one day.
“Anyway,” Potter took a deep breath before continuing and looking straight into Draco’s eyes as he spoke. “What I was trying to say ties into the reason why I’m here tonight. The reason why I wanted to speak to you.”
“Oh right, sorry, thanks though appreciate it.” Potter said running his hand through his hair and making it even more messy. It fell back softly when he removed his hand and was effortlessly scruffy but in such a good way. Draco almost had the urge to run his hand through it too. Merlin, what was happening here.
“We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, sorry, I was just asking about the elf I didn’t mean to…” Draco said awkwardly.
After he’d successfully put Rose down for her afternoon nap he found Hermione and offered to cook the evening meal for them. If he cooked it now then it could stay warm and be ready for them later so that she didn’t have to worry about it. Hermione being Hermione worked on a menu plan that she had on the chalkboard in the kitchen and everything was very organised so Harry went to work on the lamb hotpot that she’d been planning to do. Just as he put it in the muggle oven that Hermione had to cook low and slow he heard the sound of Rose’s soft cries on the monitoring charm. Hermione took a break from her work and went to get her so she could have a big cuddle with her.
Being forced to face what he wanted he knew Fred had always been right, that Fred would never make him truly happy. He also knew that Daphne was right, whilst he could technically start finding ‘Mr. Right’ without doing anything against his ‘agreement’ with Fred it just didn’t feel right to him. He realised that he had been treating Fred like his boyfriend in his head really this whole time.
Malfoy didn’t seem phased by any of this and was acting annoyingly cool, calm and collected. Malfoy had always been composed but Harry always thought it was somewhat fake before, a mask that was easy to crack. Now Malfoy just seemed really laid-back in a self-assured way without being arrogant.
Harry turned round to look at Draco properly as he spoke. “I’ll admit that once the thought might have made me uncomfortable but I still don’t really understand why that is. It’s a nice big house and it should be used, having you here has made me realise that a bit more. Besides, it’s important for you to have quality time with your friends and I don’t want you to miss out on that because you don’t feel safe at theirs anymore.”
After wishing for the perfect’s night sleep for them both Draco had no sooner climbed into bed than he felt the band on his ankle, which he’d almost forgotten was even there, burn into his skin. Not enough to hurt him but definitely enough to notice the unusual warmth and shoot straight out of bed again.
“Oh right, fair enough.” Harry said. He kept his eyes straight ahead half watching how George and Daphne were getting on as he involved Draco in the conversation too. “What about you Draco? You still fly at all?”
It was absolutely ridiculous but Draco had never actually said he was gay out loud to anyone before like that. The first person he’d come out to had been Blaise but Blaise had guessed before Draco actually said anything. Then, with Draco’s permission, Blaise had told Daphne so Draco never actually had to say it. It’s not like he was ashamed to say the words out loud or anything, he just preferred to avoid any conversations about his personal life and emotions so when Blaise had asked if he could tell her it seemed like the easy way out.
He took a deep breath and allowed all the techniques he used from mediation and occulemany to calm himself down and not show his thoughts to Blaise. If he really needed to he would go to Blaise for help, he knew that. His business and this opportunity was much more important to him than his pride, but for now, he hadn’t failed, he could still do this.
“I knew there was something about you that Fred and George weren’t telling me and when the article about you Daphne came out they called you ‘Draco’ which seemed weirdly friendly so I kind of worked it out but I knew that they trusted you and I trust their opinion so....” Harry said, shrugging as he stepped into the room further and closed the door behind him.
It was only then that Draco turned his attention back to his friends and flushed in embarrassment somewhat before covering it up in his usual Draco way. “Been lovely having you guys but make sure you don’t overstay your welcome won’t you? Kreacher will show you out when you’re ready.”
Draco seemed unsure but didn’t push it further. “OK then… Goodnight Harry.” He said softly before leaving the room.
Draco frowned at him. “Well you have to actually say it, no one has ever asked me before don’t take it away from me.” He said in a mock sulk.
It was quiet for a moment before George said he was going to get them some soup. Fred let go of Harry’s wrist and sat on the bed properly next to Harry stretching out his legs and leaning back against the head of the bed. They weren’t touching and Harry noticed how there was nothing physical between them anymore. He just didn’t look at Fred in the same way anymore, there was no attraction there; he was just the same as George, the same as Ron, best friends.
“Not to worry, I have set up my fireplace in the same way anyway for calls only but not travel.” Draco replied honestly.
“Now I am starting to realise that things could turn out differently, maybe… Lucius will be the last Malfoy, of that I am certain and it makes me happy. If I had a child I could breathe life into the Black family name again even if I have nothing else of the Black ancestry to offer them… or we could be a family under whatever surname my husband had. I’m certainly in no hurry to become a father though if it does ever happen. I still want to focus on the business, I’d like to have a proper home and some money in the bank to leave any future children I have with and I’m a long way off having that. Plus actually raising a child still does terrify me to be honest. I worry that I could never be a good father as I’ve never had one to be a role model for me.”
Thanks so much for sticking with me and I hope that people are still interested in this story. I promise I am getting there, wrapping things up!
For a while now, nobody but Potter had spoken but the Wizengamot were turning to one another and whispering to themselves once more. Draco could see a few nodding heads again and it seemed like they were in agreement. He could not believe that Potter had spoken out for him like this. He would have to ask his mother later if this had all really happened. This is certainly not what he expected.
Harry was already dreading the answer, he really thought Teddy was too preoccupied to notice and had thought that he wasn’t listening but-
Harry was thinking that over curiously though. It was odd to him that she had jumped to that conclusion immediately. Did that mean that Malfoy was gay? Not that it mattered of course, it was just… interesting.
“The bath was heavenly, I never really saw the appeal but I understand now why you like them.” Harry said smiling “I… appreciated the meditation tips but I still think it’s something I’m not naturally gifted at, I’ll keep trying though. The sprays definitely helped. The chamomile one does help me feel more relaxed and the lavender one makes me sleepy like part of my brain is shutting off, in a good way. When I woke I felt pretty normal again and resprayed them to help me get back off.”
The other glaring change was the lack of glasses. Harry’s incredible bottle green eyes seemed even more vibrant without the glasses to hide behind. They were dazzling in the most amazing way. Looking into them Draco almost felt like he couldn’t breathe.
**Warning! -Like before alcohol is mentioned quite a lot in this chapter and Draco does use it as a way to relax and stop thinking so much. He describes the way it makes him feel too so if alcohol use has been an issue for you you might not want to read it. I really hope I've done this sensitively.
