Harry figured he had never seen something so genuine in his life.
"From
The words graced Theo's vocal chords before he could hope to stop them. One moment they were in his head and the next…. He swallowed hard, trying to keep a relaxed expression. Trying not to let on that he might have leaked something incriminating. He vowed to police his words more closely from that moment on.
Frown creasing his brow, Harry returned his attention to Malfoy. "Sorry? You have a—?"
"—I'll be out of town on a research expedition. But, yes, you're absolutely correct." Luna paused for a single second to pull in a quick breath of air. "I should leave you to do this on your own. How are you supposed to properly find yourself whilst stifled by someone else's set expectations? Not that I have those for you, Harry dearest. All I want is for you to love whoever it is you are deep down in that mushy little heart of yours." Luna squealed, practically in Harry's ear, and twirled out of his arms back towards the water.
Draco simply couldn't let this happen. Not after last week.
"I thought when he asked me to be his date," Draco explained, but only once he'd looked around to make sure no one was within earshot, "that he meant it literally. As you can tell, I was wrong." He once again threw the flowers to the side, resenting the sight of them.
It was Ron who broke the silence first, reaching across the table to push Harry's bowl aside while gently saying his name. Since he had nothing left to focus on, Harry finally looked up and took in Ron's easy smile. "You've looked like a bundle of nerves all night. What's going on, mate?"
"Wait." Harry winced as the word came out yet
Falling into comfortable habits once they reached the restaurant, Harry led Draco through to a back corner. They had always savoured the anonymity which came with seclusion, not to mention the intimacy of a space seemingly all their own.
. True Slytherins would eat him alive for that. Something Draco knew from first-hand experience. You have to be tough to hack it in that house. "Gryffindor, then? Do you have a desperate desire to prove yourself?"
Even if the words and sentiments behind them weren't wholly his.
okay. It was perfect and lovely and spoke of a future he could look forward to.
"Oh, that's good!" Hermione exclaimed. "We can use that."
, Harry, calm down. He's not dead. Alright? He's not dead. Teddy's not dead." He pulled Harry's desperate hands from his hair and smoothed it down. Putting him back together again. Holding him together – still fragile like a jigsaw puzzle. Still so close to breaking by misplaced touch.
) he had, at the very least, just given himself permission to run off with a soothing dessert. Which meant, either way, it would be fine.
"Give a moan. Like you're being fucked within an inch of your life." Malfoy crossed to the bed, curling his fingers around a post. "And do try to make it convincing."
. They were exactly what one another needed, found when it felt no one else could understand.
They descended the stairs a good distance from one another. Clearly not trusting the unspoken words between them just yet. Although it was the last place he wanted to be, Draco led them through the kitchen to the backdoor. The yard was the safest place to apparate without walking a far distance.
His eyes quickly cut from the loo door back to the etching in his eye line. They cut back and forth five times exactly before he settled on feeling safe once again. Even then, though, he kept his breathing low and shallow. Just in case.
." Potter looked around him quickly before ducking down and spitting out a mouthful into a napkin. He surveyed once more to be sure no one had seen him, flushing just barely pink in the cheeks. "They really should be ashamed of themselves with that."
It had too suddenly become too real.
Just waiting for the universe to remind him he wasn't worthy.
Harry would recognize Draco's voice absolutely anywhere. Even when he didn't know where he was, that voice still reminded him of home. A bright green haze buzzed against Harry's skin a moment later. Pulsing in time with every too-loud heartbeat in his ears. Desperate for answers, he sat up quickly and tried to shake off the unfamiliar magic.
he was guilty. He looked smug. He looked just as Draco had remembered him from the week previous. Like he had not a fear in the world, even though he was currently sitting in secure bindings in a foreign Ministry. "Good morning, Mr. Malfoy. I'm so glad you finally decided to visit me. Can I get you something to drink? Maybe a fresh baked cookie?" He smirked and Draco couldn't help but to roll his eyes.
Draco responded by pulling him closer and pressing his lips to the spot on the scar where his fingers had previously been. He responded with heart-breaking kindness, even while Harry could feel the tightness in those shoulders beneath him. He pulled Draco closer, pressing his fingers into the taut muscles in an attempt to massage them into relaxing.
His alabaster cheeks filling with blood, Draco recoiled and scanned the words again. "You told me writing them down would help," he started, pulling in another long breath. The oxygen around him felt thin which was a sure sign he was on the edge of cracking. Minutes away from a breakdown or a panic attack or full, complete shutdown. "It hasn't helped. I write them down and then they're…they're
"No, because I still didn't really understand at that point. It was only after you didn't take notice, after nothing changed following your trial and I returned home to my girlfriend like usual, that it really hit me. I wanted more from you, Malfoy." A shudder ran down Harry's spine, his memory too vividly showing him the "more" he had taken while Malfoy wasn't himself. "You honestly cannot even imagine how much I have dreamt of the way we were last night…."
Harry honestly still wasn't sure what he thought of it all. He didn't know if he was angry with Draco for keeping the details of his failed marriage from him. He didn't know if he was scared of his partner's apparent penchant for drunken violence. He didn't know if he felt it was a good idea for Draco to see his son unsupervised as he wished. All he truly knew was that his brain was tangled with these messy threads of uncertainty. To keep things simple, though, he shook his head and sipped from his cup. He reserved the right to change his mind, should he end up finding anger in those threads later on.
There was a life on the line outside of their intimate space. A life both men severely cared about. But if they acknowledged that in very real standards – by breaking whatever this moment was – that only made it all the more real. Teddy could be dying. Or already dead. Whatever the outcome, he would be irreparably scarred in uncountable ways.
It was a statement and required no affirmation. That didn't stop Draco, however, from feeling the need to hopelessly nod his head. Up and down. Slow and mechanical. Harsh and
"Harry…." Draco shook his head resolutely, for a moment triggering a hopeful smile from the other. "I'm the one who had the forbidden objects. It is technically my crime. And I'll go down for it if I have to.
Harry carefully shut the door behind them. "I can come back later if you need to finish something..."
Potter to repeat his name over and over in the throes of passion. He needed this to end the way he had dreamt it. That was what he needed, but by no means what he was going to get. In lieu of his desired response, he croaked for Potter to just touch him.
"How dare you."
"You seem to be handling it just fine with your magic."
In that moment, Harry found the thought of tipping the kettle over her head inviting, but restrained himself with a reminder that this wasn't about him. This was about so much more than him or any old feud. "Right," he pushed through his teeth. He even managed a soft smile, but was sure it came out more like a grimace. "All I want to focus on is the future."
Draco's pout softened into a nearly-shy smile, his fingers gently untangling from strands of Harry's hair. Below Harry, he shifted his position on the desk so their hips could take a reprieve from one another's proximity. The absence of Draco's obvious interest almost felt like a betrayal, but it really was for the best.
As he had a thousand times before, Harry once again thought about how lost he would be if he'd never met Hermione Granger. She was the most stable and reasonable thing in his life.
"Shut it, Malfoy," Harry snapped, tearing off ahead of Draco with a vengeance.
"I want to be upset with you for going to her, but I can't find it in me. After all, I shouldn't be with you if I didn't have at least a small kink for being the damsel in distress."
"Yes."
Harry scoffed and held Draco's imploring look. "Things are different now, Draco," he said softly. "As they should be. I can't continue to be the man I was before."
Harry assumed he said '
"Okay, so there's one of your Weasleys, of course."
In the end, Harry spoke no words. He didn't have to. His answer transcended speech. Its language was instead crafted from the gentle caress of Draco's jaw. From the soft, nearly-startled exhale, as if he couldn't believe his own actions. From the lingering hesitation on his lips as he leaned in and sealed them against Draco's. He gave his answer with unmatched boldness even while the chasteness spoke of his uncertainty.
Potter tasted of tequila and toothpaste. He smelt of man, all drenched in generic forest-scented deodorant mixed with the kind of sweat which only comes from hard, physical labor. Nothing about him was particularly unique right down to his plain grey t-shirt and well-worn trainers, but in that moment he was perfect. He was the stars lining up to finally throw Draco a fucking bone for once.
Lily stirred just barely, groaning and turning to face him. She was just as beautiful as he ever remembered, even if her face was flecked with more wrinkles than in her youth. He would think she was beautiful until the day she inevitably died. A small smile slipped over her lips, a sweet bleariness clouding her gaze. "Have you now?" she asked quietly and moved to sit up. Halfway into a sitting position, however, the look in her eyes suddenly took on a shade of alarm. "Oh, honey, what's happened to your face?" Her fingers, a bit shaky, reached up to graze over Harry's forehead. "What have you done now, James?"
This unexpected insight into Malfoy's mind left Harry with a revelation. This room was a safe space. This was where he could be himself, with the self he was just maybe not matching the rest of his family downstairs. Maybe. He was still pretty much a pompous asshole, even if he did have Jamie Redknapp, shirtless, posted above his bedside table. "Liverpool?" Harry scoffed. He just couldn't help himself….
his face because he couldn't quite will his body to get close enough. He knocked again, loud and demanding, but no answer came. The door remained firmly closed and firmly locked (yes, he tried the handle). Astoria remained firmly closed off to the idea of even having one simple conversation with him.
Instantly, Cheryl put up her hand in a "stop" motion and shook her head. "It really would make more sense to me if you could describe it for me in your own words. This is your private space and I do not wish to infringe upon it in such a way."
When she pushed the door open, it was the most grand and stunning gesture. Effortless but still dramatic enough to draw all attention to her entrance. Or perhaps that was just her natural pull and presence. (All the more reason to hate her….)
There were far too many reasons why that couldn't be possible. The missing pressure of the dogs curled up between them. The air smelt stale instead of like the summer rain drifting in through an open window. The mattress was just too soft, like they could fall through it. The little sounds in the middle of the night.
Draco was at his side, instantly proving himself the better person by rubbing Harry's back and ensuring that everything was alright. He had always been so skilled at consoling and comforting, at providing Harry with the warmth he couldn't remember feeling as a child. He'd never been anything but honest and good to Harry.
He was imagining himself in Malfoy's shoes. Never had his parents forbade him to be himself in any respect. When he came out, nothing changed. His parents, his family friends, his best friend – none of them looked at him any different. None of them asked him to be anything different than who he already was. The sky didn't fall. He wasn't shunned and he wasn't carted off to the loony bin. Having shared even the most minimal of exchanges with others "like him", he knew he was of a select lucky few afforded such ease. A reality which was slammed back in his face as he sat there on the floor, staring at this obvious cry for help from one of the unlucky masses.
A mere minute later, every trace of Draco Malfoy was gone from the office. He walked out with his head held high – proud. A hero. Only two shreds of evidence remained to signify he had ever stepped foot into the Ministry again.
"Don't police me, boy." May's mouth mashed into a furiously thin line. "I've had enough women in my bed to be able to use the word 'dyke' as I like."
. To mutter an apology or bite out…something. But what was there
Fairytales and love stories go hand-in-hand with divine coincidence. Fate always plays a very particular part in things like love at first sight and star-crossed lovers. And, looking back from the far future, Harry had to believe it was fate who intervened in his life right then.
Draco pulled a face like he was unsure if he should be offended. Like he couldn't process if he was the one truly at fault for the heap of cake on the floor. "Before? I went on your internet to obtain a recipe to make spice cake? Did you think I just pulled it out of the air? Maybe it would have turned out better if I somehow had…."
He actually couldn't.
"When I was five…I told my father I wanted to be a chocolatier. People smile when they eat chocolate. I wanted to make people smile. Smiles were rare when I was young…." The hollow smile gracing Draco's lips spoke of the fondness of his memories.
Draco raised his head from its shameful hang. "You are?"
Since the war, Harry would say the limited exchanges he'd had with Malfoy could be described as amicable. They were by no means friends, but he definitely wouldn't call this man his enemy any longer. Still, the thought of sitting down to have a meal with him — even if he was nice to look at — was a strange one.
"As are you," Draco muttered, unable to disguise the clear disappointment upon seeing Deacon already.
Lucius easily sounded disgusted and for some reason that filled Harry with the pride of having done something right. "No, no. Not yet," Harry laughed and leaned back into the cushions. He once again cut his eyes towards Malfoy, but made sure it was obvious this time. Made sure he seemed to gaze upon the man with a look of love and adoration. "Someday, I hope. But for now I live with my childhood friend, Hermione. We moved to the city together after we finished our schooling."
A mess he would likely never get out of his head.
Harry was feeling pretty fucking complete. He felt whole and full and perfect. He was content, he was happy, he was right on the brink of completion in more ways than he could name.
"Good. Great. Proud of you, man," Ron babbled off, forcing a smile as the kids from the corner of the store made their way to the front. "Have a good day, boys!" Once the door closed behind them, he added, "Little sticky-fingered gits."
was perfect. If ever there was a time for Draco to blurt out just how he felt, it was now in response to Harry's joke of a question. The setting was romantic, and they were both plied with enough alcohol to keep things relatively calm. Hardly anyone was even staring anymore, returning to dancing or general merriment. He would never have another more opportune time to just be out with it.
me? I could have understood that. I know that I will never come first for you, but if you had just told where I
With a shrug, Harry sunk further into the pillows. Despite their relaxing day of lazing and relaxing, he looked as if he was worn absolutely thin. "Try not to let the dogs loose, this time, will you? Last time I had to chase them halfway to the next village."
Harry kissed the pink strands once more, lingering just a moment longer. "It's okay, kiddo. You'll figure it out eventually."
"Sharif always looks like he dressed himself with his eyes closed, so I would say you look a great deal better than he will."
"So…."
Draco had a record.
Before he could talk himself out of it, Harry sat back and unfolded the letter.
Potter, being ballsy, confronted Macmillan in the middle of the Ministry atrium the morning the news broke
They had moved on and up with their lives. No longer was Draco trying to shut out the magical world. He finished what little was left of his potioneer training, eventually accepting a job with MACUSA. And, when his talent and previous Auror training was noticed, eventually he accepted a promotion as well. Lead Investigator in the Potions Crime Unit. Along with the promotion came a change in scenery. For nearly three years now, they had been working on settling into the drastic difference of a New York suburb.
"And are they…. Are you close to this person you dream of?"
Despite nodding, Harry leaned forward and grabbed a tart. He shoved it in his mouth whole, using it as an excuse to give himself a moment more to compose himself. Which was a terrible mistake once it hit his roiling stomach. As it began to churn more viciously, he forced himself to chewed slower.
"I did as you asked."
Harry made to follow, holding back an eye roll, but Malfoy hesitated next to him. And apparently they were still holding hands…. A fact Harry had somehow overlooked in his mild state of terror. Trying to judge this sudden timidity, he whispered, "Do they know? That you're…
me in my sleep for nearly six-hundred fucking days. This morning was the first time in close to two years that I haven't woken up to the harsh reality that I never had you. What we did…. It must have broken whatever spell Lovegood cast. Bravo for you and your magic
And I don't want you to answer me now, okay?" She waited for Draco's hesitant nod before continuing. "Second, I want you to come prepared to answer this question next week: What is it exactly that you want this person, this solitary person, to make you feel?"
Draco froze, spoon halfway to his mouth. "Oh," he breathed, the picture of unsure in this potentially uncomfortable situation. Unsure if this was something they talked freely about or not.
," Astoria laughed, her hurried steps heard beyond the door. Her voice sounded thin and Harry was unsure if that was going to work in his favor or not. "What's the fuss, my darling? Oh, and haven't we talked about the door? What are you not supposed to do?"
Without a second thought, he promised he'd see her soon before walking off down, feeling more whole and happy than he could remember being in far too long.
He was always running.
"Did you tell anyone where you were going this week?"
Shrugging for what seemed like the thousandth time, Harry put on the most patient smile he could manage. Which didn't end up being all that patient. "I've already told you…I don't know. I don't know anything here so
As it pertained to his ex, Harry should have told his husband by now. He should have sent him a letter the instant he was approached. Asked his permission, maybe. As backwards and controlling as that sounded. "Not quite yet. I plan to fire-call him tonight and break the news."
But enough was enough. Three years ago, he'd decided as much. But, as those three years went by, he never managed to find the courage needed to do something about it.
"I've spent two years of my life on our relationship. I spent two years…thinking I was with a man I knew inside and out. The secrets we've shared…. I didn't think there was much I didn't know. And to find out there was…." Potter shrugged again before pushing the glass away completely. "I just feel very betrayed. It makes me angry. And I don't really want to make a decision like that while I'm angry."
They all went through lunch in an awkward silence. Either no one knew what to say, or found they weren't courageous enough to say it. And Harry, most of all, felt the quiet was more comfortable. Even if Malfoy was shooting him looks over his salad, expecting him to do something. To say something or make a move to make his family further uncomfortable.
. Harry had fucking chills. He knew he should have been repulsed by the idea of Draco blackmailing someone. He should have been sceptical about what that meant for any future friendship between the two of them. He should have torn up out of his chair and left, refusing to be a part of his scheme.
It was this thought so heavily implanted on his mind which did Draco in. He could have still made a clean getaway. The small amount of Polyjuice Potion he had ingested was unknowingly more than enough to get him through the encounter and even buy him a little time for basking in the afterglow. He could have been so deliciously in the clear without even appearing to run away this time!
"Didn't you love me after everything I had done? Not despite those actions, but because they were what made me who I am?"
It was a joke, but Draco felt the greasiness of shame settle into his belly nonetheless. He forced a smile, thankful for the distraction of the bartender sliding him a fresh drink. He gulped half of it down as much for courage as for a way of buying himself more time to think of a smooth response. A response that didn't sound like it came from a man guilty of actually doing such a thing. "What if I was?" he came up with, hating the way the words felt thick like admission on his tongue.
For a long moment, Luna stayed silent, her head tilted back to watch the clouds roll by overhead. Harry could see her mouthing the words she wanted to say, testing their impact before voicing them aloud. When she finally seemed settled with them, she returned his gaze and smiled reassuringly. "Although I'm not one, for some people there is a sort of solace which comes with putting a name to their sexual identity. I would never dream of making that decision for you. You should explore this part of yourself however you feel most comfortable. I would only encourage you to keep an open mind while doing so."
Harry nodded just barely, holding his tongue. It wasn't her fault. She was too sweet and easy to trample over. "Let them in," he submitted, knowing full-well who was on the other side of the door. Knowing that Gina didn't stand a chance if they were made to wait a moment longer.
"I have no idea." Harry shrugged. And if that wasn't the gods-honest truth….
Draco shrugged, digging out the dessert from the back of the freezer. "It's not exactly a secret. It's just that Shea and Astoria won't help me eat it. And ice cream eaten alone is a bit sad, isn't it?"
This is probably too much information you guy's didn't ask for...so nevertheless, here's the next chapter that I
…have to get to work. Astoria has the early shift today, so that leaves you on Papa duty." Testing his boundaries, he leaned in to give Shea a kiss. One that was instantly shot down with a quick turn of the head. He sighed and graced his lips over the tawny skin of his cheek, mirroring Astoria's peck a moment earlier. "I will make it up to you later. I promise," he whispered. "Dinner from that Korean place you love. A foot massage for however long you need it. And I want you to tell me all about your tour."
Harry shrugged. His head was a jumble of too many questions and not enough answers. He wasn't sure what made sense anymore….
Harry wasn't proud of what he had done. The slump in his shoulders was absolute proof of that. But if it brought his boyfriend home, he knew he could find a way to live with it. He whispered a quiet 'thank you' to his friend and left her office. His stomach was in knots and there was deep guilt buried in his gut.
In a distant dimension from Harry's current headspace, he heard Draco's devastated mewl. He felt a shaking chest pressed against his back. Harry's worst unrealized fear was suddenly very real and he could feel his heart shattering.
When Harry's hand fell heavy back to his side, the corner of Draco's lips pulled up into one of those barely-there smiles. Draco was fully aware that this particular smile drove him
Draco sighed, tipping his head back and closing his eyes. A few stray snowflakes graced his flushed cheeks and he resolved right then to give up. He'd lost the bet. Had he chosen Harry for his team, there would be no bet. But now…when they arrived home that night, he was most certainly resigning to having to give Harry his well-earned prize.
Speaking of cake…. Ron had said he was going to try a new recipe, something rich and chocolatey. "If you walk through that Floo
A small, still-slightly-confused smile tugged at the corner of Harry's mouth as he nodded, attempting to process her harsh yet sweet words. He looked up at Draco for a little help and found him wearing quite a similar expression to his own. They shared a shy look between them before Harry forced himself to turn away lest he start to smoulder from the heat filling his chest. In the end, all Harry could manage was a simple mutter of thanks as his tongue was practically tied in knots.
… That sounded a tad too menacing for the romantic gesture he was attempting to make. Although, he had rarely done anything but scheme when it came to the Marauder's Map. And, seeing as it was currently folded open to show the corridor leading to their common room…
"Then I'm going to go ahead and clear up that erumpent in the room." Draco didn't drink from his own cup, he merely stirred it with a teaspoon. Every few seconds, the metal clinked against the side and jarred them back into the present. It was oddly grounding. "What all did Astoria tell you? I want to fill in the gaps."
And just like that, with a careless slip of the tongue, Draco's ten-mile list of worries gained another problem. "Is that how you want to go?" he whispered, afraid to speak in a normal tone. Afraid to speak it too loud. Afraid that just might make it true.
Despite being commonplace these days, this strangling between them still felt so new. Harry wasn't used to Ron having to keep him accountable, despite this being exactly what he'd asked of his friend. His instant response was to get defensive, the anger already bubbling under the surface from his conversation with yet another cocky DMLE compliance officer. But that anger wasn't aimed at Ron and was unfair to unleash upon him.
In complete juxtaposition to the slow way he was now milking out his own orgasm, Potter grasped Draco's cock almost harshly. He stroked him quick and hard, his pinky skimming his bollocks at purposeful intervals. It was clear in the hungry look in his eyes that he wanted this man to come suddenly and violently. He drank in every moan, every lip bite, every filthy word like it gave him life. His hips moved so soft and slow, his fingers squeezed so tight and rough.
side of the bed for the next few nights. "Mind if I make a phone call?" he asked while making his way towards it.
"Thanks." Draco's foot slid off the bed and he looked almost presentable again. The natural soft pink colour had returned to his cheeks, proof of the hangover cure finally starting to work its magic. "Feel free to come by later if you'd like. Never hurts to have an extra shoulder to try for days like this."
'No' was on the tip of his tongue. He only just barely held it back in favor of a stilted head bob.
"Oh, did you finally decide to quit? Good on you."
Harry swallowed his opinions. He swallowed his objections. He swallowed anything he might want to say to Draco in that moment. He also sat back down, nodding carefully. Keeping his words in check.
Harry wished he could look into his past with such lightness. "All I ever wanted to grow up to be…was real. I just wanted to matter. And now…I do. I don't want to remember before this."
Draco rolled his eyes and gripped Harry's hand even tighter. He would happily banter with this man for all eternity, especially if it meant holding this hand and kissing those lips even just one more time before he died.
not to feel the guilt and shame any more than he already had to.
Grimmauld Place hadn't been this full since the war. Harry had yet to decide if the kitchen full of Weasleys made him buzz with excitement or phantom fears. When that worry crossed his mind for the thousandth time that night, Harry forced another smile and took another swig of his beer. They were celebrating, after all. The ghosts of his past weren't welcome here. Neither were the shadows of the present.
Draco, who had forgotten to eat on his own signal, leaned in a bit closer. "What?" he asked, breathless.
Draco feel? Anything? At all? And how was any of this fun for him?
This short stroll from his walk-up to the pub was the most Draco had allowed himself to even think about what moving on might actually mean. All the memories he was going to have to let go of to make room for new ones. The feelings he was going to have to dismiss in order to give himself to someone else who truly deserved him.
"Except…this is so much more than delayed teenage rebellion. I know you're asleep — and I honestly don't think I could tell you this if you were awake, not yet anyway — but I think you're the one, Harry Potter. That I might even…love you. Maybe I've been in love with you this whole time, since I was thirteen. I don't know, I just…. I just hope this lasts. I need this to last. I need a win for once…."
"When you asked why…." Harry looked up and met the watery grey of Draco's eyes. "I responded abruptly and out of fear, for this I apologize. Thankfully, the general public no longer see fallen pure-bloods as newsworthy, so we've been able to live our lives more peacefully than I expect you might." Draco sighed heavily, appearing weighed down by the words he had to say. "But there have still been those who have met this organization with hostility. Namely Astoria's and my parents, as well as those who still adhere to old values.
Harry frowned, that statement nestling itself into his mind like a sunken ship. Draco continued, reminding Harry of all the good things he'd done that he should be so proud of. Things that had nothing to do with a war he'd never had a choice in fighting. He spoke of Harry's selflessness and his ease at looking past the surface of a person, into their soul. He spoke of charity, but also of a true desire to actually help people. He didn't bring up Harry's brokenness nor his propensity for accidental violence. All he spoke of was love — all the beautiful things Draco could somehow see so clearly in Harry, even though Harry had a difficult time identifying them in himself.
Draco froze. His heart, his breath, his body. He froze and he assessed those words. There was no way Potter knew…right? There was no way he had seen through all of those faces Draco had used. He had been so careful. He was sure of it. Slowly, he thawed and gulped. Physically gulped. Still his tongue refused to work and the words refused to come. He wasn't smooth enough for this, despite how confident he pretended to be.
As they passed the dining table, there was no mistaking the tension. There was also no mistaking the way Harry's eyes flitted to the wine glass when he stopped beside Shea's chair. Draco made sure to stay on the far opposite side, saying his sweet goodbyes to his son.
Deep within him, ballooning his heart and pulling the corners of his lips into a serene smile, he felt the light reassurance of pride beginning to take over.
There was no way he could deny the flutter that glint put in his stomach.
Somewhere within him, Harry knew he should be offended, but he was simply too exhausted to manage it. "And you're an enigmatic prat."
Nothing could ever compare to this.
, but you know stuff like that only happens in the movies, yeah?"
"I guess I'm still authorized for Floo access," Draco said quietly, looking by far the most uncomfortable and unlike himself as Harry had ever seen him. "I just wanted to check in on Teddy…."
". Seeing as Draco would have readily shagged Potter literally anywhere, he was sure it would do. He stepped along the forged path, pulling himself up onto the high bed with (he hoped) pure grace. This body was bulkier than his own and wasn't as used to careful, lithe gestures. Were he in his own skin, he would drape himself back across the pillows. He would poise himself in a gentle curve dripping with seduction. He would be irresistible, an invitation to be ravaged splayed across his silent lips.
Which was what he was here for, after all. Right? He'd been paid for this. He'd be paid even more for truly selling it.
am a well-groomed, pureblood son trying to right the world!"
Harry managed a laugh — although he choked on it — and vigorously shook his head. "Just friends," he stated, his squeaky voice sounding less than convincing.
Before he could consider the consequences of such an action, Harry finally opened his eyes and leaned over the armrest. He pressed his lips into the crest Draco's scalp — a ghost of a kiss, really — and pretended he wasn't craving a deeper moment of intimacy between them.
And then there was Shea sitting right across from him at the table, his fingers alarmingly tight around his wine glass. It was before eight on a Wednesday morning and the bottle of Riesling was already half gone. Of course, that was Draco's fault. It was all his fault. The anger, the hurt looking back at him, the shouting match they'd had the first night his boyfriend had even been home in months. He was also responsible for the current bed made out on the living room sofa. The only responsibility Shea had in that was his instruction for it to stay up for the time being.
Scorpius had been occupying himself on the floor with a pan and a wooden spoon that he now held out towards Draco. He was pretending to cook in the short moments he wasn't banging them together for the sake of raucousness. Grinning, Draco leaned down and pretended to take a large bite off the spoon. "Oh, so good! What is that?"
Harry took orders.
For a quiet moment, she merely scanned the newspaper while nodding. Harry's heart was in his throat as he watched her eyes move back and forth over the words, the crease between her eyebrows growing deeper and deeper with every line. By the time she finished, her face was more wrinkle than not and she heaved a heavy sigh. "Oh, Harry. This can't really be how you want to tell the world about such a personal thing."
arrest me. I'll confess to all of it."
' to anyone who dared to come close. It was more of a blatantly obvious haunted house than anything out of even the most twisted Disney princess movie.
If he were being honest, Harry wasn't ready for this conversation, either. He just knew he needed to talk things through with someone who could lay it out straight for him without flowery placations. "Yeah…first time…."
He didn't have to convey if Scorpius appreciated the present. His excited squeal did the job. The button could be heard being pressed again and again for five minutes straight. Each time the train whistled, the boy would shriek and laugh before yelling out the door, "Can you hear it, Harry?" Except 'Harry' always came out closer to 'Howie'. Draco said he had trouble with his r's.
Sighing heavily, Astoria focused her gaze on the Prophet as well. On the image just below the headline and on the fire and fury she never knew she was capable of. "You promised me no one would find out," she whispered, trying to allow the fire to fizzle out.
"Malfoy…how interesting."
But he couldn't deny the small swell in his heart. The excitement building for what was to come. The thrill of working a challenging case again. The anticipation of being so close to Draco again….
Helpless to stop them, Draco felt the warm tracks of tears falling over his cheeks. He hung his head in shame, avoiding the kind look and the soothing words. "What on earth makes you think I'm worthy of that?"
Draco felt his cheeks flush and hoped this stranger's face hid the redness better than his own could. This felt very much like he'd been caught. And if he couldn't remember the name he'd given, well that might actually mean he
Draco's fingers twitched at his side, itching to reach for the wand he had carefully left at home. Potter had carried that wand for a fair amount of time and would recognize it instantly. It was a risk he couldn't take, even if he was left defenseless and a bit naked by its absence.
Draco was the only one to keep standing. Keeping his distance over by the door.
Before he could stop himself, Draco lashed out, "What are you even doing here?" the implication of an accusation hidden behind his tone.
"Sit," was the first word this man – Draco – spoke to him in person. Like he was a dog. The voice definitely matched and so did the bossy tone. The overall appearance of him matched, as well. He looked like a right pompous git. His white-blond hair was slicked back into a low, fairly short ponytail. Not a single strand was out of place. He wore what seemed like an expensive suit, definitely tailored and probably handmade just for him. There were little silver pinstripes stitched into its black material that played nicely with his steel gray eyes. He was thin and sharp; his cheekbones looked as if they could cut a diamond. Every single bit of his looked poised and well-bred. Even though this café was decent and clean, he still looked massively out of place.
Just like before, all he had to go off of was a time and an address. It was also vague. It was weird. But, honestly, the weirder things became, the more Harry was finding himself intrigued. This Malfoy bloke was mysterious. He was obviously rich and could probably snag any guy he tried for. He was halfway decent looking, too. Once you got past his personality. And yet he was advertising in the goddamn newspaper for a relationship that wouldn't even be real. Sure, he was an ass, but Harry was sticking around on this one. Not only because he'd been paid half of the ten thousand pounds up front, but also because he really wanted to know what this guy's deal was.
Once Draco gave a blushing nod, Potter set himself to task. He abandoned his caressing of Draco's cock with a gentle kiss full of promise to the tip. Draco was helpless but to lie back upon the pillows, along for the ride in the only the best way possible.
"He's not a visitor," Draco growled. "He's with me."
It had been their first bought into intimacy. The first step into the reckless thing they'd been doing for the last two years.
Miraculously, it didn't take much convincing to get Deacon on board. Sure, he was a bit peeved that he hadn't been the one to see it, but he didn't try to convince them to change tactics. Within just a few minutes, Harry and Draco were rushing out of the office with a validated sense of purpose.
Pushing the thought of Draco's preference for a lack of undergarments aside with a steadying lean against the man's doorframe, Harry continued on just to keep himself distracted. "If you're not interested in talking anymore, that's totally fine. I can understand if you still need distance from…fromme. Or, from
Everything simply went downhill from there.
He hadn't slept since. How could he when he knew sleep brought the dreams? And how could he even compare those dreams to the actual reality he'd experienced? When he'd had the real thing, how could the dreams ever again be enough?
With imperceptible slowness, Draco shook his head back and forth. He'd tried over the years not to be overt about his feelings, mostly to avoid being rejected. Sure, there were signs, but he couldn't honestly say he would have expected Harry to pick up on them. Even if he had been a more perceptive person in general….
I manage a bookstore and we're getting into high retail season. Lots of exhaustive, long days coming. So just consider this an advanced warning for potentially longer wait time between new chapters. With that said, please enjoy. Can't wait to hear what everyone's thinking!
And only too eager to take advantage of Draco's need to loosen up by plying him with enough cosmopolitans to turn him into a loose-lipped drunk.
It was literally the only thing Draco could think about.
Even though he wasn't appearing as anything but collected, Harry knew Malfoy was subtly smiling. He launched this statement like a weapon, carefully and pointedly aimed. Narcissa, for her part, tried admirably to remain unfazed. The only surprise in her expression came from the subtle widening of her eyes. "I'm sorry, darling, who?"
For days, the wind had been howling. It felt like an omen. I couldn't help but to stand out in it any chance I had. Something bad was coming and I was helpless to stop it. So I may as well immerse myself in it.
Since Draco had left them behind, Teddy was pretty sure he could count on one hand how many times they had been left alone together. A fact he was fond of throwing in Harry's face whenever he had the chance. Up until a few hours ago, he was still seeing Draco through rose-colored memories.
Slipping an easy, fake smile onto my lips, I turned. "It's fine," I lied, feeling just as dirty for allowing Draco to get away with it. "I'm just glad you're home." I stepped closer, slipping my arms around him, breathing in deeply. Taking in the scent of another man's cologne.
," Harry said again, more forcefully this time as he disentangled himself. "Wait," he whispered, more inwardly this time as he sat back on his heels. He shook out his hands and scrubbed over his face, needing to feel wholly himself for just a moment as he processed the direction in which his mind was heading.
Narcissa cut her gaze swiftly to the floor, blushing a soft pink that complimented her features nicely at being caught. Malfoy had to have heard at least the tail end of what she'd said. Not that anyone would know it with the way he kept his composure. With his shoulders squared and his hands clasped and poised in front of him.
"I'm sorry."
Draco nodded with a furrowed brow and attempted to peer through the fire to the other side. He could just barely make out the back of Luna's half-plaited blonde hair and her arms poised above her head.
"Right, yeah…of course," Harry said quickly and grabbed the entire telephone, cradle and all. "Thank you. I'll just…." For lack of a better place for privacy, he silently thanked the universe for the long cord and made for the toilet. With only a small wince of embarrassment, he shut and locked himself within and promptly set the phone down upon the counter.
This update is slightly later than the last. I took some time to read while I had some time off (Read "The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue" by Mackenzi Lee and if you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it. It's a love story/grand adventure featuring a bisexual boy, a gay boy, and an asexual girl from Georgian England that features pirates and disabled characters and a wonderful love story. WHAT'S NOT TO ENJOY??)
"And what do you have to do with this mess?" Potter's words came out on a chuckle, but there was a hint of suspicion behind it.
The bad things had only followed him.
"Fuck's sake, Potter," Draco hissed. He shrugged off his robes — "You have to
But everything was a hazy, indeterminate blur….
"Define 'dated'…," Harry seethed through his teeth.
Theo nodded, lying back on the duvet. Closing his eyes to the sound of Potter retreating. Listening intently for that little '
." Harry sucked breaths in a little slower at Draco's firm suggestion. "Granger obviously has your best interests in mind. But she has to think about the Auror Department, as well. This little panic attack that sent you here? That's not stable. And we need you stable."
. His feet were carrying him to a man he didn't know in a gay café that was probably better known as a randy gay club. It was like the beginning of an afterschool special. Quite far off from romantic.
Shaking his head slowly, Harry muttered, "No, no…it's fine." He'd already given away part of the money. He was stuck in this, even if it seemed a bit crazy. Not that it hadn't seemed that way from the start.
Of course they hadn't. Most of the Wizarding world had been just waiting for something like this to happen. The papers and tabloids had questioned their relationship from the start. If it were possible, Draco's name had become even dirtier from the instant they went public. There had even been rumors that he was only in this for ulterior motives. Whoever started those rumors must feel at least half-validated after his very public arrest the morning before.
Most people would argue that eleven months was more than enough time to process a relationship he had chosen to walk away from. And, rationally, Draco would be inclined to believe the same…if he had even bothered to try the processing bit.
"I really am going to need more of an explanation than that. Since this
They bypassed all of this in favor of one of the doors lining the outer walls of the department. The entire trek, the woman prattled on about some viewing party Draco had missed. She didn't so much as give Harry a backwards glance until they reached the desired door. "Oh, uh…visitors have to check in, sir," she said hastily, cheeks darkening at realizing her mistake.
"He hasn't told you." Again, not a question.
When Harry finally looked back up at Malfoy, he took particular note not only of the way Malfoy's chin jutted prominently upwards, but also of the tell-tale shine to his eyes. It almost made them sparkle. Like mica particles glinting with sunlight in the sand. "I'm not that type of person," Harry said with as much reassurance as he could press into his voice. In reality, he had no idea what type of person he was. He'd never been faced with a situation like this before. If he happened to find out something bad — something
And he thought he'd been so damn careful…. Harry flushed deep red at being caught and returned his gaze to the table. None of this was going the way he'd planned it to. There was no surprise which somehow left him feeling robbed. This was meant to be a big thing, coming out. It was supposed to be a day he remembered forever. Something he marked on his calendar and celebrated every year like a damn bank holiday. But all he really felt in that moment was silly. He'd waited and fretted and obsessed over this for years just for his friends to literally laugh it off like it didn't matter?
while doing it." Draco grinned at their reflections before swiftly turning and blowing out the rest of his anxiety on a rushed breath of air. "Do I really look okay, though?"
A wave of shame effectively washed over Harry even as he dully registered another
Harry shook his head slowly and snuck a look at Draco. He also looked rather unperturbed. Cool, calm, and collected. An absolute cliché. "No, thank you. Do you live alone, Mr. McClain?" Draco asked, his voice just as steady as he looked.
Groaning, Harry covered his face. "Don't make me ask again; this is embarrassing enough!"
Frowning, Harry turned towards the door. Graham, the silent half of the parents, was leaning against the house. "Sorry, I thought-"
rough) draft of Harry's soul-bearing letter. She scanned it over, her eyebrows rising higher into her fringe with every line. As she finished, she slowly passed the scrap of paper over to Luna and breathed a long sigh. "Harry." He winced at her earnest tone. "Malfoy's going to break up with you if you give him that."
Draco nodded, reaching out to gently touch Harry's arm. "We're working a case that unfortunately involves you, Jeremy…."
"You're not
thathe's a boy, dummy," she scoffed, flipping her chestnut hair over her shoulder. Harry had to clench his other arm to his side to keep from self-consciously sniffing at his underarms.
"You're drunk."
to take Draco out of the equation. Not insert himself in his place.
Teddy realized how suspicious his violent head whip might come off far later than he could stop it happening. With wide eyes, he looked up at his godfather and nodded his head like a child caught in the cookie jar. "Y-yeah," he attempted to recover, smoothing a hand over his expression to soften it, hoping his hair wasn't roving telling colors. "Just played some Exploding Snap. Talked. Tried out that new place across from my flat. Pretty mediocre little café…."
The results only seemed to renew DeWitt's disgruntled mood. The man squared his shoulders, surveying them far longer than necessary, trying to find any flaw at all, no matter how small. Finally, he seemed to give up. Huffing heavily and recurling the parchment with a fervour, he replaced it with a self-inking quill and small memo pad. "Let's hear the excuses, then. Where were you tonight?"
Though his tone was easy and his words were inviting, Draco couldn't help but to shirk away from the idea. He shook his head, snatching Shea's hands in their pursuit of his belt. Hugging them close to his chest and continuing to take those deep, helpless breaths. "I'm not…. I don't think I could right now. I'm sorry. I know you're trying to help…but…."
Encouraged by the nicotine coursing through his veins, Harry made a violent show out of slamming both of his fists down on Deacon's desk. "No,
"I'm not the Great Harry Potter, Chosen One who can do no wrong," Draco mumbled, his face now pressed into the nook of Harry's shoulder blade. "But I, too, can recognize I am more fortunate than most have been. It's why I look forward to these Embers meetings. Sitting with so much history in a room…it puts things into perspective."
. It was everything his dreams had been pushing for — a place to belong and someone to belong to.
Draco and Astoria were well divorced before they'd started anything. Harry helped put the man back together again from the way that woman shattered him. Selfishly, he would never give up on what they had. But if there was a minute chance he could go back in time and stop the divorce? He probably would have. Three years later, and this woman still made him a wreck.
in ways Draco was sure he couldn't fix. Hesitant to even try, Draco sat up in his chair and scooted just a little closer. Gripping that hand back with what he hoped was a reassuring strength and whispering, "You can tell me anything, Teddy. You know that, right?"
. Which, obviously, was due in part to the roaring fire and, yes, because he'd willingly accepted more wine when it was passed his way. But he was also feeling warm in the way of lightness. Happiness, even. It was such a foreign, yet comforting, feeling.
"Everything
Stealing one last kiss, Draco left Harry standing there to process this new shake of his world. He made for Teddy's room, flashing his MACUSA badge at the guard on his door.
"No…. Draco, what happened before you decided to make that Chernobyl-level disaster?"
They had never felt like
Very simply, he wasn't Draco.
Teddy was being hurt. Violently. And all the signs had been there, Harry was sure. He had somehow just missed them. He had glanced right over the little bout of acting out. He had ignored how relieved the boy was to be away from home. He had ignored it all in favor of his own drama.
Malfoy adversely made no hesitation in taking advantage of the gap. "Harry Potter," he sighed and if a sigh could have a bite, boy, his would have taken all of their heads clean off. "And he's my boyfriend, Mother. Not my
"Drew," he corrected and very gently took the warrant. He was a short and stout man with a terribly unattractive mouse-colored comb-over. His eyes were dark and hard to read. But over all, his appearance in a polo shirt and khakis didn't set off any alarms. "Are you here to arrest me?"
But it still felt extremely off-kilter to know things were once so different between him and Draco. That he once would have been revolted at even the thought of consoling his once rival. But there they sat, and that was their reality.
"I'm sure you must have suspected Lucius to be a violent man..."
"Yes, a whole week. And I will come out of this ten-thousand pounds richer and probably have a great story to tell your kids one day." Hermione snorted a watery laugh. He felt tears on his shoulder. She really was worried. "Listen," he whispered, pushing her back to wipe away the wet streaks on her cheeks, "I'll call you every night I'm there. Just to check in, so you know I'm not dead in a ditch. I know what you're worried about. I don't think this bloke would bring a guy to meet his parents if he thought they might do something to harm him. He's a git, but I don't think he's down with murder. Besides, he's also a bit of a ponce. If they were the gay-killing type…they probably would've offed him by now. Right?"
Astoria continued to look sceptical, but she eventually shrugged and turned on her heel. "Talent will be arriving soon and they always prefer your help setting up, Draco. Wrap it up!"
This felt like Draco was ready to forgive him.
His mouth suddenly dry, Harry flicked his tongue over his bottom lip. He had a deer-in-the-headlights look of shock when he once again pulled back from Draco. "What are you saying, Dray?" he asked on the only breath he felt he could spare. With how rapidly he was pulling air into his lungs, he still felt like he could pass out at any moment. Like his body wasn't keeping up. Like it might be shutting down.
"Hermione, I've done something stupid," was the first thing Harry said since it happened. He barged into his friend's office, threw the little Muggle tape recorder on the desk, and practically threw himself into a chair.
Draco, with his life together. Draco, with his charity work and genuine nature. Draco, out and proud and happy with the life he had built. Draco — everything Harry simultaneously wanted and wanted to be.
Definitely not for purely selfish reasons.
"Again, that's all fine and dandy, but I'm going to have to insist. You see, Mr. Potter, I need someone who can devote all of his time to this. Someone who has no current caseload. And I need the best. I've been told you're the best. This is why I'm here and I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't shoot us down."
"It…it was an accident," he began with a frown. He hadn't had to explain what went so wrong to anyone who didn't already know the details. Even to his own ears, the justification sounded like an excuse. A diminishment of the trauma. "If all you know is what you've heard from gossipy Ministry workers, it's important to me that you understand that."
"Hey," he finally started once they'd both licked their fingers clean, his heart racing because he knew there was no going back, "so, I sat down with Rita Skeeter the other day…."
"And how does knowing who I've slept with help you with that at all?"
The bed still smelt like him.
"Fingers and toes?" Draco exclaimed back, scooping the boy up eagerly into his arms. He was never able to resist the charm of the boy. If he could hold him every second of every day, there was no way he would ever complain. "That's quite ridiculous, isn't it?"
"I was only teasing," Potter said through his implacable smile. "It felt nice, if a bit exposed. I shouldn't have said anything."
"Draco Malfoy."
The monitoring haze shifted yellow briefly when Draco winked. Harry felt his heart rate rise and blushed a dark red when he realized he couldn't hide the way Draco affected him. "Uh…hey, you were able to arrest McClain, right" he asked quickly to change the subject.
For half a second, Harry thought about being selfish. But he shot it down as soon as it came, pushing inside the house and closing the door behind him. There was no looking back – he had to save the day. He
, Draco thought. He kicked his heel into the mattress, pushing further up onto the bed and dragging Potter with him by the fingers in his hair.
The man, an absolute fucking dream under his stoic composure, shook his head and made a few notes on his clipboard. "I have a latte out in the car, thanks. And call me Draco." He seemed confident. Harry had yet to determine if that was good or bad. "Everything does seem to be up to standard…."
"Of course he does." Draco smirked. He was slowly returning to himself. Or…the mask he presented as himself. "The Healer said you weren't eating enough. Teddy and I agree that you fainted because you skipped dinner the last couple nights."
Despite his shame, Teddy couldn’t stop the coming grin. “Magic has a way of tainting the taste of tea,” he explained and poured two cups over waiting tea leaves.
Rita announced her entrance with a call to a fondness they simply did not have for one another. Harry's fingers itched towards his wand as she walked up the stairs, arms outstretched. He rightfully snuffed her with a nod and a stiff smile, refusing to stand from his chair. He supposed he should have greeted her with at least forced kindness, but found he just couldn't muster the strength. Not without unloading his entire breakfast over her ghastly neon yellow robes.
He put on a gentle smile, ever aware of how he was expected to be perceived, and turned. For what it was worth, Astoria hadn't embellished her description of Sharif. He was a few inches shorter than Draco himself, which he found strangely endearing (and not just because Potter had been shorter than him and he missed that dynamic). He was also blessed with soft facial features, making him appear kind and sympathetic. But Draco was finding it difficult to focus on that with those vibrant green eyes looking him over. They weren't quite the same shade of jade as Potter's, but they were trying very hard to be similar, which was annoyingly distracting.
It was a typical night when they were all home. Laughter and good food and creatures always in their personal space. A quiet night that ended in all three of them plus both dogs piled in Harry and Charlie's bed – the one with the ornate carvings in the wood frame. The one that didn't belong to any of them, but they kept as a reminder of what they had struggled with before they got here.
For a long moment, Sharif studied him back. His gaze roamed across Draco's moisturized face, down his vintage blazer, settling on his freshly manicured nails. He nodded slowly, posture stiffening. "I'm sure you wouldn't know the feeling." His tone hinted at a light-hearted joke, but the sentiment didn't quite meet his hardened expression.
In the end, it turned out Draco didn't need to help ruin his date — it was already doomed from the start. That isn't to say, he didn't at least try to make it work. And things did start off promising enough.
Perhaps the last two years had just been pretend. Perhaps Draco had just been pretending the while time. From the first moonlit kiss to the last orgasms of their lazy morning sex. He had pretended he could be soft and innocent and stay on a straight path. All while sneaking behind Harry's back. Bringing cursed objects into the delicate balance of their life. Storing forbidden texts surreptitiously on their bookshelf, right between Walt Whitman and a tattered copy of
Harry felt a pressure at his side. The mattress dipped and Charlie settled in beside him. Close. Almost uncomfortably close. Harry felt like his skin was prickling at the contact. His body was screaming his denial for him, even if he wasn't sure if he truly wanted to push his husband away.
"The same gentleman pulled all of these reports," the archivist said with a pinched smile. "But of course I'll need to see a warrant before I give you his name…."
But, even looking at the once destroyed viaduct which stood gloriously tall once again, it would have been impossible to even tell a devastating battle had once been waged on these grounds.
"Exactly! My husband and I own this place. Oh, he's going to be so surprised."
It all sounded tempting. It all sounded selfish. It all sounded like…an absolutely bonkers idea and Harry was absolutely in love with it. "And where would I sleep?" he cooed, his hips rolling gently forward. Just enough to get closer. Just enough to make his head spin. "With you and your boyfriend?"
The two of them sat in that uncomfortable silence for longer than Harry might have liked to. Between them, unsaid words crackled and died, drawing more and more attention to their tenuous acquaintanceship with every passing second. "Thank you for telling me," Draco finally said with a pressing softness. He didn't say he already knew or laugh or offer Harry an alternative way to say things. Draco just accepted it. Accepted
He was Harry Potter and he was tempting. Draco didn't know how to resist him. He was powerless against the temptation. It was so stupid and he hated himself for how he felt. He hated himself for making Shea feel this way.
"I panicked," was the only answer Draco could give. He just hoped it would be enough.
The only reason Theo had known that was because of that damn code. Draco wouldn't snitch even if he was caught. Despite the distance between them these last few years, Theo was still a friend and he would protect him for as long as necessary. Even if that meant going to prison for him. It didn't seem fair or right, but it was what it was.
"He's really good at the whole…blow job thing. And with his hands. That's as far as it went, though. I wasn't ready for…for more…. Not yet, anyway."
Veritaserum? That's a regulated substance."
But, also, one devoid of love and acceptance, choosing to keep a very important part of himself hidden away.
An update?? So soon?? It must be a damn miracle. I hope you're all excited as I am about this! And I hope you all enjoy! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts! Can't wait for everyone to see where this all goes....
Harry was certain a part of his heart broke on Rudy's forlorn sigh. He swallowed back the start of his own tears and stepped closer to the man, kneeling down on the uncertain floor before him. "I'm going to find who did this to him, Rudy. Your son loved you too much to take his own life and I'm going to prove that to you." He reached out to gently squeeze Rudy's knee and gave him the most sincere smile he could muster.
A moment later, the hospital room around him focused into view. Everything was white and clean – a harsh reminder of his situation. Draco was nestling back into a chair at his bedside, his hair down and an absolute mess like he'd raked his fingers through it too many times. He also looked absolutely exhausted. Like maybe he had been worrying. Somewhere in a distracted recess of his mind, Harry felt an inkling of satisfaction. It always seemed like a celebratory feat to put this man into such disarray.
"He's just some rich prick," Harry said, relaxing back and throwing his feet up in violent contrast to her ram-straight posture. "Draco Malfoy is his name." Hermione halted her steps abruptly. "
"I was hungry, so I went out for something to eat. Ran into an old friend…" Harry trailed off, desperately trying to hold back a small smile. "I didn't realise how late it was when I offered to walk him home. My Apparition License was suspended, so I had no choice but to try and make it on foot."
The look on Hermione's face — one would have thought Harry had just told her he grew a third leg. Her eyes bugged out and she appeared at a loss for words, her mouth flapping open and closed before she resolutely locked her jaw and sighed heavily through her nose.
"Y'know…," Harry finally said, turning back to see Malfoy still keeping at his same task. Malfoy didn't look up or otherwise acknowledge him, but he continued anyway. "I could still leave. That car's here now. Tell me now if you don't want my help anymore."
? Draco panted, parched from his squeals and screams. He knew what he needed — he
Nodding slowly, Lucius rolled the frustration off his shoulders and took a sip from his glass. The room echoed with the clink of ice, a precarious danger lingering just under the surface of the room's tension. Just under the cool façade he presented to the world. Hermione's warnings ran through Harry's mind. He wasn't likely to forget what she thought this man and this family were capable of.
The amount of times that had worked out in Harry's favor was exactly three.
"And if he was hiding something…." Teddy's ears pinked and he had to measure every breath. "If it was important, you would tell me, right?"
Before the image beginning to cloud his brain could become fully realised, Harry pushed up out of the window seat, as well. He shakily smiled at Malfoy, like he was glad to be in on the joke instead of fully flustered. The rapping at the door had faltered a bit and really only required a single nail in the coffin to cease. Harry delivered this by climbing atop the mattress, bouncing on the balls of his feet. He punched out, "
"Harry…." Luna's voice was soft but her tone was strained. She flung the rest of the bird feed into the air, not even batting an eyelash when some landed in her hair, and turned her body to face him with a serious look. "I know you're just starting to accept this part of your life, but there are some things you just can't say. Not all people on this community you're stepping into are the same. What you have in your head are stereotypes, and they simply aren't fair."
"I know," Harry muttered and leant down to right the umbrella stand. Like that would somehow fix the trashed state of their home. He set it back carefully by the door, gathering the three umbrellas with strange care. The black one was Draco's. The deep purple was his. And the ridiculous one decked out in a pepperoni pizza pattern was a bitter reminder of a silly joke.
Malfoy nodded, as well, and quickly pulled his hand back to his chest. For just a moment, he cradled it tenderly in his other hand before he seemed to remember himself. "I've realized I should have warned you of all this before you agreed to our original contract." He cleared his throat, jutting his chin up into the air once more. Looking much more like himself — haughty and aloof. Harry felt mildly comforted for some reason at the sight. "If you stay through the rest of the week, I promise to double what I've offered for payment. Does this comfort you?"
Trying to clear the obvious frown from his brow, Harry shook his head and looked around at the open space again. "No, thanks. Er…. Sorry, this is going to sound weird, but…last time I was here it was more of a…club? Did you change?"
"Do you need anything to drink?" Malfoy asked, pouring himself a rather large mug of coffee laced with cream. "I've just made a fresh pot. Or…I can put the kettle on. I also have seltzer water. Or tap if that's what you're more comfortable with."
"Not that we don't believe you Mr. McClain, but…well, we really don't."
It wasn't even exaggeration to say that Harry had made this man's drink seven times. He'd counted them all. And, in the end, this asshole was still upset and stalked out without his coffee. "I quit that day," Harry said. "Not because of you. Well…sort of. But mostly because I wasn't cut out for it. And also because you made me cry in front of a room full of people." He winced, wishing he'd held that bit back. "Anyhow…."
"My wards?"
"Does that make you more comfortable?"
His tone…. Harry couldn't ever remember hearing him sound so...ashamed. Not like this. Not ashamed of
Also along with the promotion came a celebration. Perhaps too much and too wild of a celebration. And out of that celebration came the most unexpected and beautiful gift Draco could ever ask for.
Every type of emotion took up equal real estate in Harry's brain, his thoughts a messy war between "maybe" and "never again". And Draco, popping out of his house with a seemingly genuine smile plastered to his face, truly wasn't making that war any easier to fight.
"Harry, look at me."
. But I can live with that. I know how to live with that. I wouldn't be living the life I do if I couldn't. What I said last night…. I didn't mean it. Not all of it. Especially not the part about you being cold. You're not cold. You're one of the sweetest men I've ever met, even if you don't know it. And the way you are with Scorpius? I fall in love with you again every time I see you fall deeper in love with that little boy.
I'm overwhelmed by the reception to this new venture! And excited! Thanks to those who have left comments thus far. I can't wait to hear what you all think as the story keeps progressing.
Just as his index finger moved along the Summer Triangle, the grass depressed directly behind Draco's head. Harry stood above him, staring down with his head cocked in curiosity. His shirt had come untucked sometime during the evening's festivities, affording Draco a view directly up through the hem. Draco bit his lip to stop a reckless keening noise —
Sometimes the best nights were those where they didn't do a damn thing. The nights where they would lie awake in bed, talking about nothing and everything. The big stuff. The little stuff. And those little batches of comfortable silence in between…. Those were Harry's favorite.
It was beginning to feel like he could conquer almost anything with Draco at his side….
is no mere boy, Malfoy. It's an abomination. A half-breed. An orphan who should have been slaughtered right alongside its filthy parents. Really, that ancient and most noble house of Black has quite shriveled up and died, hasn't it?"
"Knowing and recognizing are two different concepts entirely," Malfoy ground through his teeth. The small interaction, however, seemed to be just what he needed to wake from that hesitant stupor. With a shake of his head, he shifted back into the confident person he had been thus far and strode into the room after his mother.
The entire train ride back to London, Harry couldn't get his mother's voice from his head. The unsure and unstable way she said his name. She hadn't come back around during the night or that morning. He ate breakfast next to his mother in her teenage years. Which made things awkward when she started to scream at his dad about 'stalking' her. He'd never wanted to leave home in such a hurry.
Theo was better at holding himself in check than this. He was better at
around him…. It was amazing. Almost enough to make me return to that world. I was just waiting for his letter to come…."
"I'm happier now." Harry couldn't help the smile flashing across his face. "I don't feel the need to get drunk and wallow in my past. If I'm intoxicated, it's because I want to be not because I feel as if I have to be." Draco finally picked up his cup, sipping at it likely for something to distract him rather than to quench any sort of thirst. "The night where I took things too far and hurt the both of them was not my strongest moment, but I am grateful for it and the outcome. It was the culmination of my unchecked anger which led me to you, Potter. And I can't say I hate that."
Okay, so…Draco Malfoy had a thing for Harry Potter. Honestly, how could he not? With his hair always so endearingly out of place and that little beard he'd grown and — Salazar, help him — he was more fit than ever these days. The shape of his shoulders was swoon-worthy. How he managed to keep so attractive while working a full-time job and caring for a boisterous five-year-old was beyond Draco's understanding.
in the doorway, shoulder against the frame in what seemed like complete effortlessness. His hair was down, but didn't curtain or cloud his face. It framed him in the way a photographer uses a white sheet to control light and shadows. Standing up there, he looked even more expensive – like a piece of exquisitely chiseled marble.
had enlisted her services when he'd written asking for an exclusive interview. Anything involving Harry Potter was destined to be a big story. It was destined to sell papers. And the one person who sold the most papers on their entire staff was Rita Fucking Skeeter. Mostly because she was the one person who knew how to lie in a way people found disturbingly compelling.
At least one of them wasn't utterly useless here.
Ron and George were properly and dangerously drunk. In reality, they had been for a week. Tonight, however, they could pass it off as festivities and not a coping mechanism. They were laughing and toying with George's newest and most ridiculous creation – joke underwear. Most specifically, briefs that screamed insults about the wearer's own genitals.
"Just…curious?" Harry parried.
Draco very much not himself and Macmillan all-too-recognisable after his couple of months in the spotlight
Charlie nodded solemnly and folded his hands together. Replacing the missing body heat with his own. "Bring back good news."
"Morning," Harry chuckled, leaning back into the headboard and taking a calm sip from his mug. He'd found himself too nervous to sleep hours ago and was already dressed (if you could call a mismatched t-shirt and boxers "dressed") and a refill deep into his morning coffee.
If this girl was playing a game, Harry was going to lose as he simply didn't have the patience. He held back his own sigh and threw his hands up in defeat. "Never mind."
Draco followed Harry inside, only barely holding back another snarky comment. He could banter back and forth with this man all day long but was sure it would be a point against him. It was a miracle he'd made it this far; best not to tempt the fates when they had already been surprisingly kind to him. Instead, he gently shut the door behind him, leaning against it while he held aloft the bouquet which had been dangling by his side. "I—"
but that you don't lie to me, either. Especially not about this. Why didn't you just
Harry could read a myriad of emotions in the way Malfoy frowned. And, weirdly enough, he found he could identify with all of them. "No one's is…."
His little heart beating faster than was likely healthy, Teddy curled further into himself. He placed a hand over his chest, feeling the erratic beat under his palm. Feeling every happy thought he had about this man before him dissolving like sand through his fingers. Like dreams…disappearing before he even had a single chance at them.
"No, no," Harry stammered, coursing his fingers through his hair. "This is good, actually…." He smiled nervously back at the man. "Can I just get…." Trailing off, he pulled bits of change from his pocket before jamming it back in. "Just a water, if I could?" The man, whose nametag simply said 'Q', nodded and procured a small plastic cup of water. "Thanks. Now, uh…. I'm supposed to be meeting someone? I don't know what he looks like or his name. I was just told on the phone to meet him here. Do you-"
As if Luna, with her jumper made of tinsel and bells, could ever be the authority on the difference between silly and serious. "I just want him to know…," Harry muttered to the ceiling. "I want him to know that I see stars whenever he touches me."
Suddenly, with that small nod, Harry felt instantly overwhelmed. Pretending to be madly in love with someone for one day was going to be difficult enough. He didn't know this man. Even with all of this information mucking up his brain, he still didn't even begin to know who he
Less than a minute.
Harry awoke that morning, bathed in a brilliant and inescapable rainbow.
"Looks like your mother gave up," Harry continued when he noticed retreating taillights outside. They most definitely
Draco had never once thought of himself that way. Even with the job he had now and the case on his plate, he couldn't see himself in that light. Even with the events of the last few days…. He had done too much wrong and hurt too many people in his life to be allowed such a title of adoration. Accepting it felt like a sham. It felt like trying to shove an obvious Slytherin peg into a very Gryffindor hole.
— holding the air in his lungs until his head cleared of the muck. He pushed a breath out fast and hard before forcing a smile at the woman who waited patiently for him to acknowledge her observation. She would sit there all day if that's what it took. Afterall, they were operating on Draco's coin. Self-consciously, Draco touched the puffed and drooping skin beneath his left eye. He'd crafted this bruise from denying himself a good four nights of sleep. "I'm certain coffee has replaced the blood in my veins by now," he forced past his teeth, raising the paper cup in his other hand.
Going red, Teddy nodded. “I never should have done that….”
There were no expectations in serving drinks.
But Charlie still didn't deny him then. He pressed a comforting kiss to Harry's temple and gave his answer wordlessly by drawing a fingertip over Harry's prostate. After the stars cleared from his eyes, Harry eagerly took what was his. He awkwardly shimmied Charlie's briefs down and lifted himself a bit higher. On cue, Charlie waved his wand one last time before setting it aside. His newly freed cock was now covered in cold lube. As he settled up against Harry's entrance, the contrast in sensations sent an excited shiver up Harry's spine.
Draco's question was as loud as if he had shouted. It rang through Teddy's head, echoing over and over again until it was a muddled mess. Until he was questioning whether it was even a question at all. It likely wasn't. Draco wasn't a stupid man. And Teddy wasn't very good at hiding his emotions. He was a very outward person. "Yes," he mumbled, hoping to stop the ringing in his ears.
Harry looked around to ensure no one was close enough to hear and dropped his tone just to be certain. "I certainly wasn't prepared for it…." He sighed softly and met Draco's imploring gaze. "I just didn't expect some of those stories. I don't think I belong among this group, not as a participant. But I want to help," he quickly added as he noticed Draco's shoulders stiffening. "What I'm saying is, I want to help instead of trying to pretend I'm as worse off as some of the others who really seem to need these meetings. I have money—"
alone
Sharif nodded and pointedly stared at the table. Their conversation stalled, strangled once again by the weight of Draco's childhood. He cleared his throat, looking around the bar for distraction. Big mistake. All around them were couples, evident by meaningful glances and light touches — a slap-in-the-face reminder of his current situation and how badly he was failing at "getting back out there".
"Draco's brought a guest," Narcissa explained as she lowered herself delicately onto a backless chaise. Never once had Harry thought a piece of furniture could be an accessory, but there was no way to deny the way this choice of seating accentuated her perfect poise and posture.
In his current position, McClain was helpless to defend himself against the binding spell Draco threw at him with such vengeance. He fell to the floor like a lifeless lump, still wearing that eerie grin. His body gave a loud, resounding thunk that the men in the next room undoubtedly heard. They would likely barge in at any second. They would barge in and see this mess Draco had thrust upon them.
"I thought they were supposed to be gifts for you."
But this was not his body. This body had never been trained to be so gentle and he would just have to make do. To offset the skills he lacked, Draco concentrated on loosening the buttons of his shirt. He at least knew how to undress someone with a body like this. All he had to do was manage it in reverse.
With incredible restraint, Harry stood and managed to keep his shaking hands from reaching for his wand. There was so much he wished he could do to Charlie in that moment, but now was not the time. He would just have to find a way to be satisfied with justice being served. "Your brother is a liar," Harry said solemnly, pushing his husband's desperate hands away from his legs. "The evidence they found…it means Bill hurt Teddy recently. Probably when
"So you're just going to rot in Azkaban for this
In his years at the Ministry as an Auror, Harry hadn't dealt much with death. He had pointedly avoided it, feeling like he had most definitely earned the right to. So most of his cases involved robbery or domestic disputes. Small things.
They were always ending, he and Draco. Ending and restarting in a predictable cycle of simultaneous abuse. Never quite connecting on the same plane at the same time. Never quite able to get it right when it mattered most.
. Draco pushed the thought away and gestured to his own clothing. "Are you telling me I'm overdressed?"
At his side, Malfoy was grinning in his own muted way.
Pretending he hadn't heard Harry, Draco pushed up from his chair. He began gathering his things into his briefcase, making a quiet comment about the end of the day. About trying again in the morning. "We shouldn't tell Deacon until we're for certain," he hastened to add, his voice sounding panicked. The tremor of fear Harry was sure he saw in his slate eyes manifesting in the shake of his words.
On this particular night, "there" was a basement-level dive bar whose walls shook with loud music well into the early morning. Draco's momentary softness stood out in such a place…just as it had a week previous.
After Draco left — after he said that
"When I was young, practically a baby, both Father and my aunt Bellatrix were indicted upon some rather serious charges. It turns out, Andromeda decided to clear her conscience by turning over evidence against them. They didn't have enough to convict Father, but Bella…." Malfoy trailed off, shrugging in a way which spoke volumes more than he could ever explain. "She spent twelve years in prison, but we don't talk about that.
Which was why…he wasn't going to tell them. Not yet.
. He was being played like a well-tuned violin. (Or, perhaps, something less graceful like a tuba?) And it was just so easy to let it happen…. Especially when those lips tasted so decadently of icing sugar and the ghostly tang of raw ginger.
He started by purchasing Polyjuice Potion off a black market dealer in a dark corner of Knockturn Alley. From there, it was only a matter of finding the perfect subject to mimic. He found that while queueing at a food cart. (Not that he was there to actually order
people. He postponed teaching all of his classes at St Mungo's, unable to bear the thought of no one wanting to take them any longer. He ignored a growing mound of letters on his windowsill, sure all of the friends and family he hadn't yet come out to were only writing to convey their disappointment.
"You're not going to curse me?"
Ron and Hermione's home was dark and quiet when he stepped through their Floo, the scent of freshly-baked bread or simmering sauces glaringly absent. There wasn't even a light on in the kitchen. He mentally calculated out his week, calling out a hello once he was sure he hadn't gotten the day wrong.
." Draco's tone was more insistent now, efficiently stalling all breath or objection in Harry's chest. He leaned across the table after sweeping their water glasses and silverware to the side. Though he'd been the one to let go in the first place, he reached for Harry's hands again and squeezed them with voracity. "When did you turn into such a coward?" A sly smile split Draco's lips as Harry spluttered. "I mean, seriously, Godric Gryffindor must be rolling in his grave."
Ice replaced the warm feeling on Harry's spine as he watched Draco stalk into the house. He couldn't deny the words spat in his face. Or the way they made him feel. They were true, even if they were harsh. He was useless to defend himself against them. Not that he wasn't going to try. His life was far from secure, so he wasn't willing to give up the one thing that he did secretly take security from.
Harry hadn't known. He had just assumed if a child had magic, they were considered a wizard. With a frown, he looked over at Draco. It was a perfectly valid reason. There would be no need to question his intentions there. Maybe they had the wrong man….
"Perfect!" Astoria pushed up on her toes to quickly kiss Malfoy on the cheek before making for the door. "Be back in a shake!"
Finally managing to get her shoes off, Astoria straightened. Mostly. She was still tottering a bit like she was in a boat. "I was at dinner. Just not here." She erupted into a fit of giggles again, ignoring her friend's unmatched mirth. "What did you do now? This can't all be about Potter, still. As much as everything is always about Harry Fucking Potter…."
If they were a tidal wave, rare moments like these were the point where they crashed to shore and broke. Harry was grinning now but he swiftly tried to hide it in his own cup. "Would you...maybe say that you
The man extended his hand with a boisterous grin. "Of course! You have no idea who I am! It's not like I've saved the world, or anything!" Very cautiously, Harry completed the handshake. "My name is Deacon Bates and I am, as you would put it, young Draco's boss. But, you see, I don't like that term. We're colleagues in MACUSA's Potions Crime Unit. Of which I'm the head…." He ended his long explanation with a wink.
When Ron didn't elaborate, Harry's temper lashed out in the form of a snap. "Why not?"
"Are you still going to come around after you've thrown money at us?"
"I honestly thought being brainless was your natural state."
"I don't think that anyone has ever thought any less," Hermione said on a soft sigh. Her shoulders were tense and the way she gripped the cleaver pretty much confirmed his suspicions. As did the way Ron's body hunched in on itself as he stood all the way across the kitchen.
And Draco found himself a coward once again.
Without a doubt, Draco was ready to take a life if it came down to it.
There was a small fleck of blue in Draco Malfoy's right eye.
time for someone to come knocking. For a moment, he merely stared at his bedroom door and weighed his options — throw on a pair of shorts and answer it or hope whoever it was went away. But then they knocked again and he figured he had no choice. If it was his landlord, he couldn't very well ignore her. There was also a good chance he had ordered Thai again and blurred out the memory of it with never-ending monotony.
If Draco was being honest, he hadn't actually looked for longer than a few seconds at anyone other than Harry. Not that he would fess up to that. He pretended to search over the rest of the guests, shrugging noncommittally. "Most everyone's paired off, aren't they?"
Huffing a disgruntled noise at himself, Draco forced his feet to move again. He rolled his shoulders, determined not to allow the past to ruin his new shot at happiness this time.
"I would suggest you begin collecting your things. Mother has called you a car which should be here within the hour."
because you want to con your way into speaking with him, you may as well leave."
?" he shouted, trying to combat the rushing in his ears.
Harry gently set his mug down upon the nightstand. "I told you — he's old. I could never free Kreacher, it's not what he wants, but I can try and make the rest of his life a little easier on him."
"But it's still a great opportunity, Harry," Hermione whispered, like she was afraid of the words coming out of her mouth.
They had plenty of time to discuss things further at a later time. In that moment, Draco needed to have the control and Harry needed him to take it.
"That's a shame.
Again, Hermione sighed heavily. "Harry…."
Draco hadn't kissed Harry in over thirty-three hours and he was going abso-bloody-lutely mad. Which, yes, was ridiculous because he'd managed to go through twenty-four years of his life without having done so. But now that he'd had a taste? It felt like he was being starved of something vital to his being and he could not
Draco sighed heavily before speaking again. "If it weren't for Astoria — I'm sure you remember my roommate? If it weren't for her, I probably wouldn't have ever found out. But…she's working at the Ministry daycare and I guess those mothers like to talk….
Better than anyone, Lily knew what happened. She just often forgot that she knew. She forgot about that night and the car accident. She forgot about nearly killing her infant son as well as herself. She even forgot about her own brain trauma.
The deed was already being done. The potion – the
Even with the muffled scream piercing the silence of their house.
By some miracle, Potter laughed. "Are you saying I'm the type of person to suck a bloke off in the bathroom without first learning his name?"
In the next moment, Draco was overtaken by the most passionate and breathtaking kiss he'd ever experienced. So
Malfoy didn't answer so much as chuff a non-committal noise.
"Me, too," Harry whispered. That haunting chill ran down his spine again and he reached to refill his glass to cover the shiver. "I think I panicked. I think that's what sent me over the edge. Why I passed out…."
"Yeah…." DeWitt gave Harry a pointed look, well aware that the meaning behind his line of questioning was clear. Harry sighed and threw his hands up in the air. "I
what he had.
Harry
"We were pissed. I lost my focus. I didn't check to see if anyone was watching…." Draco shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his eyes flicking upwards a moment. "And I brought him home…."
Malfoy snorted, a truly unattractive gesture that somehow only exacerbated his stunning features. "No. No, they're human beings, Potter. Sometimes they just forget to act like it." He tugged at his tie, loosening it like he was being strangled by the responsibility it carried. Like being put together in that moment was too difficult. Like he, himself, might even be a fucking human being after all.
Perhaps too eagerly, Theo gulped down the drink. He barely felt the alcohol burn the back of his throat. He was so very used to drowning himself in poison by now.
' button on the recorder. Theodore Nott's voice filled the small room and he rushed to turn down the volume.
"Hey, kiddo," he whispered, then cleared his throat of the emotion clogging his vocal chords. "How are you feeling?" He knew the answer to that question. He was likely feeling like all of his insides were melting. Disintegrating. There wasn't exactly an antidote for the poison McClain had given him and the healers had confirmed that he had indeed ingested some. At this point, they were doing whatever they could to keep him stable. The fact that he was awake and communicating was a good sign, they said.
The silence stretched on too long. Long enough that Draco just didn't think he could stand it any longer. And that was humiliating. Deciding to call it – his grand gesture being nothing more than a fruitless effort – he stood, chair legs screeching on the wood floor and echoing the turmoil he wanted to scream out. He couldn't find the words any longer. All he could muster was the will to walk past Harry, saying goodbye to the best thing in his life with a casual swipe of his fingers through the man's ever-messy hair.
Above them, the squeak of a mattress broke their tension. There was so much left for Draco to say. So much for him to object to and stomp his feet over. But Scorpius' voice shouting for him came through the monitor in the living room a moment later, giving him limited time. "Astoria…," he started, his heart breaking even further at her sad smile. "I have a thousand reasons to beg you not to try anything like that, but none of them matter. It's your life." He stepped closer to her, wincing as Scorpius cried out even louder. "If you felt like indulging my selfishness, you'd hold on a bit longer." Returning her hollow smile, Draco encircled Astoria in his arms, holding her tighter than he could ever remember doing before. She shook with silent sobs beneath him, something he couldn't in that moment interpret as a good or bad thing.
in love with Draco?
. Harry breathed a mental sigh of relief. "Does that mean I've passed? That I can start fostering kids?"
A couple of years previous, Harry went through the process of legally adopting the boy who had already been in his care since his parents' passing at the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco had been working on building relationships with his own forgotten family, beginning with Andromeda, Teddy's grandmother. She often cared for him when Harry had late Quidditch matches. And with Andromeda constantly inviting Draco over for dinners, he was bound to form a real relationship with the boy.
Harry knew he shouldn't have been there. At the very least, he should have told Draco. This was the type of thing couples discussed before plunging into. Going behind his back felt slimy and altogether wrong. But he was desperate to fix this. It was an instinct now built into his blood from years of being told that was all he was good for.
to have conquered not only his subconscious for the night but also a person who found him palatable enough to spend a night with.
That sounded like a bad habit to start.
For a long while, all he could manage was standing there, confronting the discomfort of being face to face with his inadequacy. He repeated what he wanted to say over and over again in his head, willing his lips to just form the words. Willing himself to be brave, at the very least for himself, even while his heart ran rampant in his chest.
Teddy was going to be the bait.
"I should recuse myself," Harry muttered, letting his gaze fall to his feet. He was full of shame at even the thought of uttering those words. He wasn't even coming close to living up to his full potential whether he stayed on this case or not.
"So you listened to one of my sad childhood stories. Am I supposed to give you some sort of prize for that?"
"Nothing but the potion, Mr. Malfoy."
"It was…a very different response than what I'm used to. Still, I'm glad to see you again tonight."
Their relationship had been full of those near-endings. It was inevitable that one of them would eventually stick.
But beyond all that, his friend spoke of a real and physical place for support. His heavy heart and muddled mind responded to the knowledge of this with relief. He felt lighter at the mere thought, making up his mind before he'd even had a proper think on it. "Sounds wonderful, Luna," he admitted on a sigh. He pulled her closer into his arms, going for a gentle embrace.
Without a contrary thought, he helped himself to a celebratory handful of chocolates from the open, heart-shaped box on the counter. Eating them felt significantly less pathetic than he'd anticipated, especially considering the way his night had begun. He had failed miserably at that blind date, but the end result hadn't been so bad.
The day Harry woke up with sunlight glaring in his eyes — once again without having shut the curtains the night before, because he just couldn't seem to manage such a menial task — felt like the end of something special. The rainbow sheen across his room was gone and he knew it was now the first of July, his heart sinking upon realisation. The warmth he felt from his month of pride faded away and Harry was left…deflated.
"I have literally never said that!" Harry said brashly, rushing back into the bedroom. Behind him, the violently flung door crashed back into the wall and there was no hiding the situation. "That doesn't even sound like something I would say," he tittered nervously.
"Are you going to punish me?"
And Harry knew it was more than just a friendship blossoming between them because he couldn't keep his eyes trained on the blank white of the ceiling when he was aware of Draco sitting and looking so picturesque beside him.
," Harry pressed.
have been.
"You're not, either," Remus chuckled lightly, laying back in the dewy grass with his eyes closed against the rising sun. "I have to wonder which one of us is more stuck in our head."
Harry didn't know what to say. He didn't even know if there was something
"I dreamed of you…of
There it was. Just like when Harry and Draco began dating, Ron's issue didn't lie with the act itself but the person he chose to do it with. Harry wasn't the only one who needed to reconcile his old prejudices.
More than anything in the world, Harry had hoped this was going to be a good day. They happened occasionally. Very rarely did they happen when he was around, these days. It had, however, been quite some time since she forgot him completely. That stung. It brought a pain he couldn't quite keep from his face.
For a fleeting moment, Harry considered leaving anyway. Of going to see Draco, even though he'd been avoiding him the last few days, only showing up at the centre when he knew the man would be preoccupied. Although Draco hadn't called any attention to it and it passed by with no consequence, that intimate moment in the office after his interview with Rita Skeeter hung heavy on Harry's heart, clouding his head with what-ifs.
The longer he laid there, the deeper his fear became. If he wasn't careful here, he could lose everything they had fought for. Well…fought for sounded a bit extreme. His friends and the Weasleys – who he considered more as family – had taken to their relationship better than expected. Even the uptight Purebloods in Draco's life didn't put up too much of a fuss. Harry had vouched for many of them after the war. He had a feeling that swayed things. But just
Draco, stirring a pot on the stove, leaned back and allowed himself the luxury of taking the full view of Teddy in. He had only caught small glimpses into the boy's life as he grew. Alarmingly brief glimpses. Only just long enough each time to disbelieve how much he had changed. It was something he had most definitely brought upon himself. He didn't deserve a relationship with this boy after the way he had left. He most certainly didn't deserve the easy forgiveness or unrestrained idolization.
But if this brought Draco home, he could live with that. He could learn to live with just about anything if they could only just be happy once again.
Draco pulled in a deep breath, very much feeling like his heart was right there on his rolled-up shirtsleeve, bared wholly and begging for judgment. "The tulips say that you have…the most stunning pair of eyes I have ever seen. Nothing you haven't already heard, I'm sure." He pushed the spent breath back out, knowing there were tears brimming at the corner of his own eyes. He'd never spoken any of these feelings aloud and the pain was like ripping a plaster off a barely-healed wound. "And, er…they're a simple declaration of my love without the triviality of words."
so desperately. "I want what Malfoy has," he mewled. "I want everything he has. That's all I wanted from this."
When the dreams first came to Draco, back in the beginning when he thought them almost laughable, he had tried to cure them with company. It seemed the only logical solution
Well, maybe he couldn't settle for just the memory alone. Not with that pulling in his chest. That itching in his feet to move and take his moment while it was there. Which felt simultaneously so wrong and so so
All he needed was this. He needed a distraction. He needed…a taste of purpose, even if it was fake. And he needed the money. More than anything, he needed the money. And, so far, this was the only thing he'd found that could tick all those boxes.
Draco made a passing comment about the two of them being perfectly suited for one another.
"So…s'pose that's a yes about the
Malfoy took Harry's anger and shrugged it off.
After their publicly nasty break-up
This one moment could cause him to lose everything. It could be the turning point back to where destiny apparently fated him to be. It could be the end of this half-life he'd come to cherish.
"Yes, well...at least everyone can consistently agree on my vulgarity."
"You're worthy of the world, Draco," Shea said with an unwavering smile. "So quit being a drama queen." A disgustingly watery laugh burbled up from Draco's throat before he could help it. But deep inside, he felt that familiar darkness. The call to run. "Now…what else is on your mind? What else can I help you fix?"
Just this once.
." He was on his feet in an instant, a bundle of panicked energy. Not bothering with the mess of the window, he apparated directly into Teddy's room. Right behind the dark figure. At some point the invisibility cloak had slipped off Draco's back and now he was fully exposed. Had the cloak stayed on, he would have at least been able to remain in anonymity for a bit longer. It covered down to his knee caps when standing.
top, bottom, orgy, masturbation.
Draco was so lucky and yet so incredibly screwed. This wasn't his body and he had found a connection in Knockturn Alley who crafted his Polyjuice brews to last longer but that still only bought him eight hours at best. He was operating at that moment on a partial dosage. There was no way of knowing how long he truly had.
With those words in mind like a mantra, he pushed off the door and wrenched it back open. Staring the colourful glow straight on with conviction in his clenched fists.
"You know," Draco started once he regained a semblance of his composure, "I should probably get home. If I stay, I may just drink myself into a hangover. And if I'm going to do that, I may as well be in the comfort of my own home where I can't make any other poor decisions."
A feeling he pushed aside perhaps too quickly. He had been dreaming about exactly this for the last few months. He had spent many sleepless nights imagining himself in Malfoy's place.
They hadn't even begun to cover the subject at hand. Harry was no closer to being settled in this new truth he'd been saddled with than when they had started. But Draco's suggestion was tempting. And that wandering hand of his was a welcome distraction... "You're disgusting," Harry hissed, even as he pushed into the contact beneath the table.
Harry pushed out a long breath, ignoring his urge and falling back into the sofa cushions. His head began to clear with the distance, the weight of the world falling back upon his shoulders just as easily as Draco had lifted it a moment previous with his words. "When I return home this morning, it'll probably be to greet a DMLE compliance officer. They'll test my blood for intoxicants and see that I've been drinking. That I probably accepted a tablet of…Merlin knows what last night from those guys I, uh…." Harry trailed off, his cheeks aflame as he remembered what led up to showing up at Draco's door.
"Sorry, mate. I got to the memo too late again."
"Teddy stayed with me when you were on overnights. Remember? Back before you went to desk duty…. This is why I asked you to go to desk duty. I didn't want it to happen again." Charlie turned his head to the side and pressed a kiss to Harry's palm. "Bill stays at my home in Romania during the full moon. He can get violent and it's safer when he's not around Fleur or the kids. Usually he just stays in the spare bedroom and doesn't make much fuss. I didn't think it would be a problem to have them both there.
Draco made comments like this often after Harry laughed at the first one.
thing at that moment. "Then come live with us." Draco's whisper sent a chill down Harry's spine. "We'll all share the burden. You don't have to feel like you're doing it alone." With a single fingertip, Draco tilted Harry's chin upwards. He was smiling, so soft and serene. So sure. "You're a good father, Potter. Don't change that by giving up on that boy."
"We can't get married?" Harry breathed, the alcohol suddenly not sitting right in his stomach, even as an excitement filled him at being able to openly include himself in their community.
"You're still planning to stay with him?" Theo questioned after a long beat. Probably too long. He was being sloppy, but had to keep reminding himself that it should work out in the end. If he were Potter right now, he'd want something entirely different. He'd want to take comfort in that.
It wasn't like he was barging in. Monday night dinners were a standing tradition. They had been doing this for years. That didn't mean, however, that in that moment Harry didn't feel like he wasn't coming in on the middle of something. He still felt like he was intruding. He had gifted his friends the house on Grimmauld Place after the birth of their daughter a couple years previous. It was just roomier than their little cottage in Halstead. And he hadn't been using it…. Technically he still owned the property…but it wasn't really his place to arrive unannounced. For the future, he made a mental note to owl ahead. Just in case.
As lascivious as it was, that winning grin Draco shot over his shoulder really was a stunning sight to behold. "Well, you obviously walked into it without a plan, so I had to improvise. It's my organization directly tied to that article — I couldn't allow you or that dreadful woman to sully the only thing that still matters to me."
"Yeah... But I also I want to know, I guess, why you would do it in the first place?"
The challenge was to base a work off a romance novel cover. The novel I was given was "The Girl with the Make-Believe Husband" by Julia Quinn.
The woman, who Draco had been warmly instructed to call Cheryl during their first session only a month previous, wrinkled her brow in genuine worry. She gestured for him to continue his path to the familiar, jarring red couch and relaxed back into her chair across from it. Draco followed the suggestion, the weariness settling into his bones as he felt the comfort of the cushions beneath him.
"I should tell you what I'm going to do," he muttered to the happy couple in the photo. "You'd probably tell me not to go." They merely continued to smile, laughing at some secret joke. Between them, arms looped around their necks, was a man with an even bigger grin. The photo was taken on his parents' wedding day. Before he was even a thought in their minds. Back when they were young and carefree. Back before the man in the middle – their best man and Harry's godfather – started the chain of events that dismantled their good luck and easy lives. "Then again…I'm sure you'd tell me to go for it. You guys never were afraid of anything."
At first, Hermione's life plans didn't include a boyfriend. Or a husband. No romantic attachments of any kind. She had actually written it out in bubble letters across a dream board in year seven. And…then she grew up and the hormones kicked in. Even so, only with Harry did she ever allow herself to be anything akin to 'boy crazy'. Especially after he came out and most especially after their first screening of
"I just wanted to thank you for watching Teddy," Harry said gingerly, bowing down just a bit to try and get Shea to meet his eyes. Of course, to no avail. "He's still sleeping, but once he wakes he's under instruction to help with whatever chores you might have for him. It's a punishment he's earned and I know it's unfair to ask you to help me with this…but I certainly would appreciate it anyway."
It was dark by the time Harry had built up enough courage. He walked through the centre with purpose, his shoes echoing through the emptiness. In the housing area, only a few people milled around. Harry nodded at them with a nervous smile, but no one made to stop him on his way towards the end of the hallway. In a startingly short amount of time, he was standing before the office door. His breaths came out rough and ragged, his fingers shook, his heart threatened to beat straight out of his chest. But it was time.
Drew flinched at Draco's question. A telling flinch that poked a hole in Harry's doubt. A hole just wide enough for a glimmer of surety to shine through. Even though any person might start at the crude way Draco had phrased his question. "That's quite a violent way of putting it…."
Not that he had ever regarded himself as fully sane, to begin with. So why did it really matter? And it wasn't like anyone here knew him…so why did he care? Why was his mother's voice, whispering about proper Pureblood behavior, rolling over and over in the back of his mind?
"When you introduced yourself to me last week you said your name was Sutton." Harry sighed and found himself grinning. "It was a fake name if I ever heard one. Derek was far more believable. But, yes, last night I was pretty sure I would wake up next to
She nodded slowly, her own forehead beginning to wrinkle. "Is this about Draco?"
"A bus crashed a week before he died. Everyone blamed him. Teased him. They called him Voodoo Boy. And then he killed himself. To end it. Is that what you wanted to here?"
"Look, Draco—" Harry began, but Draco quickly headed him off.
"He…pushed a kid on the playground a couple years ago. And, um…a few weeks back when I was watching both him and Rose…." Charlie cleared his throat uncomfortably. "I didn't think much of it. I didn't even think it was worth mentioning. He just…he swatted her on her backside. Gave her a spanking. She cried, but…there was no mark because of the diaper. She was okay. And I talked to him about it. Or tried. He didn't seem keen on giving an explanation then, either."
"Scorpius isn't here." Harry looked up at Astoria, gracefully sitting on the settee. How could someone appear so perfectly purposeful even when perfectly relaxed? But she wasn't relaxed...not fully. Her jaw was tensed. She was angry. Or was that, maybe, just her face? "So, if you're here
Potter was dating men. Or, at the very least, he was kissing them under streetlights in Islington. And, if he was kissing a man outside of his home, he was likely inviting him inside. Why wouldn't he? Why would he allow a man to go through the trouble of walking him home if he wasn't at least going to ask him in for a nightcap? Especially when he had never been so chaste with any of his female suitors.
It had been…a rough night.
"Let's say it was." Draco pushed aside his drink, using the guise of intimacy to cover his desperation to be rid of it. "Orange, like sherbet, or—"
But that didn't matter. It was too late. The damage had been done and Potter was climbing off of him with extreme satisfaction. "That's all I needed to hear," he muttered and finished off his own forgotten drink. "Thanks for making that easier than anticipated."
Draco had enacted a plan and it wasn't exactly a fair one.
"Look…." Graham paused, watching the ash build at the end of his cigarette for an extended moment. "I know who you guys are. Who you really are. I went to Ilvermorny. I know your name, Mr. Potter."
With a swift wave of his wand, the door to the office swung closed with a soft snap. Harry saw what was about to happen before Draco had even crossed the space between them. He shrunk closer to the wall, trying to give the appearance of sealing himself off. They had these rules for a reason. If they started to break them now…. "We should…. We should get back, Draco," he said quietly. Denying his lover the idea before he could start to act on it.
"Right. Well, your lunch is ready. Go on, Mummy'll be there in a moment."
Harry allowed the silence to pass, knowing it was important for both of them to sit with the discomfort. He had been coached these last few months that this was where progress was made, in those little bouts of anxiety. It was where the difficult conversations began. It was where the healing began.
"But would you?"
His hopes were ill-placed and far too optimistic. He knew Draco too well to think he might freely give up without at least a small power struggle. At least both their tongues were too relaxed to throw curses this time.
Just like that the majesty of America was gone. Harry sighed softly through his nose and followed Draco through the doorway. Inside was a slightly smaller version of the outside offices. An empty desk overcrowded with files greeted them and right next to that was a small sitting area decorated in a contrary set of blue armchairs and not a single complimentary pastry in sight. The far wall was lined with three doors, two labeled with each of these men's names and the third labeled as
What Harry wasn't expecting was laughter. But now that he heard it explode between the couple after a quick, shared glance at one another, it felt like all of his worst fears had become fully realized. His eyes grew wide and it took every ounce of his restraint to keep from tearing out of his chair to leave. "It wasn't a joke," he whispered in partial skepticism. There could be no way they were really laughing at him…right?
Charlie nodded, a shuddery motion that absolutely reeked of unbearable nerves. "I'm okay," he muttered back and rolled his hips up to meet Harry's desperate grinding to accentuate his point.
There really wasn't a good way to argue that. Not that he blamed Draco for what the war had turned him into. Most of them had unhealthy ways of coping with the things they'd done. The things they'd
Draco had to physically hold his breath to keep from hissing something harsh. He counted to five before slowly letting it out, feeling only marginally calmer. "Right, of course. How could I be so stupid?" Except he couldn't quite contain all the sass, not that he found he particularly cared in that moment. His will to try had dissipated, and now he was just ready for this to be over and done with. "Look, Sharif, you seem like a nice guy—"
kind of tension – Harry let himself into their now-shared office. "He didn't buy me breakfast on my first day."
go ahead and finish dressing. She shuffled off awkwardly with a gracious smile, promising again that she'd only take a minute. In her absence, Harry fell onto the edge of the sofa and puzzled over what she'd said. Sure, he'd missed a couple of their weekly dinners, first because of the Sparks meeting and the second for a rescheduled class at St Mungo's. Which he'd had to do because of another Equality Centre related event…. And, yes, they were the first dinners he'd cancelled on since they'd begun them a few years ago. But it still didn't make sense for his friends to assume he was done with them altogether. These nights still meant something special to him, even if he had been too busy for them recently.
He always embraced Draco like that and Harry felt dirty for feeling jealous of it.
Potter did the same, waiting for the signal. "My boyfriend used to, all the time…." He winked, and Draco's heart dropped into his stomach, effectively sobering him up just enough. "But, I'll admit, it has been a while since anyone did."
"He's practically married to that Middleton woman, isn't he? Besides, Prince Harry really is more of a catch."
The truth was, Draco should have been behind these bars years ago.
"We really should get home," Draco said quickly before another word could be spoken. "And the case stays here. We don't discuss it outside of the realm of our investigation."
, obviously not aware yet of being caught. His hands were on the rounded hips of someone who was very much
The woman's face, which had the severity that said she was used to it all, didn't even twitch in response. She looked at her own watch and adjusted her glasses, the picture of collected. "Mr. Potter, I can understand your frustration. Honestly, I can." Harry opened his mouth, fully intending on making another sharp comment, but she held her hand up to silence him. "There are rules I have to follow that cannot be trumped by your fame, Mr. Potter. In cases like this, I answer to the DMLE first. As soon as I am allowed to share anything with you, I will. For now, please just let me and my team do our jobs."
He was drunk and it was hitting him right in that moment. And it was also in that moment that someone decided to recognize him and make a
'. My mother's family — the Blacks — are just as notorious for the same business practices, but Mother and her sisters are the end of that lineage. Andromeda was determined to end both families' misdeeds with one fell swoop.
(two words — shirtless Quidditch), he might forget this humiliation even happened.
"I didn't have time to pick it up. I'm sorry." Draco tried to let it roll off. Tried to tell himself he did deserve this in some capacity. He deserved the harshness and for Shea not to meet his eyes. Attempting to swallow his anger, he scooped all three of them plates of pasta and salad.
In the end, he decided he just might be. With another glance at the newspaper, Harry punched the digits in again. Before he could talk himself out of it, he went through with connecting the call. It rang exactly twice and his heart beat at least a thousand times in that short span. He could feel it in his throat, constricting his vocal chords. If this person picked up, would he even be able to speak?
"Well, Potter…aren't you going to fuck me?"
not to see that. His desperation and loneliness had blinded him. It was pathetic.
happened. Sure, he could trust what Hermione thought she had walked in on. But he would be more inclined to believe what Teddy told him. If he were to ever tell him….
From the moment he touched down at St. Mungo's, Harry was bombarded with question after question.
"But…apparently Teddy has enough werewolf in him to put out a scent. And…apparently Bill found that he couldn't help himself…."
Harry, whose tongue had always betrayed him in the face of Draco's genuine happiness, simply nodded in the affirmative and gestured down the stairs.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, but…I think it's a good thing to feel."
"I like that you mewl like a dying kitten when you come. And that the only word in your vocabulary when you do so is 'fuck'…."
"One of these days, Draco will have to grow up," Narcissa sighed, emptying her third Cosmo of the hour.
at one of your dirty, little clubs." Every word she spoke was punctuated with insinuations and venom. But if Malfoy was to be believed, this was her natural tone and her natural, spiny body language.
Before the front door finally creaked open, Draco overheard the muffle of gentle admonishments followed by a retreat of footsteps, both canine and child. He did a quick check to ensure he wasn't giving in to the nervous ticks wishing to break free, slapping on a muted smile just as Harry poked his head out. A seemingly harmless action which swiftly and effectively stole Draco's very breath away.
"It's nothing to be alarmed about," Harry said gently, standing to quiet the whistling kettle. James was too shocked to even register the piercing sound. "It's just hard to explain. I answered a weird ad in the newspaper. Some rich, pretentious asshole is paying me to pretend to be his boyfriend." His father's eyes widened again, even though he'd insinuated he wouldn't judge. "Not like
But things rarely worked out the way Harry expected them to.
This chapter has been sitting 90% finished for probably about a year. My life went from devastating to crazy last year. My wife and I moved to a new city and have new jobs. From this change, I now have more downtime. But I haven't felt the spark to write. I'm working hard to change that! And finally, this new chapter was finished out. I feel so much relief! As always, please let me know what you thought of it and happy reading!
Harry's Gryffindor bravado waned the instant he stepped out of his friends' fireplace. He wished he could blame that action on something tangible either Ron or Hermione did or said, but he couldn't. The truth was, he just froze. After all the psyching up, he had fully intended to just be out with it. Get it over and done with.
Draco desperately wanted to be able to look Potter in those impossibly green eyes, fists in his impossibly messy hair. He wanted to see every move the man made, watching every muscle in action. He wanted to be able to touch him and breathe him in. But he kept that to himself and merely shrugged, "suggesting" to stay where he was. "You know…since I'm already comfortable."
Although he didn't appear to agree, Charlie nodded. But he did make sure to add his piece, just in case Harry didn't know. "I still think it was a mistake for you to have gone there in the first place."
"I should…I should get dressed. And bring Charlie some clothes, too. He must be wondering where I am," Harry muttered against Draco's shoulder. He made no move to leave, despite the urgency in his tone. "I really should go…."
Draco laughed gently, lacking any real depth. His entire night, from the fight with Shea to the mystery of Teddy, had no humor in it. "I'm pretty sure I deserve the couch. If you had been at dinner, you would know why."
"We will solve this, Harry. Keep your chin up and trust your partner."
Draco was wearing a tie, Harry had just noticed. A very silly tie. It was an iridescent gold color which suited his complexion miraculously. It made the silver of his eyes pop. But the silliness of the print – the playful little cats covering most of the fabric – almost wiped that fact away completely. The Draco he knew would never wear something so strange. But he was and he paired it with a perfectly tailored suit that just…completed him. Tiny cats and all.
And, of course, to complete the picture of rich snobbery, there was the man himself. He stood in the doorway to the house. No, that wasn't right. He
It took a moment, but Hermione eventually came running from the direction of their bedroom wearing nothing but a too-big t-shirt and a towel around her head. "Harry!" she exclaimed, her hand over her heart as the terror faded from her features. "
"Our son is worried about you," Shea answered just as quietly. A moment later, the mattress dipped next to Draco. A steadier hand slipped between his own. Threading their fingers and squeezing with surprisingly gentle pressure. "And I am, too. I know that look on your face, Sugar. I know that weight in your shoulders. You're on the edge of a breakdown."
"Harry, what are you-"
and Harry had the disconcerting thought of never before feeling so at home in his skin as he was in that very moment.
Had they known what was coming, Harry in hindsight was sure he would have worried a bit more. Had he know how violently fate would remind them of their unlucky standing in the world…. Had he known how it easy it was to lose the thing they had spent these past several months obsessing over….
Maybe that was the whiskey talking.
"He's not just some rich prick," she stressed before resuming her frantic path back and forth across the carpet. "The Malfoy family name is like a ghostly threat in parliament. I really don't know how to explain it. You hear whispers of the name and suddenly…bad things follow…. The family gets their way no matter what. And when they do…. It's not good, Harry. Classism, racism,
Harry was sure he was going to need that drink as he stumbled towards the sofa. In the seconds that kiss had lasted, he didn't feel himself. He didn't…feel like he was
As he watched her dripping all over her sitting room just to make him more comfortable, Harry couldn't help but to feel like a glaring inconvenience. He frowned and made to stand. "I should have checked in before coming over."
. I had to get the Ministry involved…. And I'm terribly sorry to have to do that to someone I used to call a friend."
Even with the panic stilling his swift-beating heart….
He had to keep reminding himself of that. All he wanted was to go see him, even if it were behind bars, if only just to demand an explanation.
Harry felt there was no control for either of them in a setting like this. He had to assume that although Draco looked level on the outside, he must be squirming inside as well. He was usually better at hiding his emotions and presenting the face he wanted to be seen.
"Can't you just do a test and rule us out?" Harry babbled, his words quick and distressed. "I can only imagine how scared he is. He needs me."
And Charlie was the absolute worst of them all.
Potter put some distance between them, as well. He examined Theo for a moment, perhaps trying to gauge if he was lying. "But you want this?" he probed. His hand was still heavy on Theo's leg, seemingly not ready to give up. Not just yet.
"For you," he muttered and almost violently pushed up off the couch. Harry occupied himself with turning off the gaming console, ensuring he was facing pointedly away. The frown set into his brow would definitely give her the wrong impression. It would convey weakness in his sure decision. "But I'm not interested in administrative government work…. Even if it meant working side-by-side with my best mate."
The bank almost wouldn't cash the cheque. The clerk went through every single channel she could to validate it. To make sure it wasn't a fraud. And Harry really couldn't blame them. He'd never seen so much money in his account all at once. He'd never held so much in his hands. Just the weight of what he'd withdrawn felt like stones in his pocket. It felt like a secret he didn't know he could keep.
Unable to articulate a real response, Harry merely blushed and muttered his thanks. He knew what Astoria said was true, of course, but something still felt off about how it sat with him.
Draco had trust issues. He was prone to jealousy and could be, admittedly, a bit psychotic. He was definitely also a clueless git. He had issues believing anyone could love him for the person he was. He had issues. That was the plain and simple of it. And those issues caused likely irreparable problems.
How could this man make Draco Malfoy, of all people, want to be a bloody hero?
The words sounded awkward on his tongue. James was still so young. There was no way he could have known what it was he really asked for the night before. And Teddy should have known better. Teddy was the adult, as much as he still felt like a teenager himself in times like these. With his palms sweating and his pulse racing. With the anxiety eating him from the inside out while his most basic desires demanded he simply take what he craved.
Admittedly, Harry hadn't had that type of body since he was still at school…but that didn't mean he wanted his slightly thickened centre called out in front of a room full of judgmental strangers. "I'll try to find a way to take that as a compliment," he muttered between gulps from his own glass. He'd never had much of a taste for wine, but if that was the only option for numbing available….
Luckily, Draco seemed content enough to do the thinking for the both of them. He was so sure in everything he did, Harry really should have expected it. But he still found himself gasping when Draco hooked him around the back of his knees with his ankles and yanked him closer. He stumbled forward at the insistent nudge, barely managing to brace himself before he toppled over completely. Of course, bracing himself meant his hands firmly planted against Draco's chest and that really did do wonders to make him
the Board wanted her accepted into the school. They were gonna do away with my job, you know. Said this wasn't the "dark ages" anymore. Anyone with magic could attend, they said. Any presenting child across America would be welcomed in with open arms, no matter how much of a disgrace they were. So I had to do it. I had to do it all.
"You should go, too," Draco said quietly once it was just the two of them. "I have to bring an investigative team in."
A grin spread over Harry's lips, momentarily covering his ill-feelings. "Oh, but I enjoy watching you repair the same exact mug every. Damn. Time."
Draco physically halted his steps, gritting his teeth and clenching his hands into fists inside his coat pockets. Steeling himself. This was why he couldn't stand to think about these things; it was impossible to start over when all he craved was to go back in time.
"Well, are you going to tell us what prompted your revelation?" Hermione prodded into Harry's silence. "There's clearly something you're dying to get off your chest."
early in ze morning. I warned you." With that, Fleur trudged up the stairs and left Harry in the dark of the entryway.
"I can't even imag—"
"I still feel like a hotel would have been a better option."
Harry had every single intention of pushing him off. But the way his head cleared in that kiss…. The world stopped spinning and this man in front of him suddenly felt like the only thing that mattered. He pulled in a long breath through his nose before settling his arms around Draco's neck. Cinching them closer and deepening the kiss.
"Charlotte's not dead, dear!" May's gruff retort was much too loud for the hushed, relaxed nature of the group. Harry looked around self-consciously, but no one seemed to pay her much mind. "That strumpet ran off on Rosie for a little dyke around your age."
a pompous git.
unresolved.
"Yeah…yeah, it will." The corner of Draco's mouth twitched and he realised he was copying Potter's dopey look. He swiftly corrected this by covering his mouth and feigning a small cough. He also averted his eyes for good measure, distrusting the telling way his pulse jumped. He had spent nine months getting over Harry Potter, and yet, here he was, throwing every single second of that away. How stupid could he be?
The challenge was to give our boys new jobs. I recently read a novella by Dorthe Nors where she wrote the entire piece in headlines. It came across more poetic to me and I took inspiration in that.
," he barely managed to breath out between cackles. He looked up at Potter who was trying very hard not to crack his composure. Draco forced himself to calm down just enough to let him in on the joke. "It's true, Harry; it's
horrible." Draco abruptly interrupted his own stream of consciousness before it could go too far. For further distraction, he shoved his waiting chip into his mouth and immediately pulled a face. "Oh no," he echoed around the bite, also at risk of spitting the mass of potato out into a napkin. Knowing he would never save face if he did so, Draco grabbed for his pint and swallowed the mashed lump down with his last few gulps.
didn't understand why Malfoy had to pay for a fake relationship.
"Glad that's out of the way. That clearly was the most pressing issue at hand," Draco snapped. "Can we focus on the dead kids now?"
"If you sit down…I'll explain it all," Harry said gently, patting the stretch of mattress in front of him.
Just as his charm started to fade, a sickly grin graced McClain's lips. His gaze landed on the faded outline of Draco's Dark Mark. Admiring it like it was something to be worshipped. Like it was something to be envied. "You of all people should understand," he said and it took everything Draco had not to cover the Mark in shame. McClain's hand tipped just enough for the serene blue liquid to trickle out, strongly punctuating his too loud thoughts.
She wasn't sure and that gave Draco comfort. Just a little. He nodded, pretending like he understood. But he didn't. He couldn't. They had known Scorpius' birth had weakened her just as much as it had him since shortly after. It was no surprise. It was also no surprise that she was angered by it. But this…. This was all new.
Harry's eyes widened and he urged himself not to freeze. Or bolt for the door, which seemed like the most promising option. "Draco Malfoy's wife," he breathed, remembering the engagement announcement in the papers a couple years ago.
Harry didn't really know how to reconcile that with the very little he knew about this man, so he sighed heavily and looked around. They were in Malfoy's childhood bedroom and it was surreal. The rest of the house, at least what he'd seen of it so far, was pristine and intentionally put together. Everything was beautifully Victorian gothic (Harry assumed, because he really had no other words in his repertoire to describe it). Everything was uniform and decorated with the utmost class. And then there was this room so filled with teenage personality…. It just didn't fit into this world the Malfoys created for their existence.
"Mine, too," Harry reluctantly admitted, the alcohol bringing about a courage he wasn't sure he still possessed.
"Ohh, no can do."
"Coercion isn't a normal manifestation of child's magic," Draco said slowly. Seemingly trying to bring Harry to reason. "It isn't reckless enough. It's too calculated. Too complicated. I know you want it to be that simple, but I just don't believe it is."
Harry turned his hand over so their palms met, his own feeling shaky and clammy. "I'm an open book," he gently urged, even while everything inside him raged against that statement.
from all this shit in his 'perfect' life.
I'm not sure why, but this chapter was hard to write. That's why it was so long coming. But here it is! And my heart is still aching from writing it. As always, I love to hear your thoughts on every chapter! Comments are always appreciated! Here's hoping the next chapter comes faster!
And maybe that wasn't why Malfoy was the way he was. Maybe he had just been born with a penchant for rudeness just as he had been born gay. Some people were just born with a pinch to their face, saddled with a tongue which favored sarcasm.
Graham stood abruptly, glaring Harry down. Soundlessly daring him to deny it again. "If I had been more

"Oh, I don't think we say—"
bad — he wasn't one-hundred-percent certain he wouldn't feel obligated to tell someone.
By the point, Harry was about a hundred shades past pink. He was full on lobster red and grinning even despite his humiliation. "There is nothing to tell! Honestly!" he insisted when she made to protest. "Nothing happened, despite what either of you two tarts want to imagine. Draco and I are
Sure enough, within minutes, the alarm quieted and he was face to face with a DMLE officer who in no way looked happy to be on patrol during any part of Valentine's Day, let alone the night shift. Not long ago, Harry was flummoxed whenever an officer simply Apparated into his home. But this had become commonplace now, so he forced a smile and stepped away from the wall in a show of cooperation. "Evening, Officer…." He peered through the dim candlelight at the badge on the man's chest. "Officer DeWitt? I don't believe we've met—"
"You're awake."
"I lost count," he admitted a bit sheepishly. He was sure the total exceeded two bottles of wine by now. It was probably a miracle he was coherent at all.
"I'm not
"This isn't going to help anything," Harry hiss-whispered to Draco. For privacy's sake, they had decided to conduct the interview up in the Malfoys' residential space above. Seated in the same recliner he'd occupied almost a week before, Harry found a semblance of comfort in the familiar surroundings. Draco had set out a tray of tea — kept under stasis at the perfect drinkable temperature — and mini lemon tarts on the coffee table. The windows were open, allowing the gentle summer breeze to fill the sitting room. Draco had crafted a perfectly comfortable setting and promised to stay throughout the entire interview. Even still, Harry was in danger of sweating through his t-shirt both from nerves and agitation. "I can't do this."
don't like it when I bring people back."
," he exclaimed, likely scrabbling for some sense of control through the panic eating away inside of him. "What good is having a house-elf if you're not having him do a damn thing?"
