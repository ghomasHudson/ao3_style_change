He did his best to partake in the conversation, in truth, he felt very glad to be back at The Burrow. He had always loved how warm it felt, and all the commotion that filled the walls. He’d really never felt more at home anywhere else besides Hogwarts, or unless of course home were a person in which case he felt Draco might just out win both by a good bit.
Potter looked at him for a moment before replying with, “yeah” and a curt nod of his dark brown head.
2nd of course...of course, my Draco chapters are always a little more interesting, so hoping not to disappoint with this next one!
“I came here and met all of you, and I have to say I’m amazed Harry didn’t turn out to be as hateful as you lot. To be quite honest, you’re all lucky that Harry doesn’t hold a grudge against you for the way you’ve treated him his whole life. Luckily, he has someone like me who is only too happy to hold the grudge for him. You’re all terrible people, and if you knew me at all you’d know that’s a lot coming from me, trust me. Harry is incredible, and you’re missing out on that because you’re jealous, again something I would know first-hand.” Draco paused for a moment to clear his throat, and presumably catch his breath as it was clear he had unmistakably shocked himself with his own words, if his facial expressions were anything to go on.
Potter gazed up at him, his eyes searching, his mouth grinning back at Draco for a long moment before his eyes darted to look over out at the exit of their tunnel. “Stopped raining,” the brunette spoke with a nod towards where his eyes had traveled. Draco glanced, without moving from his spot bracketing Potter into the wall, and nodded in response, “I hadn’t noticed,” he stated granting Potter his full attention his eyes conveying something like, ‘I hadn’t noticed I’d been too preoccupied with your mouth, Potter.’
“This is the bit I’ve explained to ‘Mione…Draco gets me in ways that might be hard for the two of you to understand. Voldemort’s taken up residence in his home, he’s seen things like I have, he’s seen Voldemort…he gets nightmares like I do, and I can talk to him.”
he let spill from his lips in a moan, he couldn’t even hold them back anymore. He knew he was close to coming, and the fact that Draco had admitted the same only made him all the more determined. He wanted to see that blonde head in front of him thrown back in ecstasy, with his name on the boy’s lips as he let go.
longer than the bond, and I knew that it was a lot to hope that what you felt for me wasn’t only just the bond. I was afraid that if you knew that there was an expiration date, and not only that, but that I had been keeping it from you, you’d change your mind about all of this,” motioning between them, Draco finished with a breath feeling at the very least a bit lighter but also very tense awaiting Harry’s reaction.
“Draco,” it wasn’t spoken by Harry, but by a very soft-spoken Hermione. Draco lifted his eyes to meet her expression and was met with one of concern. “What is it?” She asked, voice matching her gaze.
….Harry knew he wasn’t typically brilliant with words anyways, but he knew he was shit now. He ran his hand from Draco’s face down his neck, and to the hem of his shirt and felt the other boy shiver, in turn making his own skin prickle. He hesitated for only a moment, before again letting his boldness overtake him, and sliding a hand under Draco’s t-shirt and over the soft warm skin of his stomach. Harry lost himself trailing along all the bumps and ridges, dragging his fingers through the line of hair running from Draco’s navel to the edge of his pajama bottoms and could feel himself blush furiously as Draco made a noise so sensuous, he thought he would burst just from hearing it.
With his heart clenched, he turned to face Harry who was sprawled out in the sun in their most recent favorite of all of the brunette’s hiding places. It was a small clearing surrounded by trees, tucked back just a little way from privet drive. Often opting for seclusion to avoid any other run-ins with Dudley and his band of misfits. He reached out a hand, running it through the brunette’s unruly locks earning a contented sigh from Harry as he nuzzled up into Draco’s touch.
“Harry, - I’m, - I’m gonna come,” it was really all the encouragement Harry needed. He moved his remaining hand from Draco’s hip and tried to create some friction for his own strained prick as he keenly sucked Draco’s cock desperate to see him fall apart.
“Of course, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said, completely unable to hide his grin that daft wanker, Draco thought keenly.
He didn’t think Pansy would dare approach him out in the open on the platform, especially without knowing the damage his absence had caused over the summer. For all he knew he was already an outcast within the pureblood community, and for the millionth time that summer he felt a surge of anger run through his veins at Severus keeping him in the dark.
Potter’s eyes shot back up and met Draco’s intently, he could feel the brunette searching for something there, and Draco only hoped he could supply whatever it was that he needed. It was in that moment that Draco knew he and Potter were more alike than either of them could admit both to each other and to themselves. And even though that was true, the part about having trouble admitting it, that is, Draco knew he could feel safe sharing this with him.
“Oh, Draco dear, I do hope you’ve been watching after our Harry this summer.” She reached out to him, throwing Draco completely off balance as she pulled him into her warmth for a snug hug.  Then pulled back, still holding him at arm’s length; giving him the same assessment she’d given Harry only moments ago. Although, this time he felt that despite her warm demeanor she was assessing him for proof that he had in fact looked after Harry that summer.
Harry, someone who had never read a book for pleasure in his entire life found it hard to empathize with the Draco. Although, Harry, someone who had spent way too much agonizing time alone in his own head could do more than empathize with him. He didn’t see why they couldn’t get on one of the buses into town, surely there was a book store of some sort there. As he verbalized this to Draco, he was met with a genuine grin, the kind that reached his eyes and found that it was entirely contagious, but his brain didn’t linger on that.
Before he could even reason with breaking the silence stretching between them, Harry moved. He reached across the chasm for Draco, and curled into him wrapping his limbs around him in such a way that all Draco could do was bury his face in the other boy’s bronze neck and breath him in. They both reacted to one another as if they’d been starved for ages without the other’s touch, and Draco drank it all in.
“Oh, good Potter, you can still read,” Malfoy says with a roll of his eyes. “Look, if you don’t want it, I’m sure…” he begins, looking hesitant and a little dejected.
He knew everything was different now, his Godfather was dead, Voldemort was most definitely back, and ultimately the wizarding world was on the brink of war. Harry found that he spent most of his time locked away in his thoughts, unsure of how to share them with anyone but himself. He was jolted out of his usual stupor with an elbow to the shoulder from Hermione. As his eyes blinked in acclimation, he realized he couldn’t even remember how he got to potions class. He looked up into Professor Snape’s dark eyes as the man stared down at him, he had never been more grateful that this was the last Potions class of the term, though he wasn’t much looking forward to the summer.
“Ha! You can’t fool me slag, I know you’re not allowed to use that thing outside of school,” Dudley spat at Draco with a nod towards his wand. “This is what you get for calling me a fag the other day, fuck you, you fucking queers,” he spat more venomously this time.
“What?” Harry watched Draco turn to look around, probably in search of whatever had Harry in such a twist, and then back to look at him.
Draco was roused back with a slight tap on their bedroom door. Draco felt his heart race, as his head jerked up from Harry’s head and looked from the door, to Harry and then back to the door again. He was at a loss, he certainly didn’t want to wake up the sleeping boy curled up in his arms, but he also had no idea who was on the other side of the door.
Harry gave a laugh and a nod in response to the blonde’s question and they entered the restaurant. Unsurprisingly, Draco had him laughing through the whole meal. He told Harry stories about life in Slytherin, that had him wiping tears from the corners of his eyes he’d laughed so hard.
Harry’s eyes darted down to the sliver of fair skin on Malfoy’s hip that had been revealed in the process, and then quickly shot his eyes back up to the other boy’s, desperately hoping to avoid a blush, but feeling his face heat anyways. His body always seemed traitorous when it came to Malfoy, and he was only just able to think of a quick lie in answer of the other boy’s question.  Bravely, he mirrored Malfoy and turned on his side, peering up and meeting his gaze, “I was just thinking about my birthday, it’s exactly a week from today.”
They’d existed in a bubble all summer, just the two of them, not even the Dursley’s acknowledged them anymore. What would life outside Privet Drive be like with Draco, what could having a life outside of their summer and their tunnel mean about Harry?
Before he could continue to dwell on his disappointment for much longer, he felt the warm skin pressed against him begin to shift and knew Harry was waking up. Harry let out a soft groan and buried himself into the crook of Draco’s neck, and the blonde smiled to himself, wondering how they had grown so comfortable with one another, how had they gotten here, how did Draco deserve this? He knew he was becoming addicted and spoiled, and it was only going to make the end of summer that much more agonizing.
The two boys watched mutely as Dudley nodded at his two cronies, and before Draco could think about it or react, one of the hefty boys had hoisted him up by his biceps yanking his arms behind his back and keeping him in place with his back pressed against the foreign boy’s chest. By the time Draco could recover, his eyes locked with Potter’s who seemed to be in the same position as him struggling against his assailant.
year common room gazing at ‘boy wonder;’ head thrown back in a carefree laugh at something Weasley had said. Draco was of course tucked away, not as keen to be caught in his own carefree staring.
“You’ve gone soft, Malfoy, you know that don’t you,” Harry teased with a grin knocking their shoulders together making the bond thrum and the ache slacken. “I wonder who’s fault that is, Potter,” Draco replied soft smile fully in place.
Harry shifted his head into his hands, rubbing his eyes and groaning to himself internally. “You don’t seem surprised,” Malfoy spoke inquisitively, tilting his head to the side, “happen often then?”
He rolled them so that Harry’s back was flat against the mattress, and Draco was nestled between the boy’s thighs. He felt so incredibly tempted to roll his hips, giving both of their already hard lengths some desperately needed friction, but knew if he did it would be over as soon as it had begun, and he wanted Harry to remember this; he wanted to remember this.
. Touring back through all their favorite hideaways that summer and finding their way back to their tunnel for the first time,
The more I write the more I realize how close we are to the end of this fic. It's bitter sweet for me, this is the longest thing I've ever written which is exciting but I will be sad when it's over! :)
Draco closed his eyes to steady himself, “I, I need to tell you something,” he eased it out in one breath only opening his eyes to gauge the other boy’s reaction before gaining the courage to continue. Harry’s face grew concerned, the half-smile hidden away, and Draco felt the loss painfully.
He felt the blonde relax into his arms and press his cheek firmly to meet his own, wrapping his arms securely around Harry’s waist. They stood like that for a long moment, content to just be with one another after what felt like ages of separation. Harry let the realization of just how difficult this school year was going to be wash over him, and not for the first time either. His mind had been frantic that last few days, knowing that bond or no bond his desire to be this near Draco would be insatiable as always.
Harry sat up, cross-legged and fully faced the other boy, his heart beating madly. Perhaps, in the least likely of all places, Harry had found someone he could share this burden with. He urged Malfoy on with his eyes, not daring to speak in fear that it would break the spell and the blonde would fall silent. After all, Harry knew that either of them sharing this part of themselves with the other was risky business, and it meant mustering up a large amount of courage as well as, taking a leap of faith.
“It’s Malfoy though, Harry, Malfoy!” Draco mused that Weasley was starting to lose it as his whispers became a bit strained.
“Yeah, I have to be honest I’ve never been much of a reader,” Draco gains a little bit of his arrogance back “Oh what a revelation Potter, tell me something none of us knew already,” but he says it without malice and a half smirk on his lips.
The one saving grace he felt he had was the fact that he and Harry were indeed still bonded together, therefore, he wouldn’t ever be too far away if Draco needed him.
He leaned down again gripping Harry’s cock at the base and placed a kiss to the head before taking him into his mouth as much as he could. He felt Harry tense up and heard him let out an agonized groan as Draco slowly dragged his tongue along the base before circling the head and taking him as deep as his throat would allow.
Harry began to let his eyes wander around the shop, he knew he was supposed to be engaged in conversation about broom sticks and this year’s Quidditch teams and, and, and…
“Honestly Harry, you’re going to have to work much harder if you’re planning on keeping this from everyone for the remainder of the week,” she heaved out with a huff crossing her arms over her chest.
Whether or not Remus had witnessed the display he didn’t let on, he simply held out his arm and let both boys take hold before aparating them to just outside the burrow with a flash.
The fact that Draco had just watched someone be physically abused over something they couldn’t control infuriated him, and it was in that moment he thought of Hermione Granger and all the pain he had probably personally caused her over something she had no control over, he thought of all the Hermione Grangers’ he had personally caused pain to and was hit with a wave of immense guilt.
He was pulled from his thoughts like so many other times that summer by Harry. Both of them were meant to be packing, getting ready to leave tomorrow. The idea had been to pack now, so they didn’t have to leave their cot until the very last second, all Harry’s sinister plot.
She returned his smile, and just as she pulled back her hand, the rest of the Weasley clan burst into the dining room and all at once the small space was filled with shouts and bouts of laughter. His eyes instantly found Harry’s and the gentle smile remained on his face for the rest of dinner.
The problem was that Draco found that after he was faced with the reality of what his father’s ideals involved, he just didn’t feel as strongly for them, which was tearing him up inside, and why he had spent the majority of the school year trapped inside himself. It was one thing to go around flaunting blood superiority when it didn’t involve murdering muggles in cold blood, but another thing entirely when he was forced to watch as Lord Voldemort and his clan of Death Eaters tortured and killed innocent people as an after-dinner sport. Deep down Draco knew he didn’t have the stomach, fanatical devotion, or zealous ambition to carry him through as a successful Death Eater. But however unqualified or terrified he was, he didn’t want to alienate himself from his parents. No matter the circumstances they were his family, Draco loved them, he didn’t want to lose them, especially not his mother. He couldn’t bear to think about what his mother might think of him if she knew what he’d spent his time agonizing over. Draco couldn’t imagine how she would feel about her son if she knew who he truly was; a coward, and not just for wanting to avoid taking the mark and following the Dark Lord. Draco knew his mother was much too clever to ever fully support someone as reckless and unpredictable as Voldemort, but she was bound by her marriage vows to always support his father; zealously ambitious.
“Well, if I have to be someone’s insufferable Gryffindor, there’s no one else’s I’d rather be Malfoy.”
Draco honestly didn’t know how much longer he was going to last. It felt like every single shoulder brush, and lingering touch from the last few weeks had built up to this moment and now he was a tingling mess, and he felt like an overworked school boy who was about to come in his fucking pants, and from snogging, no less.
“Fuck, you’re amazing Potter. If this is what looking after you entails, I’ll do it for the rest of eternity.”
Draco heard the knock on his door and knew instantly that it was Potter. No one else had dared to come looking for him all of term, it wasn’t difficult to deduce who it might be. It wasn’t that he had been avoiding the other boy all day so much as it was that he was trying to gain some perspective which was hard to do in the presence of Harry Potter; golden, wonder boy and savior of the wizarding world. So yes, I guess one could say that he was dodging the other boy, but only a bit. Draco bit his lip, before he stood up contemplating whether or not to pretend, he wasn’t there, but the pull to be near Potter was stronger than the inner scrutiny of what that meant.
“Just know, I’m your friend just as much as Harry’s and if you need anything at school, well, you can talk to me.” She reached her hand out across the table, and instinctively without thinking Draco reached back. He felt Hermione squeeze his hand from across the table, and couldn’t help but exhale slowly and squeeze back, a gentle smile peeking through the corners of his lips, as he thanked her softly.
As Malfoy got closer, the dull ache began to dissipate, leaving the rest of his body and settling down in his stomach alone, giving him some relief. Harry found himself almost longing for Malfoy to hurry up and get closer to be rid of it altogether. Malfoy seemed to have the same idea as his steps got a little larger and instead of going over and getting into his own bed, he strode right over to Harry’s bed standing next to him, turning back to face the two adults who were following close behind.
Draco longed for nothing more than to stealthily steal away into Harry’s bed and press along the outline of his body until it would be a difficult task to tell which limb belonged to whom. He let out an unmeasured sigh, realizing much too late just how loud he’d allowed himself to be. He internally chastised himself, trying his best to remember that Harry’s best mate was sharing the same small space.
“Harry, it’s time to wake up,” he whispered again, trailing kisses from his ear, across his jaw, and down his neck.
Hermione let out a laugh, “honestly Harry, you’re not really doing a good job of trying to conceal any of this are you?” She finished with a wave of her hand towards the two of them, and emphasis on their proximity and quite possibly the fact that Harry was still latched on to the sleeve of his shirt.
After what felt like hours of the two boys getting lost in each other, Potter pulled back, eyes glazed over, lips red and so full, and cheeks flushed. Draco bit his bottom lip as he gazed down at the other boy, nervous, afraid to speak in fear that it would shatter everything.
Draco was sure Potter could read all the stages of emotion as they transpired on his face, not being very well versed in hiding from Potter these days.
, and groaned at the time; 2:30 am. In his groggy state his mind couldn’t fully connect with who might be waking him at that particular hour. He stumbled over to the door, cracked it open an inch to peak at who was waking him so early in the morning, and then pulled the door fully open and stepped aside to let Harry Potter, boy wonder enter into his room once again.
Draco didn’t really care; he knew he’d live in this reality forever if he could. He never wanted to leave these steps. But he knew, he knew deep down, way down in the deep recesses of his soul, that he and Harry had to face reality. These stairs couldn’t protect or shield them from anything they were bound to face in the next few days. He had to be brave.
Even though Draco knew all of this, even though he knew it would be difficult, he also knew that there was no one else. This was the same boy he’d loved with a vengeance since he was eleven, before he’d even known what love really was. This was the boy that invaded his dreams in all the best and worst ways. This was the boy who he’d been pining after however angrily for all these years too afraid to admit to himself what it really was that he was feeling, and who he was.
Harry’s eyes watched Draco swallow, following his adam’s apple as it bobbed still infatuated with the blush along the column of Draco’s neck. He idly wondered how far down the flush went, Draco was so beautifully pale after all.
Of course, Draco had agonized over it in every spare moment he’d had from then on. In truth, he had no real idea how the other boy felt about him in return. Sure, Harry was affectionate, he wasn’t shy about touching Draco innocently, or brazenly. He also wasn’t shy about opening up to Draco, not anymore, but what did it mean? It was driving Draco absolutely mad, and to top it all off Harry’s birthday was tomorrow.
“Yeah?” Draco spoke, he wasn’t confident he could really say anything else quite as steadily. “Yeah.” Harry spoke, and gazed at him eyes filled with the same emotions that filled Draco’s. “I don’t want to have the same ending as that story, I don’t want you to leave Draco.”
Nevertheless, that had been all day and now after dinner was done and Mrs. Weasley had shucked everyone off to finish their packing for school the following day, Harry had felt desperate for Draco – who was nowhere to be found.
It suddenly felt too much to bear. He loved Harry; he did but he was asking for so much. How could he turn his back on his mother and father? He knew that he was a disappointment to his father thus far, and that this would disappoint him even further, especially the part where he was gay and in love with Harry Potter, sworn enemy of the Dark Lord. But what about his mother? Surely, he couldn’t just abandon her.
“I just wanted to thank you Mr. Weasley, I know it couldn’t have been easy initially accepting me into your home, but I’m grateful that you did. I’m grateful to you both, very much, and – well, I just wanted you to know.” Draco extended his hand out to Mr. Weasley and looked up to be met with a smile. Mr. Weasley shook his hand firmly, “It was no trouble at all my boy, do take care of our Harry this year. I expect we’ll see you at Christmas.”
“Okay, what is it?” Harry retorted sitting up reaching for the blonde, only a slight waver of hesitation lining his voice.
“Hey,” Harry said, pulling Draco’s gaze back up to drown in green, “we’ll manage,” he finished with a soft smile and fingers trailing down his pale cheek.
“We’re just discussing the very extensive book list for this terms classes,” Hermione spoke matter of factly, and Draco had never been more grateful to her in that moment; lying to Harry was not something he felt he’d be proficient in…anymore at least.
They finally leave Privet Drive which is bitter sweet for me, and also means were getting closer to the end!...I'm thinking this fic will end with roughly 25 chapters, but don't hold me to it!
Draco was savoring every moment of pure bliss in the arms of the brunette. He held Harry in his limbs as if his life depended on it, raking a hand up through his dark messy sleep ridden hair and cradling his head, keeping him in place buried in the crook of his neck.
“Oh Harry, let me look at you.” Draco watched, an amused smile in place as Mrs. Weasley held Harry out at arm’s length, assessing his wellbeing.
Desperately Harry turned to Nearly Headless Nick in the hopes that maybe Sirius wasn’t altogether gone, maybe he would still be able to turn to his Godfather even if he wasn’t flesh and blood. Alas, the Gryffindor ghost trounced over his last ounce of hope that maybe all wasn’t lost. The round of defeat delivered by the ghost restarted his mourning process, and he felt that most days he was walking through the castle in a haze. He was more grateful than ever for Ron and Hermione; without them he didn’t think he’d even make it to classes at all. After they’d gotten out of the hospital wing it had been their mission to get him through the remainder of the term and honestly, he was appreciative.  He felt his feelings shift from the start of the term where he was uncontrollably angry at his two best friends for shutting him out when he felt that he needed them most. But looking back on it all now it felt petty and childish, how had he let himself be overcome with feelings of jealousy and anger at the two people who seemed to always support him no matter what it cost them.
Harry began to feel the traces of panic outline him when he couldn’t get Draco to meet his eyes. The other boy came and perched himself of the edge of the sofa, thankfully, nearest Harry and finally looked up at him. His eyes appeared sad, and so the traces of panic got bolder and Harry knew he couldn’t keep it hidden from his face. Mercifully, Draco graced him with a signature soft half-lipped smile and slid down between the arm of the sofa and Harry into his normal spot, the spot Harry had left open the last four nights. Draco’s blonde hair slid into his eyes as he peered down into his lap, clutching what Harry now realized was a book. Draco peered back up at Harry timorously, sliding the book that was in his lap into Harry’s hands. Harry looked up at him curiously, a question in his gaze. Draco opened his mouth as if to answer Harry’s unspoken question but abruptly closed it again.
Draco had been caught locking eyes with Potter, more frequently as of late. He also found that he caught himself seeking Potter out more often than he cared to admit. Which meant spending a lot of time tucked away in his corner of the common room. He couldn’t fully understand what he had done to earn the lazy smile of boy wonder, it made him feel overwhelmed, but in a way that had him craving the interaction habitually. Of course, it typically ended with Potter’s reddened cheeks and bright eyes casting downwards and Draco feeling so inundated with foreign feelings that he had to retreat back up to his room out of breath.
For a moment she looked up at him her face pleasantly shaken, though she quickly recovered. “That would be lovely dear, I’ll lead the way,” and so she marched him into the kitchen.
Quiet filled the space between them for a few moments, Draco willing Potter to speak with his entire being, not knowing what to say himself.
“Actually, when I asked him if I should wait to speak with him, he said I should reach out to you for advice on how best to handle the situation.”
Hermione let out a sigh, “I told Harry that’s what he’d be hung up on, but who else knows besides me?”
They eyed each other for a moment, Draco weighing the advice in his mind before Harry used the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck for leverage to tilt his head back leaving his mouth agape for a scorching kiss. He let his eyes flutter closed as Harry ravished his lips, and he was powerless against his ministrations. Draco let an arm snake up the back of Harry’s shirt, and the other tangle in his messy locks and pulled him in as close as their bodies would allow.
“Strange, I know,” he continued, “but there’s just something there, it’s kind of nice…” he trailed off again, cheeks reddening. “He was someone who was also caught up in family dynamics he couldn’t wield himself to, and he wanted an out, an escape, and he found it in the friendship he had with my dad.” Potter quickly cleared his throat ending that particular part of their conversation, not allowing Draco to speak on his commentary about his resemblance to his Godfather, and looked away before speaking again, but this time directed at the sheets of their cot. “What about you then, the dreams, I mean?”
“The explanation of why, is not one I feel I can give Harry, however, the how is simple. A magical bond has been cast on you and young Mr. Malfoy. Essentially, the two of you will find that you are unable to be more than a few feet apart from one another without suffering a great amount of physical and sometimes even mental pain. As all magical bonds are extremely strong and typically incredibly intricate, we have found that at this time we are unable to sever it. In due course, I am positive that the bond will sever itself when the timing is right, as this has been my experience with these matters.” Dumbledore spoke plainly, and calmly as if he were giving his annual start of term speech, and not as if he were explaining to Harry that he was now bound until further notice to his arch enemy.
“Ready boys?” Without waiting for a response Lupin began shrinking their school trunks, “best to just let Hedwig out Harry, so I can get her cage.”
Harry lurched forward as his eyes laid on Draco’s hunched form. Without a thought he pulled from Hermione intent on reaching Draco. And just like that it was as if the blonde could sense his presence, he looked up eyes filled with relief and Harry watched Draco straighten and meet him halfway in a solid embrace, and his senses were filled with nothing but
Draco was once again pulled from his inner agony, but this time it was the soft voice of Mrs. Weasley which startled him a great deal.
“Yeah?” Harry watched as Malfoy’s lips inched up into an earnest half-smile and quirked his head in interest, as if Harry’s birthday was particularly interesting.
“Well Harry, is this any way to greet someone you’ve not seen in quite some time?” Remus stated in the laid-back tone, typical of him.
Harry knew he was done for officially one evening a few weeks after their Halloween conversation. They were all in their usual spots when Harry came down from the dormitories; Hermione curled up in the arm chair nearest the fire with Ron on the ground propped up with his back against her chair, and Malfoy curled up into the corner of the sofa sincerely immersed in a book Harry hadn’t seen him with before. Harry stopped abruptly in his decent when his eyes reached Malfoy, bottom lip pulled between his teeth, brow scrunched up in concentration, cheeks flushed, and hair a tousled mess.
While it was incredibly amusing to watch Granger get lost in her own tangent, he felt his heart soften just a bit at the sight. He was hit with the notion that it must be incredibly hard for Hermione to be caught between Harry and Ron all the time. Draco could tell she loved Harry immensely, the two of them seemed to understand each other and care for one another deeply. It was a level of friendship that Draco hadn’t ever experienced. On the other hand, it was also incredibly clear that whether she was willing to admit it to herself, out loud, or to just anyone she was in love with Ron for reasons Draco was sure he’d never comprehend. Either way, it put her in a tough spot in times like these where the two boys were at odds. Draco felt overwhelmed with the desire to help, to ease this burden for her somehow, it was the least he could do after all.
Harry could feel Ron give an eyeroll from beside him, “Harry can’t your bond like sense him or something? Shouldn’t you know where he is?”
Draco laid there silently evaluating the other boy, taking in his dark brown hair, and honey colored skin a stark contrast to the white sheets that surrounded him. Draco noticed that no one had bothered to remove Potter’s glasses from his face after he’d fallen asleep. He zoned in on the glasses, surely it must be uncomfortable for the other boy, Draco didn’t wear glasses, but he felt sure that it would be unpleasant if Potter were to roll over and crush them against his face. Draco reasoned that if they were to be living in close quarters all summer would it not be better to at least begin on the right foot, and then there was at least the rationale that Potter wouldn’t even know it was Draco who removed the glasses for him.
“I’m sure where we’re going will be perfectly lovely,” he continued with a raise of his eyebrow, “but I can’t help but admit I’m feeling a little uneasy about it.”
Potter was making it very difficult to focus on the new escape he had chosen for himself, the amount of physical contact was overwhelming him to the point of no return. Literally, when Draco thought he could take no more, Potter began tracing circles on Draco’s right ankle. The ankle that was still resting in Potter’s lap, where Potter himself had placed it. Draco was finding it hard not to just gape, open mouthed and wide eyed at the boy across from him. Draco tried to close his eyes and regroup, he really wanted to focus on his new book, the escape he had chosen specifically to help himself make sense of the Potter feelings that seemed to do nothing but engulf and drown him, especially now.
Harry began to realize that during his moment of inner contemplation he hadn’t even been pretending to read properly. He hadn’t even turned a page since he sat down, he had simply opened the novel and stared off into the page in a complete daze. He was afraid to look up at Malfoy, afraid that he might be looking over at him in confusion and even more afraid that he hadn’t looked over at all. Although, when he thought about that he reflected on the fact that Malfoy hadn’t pulled his knees back up to his chest in an outraged huff or told him off in any way. In fact, Malfoy had left his feet right where Harry had placed them and had hardly moved an inch.
He found his eyes drawn to Granger, he noticed she seemed intently immersed in something. Draco followed her sightline across the table to where Ron was sat, laughing at something one of the twins had said. Second glance back at the curly haired brunette and he knew what he was looking at, he saw it every day reflected back at him in the mirror.
Draco’s mind was immersed in confusion over what Potter meant, what was he saying, how did he feel, what now?
“Yeah well it’s either that or you sleep under the bed, there’s no room on the floor, and my lovely aunt and uncle would rather die than have a wizard in their guest room or on their couch.” Potter trailed off a little before continuing more softly, “and I don’t think sleeping in separate rooms would be comfortable,” Potter finished the statement without meeting Draco’s eyes.
The night of the Halloween feast Granger and Weasley made plans to spend some time alone, leaving Potter on his own with Draco. The two boys decided to spend the evening after the feast reading up in the common room in front of the fire. Draco had already situated himself into his new nook in the corner of the overstuffed sofa and was just beginning to become lost in the book wedged in his lap when Potter flopped down directly next to him. With a sigh Potter propped his socked feet up on the table in front of him and pulled some of Draco’s blanket over onto his own lap and began to read “Stardust,” Draco’s latest prescribed escape.
Before Harry or anyone else could process what was happening, a very frantic Hermione Granger appeared from around the corner.
Draco sat up slowly, reaching for the brunette and pulling him close, he nuzzled in and began mouthing slowly at Harry’s neck making his eyes flutter closed.
“Yeah, yeah just tired is all.” He met Ron’s eyes with a smile, knowing full well he was absolutely avoiding a conversation that involved any more substance than the one he was supposed to be currently engaged in. Which is why he was doing his best to avoid catching Hermione’s eye, though she was growing more and more obvious in her attempts, and therefore, growing harder to avoid.
I think there will probably just be 2 more chapters left, maybe 3! So at the very least we're nearing the end!
“I guess the two of you have a point then,” she laughed. “I suppose with Ronald the best approach is to just be direct. He’s not great at trying to put pieces together so it’s best to just be straight forward…honestly Draco, I don’t think you need to be quite so nervous. It’s clear Harry is smitten, and Ronald loves Harry and wants him to be happy. He will come around I’m sure of it.”
“No, I think he’s definitely cross with Harry, and honestly, probably even more cross with me. I’m sure I’m the one he blames for the entire thing, at least that’s what was made clear to me before he stormed out this morning.”
Harry let out a laugh, and let his head fall back down between his shoulders again. Harry realized in that moment that he was face to face with Draco’s very hard cock. A very telling wet spot had formed on the front of the blonde’s pants, and without thinking Harry leaned down to suck wanting nothing more than to know how Draco tasted.
When they were lurched back into reality Draco felt shaken from much more than just the apparation. Standing in front of ‘The Burrow’ as everyone seemed to call it, Draco felt his stomach begin to lurch.
Also I wanted to say directly to Skylar Johnson....I don't want you to think I completely nicked your suggestion at Hermione admitting something back to Harry in her letter, I just decided to save her confession for a little later down the line! I hope you understand!!
Posting as definitely given me the inspiration that I needed to keep writing and figure out where I wanted our boys to go! Thanks everyone for all the encouragement and feedback, couldn't have done it without you! <3
Draco let out a big sigh that ended on a curt laugh and pulled back to look at Harry before responding.
Let me know what you think, I'm almost 100% sure there will only be 1 MAYBE 2 more chapters left! <3
Draco turned his neck so he could look at Harry and watched as he ran a hand over his face hastily as Draco had done a billion times that morning.
That was all it took, in a rush and haze of dark hair and bright green eyes Harry was clasped to him. Draco instantly wrapped one arm around Harry clenched like a snake up and around his back, while his other hand stroked through the dark locks tangling himself there as he pulled the other boy’s head back to desperately meet his lips. He couldn’t stop the soft and needy groan that escaped his lips, all fear of Harry not wanting him long forgotten. The only coherent thoughts he truly had were of lips, and teeth, and
Draco stayed still, not wanting to alter Potter’s decision to open up to him about the terrible things that swallowed him up at night. He knew that it meant something that the brunette had chosen to speak instead of staying silent and leaving the unease between them.
Harry pulled back a little, and eyed Draco for a moment before answering. And each moment felt like fucking torture, it was a feat trying to keep his own face impassive.
Draco knows that something has shifted between the two of them, he can feel it, and he begins to let his heart dare to dream a little if only for just a continued friendship with Potter. He knows that he could never let his heart hope for anything further, Potter was straight after all, and friendship was more than enough, and truly all his eleven-year-old self ever wanted anyways. Although, his eleven-year-old self didn’t know he was gay at the time, he ruminated to himself only slightly sarcastically.
At this Ron rolled his eyes, and decided it was now safe to enter the conversation, “Oi Harry, it means you and Malfoy can’t be apart from each other. You’re stuck with the prat all summer mate,” he finished with a sheepish look around as he received another pointed look from Hermione. “What? Someone had to be straight up with him, didn’t they? It would have taken you lot ten years to get on with it,” he finished with a roll of his eyes avoiding eye contact with Hermione this time.
Draco thought back to when he had awoken an hour ago, opening his eyes into the dark gaze of his potions' professor. Before he could even speak in an effort to convey his confusion, professor Snape had hushed him, “later,” he hissed out with an assertive nod in the direction of Potter bracketed in by Weasley and Granger. When he had turned back to face Severus again, he realized he had gone, only to return some twenty minutes later with the headmaster in tow. “With Draco awake, I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before Potter follows suit,” he heard the dark-haired man murmur to professor Dumbledore.
Harry had acquired a look of vast confusion. “Hold on,” he stated anxiously. “What do you mean I’ve been bonded to Malfoy, what does that even mean?” It seemed that the headmaster had taken Hermione’s pointed look to heart and spoke up first this time, “unfortunately, Harry it means exactly as it sounds, you are bonded to Draco.”
“Oh I want you to, merlin Draco, I want you to.” He replied, cupping the blonde’s cheeks for good measure.
“You tell me Malfoy,” I replied pressing my cheek to the soft pink skin of Draco’s and letting out an unabashed sigh.
“Yes, Harry obviously it’s the safest place for him, and of course the Weasley’s are nothing but the picture of kindness so it makes sense that they would extend the invitation, but this early? Surely, The Order knows something that they’ve failed to share with us,” Granger replied though still clearly lost in her own world of thought.
“You’ll always be my insufferable Gryffindor Potter,” Draco stated softly knowing full well that his tone was giving him away completely.
Potter had moved both hands to Draco’s face and was holding him, cradling his face between his palms as if his life depended on it, kissing him as if he were air and he need Draco’s lips purely for survival. Draco dragged his hands down Potter’s body, pulling him into his own body, craving his touch, but soon discovering it was more useful to push the brunette back, towards the wall of their tunnel, pressing him into it, tugging his bottom lip with his teeth as his back hit the wall.
It felt like years they stayed put, eyes locked; Draco from his position cross-legged on the bed, and Harry profile towards Draco hand still poised on the knob of the door. The room was so miniscule that there was hardly any space between them, though to Draco it felt like a chasm, and he so desperately wanted to reach out, but he didn’t know if that’s what Harry wanted.
Harry snapped his face back to stare at Malfoy fixedly, but was met with the same earnest gray eyes that had been gracing the blonde’s face since they stepped off the Hogwarts’s express. Harry let out a soft, audible sigh, “you get them to,” Harry spoke with a rasp in his voice that seemed to convey the frustrated conversation he’d been having with himself internally.
Draco felt his smile falter, and his stomach cringe as Mrs. Weasley set her sights on him, her smile only wavering a moment before it perked right back up.
“Shhh, you have to be quiet,” he said with a little laugh as his fingers deftly unbuttoned Draco’s jeans earning him a whimper.
Draco immediately let go, and let himself get lost in Harry, and making the other boy feel good. In one swift motion he pulled off the other boy’s pajama bottoms and pants leaving him bare, and was met with Harry’s rigidly hard cock, already dripping pre-come.
Now that Draco had Harry, he knew that for him there was no going back. He knew that he would spend the next thousand years fighting for Harry or die trying.
Draco looked over at him, Potters confession had made him feel a little more brave than before, his revelation about his Godfather and their similarities made Draco feel as if he was seen by him, really seen,  and speaking on impulse, high on the reality that Potter had trusted him first, he spoke.
However, when Draco finally made it down to the Great Hall for breakfast Harry’s disheveled hair and bright eyes were nowhere to be found. He tried to resolve himself with the thought that at least he would see him that afternoon in charms class and undertook the rest of his day counting down until then. Although, when Flitwick began the lesson that afternoon Draco looked around the realization that Harry was not there making his stomach flip with anxiety. Surely, Harry wasn’t avoiding him. Even when Draco was immersed in the land of Monet’s beam, and morning swims he had made a point to not avoid Harry. Sure, part of that was due to his lack of restraint and desire to always be near Harry, okay all of it was due to that.
I think after this chapter there will only be one more, maybe two just depending on how it ends up laying out! The point, is that we are definitely at an end!
Now however, something seemed to bubble under their touch. A building electricity that drew goose bumps along their flesh in an alarming yet, thrilling way.
Before Draco could process, or react, or even take a breath really, Harry was hoisting him up to eye level once more.
Hedwig let out a little chirp of exasperation and shook her extended leg as if to give a little reminder that she was still waiting on him. “Shhh, don’t want to wake him up do you,” Harry whispered with a nod of his head in Draco’s direction.
Dudley was talking to Potter, what he was saying Draco didn’t know, he was focused solely on the imbecile holding him hostage. Dudley didn’t even pay Draco any mind until he was directly behind the pair, eyes darting up to focus in on Draco’s wand extended out in front of him.
“And I saw how you were with Mrs. Weasley, and everyone else here, I know that couldn’t have been easy for you. I can’t imagine this is what it’s like for you when you go home to your family during the summer holidays…Harry has made it clear to me several times that this change wasn’t just because of him, or how you felt. And observing you now, I know he’s right. It’s always been there, and you don’t have to read me your list I can’t even imagine what it must have been like for you growing up the way you have. I won’t try that’s not my place, but I wanted you to know that I see you. I understand to a certain point, and I accept your apology.”
Harry could tell that Draco was uncertain, and that it had taken a lot for him to simply come down here and place this book in his hands. He peered down at it, “Call Me by Your Name” he read aloud, looking back up at Draco the same question still in his eyes. Draco looked at him a moment longer before weaving his hands through Harry’s and stating earnestly, “just read it Harry.” With that, Draco pulled one of Harry’s hands to his lips, kissed his palm, then retreated up the stairs back to his dorm leaving Harry alone with the latest Draco escape, and the understanding that he would soon be privy to where Draco had spent the last four days and three nights.
Harry let out a laugh, squeezing Draco’s arms gently. “The giant ‘H’ didn’t give it away as mine then?”
Harry thought for a moment longer as if willing himself to get out of bed and lengthen the mile-long distance that already stretched between the two of them. With as much quiet nerve as he could muster Harry slid from bed, yanked on the first pair of trousers he could find tossed a t-shirt he found lying on the ground over his messy head, grabbed a notebook and quill from his bag, and let Hedwig free from her cage and watched only for a moment as she beelined for the window thankful she did so quietly.
Draco tries to hide the slight leap in his chest, he doesn’t know why he feels so thrilled at the idea of choosing another book for Potter from his collection, but he suspects it has something to do with the fact that Draco shared a part of himself with another person, and they didn’t immediately reject him. It could also be the fact that their game of glances just accelerated to the next level, but Draco wasn’t willing to openly admit to himself just what that meant to him yet.
As the two boys sat in quiet contemplation during the bus ride back to Little Whinging from the shops, Draco couldn’t help but let his small Harry reserved, half-smile remain. Draco looked down at the small stack of books seated in his lap, remembering how the brunette had watched him scour the bookshelves of the shop pretending to scowl in disinterest as he began pulling books out to inspect. Though Harry walked out of the shop empty handed, he could tell the other boy had still enjoyed himself, and they both admitted on the walk back to the bus after lunch that it had been a much-needed change of pace from the past week of silent brooding.
“Why be friends with me, Potter?” Malfoy spoke in a low, soft declaration, glancing up at Harry with wide eyes.
He now had the attention of both Potter and Weasley he mused silently, just barely refraining from letting out an anxious laugh at the situation. Never in a million years did he think he’d be sitting here, thigh pressed against golden boy while his Gryffindor gang worried about him. Not that he was complaining, but he wasn’t sure it would never feel like his normal. He sheepishly shrugged, thinking of how best to answer Granger’s question.
The prattish, blonde-haired boy was laying on his back in the bed directly next to Harry, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling. Harry thought briefly how that seemed to be an effective way to avoid eye contact, but before he could attempt to slink down and immerse himself in the ceiling tiles, he heard Dumbledore clear his throat drawing Harry’s eyes back to the headmaster.
“Well, it’s what you get for leaving your clothes strewn about the house. Sometimes your clothes mix with mine, and I get them mixed up.”
When the two boys had finally come up for air, that was when Harry had been hit full force with the realization of his feelings for the blonde git. All those feelings he had shoved deeper, willing himself to save for another day, another time, but not willing to face head on in the moment had come breaking to the surface like they’d been drowning and needed to suck in as much air as possible.
Quickly putting pieces together in his mind, Draco reasoned with himself that if he took the biggest leap of faith there was, if he dared open up his heart to horrible rejection, there was still time to rectify the situation before they returned to school. And who would Potter possibly tell? He would probably be too embarrassed, especially with the fact that it was Draco, and wouldn’t ever tell a soul that, that… Draco’s train of thought was jilted as he felt the softness of Potter’s lips ghost over the skin of his neck and Draco involuntarily let out a soft whimper of a sound and responded without a second thought.
Harry awoke to the distant sound of murmured voices. His head suffered from a dull throb and he struggled to pry his eyes open, feeling as though he’d been asleep for ten years. With some effort his eye lids complied with his request, and blinked into focus, as he looked around his eyes were met with too many things for his mind to fully comprehend. At the foot of his bed Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape were in a hushed and intense disagreement it seemed. While beside him on either side Hermione and Ron were in a hushed disagreement of their own. Harry looked from Hermione to Ron, and then back to Hermione, “Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, “Oh, we thought you were still sleeping,” her eyes darted back to Ron and she hushed out through gritted teeth, “See, I told you Ronald, I told you that you were being too loud.” The ginger haired boy rolled his eyes, “honestly, Hermione, with the way those two are carrying on and you blame me for waking Harry,” he stated with a side glance and gesture towards the two professors arguing at the foot of Harry’s bed. “What are they going at it about?” Harry asked with a glance between his two best mates.
Draco doesn’t really sleep that night, but when he wakes up the next morning it’s with a new vigor. So what if Potter doesn’t like his book, what does it matter to Draco? Draco vowed to be more silent this year, not so that he wouldn’t be heard but so that he could listen more. If potter didn’t like his chosen escape, perhaps he would consider giving him another chance to try again. Honestly, Draco didn’t know what had come over him. The polite indifference that turned into a chess match of glances was one thing but seeking Potter’s approval on something Draco valued most in his life right now was really setting him on edge. Which is why when Potter plopped himself down next to Draco at breakfast that morning, he was beginning to think he would lose his mind.
Realization dawned on Draco then, his face alight with it, “you mean about touching,” he spoke softly, timidly putting the words into the space between them. Potter nodded, urging Draco on.
Draco also knew about Sirius Black, of course he did, he was a relative of his mother’s family, and disowned or not, it was his duty as a well-bred Malfoy to know all the ancestors that made up his ancestral line. Draco also knew how he died; he knew who killed him. Draco had heard his Aunt Bellatrix boast the news to the Dark Lord when the death eaters had been summoned shortly after the events at the ministry has transpired. His aunt had been one of the few to receive praise from the Dark Lord instead of the torture he had watched his father endure over Voldemort’s disappointment.
Snape gave Draco a long look, a look Harry couldn’t quite interpret before completely ignoring Harry altogether and following Dumbledore out of the room.
“No one is going to blame you for this. Least of all Ron, and if he does blame you in some way then he’s even more daft than I originally thought. Let me handle this, I’ll talk to Ron okay?”
Harry thought to himself that Malfoy looked so timidly ardent in his statement making him feel an overwhelming fondness for the other boy in that moment.
Draco’s mind was a cloudy haze, filled with nothing except dark hair and green eyes, and Harry, just Harry. He knew that he was giving everything he had to the other boy, pouring all the confusion and desire he felt towards him into their kiss. Draco knew he was allowing himself to be in the moment with Harry fully, and to the extent where he couldn’t seem to control the murmuring, whimpering sounds he was allowing to escape his lips as wonder boy kissed him with abandon. Draco felt that it was terrifying and enamoring all at once, and he still didn’t know what it all meant just that he didn’t want it to end.
All the blonde could do was nod frantically, and Harry took note that Draco’s usual sarcastic remarks seemed nowhere to be found, how effective.
Draco blinked his eyes open, giving Harry one last longing look before they both lost their resolve. Pale soft skin met bronze warmth and both boys let out an audible moan and met each other in a scorching open-mouthed kiss; all tongues and teeth.
Harry watched Draco’s eyes widen in surprise, “no you didn’t, let me see,” and Draco was once again reaching for Harry’s flies with resolve.
Harry continued on, speaking at the ceiling, “I’ve spent most of our summer forcing everything I’ve felt about the future, Voldemort, all the unknown, and you back into the furthest darkest hole in my mind to save for another day.”
Of course, she would approve of his identity crisis, that was never something he was worried about. But if he was being honest with himself, he knew that Draco had probably tormented Hermione the worst out of the three of them over the years. He and Draco had spoken about it at length, and Draco hadn’t disputed the charges against him. He knew that making amends was something Draco was keen to do, but it wouldn’t be easy. Not for him, and not for the people he needed to confront. Although, he knew out of everyone Hemione would be the most receptive, she was easily forgiving one of the things about her that made her so easy to love.
Harry and Draco sat there leaning forward, hands clasped in their solid handshake, staring at one another for a few more moments before slowly slacking their grip and letting go. Before he could even think about it Draco spoke, “well if that’s what a handshake feels like I can hardly imagine what spooning you in that infinitesimal cot will be like,” finishing with a breath. After the words left his mouth, he felt mortified, what the hell was wrong with him, he’d only just turned over a new leaf with boy wonder and he was already mucking it up. Before he could spend too much time dwelling on his mis-step he heard Harry let out a deep and almost guttural laugh.
It was in these moments Draco battled with himself about the fact that everything and nothing seemed to be different between the two of them. They touched more, both innocently and deviously, but never spoke about it. The most confusing part about it all was that while they never spoke about what was happening between them, they seemed to divulge more and more of their inner selves, things Draco was willing to bet that Harry had never spoken aloud, not even to himself. Whether it was the bond, their overwhelming hormones, their complete lack of self-control, their undeniable fondness for one another, or an alarming combination of all of the above Draco couldn’t be sure.
Before Draco could calculate his next actions, Harry was tugging on his wrist doing his best to pull him up and into his bed.
“You have been the happiest part of my summer, and I was shocked to say the least. You have surprised me in all the best ways, and I didn’t know Draco. I didn’t know what my feelings for you meant about me.”
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“You’ll have to help me with the muggle money, Potter,” Draco said with the grin still intact. And Harry couldn’t help but think that the blonde looked sort of nice when he wasn’t being such a posh git, and then quickly shoved the thought back down into the deep recesses of his mind where he shoved all his thoughts about their mornings. One day he knew he’d be forced to face them, but that moment could wait.
It wasn’t as if Draco was used to a warm welcome home either, though. His mother would often greet him with a hug at the station, and that was where the affection died. Upon their apparation home his father would begin berating him about all the unsuitable things he had done that year at school, with a full catalogue of criticism. Draco grew up in a place where it was better to be seen, only when summoned mind you, and not heard. He mused that this unspoken rule had become even more strict since Voldemort had taken up residence, though, Draco was more than happy to oblige.
He could feel emerald eyes on him, but kept his eyes closed firmly not wanting the other boy to know he was awake, not ready to face him yet. Draco waited until he heard the soft click of the door closing before allowing himself to fully open his eyes and blink out the very little sleep, he’d gotten that night.
That was probably what had Draco twisted up so much, he knew his biggest fear was going back to pretending he hated Harry. He was absolutely certain he’d be awful at it now. Honestly, it was hard to remember a time where he’d never touched Harry, never felt how warm his skin was, how assured his lips were, or certain his touch. How could he go back? He knew if he was forced to pretend the summer hadn’t existed, he’d be more likely to spend the days seeking out starkly dark hair, and sharp green eyes. His rude looks wouldn’t be able to hide or suppress the deep longing he was bound to feel with or without the bond still intact.
Dinner at The Burrow was the most entertaining experience of Draco’s life thus far. Of course, he wasn’t counting anything he’d experienced with Harry because those moments were beyond a source of entertainment; they were everything.
“Ron, come on. It’s not like that, you know how ‘Mione is, she knew practically before I’d even told her.”
Draco let out a little groan, and finally looked up to meet Harry’s gaze. “I, - I” he stuttered, closing his mouth a look of pure exasperation donning his features. That wouldn’t do, Harry thought to himself.
Both boys held the other’s gaze almost assessing each other before daring to speak, both being so very careful with their next chosen words, neither having the audacity to break the silence first, and neither risking the thought that the other may very well have the same fears and trepidations that they had themselves.
Never afraid of a challenge, but more importantly, never willing to pass up one of the opportunities to be near the other boy in these small ways, Draco extended his hand out to Potter, as he had done on their first night holed up in Potter’s room, as he had done in the hospital wing at Hogwarts just one month ago, and as he had done that day in Madam Malkins shop all those years ago.
Harry’s half-smile made it impossible to feel exasperated by the strange and intricate dynamic he shared with Weasley and Granger.
Malfoy mirrored Potter’s sigh from a few moments ago, running his own hand through his hair in a quiet frustration. “Yes, Potter, what an astute observation,” Malfoy spoke with a mild sneer from underneath the hand scrunching up his face without looking at Harry.
Since the war and his return to Hogwarts, he found that he liked to spend his spare moments watching Potter. Well, not so much
As they entered the train, they met up with Weasley and Granger who had already settled into one of the familiar compartments. As Draco eased in, next to Harry his mind began to wander once again this time fixating on what the Weasley’s had said.
Malfoy’s face donned a twisted-up look of misery as the rest poured out of him, “there were a few times where I was forced to take part in the torture, the first time I tried to resist and my own father was made to cruccio me, and so I learned to keep my head down and hope to avoid being chosen, but ultimately I had to do awful things to people, people I didn’t even know just to amuse him. Even more so because he knew I took no pleasure from it; I loathed every second of my participation.”
“Yeah…they got into a bit this morning, and Ron left in a huff upset he hadn’t been the first to know…”
There is definitely some strong bigoted, vulgar, harsh homophobic language in this chapter! Obviously, not from either Harry or Draco but I wanted to warn you all the same!
“Go on, have a read,” Harry replied, gracing the other boy with a chaste kiss and extended the letter out to him.
It didn’t much matter anymore, Draco mused to himself the reality was that he knew Granger was still writing letters to Harry with theories and possible remedies and experiments to try in reference to their bond. He also knew that by summers end the bond would dissipate itself and all would be normal once more, or he knew his godfather had relayed that much. He began to feel unbearably sick to his stomach at the thought, he was terrified of the notion that once the bond had diminished and they had returned to Hogwarts Harry would return to his normal routine of despising him.
“I dream about Sirius,” Harry spoke faintly looking up and locking eyes with Malfoy’s intently and with purpose.
Harry watched astounded as Draco turned his gaze solely on Vernon. “If you thought my right-hook was bad trust me it’s nothing compared to what I can do with my wand,” he set Harry’s uncle with a stern glare.
“Look, Potter, I, I don’t really know what to say. I mean, ughhh,” Draco let out a frustrated groan at himself and the situation, hadn’t he vowed silence, why had he thought talking might be okay? “I guess since we're here, and neither of us has a say in the matter the least we can do is try to be civil and not kill each other, yeah?”
The next morning Draco’d been lulled awake by the distant sounds of morning at The Burrow. In the two mornings he’d spent at the Weasley’s so far, he’d learned that hardly any moment was quiet, the only time of peace was at night when every Weasley and guest was tucked sweetly into their bed. Otherwise the house was always filled with various chaotic sounds.
“They pulled me aside because it was Severus who bonded us together Harry.” He searched Harry’s face for any sign of emotion, but the brunette let on only that he was intently listening, so he continued. “Severus bonded us because he was fearful for me. He knew that Voldemort intended me to take the dark mark when I returned home this summer, and he knew I wasn’t ready. He did it to protect me.”
“I…what’s going to happen, when we’re back at school?” Draco breathed it out in a huff, a whisper soft enough to make Draco question if he even spoke it aloud.
Instead he rationalized that Draco was entitled to borrow his clothes whenever he wanted as he was the one who was often tossing them in the wash. Why he did it, Harry might never know. Although, Draco’s own wardrobe consisted of more stiff and proper clothing. Nothing comfortable like the t-shirts and joggers Draco often stole from him. Harry also rationalized that when Draco did his wash for him his clothes often came back smelling like him which was just another happy little bonus to having clean clothes and watching Draco flounce about their flat in one of Harry’s hoodies.
“Honestly, Harry I think you’re the only one that pays him any mind at all,” Hermione said with a knowing look. Harry’d been less keen to bring it up after that. Not wanting to draw attention to his old habit however accepting of himself he’d become.
Draco was intently listening, hoping to gauge Weasley’s reaction for his own conversation with the git, but he was also basking in the reality that Harry was still latched on to his hand. He hadn’t tossed it aside and tried to hide it or shove it off on the bond, he was there facing it all head on; the true fucking Gryffindor he was. The whole idea of it made Draco have to avidly hold back a smile, lest he be caught out.
to taper his quelling nerves on how they were going to be facing Hogwarts the day after tomorrow. Hand in hand, or trekking along making up the rules as they go, as they’d always done?
“Well, yeah…I guess everyone knows now.” Harry said exhaling a breath and running his free hand over his face in admission. It wasn’t as if he’d been actively trying to hide it anyways. He was mad for Malfoy, and he was pretty sure everyone had been reading it across his dopey face since they’d gotten there.
Severus’s mind continued to shift from Albus, to Potter, and then back to Draco who was incessantly the primary anxiety that plagued him on a daily basis. The boy was someone he saw himself in, unlike Potter who was wholly like his own father; arrogant, assertive. Severus knew how Draco portrayed himself, not unlike himself he put out to the world a defense to keep everyone shut out, to only allow people to see what he wanted them to. He knew that Draco’s time was up, he was about to take the dark mark, and become a servant to the Dark Lord. He knew Draco wasn’t ready, he would never fully be ready for what Voldemort, his family, and his name asked of him. And he wasn’t so sure he could stand idly by and let the boy shatter his world, and possibly die in the process.
Draco was woken in the middle of the night with a jolt; someone was tapping on his door. Draco reached over to his night stand and felt around for his wand, cast a quick
It was all fine. Harry had been content to watch Draco nick his shirts, hoodies, joggers, even a few pairs of his socks only to find them folded neatly in his dresser a few days later. Harry always felt a little thrill wearing something Draco had been wearing just a few days before, even though he knew the other boy had washed it before returning it. There was just something about it that gave Harry a small moment of pleasure at the thought of Draco having worn it.
Before he really knew what was happening Harry was inviting Malfoy to sit with him, and Hermione and Ron at meals. And before he could even stop himself to think about how stupid it was to invite him, Malfoy accepted. Harry was beginning to realize that maybe he wasn’t the only one addicted to their conversations and their time together. Maybe Malfoy was just as amiable as Harry was to this newfound friendship.
Harry immediately thought to himself. He had to full on remind himself to continue walking, but not wanting to do anything to pull Malfoy from the escape he was clearly absorbed in.
He knew deep down that Snape’s efforts had not been meaningless, and he would be a stupid git to believe that Severus had only been trying to buy Draco more time. He knew his time was up at the end of this summer, and his options were clear; take the dark mark or join Potter and his army of Gryffindor’s.
Draco had learned that he was not very apt in the kitchen, something Harry had assured him was in fact true during their time at the Dursley’s. However, Mrs. Weasley didn’t seem to mind in the least. She was very patient with him as she instructed him how to chop up vegetables for the salad, as she chatted away to him about anything and everything.
Harry ran his fingers down the soft contours of Draco’s cheek resting his palm against his chest. Draco knew there was no way to hide the wild beating of his heart, Harry could surely feel beneath his fingertips. “Please know, that this has always been about how I feel about me, and never had anything to do with my feelings for you. I love you Draco, very much, it makes me mad actually.” Harry’s lips quirked into a half-smile and Draco could do nothing but relate to how mad loving Harry had made him.
Ron reached an arm out clasping him on the shoulder, “Harry, what is it? Malfoy?” His voice was laced with concern, a concern that told him the git was almost finished being angry with him.
Harry wasn’t entirely sure when it had started only that it had, and it drove him absolutely mad. Sure, he wasn’t the neatest flat mate and yes, he did tend to leave his clothes scattered about the various rooms of their flat, shoes too. However, that didn’t mean that his belongings were up for grabs. He’d shared a room with four other people in the dorms of Gryffindor tower and not once had anyone nicked his stuff let alone his clothing.
Harry returned the sentiment with a groan, and a very fevered, “Fuck, Draco” which was all it took for Draco to come, a strangled “
For the first time since they’d found themselves in the predicament of sharing Harry’s tiny cot for a bed, they’d slept apart from one another. Draco rolled onto his back letting himself get lost in the intricate lines along the ceiling, and the gentle creases of his mind. The two boys had always found a way to touch each other in the night, at first delicately, timidly, almost accidentally. But as time wore on the touches were bold, heady, and assuredly on purpose. Therefore, spending the night as though an invisible wall had materialized between them and barred them from reaching out felt like excruciating torture to Draco; he’d barely slept a wink.
Draco’d thrown himself down onto one of the sitting room sofas in an angsty huff some hours ago now, and he hadn’t been bothered to even attempt to yank himself back from the downward spiral he’d lodged himself in.
“You’ll have to share with the rest of us at dinner mate, those muggles really are fucking barmy, aren’t they?”
Draco did as he was told without comment, relishing only slightly in the fact that the other boy had actually spoken to him for the first time since they’d discovered their predicament. Draco pushed his trunk into the room and nudged it into the corner nearest the window and preceded to use it as a seat as to avoid any further awkward standing. Draco felt cross with himself, it seemed that here in this space that was wholly Potter’s he didn’t know how to behave. He felt foreign among what few things it seemed Potter possessed, and therefore didn’t know how to act, his Whitty sarcasm failing him miserably and dying on his tongue. Though Draco also regrettably tried not to remind himself that it wasn’t just being in an unfamiliar place that was making it difficult to know how to act around his former nemesis, desperately shoving the tortured thoughts and revelations from the start of turn to the deepest recesses of his mind. Draco pulled himself from those thoughts and mused that it appeared that if they were both to survive this summer they would have to stick together if Harry’s uncle was anything to go on, and while Draco was good at being alone especially with his thoughts, he considered that having someone to talk to at least every once in a while, would make the experience more bearable.
The group let out a laugh and continued on into the house, Harry was shuffling his feet and Draco could sense that he was being summoned. Hermione could sense it too, “Draco,”
“Don’t go,” Harry spoke so softly and with a voice so full of sleep Draco had to really listen in order to hear him murmur an even softer, “please Draco,” with a waver in his tired voice. Draco gazed at him, almost unsure of how to answer him, ‘it wasn’t as if he could really go anywhere now was it?’ He thought only mildly sarcastically to himself, before he let himself consider what Harry was really asking for which was, ‘please don’t not touch me,’ or at least that was Draco’s take on the situation. “No,” Draco said with a little half-smile, “no, Potter, where would I go, especially after you’ve asked so nicely?” He finished before sliding down the bed onto his side and pulling Potter down to rest within the crook of his neck, fastening both arms securely around him and resting his cheek against his soft dark hair.
“I don’t want to go,” Draco whispered into the crook of Harry’s shoulder, his favorite place truly. Not that Harry minded, let him stay there honestly.
Draco was lulled from his anxious mind by the familiar warmth of Harry’s weight leaning into him. He looked over at where Harry was now leaning against his shoulder perched next to him on the stairs leading out into the Weasley’s back yard. Draco’s eyes wandered up Harry’s form and lingered on the boy’s lips curved into a soft smile before meeting his eyes, searching.
Harry didn’t dare break their gaze knowing that their intense game had again reached a new level. After several long moments of observing one another in silence Harry glanced down at Malfoy’s hands gently resting on top of the book in his lap. With only a moment of hesitation Harry lunged forward and pulled one of Malfoy’s hands into his own before speaking. “The war changed us all, I feel like I can’t even say for better or for worse, just differently.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile softly to himself, they made quite a lovesick pair, the two of them. The thought gave him the little nudge of courage he needed, and so he approached with caution.
I know the ending is a little open-ended, but I have definitely thought of some sequel ideas, let me know if you'd be interested in seeing where this plot takes our boys next! :)
“Morning Malfoy,” Potter greeted as he pulled two pieces of toast onto his plate and began lathering them with butter.
They were both left there in the middle of the small bathroom on their knees, pulled together as tightly as their bodies would allow, grinning at each other like complete and utter idiots.
Draco let out a sigh, and really looked at her. He felt overcome by just how much he wanted her to understand this next bit, and hoped he was conveying it.
“I’m sorry, I know I took too long, I…” Draco trailed off, but Harry knew what he meant. He gazed into the other boy’s eyes so full, so earnest, and Harry was struck once again by just how fond he’d grown of Draco, and he couldn’t stop himself.
Draco pulled away first, softly, wanting to test the waters a bit more his devious mind having previously already been set on the goal of making Harry feel good on his birthday.
“Come on Harry, Were Malfoy and Potter we can’t just ‘feel it out,’ people will notice if we’re holding hands and snogging in empty corridors.”
And here we have it, a long Draco chapter! :) I hope you enjoyed...we're definitely getting somewhere with them now! I know I tagged this 'slow burn' but truthfully it won't be too slow, I get too exasperated with myself when writing them I can't help it!
Draco perched himself on the edge of his trunk facing Potter, “Who’s Dudley?” Draco spoke softly and without his usual sneer which appeared to almost knock Potter off his bed. Draco watched as the other boy sat up and pushed his glasses up his nose before answering him, “my cousin,” he seemed to trail off a bit at the end unsure if he should continue. Draco held his breath unsure if he should be hoping he would keep talking or let them fall back into the silence they had grown accustomed to the last couple of days, as opposed to their usual cruel banter.
Draco sat up, pulling his legs up and crossing them on the bed, he leaned back propped up on his hands, and let out what was probably the fiftieth sigh that morning in a big huff. For the first time that summer he felt certain that he wanted to talk to his mother. He’d been content to live in a bubble with Harry the past month and a half, too caught up in the fact that Harry had seen him, not only had he seen him, but he’d found him worthy. He hadn’t wanted to do anything to pop that bubble, he wanted to avoid any shining light on the realities that faced them. Hell, the two boys had made a pact at the beginning of their summer to avoid realities and any sense of brooding until the summer ended, they’d not wanted to live in any adult decision making.
“You see…well, I mean…I know the bond is going to wear off in a few days, or at least it should, it’s never been very clear…I mean, well that doesn’t matter so much. The point is, the charm should mimic our bond so when it wears off, and we’re apart far more often then we’d like to be…you can touch that dragon and it will feel like it feels when we touch now…”
He let himself relish in the way Harry pressed himself into all the lines, creases, and angles of his body, folding himself to fit the two of them together in a way that left nothing to the imagination. Draco sighed as Harry breathed him in, burying his own face into Draco’s neck and grabbing ahold of the shirt at his back as if Draco might disaparate and Harry’s only wish was to keep him put.
Harry had been woken up several times in the short amount of time they’d been bunking together with Malfoy’s sad whimpers as he tossed and turned on the three times to small cot they shared. But did Harry dare share his nightmares with Malfoy?
Draco knew the feelings he felt for Potter went beyond that of a friend, even if he wasn’t willing to fully admit it to himself yet. However, his feelings were beginning to become so overwhelming and consuming that he felt sure he might suffocate from the crushing weight of his own turmoil. The truth was that Draco didn’t really know how he felt about the idea of fancying another bloke. It’s not as if Potter were the first, of course he knew he just hadn’t been faced with the idea full force and at such high velocity. Draco thought he might like the idea of escaping into a place where he could freely try on the idea without the weight of his own heart. Looking at the situation through the eyes of someone else became the only reasonable solution to his Potter problem, and so he knew it was time to add a new escape to his collection.
Harry watched as Draco turned back to face him, a small half-smile in place as he met his eyes, before abruptly turning back towards the table, “I almost forgot, Dudley,” he said calmly almost kindly waiting for the boy to look back up at him from the table. Harry looked on as Dudley glanced up at Draco, face pale.
She gave him a pointed look and a nod, “See you downstairs then,” and she vanished, door closing softly behind her.
Draco and Hermione looked up as the group of Weasley’s followed by Harry were trudging back from the open field they’d been using to play.
“It would be so easy to say that I want things to stay like this all the time, and that I don’t give a fuck who knows about us…but…” This time Draco’s sigh was a bit more exasperated.
He let himself fall back against their cot, reaching to pull Harry with him not caring in the slightest about their mess. He wanted to lay there and bask in it all, in everything Harry had said with his body, in his movements. By letting his guard down he’d released so many wordless admissions and Draco felt privileged to be on the receiving end, especially when he still felt so unworthy when it came to the brunette; he’d made so many poor decisions thus far.
Draco allowed himself to let out his own shaky laugh and be pulled into Harry’s side as the other boy wrapped his arms around him. Draco let himself get lost in all the warmth and sighed deeply taking in Harry’s scent and softness; he never wanted the brunette to let him go.
Draco spends the rest of the day agonizing over which of the books in his swiftly growing collection he should share with Potter. He thinks it’s interesting because he’s never thought of loaning someone a book as something so intimate before. However, he’s never really had the opportunity to share his books with anyone until now either. During his time at home after the war Draco found he needed something, a distraction from everything going on around him. Watching his father’s trial and subsequent shipping off to Azkaban, his mother’s numerous and dubious coping mechanisms, and flitting around a house that was more reminiscent of a prison than the place where he grew up, despite his mother’s best efforts.
Harry dared not to speak, his face open with acceptance and in recognition of what Malfoy was endeavoring to accomplish. Malfoy looked back up into Harry’s eyes meaningfully, “I- I’m sorry Harry.”
Secretly, Draco had been thrilled by the letter. Mostly because it was clear that whatever Harry had written was enough to convince Hermione Granger that he was in love with Draco. “And yes, Harry, you didn’t have to say it in your letter, it’s clear your more than fond. The rambling was very telling.”  He’dbeen replaying the words in his mind over and over that day. Sure, Harry had explicitly told him he loved him and continued to do so, but now he’d pretty much confessed as much to someone else.
Harry looked down at the book in Draco’s outstretched hand, “I Am the Messenger” Harry stated aloud like a question.
Harry quirked up his lips in his own half-smile the one that seemed to be reserved entirely for Draco, and feigned interest in a plot that he had already missed too much of. He could feel the prickle of the bond where their hands were joined and took a deep breath to steady himself. He relaxed his hand against Draco’s, so their fingertips were pressed together and began lazily tracing the lines, creases, edges of the other boy’s hand with the tips of his fingers.
As warm fingers wrapped around his painfully hard prick, he couldn’t help but groan, and let his head fall back against the cot as his eyes squeezed shut. He Hardly wanted this to be over before it even really began.
“Fuck, you’re amazing,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. He smiled when the other boy let out a small laugh and pulled back to look at him, and Harry knew that Draco understood.
Harry could do nothing but let out a laugh at that, daring to glance over at Draco from the corner of his eye. Draco’s lips were drawn up in a shy smile and his cheeks a soft shade of pink; Harry’s favorite.
Draco knew he had to get up and face the day, but he was feeling too anxious. Last night Draco had finally gotten the courage to share his book with Harry. He hoped that when he read it, he would understand that Harry was Draco’s Oliver. And now, he was trying to force himself to go downstairs and face the day when he knew that every moment would lead to stolen glances towards Harry wondering where he was and how he felt. Draco finally knew the moment he had finished reading the novel exactly how he felt about Harry, he loved him, he was in love with him. He knew it absolutely and without a second thought which was both petrifying and liberating to admit all at once.
, he’d confessed to Draco about writing to Hermione. He felt safe with Draco, and so he rambled on for a while professing his confusion about who he was, and when Draco encouraged him like he meant it, like he actually wanted Harry to confide in him, he kept going. He told Draco his fears about Hermione and Ron and how important they and the Weasley’s were to him.
“Of course Draco, it seems as though you’re stuck with us” Granger said with a smile and Draco could do nothing but smile back. “Should you both just try and bypass Professor Snape, and go straight to Dumbledore – Especially if that bond still hasn’t worn off by the time, we make it back to school?”
This was something friends did, right? Friends casually touched like this, didn’t they? He thought about Ron and Hermione, and then quickly tried to think about his own relationship with both Ron and Hermione separately, and not the relationship they shared with one another. He loved them both, they were more like family to him than friends, and truly he would do anything for either of them. Though the more he thought about it the more he reasoned with himself that he didn’t want to find any reason no matter how small to be this close to Ron or Hermione. Sure, he liked spending time with them, but did he try to find just any reason no matter how miniscule to be in their presence?...The answer he knew was, no.
There are definitely a couple of 'plot twists' on the way in the next two chapters, this little heart to heart has definitely helped pave the way! :)
Draco paused and looked into his eyes for what felt like years before speaking, making Harry’s soft smile waver in understanding.
Draco knew he was wound pretty tightly; he knew that he had spent most of the term wishing to be invisible and calculating most of his moves with his past in mind. But with Harry, in this moment he knew he wasn’t thinking. With Harry he could just let go, and feel, and be alive, and
Draco couldn’t help but smile fondly at the daft git. He was absolutely sure he would never get used to just how little Harry seemed to care about what others thought of him. Their eyes met, and Harry ran his fingertips down the side of Draco’s face, he was helpless to do anything but lean into the touch and let his eyes close.
“I, ugh” … “Harry, It’s not that simple.” Draco sat up fully running his hands through his hair in exasperation once again.  Draco knew Harry was asking him a question, but it was one he didn’t feel he could answer.
I don’t know? We’ve become friends, well more than that really. I guess I should just call him Draco, I stopped referring to him as Malfoy two days into the summer actually.
He longed for that laugh now, he longed for Draco’s long slender fingers to wrap around his to feel their softness. He longed for gray eyes especially when the gray was laced with emotion; surprise, arrogance, sincerity, desire…
“Well, I think it’s sweet. They both deserve something nice; they’ve been through enough as it is, and I think we should all be happy for them both.”
“I know already I won’t be good at not touching you, ‘Mione has been snapping at me the last two days, I’m terrible, truly. I’m sorry in advance for being the one to blow our cover.”
Draco let out a genuine laugh, before unfolding his arms and reaching into his pocket for the small box he’d had hidden there all evening; burning a hole in his pocket so to speak.
“No, and it’s been maddening to say the least, I have no idea what I’m walking into. I don’t even know if Severus will be at school, or even speak with me if he is.”
Initially, he thought Mrs. Weasley’s holiday invitation was just one of polite extension, knowing fully that she had meant it, and would welcome him at the holiday’s with open arms. However, Mr. Weasley’s words wrung in his head, ‘I expect we’ll see you at Christmas.’ Draco honestly hadn’t given a lick of thought to the holiday’s, his main focus on just getting through first term unscathed. Well, that and speaking with Severus about what happened in his absence. What did the Weasley’s know about, that he didn’t? Who had already decided that Draco was to spend Christmas at the Burrow, not that he was complaining in the slightest, he felt safe there, Harry was there. If anything, Draco figured that he wouldn’t be leaving the castle that year, let alone to travel for any of the holidays.
As he watched Harry throw his head back in laughter, he couldn’t help but grin. He began to feel a little less anxious as before. Sure, he still had a ways to go. He needed to speak with Hermione, and Ron, and possibly several other Weasley’s, but he knew he had won over Mrs. Weasley, at least a little bit and he felt keen to let himself have that small victory.
And Draco pulled the brunette to his lips, knowing full well that Harry was unlikely to make it very long without a kiss and the thought alone made his heart feel full.
Draco eased his grip on Harry’s hair, and leaned back a little before fully flopping himself down onto the counter legs hanging off the sides keeping Harry bracketed in.
Also, like I said before my Harry chapters are usually on the shorter side, writing Draco just flows but for some reason Harry doesn't come as naturally! I think this is why this fic has taken me so long! I promise the next chapter is a longer Draco! :)
Harry felt the loss immediately, both boys had been making a sly game out of seeing how many inconspicuous touches they could sneak without anyone being the wiser. Harry’d been pleased with their game; he’d definitely been winning. He couldn’t not touch Malfoy. He’d happily let the crowd of people pushing around them be an excuse to place a hand on Draco’s lower back guiding him away from people pushing past, while simultaneously pulling him closer so their bodies were flush from shoulder to hip.
Harry looked over fondly at the blonde who was curled up faced away from him, a first for them since they’d not even been this distant on night one. All he longed to do was reach over to the blonde, run his fingers along his spine, bury his face in the crook of his neck and breathe him in, tease him about his blatant confession of loving Harry for much longer than he’d been willing to admit (how long had it been exactly?), and so why couldn’t he? Why was he holding himself back?
With a huff Harry looked at the pages of the notebook in front of him truly perplexed as to where to start. How could he even begin to explain this to Hermione? Harry knew she was bound to be a little put out that Harry hadn’t told her sooner, he knew she loved and cared for him, he mused that she was probably the person aside from Draco who knew him best. ‘Mione could read him like no other. Harry knew that even if he didn’t tell her, she would undoubtably be one step ahead of him anyways; she always was. He mused that she probably knew things about him that he hadn’t even uncovered for himself yet;
I know that was a lot, I’m sorry to get it all out in such a rush, I just, I didn’t know how else to put it. And that’s not the only thing Draco’s admitted to me this summer either…He’s told me, well, he’s told me that he loves me, that he’s in love with me. Again, I know this is probably a shock, I know I should have been writing more, and I’m sure you’re maybe wondering, possibly, why I’m telling you all this now? The answer, in short, is that I don’t really know. In part, I don’t really know what to say to Draco, and I don’t know how to tell you this, how I feel about him, without also telling myself. And that sounds mad, I know it does. And I’ve completely put him off. I mean he also put me off when I avoided his admission by calling him out on what choice he might make when we get back to school and he has nothing keeping him from being dragged home by Voldemort to take the mark. The most peculiar part of the whole thing was that I actually understood where the git was coming from; it being hard to go against his family and all even though it’s become perfectly clear to me this summer that following along with his parent’s choices for him is not what he wants in the least.
“This is it,” he said, laying his eyes on Draco, deeming to search, and convey, and telepathically tell Draco everything through eye contact alone. A skillset they had both grown very practiced in.
Harry didn’t let himself think about how quickly that moment they’d shared in their tunnel had altered their relationship. He only wanted to bask in it, if he thought about it for too long, he would start to question, and over think, and brood. That wouldn’t do as he and Draco had a pact that strictly prohibited brooding until summer was over.
he thought to himself. Harry exhales, before raising his hand up and knocking on Draco’s door before he could dwell too much on what the consequences might be, thinking that the consequences wouldn’t really matter in the long run anyways so long as he could be in the same room as Malfoy.
Even with Malfoy right next to him the ache hadn’t fully waned, and while it wasn’t painful anymore it was still frustrating. Harry looked up at the headmaster with an inquiring look, why were both he and Snape there, surely professor Dumbledore was more than capable of delivering travel instructions and relaying the Dursley’s disapproving agreement on his own. It was a moment before professor Dumbledore spoke, choosing to give both boys an authentic look before starting, “It is clear that both of you are suffering the effects of the bond,” he paused again giving them each a look almost urging them to deny the accusation before continuing on again. “I understand how uncomfortable it can be to be apart from the person you are bonded with, so forgive me, both of you, for separating you. However, it had to be done. I will say this; it has been my experience that after a period of separation a bit of physical contact usually abides the pain you may be experiencing now.”
As Draco looked out the window, he surmised from the purplish blue hews of the sky that they had probably missed dinner, not that the Dursley’s probably missed the two of them, mind not having them to use as house elves. “You think they left us anything, or are we going to have to fast instead of dinner tonight?” Draco asked with a nudge to Harry’s arm and a gesture towards the window. “Ha, they’re probably hoping we got hit by a car and they’re rid of us for good. Don’t worry though, I’ve got a stash from Honey Duke’s hidden up in my room, probably better than my aunt’s cooking anyways,” Harry replied with a nudge and half-smile of his own.
Draco shifted on his back and craned his neck back up to look up as dusk began to adorn the sky with soft hues of pink, but a suggestion of rain added in hues of dark blue. He shifted his thoughts back to Potter’s birthday, next week, of course he knew he was going to agonize over it. He could only imagine the kind of birthday’s Potter had endured growing up here, in this hell hole of a place. He wanted to at the very least get Potter something special, something that would maybe solidify their friendship, something that would maybe solidify the other boy’s trust in him. Afterall, after Potter’s birthday they’d only have one more month, four weeks, thirty days, until they returned to Hogwarts, but Draco didn’t want to think about that yet.
“Draco,” Dumbledore spoke softly, drawing Draco’s gaze over to the headmaster. “Can you tell me what you remember?”
“Harry, I’m pretty sure Knockturn alley would be more welcoming than this place. Although, this place has the same feeling as the manor just smaller living space, and the servants are elves and not family members we’ve enslaved.”
They gazed at each other for a moment, and he noticed that Granger’s gaze was more of a challenge, a daring indication that she wouldn’t be the first to speak; not this time.
“Fuck Harry, honestly,” Draco groaned out and Harry knew he wouldn’t last long. He was also hit with the notion that it was perfectly clear how it had been possible for Draco to come untouched from giving Harry head on his birthday. Looking up at Draco, he was bloody hot, so fucking beguiling he was positive that he could easily come in his pants from looking at Draco alone.
“Shut the fuck up Potter, don’t presume to think you know anything about me, you don’t.” Malfoy spoke softly and without malice, his eyes were down cast and he had a look on his face that made him look so much younger than he was, and it yanked on the strings of Harry’s heart just a bit. Harry mused to himself that the Malfoy he was most familiar with would have told him to fuck off a long time ago, hell, the Malfoy that he was most familiar with wouldn’t dare touch Harry let alone comfort him after an awful dream. The way Malfoy was treating him, these were not changes that could be made in an instant, with the snap of a finger, and so it made Harry even more curious about the blonde who seemed to rile him up in more ways than one.
