Draco was about to move to the Islands, a place only sirens could travel, where he would be hidden away for the rest of his life. His mother was sending him away to keep him safe, where the Ministry could never find him, and Potter... Potter would always be on their radar. There was nothing subtle about him, he was a bloody reckless Gryffindor that attracted attention wherever he went!
What an odd thought. Why would he be the cause of something so rotten, unless...?
Potter leapt out from behind a pillar, practically stabbing his wand into Draco's throat. For fuck's sake, how hard was it to avoid getting the Scarhead's attention 'round here? Was there no one else he could bother?
Harry sat a bit straighter.Â "Yes?" he squeaked out.
He pressed their bodies as close together as physically possible, chest rumbling in happiness at the pliant putty that Harry turned into at his actions. He grabbed at his robes, Harry trying to push a little space between them as to be able to remove them, and Draco huffed in annoyance. The other boy seemed to find this amusing as he chuckled at the look on Draco's face before pulling the robes off and loosening his own tie. Draco crowded back against him the second Harry finished throwing the tie to the ground.
cabin. Something that became increasingly evident as they crossed over the threshold, the normalcy of the inside suffocating.
Severus stood with his spine ramrod straight to the point where Draco wondered how much pain the posture was bringing to the Potions master.
"Mr. Potter?" McGonagall called him out after a moment's silence gone too long.
The hike through the forest felt like a blur. It had been a far walk--was it three miles? Four?--yet it felt like it had only taken them five minutes. The trees were thinning out, the beige castle walls peering through to confront him. They stopped, and Corey reached into his knapsack to rummage around.
Both were distracted by Cassie throwing her duvet out of the way to slowly climb out of bed, looking green from the small effort. She
Ugh, bloody pure-bloods and the accepted notion that marrying your cousin was the key to continuing the bloodline. Cassie and him were also vaguely related, a good five times removed, and the idea still grossed him out.
Andrew was staring straight at him.
He nodded, ripping the grass out by the root.
But he couldn't.
She made a choreographed movement with her hands in the shapes of different symbols and the water rippled around her. He carefully copied the motions and felt a ripple embrace him as well.
Below the headline was a picture taken of him at the beginning of last summer, likely submitted to the
There was a crash of something falling to the ground in the next room over, followed by hysterical giggles. The door slammed open and out twirled an ecstatic Cassiopeia that rushed over to Draco, grabbing his hand and twirling him alongside her. Her joy was contagious to the point that he couldn't resist not joining in on the laughter.
Severus did not seem amused at being called a 'giant teddy bear' by Cassie. Although, his true thoughts on the matter were hard to decipher, as his facial expression remained stoic as ever, and he simply stared at her just a second too long before acting like he hadn't heard her.
She rolled her eyes. "He's also well aware you're a siren. That didn't deter him in the slightest from drooling at the sight of you this afternoon."
An obvious yes, then.
he's reached the brink of sleep. How splendid.
Moody nodded. "Excellent. Five points to Slytherin. Now, why are sirens considered more dangerous than most other types of magical creatures?"
Blaise glared daggers, but seemed content with the responding silence that fell over their loudmouth companion.
She leapt away before he could turn and retaliate against her threats. Andrew merely gave him a small pat on the shoulder as he brushed past him to follow her out of the door. Alas, as they say... If you can't beat 'em...
She continued in her tirade. "I have a father! He's
"Maybe I'll just move in with you two-" Draco said, and Andrew's head snapped up to glare daggers at him. On second thought...
The lion blinked, then held out a hand. "Sorry, I don't think we've met, I'm Harry Potter. Me and Draco are friends."
"I don't
Harry rolled his eyes, knowing the two of them were done listening to anything he had to say. He'd show them how wrong they were. Malfoy was a conniving Slytherin that hated his guts, there was no way he'd suddenly be interested in becoming friends with Harry's muggle-born friend, with his whole house not saying a word about it.
A drop fell onto Severus' hands. Another, his robes, the tear-stain the only evidence that what Draco was hearing was true.
Krum raised his wand to strike again, and Cassie entered the hedge wall which enveloped her to keep her out of sight. Draco would have followed if he wasn't glued to his spot in terror.
Draco had no idea what to say to that.
did you really think I was going to use my Song on Dumbledore?" her voice was closer to a stage-whisper than an actual one, and the two professors in front of them could definitely hear that snippet of conversation.
Draco had been pestering Cassiopeia with his worries for the rest of the day. "Are you certain he doesn't know? What if he was hinting that he suspects us?"
So they laid on the rocks, tails dangling off into the lulling water as exhaustion seeped further into their bones.
There was a proper common room this time. Draco was drawn instantly to the far wall, his feet carrying him to the enormous windows that looked out into the Black Lake. It was nostalgic of the Slytherin common room while also nothing like it at all. The entire wall was comprised of floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the room in a greenish glow.
to be sleeping in there as well, but he rarely moved from his permanent fixture at Cassie's bedside. Her bed was closer to the pool connected to the Black Lake--which had been a purposeful decision--but Draco still hadn't figured out the reasoning for the placement.
Severus came back in, looking slightly out of breath. "You've been dismissed from your classes for the day. Cassiopeia is dismissed as well, from every class except for Defense."
Hexes were being swapped a couple hundred feet to the east of them, and the hedges bent and curled to make a path for them. They stopped a few feet away from Diggory, using a charm to peer through the hedges unseen. He was being overcome by the skrewt and looked worse for wear. As the conflict progressed, it appeared less and less that Diggory would be able to walk away in the end. Cassie gave him a pointed look, and he hummed a few notes, the skrewt easing up enough in the fight for Diggory to get the upper-hand needed to win (and more importantly, walk out of the squabble alive).
She sat across from them as usual, whispering to Ginny on her right. The whole table was trying to figure out why they had been summoned, as where the tables of the other three houses. No students from the two visiting schools were present.
Cassie seemed more invested in her pie than she did in his words. Andrew had not once paused to look up from his writing.
Potter made a grunt of confusion yet still obliged and followed. At first, Draco wasn't certain where he was even going, but he was not running about aimlessly. She was guiding him, She would led him to safety.
The door swung shut, and Andrew glanced wearily throughout the space. Where had Cassie gone?
"For one, he's human."
Draco wanted to shout in their defense.
The others went on ahead of them, not paying them much mind (well aware they would get all the juicy details later).
"Stop crowding him!"
"Don't worry! I already told her as much. And, I'm so glad you agree, because she's going to be here in an hour to come study."
The knocking turned into banging. "Draco!"
That was it. The rest of Slytherin didn't give Malfoy any flack for his sudden change in behavior, treating him just the same, if not
Three heads breached the water's surface, Andrew and Corey holding up a slumped figure between the two of them. Draco sobbed as he broke away from his grasp and threw himself at the trio, helping them to rush an unconscious Cassie onto the shore.
Moony looked amused from where he watched the rolling scenery out the window. He had tried to sit in a compartment by himself, but the trio had none of that.
Andrew pressed back firmly, a hand coming up to squeeze at his shoulder in reassurance. On his other side, Corey leaned forward to speak to Andrew.
His response elicited even
Bloody hell, she knew? Was there anyone in this damn castle that wasn't aware of its siren occupants? Why was Draco just finding out about all these people now?
It was a tale that he was regaled with at least once every week. Not that he minded. With each recollection, it was like the power of his ancestors was brought forth in his veins, his blood boiling to continue their legacy.
trigger warnings for mentions of drowning/violence/mentioned non-con in mythology (all not explicit in their descriptions)
"Hm. Interesting."
Friends that he had barely communicated with all summer, and who he would have to keep his distance from to keep both him and themselves safe. If they discovered his secret and harbored it (as he knew they would), they could be charged as accomplices in harboring a fugitive creature. If he was going down, he would not drag them with him.
Finally calming down, he wiped the tears from his cheeks. Hermione stopped talking, just sat there waiting patiently for him.
Draco spun on his heel. Potter was covering his ears with a grimace, but hadn't fallen to the ground like the others. Draco ran for him, grabbing a forearm with an unrelinquishing grip and took off. Either Potter would follow or risk his arm getting ripped from its socket.
Someone called out his name as his consciousness slipped away.
Severus had many regrets. It had defined much of his life, if it wasn't the source of his misery, then it was a byproduct. His biggest regret had been choosing a life of hatred that led him down the path he currently walked, and how it put his daughter's life in the same line of fire that killed her mother.
"You know," Corey said, "It's a shame, really. How at Hogwarts, you'll be concealed by polyjuice potion."
Draco let out a light chuckle in amusement. "I'd be more upset if it were anyone else stealing your attention from me, but even I'll admit there are few beings as attractive as Andrew."
He swallowed, trying to clear his dry throat. "I do."
Lupin had surprisingly kept his cool for this long, but was stolen of the chance to defend himself by the most unlikely of allies.
Cassie opened the bathroom door with her side, carefully maneuvering a tray in her hands from bumping into anything. She brought it over and set it on the side of the pool ledge before placing both hands on her hips and looking down at Draco, who laid miserably on the floor surrounded by a pile of dead skin and blood.
All it did was fill him with a sense of dread.
Sorry, but two events of mass genocide were hard to look past.
Andrew was eerily calm as he slipped around the table to stand in front of them. Umbridge had taken a step back in uncertainty, the grip on her wand so tight her hand was shaking.
The Oracles sat gathered around the reflecting pool, watching the stagnant water begin to dance in a series of twists and turns; its color evolving from a murky copper to a moonstone white-blue. The array of circles then collided in a violent crash that sent droplets spraying onto the Oracles' faces, and as the water descended back down to the pool, it settled in an instant, falling straight like the strings holding it up had been severed. It could have been described like blinking, and how upon reopening your eyes the pool appeared as though the water had not been disturbed in eons. The force of gravity was not welcome here, nor any other authority of nature.
As a siren, he was stunning. Bright red scales like a rose in bloom with the loveliest orange undertones, accented by random patches of gold scales. His fins had gotten a similar treatment, stained crimson with more streaks of simmering gold that were craftily subtle, only popping out in the sunlight. Contrasted against the deep blue sea, it was like looking at a fallen star.
Draco frowned, until a lightbulb went off in his head. "There's been a development there, you see, I broke the courtship with him, which he took surprisingly well, and that's actually one of the reasons I came to-"
Although... His dignity was the last thing on his mind.
Draco remained silent. There wasn't really a script for a conversation like this one, especially given the fact that it was mostly one-sided.
Potter straightened in his seat. "Why is it a secret? I don't understand."
"Something is coming, Dray. We both know it. Even before what happened to Jessica, I've been-, I've been tasked with uncovering more about the threat. I can't disobey Her wishes."
"Of course, Draco, you can tell me anything. I pinky swear on it."
"Would you like to join me tomorrow afternoon to study? I can meet you outside of the Great Hall after lunch," Draco offered, and Harry began nodding in agreement before Draco could even get his full sentence out.
Cassie set down her mug, straightening in her spot. "Every professor is empathetic of my cousin's illness except for Moody? Why am I not surprised?"
It was subtle differences. But he had a trained eye, and two other sirens as his real-life models. Gone was the roundness of his face and the youthful innocence it conveyed. Gone was the gentleness of his features, instead replaced with sharp bones and harsh beauty. There was something oddly birdlike about how it all came together. The face of a monster. Destined to reside in deep, dark waters.
Snape turned, robes whipping with the curt motion, and he marched away to avoid further questioning. Harry's heart was attempting to barrel its way out of his chest with how hard it was beating. What Snape suggested... It changed everything. He didn't even try to deter Harry from his investigation, and his admitted defeat was as good as proof!
"You don't have a choice in this anymore, Draco, you have to tell him."
Harry turned to the door to make his escape, and Draco panicked.
He didn't even know the two of them were corresponding. He wondered if this had been one-time-only sort of occasion or a regularly scheduled talk-about-Draco-behind-his-back type of thing.
"Cass!" he called out, and she waved him over.
Ron stopped scanning to turn to him in concern. "Is this some Muggle thing? Same-sex attraction isn't unnatural if that's your question, it's just not some people's cup of tea. Heck, I have a great uncle that's gay, don't see him too often but he's alright-"
He was reminded of this fact from where he sat in the courtyard as Draco and Andrew walked through the entrance. It might have been his imagination, but he almost swore he had caught Draco looking his way a few times.
"Do you feel better now?"
"Snap out of it," Cassie hissed, but the Imperius Curse didn't lift. Someone had not only stunned Delacour, but put Krum under an Imperio... If they saw Cassie trying to pull Krum out of the curse- They had to be nearby, where were they?
Corey pressed into Draco's side, and he returned the gesture. He wouldn't be alone in this. Had someone to confide in. He thought back to the conversation they'd had only a few hours prior sat on the rocky shoreline of the island.
The Americans dancing, a mesmerizing movement that had drawn a crowd around them. Ron had stood, moving to them as if under a spell, his hold on Harry still not relinquished and forcing him to follow.
"I didn't just come with you to Hogwarts to help you with your transition. The Triwizard Tournament is a colossal event that only happens once in a blue moon. Behind the curtain there are so many things happening, there's been shifts in magic itself, in the very essence of nature, and She feels it. She knows that something is coming, and She's scared. Whatever is happening, the sirens need to know about it. We need to be prepared. She refuses for our kind to be threatened any longer."
Mm. Him and all the others.
Her words had grown into a hurried excitement by the end. Draco was glad she found his birthright prophecy so fascinating. He loved not having a say in his destiny. Not having a choice in the war.
"My dear boy, you are simply in grief, and I forgive you-"
Cassie was shaking, the fury on her face enough to make Draco pull his shoulders in on himself. "The reflecting pool water is toxic! If it doesn't kill you, it drives you mad! I don't see how that helps us at all in our fight to keep sirens safe!"
"Three days ago we hadn't exhausted all other ideas. Besides, we've saved the healers time by trying everything wizardkind is capable of."
"Yes," Draco confirmed, eyebrows furrowing as he analyzed his face. Harry's brain was simply a pile of goo at this point. Nothing even resembling intelligence would ever come of it again.
"Good. Good. I asked Blaise Zabini to the Yule Ball."
"Ron!" he complained, craning his neck around the corner to watch the three head towards the dungeons.
Draco's glassy stare fixated at a point on the wall, his choppy breathing growing quiet as he matched Cassie's note. The buzzing in Harry's chest intensified as the two Nightingales fell in sync, and he had to lean against the bed nearest for support so he didn't crash to the ground.
Andrew wasn't someone he had ever gotten to know really well, but over the summer he'd learned at Order meetings that he was Cassie's mate. That was important in their culture, something more sacred than marriage. Draco would have one soon, some lousy American that Harry knew nothing about. How did they even know that he would be good for Draco? That he didn't have some ulterior motive, that he'd look out for Draco better than anyone else would?
Jessica. Jessica, who cooked him muggle foods out of a box many times over the summer, late at night when he had cravings for a snack. Jess, who was kind and pretty and would listen to him talk about nonsense for hours. Jess, whose tail reminded him of an aurora in the night sky, shining just as brightly as her personality.
The common room, as it turned out, could transform into a makeshift classroom. Four tables lined the bookshelf/fireplace wall with three chairs at each. An extra chair sat awkwardly in front of the table closest to the dorms. Draco dragged it behind the table before climbing over to the chair squished against the wall. The corner spot helped release some of the tightness in his chest that had been building all morning.
âThatâs a twenty-year gap,â Harry murmured. âHe wasnât in the system. I checked.â
âKinda stressed,â Harry admitted when Draco didnât start. âWorkâs a mess.â He sighed. âHome isâ¦ I donât know. Different.â
They stepped into the lake together, allowing Her to whisk them away from the madness and chaos. Away from the life Draco had long abandoned. Away from the boy his heart could not.
As Draco wasnât allowed to speak unless spoken to, and his parents were unlikely to address him it was usually a quiet affair to him. Tonight, however, his mother started talking as soon as they sat down, fuming with anger.
Draco looked at his feet, shuffling them a little bit. âI felt a bit lonelyâ¦â
Feeling a bit insecure about my writing today
Hermioneâs gaze slid towards Draco and she gasped, âoh is it
âI wasnât aware.â
âOkay, letâs do it,â  Draco said impatiently.
âGood,â he answered breathlessly.
Harry brought up one hand and tangled it in Dracoâs hair. âYouâre such a good boy.â
Draco stared at the floor. âByeâ¦â
Someone rattled the lock on his door, and he heard a frustrated, â
Adelaide hesitated, he could see. âItâsâ¦ Iâm soâ¦ Iâm sick all the time.â She gave him a watery smile, âbut at the same time itâs so lovely. There is something of my own growing in there. I can feel it there every dayâ¦ I canât help but already be in love with it.â
On Saturday, the trio went to Diagon Alley to do some shopping. As they arrived in the Leaky Cauldron, Remus slipped away from Harry and Draco, murmuring; âIâm meeting someone. Iâll wait for you here.â
YOU WERE ALL RIGHT!
Some of them nodded.
Victoria and Elizabeth were asleep in the nursery. Remus was keeping an eye on them. And yet, Draco felt an incessant pull towards his babies. It took effort to ignore his panicky instincts.
âMy parents were abusers.â
, he thought a little amusedly,
âIâm here, Iâm here.â Harry dropped himself in the nest too, petting Dracoâs soft skin from his feet up, skipped over his arse and placed one hand firmly in the small of his back, earning an eager moan from Draco. He shuffled a little closer, positioning himself in the ideal position whilst keeping the pressure on Dracoâs spine, keeping him eager and compliant.
He was gone within seconds.
After wandering around to prevent himself from looking too suspicious, (because even though he felt welcome, he didnât want to bolt into the Omega section right away), Draco carefully set foot in the âOmegaâ section of the bookstore. It was currently an empty aisle, which made him feel more comfortable immediately.
âLook at me,â Harry growled and Draco opened his eyes, seeing a blurry vision of his strong mate. He smiled, then managed another needy whine.
By day three, they came to the amicable solution of Harry just lounging around and reading, while Draco did whatever he wanted to do.
As the days passed by without seeing his Alpha, Draco became grumpier and grumpier. Mrs Weasley had told him that Harry couldnât visit until everything had been taken care of and formalised, but he hadnât thought it would take
Draco stood up, behind his chair.
. âWell. I assume youâre not here to socialise - Iâm not. So, uh. Iâll just read until visiting time is over.â They were allotted a maximum of two hours every day.
âReallyâ¦â Draco murmured, not all that interested.
Draco looked back down, at his notes. âWell, about bonds, that was about itâ¦â
Crabbe cackled as he left the room, locking the door with a lock and a spell.
Silence.
âYes, your parentsâ names,â Draco confirmed.
Harry frowned. âA little over forty-six galleons, I think. But itâs okay, Iâve got enough pounds on me.â
oops.
His words did much more to calm Dracoâs frayed nerves than Hermione had done.
âYes.â He drew in a deep breath, âIâve never been treated this well in my life. My new Alpha is great.â
âYouâre first-time parents?â Mara guessed.
The sudden re-appearance of Miss Greengrass and Harry had startled Draco, but he tried to appear unmoved, as if the conversation between him and Astoria had been completely normal.
Mr Potter didnât seem to notice. He hugged Mrs Weasley, whispering something to her. She smiled and gestured at Draco, after which Mr Potter walked up to him and bowed. Another whiff of scent. âItâs a pleasure to see you in such good health, Draco,â Mr Potter said when he stood upright again.
âDracoâ¦â
Mr Potter gasped and jerked his hips away. âNo, Draco.â
âIâll leave immediately then, I told Hermione why I would be in late but I really donât want to be any later than I have to be,â Harry said in a rushed matter and he stepped towards the floo again. âBye, Draco.â
âAh, excuse me.â Mr Potter withdrew his hand and bowed politely.
âThat doesnât sound too bad.â
âHey,â he murmured, stretching his hand out, offering his wrist to the other Omega. The man looked up, and his eyes were filled with tears and fear. His breathing remained erratic.
âWhy are you always wearing a bracelet?â Victoria - she was so nosy sometimes, and Draco suspected she might be an Alpha - stepped up to Sirius and grabbed the chain that was strung between him and Remus. It only appeared outside of the house, and it was the reason why Sirius did not go out much. He felt uncomfortable with the visible reminder that he was a convict.
âWell, anyway, how are you and Harry?â Adelaide brushed their previous subject aside easily and looked at him curiously.
âDraco, his
Gratefully, Draco picked up the cup and took a few sips. âItâs not that bad... I expected worse.â
Harry closed his arms around Draco, and Draco leaned into it, allowing his mate to sneak in a hand between them. As always, Harryâs hands were warm against Dracoâs cold skin, even through his shirt. He sighed. âI canât believe itâs ten more weeks of this. I feel
He could hear Harry moving and felt fingers slip through his own. âLying here is fine as well,â Harry eventually whispered. âAre you comfortable?â
Mrs Weasley gave Draco a cup of tea and a chocolate cookie first. He knew that she was trying to comfort him, make it easier to talk.
âIâll bite you anytime,â Harry offered, âif thatâs â â
Harry panted a bit and buried his face in the crook of Dracoâs neck. âWeâre never going to be able to untangle if you keep doing that.â It sounded breathless and Draco made a content noise. âMaybe I donât want to untangle.â He moved back against Harry a little bit when he felt the knot soften. âMaybe I like it to be knotted.â
âSee that girl over there?â He pointed at Emma. âShe really want to have a go at it too.â
When he was done, the room felt oddly empty, and he leaned against the wall next to the door, assessing the room. Maybe heâd paint the walls blue. Maybe heâd add a carpet. The posters of the ground bed could go. He didnât want - or need - height in his nest. He needed easy access, and comfort.
A knee slid in between his legs and Draco spread them eagerly, leaning into his Alpha, pushing his face against Harryâs shoulder. âGood boy, good boyâ¦â Harry moved them a little more, until he more or less lay down, pillows in his back to support him as Draco lay draped across his body. âSpread your legsâ¦ Yesâ¦ like thatâ¦â
âAnd? Was your recruitment successful?â Severus asked as they arrived in the entrance hall.
Severusâ face was frozen in surprise for a second, before turning into a sneer, as his eyes flew back to Draco, then to Harry again.
demanded.
Harry arched up into him and he let out a moan. Wrenching his mouth away from Harryâs, Draco sucked in a deep breath and slid down, mouthing kisses along Harryâs torso as he went. He felt Harry shiver beneath his touch, which in turn sent molten heat down his own spine.
, your life might be in danger.â He tentatively reached out to Draco, brushing his fingertips along Dracoâs cheek. âI canât let anything happen to you,â he whispered.
âDraco? What is it?â he asked, slightly impatient.
âWhat the hell?â he muttered, confused.
me, Draco,
Harry paused at that. He had never thought about it like that. Usually, heâd just settled for distracting himself with whatever was available, rather than actively looking for something he wanted to focus on.
And then the second part escalated on me too, ending up at least double as long as planned, sooooo I split them up into two chapters.
âI know, cub. But youâll manage.â
âThank you,â Harry said, his relief at being rid of the horrendous thing overpowering his distrust of Mrs Malfoy momentarily.
Unfortunately, Dracoâs good mood began to falter during lunch when his apprehension of the impending confrontation with Harryâs friends returned in full force. As optimistic as he was trying to be about it, there was very little chance of this afternoon going over without at least one mishap, and Draco could only hope that it wouldnât be his fault.
âIâm sorry,â Harry apologised quietly.
I do hope the surrounding parts are sufficiently different to forgive that one verbatim quote.
âYou told him? What did he say?â Harry gasped, trying to hold back a cough. It was the first time heâd spoken to Severus since theyâd sat down for dinner.
âThat was before I knew you were
âFred and George showed us their flat,â replied Harry.
sanguis (lat.) = blood
âFuck, yes,
Harry gaped at her for a moment, then practically leapt out of his seat and hugged her tightly.
Severus nodded and let Lupin lead the way up to the fourth floor.
âWell done, Harry,â said Dumbledore. âYou have successfully entered my mind.â
She made an indignant sound, opening her mouth to respond when Ronâs hand came to rest on her arm, giving it a light squeeze.
âOf course, of course,â the goblin said with a small bow. âMay I have the gentlemenâs vault keys? Burgock can accompany you right away.â
The door opened and Blaise, Theo, Vince and Greg filed in. Draco forced himself to give them a polite nod, reminding himself that they wouldnât be able to read the messages even if they caught a glimpse. He focused back on his half-finished message.
With a shake of his head, Remus pushed the memories away and began warding his door. He had convinced Harry to go and take a bath, to unwind a little after the horrors of trying to heal Severus, by pointing out that he could smell the blood on his clothes. Still, he was fairly certain Harry would be back any minute. Once the wards were in place, Remus stripped out of his clothes and settled on a mattress on the floor, which heâd transfigured from an old armchair from downstairs, nibbling on a piece of chocolate.
Dracoâs bracelet pulsed against his wrist. He stopped dead in his tracks. Another pulse. A smile spread on his face and he tapped the silver chain to send a pulse in return. His carefully suppressed impatience surged through him all at once, and when he resumed his pacing his steps were far brisker than before.
âI can fix that,â said Harry, already lifting his hand to fling a locking and silencing charm at the door.
âFine,â he heard himself say.
Fact number three: He hated Snape. Or at least he used to hate Snape. Could hate vanish just like that, simply because he learnt that the man was his father? Heâd still treated him horribly the entire time theyâd known each other. And not just him, heâd bullied Hermione, too, not to mention that heâd managed to become Nevilleâs Boggart with his hostile attitude. There was barely any redeeming quality about him. And nevertheless, Harry suddenly had a hard time to call upon the familiar hatred he used to have for Snape.
âIâll miss you,â whispered Draco.
That brought a smile back to Harryâs face, and he nodded.
Harry laughed and shifted closer to Draco, pulling him against his chest. Despite his still raging embarrassment, Draco couldnât help but smile.
âThank you, Molly,â said Harry, his voice thick with emotion. âI really needed to hear that, I think. I was worried you wouldnâtâ Now that I theoretically have a father, I thoughtââ
âThat sounds intriguing indeed, how far along are you with the design?â he asked, turning slightly towards the twins as he joined the conversation. As George began to explain all their testing, Draco could finally relax a little. Maybe Harry was right and the twins would really just trust Harryâs judgement and play along, now that theyâd gotten over their initial shock of seeing him here. They didnât even seem to hold a grudge against him for getting them banned from Quidditch the previous year. As their exchange went on, Draco even found that they werenât just polite, they wereâ¦nice to him. Perhaps not all the Weasleys would hate the idea of him dating Harry.
Weasley said, sounding outraged. He mustâve followed Harry upstairs to talk to him. âHeâs bullied all of us for five years, how many times has he thrown hexes at you? Or slurs at Hermione?â
He broke off when Draco let out a short laugh.
âI wonât,â Severus asserted. âHeâs my son. Now that I know that he actually
They had certainly made quite a jump from their previous hesitancy. Oddly enough, it didnât feel like they had moved too fast, though. No, Harry was more than happy with last nightâs events, it was certainly a birthday heâd never forget. The day had been full of successes overall, now that he thought about it again.
âHis father tried to kill us exactly for that prophecy!â
âYou yelled at him, called him âboyâ like his disgusting relatives used to,â Draco snapped. âHe barely recognised me for a good five minutes, not breathing properly, before I finally got him to focus on me.â
returned with his requested bar of chocolate. When Draco demanded to know what the hell had taken Harry so long, he hadnât expected to hear that his mother had torn Severus a new one for his behaviour in the week prior, resulting in Harry and Severus finally sorting out their horrendous communication issues and realising that they both very much wanted to be a part of each otherâs life. He was pleased though. Heâd been increasingly worried about Harry since the day after his birthday.
âThe curse is contained, for now, but it will spread eventually. It will kill him with time. Thereâs nothing I can do.â
Draco looked at him in surprise, snapping his mouth shut. Severus resumed his pacing, mumbling to himself.
Remus replied in his head. He hoped that Harry knew that. Heâd have to show him better, erase any doubt Harry could ever have that Remus wouldnât give everything for him. He might have failed Lily, when he allowed her son to be raised by her cold-hearted sister, but he would not fail her again. He would not fail Sirius by letting his godson go unprotected. And most importantly, he would not fail Harry.
âWhat is it?â asked Hermione.
The bottle that was being passed around reached Draco and he poured himself a glass. It was an open secret that the Slytherins didnât much care for the no alcohol on school grounds rule, and Severus hadnât ever openly said or done anything to stop them. Draco wondered briefly whether the other houses did the same, or if their Head of House was truly favouring them that much to let them get away with it exclusively. Immediately, his thoughts went back to Harry. Was he also sitting with his friends, having a drink and catching up with each other up in Gryffindor tower? Was he thinking about him?
âSeverus?â Remus was watching him worriedly.
, but Harry adjusted within a heartbeat leaving only the feeling of soft lips and a searing tongue that kept moving around Dracoâs tip.
Minerva choked on her drink. Severus waited patiently for her to catch her breath, lightly pounding his hand on her back.
Harry continued to stir his potion until Slughorn clapped his hands and called, âTimeâs up, everyone stop stirring, please!â
Draco regarded his godfather for a moment. It was true. Severus
âI never expected you to,â said Harry. âItâd be nice if you could stop openly hoping for my relationship to fail, though.â His icy tone made Ron flinch a little.
âDo you care?â Draco countered, trying to suppress the little twinge of hurt in his chest at the idea that Harry didnât want anyone to see them together.
âLast night it was âdarlingâ,â Harry pointed out with a smirk.
After he got out of the dress robes and exited the fitting room again, he found his mother already at the register, ordering Harryâs clothes to be packed up and prepared for pickup, so she could summon Kreacher to take them back to Grimmauld Place. Harry was hovering behind her, fiddling with his coin pouch. He looked anxious, and it dawned on Draco that he was probably questioning whether he had retrieved enough gold for such a large purchase. Draco went over to him and put a hand on his shoulder, which made him flinch a bit.
âTake care, cub,â said Remus, then stepped away from the door to let others through.
Remus took a deep breath, then looked Severus straight in the eye. His amber eyes shone with an intensity that sent a shiver down Severusâ spine.
Even Remus mostly left him alone, and Harry was content to spend his time working, reading and continuously further exploring the house. In the process, he found several hidden roomsâtheir doors concealed behind bookshelves, portraits or fireplacesâincluding an even
Draco opened his mouth to ask what exactly heâd done, but Severus shook his head, speaking over him, âIâm sorry, I canât tell you more, Draco. I truly wish I could.â
âSeverus is injured, dining room,â was all Harry said before sending the stag off and turning his attention back to the table.
Poor Harry really never gets a break, does he? And Draco just canât help worrying, the poor little bean. Thank Merlin Narcissa is a fkn QUEEN and knows exactly how her son ticks.
âYouâre welcome,â she said with a smile, then got up, setting her wineglass down on the coffee table and turned to leave.
The silence that followed was blessed.
, he corrected himself. With eight Weasleys in the house, heâd have no choice but to resort to first names.
âGood evening, Harry. Please, have a seat,â replied Dumbledore, gesturing at a comfortable looking chair in front of his desk. âRight on time. Have you started well into the new term?â
Hermione looked rather incredulous and Harry felt weirdly tense as silence settled over the room.
Harry nodded, trying to ignore the spike of worry that flared in his chest again.
âDraco! Draco look, I did it!â Harry practically pounced on him, sweeping him up in a passionate kiss that was over as suddenly as it had begun, and eagerly pulled him over to the desk and pointed atâ¦two plain black notebooks? Draco gave him a confused look, then glanced down at the desk again. There was nothing else he could be pointing at.
Draco gave him an irritated glare, but his expression quickly morphed into one of delight. He jumped up excitedly and shrieked, âYou used it! Did it work? Did you like the smell? Is there anything youâd want to change?â
Harry relaxed and allowed himself to smile. âThank you, sir.â
Finally, Harry could muster a small smile. The grief he felt hadnât lessened in the least, but knowing that he wouldnât have to return to the Dursleys, that he could stay at Grimmauld Place with Remus instead, was almost a dream come true. It was enough to momentarily distract him, at least.
Harry conceded, resigned.
âOf course, of course. Well, as I mentioned back then, the group will need an adult supervisor. Now that you and Harry seem to be on good terms, I thought maybe you would want to take that position? It would barely be any effort, Harry appears to be quite competent as a teacherââ
I know it's been a
âListen,â Lupin began, âI know this is all a little overwhelming. Trust me, I know how you feel. Well, maybe not exactly, but parts of it. I have no idea how to be a father either, but I still want to be there for Harry. And Iâm terrified of fucking things up, of doing it all wrong, of disappointing him. Iâm guessing you are, too.â He sighed. âWhat Iâm trying to say is that I think itâs time we put all our history behind us for good and work together on figuring this out. For Harry.â
having them here. And Severusâ Weâre working on it, I guess.â
After a second of expectant silence, Ginny spoke up, âCan we help you?â
(See the end of the chapter for
He explained about the cupboard, about how theyâd lock him in there for days on end sometimes, without food. He told Draco how heâd generally never been allowed to eat what he wanted, even though he had been the one cooking the food most of the time, ever since he was still very little. He remembered how he had burned himself on the stove because he was too small to reach up properly.
Harry nodded, collecting himself. With a deep breath, he pushed himself out of Dracoâs arms. He pulled his knees against his chest, resting his chin on top, and tried to sort his thoughts, tried to figure out where to begin.
âI donât owe you any explanations,â Severus said coldly. âNow if you would kindly leave, I did not ask for your company.â
âHow the hell did they hear about that?â
âNo glamour, this is what I actually look like now,â said Harry, settling Hedwigâs cage on the seat closest to the door, before sitting down next to Luna just as the train started to roll out of the station. He glanced out of the window, but the crowd was too dense to spot Remus. âItâs a bit of a long story, tell me about your summer first.â
âHarry?â
âIâ We hated each other!â
âYou know as well as I do that weâll either forget or be too tired afterwards. And I donât want to have to keep it in mind, Iâd rather focus entirely on you when I strip you out of these clothes.â
he thought stubbornly, but his resolve was weakened as the memory of Lilyâs dead body flashed before his inner eye. No, he didnât just need to protect Harry. He also needed to prepare him for war.
know how. Thatâs why itâs difficult!â
They didnât do much for the rest of the evening, Harry keeping his head buried in a book Draco hadnât seen before. It appeared to be on charms. Not a subject Harry had seemed to be overly interested in so far, but Draco knew better than to question him about it when he was hyper-focused, which he obviously was. He barely took his eyes off the thing until Draco finally got up and declared that heâd be taking a showerâand even then, all he got was a quick peck before Harryâs attention went right back to whatever charm he was studying so intently.
The headmaster gave him a tired smile, before his eyes flickered to Severus, who had followed Harry downstairs.
âOh, er, sure. Iâll do that, too, then,â Potter replies, a bit flustered.
âShit, I gotta run. âDetentionâ and all that.â He gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek, swiping the textbook off the table and into his bag. âYouâll drop by?â
Again, anger bubbled up in Remus. What the hell had changed? Why the fuck had he retreated from them so suddenly? It made no
Immediately, the noise of Platform 9
âDo I have to?â
The familiar feeling of wolfish protectiveness rose in Remus, and he had to remind himself that it was nothing more than a possibility and there was no reason to snarl at anyone unless they actually did something wrong.
âI would assume they are here for the same reason that you are, McLaggen; to learn.â
âI donât have three galleons and seven sickles! Donât I get a family discount as your brother?â
Dracoâs attention snapped back to Pansy and he started a little.
His potion had turned paler than anyone elseâs by now, with the exception of Dracoâs which looked almost as perfect as Harryâs. Was he about to let Draco win the Felix Felicis just so he could inspect this book?
Remusâ eyes widened. He had figured that itâd be something Harry would want eventually, but he hadnât expected it to happen so suddenly, especially not so soon after Severusâ rather harsh rejection. He felt his anger abate, but it didnât disappear fully. Severus still owed him an explanation.
Admittedly, that idea still terrified him. The thought of opening himself up like that wasnât something Harry was particularly familiar or comfortable with. Heâd never had a family to open up to. Sure, the Weasleys, but there it had always been clear that he was an acquired family member, rather than an integral one. Somehow it just felt
This chapter is 100% dedicated to my best friend and personal hype-woman: Alex (aka. Thanks to
Theo shrugged. âIâm just saying it might be worth keeping an eye on. Weâre N.E.W.T. students now, and I personally donât want to lose out on a potential advantage just because it involves Potter. Whereâs your Slytherin spirit, Parkinson? Weâre supposed to be resourceful.â
âYes, sir.â
Harry excused himself as soon as he was done eating, eager to have another look at that potions book. Casting a Tempus he still had almost two full hours until his âdetentionâ with Severus, so he ducked into an empty classroom in a side-corridor and settled at the nearest table. He opened his bag to pull out the textbook, then hesitated as his gaze fell on the black journal.
Right. He still had to have a conversation with Harry, and suddenly that prospect didnât seem so bad in comparison to worrying about Severus. Putting his shirt back on, he got off the bed, carefully straightening out the rest of his clothes. Harry didnât need to know about him and Severus, not before theyâd actually discussed what was going on between them.
âThey better liked it,â growled Remus, closing his eyes as Harryâs magic soothed away the pounding in his head. âWhat spell was that?â
âSorry?! Youâ Iââ Draco spluttered, and Harry laughed.
to turn away and close his bedroom door behind him, which left Draco standing in his own doorway, alone.
Harry moanedâthe sound of it went straight to Dracoâs crotchâand ground his hips against Draco, creating delicious friction. Gods, how Draco wanted to rip away those infuriating layers of clothing between them so he could feel Harry for real. But they were in a bathroom on the bloody Hogwarts Express, surrounded by students who shouldnât find out about them.
âYes, yes, just show me how I do the imprint thing,â Draco waved him off.
spat Pansy.
Remus glanced over at Severus, and the both simultaneously gave a small nod.
Harry just shrugged and dismissed it with, âNothing new.â
Pansy apparently shared his disbelief and she bristled, âAre you serious? Itâs
By Tuesday afternoon, Harry was thrumming with tension. He was so antsy that Draco had thrown him out of Severusâ potions lab, where he was currently brewing some sort of lotion. Probably the secret behind his perpetually perfect hair. Feeling restless, he decided to join Narcissa instead, who had refurbished the library with new couches and a large mahogany desk with elegant chairs in the middle of the room, and was now in the process of replacing the wallpaper on the few bits of wallspace that were not covered in dark wooden bookshelves. She smiled at him as he entered, shuffling to the side a little so he could stand next to her, facing the to-be-renovated wall.
âWell, who do you think he resembles then?â he quipped, trying to keep his tone light.
âBecause they have âproven themselves trustworthyâ apparently. Fortunately, Dumbledore only directly prohibited me from telling Severus, because the risk of Voldemort breaking his mental shields and seeing things he shouldnât is too great. So, since he implied that exceptions can be made for trustworthy people, I am making an exception for you.â
Narrowing his eyes suspiciously, Harry searched Remusâ face for a hint at what had caused their reaction, but found nothing. With a deep breath, he turned back to Snape.
He summoned the second box from the shelf, opened it swiftly, and showed it to Harry. Inside was a silver bracelet; metal woven like rope, a solid piece of silver with intricate carvings encasing the middle, and a smaller tube of silver hiding the clasp on the other side of it. It was a perfect match for the one heâd given to Harry, the only difference between them being that the pattern was mirrored, and Harryâs was pale gold instead of silver. Harry watched him wide-eyed as he took the silver one out of its box and fastened it around his own wrist.
âNo,â Harry shook his head. âHe doesnât want me, Narcissa. What would even be the point?â
âYeah, so, my mother put some charms on me that made me look like my dad. I mean like James. Theyâre gone now, soââ He trailed off, unsure what else there was to say.
âI beg to differ, my dear Severus, it is a rather splendid idea,â Albus insisted, staying infuriatingly calm. âWith Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban, you are Voldemortâs closest advisor, but his trust in you is not as deep as it should be. Once I am gone, Voldemort will undoubtedly try to take over Hogwarts. I need you there to protect the students.â
Grumbling, he got out of bed and went to take a shower. A very long, hot shower.
he thought grimly, for once wishing the other man was using his damned Legilimency on him.
Alright my friends, here we go, back to Hogwarts!
studied healing?â Harry asked incredulously. Severus nodded.
âYes, Dad, I know,â Harry sighed, rolling his eyes dramatically.
âHermione said theyâd be coming a little after lunch, so Iâm guessing around two oâclock?â Harry replied with the tiniest smile.
âWe donât know, Harry. He could be.â
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a rolled up parchment, holding it out to Remus, who took it carefully.
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes, earning himself another glare from Harry. Just what was going on between those two?
âAs if Dumbledore could read your mind in the first place,â Harry added, rolling his eyes.
âWell, then I suggest you go visit them,â Draco drawled.
âRaven,â echoed Severus, as if testing the name on his tongue. âI suppose I can live with that. Though I hate that it is necessary in the first place.â
âIâll have you know that Iâm a terrible actor, but Iâll try my best.â
The energy between them changed in a heartbeat, and Severus felt his whole body tense in anticipation as Remus came to stand above him. He leaned down, one hand on Severusâ jaw, his lips hovering close enough before Severusâ that they were breathing the same air. The tension mounted until it became unbearable and Severus closed the distance.
His mother laughed, shook her head and motioned to the seamstress to carry on. Draco stared at her in disbelief. His mother would
âJust make sure sheâs warm,â Harry repeated for the fourth time, handing Severus the basket. âIâll pick her up as soon as I can and bring her to Gryffindor tower, promise, but until then she needsââ
Harry chuckled, âHermione would disagree with you, she was appalled.â
As he was trying to convince himself of it, Draco began to stir sleepily, effectively drawing Harryâs attention away from the Severus-issue.
Harry hummed in understanding, playing with Dracoâs fingers.
âAre you suggesting a friendship but with sex type of thing?â he asked, mildly surprised.
As always thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!
She smiled at him. Not like sheâd smiled at Walburga, but a wide, warm smile Harry hadnât even thought her capable of. He found himself smiling back.
With typical Malfoy elegance, he got to his feet and shuffled through the potions scattered across the edge of the table, before returning with a small green vial.
More than once heâd shied away from the glorious friction Dracoâs body couldâve provided against his hardness, simply because he knew that it would ultimately lead to stripping his shirt. But the worry of Draco eventually being fed up with his hesitancy was growing with every day.
Ron shot him a glare. âI still canât believe you let McGonagall bully me into continuing Potions just because Slughornâs standards are lower than Snapeâs.â
. His jaw was clenched, eyes blazing like fire and his lips drawn together into a tight line. He looked downright dangerous. Better than fear, Severus supposed.
wasâand moved back the tiniest bit before suddenly taking Draco deeper into his mouth, making him gasp in surprise. He took him deeper until Draco felt him shudder, then moved back a little and sucked. If Harryâs arm hadnât pinned him to the wall, Dracoâs knees wouldâve buckled and he wouldâve collapsed then. A loud groan escaped Dracoâs throat, but he was too far gone by now to even care. He felt Harry smile again for just a moment, before moving back and sucking him down again.
, like Episkey for example.â He tried his hardest not to sound irritated at Hermioneâs constant questioning of his judgement, but his success was mediocre.
âActual gift? Draco, how is this not an actual gift?!â Harry exclaimed.
He closed his eyes, letting Albusâ words sink in. It could help him protect Harry.
âYes, I have. I gave him my report about the Death Eater meeting,â Severus responded.
âYes, well done,â agreed Severus.
Oh boy, thereâs the D-word.
Snape snorted at that, earning a raised eyebrow from Harry. Narcissa was visibly relieved and began thanking Harry repeatedly, causing him to blush a little.
Draco had died inside of Hogwarts. Could his ghost have been in the maze, as it was located on the Quidditch pitch?
"Goddamn fucking Ministry and its anti-Apparition wards... Seriously, I should be able to zap out of this place in the case of emergency...Absolute fucking OSHA violation, fuck this stupid country and its backwards ass approach to everything..."
Harry finally stood up at the reminder of everyone stood around him, and Draco automatically left Cassie's side to help him up. Harry couldn't help but beam at the other boy.
"It's about Draco." Lucius swallowed thickly. "The Dark Lord has requested he be brought here..."
Harry did not see Draco again that day until he was leaving dinner. Hermione had at least shown up, but had been occupied by Ron asking a million questions about his Potions essay. Thankfully, he was able to get over his slight irritation quite quickly, it wouldn't be fair to Ron after the conversation they'd had earlier about Harry dedicating all his time to Draco.
In total, there were five of them: Draco, Cassie, Corey, Jessica, and Andrew. It was his first time ever fully immersed with others just like him; that had an answer for his endless questions and curiosities. He hadn't even known that he was a Nightingale. Hadn't known how that made him any different from any other siren out there. He had come in with only the knowledge that he was a siren, and that his body would soon transform to reflect that.
Draco screamed as Andrew dug his claws into his shoulder, but he had successfully been restrained by the other two. They were all in their siren form, but Harry had only now just noticed the full transition. In all honesty, he could see why they had been designated as Beasts and not Beings.
They had a few hours until the Tournament, which gave them plenty of time to acquaint themselves with the hazards residing within the maze. As expected, there were many magical creatures; a blast-ended skrewt, a boggart, and so on and so forth. They had a lovely conversation with a sphinx that lasted over an hour when they began to hear chatter and music coming from outside. They said their goodbyes, and Draco made sure his hood was in place one final time.
A tear rolled down Cassie's cheek, hitting the floor with the faintest of sounds. Drip.
They had kissed. Harry had kissed Draco.
Snape had a wordless conversation with Dumbledore, and both promptly left for the hall, but not before Draco could watch the kooky old man send Cassiopeia a sly wink of approval. Subtlety really was a dying art form.
He stared at her like she was the one with the empty skull. "Do you actually think he could be behind this?"
Draco shuffled over, desperate for anything that would cure his trembling nerves. An arm tucked itself around his shoulders, the weight a reassuring presence to his fraught mind.
Despite not seeing anyone, he knew Draco had been the one to pull him from the cemetery. He'd told Harry himself! That he wouldn't 'let him die back there.'
"I never thought that this was how we'd go out. Never thought I'd go feral and that'd be the end of it," Cassie admitted, "Always thought it'd be with Andrew at my side."
He had looked more corporeal than the ghosts of his parents. Had felt solid under his hands, soft as they kissed. He'd looked
Granger perked right up, eager to discuss the assignment. Leave it to Cass to save the mood. After that, it was easy for Draco to get into the discussion, enjoying the mirth that Granger's intelligence brought to the table. They quickly moved on from Potions to Transfiguration, and then somehow got onto Xylomancy, which was the last thing Draco wanted to hear about.
Oh. He was in pain. Yes, that seemed accurate.
"I was wondering if you'd like to go with me, on a swim, to the Northern Reef?" Draco asked, Corey's smirk turning into a smile.
Harry couldn't accept that as an answer. "Sir, if Draco really was a siren like his mum, wouldn't he want to go into hiding if Voldemort was hunting sirens?"
TW: violence, blood
Harry would have otherwise struggled with this conversation, had he not spent the entire summer discussing this very topic with both Padfoot and Moony. However, he had preemptively decided to keep quiet should it come up on the train, as he loathed getting into it with Hermione. She was brilliant, mind you, but had a way of making you feel like you knew absolutely nothing at all.
There was no need for Lucius to know he had already briefed Dumbledore and Minerva, had the entirety of the sirens at Hogwarts briefed and ready to lie at a moment's notice. Not yet.
Ron kept glancing between the two of them and the exit, likely wishing he'd gone to breakfast instead of staying back with them in the common room.
She rubbed circles into his back, shushing him. "The dance isn't going anywhere. Breathe with me, alright?"
Draco nodded, hoping that the buzzing of his nerves wasn't as evident as he felt they were in that moment.
Potter looked like someone had knocked over his morning porridge, the utter confusion on his face most pitiful. McGonagall then stormed out of the room, likely wishing to claim credulity to the aftermath of her suggestion.
Umbridge blabbed on about classwork and whatnot, and Draco zoned out to stare out into the lake. If all his classwork was to be done in here, then he was never going to get anything done. They would have been better off facing the desks away from the windows.
Harry tensed for a whole millisecond, barely noticeable if you weren't looking for it, his chest constricting as his breathing ceased until Harry caught himself and tried to brush off the reaction.
Voldemort.
The old man stepped closer, attempting to look down upon her despite her height. "Cassiopeia, do you have a even modicum of respect for your elders?"
Cassie's talons had extended, their sharp ends dripping with blood glistening in the morning light. As Aegeus began wailing, clutching at his bleeding cheek and thrashing about on the floor, she made no move to retract the offensive weapons. She stood over her victim with a grim tightness to her face, pinched from the aftermath of her actions.
The Dark Lord sighed, like it was a mere inconvenience. "What about your son, then? It shouldn't be too hard to get him here."
"So you've cursed her to die if she writes anything about the Malfoy name?" he hissed at her.
It'd been a long time since Draco had truly rested.
Draco sighed, "Andy, don't blame him for not being able to control her, you're the only one able to even sway her decisions."
"I'll be okay, stop stressing so much, Dad."
If she was sure of herself, they'd both live. Easy as that.
There was blood splattered on the older siren's face, but it washed away as he dove under the surface and reappeared a foot away from Draco.
"Promise you won't forget to write," Sirius reminded him for the twentieth time since they had left for the platform.
The four bodies were taken straight to the sea, but Draco wasn't there to witness it. He had been sat on the couch in the sitting room as Andrew spoke to Jess and Corey in a hushed voice. Tea had been shoved into his hands, and he drank it obligingly, like it was the only action his limbs were capable of executing at the moment.
"Professor Snape, I did not realize you had a child." Umbridge approached with a cautious tone, treading on eggshells in her inquiry.
"You're what?!" Harry stood, but had to catch himself with the wall as the blood rushed from his head. "You can't go after Cassie!"
This was how they were going to defeat Voldemort. This is what the prophecy had meant all along. The exact thing they were trying to avoid, to protect themselves against, they had gone ahead and served it to
Instead, he realized how messy his life had become. Things used to be so simple. Why couldn't they just stay simple?
Snape tucked a kiss onto the top of her head, stopping them both. Hermione had to strain her ears to hear their conversation.
He found that he could barely look away, the rest of the room drab and pitiful, the crackling fire place and its orange glow no longer the most lively entity in his presence.
He took a step back from her, just in case. "I don't understand why you're trying to defend him!"
"Draco was at St. Mungo's, which you would know if he considered you people of importance in his life. However, you clearly are not, and it is blatantly rude to go and invade someone's privacy like this. I mean, stalking him? Do you really have no dignity left? My cousin already has to deal with chronic illness, the last thing he needs is you mutts breathing down his neck at every turn."
"But-"
Narcissa turned to level a glare at the spot where he was hidden with Harry underneath the invisibility cloak. "What cannot be seen, must not be heard."
After term had ended, Mother had taken him to the American state of Washington, a rainy place thick with endless forests. He had known about this trip since the Christmas break, and honestly, had been filled with a looming sense of dread leading up to it.
He failed to conceal his smirk. Someone from the table over coughed to cover a laugh.
"YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT?" he yelled, nausea be damned.
Draco's suspicions regarding Mad-Eye Moody quickly turned into paranoia. Defense Against the Dark Arts suddenly having a lesson on Sirens? Despite starting with the three Unforgiveables, completely unrelated to magical creatures? Quite the turnaround.
"It is unfair what I asked of you. It's better this way. You may not see it now, but you will. I know I have not always been the greatest father, but I have loved you more dearly than anyone else in my entire life, and I will love you even after I'm gone. Andrew, he'll-" he choked back a cry, "he'll be there for you better than I ever could. If your mother could see you two now, she'd be so proud. You're too good for this world, and what it asks of you is unjust. But you cannot follow me in my missteps, and I'll be damned if you get caught up as I try to right my wrongs. I'm so sorry, my little star.
by his parents. A bit further down a more recent one, of Cassie and him dancing at the Yule Ball. The article itself was uneventful, as his 'illness' wasn't new to anyone. The only sentence of interest to him was the speculation that "Lord Malfoy is to name Lady Cassiopeia Prince the new Heir, potentially through post-humorous marriage."
Draco had heard enough. The decision had been made for him before he had even been conceived. This meeting was a formality; you would be foolish to think otherwise. Come tomorrow, he'd be shipped off to Hogwarts, no matter how he felt. He had no say, and never would.
He rolled his eyes. "Potter's really not the brightest. It's a miracle he doesn't get lost on the way to his dormitory every day. And, we've already been over this. I'm trying to avoid causing a stir with him this year. It's not worth the risks."
anyways, hope y'all enjoyed this tiny update, this has been itching in the back of my brain for weeks now so I made the executive decision to kick it out
Severus, for whatever reason, looked ready to smack Harry upside the head. Draco had an inkling he would feel similarly in a few moments.
"You were seen by someone?" Cassie practically screamed at him, and he shrunk into himself.
Snape straightened from where he sat at the end of the bed, one hand resting atop of Cassie's blanketed leg, like it was the only thing anchoring him to the moment.

"Reverse the spell!" someone shouted at Umbridge. "You're going to kill him!"
Potter seemed unfazed at his silence. "How've you been? I, uh, had a question I needed to ask you..."
Aegeus nodded in thought, hands pressed together, fingertips pressing in to the cusp of his chin. "Two Nightingales will play a part in the downfall of the Great Evil. The question is, which ones?"

Despite it being the most awful conversation he had ever had to have in his entire life, talking to Corey was easy once he got the ball rolling. Returning the agate had lifted most of the weight from his shoulders.Â However, it was almost frustrating how well Corey took it, even with the clear sadness in his eyes.
"Get with the times, Drew, the Yankee vocabulary is too crude on sensitive Brit ears," Cassie replied.

Andrew looked like he was going to have an aneurysm. Perhaps he was already beginning to have one, given the never-ending circle this conversation had been following for the past twenty minutes.
