She chuckled darkly, “no, I suppose you couldn’t, although I’d have paid good money to see that.” She raised her glass and they clinked, both drinking deeply. “So, what, you’re friends now?”
Harry gaped at him, realization dawning, free hand flown up to cover his open mouth.
Ron laughed, “Alright. That’s—I know I mess the two of you about a lot, but—you’re a good friend, Harry.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry interrupted. “I see I’ve been a bit of an arse.”
“Fuck, Draco, please—" Harry panted, writhing under Draco’s unforgiving grip, “
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who’s sending you a memo at this time of night?”
Harry dipped his head, dropping his gaze down, “Fuck, ok yeah, I— I used to think, if I came in here and got you worked up enough, you might—” he broke off, arching his back and bearing down, “
“Yeah, I want you to show me around, I want to see all the places you used to go, and I mean, I know we’ve seen all the bands before, but I thought it would be cool, you know, to go to Warped Tour, see it where you first discovered all this stuff. And oh, if you look, the departure portkey from San Francisco, it’s two weeks later; I thought we could bring the bike and drive up the coast, I heard that’s really nice, and I mean, we can change the dates if you don’t want— I just—"
Draco considered whether he should return the compliment—he did his fair share of ogling Harry, after all—but Harry seemed like he was on a roll and when Draco opened his mouth the only thing that came out was a rough, high-pitched whine.
Harry awoke in his bed, still dark, the first fingers of dawn creeping over the horizon. He was sprawled out over Draco, a leg and an arm thrown possessively across his body. He raised his head up slightly, watched the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest. Lifting his arm, he trailed his fingertips over the hawthorn branches inked under Draco’s collarbone, the runes stacked on his sternum. They’d slept together, here, last night. He brought his fingers up to Draco’s slack mouth, touched his parted lips, the soft skin high on his cheekbone, the blue lid of his eye. Draco stirred, mumbled an indistinct noise, turned toward him.
Neville snickered, swaying in his seat as Greg passed the blunt back to him.
Draco’s chuckle cut him off, “Were you going to apologize for waking me up with your sex noises? Or should I apologize for humping you in my sleep?”
He was fresh out of the showers, wearing a clean kit. Draco swallowed and gestured with his scotch, “I’ve got my own party right here, thanks.” He had stuck around in the lounge just long enough to clink glasses with the executive team and clap Wood on the back for a job well done. By this time, he knew exactly how long Potter took in the showers and had departed the festivities just in time.
Draco couldn’t respond. He couldn’t move. Harry said, “I mean it. I meant everything I said. I hate— I hate that shit, telling everyone my business, but I thought it might— I don’t care if they know. I want everyone to know about you,” he moved even closer, their chests barely touching, “I want you,” he whispered, and Draco closed his eyes. “Can I?”
Every year during the last weekend of August, an unremarkable collection of fields in Berkshire transformed into the site of Reading Festival. The biggest names in rock music played across multiple stages, rain or shine, the often-muddy grounds crowded with tens of thousands of wellington boot-wearing, inebriated, unwashed revelers. Harry and Draco were always among them. Trekking out to Little John’s Farm, they’d set up camp at the side of the field, pitching the small muggle tent Harry had enchanted with wizarding space. It wasn’t luxurious, but there was room enough inside to stand up and stretch, for both of them to fit comfortably with their sleeping bags laid out, stinking clothes piled in a heap by the entrance and a fireproof teakettle in one corner.
Inside the building was close, and dark, and the ceiling was lower than Harry expected. He wasn’t sure what he had expected, really, but certainly something larger? They’d walked down a short, cramped staircase and emerged at the back of a poorly lit room, with a grimy bar on one side and a stage at the front. The floor in front of the stage was sunken into a shallow pit, fenced in on the sides and filled with scrappy looking kids around Harry’s age—most of them, he noted with satisfaction, wearing black. They stood there for a moment, Malfoy stiff and Harry unsure, hands in their pockets.
“No,” Harry snorted, shaking his head. “No, it’s—” he sighed, “It’s nothing.”
Draco everything. And Draco let him, went slack in his grip and looked up at him, wide-eyed and whimpering.
Harry kissed him. “I know,” he grinned. “Do you think we can keep it that way?”
Harry nodded.
? No compliments on my,” he licked his lips, “performance, today?”
Draco sucked in a deep breath. “Anyways,” he huffed it out, “That’s what I did with you. It wasn’t even hard, really, nothing like stopping myself from thinking disloyal thoughts about Voldemort while he lived in my house,” he let out a strained chuckle. “It was more like… I knew our friendship was good. And I was content with that, really. It wasn’t worth doing anything to risk it. I didn’t even want to
Harry tore into the sandwich, making an uninhibited noise of blissful gratitude at the hot pastrami, the spicy mustard and the chewy rye bread. Ron was going through a bit of a deli phase—he’d started curing his own meats and pickling various vegetables—Harry had no complaints.
Harry dropped to his knees, took Draco’s hands, tears in his eyes. “You fucking lunatic, I can’t believe you—of course I’ll marry you.”
“Of course you didn’t,” Harry said brusquely, “because I didn’t tell you. I was afraid to tell you. He called me a coward, just now at the bar. I’ve fucked up everything haven’t I?” He looked desperately at Hermione.  She reached across the table gently and took his hands in hers.
“All right then! I think that’s enough catching up for one day. Why don’t you get situated at your desk—” he gestured into the corner at a small, rickety thing, “And I’ll brief you on what we’ll be handling this week.”
The smile splitting Draco’s face was contagious; Harry couldn’t help mirroring it, and he wanted to say more, tell Draco everything he had been thinking about the trip and all the reasons he was excited for them to go together,
“Yep.”
Harry grimaced. Ear protective charms were surprisingly finicky, at least if you wanted to get good sound quality through them. Luckily, they were standard for Cursebreakers (and had been in Auror training too) for jobs likely to involve explosions or background auditory interference, so he had gotten pretty good at them by now.
yes,” Draco nodded, biting his lip.
, and you think it was all some elaborate practical fucking
Draco hummed questioningly, nuzzling below his ear, breath hot and tingling down his neck.
The street sign they take a picture of, Ocean Avenue, is actually a main street in the town Carmel-By-the-Sea! It's referenced in the song 'Ocean Avenue' by Yellowcard. (The hat shop and the Cottage of Sweets are also real stores in Carmel)
,” he hissed, and then he felt the low reverberation of a moan from the back of Potter’s throat, and Potter closed his lips around Draco’s fingers and
Potter grinned, stuck out his hand, “Shake on it?”
Draco cupped Potter’s face in his hands and gently tilted his chin up, brushing their lips together.
Harry nodded, still shaking and hiccoughing.
But on his way out, as he was passing a rather noisy group in the break room, he noticed the closed office door directly opposite (bit of a shitty spot for an office, right across from the break room, no wonder the door was closed) and through the window, a flash of pale blond hair. Malfoy’s office. Harry knocked. The door clicked open in front of him right away; Malfoy must have opened it without even looking up to see who it was, as he continued scratching numbers onto a scroll of complicated looking equations while Harry stood frozen in the doorway. After a moment, Malfoy looked up expectantly, surprise flashing across his face before he schooled his features and cleared his throat. “Potter. Can I help you?”
Harry groaned, poking his fork in Ron’s direction, “Fine, alright, you can give me a hard time about it for two minutes while I eat.”
Finally, we’ve made it to the chapter named after the prompt song! Chapter title taken from 'It Had to Be You' by Motion City Soundtrack
Malfoy just kept looking at him, still and somehow fragile as Harry ran the tips of his fingers across Malfoy’s shoulders, down the center line of his torso, over the flaring of his ribs. Then he was questing back up, up onto the skin of Malfoy’s neck, and that was soft too, Malfoy’s eyes fluttering closed as Harry’s fingers pressed in, swept around and tangled in the hair at the base of Malfoy’s scalp.
Draco chuckled. “You, of course—” He blanched, blushing, “I mean, I think it would be like what we have, except... romantic?”
“She was twenty! And she looked like Haley Williams!”
The man smiled in a self-effacing way, circling around to Draco’s bedside and extending his hand, “Well, I can’t be the judge of how lucky you are, but yes, my name is Healer Andrade and I’ll be taking care of you, Mr. Malfoy.”
Potter laughed ruefully and Draco felt suddenly vindictive. He knew this was what Potter deserved—a big strong quidditch star with a kind smile and an easy rapport with the rest of Potter’s friends, the type of relationship the wizarding world would fawn over. “I’m surprised I haven’t seen you two in the papers yet,” he slurred snidely.
Harry arched up the bed, crying out, collapsing back onto the mattress as Draco kept riding him through the aftershocks, fisting his own cock and coming all over Harry’s stomach as he glared down at him, milking the last out of Harry until he was shaking his head and moaning, quiet and pained from overstimulation.
“Mmm,” Harry caught his mouth, murmured into it, “So are you. You love it. And you love me,” he kissed Draco again, “So much.”
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, savoring the prickling heat spreading down his spine. Then he smiled, predatory, sharklike.  “You like my buttons, do you?”
“I’m very glad you two are so sexually compatible. Do you think José is the one, then?”
Later, alone in bed, stroking Cassie in a despondent sort of way, he let himself wallow in the knowledge that Draco hadn’t ever taken a boyfriend on a double date with Ron and Hermione (although it had been years since he had a boyfriend at all, anyways). And then, sinking further into self-pity, he thought about how, before now, the four of them always went out together. Harry and Draco, Ron and Hermione. Was Draco replacing him? He was taking José as his wedding date now; he wouldn’t be going with Harry, like they’d assumed before. Harry allowed himself a moment to bury his face in the pillow and mourn the loss of Draco sitting by his side at the Weasley family table. What was he going to do, like Hermione said, when Draco left him and moved out of Grimmauld to have a life with someone else? He had laughed it off, before, but maybe Draco really would do it—leave Harry alone in this big, empty house, a sad old cat lady. Harry fisted his hands in the bedsheets and tried to calm down. He wasn’t being fair. He should be happy for Draco. This was what they wanted, yeah? And he wanted Draco to have everything he wanted. He took a few deep breaths. Draco wasn’t replacing him; he was being irrational. It was far too early to think about moving out, anyways. And didn’t they still work together, and go flying together, and go to shows together? In fact, Harry reminded himself, he and Draco were going to see My Chemical Romance, the Black Parade tour at Wembley Arena, the following Friday. They had been looking forward to it for months, and Harry reassured himself that he didn’t need to be feeling left out; Draco wasn’t going anywhere.
Potter was standing in the doorway, and he was laughing. Bowled over with his hands on his knees, heaving in great, gasping breaths, his eyes bright and crinkling. Draco pulled out his wand.
“Yeah,” Ron groaned, “I wished you’d shag, you know, in private?”
Potter flushed and ran a hand through his hair. “Ah, just a couple of weeks? I ran into him at the Puddlemere after party that weekend when they stomped on the Cannons.”
“I just...” Harry giggled again, “didn’t expect it to be so easy.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron groaned, “Would you two just snog properly already?”
, so this morning it was just Ron, Hermione, and Blaise. Harry couldn’t argue with the logic—José was sure to get along with Hermione, as they were both wicked smart, and Blaise, as they were both incredibly posh.
Draco felt it in the back of his neck first—the icy sting of dread, working its way down his spine and twisting his gut. He took a deep, steady breath. “Alright?”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed. “And, why, exactly, would you do that?”
“Good morning?”
“Harry,” Draco began, “We’re no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I.”
In the wake of his late-night indiscretion, Harry examined his newfound lust closely. It had taken him by surprise. He had thought all the familiarity between he and Draco would stand in the way, that desire could only be discovered fresh and new—that quick flash of want when you catch someone’s eye for the first time. He had thought that love grew from passion, and not the other way around. But that wasn’t what he had ever wanted, was it? Harry had wanted to be known. He had thought it wasn’t possible; Draco hadn’t either. They understood, intuitively, the impossibility of being known by a lover—being really and truly seen by someone who honestly understood all the fucked up shit and didn’t shy away from it. No one was willing or able to go through that for them. And probably no one would, they had been right about that.
“I think—and hear me out on this, I know mum’s going to disagree—but I think we would be better off loading up on the cocktail hour and having a bit less for dinner.”
“Honestly, I’d thought the universe would be a little less cliché, but whatever works, I suppose,” he shrugged, leaning against the foot of Draco’s hospital bed.
He and Potter had been shagging for a couple of months now. They hadn’t talked about what they were doing, exactly, and Draco had no idea whether Potter was seeing other people, but Draco certainly hadn’t had the time nor the inclination to sleep with anyone else since Conference Room 12F. And recently, Potter had started asking him to do things other than sex, things like proofreading his speech for the upcoming fundraising Gala for the Ministry Summer Quidditch Camp. Obviously, they were going to fuck after they finished with the speech, but still, if Potter had only wanted sex from Draco, he could have practiced the speech with Hermione and then asked Draco over afterwards. But he didn’t.
This train of thought was interrupted by a loudly clearing throat on his left. He started, realizing that Theodore Nott had been standing beside Draco the whole time, dressed in a flaring black trench coat with a high collar and frameless dark sunglasses in an angular oval shape. Harry recognized him as the main character in a muggle movie franchise that had been big that year.
“Ah. Well, I could go to a wizarding spot, but I tend not to be interested in the men that are interested in me.”
He rocked his hips, pulling his face back to look Draco in the eyes, growling, “I
Harry shook his head firmly, “Oh no, I’ve got you in my house and I’m not letting you go until January, at least.”
“He thought I was funny.” Draco was practically radiating smugness.
“I like you like this, all spread out,” Draco trailed a finger along Harry’s collarbone and down his sternum, over the ridges of his abdominals, through the trail of dark hair leading down from his navel. “Look at you,” he murmured, circling his thumb around the head of Harry’s cock, and dragging it through the slit, “You’re so wet for me.” Harry flushed and whimpered, his hips jerking forward, rutting into the wet patch on Draco’s shirt. Draco watched as another drop of precome welled up, “You’re leaking all over,” he continued, pressing his thumb in again, eliciting a stuttered whine from Harry, “This is quite a nice shirt and you’re absolutely ruining it.” Harry gasped and stiffened, rolling his hips back, panting, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t— I—”
“My god, this is horrifying,” Draco shuddered, stage-whispering to Harry, “Should we have a quick shag now just to nip this in the bud? I’ll let you top?”
Only, they’d done it platonically, and now Harry was wondering whether he might want from Draco what he had been looking for all this time, what he had thought he could never have. He was quite sure he did want it, in fact, although the thought still made his stomach clench.
Draco’s hand was there on his face, fingers resting gently against his cheekbone, warm palm cradling his jaw. He knew the feeling of Draco’s touch. But now it flayed him, drew the strength from his joints. He shivered. Draco hummed contentedly, wrapping his other hand around Harry’s waist. Steady, he held Harry close, swaying slightly. And Harry, for all his worrying, hadn’t expected that it would feel so… safe. That it would feel how it always felt, stepping into Draco’s arms like sinking into a warm bath. And he really must be an idiot because he’d thought it would feel like jumping off a cliff. A small burble of laughter escaped his throat, and Draco pulled back, smiling, slipping off Harry’s glasses and setting them on the table, “What is it?”
, he was stupid about it too, but he couldn’t get the words out, so he just stood there gaping in a highly undignified manner.
Draco was silent for a moment. Harry looked up at him to see his eyes were closed. “Can you?” He asked finally, and Harry was surprised to hear his voice choked with fear. “What if— what if you can’t feel that for me?”
Draco snorted, stepping into the shower.
On their last night in Big Sur they ordered room service,
“Seamus, we’ve been dating since October, what do you think?” Harry countered.
Draco looked alarmed. “On call? But… you’re all drunk?”
“Look!” Luna’s voice cut across the moment, high and clear, “A star shower!” Twelve heads turned skyward,
“I don’t really listen to music much, just like, whatever’s on at the bar?”
“Do you know,” he handed the flute back to Harry, snaking a hand around his waist.
“What are you staring at?”
“Well there you have it,” Hermione said with a grin, “Ron’s walked us through your options and it looks like you’ve got no reason to keep quiet.”
“That’s so fucking good.”
of his mouth, the slight furrow in his brow. It made him weak to see Draco like that; his muscles shivered, threatened to give out, but he kept moving, rolling his hips slow and languid, bending to press his lips to the center of Draco’s forehead, just over the wrinkle he had put there.

Draco laughed too, slightly hysterically. “Ok Pans, what do I do now?”
“Yeah, that’s right,” Draco gritted out, clenching tight around him and

Potter spluttered. Draco leaned in. “You
“Harry James Potter!” Hermione sat forward in her chair, “who was it and why didn’t you tell us?” she cried reproachfully.
“Will do.”
“Ten!” Pansy and Ginny had started up the count, “Nine! Eight!”
Harry smoothed his fingers down Draco’s hairline, tucked some strands behind Draco’s ear, settled his palm on the side of Draco’s throat. He leaned in, panting hot against Draco’s mouth, and kissed him. Draco whimpered into it, and felt himself flush. He wasn’t quite used to the tenderness, yet. They

Draco shuddered, “Yes, but I didn’t like it.”
Harry whimpered, and Draco made a low, approving noise, and that was it, he was coming in his pants rutting against Draco's thigh like an overeager, fumbling teenager. Desperate and laid bare, even more than he had feared. As he panted into the damp spot on Draco’s shirt—Merlin, had he drooled on Draco’s shirt?—he found he didn’t mind, wasn’t embarrassed at all, actually. Draco was still talking, muttering softly as he worked the buttons open on his trousers, reaching under Harry’s waistband and getting his hand slick—Harry’s eyes snapped open. Fuck, Draco was touching himself, and his voice was still in Harry’s ear, saying, “God, Harry, that was so hot…” And then he was spilling over his hand, over the front of Harry’s joggers, and every last trace of fear was driven from Harry’s mind. He sucked in a deep breath, trying to clear his head.
Thanks so much for sticking with this heaping dose of silly nostalgia :)
Harry had looked up at him silently, jaw set tight. Draco reached out, wrapping his fingers around Harry’s and shifting off the wall to knock their shoulder together, drawing Harry back with him.
Malfoy looked down at the countertop, his mouth quirking to the side, “Would you mind? Or at least, if you can’t stay, could you report back to me what you think? I haven’t sold these yet, I’ve only tried one last night—”
“What’s up with you tonight? You seem a bit… tense.”
Draco took two steps back.
“Bastards,” Harry chuckled, nosing against the top of Draco’s head, “Lucky we’ve gotten so good at ignoring them.”
Bonus points if you read Draco saying “I self-medicate with drugs and alcohol” in Max Bemis' voice from the Say Anything song 'Admit It!!!'
?” They were curled up across from each other on Draco’s sofa; he’d flooed her to come over immediately as soon as he’d gotten home from work.
about it, and something in him shied away from that prospect, the same thing that made his stomach twist sometimes when he looked at Malfoy or remembered something from that night. It felt like guilt, but also fear—the instinct to avoid examining too closely what had happened that night, and how he felt about it.
It wasn’t exactly normal, Harry knew, how much more he felt about Draco. The intensity of it scared him sometimes; his chest got tight with a thumping mix of fear and excitement and joy. But that didn’t mean they should
They ate Christmas Eve dinner in the kitchen. Harry cooked again; Draco mostly drank wine and watched him. Over a truly delectable seafood pasta, Harry nervously asked Draco whether he might like to go to his aunt Andromeda’s for breakfast the next morning. It was easy to beg off the Weasleys, but Teddy, being a small child, hadn’t taken the news of Harry’s possible absence with as much grace. Draco felt a tight clench in his chest. He had met Andromeda a few times after the war, but their relationship, if it could even be called that, was a tenuous one. He’d wanted more, wanted to know this part of his family that wasn’t poison, but he didn’t want to push her—she had lost so much. He responded haltingly, stammering, and Harry reassured him that he had told Andromeda all about his machinations, and she had signed up for a free one-month trial of

Harry turned back toward the hob. “Don’t think you can curry sympathy with me when you’ve had morning sex and I haven’t. You know the rules.”
Greg squinted and rubbed his nose. “I was talking about rimming,” he declared with a blunt nod.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up.
He winked, and Draco’s fingers tightened around the glass.
“Deal.”

It was Harry’s turn to laugh—loud, incredulous. “Are you serious? I’ve been behaving like an absolute
? What the fuck?”
“Uh, I don’t know much of their stuff, but I don’t think so, no,” Harry laughed.
“Well, that’s not a surprise,” Draco muttered. “What song would you like?”
“How can you—” He looked down at the tabletop, twisted his fingers. “I know him better than either of you and I’ve never once thought—”
“Eat and you’ll feel better,” Harry passed him a plate, tucking into his own food with enthusiasm.
He had lasted a little over six months in Auror training before coming to terms with the fact that he had a bit of an authority problem. He then spent an aimless few months renovating Grimmauld Place in the morning and getting drunk in the afternoon before Bill suggested cursebreaking: he could put his sharp instincts and defensive magic skills to use, with none of the bootlicking required in the Auror corps. A two-year Mastery program in cursebreaking later, and here he was. Gringotts didn’t care about his authority problem, as long as he neutralized any threats to their assets. And Gringotts didn’t care about Malfoy’s
“Did you see that—” Harry gestured vaguely, “He just offered to suck me off in the toilets, special because I’m,” he hiccupped, “because I’m Harry Potter…”
“And Hamza and Winston are ancient history, mate,” said Ron, “Who are you going to bring up next, Ginny?”
“Yeah, d’you think so? I was a little nervous, honestly, usually I just buy everyone’s dinner you know,” he laughed, “but I wanted to do something special this year.”
“It’s— what, it’s in like four months—”
Harry glanced over at Dean, who shot him a fond eyeroll and a wink.

Draco asked, “How do you want to—”
“Last night… we—oh god,” Potter moaned.
“Hmph,” Ethel drained her wine. “I’ve lived a long time, boys. A little advice? Give it a whirl. I can tell you’d get on splendidly as more than best friends.” She winked, picked up her empty wine glass, and ambled off towards the bar.
“Rick—what?”

I had loads of fun writing this, and it was my first fic ever, so please let me know what you think!
“What, hiding out in someone's home and rickrolling them when they come back from work?”
broken up with Ginny, I was barely out to myself, much less publicly, I knew the papers would be all over me, it was just overwhelming… so—” he grimaced, “I asked him not to let it get in the papers, and I left and that was it.” Hermione’s mouth was hanging open, aghast, and Ron was rather white. “I realized I’d screwed up and I tried to be his friend, you know, and when you asked me about it, I don’t know, I panicked, I didn’t want to admit what an arse I’d been, and I knew you’d ask me how I felt and it just seemed easier to not talk about it, at least until I’d gotten myself sorted.”
And then the magic hooked them right behind the navel, tugged hard, and they were off.
Harry gaped at her, “He wouldn’t—”
“Holy shit,” he whispered, “This is incredible.”
“In the loo.” Draco confirmed with a solemn nod.
Draco positively squawked, popping his head out of the ice box, strawberries in hand, “Oh,
Harry gave a bitter laugh. “Yeah, yeah there’s a reason, but it’s not Draco. It’s me.”
“No!” Harry yelped, “Finding out your schedule and making you dinner! That sauce took me all afternoon!”
The morning after the Halloween party, Draco met Pansy for brunch at their favorite muggle patisserie, and, over piping coffee and freshly baked croissants, he fed her all the hot Ministry gossip he had heard the night before. He’d had a surprisingly good time, actually, and people were friendlier than he expected. That was probably due to Harry. Harry had been practically glued to him all night, beaming at everyone in financials as though he actually cared, and casually pulling Draco into conversations with the most important people in the Ministry, including the head of his own department, who’d always looked at Draco like someone would look at something scummy stuck to the bottom of their shoe. And then there was the way Harry had touched him, especially towards the end. Intentionally and intimately, like he had any business stroking his fingers over Draco’s back like that. Like he wanted something more. But Draco had learned not to indulge that particular fantasy. He resolved not to think about it. He brought his coffee to his lips, gazing into the middle distance and remembering how Harry’s fingers had tightened on his back before he’d said goodbye. When he put the cup down, Pansy was looking at him through narrow eyes.
, I’m ready, come on, I want— want you inside me—”

way, including that we never have sex.”
Later, in bed, when Harry got his mouth on Draco, and his fingers inside of him, and Draco’s hands were fisted in his hair, his voice a cracked whimper over the blood rushing in Harry’s ears, he wondered how he had ever been afraid it wouldn’t be good between them. And then, when Draco bowed up off the bed, crying out, and Harry swallowed his release, coming into his own hand just at the feeling of having Draco like this, he decided it didn’t matter. All the fear and the doubt—they were choosing to leave it behind. And all the time he spent never realizing they could be

“No, of course I’m not mad.” He pulled Harry under the spray, “I am, however, questioning my own mental state, since I actually found that
Harry moved above him, biting down a low, shaky noise, and said, “Desk.”
Harry choked on his hit, shoulders shaking with a hysterical fit of laughter and coughing. He handed it off to Draco, who took a measured puff before responding, “No, Greg, we have not. Regarding the actual intention behind your wish, though, the answer is that yes, I did in fact rim Harry until he begged for mercy just yesterday afternoon—”
Harry’s hand tightened around the top of Draco’s thigh. “I want—” he sucked in a breath, “I like to hear you ask for it,” he said hoarsely.
The Post Ranch Inn is a real hotel in Big Sur, and it's fancy as hell... here's
“I’m not—” Draco protested, feeling himself go even redder under Harry’s gaze.
Potter’s eyebrows flew up, “At your— No, Draco, it’s not meant like that, you’re supposed to laugh too— Oh bollocks, this is not turning out—” He stepped fully into the conference room and shut the door behind him, dropping his voice to a whisper, “I thought you might appreciate a

When Potter finished practicing, he threw all the parchment onto the floor and hauled Draco up over the arm of the sofa and knelt behind him and thanked him
Harry frowned at him, waving a questioning hand in the direction of the very fit and now rather confused looking man who was still doing his best to keep Draco’s attention.
Draco laughed. He couldn’t help it. Just one, disbelieving scoff. “You.” He paused. “Want me?”
Ron laughed again, deep and fond, nuzzling into Hermione’s hair.
“Speak for yourself,” Blaise drawled, “All I really wanted was for our boys to make sweet, sweet love.”
Draco pressed just one finger inside and Harry moaned, rocking down insistently, but he kept his pace slow and languid, until Harry was begging, “More,
He staggered backward and felt a strong arm wrap around his waist, “I’ve got you, come on,” Malfoy’s voice vibrated against his ear. Dazed, allowing himself to be led, he stumbled along in Malfoy’s grip, out of the press of bodies, out of the heaving pit. Harry brought a hand to his face—his nose was tender and sticky, and his fingers came away wet and red. Malfoy guided him into the grimy, dimly-lit loo and ushered him into a stall, locking the door behind them and muttering a few privacy spells. Harry breathed thickly though his mouth, tasting blood. The pebbled plastic walls of the stall were covered in lewd graffiti and band stickers. Harry’s calves were pressed against the toilet. Malfoy was standing close, looming over him, a hand fisted in the side of Harry’s shirt. Harry’s head was spinning but he felt good, exhilarated; he wanted more, wanted to throw himself back into the crowd and loose his fists, wanted to bare his bloody teeth and fling his elbows into something solid.
He had just plotted out an apparition course that would get him—exhausted and irritable no doubt—to his mother’s doorstep in time for Christmas dinner the next day, when the door of the pub opened. Draco turned, and started. Harry Potter had just walked in, and he looked…bad. Haggard, with red rimmed eyes and the kind of slouching posture that practically screamed “I want to be left alone.” So naturally, Draco heard himself calling “Oi, Potter,” before he could stop it. Potter turned and caught his eye, surprise registering on his face. He frowned momentarily, as if considering whether to ignore Draco completely, before shrugging slightly and beginning to make his way over.
“Mate, are you serious?” Ron looked at him, incredulous, “This is the most intelligent thing you’ve said regarding Draco since sixth year, probably.” Hermione nodded emphatically.
Halfway through the meal, Harry said, “Wait a minute. I told you my story about, you know, realizing my feelings or whatever, but—” he took a large bite of pizza, stared at Draco as he chewed, “All you said was that you thought about us, but tried not to.” He washed down his pizza with a swig of beer, “More detail, please?”
“Portkey reservations.”
“Was it him dating José? You couldn’t stand to see him with someone else because you wanted him to be yours?”
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, “But apparently he’s one of those goody two-shoes who likes bad boys.”
Neville nodded solemnly in agreement, “I mean, he doesn’t smoke? Could you date someone who doesn’t smoke, Harry?” His eyes widened in horror at the idea and Harry was forced to concede the point that José was perhaps a bit of a tight-arse.
Hermione huffed, turning back to Harry. “I think, yet again, you two are more similar than you recognize. He just needs a little push.”
“Harry,” he said slowly, hesitantly, flushing radiantly, and Harry swayed on the spot with the sudden force of revelation. He wanted Malfoy to call him Harry. He
“It’s not so bad though, is it? The old spinster life?” He elbowed Draco conspiratorially, passing him the bowl.
An answering chorus of “2008!” rang around him.
“I didn't mean— When you said I’m playing a game with you… do you think I— that I’ve been making fun of you or something? All this time?”
, Draco responded with the tiny pursing of his lips that meant
Malfoy shuddered. “I certainly do
“Blimey,” Greg whistled low, “That’s a lot of wishes.”
“And so,” Draco broke in decisively, “You can see why I never bothered to mention this, I’m sure.”
Hermione’s eyes went very soft, and her hand reached out for his. “Oh, Harry,” she said.
It was going to be a good year; Harry could feel it. Or at least, he felt good, right now. He and Draco had invited the whole gang over to Grimmauld to ring in the New Year, and they'd all drank too much, and smoked too much, and certainly danced too much. Hermione and Dean had passed out a haul of muggle accessories, little silver and gold top hats, brightly colored noisemakers that trumpeted when you blew into them, sparkly glasses forming the number
Harry felt extremely out of his depth. He took a couple of steps into the office and lowered his voice. “I mean, we—” he gestured between them. “We slept together!” he whispered, feeling his face heat up. “I’ll admit I don’t know how any of this works, but I’d think that means I could ask how you’re doing if I run into you?”
had been, like his chest squeezing and cracking, overflowing.
, not rabbit,” Harry laughed.
“Well—” he bumped his hand against Draco’s on the table. “He’s very funny, you know, and he lets me talk about work all the time.”
Luna blinked serenely.
Draco kissed him.
Potter made an appreciative noise.
Harry groaned, withdrawing his fingers and conjuring lube into his hand, lining up, pushing in. Draco’s breath left him in a rush, Harry felt so good inside of him, and he told him so and Harry whined and his hips stuttered. He didn’t hold back this time, didn’t tease Draco anymore, just fucked him without restraint or inhibition. When he reached around for Draco’s cock, gasping out, “Are you close, Draco, come on, I want you to come, please,” Draco seized up, moaning, “
fantastic that the muscles in his face were responding of their own volition, with terrifyingly unbridled enthusiasm, and he was afraid he looked completely deranged.
“Oh god,” Draco groaned, “I really am sorry, that was out of line.”
Greg chortled, inhaling deep and exhaling slow, shrouding them all in smoke, “Nah, man, I don’t give a shit. I was just curious.”
Draco laughed, “Is that us then? An idiot and a coward, pretending our loneliness was something special? Needing the collective will of the universe to get us to see sense?” His eyes twinkled.
“I thought we agreed on Harry,” he pouted.
“God,” he murmured, “How do you always make me feel so good?”
“Maybe we should,” Harry groaned, “Sham wedding. Get them all off our case.”
“Shut up,” he grabbed Potter by the jaw, digging his thumb in, and when he opened his mouth to protest Draco slid two fingers in, pressing down on his tongue so he couldn’t speak. “I said shut
“It’s good,” Hermione mused, “to explore a little bit—”
“Gosh, I should have guessed something like that,” Hermione was shaking her head, chuckling, “I mean, just knowing the two of you, the evidence obviously points in that direction—”
“Sorry,” he said, sounding not in the least bit sorry, “did I wake you?”
Draco was only too happy to provide a thorough education on the many and varied opportunities for exploration in the muggle world. Potter, ever the the golden boy, was scandalized.
Draco and José left early to catch a muggle film at the cinema, something about Ancient Greece maybe, Harry didn’t quite catch it. Draco had said it would be spectacular to watch while stoned. Harry didn’t understand why that would be the case for a movie about Ancient Greece, but José said it had gotten a lot of buzz—he watched all the talked-about muggle films. Last month he had taken Draco to see a musical about American R&B stars and Draco had come home raving about it, saying,
At the end of the night, hoarse, bruised and sore, they stumbled off the pavement and ducked behind some shrubbery to cast hasty disillusionment charms on each other and sneak down to the beach. Stripping nude, they charged into the crashing black waves, sluicing the saltwater over their sticky skin, shouting and sputtering, floating on their backs and looking up at the night sky. Harry could just make out the edges of Draco's body under their shoddy, drunken spellwork—a Draco-shaped shadow reflecting the rolling sea all around them. He reached out a hand, splashing around where he thought Draco's arm should be and catching it so he wouldn't float too far. They stayed tethered together, spread-eagled as the cool waves sloshed against their sides, their breath slowing. Finally, pruned and shivering, they struck back to shore and shrugged into their sour, sweaty clothes, traipsing back to their room and collapsing onto the starched sheets of the too-firm twin beds.
“I’ve got to go; I’m on call tonight and we’ve just been summoned back to the offices to help with booking paperwork—there’s been a major bust in a smuggling case.”
“It’s alright,” Hermione put in soothingly, “Harry’s wish is perfectly logically consistent with the rest of ours.” She fixed him with a smug stare, “We’ll stop meddling when you stop denying your feelings and get together with Draco.”
He tipped back in his chair as the third track started, stretching and sending a form flying into the memo box.
Hermione nodded sagely, “Yes Harry that was rather clever, the anonymity must have been a relief.”
“S’alright mate,” Harry plucked the joint from Greg’s offering hand and took an appreciative drag before passing it to Neville. “We don’t need the holiday designation to get stoned but,” he shrugged, “Sometimes it’s fun to be a bit juvenile and self-indulgent.” José nodded slowly, looking like he wasn’t sure about that idea at all.
kids have access to enriching extracurricular activities, no matter how much money their parents have. I’ve been fighting for this cause for years, and I hope that this year we can raise even more scholarship money than we ever have before. To publicly reaffirm my devotion to this cause, I’ll be personally pledging an amount that will cover camp attendance for five first-time attendees. So to those kids out there who are worried that they won’t be able to go to Quidditch Camp this summer, I’m here to say: I will never give up on you, I will never let you down—”
between them, and then Potter’s grin turned wicked and he ground his hips down and Draco stopped thinking at all.
“Nott,” he said, shaking himself and extending a hand, “How are you? You’re looking well.”
. The words were out, and Harry couldn’t unsay them. Malfoy, incredibly, blushed even more; he was practically radiating heat, as he tucked a strand of hair behind his ear in a convulsive, self-conscious movement and said, quietly, “Thank you?”
“I didn’t think it was a disaster,” he said quietly.
And now here was Ron asking whether he wanted to have
But Draco preened a little and thanked him, and there was a giddy feeling rising in Harry’s chest and he said, “Fancy a drink?” And when Draco said yes, Harry took his elbow to lead him over to the bar, his heart beating wildly.
He looked down at his plate, where one last bite of lemon bar remained. He hesitated for a moment, then lifted it to his lips. He heard Malfoy’s sharp, quiet intake of breath across the table. He looked up, straight at Malfoy, as pleasure burst across his tongue and sang through his veins, not enough to send him over the edge again, just enough to feel lush and easy, like gentle fingers curling through his hair, warm ocean waves lapping at his toes.
. He frowned. It wasn’t enough for all of his friends to turn against him, his music had to do it too? He spat into the sink.
Two weeks after the New Year, Harry was sitting in a spindly chair at Draco’s bedside in St. Mungo’s, monitoring charms humming beside him, a curtain drawn around the bed. They were good at their job; the best at Gringotts, if he wasn’t being modest. They were always careful too. It was honestly a trainee move, to miss a blasting curse like that… Harry shuddered, reaching out to take Draco’s cool, limp hand in his own, stroking his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.
too tired for sex, but he had been looking forward to having Harry in his bed, curled around him, warm and comforting.
Chest heaving, Draco barely tamped down the growl of frustration that was threatening the back of his throat as he turned and made to stride towards the door—
“Oh, good lord, no! I—really, I think we should ease into things… But I—I mean, you said it: this is it, right?”
“Because you’re in love with Draco and he’s on a date with a hot Brazilian healer?”
“I wanted to get you riled up,” He let out in a rush. “I— I thought you might be… something like, like how you were just now.” Draco heard his quick, anxious inhale, “Except, not actually mad at me,” he finished sheepishly.
“It certainly is… a situation,” Hermione smirked. “Honestly, I’m curious what he’ll be like outside the office. And you haven’t hexed each other’s bits off yet, which I truly thought was a possibility when you started with him. Maybe it’ll be alright? I mean, goodness knows you’ve taken a liking to this music of his, blasting it all hours of the day and night,” she rolled her eyes in mock irritation. “Just keep the focus on that. Don’t try to talk about anything else—in fact, you probably won’t need to talk much at all, since, you know, a band will be playing. Loudly.”
“Slow down,” Draco squeezed his wrists tight, “And keep your hands behind your back, even when I let go.” Harry nodded, biting his lip. Draco settled his hands on Harry’s hips. “Go on,” he said hoarsely. Harry sucked in a breath, and Draco watched the muscles in his thighs rippling as he slowly levered himself up and back down, letting out a soft, shuddering
“The universe really isn’t fucking around, huh?”
Yes, we slept together. And afterwards, you made your feelings on the matter quite clear. I, considerate partner that I am,” Malfoy’s face twisted, “was perfectly willing to indulge your need to maintain your pure and righteous savior reputation. Thus,” he gestured between them, “I act as if nothing has changed between us, as I gathered that was your wish.”
“Liquid center,” Malfoy beamed, “You wouldn’t believe how finicky it’s been, but I finally wrangled it into submission yesterday.”
, as it was fondly known by overworked students), walking him across the cropped, bright grass of the quad, through the squat glass academic buildings and the cramped student accommodations he had lived in for two years. One day, they had lunch with Draco’s favorite Professor, Jessica Jefferson, whose research focused on how colonizing wizarding populations had recast the native magical practices they encountered as Dark and used those narratives to legitimize their expansion of empire. Although Harry had preferred practical training during his own Mastery, he found himself fascinated by her work and he wasn’t at all surprised that Draco had relished her critical, intellectual courses. Afterwards, they spent the entire lazy afternoon lounging on the grass underneath a palm tree, watching the summer students scurry between the buildings, Harry drinking up Draco’s tales of his favorite memories of this place.
“God no,” Hermione snorted, “I’d just love to see his reaction to you fretting over what to wear to a rock concert with Draco Malfoy,” she grinned.
“Yeah, well… it was fun while it lasted,” Harry grumbled.
Greg looked up from where he was rolling a joint to grin and say, “Best holiday of the year, mate.”
He figured they’d have pretty good luck at this next place, a muggle dance club. They all preferred muggle establishments—no need to worry about their exploits being plastered across the gossip pages of the Prophet come Monday. This particular club was packed and sweaty, dark punctuated with strobing neon lights. The music throbbing through the humid air was vastly different from what Harry and Draco blasted through the halls at Grimmauld, but he had to admit there was something to the thudding beats. The very structure of the rhythms demanded a shedding of inhibitions, a wild gyrating of hips. Blaise had bribed the DJ an exorbitant sum to get his requests in the queue as soon as they walked in, so they didn’t have much wait after hitting the bar before they were all surrounding Draco in a circle, drinks in the air, chanting,
“So, Draco’s got a hot date, huh?”
, instead of a quickie at the back of the Ministry Archive Room?”
Harry made a sleepy noise, snuggling into Draco’s chest and then laughing, “Well, as much as I’d like to stay here for a quick nap, you’re actually quite bony,” Draco could feel him grinning and pinched his side gently, eliciting a little yelp. Harry pulled back and turned his face up, “And I’ll be missed, so I suppose we’d better go back to the party soon?”
, so Draco pulled out, eliciting a gasp and a shiver from Harry, who stayed draped over the desk, naked and insensible, while Draco put his own clothes to rights and cast gentle cleaning spells over them both. He retrieved Harry’s kit from the floor and knelt beside him, coaxing first one leg in and then the other, maneuvering him back into his clothes and lacing him up, and then sitting back into his chair and drawing Harry down, sideways into his lap. Harry nuzzled into his neck, humming, and the gesture was so affectionate, so open, that it pulled the question right out of him, the one he was afraid to ask.
Draco dropped his arm to find Potter peering anxiously down at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry wrote Malfoy letter after letter, apologizing profusely, begging for forgiveness, recounting everything he’d felt that night and since. At least one letter every day for two weeks. His small brown owl, Glenlivet, had started waiting by Harry’s desk in the evening after work, with a sorry look on his face.
Harry stumbled over to the bar, intent on drowning his self-pity in yet another gin. He had just smacked his empty glass on the bartop when he felt a nudge to his elbow.
But finally, the first Saturday in March, Harry awoke to the sound of muted voices down the hall. It seemed José had spent the night. He grinned to himself. Whenever one of them pulled, or brought home a date, the next morning was always interesting. Harry and Draco refused to modulate their behavior for the comfort of this other person, whoever they were. They simply acted like they always did, Draco kissing Harry dramatically on the cheeks and singing endearments at him in French, Harry cranking the music up full volume and headbanging over the skillet while he poked at the sausages. Sometimes they even made a game of it, one-upping each other with their ridiculous behavior, seeing how weird they could get before the person made their excuses and scurried out the door. Obviously, they had the most fun with one-night stands. It was probably a reason why so many of them never turned into anything more. And José was already more, so Harry wasn’t going to try to scare him away, or anything. He was just curious.
“Right then,” said Ron, “Shagging, in all the ways you fancy it. Seamus and I wish a good shagging upon you both!”
“They’re requesting my presence on an urgent matter related to…
Potter chuckled again and tweaked Draco’s nipple, drawing out a very undignified whine before Draco could stop himself.
“Are we not part of the collective? Because I wish my friends would stop meddling—”
“Alright then,” he drew a small wooden case out from a hidden drawer behind the counter and opened it, revealing a row of cabochon-shaped lozenges, deep red and shining like glass. “I’ve been working on these for weeks. They should be extremely relaxing—high THC and valerian root, with a bit of ginger for zing and just a touch of psilocybin to ensure a positive mood—would you like to try one?”
“Sow your wild oats, Harry!” Ron shouted from the floor, raising a bottle of wine in Harry’s direction. Hermione giggled, refilling her own glass.
made it through that week, that I’d welcome an interruption to my work, so that you could have a laugh at my expense?”
, Draco had said. Harry had taken another look at Circe’s matted black fur and bright green eyes, and said, incredulous,
Finally, Harry moved over him, Draco letting out an appreciative sigh at the feel of Harry’s skin on his.
“And?” She looked at him, wide-eyed, beseeching. “What do you think? Is it alright? Do I need to change anything?”
Draco noticed his distraction, asking if he was alright, saying
, and they danced around the kitchen, shimmying their shoulders, pointing at each other, scream-singing
“We’re doing this,” He brushed his fingers through Draco’s fringe, trailed them over his cheek, settled his palm, warm and possessive around the curve of Draco’s neck. “We’re definitely doing this.”
“And date, actually—” Ginny broke in and then clapped a hand over her mouth.
Draco frowned. “I’m not really sure… All the things I think of—caring about someone, wanting to be around them, be there for them, do things with them—I feel that way about you, except—” he broke off, frowning. “It’s something more than the sum of its parts maybe… like a different
“I cannot fucking believe they pulled that stunt with the wish…” He paused to take a puff, “Well, actually, I can. But still, is it just me or have they been getting even worse lately?”
“Holy shit,” he whispered again, locking eyes with Malfoy, mouth open on a gasp, “I feel—I feel like I’m
“Cheers to that!” Hermione broke in, lifting her teacup in salute.
Harry had told them he wanted to talk, and he knew they’d noticed how distracted he had been over the past few weeks, the itch under his skin. He took a deep breath.
“Come on,” Draco’s head was bent low, whispering in his ear, “I want to see you get off, just from this.”
Malfoy frowned. “Yes, Potter, as unlikely as it once seemed, I do believe we have become friends.”
When he was ready, he kept his eyes locked on Draco as he positioned himself, sinking down. He wanted to see it across Draco’s face, that ecstasy so sharp it shares an edge with distress, writ in the soft
José reacted with appropriate enthusiasm to Ron’s food, which won him a few more points in Harry’s book, and Ron’s too. Hermione whirled in and had barely shaken José’s hand before launching into a spirited line of questioning around how St. Mungo’s was adjusting their disclosure and confidentiality policies to respond to the recent abolition of the national lycanthrope registry. José appeared genuinely delighted by this, and Harry and Ron exchanged bemused glances with Draco before tucking into the strata while it was still piping hot.
Draco took one long, measured breath. The base of his skull was tingling. “And why did you think I would be… like that?”
Hermione positively cackled, “I’m
, please.”
“It’s a muggle prank,” Potter was practically
Harry shrugged, “Could be fun. Reckon I’m drunk enough. I’m a shite singer though so you’ll have to carry us.”
“I won’t be long,” he exhaled shakily. “You said— you wanted to suck me off or you wanted me to bend you over the desk—” Harry nodded, and Draco gritted his teeth, “Pick one.”
“Yeah,” he said quick, breathless, “D’you want to go back to mine?”
Draco squeezed shoulder. “I know. We’ve got each other, at least.”
“Blimey… Malfoy? But—Malfoy!” he gestured wildly “And I just—oh bollocks, Harry I just said
He turned. He hadn’t even noticed the wizened old woman sitting on the other side of the table. Stark white hair piled into a neat knot on the top of her head, knobbly fingers clutching a glass of dark red wine, she sat ramrod straight, chic plum dress robes buttoned all the way up, brow stern, lipstick crisp.
now?!”
She eyed him narrowly for a moment, wrinkling her nose, “Well, you could start by taking a shower.”
“You do that,” Draco replied, spinning Harry around so they were face to face, winding his arms around Harry’s neck, leaning down and weaving his head side to side, body undulating like a snake, smirking at Harry and crooning,
big compared to yours, you’re
Draco frowned. What kind of stupid question was that? “What else would you expect me to think?” he asked flatly.
“Don’t give me that sorry look,” Harry started, his throat catching, “I know it’s stupid—”
Hermione’s laugh brimmed back up, warm and familiar, “No offense taken, dear.” She sighed, “I only wish Ron weren’t working late.”
Draco allowed a positively feral grin to spread across his face, “Oh you think I’m fit, do you?”
Or they might find themselves how they were now, Draco on his back with his knees fully spread, Harry settled between his thighs, touching his face, gazing into his eyes.
Blaise grinned, sharklike. “Draco, darling… Harry, sweet Harry…” He swept an upturned palm towards them, “I wish upon you the most dignified lovemaking—that you might stare tenderly into each other’s eyes and whisper sweet nothings into each other’s ears—that you might uncover your deepest desires together—feast upon a cornucopia of carnal pleasure the likes of which you had heretofore never imagined—”
He twisted up to fit his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, “What about him?”
, he said. The full experience eschewed healing charms as well, so Harry was sporting a vivid black eye from the pit at The Used, while the fair skin on Draco’s arms was blooming with faint purple bruises. They capped the weekend with Fall Out Boy at the main stage, shoving each other gleefully, singing their throats raw. Filthy, aching and exhausted, Harry looked up at Draco beside him—Draco, who was always beside him—and thought, not for the first time,
, throwing elbows, even punches. Harry didn’t think. He launched forward into the fray, spinning as a shoulder caught him in the chest, shoving back, a wild energy singing through his veins.
, the word feeling like taffy in his mouth.
—” as soon as he said it the pleasure spiked, exploding through his chest and down his spine, pulsing through his limbs, leaving a shudder in its wake.
you,” Draco slammed his hips down. “You incorrigible— insufferable—
Dean shrugged. “A bit yeah.” He took a swig of his beer. “I do think you two would be great together, you know that.” Harry nodded miserably. “But it’s not always that easy to make the jump.”
Draco clenched his hands, fingernails digging into his palms, closing his eyes against the terrible knowledge that of course, the answer was and always would be
“Ah,” Harry cleared his throat; he could feel himself blushing furiously, “erm, yes, well—”
The restaurant Draco had picked for his birthday dinner was insanely posh—the type of establishment Harry would only go to for Draco’s birthday dinner. He always felt uncomfortable in places like this, a little raw, exposed, like it was visible on his body somehow—written in the way he inhabited his jacket, the way his body filled the space in the room, that he had never had properly fitting clothes, that no one had taught him manners beyond
Harry backed out and closed the library door behind him, heading up to his room. What did one wear to a rock concert, anyways? He didn’t own anything particularly
“Really, Ronald, all of this nagging at us to settle down—” He shook his head morosely, “And when you take into account those delectable pasties you made earlier… you’re becoming your mother, it’s undeniable.”
It was brilliant. Everyone was shouting, and Harry was shouting too, and no one could hear him over the music. Everyone was jumping and flinging their limbs around and Harry lost himself in the tangle, jerking his shoulders and shaking his head with the rise and fall of sound, just another writhing body. He was grinning uncontrollably, wide and open-mouthed, and yes, this had definitely been a good idea, how could he have ever thought this was a bad idea?
Harry burst through the back door of Grimmauld after work, shouting “Hermione! Where are you? I need help!”
Well, Harry had had enough. On Thursday afternoon, he just so happened to be chatting with Roberta in payroll as she finished the monthly expense reports. As she was about to drop them into the “out” box, Harry volunteered to walk them over to financial himself—he’d been on desk duty all day, you know, he’d appreciate the excuse to stretch his legs. He didn’t let himself think too deeply about what he was doing on his way over there—maybe he would run into Malfoy, maybe not. But Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. Harry dropped off the reports, made polite small talk with the head witch in charge of payroll—yes, he had no complaints about Roberta, she was splendid and always helped him get his overtime paperwork in on time, really, he had only walked the reports down to get a bit of exercise—and turned to go, wondering if perhaps Malfoy had been kidnapped, or moved abroad.
“You feel so good— so good inside me,” he whispered, and Draco tilted his chin up and kissed him. He still tasted of lemons.
Eric picked up his drink and pushed off the bar, “No worries, mate, I just figured it couldn’t hurt to ask,” he grinned—no big deal—like he had just been informed an item in a display window wasn’t for sale. “Have a good night,” he said, and walked away.
Draco shot him an amused look, “A whole week? What will I wear?”
Dean sidled up next to him. “You’re looking a bit out of sorts,” he said, tilting his head questioningly.
“Undo my trousers,” Draco panted, unwilling to stop fingering Harry, curling his other hand around the top of his thigh. Harry brought his arms around with a gasp, his fingers clumsy and frantic.
“A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of,” Draco continued, earnest as anything, “You wouldn’t get this from any other guy.”
hadn’t discussed exactly what was going on between them, but in recent weeks, while sometimes the sex was still hot and frantic and careless, other times it was…different. Draco found himself waking up in the mornings spooned around Harry, and he would hold him there and fuck into him, lazy and slow, Harry weak with sleep, fingers twitching feebly and curling into the sheets as Draco breathed over the sweet spot below his ear.
They stayed like that well into the afternoon, swaddled in blankets and snuggling the cats. At some point, Harry got up to clean the kitchen, returning to collapse back on the sofa, fitting himself under the crook of Draco’s arm, resting his head against Draco’s chest. The wireless was tuned in to the New Year’s Day exhibition match between Ireland and Wales. The fire was bright in the grate, the afternoon light dim in the garden. Harry lit another joint.
. But when a well-muscled bloke with shaggy hair and perfect teeth asked if Harry wanted to come back to his boat (with a completely straight face, as if living on a boat were perfectly normal), Harry didn’t think twice before saying
“Bloody well hope so,” Draco muttered.
Potter, voice going a bit panicky, waved his hand, “Anyways, you didn’t answer the question.”
And Draco finally, inexplicably, snapped. He drained his drink and slammed it on his desk. “Christ, Potter, do you
, he’d said. Harry’s favorite song that summer had been 'Minority,' and Draco had told him he was
“Potter,” Draco growled, as Harry pushed open the door, grinning brightly.
He lifted his head and reached for his wine, draining it and setting it back on the coffee table. Pansy promptly refilled it.
Harry blinked. “Oh,” he said, pausing a beat. And then, “Can I stay here tonight?”
Harry pulled his gaze away and spotted a man eyeing them from across the floor; a very attractive man—Nordic looking, all tall and broad and blond.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Honestly, the real question is why did you ever date Meg in the first place? She was practically a child.”
Draco glared at her, “Just because
“Hold still,” Malfoy murmured.
. Shut up and fuck me.”
Draco’s mouth twisted. “No, I— Well, you were the reason I left, actually, I certainly wasn’t planning
Harry rolled his eyes, “Open it, you prat.”
“Merlin,” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically, “What would be less offensive to the Savior’s tastes? The Spice Girls, perhaps?”
! Harry!”
“I want to ride you,” Harry interrupted, his voice rough.
“Absolutely not, and it’s not going to,” said Harry.
Draco frowned. “I fail to see the humor.”
“Bet you loved that.”
“Noo,” Harry laughed, swaying a little and standing up from his seat at the bar, “Just—" He turned his face into Draco’s chest, “Take me home?” he mumbled.
Harry laughed, “No again; I
Draco’s smile turned into a smirk.
am—” Luna sat up on her knees, swaying slightly. Hermione snorted. Ginny had put an underwater charm on Luna’s hair and the luminous strands swayed around her face like a hypnotizing, benevolent Medusa. “I think we’ve been granted a collective wish,” she pronounced, “It’s extremely rare, you know, and very powerful…” She peered around the circle, wide eyes like two huge full moons in her face, shining in the flickering pale light. “If we all wish the same thing, our wishes link up—the power of the communal intention runs through them to become greater than the sum of their parts.” A solemn nod. “The universe will manifest something truly remarkable.”
“I’m just not used to listening to music. I never did, growing up. And I don’t know, now it’s just… not my habit? It kind of feels—” he frowned, “—too late really to develop, like, particular tastes…”
Malfoy ordered the lemon bars while Harry sat quietly, resolutely sipping his water and
Draco would have thought that they all spent enough time in muggle clubs since the war to have at least a passing familiarity with the biggest hits, but Harry kept saying he didn’t know the words to any songs. They only settled it when Hermione waved a hand dismissively and said,
For the rest of the weekend, Harry felt on edge and off balance. He kept thinking about Malfoy and feeling that odd panic again. On Monday, he stopped by Malfoy’s office, hoping to ease the tension in his chest. Malfoy greeted him with a snide remark about how perhaps he ought to submit a recommendation to decrease the funding for the Auror Department, since it seemed like Harry didn’t have enough work to do. Harry thought about his smooth, posh voice and the way it had broken, hoarsely forming the word
Harry stopped short. That possibility hadn’t occurred to him yet.
Potter swung his legs out of the bed and sat up, hunched over slightly, still with his back to Draco. “Ok.” He muttered to himself, “This is fine. It’s fine. Deep breaths.”
Draco hadn’t even stepped away from the mantel before Harry was crowding his space, backing him up against the wall beside the fireplace. He stopped short of touching, inches apart. He could see Harry’s chest heaving, hear him breathing—a desperate inhale and a short exhale. Harry was practically vibrating with tension. It was radiating off him, his jaw clenching and unclenching, hands twitching and fisting at his sides. Draco felt suddenly lightheaded.
about Potter: the absolute idiocy of approaching your childhood rival-slash-recent sexual regret and earnestly asking to be friends like they were still eleven years old, honestly, who does that? Of bloody course, in attempting a platonic overture, Potter only made Draco
Draco turned back toward the sea of riotous, drunken faces, enthusiastically welcoming the prospect of a rousing rendition of Scrawny Muggle Ginger's greatest hit; Draco supposed they were all familiar with the prank. He faced Harry again and narrowed his eyes.
nice, putting their lips together, tucking himself in under Draco’s arm on the couch, wiggling his toes under Draco’s thighs, leaning into him at the bar. All of that felt good and right, and it was even more than he shared with his other friends, Harry knew that. He knew he felt
together—you know what that means?”
that was—”
Sometimes Harry felt she lived to torment him—yet another way she reminded him of Draco. Draco was the reason they had Cassie in the first place. Last winter, he had come home from a grocery run with a dirty, terrified kitten in his arms, proclaiming
“That sounds fun,” Harry said. “I’ve never been to a concert before—unless you count the Weird Sisters fourth year,” he laughed.
Ron shrugged, “I’m just saying it’s possible, wedding’s only in a few months now—”
“I’m sorry.”
So on a balmy Friday in late September, Malfoy strode into the pub and took his customary seat beside Susan Bones (his favorite teammate—she didn’t talk much, she had a very dry sense of humor, and she was a dab hand at spell trivia). She caught him up on the latest goings-on in the Auror Department and he regaled the team with an incredibly boring story about that month’s budgetary numbers. He’d just sat back with his whiskey when Potter walked in, followed closely by the Gryffindor who’d been their quidditch captain before him–Draco was sure he knew the man’s name, but a strange weight had settled in the base of his brain, radiating static and disrupting the rest of his thoughts. To his horror, Potter slid into the booth next to him (despite not being an official team member, he simply always sat with Granger and no one protested), grinning shyly and saying, “You all remember Oliver, yeah?” And then everyone was playing catch-up on their lives since Hogwarts and Draco was sitting extremely still and wondering when was too soon to get up and go back to the bar.
José blushed and protested, and Harry thought he seemed good for Draco, in a way, steady and sure. He seemed like someone who had always known what it was like to be loved unconditionally, who probably had no problem opening his heart and holding someone else there. It made him happy, to see Draco have that, and if his own scone stuck dryly in his throat as he swallowed, he wasn’t going to dwell on that.
Harry snorted as he righted both himself and the cot, as Draco was saying, “Am I so lucky to have you assigned as my healer?”
Draco stroked soothingly through Harry’s hair and down his back, whispering in his ear how good he had been, and steadfastly ignoring the fact that he hadn’t come yet, was still hard and throbbing inside of Harry. And after a moment, Harry noticed it too, lifting his head from Draco’s shoulder with a hitch of breath, saying, soft and uncertain, “You still—” Draco wound his hands around Harry’s hips and thrust up, gently, and Harry whimpered.
Draco pulled him into a hug, squeezed tight, said into his ear, “Yes, this is incredible, thank you so much.”
problem either, apparently. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy in three years, not since the trials after the war. He’d testified on Malfoy’s behalf—his mother too—shared what they’d done for him at the end and argued for leniency. He’d gotten what he asked for—the Wizengamot gave him everything he asked for, that summer. Malfoy had been acquitted and promptly fucked off to America, apparently to pursue his Mastery in Curses and Dark Arts. Now he had been at Gringotts a year already, meaning he had just graduated his own trainee period. Just in time to supervise Harry for three months. Harry gritted his teeth.
“I suppose not, I mean, I think a concert might be fun, I’ve never been to one before, you know? But with Malfoy? I just…” he grimaced.
“What the fuck, Ron?”
“I have a lot of pajamas. And I like the way you look in them.”
“I need to ask you about something.”
Draco raised the microphone to his lips and started belting it out.
Harry kissed him.
“Sure,” he said, “Gin and tonic.”
Everyone laughed, and Potter elbowed him, “Lucky you’re much better now.”
“Hopefully I won’t be long.”
“Please what?” He nudged a third finger against Harry’s entrance, “Tell me what you want.”
. But he was also here gently mending Harry’s face, standing so close in this filthy stall. He had also brought Harry here, shared with him this new language, offered him release in the violent throng of thrashing bodies. Harry frowned. What were they to each other, now? His lips parted.
expects you to be straight and do the whole, you know, marriage and kids thing?”
“No, I was just checking to make sure you were still paying attention, you looked a little zoned out there,” he grinned. “Although…” he tilted his head to the side in mock consideration, waggling his eyebrows.
.” Draco swallowed, still sluggish with the shock of Harry’s revelation, frozen in place. Harry rolled his eyes, filling the silence, “I mean, you did stick your fingers in my mouth, so I sort of think I was right and you
“Is it? Some find the anonymity freeing.”
. And then, the unthinkable happened. Draco leaned around the bloke grinding up on him to yell in Harry’s direction, “I’m hungry!”
“Very well,” Healer Andrade chuckled and turned to Harry, “Good morning, Mr. Potter,” his eyes slid to the cot and back, “I didn’t expect to be seeing you again so soon.”
Walking next to Malfoy through muggle London, stoned out of his mind, Harry let their shoulders casually knock together. Everything Malfoy gave him made him feel so calm and easy, and Malfoy looked so peaceful in the hazy twilight, and Harry wanted to thank him, he wanted to touch him, maybe try to express how he was feeling, or try to hold Malfoy’s hand, or—wait, where
“Draco,” Harry breathed, “You’re not a coward, you’re not—”
At that pleasantly tipsy point in the night when everyone was well into their second cocktail but the main courses hadn’t arrived yet, Neville cornered Harry in the loo.
“Oh my
He shifted uncomfortably as Dean threw him an assessing look, his gaze softening after a moment. “I know a little something about what it’s like to realize you have feelings for your best friend, you know.”
—ok fine, so there had been some days in their lives more important than this one. But this was still pretty fucking important. And Harry—
“Just seems a bit…”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “You know I love some of them, but there are honestly a bunch of idiots up there.”
“Er…” Harry grimaced into his champagne; Draco stifled a laugh.
“Was that… alright?”
“They’re going through the honeymoon phase,” said Hermione, “Let them have their fun,” she elbowed Ron, grinning wickedly, “Don’t you remember what that’s like?”
and no one was paying attention. Harry’s breathing had gone slightly ragged, and he wasn’t able to focus on any of the conversations going on around him. All he could think of was the memory of Draco’s bare skin under his hands. He pressed the heel of his hand slightly against Draco’s spine, and then started slowly stroking his thumb up and down. He felt lightheaded. Surely, Draco knew now. He must know, and he wasn’t moving away, so Harry moved a hair closer, brushing their hips together.
“Oh just shut the fuck up,” Draco snarled, pushing him back down and straddling his hips. “I don’t want to hear another fucking word out of you.”
? He shivered. A small giggle burbled up from his chest. His senses were blown open, endorphins flooding his bloodstream. He felt brilliant, blissed out and fuzzy. He looked down at his trousers. He hadn’t actually ejaculated, although he was half-hard now, just as if he had. In fact, every sensation in his body felt like he had just come harder than he could remember in a long time. He laughed again, sated and languid, as he slowly dragged his eyes up to Malfoy. Malfoy, who was chewing his own lemon bar contentedly. Except, Harry noticed, his cheeks were a blotchy red, and his breath was quick. He stared at Harry for a moment, then his jaw flared, his throat bobbed.
They didn’t ask after each other’s weekends or offer to grab an extra coffee when one of them went to the canteen. Harry wasn’t yet sure what to make of this new Malfoy and his pro-muggle, anti-establishment tastes.
Harry whacked him in the face with a pillow.
Ginny spat out her champagne. “Hah! Nice one, Greg.”
Draco held out his arm, motioning Harry to his side. He came willingly enough, frowning as he grasped Draco’s hand and leaned in, “Are you about to embarrass me with a big speech again?”
“I—” Harry’s throat worked around a swallow, “I could stay?”
to figure out what sort of music you like?”
“I want curry chips!” Draco shouted.
He glanced at the note again, frowning. “Just me… I’ve no idea why, I don’t even work on future-related matters.”
“I always want you to feel good,” Draco said, very quietly.
he would think,
all about it—! I actually said those words… He didn’t like that very much.”
“You’re so
, Ron, it’s just, private—”
Pansy frowned.
“Ah…” Draco felt himself blushing. Sometimes he really hated his fair skin.
He glanced up to see Malfoy gaping at him. “Too late? Are you— are you mad? Potter, we’re twenty-one years old. You’re going to live a hundred more years and you think it’s
Harry reached out, rubbed his thumb across Draco’s knuckles.
Malfoy shrugged in agreement, “Buy it, then.”
?” Draco sounded delighted; Harry shuddered to imagine the many ways he was planning to torment Pansy with this information.
Malfoy grinned, “Oh, I might have just the thing for you—are you willing to be my lab rabbit tonight?” Every so often Malfoy let him test new products in the evenings after he closed up. They would draw the shades and sit on the shop floor, giggling and passing a bag of crisps back and forth.
“Oh, hell yeah,” Harry leaned forward and plucked one of the luminous pastilles out of the box. It felt hot in his fingers, pulsing slightly. He popped it into his mouth and sucked, and it tasted warm and spicy and sweet, and it softened on his tongue and then burst—
“Ron—” Harry protested desperately, “let’s not talk about this—"
Harry grinned, “Yeah, yeah, well if he’s still around once I get you fixed up, maybe
“Oh,” Potter said slowly. “That’s… gross.”
looking up at the server. Harry had no idea how much time passed before the food arrived, but he spent every stretched-out, liquid moment of that time fighting the stirring arousal in his trousers, fighting the urge to reach across the table and lay his hands on Malfoy’s delicate wrists. His heart was quick in his throat when the lemon bars were finally placed on the table in front of them, fingers shaking as he reached for his dessert spoon.
“I don’t even care,” Harry breathed, sticking his head back in from the deck, crossing the room and flopping down next to Draco.
“Yeah,” Harry felt some weight lift off his chest, “Yeah, pretty much.”
but it had been a near thing, at the end, and now finally Potter was braced behind him, hands tight on Draco’s hips, thrusting into him maddeningly slowly, and Draco was whining, turning his face into the cushions and clenching his teeth against that urge to beg, clawing its way up his spine.
, he could not wait to be shot of this job. He opened the second right drawer of his desk, just to check—his contract with the Tornadoes, proofed by his solicitor and ready to be signed on Tuesday. Sighing happily, he poured himself another finger, and allowed a slow smile to steal across his face. Two more days. Only two more days, and he could put in his notice with management and get the fuck out of there. He’d done his duty, balanced the books, brokered some truly outstanding trades, hired an assistant coach with real potential. He could go with a clean conscience. He hadn’t scarpered when things became… difficult, for him. He had stuck it out for two bloody years, and now he’d just watched his team win for the last time before they weren’t his team anymore, and he felt something loosen inside of his chest. He started grinning stupidly, he couldn’t stop.
“I heard you got quite the birthday gift for Draco, eh?”
“Yes, but I just went out on the town for my
much,” Draco agreed.
Harry blinked. “I—” he shut his mouth, swallowed, “I guess I just don’t really know where to start.”
And the way the orientation manager had smiled at him when she read out the names—triumphantly, like she was daring him to protest. Apparently, Bill hadn’t been kidding about the first trainee rotation being a sort of hazing ritual. New breakers at Gringotts spent one year as trainees, rotating between units and supervisors: four three-month rotations. The first one was always with a breaker who had just graduated from their own trainee year. Supposedly, this was to ease the transition into the job, since recent grads took on the more basic assignments. Harry suspected that it was actually a covert method of forced gauntlet running, a cleverly disguised test, a torment: the blind leading the blind. He had been hurried through one single week of orientation and onboarding, and now he was marching toward to his first three-month rotation… with
?” he said, incredulous, “I haven’t seen you since you were skiving off games to whinge about a little scratch on your arm,” he laughed. There was a split second of painful silence, and Potter grimaced beside him.
He rolled off then, crossing his legs and knocking his fist into Harry’s thigh, “Oh, I cannot
In the light of day though, with a very awake Draco underneath him, Harry found himself looking at an absolutely gorgeous man. Tall and tanned, with wavy brown hair and warm eyes, a square jaw full of straight, white teeth. Draco shoved Harry off the bed, sending him sprawling into the cot, “Oh no, you didn’t interrupt anything,” he purred.
Draco shoved him off with a shriek.
Dean clapped him on the back. “You’ll be alright,” he said.
“Yeah, I mean, this is probably the grandest romantic gesture I’ve ever made—"
“Cassie,” he groaned, “gerroff,” shoving the cat away from his face and rolling over, closing his eyes again. Cassie had a sixth sense for whenever Harry was going to wake up with a raging hangover, and she invariably perched right on his pillow, practically suffocating him. When he protested, she fixed him with a reproachful gaze, as if to say
Harry was sweating too. He was so
Harry whimpered high in his throat, bucking against Draco’s touch at his rim, and Draco couldn’t hold back anymore. He pulled Harry in, kissing him, pressing their bodies together, fumbling to conjure some lube and slide again against the entrance to Harry’s body, ever so gently, feeling his body tighten with desire as Harry writhed in his lap.
“What the…” Harry’s voice was unsteady, awestruck, “What the fuck was that?”
He needed to do something about this. It was too important, though, Draco was too important, to proposition him in the middle of a concert. Even Harry wasn’t that heedless—at least, not at twenty-seven years old. He needed a plan. He swallowed, threw his arms in the air and joined Draco singing along, his voice hoarse and cracking.
“Mmmm,” she turned her languid smile on Harry, blinking slowly, “Neville’s outdone himself.”
Malfoy’s jaw dropped. “You don’t… what?”
“What am
“Oh,” Harry laughed, “Oh I didn’t realize you meant— no, no, we’re not together.”
in Malfoy—he wasn’t, not at all. They’d had sex (really incredible sex), so it was only natural that Harry would notice the shift in Malfoy’s throat as he swallowed his drink, or the soft shine of his hair in the low light. He couldn’t help but remember the press of Malfoy’s body against his whenever their knees jostled together under the table. But that didn’t have to mean anything. They had chemistry; Harry was willing to admit that by now. At first, he’d simply thought it would always be that good with a man, that he’d been so overwhelmed by the encounter simply because he was finally experiencing what he was supposed to feel during sex. But after more than a few nights at the muggle clubs Malfoy had recommended, Harry had realized that sex with men could be mediocre too, and Malfoy had indeed been that good. Still though, he was only just figuring out how to be friends with Malfoy. So when Malfoy turned to grin at him after sweeping the Post-League Careers of Famous Quidditch Players category, and Harry felt a soft shiver of pleasure run down his spine, he was pretty confident that was only the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you’re making a new friend.
“Oh.” The insides of Harry’s chest were doing something funny. Neville’s towering figure blurred in front of him. He blinked. Neville was smiling at him.
Draco laughed, a short, bitter sound. “I was. It’ll never be as if it didn’t happen.”
Ron roared with laughter, wrapping an arm around Hermione, “How’d you like that, love, me becoming my mother?”
Harry cleared his throat.  Was that weird? It seemed like he should be embarrassed, but he wasn’t sure why. “Yeah, I—I know he’s fine here and he’s going to be under all night, but I wanted to be here when he wakes up? We’re a team, and I— I should have double-checked him, noticed that blasting curse… And I’ll get a shite sleep at home anyways,” he shrugged, “Cassie’ll know I’m miserable and she’ll try to sit on my face all night.”
Over another drink, Draco discovered that, despite Witch Weekly’s annual headlines claiming that
Sometimes he wanted to throttle Potter, wanted to throw him bodily out the office window overlooking the training pitch. Other times he wanted to call Potter’s bluff, push him up against the desk and get his mouth on him, pin his hands and fuck him into submission, into quiescence. But he never gave in, of course. He betrayed not the faintest hint of emotion; nothing cracked his façade. And now, finally, he was almost free—
except for Sirius’ old motorcycle jacket, and it was too warm for that. He eventually settled on his darkest jeans and a plain black V-neck shirt. Malfoy wore a lot of black, so he figured that was a safe option.
It didn’t take long. Draco’s knees gave out as he finished, and Harry held him up, pinning his hips to the wall and licking him clean. And then he tucked Draco back into his trousers and stood up, brushing a thumb across Draco’s cheekbone.
Harry whined, rocking his hips forward more firmly.
Harry moved over him, indulgent and determined, until Draco gasped, “Harry— Harry, I—”
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Well, me too, I’m going with you,” He felt his face go scarlet, “And not just Los Angeles, also— Oh, open the black one first, and I’ll explain.”
“Oh,” Draco’s mouth fell open. That hadn’t occurred to him. Or rather, it had, but only in the secret thoughts he indulged in occasionally when he went to bed alone, wondering how Harry’s day had been.
“No, Luna—"
kidding me!”
Harry made a strangled noise.
“Who’s José?”
“Hmm,” Draco chuckled, “We wouldn’t even have to change anything; we could just continue on living at Grimmauld, except everyone would leave us alone.”
Naked, he looked at Draco, biting his lip, breathing shallow. Draco cocked his head, skimming his eyes up and down Harry’s body.
Malfoy? What did that even mean?
Harry just laughed. Sure, he had been feeling a little sentimental earlier in the loo with Neville, but he was halfway trolleyed now and fully over that strange burst of emotion. He certainly had no interest in taking Draco to bed, and in fact was fully committed to making sure that Draco went home with someone else tonight—someone who was
“Anthony’s very nice,” Hermione said, tilting her head and leveling Pansy with a considering look, “He might be good for you, actually…”
The Ministry Halloween party was an extravagant affair, held in the atrium. In the post-war years, there had been a push to encourage costumes in the muggle tradition, and now the Muggle Liaison Office played a major role in the planning. Harry and Ron had dressed as muggle policemen, in embarrassingly tight
He was still standing like that a few minutes later, pretending to listen to Draco and Susan discuss the theoretical underpinnings of shield charms, when an inter-departmental memo descended, knocking Harry in the head. He unfolded it and groaned, bumping his forehead against Draco’s shoulder.
On Monday he saw the photos in the Prophet: Potter and Wood, walking out of the pub hand-in-hand, surrounded by friends. Potter was laughing at something, knocking their shoulders together. The photos were accompanied by a block of text speculating wildly about his prior dating history with men (
Harry sighed. As if it weren’t enough to have people treating him like a piece of meat, he always felt like he had to let them down gently or else he became the arsehole. “I’m not looking for a hookup tonight,” he smiled tightly.
“Alright, Harry, let’s strategize.”
Draco stood abruptly, knocking the barstool back behind him and pinning Harry with a fierce glare. “Is that supposed to make me feel better?” he hissed. “You think I’m going to skip happily on home because you really did enjoy fucking me?” Harry frowned, shaking his head— he didn’t mean— “You think it’s a great relief for me to hear that you find me so despicable, you’d keep ‘the best fuck of your life’ a secret - from even your
“God, Harry,” he moaned, “You’re so— I’ve wanted you—you’re so good, you’re fucking perfect—” and Harry let out one thin, high, whimper, and Draco’s hips drove forward and stayed there, grinding in as he seized up and then stilled, chest heaving.
Now, the late-night snacking round had commenced, and they had retreated outside to the stargazing dome Hermione had set up in the back garden. Like a soap bubble perched on the grass, clear and cozy, the shimmering, translucent shell kept the winter wind out and the body heat in. Pillows and blankets were strewn over the musty old rugs Harry and Ron had dragged out from the drawing room earlier that day. Hermione had woven light-pollution filters and vision acuity charms into the dome’s surface so that, like a reverse fishbowl, they could see out with perfect clarity—the night sky winked down as if they were in the farthest ranges of the highlands rather than the middle of London. Floating glass baubles filled with pale blue flames lit the space with a flickering, iridescent light, like they were underwater, or out among the stars. The air was hazy with smoke and buzzing with the languid, intimate chatter of the come down, the banked embers of a raucous party, riding out the tail end of the night in a tangled heap of limbs.
“Oh my god, are you two going off to fuck?”
“Yes,” Draco nosed into his hairline, “You’re extremely needy.” He bit gently on Harry’s earlobe.
Harry snickered, shoving Draco over so he sprawled back on the cushions.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “What are you saying?”
“But… you’re not a Death Eater anymore,” Potter frowned.
“Ok, well there was a song on it, about having a best friend and thinking they weren’t right for you, but then realizing you might be maybe a little bit in love with them? And when I heard it, it kind of hit me, you know? Like I always thought love had to be this huge thing, that it would wallop me over the head and transform my life. It never occurred to me that love could be… everyday, that I might already have it. It didn’t seem possible that I wouldn’t have realized it.”
“Yeah, exactly.” He grinned, “Just like that. Well actually, not
, and he’d only had to hold out for two more days and he’d fucked it up.
“Oh! You saucy little minx—”
Scrawny Ginger Muggle was mocking him, bobbing up and down and singing,
“Excuse me?” Draco spluttered, “We’ve been dating four months; how could you possibly think that question is appropriate?”
“It’s quite a good deal for you, Hermione,” Draco continued undeterred, “You and your future children will be well fed and cared for while you’re busy dragging our entire legal system into a new age of enlightenment.”
He closed his eyes for a moment, tipping his head up. The tempo shifted and slowed, tension building, and he flicked his eyes back open, swaying in time with the bodies beside him, anticipating the violent release. The guitars came crashing back in, the lead singer screamed, and Harry felt his adrenaline spike. In front of him, someone shoved the person standing next to them, and a space opened up on the floor. Immediately, it filled with bodies, people pushing each other
“I mean it!” Blaise exclaimed, hand to his heart. “I need to know if his intentions are pure or if he’s only with you for that fine arse of yours.” He lifted an eyebrow at José across the table, who sputtered into his glass of water.
By the end of February, Harry had started to wonder whether he might need to find another date to Ron and Hermione’s wedding, after all. Draco and José had been dating six weeks and by all accounts it was going well, although José hadn’t been to Grimmauld yet. He lived alone, so he and Draco always went back to his flat. Apparently, that was preferable to a house with a roommate, two cats, and a floo that was liable to shoot friends through without warning at all hours of the day and night. Was Harry, possibly, the teensiest bit offended that José hadn’t asked to come over yet? Possibly. Well, not
“Ron’s going to be so annoyed, he just finalized the seating charts last week.”
Draco hummed, kissing him soundly, and pulled back slightly to say, “You didn’t warn me about your morning breath,” grinning impishly.
Neville rolled his eyes. “Yeah,
“Can’t I?” Ron smirked. “Who’s in?”
A few feet away, Draco’s gaze caught on him and he blushed under the glitter, smiling a little. Harry’s breath caught, and then he had stopped in front of Draco, blinking dumbly with his mouth hanging open and his face getting hot and he finally managed to get out, “Hi,” and immediately wanted to sink into the ground.
, you’ve got something good with this one…” He laughed again, shaky as the low buzzing in his limbs started to fade.
Hermione darted a frown at Ron, then fixed her eyes back on Harry with a sigh. “Alright then. Just, for what it’s worth, I think you’re wrong. You’re not unloveable, or whatever rubbish you're on about. Someone—whether I’m right about it being Draco or not—is going to be over the moon about being with you, baggage and all.” She reached across the table and squeezed his hand briefly.

Merlin,” he gasped, hauling himself off and staggering back against the desk, wiping his hand on his trousers, “what in the ever-loving
, he asked, “Tell me, Harry,
“Yes, yes,” she replied absently, already settling back in place behind her books, inking her quill, “Collect me around half past seven?”
“No,” he said.
Slowly, Draco drew open the black envelope, silent for a heartbeat as his eyes flickered over the tickets inside. Then he let out a hysterical whoop, springing across the blanket and tackling Harry into the grass— “You
), but the friendship he knew was still there too. When the pizza arrived, they set upon it ravenously, and Draco made a terrible joke about having worked up an appetite. The relief Harry felt went bone-deep, that they didn’t have to change, didn’t have to recalibrate who they were together.
He stayed for a few moments, swaying on his feet, catching his breath, and then he slid his arms under Harry’s torso, leaning over to fold himself over Harry’s back, “Are you alright?” he murmured, and Harry nodded, slurring,
When he was ready, and said so, Draco turned to watch as Potter slicked himself and nudged against the entrance to Draco’s body, teasing him again. He had laid his other hand carefully on Draco’s hip, and was absently rubbing his thumb in circles against Draco’s skin. Draco’s chest clenched; he squeezed his eyes shut.
Draco hummed, interlacing their fingers and drawing Harry’s arms closer around him, “Naturally.”
Harry nodded.
. Harry fitted their lips together and breathed into Draco’s lungs. The twin silver rings in Draco’s lower lip pressed into Harry’s mouth. When they pulled apart, Draco held his breath for a moment, eyes closed. Then, he blew a smoke ring directly into Harry’s face.
“More,” he panted, “you can—fuck me—harder—"
She beckoned him frenetically, backing out of his way. “Come on, come on,” the note of anxiety rang clearly in her voice. He stepped into her sitting room.
stop?”
running through Harry’s head. Harry had tried to calm down a bit, these last few weeks, tried to stop staring at Draco all the time. He figured that he had plenty of time to think this through. It wouldn’t do to rush things. About halfway through the set, Motion City Soundtrack played that song, and Harry looked over at Draco, at the tight stretch of his t-shirt across his chest, the arch of his left eyebrow with the silver barbell through it, the jubilant stretch of his mouth as he formed the words
“And how exactly, may I ask, did you think this would be?” Draco’s tone was icy.
Harry sat bolt upright. “He—what? But you seemed so—”
“You were brilliant, mate,” Seamus clapped him on the shoulder, his drink sloshing. “You looked like you were going to heave up at first, but you really pulled it together. I even cried a bit, you know…” he popped a deviled egg into his mouth.
Harry squared his shoulders, pointing at Draco across the room and wiggling his shoulders as his cracking voice rang out, “
“Me, embarrassed? You’re the most shameless—" Harry huffed and turned resolutely back toward Healer Andrade, crossing his arms, “So what’s his recovery looking like?”
“What about best case, then?” Ron continued, “You tell him, he says
“Yes, well, my fears have been put to rest,” Draco smirked, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. “Alright, I’m going to the shower to take care of… this situation,” he gestured at his crotch as he stood up, ambling across the room and sliding the bathroom door open.
Draco smiled helplessly, then frowned, “Well, you didn’t miss me, so if you want to go…”
At eight o’clock, Harry apparated to a dingy alley a few streets away from the venue, tucked his wand away, rolled his shoulders, muttered to himself,
entire subscribing audience. That’s got to count for something.”
José laughed, and Harry wondered how his teeth could possibly be so white. It would probably be rude to ask.
“Me?!” Harry squawked, sitting up indignantly.
“Draco, wait, I—"
, and I want to go home and smoke a bowl and eat chips!”
she positively swelled with indignation—she was a junior editor at Witch Weekly, so she took it a bit personally on top of the insult to Draco’s character—and offered to run an assortment of vicious hit pieces speculating about various aspects of Potter’s personal life. At the end, she sat across from him, knees touching, took his hands in hers, made him say five things he liked about himself, and then take ten deep breaths with his eyes closed. And when he opened them, she told him that it was time to snap out of this funk, no more feeling sorry for himself, she’d be damned if he ruined New Years by moping about pathetically, and frankly, Potter wasn’t worth it, the speccy git, and there were going to be loads of better-looking blokes at Blaise’s that night, so he had better take a shower, for Merlin’s sake.
“Oh—really? Ok, yeah, brilliant. Right then. So, how about the Tornadoes last weekend, eh?”
“First of all, that was literally only one month ago—”
on company property, good god what was wrong with him?
“Somehow I really doubt that,” Ron said, “But alright, let’s play it out. Worst case scenario: you tell him how you feel, he vomits all over you and jumps out the window—”
“What?”
.” He signaled the bartender for a shot, although he felt rather like he was going to be sick. When it came, he downed it and ordered another.
? Nah, I’m going to milk this for all it’s worth—”
“That’s actually the opposite of how this usually goes, you know—"
Harry shook himself and forced a laugh, fisting his hands in his pockets to keep from reaching out.
He tuned back in just in time to hear Potter say, “As you know, I am deeply committed to ensuring that
“Will you really?” Potter shot straight upright, gaping gleefully.
“That’s a euphemism for enjoying my fine arse,” Draco smirked, cheekily biting into a scone, tongue darting out to lick a bit of jam off his top lip.
As usual, Harry noticed when other people’s eyes were on Draco too, which was often. When Draco took him out to the bars in West Hollywood, the looks he got were positively indecent. But Harry didn’t mind, because he was getting a fair bit of attention himself.
She snorted at him, “And yourself, I’d wager.”
“Erm, yeah,” Harry scratched the back of his head, clearing his throat, “Had to make sure Draco made it through the night ok, you know...”

Harry hummed and sat down, raking his hands through his hair and propping his elbows on the counter, resting his chin in his hands. He worked late so often that he had become used to watching Malfoy run through his closing routine. He liked it, watching Malfoy putter around the shop, straightening the merchandise and locking the cases, counting the coins in the register and setting the wards. There was something soothing about Malfoy’s languid movements, the way he hummed along with the music playing softly in the background, swaying as he worked. Malfoy seemed so at ease here in his little shop, so content, and the pride he took in his establishment was obvious in the careful way his long fingers handled everything he touched. Seeing it made Harry feel at ease too, content by proxy, and, if he was honest with himself, a little proud of Malfoy, although Harry didn’t have any right to feel that way. But it made him happy, nonetheless.
Harry scratched Cassie behind the ears. It wouldn’t do to look up at Draco, lest his face reveal how he felt about Draco spending all foreseeable birthdays turning down would-be conquests and slouching on the sofa with Harry at the end of the night.
Harry wanted to find out, but his body wasn’t yet responding to commands, suspended in the amber of half-wakefulness. Draco made a soft noise, blurred with sleep. His arm tightened over Harry’s chest and his hips rocked forward, and the low buzz of
“What?” Ron asked, “Malfoy? what was Malfoy?”
Draco nodded again. “Floo’s in the sitting room, back out the hall on the left.”
“How did you know when I was getting home?” he asked, when they had sat down and were digging into the pasta.
“Pans, I don’t know what to do. He—” Draco dropped his voice to a whisper, “he kept
seem quite relaxed over there with Wood. How long has that been going on?” He was probably being humiliatingly transparent, he knew, but he was too drunk to care.
He was grateful Malfoy had remembered to suggest it once they were down in the pit. The music was so loud, Harry could feel his sternum vibrating. He wanted to thank Malfoy for the suggestion, but he would have had to scream in his face to be heard, and he didn’t really fancy that. Anyways, he was too focused on everything else happening. Malfoy had woven them through the crowd up towards the front of the stage, and now they were packed in close enough that the air felt humid. A slimy, sweaty arm was rubbing up against his, and people kept stepping on his feet. Someone had cheered a little too enthusiastically right as the band came on and sloshed their beer all down Harry’s side.
As they headed back out, Harry asked, “What was that, by the way? With all the—punching? Is that normal?”
He tried to keep the petulant note out of his voice. He probably
Harry looked over at Draco, huffing a disbelieving laugh, “We really cannot get a moment of peace, can we?”
me, and looking at me all soulfully… and… I know I wasn’t imagining it!”
Harry laughed, “I’ve explored! I’ve explored all over Muggle London,” he smirked.
. He slid his palms over Draco’s pale skin, flushed from the heat, flushed from Harry’s hands on him. It was something reverent, bathing Draco, tipping his head back to keep the shampoo out of his eyes like he would a squalling infant, precious and new, holding him up as he washed his feet one at a time, like a crinkled grandparent, dear and familiar. Or at least, that was how Harry had imagined those things would feel like. He had never had a grandparent, never had an infant either, obviously. He hadn’t thought he ever would.
Harry looked up at him, lips parted, waiting.
“I’d shut up with your cock in my mouth—”
Draco couldn’t agree more.
“Listen,” Eric said, “If you want to get out of here when you’ve finished your drink, I don’t live too far… I’ll make it worth your while,” he winked.
Harry padded softly down the stairs early Saturday morning, still in his pyjamas, fists balled in an old Weasley jumper. He followed the sound of the blasting stereo to find Draco in the drawing room, already showered and dressed, shooting cleaning spells in every direction and shouting,
Harry groaned. “Oh Merlin, I—”
“I’m sorry,” he said earnestly, “If I’d had any idea you were being so daft,” he rolled his eyes, “I’d have just asked you out. But you’re very intimidating.”
Harry took a small step forward. “So you’ve thought about it?”
“God,” Harry said, tipping sideways in his chair to knock their shoulders together, “Wouldn’t that be something.”
Harry curled in on himself with a low, pained noise. He knew, theoretically, that he simply might not be able to fix things. But he tried not to think about it. Hermione gently combed through the tangles in his hair.
Draco chuckled, “That’d be the drugs, I think.”
He felt stupid with it, and he looked at Malfoy across the table, blushing so prettily. He looked prettier than Harry had ever seen him, right now. Flushed, biting his lower lip, a few strands of hair coming untucked from his ears, framing his thin, delicate face.
Malfoy turned slowly to look him straight in the eye and brought one finger up, touching the tip of it gently against Harry’s nose.
“The song, It Had to Be You—you told me it reminded you of me, and then it made me think about you, and I just started to wonder? And I couldn’t stop. I’ve been trying to figure out how to tell you since I kissed you at the concert.”
Ron and Hermione waved him off. Harry remained stricken for a few seconds, looking at the table, trying to stem the tide of panic rising in his throat. “I need a drink too,” he muttered numbly, and pushed himself up, legs wooden as he stumbled off.
“I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think you’d be a good sport,” he grinned, “You’ve got to back me up and tell Pansy I did it, now, she owes me fifty galleons.”
“Please,” Draco fluttered his eyelashes, “Call me Draco.”
. He still had those sharp, haughty features that made Harry’s fingers itch, but even sitting he looked taller than Harry remembered, and there was something in the set of his face, the jut of his jaw, something sure, something mutinous. His white-blond hair was spiked up, his piercing grey eyes were ringed in smudgy black, and his left eyebrow was pierced— it was all certainly
“Thanks…” he said soft, a question.
Harry Potter desperately wanted Draco Malfoy to be his friend. He could hardly believe it himself—Malfoy, of all people. Of course, Harry had known that Malfoy had changed after the war, everyone knew that, but Harry still hadn’t expected to want to be his
So, he knew what Harry would feel like when they saw it live. They stood together, hand in hand as the music swelled, and when it crested Draco threw their arms in the air, and together they shouted
'Alive With the Glory of Love' by Say Anything is the song Draco is singing when Harry walks in on him cleaning
“Hah!” He crowed, “I got you!”
He began to laugh.
Harry flicked a piece of bacon at him. “Piss off. I just don’t see why I should be fussed about being a bit short? Like, I’ve never known any other way of being.” He shrugged, then grinned rakishly, “I suppose Draco’s right, I do think I’m extremely fit.”
Draco flushed, wiping his fingers on his napkin and pursing his lips, “Well… You know I’m an accomplished Occlumens. And occlumency is about guarding your thoughts from others, yes, but it can also be about guarding them from yourself.”
fix Harry with a very suspicious look. But that couldn’t be helped.
Hermione took a sip of wine. “And what will you do, when Draco moves out to have babies with someone else?”
Draco whipped around, cheeks slightly pink. “Could you pick up the pastries? I’ve called in our order at Laughlin’s, it should be ready by ten.”
Harry slumped over the bar, steadily draining his drink. As he slurped at the ice, he felt a hand on his back.
“Alright,” Malfoy placed one into his own mouth, “They should take about 20 minutes to hit. Do you need anything?”
“You said you wouldn’t laugh!”
Harry turned his face in toward Draco’s shoulder, closed his eyes, breathed in, breathed out. Then he looked back out over the ocean, relentless, constant, boundless; he felt the breeze on his face, cool and crisp.
“I dunno what game you’re talking about,” Potter gasped, breathless, “but I think I’m winning right about now, wouldn’t you say—” and he was still
“All the bad things—"
“Turn it… down?”
“Oh,” Malfoy frowned, “lab rabbit sounds much more fun.”
“But if we’re doing this…”
“Well, what do you want from me? It’s not like I don’t want to date anyone, I do—” he swallowed.
“Er, ok?”
The man flagged down the bartender and turned back to Harry, extending his hand. “I’m Eric,” he said.
The first Friday of October, they went to see Motion City Soundtrack at the Astoria, one of their favorite venues in London. They’d been listening to the new album non-stop for the past three weeks, the question,
Harry sidled up behind him as he was waiting for the water to heat up, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and tucking his head over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco reached for the speaker on the side table and a moment later Harry heard a high, clear voice, belting out,
He never treated any of his scars. Never used any of the spells or salves made for erasing. He said scars looked badass, and he had a lot of them. Keloid ridges and shiny burn splotches, puckered folds and delicate silvery lines. And in between all the scar tissue, tattoos. Black runes littered his torso, spiky hawthorn branches traced beneath his collarbones, crossing under his clavicle. Ink curled around his thighs, crept up his spine, settled between his shoulder blades. There were hardly a few unbroken inches of smooth, pale skin anywhere on his body; but the sleeve on his left arm was Harry’s favorite. The mark was still there, faded and dull amid the flames devouring it and climbing all the way up to his shoulder. The colors were vibrant, intense, shades and shadows shaping the flames into slavering, majestic creatures, and at the apex, a phoenix rising from the fire. It was heavy handed, Draco always said, rolling his eyes at his younger self, his first tattoo. But it was an exquisite piece and Draco always showed it off. He showed off all his ink, and all his scars, and he was sure to be happy with this new scar, too. Harry smiled to himself as Healer Andrade filled Draco in on the details of his care plan.
Harry huffed a fond laugh, kissing his way to Draco’s ear and whispering in it, “Turn over, I want to fuck you.”
The food was indeed fantastic, the hors d’oeuvres and then the dinner and then the cake, which Molly had made, a towering confection iced in white and gold, each layer a different flavor. Harry found himself ravenous after the sudden departure of his nerves, and Draco had to restrain him from taking third helpings of everything, protesting that he was going to ruin the line of his dress robes and they hadn’t even taken any photos together yet. So after dinner, they wrangled Dean to get a few shots of them by the arch, and next to the remnants of the cake, and under the garlands Harry had helped pick out at Neville’s greenhouse.
Draco swiveled around to look him straight in the eye. “Was it?” he asked coolly.
He felt Harry’s hand wrap around his chest, Harry’s nose along the back of his neck, breath hot as he whispered, “Yeah, like that.”
“I’m sorry I was always provoking you, I—"
When Draco went to use the loo, he mused to himself that it felt like they’d been talking for hours, at which point he realized they
“Shut up, Potter,” he hissed.
His fingers shook as he turned to page 17, where he was greeted by another large photo of Harry, wearing a hand-knitted jumper in Gryffindor red, with a wobbly golden snitch stitched on the front. This photo looked candid—Harry’s eyes flicked down at his lap and then up as he ducked his head, blushing and smiling shyly. Draco simply stared at it for a few moments before remembering with a frantic start that there was a whole article attached, which he immediately began scanning feverishly. It was a standard self-discovery fluff piece; Pansy knew her job and she did it well. He found the passage about midway through:
,” Draco snickered, tipping his glass.
“It’s alright, Harry,” he smiled softly, squeezing his hand, “Only one of us needed to be brave.”
“I know it’s soon!” Harry stuttered, suddenly unsure, tripping over his words, “It’s just, we’re going to be wrapping up the Sullivan case and we'll finish cataloguing the artifacts from the Esteban estate all within the next few weeks and it’s the perfect time to take a break; you know, once we take on some new projects, Merlin knows how long it’ll be until we can take a few weeks off, and—”
At home, Harry went straight for the liquor cabinet, skipping dinner. He poured himself a tumbler of scotch, then another, then another. His head swam, and there was a dull ache growing behind his eyes. He sat at his desk and took out a quill and parchment.
Oh fuck, he was definitely going to fuck something up. The room tilted around him as he stumbled toward the toilet.
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry!” He grimaced, scrambling up, showing his hands, “Pansy dared me—”
“Harry! Don’t interrupt, for goodness sakes—I just want to tell you how I’m feeling! I’ve got to make you understand!”
“Yeah,” Greg chortled, smirking, “Good thing we don’t smoke very much either then, eh?”
“I wish,” Luna began, her lilting voice sending a pleasant tingle down Harry’s spine, “I wish for you two to look within, to recognize how deeply and completely you already love each other,” Harry swallowed. Luna sounded pretty serious. “I wish you the strength to consider the source of your fears and doubts, and to face them. And of course, once you do that, I wish you a lifetime of joy together.”
, and Draco hummed in acknowledgment, said,
He felt the muscles of Draco’s stomach clench as he said “God, Harry, ok, yeah.” He rolled over and stretched out, long and languid and content, and Harry pressed alongside him, kissed his shoulder blades, rutted against his hip.
Draco followed him into the kitchen, setting upon the panang and kee mao with relish.
Malfoy? Harry turned around to find that Malfoy had stopped a few paces earlier and was standing in front of a door, swaying slightly and smiling at Harry.
again, moving closer, and their noses bumped together, glanced off so they were cheek to cheek, and Harry was surrounded by the patchouli and vanilla scent of Malfoy’s shop; his body was reacting as it always did, relaxing further, and he sighed and turned his open mouth into the hinge of Malfoy’s jaw, dragged his lips back toward Malfoy’s, kissed him, lush and warm. He was there for a moment, an eternity, before another question welled up inside him, urgent, uninhibited.
, Harry, fuck me
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry swayed a little in his seat; his mouth wouldn’t stop smiling, “How about that I just had some kind of fucking,” he dropped his voice to a whisper, “
date.”
'Welcome to the Black Parade' by My Chemical Romance is the song mentioned at the concert/the single Harry and Draco listen to when it first gets released
“Ah yes,” Ron nodded sagely, holding the door open for Harry. “I know all about that.”
“It’s certainly a… tangible reminder of how far I’ve come on my own personal journey along the moral arc of the universe. So, maybe a bit weird sure, but it’s positive.”
Walking away, he held the shirt up to his torso, a bounce in his step. Malfoy side-eyed him, laughing, “Well, Potter, are you going to thank me? First I introduce you to music, now I’m revolutionizing your wardrobe—what’s next, do you think I might be able to fix your hair?” Harry elbowed him, said he liked his hair how it was just fine, thank you very much.
When Harry’s movements above him grew increasingly frantic, Draco grabbed his wrists, bringing his hands around his back again. Harry arched his back, gasping and flushing.
Up on the Auror Department Level, Draco checked the memo again—he was looking for Conference Room 12F. The bullpen was deserted save the unlucky Junior Aurors on night duty; only a few lights were on in the offices lining the perimeter. No one stopped him as he headed toward the back and down the hall with the conference rooms, to 12F at the end. It was empty. Draco stepped inside, willing the irritation away. The light was on, after all. Perhaps whoever had summoned him here was just running a little late. Draco settled into a chair. Surely, some brawny, pea-brained specimen would be walking in any moment now, asking Draco some excruciating question about whether Unspeakables could detect future crime patterns, or some other such rubbish.
Rueful, he admitted as much to Draco, who called him a hopeless buffoon and summed his notes from upstairs. Then, Draco made him practice the lines over and over, for near two hours, until he had every word memorized, until he could say it all with his eyes closed, until he could say it all without crying. By then it was time to head to the Burrow. They needed to arrive early to put the finishing touches on the wards, and then of course Molly was sure to rope them into some other last-minute preparations.
“Although,” she cocked her head thoughtfully, “I wouldn’t have expected you to leap right into things with a bunch of strangers Harry,” her eyes crinkled, “you’re such a romantic.”
Draco cleared his throat. “I don’t think you’re a psychopath, Harry. I— I may have been engaging in some, ah, shall we say, self-protective mental gymnastics…”
“Goodness, does anyone ever tell you you’re like an old married couple?”
Draco shook his head, laughing, “No, Harry, I meant
, and suggesting that a pub night might be good for his nerves. Harry couldn’t think of any excuse, despite his firm conviction that it would only make things worse, which was how he found himself crammed into a booth at The Hawthorn and Holly with all their friends. It wasn’t that great, feeling vindicated, he thought as he sucked down yet another gin and tonic, eyeing Draco from across the room. He was chatting up some bloke at the bar, gesturing vividly as the other man laughed and called the bartender over for another shot. Harry had been watching Draco all night as he flitted about, carefree as anything, perfectly oblivious of the turmoil going on in Harry’s brain.
? Even Draco, who was probably the best-looking person Harry knew, mused that he had forgotten what it was like to be immersed in a culture fully organized around the relentless pursuit of aesthetic perfection. Yet somehow, even in a city of leggy blondes with carved-out cheekbones, Draco still managed to stand out. Harry thought it must be because everyone here was so deeply tanned that Draco, always finding a way to be contrary, was the brightest point in any room, his pale luminescence like a lighthouse in the sea. Everywhere they went, Harry’s eyes were drawn to him, to the ever-present pink sunburn on the bridge of his nose, to the wistful crinkle in his eyes when he recounted a fond memory, to the purposeful strides of his stark white legs, visible because, driven by the heat, he was actually wearing
Malfoy closed his eyes and drew in a long breath, and then, with the air of explaining something very simple to a small child, he said, “Potter, this is punk rock.”
“I wish Harry and Draco would finally shag,” Ron declared.
“This is good,” he said.
The first week, Harry went by Draco’s office, but the door was closed and the window shuttered. He couldn’t bring himself to knock. Obviously, Draco didn’t want to see him. Harry spotted him a few times—across the cafeteria or the atrium, down a hallway—but when Draco noticed him approaching he turned swiftly and walked away. Finally, Harry spied him in line for the floos at the end of the day. They always used to chat for a few minutes when they ran into each other there, stepping out of line and waving their colleagues forward. Hope tingled in his fingers as he quickened his stride. “Draco!” he called out, smiling hesitantly, reaching out to touch his arm—and Draco turned towards him, paused, pulled his arm away, nodded curtly, “Potter,” and disappeared into the flames.
Draco hummed in agreement, closing his eyes as he curled his tongue around the spoon.
been talking for hours, and that stopped him in his tracks. Sure, he and Potter had interacted plenty over the past few years, mostly at Ministry functions, but they’d certainly never spent an entire evening alone together, and on Christmas no less. As if they were friends, or something. Draco was surprised that they were getting on so well; he couldn’t imagine that Potter had expected it either. And then Draco got back to the bar, and Potter abruptly drained his drink, cleared his throat loudly and said, “So. You’re gay.”
But they’d already done it, for each other.
Harry buried his head under the pillow and Draco ripped it off and flung it away, belting out,
It had been a good year. Harry was quite happy to usher in the new one wrapped up in Draco’s arms, out in the garden at Grimmauld again. They were all back under Hermione’s stargazing bubble, getting cheerfully smashed and counting down the minutes to midnight. He twisted his face around, tilting his chin up for a kiss. Draco tightened his arms, obliging, murmuring in his ear, “You’re very affectionate tonight.”
José stared at him a moment, then looked at Draco questioningly, eyes twinkling. “I appreciate that, Harry, but I think Draco should be the one to invite me, no?”
Draco Malfoy liked to come to the Leaky Cauldron when he was feeling sappy, or lonely (or sometimes both). The fact that he, only a little more than four years after the War, could walk up to the bar and make polite small talk with old Tom over a tumbler of Ogden’s finest was, he felt, nothing short of a miracle. Of course, he’d done his utmost to be accepted back into the fold, and to deserve it too. But sometimes he needed a reminder that it was real. So when he felt the doubts creep in, he came to the center of wizarding London, to remind himself that he belonged. Usually it was enough. But tonight was Christmas Eve, and Draco was feeling especially lonely. He should have been in Paris with his mum, who’d fucked off there and never looked back after her house arrest lifted three years ago. He usually spent the holidays with her. But this year, in a fit of sentimentality, he’d wanted to spend Christmas in London. He’d thought he wouldn’t have minded being alone, that he would enjoy the season as a spectator, soaking up everyone else’s good cheer by osmosis. He’d been extremely, colossally wrong.
. Draco, on the other hand, loved to dip into his prior skin like this, to try on what could have been and discard it when he walked out at the end of the night. Once he had told Harry, whispering low in his ear,
Ron frowned. “Our wedding? Witnessing the power of true love?”
Harry was frozen in place. Was he a coward? He thought again about the way Draco had wrapped around him, nosing along the back of his neck and murmuring
Harry topped off his champagne flute from the bottle bobbing in the air next to Draco’s head.
Happy Christmas, Harry.”
“No, you don’t get it—” He shook his head, swallowed. “Just because you’re always on us about getting together, and just because I might have realized some things, doesn’t mean that Draco’s going to magically wake up and be in love with me or something. It’s the same between us as it’s always been... Just, a bit trickier for me now, I guess. That’s what I need advice on. I decided I want to tell him. I want to see if he’s interested, but I keep chickening out and I don’t know why.”
I know this is mostly an ode to pop-punk, but the mid-2000s were also, in my humble opinion, a golden age for hip-hop, so I was psyched to throw it back for that club scene...
“Well that’s hardly fair, I haven’t heard from you either—”
Draco raised a brow. “Really, Harry? You can’t wait to give me… a card? Did you include a voucher with your promise to pay for my birthday dinner?”
“That’s… a bit intimidating.”
“Oh stop

they all were, and Draco muttered, “I told you they have no boundaries,” and José laughed, white teeth bared.
His eyes caught on Draco and José across the table, who seemed to be having an intimate moment, José whispering something in Draco’s ear and Draco lowering his lids and blushing furiously. He couldn’t hide anything with that complexion. Harry smiled fondly into his drink.
had been—Draco suppressed a shiver.
, “The singer’s name is Rick something, I’m actually not sure why it’s called rick
Draco blinked. And then, before he could think better of it, he leaned in, extending a hand, “Come back to mine?”
“Dammit, Hermione,” Harry groaned, “I’m not denying—I’ve got no feelings, I tell you—no feelings!” Sighing, he turned to Draco. “Alright, it’s all on you now—sabotage the collective or bust.”
Before they left, Pansy had warned Harry about the high concentration of models, aspiring models, and generally fit people in Los Angeles.
“Well, this is lovely, isn’t it?” Luna beamed at Harry and Draco.
Upstairs, they shrugged out of their pajamas, and Harry drew Draco down on top of him, kissing him sweetly and arching up into him. “Draco,” he breathed, “I want— if you want to— I want you to fuck me.”
, for Merlin’s sake—"
“Really? You can’t? When you two are all handsy with each other, snogging and all?”
“And what, leave you here?”
“To 2008,” he said, raising his glass.
“Please,” Harry sighed, “Enlighten me.”
Draco had transfigured some old shirts to look like the Black Parade uniforms. He was creative like that, with the outfits. Last fall, they’d gone to see AFI at Carling Academy Brixton and Draco had leaned fully into the
Her brows knit together, hawklike, “You really needn’t pretend, I know
“Ok, it’s—” Harry ran a hand through his hair, “When Motion City Soundtrack put out their new album—”
On Friday evening, Harry grabbed a couple bottles of wine from the cellar and headed to Ron and Hermione’s. Draco had been getting ready for his date when Harry left—he had begged Harry for help, throwing on and removing outfits with increasing frenzy until Harry sat him down and made him wear the silver-grey silk shirt with skinny black trousers. He looked fantastic, of course. The shirt brought out his eyes and the glinting silver of the rings in his lip and the barbell through his eyebrow. Harry imagined José, with his strong, clean-shaven jaw and neatly parted hair, picking up Draco, with his snakebites and black nail polish. He grinned to himself as he threw the powder into the flames.
“No,” Potter responded, “No, you’re— good, it’s just, you know, I haven’t done this before? And I don’t want to make an arse of myself, I meant what I said before—” he looked down, chewing his lower lip for a moment before forcing his gaze back up, “You can tell me what to do, a bit, if that would be—”
stare at you all the time.”
“I’ve always said it—”
—” his hips chased Draco’s fingers, grinding down. Draco dipped lazily back in, barely brushing against Harry’s prostate and withdrawing again, circling his rim, and Harry bowed back taut, arms flexing behind him. He looked so beautiful, flushed and panting, holding himself like an offering in Draco’s lap.
Potter was technically his employee and Draco had just
“Fair enough,” Ron grinned at him as they stepped off the pavement where Harry had parked his motorbike, “And who knows, you’re the one who said you might find your own hot healer?” Harry made a noncommittal noise as Ron clapped him on the shoulder. “Thanks for coming with me tonight, mate. I think we did good work.” Ron drew him into a one-armed hug and apparated away.

Beside him, Draco tilted the rest of his drink back and slid out from the edge of the booth.
“Oh my god, yes you are,” Harry brought his hand back up to Draco’s face, cradling his cheek, “I could look at you all the time…” he laughed, “I already
“It’s lab
Draco clinked their glasses together.
“Don’t you have anywhere to be tonight?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened and Harry heard him take in a sharp breath, as if he were in pain.
Draco groaned dramatically, throwing a hand over his eyes, hiding his smile. He was a frightful cuddler too. When he first moved into Grimmauld, Harry had tiptoed into Draco’s bedroom one night, hands fisted in the hem of his worn t-shirt, bleary-eyed and shaking. Draco had blinked, rasped out, “Nightmare?” And, without waiting for a response, turned down the sheets next to him. Harry had slipped in and Draco had immediately thrown an arm over his chest, murmured, “It’s alright… it’s over, it’s over,” and promptly fallen back asleep. Harry had laid there, snug under Draco’s arm as his muscles slowly unlocked, his heartbeat returned to normal. After that, they never hesitated to sneak into each other’s beds when the nights got bad.
album with the windows thrown open. Draco came storming in, banging open the doors of the liquor cabinet with a flick of his wrist, zooming a bottle of scotch and two tumblers into his waiting fingers, sweeping across the room and kicking Harry’s legs off, plopping himself down in their place. He unscrewed the bottle, pouring two generous measures and levitating one over to Harry. Harry took a cautious sip, peering over the rim of his glass as Draco knocked back half his tumbler in one. Draco shuddered, letting out a low, raw sort of noise before bringing the glass back up, sipping it quietly once, twice, as he sighed softly, deflating a little bit into the cushions.
,” he said, grinning, grinding his hips in slow circles.
“Oh yes,” Pansy grinned wickedly, “That would be great fun, seeing as
“I charged this to your Gringotts account, you know,” he called out, sly and smug.
“Isn’t it a bit early to be thinking about that?”
“Oh,” he exhaled, “This is much softer than the wall. I don’t think I’ve ever felt something so soft.”
“Yeah,” Harry shifted back and forth on his heels. “Yeah, it probably was, but, erm, I really— I really liked it…”
“Quite,” Draco nodded. “And I realized I wasn’t interested in hiding that way. I didn’t want to sneak around and come home to a wife. I wanted to come home to someone I loved properly.” As he said it, he felt the sharp stab of the knowledge that he probably still would never have that. He sighed, “I suppose I’m a hopeless romantic.”
But Cassie was lovely, despite her insistence on torturing Harry at his lowest—she was soft and sweet, with a bottomless appetite for affection—so pretty much like Draco in that way, too. She woke him up again, a bit later, nuzzling at his neck. Sighing, Harry resigned himself to the day ahead—the sun was already streaming in through the gaps in his curtains. He stretched hesitantly, hissing at the throbbing in his head and ache in his muscles. Flopping over, he reached for the vial of hangover potion Draco had set out for him yesterday, downing it with a grateful moan. It wasn’t industrial strength, what Draco brewed, but it was a damn sight cheaper than what they could buy at the apothecary, and it took the edge off well enough for Harry to haul himself out of bed and limp into the shower.
“Ok but mate, this is bloody hilarious you have to admit—"
“Do you think this is going to be it then?”
“Uh, yeah? If you don’t mind?”
Draco pursed his lips and smiled, “Alright then, good luck I suppose, and good night.”
“What about sixty-nine?” Seamus called out, snagging a champagne bottle from the air and taking a hearty swig.
Harry took a puff, closing his eyes as the interstitial spaces of his body released, shoulders melting down his back.
Draco challenged Harry to a hike that he had done once before, right off of Highway 1, the route they’d driven up the coast.
“Well, he might not!”
Once Harry had gotten home, after showering off the sweat and spilled beer, he tried on the shirt. It wasn’t particularly soft, or particularly high quality, but it felt good. It was his. He wore it to work on Monday and Malfoy ducked his head and grinned when he saw it, and then he asked how the rest of Harry’s weekend had been.
, he had said,
It had been three months since Harry had seen Malfoy, which, by his calculations, meant they were overdue for a run-in. It’s not that Harry had
interested,” his eyes twinkled.
Draco nosed his hair lazily, humming, “What’s this? Did you miss me?”
“It’s not a schtick!”
Potter rolled his eyes, groaning. “And you, you go about shagging muggles in loos?” Potter asked. “I truly never saw that coming.” He laughed, then sobered. “Does that ever feel… I don’t know, weird?”
Harry swallowed down a spark of warmth creeping through his chest and up his throat. “Right.”
Just last week, he had been with Ron to the tailor for a robe fitting (they had brought Draco too, who was really the only useful one in that situation). And Harry had insisted that he and Draco handle all the wards themselves. The wedding would be outside at the Burrow, of course, and Harry and Draco would be spending an entire day warding the property, keying in every individual guest and keeping everyone else out. The media had been frothing at the mouth for years awaiting this wedding, and reporters were liable to be camped out along the borders, hoping to catch a glimpse of guests on their way in or out. Harry didn’t trust their privacy with anyone else. For Britain, this was the War Hero Wedding, but for him, it was the first two people he had ever felt truly at home with, making a home with each other. Once, he had said that to Ginny and Luna, quietly and a little tipsy, and Ginny had smacked him in the arm and said
Draco’s eyes narrowed, scanning across the bar. “Fucking wanker. He’s still over in the corner—shall I hex him?”
Eric blanched, “Oh, alright then—”
“Alright well if you’re just going to shout at me—”
So when Draco mentioned offhand that he and José were going on a double date with Ron and Hermione, just the four of them, Harry swallowed down the roil in his stomach and said
He thought of them in this big old house, doing everything together, alone together. And then he heard the singer croon:
in Malfoy’s flat before. He restrained himself just in time.
Draco’s eyes snapped up. “Yes, I can see that, I just… Los Angeles?” He frowned, scanning the page, “Departing in two and a half weeks? Harry, what?”
Draco pushed out of the booth next to him, draining his drink, “I think I need to be more intoxicated for this.”
“Believe me when I say truly, I have never been better. If you don’t want to that’s okay, though,” Harry said, although secretly he didn’t feel like it would be okay at all. In fact he was quite certain he would be completely and utterly heartbroken—
He positioned himself and sank down, pinning Harry’s hands by his head and setting a punishing pace.
a drink,” and headed back to the bar.
Draco let out a strangled moan, and tipped them up, pulling Harry off him and bending him over, his limbs loose and easy. And when Draco nudged at his entrance he made a pitiful, choked sound, and tilted his hips up, offering himself to Draco, and it was almost too much to bear. Draco seized his hips and pushed in, fucking him hard, and Harry cried out, arms drawn in toward his chest, fingers flexing. And Draco couldn’t stand seeing it—Harry, who he had wanted for years, who had been so galling, so infuriating, now so pliant beneath his hands, letting Draco fuck him into oblivion, just
“Good. Ron made ziti. They grilled me about why I haven’t dated anyone since Meg… do you know it’s already been like a year and a half since I dated Meg?”
Dean frowned, “Are you—is something going on with you and Draco?”
After they had listened to the most cathartic breakup songs and drank a fiscally irresponsible amount of the Talisker, Draco shoved Harry onto the sofa and tucked his back up against Harry’s chest and demanded that Harry brush his hair until he was soothed. Harry, running his fingers through the fringe flopping across Draco’s forehead, felt horribly, selfishly happy. He didn’t want to feel it, the small bubble of relief in his chest. He wanted to be a better friend, a better person. But he was drunk, and Draco was his again, Harry’s limbs wrapped all around him. Harry could feel him breathing slow, and a little whisper eased through his chest,
Draco huffed, rolling his eyes and bending back over his desk.
“D’you hear that? The power of the communal intention,” Hermione poked Harry, grinning, “Our wishes are going to form a commune…” she gestured with her champagne flute, hiccupping, “a wish kibbutz, if you will…” she turned her face into Ron’s chest, dissolving into helpless laughter.
“Pick me up another round then?” Harry grinned at him, “Since you’re still buying.”
Draco leaned around Harry, fixing Ron with what he probably thought was an imperious stare, but his eyes kept slipping around his face.
“Ready?” He asked.
big an idiot of himself for Draco, it would certainly be worth her time to get to know him better. So they sent Glenlivet off with a note after dinner, retiring in front of the fireplace with another bottle of wine.
the words, practicing them, his anxiety spiked so uncontrollably that he inevitably stuffed it back down and thought,
Harry’s head snapped up. He considered the shirt again—deep blood red with black and silver lettering. Could he wear that? He suppressed a small shiver of excitement and fished out a few extra notes.
(Draco had, perhaps, gone a little overboard for Harry’s thirtieth last year.)
He mouthed his way up Draco's body, snuggled into the familiar contours of his chest, and drew the duvet up over them both.
—he heard himself make a distressed sound, a high panting whine, and that was a relief because maybe Draco would hear him and realize that he was paralyzed, and he would know what to do like he always did. Everything would be ok, if Draco could hear him; he would take care of him, Harry just
Draco laughed outright. “Well, not
Ron snorted, “It’s obvious why, innit? You’re a bloody idiot and you’re actually scared he might not feel the same way.”
“Oh… I er, didn’t know that, actually? Sorry, I won’t—”
Potter wrapped his arms around Draco’s torso and lifted him upright, back flush against Potter’s chest. Intertwining their fingers, he braced Draco’s hands against the wall above the headboard and thrust in again, a little harder. Draco gasped and whined, and Potter wrapped an arm around his chest, nuzzling into the crook between his neck and shoulder.
“Much?” Bones put in archly, “I’ll believe it when you buy the next round.” She winked at him.
, and he must simply find it funny, for reasons Draco didn’t understand and didn’t care to examine. It hurt a bit, actually, that Potter had chosen to inflict this particular joke on Draco, when Draco was so helplessly attracted to him. It made him sharp—tense and cold around Potter, which only seemed to spur him on further. And he was so guileless, Draco couldn’t even blame him; he was still so
“Are you sure?” José was looking between them, an amused glint in his eye, “This isn’t all just some elaborate plot to seduce me as a third?”
Draco came out after a couple of minutes, swaddled in his own robe, cheeks pink and hair damp. He pressed a hot mug of tea into Harry’s stiff fingers. Harry blew on it gratefully, letting the steam cloud his glasses. Draco bumped their shoulders together, and Harry leaned into his side. He didn’t need to say anything.
“Woah, woah, Malfoy, what are you doing?” Potter showed his palms, frowning, as though he genuinely had no idea why Draco wasn’t laughing too.
— “You are, aren’t you, you absolute
He waggled his eyebrows, “Come on, we won, don’t you want to celebrate?”
“Hermione mentioned that we’ve had an extremely stressful week in the Department, did she?” Potter nodded. “Therefore you thought, just when we’ve
Harry gasped into it, pressing their bodies flush. Draco’s lips were familiar; the fit of their faces together, the feeling of his breath—it was nothing new. Harry knew the outlines of his body, the ways they slotted together on the sofa, waltzed around the kitchen, pressed together at the foot of a stage. He had thought that he already knew how Draco would feel, how he would make him feel. Well. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d been an arrogant fool.
Harry dropped his face into his hands, cheeks burning, “Oh my
He sipped his beer, half-listening as Potter droned on about the number of scholarships they were hoping to fund this year, wistfully contemplating the hair on Potter’s forearms and the neat flick of his wrist as he turned to the next sheaf of parchment.
Draco finally sat up. He wanted to ask,
, she had said before she began chanting, so Harry couldn’t really blame her. He loved Reading when it stormed, everyone slick and uninhibited, the rain cool on his skin. Then again, he loved Reading when it was dry too, so he wasn’t complaining.
“That…” Harry said slowly, “that wasn’t my wish.”
, Draco told him,
Draco elbowed him, a gentle nudge, “Don’t be silly,” he replied, “You’ve taken me, don’t you remember?”
Neville shrugged. “Greg asked him what he thought about it. Said it was the best gift anyone had ever given him. And then he told Greg not to tell anyone he said that, on pain of death. So don’t tell him I told you.”
“So,” Ethel started up again once Draco was situated, “How long have you two been together?”
Draco snorted. Harry pressed a kiss to his sternum, lifting his head to grin cheekily at Draco as he skated a hand down Draco’s chest and then, lower— “it’s just, I’m always impatient to see what my presents are, Christmas morning.”
girls, and
Harry gave it to him slowly—a second finger, and then a third, stretching him open even though he was already loose and relaxed, dripping with Harry’s saliva.
anything that could risk it. So, I just... didn’t.” He shrugged. “Still a coward, deep down, even after all these years.”
In a small town called Carmel-by-the-Sea they walked the hilly streets, stepping in and out of posh clothing shops and art galleries. They went into a shop that only sold extravagant, handmade hats—Draco tried on top hats and bowlers, newsboy caps and even a fedora, while Harry laughed and snapped his photo on the small camera they’d brought and charmed to look muggle. Afterwards they stopped into a squat, thatched-roof shop called the Cottage of Sweets and gorged themselves on fresh fudge, filling bags with licorice and gummies and chocolate truffles. They ordered tea from a small café and took it outside, blowing the steam up in the cool air. And of course, they flagged down a muggle passerby to take their photo next to the Ocean Avenue street sign, waving and grinning, shopping bags in their hands, arms slung round each other’s shoulders.
.” He flicked the soap suds from his fingers at Harry’s triumphant smirk.
feeling sorry for myself when he would hang out with José instead of me, but that wasn't it, no.”
“Right then,” he turned back to Harry. “Any ideas?”
Draco, grinning maniacally, fisted his hands in the font of Harry’s shirt and hauled him up, smashing their mouths together once, twice, pulling back, staring Harry right in the eyes and still looking a bit deranged, he said, “God, I fucking love you.”
And then they would misunderstand, and look at him strangely, and he would have to say that he could barely stand to see Draco getting the one thing Harry wanted most in the world. Worse than being in love with his best friend, or his best friend's boyfriend, he would have to confess that he was a selfish prick who was too focused on his own loneliness to feel anything for anyone.
, and stayed very still as Harry brought his free hand up to brush across the material covering Malfoy’s chest.
Harry headed into the parlor, the one with the French doors opening onto the garden. Setting the plates on the coffee table, he summoned a few blankets onto the sofa, lit a fire in the grate. By the time he turned around Draco was in the doorway, drinks in hand, ambling toward the sofa and folding himself in the blankets.
After, when the band had packed up and the lights had turned on, they stopped by the rickety merch table in the back. Harry wanted a CD to add to his burgeoning collection, and as he was picking it up, his eyes caught on the display of t-shirts pinned up to a wall of wire grating behind the table.
The week before the Ministry closed for the Holidays, Draco worked grueling hours, getting ahead on all his projects so he could take two full weeks off without any niggling guilt. He didn’t see Harry all week, and he hated to admit that he’d gotten used to sending interoffice memos back and forth to arrange times to fuck or have a drink after work, or, usually, both.
A fist smashed into his face.
He cleared his throat. “Right then. Can we talk about something else? How about you two and your happy, successful relationship?”
“Oh, leave him alone!” Draco threw an arm around José’s shoulders, pressed a kiss to his cheekbone. “José is very health-conscious, you know, it’s probably why his skin looks better than all of yours.”
When they had shown up arm in arm, tattoos and piercings on display, hair sideswept and spiked, muggle suits pressed, the media and assembled guests had gone wild. There had been an absolute firestorm when the tabloids had gotten word of the fact that Harry was bi a few years back, but he had always refused to comment on his personal life and had never taken a date to one of these events. So, the fact that he was making his debut with a man, a man who happened to be Draco Malfoy... well, it was a bombshell. (Harry might have conveniently left out that they were there as friends, just to fuck with Rita Skeeter specifically.) Harry had smirked all night and given a speech on the importance of tolerance and open-mindedness in all corners of wizarding society. After that, he took Draco as his date to any fancy event, and Draco did the same.
“Drink?” Malfoy asked, and Harry responded, “Merlin, yes.”
Harry laughed, “Open the white one first.”
and jumps you—best tell him in private, I think—then you shag and it’s glorious and you’re in love, et cetera. Pretty good, yeah?”
Pansy raised her eyebrows expectantly, and Draco busied himself tearing off a bite of croissant and spreading jam on it. He popped it in his mouth and chewed slowly, swallowed. He looked up.
Another nod. Dropping his hand, he walked back and sank into his desk chair, fingers steepled, knees spread.
“It’s nothing, just—long week,” Harry replied, but he was just on the other side of too drunk to stop his eyes sliding over toward Draco, flirting with that bloke who, Harry couldn’t help but notice, had very nicely sculpted arm muscles.
“Harry! I didn’t even hear you come in; I’m reading the most fascinating case…”
“We’re going to a muggle film. Something about the pursuit of happiness? Except happiness is misspelled? That’s important, I think. José said it’s been well-reviewed.”
Finally, no more Potter. No more Potter showing up late for Friday morning team meetings, dashing in with his jumper crooked and his hair on end, a half-eaten energy bar in hand. No more Potter rolling his eyes and signing off on whatever papers Draco shoved under his nose without reading them, then storming into his office two days later insisting that he would never have agreed to that photo shoot with
Harry burst out laughing. “I’m sorry Draco, I know I probably shouldn’t be laughing right now, but that’s just—”
have a boyfriend and
, and Draco looked down at him, exhilarated, lit up by the stage.
At one point, Draco remembered with a start that it was Christmas Eve,
“My point stands,” Ron continued, “That the two of you have been disturbingly handsy since you got together—”
Draco laughed, bright and wonderous, he said, “You’re taking me to California!”
, Draco had sighed.
“Ah…” Harry trailed off, realizing that the messy bit had been him leaving the way he did.
Draco grinned down at him, “That’s called a mosh pit. And yes, it’s quite common.”
“Rickrolling you,” said Potter, with a shit-eating grin that Draco wanted to punch right off his stupid, square-jawed face.
Ron leaned forward conspiratorially, “Harry shagged someone a while back and didn’t tell us for ages and then he got all clammed up about it,” he rolled his eyes, “I mean, it’s not like we’ve been best mates for twelve years or anything, must have really been a disaster—”
His ministrations were interrupted by the soft chiming of the curtain bell, “Hello, I’m—oh, excuse me, I didn’t mean to interrupt—”
The last Friday in August, about a month into Harry’s rotation, Malfoy mentioned a show that night—a local band, some university kids. Malfoy had played their CD a few times in the office; it was loud and aggressive, raw and unpolished. Harry didn’t think they would be making it big anytime soon, but he liked them well enough.
“I, er—” Harry flushed deeply, steeled himself with a breath, “You know how I needle you, I mean like, you’re so unruffled all the time? And how I’m always baiting you—” he broke off, biting his lip. “I mean, I was trying to get a rise out of you, to get you to admit you wanted me too, to get—anything, really, but…”
He thought about that a lot, particularly in the shower. But he also thought about talking to Malfoy at the bar, how he had really listened to Harry, offered thoughtful advice, made him laugh. Harry had had a good time that night, even though he’d ended up in a bit over his head with the whole sex thing, and once he had calmed down somewhat, he had actually been looking forward to seeing Malfoy again. Maybe they could be friends? Harry didn’t have that many gay friends—Charlie was never around, and Luna was… Luna. Malfoy had seemed willing to show him the ropes a little, and Harry appreciated it—more than he expected. But the more time went by without him running into Malfoy at work, the more he started to suspect that he might have been… less than perfectly polite, when he had left. Harry really had no idea what the proper morning-after etiquette was. He’d only ever slept with Ginny, and he certainly didn’t know what to expect when it came to blokes, much less Malfoy. Surely Malfoy hadn’t expected him to stay—it was Christmas morning, and they were ex-enemies who’d somehow ended up getting pissed and shagging—what were they going to do, make cocoa and open presents in front of the fire together? Definitely not that. But when he cared to look closely at his memory of leaving, which was not often, he had a prickly sense that no matter how casual or unexpected the liaison, it was probably not the best manners to practically sprint out of there the way he had. If he was ever brave enough to tell Hermione what happened, which he wasn’t, he thought she might give him that sad frown and say, “I’m disappointed in you, Harry.” And Harry couldn’t bear the thought of
, and Draco’s head went full of static, so he was a bit confused when Potter pulled away, panting, saying “wait, wait.”
“Right,” Pansy nodded, taking another sip of wine. “And are you alright?”
. All their friends had commented on it over the next few weeks, Circe’s resemblance to Harry, until finally Harry had marched himself into the nearest shelter and picked out the blondest, floofiest-looking cat he could find—Cassandra had soft, lustrous white fur and pale blue eyes, and the way she pranced about with her nose in the air, swishing her tail back and forth, put Harry in mind of a prissy kitten character in an animated muggle film he had watched as a child. Harry brought her home with his biggest shit-eating grin plastered across his face, and Draco had taken one look at her, barked out a laugh and said
“Ah yes,” Draco smirked, “I sabotaged the wish—”
Draco huffed, and in retaliation, clenched tightly around Potter inside of him, and Potter certainly had not been expecting
Harry smiled sheepishly, “I told Molly I’d be waiting on you all day so I was afraid to come over in case I missed you.”
“And you feel so
“God,” Harry choked out, “Brave? I’ve just been an idiot who couldn’t see what was right in front of him. At least you have a whole—” he waved his free, pizza-holding hand haphazardly, “—narrative, whereas I’ve been stupid for years with no excuse—”
“Oh yes it is; you’re just embarrassed to be caught out in front of this lovely gentleman—” he flashed a winning smile at Healer Andrade, who was watching the exchange with the vague alarm of an authority figure who hadn’t yet figured out how to intervene.
Then Blaise was groaning, “Oh, Merlin, that’s even worse…”
“The fuck are you staring at?”
Harry woke slowly, with a crick in his neck. He’d transfigured the chairs into a small cot set up next to Draco’s bed, and he had indeed slept poorly. It was uncomfortable, and they never turned the fucking lights off in the hallway. He got up, cracking his neck and filling a glass of water from the pitcher at the bedside table. Draco looked alright, pale and still, breathing slowly. Harry rested a hesitant hand on his chest, feeling the rise and fall. He swallowed, then stepped back, changing his clothes quickly and heading to the loo—the healers had said that the potions keeping Draco unconscious should wear off around seven o’clock. He started stirring a few minutes after Harry returned, his fingers twitching feebly, a soft, pained noise escaping his throat. His eyes slowly cracked open and fixed on Harry. “Wha–“
Harry hummed in agreement, his body starting to settle. “Put on some music, will you? Something happy? Good spirits for the new year?”
crying. Neville and Greg sat on plush cushions across the rug, Greg hunched over the low coffee table with his rolling papers—you wouldn’t guess it from the size of his fingers, but he rolled the best joints out of any of them, by far. Neville had hired him to work in his greenhouses when he’d been released from Azkaban a couple of years after the War and couldn’t get any other work. Draco called them the gentle giants, behind their back. To their faces, he called them
“Why wouldn’t I be ok?”
pulling your do-gooder, heart of gold Savior schtick right now—
When his thigh muscles started to protest and he felt the knife edge of a cramp developing in his right lung, Harry stumbled off the floor, depositing his aching limbs in a fold-out chair. Damn, he should have stopped at the bar for a water first; he was parched. He interlaced his fingers behind his head and leaned back, his eyes immediately finding Hermione and Ron. They were breaking it down in the middle of a circle of cheering friends, Hermione with her arms in the air, head thrown back, shimmying her shoulders, Ron bent low at the knees, twisting his hips and pointing his fingers at her, catching her around the waist, the two of them whirling together, mouths open, rapturous.
