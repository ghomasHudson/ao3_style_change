"I know what that is." Harry disrupted quietly, watching as Blaise's eyebrows drew together for the fraction of a second before he nodded. "Then we'll just get you in about two hours? I'll have an elf send breakfast up for you."
Harry ignoring problems? Ron frowned in thought, that wasn't something Harry would normally do. His best friend never shied away from problems; sometimes he postponed dealing with them but he never denied having them and in the end he always took responsibility. What had the two dominants done to Harry to make him 'ignore' his inheritance out of spite? Or were they lying?
It gave him a – for him – strangely exotic appearance, handsome, yes, but exotic and unfamiliar. Harry didn't quite know yet if he liked it, so different was it, but he guessed he would get used to it, in time.
Harry pressed his lips together, so that his grin might not become too goofily wide. He had done it. Here his wings were, in flesh and blood literally, his flesh and blood, and it hadn't hurt at all.
At least he could take comfort in the knowledge that Draco and Blaise would be safe, that at least the Aurors would make sure they wouldn't be able to interfere. It wasn't like the battle of Hogwarts where his allies, countless children, had rushed into the thick of the fight without him being able to oversee the chaos.
Then suddenly the dark skinned Italian jumped, propelled himself into the air and a mass of feathers erupted so quickly from his back that it was impossible to follow or understand the process that caused two gigantic wings to carry him upwards, not much, barely three metres at best. Harry gasped at the sight and took a step back, bumping against another muscled chest.
Confused, Harry turned back to Draco and Blaise, wondering what was going on, especially when he saw both of the Slytherins inclining their head deliberately.
He gasped, or at least thought he did, but only a small chirp escaped his mouth, making him flinch and a terrible idea struck him: someone must have transfigured him! Maybe one of Voldemort’s former supporters wanting to take revenge... maybe he had been given a potion without noticing it and now he was becoming a monster!
"Adler told us just this very morning how to establish temporary connections and Draco … he thought it too early for you and for himself and maybe it was. But I proposed it nonetheless. That's why he was angry. And it … it was just … " wonderful? Addictive? Frighteningly intense? All of that and still no description would suffice. Words often weren't accurate enough in Blaise's opinion. And really, there was no perfectly fitting adjective or paraphrase for the warmth and dizzying contentment that the three of them had experienced together. And the familiarity it had build. How should he feel about knowing Harry's emotions so intimately, more intimately probably than his two best friends and that Weasley girl? Dazzled? Not quite, but even so, he had been swept along in the tide of Harry's very private emotions and had felt the same happen to Draco. And that loss of control that had only been recognized as such in retrospect, was disconcerting. So it had been uncomfortably comfortable, wonderfully frightening, addictively familiar and dazzlingly intense.
Perhaps Harry was even more likely to spare him, due to the life debt that tied them together… a layer of protection that Blaise did not have.
Harry was still taking in the breathtaking sight when a shadow rushed into his field of vision. Instinctively his body went into battle mode and he started to recoil from the possible threat and turn towards it while ducking down to present less of a target. He had barely begun to execute the movements when it registered with him that it was only Zabini sprinting past him and towards the water, his feet digging into the sand with each strong step.
Then the slender hands wound around his chest and grasped his wrists, crossing them in front of him, holding them tightly. Licking over his lips nervously, Harry wondered if he should allow himself to be restrained that way but he reminded himself that they had done it before when giving him back his hearing and it had proven to be a good decision: he would have tried to pry his head free of Blaise’s hands otherwise and stop that maddening itching. He might have severely injured himself with his talons. And still there was the reassuring matter of the life-debt between them.
After a few more minutes of teasing banter going back and forth and another two or three kisses being stolen, Harry finally retreated with another thanks for the wonderful day, slipping into the velvety darkness of his rooms.
It wasn't the delicate beak of a falcon, or the strong elegant one of an eagle or even the useful tool of a crow. No, if anything, theirs could be likened to the beak of a vulture, with what seemed to be one large nostril stretching through the horn and bone from one side to the other.
"Fine then," he said in the historian's direction, "as briefly as you can, signore Tassi, tell us what you think happened."
Briefly Harry wondered if he should take offence at being compared to such a tiny bird – the similarity to the word colibri, the hummingbird was easy enough to grasp – but then he discarded the thought again in favour of more important matters: "How do I change the shape?"
So they always kept a tight rein on their instincts and Blaise was left arching his shoulder blades instead of releasing his wings to erupt from his back.
"Ives wanted him to give you a chance." Adler said quietly, interrupting his gloomy pondering. "An honest chance."
But nonetheless he couldn't help but wonder if Hermione was right and Crane would refuse to publish Harry's statement. And did he even have the right to ask this favour of her, when she had ventured so much for him and she might end up in prison for it?
And by Morgaine's vengeful nature, if that dog had sunken its fangs into the flesh of the Gryffindor's body only once, Draco swore he would
"Make it short, signore Tassi if you could." Comissario Mancini interrupted grimly. "A lot of muggles will have witnessed the magic explosion. I already gave orders for our obliviators to be sent out, but whatever we do, it is only a matter of hours until the hacks from the Libri Sibillino will get wind of this. If we don't want them to come up with their own story, we will need to give a press conference beforehand."
Right before he could collide with the swarm, a dark bluish light whizzed past him. It cleaved through the ravens and falcons and crows and vultures, ripping into their bodies until they combusted and burst apart in an explosion of light. Draco’s heart leapt into his throat in fear and the change came upon him in an instant. Vicious claws buried themselves into the pale flesh of the young Elf in his arms, a crown of feathers erupting from his hair while the skin around his eyes paled and his front teeth sharpened. Even more magic pushed into the shield he had raised around himself instinctively, swirling over the surface of his wings just as he plunged into that supernova.
"You'd better believe it. Our parents already seem quite intent on making him a part of the family. Though I'm not sure if they realise that no one will ever manage to groom Potter into something even remotely socially acceptable." Draco said, his voice cold and hard in irritation.
"If you won't tell us, Mrs Malfoy," Hermione spoke up, her voice dangerously pleasant "I'm sure that we can find a reporter who would be more than delighted to write about the curious circumstances under which the Saviour of the Wizarding World disappeared."
"Why don't you cut away those ties and I direct his magic to restructure his sense of hearing, so that we can tell him to stop it, hmm?"
A little bit embarrassed, Weasley shrugged apologetically; but the two Slytherins remained silent and smug, after all they had achieved what they wanted: there was no hint of the earlier, foul dejection marring Harry's features now, even though he still looked more mature and serious than suited him.
"Yes, it is possible." Adler said at last, the corner of his lips twitching into an unwilling smile. "It rather is like the physical transformation: the first time everything will be established once and then it can be retracted and brought forth again at will."
"We wouldn't have!" No, he'd rather courted the Gryffindor properly like any pureblood would have done; he would have taken him on night flights along the coast of England, the pounding sea and thundering waves beneath them while they soared close to the chalk cliffs under the stars, weaving streams of colourful magic into the darkness. He would have showered him with gifts, magical and beautiful and so rich that it would have taken Harry's breath away and made his eyes gleam like emeralds in adoration, he would have protected him and been so forthcoming and gentle, he'd befriended that horrible weasel and the beaver and shown Harry how much he wanted him, wanted this to work and …
"Don't start with that now, Ron. If Lucius Malfoy is convicted, I want him to be punished for his crimes and not because the wizarding public wants to see heads rolling. And this is... now everyone is going to think Blaise and Draco are abusing me... what did that guy say? Rape and deprivation of liberty? They aren't doing anything to me!"
Draco smiled as he stepped closer, reaching out to cup Harry’s cheek, turning it up with gentle pressure so that the slightly smaller man had to look directly into his eyes. For a single endless moment he remained like that, leaning slightly forward as he bluntly invaded Harry’s personal space, doing nothing but staring and stroking a strand of black hair away from the corner of his eyes. But it didn’t seem as if he was hesitating, merely as if he was offering Harry the chance to realise what he wanted to do, the choice to pull away, maybe, turn his head.
Now though, seeing a study of desperation painted on Harry's face, set apart from the peaceful scenery around them – the perfect setting of a beautiful park bathed in starlight, the ocean breeze wafting around them and playing with Harry's raven strands and silky green feathers – he couldn't help but think it was tasteless and cruel.
"Is this a magic or a flying lesson?" Harry demanded behind him, his voice flat, and Draco pursed his lips in amusement. Trust the Golden Boy to lighten the mood.
With an enormous effort, Draco tried to gentle his voice as he addressed the Gryffindor next. "You are a submissive, Harry, and as dominants, we
But that would be petty, spiteful defiance and unworthy of any Malfoy heir and even though his fiancé talked about surpassing their parents and a literal Ragnarök of both of their families, Draco wasn't quite ready yet to abandon either his mother or his father and so, even though he couldn't deny the not insubstantial level of affection he held for their greenfinch that had caused him to pledge more than just his protection to Harry by swearing to do right by him, and even though it was the only possible outcome of his inner debate, Draco would have probably needed more time for the decision making, if he didn't think protecting Harry to be in his father's interest as well.
With a sigh the dominant Vykélari in the mirror unclasped the hands he had held behind his back the whole time, a gesture that shouldn't really be threatening, but was. Nervously, Harry watched as the thin fingers crept like spiders towards the wand holster at the man's side. But it wasn't opened.
It didn't take long for the high to deflagrate, though, the flame dying due to a lack of air, because Harry knew that he could never be sure whether his blackmailers would even follow the laws of logic.
"If this is about a Vykélari related matter, then I must ask you gentlemen to leave," Blaise continued with a short glance at the men from the guardia, "as non-Vykélari are prohibited from interfering. If it is not, however, then I would ask you, uncle, to leave since this seems to be a matter of grave importance that is likely to occupy my time for a while."
Amalyne didn't answer. As if frozen she stood there staring at the clothing racks on the other side of the room. They were empty apart of one raven-black coat that the both of them knew only too well.
Contracting his strong leg muscles, Draco pulled the tanned Italian close, burying him deep inside him in one go. Twin groans filled the air, one of pure pleasure, one tinted with pain.
Taide felt the acrid taste of bile rise in his throat and still he couldn’t look away from where that gruesome vision of blood and death and desperation transformed into a spectacle of terrible beauty, unable to flee or help or do something other than stare helplessly, frozen with the same fascinated horror with which one might behold a volcanic eruption even while the pyroclastic flow raced closer like death personified.
Idly, Blaise wondered if Potter knew that he could ask for quite literally anything short of taking a life - Draco's or someone else's. Probably not, or he would have used the debt to make them give him a portkey back to Britain.
In contrast to her, though, he was dressed totally in black and even his wand, resting in a holster at his side, was made of ebony.
Frozen Blaise watched as the large animal began to circle threateningly around him and Harry. Malicious eyes speared him, letting him know he and Draco were only still alive because this beast wished it and how quickly that decision could be revoked.
But he'd bide his time and when the right moment arrived, he'd make sure they would pose no danger to anyone anymore, ever again.
“MARCO!” He screamed in warning and his brother-in-law whipped around. His face became lax with shock, his mouth falling open, eyes widening comically. The tall man must have realised that it was over, that it was too late. Taide saw him hesitate for a single, terribly short moment, before Marco turned, threw his arms around his wife and protectively covered her lean form with his much broader body as best as he could in a futile attempt to shield her.
"In the summer after his first year at Hogwarts they imprisoned him in a spare bedroom, putting bars in front of the windows. Practically starved him, too." Severus' felt his throat tighten. He knew there was a reason why he had never allowed himself to think about what he had seen in Potter's memory. It had been easier to dismiss each of the countless flashbacks individually, but summarized, they seemed oppressive.
Suddenly his eyes lost their focus and the next thing he knew, he was lying on the ground, staring up at dizzying blobs of bright red and white and so many swirling colours in between. “Something … something is taking my magic…” he forced the hoarse words out, his green eyes staring up in wide-eyed terror.
Severus harrumphed and leaned back in his chair with a frown. It were always those images that made him feel so conflicted. He knew he should take pleasure in them, ridicule Potter because of them, but always they appalled him instead. And nonetheless he had let Potter feel his scorn whenever he came across such memories during their lessons. He had hated himself for that, had hated Potter more for making him hate himself.
He counted nine wizards and witches: two women and seven men, most of whom had strategically positioned themselves to easily contain Harry, should he somehow step out of line or even try to flee. Four men of various ages had encircled him, including the psychopathic bastard who had contacted him through the mirror, and Eleuterio who had backed away from Harry, getting himself out of reach of the vicious, poisonous claws that could sprout from Harry's fingertips in a moment's notice.
There was only one way to ensure that this wouldn't happen: they had to make Harry fall in love with them and now, thanks to Ives, they had the opportunity to woo him and show him that for all three of them to be happy and safe, they had to be together.
Of course, their parents would be furious if they didn't claim the submissive for themselves and really, it somewhat went against everything a Slytherin believed in to let such a chance at power and influence go by. If they didn't claim Potter and the enhancement in prestige, influence and power that he would bring, someone else would. Another pureblood family that might even rise above the Malfoys and Zabinis in consequence.
He sighed then. There was no way that Harry would be able to bring forth his wings in the emotional state he was currently in. His magic would never do something that he clearly did not want, that might hurt him. And since Harry feared the transformation of his wings and maybe even disliked the new appendages as the most obvious change that had come with his inheritance, the very epitome of his unwanted legacy, it wouldn't allow the brunet to do more emotional damage by letting the emerald wings appear.
Finally, with a decisive nod and the air of a war general surrounding her, she leaned forward with both hands on the table, intently gazing at him.
"Let go!" The brunet screamed at him, panic creeping into his furious voice. But without the determination to carry an attempt at freeing himself to the extreme and hurting or injuring Blaise, it was no use.
Next to him, Blaise slid out of his chair and approached the younger Vykélari. Ignoring the unimpressive glare of swimming eyes, he gently turned the other's chair around to face him and hunkered down in front of the brunet.
He looked disturbingly frail against the white linen of the bed sheets, his skin far too pale and thin, like brittle parchment.
His words and voice were dismissive enough and yet, the cruel glint in his eyes and the unforgiving harshness of his smile spoke of a man who held grudges over literally nothing and Harry knew that even if he complied willingly now with everything done with and to him, he'd be made to pay for his defiance in some way, once (no,
If the war had taught him anything, then that he didn't want to live without this stubborn, prideful, egoistical idiot.
are powerful enough and are currently going through your first transformation. Could you follow me so far?”
Neither was the fact that her reputation had suffered somewhat due to her well-considered suggestion that it might be better, in a purely utilitarian sense, to throw the Wonder-Boy out to the wolves when the castle had been besieged. It had been the logical thing to do and really she couldn't understand why it had made everyone so angry. And damn it, it wasn't as if Draco hadn't tried to give the boy over, Gregory had told her that, the only difference was that she had done it in front of the whole student body and who-knows-who-else in the Great Hall. It hadn't been a very Slytherin thing to do, she had to admit that and so she bore the consequences now with the grace and humility befitting someone of her station.
Draco strode forward as if he would shatter the windows and storm the fifty metres towards Potter within the three seconds it would take the Gryffindor to vanish. Blaise followed closely.
"Likewise, Mr Malfoy." Harry replied cautiously even though he would rather have been speaking alone with Ives who he had come to like in the little time they had known each other.
Nonetheless the Lanai's were considered to be respectable wizards, and the letter the submissive had apparently written was authentic, that was beyond question. Even the British Aurors had confirmed with absolute certainty that Mr Potter's well-known magical signature was all over the paper, and that at the time the words had been written, no other wizard but he had touched it.
"I take it, this diverges from the norm?" The question came surprisingly easily over his lips, considering how apprehensive Draco had been. Was this maybe just an irregularity that would diminish or maybe even vanish in time?
"Who is there?" He called out quietly, all weariness from the long day forgotten. He didn't doubt for a single moment that
Merlin, he could just imagine how that would tear their sweet Harry apart. Blaise knew that those were societal changes Harry would approve of, especially now with Kingsley Shacklebold as a strong and just minister, but at the same time he would hate being made into a tool and weapon once again. And perhaps, perhaps he'd even be somewhat indignant for their sake, because while Harry was portrayed as the martyred hero, Draco and he were made into the foul villains and Blaise liked to think that Harry cared enough to be affronted at that.
It kind of freaked him out a bit and Harry hurried to finish, his face as red as a radish. He had always found himself too thin, too small and although the muscles of his body were defined, he didn't think that they looked at all …
Curtly he nodded towards his son before turning swiftly on his heels, striding ahead while Harry was ushered out of the entrance hall with one of Taide's large hands on the small of his back urging him on. Before he even knew what was happening, Harry found himself hustled and pulled through a narrow corridor with a low ceiling, so low that it made him feel even more trapped, surrounded by a mass of bodies as he was, the bodies of his captors.
Then Malfoy let his wand fall into his palm with a smooth, sliding gesture and cut the upright arrow into his forearm. "This I promise."
A glance to his side, though, sobered him up quickly. Draco's stony expression as he kept on staring at the article, had him reach out for his lover worriedly.
"I'm okay, it's nothing." Blaise murmured, his dark, shadowed eyes trained on Harry's quivering form, whose skin was now completely bereft of the beautiful green and ultraviolet, his black locks now free of the emerald feathers that had ruffled them so endearingly.
Besides, it had been so much easier to think about ridding the world of Lord Voldemort than killing Tom Marvolo Riddle.
Draco shook his head wearily and turned to head towards their bed. "We were only children, Blaise, I have already forgiven him. Let it go."
It really was ironic that despite placing Harry in this gruesome situation by giving him such a choice, the man was in appearance a strangely very human aristocrat that didn't look at all like a cruel sadist or a future dark lord.
Draco would have sighed or frowned or snapped at Blaise, if Harry hadn't stood there watching the two of them with that curious expression; how could Draco, when it was not him who had a valid reason to be anxious but the younger submissive who had lived through a hell of a traumatic transformation and had to face it yet again.
In any case, Harry thought as he made his way to the bathroom, the little control he had found was the perfect little extra to a great, almost perfect day.
They would die here! They would all die here and there was nothing he could do to change that anymore.
That was when he noticed that the Slytherins had both turned and regarded him with almost identical smirks and Harry flushed. God, when had Zabini and Malfoy started to be able to make Harry lose himself in his thoughts? The war should have taught him better,
Immediately the atmosphere in the room sharpened as if filled with invisible glass shards that would hurt and cut and slice if only they had but a fraction more of substance.
Draco and Blaise both knew very well how tiring it was at first to use the new, untrained muscles. But Potter was still fighting on for who knew how long, just like the Gryffindor he was, never caving in or giving up, despite how hopeless his battles were proving to be.
A shiver crawled down Harry's spine, chilling him, and he swallowed a few times, his dry throat clicking far too loudly in the silence around them, only disturbed by the periodic echo of their soft steps on the springy grass. He didn't want to go on a suicide mission. Not again.
Harry's heart skipped a beat and his magic erupted in a bright, parching explosion that blazed its trail through his muscles and nerves only to be forced to a sudden stop when it impacted with the unyielding barrier it had been bound with.
The healer reached over to shake hands first with Blaise and then Draco, the slender fingers dry and wrinkled. "Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Zabini, thank you for coming. If you'd follow me, please…"
This intruder obviously hadn’t noticed the silent alarm. Or, Severus corrected himself drily as he looked up to the stairs above him, they simply hadn’t cared.
"Well, we won't find out unless we try…" Harry countered before stepping towards the edge of the roof garden again, his heart beating way too fast despite his brave words as his green eyes fastened on his reflection in the oversized mirror. Even after two days (it was after all only his third day in Lanai Manor, the first of which had been very short because of his little outburst that had landed him in bed again due to magical exhaustion after not more than four hours) he found himself actually surprised that his body in human form hadn't changed at all after coming into his inheritance. Sure, the day before they had spent mainly down by the sea in the sun, which had lend his skin a nice, golden tan but aside from that, he was looking the same as before.
"We won't always be." Blaise said, and of course he had wanted to prod a little further but when, following that statement, Harry smiled at him with one of those small, quiet smiles that tugged at his lips seemingly against his will, he just couldn't. But damn, Blaise was growing rather fond of those accursed smiles and if getting the chance to collect more of them meant stopping to harass Harry about possibly choosing a political career, well, then he'd have to do just that. Honestly, it was just like Draco's amused eyes, laughing at him for trying to romance someone as level-headed as the Slytherin Ice Prince, even though he knew Draco loved the attention and he appreciated the thought of whatever it was Blaise did for him and so he did it nonetheless. Just for the laughter in those eyes.
"What do you want me to do, Blaise?" Tore had asked, his rough face tense with the gravity of the situation, fingers drumming on a side table sitting next to his arm chair. There had been deep, dark rings circling his keen eyes but that hadn't lessened the force behind his words.
Valerio spread his arms as if to encompass the entirety of the destruction Harry had caused. "Look around you, submissive! Look what you have done! You can't control your magic without a mate. You have to mate! Why not Taide?"
Blaise frowned, shifting his weight from one foot to the other with a hint of annoyance piercing his movements, making them harsh and abrupt. "The article was the usual Prophet nonsense, Daphne! We didn't mistreat him, we never attempted to force him to mate – Merlin, we didn't even intend to mate him in the first place when we brought him to Lanai Manor! Not really. All we did was bring him to my manor here in Italy and yes, we kept him from leaving, for Merlin's sake! But that was…"
Then the real nightmare began, triggered by a simple, neutral "Crucio", murmured with the bored voice of an announcer at a train station.
But seeing as Draco really had been shaken – and Harry didn't think he had been mistaken in that observation – Harry thought that it was probably just another attempt to distract his mind and keep him from focusing too hard on his memories.
Therefore it came as no surprise that the soft but incensed voices drifting through the heavy curtains dividing his bed and living room had him wide awake and alert in an instant, while he kept his body relaxed and his breath even and calm in feigned sleep. Still, his heart beat madly in his chest like it had done not even three hours ago, when he had once again started up from his sleep due to a vivid nightmare. This time, though, he knew instantly that it wasn't a dream; someone was in an adjoining room to his own and from the sound of it, they were having a heated argument and possibly had less than his well-being in mind.
But as the moments passed with the two of them locked in some surreal staring contest, the time continuum frozen to a standstill around them, instead of the spontaneous suggestion he had hoped for only a sense of loss overcame him. He didn't want Daphne to think so low of him, didn't want to lose the regard of someone he respected. But moreover, he didn't want to include his and Draco's parents if not absolutely necessary and therefore couldn't afford losing another ally right now.
"Indeed, Adler." He drawled, his voice and expression steely. "That is exactly what I am in regard to you, and I tire of your attitude quite frankly. I value your council and it would pain me to lose it, but as the only
An honest chance. That was all Ives had asked for his freedom. And he would have to accept his inheritance but only for those 51 days.
Even Mrs Palmer's following account could not invalidate that allegation. On the contrary, while creating the impression of giving voice to different opinions, Crane only strengthened the criticism at their society's distribution of power by having the historian name famous examples. And indeed Blaise had to admit that purebloods had always tried to retain as much autonomy as possible, granting the ministry only the minimum of power, supporting weak, easily led ministers...
"Because there is no reason not to: we did nothing illegal by bringing you here." Blaise said in that slight, patiently indulgent tone of voice with which one would answer the questions of a small child. It made Harry's blood boil.
It was the 9th of July, 1998, just a few days past the two-month mark after the Battle of Hogwarts, as wizards and witches in all of Britain had already started to call it in the euphoria that drowned the wizarding community after the Dark Lord’s fall.
Merlin, what was he supposed to do? If he supported Draco, Lucius might end up in prison, and that after all he had done to keep him out of it. And for what? For James Potter's little mirror image.
"Shut up, Severus!" The blonde snarled with barely a glance towards the former potions master, his eyes tearing into his son.
Frowning and tilting his head, Draco stepped closer to the pair, watching those red lips move soundlessly, too quickly to understand anything.
And one of Blaise's uncles or cousins – Nerio perhaps, the bastard, or Taide who had been in charge of leading Blaise through his own inheritance – they would touch him gently, teasingly, intimately as they pushed magic into that golden skin while dazzling Harry with a display of their power in the attempt of enticing him to establish a mating bond.
Would they make him leave? Of course Blaise had promised him a safe haven in Lanai Manor but could he trust him to keep it? Harry knew almost nothing about the dark skinned Italian, aside from the fact that he loved Draco dearly and that he would probably chose his side if the blond wanted Harry gone. And that was maybe a not so unlikely possibility: if he found he couldn't bear the sensations of a true mating bond, then he might perceive that as a personal failure and if Harry had learned anything about the Slytherin Ice Prince then it was that he hated reminders of his failures.
With a displeased huff, he curled his long fingers around his wand and uttered a sharp, clear Finite Incantatum.
In retrospect, they didn't seem much different from when he had seen them at Malfoy's trial not so long ago; but he hadn't really taken note of their appearance then. Now, in the middle of the sunlit, beautiful garden with no other people around them, no task like the awkward returning of a wand to distract him, Harry couldn't help but notice how different they looked from when all three of them had still been at Hogwarts.
Narcissa frowned deeply and pursed her lips. She hadn't thought of the boy at all. Of course if Potter had somehow been injured or at danger, they couldn't have all evacuated…
Moments stretched to unbearable eternity and neither Draco nor Blaise even dared to look at each other, knowing that the realisation of their own failure would be mirrored in the other's eyes, silent self-accusations that couldn't be assuaged, just like the rage that would undoubtedly be found there, rooted in their bitter helplessness that none of them could honestly deny.
They were traditionalists, proud purebloods, and powerful witches. But above all else, they were mothers and after realising that one of their sons' emergency portkeys had been activated there would be only one thing on their mind: the instinctive fear of a parent for their child.
For a moment, nothing happened and only Harry’s rapid panting permeated the cool air in the hospital room, before Harry reared up, pressing back against Malfoy’s chest, gritting his teeth against the unbearable itching in the back of his eyes where his magic re-grew his retina.
Blaise chuckled lowly just as he held the door towards a dining room on the eastern side of the manor open for Harry and waved him through with a graceful hand gesture before following him.
Once again Harry’s stomach felt as if it was pressed into his chest as Blaise arched his back, suddenly unfurled his short wings with the durable, hard feathers wide, turning their fall into a sudden rise that had Harry close his eyes, the fast change in direction overwhelming, dizzying and he had to concentrate on the arms around him, that pressed into his stomach, held him tight and safe.
Affronted, Lucius looked at the painting of his ancestor. "I knew I should have burned you years ago."
By now he certainly wouldn't be able to use the floo connection any longer and he couldn't even approach the wards without getting stunned and dragged right back.
No one had entered the wards, and if the two-way-mirror was destroyed, as Draco suspected (the blackmailers surely wouldn't forget such important and obvious a detail when they had thought of nearly everything else), then they couldn't even prove that someone had contacted Harry, let alone blackmailed him.
"It wasn't even the worst betrayal he had to experience. Last year I abandoned Harry and Hermione in the wilds to fend for themselves, searching for a way to fight the madman you all so readily followed. And you know what? Once I found them again, he forgave me almost as readily. It's just what he does. But I won't allow that habit to destroy his life."
“It is, Narcissa! Because of all the attention your stupid stunt with Potter drew, the whole world will be focusing on Lucius‘ trial. Top politicians like the incorruptible Shacklebolt will sit in on it. Friends and admirers of Potter's. People that are not afraid of you, submissive or not!”
Yes, everything. His parents both had died in the final battle in front of their only son's very eyes and it had torn something out of him, something insubstantial Draco couldn't quite place but knew he couldn't get back. Maybe it was nothing more than the last bit of the already battered illusion of a child believing its parents to be strong and invulnerable and perfect, always there to pick up the shambles of the misdeeds of a pampered brat, as Severus had called him.
But he hadn't ever fled from Dementors, just because of the fear and desperation they evoked in him.
And so he found himself waiting for his fellow Slytherin to grace him with her attention, brooding restlessly over all the things he should say, lines he could open with, treasures to offer her. But the one fact remained: Daphne's best friend Tracy, one of their own Slytherins, a girl Blaise had spent almost seven years of school with, had died among too many fellow students in the corridors of Hogwarts, fighting on the side of Draco's enemies while Blaise had long since fled the castle; and this was the first time they would be speaking to each other after that fateful day.
Harry still didn't understand, or at least hadn't acknowledged that while he was the one with more magical strength, the dominants were the ones with more control. And softly Blaise welcomed the not so foreign energy, gentling its aggressive, rough tendrils with affectionate, soothing touches, letting it fill him and melt with his own.
"So, what am I now? And what did you mean when you said you had the right to bring me here without my consent?" he tried to keep his voice calm, he really did, but it sounded tense and taut even to him.
"He is a Gryffindor, he probably won't be able to tell the difference." Blaise said in a matter-of-fact tone. "And as he is a powerful wizard it might be dangerous to lead him on. We should decide, Dragon: either we humour our parents and try to seduce him into mating with us, or we stay away from him for good, allow him to leave, maybe subtly get him to use the life-debt to 'escape' us… no strings would stay between us and him…"
Immediately Potter's form, frozen in the same position in which the stasis spell had caught him, slackened, sinking into the soft mattress. His chest moved with the first breath he had taken in almost an hour, a small fluttering like from a dying chicklet.
Then cool fingers touched his eye-lids, making them flutter close in reaction and once again that warm feeling of familiarity spread into his body. That pulsating, powerful something that he now guessed must be his magic – if Malfoy’s explanations were anything to go by – reacted immediately, rushing out of his body, following the gradient of Blaise’s own magic into the other man, leaving Harry feeling empty and weak and he would have slumped down if not for Draco’s hold on him.
His relatives wanted to manoeuvre him and Draco out of the way without actually having to fight them. They were about to accuse them of some offence or another!
Both of them were tightly bound together, forcing them stiffly behind Potter's back into an unnatural angle that must have been uncomfortable at first and then become rather painful with the passing of the hours. They were bent at the carpus so that they would not press against the ceiling and reached behind him up to the very end of the room, touching the wall nevertheless. Even the very tips of the huge wings were tightly bound together; fluttering agitatedly in an effort to break free that must have been exhausting.
With a sigh, the Italian raised one hand in a placating gesture, his eyes still dark and his lips bruised and damn it, it wasn't only Harry's magic, the guy really was gorgeous. "Listen Harry, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to..."
Immediately Harry opened his eyes wide in shock to look at the closed lids of Blaise's and when he found his hands curiously pressed against firm pectorals, stroking and kneading... well, doing things he really shouldn't have been doing, Harry used the position to shove the Slytherin off of him with all his might, hard enough to make him stumble backwards against the far wall of the corridor.
"Can you imagine soaring towards the sun, when it is setting there over the endless water, not on a broom but on your own wings? I wasn't strong enough to really fly at first and just floated downwards until I landed with a splash. I swear my cousin had way too much fun on my expense."
Weasley lay trembling on the ground, having curled into a foetal position as if that could save him from yet another curse and his back was heaving with violent sobs that Draco couldn't hear due to the privacy spell and he was unbelievably, selfishly glad for this small mercy. Only the previous morning this young man, who was now little more than a pile of misery and fear and pain, had threatened him, had sworn retribution under the Tiwaz vow for every injustice they might do his friend. It was surreal and grotesque and just plain wrong.
At that, Draco shook his head, amused in an exasperated sort of way: even when having been dead for three centuries already, Malfoys always got what they wanted. Embarrassingly, that had only ceased to be the case in his and his father's generation. And that certainly made dealing with his confident, successful ancestor that more difficult.
Besides, transforming back into that bird-like creature just felt as if he was about to stick a toothbrush under the nail of his big toe and then kick against a solid stone wall with all his might: it was something all his instincts screamed at him not to do; he wasn't in any way masochistically inclined after all, even though with the way he kept antagonizing powerful wizards, that might have been a valid assumption. Now if he could fly without having to transform first…
Harry, though, seemed still too befuddled, too amazed with it all to give it up just yet. Or he was simply still crap at Occlumency. Hadn't Severus told them that the Gryffindor had never mastered the art?
"They are here, because the Vykélari council asked them to help in the enforcement of our laws and in this function they observe my command." His uncle declared coolly, pausing to give the words the proper effect.
With a soft snort of amusement, the elder man inclined his head in a mock-bow to his descendant "As my young lord wishes."
The portraits of two of Draco's Vykélari ancestors – Adler Malfoy and Ives Malfoy, née Prewett – agree to help the Slytherin's in their pursuit of Harry.
Oh god... he desperately needed to find out how to recognize the influence of magic. Fervently he started replaying the last few minutes in his mind, flushing at the humiliating things he had done and said. Damn, he should postpone doing this once he was alone... or should he?
There were three basic means by which a team could score points: being the first to arrive at the previously agreed goal was worth 80 points. Hitting members of the opposing teams brought 5 points per hit.
"Have some fruit salad, Potter, you must be hungry." Malfoy said at last as he turned to him once again, completely ignoring Harry's question, and with a roguish smile he started piling the mixture of fruits on the crystalline dessert plate of his guest.
Blaise didn't listen further and while he himself was maybe too stunned to react, his magic was not: When he would later contemplate his reaction, Blaise wouldn't be able to define what exactly he was feeling at that very moment. He only knew that his stomach contracted uncomfortably and that his heart beat faster for some reason or the other. It wasn't anger and it wasn't nervousness or fear, or any other emotion in its pure form; no, it was a complex mixture that he couldn't decipher. But it was intense enough that his magic acted of its own accord and suddenly Blaise felt his wings strain against his skin and then, before he had the chance to do anything about it, they pressed against the thin fabric of his shirt, sending spikes of white-hot pain through his backside. It was all he could do to bring his magic into action and quickly cut the necessary slits into the fabric to relieve the throbbing, because he knew he wouldn't be able to force back his wings.
A few slashes of their wands later, the leather bindings fell to the floor. For a second those emerald wings fluttered helplessly in mid-air, before collapsing feebly in a heap sideways to the ground, a startled and pained outcry leaving the dark haired boy's lips and Draco and Blaise both winced and looked at each other guiltily. They hadn't thought about how painfully cramped up Potter's wing muscles had to be after hours of having them bound in a very uncomfortable position.
Sighing, Blaise pressed the white towel against his face, wiping it dry and gaining some moments of time. "Harry."
Of course, perhaps even more than a matter of nostalgic patriotism, it was a political statement: even in hiding the magical government sat enthroned with the muggle world at their feet in every sense of the word.
Apropos: should he be concerned that the two Slytherins spent more time discussing smart, complex and devious ways of committing certain crimes and getting away with it than actually trying to solve the murder case the play was about?
For a moment, Harry was simply and utterly shocked. His stomach churned so violently from the sudden drop that he felt unable to breathe for a moment or two and he pressed himself against Blaise’s body as flatly as he could, reeling from the intensity of the experience as the two Slytherins turned the three of them around so they plummeted headfirst towards the foothills, gaining speed with every second.
he really was... but somehow he doubted he'd have to resort to any underhanded tactics, well, as long as Blaise managed to keep his hands to himself that is. Aside from that, the two Slytherins had shown themselves surprisingly willing to compromise.
It was difficult to keep it all imprisoned when it made him feel as if he was the one caught in his prickling, too tight skin; so alarmingly hard and arduous to not attack the mirror as his eyes found the man standing there two mirror connections apart from him so close and yet unreachable, but he wrapped it up in a coat of iron and thorns and held the parcel of rancour close to his chest, his very being. This wasn't a battle magic could fight. Not yet.
Carefully, she put the mirror into a sea-green velvet case and then stored it away into the handbag dangling from her arm. If someone other than Granger or her weasel boyfriend opened, she didn't want them to see the mirror. It was Draco's and Blaise's wish that Potter's friends got it without any time-consuming detours.
But she halted at the door and threw him a look over her shoulder, her eyes blazing as she saw him observing her.
Harry turned away in unease towards the portrait, blushing as he saw Ives watching him with interest.
This time, Harry knew he had gone too far even though he wouldn't for the life of him be able to say what made him realise this overstepping of invisible boundaries. The other man didn't flinch, didn't snarl or glare at him, his posture was unchanged as he stared at him for long moments in complete and utter silence, quiet and motionless yet ominous and oppressive like the literal calm before the storm.
He flushed, lowering his gaze only to feel his chin lifted by Zabini’s gentle, bronzed fingers. “Quite alright, Potter…”
But he hadn't had so much fun since before the war. Longer, perhaps. Harry honestly couldn't quite recall the last incident. In any case, he hadn't felt so carefree and elated for such a painfully long time that it was like being high on endorphins.
"Please do!" The Malfoy heir snarled, backing the other two men towards the door as he advanced predatorily on them. "But if you do, I promise I will take you to court for this and I will sue you for compensation so high that St Mungo's will be ruined along with you once I'm finished! Do I make myself clear?"
"In his first year he supposedly defeated him once again, but it was her protection that did the deed. In his second year, he would have died if not for Dumbledore's phoenix saving his sorry ass. In his fourth year, it was once again only luck that saved him, the fortunate circumstance that his and the Dark Lord's wand were brothers and he owes his escape to the spectres of Lily and the others the dark lord had killed. In his fifth year, he got his godfather killed and endangered his friends and many members of that ridiculous Order of the Phoenix because of his stupidity and rashness. And later he almost killed Draco, for Merlin's sake!"
Taking a deep breath, Harry raised his chin with a confidence he didn't feel, hoping against hope that his opponent would stay calm and reasonable even through the words he'd have to speak, willing him to damn well understand that he had reached the limit of what he could possibly concede. "You say you'll release my friends if I obey you? Fine, but without proof I'm not buying it. I won't mate anyone, with or without this potion, until you let them go!"
Torn between relief and guilt, Draco flew towards him at a more sedate pace, keeping his wand trained on the violently moving body to keep him in the air. Merlin, he hadn't meant to shock him like this but Draco hadn't known what else to do: A body-bind or stunning spell, even if he could have successfully performed it, would undoubtedly have caused the Gryffindor to fall face first to the gravel covered ground and at the speed Harry had been running, that could have seriously injured him.
Four sets of eyes watched him carefully, trying to gauge him but unable to and that knowledge was almost as good as seeing the unabashed surprise on their faces would they have been without company.
"I hate this house." She whispered to no one in particular and felt Ron take her hand, squeezing it reassuringly for a moment.
At least the injury in his abdomen seemed to be very low and while still potentially lethal, stomach wounds like these often missed any organs vital enough to kill quickly. What was a messy, slow and painful death for a muggle, gave magic wielders all the time needed to heal themselves.
Now to my MIA status: I’m sorry, life just got in the way and I really can’t promise that this will get better in the near future. I learned with Night Flight, that I can’t really do a WIP, because I’m a slow writer, what with me writing in a foreign language and all, and because I lack the time to do frequent posts. I won’t do a WIP again, apart from the stories that I have yet to finish, because this is frustrating for me and for you.
For a moment Blaise hesitated, looking around waiting for those popping sounds of apparition to herald the arrival of the guardia. Why weren’t they here yet? Where were those bloody useless morons the one time you needed them?
bond – between them to be that intense. Maybe the Slytherins, who treasured their masks and pretty facades so much, just couldn't deal with that level of exposure? Maybe they didn't desire the bond any longer?
Trembling fingers pressed against his forehead and he willed the hurtful thought to stick to them, so that he could pull and tear it out of his head. It was much more difficult than scooping it up from the Pensieve had been, but he managed it, pushed past the sluggish resistance and with another shiver it was gone, leaving only the vague feeling that there had been something to remember… it was such a relief to be free of it, such a horrible knowledge that this was what Harry had felt like, must be feeling like right now.
He would have offered Draco free rein, had not Ives interrupted that moment, making them all turn to him once more. "Draco, Blaise, why don't you have the house elves send a light breakfast up for Mr Potter and leave us alone so we can talk undisturbed?"
Some as small as sparrows and others as large as pelicans, the varied mass of creatures was eerily quiet as they circled over the manor like malevolent spirits. Neither Blaise’s nor Draco’s sensible ears could make out any kind of noise aside from the still distant crackling of fire; and the unnatural silence was more gruesome, more fundamentally wrong and disturbing than any cacophony of rustling wings and shrill murderous bird cries could have been…
Amalyne welcomed the crisp cool and quiet, felt it sharpening her hearing, her very awareness, the reduced impressions of her other senses heightening her alertness until she felt that every single thought was precise and clear. It broke her fear and worry down to a manageable level so that she could look at her family's safe house with a cool head while she waited for Narcissa to arrive, instead of trying to barge in without so much as ascertaining that it was still uncompromised.
“Of all the Vykélari ancestors you have, you had to send Ives and Adler with them to Italy. The one and only successful Malfoy rebel who would doubtlessly impress his ideals on him.” Severus smiled, mildly amused despite the situation.
Not losing any time, Ettore had contacted his father, the current Generale of the guardia who had then summoned an extraordinary meeting between the minister and the Senato della Magia, the official legislature of the Italian wizarding community, who upon hearing what had transpired that night decreed an official disempowerment of the Italian Vykélari council, enabling the guardia to interfere into a courtship and legally search for the submissive.
"Draco?" He asked the moment his feet touched the ground, blackbirds and crows scattering in all directions around him. He didn’t have it in him to pay them any attention, not even to the heat they exuded; His voice trembled so afraid was he of not getting an answer.
And Harry was almost sure that this was a threat. Draco and Blaise would have told him if there was anyone else who might search him out, not to mention the fact that it was already two or three o'clock in the morning. They were so adamant about the privacy of one's own rooms.
He didn't know how he had managed it, according to Blaise it should have been impossible, but the next thing Harry knew was that he had overcome the sticking charms, had left the ground of their vehicle and jumped into the air. His fingers touched the smooth, cold surface, closing around the ring and he ripped his prize straight off the rope before gravity and the loss of momentum could catch up with him. Then, as the chariots and their passengers were propelled forward from the force of the Pihassan’s powerful flaps without him, Harry felt his stomach lurch and his heart skip a beat, already seeing himself falling. The knowledge that he theoretically had wings now hadn't had the chance to be engraved into his mind deeply enough to remember it in that split of a second when he was frozen in shock.
He didn't flinch when hesitant fingers grazed the skin of his back, most likely guided by Blaise's hands, the touch of which he could have recognized anywhere. Then a moment later it shifted, the number of fingertips lying against his skin doubling as doubtlessly, his fiancé entwined his own hand with Harry's. Still facing away, Draco indulged himself by rolling his eyes and smiling faintly, almost fondly. Blaise was so predictable sometimes. Well, at least
It made him cringe away uselessly and shudder and hunch in on himself and not quite consciously he reached out with his magic to rip those threads apart before they could really bind him for good. He hadn't even touched their filigree structure however, before something cold and hard snapped close around his throat from behind, biting into his flesh, growing hot and hotter. Ripples of a foreign power streamed out from the thing, floating over his body like some glutinous fluid, encapsulating him from head to toe, and his magic, wilful and wild, was forcefully cut off from the small tendrils it had sent out and they were lost to him, like fingers chopped off with a cleaver.
In the hospital they have a short hassle with some agitated Weasleys before they are taken to Harry's room by Healer in charge Andrew Cowan and Mediwizard McAuley. They find Harry terrified and confused and generally in a horrible condition, with his wings bound together and his arms and legs tied to the bed, emitting warning calls unconsciously. Infuriated they refuse any hospital staff to accompany them. Then they help Harry regain his senses and take him to Italy.
Large, fat tears of fright rolled down her cheeks and the poor thing pressed her fingers into her cheek bones as she delivered the terrible news.
Once he deduces that Harry is becoming a submissive Vykélari, Lucius sends his son and Blaise to St. Mungo's to help him through the inheritance and then take him to Italy to mate him. The two Slytherins reluctantly comply.
The woman drawled and the door opened a little bit more to reveal the tall, proud figure of Narcissa Malfoy, wearing an elegant long dress of dark, almost black silk.
"Don't worry, you no longer have to fear them." Almost Blaise could have sneered spitefully at this ignorant statement. Never, not once in his life, had Harry James Potter been truly afraid of either him or Draco. He was brave, their Gryffindor, foolishly so sometimes, but he wouldn't have him any other way: proud, defiant and bowing to no one! No one. Least of all Blaise's own relatives.
Harry reached out for him, a smile on his lips that was painful to watch, and he clasped the blond's pale hand in his for a moment. It was the first contact he had initiated himself between them, a fact that at that moment only Blaise realised. "I know, Draco. And the worst is: I cannot even fault you for that vigilantism mentality. Since you cannot go to the Ministry and be sure that a complaint or report will actually be investigated, you have to counter grievances against you or your family yourself. Nowadays a wizard in England cannot be sure that a crime will be punished by those who should enforce the law. I understand that. But it is wrong! It's so wrong on so many levels… I don't want to be an Auror if this is what I'll be defending."
He tried to bring up his hands to stroke over those strong shoulders, fully intending to let them glide downwards and tease over the skin on his lover's side and let them twine around his torso to gain enough leverage to reverse their positions. But he found himself unable to and he looked up: his hands were tied to the headboard, loosely enough to not hurt him but firmly enough to bereave him of the chance to break free.
wood where his wand should have lain. At that sight Harry swore and cursed mentally, but never one to just give up, he quickly decided to take cover behind the bed or a chair or use whatever hideout this room he was in would offer him and avoid a direct confrontation at all cost while attempting to escape. If his enemy was armed he had no chance to defend himself, no chance at all.
Blaise had no idea whether he should be more furious or more impressed by what he read in the article. As someone who had used a manipulation of the press as a means to achieve his goals in the past, he certainly had to concede a certain amount of aptness to that Crane.
Not letting himself be distracted for long, Harry opened the drawers of the wall unit, one after the other until he had found what he had searched for: letter paper; thick, gold-bordered, luxurious letter paper with a Pegasus embedded as a water mark.
Suddenly the same cold voice as earlier interrupted his miserable labyrinth of thoughts, but more steely and hard, a sharp note of censure tinging it, as if his blackmailer could think of nothing more vexing than Harry's lack of politeness. "If I ask you a question, Mr Potter, I expect you to answer it."
“How?” she ground out, “How do you know they are fine? How is it that you had all this information, conveniently before us?”
Harry stared, he knew he did, but he really couldn't stop himself. Draco Malfoy, the top dog of Slytherin House being … if not reproved then at least reminded to act polite by another Slytherin. It was … grotesque. But Harry remembered the way Zabini had threatened him last night when he had bitten the blonde and his suspicion that their relationship was somewhat deeper than that of the Ice Prince to one of his cronies. It seemed he was more than right.
"I mean that he is starting to enjoy his inheritance, he likes the flying for example, and other aspects. And he just began to stop acting as if all of this would just vanish if only he ignored it determinedly enough."
One could argue that it might have been more efficient to just change the wards but neither Blaise nor Draco were exceptionally experienced and a mistake could weaken the Manor's defences considerably, a danger they weren't prepared to risk.
"Feel if I'm lying, Harry." He said and waited. He had enough of Harry doubting them and this was the only way he could think of, to make the gryphon believe and trust them.
Warily he looked down to the pale sparks vanishing into his skin, unable to keep himself from wondering whether they were somehow moulding his emotions again. He didn't think so, but still... Harry just didn't know if he wanted to come into close contact with that magic again.
For a moment, Draco had kept playing with his wand in frustrated resignation, the hawthorn wand that Harry Potter had returned to him, honestly regretting that what should have been the last experiment of his young life would have to be postponed.
Draco shook his head, a jerky movement betraying his turmoil. "We swore to not let anyone force him into a mating bond."
"Yeah?" Harry said a little bit warily, shifting his chin to the side and once again starting to torture the knuckles of his right hand as he considered them carefully. One of them gave a dull clunk, making Blaise's fingers itch in sympathy and with the want to keep the other young man from fidgeting, but he controlled himself under the Gryffindor's assessing gaze.
Still, Blaise himself very well knew that the outcome of such a confrontation was more than just uncertain. He himself was no experienced fighter and Draco would probably be busy enough trying to keep Harry from handing himself over.
It was not something he'd particularly enjoy doing – or, to be honest, it was rather the thought of confessing to Harry later, that disagreed with him. But he would nonetheless see it through and brave the consequences once they arose. If he could concentrate enough to manipulate the Pensieve without a wand, that is…
"Oh my god." Harry whispered. He looked to Blaise again, caught the traitorous shimmering of a disillusionment charm right above Blaise's hand, but felt unable to tear his thoughts away from his realisation. Not even when after a moment and quiet click a delicate, thin bracelet dangled from the Italian's finger, no longer invisible.
Reluctantly Draco had to admit that it was ingenious; a clever fallback option in case the actual plan had failed and Harry either had went to Draco and Blaise for help or had been hindered in his escape from the manor. Harry wouldn't be able to identify his kidnappers until after he had left the protection of Blaise and Draco and met his future mate.
But Draco just smiled. Maybe this would become a difficult long-time project just like that damned vanishing cabinet; but this time, he was sure, the result would be much more satisfying.
It seemed ludicrous, but Harry was sparing Taide, and thus it stood to reason that he would recognize him and Blaise as well and refrain to attack them… perhaps they might even calm him enough to be saved. Because if Valerio had been right (and Draco thought he was) leading someone through their inheritance created a bond of trust on an instinctive level, so deeply ingrained that his magic, which was after all guided by those very instincts, would see them as someone to look to for protection.
to understand, didn't want to know and the precious fire in his eyes that had always burned so brightly and made people follow him might be extinguished.
His eyes flitted towards his fiancé and there must have been some form of silent communication between them, because Blaise gave a curt nod before standing himself and pulling Harry to his feet. "I'll accompany you to your rooms."
He recovered quickly though and then a smirk played around his lips in the fallacious knowledge that he was already safe. And then his lips were moving and Draco could have sworn that his heart missed a beat and Blaise all but ran forward.
Harry shook his head but gestured towards his eyes with is free hand. God, not being able to speak was so frustrating… fortunately the other two men seemed to have understood what he wanted: One of them came to stand behind him again, laid one hand on his forehead and guided his head backwards until it rested on a hard, muscular shoulder. Harry frowned for a moment, becoming aware that he must be at least a few inches smaller.
And he allowed his magic to force his mask and markings forward, the energizing lines on the skin along the sides of his ribcage and around his eyes, and he shook forth the feathers in his hair and felt the claws sprout from his fingertips, curvy and sharp and dangerous, dripping and hissing with poison, to remind the other that he had the power to back his threats, too.
"Tragically, that single fervent wish, that fracture of a second, causes it to happen and you will never even know, because you will have lost consciousness and soon die of magical exhaustion. There is no taking it back. With your magic and the impulse to attack you also unleash your fear, anger and pain, all great motivators for cruelty."
Draco blinked, then looked up, aghast. "God, Blaise, my father! Merlin, I'll kill you! Did you have to be so rough knowing we'd meet with him? If I can't walk or sit down in front of him without wincing, I'll castrate you! Would rid me of some major problems!"
"He loves me, Draco." The man said in answer to Draco's exclamation, calmly as if he had stated an axiom, an unchallengeable, irrefutable point of reason stifling every possible refutation.
Tightening his hold on her, Draco looked back towards Blaise, who had followed him with a bit of a distance. He knew his lover would not approve, would at the very least insist on doing it together so that the birds would have to divide their attention; and that could not be allowed to happen, Draco didn’t want Blaise down there with possibly murderous beasts, couldn’t bear it.
"I don't want to" Blaise murmured with a gentler voice, leaning forward to place a kiss on Harry's forehead, causing the feather-crowned head to whip up so quickly that it missed his nose by millimetres only.
Afterwards they talk: Harry forgives Draco for his past wrongdoings. They speak about career choices and when Harry says he doesn't want to become an Auror Blaise proposes a political career for Harry and Draco promises to support him if he chose such a path. Draco leaves to speak with Adler.
Growling, the Italian pushed forward to lock his lips onto Draco's, kissing him harshly, demandingly with more raw passion than finesse and still, it was nothing less than mind-blowing in both of their maybe not-so-humble opinions.
No, there was really only one choice, one possibility to examine the various contents in a short amount of time and catching up to those that were happening
Aside from that Harry was easy to be around and – Blaise had never thought he might admit as much willingly … ever – quick-witted and bright enough to hold his own in a discussion against two well-bred purebloods like Draco and himself. Indeed, what he lacked in eloquence, he more than made up for with pure logic and zeal, so that despite his own opinions, Blaise found Harry's political views refreshing. The Saviour probably didn't know it, wouldn't even understand it if Blaise mentioned it, but there was no denying it nonetheless: he was inspiring. The war had left him with the flair of a leader and how he had spoken earlier … just like a damned brilliant political speaker. If he could learn to talk like this in front of hundreds of people, he could sway the emotions of the masses and make his tool of them. Not that he would ever tell Harry so. The Gryffindor would probably take it the wrong way and see it as a dark gift like his Parseltongue. Apropos … if Harry might be persuaded to speak for them?
Encountering Potter's intense glare calmly for a moment longer, Blaise flicked his wand at the two guest chairs in front of his desk, levitating them close for himself and Draco.
"Master?" Alfar asked from his side, large eyes switching from him to Harry and Blaise didn't know what to answer: stunning him in the air – too close to the ground to safely levitate him especially considering his reckless speed yet too far from it that a fall would not injure him severely – was madness and something he hadn't contemplated when giving his instructions to the House Elves.
"Leering at him as if you wanted to devour him whole… did you want to?" Blaise cocked his head as he asked the question, wondering if his fiancé would be honest or if he would try to evade, make excuses. For some moments of silence it seemed that he would.
Draco shook his head jerkily to ban the sudden light-headedness threatening to make him feel faint and slightly sick, trying to ignore that inner conflict, this paradox. It was unimportant, insignificant, unrelated to the happenings of the past day!
At the same time, Blaise started seething inwardly, shivering with suppressed rage like a rattle snake about to strike. How dare they, how dare they ask this of them, how dare that man try to guilt-trap his lover when it had been Lucius who had almost brought about the Malfoy family's ruin? How dare he make his fiancé feel inadequate?
If Blaise had taken a hold of both of Harry's ankles, he might not have succeeded in slowing the Gryffindor enough to prevent both of them from passing the wards in the last moment. But as it was, Harry couldn't assume the correct pose for flying once again: he couldn't straighten, didn't manage to get his legs in one line with his torso; even worse: the heavy weight of the Italian's body, hanging so suddenly from only one of his legs, threw him completely off course.
Free like a basilisk that had been caged for centuries to now be released on unsuspecting victims and rip them apart, those who deserved it!
Thankfully for once the other two young men chose not to bask in his embarrassment for too long, though it was debatable whether the alternative was better.
"Good" Blaise continued completely unperturbed. He merely grasped Draco's hand and pulled him backwards while he fixed Harry with a playful glance in a vague attempt of saving the mood "Now, do you want to come swimming?"
At least the majority of the blood was likely to be his own, Severus thought with an odd sense of detachment. It would have been too much to ask for, that for once another but Potter should end up unconscious and in need of intensive medical care. After all these years he was still like a suicidal toddler, always looking for the next opportunity to off himself in a new, inventive way.
At that, Draco's gaze turned just that bit sharper and he sat up straighter. "If someone hurt a member of my family, or a close friend… or
What could have happened for only one of them to evacuate? Who could have found the boys, found out they were even in Italy? Who could have entered Lanai manor and how and why? Was it due to Potter and his inheritance or some self-proclaimed revenger infuriated that Draco had so recently been acquitted?
He knew a dark curse that wizards had sometimes used in medieval times which would make a circular scission around the belly and back of the victim and then peel the skin upwards, severing it from the flesh up to just below the armpits. The skin would melt together above the head and the victim would suffocate in a bag of his own skin.
And she could deal with the Dark Lord having lost the war. Even though some things might have been better if he hadn't. But really, the last year in Hogwarts had been so ... messy! And depressing. Everywhere she had looked there were students playing martyrs, which was plain right stupid when they just could have spared themselves the pain, played along and waited for the right time to strike. That would have been the intelligent thing to do, the Slytherin thing to do. Alas! The majority of Hogwarts consisted of moronic not-snakes. Pansy hated martyrs with fervour, almost as much as she hated lunatics and some of the new teachers had been undeniably lunatic. She even thought Headmaster Snape had disliked them and
"You want me to jump?" Harry repeated incredulously, wishing he could actually look into Blaise’s or Draco’s face to gauge their sincerity, but he was honestly too busy staring over the edge of their chariot at over three kilometres of thin air and a shockingly solid ground.
"Oh. Yeah, of course." Harry muttered bitterly, thinking back to the hardwearing cotton T-shirt and  the sweater he had worn that full-moon night, then quietly pulled off the light blue shirt, which Harry thought, was a lot thinner than what he had been wearing then and might have ripped more easily, not bruising his growing wings. It explained much and not for the first time, Harry found himself envious of the two Slytherins for having known, for having been prepared. He could have been spared so much pain and confusion, not to say panic.
Draco was surprised that the Italian had even bothered to ask, having expected him to merely threaten them some more about the possible repercussions of calumny. But the end result was the same.
Had he really allowed his guard to drop that much just from the simple relief that the connection had not proven to be unbearable and from whatever elusive dreams of security and warmth were to be had in that pretence of a bond? For it hadn't even been a real bond.
Thoughtfully and a little bit concerned he considered the blond Slytherin in the mirror, looking at their reflections over one of his pale shoulders – which were broader than normal with the additional wing muscles – right into the delicately chiselled features.
"He is safe, Mr Weasley, as Mr Henderson undoubtedly told you. But for his safety it is also imperative that no one learns of his current location." Narcissa smiled sweetly at them, but so obviously feigned, it was sickening.
"Yeah?" Ron raised the mirror in front of him, almost like a protective shield. "Mine are not too bad as well..."
Therefore it was as much a relief to not have to distrust the two Slytherins for not keeping their promise to him as it was to see Ron and Hermione again.
Merlin, it had only been a day. One single day and already he was determined to keep a tight hold of
He didn't turn around when he heard the rhythmic clicks of heels on the wooden panels of the library, nor did he acknowledge the presence of his wife until she stood directly behind him and laid her hands onto his shoulders, stroking out and kneading his hard, tightly wound muscles. Only his pride kept him from moaning right then and there as he relaxed beneath her skilled touch.
But as Draco had said that day they went swimming in the sea: for the two Slytherins all that they had given him so far was nothing extraordinary. And it wasn't as if Harry would ever need them to finance such kinds of activities if he decided that he didn’t want them to stay something extraordinary for him either: even if he decided not to mate his two hosts, even if he managed to get away with mating no one at all, Harry was still the sole heir to the Potter fortune and had inherited most of Sirius' possessions as well. He would never have to depend on anyone to uphold or reach a certain live standard and his hosts knew that well.
Together with the article's title, emblazoned in big letters above it all, the collage was more than disheartening.
to be a good person, both of you, or you would have tried to blackmail me already into mating. Or at least Ives said that."
If he managed to weather the storm brewing between Italy and Britain, Nascimbeni thought he might even come out of this scandal with a couple political enemies less...
Because for once the boy was silent and still before him; for once Severus had to face him without the rebellious, defiant eyes challenging him, mocking him, distracting him and giving him all the excuses he needed to bask in his hate and disgust. Perhaps for the first time ever in their entire thorny history, Severus was incapable of ignoring all the glaring counterevidence of everything that he had wanted to believe in for years.
"Don't play games with me!" He growled bitterly, his helplessness and the humiliation at being described this way in front of his most trusted companions gnawing at him, etching at the friable façade about to crumble away from him. The fear of what his magic might do if he lost control, of what these men might do in retaliation was like a knife of frozen venom in his guts, searing, sickening, petrifying. He just wanted for all of this to end, just wanted to know Ron and Mione safely back in England and for this to never have happened.
Blaise stared at the young submissive, his brows drawn together as he took in the other teen's posture that screamed of intense discomfort; the shoulders were hunched, every muscle tensed tightly as if he was already in pain.
"Now." He said with finality. "I will give you the proof you asked for and even more: an incentive that I think will greatly improve your – and our – determination to bring this to a quick conclusion."
Harry had no time to be surprised before the red beam of light hit him and his vision went black as he crumbled into the harmless emerald flames.
Infuriatingly, Malfoy regarded him with a genuinely amused expression now, as if he found his naivety endearing. "You think this was bribery?"
The cloister garden itself looked as if a bomb had detonated in its centre and the destruction was devastating. Trees, bushes, decorations… everything had been uprooted, swept away and thrashed to the ground and obviously at some point set on fire. The smouldering wreckage was now lying in concentric lines around the column of burning birds that stretched towards the sky, like nightmarish stylized sun beams that venerated Harry’s horrific creation.
, not taking to the air because there in the black nocturnal sky Draco was the more experienced one and wings were much more difficult to handle than brooms; he would be able to outfly the submissive before he had achieved enough height. By Morgaine and Mordred and the great Merlin himself, Harry shouldn't be able to run faster than Draco was flying, it was a physical impossibility. And yet…
Intent on bidding the other two parts of his triumvirate goodbye for now, Harry turned back around just to halt and frown at the hard and intent expression on Ron's face as he stared at the Slytherins while he tapped with the forefinger of his right hand against a point on his unclothed left forearm. The gesture seemed oddly ominous, almost, like the bared teeth of a manticore.
"Did you touch him?" He asked in a low murmur, deceptively gently nibbling at the other young man's earlobe as he rocked against him, making him shudder and arch into his movements.
Something twitched in the wizard's face, a little bit of the haughty, calm sophistication falling away like spalling paint to reveal some of the ugly, mad darkness lurking beneath but it was gone just as quickly like the shadow of a hunting peregrine rushing past, and Harry wasn't even sure he had seen it at all.
The two portraits, while being somewhat shocked at the article (well, truthfully Draco was not sure if Adler had been fazed at all, but Ives' eyes had betrayed his inner feelings, widening and flickering towards his husband's unwavering, stony expression) they had not been overly surprised by Lucius' and their mothers' behaviour but alarmed nonetheless and they had advised them to take precautionary measures now that Harry's status as a submissive had become common knowledge – not that that piece of advice had been in any way necessary. Sometimes Adler was just overbearing.
Now, Severus Snape had been called many a vile thing in his life, but not once a fool. His spellwork had been flawless as always, as were the potions, and he knew that it was impossible for there to have been any unwanted interactions between the two.
But despite his considerable talent as an actor, Draco could see Harry hesitating and he prayed the Gryffindor would be sensible enough to not press him now, even if he noticed anything wrong. For some gruellingly long moments, the brunet watched Draco's reflection in the mirror before he seemed to come to some conclusion, fortunately one in Draco's favour: with an almost imperceptible shrug and a curt nod, he said "Yeah, lets."
With a humourless snort, Draco faced him, letting him see the acidic anger still raging in his eyes. "Is that so? It definitely sounded different a minute ago."
"Don't try to use your magic, sottomesso, or you will be drained." The man advised gravely, voice hard, before tiling his head sideways and calling out "Find me that collar!"
It was an arduous endeavour with the boy still caught in the stasis spell, stiff and frozen in an outstretched position that was extremely inconvenient for levitating down overly narrow spiral staircases, but with a calm hand and a few precautionary cushioning charms Severus and Potter finally reached the lowest level barely half an hour after his arrival.
"I think he and Granger were used to blackmail Harry into leaving the manor." Blaise answered with a hint of hesitation, knowing that what he said sounded more like a spontaneously spun lie than the truth it actually was, an unsteady card house build in a rush and unfit to survive even the slightest hint of breath.
And yet, this Malfoy was special to him, because under the tutelage of Cygnus Malfoy's painting, Severus had learned more about the finer arts of potions than any book or professor had ever managed to teach him.
"My mother will probably have told them, I don't imagine your little sidekicks will be happy to find out that you're no longer within the wards of St. Mungo's, but as they saw me and Blaise there, they will know whom to ask."
"Do we have to speak of this now?" The 'or ever' rang clearly with the annoyance in his tone. "Don't ruin a beautiful day with something as inconsequential as this. Besides: it is late, we should…"
Draco's godfather was the only wizard able to fight off both Narcissa and Amalyne and could be trusted not to expose them to the Aurors afterwards. And Severus was also the only one besides their parents, who knew the exact location of the safe house.
Slowly, Lucius stood, an imposing figure now as his body stretched to its full height. Draco had always envied his father for his redoubtable presence commanding respect so easily, but right now the vision was cracked by his earlier loss of control, at least in Blaise's opinion, who nurtured his indignation in silence at Draco's side, angry that they would endanger his and Draco's and Harry's happiness in order to avoid facing the consequences of their own foolishness.
Draco snorted. "I know. But instead he established himself as the wise saint and us as the well-meaning but misguided kidnappers. Whatever we do now, it will be too late, Harry will think - and rightly so - that we were forced into action by Ives… and all the while Harry is acting a part, playing the eager and willing student, the grateful and understanding protégé… he even more or less allowed us to court him for the sake of appearances solely! He would have made a good Slytherin."
Draco chuckled. It hadn't been a very long kiss then. Maybe it was petty, but he did feel a little bit assuaged at that and in a show of his approval he rewarded the dark skinned Italian by once again closing the fingers of his right hand around his lover's agonizingly swollen shaft, starting to stroke and tease the engorged, hot flesh in his hand, every once in a while pausing to caress the weeping tip with his thumb in slow circles, gathering the precome and spreading it over Blaise's erection as he did so.
Quickly he jumped up, not able to stand being in a more vulnerable position, a position of inferiority, not while he was still feeling so jittery from the binding of his magic. The need to be on a more equal level with his blackmailer, right now, right there, suddenly seemed as vital as breathing even if it meant gulping down the feint nausea the fast movement brought.
“And try to keep as still as possible” And Draco smirked, he must be smirking, Harry thought, and they must have noticed that Draco’s closeness and the way the blonde’s body had folded around his naked torso made his skin crawl, not in an entirely negative way. And gods, it was all so much more intense because he couldn’t see a damn thing!
Blaise licked his lips, interrupting his speech to take a much needed, deep breath. In front of him, Daphne had tilted her head, her face having closed off. It was still grim in its cold beauty, still free of compassion, like the harsh surface of a frozen and snow covered lake. But at least she was listening.
Was he aware of just how daring a plan this was, how dangerous? Almost gryffindorish in its nature this plot could – and most likely would – end in Hermione's and Ron's certain death, maybe even Harry's, or, however unlikely, it could mean their escape. Nothing in between. In any case it would culminate in nothing short of a contest of determination, the outcome of which depended on so many circumstances Harry couldn't possibly predict with his very limited knowledge about his enemy… he was highly disadvantaged.
"It seems Miss Crane's appeal to the public might influence the outcome of my father's trial in two weeks negatively." Draco administered the explanation with a detached coolness, it was either that or having the claws prickling under the nails at his fingertips ripping out of him. His fingers twitched already as it was. "Consequently our parents now wish for us to mate Harry and bring him home."
His eyes rushed over the drama being played out in front of him, greedily taking in every ounce of information, registering the man in the mirror next to Hermione's frail-looking form, but dismissing him as an immediate threat to himself and his friends almost instantaneously, because though his wand was easily reachable in the black holster at his side, laced with silver runes for protection and strength, his stance was relaxed, unconcerned even and his arms were folded behind his back – secure and confident in the knowledge that Harry couldn't do anything to him over the delicate magical connection of the two-way-mirrors.
"You are making a mistake!" He growled lowly at the young, brunet man who had freed him and who was still regarding him as if he was dried flobberworm mucus dirtying his boots (which were undoubtedly of imitation dragon leather, anyway). How he wanted to smash the pretentious idiot's nose in!
He could feel Blaise's length, once again stiff and swollen against his stomach and he smirked at the dishevelled look, the dark brown locks, wet with sweat, clinging to his forehead, lips bruised and eyes clenched.
Now Zabini and Malfoy had to take him seriously, now they had to call their own behaviour into question and wonder if they would get away with the usual treatment of submissives.
"No, Harry, I won't. Now listen!" With a quick glance towards his fiancé he assured himself that Blaise would take care of their unbidden guests while he kept their Gryffindor safe, then he turned to Harry again, cupping one of those soft cheeks with his free hand, his resolve steeling when he felt the crusty residue of tears.
They didn't notice the loud crack behind them as Alfar vanished, because Potter stepped into the flames that were now licking harmlessly at his legs and the man turned, his eyes widening as he saw them.
Immediately the stag was in front of him, its antlers lowered threateningly against him. Taide could not stop in time, ran right into the sharp dagger-like tips. The force of the impact and the agonizing pain from multiple stab wounds all over his torso pushed all air from his lungs and he couldn’t even scream as he was thrown away like a puppet, crashing against the broken remains of a tree and the world darkened to a merciful black around him.
But the group didn't seem bothered by the wilful demeanour of their charges. With their fingers intertwined with the harnesses they looked up to Blaise, Harry and Draco as they descended the stairs, all dark, keen eyes, and wide rough smiles splitting angular faces that bore a strong enough resemblance for them to be related in some way or another. The youngest, a teenager who couldn't be older than fourteen, maybe fifteen, waved an enthusiastic greeting towards them which Blaise and Draco returned, albeit a bit more reserved.
Instead of an answer, though, he only got a counter question, insistently asked. "Did the bond remain after you broke physical contact?"
Taking a deep breath, Harry looked up at them with a self-deprecating half-smile. "So, I promised Ives I'd give you a fair chance."
Moving forward again, Draco leaned against his lover, putting his free hands over the dark ones that fanned out over the wall, rubbing his erection teasingly against that crack where he'd bury himself soon, letting Blaise feel all of him.
Draco stopped short. By Merlin, his magic! It was very much sentient… whether in its own right, or because it was a part of Harry’s subconscious, it didn’t matter… it was capable of feelings and logic, as primitive as it might be. Even with Harry out cold, his magic would still be capable of making decisions.
"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley!" The elder of the two healers exclaimed angrily, stressing every word he spoke. "We are in a hospital! Please keep your family from disturbing the peace and quiet of our patients or I will have to insist you leave."
It was dangerous ground the two of them were moving on, and maybe it was too early to touch upon that part of their shared history, but now it had happened and someday the subject would have to be broached anyway.
"Yes, Harry wrote that letter, I won't deny it." He rushed to speak. "But he didn't attack me because I threatened him, but because I was trying to make him accept his inheritance, despite him being agitated over the whole 'submissive' thing. It was an accident that surprised him as much as it did us, and afterwards he agreed to have us teach him how to control his magic. And we only used magical impulses on him during his first transformation, when he couldn't hear or see or speak. He was hurt and afraid; it was the only possibility to calm him down!"
Draco had learned to read her well when she was like this, unaccustomed as he had been to dealing with truly dangerous men; because the little hints she had given him had been, well, not quite vital but at least essential to his well-being.
It was as if they recognized him, Blaise thought; but if that was the case, they had recognized Alfar as well, recognized him as the Elf that had attacked Harry with a stunning spell when he had tried to flee Lanai Manor after being brought there against his will, and as the Elf that had attacked them just now.
"Put it on him and kill the girl." Valerio ordered quietly, so damn quietly and Harry didn't know whether to scream or sob.
The offended Slytherin merely gave an annoyed huff, lifted his own feathered wings and shifted them forwards as if he intended to embrace Harry and Blaise in them, but he stopped in time, letting them hover over the two of them like a protective barrier instead. He didn't grace his fiancé with a single glance as he stepped closer to the boy in front of him, trying awkwardly to draw him in a loose hug from behind – which presented itself as quite a difficult task, seeing as Harry's still respectable, though smaller, wings were in the way. Finally he settled with putting his hands on Harry's slim hip and laying his chin on his shoulder.
“Yes, of course, I’m sorry. Your son’s engagement party, isn’t it? I read it in the announcement you made in the Daily Prophet –”
Seven years, seven years of battling trolls and monsters together and Death Eaters and Dark Lords, of surviving against all odds only to be cut down and slaughtered like a pig!
"Mr Potter is not allowed to leave the grounds." He heard Zabini's imperious voice and stiffly and very slowly, he turned. Zabini had stood finally, bracing himself against the tessellated table with both hands, leaning forward menacingly. His hard gaze bore into Harry as he addressed his servants without even sparing them one glance. Next to him, Malfoy watched him with a carefully neutral expression but Harry thought he saw the corner of his mouth twitch suspiciously and that made him want to scream and rant and shout at them.
Although Harry had again been tense around them at first, and their conversations awkward at best, the rest of the day had done them much good and in the end it had even been rather enjoyable .
That had earned him nothing but more amusement from both Draco and Blaise and an Italian translation of Draco's words, which hadn't helped him either. But, well, in the end he had readily agreed to the date – and why not? It would be nice to leave the manor. And for the evening he'd been left in peace so that his two dominants could prepare.
The moment Harry started to move, Draco agilely propelled himself forward and out of the window as if he had waited for the other to give him a start signal and perhaps he had, perhaps he had wished and hoped against hope that the brunet might wait and stay long enough for him and Blaise to figure out how to solve this latest problem. But there was no time to contemplate the little sting of disappointment in his chest now at seeing Harry turn away with steely determination.
Since they weren't linked with a physical feature that any other wizard would be able to see and were an immense advantage during a sudden attack, a duel or simply to take notice of things that weren't meant to be noticed (here Draco smirked and winked at Harry conspiratorially, who merely was reminded of Fred and George and their use of extendable ears and thought that maybe they would be able to hit it off with Draco if not for their tiresome family feud…), most Vykélari accepted the minor disadvantages that came with oversensitive senses.
Shaking the gloomy thoughts from his mind, Ron slowly made his way back into the Burrow and the kitchen, the mirror clutched in his hand.
"Nothing wrong, Harry, sweet." He said with disarming nonchalance before he reached out for him, and – raising and folding his wings so Harry could pass through beneath them, he steered him forwards by the gentle grip on his shoulder until Harry stood in front of him, encountering the steel grey eyes in the mirror. "Why don't you try to transform now?"
It didn't work though, and soon Harry blinked his eyes open again to a bright-lit room, stretching his sore muscles out on the wonderfully soft bed that just seemed to cradle his body as if suffused with cushioning charms. It soothed his aching muscles well enough and soon he slid back into sleepiness, feeling as comfortable, warm and relaxed as the soreness in his body would allow him to; too relaxed and too drowsy to spend time on pondering why there was a beautifully painted fresco adorning the ceiling above his head.
"I know I haven't been the best of friends to you, Daphne." He began, trying to feel his way around cautiously and appeal to the familiarity they used to share and to the esteem they used to hold each other in. This mutual respect couldn't have been erased so quickly, and maybe it was enough to make her re-evaluate her opinion on the no doubt awful rumours surrounding him and Draco. But Daphne remained the image of uncooperativeness in her silence and stillness, her lips pursed as she regarded him.
Draco bit his lips, frustrated beyond measure. Damn it, what accursed thing had caused the bastard to think Draco needed soothing? God, by Mordred and his twisted mother and the Seven Sisters and who else "Fuck me, now!"
"Finally Mr Potter," The portrait smiled, "and I thought you would leave me waiting here. I'm pleased to meet you." He inclined his head slightly in greeting.
Draco looked back at him, his eyes gleaming and the corners of his mouth twitching into an unwilling smile. "You are right. And?"
Blaise fell silent, looking asquint at his lover to take over. After all it was due to Lucius Malfoy that their parents had now become shadows in Harry's foe glass and it was only right that Draco was the one to tell him that.
By Merlin, nothing it seemed had escaped their Gryffindor’s wrath: The buildings surrounding the cloister garden were well ablaze. The formerly white walls were blackened with soot and the rendering cracked and crumbled under the infernal heat. Flames crawled along the houses and stretched ravenous tongues of fire out of the windows, licking the frames in hunger and anticipation for more to devour: more stone, more wood, more flesh.
Although not tired enough that Harry hadn't wanted to ask for a moment about who had changed his clothes after he had been brought to Lanai Manor, but while his sluggish mind had still dithered, torn between embarrassment and indignation, Zabini had spoken up and made the decision for him. The Italian had explained about the suite of rooms Harry had been given and told him not to hesitate to call upon the House Elves, should he have need of anything. With that, both he and Draco bade him goodnight and left him alone.
But those wraithlike shadows should never have actually solidified, Harry had never really thought they would, not least because Draco and Blaise had assured him that his friends were safe … Probably. Likely. Maybe.
Soon they rushed their charge to his chambers and Draco vanished behind the curtain to the side of Harry's bed to choose a bathing suit for him.
Hermione and Ron think the article can be used to change the Vykélari laws and could even lead to Lucius' conviction. Harry wants to protect Blaise's and Draco's reputation and asks Hermione to arrange an interview with Crane over the two-way-mirror to relay his viewpoint.
"Have you…?" Narcissa's voice was unusually thick and Amalyne minutely shook her head before remembering how neither of them could bear to look at the other right then.
A rebellious sparkle rose in him and for a moment he wished he could heed it, just because Blaise had been such a bastard about it all and still hadn't apologized or taken back his stupid rules. But that would mean leaving the two dominants and that he couldn't do.
Ron narrowed his eyes dangerously, all his warning bells doing a grand impression of a dramatic hand bell choral in his head. What the hell was that snake doing at the front door of the Burrow at a Monday morning, before even the owl from the Daily Prophet had arrived?
"Eleuterio is a highly respectable man and furthermore a good friend of mine, so watch what you say, boy!" The man warned, thrusting his finger into Draco's shoulder so hard that he had to take a step back and Blaise snarled, his elongated fangs exposed threateningly, as he pushed himself partly in front of his lover.
But Blaise merely teased his way down to his navel, dipping his tongue inside for a moment, relishing in the desperate moans that action elicited from his platinum blond treasure.
Valerio craned his neck, glancing down at the still body of his uncle, his lips distorting into something ugly for a moment or two. Then he clicked his tongue in displeasure, raising his intent gaze to Harry's, full of unyielding determination.
But the Golden Gryffindor had forgiven them, had forgiven Draco, and now he accepted their teaching, and was even trying himself to make his stay pleasant for all of them. And pleasant it was, very much so. After today, Blaise rather thought he would enjoy teaching the boy, he was a quick learner and his amazement at every discovery he made was infectious.
Uselessly, Harry's hand clenched around the thin air at his hip where his wand should have been. The emptiness made his stomach churn uncomfortably. It wouldn't be the first time he'd have to face a potential threat unarmed, though.
"No, listen," Amalyne pressed when Narcissa made to interrupt, "so shortly after the war it would not be wise for you to seek the help of former enemies. And you have no way of getting to Italy, you
Alarmed, Blaise eyed his future father-in-law warily, taking in the harsh lines of fury on his face, cracks and fissures in the once so solid wall of control the blonde usually cultivated, wondering when he had ever seen him lose his bearings before like this and coming up blank. He had not been there of course, to see how the Malfoy patriarch had held himself during the war, but the vision he presented now was so far from the sophisticated, superior aristocrat he knew, it made him step back involuntarily, as if loss of control was a disease he might contract.
"'Lyn?" The familiar pet name left her lips before she knew it, her voice unusually rough but Narcissa didn't repeat herself in a useless attempt at seeming stronger and saving face.
"Yes." Draco said tersely, hating how Weasley gave a curt nod as if he had never expected something else. Of course Draco hadn't either, not truly, but that was beside the point! He reigned in the biting comments threatening to spill from his tongue though; Harry surely would not react favourably.
He really didn't know. Never had he truly harmed an innocent. Never… but he'd never had to weigh up his friends' lives against that of an innocent bystander either.
"Gladly, Healer…" Draco said, raising an eyebrow in question while they passed the group of red heads, who were still glaring daggers at them… well, at least the younger generation.
Severus narrowed his eyes. For some reason the gesture irked him, more than it should and it took an uncomfortable amount of effort to take his eyes away from it and fix them on Narcissa's glowing face.
So he let it be when Draco cocked his head and smiled at him as if he didn't quite understand what Harry was asking exactly. "Of course... Blaise and I haven't had our final exams and to be honest, the last year was rather... well, I don't think it would be a good idea to try and do the exams now. And you need to finish your education as well, or didn't you want to return to Hogwarts?"
Cruel but direct. Harry still preferred it to any vague hints and nebulous allusions. But Merlin, it was grotesque, the casualness in which he was being informed that he would practically marry a man eight years older than him – which would make him twenty-six.
Furthermore Blaise ordered his servants to intercept all incoming owls and not let their submissive have any letter without them having read it first or at least being present when he read it.
But even before he could finish that thought, a feint stab of insecurity made Blaise's gut churn suddenly. Or would he?
"Oh, so leading him to the table like a fragile gentlewoman was any less conspicuous?" Blaise retorted, his lips curled into a sultry, gently mocking smile; but his eyes were gleaming.
Of course this night they had sent him a note as soon as they had been informed of the portkey's activation, just before Amalyne and Narcissa had departed for Damask Tower. Still, there was simply no possibility that he had arrived before them. He couldn't have, except… except if he had learned that their sons had gotten into trouble before the portkey had been activated in the first place.
"Oh, you didn't mean it like that?" Draco raised his eyebrows and tilted his head, a hint of mocking tinging his voice and Blaise had never heard it like this, so full of bitterness and hurt and accusation. Then it picked up both in passion and in volume and he stood again, unable to stay seated on the bed.
Harry turned his head away and Draco could see the sinews in his throat flexing with the effort not to shout.
This beautifully crafted piece of wood with the unicorn hair embedded deeply within, the trusted friend that had served him so well for so many years… it might refuse to be raised against the Golden Gryffindor who had won it for any kind of offensive magic, even if it was to save him. Hopefully, though, it would allow non-offensive spells.
“Oh, come on, mate!” Ron spoke up, his patronizing voice and expression telling the dark haired wizard just how naïve he thought him to be.
That short glance was all Draco got before he was already past and the ground seemed to jump at him, so sudden was its appearance in his field of vision.
"A-huh." Harry murmured though he really had no idea where that was; he had never been very good at geography. For a moment, he busied himself by watching the liquid swirl around in his glass like molten gold. That was better than trying to hold the Slytherins' weird gazes; those were starting to really freak him out…
“Draco Malfoy is a cruel, petty tyrant; always was and always will be. His father was a Death Eater; he tortured and killed people, for fun! We all
And Potter himself had to bow, even the Boy-Who-Lived would be unable to squirm free with the life debt he owed Narcissa tying him securely.
Narcissa huffed, but then she smirked a little bit and cocked her head. "Well then, I might as well explain. Valett, wine in the arbour."
His lips curled back in a silent snarl as his anger rose again, more powerful with each passing second. Perhaps it was unjust, but he didn't quite care about fairness right now, it was better than feeling helpless and out of his depth. And if he got Harry back, Draco swore he would employ human servants for anything but the simple cleaning tasks, servants that could actually anticipate their master's needs with logic and a brain that weighted more than one and a half pounds! Granger would like that as well, if he had understood their sweet hummingbird correctly…
"We have known each other for years, and I have come to trust you a great deal… I need your help Daphne. My family here in Italy blackmailed Harry and took him away to mate him off to someone else and made the local Aurors believe that they rescued him from me and Draco…"
to touch him in some way or the other, fleeting little gestures that he would never have expected from Blaise or Draco. It almost didn't seem in character for the two Slytherins who didn't feel comfortable sharing their emotions with Harry, who had learned Occlumency, who had seemed so regal and haughty at first when he had come to the manor, aloof almost, certainly arrogant. Two days since then and their behaviour had changed drastically.
But the man wasn't finished by far and he kept on ranting, gibing. "Do you think they love you? Well, let me tell you this: love is a capricious feeling, and easily manipulated by magic. The affection you feel is only an illusion," he spat, his voice full of cold anger, "and it will fade as soon as you find a worthier mate. They have snared you."
"Well, then…" he said finally without a care in the world, uncharacteristically friendly "I guess I don't have anything to lose anymore, do I? I might as well enjoy myself for now…"
Minutes the three of them stayed like that until finally Potter went rigid in Draco's arms, his unseeing eyes blinking in wonder. Then Draco watched those hated rose-petal lips open and letting escape a single chirp that seemed like it was about to erupt into a complex series of trills and high notes but was cut short when Potter shut his mouth, startled and shocked at the sound of his own voice.
At least, being barely a millimetre thick with a magically enlarged centre, and able to find their own way, the wizarding version was rather superior to its muggle model.
"Zabini, Malfoy." Ron nodded once, his jaw and voice tight but for now it should better be enough for those snakes if he conveyed his willingness to talk, they couldn't expect him to be polite.
Gryffindor's safety, even if Harry grew to hate him for it. Draco wouldn't force himself to endure the torture of standing back and watching Harry throw himself away, his life, his happiness; Harry couldn't expect him to.
"See you later," Harry called out to them, catching the barest hint of a smirk as Blaise closed the door after them. He was oddly relieved that they had kept their promise, not that he had really doubted them since their temporary bond the day before. But still, two days for establishing such a connection from Britain to Italy couldn't have been an easy feat, not with two wizarding ministries involved and no friend locally in Britain who would have had a personal interest in helping; at least Harry couldn't imagine that the Malfoys or Zabinis would gladly commit themselves to assisting Harry to speak with bloodtraitors and 'mudbloods'. Something could have gone wrong, something even out of Draco's and Blaise's range of influence and caused them to fall short of their pledge. Harry might not even have believed them in such a case.
That sound alone had Ettore's skin crawl, but it was their faces that made him freeze with the instinctual fear of prey caught in the gaze of a superior predator.
I gave an extensive explanation for their behaviour in the review replies for the last chapter. If after reading that you still think that you never ever could forgive them their deeds even if they had a total change of heart and you still want to see them dead, I advice you to discontinue reading, you won't ever grow to like Night Flight.
And then the thick head of Blaise's oil covered hard-on nudged against his tight, un-stretched entrance and slowly, ever so slowly, the bastard pushed downwards and in, causing the wrinkled skin to stretch around his penetrating flesh with a shallow, burning pain and Draco hissed but he didn't want it to stop.
"Parkinson!" He said frostily, not so much a greeting as an acknowledgement of her unwelcome, unexpected presence.
"You needn't have done that, Mr Potter." The man remarked coolly after a few more moments of tense silence as hard and chilly as a meters thick ice sheet. "I am willing to meet reasonable demands if they are at all compatible with our own goals. However," he lowered his voice ominously, tilting his head, "I am growing weary of this rebellious streak of yours."
But in the opinion of Mrs Palmer, the situation should not be used, to put purebloods into the pillory.
"Hush, I'm getting to your questions, alright? No need to be so uncouth." Malfoy clicked his tongue disapprovingly and raised his chin, a slight frown creasing his pale brow. Harry wondered absent-mindedly if that was something he had copied from Narcissa Malfoy or from his father.
That's when she detected it. A single sheet of paper hovering directly above the stairs leading to the level below them. With a few steps Narcissa crossed the room and snatched the letter out of the air. Quickly she unfolded it, her gaze flickering to the signature, drawn by the familiar elegant curves. Indeed, it was Severus' writing.
“Yeah, I know…” Draco conceded, standing up and moving towards the door to inform that Cowan. “But whatever happens and wherever he’ll go, in the end we’ll always be the first he’s ever seen with his new eyes, before even seeing himself… he’ll never forget that.” And with those smug words and a smirk on his lips, Draco left.
Suddenly the door to the conference room was pushed open, bouncing off the wall with a loud, resonating bang that pierced Blaise to the core, the too fast beating of his heart stuttering and stumbling as if the pacemaker cells had lost their rhythm like an interrupted music ensemble falling silent one after another.
Then he bit his lips, glancing up to the Slytherin. "But you know, it's okay, I don't think you would deceive me." And Harry was a little bit surprised that he actually meant that.
Now he was doing exactly that. But he didn't seem angry, just uncomfortable and oddly conflicted and Harry remembered how nervous and reluctant the sensations coming from the blond had felt like right at the beginning of the temporary bond. Still it seemed wrong that something he had found so exhilarating, would disconcert Draco so much.
"But not like this. It is too dangerous. You can use the portkey I gave you to return to England and from there you can go anywhere you want. You know the keyword, Harry. Let us just wait until the morning and contact your friends via the two-way-mirror so that they can come and get you from the safe house."
Without any difficulties, Draco had been able to locate an upstart in the Auror department and persuaded him with rather gracious means to see things his way. The right way. His new friend had given him access to all the evidence against Mr. Parkinson and told him which unlucky individuals were going to testify against the father of his friend. Draco had worked day and night for not even one week, bribing, threatening and blackmailing certain witnesses (one he had had to make disappear. He'd paid a muggle to do it; crafty little things those muggles, easy to be swayed and so very imaginative in the art of killing; and no one asked twice why a wizard would be shot in a dark alleyway by a muggle robber. Bad things happened all the time, right? It was a funny thing though, since the incident lead to quite some difficulties between the wizard and the muggle governments, which also helped to divert the public's interest to other more interesting topics than the simple trial of a death eater). Draco had even 'persuaded' a few of the Wizengamot members, forged alibis, found ways to refute the evidence ... then, at the age of barely 18, he had stood before the wizarding court and defended one of the Dark Lord's most famous followers. And managed to get him out with nothing more than a slap on his hand: a year of house arrest and two thousand galleons penalty for the poor guy who had been forced into servitude to such a cruel man and tried to defy him at every opportunity.
"I already know, Draco," he said, his voice tinted with a graveness that Draco didn't like, but after a moment of silence, the propped up hand fell away and Adler smiled at him, a polite, but faked smile. "I spoke with Ives while you were occupied with young Mr Potter… How well your Nightingale did on his beautiful wings; he certainly is a talented flyer."
They were no longer the irritating, easy-to-rile schoolboys he had known, Harry thought as he studied them, even though they were still irritating enough, or maybe even more so now that he was at their mercy and had to take them seriously for once.
Which meant that yes, Weasley was right, and Harry needed to be protected from himself the most. He was powerful, one of the best duellists Blaise had ever seen and intelligent as well, but he didn't know when selfishness was called for.
At the time Harry Potter and Ronald Weasely started their Auror training, Draces Cynn was already owning several restaurants, bookshops, one hair salon and a beauty shop (on Pansy's insistence), groceries, and two apothecaries - one in Hogsmeade and one in Diagon Allay. They were officially one of the most important donors to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries and some major departments of the Ministry itself and furthermore owned a not inconsiderable part of the Daily Prophet.
Carefully he pushed at the soft, downy feathers of his wings, forcing them to open and give his body free, and to his surprise, they fluttered a little bit before pulling themselves right into the skin of his back. For a moment, it felt as if something warm pressed gently but insistently against the places where his wings had sprouted from his torso and then that, too, was gone, leaving him feeling a little bit exhausted, but endlessly relieved.
As always, the summary of the last chapter is in the “What Happened So Far” Chapter, so have a look there first if you feel you need a refresher after all these months.
Draco moaned and hissed and Blaise bit his lips, ever the silent one, his muscles tensing and quivering under the onslaught of sensations.
Harry rubbed his forehead tiredly. "You really think this is necessary? I mean why would someone attack my friends if they can't blackmail me with it? And how would anyone be able to blackmail me when they can't contact me? Nobody knows where we are; I mean that is why you brought me here in the first place, isn't it?"
For a moment a totally crazed part of Harry wanted to ask 'who said I wouldn't?', but he managed to stop himself in time. Honestly, what was he thinking? Or not thinking …
"Are incapable of speech or of holding a feather." Mancini shrugged frustratedly. "We tried having Zabini write in the air with his magic, but a hawk, a thrice damned
Deceptively, Daphne relaxed back into the soft cushions of the arm chair, looking more like a spider pressing back into its hideout to wait for prey than the well-bred pureblood heiress she was. She pursed her lips thoughtfully, but the painful stiffness of her fingers, as if they had been clenched for hours, belied her tenseness.
"That reminds me, could you try to get some of his things from those Weasleys? He needs his glasses and though I don't want to return his wand to him just yet it wouldn't hurt to at least know it is accessible for us."
Because Harry still doesn't really believe them, Draco and Blaise offer to let him question them under veritaserum but Harry instead demands to speak to his friends, telling the Slytherins that he will believe Hermione and Ron. They promise to arrange for Harry to meet his friends on Monday.
Bewildered at the seemingly disjointed statement, Blaise raised a questioning eyebrow at the younger submissive. "Pardon?"
“Oh, god!” he muttered in sheer horror, shivers and violent tremors running down his spine, making his skin crawl and his body shake. Something was sucking up his magic from within!
"I wouldn't expect such good manners from a Half-Blood anyway." The comment didn't hold any sting, not from him, not anymore. He had fought hard for Cygnus Malfoy's respect and he knew he had it.
The blonde rolled his eyes in exasperation. "I tried to give him to you, but somehow the portrait can't be removed from the House and whenever I have the House Elves put it away in a storeroom, he just visits the other portraits in the gallery. I didn't know what to do with him!"
No, Harry didn't plan on dying. Didn't even ponder what he might do if it came to a situation where he had to decide between his friends' and his own life because that would imply the possibility of such an ending and he refused to believe that the probability was above zero.
Blaise chuckled lowly and rolled his shoulders. He could feel his own wings press against the skin of his back, wanting to show themselves, flaunt the blazing tones of bronze, copper and gold to seduce the being in front of him. But Draco wouldn't like that. As a dominant his instincts would tell him that the other male was challenging him, and though Draco would know at heart that that wasn't true, the mood would be destroyed beyond reclaim.
"I might be a submissive Vykélari but I submit to no one! And I hold your very future in my hand: besides absolutely being able to overpower and kill you I would only need to go to the authorities with a pensieve memory of this and have your ass thrown into prison!"
sometimes dreamt of the screams they had heard from the dungeons, where he and Harry had been unable - helpless - to stop it all and save their friend.
Draco could have sworn the moment lasted an eternity. Harry's hair flew in a wild disarray of raven blackness around his head, sharply pointed feathers gleaming in it like dark green glass shards, a glorious frame for the deathly paleness that was his face. The flames flickered, playing games and tricks on the tanned skin, making the markings around his eyes dance.
Until another thought invaded his mind unbidden: if that comforting magic had come from Malfoy and that other man it meant that yes, they had been around him while he was bound, and yes they had cut away whatever had held him down
Harry rushed over, grinning madly as he pressed his hands against the glass, the gesture mirrored on the other side by Ron and Mione.
"No! This madness has gone on long enough: I want to go now! Get me a portkey to London, I want to go home!"
"Oh Merlin, please, Draco! Stop apologizing! I don't want all our conversations to end in apologies…"
He shot up from his chair, swaying a little bit as his battered cardiovascular system fought to keep up with him. But he managed to steady himself with the back of his chair and glared down at the two Slytherins.
The blonde looked back at him over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow, and the grey eyes flashed disapprovingly.
"No one can force us, Draco! We will take him to Italy and grant him protection from other Vykélari until he has some control over his new powers and that is that. We'll see what happens from there. The only thing I envision with absolute certainty in my future is you, Draco. Everyone else is second."
Then, as he saw Draco flying towards him he immediately started cursing and swearing, writhing and struggling uselessly so that the loose pant legs of his pyjamas slid down, exposing naked skin and lean, firm muscles.
It felt horribly as if his very life was pulled back from his limbs up into his torso, leaving them aching with weakness. And it just kept on retreating as if something ripped at the insubstantial force that kept him alive; the little sparks of magic running through his body.
His smile widened as Blaise pulled him closer, locking his arms around his waist, leaning forwards to murmur lowly against his ear “Go on if you’d like.”
"I know that someone is forcing you to do this, but whoever this is and whatever they threatened to do, I don’t care, I won’t let you leave the Manor now!"
Ives smiled. "Another deal then: I will call you Harry and you will never call me Malfoy. I love my husband, learned to love him, really, and I loved many of our common descendants, but aside from Draco I have grown to really dislike the younger generations."
A few minutes later Blaise flew Velia over to their chariot so that the Battellis could take the three vehicles back to their estate somewhere in the north from their current position and leave Draco, Blaise and Harry alone for the rest of their date.
"Enough of that for now." The man finally said after a few more moments of silent assessing, straightening his posture. With an elegant flourish, he raised his wand against himself, murmuring a series of "Finite Incantatem!" and with each of them, a small fraction of the carefully erected image of blandness fell away, revealing a thin, almost gaunt face with hawk eyes and a long, thin nose like a raptor's beak.
So while Hermione didn't even raise her hazel eyes from her lecture, her lips moving incessantly along with the words, Ron and Molly shared a questioning gaze over the paper covered table.
Trying to wrap his mind about that felt a bit as if he was trying to swallow a dry, scrunched up ball of parchment of equally dry 22 inches history of magic homework. It was inconceivable and certainly unprecedented, but it would happen nonetheless: Draco Malfoy was actually going to have to protect the last descendants of a family with which his own had had a blood feud for generations as well as a muggleborn, a girl that had punched him once, for Merlin's sake!
and Malfoy, talking quietly while he himself had dozed peacefully in the cosy sun lounger next to them, the soft white pillows had made him feel as if he was resting on a cloud while he enjoyed the fading warmth of the last sun rays. He had been so tired from swimming for so long, his body still recuperating, and their soft murmurs and the rushing of the waves and the light ocean breeze had lulled him to sleep better than any lullaby could have. Harry frowned as he recalled the vague feeling of gentle hands tucking a blanket around his body, the lingering warmth of another person's skin, the comforting, softly stroking touches as creases in the silken fabric were smoothed out and then when even the last of his muscles could not have relaxed any further… had there been lips pressing a kiss onto his hair? He thought that there might have been a soft movement, so soft that it had tickled him and he had tried to shoo the disturbance away with a careless hand wave …  someone had chuckled… Harry frowned as he tried to recall more, but everything else seemed befogged. The whole end of the evening seemed to blur into the world of dreams and there was no telling what had been reality and what a far too real figment of his vivacious imagination.
Harry didn't know what he had expected to see as Draco stepped aside and pointed towards a large painting to the side of the door with grand gesture and a "Harry, meet Ives Malfoy." But certainly not the handsome young man who looked at him with a mild, warm smile from out of a sea of rose bushes, the soft champagne colour of the blossoms bleeding into a bright red at the edges of each petal. At least he never would have guessed that the platinum blonde Slytherin who was a self declared enemy of the red haired Weasleys would have someone in his family tree with such a multihued mane of autumn hair.
"Yesterday," he started, trying to encounter the heavy stare as calmly as he could, "I wrote a letter to my friends and told them where I am…"
Relieved, Blaise felt his shoulders relax. It wasn't an absolution, but it was an understanding and that was enough. They both had their fair share of accumulated mistakes and they had accepted each other's faults long ago; it was good to know that this argument had not been about long past transgressions. It wouldn't bode well for them and their relationship, if they started to hold their mistakes against each other.
Draco and Blaise briefly locked gazes. They knew what a mating would entail, of course, and it was obvious that the Malfoy patron intended for them to make the submissive theirs… But the time was extremely inconvenient. Even knowing that a submissive would ultimately allow a deeper bond to form between them and increase their magical power many times over – even though the submissive would ensure maintenance of their family line without having to adopt, did they want to put their engagement under the stress of forcing someone new into their life? Into their
That was not what drew his interest, though. No, something intriguing in his posture and expression made Harry take notice, something in the way that he refused to even look remotely in the direction of the submissive so unwillingly abducted into their home and how his arms were folded in front of his chest defensively. If it hadn't been such a grotesque idea Harry would say that this man, who might seem dark and sinister at a first glance, was even more uncomfortable with this mad situation, than Harry. Everything about him screamed of aggravation.
A lazy grin spread over Draco's face. "I asked, mon doux rossignol, if you'd go on a date with us," he repeated after a moment, reaching out to run his hands down Harry's face but he checked himself in time, letting it fall into his lap. He didn't seem embarrassed or disappointed, though, and with the way his grey eyes held Harry's, the Gryffindor couldn't help but wonder if it had been a deliberate gesture, to show Harry that they did respect his wishes.
Long moments passed, while Harry tried to gauge the Slytherin's mood and his reaction. What would he do if they made him leave? Ives' words came to his mind, unbidden, baleful words:
And according to the restaurant's staff, the three men had had a wonderful time together: laughing, joking, dancing. They'd been there for hours.
“Fuck!” Draco moaned. Whether in reaction to what he had told him, or from pain, Blaise didn’t know.
Of course such a method would normally be too crude and unsophisticated and way too messy for Draco and he had never even killed before, but what could he say? It was a good image at that moment.
Draco didn't know what to answer. This had not been expected, not planned. He had been afraid that the intimacy would be too much to bear and that he might break the connection because of that, or that Harry would break it because he found himself unable to accept the sensations of the transformation. He had not expected  to lose himself in it. And that was what had happened: they had breathed as one, their very heartbeat had synchronized. They had manipulated each other's feelings: the excitement and exhilaration that had not been his own, but Harry's! The wonder and fear. The soothing touches from both Blaise and Harry at the beginning before the Slytherins had partly erected Occlumency shields.
When Harry returns to his rooms after the date a dominant Italian Vykélari calls out from the two-way-mirror of which Hermione and Ron have the corresponding mirror. In it Harry sees the Italian standing next to his tied up friends – who seem conspicuously frightened and wrecked though uninjured – in an unfamiliar room. In front of Harry's eyes the man tortures Ron in an attempt to force Harry to leave the manor and mate his son. Harry acquiesces.
Adler looked back at him with an expression that one might read a newspaper with, one of concentration and mild interest, while he sucked up all the information he could get.
But the uncoordinated movements unbalanced the lightweight hospital bed to which Potter was still tied and almost immediately it started to tip over.
"I've done enough fighting for this wizarding world. You know, I never fought for them, I just fought to keep my friends save, because if Voldemort had won, Hermione would have been dead, and Ron, and all my muggleborn friends. And Luna and Neville. And what would have happened to Hagrid?"
The healers fear he won’t survive the night. You can repay your debt by bringing him here: between you and Blaise, you should be able to control and guide his raging magic and keep it from lashing out against everyone else.”
Perhaps the situation was not an entirely unsalvageable disaster. Like his former British colleague Fudge, Nascimbeni had always found non-governmental organisations to be horrible nuisances at best and any chance to restrict their rights was a welcome one.
And for Draco to get his nose rubbed into the flaws of his oh so noble family like this by Adler's husband in front of Harry of all people. Adler who Draco had always tried to impress the most of his family and Harry who had always been the more famous, the more prestigious one of the two, and the magically stronger as well; who had been the object of Draco's obsession for years, the incarnation of all the failures in his youth, of everything he couldn't have, everything he wasn't allowed to be. It had taken a war for Draco to notice that the image he had of the Saviour was nothing more than a projection of his doubts and jealousies and yet that realisation had still not smothered his guilty fascination with the other boy.
Well, he thought, a mild annoyance rising within him, they had better not expect him to become the perfectly well-behaved, eloquent pure-blooded
Besides, in the rare cases that a submissive, or a friend of the submissive, accused a dominant, the Vykélari council used to iron out the problem in one way or another before it reached the public. It wasn't exactly possible to complain that this council had now decided to really enforce the law just to give the submissive to someone else, especially since there was no way to really prove the last part of this claim.
If the wizengamot did not sentence them to a life of imprisonment, they'd be murdered in their beds by his vengeful followers. Narcissa and Draco might be able to flee to a safe house to live out the rest of their days in seclusion, or escape into exile in another country; but Lucius, who was oath-bound not to leave the manor wouldn't have that option. He at least would be at the non-existent mercy of any light wizard in Britain.
Or maybe he shouldn't be scared. Hadn't he tried to convince himself every so often that he had no reason to be intimidated where the two Slytherins were concerned? God, Harry just didn't know anymore.
But little by little they settled down onto the courtyard, covering almost the entire ground with their demonic bodies, a sea of black feathers and bluish white flames. Silence once more spread across the ruins, broken only by sporadic fluttering and the odd angry screech that proved how very ready the beasts were to rise again in a moment’s notice, to rip and claw and hack and kill.
Tassi shook his head, his face lined with deep, grim furrows. "You have to understand: a Vykélari's magic is not directed by exact words, or delicate, choreographed wand movements, but by emotions and intent, rather like the accidental magic of children. Imagine being desperate enough to do something you know will kill you, perhaps driven by fear, by grief, a desire for revenge or even some protective instinct. Without the time to rethink your actions or imagine the consequences, seeing your attackers in front of you, what would be your first impulse? What would you wish for in the sanctity of your mind before rationality, or morality had a chance to temper it?"
Suddenly a powerful jolt went through the arm he held onto, a violent jolt that mercilessly whipped him around like a puppet, ripping the scrawny hand out of his grip. Blaise’s heart seemed to try its hardest to leave his ribcage through his throat as he desperately tried to grasp onto something, anything of the young House Elf that apparated him – if he got lost now, he might get splinted!
And he could almost convince himself that his voice shook with relief as he started to murmur the word that would get him away to "Some-"
Maybe that was why Blaise produced a Pensieve and a wooden box from a tiny, extremely shrunken trunk not unlike the one Harry had seen in the deceased Alastor Moody’s possession (or his imposter’s, actually). It was a 'teatro del pensiero', as Blaise explained to him, a Pensieve Theatre containing the memories of wizarding actors. It was an interactive game insofar as that after every scene the onlookers could decide between different bottled memories, different sceneries, depending on how they wanted the leading actor to behave.
Averting his gaze once more, Draco wondered if he really wanted to answer that question completely truthfully. Here was someone who had done everything this side of the legal to become mated to Ives Prewett; obviously he would not be able to get an unbiased opinion.
"I know." Harry whispered, convinced of the truth of the fiercely spoken words from the feelings projected at him through the connection.
"Uhm…" Harry started, scrambling for something to say even before his hosts had taken their seats (and when the hell had they transformed from enemies and kidnappers to hosts?).
Lucius almost smirked, a hint of respect glinting in his silver eyes. It seemed the boy was not as stupid as he appeared to be; few knew about that long-lost trait.
Draco had returned to the conference room not much later and told his lover the essentials of his findings in hushed voices so that no other would know of the means they had used to come by that information (if anyone learned of the spying potion, questions were bound to arise, questions about where else it had been deployed and that might lead to a reconsideration of Narcissa's and even Draco's cases, not to mention the almost sure conviction of Lucius).
Blaise knew that, because he wanted it also for the Zabinis who had been watching from the sidelines for far too long. Such was the price of neutrality: one ceased to matter after a while.
to Blaise? Damn it… this was so … so … not right! Definitely not right! It was a sign that Blaise's and his own magic had again meddled with his thoughts and emotions, had made him more pliable and amenable than he normally would have been. Merlin, this was worse than he had initially thought... this time he hadn't even noticed when exactly he had woken up, and he had spoken and acted during it all, had said things that were in his thoughts, somewhere deeply buried in his mind but which he would never have voiced out loud. And Blaise ... Blaise hadn't been aware that something was wrong or Harry would have felt it.
Lucius Malfoy stepped into his study and almost sneered in irritation at seeing the head of a young wizard in the fireplace. An unremarkable man with straggly, dirty-blond hair and a nervous flicker in his eyes that showed how uncomfortable he was in the presence of the former Death Eater in front of him.
Harry hesitated, he was already in a minority here with the two Slytherins and he really didn't need another one to put pressure on him or trying to influence him. But right now the three of them had come to an unspoken armistice after Blaise and Draco had promised Harry a meeting with his friends; it was awkward and fragile, but it was there nonetheless and Harry thought that at least the other two teenagers wouldn't do something to really endanger it. If this Ives was here to try and win influence over him, then Harry would be prepared. This was a game two could play after all and if a little bit of acting would enable him to get more information and with it a more equal standing in this mess, then he was all in favour for it.
"It helped me!" The blond objected in that tone of voice someone would use when bringing forth the ultimate argument to end a discussion.
Draco took a step towards him and tilted his head. Was that one of the reasons why Harry felt so reluctant to accept his inheritance? Was he …
Harry Potter was not a name that held much importance in Italy, a country where 'dark' was not necessarily 'evil'. A country where your bloodline was worth more than your money.
With a noticeable straightening of his posture, the Zabini heir then turned to the mirror. "Granger, Weasley."
And right now, with all these changes, all these problems piling up in front of him to mountainous dimensions, Lanai Manor was proving to be a better and more comfortable environment than anything he could have imagined. It was virtually dreamlike after living in a battle-scarred England, a reprieve for his mind that did him much good, he couldn't deny that, especially now, with the knowledge that he would be able to leave in time for the next term in Hogwarts easing his mind.
Mrs Zabini had given him the idea, if he remembered correctly, barely three months into his new career on the night of the 31st of October to the 1st of November.
Carefully he rubbed at his watering eyes but whatever it was, was gone now, probably washed away by the tear fluid. After a few moments he blinked the wetness away, glad that the irritation of his eye receded quickly.
"There was never a reason to do that, seeing as you managed to spoil him enough for a whole league of godfathers."
“They were right.” Severus continued with a certain satisfaction, letting her figure out by herself that the boy still lived. It was essential for her to understand what a dangerous game she was playing. Their lives would be forfeited, whether Potter died under their watch or was forced into what amounted to servitude to their family.
But. They were stubborn and they were smart, inventive and resourceful. Most important of all though: they were persistent. Forced into a corner, they never gave up even if the odds were against them. When given a task so difficult and dangerous that no one sane could expect him to survive it, had Draco not still found a way to succeed? Had he ever allowed his failures to discourage him in his attempts to trump his childhood enemies, especially Harry Potter?
Narcissa wanted to say the words, dearly wanted to. But comfort offered so brashly could only be rejected by someone as prideful as the Black Widow.
They had to, because the wizarding world in England was changing, those of lesser blood and a notable disregard for the traditions that had made their society what it was today, were gaining power and the purebloods would need to adapt or be pushed from the stage to the stands.
"Wonderful." Nascimbeni carefully straightened his waistcoat, striving to regain the air of confidence and control that he liked to portray to the world. With a decisive nod and an authoritative look he turned to his secretary. "Call in a press conference for..." he took out his golden pocket watch, "... 8 o'clock. That should still be early enough to prevent any significant leakages and leaves us three hours to come up with a satisfactory story. Try to get in contact with my British colleague..."
"No, you didn't! And you didn't care, either. Harry, pureblood families are even more powerful here than they are in Britain and you are not exactly seen as a friend of pureblood values! You might have been killed and your mutilated carcass would have simply vanished with the use of the one or the other dark spell!"
realise that their sons were indeed still breathing and relatively well, Potter and he wouldn't stay undisturbed for long. Hence the traps.
It was a frightening sight, this embodiment of Harry’s magic, perhaps his subconsciousness. Not because of the hide that was so dark that it seemed to swallow all the light that fell onto it, dripping with the shadowy substance that had birthed it; and not because of the sharp steely antlers crowning its proud head, or the deadly coldness of its white glowing eyes. No, the sleek form of a hunting nundu or a raging dragon should logically have held more horror than a stag – a flight animal, delicate and graceful – even a nightmarish one like this.
It made Blaise's heart pound in his chest, in his throat. God, they hadn't had a row so severe since … since they had gone different ways in their sixth year. How could it have come to this? Blaise had thought the war behind them, had been, and still was, so sure that Draco and he belonged together and that there were no misgivings between them over what had happened in the past. Otherwise, he wouldn't have proposed. They had both been fools those past few years, but should that really be allowed to shape their whole future? "I didn't mean …"
, Harry should not have met other Vykélari until he was mated to the two dominants that had guided him through his transition or until he was at least secure in his newfound powers and knowledgeable enough to be able to protect himself. After Ives' interference it would come differently now: Adler's husband had made it so that he would become Harry's infallible friend and confidant while Blaise and he would never be able to reach that level of trustworthiness in the Gryffindor's eyes. Because they had not been the ones to give him back his treasured freedom. And as he was getting to know the more intricate patterns of the personality of the submissive who had once been his enemy, Draco was also starting to understand, that he could not possibly give him a more precious gift than the one Ives had given him.
Meanwhile Taide continued to write his letters on Harry's leg with bold, confident lines and curves and with each word, Harry's suspicion faded into disbelief and anxious excitement, his magic sharpening within him, calm and quiet like a predator that had found a new focus.
It was a study, as large and as elegant as the rest of the manor, with a high ceiling and wide windows, the walls covered with extensive bookshelves. In the centre there stood a large L-shaped desk made of a dark, rich wood with a slightly red hue and adorned with paler inlays and silver ornaments. A black, imposing office chair was behind it, providing such a huge contrast to the set of light chairs in its front that any guest seated there would have to feel disadvantaged to the study's owner.
"Don't be stupid!" Blaise drawled haughtily, cocking his head "Why would we torture you? And we did not kidnap you; we took you into … preventive custody."
But the other man in the alcove immediately caught Harry's attention. He was rather young, maybe a few years older than Harry himself, Bill Weasley's age perhaps, and he stood looming beside the elder woman's chair, stiff and unmoving like an intimidating statue. With them so close to each other, one simply couldn't ignore their striking resemblance, marking them out as close relatives, most likely mother and son. The same high, distinctive cheek bones adorned their faces, the same tightness in the jaw line, and narrow lips. Only her features seemed to be more finely chiselled as if she had been the model after which a sculptor had crafted his face in a hurry, leaving it with a sharp-edged roughness that had its own appeal.
Carefully Harry bent his fingers towards the heel of his hand until something sharp and thin like a needle touched his skin. Oh, god, Malfoy was right… he had claws!
And a second later the choice was taken from him anyway, a silencing charm hitting his very cheek, the flash of energy stinging like a slap to his face. Unprepared, Harry couldn't stop his left hand from jerking forward as someone cast an Accio at the portkey, alerting his captors to its whereabouts and moments later there were hands on his arm, holding him still while someone groped for the invisible band of silver around his wrist, finding it within seconds.
"Are you alright?" the Italian asked, taking a step towards the younger teen. "You look tired. We didn't wake you, did we?"
"Don't let us fall!" He ordered and hoped by Merlin Alfar would know what he meant, what he was to do.
All Lucius had found out was that a submissive would quickly grow fascinated with powerful, extravagant and complicated magic. One of his ancestors had actually written in his diary that he had wooed his just fledged husband with a 'dance of magic, a stream of passion, aggression, desire and devotion; the promise of wondrous and mysterious things; a delicate balance between obeying the symbolism and laws of magic and daring to go beyond them' - whatever that meant. Reading those lines, Lucius had to wonder if the presence of a submissive was somehow affecting a Vykélari's sense of reality. Surely no ancestor of his would have used such language if he was in his right mind…
Zabini reached over towards the blonde, a small gesture since they stood so close to each other, his hand brushing against the other's lower arm for but a moment. Harry could see Malfoy's lips tightening scarcely perceptibly before his expression relaxed, softened almost and he continued with a milder tone of voice.
And in a way, he did: Harry might choose his friends over his Slytherin suitors now but that didn't necessarily mean that he cherished them more, only that their lives were at stake and not Draco's and Blaise's and Draco had to hold onto that belief.
“They contacted the eldest Greengrass daughter after Potter was taken. She sent one of her house elves to me to make sure I'd immediately leave for Damask Tower.” Severus thought for a moment before adding ”I don't think anyone spoke to them afterwards.”
“Fine then!” Severus snarled. “Enlighten me! How, pray tell, do you expect the public to react when you tell them that their darling Harry Potter has fallen in love with his childhood rival and bully of seven years, a former Death Eater, and another boy he didn't even really know beforehand? All within less than a week?”
The sight was like breaking through the cracking ice sheet of a frozen lake, submerging into the painfully cold water and suddenly every thought of revenge was drowned along with Harry, the influence of his magic softening and dissolving until it was like the ominous, energetic potential in the air shortly before a thunder storm, leaving the young submissive behind to stare in speechless consternation at the havoc he had wreaked. And at that violently fluttering, eerily white cloth.
An uneasy snort escaped Harry's lips and he drew up his legs onto the chair. "I don't know, I feel pretty much pressured right now, by circumstances
"Don't bother denying it, Zabini." She whipped up a hand to halt whatever protests Blaise might throw at her, even though the dark skinned Italian was too staggered at that moment to come up with anything plausible, a sense of being trapped gripping his chest as if he were a wolf cut off from its pack and surrounded by forest fire.
Blaise whipped around to face the door, seeing just in time as Draco rushed in, his movements so agitated that he practically fell into the room rather than walked, and his erratic steps seemed more random than anything. It was a wonder he managed to stay upright.
With a sigh, Harry's shoulders slumped in resignation and he closed his eyes and reached out for the tap, turning off the warm water. He flinched at the sudden shock of the liquid ice pattering down on him, each drop feeling like the sharp pinch of a needle.
Which left another possibility: logic dictated that if Potter had had the time to act but hadn't done so, then he must have been unable to. And if it wasn't his mind that had been incapacitated, then it must have been his magic. Severus wasn't well-read in regards to Vykélari, but he would indeed be very astonished if dominants like Lucius hadn't found some way to gain the upper hand over the magically more powerful submissives. How else would they have successfully oppressed their other halves for centuries?
; and really, the boy couldn’t compare to Narcissa’s ruthless beauty and her cruel wit that he loved so much. He probably wouldn’t be able to suffer that saviour-complex all the time; and that might lead to a massacre. No, Narcissa was perfect for him, he thought, grazing her with his eyes.
Harry opened his mouth to scream, wordless, mindless, desperate, horrified screams full of agony but nothing came out and suddenly the world tilted and Harry fell, barely catching himself on all fours, scraping his knees and the balls of his hands. Only then did the pain register, searing and blinding and bright and he looked down his chest and stomach, not surprised to see the gleaming tip of a dagger protruding from his lower abdomen, smeared and dropping with crimson.
And when it took nothing more than a few inquiries, a few minor investigations, it would be grossly negligent to keep idle.
Harry looked around cautiously, ensuring that he was still unwatched and alone. Of course, it was always difficult to notice a House Elf who didn't want to be seen, but unless Zabini had told them to watch him, Harry was sure that they would be too polite not to announce themselves. After all, Zabini had ordered them to treat him like an honoured guest, like a Zabini. Afterwards, the Slytherin had dismissed his servants immediately, so Harry was relatively sure he would have heard it if his 'host' had given such orders.
His breath froze in the cold air around him, small fleeting clouds that were immediately blown away by the breeze ruffling through his hair. The visual proof of the temperature was a disillusioning contrast to the warming charms around his body.
He inched towards the wide windows through which sun flooded the room, careful to keep low and not let himself be seen from outside as he came to stand beside one of the windows, peeking out from behind the light, flowing curtains that hang to both sides of it.
It didn’t take long after the thought formed in his mind that he started to struggle in earnest. He couldn’t believe it: Malfoy had cursed him, kidnapped and tortured him and now he molested him? Was there no limit to that bastard’s depravity? And he had witnessed for him, for god’s sake!
It was frowned upon not to acknowledge a debt just as much as it was frowned upon not to accept it. Only purebloods still honoured that age-old tradition, however; a mud-blood or a half-blood would not be expected to do the same, even though purebloods did in the reverse cases; in the rare situations that they owed someone who was not from their circles.
He first had to fulfil the herculean task of convincing Draco that there was a necessity for a change. His sometimes all too stubborn lover who at that moment started to sneak his arms around his shoulders, pressing his chest to Blaise's back and pulling him out of his musings.
Determined, Harry reached out into the direction where he had heard Blaise’s voice coming from, feeling for him. His wrist was grasped though, before he had encountered anything but thin air.
Hermione emitted a strange mixture between a sob and a laugh, looking as if she wanted to smack him.
"To be honest I think that they will be relatively safe from other dominant Vykélari for the moment, since the article brought so much attention to the situation and after the war you have the public's sympathy and admiration: threatening anyone close to you will be difficult to conceal and thus, any British dominant trying to attain you as a mate using that tactic will have to brave the public's chagrin. And most foreign Vykélari will need a day or two at best to react to the article and then get the necessary information on your weaknesses, your friends. But..."
More clearly than he cared to, Harry remembered how he had scratched himself with those and how … how Malfoy had touched him.
With another deep sigh, Severus turned his attention back to the lady Malfoy. She stood with her profile to him. Illuminated by a halo of white golden sunlight she looked like a cemetery angel, strong and beautiful even in her pain.
"I suppose." Daphne gave him a tight, humourless smile. "After all a dominant Vykélari wouldn't have revealed his and his chosen submissive's location for some bagatelle." And she waved towards the pair of two-way mirrors between them that was a clear indication of their respective whereabouts, as if there was no deeper meaning to that seemingly careless remark.
It was because he hadn't been helpless and because he had prevailed over his enemies, Hermione had said with a shrug of her shoulders as if it was totally normal and understandable that he was not traumatized by what he had been through while so many around them fought to keep the memories from ruling their behaviour and their life. Hermione always had an answer.
. Why was it his fault now? If they didn’t want to hear him out, why did they bring it up in the first place?
was the one to vanquish the Dark Lord; it was her sacrifice that did it, no action of Potter's. But for what? For a small brat of that git…" Severus shook his head a little bit in disgust.
So, his uncles, aunts and cousins had stayed in contact with him only because he was family, whatever crimes they believed his mother to be guilty of, and because they saw it as their duty to look after their family member's initiation into the Vykélari society as a young dominant.
Never mind that Harry was sweet and considerate and fair and that it felt good to be in contact with someone who didn't play mind games all the time - well, never, to be exact. Never mind that he had found enjoyable now what he had despised in Hogwarts from a distance: oh, Draco had loathed it when that willingness to help, all that zeal and intense attention was focused on all those dumb trolls that were so much like black holes: ever sucking everything up without it having any effect at all aside from bereaving other, more deserving people of what they took so carelessly. But Merlin, it felt good when that very intensity was directed at him and Blaise.
Disappointment drenched Harry like cold rain and again he turned away from the other. Somehow he had expected better of Ives after what he had heard earlier. The submissive seemed so confident and down-to-earth; not at all like someone who was susceptible to bribery.
Draco smirked obviously unfazed and grasped the sullen, younger Gryffindor’s hand in his, leading him to the open part of the platform where Blaise soon joined them to help position Harry’s elbows, hands, and general stance.
An ice-cold barbwire seemed to curl around and into his intestines at that thought and slowly he became aware of just how much they had screwed up so far.
“If you try to force Potter to bow to you, it is much more likely that he will sacrifice his own life. Dumbledore raised him to be a sacrifice, Narcissa, he will readily play the role of one if he thinks it is the right path.”
Only half an hour later the Weasley family left, shocked to the core: Harry was a Vykélari, a submissive Vykélari.
How unfathomable, how grotesque that they – the scions and sole heirs of two of the proudest bloodlines in all of Britain, who belonged to the best of their year at Hogwarts, who had received the gift of the Vykélari inheritance and thus had proof of their magical prowess – should be less worthy of a young wizard's friendship and affection, than a mudblood and a blood-traitor.
Unswervingly he continued to enwrap Harry in seemingly meaningless conversation that made his thoughts spin and his mind run in circles, trying to work out what undoubtedly important and incriminating information Harry must be revealing with his words. The fact that the younger submissive was giving him not much more than one syllable answers didn’t seemed to bother Adler at all.
Instead Blaise was sucked along the magical tunnel with no means to influence the journey, his muscles tensing under the strain and his hands clenching around spindly, greyish fingers, holding on, because there was nothing else to do.
As Malfoy turned around to face him with an almost curious expression while he continued to walk backwards, Harry knew he couldn't back down anymore.
"And I am" Harry answered, biting his lips. "Doesn't mean that I'll be trusting you blindly. Just that I won't outright refuse your proposals and … and advances." He said, his cheeks flushing faintly while he stubbornly encountered their assessing gazes.
into Zabini's chest. It was impossible to say what the man thought, with those black eyes and that cruel looking beak, but he seemed entirely too calm and unperturbed for someone who had just had an aggressive bird of dark magic melt into their body.
… Only one treasure he held onto and pulled closer to himself: the vague, somewhat guilty mirth that had unravelled in his chest during the story telling, the little sparkle that had lit his insides at the realisation that they could overcome their past together. Especially since this relief hadn't been in his chest, but Harry's. And Harry's joy that he now remembered.
Large eyes flashed with pleasure as the relatively tall Elf bowed to him so deeply his trembling ears swept over the somewhat dusty tiles. Silently Alfar raised himself to his full height again before gathering his fellow servants with his usual efficiency and within moments, Draco was left alone in the store hall, the silence enveloping him like a cocoon in which his own breathing and the rustling of his clothes with each movement echoed ominously.
Before he could answer, Ives interjected. "I'd like to speak alone with Mr Potter, Draco. And later today there won't be much time. Besides I think Adler intended to speak with the two of you, so you might as well leave the concerns of the submissives to the submissives."
Draco reacted quicker. With an incredible swiftness he was past the Elf and almost at the door already, summoning his recently discarded robe in midstride and calling out harshly "Where, Elf?"
That was unacceptable! Ginny stepped forward, intending to give the Elf a piece of her mind and force it to get her master if necessary, but she was interrupted by a soft female voice that came from behind the Elf.
"If he is akin to my Ives in any way at all, your so called submissive will rather die than leave himself in your hands just because you want him to. You were enemies, if I did not misunderstand the situation?"
But the longer the silent moment between them lasted, the less amused and the more fidgety Harry became, until Draco nudged his shoulder and said teasingly. "The proper thing to say would be 'thank you'."
He couldn't be haughty, couldn't present his opponent with a superior, aloof front, or else Daphne might just outright deny them her help entirely or even close the connection on him before he had a chance at voicing his request. She was a very proud woman and disliked being looked down upon just as much as she disliked people grovelling in front of her.
