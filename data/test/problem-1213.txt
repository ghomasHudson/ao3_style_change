'It's … I've never done this before,' he said softly, almost shyly. 'I - I don't want it to be a lie.'
Harry stopped dead as they entered the doorway at the end of the stairwell. Everywhere he looked, he could see bones. Skulls, spines, rib cages. Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands, were stacked, or hanging, all over the interior of the room.
He'd worn his cloak out of the house the night James had been killed. He'd forgotten, he'd forgotten until now that he'd worn it that night.
It was Malfoy, he realised, his eyes opening with a silent gasp. Malfoy was - was pleasuring himself.
, a voice inside him whispered. Draco shook it off. He couldn't do his job unless he was focused completely on creating the experience that the person in front of him needed in order to confront whatever was challenging them and move on.
Just the thought of another wolf touching what is his has him snarling savagely, looking around into the darkness.
Malfoy wore a sharp-looking dark grey three-piece suit that looked like it was more expensive than Harry's whole wardrobe. The jacket was unbuttoned and his waistcoat hugged his body, emphasising his slim waist and flat stomach. Harry suddenly understood what people meant when they said the colour of a shirt set off someone's eyes. The light blue of his shirt made his eyes shine, even from this distance, as he glanced up to meet Harry's regard.
'Food will be brought for you.' Mac began to leave, but then turned back. 'Welcome to New York, Catalyst,' she said, with a brief incline of her head, face still cold. 'Let's see that we make the right change, this time.'
He pushed the covers back and rolled out of bed, glancing down at the floor before deciding it wasn't worth his head to reach down for the discarded t-shirt to slip over his singlet. At least he'd managed to put his pyjama pants on before he'd crashed the night before. He reached for his glasses and moved slowly over to the en suite, opening the cupboards and grimacing when he didn’t see the familiar blue bottle. He caught sight of himself in the mirror and winced at his hair. It had escaped its usual loose top knot and looked more like a bird's nest, tangled and snarled. He needed a shave too. But all of that could wait. He headed downstairs instead, hoping that Ginny had some of the potion stashed.
Harry seemed to hunch in on himself further, the frantic whispers increasing until Draco could almost make them out. What he could hear turned him sick with fear. What the fuck had he done?
He pulled the drawer of his bedside table out and saw a note addressed to himself, in his own hand again. It directed him to remove the disillusionment charm from the wall and add the information he'd gathered that day to the case he was compiling against Malfoy.
Malfoy scowled and Harry couldn't help the slightly confused grin that spread across his face in return. Suddenly the thought of being in forced proximity to Malfoy for the day wasn't the worst thing in the world.
He hears Malfoy's soft huff of derision as he comes out into the main room wearing it, but he ignores it, slumping down onto the couch with a sigh. He flicks on the television and spends most of the rest of the day ignoring Malfoy as he watches it and dozes intermittently.
He ripped his eyes away from Harry's neck and forced himself to continue speaking. He couldn't bear to see Harry in pain, so he offered the only thing he could. He knew if he was a better person, he would make it a clean break, turn Harry away and end this. But Harry's need was in every line of his body, and Draco's couldn't help but respond.
he won't be able to control his needs. He knows, deep down, there is a part of him that wants Draco in that form, wants him in all ways. It fills him with shame and there's not a chance he's going to let Draco put himself at risk like that.
'So, two days ago we busted a big shipment of rare creatures being exported from the UK. Whole range of things. Most are being processed and returned home, but...'
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, hunching his shoulders as he looked up at Ron. The sensation made him think of Malfoy towering over him the night before - Malfoy outsmarting him. Malfoy inside his mind taking whatever he wanted.
'I've been a part of that life for about ten years now,' Draco said, leaning forward. It was important that he try to make them see. 'Since not long after school. It's not about hurting people,' he said, hoping they might be able to understand. It was a concept many people who didn't feel the need for that sort of experience often couldn't comprehend. 'Pain might be a part of what happens - not always - but the core of the experience is to allow people the freedom to be whoever they want to be - to explore their desires in a safe space, to take control or give control in whatever way they need.'
He looked again at Malfoy, knowing that with what he'd seen Harry do, what he had in his head, he could already blow the whole thing wide open. He wondered if maybe showing a little trust might get him further than not. He didn't talk about it because he didn't want people idolising him more than they already did … but then he remembered how Malfoy had reacted to his accidental time slip … and he remembered the way Malfoy was all through school. He didn’t think there was anyone less likely to be overawed by him than Draco Malfoy … and he liked that, he realised.
Harry does as he's told, hoisting his rucksack over his shoulder and wincing at the flare of pain it sends down his back. The area where he's been stabbed feels hot, like it's already inflamed, which he knows is impossible. It's barely been ten minutes. He tells himself not to worry about it. It will heal. Everything else has.
Then, shoulders stiff with discomfort, he made his way back to the Wizarding entrance. He was stopped at the doorway by a figure that materialised out of the shadows. Harry was abruptly glad he'd moved away to change his cloak.
'So basically,' Harry concluded. 'The Australians are the only ones of the lot of them with a lick of sense. And even their proposal is too weak. It's just things we should already be doing.'
'Are you sure?' Draco asks, and his scent strengthens suddenly, arousal thick in the air. Harry can't stop himself from breathing it in as Draco's stance changes, going soft and submissive against him. 'I can be very persuasive,' Draco whispers as he drops a hand behind himself to cup Harry's rapidly hardening cock.
'Harry, love, you're safe here. I promise. There is no one to hurt you. You're safe, love. Open your eyes for me.
cast a shield around it, after he'd somehow managed to pull time back for a few seconds so he could react quickly enough to do it.
Harry shuddered, the memories so vivid again, after all these years. Vernon was a towering presence in them; Harry always felt so small and helpless in these early memories. It was stupid when he thought of it now - there was nothing his uncle could do to touch him. But in his memories, he didn't have a wand or a way out. He was just small and afraid and so desperate to make it all stop.
'I - it was my party, and, well, the days of me wanting to do away with the great Harry Potter are long past. I just came to see whether you were alright, is all,' he finished, glancing back up at Harry almost defiantly.
'It's simple,' Malfoy says, regarding him with the same look of challenge in his eyes that Harry knew he'd been wearing the day before. Something in Harry wants to rise to it, despite knowing the impulse to do so immediately is dangerous.
Draco's hand hovered over Harry's cock, so close that he could feel the heat of it. His whole focus narrowed to that almost-touch. Then Draco looked into Harry's eyes and Harry forced his attention away from his cock.
It was dark when Molly disappeared back inside the house. Harry knew she'd gone to get his cake, and he followed her inside. She'd been running around all day making sure things were just right and he hadn't had a second to talk to her.
Harry returns his attention to the file. Darius Markwell is thirty-six, most recently from France, and is looking for personal protection for approximately five weeks while he conducts business in London.
that you are bullying my cousin, or any other student because of their creature heritage, I will have you pulled from Hogwarts so fast your nose will bleed.'
Malfoy took a step to the side and opened the door, showing Harry out into the bar. Harry took one more look around the room, wondering for a second what was happening inside the heads of the men and women lying there, then he stepped outside and into the bar, the smoke abruptly clearing.
Harry gritted his teeth, wishing he could direct the next attack their way, then immediately regretting that thought. No one deserved to have this sort of violence visited upon them.
Harry stared at the space Draco had Apparated from, his mind reeling from what he had just been told. Draco had no one - not one single person in his life. Draco
Harry began to move through the house more quickly. He had a job to do—figure out the connection between Malfoy and everything that was going on. That was all. He looked into Malfoy's study, but everything inside it had clearly been taken by the Aurors long ago. He sent his diagnostic charms running through the room but they returned no results. The library looked to have been cleared out too. Harry felt like a ghost as he wandered the halls, invisible and alone.
'Hi,' Harry says awkwardly, approaching the table. He'd thought a lot, while he'd been wrapped up in bed, about what Malfoy had said, about the truth woven into some of his points. He'd wrestled back and forth, trying to reconcile someone who passionately advocated for werewolf rights—had lowered himself to be with a wolf—with the prejudiced, arrogant boy he'd gone to school with. He'd tried to take what had happened to Teddy out of the picture; tried to be objective. He couldn't. It hurt too much. Still, after all these years.
Harry felt like he was floating in darkness, aware, yet … unaware. He had no idea where he was, but somehow he didn't feel concerned. He felt safe, comforted, as though someone was watching over him.
He was about to make himself more vulnerable than he ever had before. The idea of doing so made every instinct he had scream out in protest. Part of him worried what Harry would do with the knowledge Draco was about to provide to him. It was this thought that decided him. Harry had unknowingly given Draco so many of his deepest, darkest secrets. Doing this … it would just even the playing field. It would - hopefully - show Harry that Draco trusted him, and wanted Harry to know him as deeply in turn.
in years … not since right after you vanquished He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. And no one here would say that wasn't a noble and dangerous feat … but we can't afford to live in the past, can we? This is a new age - we are seeing unprecedented peace and prosperity in the magical community the world over. We can't go chasing after dark wizards under the bed, when our resources would be better spent elsewhere.'
'Malfoy,' Harry interrupted, hard green eyes seeming to look right through him. 'Cut the shit. Why are
With that, Rothwell leaves the stage and a sombrely clad man steps up, a pedestal floating behind him. It settles beside him and he gestures at it. A thick, leather-bound book appears on it, and Harry can feel the evil emanating from it from where they stand in the middle of the room. The thing smells of death and the bidding begins almost immediately.
Luna's face was unreadable in response to his words and Harry fought the urge to fidget under her gaze. She wouldn't turn him away. She couldn't. It was clear she knew much more than he did about what was going on in the world, and he needed what she knew. Despite his reservations, he knew he'd take the knowledge from her, if he had to.
He licks his way up Draco's cock with broad, wet strokes as Draco groans above him, a guttural sound. Draco's hands are back in his hair and he's pulling as he grinds himself against Harry's face in short little thrusts. Harry rumbles his approval as he rubs his face against Draco's cock, smearing pre-come on himself before sucking Draco down, taking him as deep as he can.
Harry turns his attention to Jonathan as he gets to work. His hands are cool and smooth as he directs Harry's limbs where he needs them so his tape can do its job. A Quick-Quotes Quill hovers in the air behind him, scribbling down measurements as Jonathan murmurs them under his breath.
'Fucking hell,' Harry murmurs, as he reads. He feels tears prick at the corners of his eyes, to see his own life unspooled before him in the stories of others. He feels laid bare with it, but also protected, held and comforted. 'You've done it.'
'I was an Auror for five years,' he continues, hand still stretched out in front of him. Malfoy's eyes haven't left it. 'And a Senior Auror for nine. I've been assigned to be your personal protection.'
Harry nodded and as the doors began to spin he watched her. Hermione waved her wand through the air, and a sideways figure eight glowed in the air for a moment before sweeping across the room to attach itself to one of the doors.
'I'll transfigure the table,' he says, standing up and gathering his notes to himself, shrinking them down.
But then Bill pulls back and frowns slightly. 'You smell like something strange,' he says. 'Something dangerous. Is everything okay?'
'I wanted this mission and that was the only way you would agree to it,' Harry says. Malfoy frowns but seems to trust the truth of Harry's words. He throws the bracelet in his palm to Harry, who snatches it out of the air with ease. Malfoy watches his movement in a way that's just a little too observant.
But Potter wouldn't speak of it. He shied away from it every time Draco tried to coax him closer. And he watched Draco. Watched Charlie, really, but his eyes were intense and Draco liked the way they felt on him. It had been a very long time since he'd felt seen by Potter.
'Why not?' Malfoy says, and there's such casual, unshakable confidence in those words that Harry can't help but hear the truth of them. Connections start to form in his mind, things falling into place the same way they had when he was an Auror.
Abruptly Harry realised how dark a place he'd been in when he'd decided to kill the First—Eliška, he reminded himself, her name had been Eliška—and let the Horseman free. He'd walked right into their trap, like the blind idiot he was.
Harry nodded, relieved, and forced his eyes open again. Hermione was watching him, the look on her face concerned but also knowing.
He pictured again, the thing that had erupted into life when he'd killed the woman. He could still feel its eyes burning into him, cold and full of mockery. He'd fucked up. He had no idea what he'd done, but he knew he'd fucked up. Big time.
Harry looked down over the other papers spread out on the desk before him. That was the issue. Samael Ladon, owner of
The figure on the horse wore armour that was viciously spiked. It was a dark, smoky black that was dented from combat. It wore a helmet that covered its eyes and left its mouth clear. Long pale hair whipped in the non-existent wind. Strapped to its back was a deadly-looking greatsword, the type that could cut a man in half.
A delicious smell filled the air and Harry breathed it in appreciatively, following his nose to the figure at the stovetop, humming the words to some obscure song as he tilted a board, sending a cascade of mushrooms, bacon and onion into the pan.
'Okay, fine, so I'm a little drunk. I - I didn't mean to. It's just tonight. With Lupin … and my parents …'
The moment they land, Harry rips Malfoy's wand from his hand and throws it across the room. He grabs Malfoy by the throat and slams him against the wall, fingers digging into the sensitive skin.
The gates are closed, and Harry follows Malfoy's lead as he brings them into the shadow of an oak, its branches spreading out over the path. The fence is an easy thing to climb, thick stone with handholds everywhere. Harry glances back down to see the incongruous sight of Malfoy glamoured as an overweight, middle-aged Muggle in tweed, climbing lithely up a wall as though he'd trained for it.
'It was a long time ago,' Draco said, his hands dropping to his belt in a clear signal that the conversation was over. Harry's eyes dropped with them and Draco smirked at the response.
Harry finished up, brewed the tea and went upstairs to find Draco. He was curled up on the end of the couch in front of the crackling fire, a book open in front of him. The sitting room had always been Harry's favourite, ever since his first visit to Draco's house six years earlier. He liked the whole house. It was light and airy and he had felt at home the very first time he walked in, but there was something about the sitting room that just spoke of warmth and comfort and home.
Harry landed on the front step of Grimmauld Place and stood, panting, heat still rocking through him, mixed with guilt and confusion. He looked at his front door and panicked. Was Ginny home? He couldn't remember where she was. He'd kissed someone else. Fuck. He couldn't see Ginny right now. Harry closed his eyes and fixed on the first destination that came to mind, then he whirled into the night with a crack.
Then there's everything Malfoy had told him; his treatment at the hands of Aurors Harry had worked alongside, had considered his friends—good guys. Was it little wonder Malfoy had done what he'd done? Had he really been given any choice?
He'd been close to giving up … until he'd seen Harry from across the Ministry's Atrium floor as he made his way out the door. Harry had looked … wound up, as though he was wrapped around himself with layers of misery and anger and pain. He'd looked the way he had when he'd first walked into Release all those months ago - as though he had no idea where he was in life and where he should be. He'd looked as though he was shouldering all the burdens of the world single-handedly, and that that was his lot in life.
The Harry duck scrambled up the bank first, almost reaching the top before another came up behind him, jostling him. He tumbled backwards into the water, flapping his wings and spraying droplets everywhere.
He presses a palm against the wall and stills his hand, moving his hips instead, fucking into his fist, imagining a willing arse in front of him, bent over, presenting to him.
'And you won't see Davies?' Harry asks, unable to help himself. He turns around to face Malfoy, knowing he's pushing it after everything Malfoy's just said to him. But this, this is not negotiable. As much as everything in him is screaming that he needs to get out, to get away, to go to his pack and lick his wounds and weather out the moon, he can't leave knowing that Davies will be around Malfoy in his absence. He just can't.
Malfoy seemed to decide on something. He crossed his arms across his chest. 'I have no idea Potter. It was probably just lonely and wanted someone who felt the same.'
Harry waved his hand dismissively. 'I have too much of the stuff anyway. And they're always giving me more. Sounds like it would be better off in your hands.'
Harry recognises the cramped handwriting he'd gotten plenty of glimpses at over the past few weeks, but had been unable to make anything of.
Harry looked around at the five of them, feeling something hot and tender well up in his chest. All of a sudden he had a lump in his throat, and he was filled with the thought, branding itself across his mind,
'Turns out becoming an Animagus is bloody hard,' Draco says, with a laugh. 'I wanted to run with you, though.'
sitting on a side table, where Ginny had left it almost two months before. She'd liked to read to James, Harry remembered, but the memory felt old somehow. Faded.
and groans when he sees it's just gone six am. Malfoy is an early riser. Great. He contemplates lying in bed for longer, but the idea of being in bed while he can hear Malfoy moving around in the next room makes him feel uncomfortable, so he gets up, rummaging through his bag and pulling on joggers and a sleeveless top. It's pleasantly warm in the apartment, so he doesn't bother with socks. He stretches slowly, trying to work the stiffness out of his hip. It's always worse right when he wakes up.
. Merlin, but Harry thought he could go mad from the sounds alone. He shifted, needing to be closer. He wanted to climb into Draco's lap and press down against him. He needed more contact between them.
Harry blinked when he realised what it was. A collar. He felt a jolt of interest run through him, and Ladon seemed to catch it, running the leather through his hands, before pulling it tight with a snap, as he stepped in front of Harry.
'I'm here,' he said, mustering all of his Malfoy disdain and injecting it into his tone, 'Because I assured the Board that if anyone could get you to pull your oversized head out of your arse and see what help was being offered, it would be me.'
'You can come like this, can't you, Harry?' Draco said, not missing the way Harry shivered at his words, eyes closing for a moment as his movements slowed.
'Hunting us, apparently,' one man said with a snort as he lifted his drink to his mouth. 'We're to move in groups of two at all times, even to take a fucking piss.'
Ladon drew in a shaking breath and closed his eyes for the briefest second. When he opened them, they were full of heat.
to get even the slightest hint of it. He stepped back out into the darkness of the night, casting a discrete
Harry pushed himself up in bed as Ron walked past Draco and out of the room. He let the blankets drop to his waist and tried to ignore how weak his body still felt.
Draco knew that his twisted wreck of a body, sitting on the chair in his workshop, had just spent itself into his pants, but he couldn't bring himself to care.
Harry touched it all the time, without even realising it. Draco watched him, in their shared office, and tried to ignore the things he'd done to Harry while he was wearing Ladon's collar.
The thought occupied Harry's mind on and off during the day. He felt a growing sense of wistfulness as he watched Malfoy with his son. He'd long given up on the hope of having children of his own - but sometimes, when he was watching Ron with Hugo and Rose, or now, when he watched Malfoy showing his little boy the world, he felt the ache of that regret deep in his bones. Harry forced his mind away from those thoughts. What's done was done and there was no purpose in dragging his mind back over it now.
Ladon ran the agiel down Harry's arm and he felt a slice of pain. He waited for the hot welling of blood over his skin, but nothing came. He didn’t know if he was relieved or disappointed.
Harry steps behind him a pace and scans their surrounds. They're on an expansive estate, manicured lawns stretching out towards the manor at the end of a long gravel driveway. It's approaching dusk, but he has no trouble picking out the details in the low light. He can hear faint music from within the house.
Harry felt his anger flare to life again at her words, hotter than before. He'd known she would react this way. He'd
Shacklebolt linked his fingers on the table in front of him. 'Indeed. If I had progress to report, I would have already done so.' He looked at the two of them seriously for a moment. 'Between these four walls, we're not sure how to fix the weather. Investigations into the source of the problem have uncovered that our former PRAT -' at this Harry let out a disbelieving snort.
Harry realised Javier thought he was only bothering to try and work with him to get the proposal pulled.
They both moaned at the same time. Harry at the unexpected pleasure and Draco at the fact that he was finally tasting Harry - finally feeling him in his mouth.
'You must have misunderstood me when I told you to get out,' he said. 'What I meant was, I have absolutely no interest in hearing any proposal that a bunch of blood supremacists who supported a genocidal maniac have to offer.'
He walked until he was covered in blood, until its sticky coldness coated every part of him, and then he saw them.
He looked in the mirror and concentrated. He watched as the black bled from his hair like ink washing down a drain. He watched as the faint blush of colour faded from his skin and his features narrowed. He watched as his eyes shone icy blue for a moment longer before flashing to a mercurial gray.
Malfoy considers him for a long moment and Harry wonders whether Malfoy has ever worked on a story with someone else. He thinks of the visits he's been observing over the past few weeks and wonders what sort of role those people played in the various stories he now assumes Malfoy has been working through with them. He wonders if they were suspects or confidantes.
He feels a trickle of concern, for the first time, at the thought that Malfoy might tell someone what he does now, and then he'd have the papers breathing down his neck here too, ruining any chance he has to get out of his house, out of his own head. He forces himself to take a breath. He can manage this. He knows he can. He's hunting Malfoy, not the other way around.
He knows what he looks like, when he turns, knows the monster he becomes. They'd told him—the two Ministry-sanctioned Healers who had managed his case after the incident—after the bite. Back when there had been a possibility he would still be okay.
Then Draco sat up slightly as Scorpius walked around the corner, climbing up to settle himself between them comfortably.
Damn but it was hot. Harry pulled his t-shirt off as well, leaving a sleeveless black undershirt that clung to his chest. Pheo uncurled from his neck and slid down to wrap around his forearm.
'Some people are fated,' Conor said. 'To touch life or to touch death more closely. And some walk the line in the middle.'
'Explain,' he growls through gritted teeth, one small thread of the control he'd had as a human allowing him to pause for just a second. 'Now.'
Draco reaches inside his pocket for his wand and he holds it lightly as he starts to speak. 'I've had some very interesting conversations with Bill Weasley over the last few months,' he says and his tone is light.
Malfoy nodded, smoothing his hands down his robes, seeming to calm himself. 'I visited this morning. The Abbott twins are out. They were released yesterday. Little Josephine Bulstrode is still in until the end of the week, but she's expected to make a full recovery. Geraldine Shafiq is still in a critical condition. She took the brunt of the hit. It was right on her window, and she broke most of the bones in her right side, lost a lot of blood too.'
He wanted to Apparate to the club and hand the forms to Draco himself. To ask him to take what he wanted. But then he thought of his discussions with Jayne, thought about all the times he'd rushed into things, thought about the lessons Ladon had taught him, about waiting. Instead he tied the forms back to the owl's leg, adding a scribbled note.
He glares at Malfoy, who has one finger rubbing idly up the stem of his wine glass as he considers Harry, eyes sharp.
The team leader ignored his words, nodding at the man to her right, who left stepped forward, holstering his own wand to grab Draco's arm, shoving his shirtsleeve down to reveal the leather straps, and underneath them the faded skull, with the snake twining its way out.
Draco felt heat roar through him. He groaned and leaned down, capturing Harry's mouth in a kiss that tasted of the both of them.
The words filtered through his consciousness slowly. He didn't even know if Harry was aware he was saying them.
He dropped Scorpius off at the dinner table, giving Estelle a kiss on the cheek and a murmured thank you. He knew Pansy's parents loved looking after Scorpius while he was at the club, or attending Society events, so far as they knew. However, at this point he felt like his son basically had a second home here, and he always had a niggling worry in the back of his mind that one day they would overstay their welcome.
Draco forced a smile in return. Damned inheritance. Damned social standing. Damn the fact that he couldn't achieve what he needed to without the Malfoy name behind him.
It's two days before the full moon when Davies finally agrees to meet. Harry spends the time watching; asking innocent questions that Malfoy always manages to twist back on him; working small, friendly gestures into their interactions with each other. Harry doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference yet. Malfoy is still acting like the same rude, arrogant twat, but it's something to do while they wait.
As he thought it, Ladon pushed against his hole, humming his own pleasure as his tongue breached Harry.
'Strange. I think he's written me off, but the way he looks at Scorpius sometimes …' Draco shivered slightly, a haunted look coming into his eyes. 'He treats him like …  like Scorpius is this tiny version of himself to be moulded and shaped into what he needs. It's the same way he used to treat me, when I was a boy, before the whole world went to hell. It's not normal.'
Mid-afternoon, he found his feet taking him towards the debrief room. It was empty and Harry made his way slowly to the case board, spelling it with a flick of his wand to show Malfoy's case.
The next room they entered was a bedroom and Harry paused in the doorway, as he recognised it and a thought hit him.
'Dinner's ready,' Molly calls from the kitchen, and Harry sends up a silent thanks for the reprieve. He gives Hermione's leg a squeeze before he stands, reaching down for Rose and pulling her onto his shoulders again. She giggles at the way he almost needs to bend in half to get through the doorway without smacking her head on it. When he sits down at the table, he leaves Rose on his shoulders, and she giggles harder as everyone pretends to look for her.
Hermione nodded. 'Yes, but that's not surprising. Level nine is cut off from most of the main Ministry support systems. Too many things that are too delicate for the likes of this to be happening,' she said, waving her hand at the rain with a sniff.
'I couldn't do nothing,' he says, after a long moment, looking out the window as he watches the streets go by.
It opened with a soundless glide and he blinked at the sight that met his eyes. Inside was a foyer, lit by softly glowing lamps. He could hear music. Something instrumental. Flowing and gentle, yet somehow putting him on edge as well. That same, fizzing restlessness shivered across his senses. His eye was caught by a booth near a set of large, ornately carved doors. Inside was a dark-haired woman who looked across at him with interest. He hesitated slightly and she smiled. It wasn't a friendly smile, but Harry felt drawn to it. He stepped closer, noting her fitted black dress and the red nail polish that matched her lipstick.
As if to verify his words, a particularly strong gust of wind hit Harry from behind, pushing him forward a step, so that he came within touching distance of Malfoy again. He tried to ignore the way Malfoy's gaze flicked quickly over him, wondering why he hadn't seemed as surprised by their chance meeting.
'Do you need me to cast for you?' Harry asks, injecting innocent curiosity into his voice. He wants Malfoy to look at him again.
The flickering stream of images and sounds slowed in its frantic pace, and that was somehow worse. Harry could make out details now, see scenes replaying around him. But it was more than just watching them, he realised with a shock. It was different to a Pensieve. He was
Ginny was home again when he got back a few days later, after dealing with a collection of cursed clothing. Evidently a young woman had inherited her grandmother's estate. No one had told her that her grandfather had a chauvinistic, jealous streak. The nightdress she'd worn while fucking her boyfriend had strangled her to death, mid act.
Harry cast a discreet Muffliato around them, then looked at Ron, who rolled his eyes in exasperation at the two of them.
It only takes him a minute to get properly dressed and he spends the rest of his allotted time inspecting Malfoy's wards (which are strong) and adding additional protections of his own (nasty things, for the most part). By the time he's done, the apartment is Unplottable and fully masked with Silencing and Privacy Charms so strong a
He put an arm around his middle, pressing against the bare skin of his stomach as he breathed in, imagining the soapy smell of James' hair after he'd had a bath. For a second he could almost feel the weight of his baby in his arms again, feel the clumsy touches of James' fingers against his skin as he poked the tattooed images weaving their way up and down Harry's arms and across his chest. The ghost of that touch and the moment of flaring, heart-stopping relief brought him back to his senses.
Draco leaned in close, murmuring in Harry's ear. 'I'm pretty sure I can convince the Head Auror to let me off with a warning,' he said, voice low as his lip grazed Harry's ear. Harry huffed out a breath, heat suddenly curling through him. He felt his magic rush through him, surging to the surface as though it wanted to join with Draco's and make them both feel good. He wrestled it back down.
Finally, he strengthens Malfoy's anti-Apparition wards, adding a twist keyed to both of their magical signatures so that they don't have to be dropped to let the two of them in and out.
He returned to the stand, still not looking at Harry. Harry felt his heart clench to watch him, and Sue leaned over to whisper, 'Relax, don't let them see you're rattled too. You don't want that lawyer making the connection between you two.'
Three of the Aurors walked out of the room without looking back at him, but the team leader remained stationed at the door, watching him as it closed behind her people.
'Eladora Blane.' He remembered the seasoned Auror. One of his mentors. He remembered his mistake in reassigning her partner.
The Gillyweed took the edge off just enough for Harry to ask, 'How long have you been doing this, anyway?'
He tries not to think about what will happen if Malfoy needs him during the time that the potion lays him out, during the time where he can do nothing but writhe and cry with the pain of an aborted shift.
Harry gave him the finger and turned his attention to the evidence boxes. He blanched when he realised it was photos again. Two envelopes worth.
Harry said nothing, motioning grimly out the door. Malfoy's grey eyes looked into his a moment longer, as though searching for something. Harry didn't know what that look meant - why Malfoy should be looking at him with such intensity - as though he was seeking something that he couldn't find. After a moment longer, Malfoy's his face smoothed and he nodded, turning and stepping out of  the door. Harry glared after his retreating form before he stalked back to his desk, slashing his hand savagely so that the office door slammed behind him with a crack that echoed through the Department.
In a second his ankles were bound by smooth black cords, his legs wide and fastened to the bed posts. He cast a second rope at his knees, looping under the bed. Then he pulled against the ties, trying to close his legs, and groaned at the feeling of restriction, of being fully on display, and of wanting it.
He found himself focussing more and more on the presence, trying to remember how it looked, what it did, how it
'You haven't done anything wrong,' Draco repeated, willing Harry to believe him. 'It's fine. I've missed you, Harry. I want this just as much as you do.' He checked Harry's face as he spoke, trying to see if Harry was willing to fall back into the lie—if he would let himself forget that someone else sat underneath the façade of the husband he missed so badly. Harry's shoulders relaxed slightly, and Draco felt a glow of satisfaction. He had always been a good liar.
Malfoy didn't direct a single answer to Murphy, instead he had fixed with a strange intensity on the space where Harry stood and watched.
He looks at Malfoy, trying desperately to figure out what to say—what does Malfoy want him to say? How does Malfoy feel about
'I don't,' he responded. 'I think I'm in a much stronger position to support my team and the DMLE as a whole than I ever have been,' he said instead. He paused, considering something he'd been tossing around, and deciding to float it.
They exit the club and Harry expects Malfoy to order another taxi, but Malfoy just starts walking. Harry takes a deep breath of the air around him. It smells dirty, but it's better than the cloying scents that are stuck inside his throat at the moment. He runs through what he just observed, and what it could mean.
Malfoy cocks an eyebrow, pursing his lips. 'That's none of your business, Potter. Unless you have a warrant for my arrest?' His face makes it very clear he's aware Harry has no such thing.
Harry lost himself in the story, in bringing it to life from the page, doing all the voices the way Rose and Hugo loved. Scorpius chimed in occasionally and Harry could tell he'd read the story with his dad countless times. The thought made him warm, that Scorpius was clearly growing up well loved with a father who spent time with him.
He woke to the smell. The sharp, over-clean smell of the hospital. Harry groaned, forcing his eyes open and struggling to sit up before his consciousness had even caught up with him.
'As pleasant as this is,' Draco says, interrupting the spiralling panic of Harry's thoughts. 'Might we join the party? I would so hate to miss the main event.'
He picked up lamb shanks on his way home, putting them straight under the pressure spell and getting the rest of the ingredients in with them in record time. Then he went upstairs to shower and change. He came back down, nervous, moving around, tidying things up. Ginny walked in close to seven and sniffed appreciatively.
He drew the layout of the room and tried to recall how many people had been in it, both before and after he awoke. Then he made a list: gender, rough age, defining characteristics. He didn’t think he'd recognised anyone, but he couldn't be sure.
He had a flash of memory. The cupboard by the sink - the dark, cramped space … the way the lock sounded as the bolt slid home.
Harry swallowed the Polyjuice, closing his eyes and breathing slowly to avoid retching the lot of it back up. He tried to focus on something else - anything to avoid thinking about the way his bones twisted and lengthened, the way his features melted and blurred. Fuck, he hated Polyjuice.
Harry gave him a mock glare, which just made Draco laugh harder and after a few moments Harry couldn't do anything but stare at him. He didn't think he'd ever seen Draco so carefree - just so openly happy.
He was elbowed aside and Harry was looking into the bright green eyes and scarlet mouth of Rita Skeeter. '
Harry had gone home from that session, picked up his quill and gone straight to what was fast becoming his favorite letter-writing place in the garden, where the April sunlight was filtered through the leaves of the large oak that grew over half the yard.
He stood in front of his closet in just his underwear, wondering what to wear. It was a Muggle place, so he didn't have to worry about robes. And if Malfoy had had anything to do with it, it'd be flash as fuck. He settled on a pair of charcoal trousers and dress shoes, a deep green button-up shirt that Ginny had always told him set off his eyes, and the waistcoat that matched his trousers. He left the tie off, opening the neck, running his fingers over the thin band there, letting its presence sooth him in the strange way it did. Then he headed downstairs for his coat and to find out where the bloody hell the nearest Apparition point to Fenchurch Street was.
He crossed the room and picked the book up. He slipped the photo between the pages and then put it into his pouch as well before tying it onto his belt. He wondered what it said of him that he could pack his entire life up in less than ten minutes. He didn't think it was anything good. It probably also wasn't anything he didn't already know about himself.
Harry looked at the people next, getting exactly the same impression from them. They reminded him of those he sometimes worked for, who called him into their mansions to deal with their old heirlooms. The people in this room had that same sense of entitled arrogance. It was in everything from the way they dressed to the way they held themselves.
Malfoy spoke again, jolting Harry from his thoughts. He was looking directly into Andrews' eyes and the look on his face was calculating.
'I know where it is,' Harry interrupts, turning away before Malfoy's finished speaking. Even though Harry's decided he needs to do this job—can't let Malfoy disappear again—it doesn't mean the anger rushing through him will magically calm itself. He needs to get out. To run. To get away from the strangely familiar sounds and scents, and the memories that are weaving themselves back into his mind.
Draco let a small smile slip across his face. 'Indeed, Potter. Amazing, the way one's views about things can change.'
He can feel the moon in the sky above, its draw stronger now. He has to fight almost constantly against it when it's this close to full, and the fight is draining.
Harry huffed out a breath and rolled his eyes, settling back against him. Draco forced the prickling in the back of his eyes into submission. He was Charlie Weasley right now, and Charlie had nothing to cry about.
He came to an abrupt stop at the foot of the stairs, and this time he couldn't hold his vomit. He leaned to the side and squeezed his eyes shut as he retched his guts up.
He flew for another twenty minutes before he gave up on his westerly direction and cut to the south. He leaned harder and harder into the flight, forcing it to push him through the air faster and faster. The further he travelled, the more the clouds started to boil and swirl. Harry felt anticipation rise in him. He was headed the right way. He knew it. He tried to ignore the way the storm was growing even stronger the closer he got to its centre. Draco would be alright. He had to be. He distracted himself by trying to figure out where he was and what he would find when he dropped back through the clouds. He thought about how long and how fast he'd been flying for and the rough directions he'd travelled.
Draco and Pansy left without paying, he assumed Pansy had already made the necessary arrangements. That night was another restless night and in the morning Draco took a dose of the potion. It wasn’t as bad tasting as Polyjuice, but it was certainly up there. The healer had been right when she said Draco might experience some fatigue. He spent the entire day in bed. The fever and tremors and other physical aliments faded but Draco’s mind was racing. His brain fluttered from thought to thought unable to pin anything down. And he was bored so fucking bored. He wanted nothing more than a drink. A cool glass of scotch.
“But keep your eyes on the score. If they get a lead of one fifty or more, I want you to switch to interference and start running screens.”
Draco marched into the kitchen and pulled out a bottle of wine. He started to take a drink but stopped himself looking at the bottle in disgust before pouring the contents into the sink. Draco grabbed the rest of his alcohol and one by one washed them down the drain. He hunted through the apartment making sure to get every last one. Then he went into his apothecary and flushed the bottle of pills.
Thomas didn’t have any magic. That couldn’t be right. That wasn’t right. Thomas was sweet and brilliant and bright. “I thought you were pureblood?”
The night before, Draco was a bundle of nerves. His hands itched. He wanted a drink, badly. Instead, he wandered the hotel hallways until he found himself in front of Harry’s room.
Draco had spent his time studying out in the gardens. They reminded him of the gardens at Sancerre and the time he spent with his mother, plus it was quiet. That is, it was quiet most of the time, today Draco could hear strange noises coming from the other side of the hedges. He tried to ignore the sounds, but he couldn’t concentrate.
Draco shook his head. “You know, they say I am only here because Potter dropped out and they’re right.”
In the morning, he woke up to a splitting headache. He showered again, shedding off the sweat and nightmares that had accumulated through the night before joining Pansy downstairs for a cup of coffee. They got to work cleaning the rest of the house. Even using magic it would take a while.
Draco’s father continued to give him meaningless details, but Draco tuned him out and waited for his dismissal.
Days continued to get better. Draco did a lot of reading and started to go on runs. He had gotten pretty out of shape in the last couple of months and it would take a while to get back to where he had been. The cravings never went away. They would strike Draco at the strangest times but Draco found the best way to deal with them was with a good distraction, so Draco kept himself busy. Pansy even convinced him to join a support group.
The week after the tournament Draco received several letters. The first came during the evening meal and surprised Draco – outside of Pansy’s holiday letters, Draco didn’t receive much mail.
“Alright, ok, here’s what we’ll do then, you will continue staying with me for now, we’ll go through your things and figure out what we can get some money for that way you can get yourself some spending money, and then we’ll take some time to figure out what it is you want to do whether that’s go back to school or get a mastery or work as a clerk at Flourish and Blotts.” Pansy smiled. “There is no rush to figure it all out, Draco. We have time.”
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts about Harry when someone pulled up beside him on their broom, it was April, one of the chasers. “So what’s the story with you and Potter?”
Was Potter bloody insane? He just offered to help a rival seeker. Draco might have thought it was a trick except for the earnest look in Potter’s eyes. He could be faking it but Draco’s instincts told him he wasn’t, he was just that naive.
Draco wasn’t sure what to wear. He didn’t have money for a costume and he certainly couldn’t show up in his uniform or his social life would be dead for good. Draco spent an entire week coming up with ideas and dismissing each of them in turn. Inspiration struck him late one night as he was going to bed, and suddenly he knew exactly what to do.
“You’re absolutely mental. You know that.” He shook his head in disbelief. “I bet you were a total nerd in school. You are too competitive to settle for anything less than top of the class and too smart not to get it.”
“Oh thank Merlin,” Draco exclaimed as Harry turned to open the broom shed. “You know you could have just said so and done without all the theatrics.”
Mr Barker was a short, brown-haired man dressed in plain slacks and a cable knit cardigan, a no-nonsense sort of man. The ride to the school was practically silent which suited Draco just fine. As they approached the campus gates the reality of the situation washed over Draco. A large grey concrete wall surrounded the property and behind the rusty blue gate was a drab, institutional building. l'Internat Adolphe Favre was painted in miss-matched colours of pale pink, golden tan, and greyish beige. The trees looked dead in the cold winter air. It was a joyless space where the world seemed to be just a little more muted.
“Come on Malfoy.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Out of all the players here we both know you’re the best.”
Draco quoted his favourate passage, “В конце концов, было бы логично сдаться, и я бы сдался, если бы работал для кого-то, но в мире нет ни одного человека, который мог бы говорить на моем языке… (V kontse kontsov, bylo by logichno sdat'sya, i ya by sdalsya, yesli by rabotal dlya kogo-to, no v mire net ni odnogo cheloveka, kotoryy mog by govorit' na moyem yazyke…)”
After they returned home they celebrated the season together. Justin and his wife hosted the party at their house and Draco finally got to meet their kids. There was music and laughter and tacky paper decorations, and Draco couldn’t think of a better way to spend his time. Harrison led a wonderful toast dedicated to families, both found and made, which did not make Draco cry at all. The night was one of the best of Draco’s life and he spent it with Harry at his side.
Harry chased after him. “I’m sorry Draco I just couldn’t--” Harry stopped mid-sentence and Draco turned to look.
Draco melted under the attention but he managed to stop himself and push Harry away. “If we are going to do this, we are not going to do it on the cold hard floor. I assume you have a bed stashed around here somewhere.”
The tournament itself was amazing. Draco and the team got to take the flying carriage which was equipped with the best of the best. Once they arrived at the Slavic school, Draco enjoyed his notoriety even more. Throughout the season he had started to build a reputation for himself, and now all eyes were on him as he walked down the halls. Everyone spoke in hushed voices about the sixteen-year-old seeker who had never mounted a broom until just a few months ago. He felt like a celebrity.
Draco froze, she had no idea who he was. Why would she? It took a second before Draco composed himself enough to answer. “Our families were close when I was young. Though I haven’t seen him since I was a child.” It wasn’t even a lie, technically.
Draco cast a listening charm and tried to make out what they were saying. He was only six months into his Russian lessons but he was able to understand the gist of the conversation. They were talking about him, discussing his playing style and potential weaknesses. He supposed he should be flattered that he was worth discussing.
As the first-years settled into a routine and the social hierarchy solidified, it became clear that the largest determining factors in terms of popularity were magical ability and grades. Draco knew that if he wanted a place at the top he would have to work at it, and work at it, and work at it again. And so Draco did just that. As the months went by, he threw himself into his studies. He did all the extra readings, attended office hours, and practised his wand work for hours.
. Draco could feel those eyes following him across the pitch even if he couldn’t work up the nerve to look for himself.
Finwick studied Draco’s face for a moment. “No, I don’t suppose you are - I can’t imagine there is anyone who scares you.”
After several days of this Draco decided he’d had enough. He tracked Thomas down and confronted him.
In those last few seconds, Draco could see the play in his head. He knew exactly what he had to do to win. He also knew that it was impossible. Potter had more talent than him and though Draco knew how to win he didn’t have the skill to pull it off. Up against Potter, he wasn’t strong enough, fast enough, or reckless enough to come out on top.
Inside were a couple dozen glass cloches. Draco got to work setting them out for his classmates and soon after he finished the other students started to arrive.
And Xavier was eager to comply. Draco quickly lost whatever composure he had summoned and fell to putty under Xavier’s ministrations. He watched as Xavier took his own length in hand getting them both off at the same time.
Draco considered his options. If he went to one of the adults for help the other boys would see him as weak or worse, a tattletale, and Draco had already done a good enough job of painting a target on his back, he didn’t need to give them more of a reason to pick on him than they already had. So Draco finished his meal before excusing himself from the dining room. He could feel the other boys’ eyes on him as he got up to leave but he kept his head held up high.
Sinking down into the cushions of the couch, Draco poured himself a glass of the hard stuff and he drank until the room started to spin. He stopped long enough to puke into a potted plant then went back to the wine.
“I still can’t believe I let myself get blindsided by the bludger, though. I’ll be beating myself up about that for a while.”
After the funeral rites were performed Draco tried to sneak away without notice. He wished he could see Tibby and the others but he knew it was probably for the best that he didn’t linger. However, before he could leave Lucius’ widow stopped him.
Draco padded across the room and sat down in the uncomfortable chair next to his father. He felt quite small and insignificant as his feet barely reached the ground. Seconds passed while Draco waited for his father to speak.
All the teams were staying at the Hotel Casa Tarongí for the week. The tournament itself was only three days but most of the teams arrived a few days early. All the players mingled with each other and a few groups left to explore the city. Draco opted to stay behind and read his book.
Draco still didn’t know what to do, but he found himself heading in the direction of the library automatically. Maybe he could find some answers there. There had to be books about squibs in the library. Thomas was a pureblood so surely there had to be something there that could help. Draco quickened his pace.
“I think I would like to tell Pansy as well, if that is ok. She already knows I’m not interested in girls, and well I’m sure she at least suspects the rest of it. Honestly, if she doesn’t know already she will the second she sees the two of us together.”
Draco looked down at his shaking hands. The tea smelled like old socks but Draco forced himself to take a sip. It wasn’t as bad as it smelled and had some earthy undertones. Draco finished the rest of it and set the cup down.
After returning to the hotel, Draco stopped by the front desk to place a room service order for the morning when he caught sight of a familiar face at the hotel bar.
He thought about going for the debate team, but it would feel strange being around Vanessa every day so he passed on that. Duelling club was out since Asim was a member. He tried Wizard Chess for a few days but found it to be dull and boring.
After a couple laps around the school, Draco slowed down and tried a few loops. His stomach dropped each time he flipped upside down, and he couldn’t get enough of the feeling. He spent the whole afternoon in the air testing out loops, spirals, nose dives, and any other trick he could think of. Too soon, the sun began to set and Draco forced himself to land.
As they got up to leave Krum’s eyes locked on to Draco. For a split second, he looked surprised but quickly his features hardened once more. He gave Draco a nod of acknowledgement before following his colleges out the door.
. It’s very good. It came out a few years ago but I haven’t got around to reading it until now. If you like I can let you borrow it when I am done. At the rate I’m going I’ll probably be finished by tomorrow.”
After the mess of the party was straightened out, Draco kept going - wiping down the counters, fluffing the pillows… There was still an awkward tension in the air but Draco wasn’t quite ready to go home so he kept finding little things to do. He still wasn’t sure what had upset Harry so much in the first place, but Draco noticed that his mood was slowly improving.
He was already on his way to the kitchen to put on a pot of tea when Draco elegantly stepped out of the fireplace.
. Draco took another drink. Worst of all had been that smug look on Potters face when he saw the realization dawn on Draco.
After a while, Ginny wandered off but Blaise stayed behind regaling Draco with a story about his trip to Riyadh and how he got trapped in a Saudi prince’s palace for five days due to some malfunctioning wards.
Four miles later Draco was wheezing. Pot-- Harry handed him a bottle of water and Draco gulped it down.
“You flatter me. I’ll think about it and let you know,” Draco said though he already wanted this more than anything.
He made his way over to the seeker’s locker to put away his stuff before one of the guys approached him. He was sporting a mohawk and from the build of him, he was one of the beaters - either Harrison or Cole. Draco braced himself for the encounter not really knowing what to expect.
He knew it would have to end eventually, but his next match was a few days away and he just needed to be numb for a little while.
, Draco thought as he swallowed the capsule. He waited a few seconds but nothing happened. Maybe it took a while to kick in?
Practice was over way too quickly. Draco showered and changed before wandering around the complex looking for Harry. He ended up in the coach’s office before finding out that Harry had taken off right after practice had ended.
Draco tried to concentrate on the book but found that he just couldn’t focus. He felt restless and exhausted and he just wanted a drink. He knew Pansy wouldn’t have any alcohol in the flat but he could always go out and find some himself. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Motherfucker. Draco got up and paced around the flat.
Draco made small talk with the two of them and learned that Ginny had signed a contract for the upcoming season to play for the
“You’re on, Potter.” And with those words, Draco took off from the ground. Harry came up behind him and they raced across the garden. After a couple of laps they switched to showy tricks. Draco admired the natural grace Harry had on a broom.
And so Draco decided to make a conscious effort, not because Pansy had told him so, but because there were still many weeks left before school started up again and Draco would go insane if things carried on this way.
The next day all the first-years were given a written and practical exam to determine their abilities. Draco was mortified to find that he placed somewhere just above the middle. The examinations were clearly biased as the wizard-born students had an advantage in the written portion having access to books and materials that their peers had not. Draco had been eight the last time he had been exposed to magical theory or read a wizarding book and many of the questions flew over his head. As for the practical portion, Draco had hoped to have a bit of a leg up from all the wandless magic he had practised and while he didn’t make a fool of himself he found that he was not the natural talent some of his classmates were.
He ducked his head slightly and let out a nervous laugh before making eye contact again. “I’m sorry about last night. I promise I wasn’t trying to hustle you.”
“I wouldn’t. I’m sure you are an expert at hiding it, but I trust you.” Harry paused for a moment before moving on. “Second rule, have fun.”
Draco turned and stormed off, not leaving Potter enough time for a response. In a few steps he reached the designated apparition point, and as he disapparated he was left with a single thought. It didn’t matter if he ever made it to number one, all that mattered now was beating Potter by any means necessary.
Vratsa Vultures took the world by storm from the moment he first got on a broom. He has been hailed as the best seeker of his generation and even debated to be the greatest seeker the wizarding world has ever seen.
He couldn’t meet Dubois, not like this. The owl lingered on the window sill waiting for a response. Draco scribbled a quick note to tell Dubois that he wasn’t available today, but that if he was still in town tomorrow Draco would love to have him over for afternoon tea.
For the trip everyone dressed in their school-issued windbreakers and their own trainers. Draco only had the black dress shoes that paired with his uniform, so he had to transfigure his old shoes from l'Internat into a workable pair of trainers. They pinched his feet a little at the end, but it was nothing too painful.
The only joy Draco found was in his books. As much as his father had disliked all things muggle, Draco had to admit that they had pretty good imaginations. The stories gave Draco an escape from the rundown institution and his love for reading grew tenfold. The downside was that the other boys did not share the same appreciation for literature, when they found him reading the teasing would always get worse. It was yet another sign of Draco’s breeding and intelligence, a reminder that he thought he was smarter than them. And that was true enough, in fact, Draco was smart enough to know
He couldn’t perform any kind of magic that might get him in trouble with the ministry. It had to be something that a young wizard might do accidentally. Something that would not alert any muggles. So he focused on erasing errors in his penmanship, adding a little extra flavour to his food, or healing small cuts and bruises.
Draco agreed and Xavier left with one last kiss. Draco took a few more moments to compose himself. With Xavier gone the classroom felt empty and cold.
The next couple of weeks were miserable. Draco continued to attend classes but that was pretty much it. Half the time he was hungover the other half he was drunk. Draco spent most of the day in bed but somehow he was getting less sleep than ever before. He wasn’t sure if he was still being counted for his work-study but no one had brought it up so he figured it was fine.
Pansy frowned. “Ok, ok. I just have to handle this one thing and then I’ll be your’s for the rest of the week.”
Dinner was a quiet affair, and afterwards Draco cleaned up while Pansy did some work. That night Draco tossed and turned but he couldn’t fall asleep. His entire body felt like it was on pins and needles. His jaw ached from clenching it all day. And his head was killing him.
Blaise sat back. “No need to get defensive. He’s not going to hear it from me. But if he can’t see it for himself then he’s an idiot. He’s an idiot for letting you go.”
Harry had not taken his eyes off of Draco since he had walked out onto the pitch. Those bright green eyes were just… staring at him. Draco wanted to run and hide but he was frozen in place. A swift slap on the back jolted Draco out of his stupor and he realized everyone was giving him and Harry a polite applause.
“I think I understand now why you wanted me to train with you. You’re trying to kill me.” Draco said between bites.
On really tough nights, Draco would floo call Harry and they would talk for hours, until Draco fell asleep by the fire listening to his voice. The first time this happened, Draco had been horrified, but Harry reassured him that he enjoyed their late-night conversations so they continued.
Thomas shook his head. “Dad took me to see a specialist last month and they did a bunch of weird spells. They said I didn’t have any dormant magic at all so I’ll never get to come to Beauxbâtons for real.”
Pride of Portree, Draco doubled his efforts on the pitch. He poured all his energy into running drills, honing his reflexes, and sharpening his instincts. He knew Potter would be able to see any weakness and so he had to be sure there was no weakness to be seen.
Once he was dismissed, he would join the house-elves for dinner. He enjoyed his time with Tibby, Melrose, and Raynham. Even when his mother had been alive they were his only friends and now that she was gone they were all that he had left. His father expressed his disapproval when he noticed Draco’s familiarity with the elves, but on this matter Draco disagreed. They may be humble creatures but they were powerful in their magic and kind in their hearts.
“I’ve arranged for you to attend a muggle boarding school in Lyon starting in the new year, l'Internat Adolphe Favre.”
Third year Draco finally got to see his hard work pay off and the other boys started to include him in things. Instead of lunching alone in the gardens, Draco now sat in the dining chamber with his classmates. He even stopped his study sessions in Professor Dubois’ office, opting instead to join the study group in the library.
It took the entire day to make the place presentable. Draco cast his entire repertoire of cleaning charms and even resorted to some manual labour. He stopped every once in a while to sip from a half-empty glass or opened bottle, but a few hours after the sunset the place was clean enough for guests and Draco was exhausted.
“Your humility is astounding, Potter, but that was just a stupid charity match it doesn’t even count.”
Draco began to dread the approaching school year. He was afraid that it would mean the end of everything between them, and that thought began to eat away at him.
Draco, of course, was the centre of the party. A couple of the Durmstrang players could be spotted sulking in the corner shooting him nasty looks, but most everyone was happy that Durmstang’s six year winning streak was finally over. And Draco’s teammates were happiest of all.
Pansy had met the new owner at a party she attended with her boyfriend. When he mentioned he was looking to replace his seeker, Pansy had seized the opportunity and convinced the man to take a meeting with Draco.
“I always spend June in Paris. I like to enjoy the summer weather before it gets too hot. Join me for a drink.”
This year’s knockout was hosted by Spain. The top eight teams in Europe competing for the championship title.
Sixth-year flew by and Draco felt like he was on top of the world. He held his place as number one in the class and in quidditch he continued to win game after game, caring the team into the final playoffs.
The next moment happened so fast Draco didn’t even have time to react before the other boy’s fist made contact with his face. Draco stared at him, mouth open in surprise.
The snitch flew swiftly through the air before dropping sharply. Neither seeker hesitated to follow it, diving straight for the ground. Potter flew with a carefree grace and confidence but as they drew closer to the snitch his body language changed and Draco saw only determination.
“Oh, come off it Draco. We both know you more than enjoy it. Since the moment you got on that broom, there was no force on earth that would keep you grounded. I’m sure that if you became an Animagus you would be some kind of bird the way you take to the air.”
Draco pushed open the door to Pansy’s room. It was decorated in all white. There was a bookshelf with different knickknacks and a few books, mostly crime novels mixed with a few best-sellers and classics alike. Draco picked out a well-loved copy of Rebecca and went back downstairs to read.
“I don’t want to work it out and my problem is nosey, four-eyed arseholes who think they are better than everyone else.
A couple of hours passed this way before Draco excused himself. He swiped a bottle of wine from among the drinks table and ventured off into the woods by himself. He settled on a large rock, the paper dragon resting beside him. Using a spell he had seen the older kids do, he unstoppered the wine bottle and took a drink. The wine was sweet going down but left a bitter aftertaste in his mouth, he took another large sip.
The next day Draco was surprised to find an owl waiting for him, and even more surprised at the letter’s content. He had been invited to play on the national team for the World Cup in June. He flooed Harry immediately.
The gears in his head began ticking away. There was a lot of work to do, but Draco was excited. Magic was going to be a part of his life once more, and he was going to fix everything no matter what it took.
Skeeter was interrupted by the team manager before she could finish that thought, “I’m afraid Draco’s late for practice but if you would like a tour of the facilities I would be happy to oblige.”

Draco stood around awkwardly while the other boys talked about girls and dared each other to go say stupid things to them. The girls were gathered in their own little corner laughing and giggling. Draco was bored out of his mind. A few people had broken away from the main group and Draco tried to join in on a few of those conversations, but he quickly found that he had nothing in common with these people. It was the beginning of first year all over again. Everyone just repeated the same shallow interactions over and over again, and nothing substantial was ever discussed.
He wasn’t taking the pills, hadn’t for a while, and the days were a struggle to get through. His moods erratic at best. He knew he had let himself get pretty bad but he was trying - trying to get his shit together.
“Yes. In the air I am completely free. The wind at my back, a world of possibilities before me. It’s the only time when I can just let go and give up control.”
“That’s up to him. It will probably be painful but he won’t suffer any permanent damage if he decides to continue.” They both looked at Draco.
Draco burst into a fit of laughter at the image of Asim wrestling with a small twig. He expected Asim to get defensive, but instead the other boy was watching Draco with a look in his eye that Draco couldn’t quite place.
The funeral was held outside of the Château in Sancerre. Draco wasn’t even sure why he bothered to attend. He shouldn’t have come at all but he knew it wouldn’t have felt real unless he saw it with his own two eyes. It was a small gathering and it wasn’t hard to pick out his father’s widow though the children were a surprise - a boy and a girl. They were young. Younger probably than he had been when he’d lost his mother.
Draco showed up to the first day of training with a sense of determination. As he walked to the locker room he was hit with a sudden craving but he pushed the thought out of his mind focusing instead on his new goals. He was going to earn the respect of his teammates first, then hopefully the fans would follow. He knew it might take a while but he was willing to put in the work. He had no other option.
Draco heard the toilet flush and the girl emerged settling at the sink next to him. She seemed to be completely unperturbed by the situation. She had pale skin and her dark hair was cut in a sharp bob. She was pretty in that kind of off-putting way.
Draco didn’t cry at the service. His father wouldn’t have approved and he had already shed his tears the night she passed away.
Draco knew he was doing his job but he wished Mr Barker would just let him go already. “Thank you, but I’ve already arranged to make the trip with a few of my new classmates,” not technically a lie, “and I’m supposed to meet them in Croix-Rousse,” also not a lie.
“Hmmm.” She considered this for a bit before abruptly changing the subject, “I’m hungry. Are you hungry? I’m thinking Italian.”
He still remained quiet and a bit distant compared to the others, but he found that they actually cared about what he had to say now and even wanted his opinions on different things. For the first time in his life, Draco had friends, or at least acquaintances - but he figured it was only a matter of time before a true friend came his way, a friend like in the muggle stories he used to read at l'Internat.
Draco had not planned on following through with Pansy’s suggestion, but the next day he found himself walking past the quidditch shed and he had nothing else to do. If he took out one of the brooms now, he’d be able to tell Pansy and stop her nagging before it had truly begun.
“Malfoy’s triumphant return. Surely you must know the rumours that surrounded your father after he left.”
Draco went out to grab some lunch and the tea for Dubois, returning just in time to greet his old professor at the door.
, so we started a summoning ritual. We were in the middle of the incantation when the Aurors finally arrived.”
With the International Quidditch Tournament over, Draco had a few months until the next season started. He decided to return to France for the summer, renting a small home that was part of a magical community in the Var.
“I just might have to take you up on that.” Draco turned to Harry to ask if he had ever been to France, but Harry was gone. Draco caught a glimpse of him as he disappeared into the kitchen, so instead he turned his attention back to Blaise and carried on their conversation about food.
“Right! Listen, I am just going to get right into it. I was talking it over with the others yesterday and we’d like to offer you a place on the L'Équipe du Feu, as the seeker.
Draco didn’t say anything as he processed the words. Close to the entry hall a woman with dark curly hair waved Potter over and he turned to leave.
But they still had three brutal games to get through before they could face Krum. Why couldn’t they play Russia in the quarter or semi-finals? Draco thought to himself. At least then if they lost it wouldn’t be so devastating.
“It’s just Astronomy, and it’s mostly review. I would do it myself but it is just so boring, not worth my time. Here.” Vanessa handed Draco a small tin. “It’s muggle but it might as well be magic. One of those every morning and you’ll be done with everything by the end of the week. Add my paper to the end of your to-do list and if you don’t get to it, then you don’t get to it.”
“I know next to nothing about quidditch, but I do know that you don’t make it to the European finals without earning your place.”
Draco followed the other boys to the first-year dorms and found his supplies waiting for him in a trunk at the foot of his bed. He wasted no time in changing out of his old uniform. It felt good to be back in proper wizarding attire and he spared a moment to admire his reflection in the mirror. Of course, the uniform had not been custom-tailored but it fit him well and Draco’s light complexion looked good against the soft blue. His hair was still a disaster, but there was nothing he could do about that at the moment.
Draco glanced at her out of the side of his eye, before finally turning to face her head-on. He gave her a look he hoped conveyed ‘
“You’re beautiful when you laugh, well you’re beautiful all the time, but especially when you laugh.”
Draco was conscious enough to warn Xavier when he was close and Xavier pulled off with a pop. He replaced his mouth with his other hand and it didn’t take long for Draco to climax. When he came back to himself he realized Xavier was spent as well, both of them were flushed and panting.
“Pleasure to meet you boys.” Pansy smiled as the other boys said their hellos and introduced themselves, then she took over the conversation from there. Draco hadn’t known her for more than a day, but he knew her well enough to just go along with it.
“Sure right now you are, but I hardly ever see you. You’re always locked away in your dorm with those stupid books.”
“You are so hot like this,” he breathed in Draco’s ear before kissing his way down his neck. Then hands replaced lips travelling down Draco’s shoulders and chest as Xavier continued his way downward until he was on his knees.
Tea was pleasant. Draco had forgotten how much he enjoyed herbology and was fascinated by Dubois’ stories. It had been a while since his last drink though and he was starting to wane. His head in particular was killing him.
Fridays quickly became Draco’s favourite day of the week. Professor Dubois’ classes were always interesting and engaging, and Draco was the best in the class. He got particularly excited when, a few weeks into the semester, Dubois scheduled a three-hour hike through the woods that bordered the campus. They were going to hunt for Amanita muscaria, and Draco wanted to be the first one to find it.
“What does it look like I’m doing? I’m dusting off these bookshelves. Have you even touched any of these books since moving in?”
Krum mostly listened adding a comment here or there but there was one word he said that stood out to Draco, решительным (reshitel'nym). He called Draco strong, determined.
Brevis Birch, the team captain, was a bit of a hard ass but Draco mostly ignored him. At first this pissed Birch off but after Draco won them the first couple of matches Birch was happy enough to leave Draco to his own devices for the most part.
Scorpius seemed to consider that for a moment but then he smiled. 'Okay. What do you have in that bag?'
Harry listened to the words and wondered about them through his dazed and foggy state. Could Ladon be right? It couldn't be that easy. Surely not - after all these years, he couldn't just -
But Malfoy doesn't make any indication that what he'd just said was an invitation and Harry forces himself to take a breath, finishing his toastie and brushing off his hands. He's being ridiculous. He needs to get himself under control.
'So you have no idea what will happen this time?' Malfoy asks, and his tone sounds deceptively casual.
He stepped forward. 'What's wrong?' he demanded. 'Have you and Ginny broken -' he cut himself off at the look of shocked confusion on his mother's face, and instead looked between the two of them again, gaze lingering on Harry's face and the emotion still written across it.
Malfoy hesitated a moment longer, half-turned in his chair, face conflicted as though trying to see if there was any way he could salvage the situation. Then he sighed and stood, smoothing down his dark robes.
He sat awake through the night, holding vigil for James, for his memory if not his body, in a way that he had failed to do when he was alive. Harry sat alone on the top of a mountain, thousands of miles from anyone who knew him, and grieved his son anew.
'Young Master,' Modrey said, inclining his head, so that his large ears flopped forward. 'Master is in the red drawing room. Modrey shall take you to him.'
Harry flushed and looked away, snapping himself out of it. Instead, he took a cursory look around the room, sending his diagnostic charms out in front of him like he had in every other room. Only this time, one of them returned a result that was more than just centuries of magic imbued into the building.
'I'm going to lick you, Harry,' Ladon said, voice gravelly and low. 'If you feel like you're going to come, I need you to say "yellow". I will be very disappointed if you come before I say you can.'
Harry let out a bitter laugh that was partly a sob, at that thought. He would have to erase half his life if he wanted to remove Malfoy from it.
Malfoy remains silent as they come into Manchester and he steers them to what appears to be yet another of his hideouts. He chooses a white Land Rover this time, exiting the jeep and transferring the suitcase in a few seconds.
He reached for it, pulling it closer and lifting the lid. He moved the folded letter to one side and looked down into the dozen gleaming bottles. He could see the wisps of memory glowing blue as they undulated slowly in their containers. Each had a tiny tag attached and Harry could make out a few words.
'We use the same sort of colours that we did in the scene. Red for stop or no - things you have no interest in, or don't want to do. Yellow for slow down or unsure. Things you might like to try but will require further discussion or negotiation. And green for go. Things you know you like or definitely want to try. I can talk you through any terms you don’t understand.'
Harry looked back down at the three letters still in front of him. He grimaced again and then picked up Ron's,  cutting the seal off and taking a deep breath before opening it.
had made modifications to tech that allowed it to co-exist alongside magic. There was a camera in the room he'd been given, so he hadn't been able to wear the cloak to sleep, but something, maybe the images of the Seals carved throughout the building, had kept hooded figures from his dreams. To keep the cloak off out in the open, though, was too much to ask. He relaxed into the comfort of wearing it again and slipped silently out of the restaurant. The papers he'd stolen included Apparition coordinates for a number of points around the city. Apparently Malfoy had established himself a regular routine.
Draco rose to the bait beautifully, holding out his hand and wandlessly Accioing one of the brooms. It hit his palm with a smack and Harry grinned.
Harry took a deep breath and concentrated, not on specific spells, but on the outcome he wanted - on changing everything back to normal.
He latches on to the thought. Yes, it's because he wants to mess with Davies. Malfoy doesn't need to know the real reason why. Harry doesn't want to examine the real reason why.
Aunt Petunia's words were hissing, disgusted, as she accused him of things he didn't understand. Uncle Vernon's words were booming and angry, accompanied by smacks to make sure he got the message into his stupid head.
He finished the file and moved into his study with another glass of firewhisky. Two more files later and he found himself drifting back into memories of the club again.
'I'm not staring at you,' Harry says, looking down at his own sandwich, barely touched. It's not like him to pick at his food, and the fact that Malfoy will know that is an equal mixture of annoying and some emotion that calms the wolf just a fraction.
He went inside and shifted the bundle of clothes into one arm before he picked Pads up, holding him just under his chin for a moment. The smell of him, and the cuddly warmth tucked against his body sent pain and grief ripping through Harry. He swallowed against it, burying his face in the bear's fur. He took one, deep, steadying breath, and then another. Then he pulled the bear away from his face and tucked it into the Mokeskin Pouch as well, resolutely not looking down into his confused, scrunched up face.
When it was done, Harry straightened slightly, so he was looking over the back of the couch. Andrews had his face buried in Malfoy's neck again, but his arm was moving in a rhythm with his own, increasingly fast thrusts.
Lucius was led to a table beside the raised platform in the middle of the room. He lowered himself to sit beside his lawyer, looking for all the world like he was there out of choice. Harry gritted his teeth, staring at the man's back, glad at least that Lucius was sitting far enough forward in the courtroom that he couldn't easily turn to look at Draco.
. He feels raw with the words. The pain of Teddy's loss is something he's had bound up inside himself for so long now. Letting go of his anger and his hate feels like letting go of a part of Teddy. And that realisation makes him feel sick and small, that his memories of Teddy are so bound up in hate. That isn't what remembering should be.
Harry grinned and winked at Ron, taking his cup and the cloth from the air and taking a sip as he turned his expression on Hermione. She rolled her eyes at him from where she sat on the floor by the tree. Harry remembered their conversation the night before. Sadness, understanding, compassion. He felt emotion well up in him again. He didn't know what he'd done to deserve friends like these two.
The moan at his ear was loud enough that he could hear it over the music. Harry focussed on it. He wanted this. This was real. He wanted the freedom of a hook-up with a stranger - someone who had no idea who he was, and who he could have some fun with, just for tonight. He wanted to feel the man's mouth on his, press against him and get some relief for himself.
Harry was jolted out of his thoughts by a slight squeeze on his neck and he opened his eyes to see that two people had stepped onto the stage. They were illuminated by a spotlight. Mirrors hung from the ceiling above, angled in so he could see them from all sides.
'He was collecting Brumbling Bizzingtons when he was stung to death. I checked afterwards, and he was wearing his yellow-spotted wellingtons. They never would have stung him if he was wearing those. He's worked with that colony my whole life.'
Ron joins them a minute later, sitting heavily into a seat beside Harry, cup of coffee in hand. He nods at Draco but turns his attention to Harry.
He fielded questions from other people on the trip, about something a Muggle had said, or done, that they didn't understand, but Malfoy had no such questions. Occasionally, Harry turned, to find grey eyes on him from across the market, but Malfoy soon turned back to Scorpius' never-ending stream of chatter.
Malfoy lets go of him and steps away, running one hand through his hair, so that it falls in loose, messy strands over his forehead.
He doesn't know how much time has passed before he wakes again, but there's a voice calling to him, high and scared. He blinks awake in the darkness, trying to orient himself.
Harry felt his heart go out to Malfoy. He was clearly struggling to hold himself together in the absence of his child. Part of Harry was pulled towards him, to comfort him. To say
'Yes, Mr. Potter. Minister Shacklebolt is very keen to see that the children's first excursion into Muggle London goes smoothly and safely. He asked me to pass on his clear expectation that you will personally ensure this is the case.'
Harry spends the time missing him like mad. He doesn't know when he became so dependent on Draco being around, on his snide comments, his soft looks when he thinks Harry isn't paying attention, his way of filling the room with his presence even when he isn't speaking.
hype had started to die down as well with no further incidents, and no group stepping forward to claim responsibility.
Finally Draco sat up slightly, and Harry held out his hand, a box of tissues flying into it. Draco rolled his eyes but took a few, wiping at his face.
'I'm the Master of Death,' Harry said abruptly, the words leaving him before he'd had time to think about them. But the moment he said it, looking Draco in the eyes, he knew it was right. He'd told Draco he didn't want secrets between them -  he couldn't keep this one.
As he reached the door, Harry glanced over his shoulder. Malfoy was still standing behind the bar, arms crossed as he stared at Harry's departing form. Harry turned away, smile still on his face. He would have to get some Felix for home. It was pricey but oh, so worth it. Harry hadn't felt this good in a long time.
It feels nice, but not as nice as Malfoy's palm running over the skin of his back, careful to avoid his wound. Malfoy is lying on his side, facing Harry, one arm cushioned under his head, the other hand continuing its soft, soothing strokes over him.
Draco's eyes narrow. 'It was a calculated risk,' he says. 'And it paid off exactly how I thought it would.'
'You're in one of our executive apartments. Your companion checked in a few hours ago.' She hands him a key card with a bright smile and a touch that lingers against his fingers just a moment too long. Harry forces himself to hold his smile.
Harry freezes, trying to process the words that had been in his mind, the desperate edge to them, and the way Malfoy's scent has changed as he looks at the pictures, from aroused to disinterested. The mixed messages don't make sense to him. It's enough—
of all people. He strode towards the door, wrenching it open and standing beside it. His voice was hard and certain when he spoke. 'I don't want anything to do with you.' He fixed his gaze implacably on Malfoy's slim form.
Harry wondered what he would do with the ropes. Who he would do it with. He sipped his drink, letting the peaty burn linger on his tongue. The faint sharpness of it focused him in on the man on the stage.
And what could he do but face it? He'd wanted to wait. To plan it. To tell Harry in a way that he could control. He'd been an idiot. Draco bent stiffly, as though he'd shatter into pieces if he moved too fast. He picked up the band of leather Harry had thrown at his feet. He wrapped it around his fingers and clenched his fist as he tried to feel something. The numbness was getting worse, fogging his mind and slowing his thoughts.
Harry shook his head emphatically. 'No. Not Ginny. Besides, that's not really where I bat, nowadays.'
'And she told me she's been wanting to fuck someone else for months. She's in love with him because she can't talk to me or some rubbish,' Harry growled. The fire flared again, high and hot, crackling and twisting.
He looked unaffected, but Harry could see his foot twitching slightly. Jiggling. Lucius was scared. He knew that such a quick decision-making process could only mean one thing. Complete exoneration, or life-long incarceration.
'Yes, absolutely fascinating,' Harry says. 'This is perfect, thanks. We'll definitely check it out.' He reaches out and sweeps all of the brochures into a pile, gives David a big smile before he turns to Malfoy.
Harry looked down at the small, blond figure clutching Draco's hand, peering out shyly from behind his leg. The boy looked to be about Archie's age and was the spitting image of his dad.
She shrugged, 'Your loss,' and directed him into the public area with a knowing smile. He ignored her.
Harry turned, the sound ringing in his ears. It was dark, but he could hear the cries. All he could hear were the cries. He turned again, reaching out, trying to find him.
But then Harry thought about Azkaban and the years Malfoy had spent there. He thought about the rumours he'd heard, about Aurors who took a rotation to Azkaban - Aurors who'd lost people during the war. He remembered seeing the same angry, red scars across Malfoy's Dark Mark, as though they'd been branded there.
Scorpius shrank away from him, fear entering his eyes, despite Harry's words. Harry felt anger flare to life at the thought of what this child might have been through in the last year. How could Malfoy
'Well they're mouldy,' Harry said flatly, and then he frowned as he noticed a slight twitch of movement from the mould.
Draco tapped the letter with his wand to seal it, then ran his fingers lightly over the parchment before he sighed, picking it up and placing it gently on top of the hundreds of others inside the case in front of him.
'You're back early,' Pansy said, shrugging out of her makeshift costume. Draco took the hint that he wasn't to speak of what he had witnessed. He gave her one last look that told her he wouldn't be forgetting it and then shrugged.
He continued to read for a minute longer, though Harry could tell he was faking it. His eyes were barely moving.
Harry looked around, and then up, whirling into an Apparition that took him to the roof of a skyscraper nearby. Once up there, he didn't look down at the violence below. He could still hear it faintly. The sound of explosions, sirens blaring, the crackle of flames. He didn't look for the Preservation symbol—the sign of Conquest—but he knew it would be out there.
'Hmm?' Draco murmured, only half listening as he looked in the mirror, holding two different ties up against his shirt.
Ron grimaced. 'I've already been to work. I came by because the last two times I have, you haven't been here and you haven't been answering my owls and Dean just owled me to say he saw you at a club last night and you looked really out of it. But yeah, we can go to work together if you like.'
'Harry,' said the voice of the person holding his arm. 'Harry, you need to breathe. Please, can you breathe with me?'
Harry glances back at the building. There are giant hot pink tits blinking at him from the blacked-out window.
The museum opened into a street across from Central Park. It took Harry about fifteen minutes to find what must be the Wizarding entrance. It was a small courtyard in a part of the building that looked much older. The crumbling bricks and stonework reminded him of Hogwarts. There were no Muggles moving around this area, and when Harry concentrated, he could feel the charms wrapped around the space. Instead of pushing him away, they seemed to be doing the opposite, calling him closer. There was something seductive about them, as though they were speaking just to him.
He shook hands with the portly old man, easily resisting the testing pressure squeezed against his hand. The former Minister for Magic laughed, 'Haven't gone soft cooped up in your office then, Mr. Potter?'
He felt a surge of anger run through him again. Malfoy had collared him. Publicly. Without his knowledge. Malfoy had been flaunting his ownership over Harry for months, before they'd even become friends. He wondered who Draco had told - who had been laughing at him - Head Auror Harry Potter - the Boy Who Lived, his childhood enemy's pet.
Heat came into his eyes as he watched Harry. He turned fully around and took a step closer. Harry found himself somehow held by the intensity of the man's hard, blue eyes as they came face to face.
Harry watched Draco, impatient for the whole thing to be finished now. They needed to get out of here.
Harry looked at the words, reading them but not seeing the meaning in them that Draco did. He looked down at Draco and took stock of the certainty in his eyes and the intelligence burning there.
'Hello, young Dominus,' Jakub said, looking across at him, his eyes flickering for a moment in the fading light.
Harry came out of the dream more quickly this time, sitting up on the bed, breathing quickly. He could still feel the press of Malfoy's body against his, feel the heat of his mouth. He shifted uncomfortably, aware that he was just as hard as he had been in the dream. He wanted to get up and confront Malfoy, ask him what the fuck that had been, but he didn't want to reveal just how affected he had been.
Draco narrowed his eyes but was interrupted by Scorpius' piping voice. 'I'm not a handful! Are we playing some more? I want to play Heir to the Castle again!'
'I've been thinking about that too,' Harry said, 'And I don’t think it will work. I've given the cloak to other people before. Loads of times. It doesn't make a difference. I think it has to be passed down to my child - to my blood.' He swallowed dryly and saw Draco's eyes flick across to him.
The woman smiled at him and now there was a predatory nature to her gaze. He felt something in him stir in response. Something unfamiliar.
He turned on his heel and ran for the stairs, thumping his way up them, his earlier exhaustion forgotten. He could hear Ginny's voice now too, soft and sweet and he felt his heart thump inside his chest, aching with a desperate pain.
Harry made his way through the room, dropping his jacket at the coat check and thanking the Muggle woman there, then rolling his sleeves up to his elbows. It was warm in the room. He collected a glass of Edradour Ballachin from the bar, not surprised this place was stocked with the expensive stuff, then strolled over to look out the window, gazing at the city below. It was breathtaking from up this high, seeming almost motionless, distant lights twinkling in the darkness.
Draco seemed to sense that hesitation. 'I'm not a virgin, Harry,' he said, something in his face telling Harry that he wasn't quite as confident as he was claiming to be either.
The blond man pouted, slanting Harry a look that was filled with heat as his eyes flicked over Harry's chest, through the open front of his overcoat. Harry realised with a faint flush that he was wearing one of his old t-shirts that stretched tight across his chest and arms.
'Mr. Potter,' Malfoy said, his voice the same thin drawl Harry remembered. 'I was sorry to hear of the attacks. I read of them in the papers, of course. It's horrifying, to see evidence of the things Muggles are capable of.'
'Hello, Luna,' he said, greeting her with a strained smile. 'What brings you to visit us today? I'm afraid there's rather a lot happening, so we probably can't give you our normal hospitality.'
'No more talking,' Harry says. He steps back slightly and casts scent-deadening spells over both of them. He thinks for a moment and then casts a
'What you said,' Ron says, 'About doing the interrogations. As soon as we have the last of them rounded up, I want to go and see Robards and the Minister.'
Weasley went to speak again but Granger put a hand on his arm, that same calculating look in her eyes. 'Why are you here?' she asked bluntly.
'I don't know who you have screening mail from convicted criminals, but this person calls themselves "The Heir". That alone should have been a warning flag for someone who was corresponding with a pureblood supremacist, no?'
I'm going to fuck you.' Harry felt his breath hitch at the words, at the idea of Ladon's mouth on him - there ... Ladon teasing him … Ladon in him. He felt his cock pressing against his jeans, hard and aching as Ladon twisted long fingers back in his hair, bringing him closer.
He shook his head, fighting off the nausea, fighting to take a breath. She'd killed James. He'd been avenging his son. He had to do it. He repeated that to himself. He'd
Harry went back to the Museum. He didn't know where else to go. The creature inside Malfoy had severed the trace Harry had placed on his wand. It must have found the tracker after he followed it to Scorpius, but left it in place to lure Harry in. Now that it knew he wasn't going to be taunted into releasing it from Malfoy's body, it had obviously decided to keep away from him. Harry had no idea where it could have gone.
'Tonight?' he asked, aware there was a plaintive note in his voice. But he couldn't be expected to fight that. It had been three days. Three days since Draco had let him orgasm. Sure, they'd done other things in that time but -
Harry took a sip of his drink and thought about that. 'I thought some of my Dreamless was missing,' he said. Ron's look morphed into something angry.
He'd never showed it openly like that when he and Harry had been together. He hadn't even let Harry see it anything more than accidentally. After they'd started taking their clothes off—after the thing between them had become more than quick, hard fucks in the loo—it had taken Harry a while to realise that Draco always placed his body just so, or turned the lights out as they started to undress. It had been months before Draco would stand naked in front of him and not try to hide himself.
The breath of air came again, then he felt Ladon's tongue, hot and wet, skating over the base of his balls, over the ring that held them tight and then up, dragging with delicious slick pressure over his hole. He gasped at the sensation. It felt better - so much better - than his fingers ever had.
things like that. Time magic is - it's - you're breaking Myrdin's fundamental law of conservation of magical energy in a time continuum. People can't just ...' She trailed off and looked at him helplessly.
Ginny's gaze sharpened and Harry suddenly realised how the question had come across. He backpedaled. 'I mean - I didn't want to pry. I just wanted to make sure you have somewhere.'
It was three in the morning when Harry got back to Grimmauld Place. He went upstairs quietly, but wasn't surprised to see that the bedroom was empty. He didn’t have the energy to wonder where Ginny had gone. He hoped she was okay. He'd have to owl her in the morning. Apologise for the way he'd reacted. They should talk. That wasn't the way he wanted things to end.
Harry almost laughed in her face, a strange sort of bubbling joy rising in him. He knew exactly what Malfoy offered, and somehow he couldn't imagine the straight-laced Auror Barclay taking it.
He opened the container and the warming charm released a burst of steam. He breathed in the smell of the lasagne and gave a low moan.
Harry scans over it quickly and nods, excitement sparking in him, tempered by caution. They have to keep doing this right. They can't afford to fuck it up again. 'Say you're right; where is it?'
'Trust that pointy git to be wound up with that lot,' Ron said, with a look of disgust. 'Did you hex him?'
Harry looked down at his cup, running his finger over the rim of it, and then looked back up again into her familiar brown eyes.
Harry woke with a thumping headache and a feeling like he'd run a marathon. His whole body felt drained. He blinked, squinting against the bright lights as he tried to get his bearings, turning his head with an effort that took far more energy than it should and wrung a low groan from him. He recognised the smell first. Bloody St Mungo's always smelled like this overly sweet cleaner Aunt Petunia had made him use. The stink of it used to cling to his hands for days. He hated the memories his hospital visits always stirred in him.
He forced in a breath, locking the image out of his mind. This was not where James lay. This place had nothing to do with him. Harry was here to do a job. That was all. He had to get his fucking shit together and do his job.
She gasped and whirled around, dropping a hand to her apron, where she often tucked her wand, but she relaxed almost immediately when she saw him, only to tense again.
The look Malfoy gives Davies as he says this is more of a leer and Harry bites his tongue so hard he tastes blood. Davies' look of faint suspicion disappears as he leans in to murmur in Malfoy's ear. Harry hears him, just like Davies had meant him to.
Draco stared at his father, incredulous, holding Scorpius back against himself protectively. He revelled in the warm, heavy weight in his arms, the smell of Scorpius' hair. Draco thought about the fact that he had almost lost his son and he felt fury rise within him and he gripped his wand, pointing it at Lucius.
'No,' Scorpius objected. 'Not fair. Mr. Harry just got here.' Malfoy gave Harry a pointed glance and Harry suddenly realised this was the reason Malfoy had specified eight. He felt a tingle of guilt.
'What did you mean, before, about Wizards being killed?' Harry asked, as she walked into the room. He'd realised while she was gone that she hadn't answered his question.
'I'm ready for stories, papa,' he said, and then stopped as he saw Harry. A moment later his whole face lit up in recognition. 'Mr. Harry! Why are you at my house?'
Malfoy looks at him like he's gone mad and then scoops the vial up, slipping it back into his pocket.
,' he says, gesturing to me, my trench-coat that's opened as I sit, showing jeans so tight they might be painted on and a light blue silk shirt that feels like magic when it rubs against my skin.
Malfoy shudders in his grip and Harry smells the sharpness of his pre come. He rumbles a growl, low and possessive. Malfoy pulls him closer in response and Harry growls again. He can't help it. He needs to have Malfoy. Now. Fuck all the reasons this is a bad idea.
Draco thought about his gut reaction to Potter's presence - to turf him out - to tell him to get fucked, with his judgement and his laws and his self-righteousness … but there had been this fascination in his eyes. His look had lingered on the images spread around the blue room that day and Draco had recognised the yearning for what it was - had recognised what it felt to be a moth before a flame, drawn without understanding that what you sought could consume you.
He sits back and lets himself enjoy the ride. He's never been this fast in a car. The Weasleys' old Ford Anglia's top speed hadn't come anywhere near what Malfoy is travelling now, even in the air.
'When they are newly manifested,' Conor said, 'they're easier to defeat. The Muggles have part of it right, those that follow the Christian religion. It's in their Book of Revelation. They place a scroll in God's right hand, sealed with seven seals. Their Jesus, the Lamb of God, opens the first four seals which summons four beings that ride out on horses. They go a bit off track after that. The Christian apocalyptic vision is that the Four Horsemen are to set a divine apocalypse upon the world as harbingers of the Last Judgment from their God. Their role is to give the people of the world a chance to repent before they die. It's quite macabre stuff. But the heart of it is right. There are seals, for each of the forces. The force that responds to the name of Conquest can be sealed back away using the Seal of Triumph.'
Ron is at the Ministry; he's called Robards in from bed and is working with him on coordinating the case management so it can be brought under official Ministry control. Harry shadows Banks, Ron having made it clear before he left that Harry was to be fully informed of all developments. He can't deny the way it thrills through his blood, being in the thick of things again. The room is a hive of activity and he feels alive with it, drugged with it. It's glorious.
He ground back on the feelings, rubbing the cloak between his fingers and imagining it numbing the anger, hiding it behind a cloud of fog. Getting angry wasn't going to help anyone. These people had things he needed to know.
Benoit was now nodding his head in approval, clearly processing the information while echoing his answer “six months that’s…Incroyable! Truly impressive !” Harry gave him a small smile, loving the fact he could impress the older wizard, and to his credit he’s been doing so for a while now.
“Mrs. Art...” That made her raise an eyebrow at him. “Sorry, Samantha,” He looked at her sheepishly; he still wasn’t comfortable with the whole ‘first name thing’. He had deduced that he had abandonment issues, if the psychology books that he had gotten is hands on was anything to go by. “We both know they will never let me go there, even though Ms. Hollingworth talked to them. It just made them angrier.”
Harry could see as Felix rolled his eyes and begun stalking towards him, a frown planted on his lips. ‘Stupid tree’ could be heard distinctly from Felix’s lips.
robes arriving?” Sabrina huffed impatiently. The owlery they use had been infected by a virus, so the owls were being treated and as a result, all deliveries had been halted for the past two days.
Ms. Hollingworth was his elementary school’s principal, after his first week in first grade, the teachers had insisted for Harry to be transferred to a higher level, but again the Dursleys resisted. So now only a week left of his first year and he was just about to kill every single one of his classmates. They were unbearable. It didn’t help that Dudley kept spewing lies about him yet again. The only thing that had prevented him from staging the Dursleys deaths and disappearing was Mrs. Art – sorry, Samantha. Even after she left the nursery school where they first met and published her children’s book (which had become very successful), she had still kept in touch with Harry. She even dedicated her first book to him and thanked him for the countless hours he tolerated her reading the book to him over and over again, improving it even though they both knew without her, Harry would have either gone insane or murderous… maybe even both.
After all of Harry's measurements were taken he was ushered into the fitting area in the back corner of the shop to try on some already pre-designed formal robes. which Mr. Tattings kept assuring Harry that anything could be changed and altered in any way that Harry desired.
Celest had written down the address in her elegant handwriting and had charmed it to follow Laurent around an hour before the set time to meet at the shop. This was the result of a misfortunate error on Laurent’s part last year when he had forgotten to pick up the presents she had specially ordered for Christmas. Apparently, it was not the first time such an incident had happened. Now Celest was determined to ensure it never happened again.
After the tree was set up, everyone was sitting by the fireplace, sipping on their drinks. The conversation was flowing and laughter could be heard from the windows outside the patio.
The Hat continued “Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas Slytherins are brothers.” Then Harry definitely did not want to be a Ravenclaw.
If any of you are in college and maybe an architecture major, you would know there is hardly any time to do anything trivial and fun! But alas I have decided to update every 3-4 weeks, so I won’t be MIA for months!
Harry knew that he was very smart. Even smarter than his own friends, but for reasons that he was not yet comfortable with or didn’t understand. He instinctively tried to make himself seem less intelligent and aware. Maybe it was because he wanted to finally belong somewhere or maybe it was because he still didn’t want to fully trust anyone, at least then he would always be protected.
Firstly, he managed to freak the Dursley’s out and see fear in their eyes; secondly, he found out that what he was doing was
“Harry Potter!” as soon as his name was announced the whole Hall fell quiet. That made Harry even more uneasy but refusing to show them any sign of weakness harry squared his shoulders and confidently marched up the stairs and sat on the stool smiling widely at his audience. He will not be affected by them. As soon as the hat was placed on his head, he could feel the magic of it intertwine with his own in a very curious and searching manner, the foreign magic was exploring his own. Testing him.
“Sabrina you better go get ready for your lesson before Benoit comes back, he was too silent during lunch. He’s going to get back at us any day now” Adele had a mischievous gleam in her eyes. Harry was pretty confident even when both siblings are grey and riddled with wrinkles they would still be pulling pranks on each other.
Benoit was already biting into his second biscuit and sipping on his tea when Mr. Twilfitt and Mr. Tattings seemingly appeared out of thin air, making Harry almost jump out of his seat. Almost.
“More like you’re jealous of us my little Einstein, even moving a mere frontalis muscle is hard for you! Not even in in complete control of your body…” Conner was now shaking his head in mock agony. Sometimes being cooped up in a room with these two was too much to handle.
“But before we end this conversation Harry, I must warn you. If nature spirits are approached with disrespect or by attempting to command them rather than listening to them and inviting them to work with you, nature spirits may flee, rebel, or attack! I once attended a ritual by some pseudo-Crowleyites who attempted to perform the "Ritual of the Barbarous Names" at a power spot in a forest and then to extend the circle several hundred yards in all directions. While the forest in general had loud insect and frog noises, the area at where the ritual took place got quiet immediately when the main ritualist declared that all spirits were subject unto him!” She paused for dramatic effect.
Then, Harry took a deep breath. Just like he planned he was going to use his magic to ‘condition’ or maybe a more accurate word to use would be coerce the Dursleys into doing what he wanted, what he deserved.
Harry was deep in thought, his calculus homework completely forgotten. It was moments like these that made him appreciate what he had done three years ago. He sometimes had nightmares that he was normal, that his magic was all a dream and he would have no means to defend himself against the Dursleys.
Harry was just too glad that next year when it was his turn he was in Hogwarts and didn’t have to host their annual Christmas tradition. He had already planned to stay with the Beaumont’s next year in Paris. The family had already gotten in touch with the Ministry and expressed their concerns about Harry’s family and demanded that Harry spend his holidays away at Hogwarts with them. And with the amount of influence that the family had over the Ministry and Harry’s celebrity status, the ministry had agreed very fast. As long as they kept quiet about Harry’s unfortunate childhood, as much as they knew about it.
“How can we be of service to you today? I’m guessing a certain letter is going to be arriving soon?” now he was wagging his eyebrows in Harry's direction.
At the same time it terrified her that if she got too involved and pushed too hard, she would be responsible in ruining his life or even making it worse. If she couldn’t help herself, what would make her believe that she could help him? So she had resigned to only being his friend and helping him out when he asked. It may have been the cowardly way out, but she just couldn’t be responsible for screwing him up even further than he was. He just carried so much in him, so much that even a man nearing his death shouldn’t have shouldered, let alone a six year old kid.
‘What do you think you are doing Potter? I was on my way there! It's mine!” Harry now very amused at the boy sauntered over very aware his slow movements were adding to the Silver-haired boys’ agitation.
“Felix are you sure your dad said he put it in this box?” Harry asked one of his best mates. They all had a tradition, to spend Christmas at one of their houses each year, and this year Felix was the lucky fella!
.” Again she looked at him, her eyebrows knitting together. “Are you sure you don’t need my help to read these? You know I would love to help you any way I can, sweetie.”
After they put his luggage and owl cage into storage Harry boarded the cart and waved one last time at his family and headed inside. It was time to face his new reality.
As they were driving to Kings cross Harry was reminded of his goodbye with the Dursley family. When he had mentioned he will be taking the train to Hogwarts Vernon had cheekily said: “Funny way to get to a wizard's school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?"
Harry sighed and leaned on the counter. Damn his prank failed, miserably if you may. Ever since he had discovered that he could do things that no one else could, he had been practicing so maybe he could make his life easier. It had started with little things, like, moving a piece of crumbled paper around the nursery school he attended with his cousin when he was four years old. He didn’t have friends, courtesy of Dudley; that bloody rhino kept telling everyone that he was a freak, that they should all keep a distance, and that he had a disease like his parents! So naturally everyone kept a safe distance from him, and Harry not having anyone to play with, passed the time by staring at inanimate objects and making a life story for them. There was this particular old chair that he deemed a celebrity among the other furniture, it was posh looking with burgundy cushions and yellow stripes on them so he had decided that it belonged in the Buckingham castle, but due to its ugly state it was kicked out and gifted to his school. Honestly it went pretty well with the ugly wall that was painted yellow because they were too cheap to clean the stains.
the Beaumonts had made an effort to teach Harry everything he needed to know about magic before going to Hogwarts. But as Harry had suspected, they had probably covered more than the materials he needed to know for his first year, but he didn’t mind at all. After all, information was power.
As they got closer to Hogwarts Harry's excitement grew, maybe this won’t be as bad as he thought. Ron and Hermine seemed very nice, so he was off to a great start. He hoped everyone else would be just as nice which he knew was statistically impossible.
“How the bloody hell did you do that?” Ron’s eyes were as big as saucers almost as if he had never seen magic before. “She asked me if I could clean the stains. I could.” Hermione now scooting away opening a space between herself and Ron for Harry to join them.
. Glitter? Oh god, it was everywhere! “bloody hell!” “merde!” “blimey Sabrina! I will kill you!” oh god harry had glitter everywhere! in his mouth, his nostrils, he was pretty sure there was a good amount circulating in his body by now.
“Really? Thirty? It seemed so much longer…” Harry said and tried to get away from Benoit. He hated when they made a fuss about him.
“So to get the best results, you should perform nature spirit attunement several hours to several days before the main ritual. The purposes of such attunement are to find suitable power spots and to get the help of friendly nature spirits. This timing gives nature time to gather her children and to prepare to actively participate in the main ritual.”
Blaise a dark-skinned boy he had met earlier at the sorting ceremony and now the occupant of the bed next to Harrys, approached him first and lightly inquired about Harry's abilities. He seemed friendly and naturally curious, but Harry had to remember that Slytherins were all naturally cunning so he had to remember to always watch his back until he was completely sure they can be trusted.
“What’s a seeker?” he asked her. It was probably a quidditch thing; he could faintly remember Benoit saying something of that kind.
Upon entering through the huge oak front doors of the castle, the students found themselves in vast Entrance Hall, which was dominated by a marble staircase leading up to the first floor. The giant hourglasses which Harry was told marked the house points were located in the Entrance Hall. To the right was the Great Hall. The staff room, the caretaker’s office, and classrooms were also scattered on this floor, as well as a courtyard where students apparently go to between classes.
While trying to find Brooke’s room, Felix and Conner had again gotten into a fight and were punching each other the whole way.
“We really need to do something about those two… I don’t know how they will survive without me and you mediating between them, and Brooke is even worse than them!” Sabrina said while looking at the boys that had now fallen behind.
According to Sabrina that’s what older siblings are supposed to do, make you feel loved and miserable. Ugh.
“No thank you, I think it will be best if you drove me home, I don’t want Vernon grounding me because I interrupted them in middle of their favorite show….” It certainly wouldn’t have been the first time, not that it mattered. The Dursleys always found something to blame him for and lock him in his cupboard, and to be honest Harry preferred it, it was much better than having to suffer through their senseless conversations and Dudley’s hurtful comments directed at Harry. At least in the dark he could relax and use his magic to entertain himself. Recently, he had discovered how to project images from his mind into the air around him.
“You know what, Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness. You have been chosen by this house because you've got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word!”
It was a particularly cold day and Harry was sitting by the window and looking at the angry sky. In a way he thought he could understand its anger and frustration, that is if you can relate to the weather. Maybe the sky was lonely like he was so it was trying to make everyone else feel how it felt. Alone, angry and sad. That was why Harry loved this weather; if Harry wasn’t allowed to go outside and play and enjoy the sun then no one else should either. He was so mesmerized by the clouds that when a paper ball hit his head his whole body jerked forward and he fell from the windowsill.
“Stupid school play!” Harry hated that school play. He, Sabrina, Felix, and three other poor souls had been cast as Santa’s elves. While the rest of the school (maybe a slight exaggeration) had respectable roles. Benoit had snagged so many pictures from them and had adopted the term of endearment ‘Mon lutin’ for Harry which was French for my elf.
Which resulted in Harry being slapped very roughly by his aunt and the four dishes and glasses on the way to the sink shattering on the floor. Dudley, trying to catch the floating dishes, cutt his foot on the crystals sprawled all around the floor. However, that wasn’t enough punishment; Vernon sat on a chair by the scene of the crime and berated Harry on his freakiness and disease, while watching Harry to see that he picked every single shard of glass by his hands and discarding them in a little bucket nearby. If he ever dared to do any sort of that magic voodoo like his sick, unstable parents, he will be shipped to a mental institution and straight into a straight-jacket.
Also I would love to hear your thoughts on where you think this story is going, and what you want to happen!
He felt at peace, like never before. He knew. What he knew? He didn’t even know. But he knew that he knew and he was okay with just knowing what he knew. Did that even make sense?
of July. Tomorrow. The thought of actually being whisked off to a magical school somewhere in Scotland where he knew no one somehow didn’t feel real to him. Receiving the letter would force him to finally accept the path that had been laid out for him or at least that’s what he was hoping.
Were there any empty carts left? Harry kept going down passing full carts after another until he stumbled across an orange-haired boy shoving chocolate frogs in his mouth and a curly-haired girl looking at him in both fascination and disgust.
Harry knew he had to put a stop to this now or it would go on for the next hour, as it had been happening every day for the past week since the incident in physics class were Felix made his mistake.
“Yh mate but I didn’t think you were THE Harry potter! I grew up listening to my mom’s stories about you and… well you know who…” Ron trailed off with a sad look in his eyes. Hermione looking confused asked the girl standing next to her to explain who Harry was. She did not grow up hearing stories about him and the murder of his parents. Whispers were breaking all over and everyone’s eyes seemed to be tracking his every move now. He did not like this at all.
The Slytherin common room looked out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. The Giant Squid and other interesting aquatic creatures could be seen roaming about from the gigantic windows.
“Oui oui….I’m… blimey…that was amazing…I was everywhere and nowhere and the colors and... and….” Harry was now sitting awkwardly on a rock with twigs sticking out of his hair, a silly smile slapped on his lips and his eyes twinkling.
“Oh baby I was so worried about you! Oh god! I thought I lost you! I swear I’ll stop smoking! Oh god I should have been there for you! I’m so, so sorry!” Her frantic arms were now circling around her, lifting up from the stretcher. The next ten minutes was filled with similar scenes: mothers and fathers scooping up their babies and dashing off.
“… Earth to Harry… Harry….. Oi Potter!” That last part got his attention and his eyes snapped towards the owner of the voice.
He hugged Sabrina tightly, taking in her scent, committing it to memory. She truly had become his family. She understood and knew him in a way that nobody else seemed to. She saw him for who he really was and loved him regardless. At times he had confessed to her the dark thoughts and impulses that crossed his mind, especially when the Dursleys had been at their worst. Abuse was a light term to describe what the Dursley family had put him through and he remembered every minute of it, some nights he would wake from night terrors, relieving his old memories. Just a 3-year-old child, terrified and lost in a sea of people and strange noises, crying, wetting his pants and so so lost and confused, so unloved and untouched. The Dursleys had forgotten him at a carnival they had all visited for Dudley’s birthday. 3-year-old Harry had spent 3 terrifying hours wandering the carnival and 2 other terrible hours waiting for his neglectful family to come to collect him after the police had calmed him down enough between his hiccups and tears to tell them his name.
“I was about to close the shop, you got here just in time” he grunted, Harry wasn’t sure if he was pleased or not with their presence.
me. And I will not tolerate being called any names and your oaf of a son spreading rumors about me in school! That’s not too much, now is it? Completely reasonable; what you should have done for me from the beginning!” He could see Petunia was dying to say something but raised a threatening eyebrow at her and pushed her harder on the couch with his magic. That seems to terrify her all the more and shut her up. “I’m not asking much, just let me be. Don’t talk to me, don’t look at me, ignore me for all I care. Pretend I don’t even exist. Just don’t get in my way or even try to intimidate me or go behind my back.
“Okay kids, open the doors cautiously and be careful and mindful of Brooke. Remember that she is in pain and that she needs to rest. So no monkeying around, are we clear?” Céleste was looking each child dead in the eye to convey her message. Being a CEO of a multimillion pound company, she knew how to express herself and achieve the desired effect.
“But now I’m so buggered,” he said as he was trying to stand on his wobbly legs. “How long was I gone?” he asked Benoit as he caught him and brought him to his side still checking him over.
Now, during his stay at the Dursleys all he had gathered from his parents was that they were alcoholics, unstable and very jealous of the Dursleys life. Which resulted in the car crash that killed them both, and burdened the Dursleys to take Harry in. Sometimes Harry wished he had died with them but now he had a way of getting even. So for the next two years he practiced in the dark of the night, locked away in his cupboard and entertained himself in the non-magical pranks he pulled on his awful relatives. After all Vernon did only say
“Oui, any day now!” Celest responded while she rubbed Harry's shoulders to confirm they were there for him.
“I would appreciate it if you don’t interrupt me again, understood?” he raised an eyebrow and surveyed their faces. They were afraid. Good. “You all degraded me, hurt me, abused me and over all hated my very existence! Why would you even take me in then? You could have given me up for adoption! Or shoved me off on another relative! And I took it all, mostly because I didn’t know I could defend myself; I didn’t know how special I was, but now… now I won’t let you continue on with your hatred towards me! Things are going to change. You will treat me with respect! And I will be moving to the bedroom upstairs, which requires new furnishing.” He may have gotten a bit emotional at the beginning but now he was in control again. Hmmm, what else does he need?
birthday party was a massive success, thanks to the Beaumonts. Adele and Benoit took care of the decorations, Laurent Baked and cooked everything that was consumed, and Celeste made sure all games and trials ran smoothly, after all, 11-year-olds are not known for their rational and even tempers.
Harry nodded enthusiastically, remembering the first time he spoke to her, asking about her peculiar last name, to which she responded that it meant a Champion, a Follower of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Upon seeing Harry’s interest on the subject she kindly asked him to give his opinion on the children’s book she was writing based on the Norse mythology and Harry having nothing better to do for the nine hours he attended this yellow walled hell-hole, accepted the invitation and spent Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in Mrs. Art’s small office listening to her beautiful voice and succumbing into a world of gods and adventures and occasionally asking questions about the characters and their origins, the mysterious force throwing the ball across the room forgotten…for now.
“Sweetie, I saw you fall after the paper ball hit you,” she gave a dirty look towards Dudley the perpetrator of the attack. From experience she knew that reprimanding the children for picking on Harry only made matters worse for him. “Do you want to sit with me? I can read the rest of my story for you?”
The silver-haired boy was still too startled to speak and just walked over to his new bed and continued to stare at Harry which then made Harry notice that everyone at the dorm was staring at him. He had been warned that his magical abilities were far too advanced and might cause some envy and fear, among others. Murmurs were starting to sweep all around him again. Harry guessed he needed to get used to all this.
“…ARE YOU MAD!?” Uncle Vernon asked as he tore into the kitchen. His eyes were livid and if this were a cartoon Harry could imagine steam sprouting from his ears. “How many times, in these six years have I told you boy, that Dudley is allergic to peanuts? HUH? Are you trying to kill him? Handing him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! I’ve always said that you are DAFT!” he shouted the last word and opened the trashcan with such force that when the metal lid connected to the wall, Harry jumped and Aunt Petunia shrieked from the next room.
She gave him a last hug, made him promise to write to her as soon as he gets sorted and goes to his dorms. After Sabrina boarded the train, the family made their way to Harry's station. Harry could see many kids wearing robes like his with owl cages and suitcases rushing towards a brick wall and disappearing upon contact. Cool. One by one they followed suit. Benoit making jokes as they went, helping Harry's nerves. Harrys hands we ice-cold, his heart beating fast. He was very nervous. Adele sensing his hesitation took his small hands in her own and whispered a calming spell in his ears and Harry's shoulders slumped in relief as soon as the words were uttered. “Merci” Harry gave a light squeeze to her hands before releasing them. He felt much better now. Time to meet other witches and wizards. This should be exciting.
Hmmm so instead of his kids, the gods punish him?” He still didn’t like the whole idea of Loki being captured (he was his favorite character after all), but he knew each story had to have a ‘moral’ ending for the kids.
“Merci Adele!” Harry kissed her cheek and smiled at her. “I will try my best! I won’t stop till mother nature loves me!” he proclaimed in a cheeky manner and dashed off to Sabrina, where she was pretending not to be listening in on their conversation.
Finally, Laurent Presented the dish to the starving spectators with a loud “Bon appétit! [Enjoy your meal!]”
One by one students were called up on the stage and the hat after seconds or sometimes minutes loudly announced his decision. Everyone so far seems to be pleased with their sorting, so Harry was trying to be optimistic about what was about to transpire.
“What are you smiling about, you little devil? Another prank on Dudley?” Samantha asked him upon seeing a devious grin stretching on his lips.
Harry took a moment to think to himself, what was the most important quality needed in a house? Loyalty.
Laughter could be heard as Harry tried to get up. He starred at the crumbled paper by his feet, far too proud to cry or show any indication that their antics bothered him. The paper moved and was thrown towards the obnoxious little blond girl that followed Dudley around like a puppy, on the back of the head. Since everyone was trying to look away and not be recognized as the culprit they were looking away, pretending to be playing with Legos and trying to muffle their laughter. So the action went unnoticed, but Harry was now very much curious.
“Oui, papa. Est-ce que Adèle et Benoît nous rejoindront ce soir ? Ils me manquent terriblement!” Harry loved it when they spoke French, and because he had been spending so much time with the family since Mrs. Art -- who had married a renowned mythologist, professor, and author named Dorien Katsaros, a Greek brown haired man with a very thick accent and five years her senior. Ever since they got married two years ago, Harry had been visiting them less and less. He understood that they needed time to themselves, being newlyweds and all, which reminded him that he promised to join them to see a play next week on Friday. At least he had that to look forward to.
He was now shaking his head in amusement and patting Harry on the back. “Harry your future will be extraordinary, I promise you that, and with no doubt I can say that you will always come out on top. Me and my family, and even the wizarding world I dare say, will no doubt be blown away by what you can accomplish. And Harry, I cannot wait to see what there is to come!”
“Vernon? Vernon are you okay? Did the freak do something to you?” his aunt stepped into the kitchen and eyed him warily.
They had all gone to Paris two weeks ago to get Sabrina measured for her first set of robes and to tour Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. Sabrina had been so excited that nothing would have been able to wipe the smile that was plastered on her face. She was asking the poor, very
“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather – just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother – why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry instinctively touched his scar.
dress robe, a hat, a pair of gloves and a winter cloak the family was assured the garments will be sent in exactly seven days, two days before the very much anticipated
Harry did not disagree with him and so the hat loudly declared to the patiently waiting audience its decision. “... SLYTHERIN!”
Sirens could be heard in the background, almost drowning in the sound of people shouting for loved ones and kids – as well as a few adults – crying.
“Now, now Mon lutin, stop being difficult and let me see if you’re okay. You were up two meters from the ground!” Benoit had a teasing smile, clearly loving making Harry miserable.
“Okay well make sure to get your jacket and I’ll get your books so we can hop in the car!” She exclaimed as she carried the stack of books that she had bought him towards the door and opened it.
“The Beaumont’s accompanied by Harry Potter! Isn’t this just our lucky day! Of course, we’ve heard all about the lot of you, so it's only fair to introduce myself, Mason Twilfitt and my husband and business partner Noah Tattings!” he said as he was gesturing to his husband.
So as he was staring at the angel-faced star statue in his hands, he watched as the little cracks on the face begun to fade and the broken pieces found their way back to their original place one by one. No words needed to be said.
“You'll sleep well; it's very soothing, listening to the lake water lapping against the windows at night.”  One of the older Slytherins had told him.
“Six months until you wear mother nature down.” Her golden eyebrows were now raised in a challenging manner.
“Sorry to interrupt but what is a secret keeper exactly?” Harry had been receiving a ‘magic’ crash course, as Sabrina had put it, for the last couple weeks. Ever since he had asked her to teach him about magic
“I know Samantha,” Harry smiled at her. “But I want to do this on my own. Plus I have that dictionary that you got me for my birthday, and if I have any difficulty with anything I’ll ask you.” As much as Harry wanted her to help him and read the books with him and explain the parts that he was going to have difficulty with, he knew that his little visits with Samantha where not going to last forever and that he had to be independent and learn to survive on his own.
“Sabrina was trying to catch your attention for the last five minutes. Can you answer her before me Einstein here go deaf? Ow!” Conner was now rubbing his arm were Felix had punched him, his now flushed cheeks matched his fiery head.
Sensing the uneasiness and tension still in the air the fifth year Slytherin perfect opened a spot next to himself and mimed for harry to sit next to him, as soon as Harry was seated, Avery loud enough for the whole table to hear, raised a glass and toasted Harry:
“Oui?” Harry responded to her in French. He used every chance he got when they were alone to practice. He realized, after she asked whether her siblings were joining them tonight, he had completely missed anything said after that. “I said, Adele and Benoit won’t be joining us tonight.” A little frown crossed her lips. He knew how much she loved her siblings and she loved it even more when they used the Floo Network and appeared in the fireplace with green smoke surrounding them. When Harry had asked if everyone used this mode of transportation he was introduced to the rules and regulations surrounding this and apparition. Apparently one could use the Floo Network only in the wizarding world, unless approved by the Ministry of Magic. The Beaumonts being one of the oldest and a pure blood family had numerous networks in the muggle world which they used to run their business more smoothly, rather than wasting time on a plane. Being from an important family really did make all the difference in the wizarding world.
“Oh god! Harry, are you okay? Are you hurt?” Mrs. Art, one of the teachers, rushed towards him interrupting his musings and looking him over several times to make sure he was alright. “What happened sweetheart?” Her American accent always comforted him, in a weird way he liked the distinction between the British and American accents. He knew it was not logical, but for reasons which obviously the Dursleys were to blame for - he trusted the accent more as if she was not part of the reality he was living in.
the possibilities were endless! He could finally live like a normal child and be treated properly…well maybe not, just conditioning the Dursleys to ignore him would properly be better, for both their sake’s.
“Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember ... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter ... After all, He Who Must Not Be Named did great things – terrible, yes, but great.” Harry shivered. Laurent now had a protective hand on his shoulder, a nonverbal promise of protection. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. They paid seven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.
As minutes? Hours? Days? Begun to pass he felt less and less connected to the things that made him and yet he had never felt more connected to them at the same time.
The Dungeons had the feel of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck, but was still quite cozy. The dormitories had ancient four-posters with green and silk hangings and bedspreads embroidered with silver thread. Medieval tapestries depicting the adventures of famous Slytherins hung from the walls. Beautiful dancing lights spilling from silver lanterns floating beneath the ceilings.

“I know we all know this but just to be safe” Laurent’s gaze swept across Sabrina and lingered on Harry. “toss a handful of floo Powder into the fireplace, walk into the green fire, and declare the desired destination
The next day Sabrina woke Harry up at 7 AM sharp by jumping dangerously close to his face and possibly breaking his nose, which then proceeded to dismiss any protest from Harry defending her physical prowess. ‘I’m practically a cat’ a sentence that was declared at some time during her sleepy jumbled speech. After she successfully dragged him out of bed and down the grand stairs and into the kitchen he saw she had half-assembled a colourful foam board with cutouts of Felix, Conner, Brooke, and a couple of their other friend's pictures glued to the top with various stickers and feathers adorning them.
elderly guide so many questions that the poor woman basically bolted out of the room like a mad ostrich as soon as they had reached the end of the tour.
As soon as he lifted his magic from the Dursleys and freed them, Vernon got to his feet but Harry was faster. He started to shake the table next to them and knocked down a couple frames from the wall. That seemed to shut him up and the next hour was in a similar fashion. By the end it seemed that Harry had indeed conditioned them with his magic; and as he had read, fear was a strong motivator. To be honest he didn’t really enjoy it. He would have rather them have done this willingly, but that was not a viable choice. He had no other options.
? Plus, Beauxbatons looked beautiful, he knew enough French to get by… most importantly he would be with Sabrina. Harry would never admit this to anyone, even took him a while to admit it to himself but he has started to depend on her and her family emotionally. He hated it, but not really. It’s very complicated.
, of all places, he could not have believed his luck! Without them, he would have been truly blindsided by everything that he would have been introduced to in a year. Apparently at eleven years old every magical… well, ‘human’ magical child was required to go to a magical institution and learn how to control their powers. Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Durmstrang Institute, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were the three top schools -- among others in the US, Japan, Russia, Africa, Brazil -- that sent invitations to its desired students and have them attend their school. And not surprising at all the Beaumont family all attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France.
It wasn’t too long ago that the concept of love was as real to him as dragons, well little did he know that dragons were real, so did as it turns out was love, as real as the dragons which Harry had just read on the paper had attacked a Muggle beach were a family of wizards, on holiday consequently defeated just last month. Before Mrs. Art and the Beaumonts, love was unknown to him. Nobody had loved him, nor had he loved anyone. Then along came Samantha Art. A loving, kind American woman set on teaching and taking care of obnoxious little kids. She had truly saved him. She was the reason he knew how to love the Beaumonts and become part of their family. He owed it all to Samantha.
The ride with Laurent was filled with laughter and jokes as always. He treated the kids to burgers and shakes and drove Felix and Conner to their houses. “Harry! My boy, I assume you will be joining us back at the mansion?” Laurent asked Harry but before he could respond Sabrina beat him to it.
“Thank you Harry!” Felix’s mum shouted from the kitchen, carrying a big bowl with oven mittens and glaring at her own son “Felix! Get off your bum and help Harry!” she shouted as she begun stirring her bowl.
He had suspected that she used to be a bully’s object of affection when she was younger and that was why she helped him get even with Dudley.
Though that song really struck a chord with Harry. On some level he could connect with the song and feel the singer’s pain. As if she and he had become one person.
- sometimes she let herself forget. After all how is it possible that the most mature and non-judgmental person that she had met upon coming to England was a four year old kid sitting by his lonesome in the corner of the nursery school and reading a book? She knew there were things Harry was hiding from her, and at first she had made it her mission to find out and to help the child, so he wouldn’t suffer the same faith she had.
“Talent,” Blaise clarified. “You, Draco Malfoy, have talent. And that can give you a life that anyone would envy.”
And so Draco found himself spending the night with Harry for the very first time. Harry was a quiet sleeper. He curled up into a ball and took up as little space as possible. Draco wanted to press his face into Harry’s back and wrap his arms around his waist, but he wasn’t that bold. So instead he settled for listening to Harry’s breathing and when he thought the other man had fallen asleep he risked brushing his feet up against Harry’s legs. He drifted off with that single point of touch as his anchor.
Harry smiled as he considered the prospect but shimmed out of his pants himself. They were both nude now. Harry’s cock was average length though it appeared quite thick. Draco imagined what it would be like to go down on Harry, to have him squirming under Draco’s care - perhaps next time. Merlin, they haven’t even gotten to the main event and Draco was already sure that he definitely wanted to do this again.
The only time Draco wasn’t working on classwork was during his work-study. As a first-year he was assigned a few menial tasks outside of class hours, reorganizing books in the library, dusting classrooms, running small errands for professors. There were five other work-study students, though they didn’t interact much with one another, preferring to complete their tasks and go back to their friends.
At the end of summer Thomas gave Draco a tearful hug and promised to come back next year. He knew Thomas had no control over the matter but couldn’t help but hope it was true all the same.
Bulgaria and Great Britain were slotted in two different groups which meant that Draco would be facing Krum in the knockout stage once more. The other seeker was just as ruthless as ever but Draco had been studying Krum’s most recent games and Draco was faster. It wasn’t much in terms of an edge but it was something. Draco was at the top of his game. If he could keep the match from stretching out too long, like it had in Barcelona, Draco might have an actual shot.
“This is Blaise,” she gestured to the man at her left and Draco turned to look at her companion for the first time. He was beautiful enough to be a model, with chiselled features and dark, satin skin.
It was a motley crew to be sure. Draco knew that sometimes the other kids got together to play games or listen to music together. One of the older kids had tried to invite him early in the summer, but Draco had declined. He did not receive another invite, which suited him just fine.
As Draco rushed to grab the rest of his things he caught sight of his reflection in the mirror. Pathetic. Eighteen years old and already a has-been. He was completely alone in the world and always would be. He had wanted to defy his father, make him regret abandoning Draco, but the truth was his father hadn’t spared him a single thought in almost a decade. So what was the point? What was the fucking point of it all?
After Draco said his goodbyes, Raynham apparated them to the railway station in Tracy-sur-Loir. Draco stared out the window the entire three-hour trip, face pressed up against the glass. He tried to read one of the books he had brought along, but he couldn’t concentrate. When he reached Lyon a man met him on the platform, and introduced himself as Mr Barker.
Draco had got rid of all his pills the night he had slept with Potter. All of his pills except for the small pack he kept in his travel kit. He chased the pills down with a bottle of vodka from the minibar and quickly got dressed. He paused at the door and cast a cleaning charm that he hoped would hide the worst of his hangover.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Draco.” Professor Dubois smiled. “Since you’re here, would you mind helping me set up for the lesson?”
“First rule, as long as you’re training with me no booze, no drugs. Not even a glass of wine at the end of the day.”
“April’s not coming,” Draco spoke softly. “She sent me to tell you she would have to reschedule for tomorrow.”
He determined quickly that his teammates were just like his “friends” from school, that is to say boring, unoriginal, and dull. Draco didn’t bother wasting his time beyond basic pleasantries. He was the reason they were winning and that was more than enough to make him popular. He even gained a few fans. They screamed his name from the stands and begged him for autographs.
The words set him free and Draco went straight to his rooms. It was approaching dinner time but Draco didn’t care. He slammed his bedroom door shut and let his rage overtake him. He tore books off the shelves, swept the contents of his desk to the floor, threw his toys across the room, and ripped the sheets off his bed. At the end of it all, he collapsed into a heap on the floor and screamed into his pillow.
“Here.” She pulled out her wand but stopped herself before raising it to his face. “May I?” she asked politely.
“They say you’re the real deal. A prodigy on a broom. Can you tell the readers of the Prophet how it feels?”
Draco popped open the tin, inside was a handful of little orange pills. He eyed Vanessa sceptically. “So what, I just swallow one of these each morning and all my work just magically gets done?”
He looked fierce even if he felt completely wrecked. Taking one last look in the mirror, he slid his mask into place and stepped out into the dark. Draco spent the night partying with strangers before passing out in the early light of morning before waking up and doing it all over again.
Krum was a great technical flyer and Draco had to give it his all the keep up. They were both closing in on the snitch. Draco ran through the plays in his head. He had a chance. He angled his body to prepare for the manoeuvre when suddenly he heard the tell-tale sound of a goal. Russia had scored. If Draco caught the snitch now he would beat Krum but his team would lose. There was no question in his mind. Draco shifted into a new position and recklessly threw himself between Krum and the snitch.
Coach Pharo started talking while Draco was still trying to process how this was his life. “Glad to see everyone made it to the new season in one piece. As you all know we have a couple new faces around here. I want you guys to give a warm welcome to your new seeker, Draco Malfoy, and my new assistant coach, Harry Potter.”
Draco yanked open the door. “Je descends tout de suite,” he said shutting the door again before the hôtelier could respond.
“Excellent.” Blaise smiled and waved the bartender over, ordering Draco an old fashioned. They talked about France and Paris. Blaise told Draco about his favourite places to shop in town and Draco talked about some of the lesser-known gems France had to offer.
Things get really heavy in this chapter and this is where the trigger warning for substance abuse really kicks in. Specifically alcohol and “study drugs”. Please take care of yourselves guys. Everything in moderation, yeah? I did a lot of research writing this fic and reached out to a few primary sources, so hopefully what I portray is accurate. Draco’s behaviour here really spirals out of control quite quickly. Talk to your doctor or a therapist if you are struggling and need some help, that’s their job. I know that not everyone has access to these resources for whatever reason. Unfortunately, we live in an imperfect world and help isn’t always readily available but I have linked some resources in the endnotes for those who might need them.
He was walking through the gardens and trying to come up with a plan when he saw a boy in the year just above him, Asim
Harry kissed Draco’s lower back before following through with the request. Harry scissored him for a bit before curling his fingers back and searching for that magical spot. As Harry’s fingers brushed against his prostate, Draco’s whole body tensed and he let out a gasp.
For the next few hours Draco did nothing except stare into space and listen to his pounding heart. He heard the crack of apparition and Pansy walked into the room.
Harrison (or Cole) laughed. “Disappoint? We’re glad to have you! I know you didn’t pay us much attention when you were with the Tornados.”

Draco spent the summer on a broom. His entire life had been one struggle after another, everything he had he’d fought for, his grades, his popularity, his friend (singular). But flying was easy, effortless, and it was something he was good at. More than once, he realized he had skipped a meal because he was too busy flying or that the sun had already set without him even noticing. The only reason he ever stopped was because the school curfew prevented him from flying at night. Which was just as well, it gave him the time to write to Pansy and stay on top of his studies.
Draco looked at Pansy incredulously. “Why?” After all the time they’ve spent apart, why would she do this for him?
Even after the rejection of first year, Draco had thought he would find friends eventually. He figured after he had proven himself a worthy equal he would find a companion with whom he could share adventures, confide secrets, and conquer the world. But he had done it, he had reached the top, or very near to it, and still he was alone. He was probably going to be alone forever. He drank some more of the wine to distract him from those thoughts. He could still hear the sounds of laughter and merriment in the distance. Draco thought he might cry but he only felt hollow and numb, so he sat there alone in the woods drinking from his stolen bottle and contemplating the nature of his existence.
