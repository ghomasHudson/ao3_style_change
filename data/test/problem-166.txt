Draco squeezed his hand gently as they neared a small crowd at the Slytherin table, before letting go. Harry felt the loss immediately, but was mollified when he saw two students run up to Draco. They weren’t first years at all – second or third, from the looks of it. His heart bloomed in his chest as he saw Draco bend down to address the two students face-to-face.
Finally, she spoke again. “In an effort to have everyone graduate within the usual seven years, classes will run on an accelerated basis to cover the work that was missed last year and the work that is required for the current year. For those in fifth and seventh years, your heads of house will be speaking to you about the option of a slower rate of study that would have you stay at Hogwarts over the summer and take your OWLs or NEWTs in the fall instead of at the end of this academic year. You are welcome to take the longer courses or the accelerated option, we will make any accommodations necessary. As well, the eighth years will be available as tutors to students who should need it. Your professors will speak to you more about this in your classes.
“Right,” Harry said. “Are you sure that’ll work?”
“That was…” Pansy trailed off with a grimace.
“You and I have to plan for welcoming the Slytherins this evening,” Pansy said, then. “I was thinking we could after lunch. Draco and Blaise can help us.”
Harry took a moment to glance worriedly at Pansy, but her face was blank. Blaise was looking at her with something like awe in his expression. Draco was, if possible, even paler than normal. Harry couldn’t help but remember being taken to the Manor during their year on the run. Draco had been there, not at school. No doubt Pansy’s words had hurt him.
“I’ll only do it if he starts actually taking care of it,” Pansy said with a sniff. “Hair like Potter’s will ruin my reputation.”
Draco sighed beside him. “Are you nervous for Granger and Weasley to arrive tomorrow?”
Currently, Harry was in the garden with said child, doing push-ups while Teddy giggled in the grass. Andromeda had banned cigarettes from her house as soon as she had found Harry with them and had given him a good stripping down that included phrases like “ghastly muggle inventions” and “horrible for the child’s lungs”. Maybe in the Days Before, Harry would have rebelled and snuck them in anyways. He knew he hadn’t cared much for authority. In the Days After, though, Andromeda was right. It was horrible for Teddy to be around.
She wrinkled her nose at him. “No, my name is Maribel, so that’s what you call me.”
his bed, or his bed at Hogwarts at any rate, and the person shaking him awake definitely wasn’t Andromeda. It was Pansy.
The sorting passed quickly – there were fewer students this year than any other year. Blaise, who had actually been watching the sorting, pointed out that Gryffindor hadn’t even been given a single new student, while somehow Slytherin had half the incoming first years.
They had gone back to the eighth year dorms, after, Draco trailing behind Harry and Pansy. He had been fiddling again with his left forearm, Harry had noticed. But Draco hadn’t seemed to want to address it or acknowledge it, so the group of three spent the walk back acting as though they were all fine. Blaise was there when they got back, and without preamble or discussion they had pulled the mattresses, blankets, and pillows to the floor before the four of them curled up; talking quietly until the early hours of the morning.
Blaise sighed and flicked his foot. “Did you
“This is exhausting,” Pansy groaned from beside Harry. Their first week of classes at Hogwarts was complete, but instead of the weekend being the respite from work they all needed already, Harry was burying himself in lesson plans while Pansy was wading her way through a thick and unfriendly looking Dark Arts book.
“Just sad,” he said in agreement.
McGonagall paused for a moment, and Harry felt the weight of it – it was a pause that held the weight of a war; perhaps the weight of two wars, the weight of the pain endured by everyone who was present here, and everyone who wasn’t present in the world any longer.
Draco continued to look at him expectantly, so Harry sighed and continued speaking. “We fought badly over the summer. About – a lot of things, I guess. But I think we fixed it today, a bit. So really, there’s nothing to worry about. We’re just…sort of friends.”
In the end, I was a pawn for a madman. Forgive me for saying this, but perhaps you both will be able to relate, given how you spent every waking moment with Dumbledore’s biggest weapon (yes, I mean Harry).
Harry exchanged a bemused look with Draco, who pulled him closer to lean against his side. It was strange to think of the bonds that had forged, in the Days Before. In another context, perhaps, it could have been comforting – but how many nightmares did these children have? How many scars, how much fear?
“Pansy is going to be
But Days After Harry was a catastrophic mix of desire, anxiety, and exhaustion.
Before he could say anything else, before he could pull himself back or force himself back into the world, McGonagall was standing at the dais. Draco’s hand had made it’s way to his knee under the table; it grounded him a little bit. He could even feel Ron and Hermione casting him worried looks from their spot with the Gryffindors on the other side of the table. He let out a slow breath as McGonagall began speaking.
He waited until they were outside in the grounds to speak again. “It’s not – it won’t be taught the way Muggle Studies was before. It’s not just about things like electricity, not a way to make muggles look eccentric. It will have a large focus on muggle and magical history, taught in a way that emphasizes reading comprehension and writing skills, especially in first and second year. Then it will focus more on wizard-muggle relations and how to navigate the muggle world. Spending money, technology, using the post, the library, applying to muggle unis – the lot of it. There will be mandatory field trips and everything.”
Dozens of hands were raised – all except for a couple of kids who were muggleborn and really, really didn’t do any extra reading. “Randy,” Harry said, pointing to a Hufflepuff boy at the back with his hand halfway up in the air.
The second, that he would do whatever Draco wanted, whatever he needed, because in the Days After it seemed that there was one thing that was important: Draco Malfoy was inevitable.
. I was horrid to Weasley.”
The class nodded in agreement. “We’re going to learn about some muggle history, too.” He anticipated whispers, and let them have a moment of surprise before hushing them. “We’re going to learn about World War One and World War Two, mostly, and what the role of wizards were during those wars. Now, can you all take out a quill and some parchment for me?”
“There’s no use,” he said after a moment. “In being angry or…whatever. It doens’t help, does it?”
want to share classes with the seventh year Gryffindors all year.
“Every single person in this room lost someone – whether it was a parent, a sibling, or a friend. Every single student in this room lost part of their childhood to He Who Must Not be Named. Many of you,” she nodded towards the Slytherin table as she spoke, “lost your faith in Hogwarts, and the people here who should have protected you.”
“I’ll go, I know where she went,” Harry said with a sigh. Before anyone could protest, he had kissed Draco on the temple and disappeared through the door.
Harry felt himself reel back, physically. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
They were breathing hard, but Draco had hardly paused to recover before Harry felt a mouth on him, licking his cock slowly, tantalizingly. He wrapped his hands in Draco’s hair, knew he was being loud but was hardly sure what noises he was making. There was pressure building in him as Draco began to move faster, licking and sucking and grazing him with teeth that made him squirm. Before he could form a coherent thought, his vision exploded with stars, and his heart with tenderness.
“Didn’t know if you’d want to do this again,” Draco gasped out.
“We weren’t good people, any of us,” she finally said. “Except maybe Nott. And the Greengrasses, they were always wonderful. Tracey Davis was a cow, though. Actually, I probably was, too. Crabbe and Goyle were horrendous. I have it on good authority that Goyle decided not to return because he didn’t want to see what we would do to him after we found out he may have had a little too much fun being the Carrow’s sidekick.”
Draco continued to look at him expectantly, so Harry sighed and continued speaking. “We fought badly over the summer. About – a lot of things, I guess. But I think we fixed it today, a bit. So really, there’s nothing to worry about. We’re just…sort of friends.”
“I know.” He sighed, trying to let some of the tension out of him. It didn’t work. “I’m going to find McGonagall, see if I can floo Andy to see if she’ll come through today. Want to come with me?”
Have you heard of cognitive dissonance? I learned about it this summer. When you’re presented with knowledge that goes against your beliefs, your brain ignores it – literally, unless you can consciously confront it. It’s a muggle idea – as many ideas about the brain are. They call it psychology. I don’t know why wizards have never bothered to study the mind, it seems so important.
“You need to learn to trust it again,” Andromeda said, gently. “Do you remember the first spell you ever did?”
“Easier to think, actually,” Harry added. He pretended to ignore Hermione rolling her eyes. “I don’t have as many reasons to be angry anymore.”
She led them not into her office, but into an unused classroom instead. Harry smiled at Pansy’s confused look. “No portraits of old heads in abandoned classrooms.” He often had his meetings with McGonagall in any room
“I wasn’t always the Dark Lord’s favourite,” Draco gasped out. “I was particularly useless, most of the time.”
“She’s married to Professor Stone,” he said, just as McGonagall cleared her throat over the din.
“I need to…” he said, and paused. What he needed, in all honesty, was to talk to Andromeda and hold Teddy. Niether of those were options.
“Did you go to your appointment at Mungo’s already?” Andy asked. He knew if he looked too closely she’d have that knowing look in her eyes - the kind of look only someone who was the mother of someone like Tonks could get.
And then everything was exploding, straight from his hands, his chest, his head – he didn’t know. The world was electric, like lightning. Someone was screaming – it was him, he realized. He was screaming. And then there was nothing.
“Nonsense,” she said as Madame Pomfrey came bustling in. “We’re all glad you’re alright.”
He couldn’t just leave Teddy. He couldn’t bear to have the small boy out of his sight. Andromeda had already promised up and down that she would attend as many Hogwarts meals with Teddy as possible, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure he’d make it to the hols without having his godson with him everywhere he went. Teddy had Andromeda, he knew, but she wouldn’t be able to take care of him forever. Better if Harry started sooner. Plus, the three of them in Andromeda’s small cottage had begun to feel like family, even moreso than the Weasleys had ever been. It was the first time he wondered how children like Ron and Ginny were ever excited at the prospect of going away to boarding school for the year.
“Who’s your professor for the year?” Pansy asked him, breaking Harry away from his thoughts. The previous day at lunch, Professor McGonagall had asked them to each think at length about where they wanted their future to head, and choose a professor to help guide them. She had explained that they would experience everything from one-on-one mentoring to helping with classes, to extra, more advanced studying. They hadn’t been given much time – they were required to have a foot of parchment written on which professor they’d like to work with and why to be handed in to McGonagall at dinner. At breakfast today, they were to find out what professor they had been assigned and to meet with them at some point throughout the day.
“What about, then?” Harry asked.
The knocking came for a second time before Harry finally made it to the door. It opened to reveal the faces of Ron and Hermione, as Blaise had predicted.
Harry grinned a little bit. “I’m not taking defence,” he said. He watched her mouth form into an ‘o’ of shock.
“She won’t,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter, anyways.”
“Is it just you and Professor McGonagall working on this?” she asked.
“Well, I think this year we’ll talk about some big wizarding history events that happened in the last fifty years. We’ll talk about Grindlewald and Voldemort,” some of the students shuddered at the name, but he chose to ignore it, “and how those wars affected us and the muggles. We’ll also talk about the founding of Hogwarts a little bit. Those are the big things. Some of you will know a lot about these things already,” he cast his gaze across the room, trying to make eye contact with all of his students. All except Mar. “Lots of you won’t. So if you know some stuff already, I want to see you helping the people who don’t, okay?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not mad. Honestly!” He added at her disbelieving look. “I did think…maybe it wasn’t as fun as you were letting on. But Andy told me I had to let you heal in your own way. I guess she was right.”
“People who are being right pricks?” She asked.
I maaay have stolen some visuals from the movie (as opposed to the books) for part of this chapter. Please don’t hate me, it was more dramatic. Some frank discussions of war and PTSD-like symptoms although the phrase is never used, just as a trigger warning!
teaching first year history – two double periods per week, each a mixture of all the houses that had students – but he had wanted to keep it quiet until classes were underway.
“I’m going to pretend that made any sense,” Pansy responded. “Blaise has gone off to the kitchens. We’re supposed to meet him there in about…” she trailed off to glance at her wrist, as if she was wearing a watch. She wasn’t. “Now, but you’re bloody hard to wake up.”
“Still,” Smith blustered. Harry felt Zabini, Pansy, and Draco shift around him. At first he thought they were trying to extract themselves from the situation, but he realized they had closed ranks behind him to mirror the stance of the other four – had closed ranks to protect him. “You don’t have to
By the time class was due to start and all the students were settled, Professor Binns was still nowhere in sight. Feeling nervous, but deciding he may as well give it a shot, he cleared his throat to start class.
“That’s what I thought,” Blaise said savagely.
Harry could see, now, the leader Neville had become in the past year – the leader he had needed to become. Harry had thought his heart had been broken before now; broken to never be mended, that he could not possibly feel it break any more than it had, but it did. It broke a little more for Neville and the DA and all the children that had been left to their own devices at Hogwarts under the rule of Alecto and Amycus Carrow.
“You will also become familiar with some of the eighth years as your House Guardians (??). You will meet them tonight in your common rooms, and in just a few moments they will also be responsible for showing the first years the way to their dormitories. You are expected to treat the House Guardians as prefects; they are able to award and remove points, even from Prefects.”
He let Draco kiss his shoulder while he tapped his head, the feeling of cold water running down him countered by Draco’s warm body and warm kiss made Harry shudder. In that moment, he knew two different things to be true.
“Come here,” he said to Draco as soon as she left, surprised at how huskily his voice came out.
. She got tortured in my
I’ve started this letter too many times and I have potions work to do, so I’m not going to start over anymore.
“I’ve already given them space,” Harry grumbled again, but nodded nonetheless.
one last lil bit of fluff before the plot picks up and harry isn't allowed to be happy anymore (kidding! or am i...)
His question was vague, but Malfoy seemed to understand. He gestured for Harry’s cigarette, and spoke only after taking a deep drag and handing it back.
when it’s an unpopular one.”
“She’s not going to keep that secret,” Blaise muttered to Harry. Harry found himself laughing, a rare occurrence.
“The word she used, the one that you didn’t know,” Harry said.
“Yeah,” Harry choked out, resisting the urge to thrust his hips in Draco’s face. As if reading his mind, Draco let out a low chuckle. Then, his lips were on Harry’s prick, and all sense of time or thought or language left Harry’s mind altogether.
“The look that tells me I should start insulting you before you get a big head,” Draco said with a grin. He leaned in, and Harry found his laugh captured in Draco’s lips.
“There are solutions in a lot of other countries,” Pansy finally said. “Wizarding Britain is – I mean, very focussed on blood purity, of course, but classist too. The sacred twenty-eight has the resources and influence but they won’t use it to help half-bloods or poor pure-bloods. It’s something you’re taught not to question. Until you do question it, I suppose.”
“You want to study?” Hermione asked, gasping mockingly. “Who are you and what have you done with Harry?”
“I thought we could go to our dormitory?” Harry said quietly towards Zabini, who nodded. Draco saw Harry motion towards the two Gryffindors to follow them, Blaise and Pansy leading the way.
Draco sighed inwardly. “I don’t know,” he answered honestly. “I don’t think so.”
. It took him a moment of haziness to realize that it
!” and the screaming was his not his friends, and he was in his bed, but not
“The word she used, the one that you didn’t know,” Harry said.
The people who chose to do the hurting, Harry reflected, did not have sleepless nights. They were haunted, just as haunted as the rest of them. Perhaps in the Days Before, he wouldn’t have understood, would have thought himself better for the choices he made. Except that he hadn’t made choices, not really. People had made choices for him – Dumbledore, Voldemort, the prophecy.
“That’s not true!” Hermione began, fiercely.
It was clearly not the type of evening where any work was getting done, though. They curled up on the couch in front of the fire, Draco with his head in Harry’s lap and legs across Pansy and Blaise, the latter seated with his back to the armrest of the couch so he could face everyone, talking aimlessly amongst themselves.
Harry felt himself smile back. “I wouldn’t put it past them.”
“Thank you,” said McGonagall, startling him out of his reverie. He had forgotten, for a moment, that it was supposed to be a moment of silence. Had assumed the world had dampened in his mind, as it often did. She said something else that he didn’t catch, but the hall began bustling again as the first years were led in by Professor Vector.
“I know what you’re thinking – that you would have done the same as Neville. I’m saying it wouldn’t matter. Nothing mattered, that year. The war might have been won, but we all lost. You’d care now; I’d care now. That’s what’s important.”
“Maybe you’ll get to help Potter catch up,” Draco drawled from beside him.
“Its good to see you taking your House Guardian duties so seriously,” she said with a bemused sort of smile at the four of them.
“Tell me about your nightmare,” Draco said, and Harry found himself complying as Draco’s hands moved again – across his chest, through his hair, under his chin.
This silence was less oppressive than when McGonagall was speaking. Harry felt himself come back to slowly. He was holding Pansy’s hand, he realized. She was dry-eyed, but looked suddenly exhausted, as if the world were too much. Draco’s hand was still on his knee –the other boy was looking straight down at his plate. Harry leaned into him cautiously, feeling gratified when Draco leaned back. He couldn’t see Blaise, on Draco’s other side, except for the arm that extended around Draco’s shoulder.
He watched, enraptured, as Draco removed his hands from Harry, reached towards the buttons of his own shirt. He undid them slowly, eyes dark, focused on Harry completely. Harry felt his cock straining against his jeans. He arched, but Draco shifted back onto his thighs so his hips met no resistance, the want making him ache.
He paused, breathing heavily, keeping his hands to himself before dropping them and letting them trail along the scars on Draco’s torso.
Harry turned an amused look downward to where Draco was lying. “I do?” he asked pointedly. Draco merely smiled innocently at him.
Draco spun him around and kissed him soundly. Maybe it was partly the water or the way Draco was touching him but Harry felt like he was drowning in the best possible way. It was all he could do to lean against the cool tiles and kiss Draco back.
She nodded once, as if he had passed some sort of test. “You’d best be careful,” she said, “Or you’ll make yourself a politician.”
“Sometimes I am,” she said finally. “But no, not right now. Sometimes I think I never will be, you know?”
“Okay?” Draco asked after a moment.
“Before the First Years enter for their sorting, I would like everyone to observe a moment of silence in remembrance of the lives that were lost here and around Britain last year, muggle and magical alike.” The Headmistress’ voice was hard, as if daring anyone to argue. No one did, though. Everyone was silent, even the Slytherins.
“You’re not alright, Mr Potter, no,” Madame Pomfrey said from beside Professor McGonagall. “I’ve never seen such a large magical core depletion in all my time as a healer. It’s a wonder we didn’t have to send you to Saint Mungo’s – not to mention I’m shocked that you’re already awake.”
about fish, but Mar was looking at him so expectantly that he felt like he needed to say something. It was the right decision – as soon as he said it, her whole face lit up with excitement.
Well, that explained it. “Can I still teach?” Harry asked. He turned to look imploringly at McGonagall.
When the Healer proceeded with the same examination the mediwtch had, humming and hawing and finally asking to speak to Madame Pomfrey in a separate room, though, that was when Harry lost it. It was possibly the first time he had felt angry since….well, since the Days Before, probably.
, did you?” she shrieked.
Harry rolled his eyes, Draco saw it in his peripheral vision, but he refused to acknowledge it. Pansy was also rolling her eyes. All his friends were traitors.
“Mandatory even for muggleborn students?” Hermione asked immediately. Harry sighed to himself, nodded at her.
thank you for the comments and kudos. i will respond as soon as I have the time <3
I promise things will resolve eventually between the Golden Trio and Slytherin Trio, but it can't happen right away. I'm very consciously aware that JKR wrote about blood purity as a shitty metaphor for racism, but I think because of that it's really important to address the learning curve of the characters as they confront their own ideas about blood purity and learn how to be inclusive. that won't happen overnight, and neither will characters accept overnight that the slytherin's have changed. confronting internal biases and growing from that is a huge, huge process, and i think it's important to properly recognize and portray that!!
“Didn’t McGonagall say the new potions professor was willing to unofficially take you on?” Blaise asked, grabbing Draco’s timetable out of his hands. “That’s not even on your timetable yet, I’m sure some of those slots will fill.”
This was the aftermath, he realized, of a group of children left to fend for themselves. This was the aftermath of having only the older Slytherins left to protect them. The aftermath of the people who were supposed to protect them leaving them to fend for themselves. Harry was sure there was more than just this, too – more than the visible results of experiencing a war in their own school. There would be nightmares and panic, walking through the halls and seeing the ghosts of their friends – the Slytherin students would experience it just as severely as any other students.
Sure enough, when he arrived at the History of Magic classroom, there was already a gaggle of first years waiting outside. He let them in, trying not to sigh too loudly. He was excited, sure, and yes, they were eager and adorable, but if he had to go through a year of hero worship from all the students he was teaching, he wasn’t really sure how he’d manage.
Harry was uncomfortable thinking about how Ron and Hermione would fit into this dynamic when they returned. Would they join him, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco for their walks around the castle? Shuffle themsevles into their group to make sure no one went anywhere alone? He hadn’t told them anything about Draco, had been scared to. Would they fall in, instead, with Zacharias Smith? No, definitely not that, but perhaps with Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Nott. In the Days Before, he would have been sure of where they stood. In the Days After, he wasn’t quite sure about very many things anymore.
Draco’s breath was hot on his neck as he spoke and Harry felt himself get impossibly harder. “No exertion,” he said. “All you need to do is stand there and look pretty, love.”
“Can I talk to you, mate?” Neville said. He had leaned in and dropped his voice, presumably so the other three couldn’t hear him. This, Harry thought, was honestly a bit paranoid.
survive.
“She’s not,” Draco said suddenly. It seemed like the whole eighth year table had leaned towards him to hear what he had to say around the buzz of the dining hall. They were all avoiding looking at the four of them, though. Harry couldn’t help but smirk when Draco lowered his voice so only he, Pansy, and Blaise could hear him talking.
“And even when you
Harry let his eyes wander around the room – belatedly realizing that Andromeda was supposed to be here with Teddy. He felt panic clutch his chest, briefly, when he didn’t seem them immediately. He had been late to the start of the Feast, albeit only slightly – what if they had decided not to come and he hadn’t even noticed. Draco must have realized his panic, because he squeezed Harry’s knee and nodded towards the staff table. Sure enough, Andy was seated near the end, beside Professor Sinstra, with baby Teddy in her arms.
I AM SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG TO POST!!! but i'm back, hopefully with a backlog of chapters and a plot this time. <3
“So…how was everyone’s summer?” Granger finally asked in such a false cheerful tone it made Draco cringe.
Harry kissed him then, softly. “I would have been angry,” Harry said.
He looked up to find Draco and Blaise sitting at a small table, looking at him in astonishment. A house elf appeared beside the table, snapping into existence two more chairs and place settings, before bustling away as quickly as it had appeared.
“Okay,” Harry replied cautiously. “Who’s going to cut it, then?”
anyways enjoy!
It made me realize, though, that for some people it was not about blood status or birth. It was simply about causing harm. How could I be part of that kind of a cause? It was the start, you could say, the start of the end. I feel as though I must reiterate, though, that I don’t believe this excuses me. I was guilty. I am guilty. I deserve consequences,
She led them not into her office, but into an unused classroom instead. Harry smiled at Pansy’s confused look. “No portraits of old heads in abandoned classrooms,” Harry murmured to her quietly. He often had his meetings with McGonagall in any room
The people who chose to do the huritng, Harry reflected, did not have sleepless nights. They were haunted, just as haunted as the rest of them. Perhaps in the Days Before, he wouldn’t have understood, would have thought himself better for the choices he made. Except that he hadn’t made choices, not really. People had made choices for him – Dumbledore, Voldemort, the prophecy.
“Mary, she’s a
“Well, Mr Potter,” she said, seating herself in a conjured chair beside his bed as if he hadn’t said anything, “I had hoped the Hospital Wing would be seeing less of you, this year.”
“Alright?” Draco came into the room and sat delicately beside him on the couch. Andromeda followed behind him and deposited herself into the armchair by the fire, which she lit with a lazy wave of her wand.
“I know,” he whispered back. “I’m sorry.”
Harry barely had time to slide his hands in Draco’s hair before he pulled away, breathing hard. Harry tried to follow, searching Draco’s lips out with his own, but Draco stepped back.
“And on that note,” McGonagall said, smiling warmly down at all the students. Harry felt almost eleven years old again. “Please make your way to your common rooms. First years, your House Guardians will meet you at your table and guide you to your Common Room.”
Harry grinned a little bit. “I’m not taking defence,” he said. He watched her mouth form into an ‘o’ of shock.
Pansy had finally made the decision for them all, declaring they would walk Harry to the Great Hall so he could eat with his friends while they waited in the eighth year common room for the end of breakfast. And this was how he had ended up curled up on the sofa before the fire, feet in Blaise’s lap and head in Pansy’s, feeling as though he was going to be sick.
“To brood,” Draco responded, his mouth quirking up.
Harry woke, hours later, groggy, confused, and mildly panicky when he realized Draco wasn’t in the bed. He only had a few seconds to panic, however, before Draco came out of the bathroom, hair damp but freshly dressed. When he saw Harry was awake, he grinned.
When Madame Pomfrey gestured him towards the Floo in the foyer of Saint Mungos, he didn’t hesitate. Except it wasn’t Hogwarts he called for when he stepped in. He was only dimly aware of his words calling “Tonks Cottage” and Madame Pomfrey’s exasperated look before he spun away.
Across from where they were standing were two hallways. A crowd was clustered against the wall between the hallways. Harry assumed that was where the list of room assignments. He couldn’t find it in himself to care who he ended up with, particularly.
Harry dropped back on his pillows. Sunday evening. He had missed so much – his meetings with Binns and McGonagall, cutting Mar’s hair, lesson plans – everything. “When can I leave?” he asked sullenly.
He let Draco kiss his shoulder while he tapped his head, the feeling of cold water running down him countered by Draco’s warm body and warm kiss made Harry shudder. In that moment, he knew two different things to be true.
to keep it secret. After all, he trusted his three friends implicitly. It was more that it was one good reminder of the Days Before. A connection to his dad, but also a reminder of the fun he had had, Before. And was wasn’t quite ready to give that up, to share it around – not yet.
“Everything, really,” Harry said after a moment’s pause. “I’ve overseen two detentions so far. We’re updating curriculum-” he cut himself off. He wasn’t supposed to tell anyone this, really – except Draco, and by extension Pansy and Blaise. In fact, McGonagall had given him and Draco express permission to tell the other two, seeing as they were always together anyways.
“I saw people who-” he gasped as Draco’s fingers tweaked a nipple, “-who died in the war. They blamed me.” He didn’t specify, didn’t need to, not for Draco to understand. Draco bent to kiss him again,
“No,” Draco ground out. Even after all this time - although it hadn’t really been that long since the war, sometimes it felt like ages – the insinuation that he didn’t enjoy hurting people –
I owe the both of you (and many others) more apologies than I could ever think I’d owe anyone. I will not be offended if you don’t read this letter, if you’d rather throw it away and continue hating me. But I hope you will give me a chance.
“I have a plan for how we should talk to the Slytherins tonight,” she said. She pursed her lips and reached around to whack Draco on the back. Harry couldn’t see what he had been doing, since he was currently leaning against the other boy, but presumably what he wasn’t doing was paying attention to Pansy.
The first, that going back to Draco Malfoy’s rooms was probably a terrible, terrible decision.
“Some of you might know about them already, you’re right,” he said with a nod, “but not all of you. You’re in a unique position Arwen, because you’ve been to non-magic school and now you’re at a magic school. But many people in your class haven’t had the chance to go to a school that isn’t magic, and even if they did you don’t always learn about the same things. And there are some people here, like you, who didn’t know they were magic until they turned eleven, but they haven’t been interested in spending their time reading up on people like Grindlewald.” He let a teasing note enter his voice, “Believe it or not, there are some things that are more pleasant to read about.”
Lost in thought as he was, he hadn’t realized that Draco had stopped walking until he was a step ahead. Harry turned around to look back and Draco was kissing him. His lips were on Harry’s, hard and almost unyielding, teeth biting at his lips, hands slipped under his shirt.
“Your attention, please!” He jumped and winced as McGonagall clapped her hands to bring the gorup to attention. He wasn’t the only one, either. Draco’s hand that had been brushing his arm suddenly gripped his wrist hard.
“Welcome, and welcome back to Hogwarts,” she began. “I have a few brief announcements before I can let you go for the evening.” She smiled down at the eighth year table for a moment. “You’ll notice a new set up in the Dining Hall, the table at the front is here to house the school’s eighth year students, who have come back to complete their schooling. You will see many of them in your classes, working to assist your teachers and provide extra help.
It didn’t take long at all before Harry felt his world explode, Draco’s name on his lips. He was dimly aware of Draco finishing after, sticky heat on his stomach before it was wiped clean with a spell. He felt Draco release his arms, and then the world faded.
“I’m not,” he said. “I mean – I
Harry nudged him in the side with his foot.
“As much as I would love to hear about your summer,” the Weasel – Weasley, Draco corrected himself – began, his voice full of hostility, “we should just establish that I don’t like any of you and I don’t trust any of you.” Draco felt Weasley’s eyes rest on him. “You’re a Death Eater,” he spat out. Draco looked up in shock, but Weasley had already turned to Pansy. “You tried to give Harry to Voldemort,” and then to Blaise, “And you’re just a self-righteous pure-blooded twat.”
“Finally, Mr Filch has asked me to remind you that the Forbidden Forest is strictly off limits, and that all students should review the list of banned items posted in his office.”
“Very well,” said the Healer, somehow making it sound as if speaking to Harry was the biggest inconvenience he could fathom. “There is nothing technically wrong with you,” he said to Harry directly. “It seems as though it is all in your mind.”
to be placed there. Now, in the Days After, he simply exchanged a bemused look with Draco. He might be angry if he had to share a room with Zacharias Smith, but nothing could really get him riled up these days.
“I’m okay,” Harry repeated again, helplessly. Angry Draco, he could deal with. Controlling Draco he could handle. Demanding and needy Draco was easy. But scared Draco was something he hadn’t encountered yet. A Draco that expressed his need for comfort through softness instead of angry quips and pushing him away was new and Harry wasn’t exactly sure how to handle it.
They entered the cottage one after the other to the sound of Teddy’s giggles. Harry smiled to himself – this, in the Days After, was the sound of family.
He hadn’t told the Slytherins about the map yet, had wanted to wait until Ron and Hermione were here and had met them. He mostly was hoping that showing them after Ron and Hermione had gotten used to them would make them feel less betrayed that someone else knew the secret of the Map and his Cloak. Now, though, he wasn’t so sure they’d all ever get used to each other.
Neville looked like he was going to be sick, but was the first to speak up. “No problems, Headmisstress. I was just going.”
“We thought you might like to find…Weasley and Granger this morning,” Draco said. Harry could tell it took him effor to keep his tone level.
“Can we stop talking about it and go see it already?” Mar asked abruptly. Her fingers were tapping again, Harry noticed. He should ask McGonagall about that – it seemed a little bit strange.
“Hey,” Harry said. He reached over to grab Draco’s right hand and hold it, feeling a little bit guilty as he did so. “There’s nothing there,” he said. “There hasn’t been anything there in over a year.”
Pansy looked shocked. Harry couldn’t tell if it was because McGonagall had just confirmed that there was indeed a Defence professor hired for the fall term, or because she had just been offered a method of avoiding the rest of those in their year by the Headmistress herself. To her credit, though, Pansy merely nodded in acknowledgement.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked. He tried not to sound angry, not to sound threatening. He was so tired, so exhausted already – the world was greying around the edges of his vision.
McGonagall gave them all a terse smile. “I have your papers here. I realize you had an early breakfast,” she continued, ingoring their shocked looks, “so I think early papers are in order.” She passed a piece of parchment to each of them. “Potter, I will see you in an hour, and you right after, Mr Malfoy. Ms Parkinson, I’ve arranged a floo call with your Professor since she will not be arriving at Hogwarts until the first day of term. All the students who chose Defence will be meeting outside my office three hours from now, when I am done speaking with Mr Malfoy. If you’d like to go first, I recommend you arrive with him.”
Mar started to nod, but another girl – Jessamine, gave him a doleful look. “It’s raining,” she said glumly. Harry tried not to sigh – at least not too aggressively.
“I didn’t save anyone, either,” Draco sighed.
Harry tried not to think of his nightmare, but the more he tried the more it rose to the forefront of his mind. At this point in his life, he was used to nightmares; to waking up shaking and in terror. They had been especially terrible directly following the war and again his first couple nights at Hogwarts, but the previous nights’ had been his worst yet.
“Oi,” Harry said, although it was mostly false indignance. He was fairly certain he’d be rather useless, at least at first. Even if the Sorting Hat had almost put him in Slytherin, that didn’t mean he knew how to
“You can start being a good influence on Ron, then,” she said, putting her arm around his waist to guide him out. “Imagine the kind of marks you can get now that you’re applying yourself.”
He was going to say something cheeky about being the Chosen One or maybe about how Draco was really the one with the big head, or something embarrassing, like
He was gratified to hear Zabini snort in response, although the other man didn’t look at him or acknowledge him in any other way. Harry didn’t exactly know why he was trying to make friends with them, even Draco had given him a bemused, although not ungrateful, look.
Blaise made a noise of protest while Draco, who was halfway to his feet, glared at her. “Look,” Pansy sighed, “Draco can’t get involved – sorry love,” she added direclty to Draco. “It will look bad. And dinner is soon, he can’t go down there alone, and Potter can’t go up to the Headmisstress’s office by himself. It’s asking for trouble. So Potter and I will go bond over arguing with McGonagall, and you two can do whatever you’d like, and we’ll meet you in the Great Hall.”
They turned to their work, then, and Harry put his head back down on the table with a thump. He felt Draco’s hand on his knee, and leaned into the touch before forcing his head back up and taking out a piece of parchment.
hurting people?”
“That’s awfully poetic, Potter,” Pansy said in response. She sniffed and looked away, as if in indifference, but Harry was fairly sure he could see a tear escape one of her eyes.
“On the first if all goes well,” Harry responded. “The memory charm is reversed, but she wants to take her parents to St Mungos to make sure everything is fine.”
With a frustrated groan, Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s hips, pulling the other boy against him. Draco let out a keening noise. “So it’s like that, is it, Potter?” he asked breathlessly between kisses. Harry felt himself grow hard, angled his hips upward towards Draco, shuddered at the pressure.
The problem was, he didn’t realize he was angry. Not until Madame Pomfrey gave him a startled look and he realized he had clenched his hands so hard in the sheets of the hospital bed that he had set them on fire.
They didn’t work for very long. Harry could barely keep his eyes open after a couple hours of writing, but with Draco’s help he managed to finish his transfiguration essay and his muggle studies reflection. The rest of the group was planning on working through dinner, but Draco essentially dragged Harry out of the room, demanding they go rest.
“Fine,” groused Draco as he sat back down on the bed. Harry looked at him in concern, he was picking at his sleeve on his left arm – right where the Dark Mark sat on his skin.
The conditions of my parole are to stay within the grounds of Hogwarts and refrain from use of magic outside of class, other than small wandless spells. And to help rebuild, of course. As it turns out, I did not do much of the rebuilding part.
Harry couldn’t find it in himself to laugh, or push to the front the way he would have done in the Days Before. He didn’t understand, not really, how they could be cheerful, being back at Hogwarts. Every step, every turn he made, walking as a living person in a place where so many had died, felt like a slap to the face.
. Perhaps, he thought, the most terrifying part of his nightmare had been how willingly he had crossed the veil. He hadn’t tried, hadn’t lifted a finger, really, to help his friends. Even if it was just a dream – it made him feel like he was capable of just…not caring. And there was guilt, too. His nightmare had reflected so clearly his deepest wish in the Days After, the wish that he had just stayed dead. That he had gone on. That for once, he had done something selfish for himself. Instead of facing a hostile castle, angry friends, he could be with his dad, Sirius, Remus…
The four ostensibly avoided the eighth year common room, choosing to spend most of their time instead in Draco’s rooms, abandoned classrooms, or on the grounds instead. They never went anywhere alone, either. Smith had quited down, but they often found people lurking around the common room and varios corridors at all hours of the day and night. Harry was also quite sure they had people tailing Draco and Pansy, at least, but the others had told him he was being paranoid when he brought it up.
when it’s an unpopular one.”
Harry felt Draco nudge him. The other boy raised his eyebrows when Harry looked over, as if to say
“I have my own,” said Draco with a shrug. Harry could see the lines of tension in his body, though, and clearly Pansy could, too. She put a calming hand on his arm. Harry tried to ignore the flare of jealousy in his stomach as Draco leaned into her touch.
“What if,” he said finally, meeting Andy’s eyes for the first time. “What if I wasn’t supposed to come back? What if it…threw off some sort of balance? Like in the Tale of the Three Brothers. They couldn’t escape Death forever. You can’t run from it. What if…what if this is my way of dying again? Restoring balance?”
Still, the period passed quickly. History of Magic, after it, was horrifyingly slow – although Harry was almost used to Binns’ drone at this point, and even managed to take some notes. Hermione was sitting across the room, but he could feel her glancing over often, as if shocked that he was actually paying attention. Especially compared to Ron, he figured, who was napping beside her.
He missed her more than he had thought he would, for someone who had only been in his life for a short time. He felt his eyes glisten slightly and winced to himself. In the Days Before, he would have been angry. In the Days After, he was apparently just a sap.
They didn’t have to wear uniforms yet, since they were the only students in the school, so Harry pulled on a soft sweater and some jeans. He ran a quick hand through his hair before giving up on attempting to neaten it altogether. He was pulling a quill and some parchment out of his trunk, with half his mind set on writing Andromeda a letter over breakfast, just as Pansy stepped back in.
“Better than what, Potter?” Draco growled. “Better than getting to go places? Or see your friends? Better than being the world’s saviour?”
Harry gave Draco a look. “Some of us can’t even do magic,” he griped. Draco just rolled his eyes back at Harry.
last night!” The voice came from behind him – loud enough to make him jump and spill coffee down the front of his robes. Blaise gave him an exasperated look from his other side and waved his wand, cleaning up the mess.
“Pomfrey does, I think,” he said instead of answering her other question. At a raised eyebrow from her, though, he continued on. “I just…needed a break. For a minute.” He took a sip of his tea.
Professor McGonagall called
“Not over the summer?” Draco asked – and in that moment he looked so vulnerable that Harry just wanted to hold him, although he guessed that that approach wouldn’t be particularly well-received.
She gave Harry a soft smile. “I don’t know what happened, really. You probably don’t remember him in third year, but he was tiny, like he was starved. He was angry, at first. People were picking on him, but he was picking fights with everyone he could. I guess he spent Christmas with his mum, because when he came back he wouldn’t even talk to any of us. Draco used to say he’d get to their dormitory after lights out every night, and leave before everyone woke. We think Snape let him do whatever he wanted, so long as he slept at some point. Spent a lot of time with Ravenclaws in the year above. We were all horrid to him about it, of course.
Ginny gave him a small smile. “They’ve been through a lot, you know. Not that we all haven’t,” she added at his look. “But when they left for Australia so quickly it made me think that they weren’t able to confront their grief. They couldn’t stay here and handle it. So we,” she gestured broadly around the classroom, “Have been confronting our demons all summer. Trying to make sense of everything. They haven’t.”
“Let me disillusion you,” Draco whisphered into his ear. He had clearly follwed Harry up and was now pressed behind him, bare chest to bare back. Harry shuddered and nodded.
“When will they realize, though?” Harry asked. “Anyone dangerous is in Azkaban. The rest are serving house arrest sentences, like Draco and his mum. These laws won’t do anything but control family and friends of Death Eaters that had nothing to do with the war.”
“I’m sure this is exactly what she had in mind when she said that,” Draco said in response. But he ducked his head down, as if supressing a laugh. “Don’t worry,” he continued, “I plan on doing all the work today.”
tw for a homophobic slur in this chapter
This, of course, only caused Harry to blush harder, while Pansy snickered downright evilly.
Pansy scoffed loudly. “Forgive me if I don’t believe in your definition of suitable.” Harry stepped slightly closer to Pansy, a quiet show of support. He didn’t want to speak, didn’t entirely fell it was his place and was sure that Pansy would not appreciate it if he did. But he did want Professor McGonagall to know that he agreed with Pansy implicitly.
Ron, I deeply apologize for making you my target as well. Not only was I horrid, but classist and rude. In simple truth, you are not worth less for the quality of your clothing or the number of siblings you have (I can admit this was a sore point for me. I always wanted a sibling growing up). I had no reason to attack you except that it made me feel powerful, which is utterly wrong and inappropriate. I have no desire to do this to people anymore – not to mention no desire to act as my father did toward your father anymore. If you are amenable, I would be more than happy to see no more negativity between the Weasley and Malfoy families. Of course, this is a lot to ask if you have even read this for, but please know that I will never again treat another the way I have treated you.
Harry shifted in his seat as the Professor Vector called out the name of the first student, opting to lean more heavily against Draco. Pansy was leaning over him, cooing over Teddy as if there wasn’t even a sorting going on at all. And to be fair to her – Harry wasn’t interested, particularly, in the sorting. Another year, more students divided into houses, more rivalries formed – the same as it always was. No, he was much more content to sit here, bent over his godson instead, leaning against his – well, not
He leaned in toward Draco, who shot him a small undecipherable look before putting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Blaise mimed gagging, but Pansy shushed him.
The next time he woke it was darker in his room. His head hurt less – his whole body hurt less, really. He shifted into a sitting position, looking around for his glasses once again.
But those were the Days Before, and this was now. He had changed, in the Days After. He hoped that the others, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, would be able to change, too. Hoped that they all would do better.
Draco sat up as Potter approached the group of three, not bothering to hide his smile as he left his friends behind him. “I’m going to pretened I never heard that,” he said with an amused glance at Pansy. She shrugged unabashedly, and Draco felt a strange surge of warmth for them both.
“Now, have I assumed correctly that you are here to speak with me and not taking a casual stroll around the castle? If I’m wrong, by all means,” she gestured to the corridor behind her. Harry had to stifle his laugh at Pansy’s confused look.
“I believe Mr Potter would like to be included in any discussion,” Madame Pomfrey said to the Healer, lazily waving her wand in an arc to douse the flame as if it were an everyday occurrence. Then again, maybe it was for her. Harry was quite sure he didn’t know the half of what went on in the Hospital Wing.
When he entered the kitchen, he mostly expected it to be empty. But it wasn’t - he noticed the telltale sniffs of someone crying, first, before his eyes even registered who it was.
“No?” Harry asked in surprise. Looking closer, of course, he noticed that some of them looked newer than the others, still pink and puckered under his hands. He leaned down to look closer, trail the paths they made with his fingers, felt Draco shudder under him.
,” McGonagall said in a clear voice. Draco stiffened beside him at her words and Zabini shifted on his other side. Harry had no idea what they meant, but
“Erm…” Harry was mostly at a loss for words.
Harry rolled his eyes, his hand bumping Draco’s as he passed him the cigarette. “I could visit,” he said quietly. When Draco raised his eyebrows, Harry repeated himself.
“I don’t even want to know how you know that,” Draco’s voice said in his ear. Harry shuddered at the proximity but shrugged in response. Honestly, he only knew from Ron’s complaints about how Hermione was while they were staying with her parents in Australia, but he was not about to say so. He felt suddenly very weary.
For Draco, McGonagall had pulled some strings, it seemed, and under the guise of being supervised for “disciplinary measures” required by the ministry, she had put him in a Potions placement with the new Potions professor, who Harry hadn’t met yet and Draco was being stubbornly tight-lipped about, which he was enjoying immensely.
“I have a plan for how we should talk to the Slytherins tonight,” she said. She pursed her lips and reached around to whack Draco on the back. Harry couldn’t see what he had been doing, since he was currently leaning against the other boy, but presumably what he wasn’t doing was paying attention to Pansy.
“I may have told them I’d hold onto your wand, and Zabini’s, too.” He placed his two friends’ wands down on Draco’s desk, trying not to laugh at the shocked look on Pansy’s face.
Draco shrugged in what Harry assumed was acquiescence. “I don’t want to lock myself in a room with them anyhow,” Draco said. “That’s asking for disaster.”
onto your arm, Hermione. You are the brightest witch of our age, you deserve everything you have earned because you have earned it on sheer talent and wit.
But there was no place for the Slytherins to take refuge. It was hurt or be hurt, and knowing them now he knew that they would choose to hurt – most people would, really. He knew, too, that there were students from every house that had participated. To place the blame on the Slytherins alone felt…irresponsible, almost. Especially for a war that was so brutal because of a madman’s ability to pit children against children.
“Friendly seeming fellow,” Harry commented wryly as Draco fell in step beside him and they passed back through the wards together.
The next time he woke it was darker in his room. His head hurt less – his whole body hurt less, really. He shifted into a sitting position, looking around for his glasses once again.
“I didn’t see you at dinner last night,” she said conversationally. He couldn’t help but feel as though she was making fun of him.
Hermione huffed out a breath and pushed her hair out of her face. “I didn’t want you to worry,” she said, finally, looking at him out of the side of her eye. “If it helps, Ron wanted me to be honest.”
Harry accepted the offered change of subject. “Yeah,” he said simply. “I had trouble leaving Andromeda’s for Hogwarts, this year. Didn’t want to go. I think it will be nice to have them back. But I’m worried…” he trailed off.
Harry’s mind, unbidden, went back to their year on the run – to Ron running away. He came back then, though.
He drew four columns on the board and turned back to the class. “I think we all know at least one evil wizard that we’ll be talking about today,” he said. There were some whispers, but no one said anything out loud, so he continued on. Turning back to the chalkboard he wrote
To his surprise, Justin, Ernie, and Seamus all drew their wands, as well. Ernie and Seamus had their wands trained evenly on Zabini. Justin, though, Harry realized with shock, had his wand trained directly on him. At least when they made eye contact Justin had the presence of mind to look slightly abashed.
“We don’t need to talk about it,” Zabini said then. “It just sounded – sounded worse than your usual.”
Harry sat up, felt his eyebrows furrow. “Come on,” he said finally, standing up and grabbing both their shirts off the floor. He headed down the hall towards his room, pausing to place the monitoring spell on Teddy’s room along the way. He didn’t wait to see if Draco would follow – knew he would. In the Days Before, Harry never would have been so bold.
Harry let his hands move, skimming Draco’s calves, his thighs, dancing along the skin above the waistline of his pants. “I feel like,” Harry began. He stopped, gathered his thoughts, leaned into Draco’s touch on his chest. “Death follows me,” he said, almost sighed. “I dreamed that I went through the veil. You were there, you all were; you needed my help and I left. I just left.”
Pansy was not smug. She was, in fact, not at all impressed. Harry felt her eyes on him almost as soon as he and Draco stepped into the Great Hall. Draco must have felt it, too – or maybe it was the stares of all the students trickling in, because he dropped Harry’s hand almost immediately. When Harry cast a sharp look at him, he was staring straight ahead.
“You can’t expect us to believe,” Granger said, lifting her head, “That you have anyting to
Harry leaned in towards Zabini. “Reckon any arrangement is fine so long as I don’t end up sharing a room with Smith.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, shifting in his seat. He could tell she wasn’t upset or disappointed, not exactly, but he hated that she worried over him.
The four ostensibly avoided the eighth year common room, choosing to spend most of their time instead in Draco’s rooms, abandoned classrooms, or on the grounds instead. They never went anywhere alone, either. Smith had quieted down, but they often found people lurking around the common room and various corridors at all hours of the day and night. Harry was also quite sure they had people tailing Draco and Pansy, at least, but the others had told him he was being paranoid when he brought it up.
“We’re going to try to keep this discussion simple and factual, alright?” he continued on. “If anyone is upset for any reason, please tell me so we can pause. Some of what we’re hearing about are things we all lived through. Some of it is going to mirror things we lived through. It’s okay to be upset or need a break, alright?” Twenty nodding faces with solemn eyes looked back at him.
“Oh please,” Ron said, finally. His face was bright red, like there was anger boiling just beneath the surface. Harry could feel the explosion coming – wished he could run, wished he would be able to yell back. In the Days Before he certainly would have been able to – yell back, at least. But in the Days After he was just struck by how desperately he wanted to sleep the world away.
Harry felt himself reel back, physically. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“You’re thinking too loudly,” Draco’s voice drawled at him. “I can’t focus when I can
“Okay, Mar,” Harry said. He gave her his best interpretation of a friendly smile. The whole group of children looked less scared now, more eager to be here, as if her words and confidence had broken whatever emotions were keeping them scared or subdued.
I’ve started this letter too many times and I have potions work to do, so I’m not going to start over anymore.
“You’ve changed,” she said, finally. He hummed, not sure what to say to that. “You’re so much calmer. And thoughtful.”
“Like hell it didn’t,” Ron snarled angrily. “I’m sure he’s loving the benefits of fucking the Saviour of the Wizarding World – the sooner he does his time the sooner he can fuck off back to his life of luxury and muggle killing, right?”
Harry did his best to give her a smile as he pulled out his potions book. He glanced back at Luna and Draco again. The two were deep in conversation, now, but Draco was still scratching at his arm.
!” Harry spluttered, sat up like a shot, as water was poured on his face. His vision came back to properly to see Blaise standing over him, looking slightly sheepish.
“Pansy,” gasped one of the girls. She rushed forward again to hug Pansy around the middle, the rest of the group following until Pansy was nearly buried under Hufflepuffs. A couple made their way to Blaise, too.
people, those who deserved it – still made him feel weak.
“You’re actually daft,” Blaise said. Draco could hear the false amazement in his voice, the mocking tone. His friend’s face was hardened, looked almost impassive but Draco knew that for Blaise, that meant he was angry.
Harry felt another pang of… not sadness, not really – something worse. That feeling as if his heart was breaking despite already being so broken that it couldn’t possibly break anymore. “I’ll still have weekends, yeah?” he said, leaning into Draco slightly.
When he had the tie in his hands, Draco reached up to take it from him. “Tell me if this isn’t okay,” he said, before guiding Harry’s arms behind his back and wrapping the tie around them. He didn’t tie it or bind him, really, in any way, but Harry felt his cock twitch in anticipation anyways. Draco smirked up at him.
“I can feel you watching me,” Draco drawled without looking over. Harry smirked, but didn’t move from where he was leaning.
“Malfoy?” Harry croaked, almost incredulously. As the name passed his lips, the blonde man materialized in front of him.
Draco’s bathroom was small, but the shower was decent and the air was never too cold. Harry started the water, running it as warm as he thought he could handle. When he turned, Draco already had his shirt off. He drew Harry close again, and Harry allowed Draco to maneuver him against the counter pushing him up and pinning him there with his hips.
“You’re expected in the Great Hall for lunch in an hour where I will provide you more instructions for your first week here and what to expect upon the arrival of the rest of the Hogwarts students. Until then, you’ll find your room assignments posted on the far wall. I will not hear any arguments or requests to switch rooms, these are final.” With a last look at all of them, she spun with a swish of her robes and departed down the corridor.
“Alright?” Harry asked Draco as they started walking. Draco was flushed and looked as though he’d be sick at any minute.
in the next column. Randy was quiet, Harry was fairly certain he was a half-blood or pure-blood, although he had asked none of his students about their blood status. It was clear he had never been to school before Hogwarts – he often seemed overwhelmed by the number of people in his class and the noise around the castle.
“I have my own,” said Draco with a shrug. Harry could see the lines of tension in his body, though, and clearly Pansy could, too. She put a calming hand on his arm. Harry tried to ignore the flare of jealousy in his stomach as Draco leaned into her touch.
The fact was, Harry had found dozens of excuses to visit in the weeks following that night. Sorting library books for Madame Pince, calming Myrtle while her bathroom was being repaired, permanently sealing the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. And of course, if he happened to bump into Draco Malfoy, who would complain, really? He couldn’t, however, find any good reasons to stay the night. In fact, it was expressly not allowed. The other problem was that he had time to visit the castle much less than he liked, simply because Teddy was here and needed him.
,” he read in a monotone voice. “That’s easy. Medicine, psychology, they’ve been to the moon! All we can do is magic. If it’s a race of who’s superior, wizards lose.”
Draco squeezed his hand gently as they neared a small crowd at the Slytherin table, before letting go. Harry felt the loss immediately, but was mollified when he saw two students run up to Draco. They weren’t first years at all – second or third, from the looks of it. His heart bloomed in his chest as he saw Draco bend down to address the two students face-to-face.
“Must not be bad, being here this summer,” Harry said after some silence. “Better than,” he gestured broadly.
“Ask you friends,” Draco spoke up, then. “Ask your pathetic friends what happened in the castle after they saved their own skin and abandoned everyone else – even first years, to the Carrows. Ask them who stepped in to help when they were gone.”
“I’m almost packed,” he said to Andromeda.
“I don’t sound like that,” Harry said, weakly. Hermione glared at him, but she had stopped crying through her angry tirade. “Does it help if I say sorry?” He asked meekly.
“Noticed you don’t have a room, Death Eater,” came a voice in front of them. It was Zacharias Smith, of course. Harry was utterly unsurprised, although he was more surprised to see Justin, Ernie, and Seamus flanking him.
He had turned to exercise instead. It was almost more helpful, and it kept him outside for hours every day. He’d filled out from the combination of food and his workout regime, was less the scrawny child he’d always been.
He looked as he always did these days, slight and tired. His eyes had their now characteristic bags, his hair was long – nearing his shoulders, and mussed. He was wearing muggle clothes, jeans and a sweater. Harry thought it was frightfully attractive, though he’d never say it.
writing this so far has been SO MUCH FUN and it's 100% because of the engagement of everyone who has read it. i love u all <3 the comments on my writings style literally make me so happy, i write/blog non fiction stuff normally (if ppl are interested i'm down to self promote LMAO) so knowing so many people enjoy my prose is WONDERFUL
“I know I am,” he said with a gentle smile. “Now get reading, the lot of you.”
Madame Pomfrey nodded in agreement as McGonagall spoke. “That means there are some very important rules you’ll have to follow,” Pomfrey said. “No magic, in class or outside of it for the next two weeks. No extra activities that will put any strain on your body, like quidditch,” she said with a pointed look at him. “You’ll see me every day for the next week so I can monitor your magic levels, and then every other day the week after. Once we pass the two week mark we’ll devise a new plan based on the levels of your magical stores.”
“Now there’s one more muggle I’m thinking of, from around the same time as Hitler. I’m not sure if anyone will know who I’m talking about or not,” he said, but Mar’s hand had already shot into the air for the fourth time that day. “Alright, Mar, who do you think?”
Professor Stone waved them in. Harry could feel the concerned look she trained on him as he walked by, but he kept looking ahead. There were more pressing things on his mind than his breakdown – like why Ginny Weasley had shown up out of nowhere after months of anger to partner with him in potions.
“With all due respect,” she said, sounding as if she held not an ounce of respect for the man. It made Harry grin in spite of himself. “His magical core is dangerously depleted. It seems even using magic may be a danger to him. Surely you realized this.”
Ron and Hermione’s eyes were on him again, Harry could feel it. This time, they didn’t look away when he looked up. Hermione gave him a small smile, even from the distance across the table he could see her eyes glistening. Ron nodded, his arm firmly around Hermione’s shoulders, and even Neville gave him a funny look. Harry was hit with a feeling of
“I should find Draco,” he said. “I was at Mungo’s today and sort of…didn’t come back.”
Harry felt his breath leave him in a short gasp as Draco’s mouth trailed down his jawline, found a sensitive spot on his neck. He ran his hands down Draco’s sides as Draco’s mouth found his, kissing him tantalizingly slowly. When Harry pressed forward into the kiss, Draco pulled back. When Harry arched his body, Draco lifted his own body away.
“I think I can decide that for myself, thanks,” Harry said, shocked at how clear his voice was. It was instinct again, that was driving him. Consciously, he mostly wanted to be sick. “I’m happy to room with Zabini for the year.”
desperately hate it.
Harry woke in time to rush out for his pre-breakfast meeting with McGonagall, leaving Draco fast asleep behind him. He was starving, not to mention still groggy from the extra sleep and anxious about all the school work he had to complete. Perhaps he’d go for a quick run before breakfast, or a fly – but that seemed a waste of time when he could also just get some food from the kitchens and work on his charms essay or lesson plans instead.
Hermione gave him a hard look as she stood. “Do I want to know?” She asked, finally.
Pansy laughed softly. “It’s from an old Latin song. It translates to
Harry tilted his head back, letting it play out. Draco’s lips had moved from his own onto his collarbone. He sucked hard, then bit suddenly before lapping at the spot. Harry brought his hands up in return, pulling on Draco’s robes until he stepped back to shrug them off and then working his way through the buttons.
“I will not,” he sniffed. “Everyone in this room, including Pansy and Potter, has spent all summer trying to
Harry grinned somewhat ruefully at him. The other boy wasn’t wrong at all. In fact, he was quite right. It wasn’t something Harry would have suggested in the first place, had he known how it was going to end up from the start.
survive.
to find a reason to get us sent home and we don’t particularly want to give him one. Your goodie two shoes Gryffindor pals don’t seem to want to lend us a hand, either,” Harry felt as if he were a small child being spoken sternly to for misbehaving. “So we are going to leave before anyone else is up and have a cozy breakfast with the house elves.”
Draco looked stunned. “She did?”
“Dare I ask where you discovered this information?” she gave them each a piercing look, but Pansy merely shrugged.
“Stalin,” she said confidently. Harry couldn’t help but shake his head in amusement. Of course if anyone had an answer it would be Mar. He wrote down the last name and then picked up a stack of parchments from his desk, handing them out manually to each student since he couldn’t use his wand.
“Harry?” he looked up, startled, realizing he had been lost in thought for a few minutes and merely pushing his food around on his plate. Andromeda looked concerned, and Draco looked as though he was avoiding eye contact. “You’ll be alright, you know,” she said softly to him.
“More for us to keep in line of course,” Pansy grumbled. Harry shook his head slightly at her – despite her words, she seemed gratified that they had so many students. He was…possibly a little bit excited at the prospect as well. After all, the first step to opening a proper school would be learning how to interact with children.
Draco pushed him up against the door impatiently as soon as they entered the room. “I was so scared,” he said between kisses. It was a small thing to say, but significant nonetheless for a man who rarely talked about his feelings.
“Can I talk to you, mate?” Neville said. He had leaned in and dropped his voice, presumably so the other three couldn’t hear him. This, Harry thought, was honestly a bit paranoid.
“Yes,” Blaise said almost immediately, his look dark. Harry locked eyes with him for a moment – he wasn’t sure when he had begun silently communicating with Blaise, but it was clear the other boy knew exactly what he was talking about. Both Pansy and Draco shook their heads, however.
“I’m okay,” Harry repeated again, helplessly. Angry Draco, he could deal with. Controlling Draco he could handle. Demanding and needy Draco was easy. But scared Draco was something he hadn’t encountered yet. A Draco that expressed his need for comfort through softness instead of angry quips and pushing him away was new and Harry wasn’t exactly sure how to handle it.
Harry placed Teddy in his chair at the table. “It smells good, Andy,” he said.
“We’re hunting for fish,” Mar said, so innocently Harry had to focus to keep from laughing. Draco and Blaise were both watching from somewhere behind him – he only knew because he could distinctly hear both of them laughing.
“If it’s your fault, it’s mine, too,” Harry said, looking at him hard. They were standing facing each other, less than an arms length apart. Harry had to tilt his head slightly to look Draco in the eye. When Draco began to protest, he continued. “I could have gone to him sooner; could have given up sooner. I should have. Less people would have died. But I was scared, so I didn’t. But you – you saved me when it counted. If it hadn’t been for you at the Manor, I would have been dead.”
Thanks to Draco’s insistence that they begin eating in the kitchens again, at least until Harry was feeling better, Harry was able to avoid any questioning by other students until Monday evening. He, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had made their way to the Slytherin common room after dinner intent on getting some work done without being distracted by the rowdy eighth years. Professor McGonagall had announced that the sixth through eighth years were to meet in the Great Hall at eight o’clock that night. Harry and Draco knew why, but no one else did – not even Blaise and Pansy.
“Lots of reasons,” Draco said. “At least I’d imagine. There’s the risk of exposing muggle children to magic, for one thing.”
Harry kissed Teddy on the forehead and stepped outside. The sun was beginning to set, washing the world in pink and orange hues. As he walked, he tried not to look at the spots that held memories from the Days Before. Where he and Hagrid had crashed the motorcycle after seeing Voldemort on their way to this very cottage. Tried not to remember Moody’s death, George’s ear, Lupin and Tonks and Fred alive.
“Erm…” Harry was mostly at a loss for words.
She swatted him with a towel. “Yes, and you’re stinking up the whole room. Are you packed for Hogwarts?”
He not-so-surreptitiously rolled up his sleeves, showing his faded Mark. “I’m okay with – learning to be okay with that as a part of me. So hate me, I don’t care, Weasley. But Pansy is ten times the person either of you will ever be. Don’t touch her, don’t even fucking look at her or I swear to Merlin I will
smug,” Harry said with a sigh.
“Not really,” she said. “I just don’t understand.”
“I’d like to open a school,” he said finally. Pansy raised her eyebrows, which he took as permission to continue. “My godfather left me his old house – I’d like to convert it into some sort of primary school that would take in purebloods, halfbloods, and muggleborns before Hogwarts. They’d learn core subjects from muggle schools, but they’d also learn magical basics – history and culture. That way they’re exposed to all ways of living, I suppose,” he finished, somewhat lamely.

Draco shuddered at the cold air. “A little warning next time, Potter,” he grumbled.
they were dead.
“Good, you’re decent,” she said sardonically. “My eyes are saved, to be scarred another day.”
I quite enjoy this chapter for Harry although I realize there isn’t much Draco in it. But we’ll see him again next chapter<333
“You’re just jealous you don’t have hair as nice as mine,” Draco said, reaching up to tug a strand of Harry’s hair – rather harder than necessary.
Pansy wrinkled her nose. “Did you really have that much tea with McGonagall?”
Draco was a bit fuzzy on the edges – since they were out of class he couldn’t cast the charm on himself. Harry couldn’t cast it, because – well, his magic was still unpredictable. And getting worse, it seemed, but he was trying not to dwell on it. So Pansy and Blaise had fought over whose disillusionment charm was better – a fight which Pansy ultimately won. Still, no one seemed to notice his slight edges as they ducked out of the common room.
“And that upset you,” Andromeda said, watching him over the rim of her teacup.
“Arwen,” Harry said, pointing to a muggleborn Ravenclaw girl at the front of the classroom.
“We had planning to do, Potter,” she hissed at him. “And you had to go and disappear to shag Draco instead and leave me to do it all on my own.”
“What was that for?” Harry asked finally, once his breath was back. He let Draco lead him to the bed and threw himself on top of it, utterly spent.
going to remember that password,” he groaned. The Gryffindor boys at the front laughed, and then the tension was broken and they surged in.
“Thanks,” Harry said, albeit begrudgngly. He had always liked Neville, generally, but it seemed a deliberate slight that he was offering Harry help after having already stood around to watch Zacharias and his friends pull wands on him. And it didn’t escape Harry’s notice that while Neville clearly thought Harry was deserving of help, the thought did not extend to the people around him.
“Nonsense,” she said as Madame Pomfrey came bustling in. “We’re all glad you’re alright.”
“You – how did you convince them to do that?” she asked in shock.
They were silent as they walked, Harry mulling over Pansy’s words. She was right to be hurt, he knew, and brave to admit it. He couldn’t help but feel guilt, too. If he had been here… he doubted he would have spared thoughts for the Slytherins. Doubted he would have been any better than Neville when it came to saving the first years, those outside the DA. Would have seen graffiti and throwing insults at the Carrows as the ultimate rebellion.
Harry reached toward Draco and hauled him up by his hand, then turned to do the same for Blaise. Pansy got to her feet on her own, giving a dignified sort of sniff as she did. Draco saw Harry roll his eyes at her good-naturedly.
Harry felt queasy all over again.
“Didn’t realize the Saviour of the Wizarding World startled so easily,” Malfoy drawled back, but there was no malice in his tone. Harry shifted to the side – the oher man was standing much too close to him, and fumbled with his cigarette pack in his attempt to light another. He needed to take a drag, needed to calm himself down, couldn’t hope to do that with Draco Malfoy standing that
Blaise ushered Harry and Pansy out of the door, making them swear they would retell every moment when they were all at dinner. Pansy and Harry walked in silence, at first, which Harry didn’t mind. He imagined Pansy was working out what she would say, and he was always content to be left with his thoughts in the Days After.
After a minute of this, Draco disentangled himself slowly. “What was that for?” Harry asked finally, once his breath was back. He let Draco lead him to the bed and threw himself on top of it, utterly exhausted.
Her cackles were cut off abruptly as they saw the group of Gryffindor’s walking up from the entrance to the common room, which had somehow opened without them hearing. Potter looked like he was trying to hid a smile. Granger, on his left, was looking awkward, her lips turned into a frown. He was sure she was blushing, even if, like Potter, her skin was too dark for it to be visible. Weasley, however, was bright red, intently looking aroudn the common room as if it was fascinating.
“Is it selfish,” Draco whispered in his ear, as he drew Harry’s sweater above his head, “that I’m grateful you stayed?”
“Very Slytherin of you, Potter,” she said, coming back around to sit on the bed again. “Very sneaky.”
He glanced over at Ron and Hermione. They were both watching with unabashed curiosity. Ron still looked like he was fuming. With some effort, he turned a smile to her. “What, Mar?”
Dithering again, of course.
Pansy hummed – thoughtfully or in agreement, Harry wasn’t sure.
onto your arm, Hermione. You are the brightest witch of our age, you deserve everything you have earned because you have earned it on sheer talent and wit.
“I’ll be okay,” he said in response. It wasn’t really an answer, wasn’t what Draco was even asking, but it was the best he could give. Draco’s encouraging squeeze of his hand told him that he understood, too.
one last lil fluffy chapter before the plot picks up and harry isnt allowed to be happy anymore (kidding,,,maybe)
“Potter, are you absolutely mental? They’ll hurt him, he can’t even use a wand!” she had jumped up and had a hand on the door already, looking particularly murderous.
“I’m almost packed,” he said to Andromeda.
“It is when you’re annoying me,” Draco said without malice. Harry shuddered as Draco’s lips found his neck.
“What are you doing in here?” was the first thing that came out of his mouth. It was slightly more aggressive than he intended but, well – the sun wasn’t even up.
He was woken, unsure of how much time had passed, to Draco shaking him. “The Welcome Feast is soon,” Draco said. “And we need to find Blaise and Pansy.”
“Draco has choices now and he’s making the right ones. Have you seen how so many of the kids here interact with him and Pansy? You don’t have to like it, ‘Mione, but the DA failed here. And I’m not saying I expected them to keep putting themselves in harms’ way. We were all just kids. But when they left, when they hid by themselves, it was Draco and Pansy and Blaise and Daphne that took over. And it was them from the start, keeping the Slytherins safe.” Harry sighed. “No one is going to wake up the next morning and be over it. But we can at least start.”
“Must I always clean up your messes, Potter?” he sighed. There was no malice behind it, though, and Harry was able to roll his eyes back before turning around to see Mar grinning ear-to-ear at him. She was bouncing on the balls of her feet, too, but she wasn’t tapping her fingers today.
“I wanted to ask you about something,” Harry said, “if that’s alright.”
“Breakfast?” he asked. “We were only supposed to nap.”
“What do you want, then?” Pansy asked, no longer hiding her curiosity. They had reached the kitchens, and he paused to tickle the pear on the portrait before responding.
with them. Especially small Slytherins who had no reason to trust him.
She turned kind eyes on him. “It’ll be alright, Harry. Teddy and I will visit.” She squeezed his shoulder as he moved through the kitchen towards his bedroom.
. Draco Malfoy was bloody beautiful.
Then I was home for Easter. When I was a child we would have a big dinner. Spring vegetables, the best lamb I’ve ever tasted. We would dress nicely, host other families. Pansy often came, as did Vince and Greg. Those were the best times of my life.
“That’s why your school is such a good idea, Potter,” said Pansy, scrunching her face as if the compliment hurt her to hand out. “It provides an option for families that wouldn’t normally have one.”
“Library,” Harry grunted back. “Hoping my transfiguration essay would write itself.”
“What are we learning then?” asked Mar. She looked a little bit confused – or maybe frustrated – and was sitting slightly apart than the rest of her classmates. He decided that he would definitely keep an eye on her during this class, especially. Instead of expressing his concern, though, he smiled at her.
Harry woke slowly, dimly aware of hushed voices speaking somewhere in his periphery. There was something soft underneath him – a bed? He winced as his eyes opened, becoming aware of a pounding headache and his sore body. Slowly, his argument with Ron and Hermione, his conversations with Mar, came back to him. He let out a frustrated huff of breath. Whoever was nearby must have heard him because the hushed voices stopped.
“Alright,” Harry said, bringing his hand up to caress Draco’s arm. He flung the covers back and stood up, intent on finding his shirt and some pants before he fell asleep.
“There’s a team of people,” he responded, hoping that was all he needed to say, but she just raised an eyebrow at him to continue. Harry sighed. “Well there’s me, of course. Professor McGonagall, Professor Strickland, one squib who works in muggle liaison for the Ministry of Magic and one wizard who works in the muggle government’s wizard liaison office. And Draco.”
“You should do Potter’s hair, Pans,” Draco said when a moment of silence got too long to be comfortable. “He wants to grow it.”
They entered the cottage one after the other to the sound of Teddy’s giggles. Harry smiled to himself – this, in the Days After, was the sound of family.
“I probably should,” Harry sighed in agreement. He hadn’t spoken to them since the previous day’s catastrophe.
“Arithmancy,” he said dully, “although I don’t really care.” He took a sip of what must have been coffee – hadn’t touched a bite of breakfast, Harry noticed.
“We had planning to do, Potter,” she hissed at him. “And you had to go and disappear to shag Draco instead and leave me to do it all on my own.”
“I should find Draco,” he said. “I was at Mungo’s today and sort of…didn’t come back.”
Andromeda sighed. “Not yet, Harry. You’ve been here for a day, it’s Sunday evening.”
He could tell, somewhere in his subconscious, that Draco had his hand on himself and was jerking off in time to his mouth’s movements on Harry. He was torn between the desire to grab Draco’s hair and the desire to leave his hands where they were, until he didn’t have to make that decision because he was coming harder than he ever had, orgasm sneaking up on him like a train screeching to a halt.
“You are,” Harry pushed, hoping his tone came off teasing. He looked over when Draco didn’t respond, to see the other man stubbornly looking at the wall instead of Harry. His right hand was back to playing with his left forearm.
“It’s not a hard assignment,” Draco said, giving Blaise a look as he packed up his stuff. He paused to read from the piece of parchment in front of him. “
“Breathe,” Draco said in his ear as they sat down at the table. Harry did his best to give Draco a smile, but was sure it came out looking wobbly. As usual, though, they were the only ones at their end of the eighth year table. Ron, Hermione, and Neville weren’t there yet, either, which helped calm his panic some.
It was a two part request, Harry knew. The first part was the offer, because of
“Didn’t realize the Saviour of the Wizarding World startled so easily,” Malfoy drawled back, but there was no malice in his tone. Harry shifted to the side – the other man was standing much too close to him, and fumbled with his cigarette pack in his attempt to light another. He needed to take a drag, needed to calm himself down, couldn’t hope to do that with Draco Malfoy standing that
After a beat of silence, Draco sighed. “They’ve been talking about it for ages,” he said gently to Harry. “It was bound to happen.”
“Still angry, then?” he asked, despite his better judgement telling him to be quiet and just do what she said. Handling an angry Ginny was much like handling an angry Pansy – nod, agree, and do whatever she asks of you.
does. You’re just like them. You deserve this.”
Harry cast a look around him – most of the gathered students just looked confused. Hermione looked appreciative, of course. So did Pansy.
Her smile was gentle, but Harry still frowned at her words. For the past three months they had shared house duties and Teddy duties. It had kept Harry from sinking into despair, even through the sleepless nights where the boy cried and cried, missing the mum and dad he had never known.
as he did so. He turned to see Draco standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room. “Yours is across the hall,” Harry said, by way of explanation. “Andy said we could keep it for you, for Christmas and the like, if you want to come here instead of stay at Hogwarts.”
“Does anyone know the name of another wizard who started wars before Riddle, when many of your grandparents or great-grandparents were young?”
Harry rolled his eyes, but was silently impressed. This was likely the longest he had slept without nightmares since, well – as long as he could remember, anyways.
Maybe it was his hero complex – Andromeda had certainly enouraged himto get out of the house; to visit the Weasleys, go flying with Charlie, visit the joke shop, floo Ron and Hermione who were still in Australia. Most of this he did. Most of it, actually, he did with a smiling baby attached to his hip.
“I don’t know,” he said. He paused to watch her as she poured some of their potion into a vial to submit to Professor Stone. It was supposed to be dark purple upon completion; theirs was a little bit too light, he thought, but not horrid. “Some things are just…broken.”
“Ew,” she said, making a face. “But Mary didn’t say anything mean. She just said she could cut my hair.”
There I go, dithering again. Anyways, that was the first time I perhaps was able to realize that what I believed and how I experienced the world was wrong. I am sorry that you had to be the person to prove that to me in such a gruesome way.
“It’s not even yours-” Weasley, the idiot, began to argue. But Blaise had caught on.
Draco hummed in understanding against him, curled up tighter against Harry’s body. Harry shifted to his side as well – put his forehead agasint Draco’s, let Draco tangle their legs together.
By the time they entered the Great Hall, he was on high alert – every sound making him jump and shake. Draco was still holding his hand on one side and Blaise had materialized on the other, both keeping him steady. Pansy was ahead of them, saying goodbye to the Hufflepuffs as well as a couple Ravenclaws that had joined along the way.
Blaise mock shudered. “The arithmancy OWL of the Boy Who Lived resting on my shoulders? That’s too much responsibility.”
“Yes,” Blaise said almost immediately, his look dark. Harry locked eyes with him for a moment – he wasn’t sure when he had begun silently communicating with Blaise, but it was clear the other boy knew exactly what he was talking about. Both Pansy and Draco shook their heads, however.
They didn’t have to wear uniforms yet, since they were the only students in the school, so Harry pulled on a soft sweater and some jeans. He ran a quick hand through his hair before giving up on attempting to neaten it altogether. He was pulling a quill and some parchment out of his trunk just as Pansy stepped back in.
“Oi!” he called as he approached the first years. Mar stopped short when he called out, prompting another first year, Jason, to bump into her. “Don’t you have work to be doing?” he asked, in his best stern professor voice.
I know it might be hard to understand, but my parents loved me. Truly. Father
“Why are you here?” Harry asked, once his words had returned. He hadn’t seen Malfoy since his trial in front of the Wizengamot. Harry and returned Malfoy his wand, then. Had spoken in his defence. But had not stuck around to see the results of the trial. Hermione had insisted he shouldn’t get too invested, that he couldn’t save everyone. She was right, of course. Eventually, days had faded into weeks, and he had stopped being curous about the outcome.
“Very well,” said the Healer, somehow making it sound as if speaking to Harry was the biggest inconvenience he could fathom. “There is nothing technically wrong with you,” he said to Harry directly. “It seems as though it is all in your mind.”
Harry realized he hadn’t thought of this – whether or not the eighth years would contribute to the ranks of prefects or not. It wouldn’t have affected him, but Draco and Pansy had both been prefects.
“Thanks,” Harry said, accepting them from her and putting them on his face. “Where’s Teddy?”
Harry nudged Draco to move over, and they shuffled to the foot of his bed so they could see the Gryffindors better, but also weren’t so close to them. Pansy and Blaise followed suit. Then, the room descended into an awkward silence.
All of this being said, I deeply apologize for the horrid person that I was, that I sometimes still am. Hermione, I targeted you constantly. I called you slurs, implied you were less than me but for a simple accident of birth. I will not bring up every incident – indeed there are likely too many to even recount here, but I am truly sorry for my deplorable actions. I am a better man now, and I will be better in the future. I understand how I have hurt you, how I contributed to a society that was bent on seeing you fail. I will no longer contribute to this. I will actively oppose these ideals for the rest of my life in any way that I can. You are welcome to hold me accountable for this.
“I’ll be okay,” he said in response. It wasn’t really an answer, wasn’t what Draco was even asking, but it was the best he could give. Draco’s encouraging squeeze of his hand told him that he understood, too.
here we go! don't mind me projecting onto mar oops
Harry had never been more uncomfortable in his life.
“They really are trying to make sure we have the most work possible, aren’t they?” Blaise sighed. Draco smiled at him, but Harry noticed that it didn’t quite reach his eyes. He knew it was frustrating to Draco to watch his classmates get to choose professors to shadow, be assigned to rooms, help younger students, meanwhile he wasn’t even allowed to carry a wand outside of class.
Harry groaned. “Don’t remind me, please. I’m trying not to think about it.”
“You’re teaching us history, right?” Mar’s voice came from behind him as soon as he sat down. Plenty of the others seemed to find her annoying or weird, but Harry quite enjoyed her presence. Pansy, too, seemed to have taken a liking to her.
“I had to listen to her prattle on about it all the way here,” Blaise groaned, “And she wouldn’t even tell me what it was.”
and the second was
Weasley flushed a brilliant shade of red. “Shut it Zabini,” he ground out.
Before he could say anything, a girl’s voice spoke up. “Are you Harry Potter?”
Dithering again, of course.
“You can’t,” he said, instead.
Draco had a free period in the morning while Blaise had Care of Magical Creatures, Pansy had a meeting with Professor Stone, and Harry had Arithmancy. His Arithmancy happened to be in conjunction with the fourth years on this particular day, although he’d be in a separate classroom watching through a one-way magical hole in the wall. It was still slightly embarrassing. McGonagall had assured him that it wouldn’t take him long to progress to the level of a fifth year, but sharing classes with fifth years wasn’t that much better, in Harry’s opinion.
Blaise mock shuddered. “The arithmancy OWL of the Boy Who Lived resting on my shoulders? That’s too much responsibility.”
He noticed the Slytherins had stayed uncharacterstically silent, too. Harry, Draco, and Pansy had taken up space at the back of the group almost immediately, and somehow Zabini had ended up on Harry’s other side. He tried not to look worried by this turn of events, where he was surrounded by the people the rest of the school hated most.
“That has got to be the least subtle way to enter or exit anywhere, ever,” Pansy sighed. Harry smirked at her, but didn’t say anything. His mind was still reeling.
“Now would you like to tell me why you’re here instead of at school? Does anyone know where you are?” Harry avoided meeting her eyes, not wanting to see the worry that was likely playing out in them.
. I was horrid to Weasley.”
Not that he minded, really. He struggled with the isolation. It wasn’t so bad now that the castle was full of people, although without Blaise, Pansy, and Potter it would have undoubtedly have been worse – but the summer had been horrible. Even with Potter visiting, the letters and floo calls exchanged with his friends, it had been horribly lonely.
The rest of the week passed in a blur of much too much homework for a school year that had yet to even start. Harry met with McGonagall four times, directly after breakfast. He had chosen her to shadow to do his best to learn what running a school was like. So far, it was simply a mess of boring paperwork. He had met with Binns four times, too. The ghost had about as much personality as his teaching skills implied, but Harry was determined to do something about History of Magic at Hogwarts. After all, perhaps if they focused on the
By the end of the day, he was so tired he was ready to drop – but he still had at least three essays to work on, not to mention the amount of reading and lesson planning he needed to get done,
He was sure he had wanted to say more, something about how Ron and Hermione were leaving, how Ginny would barely look at him, and how the quiet at Andromeda’s house could be oppressive. About how every time he looked at Teddy he was filled with love greater than anything he could have ever imagined and grief stronger than a tidal wave. About how he dreamed of having the luxury to have stayed dead. About how different the Days After Harry was than the Days before Harry. About how beautiful Draco looked in the moonlight.
Harry filled him in quickly on what they had spoken of during the class. He even added, for good measure, how well their potion came out. He wasn’t sure when, but at some point while he was talking, he drifted into sleep.
“While
When he died, he had seent the tortured part of Voldemort’s soul die along with him, heard Dumbledore tell him that it was past saving, watched the pain it exhibited. Nobody at Hogwarts was past saving, but they all had tortured souls, now. In the Days After, with Andromeda’s help, Harry was able to find that tortured part of his soul. He couldn’t heal it – was unsure if it would ever be healed, but he felt it contract whenever he thought of those who died, whenever he heard a loud noise, whenever someone raised their wand at him. Andromeda had said being aware of it was half the battle of healing it, but Harry didn’t think it could be healed – not really.
Or was that him, straining against his own emotions?
“Breathe,” Draco said in his ear as they sat down at the table. Harry did his best to give Draco a smile, but was sure it came out looking wobbly. As usual, though, they were the only ones at their end of the eighth year table. Ron, Hermione, and Neville weren’t there yet, either, which helped calm his panic some.
“They said nothing was wrong with me,” Harry said, finally. “That it was all in my head.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “That didn’t have anything to do with-”
“I guess I never realized that there were children coming to Hogwarts without any sort of school before that,” Harry said. “It must be hard.”
Harry pointedly ignored him. “I have twenty-eight students in my first year class. Three of them can’t write – at all. They’re eleven!” He sighed. “How does a child grow up for eleven years and not learn how to write a proper sentence?”
In the quiet of the forest, he breathed in the earthy air, pausing just to appreciate the
Mar scrunched up her face. “That’s like when someone says something they don’t mean, right?”
When she finally looked up at him, she sighed dramatically.
“Stalin,” she said confidently. Harry couldn’t help but shake his head in amusement. Of course if anyone had an answer it would be Mar. He wrote down the last name and then picked up a stack of parchments from his desk, handing them out manually to each student since he couldn’t use his wand.
? That sounds-”
Andromeda tsked. She and Harry had discussed Draco and Narcissa’s situation at length many times, and he knew she didn’t approve of the treatment of her sister or her nephew. “A complete shame they’re keeping you separate,” she said, lips pursed. “As if you’d be a threat.” He saw Draco give her a small smile. “If you need anything, you write me. Understand?”
“We could call you Mari,” piped up another boy.
people who could ever possibly exist.” She spat out the word forgiving as if it was an insult. It was, in a way, given how they had all been raised.
And then he was pulling away from her, dodging a slap that was aimed at his shoulder and laughing like he hadn’t laughed in ages.
Neither of them lasted long – although whatever Draco had said about exertion was entirely untrue. Harry felt spent – not that it was a bad feeling, but it wasn’t as though he could tell Madame Pomfrey that he had broken her orders by having sex in the shower with Draco Malfoy.
“We heard that you were planning on assigning two eighth years per house this year,” Pansy began after a pregnant pause. The Headmistress looked shocked – whatever she had been expecting from the two of them, it was not this.
, Potter.” Harry jumped, accidentally jostling Draco’s head off of his shoulder. It was Blaise, who normally neve rose his voice. He was glaring daggers at Harry. “She didn’t do shit for us last year, left us to save ourselves, just like the rest of your stupid little army.”
Harry had fully intended to rest, too – he really was exhausted. But Draco, of course, had other plans. They were barely inside Draco’s rooms before he had Harry up against the wall. The stone was rough and cold on Harry’s back, but with Draco’s lips on his he hardly noticed.
“Want to deal with it yourself, do you?” he asked, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “Ready to chase down a
Pansy scoffed at him. “The Parkinson’s aren’t even Sacred Twenty-Eight anymore, though my parents and grandparents tried to pretend like we were. But no, and it wasn’t a noble decision, either. ‘Neutrality never loses’ is practically the Parkinson motto. Neither was Blaise’s mum, though she was a pureblood. Too busy marrying rich men and then killing them; doesn’t care wether they’re wizarding or muggle or anything so long as they’re rich. Actually,” she leaned in conspiratorily towards him, “I’m fairly sure Blaise’s dad, whoever he was, was muggle, from the way he talks about him. I’ve never asked, though. Blaise was a right ass when we were younger, anyways.”
Harry was promptly sick all over the floor.
They walked back as one, until Dracos legs hit Harry’s bed, when they paused. Harry’s fingers trailed across the waistband of Draco’s jeans for a moment and then Draco was dropping onto the bed, pulling Harry down with him and the night disappeared into bliss.
“We’re going to try to keep this discussion simple and factual, alright?” he continued on. “If anyone is upset for any reason, please tell me so we can pause. Some of what we’re hearing about are things we all lived through. Some of it is going to mirror things we lived through. It’s okay to be upset or need a break, alright?” Twenty nodding faces with solemn eyes looked back at him.
He didn’t have to ask twice. Draco was on him in a heartbeat, their lips crashing together as they did in the garden earlier that night. Harry pushed the other boy back until he was lying on his back on the couch, Harry bracing his body over top. He bit Draco’s lip, his neck, his collarbone with bruising force.
“You never told me that,” Draco said finally, breaking the silence.
Harry couldn’t help but give her a rueful grin at that. “Yeah,” was all he said.
. You see, despite being raised my whole life to despise muggles, I had never met a single one. Not until the war, at any rate. And even then, although you may think I am lying, I’ve never hurt one. Not because I’m particularly noble, but because I believed that muggles are so pathetic that it would be like kicking a puppy. I learned about guns this summer, and nuclear weapons.
“You think we wanted to hurt people? They threatened to kill our families, make us kill each other. Maybe you’d have let your family die for the greater good or whatever noble shite you believe that makes you think you’re better than us, but you’re not any better. You left by yourselves; you stayed home, you disappeared, you didn’t take a single first year or Slytherin with you.
They all sat in silence for a moment – Draco hovering above his bed. He was more anxious now, if that was even possible. Pansy, who was never uncertain, never wavered,
like he would be good at defence.
“Ask you friends,” Draco spoke up, then. “Ask your pathetic friends what happened in the castle after they saved their own skin and abandoned everyone else – even first years, to the Carrows. Ask them who stepped in to help when they were gone.”
“I didn’t save anyone, either,” Draco sighed.
True to his word, Harry was in and out of the shower in only a few minutes. He smelled like Draco’s shampoo and body wash – smelled like Draco, really. It was nice.
Draco’s hands wandered down his shirt, undoing each button slowly and precisely. Harry let out an amused huff although he felt like his heart would burst out of his chest from anticipation and desire. “Pomfrey told me I’m supposed to rest, you know.”
Reluctantly, Harry flipped himself off of Draco’s waist and stood slowly. His whole body was burning to touch and be touched.
– Neville could have been him, could have been the one targeted by Voldemort, the one who had to die. It could have always been like this, Harry in Slytherin with Draco and Pansy and Blaise, and Neville tromping around the castle and getting into trouble with Ron and Hermione. It felt
“Thank you for being here,” he said to Andromeda. “I’m sorry I scared you.”
“A thinly veiled threat, almost,” Blaise filled in for her. “Unless you all love each other very much,” he said in mimicry of the hat’s voice, “You will all die cold and alone.”
Draco just shrugged.
“Erm – hi,” Harry said. It was a strange moment, where he longed for the Days Before when he could talk to his friends without any awkwardness or shame. He was a product of the Days After now, hardly thought about the Days Before anymore.
“I wanted to ask you about something,” Harry said, “if that’s alright.”
He didn’t begrudge them for how they acted towards him either, not really. They were right – he had been gone. Maybe being on the run wasn’t the best way to spend the year, nor the Horcruxes or Ron leaving, but it was a sight better than watching the Carrows force students to hurt each other.
Harry just shook his head. “We were supposed to straight to see them. And Pansy knows, Draco. She always knows.”
“I didn’t want to,” Harry responded, sliding into the chair next to him. “Not until I knew I could make it happen.” He began to serve himself some food – if there was one thing he had missed about the castle, it had to have been Hogwarts food. “What professor did you request?” he added, directing his question at Pansy.
“I’m supposed to bring you straight to Pansy and Blaise,” Draco said.
“Everyone is fine,” McGonagall said gently. “It was an…internal reaction, so to speak. You were the only person harmed.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, drawing a surprised look from Blaise. Which was mildly hurtful, he thought. Surely they’d know how he’d feel about this better by now. “I’m going to go talk to her, make sure there’s a Slytherin for the Slytherins.”
“Heard you exploded,” said a voice from across from him. He looked up to see a seventh year prefect, Michael, looking at him in amusement. The prefects Harry knew better – he and Pansy were often coordinating with them over patrols and the time they spent in the Slytherin common room.
“What about, then?” Harry asked.
Draco Malfoy was not having a good day. He had woken late that morning, of course – so late that Blaise and Pansy had almost knocked down the door only to discover him and Harry, curled up in bed, completely naked. They woke to Pansy shreiking, dramatically as always. His friends needed to learn how to knock.
“Sort of friends?” Draco asked. There was amusement tinging his voice, now. Part of Harry wanted to make fun of him for being jealous, but the other part of Harry knew that would, more likely than not, end in disaster.
“I’m not spending anything near the amount of time on my hair that Draco does in the mornings,” Harry said. “That’s too much work.”
“Library,” Harry grunted back. “Hoping my transfiguration essay would write itself.”
“It wouldn’t matter, you know,” Draco said finally, as they mounted the stairs to the owlrey. Harry shot him a questioning look.
, Draco was quite confident he was a small step away from hyperventilating like a stupid twelve-year-old. But then Potter reached out and brushed Draco’s side again, and he could feel the tremor in his hands and – was it wrong that it made Draco feel a little bit better, to know Harry was just as worried?
And Draco Malfoy, that night on the Astronomy Tower. Things could never go back to how they were, and somehow, despite everything, Harry was infinitely grateful.
Harry was uncomfortable thinking about how Ron and Hermione would fit into this dynamic when they returned. Would they join him, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco for their walks around the castle? Shuffle themselves into their group to make sure no one went anywhere alone? He hadn’t told them anything about Draco, had been scared to. Would they fall in, instead, with Zacharias Smith? No, definitely not that, but perhaps with Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Nott. In the Days Before, he would have been sure of where they stood. In the Days After, he wasn’t quite sure about very many things anymore.
He felt Draco shudder under him. “Point taken. Let me up, then.”
“Whoever the new defence professor is, I suppose,” she said with a sigh. As far as anyone knew, the post had yet to be filled. At the very least, they hadn’t been introduced to any new professors, yet. At Harry’s inquiring look, she added, “I’d like to be an Auror Potter, what of it?”
Blaise burst out laughing, likely at the horrified look on Pansy’s face. Even Harry found a small smile from within himself.
Harry let out a laugh that sounded more like a choke. “Like that,” he said. “Draco is always mean before he has his coffee.”
yet, all the eighth years who were able were arriving the week before to help finalize castle preparation and restoration for the following year.
There wasn’t anyone waiting for him, though – except Draco. He was looking away from the door when Harry stepped out, sat on the stone floor with his knees drawn to his chest. Harry leaned against the wall, taking a moment to watch him.
Pansy relayed the plan quickly and efficiently – Harry’s only role was “Look friendly but don’t talk, for Merlin’s sake, or you’ll scare them away, Potter,” which he couldn’t really argue with. He spent the rest of the feast trying not to agonize about how the Slytherins would probably hate him and it would ruin his desire to open a school before he could even
“What is it?” Harry asked. Neville made a vague gesture at Draco, Blaise and Pansy, but Harry shook his head. “They stay.”
Harry felt himself draw his wand and raise it. It wasn’t concisous, was completely instinct – something that remainded from the Days Before, perhaps. He saw a flash in his peripheral vision – Zabini, also drawing his wand.
Did you know there were Slytherins who fought in the battle? Of course you didn’t – but it should be obvious. Children fought against their own parents. And all I could do was hide like a coward.
“I hate that worse,” Maribel responded primly. Harry couldn’t help a smile this time, at least.
“Want to deal with it yourself, do you?” he asked, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “Ready to chase down a
He followed the crowd inside, sticking close to Draco, Parkison, and Zabini. He felt a strange kinship with them - it was definitely strange, seeing as how Pansy had all but offered him to Voldemort during the Battle. But they were subdued; he could feel the anxiety from all of them, mirroring his own. He no longer had it in him to be boisterous, not in the Days After. Maybe he truly had belonged in Slytherin all along. Or maybe, as Andromeda had said, grief had changed him.
to him.
There was a crowd already at the door to the potions classroom when they arrived. Professor Stone, the new professor, was standing next to the door that was closed behind her. Harry and Draco followed Pansy and Blaise to the edge of the group. Ron and Hermione weren’t far in front of them, but they were standing with Neville, Dean, and Seamus, so Harry didn’t bother to even think about approaching.
“I don’t disagree with you,” she said after a moment. “I’ve seen it in my lifetime. I am afraid, sometimes, that war is inevitable, thought I know it is not.” She looked up at him then. It was a careful look, adult-to-adult, rather than teacher-to-student. “I do not know that we can do anything about it. We are just two people.”
Harry sat heavily in the stool next to her, knowing better than to interrupt Hermione when she was angry. He didn’t fancy a flock of charmed birds flying at his head, thank you very much.
Harry took a drag, willing his thoughts to calm. He couldn’t think, couldn’t move like this – and all the help his brain could supply him was one word –
Harry could tell when Teddy saw him, not because of the smile on his face or the way he babbled, but because his hair turned almost instantly into an unruly jet black.
Draco was sitting on his bed, smiling softly as Harry exited the bathroom, half dressed and hair dripping. With the water weighing it down, his hair was almost to his shoulders in length. When it was dry it was a little shorter than Draco’s own, and much more curly and unruly. He shook his hair out and laughed at the expression on Draco’s face when the water droplets hit him before coming over to sit beside him on the bed. They leaned against each other, Draco not seeming to care that Harry’s hair was getting the shoulder of his shirt wet.
“Why are you here?” Harry asked, once his words had returned. He hadn’t seen Malfoy since his trial in front of the Wizengamot. Harry had returned Malfoy his wand, then. Had spoken in his defence. But had not stuck around to see the results of the trial. Hermione had insisted he shouldn’t get too invested, that he couldn’t save everyone. She was right, of course. Eventually, days had faded into weeks, and he had stopped being curious about the outcome.
“Obviously,” Draco responded, but he rolled his eyes, which Harry was grateful for. He was significantly too tired to figure out how to react to sarcasm right now.
“But we know that doesn’t work!” Harry burst out. He felt anger rising, but tried to tamp it down. The last thing he needed was to explode again. “It’s happened time and time again through history – all suppression like that does is start more wars.”
“Andromeda-” he began, intending to point out how Andromeda had succesfully rescued herself, ended up on the right side, hadn’t hurt a single soul to do it.
Harry sighed inwardly. “We don’t have houses this year.” He was being deliberately stubborn. He knew what Neville meant, of course. Knew he didn’t mean it in bad faith, not exactly. They were all scared and scarred in their own ways.
“As far as I know, just Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, and Goyle. I think Millicent is going to Durmstrang with Daphne Greengrass. The rest have chosen not to, or…” he trailed off, but the words remained unspoken.
He tugged on her hair, not hard, but not gently either. “Are you saying I didn’t think before?”
“You sound like Pansy.” His observation earned him a very real glare from Hermione. “Honest!” He added. “She’s about as scary as you, too!”
“I cannot meet my aunt for the first time looking as if you just ravished me in her garden,” Draco said with a sigh, drawing his hands away from Harry’s waist.
“You’re not alright, Mr Potter, no,” Madame Pomfrey said from beside Professor McGonagall. “I’ve never seen such a large magical core depletion in all my time as a healer. It’s a wonder we didn’t have to send you to Saint Mungo’s – not to mention I’m shocked that you’re already awake.”
“I think I can decide that for myself, thanks,” Harry said, shocked at how clear his voice was. It was instinct again, that was driving him. Consciously, he mostly wanted to be sick. “I’m happy to room with Zabini for the year.”
Soon they were in the corridor outside the potions room again. The air was cooler, here, and Harry felt himself breathing more easily, although he hadn’t recognized how stifling the potions room had been until he exited. Draco followed him out, flanked by Blaise and Pansy.
“Abuse of your power so that we can study?” Pansy asked as Harry made his way back to the table. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
“You don’t think she’s a Squib, do you?” she asked. She didn’t seem upset, Harry made sure to note, but she did seem confused. He shrugged in response, but tried to puzzle it out himself. There were other squibs on the staff, of course, like Filch, so it wouldn’t be surprising.
Draco threw a towel at him. “Blaise and Pansy know where we are – they came looking for us last night. You didn’t even move when they came in. Pansy was convinced you were dead.”
He let his fingers trail down Draco’s body, pausing at the hemline of his sweater. Draco arched up, helping Harry to pull it off him, exposing his pale skin underneath. Harry reached down and pulled his own shirt off of his head.
It was Pansy, though, that answered. “There are,” she said. “And I think the library has a great big book about them with pictures and everything.”
Michael gave him a strange look. “What happened?”
“I think it’s that we’re the same, honestly,” Harry said. “Not completely,” he added at Hermione’s raised eyebrows. “It’s just…I never had a choice. Voldemort made the choice for me when I was a baby. And then Dumbledore, The Order…they made the rest of the choices. But Voldemort made Draco’s choices too. Voldemort, his dad, you know? And Draco understands what it’s like, to be forced into situations you had no control of and have to deal with the consequences.”
“Stop working, then,” Harry responded, throwing a pillow at him. He was being a little bit obstinate. He had work to get done, too, but he was too nervous about the next day, Ron and Hermione arriving to do anything about it.
Harry groaned. “I don’t need marks, Hermione. I just need to know things.”
Andromeda hadn’t come through with them, of course, but he was sorely missing her presence. Saying goodbye to Teddy, too, had made him feel as though he was ripping his heart into tiny little pieces.
“Welcome to History of Magic,” he began, looking out at the classroom. It wasn’t quite as full as a usual class would be – as classes were when it wasn’t the year after the war, anyways. There were officially twelve Slytherins – five boys and seven girls - seven Hufflepuffs, and nine Ravenclaws.
It was hard to fight what I’ve learned – to learn new ways to live and see the world. Did you know that muggles have been to the moon? I did not. I think that is fascinating. Even with all the magic at our hands, wizards have never even dreamt of entering space. I am dithering, though.
“There are magical fish?” she asked in wonder. Harry couldn’t help but smile.
. And it was strange – they weren’t even inside the classroom yet, not even seated, but she was speaking as if they were.
“We slept in,” Pansy said, turning her dark look on Harry.
But then I lost my best friend. I still hear his screams at night, I’m sure you know what that’s like. Then Harry was dead and I was somehow still alive and I thought – this is it. This is my chance to show my spine, to stand with Hogwarts.
“While
Hermione gave him a hard look as she stood. “Do I want to know?” She asked, finally.
“They can be quite meddlesome,” she said, with a tilt of her head. “Now, what would you like to know?”
“What look?” Harry asked, bemused. He turned as well, so they were both sitting, legs crossed, on the bed and Draco could reach his head easier.
She swatted him with a towel. “Yes, and you’re stinking up the whole room. Are you packed for Hogwarts?”
“The three of them, really,” Draco sighed. “It’s not as though I have a choice, and I’ll still be in my own rooms.”
“All right, Hermione?” He asked before he could stop himself. Before he could think better of it he moved towards her, placing a hand on her back.
“How’s Hogwarts, Draco?” asked Andromeda as she began to serve them up.
Harry felt Smith’s eyes lock onto him. “There’s no reason for you to be around them, Harry. We can talk to McGonagall, or the Minister. I’m sure they’d switch your rooms for you. If anyone desrves their own rooms, it’s you. Not this scum.” He indicated Draco with a jutt of his chin.
Draco just shrugged.
When she finally looked up at him, she sighed dramatically.
“I am Harry Potter,” he said. A wave of shock went through the group – he did his best to tactfully ignore it. “What’s your name?”
grow up in the middle of a war,” Pansy sniffed. “Honestly, Draco, not even she blames you.”
“Can we stop talking about it and go see it already?” Mar asked abruptly. Her fingers were tapping again, Harry noticed. He should ask McGonagall about that – it seemed a little bit strange.
This silence was less oppressive than when McGonagall was speaking. Harry felt himself come back to slowly. He was holding Pansy’s hand, he realized. She was dry-eyed, but looked suddenly exhausted, as if the world were too much. Draco’s hand was still on his knee –the other boy was looking straight down at his plate. Harry leaned into him cautiously, feeling gratified when Draco leaned back. He couldn’t see Blaise, on Draco’s other side, except for the arm that extended around Draco’s shoulder.
“Nothing,” he said evenly, although privately he was shocked. Shocked, mostly, to think that he had spent seven years in classes with the group of people before him and had not an inkling of what any of them were interested in. “What about you, Zabini?”
Before Harry could say anything, he was engulfed in Andromeda’s arms. It felt like home, as it did every time, but the homesickness hit him this time like it hadn’t before – perhaps because of his nightmare the previous night, or because of how he had been feeling all day. He let himself cling on tightly for a moment before pulling away.
Draco nodded and Andromeda turned her fierce look on Harry. “You as well. You’ll be alright, both of you. Now, who else is coming back?”
“That’s bullshit, Longbottom.” It was Pansy, voice firm but body trembling. Blaise was gripping her hand, looking grim. Harry didn’t look away from her, but he could feel Draco slide himself closer, press a knee to Harry’s leg. It was comforting in its own way.
“But-” someone protested, maybe Dean or Seamus, it was hard to tell.
But it couldn’t be his head, not when it was clearly his magic. Perhaps it was trying to right a wrong. Harry had died, after all. He shouldn’t be alive. The universe was imbalanced, his magic knew it. It was trying to kill him.
“Gryffindor idiots,” Draco said before Harry could respond. Michael was back to looking amused at Draco’s response.
“Sorry,” Blaise said offhandedly, noting perhaps the tension on his friends faces, “but it’s true. They hurt people. Really hurt people.”
Blaise made a noise of protest while Draco, who was halfway to his feet, glared at her. “Look,” Pansy sighed, “Draco can’t get involved – sorry love,” she added directly to Draco. “It will look bad. And dinner is soon, he can’t go down there alone, and Potter can’t go up to the Headmistresses office by himself. It’s asking for trouble. So Potter and I will go bond over arguing with McGonagall, and you two can do whatever you’d like, and we’ll meet you in the Great Hall.”
Perhaps my father going to Azkaban was the best thing for me, really. There is no pressure, nobody’s standards to live up to. Except Professor McGonagall’s. And Andromeda’s. She offered me a place to stay when I graduate – did you know that?
“Not over the summer,” Harry said with a sigh. He tried not to let his mind wander back to the summer, it would do no good for anybody.
His breathing was coming faster, now. He hand’t stared down the other end of a wand since Voldemort; he hadn’t thought his first day back at Hogwarts would find him doing the same thing. He couldn’t think of any spells to cast, couldn’t move all of a sudden. It was like everything in him was frozen and screaming, like the night Dumbledore had petrified him on the Astronomy Tower. Bile rose in his throat and he swallowed it down.
“Right,” Harry said, turning back to the chalkboard to write
“I cannot meet my aunt for the first time looking as if you just ravished me in her garden,” Draco said with a sigh, drawing his hands away from Harry’s waist.
They walked in silence. Harry felt tense, could feel the energy crackling between them. It was almost amusing, he thought. In the Days Before he was so oblivious, he never would have noticed. But in the Days After, every feeling, every sense, every thought he had ever had was amplified.
“That’s what you’ve been thinking?” Harry asked.
“Okay,” Mar said. “I understand that. Like when Draco tells you to be quiet at breakfast?”
“He said she’s choosing eight eighth year students to be assigned two to each Hogwarts house. We’re supposed to make sure the younger ones feel safe, and that the older ones don’t kill anyone, I suppose,” she sighed theatrically.
Harry pocketed the Marauder’s Map as he pet the dog painting that led to Draco’s room. He hadn’t necessarily been lying when he said he knew where Pansy had gone – it just wasn’t exactly the truth, either.
“That’s the same thing,” she sniffed.
“I think it’s different, then,” Blaise said. “You can’t tell me Crabbe or Goyle never killed anyone.”
, even now.
Harry thought for a moment. He had kept in touch with precious few people after the war, preferring to let the world go on its way without him. “Ron and Hermione, of course,” he said. “Most of the rest of us. Neville, Dean, Seamus. Lavender won’t be back, nor the Patils. I supposed Hermione will be the only Gryffindor girl. Hannah Abbot will be back in Hufflepuff, and I heard Ernie and Justin will be back. Ravenclaw will have Michael Corner, I’m sure.” Draco made a noise of discontent, which made Harry grin.
“Harry, I saw an
Did you know Lovegood is my cousin? A couple times removed, but nonetheless. And Ollivander – both are pureblood. Lovegood a blood traitor, perhaps, but I couldn’t see how that made her life any less worthy. And although she was a prisoner in my home, she became my source of comfort with stories of her mother and her life, her friends, her strange animals.
No, the moment the cognitive dissonance stopped for me, the moment when I realized that I no longer truly believed what I had been raised to believe, was that moment when I watched Bellatrix carve the word
They had gone back to the eighth year dorms, after, Draco trailing behind Harry and Pansy. He had been fiddling again with his left forearm, Harry had noticed. But Draco hadn’t seemed to want to address it or acknowledge it, so the group of three spent the walk back acting as though they were all fine. Blaise was there when they got back, and without preamble or discussion they had pulled the mattresses, blankets, and pillows to the floor before the four of them curled up; talking quietly until the early hours of the morning.
“The Death Eater legislation the Wizengamot is pushing through,” he began. “Do you think I’d be able to speak against it at the vote?”
do that, Professor. They all have it out for us, it doesn’t make sense anymore but they do. They didn’t help a single Slytherin last year, not even a first year. Some of them
“Sorry?” Harry responded. “Why is Blaise in the kitchens now?”
“I’m sorry, it was a stupid idea,” he said finally.
I sound far too pompous when writing letters. I do hope you will allow me to apologize in person. I am likely to dither less, as well.
in one column.
from.” Her mouth had twisted in a line, but she looked distraught. And honestly, for someone who was supposedly the brightest witch of their age, she was being gratingly obtuse right now.
They took up their usual spaces, Blaise and Pansy immediately curling up on his bed while Draco and Harry perched on Harry’s bed, before realizing there were two more to their number today. Granger and Weasley looked around the room looking distinctly awkward before Granger grabbed the chair from Zabini’s desk. Following suit, Weasley took the chair from Harry’s desk, turning it around and sitting down beside his girlfriend.
“You will also become familiar with some of the eighth years as your House Guardians. You will meet them tonight in your common rooms, and in just a few moments they will also be responsible for showing the first years the way to their dormitories. You are expected to treat the House Guardians as prefects; they are able to award and remove points, even from Prefects.”
“I couldn’t do anything,” he mumbled into Draco’s lips, hardly aware of his words. Needingto focus on Draco, on his lips and hands and his breath against Harry’s cheeks. “They would send me away, to someone else, who would say the same thing. Until,” he broke off, felt his body shake. Was it fear? No, he realized, it was a sob that he couldn’t let out. “Until I ended up at the veil. Bellatrix-” He felt Draco’s hands falter on his body momentarily, before they resumed their movement. “Bellatrix was hurting you and the others, and Ron and Hermione. It was like I had to
I grew up experiencing cognitive dissonance at Hogwarts. Not an excuse, no – I say this only to be able to describe when the cognitive dissonance stopped. It was not in my seventh year of Hogwarts because the only thing I understood then was that the Carrow’s tortured for the sake of pain. It had nothing to do with ideals or beliefs, so I could separate it from my beliefs. Muggles were lesser, but the Carrow’s didn’t care about that. They just wanted to cause harm, and that was undoubtedly evil.
As it turned out, finding Ron and Hermione was a relatively fruitless endeavour. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t find them, they were seated in the middle of the common room. It was more that they were surrounded on all sides by people who had missed them and wanted to catch up. Harry didn’t begrudge them that, not really, in the Days Before he would have joined. But now – well, no one liked him now, that was part of it. But he was also too shaken from his nightmare to handle a crowd of that size.
“Professor Binns will be there too,” Harry responded, doing his best to dodge the question. The truth was, he
Harry was transfixed on the two of them. Neville had gone ghostly white, Pansy was flushed and shaking.
Draco’s hands strayed, tracing down Harry’s sides, around the curve of his arse, back up to his hair. He stood still, hands on Draco’s waist, letting the other boy explore him, make sure he was intact. “I’m alright, love,” Harry said gently. His words struck Draco out of whatever stupor he seemed to be in because Draco’s hands were fisting in his shirt and pulling him close and his head was resting on Harry’s shoulder and Harry was clinging back to him as if he were the only steady thing in the world – which, really, he was sometimes.
Harry couldn’t help but make a face at that. “Is it so wrong to just want a quiet life?” he asked with a sigh. Realistically, he was only kind of joking. Sort of.
Harry gave him a small smile. “Of course, you great berk. You’re family.”
“That’s bullshit, Longbottom.” It was Pansy, voice firm but body trembling. Blaise was gripping her hand, looking grim. Harry didn’t look away from her, but he could feel Draco slide himself closer, press a knee to Harry’s leg. It was comforting in its own way.
“I’ll write a list of topics,” he said finally. “Everyone can pick one. But I’m not giving you answers or helping you do the research.”
As he looked around the Slytherin table, mostly vacant as students piled around Pansy and Draco, Harry noticed a group of what was definitely first years all sitting closely together, about ten of them, it seemed. With a nervous glance at Pansy, who was still engrossed with the students surrounding her, he made his way over.
Harry laughed to himself. McGonagall had been trying to find out from him what exactly was the cause of the strange dynamic between the eighth years, but he had refused to say anything. Better it come from the mouths of the Slytherins, if they decided to tell her.
Harry nodded numbly but managed to give her a small smile before his feet took him down the hall to Teddy’s room. The boy wasn’t so little anymore and he wasn’t crying anymore either - instead, he was kicking his legs in his crib, rotating his small body towards the door where Harry had entered.
Of course, the Slytherin common room wasn’t at all peaceful when they walked in. It rarely was, but especially now. There were some second and third years playing a loud game of gobstones near the fire, the first years were running around led by Mar (who paused to give them all a wave as they came in). Some seventh years were crowded around a couple tables pushed together, though. They made their way toward them, the boys trailing behind Pansy.
“Potter is going to kill you,” he sighed, but allowed Draco to lean against him.
She sat for a moment, rocking back and forth while she tapped her collarbone as if considering what Harry was saying. “Can I still get my hair cut?” she finally asked.
“Pansy would say something different to that,” Harry couldn’t help pointing out.
“It’s not dark,” Draco added. “The lake makes it seem sort of green. Sometimes you can see the Giant Squid through the windows. There’s always lots of fish that you can see, and your dorms have enchanted windows so it looks like you’re looking outside.”
“Alright,” he said gently. “Well, the older students have a lot of studying to do. Would you be able to hunt for fish outside?”
He let his fingers trail down Dracos body, pausing at the hemline of his sweater. Draco arched up, helping Harry to pull it off him, exposing his pale skin underneath. Harry reached down and pulled his own shirt off of his head.
dilute magic blood. But that isn’t a reason to commit murder. With or without magic, we are all still humans and we can all adapt. I wish this was something I had understood all along. Magic was essential to me as breathing, until it wasn’t. Sometimes the sight of magic makes me sick after all the things I did and I am glad I can no longer use my wand for much.
Harry could tell when Teddy saw him, not because of the smile on his face or the way he babbled, but because his hair turned almost instantly into an unruly jet black.
He didn’t know, though, if he would be coping so well if he were rooming with them as normal. Blaise woke him up during nightmares; Harry did the same for Blaise. They had cleaned up after each other when they’d been sick, spent late nights talking about the past and the future. On one memorable occasiona already, they had snuck Pansy and Draco in and sat up all night with hot cocoa delivered by the house elves when it was all too much.
“I know what you’re thinking – that you would have done the same as Neville. I’m saying it wouldn’t matter. Nothing mattered, that year. The war might have been won, but we all lost. You’d care now; I’d care now. That’s what’s important.”
Later that evening, Harry found himself curled up in Draco’s bed, relating the conversation to him. When Pansy had calmed down, they had gone to the Great Hall for dinner. She had refused to tell the other two what happened – hadn’t wated to talk about it. Draco was clearly upset by this, so after dinner Blaise had waved him away with Draco, said he’d stay the night with Pansy and Harry should stay with Draco, if only to calm everyone’s nerves before the school was filled the next day.
the Carrows showed up, and don’t you ever fucking forget it.”
“Worried they’ll hate us?” he couldn’t see Draco’s expression in the dark, but could imagine the quirked, slightly unsure smile.
McGonagall. It was scintillating.”
It seemed to bring the nerves back in the group – they all shifted uncomfortably for a moment. The boy who suggested the name Mari piped up again, looking distinctly more nervous this time. “I heard it’s in the dungeons,” he said, quietly.
“No one else needed saving!” Weasley exclaimed. “It’s not like the Carrows were hurting pure-bloods. The DA were the only ones standing up to them, no one would have gotten hurt after they left.” To Draco’s satisfaction, he sounded unsure as he finished talking.
That’s why he smoked, he reflected, taking a long drag of the cigarette. Smoking receded the shadows. It calmed his breathing when everything was too much.
Harry laughed to himself. McGonagall had been trying to find out from him what exactly was the cause of the strange dynamic between the eighth years, but he had refused to say anything. Better it come from the mouths of the Slytherins, if they decided to tell her.
He locked his door behind them, casting a discreet
I know it might be hard to understand, but my parents loved me. Truly. Father
The sorting passed quickly – there were fewer students this year than any other year. Blaise, who had actually been watching the sorting, pointed out that Gryffindor hadn’t even been given a single new student, while somehow Slytherin had half the incoming first years.
“I need to go find Ron,” Hermione said after a moment. “Do you want to come?”
Professor McGonagall called
“I have to sneak back up to the table,” Andromeda said as she turned to engulf Draco in a similar hug. “I thought you might like to mind Teddy for the meal, though.”
And then she bustled out, leaving Harry to slouch against the wall until his head hit it with a thump and Madame Pomfrey to give him a pitying look.
He leaned in toward Draco, who shot him a small undecipherable look before putting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Blaise mimed gagging, but Pansy shushed him.
Perhaps we still have much to discuss before we could ever truly be friends. This I understand, and I hope you will too. Of course, you have no reason to speak to me as a friend and I will not be upset should you even go as far to discard this letter without reading it.
but here it is finally!!
That made him smile at her, only slightly. “I think I’m done with any favours of the death sort, honestly,” he said.
also, i promise more smut next chapter ahdksfdja apparently we had to get all the post war trauma out this chapter!!!
He not-so-surrpetitiously rolled up his sleeves, showing his faded Mark. “I’m okay with – learning to be okay with that as a part of me. So hate me, I don’t care, Weasley. But Pansy is ten times the person either of you will ever be. Don’t touch her, don’t even fucking look at her or I swear to Merlin I will
Despite what he said, Zacharias just smirked at him. “We’ll see what your friends will have to say about being replaced by a bunch of bloody Death Eaters when they get here, then.” He turned suddenly and the crowd dispersed along with him, presumably heading to their dormitories as though nothing had ever happened.
“Twice?” Zabini asked, almost gleefully. Harry shot him a dark look.
They were all huddled in Blaise and Harry’s room, as usual. Harry was on his bed, lesson plans for his first years spread out around him along with their introductory essays. Pansy was at Blaise’s desk, the heavy tome open in front of her. She had some complex looking calculations on a parchment beside her that Harry didn’t have enough of an arithmancy grasp to even come close to understanding. Draco was at Harry’s desk, pretending he couldn’t hear them all in favour of his potions book. Blaise was, of course, on the floor between beds.
, felt like home to Harry, especially with Teddy wrapped up in his arms.
“Funny,” he said. “Very funny.”
“It was worse,” Harry managed to say, before abruptly being sick all over the floor. Zabini vanished the mess easily, and dried Harry of the water he had poured on him with an extra flourish of his wand. He moved to sit down beside Harry on his bed.
“So did I,” Draco said mulishly.
Something simple was scribbled beside the title in Ron’s handwriting.
“I’ve been thinking,” Draco said suddenly. Harry turned to look at him and raised an eyebrow sleepily. “You look a mess,” Draco said fondly.
“Right,” Harry managed, reaching for the piece of toast Draco offered him. He didn’t really feel like eating, but he also wanted everyone to stop looking so
The Healer looked harried. “His core is depleted, yes. What I am saying is that there is no physical reason for this. It’s simply in his head. Perhaps he is afraid of magic or no longer wants it and it is reacting in his body, thereby depleting his core. What I am telling you is that there is no fix for it - no potion or spell. He will simply have to decide how he feels about his magic and fix it. There’s no real problem.”
If Andy was here, Teddy must be somewhere – and Harry was torn between desperately wanting to see the boy but not wanting him to see Harry in a hospital bed, even if he was too young to understand what it meant.
“I don’t know the other’s well enough to say. I suppose that could be it. I’m sure Hermione knows who will be back, though,” he shifted Teddy on his arm, putting the empty bottle down. “I’ll go put him to bed now, I think,” he said to Andromeda.
The plan was accepted as the best one they had, although Harry knew it wasn’t, not completely. It wasn’t, because nearby, at the foot of his four-poster bed was his trunk. And inside his trunk was his invisibility cloak.
“She’s not that bad,” he said, when Pansy turned her look of fury on him. “She might fold your socks, though. She likes things alarmingly clean.”
“I- he- you-” Weasley blustered. Granger had her head in her hands. Draco strongly suspected she was crying, but couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Honestly, Potter, it’s like you end up in a different world,” she said. He shrugged, but could feel Draco snickering against his back. Perhaps in the Days After he was a little bit…fuzzy – but it wasn’t him, really, it was the world. The world was fuzzy; too fast and too slow and too hard and too soft and hurt too much and didn’t feel like anything at all and Harry didn’t know what to do with it. He had the strong urge to look up, towards Ron and Hermione, but forced it down. Now was not the time.
“Not really,” she said. “I just don’t understand.”
“Get out,” Blaise parroted, his tone equally as deadly.
Harry ran an almost aggravated, definitely frustrated hand through his hair. “You’re the one who kissed me,” he grumbled.
You three had to continue to save me, of course. I had accepted it, with the Fiendfyre. What a stupid decision, but it was alright. If we were going to kill Harry Potter at least I would be dead, too, and the result would not matter.
“I need to go…” Pansy spoke, but trailed off slowly. “Not be here,” she finally said with a sigh. “Maybe a walk on the grounds will do it. Are you lot coming?”
Draco felt Harry’s hand grip him, perhaps reflexively, but he didn’t look over. He opened his mouth to say – well, he wasn’t sure
“Not over the summer?” Draco asked – and in that moment he looked so vulnerable that Harry just wanted to hold him, although he guessed that that approach wouldn’t be particularly well-received.
He stopped to kiss Teddy, who was now happily in his bouncer in the sitting room, before following Draco to the kitchen. Teddy’s high chair had been moved over to make a seat for Draco around the small kitchen table.
“It wouldn’t matter, you know,” Draco said finally, as they mounted the stairs to the owlrey. Harry shot him a questioning look.
“Harry, come on,” Neville said imploringly. “You weren’t here last year, with the Carrows. And I don’t blame you,” he added, putting his hands up in a placating gesture, “but others don’t all see it that way. They feel that you, Ron, and Hermione – and even Dean, to some extent – spent the year out of the thick of things and left them to suffer here on their own. You had your stuff to do, we wouldn’t have won the war without you, Harry. But being here brings up horrid memories, so not everyone is able to see it that way. But if you’d just talk to them, spend some more time with us, they wouldn’t be so focused on being out to get you. They’d listen to you, if you explained.”
“I’m not going to get any work done here,” Draco said with a huff. “Too small, not enough desks.”
“It’s not even yours-” Weasley, the idiot, began to argue. But Blaise had caught on.
Harry let his eyes wander around the room – belatedly realizing that Andromeda was supposed to be here with Teddy. He felt panic clutch his chest, briefly, when he didn’t seem them immediately. He had been late to the start of the Feast, albeit only slightly – what if they had decided not to come and he hadn’t even noticed. Draco must have realized his panic, because he squeezed Harry’s knee and nodded towards the staff table. Sure enough, Andy was seated near the end, beside Professor Sinstra, with baby Teddy in her arms.
But I cannot say that was true for me. I was not afraid of muggles, particularly, unless you count the belief that they threatened wizarding society. Polluted blood, I was told, would diminish magic over centuries until we would be nothing but muggles ourselves. Except, when you’re a child it is hard to fathom the idea of centuries – the consequences seem immediate. Maybe that was the point.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say to that, except a few choice words that he was sure the Healer would not welcome. However, before he could form a response, Madame Pomfrey spoke up.
“Mandatory even for muggleborn students?” Hermione asked immediately. Harry sighed to himself, nodded at her.
do that, Professor. They all have it out for us, it doesn’t make sense anymore but they do. They didn’t help a single Slytherin last year, not even a first year. Some of them
“Dyke?” Asked Mar, still hitting her leg.
“Zacharias Smith is
The first day of term was tomorrow. Ron and Hermione would be arriving in the morning, which Harry was uncharacteristically nervous about, given the dynamic between the eighth years right now. The rest of the school would be arriving in the evening for the Welcome Feast and Sorting, and Andromeda would be visiting with Teddy as well. They had visited already this week – Teddy had already stolen Pansy’s heart.
“We can,” said Pansy. Together, the three of them led the first years out of the Great Hall and towards the dungeons. It felt good and right and – it felt to Harry like he was truly, completely at home.
“Okay, Mar,” Harry said. He gave her his best interpretation of a friendly smile. The whole group of children looked less scared now, more eager to be here, as if her words and confidence had broken whatever emotions were keeping them scared or subdued.
Suddenly, there was no breath in Harry’s lungs, but he nodded all the same. “God,
“Wow,” Ron snorted. “You really are one of them, aren’t you?”
“Let me disillusion you,” Draco whispered into his ear. He had clearly followed Harry up and was now pressed behind him, bare chest to bare back. Harry shuddered and nodded.
Harry couldn’t help but doubt that – something in him felt off. Maybe it was just his magic being worn out, it probably was, but sometimes it felt like he couldn’t feel anything magical at all. Like the magic in him had dried up.
Harry paused, realizing he was definitely rambling. Ron was looking at him in a sort of bemused way, but Hermione seemed fascinated.
“You would be a sane person, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said, exactly as if he were a misbehaving teenager again. But she looked proud, which was something.
He felt the ripple of the wards as he stepped outside of them, saw the world shimmer slightly and reform. Draco appeared with a pop almost at the same moment, holding the arm of an Auror, who must have side-along apparated him here. The Auror nodded once at Harry, then spun on his heel and vanished with another pop.
