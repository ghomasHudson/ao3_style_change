Harriet rolled her eyes, "Ugh. Why didn't someone give you a new personality for Christmas? You could use it."
Harriet looked up at a friendly faced short woman who seemed a down-to-earth type and Harriet had a hard time imagining her with an arrest warrant.
Whatever. Harriet had more important things to think about. Her mind turned back to the events of the previous evening.
Draco yanked her hands out of Harry's hold, "No!" Harry couldn't understand. Draco's father was right. He deserved respect and he was just protecting the Malfoy line. Draco needed to be better.
Lavender grinned wider, "It so is! I heard it from my Aunt Adenium, who heard it from Bathilda Bagshot, who was childhood friends with the Dumbledore children."
Warnings for Harriet having anxiety attacks over canon abuse and neglect and Dumbledore being an massive asshole.
As Melody led Parvati and Lavender up the stairs, Hermione stopped dead in front of the first step, Harriet ran into her back from being lost in thought.
Also a bit of my own personal headcanon: our dearly departed author had stated in interviews that Hogwarts has around 1000 students, but if you do calculations based on the number of students Harry knows and the relative class size, it equates to about 250.
"Are you okay?" Neville said next to her, obviously the one holding her arm and guiding her down the corridor.
Mother gave Father a complicated look, Draco thought she seemed cross, though her smile never left her face, "Did you know, Lucius? Harry here told us she was nearly sorted into Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally wished to place her there, but Draco had made such a poor first impression, she told the hat to place her elsewhere."
"He must have been truly angry to punish a Slytherin, much less her, much less his goddaughter," Parvati explained.
Harry groaned in frustration, eyes fluctuating between looking at the ceiling and glaring at Draco. Her eyes practically peeling away her defenses, "You're so full of shite. How the fuck are you a fucked up heir?"
Draco flung her arms in the air, "Nothing happened! He did what he thought was right! I needed a reminder! I'm a fuck up as an heir! I needed that! He was doing what he thought was right!"
Plus, she wondered if she was truly done with Dumbledore messing with her life. Who knew if that horrible man would actually back off or not. And what the fuck was that 'I miscalculated' business? She was obviously a chess piece, a tool to him, but why? What had singled Harriet out to Dumbledore, and for that matter, Voldemort in the first place? Was she destined to become some great witch, like Draco and Parvati said all parselmouths were?
The evening after being released from the infirmary and the next day went as normal as one would expect at a magical school. Classes were fascinating and using parchment and quills were novel, though there were points that Harriet missed a good old ballpoint pen.
Draco shook her head, "No! I mean, I am. Interested. Just a little. Only a little." Draco fought her damnable blush, though at least she got her voice under control, "But I can't imagine that happening! Harry hasn't shown even the slightest interest. She's obviously straight. Otherwise I would be interested. Only a little though."
"Your father is-" Mother smoothed a wrinkle that had formed on the collar of Draco's clothes as she thought of exactly what to say, "a perfectionist and an idealist. He wishes very much for an ideal world. He sees problems in the world and wishes to fix them and set things in their proper place. He's always been extremely hard working and passionate. It's one of the things I admire in him. But he's a perfectionist."
"A Smith, eh? I'm guessing he'll be sorting after you, but if he's anything like most Smiths I get, he'll probably be in Hufflepuff. However I absolutely love to send students to houses their families didn't sort into. I'd love to get a Bones out of Hufflepuff, a Weasley out of Gryffindor, a Cornwall out of Ravenclaw, a Malfoy out of Slytherin, but alas. They all choose to follow their families. Speaking of, you would do well in Slytherin."
But Harry was so very very flawed. She knew to a certain degree, Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender were all Gryffindor brave, she also knew that only Harry was reckless enough to take on a mountain troll as a first year and likely dragged the others into saving their lives.
The Pug, the Thug, and the...Harriet still couldn't think up a good something to call Draco Malfoy, either way the three spun on their heels giggling all the way back to the Slytherin table.
Draco crossed her arms more tightly, she could feel her hands starting to dig into armpits painfully, "I just am, okay?"
During their teas, Draco so wished to speak to Mother all about Jiaolong and therefore all her conclusions about Slytherin house's origins and pureblood superiority. She also couldn't speak about her worries and fear of the Dark Lord at Hogwarts. As much as she felt it would be best to get some form of adult attention, she also knew how difficult it was to gain Harry's trust in the first place. Draco didn't want to risk that trust in even the slightest.
Father growled, "I do mind. I was enjoying spending time with my family and would rather not entertain the whims of whatever blood traitor wished to trample over my property and invade my privacy."
"So you know how the seventh year Hufflepuff Tyler Hayworth has been messing with the Lehnsherr twins?"
Hermione crossed her arms across her chest in a huff, "That doesn't even remotely make sense. Why wouldn't the witch just curse the teacher and not the position?"
Lavender nodded, "It's the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. He's more sneaky about it, but if looks could kill..." Lavender shivered.
An odd question, but considering all the accidental magic she performed last night, it probably made sense, "Huh? Oh. I dunno. One time my cousin put gum in my hair and my aunt had to cut it and it grew back overnight. And then one time my cousin and his lackeys were chasing me at school and I found myself two floors up on the roof. Then there was the godawful jumper my aunt wanted me to wear that shrank so I didn't have to wear it. And at the zoo, there was a Brazilian python that was technically British because he told me he was born here though he really wished to go visit Brazil so I vanished the glass on the exhibit and let Dudley and his friend fall in, and then made the glass reappear so they'd be stuck inside. It was pretty funny actually. I hope the python made it to Brazilâ€¦I'm pretty sure the appearing on the school roof was the first I can remember, but that's all of them"
The Gryffindors all looked a little shocked at this though it seemed it was already known by the Slytherins. Milly seemed to sense only surprise and no revulsion or disgust, so she continued.
Harriet unfortunately had to wait to put her prank into action. They didn't have enough beets between the four of them without depleting the stores they needed for class, and had to owl order, which oddly took a long time.
A series of nods were answer enough, and Harriet grumbled, "Now I'm doubly chuffed I won that game." She turned to Draco and exclaimed, "You have to replace him as seeker next year. You're a good enough flyer. You could do it."
Hermione and Milly both seemed a little hesitant to answer, and Harriet said to them, "You don't need to tell me."
What was more interesting, at least to Harriet, was the different perspectives on the whole experience of that evening.
Harriet grinned widely, genuinely happy thinking about a week to explore what Draco's life was like, "Deal."
Which led her to Thought Two, or perhaps One and a half as they were tied together: the no muggleborn rules are obsolete and pureblood supremacy is a lie.
"No no. It's fine." In comparison to the headaches she got from the garlic smell in DADA, or the beatings she had received from Uncle Vernon or Dudley, it was nothing. Plus the solution she was smearing on her wounds felt lovely.
Harry was definitely pleased once again, and said excitedly, "She's brilliant. I'm not sure I'd pass most of my classes without her."
Finally Hermione answered, "I have an uncle who insisted I should have only boy things, mostly clothing. I got so upset about it, and transfigured the lot into pink and purple floral dresses and jumpers and knickers and everything. Not really my style as I learned eventually, but I was just so upset and angry that it didn't matter."
Well either way, it couldn't hurt to make talented friends, and looking further afield had been a good decision. Hell, she had wanted to make friends with Harry Potter since the day she heard the story of the toddler who defeated the Dark Lord.
Harriet and Hermione both laid back down and properly placed the cucumber slices back over their eyes. Hermione explained, "They help to moisturize the delicate skin around the eyes and remove swelling." She added, "plus it's tradition for face masks."
Parvati lifted her wand, definitely no longer calm, "W-win-. Wi-. Win-. Wingardium Leviosa!" And the troll's massive club lifted in the air. The troll itself grunted in frustration, and tried to grab it back, while Parvati waved her wand floating it out of it's reach. "Now what?!"
A mousy haired freckled girl by the name of Melody Hammond introduced herself as a fifth year prefect and directed them to the tower. "If there's anything you need, feel free to reach out. I know it is all a bit much, but you will adjust soon, I'm sure. Gryffindors tend to be a friendly lot and will help out where we can. Though don't trust the boys. They're all a bunch of dunderheads as a rule."
Harriet wondered how rude it probably seemed that the others couldn't understand their conversation. She also thought about how Milly was so attuned to Matilda despite not being able to communicate in words, and maybe that was her own special form of magic. Either way, she might as well translate for the others, especially since it probably was pretty rude having conversations they couldn't partake in.
Harriet started rooting through her chest, and Hermione sat up too, removing the cucumbers purposefully, and helped her look.
Draco had been half listening to most of the exchange before this point, but that made her sit up and pay closer attention, "Killing unicorns?"
Once the final student, Zabini had sorted into Slytherin, the old headmaster gave what technically counted as an opening speech, and dinner magically appeared.
Harry rolled her eyes, because of course that was the obvious reaction to being invited to an audience with one of the most prestigious couples in the magical world, "Yes, yes. About my scar. Whatever. But don't you see! Dumbledore has been messing with him too!"
"People of Indian descent, living elsewhere. And just that I'm glad you're both willing and able to stand up to a person like Draco Malfoy."
After smacking each other around with pillows and having to call Dobby to repair them, a few of them had split and caused feathers to spill across the room, Harry admitted that there was one adult she trusted a bit: The Patil matriarch. It seemed "Dadi" had made an impression over the visit during Yule, and Draco was determined that the Malfoy family could also during their visit. So she decided to continue encouraging tea times with Mother, and taking Harry's lead on what she wished to share. As much as she wished to bring some adults into all the issues with the Dark Lord, Draco was going to play the long game. It wouldn't do to break Harry's trust in any way.
Harriet thought she imagined it for a second, and stared into the orange tinged potion before Boom! Harriet winced at the noise and closed her eyes and put her hands up which was fortunate as she immediately felt wet and sticky and then half a second later her face and hands burned. The potion must have exploded and caught Harriet all over. She was at least grateful she closed her eyes in time. This stuff didn't feel awesome.
Harriet nodded, not quite knowing what got her concerned so much. She thought headaches were fairly common, even if it was unusual that it resided on her scar.
Father looked vaguely nauseated, disgusted. But he grumbled, "Yes. I think you might be correct, Narcissa."
Hermione just snorted, "People are the same everywhere. Minorities are demonized because they are unknown and other. Don't think I haven't noticed I'm only one of three muggleborn in our year, and that is even a higher percentage for the class than normal because theoretically, while the magical world wasn't having babies during the war, the muggle world was."
Draco rolled her eyes and continued curling her hair, "You make it sound so easy. This is the Dark Lord, we're talking about."
"No, but here's the thing," Lavender leaned closer, "They served their detention last night with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest. Don't tell Milly, but something is killing unicorns."
Harriet just felt confused, not by Draco Malfoy being the culprit, but why wouldn't she be punished? She swallowed her bite of sandwich and said, "Uh. Okay."
Hermione paused mid-step, looking a touch green, "Oh god. The Slytherins. Malfoy and them don't know. They don't know about the troll."
Harriet rolled her eyes, "Oh, of course, you would. You wouldn't be the one getting penalties awarded against you."
Harriet woke up gradually. Everything felt fuzzy and indistinct. It didn't take her long to remember the events of only a few hours previous, but all the anger and outrage felt distant and far away. She still felt a little bit shaky and a bit like a new scab, sensitive and not healed entirely. She noticed that someone had removed her glasses, and concluded it was likely Draco. She turned her head on the pillow to take in her softly snoring companion beside her.
They crawled past the Fat Lady's portrait into a cozy common room decked in red and gold, couches looked overstuffed and worn into soft comfort, draped with red afghans. Harriet loved it instantly.
The beets arrived a week before Halloween, and it was decided for maximum impact, to pull the prank when the entire school was at the feast watching.
Harriet took that as her dismissal and bowed a little awkwardly, but said with a bright smile, "Thank you very much, Professor."
Nicolas hummed a little in his throat. There was quite the thriving magical community situated between the two countries. One of his more recent side projects had been helping the muggleborns that popped up frequently enough in both Koreas. He always loved to be there when their town was revealed. Their reactions never got old.
Harry was back to giving her that piecing green glare, "Cause he obviously pissed you off yesterday. What did your dad do?"
After class they spoke more on the subject in the Gryffindor girl's dorm room, decidedly the best place to find total privacy.
I know it was long and a little intense. I mostly want this fic to be funny, but I also want to get a bunch of stuff out of the way so the seven of them can get to the work of taking down Voldemort and being flippant about it in the process.
Hermione continued calmly, "And bravery isn't the absence of fear, it's the willingness to do what needs to be done, despite your fear."
"No. She definitely went to Gringotts with the giant. The day I met her and there was the break in...so she knows she has money. But maybe she's worried she doesn't have access to it? Dumbledore probably has some sort of guardianship, the meddler."
"I actually don't think your chances are all that terrible. She's so stuck in heteronormality that she doesn't even think it's a possibility, but that doesn't mean she's not potentially bent. Plus she has a bit of a weird fixation with you, even further a bit odd as she doesn't really pay much attention to anyone outside of a small handful of people. Just give her time. She's young, coming from an abusive and repressive home. She's going to need time to heal and figure herself out. But personally I think your chances are good that it eventually becomes mutual between the two of you."
Harry, for once, didn't pry. They just took a few meandering loops around the grounds. Outside in the fresh air, the further they traveled from the Manor itself, the tightness in her stomach seemed to lessen.
Draco gasped. Harry was forbidden from the Manor!? Was he going to forbid her from being her friend, too?
"Are you going to get a new broom?" Lavender asked, as Hermione precisely placed the mud across the bridge of her freckled nose.
Then, it clicked. Maybe it was her mentioning the trolls that did it and the immediate reaction to the fear it brought, but Draco's finger halted in mid-air, half curled around a lock of hair. It was one thing that Draco had mused that the Dark Lord was still alive in some form or fashion, all pleasantly theoretical, a fascinating puzzle. But the very real threat she encountered with the troll, pulled this all out of the theoretical and into the very real, very present danger. This wasn't a mysterious broom malfunction and some migraines, this was the Dark Lord actually at Hogwarts! With Hermione also stating it as a real possibility and the source of the mysteries surrounding Harry, fear flooded her veins. "Y-you're serious? You think the Dark Lord is the source of everything?"
Harriet used her recently healed hand to pull the fringe up off her forehead. She pointed to her lightning shaped scar.
Harry waved her hand dismissively. Draco recognized it as one of her own personal forms of flair and it almost warmed her heart, but she still bristled, upset about Harry's ridiculous opinion. Harry said, "Fine. Then why exactly are you a 'bad heir,' whatever the fuck that means."
Said Weasley seemed to shake off some of the astonishment, and said with some politeness for once, going for a handshake, "I should hope so. I'm Arthur Weasley. Lovely to meet you, Harry."
Eventually baby Harriet had calmed down in her parents arms. It seems it only took barely a few seconds before she fell asleep, her parents cooing at her affectionately.
Harriet felt flushed and happy at the small pile sitting under the Christmas tree that still couldn't quite shake the feel of a palm tree. She tore into them along with Parvati and Padma, as they were the only ones in the house of age to be receiving stuff from friends. All the other cousins were either too young or too old.
They had talked about it one of the evenings, as Draco applied Harry's grandfather's hair potion to the beastly birdnest while they lounged on Draco's bed.
"Next is Professor McGonagall. She's our head of house and also teaches Transfiguration. I've heard that you should never challenge her in a drinking contest, if you value your liver, and that her and Professor Snape are good friends."
Harriet was breathing rapidly, in anger and frustration and shouting and everything. It took her half a minute to take in all the occupants expressions of shocked horror. Harriet sucked in a breath, all the rage morphing into fear. Oh god. She shouldn't have said all that.
Thankfully Malfoy stepped forward, "Thank you, Uncle Severius for attempting to find me. As you can see we are unharmed. It seems the Gryffindors couldn't resist throwing themselves into danger for a little heroic drama."
Dadi insisted, in her strong accent and firm grip on her hands, "A beautiful girl should have beautiful clothes. This is right."
An older woman shouted in excitement and hurried to greet them, speaking rapidly in a language Harriet couldn't understand and kissed Padma and Parvati enthusiastically. They both spoke back to her in whatever Indian language they were using, and then directed their attention to Harriet behind them, Harriet recognized her name in their fast clipped speech.
Draco's father huffed, obviously irritated, "I haven't the slightest notion as to what you're talking about."
Thanks again to Anra7777, who reads all my crap before hand, and isn't even in this fandom much anymore.
"Yes, they do, but it's usually relatively simple. Your hair thing and the sweater would qualify, but not teleportation, nor vanishing an object and then making it reappear. That's actually very advanced magic. What were your emotions like at the zoo?"
Draco's jaw dropped open, and her face flushed again. That look, making Draco blush. Harriet felt so satisfied getting that look out of her.
Weasley and Proudfoot looked awkward and Weasley finally said, "You know, Alex. I think we shouldn't bother them. Obviously that was a false trail. We'll leave you and Harry to your afternoon."
"Oh shit! That's the bathroom!" Harriet exclaimed and took off running, the other three at her heels.
Harriet hummed in thought. That might be worth it. But no. "No thanks. Maybe I could get it delivered to McGonagall's office or something."
Lavender nodded seriously, "They had to try and find the poor things so Hagrid could put them out of their misery. They couldn't find what was doing it, but Jimmy said there were signs that whatever it was that was killing them, was drinking their blood. Bite marks and the way the blood was smeared."
They dropped their brooms off at the shed and cleaned up in Draco's room, as it wouldn't do to attend tea with all of their organic detritus. Just as Draco had finished pulling the last twig out of the birdnest, they heard the bell ring.
It seemed Harriet was lost pondering the enigma that was Professor Snape long enough that dinner had appeared beside her bedside table. She chewed the turkey sandwich blankly before she heard some familiar voices and Madam Pomfrey saying, "She's in the back, but don't get her over-excited. She is still healing."
Next chapter, Makeovers! Hermione learns to chill the fuck out! And things get more canon divergent! Harry however does not get less judgemental...
Draco did her typical drawl, and twirled her fork in the air, "Fleemont Potter and the whole line of Potters of course."
"Terence Higgs," Milly blushed and smiled shyly, "If it helps, it was such a good curse, he had to be admitted to St. Mungos."
Nicolas slowly smiled. It really was impressive. Removing the ability to only have one person in the room would destroy the ability for only Tom or whoever he had imperiused or posessed to enter. From there, desire to use the stone was the ultimate stop gap.
Harriet smiled, and Hermione did too, before nodding and with a certain amount of seriousness, she magically dismissed the dust off of Malfoy. The other two Slytherins also agreed with the Thug...what was her actual name again? Well at least the bigger mousy haired girl asked, "May I too?"
Draco looked away and bit her lip. No. No, it wouldn't be perfect. Harry just squeezed her hands gently and said with a slight smile to her voice, "I thought so."
Hermione sighed with weariness odd in an eleven year old, "I asked my parents to send this when the prank was planned. I figured there wasn't much that could go wrong with something as harmless as a bucket of beets," and she waved her arm around at the damaged bathroom, "obviously I was wrong about
Harriet grinned, "Good. Plus it'll be good for you to get closer to Cedric since you like him so much."
Weasley smiled, comfortable and far more open than previously, chuckling lightly "No offense taken. I didn't particularly enjoy being told off by prefects during my time either." Him and Proudfoot both looked at Draco and Harry, each of them holding hands as had been their habit together for a few months. It had just naturally happened as they had walked between classes and Draco half the time didn't even realize she had tucked their hands together.
Draco frowned, but before she could give it more thought, Mother fixed a strand of Draco's hair, tucking it gently behind her ear, and said with a small smile, "We both are perfectionists. It runs in both our lines. For me, it takes the form of making sure you have the perfect life. If you are happy and well, then I'm fulfilled. I would probably show off the Black temper if anything ever happened to you, darling. There is just no helping it. It's ingrained in us. Right to the magic of our core. Either way. I'm glad you've made such a wonderful if...unorthodox friendship. Just don't tell your father."
Pansy grinned, "Thanks. And you really should tell her you know. She's pretty stupid. You won't get through to her otherwise."
Parvati's mother helped Harriet with her hair, using her grandfather's Specialia of course, and helped place some borrowed gold jewelry in the smooth braid. She talked about how honored she was to have Harriet here and how happy she was that she was taking care of her daughter. How blessed and fortunate she felt, and then helped Harriet into the elaborate clothes. And when Harriet looked at herself in the mirror, she almost didn't recognize her reflection.
That got her attention. It might have been one of the few exceptions that made such an early wakeup actually justified. However it didn't make it any easier. Draco peeked a single eye open and grumbled, "You better be serious. I'm not waking up for anyone less than the Minister of Magic."
"Yes! And then when he tried to fight back, Monica Danvers, you know the Gryffindor? She hexed him halfway to Sunday."
Mother's smile widened slightly and then she stood up, her more genuine smile directed at Harry and Draco, "Now. Let's see about that tea. You must be famished. I know you missed lunch to attend your quidditch training. I have been assured Lisky made a few extra ham croquettes."
Until, she was hit in the back and toppled off her broom. Harry and Draco tumbled and landed more or less intact, laughing,Â  thankfully from not too high off the ground.
Nicolas sighed, "Ah. Now I've gone and poked at your hornet's nest as well. Give me a good reason why I shouldn't join your chess board then. What machinations do you have around Miss Potter that has you so riled up?"
Hermione suddenly looked nervous, "Well, no. I mean. I consider myself to be straight actually. But well. Iâ€¦"
To the sound of the Lavender and Parvati exiting the room, Hermione opened the curtains to Harriet's bed canopy. She looked a little strained and stressed, like she hasn't slept well, but said with a certain amount of relief, "Oh, good. You're awake. You should get ready. Lavender picked up some clothes for you from the dorms, Draco." They'd already swapped passwords with the girls, and it wasn't unusual for Lavender to hang out with Pansy alone in Slytherin as they often were required to share whatever the latest gossip was immediately, supposedly on pain of death. None of the other Slytherins would think much of Lavender entering their dorms alone and heading to the first year girls room.
All of this speculation on Harriet's part had a bit of an odd effect. Next Potions class, Harriet didn't react with the same vehement anger at the bullying, and instead just looked at Professor Snape with confusion when he sneered and criticized her for her poor technique at squeezing helius pods, and not warning Neville that he had added his ingredients in the wrong order. She just looked at him puzzled and a little hurt. If he cared about his mother so much, why was he treating her so poorly. She wished could talk to him about her mother. She wanted all the information she could get!
After a rather bizarre cacophony, the girls were encouraged by the Gryffindor prefects to follow them to the dormitories.
The lot of them had agreed that instead of Harriet returning home for the summer, she would spend a little over a week at each of their houses, the summer break time divided six ways. She was extremely excited about the prospect, both for escaping the Dursleys, but also spending time with her friends and experiencing part of their lives.
Parvati said something in that rapid Indian tongue and the old woman nodded and then said in English, "Yes, Parvati should show you where you are staying and so you can feel comfortable. Do you have any food you cannot eat?"
"Why not? You would be great in Slytherin. You could prove your worth beyond your famous name. Find friends to help you achieve your desires. Power to shape your world as you see fit."
Pansy nodded and crossed her arms with seriousness, "There are already quite a few rumors about that. Some seem more legitimate than others."
His student frowned just slightly before beaming once more, but they both knew the damage had been done. "Well I have one that hasn't been breaking into my personal library."
Draco bristled, "I was correct in doing that! She's so oblivious that she barely knows her own housemates! She can't even name a single Gryffindor that isn't in her year, a member of the Quidditch team, or a Weasley! I was being memorable!"
But perhaps the boogie man wasn't so fictional after all. Jiaolong and Dumbledore certainly seemed to think so.
Just as quickly as the pain arrived, it disappeared, leaving Harriet breathless, the turban clad professor was back to his nervous twitchy eating. "Yeah. I'm fine. Just weird head pain. It's gone now."
Harry grabbed Draco's hands again, "Look. Draco. I like your house. And the manor. It's pretty and prissy and a lot like you. I've had a lot of fun here. I like your mum a lot. She's smart, and cool, and a little bit scary but in a good way I think. And she loves you, a lot."
Hermione sighed, "They're muggle hair potions. This one is a cleanser that will remove the color. This one is a shampoo that should be used to remove the cleanser. And this one is a conditioner that will make your hair strong and shiny, which would be helpful considering all your hair has been through. Directions are written on the bottle."
"Fancy a game, old friend?" Albus said with a mischievous twinkle. He continued, explaining the large wizard chess set, "This is the product of my deputy headmistress: a far better person than myself, I must admit. She has been training this particular set for at least a decade."
glad you're here, Harriet. And I support you in whatever way you need." Hermione nodded firmly and then turned without giving her the chance to respond.
Hermione said, "They're probably in one of the bathrooms, if they didn't head straight to the Slytherin dorms."
"The fourth years, right? Billy in Slytherin and Tommy in Gryffindor. Billy is the one dating that one really fit Hufflepuff."
Draco shrugged, "Hufflepuff is last at the moment, and if Gryffindor loses, it gives us a better chance at the cup. Seems a perfectly reasonable strategy."
"You're joking." Draco laughed and then after a beat, groaned painfully, "Oh, Merlin, you're not even joking. You're completely serious," and she dramatically groaned again. Draco had been doing quite a bit of groaning, "And I thought being away from the manor and off to school would be boring. Harry, you can add whatever this ridiculousness is to your magical repertoire. Not powerful, my arse!"
Nicolas hummed, "Are you sure it was her mother's protection of Miss Potter alone? Or just the magical protections of that house and her relatives? I would wager that her relatives might be in more danger, but Miss Potter is in no more treacherous a position than she was previously. She likely had considered them her family and that place her home, however it sounds as if that relationship has been destroyed. I think her mother's protection still remains over Miss Potter, but no longer on her former home and family."
I wanted this fic to be funny and light-hearted!! Why can't I write something funny and light-hearted?!
shown me kindness up until that point. You're a bully. And arrogant for stupid reasons. And I don't want to spend time with someone who only pushes others down to make themselves higher. I had enough of that with my relatives and I'm not going live like that here!"
The Nimbus 2000 arrived at McGonagall's office without incident much earlier, probably because Harriet spent quite a few galleons on the thing. Despite Harriet's appointment as Seeker being a fairly tight secret, word still got out to Malfoy. When she confronted her in one of the corridors,
"Right, Lucius? Draco had made a terrible mistake, but she is in a position to make things better. It is wonderful having Harry here. Isn't it, Lucius?"
As the pudding course arrived and everyone grabbed something, Harriet asked, "Do you know any of the other professors?"
Pansy's exasperated sigh brought Draco back to the present as the girl slid in next to her with a small bounce on the green velvet settee, "You're not spending time overthinking Harry not being in Slytherin again."
Weasley raised his hands up, obviously trying not to offend Harry. "I'm glad you've found such good friends! Really!"
Pansy and Lavender both grinned at each other conspiratorially. Lavender said, "Well if it's information you need."
Hermione nodded and then said with some seriousness turning to Harriet, "I didn't tell them what happened. Do you feel comfortable about that, Harriet?"
Harriet tilted her head, "What happened to the scarred boy in the last photo? He was a prefect, right?"
Harriet tilted her head in mock thought, "You know, maybe you should get a refund. Your face is still sour and nasty. Seems they didn't do a good job."
Despite worrying about all of that, she felt freer than she had in forever. She had never truly had support in her life, and with all her secrets out, all the suffering and pressure and people seeing her at her worst, she still had people who cared about her and stood beside her. She turned her head to take in Draco in all her drooling glory again. Whatever bad fortune she might have had, it seems it was rewarded with what had to be the best friends in the world. They were odd, all distinctive individuals, and sometimes rough around the edges, but they were brilliant and loyal and she couldn't help but think that she must have been Mother Teresa in a past life or something to deserve them.
When they arrived Neville explained what happened and Madam Pomfrey flew into action, directing Neville to guide Harriet to what felt like a cot of some kind.
Harriet's breath hitched when she opened the box and discovered beautifully embroidered cloth, gold thread woven into emerald green in swirls and patterns. She lifted it up reverently seeing that it was a few different pieces, a set of matching clothes of some sort, and obviously of the highest quality.
Harry Potter and all that surrounded her was a puzzle, and Draco felt it her duty to figure her out. She'd always had enough to think about before, between Dumbledore's meddling, the dark magic with the broom, and Harry's trauma living with those terrible muggles. Oh, yes. Draco had read up on childhood trauma and abuse and all such things when she first heard about Harry's home life.
Also Hermione read in Hogwarts: A History that the stairs to the girls dorms kick out boys. She was just nervous it wouldn't let her in. The castle knows Hermione is real girl, unlike what our dearly departed author might think.
"Now now. Here's at least your chance to show off. Show me what your genius has prepared to protect my stone."
Thought One: Slytherin was founded on the premise of building a safe place for traumatized children.
Harry had an expression that was a little gentler, but still had that core of metal, something fierce and almost protective, "Then explain it."
They sat in silence for a bit before Parvati chimed in, "Well...what sort of thing does she care about?"
Harry threw her hands up in the air in frustration, "Your dad hurt you! I'm not going to respect anyone like that!"
"Charming child. He's already taken a shining to one of the muggleborns from the south, Ji-hyun. The spit fire."
Lavender fanned herself in mock heat, "Teddy Waltman is so hot. Why do all the hot ones have to be gay?"
Draco opened her mouth to say something dismissive, and then closed it, finally speaking, "You're talking about the muggleborn issues again, aren't you?"
Draco only groaned and covered her blushing face with both hands, "Anyway," she uncovered her hands and glared at Harriet, the blush had spread further, "You're ridiculously powerful with your accidental magic, the other night was proof alone. Who knows what sort of protective enchantments that office contained? Much less such directed and intentional destruction, and I feel quite honored you decided to craft that protective barrier for Hermione and me."
Harriet nodded, "Seriously. I'd rather he not have even more control over my life. None of it can be good."
Weasley looked a little conspiratorial and said in an exaggerated whisper, "Don't you think talking about Gryffindor taking the cup is a little dangerous here?"
Despite all this, Harriet had been having an excellent week. Charms and Transfiguration were fascinating and fun, and Harriet had real friends for the first time in her life. Things were brilliant! However the fourth Potions class since the 'Sobbing Snape' incident was particularly eventful.
"Wellâ€¦ your father was veryâ€¦ charismatic. He naturally was the center of attention wherever he went. If I'm honest, he had a bit of the personality of a spoiled prince. However he was nearly always good natured about it. Him and your mother didn't get along for a very long period of time. Fought like oil and water, if I'm honest. Lily was much more serious and studious and your father's lackadaisical attitude rubbed her the wrong way. He pursued her, and there were some that might think she had just been worn down by him, but I don't buy that myself. Your mother was an extremely capable witch that once determined, was equally extremely stubborn. I think she just realized she had more in common with James than she previously thought."
"N-no! I do not! I don't care about some Hufflepuff! As if!" Draco stammered and it took a bit, but the blush formed across her nose and on her ears.
Harry shouted louder. Draco was thankful that their rooms were on a completely separate wing than her parents quarters, or someone might hear them. "If anyone hates on my friends, I'm not going to sit still on it! You're too important to me! Hermione is too important to me!"
This spurred at least a half hearted defense, she squeezed her coverlet tightly in her hands, blanching at the knuckles, "T-that's not a fair comparison! My family is nothing like those horrible muggles!" She still couldn't quite pull the same sort of venom as earlier.
Harriet felt she would never forget for her whole life the look on that sour face when she thanked her deeply for helping to get her on the Gryffindor team, Malfoy realizing with horror what she had done. It still made Harriet smile anytime she thought about it.
Draco snorted, knowing exactly what Hermione meant, but answered her question first, as it would be impolite to not get through pleasantries before tackling her goal for the study session, "Fresh has the natural oils that get removed during the drying process, though dried is more potent in botanicals." Hermione nodded and started scratching at her parchment in earnest.
Hermione just looked at the bottom step nervously. After a second she got a determined look on her face and took the step, then another, each bringing a wide, bright smile to her face. She replied back to Harriet, "I'm brilliant. Thank you."
Harry shrugged, "I guess I'm okay. I mostly just like flying and quidditch practices the best. I'm not exactly Hermione."
From the outside, Harriet wouldn't have expected much in terms of size, but the inside had been expanded significantly, most likely thanks to magic. The entrance led to a great room, large and open, with a place to remove your shoes, a sitting area with plush and comfortable couches, a dining area with a long table and chairs, and a large kitchen in the back. Small windows visible from the street were transformed into full ceiling to floor windows, giving the space light and airiness. There were already women waving their wands to send knives to chop tomatoes and onions and wooden spoons to stir pots on the stove. Two small wrinkly creatures with large ears were working with them, peeling and adding potatoes to a large pot. A pressure cooker was whistling in the background, and Harriet was overwhelmed with the smell of spices.
Hermione was still lying on the floor and said a little dismissively, "You do realize we have chests full of all sorts of potions ingredients. Many of the plants can also make natural dyes."
Professor Snape seemed to be weighing something heavily in his mind. It took him a bit, but finally spoke, "Twenty points each to Gryffindor for, as Miss Malfoy put it,
"I don't like your dad. He doesn't like Hermione. He doesn't like me. I've had enough of that in my life."
"And she hasn't got an ounce of femininity and there are days she forgets to put in the hair potion I bought for her. You'd think with how much I got for her, she wouldn't need to skimp. You don't think she would, would she? Like she's worried she would run out? I mean the stock from her grandfather's old company should continue to pay dividends. Unless she doesn't know she has money."
The hat laughed at Harriet's stray thought, "Just because evil has come from Slytherin, doesn't mean the other three don't have it in them. There has been plenty of evil done in the name of good. All four houses produce witches and wizards of distinction, and all have done both good and ill in the world. Also, power doesn't always mean evil either. In Slytherin you would have more options to shape your own destiny. I'm sure that would be appealing to you."
Harriet laughed, putting her arms up to block the pillow in half hearted defense, "I dunno. I think you might embarrass me in front of him."
Lavender looked at the staff table and started down the line, "So on the far left should be Professor Sprout. She teaches Herbology, and is head of Hufflepuff." She continued conspiratorially in an obvious loud whisper, "I heard she's got an arrest warrant in Nepal for roughing up a Buddhist monk."
Parvati looked particularly concerned, though Hermione interrupted, "Would you prefer Harriet over Harry?"
Her father sneered, "Obviously the Potter child is a menace and you have failed to show her any goodness and civility. You failed. I am never to hear of you associating with Potter or any of her ilk again. Never."
"Hmm," Pomfrey swiped the pink looking gel along her hands, and the red boils shrank to nothing, leaving red and angry looking but thankfully smooth skin behind, "And what number would it be for these headaches?"
Nicolas hummed, they had reached the doors of the castle by then, and didn't comment as Albus placed a disillusionment and anti-eavesdropping charm on them both before they entered. Supposedly the children wouldn't be returning until late that afternoon, but it wouldn't do to be overheard by either staff or any remaining students.
I tried my best with British slang, though I apologize if I have a hard time escaping Americaisms. This will be quite canon divergent if you can tell, and there will be a trans character because fuck you Jo.
Lavender scoffed, "Oh, like I haven't seen you enjoy arguing with Miss Malfoy. She'd be fuming to find out you got in the quidditch team thanks to her efforts."
Hermione frowned, "We do what we can. We plan. We figure things out. Make decisions off of the information we have. Then act on it. Same as every other part of life."
Hermione huffed with a great deal of exasperation, "Pull yourself together. Since you like Harriet so much, you need to do what you can to protect her. And since you're ever so clever, that means you've got to pull your head out of the dark crevasse you put it in and think!"
Harriet growled. Ignore her? Malfoy? That nasty sour faced brat? Like hell. She stated as much, "Like I'm ever going to ignore that bitch."
She could see it honestly, as kids with trauma just need safety and security to begin to rebuild their lives. Being resourceful and cunning is just a different way of doing what you need to survive. In a time when muggles and muggleborns were truly dangerous, it would make total and complete sense to create such a place for traumatized purebloods.
Harry's bright, teasing face dropped, as she sat up. It tensed into something that looked almost like anger, distrustful and sour, "No."
"Good. That's very good thinking, Miss Potter. The damage would have been far more extensive otherwise. Good job, Longbottom, to put and keep the cloth over her face."
Harriet growled under her breath, "I hate that man so much," and Hermione squeezed her hand a little tighter. The boys didn't hear her.
Harriet was left a touch bemused at Hermione's firm show of support along with her appearance, "What was that about? Has she been crying?"
Draco has stuttered and blushed a bit before biting out, "Looks like you managed to fix your hair. Next, you better fix your face, Potter."
Draco said, "So, Hermione. I want to get your opinion on something not related to school. Stuff related to Jiaolong."
Pansy said, "I do wonder though, about us being scared of him. Why are you reacting, Hermione? You didn't lose anyone, and yet Harriet who arguably lost the most is the one who couldn't give a flying bowtruckle."
This time of year it formed rows and rows of white blossomed trees. She ducked under the canopy and was absorbed into a tunnel of white flowers and fresh green new leaves, rows and rows of them. Draco couldn't help but laugh at the sheer beauty and joy of it.
"Yes, actually. A young boy, Han-ki. Fortunately his cousin was a deserter so it was simple enough to pull him and his family out of the camps."
Harry won't spend as much time with the Wesleys, not that I don't love them to bits. They're all black holes of friendship. Suck you in and give you love and chunky sweaters. But Harry's relationship with them has been done before and I'd love to explore bonding among the Gryffindor Girls.
Pansy patted her cheek fondly, "Don't worry, darling. I'm sure you'll continue to overthink things, and then react in the most awkward way possible."
Harriet shrugged, "I didn't even know I was a witch, much less that I had a famous nickname, until I got my letter."
"Know any good spells, Hermione?" Harriet asked. Hermione really was a genius, and had definitely learned there was much to be gained from just chilling out once in a while. Harriet was grateful for multiple reasons to make friends with someone like her.
Harriet nodded, a little worried. She didn't expect that sort of reaction, "Is there something wrong?"
Harriet had never felt beautiful before, nor had any clothes even remotely considered nice, much less beautiful. Even Harriet could tell it was too much. But much like meals with the Patils, she had learned that they were generous to the point they would get upset if she didn't seem to eat practically her weight in food. They fussed and worried and never served Harriet that one dish she couldn't pronounce with beans again, when she only took one serving, rather than going back for thirds and fourths. This was probably the same, and Harriet couldn't bear to offend these people, despite this over the top present.
Nicholas clicked his tongue, "Don't be comparing your hesitancy to act on Gellert as the same, nor does it give you the excuse to overact and therefore overreach in response."
Sorry to leave you on that cliff hanger. It might take me a bit to write the next chapter. I'm currently living in the DC area, and a little shaken up by everything going on.
"No. You did. Yes, biological imperative is the basis of much of eusocial magic. It's the root of racism and nationalism and considered an intrinsic part of human nature, but humans are also more than that. The saying is not 'blood is thicker than water.' It is 'the blood pact of brothers is thicker than the water of the womb.' Her mother chose to love Miss Potter, just as others will also choose to love her, and she them. The blood sacrifice will endure. That sort of love never leaves you."
There was a group of about twenty students all late teens. They were grinning and bumping each other's shoulders, and there was one who knocked the tall wizard's hat off another, laughing and smiling.
"She's Desi! She needs to experience that part of her heritage!" Parvati argued with Draco at breakfast, this time at the Slytherin table.
That was a bit of relief for Draco. But still, how utterly stupid. As long as people could sire proper offspring, what would it matter what gender they were. She flipped her hand dismissively and said exactly that.
Draco rolled her eyes, flipping her hand dismissively, "He's a controlling old bat, of course. Who wouldn't want the famous Harry Potter in the palm of their hand?"
Harriet rolled her eyes, under her cucumber slices. Hermione obviously needed to say her bit, but she had learned that Hermione was still going to help them anyways. She was a good friend.
"Sorry, Albus. Miss Potter was already intriguing, you've given your ringing endorsement, and she has taken the first step in contact."
"Seriously. I'm brand new to all of this. And I'd really like to learn. You can have me for Yule next year, and teach me all about my grandfather, but I really want to learn about my grandmother, too."
Draco seemed to have caught herself and stuttered with a sour looking face, "Y-Yes! I'm still quite upset. You missed out on a perfect Yule celebration!" Her nose and the back of her neck were red and flush.
Nicolas hummed his approval before Albus called out, "Fizzy Spangles!" and the royal family and each of the two pawns saluted and moved aside to open a path to the far door.
Albus said with a twinkle in his eye, "I cannot take credit for this. Each level was designed by a staff member. The more people involved, the less of a secret it is."
The mountain troll followed toward the sparks, swatting them in the air as Albus and Nicolas skirted around him and to the next door. As they entered the next room, flames erupted behind and in front.
Albus nodded, "It's a multifold protection. Not only does it prune any extraneous people, there is also a mild potion that lowers inhibitions and encourages people to pull from their desires. Anyone who happens to be imperiused would feel it twice fold and strengthening the next room's protection." He waved his wand over both of them, dispelling the previous charms and casting a chilling charm that seemed to have Albus's own personal magical signature. They then stepped through the fire and into the next room.
Harriet felt like she could have stared at that photo alone for hours. However McGonagall turned a few pages and Harriet gasped. There was a picture of her mother and father holding a chubby and squirming baby.
Draco looked hopeful, "Really?" Then she caught herself and put on a more haughty expression, "Well. I am a catch. Who wouldn't want me?"
Harriet sniggered at Draco's blush that flared across her nose. Draco's embarrassing childhood fixation was still pretty funny, though it definitely answered how she knew so much. Maybe she could learn more about her grandfather's side through her, like she was learning about her grandmother's side through Parvati.
like Malfoy. Ugh. Terrible, right? Well then again no one would suspect that, right? Ugh. Terrible. Liking her? I guess as long as he doesn't name any names."
Pansy rolled her eyes, "I'm not going to ask how you know what sort of things you need to know for N.E.W.T.s as a first year."
The troll turned at the sound, and Harriet threw her other shoe, which also didn't do much, bouncing off the giant ashy head. The troll just looked at her as if she was a curiosity and then took a step forward, lifting a thick arm to grab her.
Draco's breath caught in her throat. She turned her head to look at Harry directly. The girl was still staring up at the ceiling, seemingly distant, but then she turned her head toward Draco as well, piercing her with those big green eyes.
Harriet thought she might have seen one of the black pawns wink at her. She decided instead of asking about that, to speak about her original goal, "Were you able to find anything?"
"No joke. Hayworth is such a sleeze. So anyway, somehow Jimmy Lewis got involved in the fight as well cause those three always manage to go together. It's rather cute actually. Monica, Darcy, and Jimmy. Anyway, and all four of them got detention."
Draco groaned long and painfully, and flung her arms out in exasperation, "Exactly! Hasn't that been Dumbledore's intention the entire time! Why would he send you to those shitty muggles and then keep you there?! Why would he try to intimidate you and control you?! He wants you to feel powerless! Either to keep you down or to control you."
Still, Harry is gaining a maternal figure! Sorry, Molly. You're an awesome mom but you have enough kids.
Father had been home for the day they celebrated Eostre, which was wonderful. She rarely saw her father, and she hoped that she had made a good impression, showing what a properly good host she was growing into.
"There weren't many photos of your grandparents that I could find, during their time at school here, but I was able to find their graduation photos."
Eleven may have been young to properly use such derogatory hand gestures, but if she couldn't have parents, why not take advantage of it.
The raw and open feeling shifted inside of Harriet to amusement. She was successful at keeping her laugh tucked inside so as not to wake Draco, but it hadn't been a sure thing. Absorbing the picture Draco made: all smushed, mouth open, and quietly snoring, Harriet couldn't help but feel a bit more affection for her. Despite their rough start, Harriet truly appreciated and cared for the girl. It didn't stop her from being a pompous prick nearly all the time. Nearly, as obviously sleepy Draco was less than dignified. She really wished she had a camera. Anytime she was acting particularly prissy, Harriet could remember this moment.
Smooth dark hair done in an elaborate plait, deep emerald cloth that made her eyes seem to shine brighter, and gold everywhere, in the cloth and in her hair and on her wrists.
Draco stomped off to the library for her study session with Hermione with a definite goal in mind. As the second most clever witch in the school, the muggleborn had to have some thoughts about all they'd learned from Jiaolong, and she also wanted to get her opinion on the merit of the whole Dark Lord thing. Logically, Draco felt she might be grasping at singing stalks, but everything inside told her she wasn't wrong in this instance and wanted confirmation on her theories.
"I bet you can't catch me!" Draco shouted before dipping her broom into a dive. The folly was built as a replica of the Parthenon, and Draco ducked and weaved between the columns, with Harry just at her heels.
Harriet winced a bit. Maybe she should check up on Neville once in a while. He seemed to have been having a bad go at Hogwarts so far.
Draco humphed, obviously she wasn't going to make any headway with such an uncultured savage. She returned to her original topic, "Other than...the Hogwarts groundskeeper, do you trust any other adults?"
This was the right answer, as Dadi smiled widely and said, "Of course. We'd love to get all three of you in a nice picture."
I just want to say it again, but every single comment and kudos and bookmark means so much to me. Thank you so much! It really helped me push through whatever writing funk I've been stewing in. Yinz are absolutely the best!
Peeves grinned even wider, leaping at the chance to make yet another person miserable, "You can't ignore her. She's all you think about. You write HP+DM in hearts over your parchment. You brew love potions to slip in her fancy tea. I won't tell."
As the others all looked a little worried for them, Hermione hit Harriet's shoulder in rebuke, "Harriet is teasing. Quicksand is a very very rare geological phenomenon. It
Hermione and Parvati expressed their willingness, though Lavender just grinned a little wickedly, "You're going to make such a scene when it arrives by owl."
"I figured something like this would happen," Hermione held out the bottles to Malfoy, who looked at them with suspicion.
Hermione huffed, "I'm still letting it be known that I think the wiser thing to do would be to just ignore her."
Harriet grinned at the jar, imagining the sour look on Malfoy's face with her pink hair, "It's perfect, Hermione. Thanks."
Parvati spoke first, nearly in tears, "Harry! You said your muggle relatives were awful, but I didn't realize it was that bad!"
Harriet closed her eyes, tucking her arms behind her head, making sure the cucumbers weren't going to fall off anytime soon. She muttered, "I just need to find a good prank."
Still Professor Snape's behavior and motivations and Parvati's hand drawn family tree of the Potters and Rubabs were still etched in her mind. The family tree itself had a special place folded reverently in the bottom of her trunk. Despite the less than pleasant memory, Harriet still wanted to have a go at possibly seeing a picture of some of her family, so one evening after dinner, she waved off from the other girls and headed to McGonagall's office.
Harriet joined in, "Obice!" and Lavender and all three of the Slytherin girls also shouted their own spells at the door half a second later.
They had small talk for the rest of dinner, Hermione mostly taking the time to explain muggle dentistry to the other two in an attempt to explain her parentsâ€™ careers, but Harriet had to interrupt.
They stumbled into the room and saw the troll looming over a mess of broken stalls, the biggest pile in the corner was shifting and moving, whimpers coming from inside it.
Harriet felt a cloth placed over her face and a hand tug on her arm, leading her out of the classroom.
Draco held in the tears. It wouldn't help any to cry. Crying was for the weak. Crying wasn't for Malfoy heirs.
"Oh shit!" Harriet dodged under the thankfully slow moving arm and shouted panicked, "Anyone know any spells!!"
Harry rolled her eyes, "Yeah. Whatever you say. Off scowling at all his big important mysterious business."
They were interrupted by Madam Pierce looming over the two of them and giving a cough with the nastiest look Draco could ever expect someone to give. They both fell silent and then mumbled a quiet, "Sorry, Madam Pierceâ€¦"
Whatever level of surprise he might have had, didn't show on his person, outside of a few moments of speechlessness. They probably made quite a picture. The dust was off of them, but there was still wood in most of the girls hair, Harriet noted Malfoy's had a pink hue now that the dust was off it. Not to mention the ruined stalls, and the stench of troll that had definitely not dissipated.
Hermione was happy to explain, "A magical carnivorous plant that thrives in cold damp places. It can be dangerous as it will wrap and entrap anything it can catch. Much like quicksand, the more you move, the more likely you'll be caught and die."
Harriet said with derision, "Money, making sure her cronies are properly laughing at her jokes, her hair."
Harriet nodded and sighed in relief. She figured it couldn't have been too bad or Hermione would be sent up here too, but it was nice to have that confirmation. Harriet felt at her own hair. Not singed at all...maybe Pomfrey put something on it, as well.
Harry looked far too fierce for a tiny girl at whatever early hour it might have been, but she was doing that horrible thing where her green eyes practically skinned you alive. Draco hated that look...mostly.
Harry grabbed Draco's hands, holding them firmly, releasing the tight hold on her blankets. It made the heat that was crawling up her neck from anger, move to her cheeks and ears instead, "Draco. The Dursleys beat and starved me and acted the way they did because 'they thought it was best.' Dumbledore is doing 'what he thinks is the right thing to do.' Your dad might think he's doing the right thing, but that doesn't
Lavender nodded, "Mental, I know. But Jimmy Lewis is reliable. He wouldn't be taking the piss with this."
Hermione explained, "It's a forbidden and illegal spell. It essentially puts another person under your will. Supposedly You-Know-Who was quite skilled at it and used it frequently. Like muggle mind control."
Draco's family might have sided with Voldemort? It didn't sound like it was with much enthusiasm. Though something confused her, as that was the second time she had heard that word 'imperioused', the last being the night before. "What does imperiused mean?"
Hermione frowned, "I wish we had more information ourselves. The broom incident still doesn't make sense. And there's still the matter of the third floor corridor."
Draco shook her head, "No. She doesn't seem the type, plus she's been here for eons. From what it sounds like, the forest isn't her domain. It seemed like the lake was her primary territory."
Professor McGonagall's eyes rose a touch in surprise, but settled into something a little more fond with a touch of pity. "Why, yes. I might have a few in my possession. Wait here a moment."
And thank you for every single kudos and comment. I know I shouldn't use that as the reason I write, and deep down I don't...but god am I still totally blindsided by the love! Yinz are all awesome! For reals!!
Lavender frowned at being denied so strongly, "I don't know. I'm not the witch that cursed the position."
Her heart skipped a beat when she realized there was a familiarity, her grandmother's graduation picture with gold ornaments in her hair as well.
Hermione shook her head, "No, I didn't lose anyone. But I picked up books in Diagon Alley about it. I must have cried for hours thinking about all those muggleborns and all the people who fought him," she sighed and twirled a piece of her hair in thought "though to be honest, much of my emotion was probably also mixed up in worry about being accepted, even with learning about magical Hitler. What was it like for purebloods? I heard some sided with him, but pureblood ideology is obviously not monolithic."
Harry murmured, directed at the ceiling, near silent but still heard clearly "I'm glad I saved you from the troll."
Hermione noted, "And the song wasn't too damning," she gave Harriet a glance, "well maybe someone could place it was you. I don't know if anyone else who could be accused of being an admirer wishing to 'pull Malfoy's pigtails.'"
Harriet flushed from the unnecessary attention, but spotted Hermione sitting in Gryffindor and made a beeline for her. The tiny feeling of regret and potential
Thank you for every single kudos, comment, or bookmark! I deeply appreciate every single one and it makes me feel so very fuzzy and wonderful!
Draco's heart could give out at any moment. She would perish at the ripe age of 11. Her irregular heartbeat and pain in her chest could only be symptoms of a dreadful illness. Death by the worst monster she could think of: Harry Potter.
"Exactly. Dumbledore believes Harriet has some power against You-Know-Who, which is fairly believable considering his disappearance after he attacked her. Dumbledore has long since made it his mission to take him down. If Harriet does have whatever this unknown power is, it would make sense he would wish to use her. Dumbledore is very much working off of the premise of You-Know-Who's continued existence. He wouldn't need her as a tool in the first place if he wasn't. As long as you believe that Dumbledore's not delusional, You-Know-Who is likely still in existence in some form or fashion."
"But in the pictures, my grandmother never wore the...thing!" Harriet worked her hands over her head in what she hoped described that scarf headdress.
"The fifth year Herbology students were working on it earlier this year, but it disappeared over Christmas, and Sprout's got them on something else."
Peeves grinned nastily, "Why Potty? You want me to prank the Slytherin princess? Don't you think she's already paying enough attention to you?" Peeves floated behind her, "Don't you know, the worst thing in the world is to be ignored."
seem to only wish for her friendship and attention after your rejection on the train," and she turned to Harriet, "and
"Draco! Wake up!" said specky bad haired beast hissed in a loud whisper. Though to be fair, Draco felt that any sort of sound was too loud for the moment. She buried her face further into her pillow.
McGonagall nodded sharply, "If you ever wish to hear more about them," she added in a more serious tone, "and you've completed all your work, I'll be here."
Hermione shook her head, "No. Nothing. There's just a great deal of prejudice when it comes to gender and sexuality. Anything out of the arbitrary rules of normality is punished. Nothing to do with magic."
Harry looked thoughtful for a bit, Draco waited for her answer. She knew Harry wouldn't sugar coat or pretend something was okay when it wasn't. Maybe Draco wouldn't be a complete failure. Maybe Mother had made enough of a good impression, "Oh...uh...well. I'd be okay with you telling your mum. But would she keep it a secret from your dad?"
Harry snorted, "Well, just a little less recently. Only a little. You still manage to find the most pretentious way of describing pretty much anything."
"Do you have any particular aptitude in school, Miss Potter?" Father asked conversationally over their breakfast of oeufs cocotte.
Harriet looked at the smiling girl, and imagined a life with her. She caught herself from tearing up too badly and coughed in her hand nonchalantly. Professor McGonagall politely didn't acknowledge it. Instead turning a few pages, to a picture of her mother only a few years older. Her father was equally aged. "They were both head boy and head girl."
Albus called out, "Machintosh's Tooty Minties!" One of the keys, larger and of a slightly different color and wing pattern separated from the group and flew down into his waiting palm.
The hat shouted the last part and the table filled with students sporting red and gold clapped and whistled, one redhead student next to their identical twin cupped their hands and taunted the other house tables, "We got Potter! We got Potter!"
Draco put her chin in her hand, "You're not wrong. But still. How utterly stupid. To be scared about being such a person. I know that...what did you call it?"
"Oh...I mean, I remember being a little worried about you guys getting hit by the debris, but I don't remember the barrier. Maybe instinctually? Like...I felt so angry and felt it all needed to go somewhere, but I didn't want to actually hurt anyone..."
Nicolas laughed good heartedly. She was showing signs that she would likely be in line as a new apprentice of his, if his wife didn't snap her up first. Nicolas sighed internally. He would likely have to concede to Perenelle and let her have the bright and firery Ji-hyun. Happy wife, happy life.
"No, but what if we just dumped it on her head? You know, accidentally," Lavender bumped Harriet shoulder to make the finger quotations.
There was breakfast and classes and Harriet got pulled into some afternoon quidditch practice: all the trappings of an average day in a magical boarding school. Once the girls got some private free time, they also converged on their room in the Gryffindor dorms, Draco and Hermione filled them in about the events of the previous evening. It was fun having the others swoon over the invisibility cloak as it was supposedly unusual and unique. Invisibility cloaks were already rare and special but typically lasted only a few years, much less decades. Parvati theorized Harriet's cloak was so long lasting based on some family secret from her grandmother's family, the Rubabs, as they were magical cloth dealers. Their cloth dealing was what brought them to Britain in the first place, so it was most likely the case. Harriet really didn't want to thank Dumbledore for such a valuable family momento, so she wouldn't, even though it was lovely and gave her even more of a connection with her lost kin.
Albus cast a quick bubble charm and disillusionment charm on each of their heads before he opened the door. He shot out a quick bit of sparks toward the far corner of the room as they entered and the reason behind all the charms had been made plain.
Harriet thought about that. To a certain degree it made sense. She herself had the feeling of just being a chess piece or a tool in the eyes of the headmaster. But something still didn't match up, "But why do you think I'm powerful even without Volde-" the girls all shuddered, "-mort. Sorry. I'll stop. I know it bothers you."
Parvati was the next one to start laughing, then Lavender. The other two Slytherins joined in and Hermione started laughing too. Harriet couldn't help turning her mouth upward. The relief of not being squished to death by a mountain troll, the wide grin on Malfoy's face and wood chips in her definitely less than perfect hair, the absolute absurdity of practically everything. She laughed loud and hard, her sides hurting from the effort. Everyone was laughing and shaking, pausing only to cough from the dust.
Draco was confused, they weren't due for any company. With a quick word between them, Harry and her decided to check out who it could be, and peeked around the corner from the foyer.
After weeks of Malfoy's nasty looks, attempts to trip Harriet both in actuality and metaphorically, and verbal sniping between the two of them, Harriet was more than ready to humble the blonde. Malfoy hadn't tried to pull anything too physical, under Snape's watchful eye, but that didn't stop even a drop of animosity between them.
Parvati placed her hand on Harriet's and said fiercely, "It's not as well publicized among the general magical population, but at least among the magical Indian community we're quite proud of you. When we get settled I'll tell you everything I know."
Pansy put her chin in her hand, mirroring Lavender, "But why would Dumbledore be trying to control Harry?"
I hope Snape didn't feel too OOC. But it wasn't hard for me to imagine that at the first opportunity to get drunk, he'd feel overwhelmed with seeing Harry for the first time. Plus Minerva's scotch is reliably good and strong.
There was a beat of thought, everyone knowing this was an important moment. Harriet held her breath.
Seamus replied, "It could be just Peeves, but wouldn't it be great if someone managed to get those smarmy Slytherins? You girls know anything?"
When they turned to Milly for her turn, she said with a touch of nervousness, "We were neutral too...sort of. I'm half blood."
like her. She was arrogant and mean and had the most sour expression marring a pretty face. She could go to hell for all she cared.
She forced herself to turn her thoughts back to Jiaolong to Thought number Three, which was the most concerning but also the most tenuous and with the least amount of evidence, and yet Draco couldn't quite get out of her head.
As they crunched up the path to the castle, Albus politely inquired, "So how is the DMZ, my old friend?"
She spotted Hermione setting up at their usual table. Draco figured they'd probably be working on Potions today as Uncle Sev had given them quite a bit of research required for the next class, and Hermione already had their potions work out in front of her.
Albus frowned a little deeper but Nicolas just tutted again, "Now now. Don't sulk." He chuckled good naturedly before continuing, "You want to use my stone to bait out Tom, but I myself would be too big to be trapped in your web. Tell me what has you so miffed, my young friend."
Pansy said, "I also heard something else," she hesitated a bit, "Dumbledore is also planning to attend."
Harry shrugged again, sounding a touch pitiful, "I dunno. Spout's okay too, I guess. I mean, everyone else is theoretically under Dumbledore's control. And as good nature as Hagrid is, he and the whole lot of them would all report to him. I can't really trust anyone in that school."
Lavender nodded, "One of those my brother told me about, the dark, broody one, Professor Snape. He teaches potions and is the head of Slytherin and favors them. He couldn't be more obvious. Did you piss in his tea or something?"
The mood of the girls all dropped, as if the temperature of their little space was suddenly ten degrees colder. The Gryffindors boys though, seemed to still be in their own tropical bubble.
Harriet giggled a bit and then opened her mouth to say something more but whatever else she was going to say was interrupted as Matilda. She seemed to have been taking a nap inside Milly's robes, and slithered out, giving a wide yawn, "What a niccccce dream."
She wondered if there was going to be any fall out from her explosion at Dumbledore. God, hopefully all that stuff she inadvertently destroyed wasn't particularly valuable. But she was just so...angry! She remembered the feel of it rolling, burning, and ready to destroy. And as much as she absolutely hated that man and what he had done to her life, she wasn't out to kill anyone. All that feeling had to go somewhere. Well, at least if any of those trinkets were particularly valuable, her parents left her some money...but she also really didn't want to give Dumbledore a single knut for all he'd done. She thought, with an audible sigh, for how her life managed to work so far, she wouldn't be shocked if her little tiff drained her Gringotts vault. Murphy's law often seemed to reign supreme, or at least she had a combination of both the world's best luck and the world's worst luck. Ugh.
Draco wished that she could understand parselmouth and that there was some possible way to communicate with Jiaolong and ask difficult questions that wouldn't involve that horrible beast with eyes so arrestingly gorgeous they could commit murder...and she wasn't talking about the basilisk. Ugh. Why did she have to be so adorable!
Malfoy looked at Snape, seemingly to see if all this was safe. He nodded just slightly and she took the bottles from her with wary curiosity. "How do you have all this?"
Now, back to the topic of Slytherin and pureblood supremacy. There was probably nothing wrong with making powerful friends and allies per se. There is certainly merit to her parents wishing her to make friends with those destined for Slytherin, as it can't hurt to have talented allies and Slytherins seemed to sport more. But then her new friends in Gryffindor were talented in their own right, and she couldn't exactly call Greg or Vince the cream of the crop exactly.
Albus was practically mirthful, "The stone is inside. It is so well protected in fact, that neither you nor I can remove it."
And poor Hagrid. His hut is going to burn down because no one will help him with the Norbert situation.
They had a proper tickle battle in which Harry produced plenty of undignified behavior of her own. Draco obviously won, even though Harry managed to find most of Draco's weak spots but Draco found most of Harry's too. And though Harry didn't exactly cry defeat and they only stopped because of mutual exhaustion, Draco still won the battle. She found
McGonagall hummed, "That set is a product of my own creation. It's good practice if you're more of an experienced player. The black pieces will play a defensive game and the white an offensive game. I originally created it to help teach beginner's chess, but it has learned and improved over time. Now I myself lose to it about half the time."
Draco breathed out in relief. Her mother had always been a true Slytherin. She knew exactly how to get the outcome she desired, and would do what needed to be done to do it. She saw how important Harry was to Draco, and with Harry's ultimatum about visiting the Flamels in place, she was sure her mother would keep it a secret, even to Father. With as much confidence as she could muster, she answered, "Yes. She would."
