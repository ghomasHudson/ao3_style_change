"You try being a jaguar trapped in a room with nothing else to do. In sorry okay?" He said back.
Harry was determined not to get up until 7am, because Ron and Hermione were the only Gryffindor's staying, so The Golden Trio had made plans to meet in the Gryffindor common room and spend Christmas together. And 7am was when they were meeting. Harry now, however, had all 6 Slytherin's trying to get him up, and it was fast getting annoying. So, yawning, he stood up and stalked down into the common room and curled up in front of the lit fireplace. He decided that he would leave the common room when the Slytherin's were opening their mountains of presents.
Hiya! I have rewritten the first three chapters and will be doing the same with the rest. There have been no plot changes, just written better. This chapter is the first pass, so isn't the best. I will hopefully have it rewritten before the next chapter is up. Enjoy!
Just past midnight the next morning, a flying motorcycle touched down in an average neighbourhood in Surry. A man exited the vehicle and took a bundle from the sidecar. Two other people, wearing funny-looking clothes, were stood waiting for them. The older of the two stepped forwards, taking the bundle from the large man and patting him on the shoulder. Leaving the others alone, he took a letter from his pocket addressed to a Mr. and Mrs. Dursley.
He stood and made his way to the compartment door, looking over his shoulder he said, “This affects others too, I’m going to collect them.” Not giving them time to protest, Hadrian walked out of the compartment, and right into someone. “Sorry.”
"Who are you talking to?" That was Blaise.
Harry could barely think through the pain, he was just hoping that he would be out of here before he was killed. Vernon’s sweaty body pressed against his back and the grunts coming from the much larger man, would probably haunt Harry’s nightmares for months. The metal was biting into his wrists as he fought to get free. However, the only thing that he could think of was the feeling of Vernon thrusting into him, ripping him apart from the inside out.
Professor Albus Dumbledore needed some jaguar hair for a locating potion that he was making to locate young Mr. Potter and now was the best time to do so.  It takes about two days to brew and another 10 hours to work. All of the students and teachers would be home by then so he would be alone to find the boy.
Petunia nodded her head, ”Yes, they are.”
Harry became withdrawn after the incident. During his time in Japan, he did not speak to one of his friends. The teachers were becoming worried. None of them understood what had happened.
“Oh! Hello Lisa.” Luna didn’t even ask what he wanted just followed him to where he knew the Gryffindor sixth years would be.
"Dray? Are you okay? You look like you're in shock." Pansy asked, looking at him worriedly.
Today was no different. At 6:30 on the dot, there was a knock on the door. The door lock slid out of place and Harry got out of bed. Walking into the kitchen his aunt silently unlocked the back door and let Harry out like a dog. Harry would be locked out until he dried off.
Later that day both boys could be found in the manor gardens, Draco had decided to go to Diagon Alley tomorrow to get some charms for Hunters plain collar.
Hadrian turned at the sound of the door opening, and was shocked when the blonde began to speak. “I don’t think that we have met before, have we, Mr. Potter.” She said before taking a seat on one of the stools.
Draco came up the stairs when he heard the cries, and stopped short in his tracks. He turned and glared at Hunter, then asked, "What the heck? Why?" Hunter just yawned and curled up on his bed and pretended to be asleep. He heard a voice he knew all too well. Snape. Snape, who hadn't seen him before, seemed in shock for a few seconds until he lifted his head and looked the professor in the eyes. That was enough to snap him out of his shock.
Dumbledore.
Suddenly there was a chorus of "Happy New Year!" from Hogsmeade as the clock struck midnight. Just as the voices began so did the fireworks. It was a magnificent sight.
you get caught?"
"Thomas, Dean."
"In an abandoned classroom with Pansy's, at least, until the morning." Blaze answered.
~~~~~~~
Harry then realised that he hadn't told his friends. A cold dread flooded through him as he waited for the occupants of the room to fall asleep. He came up with a plan in his head. He knew it was bad and with his luck would go terribly wrong, but he had to try.
She turned the light on and looked at the clock. 7:30. Vernon always came down the stairs before eight, so she knew she didn’t have long to wait. Pulling one of Dudley's old books from their box she began to read. Before long she heard the unmistakable sounds of Vernon stomping down the stairs. Sighing she rushed to put the book away. Vernon made an appointment to see the doctor about the issue she had been having, mumbling about checks while he went.
After telling Draco that he’d see him later, and not too worry if he had to stay as he had a plan (which he didn’t), Harry left to go to Surrey. Changing into his human form around a corner, Harry made his way to the wall that would take him to muggle London.
“It's all your fault boy!” the man growled dangerously.
“I learned when I was little,” He replied simply, not wanting to talk about his past, “Shall I make breakfast for Draco and Mr. Malfoy too?” Hadrian asked, successfully changing the topic of their conversation.
It looked at him in shock before responding,

“We need to get a few other people first.” Hadrian said walking to the next compartment.
"But my animagus is a jaguar not a damn tortoise!" Harry said back. This was all a weird experience.
“Nauny and Morfran, my grandparents, Neva’s parents, gave them to me.” He explained before looking around. Everyone seemed to be both in shock and lost in thought. “What time is it?” he asked Amaia.
Harry thought,
~~~~~~~
Twenty minutes later, Hadrian and Draco were in their new lounge decorating. Once they were done, the room was now arrayed in blues and browns. A sofa and two armchairs surrounded a coffee table in the centre. Four doors lead away the lounge. One was to a dining room and another, the kitchen, which had an island that you could sit at in the centre. Both rooms were done in light coloured woods, which they both liked so decided to leave them as they were. Through the other doors there were two bedrooms. Both contained a king sized four poster bed, a large closet, and two, three drawer bedside tables. The boys did their own rooms in neutral colours. Keeping the rooms to their own unique styles.
I’m so sorry that this has taken so long, I’ve just been really busy. Anyway, I think I have to clear up a few things, I will be summarising certain parts of the story so it’s not stupidly long, I also now have a timetable for writing the stories, and I’m going to be starting some new ones. So chapters for this story will be posted about once a week. But no promises, I’m unpredictable. Also, Veela come into their creature inheritance at 16, but only need there mate after they see them for the first time after their 17th birthday. It’s confusing I know, and I’m sorry, but it’s the only that it will work with this story. Otherwise it wouldn’t make sense. The name Mi, when in reference to Hermione, is pronounced like Maia. Andromeda is older in my story than in canon, she is 12 years older than Bellatrix, I know that in canon Bella is the oldest, but I've changed it, she had Nymphadora when she was 17, just after she was married to Edward (Ted) Tonks. So by that theory, and the others I have messed with, which you’ll see in the story, she Tonks in 3 years younger than the Marauders. Just to warn you apparently my laptop doesn’t see Harry as a name, so if there are any written without capitals, please let me know, thanks. I will be referring to some characters by different names towards the end, I’ll put who they are in notes. Anyway, I’ve done a little key to help you understand what italics and bold mean. Italics don’t just one thing though, I think you’ll pick it up okay. Most of my own characters will be added in this chapter, any others I don’t add will be ones I haven’t thought up yet. Sorry that this has gone on so long, it needed to be said.
Vernon’s face was going red. “WHAT!” taking a deep breath in an attempt to calm down, he made a mental reminder to find a way to control his anger. “I am not paying for that freak to go to a private school.”
"I know. It's just I was… distracted?" Harry replied before carrying on with his tale, "And transformed I didn't realise that there were hunters in there and when I heard one it was too late."
Draco didn’t know what to do. He was glad that he had put up those silencing charms. The screams coming from Hadrian were bloodcurdling. He wanted to help his mate, but didn’t know how to. The younger boy had curled into a ball in the corner of the room. He had an idea.
"How'd you get caught, wait MALFOY!?" Ron whispered loudly as what Hermione said registered in his head. Both Hermione and Harry rolled their eyes at that.
“Sorry does not even begin to cut it, Draco.” He replied. “I am trying to pull this family out of the black hole that your father decided to put us in and you make a move that sucks us back even further!”
Realization dawned on Draco’s face. “The gold would react with the Ashwinder eggs, creating memory loss.”
body pillow.” He snuggled the blonde to make his point.
“I highly doubt that.” Harry plopped down across the table from the blonde.
Narcissa began pacing the room again until she heard the sure footsteps of her son and his guest enter the room. Draco strode forward and kissed his mother on both cheeks.
“Would my name show up automatically?”
“The last time you said it was nothing, it turned out to be a something. A big something.” Hermione’s expression softened. “Are you sure he’s not—”
“I mean, I had understood that Malfoy is a reformed person, but seriously,” She snapped open the folded paper. The main image on the front page was Harry and Draco molded against one another. “what were the two of you thinking? Harry, you run a foundation that helps children and families affected by the second Great War and Draco is Deputy Head Solicitor to the Wizengamot.”
There was click and a flash. Harry squinted up at Draco and another
Harry smiled up at Draco. “It does make me happy.”
"Draco, you could be cruel but you could never be
“First up is a lovely Muggle named Hals Stewart. Potter’s first foray into dating someone of the same sex. Harmless and mind-numbingly boring.” Draco could practically hear Pansy roll her eyes. “Then Justin Finch-Fletchley. Again, harmless. Just a simple fling that maybe lasted six weeks. The last, before you, is by far the most interesting. He and Harry were together for almost two years before they called it quits. A Mister Reid N. Praetor, ultra-successful Gringotts investment banker. If I wasn’t positive that you were an only child, I would’ve said he was your illegitimate brother.”
“Seriously, Harry James Potter, what are you thinking?” She smacked him in the chest with a folded copy of the
.one.
Harry looked down at the label on the inside of the suit. “Burberry.”
He turned around to find Harry standing behind him, a delicate blush playing across his cheeks. "Hello..." He murmured.
“It’s still hot?”
“I see.” Quentin tapped the pen against his lips. “So, you, HSW Cristler, and DHS Mogin headed from the elevators back to your respective offices. Are they near one another?”
“This is Coldplay.”
“I shall follow you, oh fearless leader!” The blonde bowed deeply.
“I may have dug a little bit into your background after you said you wanted to remain married.” He slid down on the sofa. “I mean, is it wrong of me to want to know a little more about you?”
“Absolutely not!” Harry dipped even lower in the bath. “I know what that thing is and I’m not going to let you take a photo of me in the bath!”
Harry smacked Draco in the chest. “Don’t be a jerk.”
“Oh, Merlin...” Harry groaned as he slid off the bed.
“Quentin Linley, lead investigator on your case.” His voice gravelly.
“I don’t understand…”
Harry propped himself up on Draco’s chest. “I have a perfectly acceptable set of robes in black.”
“I… I…” He turned his hands over and they were stained with blood. “I s-s-saw—”
“Medina?”
“I suppose that could work…” Harry slumped in his seat. “What about this? How long do we let this go?”
The tips of Harry's ears went red. "I am
“Understandable.” Draco scraped the remains of his breakfast onto a slice of toast. “I would assume the little things would seem very vague when you have a homicidal maniac after you.”
you."
“I can handle being the most hated wizard in the United Kingdom for a while.” Draco replied.
“Do you… never mind…” Harry sighed and set a plate down in front of Draco. “Enjoy.”
Harry pulled away from Draco slightly. “Coldplay is a Muggle band.”
“Highly impressed?” Harry snorted.
“So you left the Courtrooms on Level Ten and headed back to your office on Level Two?”
“You don’t remember her gung-ho attitude about freeing house elves in school, do you?”
"When did I," He gestured up and down. "ask for this?"
“Thank you…” He sighed, rolling over.
“Draco…” Harry groaned and squirmed in Draco’s arms.
“Duly noted.”
Harry recalled the pleasant soreness he had woken up with. “Well fuck...”
“But why?”
“What was that?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Why you ask? Why are we in the horribly decorated room?” He held up his left hand. “Tis because we are married.”
“I’ll try not to be.” He pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple. Pansy and Blaise made a gagging noise. “Oh, stop it, he’s my husband. I’m allowed to be disgustingly romantic.”
“I do not!” Harry objected.
Draco groaned. “I can fuck it out of you.”
“Fuck…”
“Were they upset?” Quentin tipped his head to the side.
Draco watched as Harry made his way towards the dance floor. He watched as the brunette gyrated to the beat. Harry crooked a finger at the blonde, wiggling his hips. He watched as the brunette rolled his body to the beat. Running his tongue along his top lip, he moved his body in the same pattern as Harry’s. They moved together, Draco wrapping his arms around Harry’s lithe body, pressing their foreheads together. They sway to the thudding beat, bodies undulating against one another. Draco smirked, bringing his hand to rest on Harry’s cheek. The brunette tipped his head up, nipping at Draco’s lips.
bed.” Harry corrected. “With the way Hermione and Pansy have been popping into the flat lately, I think it would be wise if I just continued to sleep in here.”
“Is he?”
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. "At Ron and Hermione's dinner last week."
“I’m sure that you do.” The blonde wizard smiled. “But you’ll have a very nice navy set here on Thursday.”
Potter stood, snatching his shirt and suit coat from the floor. “Then we go to the Hall of Records.”
Harry nodded solemnly. “I think that would be wise.”
Harry sat, running a hand through Draco’s hair. “Who would think I don’t belong to you?”
Ron started pacing again. “What’s his performance like?”
“Draco?”
“Well, if you need it, it’s available to you.” Draco replied, leaning against the door. “Are you sure you’re alright? I know I was a bit… over enthusiastic… last night.”
“Someone please tell me what is going on.” Harry demanded. “Tell me what is going on!”
“I am nobody’s wife.” Harry scowled.
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “The other option is to use intercourse to force it out of your system.”
“Technically.” He replied nonchalantly, swapping places with Draco. “Rinse.”
“Yes.”
“Draco…”
“I shall have to tell Medina you approve of her shopping choices.”
Imogen spoke up from the back of the room. “What do we say to Mister Potter?”
“The Malfoys are an old house.”
…” Draco said through clenched teeth.
“So, I shouldn’t know where the money is going within my own foundation? That I should wait until it’s been tidied up in the board report?” Harry sighed. “Will you make sure they’re still included in my weekly packets?”
.” Draco repeated with more enthusiasm.
“He was, but he was promoted to the Head Solicitor when Mortimar retired.” Draco replied. “He actually recommended me for the position.”
Draco was instantly treated to the mental image of Harry in a Slytherin uniform, spread out across one of the dormitory beds, a look of smug satisfaction playing across his elfin features. “Oh, I can imagine.”
“Thank you.” Harry snorted. “That’s honest of you.”
“You know what you look like.”
Children that had been born into safer environments. He sighed, running his hand along the space of new faces that had been added in his absence. He smiled and continued his way into the office proper. He watched as employees and volunteers tending to families, ushering children into the playroom while their parents worked through their paperwork. He walked briskly into the playroom, running into Imogen Wyles-Dobbins, the nursery supervisor. She was a sweet woman in her late fifties, hair already greying at her temples.
"There was a zipper? Why didn't you tell me there was a zipper?"
“I’ll bring him round, Lydia.” Harry called from down the hallway.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “A full English breakfast?”
“You forget what I do for a living. Accessing records is in my job description.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “And fourteen drunken disorderly citations in the last two years is a bit excessive. Had I known you had an issue with alcohol, I wouldn’t have let Pansy talk us into going out.”
“Then feel free to be early.”
“I’ll let Harry know.” He shook both their hands. “Thank you.”
Draco lifted him to the bed easily. “The potion is supposed to make you more docile.”
Draco couldn’t focus on the conversation going on around him he was getting tired and knew that he would need to go to bed soon. Realising that his eyes had fallen closed he snapped them open again. He noticed his parents watching him and smiled at him.
Draco thought as his father walked into his room.

“We’re going to the chocolate factory for Popkin. We know how much food there is, you can have a slice of bread and an apple. After you have completed half of the chores on the list that is on the kitchen table.” His Aunt said, before joining her son and husband at the car.
The hospital had called her uncle to come and pick her up. When they got to Privet Drive. The teen was locked in the cupboard and the dog outside.
"Longbottom, Neville"
Harry nodded and followed Morfran and Nauny out of the house. They took him to a small apartment on the outskirts of Little Whinging and let him view the memories, they left to go into the kitchen to give him some space.
“We have some memories that were taken from you and your friends about 16 years ago,” Hadrian explained as he retrieved the memories, “you might want to see them.” Snape just nodded, standing to grab a pensive. He put the memories in, and began to review them alone.
Seeing that the fireplace was lit he looked around the room. Once he had assured himself that no one was there, he sat in one of the oversized armchairs and began to read.
"It's about Harry, Albus he has not come into school." She said looking worried. Albus always knew that she cared for the boy, he just hoped that it would not get in the way of his plans.
About an hour later Harry heard a crack. He looked at the egg and, sure enough, there was a mini basilisk's head slowly coming out of the egg. He decided to try and talk to it,
Nodding, the teen thought over the names her mother had said. “Theophania.” She said slowly. The name had called out to her for some reason.

When she stepped off the bus, she walked to the guide dog training centre and paid for all the additional training that would be needed. They told her that they assumed that he was a semi-trained guide dog, from the way he responded to the commands. She was told that she would have him by the end of the summer.
Harry felt a jolt of pain as his arm was tugged, pulling him up. He was dragged up the stairs and into the master bedroom. Vernon threw Harry on the bed and locked the door. grabbing a box from under the bed Vernon began to smile. Harry began to panic. What was going to happen to him? Vernon opened the box and removed a pair of handcuffs. Vernon flipped the boy onto his front. Ripping the boy’s shirt from him, he cand cuffed one of his arms to the bed. He walked back to the box and retrieved another pair. Harry's other wrist was cuffed to the bed and he began to panic. He felt his uncle remove his underwear and cuff one of his legs to the bed. Grabbing the other set of cuffs, Vernon finished what he was doing.
“Mr. Potter?” The woman asked, when he nodded, she continued. “My name is Nauny, and this is my husband Morfran.”
"Yes?" Draco replied politely.
"Yes." She said, seemingly calming down a bit.
This happened all summer usually two to three people, then Vernon, a day. Harry was only allowed off the bed to shower in the mornings. He was hand-fed by Vernon once a day. If he remembered.
Are you ready Harry?" she asked and when he nodded his head she cast the spell. There were six pulses of magic and then nothing. He felt normal again and looked down at himself and saw that he was, luckily, in the robe he was in when he was turned.
Draco opened the door and greeted his friends, "What was it you wanted?"
Hermione released him apologising then asked, "What Happened to you? Why are you Malfoy's familiar? Why didn't you tell us you were an animagus? When did-"
Harry said, before turning back into Hunter and running to the potions classroom.
Waking up he heard a hushed conversation between a teacher and the students that had done this to him. ‘He’s mad! I heard his class talking about it. His other schools for mad people.’
Opposites Attract.
The next day, Vivienne went to the local shelter with Sirius. She told them she had found a stray and wanted to adopt it. They looked shocked but allowed her to adopt him. Heading straight to the local guide dog training centre, she did as her doctor had instructed. When she got there, she booked Sirius in for training. Putting his name down as Padfoot. She would pay them at the end of the day when they had conducted their initial assessment. Pulling her wand out, she called the Knight Bus.
“Mi?” both Mi and Ron asked.
Two weeks later saw Harry, Dudley and Petunia sat outside of Annette Marcus’ office, waiting to be called in for their exams. They had been there for just over an hour, and Dudley was beginning to get restless. Looking up when they heard a sound, they saw a stern-looking woman appear from the office.
The teen sat on the bed and put her head in her hands. Of all the things she thought were going to happen last night this was not one of them. She knew it was possible, of course, but had never imagined it would happen to her. Veela were born the way they would be if they were human. It was only on their sixteenth birthday that they would change. She laughed lightly to herself. She figured that the compromise was that she looked like her mother.
An hour later Mr Malfoy was sat on an overstuffed chair in one of the many rooms in the large manor. "I have your new familiar Draco, an extremely rare animal. They however didn't tell me where he was from." Lucius said continuing as his sons eyebrows rose in question, "He is a Black Jaguar. It would do you good to read up on them tomorrow as the bonding ceremony is the day after."
Harry sneaked down to the dungeons, and straight into the potions stores. He left 5 minutes later with the required dittany leaves. He somehow managed to get back to the chamber without any problems and feed the snakes the leaves, he explained that he would need to leave for the summer in two days. They were disappointed that he was going to be gone, but not half as much as Harry was. On his way back to the Slytherin common room he bumped into none other than Albus Too Many Goddamn Names Dumbledore,

Harry Potter had never been so happy. For the first time in his life he had friends. By the time he was ready to go back to the Dursleys he couldn’t keep his smile off his face. That didn’t go down well with Vernon. The minute he got through the front door, the large man asked Petunia to take their son and leave. With a sharp nod, she picked the screaming child off the floor, promising him chocolate and anything else he wanted.
Hadrian is Harry and his sisters are Eleanora and Luna- Children of Neva and Tom Riddle.
"What are you going to do to them?" Neville asked, his curiosity taking over for a moment. Fear was evident in his eyes however when Harry began laughing.
Within the first week at his new school, Harry was told that he would also be attending an external school for half his schooling. His teacher explained that he would be being examined throughout his few months there to ensure he went to the correct school.
Today was the first day of lessons at Hogwarts, and Snape came into their room to give them their timetables. Before he left he reminded them to leave for their classes, which begun in ten minutes.
At that moment Draco began to stir, and Harry already felt protective. He knew to just give into the bond and so that's exactly what he did.
Draco had thought about this all yesterday and so already had a name picked out. "Hunter." He announced clearly. After that the blood was but onto a collar for Hunter and a bracelet for Draco.
"This is Bullet, my familiar. His brother is Goyle's familiar and his pack is Pansy's, Theo's, Blaise's and Goyle's"
Harry asked
The boy in question had frozen to the spot. He watched in horror as the man stood and struck him across the face. He fell to the floor. And curled into a ball. Slowly, even though he was still being hit, he uncurled himself.
A few minutes later Marley slithered forwards and went to Draco, silently letting them know that he was going to act as his familiar. Hadrian asked the other two to company them, and together they left the chamber.
Ron's Familiar was a husky, "This is Lila, she's a husky, she has two sisters in the school, and they belong to Ginny and Luna."
When she arrived at the doctor’s office, she only had a few minutes to spare. After signing in at the desk, she sat in the waiting area. After waiting for a while her name was called. After explaining everything to the doctor, he looked at her in disbelief. Shaking his head, he told her to go to the hospital for a scan.
He had been sat there reading for about an hour when some boys from a few years above him walked over where he was sat and began to mock him for not knowing their language. One of them snatched his book out of his hands while another pulled him to his feet.
I’m back!!!
(See the end of the chapter for
Amaia, Ashley and Aiden all went and talked closest to the window. Imogen, Draco, Ron and Neville decided that seeing that none of them technically had any siblings here they would talk towards the centre of the compartment, giving the other families some space. The end closest to the door was taken by Hadrian, Eleanora and Luna.

Hadrian was aware of the arms surrounding him, but all he could think of was his time at the Dursley’s. All the memories were flashing through his mind.
The person entered, it was the head of Gryffindor and deputy headmistress, Minerva McGonagall.
"I'm not going to sugar coat it… probably because that's what is going to happen. I got my love of fashion from Maman, so it'll be the both of us. Sorry." Sav said, not looking the tiniest bit sorry about it.
them. Luckily Hadrian, predicting the move, put up a
When they got to Malfoy Manor, Draco came out to meet them. When he saw his mates distress he immediatly pulled him into the house and into the room he was to stay in. He sat them both on the bed, giving the smaller boy a hug.
"Can we come in?" Theo asked, Harry was starting to panic a bit more now.
“What did you need?” she asked as she shut the door to the compartment behind her.
“I assume that your mate was awake this time Theophania?” her mother asked, looking up from her newspaper. The young girl nodded and began tucking into breakfast. She hadn’t eaten properly in days.
"Lovegood, Luna."
“How much do you know about your parents?” This time it was Morfran who spoke.
I’ve read
When the time came for him to return to Privet Drive, Harry began to feel uneasy. He didn’t know if it was because of the way the teachers were treating him, or it was because he knew something was wrong. Vernon had become far worse than he had ever been. He had been hitting Harry almost daily. It wasn’t until his last week there that he realised why.
The rest of the summer passed in a blur of pain. His uncle only stopped hitting him a week before he was to return to France. That’s where he currently was. He was hoping that the teachers would see his injuries and tell someone, but they just took one look at him and told him to go and get ready for evening meal.
Harry had been dragged round Diagon Alley for the past hour and they were finally leaving to go to Paris. They went into The Leaky cauldron as they were going to be flooing to Sav's house. That's when it got weird.
Ten minutes later Hadrian began talking to them as a group, allowing them to ask any questions, then they would all have to talk in families for the remainder of the journey. They had all agreed to go by their original names unless in the presence of Dumbledore before.
“Dumbledore stupefied me. I woke up less than an hour ago.” Harry replied running his hand through his hair.
At Draco’s curious look, Hadrian wordlessly handed the paper over to the blonde. “I forgot that we needed familiars.” Draco whispered, looking around at all of the animals in the room.
it there. They had abused him for most of his life and had treated him worse than a House Elf. As he slowly rose from the bed and got ready for a shower he was silently praying that the Dursley's didn't find out that Sirius had died. That was the only thing that stopped them from hitting him the last two summers. He was always the first in the dorm to wake, so it was his job to get the others up. That was his favourite part of the morning. He went for a quick shower, got dressed and then started to wake the others up.
An hour later, Harry was sat alone in one of the train compartments when Hermione and Ron walked in. “Harry-” He flinched at the name, and they noticed “What’s wrong? Do you have a headache? Why do you look different?”
Draco thinks mentally eye rolling.
As it turned out, no one left or entered the common room until 6am the next morning, which is when a poor 7th year left to go to breakfast, only to be met with the sight of a black jaguar waiting to get in. the seventh year girl, whose name Harry didn't know, screamed so loudly, he would be surprised if anyone in Slytherin was still asleep. Walking into the common room and up to the 6th year boy's dorm, Harry, surprisingly, didn't meet another person. When he entered the 6th year boy's dorm however he was met with laughter, when he looked it was to see that Draco was sat on the floor, apparently fallen out of bed, glaring at the other occupants of the room. Wearing a jumper that was much too big for him, shorts and thigh high socks, pared with bedhead that was about as bad as Harry's, it ruined the usually perfect picture that he showed the rest of the world. The glare was lost on the boys as the image was just too funny. In fact, Blaze Zabini, Draco's best friend, had a camera out and was taking pictures, he took one of those pictures and, with a semi-permanent (only the one who applies it can remove it) sticking charm, stuck all 15 above Hunter's are saying as he did so, "There now you are the proud owner of the only pictures of the Draco Malfoy with, a) his hair all messed up, and, b) in his not-so-Malfoyish pyjamas." Harry did admit to himself that when he first saw Draco in his pyjamas he could have burst out laughing, it was even worse in the morning when he threatened Harry if he ever said anything to anyone he would "Not by you a new toy for a month."
Draco stood and tried to get Harry to move but he was not going to be shown to the whole school, it was only when he whispered to him, "Go up there now or I'll shave all of your fur off." That he moved. "Hunter here is a black jaguar, he likes high places, water and jumping from high places into water. He definitely does not have any relatives in the school."
Nodding slowly, Draco took a deep breath and stood up. Bidding his parents goodbye. When he got to his room he flopped onto the bed. Turning onto his back, he threw his arm over his eyes and sighed deeply. Before he knew it, he had slipped off to sleep.
Deans was a ginger cat with green eyes, "This is Sandfur, she doesn't have any relatives in the school."
Harry turned pack into himself and looked at the new people to know. Pansy was the first to speak up, "I thought you were training in America."
Thanks for reading.
"Just watch." Harry said, walking over to Dean's bed. He levitated a bucket of water over to the bed, grabbed a rope, attached it upright so none spilt to above where Dean's head would be when he sat up, attached one end of the rope to one edge and the other to his hand which was resting by his head. He turned to do the same to Seamus' bed. Once he was finished with his task, Harry cleared his throat and yelled "DEAN! SEAMUS!" both boys sat bolt upright moving their hands, unknowingly tipping the buckets and therefore pouring water all over their heads. Both boys sat in shock for a minute before turning to glare at a laughing Harry.
He was just about to continue on his way when a familiar voice said, ”Harry?”
Harry had decided to go by Hadrian, Harry felt weird now. He would go by Harry in front of Dumbledore but other than that, he was Hadrian. He had learned that he had a mate and could become pregnant too, however, like his mother, his pregnancy would only be six months long. Oh, and his new appearance was now permanent. He had decided that he would
The first of September couldn’t come soon enough. Vernon decided to have some fun before Harry had to leave for school. Thrusting himself into the small boy Vernon let out a throaty moan. Whispering threats into Harry’s ear as he pounded into him. Once he was done, he got up and demanded the boy showered and put his makeup on. When he had the makeup on Vernon got the boy into the car and drove him to the train station.
Blaise was attempting to keep Paws still while he was talking, "This is Paws, her Mother is Silver."
"Where are your familiars?" Draco,
I’m sorry about telling you what Dumbledore did and not having any suspense, it needed to be done so the story made sense later on, and I didn’t know what to do in the two day gap.
"Yes." Harry then heard footsteps coming running to the dorm, and the 6th year boys, minus Draco, looked at him in wonder. Then at their room. There were cries of disgust and horror coming from them.
After putting the mattress on the wardrobe and making the bed, the horse-faced woman hurriedly placed the waking infant on the cupboard. Stepping back, she heard her own child begin to cry. Shutting the door, she turned to tend to her own child. She held her child close as she carried him down the stairs and into the kitchen. Sitting at the table she began to feed him.
An hour and a half later, the boys had left the office and were awaiting their results. It didn’t take very long for the woman to emerge from her office. Holding both exams in her hands.
“Please call me Hadrian, Mrs. Malfoy.” He replied, a small smile on his face.
He was so caught up in his thoughts, that he didn't notice that the forest he had wandered into was full of hunters. He heard a snap of a twig and spun ready to pounce on whatever it was. But he was too late he was hit with a dart and, slowly, everything went black.
He looked at the child in disgust. Attempting to keep his anger in check, he stormed out of the room. Walking into the kitchen he told Petunia to find a place for “That Freakish Boy” to sleep.
Late in the evening of 31
It was his last month at his new school and, even though he was still underweight, he was closer to the weight of his friends his age. Before he went to sleep on his last night, he smiled. He couldn’t wait to spend more time with his friends in the coming years.
“W-What did you just call me?” She asked confused. Hadrian figured that if he was going to tell them, he might get it over with.
"Staring at you in an oddly human like way?" If Harry still had hands he would have slapped Draco right then and there.
"Malfoy, Draco."
Amaia, is Hermione and her sister is Ashley- Daughters of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange.
Once the boy had left the room and retreated to his cupboard, Petunia spoke up.
He found an interesting book with a lot of interesting information, such as, they like water, they eat avocados, they eat any meat, they can run up to 64mph at a sprint, there are only around 15,000 left in the wild, and even fewer black and, well, they are
that shielded them all from the spell. Then the old man had the nerve to try and talk them onto his side of the war, to which some of the teens just rolled their eyes, and Draco, always overdramatic, told him that “The day I join you will be the day I willingly dye my hair red.” Glared at him spun in a very Snape-like manner and left the room with the others, leaving Albus Dumbledore fuming behind them.
Disclaimer: Harry Potter is not mine and neither is Draco unfortunately.
Ron and Hermione however were trying not to laugh at the look on their friends face the wolf cub was entertaining itself with trying to catch the big cats tail, even though the white one was trying to stop it. The headmaster chose that moment to stand up to make an announcement, "Good morning! As some of you have noticed, Harry Potter is not with us. He has gone to train in America. Now no questions as everything else is confidential, none of us know when he will be returning."

Once the ceremony was over they took Hunter from the room and everyone had a drink, before leaving the manor congratulating him on the way past. Some people would think it odd that he was being congratulated, but having a familiar was a big deal. They had magic stored inside them and would come to there bonded aid should anything happen to them, and with the war they all needed the protection. When he went back to his room he saw Hunter laying on a large pet bed by the fireplace. When they woke tomorrow they would have to get to know each other.
Pansy just raised an eyebrow and said "Really?"
"Weasley, Ronald."
"Zabini, Blaise."
“Are you okay?” the nurse asked, looking worriedly at the girl on the bed. She nodded and the man continued. “What is your name miss?”
When he awoke it was to a familiar smell. A hospital. He groaned and began to open his eyes. There was nothing. It was all black. He began to panic, and he could hear a beeping noise coming from beside him. A soothing voice was telling him to calm down and when he did, they began to talk.
Curious, Narcissa turned to the pensive before telling her husband that they should view them together. When her husband agreed she began to view them.

Harry, however, was terrified of what his uncle would do to him. But nothing could have prepared him for what did. His uncle ordered him to strip and lie down on his front on the bed. Harry was visibly shaking now. Without warning his uncle thrust into him, telling him that he was a slut and that this was all he was good for, and to Harry it felt as if his soul was being ripped to shreds, slowly and agonizingly, and no matter his screaming his uncle wouldn't stop, he would just slap him so hard on the back of his head that he saw stars, but didn't pass out, and tell him to shut up. The feel of his uncles large body on his much smaller frame, mixed with the sound of his loud moans and heavy breathing made him feel sick. After his uncle had finished with him he beat him so that he could barely walk, let alone do chores and forced him into his cupboard.
The story should be more interesting from next chapter, they should be longer too.
"Why didn't you just go up to him and tell him what happened?" she asked. Everyone had sat down now and were looking at him expectantly.
“The veil didn’t kill me, it just sent me back an hour in time. I awoke after I had fallen through the veil, but I couldn’t just walk up to you.” The man responded. “I saw your uncle drop you off and noticed your scar. I thought you were just a random girl at first. I called an ambulance and was Padfoot by the time they got there.” He explained rapidly. “Your mother wanted to call you Vivienne.” He said quietly. It took Harry a second to realise when he meant. The name. Right. She smiled at her godfather before hearing the door open. His vision had started to return in the time the doctor was gone.
” all three huddled together to decide.
“Harry?”
"Well then you have met Hunter, my familiar." Replied Draco, amusement evident in his tone.
Harry hated shopping. And yet here he was Draco pulling him around Diagon Alley getting charms for the collar and Draco's bracelet, and now Draco was getting some new dress robes. So Harry decided to have a nap. His dreams were plagued with images of his summer. All the horrible things that had happened to him, and Sirius' death. He woke up whimpering, with Draco checking if he were okay.
Hadrian just smirked and walked over to the sinks, before saying, “
“”Why?” Ron asked looking confused.
"Are you sure? I heard voices." Pansy said, sounding concerned.

Nothing ever seemed to change in his life. Smiling to himself he looked to the fat man driving the car to Harry’s hell. Once they got to the house Harry told his aunt and uncle about just who his godfather was. Telling them that he would contact him if any one of them hurt him.
When Draco awoke, he slowly sat up on his bed. Standing up he heard his stomach growl and decided to make his way to the dining room. When he got there his parents were staring at him in shock. “What?” he asked, his eyes widening at the pitch of his voice.
“It’s the best school near here, Duddykins needs the best!” She said before sighing. “I’ll teach that freak what he needs to know. If he can get a scholarship we won't need to pay.”
He sat near the Slytherin, scared about what he would say. "Don't worry I'm not just going to yell or anything. Is there any chance you could change back, just I feel crazy talking to a Jaguar." Mentally laughing Harry nodded and turned back into his human form.
He thought.
Five minutes later, Hadrian found one of the people he was searching for, Ashley Lestrange, well, Lisa Turpin. The Ravenclaws looked up as he walked in, probably wondering what he was doing there. “Lisa, I need to talk with you.” The girl in question looked up with a look of pure curiosity on her face. He didn’t know whether it was due to his new appearance or his presence there. She just nodded and said a quick goodbye to her friends.
“Yes, yes I have. But I fell in love with you, not him! Now get the fuck out of my house, and back to your ginger fucking whore! I don’t ever want to see you again, Potter” Draco spat out his name as if it tasted foul in his mouth.
He stood up from the couch.
“Fine” Draco sank down into the sofa and watched as Harry struggled to hold everything.
This man was very gorgeous, he had rich, dark skin and was built similarly to Harry, paired with soft facial features.
Based off of a prompts ask, no smut, just fluff in which Draco is sick and Harry takes care of him.
Blaise rolled his eyes at him and chucked him the mornings issue.
“Malfoy?” Came a hesitant voice from the door. “It’s me, Ron. Are you alright in there?” The voice was laced with uncertainty but it seemed genuine. He begrudgingly opened the door and offered the other man a meek smile.
She pulled him to the side out of the way of people walking.
He’d just sunk down onto the sofa and switched on the television when his floo fired up, and in stepped the unkempt wizard he’d just been trying not to think about.
for a meeting with the Chosen One, so I’ll have to see when I’m next free.” Harry’s eyes narrowed. “You have a free period first. Cancel whatever plans you had and meet me outside the 8th year common room or so help my Godric you’ll regret it.” With that he straightened up (ha) and stalked away, arriving at his table with a huff.
“I love you too, Malfoy”.
“So what? Now we fuck?” Draco asked breathily, panting as Harry tugged on his cock. “Unfortunately by royal decree we cannot engage in sex until we’re married, and since you refused to be my bride, you’ll have to make do with this.”
“Yeah, like Hermione’s my person. You’re his. Where is she, by the way?” Draco was staring at him now.
“Not everything is about sex, Potter!” Harry rolled his eyes and lifted himself onto his elbows.
Harry looked up from the lunch table to see Ron walking towards him, he nodded at his friend who nodded back in turn. Ron was rather good looking now, not that harry hadn’t always admired him. He was fucking huge- easily 6’6”, thin but stocky in the shoulders. His hair was very soft and his face was an explosion of freckles and jawbone. Yes, more and more girls had started noticing him now, not just because he was the Chosen One’s best mate. But he only had eyes for Hermione. Cute as fuck.
Draco frowned and sat up, wrapping the sheets across his chest.
“Gwain! How did you get in?” Draco shrieked, nearly falling out of bed. Good thing he had harry there to save him.
“Draco, look at me”. Harry whispered. Draco shook his head, he couldn’t bear to. “Draco, please, look at me”. He opened his eyes, the teary grey pleaded with the sharp green that were staring back at him. He couldn’t help it, as much as his brain was screaming at him to run away, his heart couldn’t contain itself- being so close to the man he loved.
Not beta'd
.” He sighed as he sunk back down into his chair. McGonagall had rushed him up to her office- Draco had been taken to the hospital wing immediately by Blaise and Jacob had been sent to St Mungo’s. “Harry, if I might add, I know your feelings for Malfoy have always been, explosive. But explosions cause damage, and you need to know if you can
“Why the fuck would I help you find him, Potter?” She spat as he sat down in her office. Pansy ran a chain of rather successful bars, which was how Harry had been able to find her.
This went on for another minute before Ron pulled away and smiled at Draco, a smile that reached his eyes. “Don’t worry, everything's going to be fine”. Draco highly doubted it but appreciated it anyway.
When they were both finally undressed, Harry lowered himself in between Draco’s obscenely wide legs and they continued to let their hands roam over each other’s bodies.
“Harry, I haven’t seen you in two years, and you turn up and destroy my engagement. Why? Why? It’s not as if we’re in love, and that stuff-“
“I’m leaving, Malfoy, I told you I came to get my stuff.”
So it’s been a while since I’ve updated, it’s weird to think this fic is pretty close to being over now? I’m writing this before I’ve written the chapter as I’ve had no motivation to write, but I’m forcing myself to try.
“Why are you telling us this now?” Hermione asked. Harry sat down next to her at the table and sighed.
There was a gentle tap on his door about a half hour later, followed by the gruff voice of his best friend. “Hey, Harry mate, it’s me Ron.” No reply. “I just wanted to let you know I hope you’re alright, and I’m always hear for you, no matter what it is.” Harry breathed in sharply. “Alright well, I’ll see you in the morning.” He heard the heavy footsteps of his bestfriend going back to his own dorm.
“It’s good to see you again, my angel”.
Deep down Harry had known Draco wouldn’t want to keep going. They’d been back for a month and Harry was still refusing to come out and was adamant they had to stay secret, and he knew Draco deserved better.
Two hours later, Harry was in front of an Oak wood door, hoping he’d been given the right information. He hesitated, before pounding his fist on the door, hoping he would come. It was late, nearly midnight, Harry saw a light turn on, and then heard footsteps.
“There is not enough cock in me right now and too many clothes on, so hurry up” Harry chuckled at his bossy lovers demands. “You’re such a fucking brat” he growled as he spelled both of their clothes off. “Your brat, Daddy”
This is the sixth work in my Drarry Drabbles Collection. Link to it on
“40 years later and I still can’t get used to that” laughed Hermione as she kissed Harry on the cheek before hugging him, her grey curls bouncing on his shoulder.
“Where are we going, Jacob?” His speech was so slurred he was shocked him boyfriend understood him. “I’m taking you to bed, you’re completely hammered and it’s only just midnight.” Draco giggled as they entered the 8th year common room. “You’re not meant to be out of bed! It’s past your curfew. Jacob gave him an almost sinister grin. “Oh, I have a good reason to be”.
, Darling?” Was his chosen greeting as he waltzed over to his wardrobe to change into his silky black pyjamas. “I can hardly believe that Grover Washington Jr. was a muggle, and besides, half of your wardrobe is just designer muggle brands you hypocrite.” Draco chortled as he made his way over to Blaise. “How’s your Gryffindor?” He Asked his friend. “How’s yours?” He said instantly. Fear clutched Draco’s entire body, how did he know? A second later Blaise burst into laughter. “Just teasing, Darling. I’m going in the shower before bed- there’s a letter for you, by the way, on your desk”.
His garden was his pride and joy, he spent hours in it every day- and as a result had grown into a farmhands strong build. There were all sorts of herbs and rare species of flowers in his garden which he often traded with the witches in the local village.
Harry groaned and threw a pillow and their friend. “Shut up, Gwain. And get out!”
“I thought so” was all he said.
“Thanks, Pansy, but I quite like the ones I’ve got” he glanced over at Draco and the Ravenclaw. “It’s nearly curfew by the way, Ravenclaw”
or I swear on Merlin’s grave you will meet your end, once and for fucking all. Saving him this time means nothing if you can’t save him from
Twenty minutes after, after gathering all of his things, Draco was gone too. When Harry finally came home a week later, the only thing that remained of his love was the torn picture on the ground.
“God, I am so turned on right now”. Growled Harry. Draco let out a curt laugh. “Well, Potter, I can always help you with that if you carry me to your bed”. Draco smiled, letting his head fall back as Harry squeezed his arse.
“I thought you loved me” he choked out.
Finally they were naked, Harry pushed them both into their bed, kissing passionately. Harry reached for his wand and cast lubing spells and of course, protection spells. “Hurry the fuck up!” His stroppy his husband yelled, causing them both to giggle.
“Potter, for fucks sake, stop it.” He felt his lip quiver. “If you’re not going to listen I’m just going to leave”. He stood up, but was immediately pushed back down into his seat, he’d no idea how Harry had been able to move that fast.
The ending of this chapter is weird??? Idk it seems to short/weird but I hope you guys don’t mind, thanks for reading loves <3
“Baby, is everything alright?” Harry asked as he embraced his lover. “Sometimes I do feel like maybe it would be easier for you if you were with someone else.” Harry captured Draco’s face in his hands, forcing eye contact.
“Potter, the offer still stands!-“
“Draco baby, what’s wrong?” Harry rushed forward to him and wrapped his arms around him. Draco let himself lean into Harry’s touch, sobbing into his shoulder.
Part 13-

She looked so beautiful, her hair was soft and gleaming, her flurry of freckles were painted with a rosy glow and her eyes were electric. But he couldn’t help but think of
Smut guys, this chapter opens up on smut right away, so be warned.
Harry got his wand out and spelled the sheets from the bed into the linen basket. He wizzed out some sheets from the cabinet and had them make the bed. He decided to take his own clothes off, he much preferred close contact with Draco anyway.
Harry had joined the elite force of Aurors that fought off physical forces of dark magic, and last time he’d only been gone for 3 days but had come back with an array of scars, he’d looked so badly bruised and damaged when he’d limped back into his flat that Draco had screamed at the sight of him.
Harry guessed that the bed on the left was Draco’s, he didn’t think that Blaise would have a vibrator in his bedside drawer. He pulled back the sheets and lifted Draco into the bed. He took of the boys shoes and untied his belt, but left the rest of his clothes on- he didn’t want Draco to think he’d taken advantage of him. He made sure Draco was fully covered, and he couldn’t help but kiss him, softly. He held on for a few seconds before turning to leave. It was getting harder and harder each time to turn away from him.
“I’m mad at you, blondie” he slurred, falling forward into Draco’s front hall. The blonde was completely unbothered and rolled his eyes, leading his ‘guest’ through to the living room.
As soon as Draco sat down, Justin was in his face, glaring at him angrily. “Don’t, ever speak to me like that, Draco. You’re mine now, and you better learn to accept that!” Venom filled his words, filling Draco with equal amounts of rage.
“I’m not sure, to be quite honest. He can be rather high strung and unforgiving, but he’s also intelligent and caring and all I can hope is that even though I’ve hurt him and said unforgivable things to him, is that he still loves me. The eight months of his life that he gave to me were the happiest and most magical I’ve ever experienced.
“Dracooooo!” An obviously tipsy Pansy approached them in a shorter than short black dress. She was accompanied by a giggling Hermione who was wrapped in a beautiful red dress. “It’s wonderful you could make it, come dance!” She led him and Jacob onto the floor, paralleled from Harry and Ginny.
“Oh do hush its not important. Now, listen to this. Saviour Throws Magical Tantrum, is the ex death eater rubbing off on him? My my Potter, you really have been trying hard to stay out of the public eye!”
“I’m so sorry, darling. I know exactly where he is.” Harry strode over to the side board and lent down next to it, and started reaching out for something. A second later, he seems to find it and pulled whatever it was he had found.
They practically fell onto the bed and only stopped when Draco hissed in pain as his wing was pinned beneath them. “Sorry, sorry, I got carried away”. Harry went to pull away from the other man but the angel shook his head. “No, don’t go.” He turned his body around until he was sat on top of Harry, who’s body reacted very positively.
“I know, idiot. I love you too”.
He replied. Jacob looked at him questioningly. “It seems Pansy here would rather like you for herself, Jacob.” The 6th year raised an eyebrow. “Unfortunately, I am rather taken by your Slytherin prince.” He leaned back into the sofa and used his hand to indicate that Draco should fill the gap next to him. He happily complied.
Hermione looked at him with concern and he was so scared he thought he might fall over.
It had been nearly two years since his angel had left, and last night they had another storm. Harry could’ve sworn he’d felt his lips on his own again. He was making his way down to the village to see what damage had been done and how he could help his friends.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Ask me again when you’re sober, alright?” He said, shaking his head.
The drunk man slumped on to the sofa next to his host, making a sound of old age as he landed. They were both nearly 30, and neither of them married. They’d become quite unusual friends, Draco and Ron now worked together at St Mungo’s and so Draco had become integrated in his life.
. I am fortunate that I have never been raped, but you beating the shit out of him out of
Harry grinned and lifted Draco into his arms, carrying him to his bed chambers.
When he made it to the back door the wind had calmed down, but the rain was still pounding. He squinted around to see what had landed in his garden, and was shocked to see a pair of large wings shielding what appeared to be a man. He thought at first maybe it was a creature from Charlie’s farm, but as he got closer he realised, the wings were attached to the man.
“Shit! Are you okay?” Draco couldn’t help but giggle at Harry’s concern. “Help meeeeee!” He giggles again as Harry sighed, and pulled Draco up onto his chest.
“What?”
“I won’t deny that it’s been fun, Potter.” Harry nodded.
“Oh no, Potter I cant kick you out of your bed again!” Harry chuckled deeply which made Draco very exasperated. “We’re both adults, Malfoy. I’m sure we can share the bed, right?” Draco just nodded, it wasn’t like he was going to miss an opportunity to sleep with next to Harry.
He hadn’t seen Harry since Wednesday. He was finding it harder and harder to resist touching himself, even after their spat over Jacob. He didn’t want to because he knew his mind would just be flooded with the Gryffindor, so he focused on someone else instead. He imagined it was Blaise touching him, then he morphed into Jacob, but his hair was too long so he shortened it to a messy mop, but the eyes were the wrong colour- suddenly they were emerald green. “H-Harrrrrryyy” Draco let the long moan slip from his mouth as he arched into his orgasm. Well that worked.
“Alright, mate?” Ron asked as he walked into their kitchen.
He gasped as he looked at himself. “Do you like it?” The voice was filled with nervousness. Draco didn’t say anything. He was mesmerised by himself.
“Hi” he said nervously. Draco just grunted and turned back to the television, obviously uninterested by Harry’s arrival.
As soon as the door shut Draco sighed and deflated into Harry’s shoulder, that was slightly shaking from the rugged mans chuckles. “It’s not funny Potter! I thought you put up charms!” Draco punctuated his words by poking the Auror’s chest.
Draco’s favourite thing to see was his husband holding their son, they were what made him happiest. He was 39 weeks pregnant, and had gone into labour earlier that morning. They’d fire called the medi-witch who’d told them to come in when his contractions started to be 30 minutes apart. Their daughter was on her way.
”. He felt a shift of weight on the bed and then he was forced to open his eyes as Harry lay a hand on his cheek and used the other to grasp Draco’s own hand. “Of course it’s relevant to me, what if you’d had an attack while you were with me?” Draco could hear the worry in his voice which angered him further.
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes.
anymore!” The last few words were yelled at him before Draco stormed out and raced up the stair to his dorm, which he locked for good measure.
The start of this chapter will no doubt be confusing until the next chapter, which I hope to have up for Monday.
“Hurry, Draco, we don’t want to be late to our own party!” Spat a tall, pinched faced man. “For Gods sake, Justin! We’ll be fine you prat!”. Replied his annoyed fiancé before stepping into their limo.
to check it out!
“i’m gonna cum, fuck I’m gonna cum!” Draco screamed as his orgasm hit, kissing Harry through it. “Thank you Daddy oh thank you”. Harry felt himself reach the edge, thrusting harder into Draco.
around them. It was still weird not having Fred there at the table, George wasn’t as lively as he used to be, but that was to be expected. It was good to have Percy back, he was sat with an arm across George’s shoulder, the boys had become a lot closer after the war. He was just happy that his family was finally safe.  “So Harry,” Molly said as she sat herself down across from him. He looked up at her with intrigue. “When are you and Ginny going to get back together?”
“Oh, ‘scuse me Potter”
, Harry.” He turned to face his bestfriend, who also had tears in her eyes. “I’m not, I’m not gay. I think I’m somewhere in the middle but- but I really don’t want to talk about this Hermione.” He pushed past her and ran down the corridor as fast as he could, and as far away from his feelings as possible.
Based off of a drabble prompts ask where Draco cannot sleep..so instead has sex. with Harry, of course.
Harry flooed out of Draco’s apartment and straight to Ron and Hermione’s. He had no idea where else he was supposed to go, he just knew he had to tell someone.
“Do you need a job?”
The heat was unbearable. Draco couldn’t stop moving, he’d already kicked away the sheets and managed to remove himself from Harry’s ridiculous grip, but try as he might he could not sleep. It didn’t help that Harry would NOT stop snoring in what looked to be a very peaceful slumber.
, Malfoy. No one else.” Draco nodded before Harry covered his mouth with his own.
“Have fun you evil love makers!
“You’re telling me you don’t love me?” He asked, eyebrow raised.
“No I’m not you stupid git, he has a girlfriend! Honestly Potter, how do they trust you to be an auror?!”
feelings. You’re hurting everyone around you, and you need to realise it- and fix it- before you have
Harry turned to him indignantly, having to pause to adjust his drunk body to the sudden movement. “Because I’m in love with you and you’re marrying that prick!” He shouted concentrating hard on staring at Draco.
“Wait, what? How could you produce an heir?” Draco rolled his eyes. “For heavens sake Potter, don’t tell me you didn’t know gay wizards can have babies? Because we can, quite easily with the help of a few potions.” Harry just stared down at him. “I didn’t mean, um, not us per se since youre not gay or whatever.” Harry had been imagining his children with Draco, what they’d look like. How happy the could beohgod he was choking up, he had to turn away from Draco who took this opportunity to escape and have another swig of firewhisky. “However, I won’t be able to successfully marry into one of these rich piggy families, because I’m so in love with you that I could never be happy! I’ve had feelings for you since that day in Madam Malkin’s, did you know that? My first wank was over you! And now with this bloody heart condition loving you is harder than ever’. His voice cracked over his words and he had to lean against the balcony to support himself. Harry got as close as he dared, what was he meant to do? “Draco, I-“
Draco didn’t know what to say. He thought maybe Harry was joking with him, getting his hopes up. Time to show him who was really in charge.
“We’re so happy for you, mate” Ron said to Harry, with Blaise nodding in agreement.
The only person who did wish him a happy birthday was Pansy, but even she was no reassurance. “I’m sure he’s just forgotten, Draco! His work as Minister for Magical Education is hard!” Sympathy wasn’t her thing.
Harry turned back to Draco, his expression softened. “Draco,” The blond shook his head and rushed himself into Harry’s arms, wrapping his own around Harry’s neck and reaching up to kiss the taller man, shutting his eyes tightly as the sparks ran through them. They heard gasps and cheers from the crowd, and then a round of applause.
Drarry prompt from
“Goodnight Harry.”
“Draco you don’t have to-“ he was interrupted as his orgasm hit and the younger man instantly started to swallow, choking as the ropes got too thick.
“Good thing that eyeliner didn’t smudge” said a smug looking Pansy. This caused a ripple of laughter. The two boys blushed violently but didn’t stop holding eachother.
He lived in a remote cottage on the coast of Scotland, up in the Highlands. The cottage was spacious and modern enough, but it was also fizzing with magic and character. Harry was mainly worried for the safety of his garden that he worked tirelessly over.
“Damn right you are” Harry smirked as he kissed a trail down Draco’s firm chest, wandering down to his hardening cock. “So excited for me, aren’t you?” Draco could only nod as harry thrust two slick fingers into him.
“Draco baby what is it? What’s wrong?” Harry tried to calm him down.
He heard Harry’s heavy footfall and rushed to place the photo back on the mantle.
.” And with that, she turned and left.
ALSO!! Someone (me) figured out how to fix their italics! So maybe go and read the last chapter again, it’ll be so much better with the right expressions
“Did you hear about Malfoy?” Ron asked casually before filling his plate up with lunch. Harry looked at him questioningly. “No, what’s he done now?” Ron paused to swallow before answering, “He was rushed to the hospital wing, ‘pparently some Ravenclaws found him near the common room, looked like he’d had a heart attack or something”.
“Fuck, you’re made for me, aren’t you baby? Moulded for my cock, weren’t you?” The blonde nodded rapidly, unable to form words to reply.
“What are you going to name her?” Asked Narcissa, with obvious interest. Draco looked up at Harry, who smiled back at him and nodded. “I decided a few weeks ago, I knew she was going to be a girl before we even got the results. Her name is going to be Lily Raina, Lily after Harry’s mother of course, and Raina because when derived from Latin, means Queen, I don’t know why but I feel it’s quite fitting”. His mother nodded in agreement, her smile bursting from her face.
“What are you gonna do? Rape me? Is that why I’m here?” Harry’s brow furrowed.
Ron felt Draco shrink into himself again, and a protective urge came over Ron. Neither Harry or Draco said anything, just stared at each other.
“Really? Out of all of the men in the world you chose that one?”
Draco’s breath hitched, not looking up at the Auror. He felt a flush spread up his neck, because of course he remembered how it felt.
Harry sat there for over five minutes as Draco read the whole article to him. They sat in silence as Draco folded the newspaper and looked across at Harry.
Pansy Parkinson was Draco’s best friend, surely she’d know where he was staying.
”. He tried to get his brain to function, tried to speak- but his eyes kept closing on him. Jacob pulled at Draco’s underwear, his own already around his thighs. He could feel his slimy hands on his skin and he wanted to

“Harry! Calm down!” Draco stood up and grasped his husbands face. “We don’t need to rush around with all of that stuff right now, okay?”
In the far left of the Hospital Wing he could see Pansy and some of the other gathered around a bed, presumably Draco’s. Madame Pomfrey attended to his hands right a way but snapped at him the whole time. “Idiot boy! You’ve broken four knuckles- you’ll be sore and clicking for the rest of your life- however long that is if you keep up this pace!” He heard Hermione and Ron enter his cubicle, and he turned to greet them. “Oh
Smut and partying, what more could you ask for?
“So, how is it?” Draco could see the concern in her face and sighed. “He’s awful, Pans, I have no idea how I’m going to live with him”. She gave him a sympathetic look, stroking his arm.
“Tell me you want this, Malfoy. And I’ll leave her. I’ll leave Ginny for you.” Draco knew his words were too good to be true but nodded anyway, spurring them on. There was no way Draco could say no. They’d only been apart for, what, not even a day and he was already back in the Gryffindor’s bed. It was just like the last time they tried to end it, when school had started up again.
Draco chuckled into the kiss, amused by Harry’s immediate prowess.
“I’m sorry. Just making sure you’re ok” He rolled his eyes and made sure Potter could see. He turned the note over and scribbled down his reply.
He found his clothes hanging up in the laundry room, ironed and clean. There were some new underwear and shirts for him, as well as some muggle jeans. He opted for a soft grey T-shirt and the jeans, which were surprisingly comfortable. After he finished pulling on some white socks he stood up and shivered.

The room was filled with happiness and tears of joy, all of them worshipping the little girl, who had huge grey eyes, and thick, black curls. She was an astonishing mix of her two fathers.
Hey guys! So sorry I didmt get this out yesterday, but my kitchen ceiling is literally falling down so I didn’t have time to edit yesterday. I’m starting school again on Monday so it’ll take me longer to get chapters up, but thank you all for your continued support, it means so much!
“Right I’m off guys, see you tomorrow” The dashing Slytherin announced upon entering the common room. Blaise winked at Pansy as she started to ask where he was going, but Draco nudged her as a hint.
“Listen to me, you are who I want to be with. It will always be you, okay? Fuck what The Prophet or anyone else wants to say about us. I love you.” They smiled at one another before kissing deeply.
Draco groaned at the sight of Harry’s perfectly chiselled chest, tracing his hand across the defined muscles.
Harry nodded.
“Oh good! We made it on time!” Came a shrill voice from the doorway, as four people spilled into their room.
Harry sighed in exasperation and brought his boyfriend into his arms again. “Yes, to you. And if you’ll let me get on with it then we can be engaged”. This couldn’t be happening. Harry wasn’t really getting down on one knee, he wasn’t really pulling out a little black box and opening it to reveal a gorgeous silver band, studded with diamonds.
Harry glances at his husband.
sorry. I

It’d been a week since Harry’s article had dropped and the world had gone absolutely mad. His floo had to be shut and wards intensified for the sheer amount of people trying to break in. His phone and owl had been bombarded, but there was still no sign of Draco.
“Wahey!” The shouts of laughter ringing out from Harry’s doorway was what finally pulled them apart.
“Well you’ve told us about him, right? That’s the first step”.
Draco was just adding the finishing touches to his look when he heard a knock at the door, assuming it was Jacob. “Come in!” He purred- instead of his boyfriend-who had been suffocating him with affection for the past week (he’d ended up doubling his heart potions to make sure he didn’t have a panic attack)- Harry’s dark figure came in. He turn in a haste, posing like a cat ready to pounce. “Potter! What the hell are you doing here?” He hissed. The Gryffindor strode towards him, backing Draco into the bed. “You’ve been avoiding me, Malfoy. My dick isn’t going to fuck itself. He felt himself blush at Harry’s harsh language. “You’ve got Ginerva for that.” He tried to say with as much spite as possible in his current jittery state. He heard Harry growl, but felt a soft hand on his chin, that moved his face up until they made startling eye contact. “Draco” he whispered softly, their faces impossibly close. For some reason, that was all it took for Draco to wrap himself around his lover, who kissed him over and over as they tumbled onto the bed.
“I can’t carry it all now, I’ll be back for the rest”.
Draco Malfoy was not wearing a muggle, cheap suit that did not fit his

” Harry tried to stay calm over the sound of Pansy’s sobs. He can’t really be dying, can he? He races into the hospital wing to try and find Draco, but his search comes to a halt when he is stopped by Madame Pomfrey. “Mr Potter, I’m afraid I can’t let you in to see Mr Malfoy. He is very unwell and needs to rest.” Harry looked in her eyes searchingly. “Will he be okay? He’s not dying is he?” He says in a frenzy. The nurse chuckled. “No, he is not dying. He has a heart condition caused by stress, Cardiomyopathy. It would be more of a problem we’re he a muggle, but here we have potions to help him with it. Obviously over the recent months he hasn’t been taking good enough care of himself which caused an attack, earlier we were very worried. He will be perfectly fine by tomorrow and I’m sure you can catch up then.”
“I’m in love with you, potter. Have been for a while. This year, coming back and having a second chance at everything, even being friends with you, was incredible. But I can’t help my feelings and I can’t bear being around you when I feel like this for you but you’re in love with her, Ginny, instead and you’re straight so I should never have gotten my hopes up when you wanted to be friends because now I’ve ruined the one thing that’s made me happy, but it hurts too much to be around you.”

“Harry?” He called out as he walked into his open plan living room. He could see Harry in the kitchen and saw him flinch at Draco’s voice, sighing at being caught.
He could have sworn he only put James down for 30 seconds! He’d turned around from getting a drink and his son had vanished!
Draco’s legs felt like jelly as he walked down the corridor towards the Head Auror’s office. He’d managed to avoid the man for the past 4 months, not that it has been easy. He’d spent many of his lunches in the toilets in the code breaker break room, knowing the Auror spent many of his own lunches hoping to catch Draco.
Draco still missed him, was the conclusion he made. But Harry obviously didn’t miss him.
He trudged down into the Common Room and noticed Hermione and Pansy who has been whispering rapidly in the corner both stop and stare at him. His friend offered him a weak smile which he ignored. “If everyone’s done staring, I’ll be in McGonagall’s office if anyone would like to stalk me!” He ended his sentence with a shout and a wave of his arms, which caused all of the eighth years to do anything but look at him, let alone follow him.
“Hey, baby, how are you feeling now?” The voice was full of sympathy but Draco wasn’t in the mood for forgiveness. “Shit, and it’s all you fault you prick”. Harry chuckled as he came to sit on the end of the bed. He ran his hand up Draco’s side and rubbed his back in circles, which caused Draco to involuntarily sigh and turn towards Harry.
“Jacob!” Draco exclaimed as he entered the common room. A few heads turned in his direction as he embraced the Ravenclaw. “Draco, il est injuste que vous obtenez tous les bons!”
They’d barely spoken to each other during their so called “8th year”. But they constantly caught each other’s eye and Draco had spent many late, late nights
“Well I for one think the 25th Anniversary was a lot classier than this” snipped Draco as he and Harry walked down a red carpet towards the main ballroom. Harry chuckled at his husband and pulled him into his chest, wrapping his arms lightly around Draco’s waist.
Harry missed the blond profoundly, but he knew he had to keep his distance.
“No! No he’s still here listen, James! James baby where are you?” Draco cooed.
“But you didn’t. You’re Harry Potter. If you really wanted to not do it, they wouldn’t have been able to make you”.
“Mum!” Groaned Ginny, her brothers chuckled but the group had now turned to face Harry, who had no idea what to say. “Uh, well, I think it’s something me and Gin need to talk more about-“ he was cut off by Molly tutting. “What’s there to talk about? You two belong together!” He turned to Ginny who smiled awkwardly at him. “Well,”
Sad unrequited love drabble. Very short, no smut
He crept up to the sofa and knelt down at the side of Harry’s head, and shook his shoulder lightly.
“So, Draco. Tell me what’s going on.” She sat in the plush arm chair that had appeared in the room of requirement. He let out a deep breath. “I’m going to tell you everything, then you’re going to help”. She nodded. “Me and Harry Potter have been fucking on and off for the past 3 months.” He opened his eyes and looked at her. “I assumed it was something like that, he’s always looking at you with such possessiveness in his eyes.” She replied, nodding.Draco looked away. He then told her all the details of what was happening, and had happened. She just continued to nod. “You know what you have to do, then, don’t you? Make him feel what you’re feeling when you look at him and Ginny. Get with Jacob, put up with him until Harry comes to his senses or then you can switch Zambinis”. Draco laughed. “And what will make Blaise want me if I get with his bloody cousin, Pans?” She had a dangerously evil smile on her face. She told him what to do, and his eyes went wide. “Well, I guess that’s that, then. Avoid him at all costs Draco, do not let yourself give in, and for the sake of all things Slytherin go clean yourself up! You look a mess, and you’re better than this.” With that, she got up and left, obviously on a mission.
“Night guys”
“Did you, did you really expect me to stay. Potter?” Draco managed between the intense thrusts. Harry didn’t say anything. He took his hand away from the blonde’s now reddened neck, causing him to let out a whimper. His thrusts rapidly increased as Draco pushed his hips back against him, shouting out in pleasure. He felt his face be pushed down into the desk by a strong hand, his partner’s grunts growing louder before they both finally reached climax.
Another week goes by before Harry gets to see Draco again. Hermione told him that Pansy told her that Draco and the 6th year, or was he technically a 7th year?, were together. Draco had become very good at avoiding him but he wasn’t going to let that stop him. It was the party that evening, and he knew Draco would be getting ready upstairs. Harry himself had picked out a simple but striking outfit- tight black jeans and an impossibly tight black shirt that looked like it would rip over his bulging shoulders. His dark skin and messy curls complemented his outfit. He’d always remained white self conscious even though he was so physically fit now. He took a deep breath before heading upstairs to see Draco, and he ran into Blaise on his way. “Oh, sorry mate, are you looking for Draco?” He paused on the stairs next to the Slytherin. “Yeah, is he upstairs?” Blaise nodded. “Mind, that cousin of mine will be here any minute to take him to the party, I’ll let Ginny know you’re on your way if I see her” he nodded at him. “Cheers, mate.” How did Blaise know Ginny would be there? He shook his head. He was overthinking everything.
“Tho wasn’t meant to happen”. The raven haired boy tried to argue. “I had everything set up! You were meant to have a normal day and come home to the suprise and then we’d go to the party and we’d dance and sing and then, then I was meant to propose and you’d say yes and we’d come home and-“
and he deserved more than that.
“Your majesty, or, no your highness” he stumbled over his words before bowing. “I am Neville, Neville Longbottom sir from the Northern Province, I am my own lord as I have no parents to speak of. I am sorry that my face may not be the most attractive, but this scar will forever be apart of me. I am willing to be a wife, though I don’t know why we must call it a wife, if you will have me.” He bowed again before stepping backwards.
“NO! I will not lose you again! Leaving on that mission was the biggest mistake I have ever made, alright? I quit as soon as I got back and, and I’ve been trying to find you to tell you how sorry I am”.
He’d been back to Draco’s flat everyday waiting for him to turn up, but to no avail. He’d been to every house he could think of that Draco’s family owned or still own, he’d stalked both Blaise and Pansy but had had no luck.
“Your father told me about him being broke. And wanted me to do something about it, so I did. I knew he’d hit you the moment I saw you talking to Pansy, and I wanted to rip him apart right there”.
Savie was also part Veela, that is where she got her paleness from. She also told him that because her Papa is a Veela her eyes change colour depending on her mood. Red for anger, lilac for happiness, turquoise for sadness and they go slightly darker for fear.
The boys stood and hurried to follow her to her office. When they entered, she closed the door behind them. On opposite ends of the room, there were desks. Sat atop them was everything they would need for the exam.
This year went as smoothly as the last. Everyone was too caught up in the revelation that he was a parcelmouth, and the basilisk in the school, to notice anything else going on. The summer went much the same as the last.
Harry then turned to glare at Draco. "Oh merlin! Hunter
When they finally arrived at the school the sorting ceremony had just begun so they had to wait outside the Great Hall. Hadrian didn’t think that any other sorting had dragged on so long, but it could have just been the excitement of what they were going to do. When it was over he turned to his friends and announced, “Right then, let’s cause some mischief.” Before sending the spell at the door.
Aunt Petunia and Dudley were out on a week trip with some of her friends. They had left at 9pm and were to arrive back at Number 4 Privet Drive on 8
By the time he crawled into bed that night, his bones aching from exhaustion, he could feel his face straining from all the smiling he was doing. Before he drifted off to sleep, he remembered the students his own age he spoke to.

Tearing his eyes away from his friend on the floor, the man picked the child up and carried him down the stairs, still in a daze. He made sure to hold his godsons head away from his father’s limp form on the floor as he left the house.
