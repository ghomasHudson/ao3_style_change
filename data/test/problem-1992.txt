“No,” Harry said tonelessly. “I’m fine, Auror Ryker. Thank you for bringing this to me. I have a lot of work to catch up on.”
With Scorpius being cared for by his mother until his heat passed, he knew he should have woken up to an engorged chest.
He wanted Harry to feel hurt like him. He wanted to wipe that smug smile off his perfect lips. He wanted to break down crying.
Theo gave a curt nod and helped Draco down from the door of the stall. He walked over and took the reins from Potter, leading the large stallion outside into the drizzling rain.
Draco could smell his Alpha pheromones, musky and strong in the air around them even though they were outdoors.
Narcissa glanced up, her eyes widening with surprise. “Oh, just ignore me. I tend to overshare, Mr. Potter. Draco would be so cross with me if he found I was divulging so much. Mummy worries too much, doesn’t he, dearest?” she asked Scorpius, nuzzling against the top of his head.
Harry had thought that maybe it was because of their age difference. Did Draco want someone like that
Harry knew he needed to regain control of himself, but it was almost impossible when Draco was wantonly rubbing against him, his slick wetting the crotch of Harry’s trousers and his aching, trapped cock.
him talk. When my herbivore acts out of line, a suitable punishment is due. They only learn by rectification, Potter.”
In all of his life, no one had ever dared lay a hand upon him. Not even his father. That Potter was planning to punish him by
Harry pulled back; his pupils dilated so much his eyes appeared fully black. “This is the way it must be.”
His stomach rebelled at the sudden motion and he was already regretting his choice to drink the night before. He absentmindedly reached for Scorpius to nurse him, like they usually did in their morning ritual. When his hand met an empty space on the sheets, he sat up.
Harry carefully extracted himself, rolling to his back next to Draco, his chest heaving with deep breaths.
! I meant, you could just wet your fingers in your mouth and…rub them,” he finished weakly. “That would be less…
Something Draco felt was slipping through his fingers lately. He needed to hold onto it or there would be no future for him and his pup.
Roland had graduated from Hogwarts several years before him. They had sorted him into Slytherin and he came from a long line of pure-blooded witches and wizards.
”Harry,” Draco whispered, reaching up and cupping his jaw. His let his thumb linger against the curve of Harry’s lips, watching him visibly swallow. “What are you trying to tell—“
He climbed into bed behind Draco and helped him out of his clothes, grateful for his help due to the alcohol still making his movements clumsy and stilted. When they were both down to just their underwear, Harry spooned Draco from behind. He pulled the covers over all three of them, making Draco release a soft sigh.
Narcissa Malfoy still had something she loved. Something to be used against her. A slow smile curled Harry's lips.
Draco’s slick was now dripping to the plush rug beneath their feet and Harry fought the urge to get to the floor and lick up the sweet nectar.
Harry scoffed. “Please, Draco. Let’s not waste time with your theatrics, shall we? A skilled liar, you are not, pet. I think that’s what I like most about you—your
for me, spreading your legs every night until my seed quickens inside of you. When you become pregnant—and you
She gazed blankly at the patterned rug beneath her heels, following the intricate octagonal design with her eyes. Ron had purchased it as a surprise for her on one of his business trips to Egypt as an Auror. Harry had been with him on the trip when he was still working for the Ministry…
“Well,” Harry said, standing up from his father’s chair, “then I guess there’s nothing left for us to discuss. I’m sorry for misinterpreting our relationship. You’re his mother, Draco, but I
Ender jolted and missed catching his wand. It landed in front of him, sparks still shooting from the tip until finally, it fizzled out.
He hated the desperate lilt to his voice, but it was becoming clear that his mother intended for him to be sent away for a long while and they’d never been parted for more than a day since he was born.
With that, Harry wordlessly pulled him forward and they walked past a shocked Roland. They exited the bathroom, trying not to stumble as he tried to keep up with Harry’s long-legged strides as he walked him into the restaurant’s dining area.
”What else are they good for? They’ve no way to defend themselves and most of them were forced into labor or subservient roles after the War anyway.”
Harry’s rabbit slowly maneuvered to his hands and knees between Harry’s spread legs. He was small enough to fit, the tips of his lax ears just breaching the surface of the water.
The slick leaking from the boy’s hole paired with the water, easing the glide and making his rabbit emit needy sounds as Harry leisurely fucked between his cheeks.
What would happen if he did? Would the Healer report Harry to the Ministry? Would he be able to go back to Collioure?
“I was going to whip your soft hands as punishment but seeing as they’re in the process of forming calluses, I’ll have to deliver your punishment in another way.”
“It will be all right, baby,” Harry reassured. “I’ll be there with you when we tell him. I’d never let him hurt you.”
Sighing, he lifted up the hem of his jumper, examining his pale, flat stomach. He placed his free hand on his belly, rubbing it softly.
It was worse than anything Harry could physically torture him with and that’s when Draco snapped, his instincts screaming with rejection from his Alpha.
The Malfoy name would be reduced to ash soon enough if his father didn’t abate his gambling addiction.
Once he hastily wrapped his scarf around his neck, he turned to give one last look at Harry. He was still sleeping, his hand pressed against the spot where Draco had been laying.
Draco wrapped a supportive arm around his stomach, clumsily slipping forward on his wet feet. Before he could hit the floor, Harry scooped him up into a bridal carry.
”I’m perfectly capable of taking care of my child on my own, Mr. Potter. You needn’t concern yourself with such things. Don’t you have more important things to do besides going on B&E investigations for the Ministry? Every time I open the Prophet, your face is plastered all over it.”
“All right. Sometimes it’s hard adapting to life on our own. The stipend checks from the Ministry come once a month, but I’ve been trying to find a job that suits my interests and works with Jellybean’s school schedule.”
The bleak atmosphere and dank, echoing corridors was accompanied by the sound of the howling winds outside. The sound of the crashing waves against the stone walls of the magically enforced fortress was surely eroding the prisoners’ minds as sure as the cliff faces the prison was built on.
He wanted to establish trust with the little one and the only way to do that was to ease into things.
His dada turned, stooping to whisper in one of his ears, “Go to the kitchen and help Pansy prepare the food, sweetheart. I’ll be in the dining room with my friends. Be a good boy tonight and I’ll reward you when we get home.”
“What is it, sweetheart?” he asked, lightly rubbing his lips against Draco’s and smiling when his Omega moaned softly.
“Fine,” Harry said stiffly, pulling out of Draco. “Stay on the edge for the rest of the night. You need to come, lest you harm our pup with your stress. I won’t fuck you tonight and I won’t transfer my magic as a punishment. Perhaps your imaginary Alpha can keep you company during your nightmares tonight.”
Draco averted his gaze, staring at the floor instead. “It’s not like that, Harry, I just...we need to have set boundaries if we’re going to be...friends.”
Hermione turned to glare at him. “I’m not downplaying her involvement as a Death Eater during the War
Harry went completely still, his jaw hardening. Draco had seen Harry when he was mad, and this…this was something entirely different.
“Yes. Your parents were Death Eaters. I know she never told you about her past or your father’s past, but I will tell you this: they were murderers. They were loyal to the man that killed my parents.”
Harry tucked himself back into his trousers, zipping back up. His eyes had that cruel glint back, his emotions indecipherable due to his steadfast shields.
After standing there for a moment, trembling and trying to accept the fact that he may have made a horrible mistake, he raised his head, his eyes narrowing.
Juni made a small noise, pointing to her Cornish Pixie doll that had fallen to the floor sometime during dinner. It was a hideous thing, but Theo had brought it home for her one day from Diagon Alley and she had loved it to pieces since.
“Right,” Harry said dryly, pulling back slightly. “I know disgust when I see it, Draco. I’ve become quite familiar with looks of pity and horror, but above all,
He bit his lower lip between his teeth, his cock throbbing under his touch. It was all wrong. His hands were too soft, he needed the rough touch of…
A muscle jumped in the man’s jaw. “Do you make a habit of questioning your employers when they give you a direct order?”
(Another Harry POV because let’s be honest, Draco ain’t thinkin’ bout much except bangin’ in this chapter.)
Draco tightened his hand against his stomach, casting a surreptitious look at the closed door of the exam room. Harry had left to walk Hermione out and he knew he didn’t have much time.
“Just leave me alone,” he whispered, feeling nothing but disgust for himself and his earlier forced confession.
His mother nodded, a small smile turning up her full lips. “I have the utmost confidence in you, Harry. Now, what is the meaning of this little impromptu meeting? Is everything all right?”
His mother was dressed in a modest floral-printed summer dress that matched the teacups, most likely deliberate on her part. His mother liked to coordinate.
Draco nodded, not meeting Potter’s cold gaze and keeping his eyes on the shiny black leather of his riding boots.
Harry stood suddenly, walking around the table to stand in front of him. Draco had to crane his neck to look up at him, fighting the intense urge to fall into his arms.
Draco shook his head, biting his lower lip between his teeth to stave off anymore embarrassing sounds from leaving his throat.
“Yes,” Draco croaked, on the edge of bursting into irrational tears. “My father is just...too much sometimes.”
He silently roared, beating at the memory with his fists, wanting to return to that moment and tell Draco—
They were only centimeters apart now, Draco’s Omega pheromones thick and heavy in the air surrounding them.
The only indication that he actually understood Harry was when he would nod or shake his head in response to his
He reached down and cupped Draco under his arms, pulling him back up to the sofa. He helped him lay down on his back and got to his knees overtop him, his heavy erection bobbing as he repositioned them both.
Whatever Draco wanted him to see, he wasn’t sure if he was ready. He admittedly was still hurt, his pride still stinging from Draco’s rejection.
Sure enough, there was a plain brown envelope on their kitchen table. It looked rough, stained with some unknown substance and claw marks from the owl adorning the front.
Without a word, Draco had abruptly left the table. Harry hadn’t tried to stop him, wanting to give him his space. The boy had been basically sold into slavery for carnivores and it was a fact that Harry had become uncomfortable with. His friends and co-workers showed disdain for herbivores and if they knew of Harry’s intimate interactions with his rabbit, they’d surely be disgusted.
He let out a low groan and sucked the wet bud into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks as he pulled milk from the boy’s swollen tit. The taste of Draco’s milk against his tongue made his cock pulse with
“It’s none of your business,” he replied weakly. “Just go back to whatever else you were doing before being assigned as my devoted stalker.”
Arlen nodded distractedly, rolling up Draco’s shirt to press a hand against his lower stomach. “You could say that. People who aligned with the wrong beliefs, lost souls, what have you.”
When he had been captured, he had spent so much time caged and afraid. It had traumatized him, the things he had seen. He didn’t like thinking about those things and they often snuck up on him in his dreams.
Hermione shifted closer to him. “If it’s about Draco, you could talk to me about, you know? I’m your friend. If something happened between you two...”
Harry let out a low chuckle, pressing his lips against Draco’s warm ear. “I could smell you all day, Draco. It wasn’t your normal scent, no. Do you want to know how I knew you went into heat?” he whispered, letting his tongue briefly flick out to lick Draco’s earlobe.
Harry grinned, carrying him up the stairs. “I’ll have to let the Ministry know that Firewhisky is a much better truth serum than Veritaserum.”
He stared at the broken pieces of glass laying on the floor, thinking about how they resembled his heart.
Being a father had never been at the forefront of his mind and now that he was in his late thirties, it was something he expected he would never take the role of. Maybe one day when they were older, they would broach the topic of possible adoption, but for right now things were perfect the way they were.
The smooth, jeweled black surface shone under the light, a sharp contrast to Draco’s porcelain skin.
The outline of Potter’s thick erection was visible against the front of his trousers, the material damp and darkened from Draco’s own prick rubbing wetly against it.
Narcissa’s pupils burst at the edges, becoming an obsidian vortex that sucked Harry in and covered his own vision in a miasma of suffocating black. The black slowly bled into flashing colors: gray, white, and then the colors slowly took shape.
Draco had bent his legs and spread them, his pink little hole glistening with slick as it clenched and unclenched, seeming to obscenely beckon Harry. Milk from his leaking tits had sluiced down his stomach and past his prick, droplets of it clinging to the curve of his arse.
“I’m sorry if it’s too direct of a question, Draco…but, what happened with the boy’s Alpha? He should be here, protecting you both and providing you comfort.”
No doubt because they saw that Harry was a wolf. He could smell their fear, his nostrils slightly flaring as his mouth instinctively pooled with saliva in response.
His lips curled, excitement and anticipation warring with the sudden violent wave of possessiveness he felt.
Harry had ordered Kreacher to care for the boy until his heat was fully upon him. He didn’t trust himself around Draco right now.
To think that Draco was suffering through the painful side effects of quitting breastfeeding because of his need to please his insufferable father…
Narcissa’s eyed widened, her shoulders loosening. “Draco? What about Draco?” she visibly swallowed, her cracked lips parting on a shaky exhale, “is he…all right?”
Harry lowered their joined hands back to the sofa and turned to look at his mother again. His free hand was still securely on Scorpius’ back, their pup nestled up against Harry’s heart as he continued to sleep.
Draco’s cheeks suffused with heat, feeling guilty. Blaise was only trying to cheer him up. He had to stop thinking about Harry Potter and enjoy time with his friend, who had been endlessly patient with him the past few months.
Harry glanced up and smiled. “Good morning, Draco. I made coffee and breakfast. Are you feeling well enough to eat?”
Draco nodded and pressed to his tiptoes, nuzzling against the stubbled underside of his dada’s jaw submissively. His dada gave a low, approving growl in response.
Harry was glowering down at him with hardened eyes, his lips set in a grim line. “Like I said, don’t think you can weaponize your body against me, Draco. The only thing you’ll give me is children, and the only thing you’ll get from me is my cum. There will be nothing else connecting us.”
Harry shook his head. “I wouldn’t do that to you while you’re in heat, Draco. I promise you; we didn’t have sex. When you finally fell asleep, I took you back to my home. I was just worried about leaving you alone. I couldn’t just…
Draco sighed in relief, pulling Harry’s jacket closed around his shoulders, partly shielding his nursing pup from view. “I’m sorry again for intruding like this. I can probably stay with my friend for a few days. Blaise has his own place now and I know he hasn’t taken a mate yet, so he’ll probably have room for us. At least temporarily.”
The Aurors he’d stationed at their home gave him a report each day and nothing of consequence had happened yet. Harry had just barely been able to stop himself from going there himself and demanding that Draco talk with him.
The alpha was much stronger than Draco and he couldn’t hold back a soft whimper as Potter squeezed him in warning.
copulation. The sharing of one’s own inherent magic with their mate to strengthen the vulnerable fetus and promote growth in the early stages.
An open wound inside of him that even his daughter couldn’t heal. It would continue to bleed, spilling parts of himself that he could never get back.
No matter what he did, the ache in his chest wouldn’t abate and his nipples only seemed to become more swollen as the days went by. He had read that an Omega would need his Alpha’s healing saliva, especially during pregnancy to alleviate any discomfort his body would undergo as it changed and adjusted to accommodate his pup.
Hermione Granger-Weasley stepped through the Floo of her home, shaking the excess powder from her riotous curls.
His small, leaking hole looked irritated from his claw, the rim slightly reddened. Clear slick seeped from his hole, trailing down his inner thighs. Droplets of water clung to his twitching tail, his tight, pink sac drawn up below his tiny, leaking Omega prick.
Draco writhed beneath his mouth, his hard prick laying against his flat, pale stomach and messily drizzling pre-cum across his abdomen as he squirmed.
He knelt and helped Narcissa to her feet. She gave him a guarded, quizzical look, shrinking back in fear.
“Stop thinking about him,” he admonished himself aloud, pushing open the men’s bathroom door in the corridor.
Draco knew that when he would go into heat, the amount slick his body produced would double and his skin would feel as if were on fire.
“S-sorry!” Draco stammered, trying to cover his chest with his free arm. “I haven’t nursed all day and I start to leak if I don’t let him feed regularly throughout the day.”
Her hand slid from his shoulder, dropping listlessly to her lap. She stared straight ahead, pain etched across her pale features.
With his father so deep into his gambling debts, he didn’t know what alpha would want him. He would be lucky to even be married into an upper middleclass family with the way things were going.
The side of the man’s full lips were doing that twitching motion again where it looked like he was going to smile, but never did.
Harry’s cock was hard, pressing against the leg of his trousers. It was long and thick, the enticing edges noticeable against the thin fabric. Draco was ashamed to feel saliva flood his mouth at the sight.
The sound of Draco’s parents’ voices drifted in from the terrace, making him cast Harry a beseeching look. Harry wordlessly took Draco’s hand into his own and lifted it to his lips, pressing a chaste kiss to the back of it.
The taste of his Alpha’s fluids made desire unfurl low in stomach, his prick hardening between his legs.
and when he watched himself cup Draco’s belly with his other hand, he saw something in his eyes that—
Ever since Theo had disappeared, Draco’s body was craving an alpha’s presence. His pregnancy made it even worse. With Harry so close to him, he felt the inane urge to bare his throat.
The scent that met his nostrils made him halt, a low growl escaping him. He hadn’t smelled it in a while, but it was unmistakable to him.
“Even if you refuse to see it, you helped me. Your visits were a reprieve for me. You’ll never know how much life you breathed into me during our visits. In a way, you helped me get through the worst of it. I think…if I hadn’t of had you, I would have never made it.
His mother’s eyes darted back and forth between Harry and Draco, her full lips turning down in reproach.
“He didn’t tell you?” Hermione asked. “Well, I suppose it’s a tough thing for him to talk about. Her name was Lily and his father’s name was James.”
Draco’s heart clenched, hooking his feet around Harry’s waist. He wrapped both of his arms around Harry’s neck, pulling him down to press his lips against his ear.
and the child you carry will always bind you to me. We are forever entwined, no matter how much you want to deny it.”
The boy nodded vigorously, his wet ears swaying in the water. He arched his back, opening himself even further to Harry’s eyes.
He kept blaming his feelings on his instincts, but he didn’t even believe himself anymore. It was more than instincts. He
Arlen remained silent, walking into the lift after Draco. When the doors closed, Arlen cleared his throat.
. He had claimed him as his own. For all Draco knew, he was currently growing their pup inside of him.
“I-I don’t know if we should do this,” he whispered, tilting his head to give Harry better access and belying his own words.
“Take care with how you speak to me, Draco. Do not forget that your mother is in the Ministry’s clutches. If I wished it, I could make her stay at Azkaban much more…unpleasant.” Harry leaned down, running the tip of his nose against Draco’s jaw. “If you’re a good boy, I’ll rethink your harsh words. Perhaps your mother would like a visit from me. Azkaban is such a dreadfully desolate place after all. A word from me, and the Aurors on duty will make Narcissa their special project.”
“The trick is never letting them rest long,” Harry murmured to Scorpius. “One day, I’ll teach you all the secrets of the world, but for now, this will do.”
With the warm sunlight embracing them both and Hermione’s arms around him, he didn’t feel numb anymore.
, he would need someone by his side through this. If the Wizengamot found him guilty, he would be serving an unknown amount of time in Azkaban as punishment. Even if Harry was truly guilty of the heinous things he had admitted to, he was still Hermione’s friend. Years of friendship, trust, and love didn’t just
Their bond flowed freely between them, cocooning Draco in a wave of warmth and satedness. Sleep finally dragged him under, feeling safe with his pup in his arms and their Alpha holding them close.
Harry arched a brow, feigning deep concern. “Ah, you’re absolutely right, dove. Bring it closer, I’ll kiss it better.”
The boy blinked, confusion evident in his large, pale eyes. His ears flattened against the back of his head and he wrinkled his small nose.
His daughter looked unconvinced, a calculating glint in her green eyes. “Are you telling me the truth?”
Harry looked down at Scorpius, who was busy fiddling with one of the buttons on his dress shirt with his pudgy fingers.
His mother was watching them both with a sly smile turning up her full lips. “I suppose honesty is the theme of today’s meeting,” she drawled playfully. “Which I’m happy about it. It seems you both are quite taken with one another, so far be it from me to get in between true love.”
, Draco,” Harry said hoarsely, trying to think of the most revolting, vile things he could as Draco began licking his neck.
He knew that if he gave in and fucked his little Omega, Draco would wake up at the end of his  heat and be furious with him. Harry couldn’t stand to see Draco looking at him again like he had that day when he’d left his home by Floo. His gray eyes had been shuttered of all emotion and it had
In all the books he’d read, they had recommended letting your Alpha suckle out some of your leftover supply if your baby had begun tapering off your breast milk. An Alpha’s healing saliva could counteract any swelling or engorged nipples that may have befallen an Omega attempting to quit breastfeeding.
He had considered sending the boy flowers like some lovesick fool but had decided against it. He didn’t want to come off like some old creep, pining for the beautiful teenager who had spurned him.
The boy looked up, his eyes appearing watery. He pushed past Harry and clambered onto his bed, lying flat on his back. He pulled up his large shirt, exposing his prick and chest.
Harry shrugged and smirked. “It’s my job to know your schedule, princess. I can come with you to your parents to pick up Juniper as well. You both shouldn’t be alone right now.”
Draco swallowed thickly, letting out a soft gasp when the alpha began dragging him toward the front of the stables.
Draco whined, the ache intensifying and demanding attention. He undulated against Potter’s lap, rubbing their erections together roughly in attempt to stave off some of the ramping desire within him.
The dark velvet drapes on the tall windows in the room were partially open. It had grown darker outside, dusk fast approaching and the grey overcast skies outside now slate colored as the sun had begun to set.
Harry leaned against the wall next to the cell door, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ve come with the intent of relaying good news.”
Harry could feel his knot swelling at the base of his shaft and was disappointed Draco wasn’t actually in heat.
Harry kissed the boy’s burgeoning prick, letting one of his fangs softly scrape down the side of his shaft. “Tell Dada,” he said throatily. “Tell me.”
Casting a look back at the boy, he watched as he began curiously sniffing at an open container of coffee grounds.
It was dark out now and the boy was bounding from one end of Harry’s bedroom to other, giggling while he did. The baggy shirt he wore had slipped down, revealing one of his pale shoulders. His blond hair was unkempt and slightly oily around his ears, making Harry frown.
The rabbit had begun shrilly squeaking and wildly writhing in his arms when Harry had tried lowering him into the tepid bath water.
Narcissa was staring at Draco, her full lips pressed into a thin line. He knew that his mother could see beneath his façade.
Draco flushed even more, leaning more towards Harry, as if he were unconsciously doing it. “They do...I nursed Scorpius when I got up and my nipples weren’t as swollen as before.”
Draco picked up the knife with a shaky hand, brandishing it. He pulled himself up on unsteady legs, feeling ridiculously vulnerable standing naked in front of his terrifying Alpha.
Harry had changed him out of his tattered clothing when he’d brought him home and put one of his old white dress shirts on him. It was far too big for Draco, the hem hitting mid-thigh.
When the years continued to pass and he had never taken on a mate, Hermione had chalked it up to his inability to commit, but had it been something deeper?
It was only after he’d left London that he’d had any kind of reprieve from the intrusive public eye.
Draco arched his back, his scut meeting Harry’s coarse pubic hair when he was finally fully sheathed within his rabbit.
His mother never allowed him to see any pictures of him growing up, but he could see the resemblance in himself.
He knew how independent Draco was, and even though Harry wanted to protect and provide for his Omega, he admired Draco’s stubborn refusal to bend
Rejection hurt but knowing that Harry was trying to move on and let their bond dissipate hurt even worse.
Draco’s head was resting on Harry’s chest. His eyes were closed, his breath gusting across Harry’s chest in slow pants.
Draco nodded slowly. “I know. I know that you do, and that’s okay. Sometimes, we can’t help who we love, even if that person isn’t worth loving.”
Harry slowed his pistoning cock, just barely moving inside of him now. “Tell me you love me, and I’ll make you come.”
The memory chapter is done, I just have to edit it. I didn’t want to combine it with this one because I want it to be on its own. I’ll upload it soon! Thank you for reading my story and I’m trying to reply to comments as quick as I can!
The boy gave a sharp cry, his cum spurting from the head of his prick and landing on his stomach and chest.
Draco nodded drowsily, the fuzziness in his head seeming to turn into syrup that was making him feel inexplicably exhausted.
He supposed that was what relationships were all about. Respecting someone’s boundaries while also being there for them if they ever needed someone to rely upon.
“You don’t have a choice in this—” Harry said roughly, attempting to place a hand on Draco’s waist to pull him back. Harry had reached down just as Draco had turned, his large hand ending up on his bump.
When he was done, he opened the stall door to find Harry Potter blocking his way, glowering down at him.
He lowered his head and lightly kissed down Draco’s throat, his lips hovering over his marked gland. “Do you want me to act as if we’re lovers, is that it?”
Harry took pity on him, angling his hips so that each of his thrusts rammed the head of his cock against his prostate.
The bond that would form between him and Roland if they signed the contract would be a farce. Just an exchange on paper that would inevitably have stipulations and addenda.
He knew that if he fully gave in, Harry would give them the world. He would be a good Alpha, a good mate, a wonderful
The feline witch arched an inquisitive brow, her pointed ears twitching irritably “Well, he can go help Pansy in the kitchen. He doesn’t need to speak to help with the food.”
He didn’t often think about the man who held him captive, but sometimes, during the darkest hours of the night when his daughter was sleeping and the world seemed silent, he did.
Harry leaned forward, brushing his parted lips against his ear. “You would beg for it, Draco. I took you for hours sometimes, until we were both covered in your slick and my cum. You weren’t satisfied unless your hole was dripping, filled to the brim with
Draco pressed his fingers to his hole, slipping the tips of index and middle finger easily past the tight ring of muscles.
Hermione felt as if the floor beneath her feet shifted. “Y-you must be mistaken. Harry would never do something like that, he—”
It was small and pure white, it’s fur almost silver in color. It trembled under the light of Harry’s wand.
The boy let out a high-pitched moan when Harry pressed his tongue even lower, against his leaking hole. The sweet taste of his slick emboldened Harry, making him push his stiffened tongue past the tight ring of muscles.
As if sensing his discomfort, Harry leaned down to let his lips brush across Draco’s forehead, murmuring a quick reassurance against his heated skin.
Harry shook his head. “He doesn’t want to talk to me. He thinks that by being with me, it will somehow take away his independence. I’d never try to stifle his freedom, though. I just want to...”
Harry chuckled, taking a sip of his drink. “Careful, Ron. I think she might try to seduce you tonight.”
He averted his mother’s seeking gaze and looked down to where Harry still held his hand, drawing strength from their burgeoning bond that seemed to only grow deeper the longer they were together.
Without any further preamble, Harry rammed his cock into Draco’s slick hole, a deep groan escaping him when the tight, wet channel eagerly sucked him in.
A tall boy to the side of the group chuckled loudly, his attention on his shorter friend that stood next him.
“I trust you’ll know how to behave when he does come to visit, pet. Do not forget about your pathetic mother, rotting away in Azkaban. If that’s not enough to convince you of good behavior, think about the innocent life that you may be carrying inside of you at this very moment. Without your Alpha around, your unborn child will suffer.
His eyes flickered down to where Draco was clutching his belly with his left hand, his attention on the wedding band that still encircled his finger. His features tightened.
Under the Alpha’s touch, he felt a small flutter in his stomach. A small whimper escaped Draco, his hand shooting down to press overtop Harry’s on his stomach.
He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his pup nudging insistently in his belly, making him aware of how badly he needed to relieve his bladder. The water soaking his slacks wasn’t helping, either.
When Draco licked his suddenly dry lips, Potter’s eyes tracked the movement.  He could feel a flush crawling up his neck and blooming hotly over his cheeks.
Floo powder plumed out from the hearth, particles floating around the space in front of Draco’s white uniform shoes.
, a strangled whine escaped him, reveling in the feeling of Harry’s tongue against his sensitive skin.
Draco huffed and turned to begin wiping food from Juni’s fingers with a washcloth he taken from the sink. “Well, I can’t Apparate while I’m pregnant, so it’s been difficult to lose you every time I notice you following me like some
Harry immediately recognized Narcissa’s regal tone and stepped into the office of one of the Aurors on his team.
She let out a delicate snort. “I suppose. Between my job and Rose graduating from Hogwarts, I haven’t had much time to myself lately. But anyway, how are you doing? How are you
“What the hell are you doing? Put your clothes back on and get away from me!” Draco shouted, scrambling backwards on the bed.
How was it that Harry always knew the right thing to say? He wished he had that ability. He wished he wasn’t so scared.
Harry shrugged. “Children are honest and open creatures. If you show them kindness, they’ll return it tenfold. Not like adults, so jaded and guarded. With children, I’ve always been comfortable because they’re completely honest with their emotions. Quite a rare thing that is for adults.”
The rabbit’s scent allowed Harry to gauge his mood. Right that moment, the rabbit was exuding satisfaction and...
Harry grabbed his wrist, pulling Draco’s hand down. He kissed the inside of his wrist, his stubble lightly scraping against his skin and making him shiver.
Angrily flipping back the covers, he swung his legs over the side of the bed. When he stood, he noticed that he was wearing an overly large dress shirt and nothing else. He reached under the collar, gingerly prodding his small breasts with his fingers.
“It’s no problem at all, Draco. Try to get some rest while I’m gone and try not worry. Everything will be fine.”
Ron had known the chances of conception and hadn’t wanted to take any risks. Hermione had ended up carrying Rose to full term, but the nine months she’d been pregnant had been stressful on her, mentally and physically.
at Ginny’s offer, his eyes narrowing. Ginny was so much older than him with more experience and a grounded career. She was also beautiful and poised, exuding confidence Draco
Harry picked up the book from the floor that had fallen from his hand while he’d slept. “Curious about me? You need only ask.”
Harry was dressed almost entirely in black, his raven hair roguishly mussed in the way that Draco loved—
Draco shook his head, dazedly rocking his hips against the ridge of Harry’s erection under his underwear. “N-no, please, just go. Leave me alone.”
Draco nervously cleared his throat and walked into the room, stopping just in front of the desk and imposing man.
While most of his friends had found mates and settled down, Harry had continued living as a bachelor well into his thirties. While his friends had more children, he had gotten more promotions.
”Just standard procedure. Your mother informed us that the wards were taken down. It would take quite a skilled witch or wizard to do that. Your mother also told us that the wards your father put in place should have been basically impenetrable.”
Arlen had told him what to expect with contractions and he was almost sure what he was experiencing was Braxton Hicks. False labor pains, Arlen had said. They were common in the third trimester, so Draco hadn’t told Harry about it.
His hated tone made Draco’s ears burn with mortification. “I-it’s not because of you, it’s the pregnancy. I
He gently placed the jacket over the boy’s shoulders, letting his fingers linger against the back of his neck for a moment. He just barely restrained the urge to lean down and fucking
The rabbit pressed his nose against Harry’s open palm, nuzzling into it. Harry cupped the boy’s cheek, letting his thumb slide over his cheekbone.
Harry quickly stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray next to his sofa and stood up. “It’s all right, Draco. Did you need something?”
His checkups at St Mungo’s felt like a reprieve. Hermione even sometimes accompanied them, and he had grown close to his Healer, Arlen. The kind Alpha was his assigned Healer for the duration of his pregnancy and Draco enjoyed their pleasant chitchat.
Everything in him rebelled at the idea of never talking to the Alpha again. Multiple times, he had found himself standing in front of his Floo, Scorpius perched on his hip in preparation to travel to Harry’s home unannounced. He had always been able to just barely stop himself from going.
Harry had only been able to stare at the rabbit’s pink, pebbled nipples, jutting out wantonly from his white fur. They had been wet, sheening with his saliva.
Harry’s smile faltered. “I’m here with Hermione and Ron. They came to see Rose for the festival. Ginny came, too.”
him. He wanted to get that intoxicating, sweet smell in his mouth and on his fucking tongue. He wanted to rub his
Draco tried to slap his hands away, heat creeping up his neck. “It’s just the hormones. Get off me, Potter. I don’t need to be coddled—”
Unable to stop himself, he dropped to his knees in front of Harry, wanting to show his Alpha just how much he wanted him.
Draco shook his head, tears sliding down his cheeks. He sprinted from the room, leaving Harry alone.
As he came down, he barely registered Harry crawling up his body and positioning the head of his cock against his slick-covered hole.
Draco whimpered and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, pressing their chests together as he continued ruthlessly pounding into him, chasing his own orgasm.
Narcissa shook her head, her perfectly groomed hair not moving an inch with the motion. “No, no. He’s overly careful. He thinks it will mess with his breast milk supply. If you ask me, Scorpius needs to be weaned. He’s much too old to still be nursing.”
Harry was the first one to slowly pull back, smiling as his eyes darkened. “Another one of your firsts that belongs to me,” he purred, quickly leaning forward to swipe his tongue against Draco’s trembling lower lip before pulling away again, “and what an impassioned first it was. Where is that hate you always speak of, Draco?”
Draco suspected it was because of his own mood. He had been admittedly sulking the past week and dreading the fallout of his admission to Harry.
Harry’s expression morphed into one of fury. He grabbed Draco’s hands and shoved him back onto the bed, placing his knees on either side of his hips. He pinned Draco’s wrists to the bed next his head, pressing down until it was almost painful.
Draco’s prick began hardening under Harry’s rough fingertips as he squeezed out more of his milk from his sensitive bud. He stared down at him with hooded eyes, his gaze on the front of Draco’s slowly dampening shirt.
”You can’t keep avoiding me, Draco. The Ministry assigned me to watch over you while they look into Notts’ disappearance. Using your magic to knock over a display of fruit in the middle of a Muggle market in order to slip away from me isn’t what I would deem
They both stood in front of Harry’s Floo, having just returned from Malfoy Manor. Harry was still holding their sleeping pup, Scorpius snuffling noisily against the scent gland on Harry’s neck as he snoozed.
“Wordless spells,” Draco murmured. “You’ve always been skilled with them. I suppose that’s why you’re an asset to the Ministry’s protection department. The
He jumped when he heard a pained roar behind the door, something crashing against the closed door from the other side.
He loved his baby, but he wanted to make his own decisions moving forward and he wouldn’t embarrass himself by doing something else that would only result in him depending on someone else for his son’s or his own well-being
While Draco had grown up, his father had made him feel as if he weren't enough. He knew without a doubt that Harry would never make Scorpius feel as if he weren't enough. Harry would be there for Scorpius always, no matter what.
Draco had fortunately not come into contact with the manor’s cruel master again. Their first meeting had left him unnerved.
If Harry had knotted him during his heat, there could be a babe already growing within him at that very moment.
The young man’s pup was sitting on his hip, his tiny fists balled against Draco’s chest. Draco’s gray eyes were reddened, his arms wrapped tightly around Scorpius. Draco’s blond hair was in disarray, the collar of his dark gray button-down slightly askew.
Harry’s face went unnervingly blank before he strode forward, closing the distance between them in moments. He bent down until they were eye-level and Draco felt his knees go weak at the sudden influx of alpha pheromones surrounding him.
Draco leaned forward and lightly pressed his lips to Harry’s jaw, his lids drifting closed and a soft sigh escaping him.
euphoric spot inside of Draco. Harry released his nipple and pulled back, staring down at Draco with hooded eyes, his maddeningly slow thrusts never faltering.
Draco let out a choked sob, knowing that Harry was right. He had been treating Harry the exact same way and now Harry had given him a taste of his own medicine.
“I am, too,” Draco said coyly, reaching up to swipe up some syrup that had landed next to Harry’s dark nipple. He popped his finger into his mouth and sucked, holding Harry’s gaze.
Arlen studied him for a moment, his eyes softening. “I suppose that’s to be expected. Have you noticed any peculiar symptoms? Have your nipples been sensitive or darkened in color?”
Harry glanced down and saw that Draco’s bottoms were drenched in his slick, the wet material clinging to his cute, hard little prick.
Draco stumbled forward and around the desk, hurrying to close the distance between himself and the cruel man.
Draco glanced back at Jack and gave him a shy smile. “Thank you, Jack. I’ll try to bring Scorpius by sometime and I’ll remember to bring some baked goods for the rest of the team the next time as well.”
The disdain shown to herbivores had never appealed to Harry. To him, as a predator, they were just weaker creatures. Nothing more, nothing less.
Draco screwed his eyes shut, trying to adjust to Harry’s considerable girth as it stretched his lips. Shame made his ears burn, while twisted arousal made his prick throb and his hole leak.
The Healer at the Ministry who’d been monitoring his vitals had told Harry that Draco had been given a prolonged sleeping potion.
“Oh, let him live a little, Harry,” Hermione chided, softly patting Scorpius on the back. “I remember what it’s like to have a young one. You don’t get to let loose very often.”
Harry left the room but returned only moments later, his mask of indifference firmly in place. He walked over and untied one of Draco’s wrists and stepped back, tossing something onto the bed in front him.
He was glad that Master Potter had gone away on business. The last thing he needed during this adjustment period was the older man mercilessly taunting him.
Things had irrevocably shifted after Voldemort’s demise and herbivores were treated undeniably different now.
Draco choked when his cock hit the back of his throat, spittle escaping the sides of mouth and sluicing down the veins of Harry’s throbbing shaft.
His hand shot out, clamping around the boy’s ankle. With a low growl, he dragged the rabbit back towards him. He wanted to shift, to change to his wolf form. His instincts were screaming at him to
Narcissa nodded sharply. “Your father has a lot on his plate right now. He can’t be worrying about the house getting broken into right now.”
”Come for Dada, baby, talk to me. Tell Dada,” Harry urged hoarsely, pleasure building at the base of his spine.
His eyes searched Draco’s, once again trying to convey something to him that he had no idea of what was trying to be wordlessly said.
He also thought about the fact that if Scorpius wasn’t currently with him to nurse, he knew Draco’s breasts were probably painfully engorged again. Swollen and dripping that sweet ambrosia that Harry knew tasted like
Harry wasn’t that type of person. He would use the baby as leverage. He would use their unborn child to get Draco to do what he wanted.
“But you haven’t been, pet. You lied to me about your discussion with Hermione. I gave you a chance to be honest and you
Truthfully, he was glad he was naked right now. With the unforgiving heat suffusing every inch of skin, he felt unbearably hot.
Pansy stood and walked over to toss the eggs into the bin and went over to the basin to wash her hands. “Have you given any thought to the Alpha Interim Program?”
But there were flashes of himself inherent in her too. One of the biggest traits being her ability to easily forgive.
Coarse pieces of hay poked into Draco’s chest through his torn shirt, abrading his sensitive nipples.
Harry, the bastard, smiled smugly. “What? You said you’ve never been kissed. Shouldn’t your Alpha rectify that?”
“S-sorry,” he stammered, raising his hand to card his fingers through his hair in attempt to stop the dripping.
Narcissa was on her knees before him, rivulets of tears flowing in continuous streams down her face. She was clutching two handfuls of his shirt, her expression desperate.
He rolled the swollen nubs between his fingers, watching in rapt fascination as two small dribbles of milk leaked out from the pink tips.
“And I’d give my own life to,” he swallowed thickly before saying, “free my mother. She was untruthful to me about her past, but I’m not angry with her. I’d forgive her a thousand times over if I could just see her again.”
“Then that settles that, I suppose,” he murmured, brushing past Draco and walking towards a door off to the side of the study he hadn’t noticed before. “If you’re going to be under my employment, you should address me correctly. Respect is earned, not given.”
”Don’t pick an alpha yet. I’d have to clear anyone you pick, anyway. For safety reasons, of course. Just—wait.”
you,” Harry said, pausing for moment before continuing. “You said something strange in your sleep. You said that I’ve helped you through your heat
“What is it, sweetheart?” Harry rasped, unwinding Draco’s scarf from his neck and pressing open-mouthed kisses to his ear and throat.
He immediately released Harry’s arm and protectively hugged his stomach, pressing back against the dividing wall. “W-what do you mean by that?”
In the Wizarding World, Omegas often took suppressants or potions to lessen the effects of their heats.
“That’s probably the Watchwizard they sent from the Ministry,” Draco said mulishly, smoothing out the wrinkles from his emerald Healer scrub top. He was showing, but not much. A small, rounded bump under his top was the only evidence of his pregnancy and his baggy top hid it well.
One of the nights he was calming Draco from a nightmare, smoothing his blond hair back as he whispered assurances and soothing words. He had never allowed himself to be so open with another person, so
Harry hefted Draco’s bag higher on his shoulder and strode after him, the tether around his heart uncomfortably tight.
Draco felt a flare of irritation at Harry’s callous words. “My mother home schooled me. When my magic manifested, she did her best to teach me how to control and hone it.”
The boy was trembling under his hands, his pink rim stretched over his cock, his rabbit’s scut tickling Harry’s skin as the white fur pressed against his lower stomach.
“There’s nothing to talk about, Harry. Last night was a mistake. We shouldn’t have done that. You’re dating someone and I’m...”
Harry clenched his jaw, feeling his claws sprout even longer from his fingertips as his inner wolf fought for control.
The bed dipped under Harry’s weight and Draco flinched when he settled over top of him. He reluctantly turned to look at up him.
“I love you, Draco,” he whispered, closing his eyes. “I love you so much. When you refused me, I wanted to deny the way I felt about you. I tried so hard to deny it, but deep down, I knew you’d left an indelible mark on me. I knew I’d always love you, even if you would never love me back. You’re my mate and you are all I’ve ever wanted.”
Pansy laughed, pulling him into a tight hug. “I’ll be happy to take on all of your assignments if it’ll get you to
Harry silently followed him back downstairs. As soon as they entered his father’s study, Harry whirled on him. He backed Draco up against the closed door, slamming a hand next to his head and leaning down.
Draco cast a surreptitious glance down, his eyes following the thin line of sparse dark hair that traveled from Harry’s navel and down, to his erection.
from him! He was so set on following the Dark Lord’s orders that he failed to see what it was doing to his own
“Now, now. Don’t be shy, little one. I didn’t say that I didn’t enjoy your pathetic attempts to seduce me. It’s quite amusing. Go on, touch me. I’ll show you just how unaffected I am.”
Narcissa sighed, adjusting Scorpius’ tiny jacket. “No, nothing has happened. Auror Ryker was insistent that I come to the Ministry this week for a follow up interview about the events that happened.”
His pheromones enveloped Draco, making his lids grow heavy. The tension he hadn’t known he’d been carrying began spilling from his body in relieving waves.
Admittedly, it had taken him several attempts to pass the case file on. He’d sat in his office that morning, vacillating between keeping the file tucked safely away in his drawer or taking it to the Auror he’d meant to assign it to.
me you would be good, but it seems like I made a mistake in trusting you enough to remove your collar.”
He found himself entranced by everything the tall Alpha did. From the way his shoulder blades moved beneath his shirt on his broad back, to the way a lock of his raven hair kept falling forward before he would absentmindedly push it back.
His husband, Theodore Nott, had disappeared while on the job over four months ago. He was an Auror for the Ministry and had been collaborating with the Department of Mysteries on an open case.
Draco had let out a derisive snort and had shoved the book back on the shelf, disgusted with himself for even being curious.
He wanted to mate his rabbit. Breed him, fill him with pups, make him so swollen with his cum that his uterus would overflow with it.
“Okay, Harry,” he answered, his pulse thrumming quicker as his thoughts drifted to what Harry would do to him once they returned home.
requirements to the breeding law, however. Draco will have to be checked over at least once a month by a Healer from St Mungo’s and if he becomes pregnant, he will be under strict supervision of the hospital and the Ministry. All precautions, of course. A healthy, happy Omega means a healthy, happy pregnancy. You do understand, Harry?”
The rabbit’s fur brushed against his fangs with each lick, making Harry unable to repress a shudder.
He examined himself even closer in the bathroom mirror, his eyes lingering on the collar encircling his neck.
With that, Draco left a stoic Harry Potter standing in his living area, slamming the door to his flat behind him as he left for work.
“I know, but I should have been able to tell something was amiss at your checkups, but the bastard had all of us fooled. If I could have just—"
Some of the doors on his floor were locked, but some weren’t. One bedroom had coverings over all of the furniture, even on the lone portrait in the room. He uncovered some of the furniture, quickly realizing that the room must have belonged to a child or young adult, evidenced by some the more juvenile toys and magical baubles hidden within the dresser drawers.
Draco was writhing and keening beneath him, his fingers buried in Harry’s hair, holding his head to his chest as he suckled.
When he’d given birth at St Mungo’s in secret, all of the Healers had never ceased complimenting what a beautiful baby he was.
His heart clenched, uneasy with Draco and his pup leaving. He wouldn’t be able to protect them if they weren’t here, where he could keep an eye on them.
When their pup had nudged one of their feet against Harry’s palm on his stomach, something akin to excitement bubbled forth within Draco, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. When he had turned his head to look up at his Alpha, beaming up at him, that feeling was quickly doused.
Draco stared up at her, wavering. He so desperately wanted any type of human connection since he had arrived at the manor. It was a dreadfully lonely place and its oppressive atmosphere seemed to be closing in on him as the days went by.
A collar of burnished copper circled her throat, looking similar to his own collar. He wondered if it, too, repressed her magic. He glanced up at her torn ear and then back down to her black scut that poked out from the back of her threadbare trousers.
“About what?” Harry began smoothing back Draco’s hair with his hand, the motion lulling Draco into a sense of contentedness.
”Now,” Harry said, “I’ll leave you here to get...accustomed to all of this delightful news. Maybe when you can behave, I’ll release you.”
Harry dressed the boy in one of his old T-shirts. It fit him like a dress, the hem hitting him just above his knees. After dressing his rabbit, he took him to his kitchen to see if he could make him something to eat.
The raw desperation in Harry’s voice spurred him on, leaning forward and grabbing his cock. When Harry hissed out a breath through his teeth, Draco parted his lips and gave the head a coquettish lick.
“And I wish our families’ fates had never crossed. Maybe things could have been different for us, but fate is hardly ever
As he scanned the scribbled words on the page, they started to blur, his mind drifting back to Draco.
At that exact moment, Draco’s pup nudged against Arlen’s prodding hand, as if responding to Draco’s thoughts of Harry.
”If only you could see yourself as I do, Draco. Spread open and riding my cock, greedily sucking me in like you can’t get enough.”
As he watched Draco desperately wank himself, he knew his mate was close. His moans were growing louder, his eyes now closed and his mouth open in a look of pure ecstasy.
Harry pasted on a congenial smile. “You flatter me, Auror Thorne. Could you please take me to Narcissa Malfoy’s cell? There’s a few additional questions that Minister Shacklebolt has sent me to ask her. Time is of the utmost importance.”
“Mmm, even werewolf tails?” Harry turned and playfully bared his teeth at Scorpius who giggled in delight and enthusiastically pointed at Harry.
The crescendo of his revenge, the apex that all of his carefully laid plans had been building up to.
Harry nodded slowly. “I know, but ever since I met you and Scorpius, there’s been an undeniable pull, Draco. I want to be with you—I want to be with you
Harry rolled his eyes and sauntered over to him, stopping just in front of the porcelain tub. He reached out and hooked two fingers behind Draco’s wrist, giving it a tug.
“I’ll stay,” he whispered, pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s lips. He then hugged his arms around Harry’s neck, nuzzling his throat and kissing his scent gland.
It was heavily warded, but Harry had the authority and the magic to open it. The memories contained within the cabinet belonged to prisoners of Azkaban, Ministers before Kingsley, and even of witches and wizards long gone from this world.
Arlen nodded, a furrow appearing between his eyebrows. “Yes, that is your baby, Mr. Potter,” he moved his wand to the side and titled his head slightly. He pulled back his wand and flicked it, golden script appearing in the air beside Draco’s stomach, numbers. He pressed his wand back to Draco’s stomach, his shiny jellybean reappearing.  “Strange...”
”The wards on my home don’t allow anything in without my approval, but they also don’t allow anything
Draco knew what Harry wanted, but he didn’t know if he could actually go through with it while conscious. He knew that when his heat would take over, there wouldn’t be much of a choice at that point. He knew he would willingly spread his legs for Harry, eager for him to soothe the ache inside of him that only an Alpha could ease.
Draco attempted to compose himself before replying. Nervously clearing his throat, he straightened to his full height.
"Ron, why do you have a child tied to an exam table under the Ministry?" Harry asked, unable to tear his eyes away from the unconscious boy.
Harry pulled his shirt off over his head and stood up. He crooked his finger at the boy. “Come to Dada. Now.”
Draco knew she was lying. Whenever his mother spoke about his father, it was always prevarication and falsehood.
Harry grabbed his wrist and yanked him from the shower, pulling him up when he stumbled over the lip of the tub.
She waved a hand nonchalantly in the air. “It’s no trouble, I suppose. We were starting to get a little stir-crazy at Grandpa’s, weren’t we, my sweet love?” she cooed to Scorpius. She kissed him on the forehead and Scorpius let out a disgruntled chuff, trying to wriggle away.
Draco was still shirtless and the room was cold. He hugged himself, rubbing at his exposed arms. Harry had probably left him half-naked on purpose, wanting him to feel as vulnerable as possible in his presence.
Harry was across the room and over Draco before he could blink, his long, calloused fingers wrapping around his throat just above his collar, pressing down.
“Don’t you recognize me, baby? You’ve been sleeping with me for the past two weeks. Dada would never hurt you; I promise.”
He could remember bits and pieces of the night before and one particular image stood out clearly in his mind: straddling Harry’s lap and rubbing against him as if he were in heat.
Harry took Ender’s wand and turned it right-side up, the handle no longer facing upward in his shaking fingers.
Before Draco could even open his shirt far enough, Scorpius latched on to Draco’s leaking nipple, making a contended purring sound against his skin.
Without putting anymore thought into the matter, he stuck out his elongated tongue and started to lick behind the rabbit’s ears.
"Did you miss this?" Harry murmured against his throat, lightly kissing the sensitive skin above his collar.
He had been licking the boy unwittingly, content to continue doing so until the boy was covered in Harry’s scent.
The rabbit had let out one of his breathy sighs, nuzzling next to Harry’s bare chest and closing his eyes.
Harry allowed their visits, checking in on them every so often when she did come to visit. He kept his collar hidden from view with collared shirts per Harry's instruction. Draco knew that he wasn’t supposed to talk about their relationship or how Harry
”I don’t know, Ron. After the War, I’m not exactly onboard with keeping a herbivore in my home. Especially as a
Harry nodded, scrubbing a hand down his face. “Just a long night. I slept on the sofa in my office and didn’t get much sleep. Something I can help you with, Jack?”
When Harry released him, he reluctantly lowered his gaze between his legs. Harry’s cock was massive, the thick head sheening with pre-cum.
Draco stopped reading for a moment, blinking rapidly as he realized that he had begun to cry. His tears fell to the parchment, smearing some of Hermione’s finely written words. He swiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, continuing to read on.
“May I ask why you applied for the AIP, Roland?” Draco pressed. “An alpha with a pedigree like yours, you probably have omegas banging down your door.”
Draco’s breath hitched and he went wild. He raised his hips and tried to slam back against Harry, tearing at the sheets with his fingernails.
Harry scoffed, languidly getting to his feet. “Such things you accuse me of, Narcissa. You should take a look at yourself sometime. Everything that you have wrought, you have done it to yourself. You and
“Please tell me, Draco,” Harry whispered harshly. “I need to hear it. Did you miss me at all these past few months?”
Harry Potter sat in the kitchen of his home at 12 Grimmauld Place. A lit cigarette hung between his lips, the smoke curling into the air above his head.
The boy nodded and whimpered when Harry began massaging the edges of his long ears. He pressed his clawed thumbs into the delicate cartilage, mimicking what the boy had done to
“You don’t know if he’ll be sorted into Slytherin, Dad,” Draco said flatly, crossing his arms over his chest.
The object of the game was to catch the ‘fairies’ in the water container using your wand. The fairies in question were just charmed flashes of light. They would bounce and zigzag throughout the water, quick as a Snitch. If you were able to freeze one using your wand, you won a prize.
Draco set down the potatoes and looked where she pointed, spotting a row of unopened wine bottles on the counter. He went over and picked one up.
Draco stopped struggling, shooting Harry a shocked look. “W-what? Y-you said if I was good, you wouldn’t—
, boy.” Harry folded himself over Draco’s struggling form and sank his teeth into his scent gland on the side of his neck.
to you, Draco?” Harry taunted cruelly, sliding his fingers into his hair and gently tugging at his roots.
Pansy pulled him closer and said in a hushed tone, “I need you to bring something out to the stables for me and give it to the man working there. I’m much too busy today to go myself.”
The result of that fated night had been his pregnancy with Scorpius, but he felt as if he never really made that decision for
Harry felt like a fucking arsehole for turning her down, but it was for the best. He didn’t want to get into a relationship with her again just because it would provide him a convenient distraction. She deserved better than that.
The insinuation was clear in Harry’s tone and Draco’s heart tripped, heat suffusing his cheeks as Harry pressed a quick kiss to his scent gland.
The mating mark on the graceful column of his throat stood out, Harry’s teeth marks silvered against his fair skin. He could remember when he had made that mark, how Draco had begged him to
spit at me again,” he hissed, “I will force open that pretty mouth and shove my cock in. I’ll make you choke on it and when I come, I’ll force you to swallow
“Want to get you pregnant again,” he whispered roughly. “Fill you up with my seed again, until you’re swollen with another one of my pups. I want it so bad, Draco.”
Draco sighed, turning over the envelope in his trembling hand. “I don’t know if I’ll see you again, Sirius. I wanted to come and tell you that I’m sorry. I’m sorry for whatever was done to you and I want you to know I would give my own life to undo it.”
She opened the door and pushed Draco the rest of the way in, closing it behind him with a solid thud.
“Okay,” Draco said softly, tightening his fingers around the material of his jumper to hide their trembling.
Draco shivered when Harry guided one of his trembling hands between his thighs. Harry’s hand engulfed the boy’s small, slender fingers.
Harry stood and ran a hand through his hair. “Kreacher, go put scent and sound blocking spells around the boy’s room.
“He looks so much like you, Harry. He even has your eyes,” Hermione said, holding Scorpius close to her. “I love when they’re this young. So cuddly.”
Harry didn’t speak and Draco knew he was leaving it up to him to tell his mother. Even though he knew Harry would do anything for him, he also knew that there were some things in life that he would need to be brave enough to do on his own.
He would tell Narcissa about everything he had made Draco suffer through, and then to really lay the killing blow, he would show her pictures of her grandchild. He would delight in telling the wretch how he was the father and
Some splattered against Draco’s cheek, making him groan and breaking him from his desirous thoughts.
Draco pulled Scorpius flush against his chest, glancing down. His pup was still softly suckling, his blond lashes lowered over his round cheeks. One of his chubby hands was gripping the front of Draco’s shirt, his fingers slowly loosening as he dozed off.
There was an awkward beat of silence before Ender scooped his wand up and straightened, facing Harry.
. He was a naturally shy person and revealing so much of his body to a strange person made him flush.
His best friend and co-worker at St. Mungo’s Hospital, Pansy Parkinson, sat at his kitchen table giving him a speculative look. Her raven hair was neatly plaited, her dark eyes narrowed. She had stopped by to check up on him and had been doing it more and more the past few months.
Harry scoffed. “If we’re going to discuss what you should have done, Draco, we’ll start with how you
He had been miserable without Harry these past few months and he was tired of trying to act like their separation didn’t bother him.
. No one could ever hate you and if they did, I wouldn’t want them in my life. You and Scorpius will always be a part of my life and if someone can’t accept that, I wouldn’t accept
His own memories assailed him like serrated teeth, catching on the unraveling seams of his mind and tearing them asunder with unrepentant brutality.
“All right,” Jack said and paused. “Cute pup, that baby. I think that kid loves that baby more than the world itself. Must be hard to be a single mother that young and to have a father as infamous as Lucius Malfoy. Probably feels like it’s him against the world some days.”
After some vacillation, Harry decided to give a bath with his tongue. It probably wasn’t the best idea due to his inherent nature and predilection for the scent of the rabbit’s fear, but he
The boy’s pert nipples were pale pink, just like when he was in his rabbit form. He was thin, his hipbones poking slightly out, as if begging for Harry’s tongue to trace the enticing edges.
“You won’t have much time.” Harry took Narcissa’s hand within his own, pressing his wand into her quaking palm. He forced her fingers closed around it and stepped back.
When they had returned home, Harry had made them both lunches, but had noticed Draco’s waning mood. The boy had been slouched over his plate of veggies, a flush coloring his cheeks and nose. His blond fringe had appeared damp with sweat, his ears drooping around his shoulders.
Arlen smiled at Harry like nothing was amiss. “Your pup is quite active, Mr. Potter. You’ll have your work cut out for you.”
Draco’s mother, Narcissa, stood on the other side of their kitchen island, her blue eyes narrowed with concern.
you want me?” he scoffed, dropping his hand and straightened. “I loved you and you spurned me. You withheld the truth from me about Scorpius and lied to my face each time we were together.”
Octavius had allowed him to take home a small cage and food. He set the cage up inside of his bedroom on his large writing desk.
He was trying to keep it together for the sake of his daughter and his pregnancy, but it was becoming more difficult with each passing day.  The last thing he wanted to do was admit defeat and move back in with his
He would enjoy this unimpeded moment, for when the boy came back to his senses, he would hate Harry again.
, he had decided to wear them. He felt entirely too vulnerable being naked. He even slept in his new clothes, fearing that Harry would come back to his bed at night while he was unaware.
Harry placed his hand over Hermione’s in between them on the sofa. “You’ve been good your entire life, ‘Mione. Ron can attest to that.”
In the mornings it would feel as if tiny lightning bolts were zapping the underside of his chest, his milk let-down even more uncomfortable since beginning to wean.
Harry dug the short nail of his index finger into the arm of his chair, twisting it until it dented the wood, forming a crescent-shaped laceration.
Because soon, there might be someone even more vulnerable than himself relying on him to protect them from Harry Potter.
Draco planned to politely decline the Ministry’s security services and be on his way. He didn’t need a babysitter and he had too much on his plate right now to worry about someone constantly following him around.
It would be purely clinical, the only purpose being to sufficiently rid the rabbit’s fur of any dirt and tame his disheveled fur.
Narcissa and Lucius both turned, Scorpius letting out a delighted shriek when he laid eyes on Draco.
Harry laid on his bed, watching the boy. He smiled at the boy’s obvious innocence. In his rabbit form, his sweetheart had loved to hop around his room for hours on end, content to keep going until Harry scooped him up for bath time.
Harry could give him that, if he gave him a chance. He’d give him as many pups as he wished, he’d take care of them, provide for them, he’d—
Even though he was thirty-six years old, Harry couldn’t help the slow smile that curled his lips brought upon by pure joy.
Her heels clicked softly against the tiled floors as she swept in. A floating tray holding three cups of hot tea followed behind her, gingerly being set down with his mother’s use of a levitation charm on the antique coffee table in front of them.
He would do anything for any children he was able to grow inside of him. His Omega nature would make him immediately love it and want to protect it.
Harry stood there, feeling the overwhelming need to gather the trembling boy into his arms. “You don’t sound ridiculous at all, Draco. Would you like me to station some of my Aurors at the manor? I can have them there within the next hour if that would alleviate some of your fear.”
Harry reached down, burrowing his fingers into Draco’s hair, gripping tight. He knelt, putting himself at eye-level with Draco.
”I-It hurts,” he whined softly, his hole feeling painfully stretched beyond what he was capable. Even though his slick was easing the penetration, he wanted his
gland on his throat. “Just cutting me out my son’s life without even giving me a chance?” he murmured.
Draco held his breath and slowly lowered his head towards Harry’s, making sure his lips were sealed shut.
The look in Harry’s eyes was enough to make his tears finally fall. They slid down his cheeks in warm rivulets, dripping to Scorpius’ small cheek as he sleepily nursed.
“He is my business. Let him go, or I’ll tell Mr. Potter you were touching his Omega without permission.”
The baby could sense their Alpha parent’s own unique blend of magic and pheromones from inside the womb and if they were separated, the pregnancy would almost always end in miscarriage or still-birth.
He wasn’t as good at prevarication as his mother, and he didn’t have a poker face like his father, and he
His own best friend, Hermione Granger, was an an Omega witch. His other best friend, Ron Weasley, was an Alpha wizard. They had gotten married after graduating from Hogwarts and had tried for years to conceive.
“Sit. Stay,” Harry commanded, pressing Draco down by his shoulders into once of the vacant chairs in front of the table.
Harry slid his hand back up, his long, rough fingers gliding smoothy due to his wet skin. He cupped one of his aching breasts, letting his thumb press against his nipple.
Omega. Draco would never be his. He’d made that abundantly clear the other night when he’d tried sneaking out of their room without so much as a
Sadness overtook him as he studied the clock. It had been a wedding gift from his father for Theo and him. It was enchanted, the face showing moving photographs of their wedding day.
Draco wasn’t talking anymore, just emitting tiny needful moans and high-pitched mewls that went straight to Harry’s cock.
Harry clenched his jaw, a determined look in his green eyes. “I just want to help, Draco. I can’t if you’re not honest with me—”
Harry shook away the inane direction of his thoughts, his eyes returning to the Prophet in his hands.
He sighed, shifting Scorpius on his lap. His son continued to whimper and nuzzle at his chest and Draco’s breath hitched, his swollen chest reacting to his pup’s needy cries.
Draco chewed in silence for a moment before blurting, “How do you know my parents? You mentioned my parents when you were…” Draco blushed hotly, thinking of Harry’s fingers between his thighs, “
After everything they had been through and everything Draco had put Harry through, he was unsure if his Alpha still
“Mhmm.” Draco pulled Scorpius against his chest, a small gasp escaping him when he felt their bond suddenly open and flood him with Harry’s emotions.
Draco laid Scorpius in his small bed, pulling his favorite fleece blanket up to his shoulders. Scorpius huffed sleepily and put his thumb in his mouth, his tiny blond brows furrowing in his sleep.
“Draco, you don’t have to,” he whispered, placing his large hand on his thigh under the table and softly squeezing.
Harry slammed his finger into Draco, curling it slightly while never stopping the suction of his mouth.
If St Mungo’s continued to do what the Ministry wanted, the generous funding for the hospital wouldn’t cease. The funding came from some of the most elite people working at the Ministry.
“No,” Draco croaked, tears pricking his eyes. “But…what if…Scorpius hadn’t of been yours? What then?”
For a carnivore to commit sexual acts with an herbivore was forbidden. Taboo. Not only that, if a carnivore and herbivore were to procreate, it would surely end in demise.
The boy struggled fruitlessly against him, the tips of his long ears brushing against the underside of Harry’s jaw.
An enticing smell led him to his kitchen, where he found his girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, in the midst of cooking some elaborate dinner.
He stormed out of the bedroom, taking the stairs two at a time. He didn’t care if he was half-naked, all he felt was…
She worried her lower lip between her teeth in an uncharacteristic show of unease before saying, “We have to tell your father.”
It was utterly indecent for a man of his age and Draco was becoming achingly aware that his own white shirt was damp from the rain, the outline of his hard nipples visible beneath the thin fabric.
“Time is of the essence, Draco. I understand how you’re feeling, I really do, but you’ll need an Alpha’s presence during your pregnancy if you want to remain healthy.”
The boy’s scut teased the head of Harry’s cock, adding a torturous sensation that had him gripping the sides of the tub.
me that night and then hid the birth of my son from me. Do you think I should forgive you for that, Draco? Do you know what kind of
Harry leaned over the boy and flicked out his tongue, pressing it against one of the boy’s hardened nubs. His sweetheart mewled, undulating under his tongue. After leaving both of the boy’s nipples coated in his saliva, he moved up to his long ears. He cleaned each one with long laps of his tongue, the fur soft beneath rough tongue.
Draco didn’t seem to give a fuck and neither did Harry. Everything was suddenly narrowed down to Harry’s cock pistoning in and out of Draco at a fevered pace that had him harshly panting and Draco emitting sharp, stuttered moans that seemed to echo throughout his office.
Harry let out a deep snarl, pushing the boy aside and sweeping an arm across the top of his dresser. All the items on top of it clattered to the floor, some framed pictures’ glass cracking upon impact.
Kreacher always made sure he ate at least three meals a day, becoming stubborn if he refused to snack in between.
Draco wanted to ask who Voldemort was, but there was one thing he wanted to ask about above all else.
Harry lowered his hand and pressed it to the side of Draco’s stomach. Draco let out a relieved gasp when their pup immediately kicked in response.
He watched in horror as Potter pulled off one of his riding gloves with his teeth and then brought it down to press it to Draco’s mouth.
Even though Narcissa appeared older, she looked completely unscathed. It seemed as if her time on the run hadn’t been too strenuous. Her full lips were pulled into a impatient scowl, her perfectly groomed brows regally slanted over her blue eyes.
Harry floated the stack of unreviewed case file notes over his desk, letting them drop directly in front of him.  He tugged one from the middle and opened it in front of him, losing himself in the hastily scribbled notes by one his Aurors.
His mother’s greeting made Draco tense and quickly pull away from Harry. He even scooted over, making sure their thighs weren’t touching.
Harry looked at his friend, guilt gnawing at him for being so emotionally and mentally vacant the past few months.
Draco begging for the life of his mother, begging for the safety of their pup, begging for Harry to see things as they really
Harry stepped forward, his larger body crowding him further into the stall. “Let’s talk about that, hm? I thought I told you to hold off on choosing a substitute alpha.”
Harry’s eyes were narrowed, a muscle ticking in his jaw. Draco noticed his fingers were like a vise around the doorknob. Skilled with concealing his inner monster, Harry’s face was quickly wiped of all emotion. He smiled, but Draco knew it was practiced.
Draco warily eyed the envelope, dread settling low in his stomach. “I-I just wanted to tell my mother that I don’t blame her for what’s happened. I wanted to tell her that I love her.”
The little bunny burrowed into the crook of his elbow, hiding his face from view. He was still rapidly panting, the scent of fear emanating from him in heady waves.
Draco laughed, a lightness filling him that eased his anxiety. “I wouldn’t want to interrupt daddy time.”
and he was suddenly overcome with the irrational urge to grab the man by the face and stare into his eyes. He wanted to drown in those green depths and forget the suffocating grey that that seemed to plague the moors and the manor.
He had become worried over the last month. His baby hadn’t been moving as much as they should have been this far along, but he had been in denial about it.
Draco suddenly came, his cum shooting up between them and coating his small, bouncing tits in splatters of pearly white.
Draco closed his mouth, his teeth snapping together with an audible click. He took a step closer to Harry, his stomach brushing against Harry’s again, a ridiculous flutter in his chest accompanying the contact.
The evening was unfolding nicely, and Harry’s friends seemed smitten with Scorpius. He could tell his pup was getting tired by the way he kept popping his thumb in in his mouth and by how his lids were lowered to half-mast over his green eyes.
Just yesterday, he had been pulling back the sheets on his bed, appreciating how soft the material felt beneath his hand. Like a bolt, a hazy image of Harry slowly thrusting into his limp body from behind while Draco fisted the sheets tightly had played in his mind.
Auror Thorne gave a quick nod. “Sure thing, Mr. Potter. Just tap on the door three times with your wand and I’ll come to let you out.”
Draco shook his head, but pressed into Potter’s touch, arching his hips. The finger against his hole stilled.
Harry reached down and loosened his restraints, pulling him up by one of his aching wrists. He tugged him close, and Draco was suddenly pressed against the man’s broad chest. He was much shorter than Harry, the top of his head only reaching the man’s collarbones.
,” the person murmured, nuzzling against one of Draco’s long ears. “Pity I couldn’t have snatched you up first. An Omega rabbit is rare to come by and you look so
Draco let out a sharp cry before spraying his cum into the back of Harry’s throat, his back arching off the table with the force of his orgasm.
Scorpius could obviously sense the tension and was becoming discontented with the increasing octaves of Narcissa’s voice.
The sound of his door slamming open made him pull his fingers from his hole and hastily turn to his side, pulling the covers over his head.
The following silence seemed deafening to Draco, his aching heart beating a staccato rhythm against his rib cage.
Draco wasn’t one to mete out revenge and he had no desire to dredge up the past. He wanted to move on with his life and he had been, but there was something that he was ignoring.
He dropped to his hands and knees before the boy’s spread thighs, laving Draco’s pink hole with his eager tongue.
Harry’s deliberate cruelty made his heart clench, hatred seething deep within him for the terrible man.
The sodding house-elf had allowed him to take a shower the day before, supervising his every move. When he’d been brought back to his room, he’d been denied clothes.
“Well,” Draco said, struggling to sit up halfway on the bed. His growing belly was beginning to stunt his movements more and more as time went on. “Can you tell me a bit about what they used to write about Harry? I’m only sixteen and my mother was pregnant with me during the war. I don’t really know much about what caused it.”
The only warning Draco had was the overpowering presence of Harry’s pheromones attacking him from all angles, loosening his limbs and making his prick leak even more pre-cum before he heard the hated man’s voice.
“He’ll talk when he’s ready to talk, Ron. I’m not going to scare the poor thing any more than he already has been.”
“I’m not sure. I just don’t feel safe at the manor now. At least, not until I know for sure they’re not coming back. The wards are back up, but I guess I’m just being paranoid.”
