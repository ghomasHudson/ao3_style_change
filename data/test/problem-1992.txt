With Harry’s constant support and with Dr. Dirwin’s help he soon felt a lot better and didn’t have as much trouble with eating as before.
“Let’s plan a ball!” Elizabeth said. They were working together on the Prefects’ patrol schedule in the Head Students’ office and had just finished organizing everything.
Immediately the chilly stare of Lucius’ icy blue eyes bored into him, sending a shiver down his spine.
“When one has seriously wished themselves dead for a long period of time...” the healer said.
“Oh wow, really helpful, Blaise” Pansy snorted as she continued on comforting her best friend, combing her fingers through his blond locks.
The rest of the ride was mainly Harry’s friends interrogating Draco and Draco doing his best to answer as honestly as possible.
“So, where were we?” he said as he pointed to their homework.
“I was thinking that maybe... you and I could... you know...”  he said.
For the remaining time of the meal they talked together and got to know one another unaware of the important conversation that was going on at the Gryffindor Table.
“I have a pet myself you know” she said.
“He’s moved on” he whispered.
“I mean... I think I like men but I also think I like girls...” Draco added.
“An apology. For waking you up in that manner earlier” Harry said as he placed a plate in front of himself and started eating. He really seemed to enjoy this food.
“Hermione and I will have to worry about looking our best” Lavender said.
“Uhm... I’m not sure Lavender. I think you really shouldn’t-” Draco said just as her hand closed on the wand.
The first thing he did was try to find Draco.
“It’s a surprise!” Harry said.
Harry was on the other couch as he continuously shifted his attention from his book to the very much attractive blond.
“We have got to do something about this, Ron” Hermione said as she furrowed her eyebrows.
“No! I was drunk and-”
“Draco... please...?”
————————————————————————————
Unfortunately nothing lasted for eternity and soon it was time for Harry to return to Hogwarts.
“Yes, Sir” a few people chorused while others nodded.
“Nice to meet you Kate, I’m Draco” he said as he continued to eat as well.
“A nice walk by the lake. Is that okay?”
Hugging him, she tried to reassure him.
As they apparated outside the grounds of Malfoy Manor, he quickly looked around and found he was standing alone in front of the back of the house.
James looked at his wife.
“No, but it was because of me that you were almost drowned and suffered through a serious head injury...” Cedric muttered.
He felt the world spin around him as he collapsed into nothingness.
He couldn’t go on reading because he was interrupted by someone knocking on the door again.
“He’s waking up!” someone said from beside him.
“I’ve been thinking about this a lot actually”
“I returned about two days ago. I finally finished with my charity project in the States! I absolutely had to see you, anyway, congratulations on your potion!” she said.
Going to work and actually helping people brings me more happiness than you ever could.
Draco laughed. He loved her sassy humor.
“Better?” he said as he patted her hand, not noticing the crimson blush spreading on her cheeks.
She stayed there in shock until finally she carried herself to her room to think about her ‘conversation with Draco’.
“So we can both be warm...” she said and smiled at him. He smiled back.
“W-Why is it-t always m-me” he sobbed and James sighed and simply patted his son’s back.
Harry tried to lighten up the mood.
“What’s wrong with green?” Draco asked.
“I hope so, Sir” he said and watched as the champions took their places in front of the Maze.
Draco didn’t say anything. He simply rested his head on Harry’s shoulder as the brunette’s arms circled around him and engulfed him in a hug.
That’s all we have on this subject, as Mr. Malfoy wasn’t available for any comments.
“Sure...” he mumbled.
“But it’s not normal! He’s not normal!” Ron said without thinking. Immediately Draco’s eyes turned sad as he looked to the ground. Hermione swatted Ron in the shoulder.
His black hair was a mess, as always, but Draco found he actually liked it better that way.
“Where’s Snoodle?” Draco suddenly asked after a few minutes.
As he bottled it up he carefully labeled it:
When he stopped crying, James left him so he could take his medicine in peace. He laid back in bed: his potions soon did their job and helped him fall asleep as easily as possible.
Impatiently he picked her up from the sofa with strength he didn’t even know he possessed and pressed her against the wall, her legs coming to wrap around his waist, grinding into him, while he pinned her arms over her head with one of his hands.
Harry’s head whipped towards her so quickly that surely he got some whiplash. His spirits lifting instantly.
“What?”
Draco smiled to himself.
He swam in the kelp forest for about 150 feet (45 m) when he saw a clearing.
“Not really. I eat when I feel like I can, which is at dinner” he answered.
“You were so lucky to have him and you couldn’t accept the fact that he loved waking up in the morning and going to work more than staying at home with you, doing absolutely nothing and being criticized!
“Draco?” Lily asked him gently.
“Right now I could kill the person who decided to basically kidnap you and place you underwater...” Kate muttered as she wrapped her arms around Draco and leaned in to rest her head between the crook of his neck and his chest.
‘Harry was the dominant one in their relationship... what about Astoria?’
“Please, bring your friend with you, he’s quite welcome” Professor Dumbledore chuckled and nodded towards Snoodle, who was slowly hopping around on the table and sniffing at Draco’s book.
“Unfortunately my son was tied up under water without so much as being given a choice. I know Draco and he wouldn’t have agreed to participate in such a dangerous task” James said.
They were both gasping for breath.
Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest at Harry’s confession. He was confused.
————————————————————————————
A beeping noise sounded from Draco’s wand; the blond turned it off with a quick flick.
He stood there and waited for his foster parents to do what they needed to do.
Harry had started bringing him gifts and praising him for everything he did, which frankly Draco found a bit suspicious.
Draco simply looked into Harry’s eyes, and found only sincerity and-and lovingness.
“Why? You don’t owe me anything!” he said, not believing what his ears had just heard.
He sat nervously in front of Healer Kum’s desk.
“Well, he’s beaten the odds: he’s a good child in spite of everything he’s been through. I take it you’ve been looking out for him?” Professor Dumbledore asked.
“Then why the hell don’t you eat!? This is serious, Draco” Kate said.
“Yeah, I totally have no idea who to take” Ron said.
“ALL STUDENTS PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR DORMITORIES. CURFEW IN FIVE MINUTES” a magical voice said, interrupting Draco.
“I never believed it” she whispered and Draco turned to meet her gaze. Kate involuntarily shivered as a cold gush of wind passed around her.
“Actually, why don’t we go flying?”
Lily immediately understood who he was referring to and pointed him towards his room.
“It’s not true... what she says...” he said after a minute spent in comfortable silence.
“I promise I won’t get mad if you tell me what you did. I promise I’ll give you a chance to explain yourself” Draco compromised.
One month later...
What initially was a slow pace turned into frantic lovemaking, as both of them moaned and groaned.
In the end James bought Draco the same model of broom Harry had, a grey and blue Quidditch uniform, Quidditch gloves and a broomstick servicing kit.
Evidently he must have failed since Draco looked at him warily.
Harry also had been very proud of him, saying how he was so brave and could have been one of the best Gryffindors. Harry promised Draco he would make sure Nott stayed away from him in the future, but Draco managed to convince him not to; call him stupid but the Ravenclaw had a hunch Nott would think twice before insulting him so openly again.
“Potter, quick! Step aside!” Madam Pomfrey said as rushed over to the two unconscious students.
Harry frowned a bit.
“There is a Ravenclaw boy outside asking for you, Harry” the Fat Lady informed him.
She did seem pretty tired so he simply opted for letting her rest.
Eight wands later Mr. Ollivander was repairing the vase again and Draco was starting to get worried: he stood there nervously as James placed a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“Draco, please, listen to me! I don’t like her at all, in fact, I detest her! She’s just a cruel bitch who’s playing both me and you and trying to tear us apart! Please, you have got to believe me!” Harry said.
“And when
“Because apparently we have trouble doing it for ourselves,” Harry admits, voice thick. He swallows hard and looks away, then adjusts his position, curling his blanket more tightly around him and copying Draco’s pose for something to do in the silence. He relaxes back into his pillows and stretches his legs out across from Draco, the side of one foot brushing Draco’s knee. Draco twitches.
“A-another time, maybe.” Malfoy’s voice was breathless. He reached out, slipped his finger into the waistband of Harry’s jeans, crooked it, and tugged. “But this time, audience participation is preferred,” he said, and Harry let himself be pulled.
Harry opens his eyes, suddenly back in his bedroom and wide awake to find Malfoy’s face only an inch away — hovering over his. They gaze at each other, and
Pansy huffed. “Honestly, what rubbish. They had nothing to charge me for. I didn’t even hex you with my wand, and believe me, the Carrows that year had taught us some—” She blanched, mulishness disappearing like a flash. Her throat worked and then, more quietly, she said, “—some awful spells that year. I could have used one, but I didn’t.”
Harry blinked. He hadn’t realised he’d shut his eyes. “Yeah?”
“Pity,” comes Draco’s slow drawl, “I never took you for someone who would fall asleep after the first round.”
Harry took an uneven breath and brushed a light touch over the handlebars, warm from the sun. “You’ve been riding it. You took it with you?”
“Potter,” he murmured, huskily, in a way that sounded like
And Draco bloody Malfoy walked out.
“It’s just black coffee,” Harry said. He paused. “I like my partners to be amenable on their own.”
“You told—” Malfoy cut himself off, shook his head. “It is. Most witches and wizards — the ones raised in wizarding homes, that is — grow up learning somewhat comparable spells, and there are potions and such like Calming draughts that can have a similar effect, but a really good revitalisation is… harder to come by.” He quirked a pale, languid brow. “Interested?”
“Stop it.”
” Hermione breathes the word out, then collects Rose to hold her close. She smells like baby powder, like the shampoo that comes out of the plastic dragon’s mouth in a puff of multi-coloured foam. Kissing the loose, curling tendrils of hair around Rose’s face, she says, “No. No, my love. You’re not a bother. I wish I could— do so many things. I’ll see… I’ll see if I’m able to find a way to let you talk to Harry another time,” she murmurs, aching even as she promises herself that it’s not a lie. She can see; she can do that much. Framing Rose’s face in her hands, she finds a genuine smile from somewhere within, and Rose returns it tentatively, then more easily. There’s so very much of Ron in her. Hermione takes a deep breath and kisses her forehead. “I’m sorry if I hurt you by making you think you could
They weren’t all bad. Muggles all, to ward a bit against the storm of the press, most of the people he went out with were nice, actually; healthy combinations of funny and kind, or smart and gorgeous, and in a particular case, a man named Caleb turned out to be all four of those things; essentially, everything Harry was looking for. But none of them moved Harry half so much as the sight of his paper birds, when he drew them from his trunk every night.
Malfoy swallowed, his gaze darting away. It was oddly, immensely reassuring, for no reason Harry could figure out. “Not all people in our position — do that every time. It can be other ways. I mean, I don’t want it to be any way, mind you,” he said quickly, “only, the contract will know when… we don’t.” Malfoy cleared his throat. “But I think proximity matters more, or at least as much—”
“There’s an exception to that statement?” she asks with a peal of laughter, sweet and throaty. “But… ‘I didn’t mean to, Pansy,’” she mocks, coming closer, “‘but it was you or me, Pansy,’” and Draco wants her to just
At half one in the morning on the third night Teddy sleeps over, the weight in Harry’s lungs tips from
It’s the moment Harry is supposed put his mouth to Draco’s ear and say that he’s tired. The moment for him to wave off Draco’s protest and accept a distracted kiss on the cheek before making his way through the crush to the cool night air alone.
“You could suck it first,” I suggested snidely, mostly to keep from begging him to do
over the summer, detailing Potter’s home life, and if any of it was true, it might not be the best subject to question him about if Draco had any hopes to keep things civil. “That’s what you meant, then,” he decided on saying. Innocuous enough. “About having made the recipe before.”
“No, I wasn’t. And I don’t mind, I want to.” Harry moved from the chair to the edge of the mattress, resolutely ignoring Draco’s sharp inhale, and reached for the jar resting on the bedside table. Unscrewing the lid and dipping his fingers in, he shifted to get comfortable and caught the look on Draco’s face — stiff, suspicious. Harry held up his fingers, coated with sticky ointment. He smiled his most trustworthy smile.
“I can’t—” Harry huffed a laugh, undone by the shade of pink over Draco’s cheeks, by the satisfaction in his eyes. “Can’t believe—” Draco lifted a sleepy eyebrow, but Harry couldn’t go on, suddenly cold despite the fire burning high in the hearth, and Draco’s body beside him. He carefully pulled his fingers from Draco and fell silent.
— her nose wrinkling with distaste as she’d whipped them a few times, dust and grime clouding the air. Neither of them had seen the Inferi come from around the corner, and then it was too late.
“Take off your jacket for a while,” he says. Malfoy’s silvery gaze flicks to him and Harry nods. “It’s fine. The road is clear — if we see something, you’ll have time to put it back on.”
be able to steer yourself around confusing conversations,” Malfoy said. He huffed quietly. “Most of it is bullshitting, and you mastered that at twelve.”
“We can’t stay very long,” Hermione said once they were there, exchanging a worried glance with Ron.
“We have to take what we need when we need it,” he says simply. “Don’t we?”
“Good Merlin—” Draco said before bed that night, lifting his head from his book to blink into the middle-distance. Harry glanced up from his own with a mild sense of curiosity, but grew alert at the look on Draco’s face, stunned enough that he could have said he’d been walloped by an invisible Bludger and Harry might have believed it. He let his feet thump to the floor from where they’d been resting on the edge of Draco’s mattress.
They didn’t fuck, either, though Draco half expected Potter to immediately climb on top of him. More than half-craved it. But Potter only stared at him for several seconds, mouth working silently, before apparently deciding talking wasn’t as important as he thought. Then he strode to Draco and kissed him, and fucking, Draco supposed, got lost in the mix as they found other things to do instead: taking turns thrusting between each other’s tightened thighs, and Potter wanking them both at once in his fist. At one point, Draco was pretty sure he’d come just from going onto his stomach and rutting against Potter’s duvet as he’d sucked Potter off. It was a little hard to be sure what was a memory and what was a dream at that point, between how little sleep he was getting and the way Potter seemed to enjoy turning him into a boneless pile of Slytherin with round after round of snogging.
Except… he was a Slytherin, for fuck’s sake. The direct approach generally came out sounding like a lie from them, for some reason.
Potter’s shoulders sagged and he released a breath. He nodded. “Yeah, exactly. Ancient Runes. Hermione said you’re doing well in that class.”
don’t have long though, because I promised she could… But make sure you pay attention to how Malfoy reacts to whatever she says,
, Hermione starts to say. She can’t quite explain it, how hope is almost worse than bracing herself for the oncoming pain. But Minerva nods as though she understands, and she reaches up to brush Hermione’s hair away from her face, the way a mother would. Hermione stifles a sob; she hasn’t fallen apart yet, and doesn’t plan on letting herself do so now, but it’s so overwhelming she can’t gather her thoughts.
It’s still Harry’s turn, so he thinks to give Draco a minute to collect himself. It’s too soon, maybe, but the whole conversation is overwhelming anyhow, so he says, “You want me. I thought— I thought since the club, or perhaps since we got paired, but I was wrong about that, wasn’t I? Since...” He reaches forward and curls his hand around Draco’s foot. “Since Hogwarts.”
“Potter—”
Distracted — appropriately, in Draco’s estimation — from the answer he was looking for, he opened his eyes. “Been fucked?”
“Watching Muggle-borns get tortured was a way of life for me at that point. If it makes you feel better,” Narcissa says, “I haven’t done it in years.”
“Yes…” Pansy drew it out, the word softly hummed, sibilant. “I forget, what did you get him?”
In a voice he didn’t recognise, Harry rasped, “Yeah. I want to take them off you,” and Draco made a rough sound, his posture softening — a helpless lean into Harry’s body. Tipsy with how much he liked that, Harry said, “Draco.
“And neither were you.”
“Well, it’d be nice to hear it,” Potter said with a quick, sardonic eye-roll. “You never have.”
“That happened twice!”
It’s a rather odd way of pointing out the difference between the spirit of a promise and its technicalities, particularly in this case, and that very thought seems to occur to Granger belatedly, for she flashes Narcissa a brief, professional smile. “And, as you heard, I scheduled another call. Which of course you can take part in as well, under the right circumstances.” She looks at the high window in the corner, barely big enough to fit an owl through. “I might not even make you take a Trustworthy potion beforehand, potion effects being so touch-and-go these days.”
admired
Draco nods and steps back. “Yes, well. I didn't realize you’d moved here.”
Harry lets his hand fall away and stops counting. Smiling, he closes his eyes.
“Oh, god.” Potter’s eyes fluttered, open and shut and back, warm palms coming up to rest on the bare tops of my thighs. He leaned forward to mouth at my bollocks, slurping them noisily into his mouth, one after the other. He ran his tongue over the soft skin of my sac, each lick a tease of intense pleasure, each pull of his mouth skittering electric shocks through my system. I tightened my fist around the base of my prick as Potter released my bollocks with a soft, wet
” Harry tried. “
Refreshed, he got into work early and spent the morning on busywork — clearing his desk between meetings, reassigning low-priority cases to the few junior Aurors they had on staff — and arrived at Robards’ office precisely at two. He let himself in without knocking.
Draco clears his throat. “We should go inside,” he says. “Clean off your hand.” He nods towards the ledge of the building. “I think some of the dormant ones have woken up, too. They’re getting louder.”
“Oh, but the etiquette of you groping my arse for tomorrow’s papers was a chapter I skipped in Miss Toodlesome’s All-in-One Guide to Wizarding Manners?” Harry asked, snorting.
There’s a lengthy pause. “Just— Nothing.”
“Tomorrow,” Hermione murmured. “You simply won’t be able to receive anyone until…”
“Yeah,” he says, brightening. “I could ask him.”
“Is it okay?” Potter asks, quietly. Anxiously. He’s grinning when Draco turns to gape at him, but his eyes are watchful. “I wanted to do something special for… Since…”
Malfoy gestured, a glass of brandy in his hand that he wouldn’t drink. He never drank them, though he poured himself one almost every night after dinner. He didn’t seem to like any of the alcohol in the house but the posh shimmery-pink stuff Kreacher poured for him at dinner, the occasional wine. Harry suspected the drinks he held in the study were because he liked the aesthetic.
Harry swallowed. "I think we've been neglecting our bedroom. Why don't we work in there today?"
“You’re going to make me...” I groaned, back bowing. I wanted to force him to take me deeper, to swallow around me, but couldn’t imagine it feeling any hotter than it did this way, though it was far…
“I can fix this,” Malfoy murmurs.
“Pity,” Malfoy said. “Well, then, what? Was he explaining the mechanics to you?” The tip of his wand touched Harry’s back through his flannel dressing gown. Slid down the dent of his spine. Harry hadn’t known it was possible to tense further but his body did, regardless. Malfoy snickered.
“For Merlin’s sake, Harry, nevermind, I don’t need it immediately if you’re going to—” Draco broke off, colour washing from his face as Harry pulled the wand from the pouch.
Taking a certain amount of license with his interpretation of that, Draco nodded and gave Potter’s cock another few fast tugs before letting go. Then he batted Potter’s too-slow hands away and undid his own belt and flies, because he hadn’t shot in his pants since he was a teenager, and he’d be damned for Azakaban on a murder charge if Potter’s slow clumsiness with something as simple as a belt buckle made him do it as an adult.
Still, Hermione has to know. Whether it might happen, what to tell Hugo and Rose. How best to prepare them all.
“Draco in June, Blaise and Greg in August,” Pansy said. Her lashes swept low. She watched herself trace a pattern onto Draco’s covers. “Mine in May, the eighth to be exact.”
This question is incredibly insulting; who doesn’t have some fears after the last few years? Fortunately, I have very good friends I can talk to about mine… if I ever decide to. And I hate kippers.
(See the end of the chapter for
I don’t know what he’s going to do, only that he’s made the threat to tell them if I haven’t. Which is ridiculous, I can tell everyone. Well. I can tell everyone but you. Still no response to my Owls, still unable to reach you through the Floo, even during your Weasley Sundays, which, the longer this has gone on, the harder it is to pretend this complete silence on your part doesn’t have something to do with at least one of them.

The book Hermione had given him, that had been just supple enough to stay put on his bedside table and hold his glasses safely overnight.
It’s just hard.
Harry
Nearly done. Thank you for giving this a look.
where are yo?
I would consider trying to improve upon Wolfsbane, but really, that’s a conundrum for someone with a great deal more time to devote to the issue. People have spent lifetimes toward that end, many of those before it was even properly successful.
Your name at the beginning of these entries is clearly a formality, a habit. I’m no longer writing to Harry Potter, because Harry Potter is someone with nothing to do with me. Perhaps I’ll name this book Harry. Why the fuck not, no one else will ever know.
At least I’ve managed to get out of accepting and quality checking this month’s shipment of bubotuber puss and flobberworms, for a change.
Hermione’s stolen one of your hair ties, and Molly has stuck with one of our earliest link attempts, a “friendship” bracelet with some of your hair woven in. She actually came here to craft it at your bedside, her collection of embroidery thread and a weaving board in a basket while Pansy selected a few strands of hair from your brush. Because it’s Molly, it’s more of a “friendship cuff” than a bracelet, but it’s quite lovely, if I may say so. She made it in shades of blue and grey, with ripples of palest yellow. Once she’d completed her own, she made a series of quick and dirty bracelets for the rest of the family.
What do you think you’re doing? The Healers wanted at least another week from work, not even wanting you to sit in the office here in London, and off you’ve gone to Morgana knows where no doubt doing things far more strenuous than smacking papers around your desk top
Love you, Scarhead
Harry
Harry remembered that Sunday, remembered how flustered Hermione had been, so far along with Rose while still working full time and trying to help Molly wrangle the family outside and away from underfoot. Harry remembered George and Ginny slamming into him on either side, herding him outside to a family Quidditch match, and telling himself he’d Floo after the game, when things had quieted down a bit, though he was glad Hermione had seen Draco and the man was doing alright.
Theos decided its no longer safe for me to live unattended I cant hold anything properly so I cant brew anymore Stirring rods knives pestles the ingredients themselves I can barely use my wand I have to write so slowly just to keep this legible
He accepted the book and gripped the covers, but hesitated to open it. He knew he should read it, and he didn’t want to be alone when he read about how angry Draco was with his behavior. Draco was one of the most articulate people Harry knew, and would carve into people with surgical precision when upset and on the verge of losing control. Harry didn’t think he was quite prepared for that, but he also knew this wouldn’t get any easier by waiting.
Saw Luna yesterday when I was returning to the laboratory from tea. She’s looking quite well, and told me Charles would be returning from Romania for a visit next month. I expect you’ll be happy to see him again, and a feast or three will be involved. It’s been quite some time since you were able to catch up with him, though he’ll have two families worth of people to satisfy. You’ll likely see her there, of course, and the boys, but as I’ve seen her first, I think that gives me gossiping rights. The boys are fine, and miss Charles a great deal, but they’re accustomed to their father figure flitting ‘round the world, while their mother flits elsewhere with them in tow. They miss Rolf, of course, but they’re young enough not to wallow in angst over his loss, and they’re old enough to see how happy Charles makes their mother.
We laughed over the idea of Vane (your Romilda’s younger brother, actually) being assigned Wolfsbane duty over winter hols, and then panicked just a little bit until we remembered Brookskip was the more likely potioneer to be assigned. She was often in the Wolfsbane schedule prior to my apparently otherwise permanent assignment.
“Just that first one, really. I went to call you once I’d finished.” He tightened his grip on the throw, staring down at the hair on his big toe knuckles. He didn’t want to look her in the eye. He knew what she’d say next.
The taste of your magic is fading, here. It’s fresher on the dirty laundry you and your friend left behind, but even that is faint because you’re not using your magic on the clothing itself so much as on your work robes which all seem to be with you right now – other than your ceremonial Auror robes, that is.
Goyle’s lip stopped quivering, and he looked to Harry’s shirt. His mouth dropped open. “What did you—? What
Draco struggles to breathe in the cut of silence. The misery pulsing through Harry hits him in uneven intervals, and then suddenly consolidates, centred like a blade in his stomach. Draco takes it without comment in hopes that sharing might alleviate some of Harry’s pain, even fully aware it doesn’t work that way; the well of grief never runs dry, no matter how many people drink from it. He prises his gaze from the surface of the desk and, for a single, heart-stopping moment, sees Pansy’s face, white and covered in blood, transposed over Harry’s features. And then Harry is Harry again, inside and apart from himself at the same time, and the walls are groaning a protest, the windows are rattling like they want to shatter from their frames, and the Inferi have begun screaming with hunger. Magic floods Draco, so explosively powerful, it makes what he felt from Harry weeks ago at the lake seem like a wandless child's

Malfoy was holding himself carefully on the sofa, not looking at him. He was already in his pyjamas, that plain blue set Harry hadn’t seen since before the night in the garden, and Harry half-expected him to make an excuse. But the other half of him proved justified; Malfoy got up without comment and followed, silent up each flight of stairs.
Draco turns his head to study him. Potter’s features are unreadable.
“I very often am.”
“I— I’ve got to think.” He scrambled for the doorknob next to his hip, said, “I’ll Owl you,” and then scarpered from the exam room like a guilty man from a crime scene.
“Why?”
Potter frowned and opened his mouth, then shot off the bed as several excited bangs issued from the door.
“No, I heard you, I just…” Pansy looked around. There were only a few other students in the common room, and they were far on the other side at the study corner, but she cast a
“Is that what your problem’s been?” Harry asked. “You thought I—”
Perplexed, Harry said, “
“Sure,” Harry said. His tongue felt thick. “I— Sure.”
There's nothing to do but brazen it out. Ignoring my arse on display, I lift my head with effort and glare at him. "I've heard you wanking, too. But I didn't think that
“Yeah, but did anyone see him do it?” Ron asked, not seeming to expect an answer. They’d been so flustered since walking out of the kitchen — hand in hand, after forty minutes of making sounds that had forced Harry to put up more than one Silencing charm — that neither of them had let him get more than two sentences out at a time. “If it was just a case of an injured owl and Harry’s missing letter to Malfoy, how is that proof?”
“Birthday blowjob?”
He went to Bill, who poured him a drink and discreetly tucked a bloody handkerchief into his pocket, unaware that the remains of his nosebleed were still visible above his upper lip. He led Harry to a chair by the open window. The smell of salt drifted in on the sea breeze. Harry could hear Fleur murmuring to Victoire upstairs.
Occasionally, Harry glanced up to see Draco looking at him, as if puzzled by his presence, and they both looked away; occasionally, Harry glanced up to see Draco had fallen asleep, and kept looking — at the book open on Draco’s lap, at the roll of Draco’s head onto his mound of pillows, at the snowy splay of his hair. Wanting to wake him, to touch him, wanting more than a lonely wank under the spray of the shower. Wanting more from

“If you’re so arse over tit about Draco Malfoy that you won’t even Heal yourself without his permission, how can you claim to be worried about your relationship?”
"He fruck yellow hair in Pole's darden if you div me all Beans."
He drew the knee of his top leg close to his chest as Draco fingered him. Breathed shallowly and let it happen, too turned on to think straight, the world suspended in the boundary between night and day. Then Draco pulled away — incredible, how stripped he felt as Draco watched himself push in, how clean and good and right — and he let Draco fuck him, slowly as promised.
, was it? — but Potter didn’t give him time; he simply parted his lips and took Draco’s cock into his mouth. It was wet and hot, and the suction was just right, and Draco cursed, staring down at the lopsided way Potter’s glasses were shoved up to his hairline, the way his lashes fluttered and his green eyes opened and peered up. Draco tensed, shocks coursing through his body as he came, one of his hands coming up to hold Potter’s nape. And Potter
“Anxiety,” Draco said after a moment, thoughtfully. “Stress. Expectation. And I think…” He mouthed something silently that Harry couldn’t make out and shook his head to himself, examining Harry’s face. Then he stiffened and drew himself up, and said, “Now don’t get carried away.”
“How to take a hint when it’s time to go?”
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Ron? Can you hear me? How long do we have?”
“Whatever you want,” he says. “Here, I’ll tell you whatever you want.”
, because he
“Like eating,” Harry said blankly. His jaw hardened, a rush of embarrassment transfiguring itself into anger. Malfoy’s visits and attire, his
scripted on the side in blue, white, and red, but beyond them he sees movement: A lone woman, shuffling as though injured. Draco takes a step toward her, stopped only by the pressure of Potter’s hand on him.
Ron ambles into the Hall a few minutes later, a satisfied glint in his eye and an overly-casual expression on his face. Hermione bites back a smile at the tiny smirk he shoots her as he bends to check on the children and say goodbye. Hugo waves at him cheerfully but largely ignores him. Rose, of course, pouts. Ron pets her hair and whispers something in her ear that makes her perk up — probably a promise of treats when he returns from London in the morning. Hermione’s shiver of pleasure grows into something fierce and proud, all-encompassing, watching them. Ron straightens and lifts an eyebrow at her, a more subtle version of the
Harry gives him a swift kiss. “I thought I’d make us breakfast,” he says, and releases Draco to head to the kitchen. Over his shoulder, he adds, “And then I thought to fuck you over the island. We should do
Harry straightens and crosses his arms, a bit defensive. “You said I’d be no good to you if I was dead. But even if something happens to me, now you’ll at least be able to… Wait.” His posture loosens; his face grows thoughtful. “This isn’t about you being worried I won’t protect you, or that I’ll intentionally sacrifice myself,” he says. “Service?” And then, his eyes widening: “Fuck,
Harry nods, rubbing a hand over his face, spots of light dancing behind his eyelids when he presses his fingertips to them. Depending on what time that was, Andromeda would have heard any warnings issued; she allows Teddy to listen to fairytale programmes each night before bed. “What about the Ministry? Are there people working on… On how to
“So that’s a no?”
“I can’t,” Draco said, the words gusting humid over Harry’s skin.

Malfoy presses his cheek to Harry’s shoulder with a small nod, and Harry closes his eyes and sends a blank prayer for survival in what he hopes is Hermione and Ron’s direction. He searches inside himself for any sliver of magic he’s still got and pushes off from the ground. The broom rises and instantly dips, the twigs of its tail smacking into the ground, but then he feels a hazy curl of magic slip inside him to fuse with his own. It’s startlingly intimate, like lying in bed and memorising someone’s sleepy smile, the smell of sex still heavy in the room. Harry’s not prepared for it; he hears himself make a tiny noise.
No, I—” Harry gulped, his adam's apple bobbing. It would be so easy for Draco to slide his sword across the man’s throat, to watch his blood run red across the throne room, for speaking out of turn, for treason, or perhaps, just because Draco felt like it. Harry closed his eyes. “I don’t want… anything..”
and there’s a hint—something—

He nodded. “Draco.”

Their swords came up against each other, and they slid forward. Draco could feel Harry’s breath, hot and ragged, his body trembling through their swords. It sent fire coursing through Draco’s cold veins, a nearly palpable desire.
taking a sip of red wine
Wake up.
“It be a sin to mar a face as beautiful as my own,” Draco simpered, and the crown that Harry had been toying with clattered to the floor, his face turning pink. As Harry kneeled awkwardly to pick up the crown, Draco moved forward, placing his sword under Harry’s chin, using the flat edge of the blade to tilt up his face. “And you are so beautiful; it would be a shame not to.”
Their swords screamed across each other, the first clang of metal as they connected. Draco felt the thrill of it ring through his arms and ears as he danced backward, but Harry was already lunging towards him again.  He parried with the flat edge of his sword and spun out of the way, leaving Harry stumbling forward.
I experiment, I imbue my own meaning
She began to lean back, sunlit rainbows skittering across the floor after her, pieces shifting back into place. “Continue your journey.” The light began to fade from her eyes—that telltale sign of consciousnesses—and she went back to being nothing more than stained glass.
“I love it when you fight us,” Draco whispered.
you’re talking to a waiter

Step back, open wide.
She hummed. “Only if you’re a convoluted man.”
Harry wrapped one hand around his cock, pulling at himself with sporadic jerks, panting and groaning as Draco continued his brutal pace.
In a small, circular frame, the crown of one of the stained glass installations, a woman gazed down at him. He didn’t know who she was, although he wasn’t that informed on the Anglican faith in any case. The Malfoys didn’t follow faith, or hope, or religion, they followed money, and power, and bloodlines. They followed magic, because magic meant success, magic meant safety. They really were such bloody Slytherins.
Five sentences or less, but it’s a back and forth, for the first time in ages.
Harry shook his head vaguely, holding the journal more tightly. “Except for letting you read it.”
“He looked like he hadn’t been getting enough sleep. Like he hadn’t been… Harry, he must’ve been so worried about you.” She lowered herself to sit beside him and rested a warm hand on his forearm. “No one informed him of your hospitalization the previous month. Harry, something’s very wrong. This isn’t normal. Isn’t he your emergency contact?”
I hope you’re ready for it, curse you.
Malaysia was hot. Everywhere was hot. Some of it was hot and dry. Amazing, the difference in temperature once we leave our wondrous island nation. One nice thing, travelling internationally: I end my days with fewer bruises and am highly unlikely to have needed to clean spit from my clothing. People, strangers, smile at me. People look me in the eye. Well, besides Healer Flint and a few choice medi-wix and (obviously) my childhood friends.
Love you, please hurry home
I should be sleeping, at this point. It’s been a long day. Your friends have been amazing champions for your cause.

She nodded to herself. “It was a silver one, wasn’t it?” she asked as she moved to see for herself. When she returned from the kitchen she wore a triumphant smile. “I wonder if whatever this is was responsible for him clearing out virtually everything else that might’ve brought back your link to one another. Unconsciously, the same way it altered our behavior. Ooooh, you would think after all these years I’d stop being surprised at what magic can do,” she said, eyes narrowing as she focused on the middle distance. “It seems so fantastical, and at the same time so cold.  Someone had to conceive of the result and figure out how to bend reality to their will. This is the sort of thing that makes me dislike magic.”
I would ask if there’s been something I’ve done to upset you, but that seems highly unlikely as I’d need to be able to interact with you some way other than notes left on the breakfast table in order to do so.
Harry
“Draco?” he called, getting to his feet, a sense of dread forming in the center of his chest.
Harry
Harry
You haven’t been back, but someone else made a pass through for you. I can tell, you know, when it’s you and when it isn’t. I’m not sure who it was, though the magic was somewhat familiar. I honestly don’t pay attention to the details of the magic of people I’m not particularly close to, so it could be any of your friends or co-workers. Whoever it is, it wasn’t you.
Love you, come home soon you daft Savior
Tomorrow, Blaise visits, with the promise that he’s found an absolutely amazing Peruvian place he’d like to introduce me to.

) through … well, to be honest, I’m not actually certain where. They’ve promised there are potions ingredients there, in their natural habitat, and I’m allowed to collect what I like during our outing. They’ll feed me and we’ll catch up together, and I’ll whinge about missing you, and they’ll remind me that you love me despite being forgetful and oblivious.
Should I be pleased that you think this home enough that you’re content to leave your laundry to me? That you haven’t simply cleared your belongings from the property and vanished?
Something felt off, though. The place felt more vacant than it ought. The smell was a bit off, like no one had used the kitchen for a little bit too long. Like no one had opened the front door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry
Not like I can complain, I was away and you weren’t. I’ve picked up the mess you managed to leave about the place for you, and left you my own note in return. At least we’re communicating at the table.
I tried out a couple of different ways to follow up Draco's final (?) entry, and this was the one that I wound up preferring. There's more to it, obviously, and I wound up having to pick and choose what Harry elected to include in his first entry into the journal.
“I’m sorry, it’s late, I know—”

He closed his eyes—surprised to sink into the aura of the church warm, everything still and quiet—he’d walked in, not sure what to expect, to find the building empty. No minister, no sermons… Just a row of candles at the door, and a box of matches, an offering for those still living that they might honour their dearly departed.
or perhaps you’d just never tried
Harry complied, kneeling on the throne, gripping the backrest for support, his toned back and arse on full display.
“You’re delectable,” Draco moaned, pulling his fingers nearly all the way out, then slowly pushing them back in, pushing past the resistance. Harry gripped the armrests of the throne, whimpering. “Alright?” He asked, and Harry nodded, eyes screwed shut.
It’s your heart.

“Should I see to your wound, your highness?” an advisor asked.
“What are the magic words?” Draco smirked, feeling for the magic at his core, golden and holy.
“Really?” Draco asked, voice low. He brought a fingertip to the edge of the sword. Harry followed with wide eyes as Draco ran the pad of one finger down the sharp blade, deep red blood swelling at the cut. Draco watched with detached amusement as a single red drop fell to the floor, and then he met Harry’s gaze, licking the blood from his finger. An angry blush crept across Harry’s cheeks.
“It hurts,” Harry whimpered. “Fuck Draco, it hurts so much.”
press play. watch him move.
“I have told you; I want revenge, I want my honour,” Harry panted.
“I’m not attracted to you,” Harry spat, positioning the tip of his sword unnervingly close to Draco’s pale throat. He saw nervous shuffles out of the corner of his eye, which only bolstered his enjoyment of the entire situation.
“Lovely,” Draco murmured, squeezing one of Harry’s arse cheeks. He knelt in front of the throne and pulled Harry’s cheeks apart. Harry gasped as Draco leaned forward, swiping his tongue around the whorl of Harry’s arsehole, gently teasing him. It sent desire rushing straight to Draco’s cock, to have his face buried in a man’s arse in the royal throne room, a man who was significantly below Draco’s status.
“You like the pain, don’t you?” Draco whispered, his voice running cool and low down the length of his sword. “You want me to hurt you, Sir Potter, and then you want me to heal you.”
Harry arched into Draco’s touch, spine curving, his cock hardening as the pain flooded from his body, mistaking it for the highest form of pleasure. The sounds that were coming out of Harry in bursts were so dirty that Draco couldn’t hold himself back; he grabbed Harry’s legs and pulled out until the tip of his cock was just kissing Harry’s arse… and then snapped forward, pounding in and out of Harry’s arse with fervour.

“Now that we are alone, we may talk like men,” Draco said. “I’m sorry you are so embarrassed to have slept with me.”
“You’re welcome.”

cough.
Harry’s breath went ragged, blush travelling across his ears and down his neck. His sword clattered at his side, and he didn’t bother to pick it back up. Draco knew he had him almost precisely where he wanted him, and he knew this was never really about revenge. His eyes glinted with the same sparkling venom as his sword, and he tilted it slightly, letting the sharp edge trace the curve under Harry’s chin, the point swivelling ever so slightly closer to cutting Harry’s throat. It was never really about revenge; it was about wanting more.

Draco bent at the waist, forcing them to lock eyes lest the sword pierce Harry further.
Harry looked edible, sitting on the throne, beautiful legs wide, cock resting against his chest. Draco wanted all of him. He stepped in between Harry’s legs, pushing two fingers into Harry’s mouth. Harry sucked them in, eager to please. Draco pushed them farther, feeling the back of Harry’s throat, sliding farther down. Draco held back a groan as Harry swiped his tongue between Draco’s fingers, and Draco pulled his hand away with a wet pop, spit dribbling down Harry’s chin. Draco ran his fingers down Harry’s chest, a streak of wet, skirting around Harry’s cock and coming to rest them at his hole.

Draco didn’t need further convincing; he tilted Harry’s face towards him and slotted their lips together. It was perfect—a glorious pleasure before the inevitable pain—it reminded Draco of nights hidden in the shadows of the tavern, hood drawn up over his face, watching Harry step into the low light, the sharp edge of his jaw, the draw of his rugged aura.

“He was here?”
The quiet rain that had begun when Draco had entered now began to pick up, battering the copper roof, forcing every Saint and Saviour to weep.
Draco walked out of the church, not bothering to cast an
Draco stood panting for a moment and then pulled out his cock, waving a hand and cleaning himself up. He left the blood and cum on Harry’s chest, running a finger through it and bringing it to Harry’s mouth.
“He’s gone,” Draco ground out, clenching his teeth. It would do no good to swear at a Saint. “He’s just gone.”
“Take off the rest,” Draco commanded, vanishing his own pants. He stood, sword in hand, wearing nothing but his white shirt, which was untied at the collar, his blond hair now tousled from their duel. With Harry leaning against the throne, naked, his cock jutting forward out of a bush of dark, wiry hair, the head flushed, a bead of precum already welling at the tip.

“Is this what you wanted?” Draco hissed, “for us to be dancing about like horrid ghosts?”
Draco raised a hand to his face, and it came away blotted with red. He brought his hand to his mouth, licking slowly around his fingers, savouring the lingering taste of iron and salt.
“Hello,”
open mouth. close.
“Yes, and I imagine you the same.”

He lit one more candle, and watched the flame dance, reaching upwards with its fellows. One more flame for the man he thought of every night, scarred forehead and round glasses, strong arms and the scent of sandalwood. For the feeling of remembering, each morning when he woke, every word both said and unsaid, sun streaming in through the motel window as he blinked blearily at the ceiling, and wished he could do it all again.
A servant handed Draco his sword, and everyone slowly left the room, his attendant giving one last pointed look as he shut the doors.
Draco sighed. “If it will make you leave.”
and, I’ve said it before, love, it’s your intent.

Draco pulled out his fingers and conjured some lube. This time, Harry’s arse accepted his two fingers easily, and he crooked them, beginning to drive in and out in earnest.

Draco pulled out his fingers, his desire overflowing, he quickly lined up his cock and slathered it with more lube. He danced the tip of his dagger over Harry’s chest, and then as he pressed the end of his cock into Harry’s arse, cut in a downwards motion, deeper this time, blood pooling on Harry’s torso, dripping down his sides.

there’s a level of prediction, where do I rest, and where do I hold?”
The prince shook his head, grey eyes narrowing. The doors to the throne room flew open, and a man stormed in. His red and gold robes switched behind him, and he looked dangerous with his wild black hair, daring green eyes, and the scar shaped like a lightning bolt running jagged down his face, standing out starkly against his brown skin. The moment he saw the prince, he drew his longsword, courage and loathing mixed on his face, lips pulled into a half-smile, almost a grimace, but not quite.
“Yes...” Harry said as he looked around in hopes of finding Draco’s blond head.
Cedric pursed his lips while Kate sighed and closed her eyes.
Good. He hated seeing animals in pain, especially adorable baby bunnies.
“You make it sound like you don’t study with them” Lily said.
He wanted to answer but couldn’t. He felt heavy and exhausted.
All he wanted was for the pain to go away.
“You never cease to amuse me, Malfoy” Nott said cruelly as he opened Draco’s satchel and turned it over, spilling all of its contents on the floor. Draco winced when he heard his inkwell shatter and cover everything in black ink.
“Sure thing, but let him rest a bit, honey. He needs it”
“Sorry Elizabeth. I’ll se you later alright?” Draco said, happy to get a moment alone with Harry for the first time in weeks.
—————————————————————————————
Draco woke up four days after he had been admitted.
“Harry, honey, Draco is going through a very draining process right now. Do you remember what Draco’s parents did?” Lily asked as she sat down on the sofa next to her son.
Draco tensed as he heard the voice that had haunted him for all of his life.
“Good”
“Draco, are you in pain? We can walk as slowly as you need to, sweetie. You can tell me” she said as she quickly took his hand to steady him when she noticed he was wavering a bit.
I won’t live my life by your rules, Harry, and if you can’t understand and accept that then that’s your problem.
‘Come on, Draco! You can’t give up!’ he thought as he focused all of his magic on his friend.
They bought Snoodle a mint green cage to put in his room so he could always be with him.
He would come up with something better, in the meantime he could keep this bunny company until it found its mum.
Hermione in fact had already been approached by Viktor Krum but between her unhappy best friend and some boy she would without hesitation choose Harry.
He stayed at St. Mungo’s for the night as Healers monitored his health conditions.
“The Durmstrang champion is: Viktor Krum” Dumbledore said as the Durmstrang students clapped and cheered.
“Thank you. You’re really sweet” she said and this time it was his turn to blush.
He shook his head, his head going slightly dizzy.
Draco sighed.
“Look, just hear him out okay?” Michael said as he set Harry’s letter on Draco’s bed and left their dorm.
An insistent knocking on the front door interrupted their morning sex, which wasn’t great.
“Oh, hi guys!” he said excitedly, looking like he couldn’t stop smiling.
“We won” he cried out to no one “We won, Love, we won” he sobbed over and over again.
Harry smiled sheepishly.
“Because. She wasn’t right for you” he said as he took Draco’s hand again.
“Draco needs to take his medicine and this little fella needs to eat” she whispered as she entered and placed the potions and pills on the nightstand.
“Once you get comfortable with holding hands, we can move on to what you like in men” Harry said, changing the subject.
Draco and her had agreed to have coffee together to catch up after the medical conference;  soon coffee turned into lunch or dinner.
He hugged his son.
“Enough of this. Someone knocked out our son with a blow to the head, gave him a concussion and basically drowned him. I think we’ve got some work to do” James smirked and grinned at his wife, placing a kiss on her cheek. Lily smiled slyly as the pair made their way to the Headmaster’s office.
Soon they both reached their climaxes.
Harry stayed by Draco’s side night and day, holding his hand, whispering in his ear sweet nothings. All of this, of course, when bloody Kate wasn’t there with him, doing the same exact things.
Draco nodded but didn’t say anything. He was grateful Harry hadn’t pushed him for an explanation. He really was a good friend. His first friend, in fact; well, except for Snoodle.
“Could you at least inform him I would like to explain myself? Here, I wrote this letter. If you could... maybe... make sure he reads it?” Harry asked as he gave the letter to the other boy.
Draco pinpointed this to the fact the two of them had been spending an awful lot of time together, not only talking about Draco’s sexuality but also hanging out and having fun.
“You don’t...?” James urged him on.
The image of his bloodied friend being carried in a stretcher, holding his wand tightly even if he was unconscious burned through his mind.
“Harry didn’t tell you anything about me-us?” she corrected herself.
Meanwhile Lily and James
“I understand. But, if you need a friend or even a shoulder to cry on, then my door is always open, no matter the time. You can come to me and we’ll watch some corny comedy movie with some chocolate gelato” she said. He chuckled, instantly feeling better.
“She’s right, Mate. And if you want to get Draco back, then I suggest you start by changing your attitude towards him a bit” Ron said.
When Lily and James told him he could keep Snoodle (he had decided to call him a fun name because he was a very lively and friendly animal who liked to hop around everywhere) he was so happy.
“Leave it be” Lily said. She liked the name and was happy her son was creative.
He fumbled slightly with his hands as the woman in front of him checked his medical records and files.
“Tha-ank y-you, Ma-a’m. How-How long ha-have I been-n he-re?” he was shaking so she tried to place a comforting hand on his shoulder but instead he backed farther away from her against the headboard and gathered his knees to his chest.
“Over what?” he was genuinely confused.
“Then you should have just told him so, instead of pressing him constantly.
“What?”
The potion is the result of a five year study on this specific disease and I can proudly say it is 100% effective. I have ran hundreds of tests on different affected subjects, taking note of how their bodies responded to the treatment.
As he re-read the letter and sent it he couldn’t help but feel hopeful.
The three boys were laughing together while the girls walked behind them.
Slowly Harry leaned in, pressing a gentle kiss to Draco’s soft lips.
Harry made sure he didn’t make any noise at all, knowing how Draco barely managed any rest lately.
“You’ve been staring at that page for ten minutes” Harry said as he pointed to the book that lay abandoned in Draco’s lap.
“Hello” he said.
“You’re right. Thank you for helping me, I really don’t know what I would do without you, Draco. I’ll let you get back to your date now. I’ll see you tomorrow okay?” Cedric said with a wink as the two parted.
Lily sighed.
“What have I done?” Harry said as a few tears escaped his eyes.
“S-Sure?” he said and he still wouldn’t meet her eyes with his own. He was very shy.
He couldn’t stop thinking about this not-so-little problem and he was going mad.
Draco had been lost (he couldn’t remember which corridors he had to follow to go back to the main wing of the castle) when Cedric found him and helped him get back to Ravenclaw Tower.
As she stomped away Harry and Draco shared a knowing smile as they went in the empty Gryffindor boys’ dormitory.
Since he had received no patronuses, he assumed his fellow aurors had not found anything of interest either. As he walked down a corridor, he opened a door that was locked using a simple ‘Alohomora’ and went down some sets of stairs.
As he walked away from the pile of ash that had once been Voldemort, he was approached by countless people, who were congratulating him, thanking him for what he had done.
Since he was feeling a bit blue after visiting the pet shop, James decided to treat him to ice-cream.
Harry, not wanting to think about Draco’s eating disorder (which had fallen as a secondary problem in light of his coma), slowly made his way up the stairs to Draco’s room.
“Hey, shhh. It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. You’re safe here” Lily said as she tried to calm down the panicking boy.
“Do you ever feel the pressure that you should eat more?” she asked.
It’s been a while and I just wanted to see how you were doing.
“I absolutely agree, although I wouldn’t worry too much. Granger doesn’t seem like the type to go blabbing to the press”
Draco’d missed Harry’s birthday, he realized.
, isn’t that what we always say?).
Harry had missed Draco. And he’s not sure how things had gotten so hectic that he’d first managed to spend a week away from home without leaving the country. But it had happened once, and then it had happened again, and then he’d been out on assignments and then he’d been in Mungo’s and he’d thought he’d at least see Draco there during one of his visits but he never did, somehow.
…Harry had missed Draco’s birthday, first.
Harry
How had he missed so much?
The bedroom was dark, empty, and cold. The bed had been made, and everything visible was neat and in its place. His nightstand was untouched, still slightly cluttered but he’d eventually convinced Draco to stop organizing it for him because he preferred it the way he’d left it, and the other man had respected Harry’s need for complete control over it.
It was a perfect sphere of space, he saw, peering around himself. Colors ebbed and flowed around him, but the silken grey speckled with yellow and burgundy almost created a shell, except that he had the impression the shell was the invisible barrier keeping that particular color away from him. Reds, blues, yellows, all the colors in between. Colors that moved like water, like sand, like growing and withering plants, like a breeze over fields, pulses like sound frequencies made visible. Harry reached out a hand as though to touch the speckled grey, and felt a stab of anger when he realized the color danced away from his fingertips.
When it became clear that he had no idea what to say, Hermione gave his arm a light squeeze. “He works at St. Mungo’s, we should have a word with some of his co-workers.  Someone will know what’s been happening.”
with you? I’ve just got home from your Muggle grocer, at your request I’ll remind you, to pick up your favorite biscuits and office tea sachets after my own long day at work, expecting to find my recovering partner lounging on our loveseat while allowing what few brain cells he has to dribble out his ears while he zones out to the tell-E, and instead I’ve found a virtually illegible note informing me you’ve been called away for an overseas operation with no end date offered.
Theo gave me a week to inform everyone. After that, he’s
I shouldn’t think badly of you, I know that. I shouldn’t think badly of your friends, either. They’ve supported you longer than I have, certainly. They got you through a war.
Harry thought he ought to remember, with as many times as Draco had fire called over to Blaise before things had got… weird. “I don’t… I can’t remember.” His brows drew together in bafflement, and he stared at Hermione, almost hoping she might have a technique to stir his memory.
It seems more likely that I can create a superior analgesic salve for the elderly witch with arthritis in Spell Damage, or a Cinnamon variant of Pepper Up, or something to dull someone’s sensitivity to the ambient magic in the air.
I’ve been chosen to travel to Malaysia next month, after how well my presentation was received last autumn, as well as the Congo the following month. In between they want me to stop in Lebanon and Egypt and Milan. I’ll be gone three consecutive weeks. I’ll leave notes. I don’t know whether you’ll be home again before I go, but I expect I wouldn’t be here to catch you even if you were.
Pansy and Blaise shared a knowing look as they watched the two.
“Thanks, Harry. For everything” he said. He didn’t remove his hand.
It didn’t help much.
Fortunately her dress came off in one piece, leaving her in sexy red lingerie.
Here he was, at the age of sixteen, fangirling over a boy.
The two joined Lily for dinner, which was already waiting for them on the table.
As they thanked him the healer made Draco promise he would tell his parents should he ever experience symptoms of exhaustion and lethargy. Draco promised.
He ignored it in favor of the pleasure he was feeling as he came inside the man.
Twenty minutes until Draco arrived.
“I need you to wake up, Draco. Please. I can’t — I can’t live in a world where you’re....” Harry whispered as he took Draco’s hand in his. He wasn’t sure Draco would be able to hear him while he slept, but he talked anyway. He had to tell Draco eventually about his feelings.
Harry, after Draco had explained many times how Sev hadn’t been able to help him, agreed it wasn’t his fault and decided he would accept his relation to Draco.
“Hey! Why did that girl sit right beside Draco!?” he said and watched as Draco and the girl started talking.
He chucked the newspaper in the fireplace, not wanting to see anymore.
“Where did you go to school before, Draco?” Harry asked him and Draco almost choked on his steamed carrot.
“I’m afraid I can’t let you in without the password, my dear boy” she said.
Draco gave her a blank look.
“You really don’t have to call me ‘Sir’, Draco. ‘James’, or even ‘Dad’ if you want, is fine”
“No, mum helped me” Harry said.
Hermione, Ron and the others all gasped at this revelation. All except for Harry.
Harry and him had bought themselves a penthouse in London so they could both be close to work. Draco’s family company had been doing very well so far under his lead while Harry had started Auror training only a few weeks ago.
Harry looked at him innocently.
He had absolutely no idea how this had happened.
James looked at him with questioning eyes.
I also won’t pretend that your sexual encounter with that man didn’t hurt, especially only a week after we’d broken up, but if you swear that you didn’t plan it to purposefully hurt me, then I believe you.
“Pleasure to meet you, Sir. I’m-”
Draco raised his head to look at her.
“Champions, today you’ll be facing the perils and obstacles of the Maze. In the center of it there is a cup, touch it and glory will be yours, but be careful: the Maze is insidious and you might just lose yourself” Dumbledore said.
So he ran.
“‘Professor’ will do, Mr. Malfoy. I am Minerva McGonagall and I teach Transfiguration here at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I am also Gryffindor’s Head of House. Please, follow me” she said as she hurriedly went up some sets of stairs.
“They part students into categories: Gryffindors are brave and chivalrous, Slytherins are cunning and ambitious, Ravenclaws are witty and clever and finally Hufflepuffs are kind and generous” Harry said as he looked at Draco closely.
“Looks like we’ve found your match, Mr. Malfoy” Mr. Ollivander smiled at him.
“Has that happened often?”
“Believe me, he likes you far more, especially when you’re not being an insufferable and immature child. Try not to ruin it, alright? Or else...” she trailed off, her eyes speaking for her.
Nott stopped laughing and looked at him as if he was mad. When he didn’t answer, Draco continued.
“I’ve always had a soft spot for rabbits and hares, you know, and I happen to think your friend here is quite adorable” Professor Dumbledore said as Draco magically packed up his things and followed the teacher through some corridors.
He would have preferred to make her come just like that but he too had grown pretty impatient.
Draco sighed softly and settled against his pillow.
Draco smiled for the first time in a while. It felt nice to have friends who actually cared about your well-being. As he bit into the fruit he became aware of his hunger and realized he was famished.
“I like the idea of being a Healer, of helping people. But I also like Potions a lot and my family company... what do I do Severus?” Draco cried in frustration.
Draco was very busy in the two months following the Yule Ball: with studying, spending time with Kate (and Snoodle who had caught a bit of a cold) and helping Cedric with research he barely had any free time.
The boy’s parents had confessed under Veritaserum and were awaiting trial.
“Have you guys seen Draco anywhere?”
“You should be very proud of this one” Madam Pomfrey said as she waved her wand and the two limp bodies were lifted into some floating stretchers.
“I think so” he said.
“If I were you I would kill myself, Malfoy. It would make me much happier!” Nott provoked him again.
“All alone? Isn’t your faggot boyfriend with you?” Nott snickered. Draco raised an eyebrow. He saw with the corner of his eyes Harry stand up in anger and Ron pull him back down to sit. He was grateful to the red-head: he didn’t need Harry to cause even more of a scene.
Draco holds his eyes for a long moment before his gaze drops back to his coffee. “What did you find?”
, and
,” Pansy said. Draco sat up, mouth tightening.
“But why did you
“Were they up over my waist while you were fucking me, or was I just wearing them?” Potter asked. Draco inhaled sharply. He put a hand on Potter’s wrist.
Harry blinks. “Well, I’m—”
He sits up, pushing it out of his mind. “It’s nothing; I was just thinking about my father.”
“Maybe that’s the problem.”
“I wanted to meet with you
Harry put his hands in his pockets for something to do rather than start rambling — and the urge to was strong. It occurred to him with an uncomfortable jolt that he’d missed seeing Draco the day before, and not simply for the heat that he’d come to expect would flare between them; Harry’d missed
Potter draws in a sharp breath. A beat passes, and he pushes something into Draco’s hand. “Here.”
Neville was next. In the midst of explaining to Molly that, no, Kreacher had the food well in hand and would be offended if she offered to help, Harry almost missed Bill pulling Charlie away from his conversation with Neville. Neville swept the room, then seemed to brace himself when he saw everyone otherwise engaged, then he drew himself up and marched into the hallway. Harry cut off Molly mid-sentence — “Wait, sorry, wait.” — only to see Draco nod pleasantly to Nev and make room for him their circle. He started making introductions.
* * *
“Can’t sleep? We do have potions for that, you know,” he said. Harry, tired and not-altogether-there, was struck by tone, his phrasing — not
“Yes. Pansy, who saved you,” Potter breathes in his ear, and Draco realises he’s been speaking aloud. Potter’s fingers continue their exploration, but they’re— gentle. Unhurried. Potter says, “You can tell me about her.”
“No, I wouldn’t have.”
Stunned, Draco watches him go for a moment, then picks up both bags and heads in the opposite direction. The woodland is long but narrow, and he can see Potter thumping around on the other side, quick flashes of him between the stand of trees to the constant rustling sound of disturbed vegetation. Draco finds a clear spot near the middle, right beside a wide rock that nears his own height, where the floor is more earth than loose stones. Since they have time, Draco scrapes the area completely bare and gathers fallen leaves to make a pallet for them before opening up the tent. He takes out the blanket and lamp, folds his own jacket down where his head will be, then changes into his remaining set of joggers. He regrets the loss of his other set, worn though they were. Potter might not think anything about sleeping in denim, may find him absurd for clinging to creature comforts, but Draco frankly doesn't care — as long as he has them, he'll use them. He can hear Potter traipsing closer, and sits with his back against the rock to wait.
“Malfoy. Fix the whole bloody place if you want,” Harry said hastily, heart knocking hard. Malfoy assessed him narrowly and finally seemed to relax, the tension in his face easing. Harry locked his knees against their sudden urge to bend, gulping in a bit of oxygen. The atmosphere in the room had changed, somehow, gotten weird. Determined to get back to the matter at hand, Harry shook it off — it was no matter to him what Malfoy did. “So you think the magic in the house could be dangerous.”
“We’ve got hundreds of Inferi crowding around this building, and thousands of them to get through in the morning,” he says, ostensibly to himself. “Don’t throw him off the roof.”
, it’s so like the way she’s seen Ron look at Molly. Anthony opens his eyes.
Harry leaned forward to deposit his untouched dinner onto the coffee table. He ran a hand through his hair and sighed, tipping his head against the back of the sofa. Studying the ceiling, he admitted, “They want someone who’s not going to step on the hem of the Spanish Minister’s daughter, tearing her dress all the way up to her knickers and I’m— I’m a fucking mess.”
“You two were made for each other, you know that, right?” Ron grumbled, and stalked back out.
Harry moves his finger between Draco’s toes, a slow insinuation, even as he works to school his face. What happens if either of them gets something wrong; does the game end, then?
Pansy disappeared down the hallway and left them staring at each other. “Is she always like that?” Potter asked like he had a month prior, and Draco was too stunned to do anything but nod. Potter inhaled. “You, uh, showered with her?”
, anymore?"
“We’re not making a fucking potion, here,” Draco said, sneer fading in the face of Potter’s smirk. Potter’s wand clattered to the floor, rolling to hide under the bench.
“They do,” Harry says, pushing up from the road where he’d been kneeling to search under the driver’s seat. He wipes his brow with the sleeve of his jacket. “They carry them around like they’re sustenance and salvation rolled into one.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Hermione?”
“Hate sex can be a satisfying indulgence,” I choked. I’d heard as much, at least.
“What is?” Harry asked.
“Yeah?” he whispered, and Harry nodded.
“Hate showing anyone that you care what they think, or even that you feel things very deeply,” Harry finishes for him when Draco cuts himself off. “I know. You hate giving them that power.” He hesitates. “Not everyone would use it the way people have before.”
reddened—
Harry kept his face blank as Robards examined him. Without the wand, he had very little and they both knew it. A handful of boastful lies from which he’d wrangled pay raises, an injured owl and stolen bit of Harry’s mail, a curious vendetta against a group that was generally hated in society. But Robards didn’t know what Harry did: that Harry could
“Mostly witches and wizards, though,” Potter murmurs. “We’re such a small community, even globally, that what’s happened here… Well, other countries are going to fare better. Wiping out a section of Europe, where so many of us live, is a hit we weren’t prepared to take. We’ve become… too reliant on magic, the way Muggles are with things like electricity. But electricity doesn’t draw them the way magic does.”
Harry let it go as deserved. “—and I won’t do it again. I shouldn’t have, but we hadn’t… talked. There are some things I want to tell you, actually.”
“Of course,” Draco scoffs, or tries to. It comes out weak. He attempts to heave himself up, but his muscles won’t cooperate and, frustrated, he issues a low growl. But then Potter sighs and grips Draco’s bicep, pulling him up and steadying him when Draco’s knees won’t immediately lock. He escorts Draco to the foot of the bed, hesitates again, and switches sides with him. Draco wants to ask why but can barely do more than lean on Potter as his steps steady, and then he doesn’t need to ask because he knows: Potter was putting himself between Draco and where— and the sofa. Draco swallows and grips the door jam of the loo. “There’s no water.”
“Are you joking?” Pansy repositioned, folding her legs under herself and scooting closer on her knees. She lowered her voice. “I’m just surprised to hear you
“A rock was a good idea. Better to keep a distance if you can.” He folds Draco's fingers closed. Adjusts the placement of Draco’s thumb so it rests over his index and middle fingers. “It’s not broken, but it could have been if you’d caught me any harder,” he says softly. “Keep your thumb on the outside.”
“I just meant! You know what, Potter,
“What now?” Malfoy asks. “How are we going to get out of—?”
Crouched much like a sprinter at the start of a race, Harry hesitates, index finger and thumb pinching the zipper tab. He shifts his weight to his back foot, twists his head to give Draco another searching look, and with his free hand, crooks a finger. Draco edges closer, puts his ear to Harry’s mouth.
His shirt smelled like the oakmoss in his cologne, his jacket faintly smoky with the spice of cloves. And the scent of Firewhiskey underneath, just enough to steady the tremors in his warm, calloused hands as he helped Harry up, his chuckle ringing with the strains of a bark.
, earthy-rich, sweat under his arms, on his bare chest. You know him,
“Good. Good.” Granger exhales. “Just stay with him, he’ll keep you safe. Harry, when I said— What I said last time wasn’t— I shouldn’t have—”
“Harry,” Draco says, jaw hard, eyes glittering with warning. But he undulates into Harry’s fist as if by instinct, and his cock is so pretty poking out of the circle of Harry’s hand, he can barely bring himself to pull away. He finally does, drawing his hand out and tucking the lace back over Draco's cock, petting over the fabric lightly before returning to his task.
“I would have fucked you again,” Harry says, tightening his hold on Draco’s foot in retribution. “And again, when we woke up. And…”
use them,” Harry muttered. He stood and shoved his hands into his pockets. Stalked past Malfoy into the less confining section of the room and took a few deep breaths. “You sound like Hermione.”
“You’re running yourself to the bone.” Malfoy tipped his gaze up to the ceiling and shook his head. “Potter, selfless heroics may sell papers, but they’ll only advance careers to a certain point.”
Ruefully, Harry says, "We’re not going to be able to make it to the tunnels in under a minute. I’m— I should have thought of that; I assumed I’d be able to prepare, logistically, after I got another chance to talk to Hermione and we had more details on how the spell from Hogwarts would help us get through, but…” He shakes his head, and Draco frowns.
he'd told Harry a few months ago over drinks, when Harry lamented the fact that his most recent Beta was moving to the States.
remains Harry’s favourite, out of all of Draco’s drawled responses — the very first.
at me, ‘that compatibility I spoke of is rare, no matter the form it ultimately takes. So were I in your position, Potter, I would perhaps search my feelings for any latent need to explore it, before you board the train.’”
” Draco snapped, and during the beat of silence that followed, Harry took the opportunity to whisper confidingly, “Did you hear that? I’m
“I need—” he says. He’s shaking all over, as hard as Draco did last night, and the tremor somehow must transfer between them, back and forth, because Draco starts shaking again as well, his own prick swelling further as Potter pumps his hips. Potter makes a small, choked sound. “I want—”
“You only left the tie on while I was fucking you.”
that day,” Potter admitted, “but only to—”
, and for one wild moment he wonders if he’s known since he first saw Potter’s face at the hotel — or perhaps even before. It’s reminiscent of the feeling he had when his parents informed him at age four that he’d be attending Hogwarts, that he’d been written into the Book of Admittance at a mere six hours old. It’s overwhelming, and yet somehow… not.
“I’m not asking you to
“For them to leave,” Potter says. But there’s a deeper truth, an unspoken ‘or…’, in the catch to his voice, and it makes Draco grateful that Potter’s weight is propping him up. He rests his hands against Potter’s ribcage, sinking his fingers into the material of Potter’s jacket to steady himself. He takes a breath.
see?” Malfoy shot back. But there was no heat to it, and he turned his back on Harry and slipped his wand from his sleeve, as though he didn’t even care for an answer — or as though he knew Harry would give him one anyway.
“That’s got to be sixty kilometres!”

“Alright.” Harry studied him — missing something, and for once aware of it. “Draco—”
“Thanks!” Goyle nodded, looking momentarily unnerved at Harry’s presence but quickly regaining his enthusiasm as he continued, “The fairy-silk is harvested humanely, don’t worry, but you see that bit of… sparkle?” He hesitated as he gestured to Draco’s tie, like he was unsure that was the right word for it, and looked at Draco for confirmation. Draco nodded, ticking him a measured smile, and Goyle grinned and said, “That’s only found in fairy-silks from tropical environments, and I knew it’d work with the black, ‘cos he’s so pale. He doesn’t usually let me make him things, but since it was his—”
“We’ll count that as your turn,” Draco says, so smoothly Harry quirks him another smile without thinking.
“Trying to make sure I won’t give this place a one-quill review in
“What?” Harry asked.
The Inferi scream at him through the barrier of the glass, thick enough that he’s bought them a little time. A minute, or maybe two, if they’re lucky. They scrabble at the door, howling, some of their faces half-rotted away, and Harry turns to Malfoy to find him staring down at Pansy's sheet-covered body.
“How long has it been since you’ve seen your children?”
At a loose end without the expectation of something to do, Grimmauld Place closed like a tomb around him. The creak of the floorboards under his feet were jarring; the groan of the pipes across the hall when Malfoy showered had him gasping; the rasp of a parchment being unfolded sounded like a scream. He felt gutted, unable to take comfort even in the post he got every day. It was too full of apologies, of pity and guilt and concern. Harry tried to write back that he was fine, but what came out were ugly thoughts he hadn’t known existed until he put quill to parchment, unforgivable as any Dark spell:
With another low whine, Potter angled his prick, pushing the round head of it to Draco’s sphincter, eyes squinching shut. Even his breath sounded pained, his words fumbling as he pushed gently, just massaging Draco’s hole with his prick.  “I don’t— We don’t have any—”
“Go on,” he said, twitching his hips up. His arshole fluttered under Draco’s fingertips and Draco pushed his cock against the inside of Potter’s knee helplessly, as much in a bid for some self-control as for the pressure he wanted. Draco massaged the spot carefully and Potter’s eyes drifted shut, ragged, panting breaths issuing from his mouth. He looked so… So
Draco breathed out, inched his hips away. Removing his hand from Harry’s arm, he stepped to the side and began running the flannel against Harry’s nape. Quiet and conversational over the sound of the spray, he said, “I thought about you, you know, before Granger sent you here. Once or twice.” He made a critical sound when Harry turned to look at him, and Harry faced the wall again. Draco swept the flannel over his shoulders. “Do you know what will happen, if we fuck?”
Harry breathed and sat down, the swirl of the garden filling him with a strange sense of vertigo. It had changed since the last time he'd come outside, had expanded from the proportions it shrank to when Sirius toppled through the Veil. It had returned in full, and looked almost nothing like he remembered.
, thank you,” Draco said icily. That it might have occurred to him a month prior was of no import. “Which one?”
“Now that that’s done,” he said composedly as Harry was still trying to reorient the world around him, “we’ve got some work to do.”
Harry hesitated. Behind him, Malfoy heaved a long-suffering sigh, and when Harry turned, he found him brooding angrily at the floor. Then Malfoy scowled and scrubbed a hand over his face, sighed again as though bracing himself to do something unpleasant, and finally met Harry’s eyes.
their fault, Hermione knows. It’s just the result of additional complications arising that need to be addressed, and more and more of those every day: ward cracks, students accidentally or intentionally using magic, the aging drain on the house-elves, depletions of a resource the Unspeakables declare they need. She never gets a negative reply in answer to this question.
Robards flushed. Stiffly, he said, “I don’t appreciate that, son.”
It takes Harry a second to remember, but when he does, he smiles. Bernard had been lanky and blond, with a fairly angular face; Harry’d dated him close to four years ago, when he and Draco had barely settled into their first year as partners. Harry chuckles and scratches his nose. “It’s only been in the last six months that I’ve started to wonder if my propensity for… a particular type might have had something to do with you.”
