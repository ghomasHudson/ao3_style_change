Confused, she turned to him and had a look down herself. She dressed the exactly same way she usually did in her time off work. The exact same style she had ever since her teenage years.
“Not tonight,” Harry says softly, placing a quick kiss on Draco’s nose. “But soon.”
Harry shakes his head. “It’s the middle of the night, Malfoy. Relax. Sleep for a few more hours and leave in the morning. Or leave if you want to but I’m going to back to bed.”
Harry hides his smile. “I’ll let him know.”
Draco clears his throat, blinks back the wetness. He closes the remaining distance and wraps his arms around Harry. The familiar feel of those arms settling around his waist soothes an unrest in him he wasn’t aware of till it was gone, the sense of peace taking over startling in its presence.
It’s crowded and sweaty, bodies moving all around them, and it’s perfect; Draco feels himself get swept up in the tide, moving along the crowd till he’s right in the centre. Blaise has already thrown off his coat somewhere, his shirt tight enough to make men stare. Draco smirks and takes a look at the men around them before leaning towards Blaise and pointing him towards someone who’s been eyeing Blaise all night.
“Please,” Draco bit back, he was standing away from the door now. “Spending a night or two a week away will not make anyone doubt your abilities and you know that.”
“Harry,” Draco calls out in greeting, eyes soft as he takes in the scene in front of him. “I see you’ve caught the little runaway.”
Harry grinned cheekily as he stole a kiss, swooping in for more till Draco’s glare melted into something a little fonder.
“That’s okay,” Draco says, hugging Teddy tight.
Malfoy arches an eyebrow, “Really?”
For -
Harry waits, his thumb rubbing circles against Malfoy’s palm.
Draco is quiet next to him, their hands occasionally brushing each others as they walk back home. The silence between them is comfortable, each content to just enjoy the company of the other. They pass a group of carolers on the corner, their voices providing a melodious background to the otherwise silent night.
Harry turns on his heel, his eyes on Draco as he walks backwards towards the door.
"Potter." Malfoy sighs.
They didn’t necessarily need him here; Emma seemed more than capable of figuring this out eventually. However, time was of the essence—as they reminded him multiple times—and they were counting on his expertise in the area of hybrid plants and their impact on potion potency to help them expedite the process.
He’s just at the last stage of the spell process, waiting for the previous spell to settle, he raises his wand, the incantation ready on his lips –
At least Malfoy’s reaction had been no different from his.
Harry laughs, the loud, unabashed laughter that he only lets loose in front of a select group of people. Draco pushes himself off the counter and heads towards the stairs, but not before passing by Harry and pressing a kiss to his cheek.
Last chapter tomorrow! ♥
“You forgot to take the potion one day?” Harry asks, his eyes bright, the deep green almost pulling Draco under. He doesn’t look as shell shocked now, making Draco breathe easier.
(See the end of the chapter for
He sighed, getting started on clearing out the easier things. He was only halfway through sorting out the parchments strewn about the window ledge he’d commandeered for his N.E.W.T. studies when Harry finally walked in.
I need to breathe, the air is struggling in my lungs as I look down at where we’re joined. I can see sweat drip down my nose and onto his back as I hang my head over his body, waiting to give him time to adjust.
The fact that it says, “May this season be filled with light!” doesn’t help.
Harry frowns in confusion as Draco carefully takes off his coat instead of answering him, making sure it's back in its customary spot on the back of a chair before he turns back to face the bed. Harry fleetingly wonders if Draco is getting ready to hex him, losing that thought as Draco toes off his shoes and climbs onto the bed.
Now, as they walk back home, Harry can’t stop smiling.
“I like Teddy, too.”
“They’re my favourite,” Teddy offers shyly, staring at the bowl filled with them. “Harry doesn’t let me have lots though.”
The puppy yips happily around his feet, jumping around him as he heads towards the door. It’s an energetic little thing, following Harry around the house, playing with his socks and the little toys he bought for him. Thankfully, though, once Harry falls into bed at night, the puppy follows, curling up near his waist and sleeping with his head on Harry’s chest.
He doesn’t think he’ll ever get tired of the look on Draco’s face each time Harry says those words. Though he could do without the hint of awe lurking behind all the affection, like Draco still can’t believe that Harry would say those words to him.
Instead, now I have the steady breathing of my boyfriend next to me.
Draco and Blaise take up spots next to her. Draco knows Blaise is already scoping out the crowd, looking for his target for the night. Pansy nudges them as the drinks arrive.
One such point of contention was their friends. Draco didn’t have many to start with, and any he was close to had long decided that Hogwarts was no longer the place for them. They were still in contact though; Pansy wrote the most regularly, letters filled with requests for him to visit or to take care of himself if he insisted on staying away.
Draco bites back a gasp of recognition, realising just who the child is. Teddy Lupin, his aunt’s grandchild. Looking at Teddy now he feels deep sorrow settle in him at what the child has lost already. His mother had acted like she was fine when she had been informed of her sister’s passing but Draco knew better.
There's only a handful of photos with Draco in them, the man in question hardly ever trusting anyone else with his prized possession. Harry picks one with just Draco in it, his profile backlit by the sun, giving him an ethereal edge as he quirks his lips in a bashful smile. Harry stares at the photo, enamored.
Too lost in the indignation of being disappointed over Potter leaving while he slept, it took him a minute to spot the scrap of parchment placed over the blanket. A wandless
Malfoy chugs the last of his drink, distractedly swiping his tongue to collect any stray drops from his lip. Harry pointedly doesn't stare at his lips. He plays with his glass, tapping elegant fingers against the rim. "Not today."
Harry grins, aware of just how helpless Draco is when faced with his smiles. Pleading looks don’t work with Draco anymore, his husband has developed an immunity to them which proves very useful each time the twins ask for something unreasonable. But when faced with his family’s smiles, their happy faces directed right at him, Draco melts faster than butter.
“Well,” Ron drawls, rolling his eyes at Harry, “forgive me for thinking that when you say poker you mean the normal cards game of poker.”
Once the dishes have been cleared away, kitchen spotless once again and wine bottles and glasses transferred to the living room, Harry is scared the nerves will come back.
“Now tell me what’s up?”
Instead, he very carefully takes a seat next to Scorpius and looks outside. Teddy and Draco are shaping the snowman’s body and he knows it’s going to take them a while to get it done, and judging by the mulish expression on the face of the tiny blonde sitting next to him he knows that he’s going to get nothing by pushing.
Draco frowned. “So you’ve considered it?”
These past few days have been beyond and above anything he could imagined. He can
He looks so unhappy, the thought of making little Teddy wait for him making him look more anxious than Draco has ever seen him.
He can see Scorpius’ bottom lip trembling and Harry wants to pull him close and never let go, protecting him from everything that could harm him but he knows he needs to wait it out till Scorpius is ready to talk.
Harry presses a soft kiss against Draco’s neck, humming in satisfaction when Draco throws his head back, giving Harry more skin to whisper against.
If Draco had found himself distracted by Harry before, it was nothing compared to how utterly hopeless he felt now. Having Harry in the room was a challenge to his attention span.

He’s overcome with the need to touch Malfoy, reassure him, do
angst has been dealt with.
“Did you know this would happen?”
“Worse!” Harry gasps, peering down his nose at Scorpius, who is busy trying to hide himself under Harry’s coat.
“Harry?”
Harry grimaces. He had only agreed to the books because Hermione had insisted. Malfoy laughs as he ruffles his son’s hair.
We're almost at the end! Just 2 more chapters, wow! If there's anything you'd like to see, feel free to drop it in the comments and I can try to somehow fit those in!
“. . . but, I was wondering, if maybe tonight, we could, umm, go have dinner instead? Together?”
“What are you having?”
Scorpius looks interested at that but quickly looks away before Harry can notice. Harry almost laughs out loud;
Draco blinks, his best friend’s concerned face fills his vision and Draco curses.
“You have
As I reach his thighs I can’t help myself and place small bites while moving up, not hard enough to wake him up but enough to bruise; to mark him. Draco hates that he bruises so easily, gets annoyed when he puts a glamour in place to hide the bites on his arms or the shape of my fingers around his neck.
"It's a date," he smirks, pleased at the sight of the flush that paints Draco's cheeks.

And then there are those drinks that make his head go fuzzy and often lead to cloudy judgements and decisions he wouldn’t take when sober.
yet fitting oak table. The champagne flutes reflect the light from the chandelier, the strings of fairy lights peeking out from between the bowls and silverware lending the table a muted glow. Seated at the centre table, Draco watches as Pansy flirts with an unassuming Neville, his hard-earned confidence a lure she couldn’t resist. Weasley and Hermione are seated at the end, Harry across from them, his right arm comfortably placed around the back of Draco’s chair. Draco’s attention is pulled by the sound of a chair scraping as it slides back, turning in confusion to face Harry.
It felt new, sparkly, the feeling of getting to know someone for the first time because their last time felt like it was a lifetime away. What remained was the comfort of little things, like Harry’s habit of forgetting his tea till it got too cold and then complaining about it, and new surprises, like the fact that Harry preferred the left side of the bed now.
Malfoy says nothing and yet, Harry can't help but feel like he's somehow managed to gain Malfoy's approval.
as awkward boys trying to act like men, they forgo the punches and head straight for each other’s clothes.
As they prep Draco, Harry hugs him fiercely, promising him, “You’ll be okay. We’ve gone through the procedure with the Healer loads of times. Within minutes they’ll get our boys out.”
It’s a good thing that Harry has always been a little stubborn because winning over a five year old is one of the toughest things Harry’s experienced.
“That must have been terrifying,” Harry muses, breaking his silence.
At five, Scorpius has developed his own,
I've never actually had roasted chestnuts but google informed me they taste good. Thank you for reading! ♥
By the time Draco’s on his fifth shot, he’s leaning against the counter, a glass of some cocktail in his hand. The music is hypnotic, he can feel his body swaying along to the beat and Draco lets go. He’s had a long, tiring week and he deserves to let loose now.
“Sorry, I was thinking about something. You were asking something?”
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out in exasperation at the sight of the man in question huddled into his robes, his feeble warming charm providing no relief. Malfoy’s lips have a distinct blue tinge to them and that’s what makes Harry decide that enough is enough. Paying no heed to the weak curses being hurled his way he grabs hold of Malfoy’s arm and pulls him in, shutting and warding the door behind them.
Draco frowns, rubbing a hand up and down Teddy’s back. “Whatever for?”
"S'okay," Harry says, nodding his head very seriously. "Why aren't you drinking?"
Despite his mounting curiosity, Draco made himself look away. He had an assignment to finish. If he was fast enough he could make it to the kitchens before breakfast and grab himself a snack without having to visit the Great Hall.
“Wake up, Potter!”
Scorpius won’t get a chance to go to Hogwarts. He’ll never get a chance to learn about magic or fly a broom.
They elope the next day.
To say he was worried was an understatement.
He managed to shoot Harry a smile when he looked up. To Draco’s surprise Harry looked reassured at that. Like he had been waiting for Draco’s approval.
, murmured against his lips is enough to make Harry choke on a sob and kiss Draco back, too lost in the arms of the man he loves to notice the people cheering around them.
“Even the food tastes better,” Ron agrees, eagerly digging into his pie.
“Hi Harry!”
Draco looks up at Harry in confusion, noticing how the other is also dressed in his pyjamas, messy bed head making him look years younger.
“Ah.”
Like kisses in the morning and whispers against skin at night.
He had never imagined reconnecting with Harry.
“Wh-” Harry tries, clears his throat. “What do you mean?”
Where there's breakfast together and Pansy is awesome.

It's only once he's settled on the bed in front of Harry, cross-legged in his smart grey trousers and that green shirt that he swears he hates but wears at least once a week, that Harry tries again.
For Day#8 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
I'm going to try and keep everything fluffy from the next chapter!
That’s how Harry finds them an hour later, Draco immediately shushing him as soon as he enters. Harry looks on fondly, tucking the blanket tighter around Teddy as he settles down on the floor in front of the couch, giving Draco a detailed account of what happened at the Ministry.
He wakes up one morning to Loki whining outside the bedroom door. The light from the windows is enough to tell him that it’s past daybreak.
“Umm, Potter, it’s been fun, what we’ve been doing…”
Draco nods, relieved, knowing it’s true. Till he suddenly remembers, “What about Teddy?”
Harry’s clever retort is lost in their kiss.
Harry hums. “I know, but I think you are pretty amazing.”
“Sorry,” Harry apologises, trying to keep the boy from falling. “He has a fascination with hair these days. You should see him around Hermione.”
“You’re delusional,” Draco mutters, giving the witch a pointed look as she leans slightly towards them to hear better.

Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
As he slips into bed, Harry hopes that Draco enjoys the day he has planned for them tomorrow.
“Undress and step in, I’ll try to whip up something warm for you,” Harry orders, stepping out to give Malfoy a modicum of privacy.
His otherwise suave exit is somewhat disrupted by him almost tripping over a display case. He manages to right himself at the last minute, the sound of Draco's laugh lingering in the air.
Harry’s coat is off now, his shoulders lined with confetti that casts bright shadows on his face when the light hits just right. Draco takes another drink and manoeuvres the bottle so that he can tug off his coat. Throwing his tie off at the same time, Draco stops where he is. Harry’s got his tie off as well, making Draco lick his lips as the flashing lights highlight his collarbones, making Draco want to bite and leave his mark.
“Of course.”
Draco opens his eyes, blinking against the flashing lights. It takes him but a moment to realise that they have an audience and it leaves him feeling smug. He knows they’re a striking sight, and perhaps had he been more sober Draco would have been scandalised with the fact that he was practically humping, whilst almost half naked, against his boyfriend in the middle of a club.
“You can be a complete prat at times, Potter but I must say, today you’ve shown me that behind all the fumbling, fashion-challenged mess is someone with a brain.”
Bravery is a fool's dream; the
“Huh?”
Draco snorts. “Glad I’m in the ranking somewhere, even if it’s after that wretched bird.”
Harry sighs. “How would that help?”
Harry kisses his neck in apology, pulling Draco back to lean on him as he peeks over his shoulder.
“Here you go,” he huffed, slightly out of breath as he finally helped Potter settle onto the sofa. A quick glance at his watch showed him there were still a few hours left before their first class of the day, eighth-years all taking lessons together.
Draco feels a pang of hurt, whether at himself for not being here to see Harry grow into this version of himself or at Harry for not staying the way Draco left him, he’s not sure.
Where there's fluff.
While Draco tries to get his work done quickly and be out of the Ministry as soon as possible, he can’t help but notice the fact that Harry never stays past five. Like clockwork, he’s out of the office at the same time every evening. It makes Draco curious; the Harry he remembers often stayed back at work till the late evening on the regular.
“Better than them, I’d say.” He nods towards the two cats sitting in front of the Christmas tree, both of them decked up in Christmas costumes.
“Let’s check, if you aren’t stinky then you don’t need to take a bath.”
“That’s why you’re going to school, baby, so that you can learn.”
P.S. - If there's any scene from their life together that you would like to read about,
Maybe it’s because he feels loose and warm in the way that wine and sleep can make him, the blanket nest is cosy and he feels like he can sleep for days, but Harry asks, “Did you not want to come in because it’s a Muggle’s house?”

He’s almost through when Draco calls out to him, making an impulsive decision.

For Day#13 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
She turns to give Harry a look that promises an interrogation in his near future.
“Hey, no.” Harry makes Draco face him, waiting till Draco is looking right at him to say, “It’s not your fault. It’s
“Of course,” Draco says vehemently, his face set, daring Harry to contradict him.
The note is short and apologetic, making Draco sigh in sympathy at the thought of Harry spending another night hunched over his desk.
“I’m saying,” Draco answered clearly, “that you have a lot of priorities, but I haven’t been one of them for a while. Heck, I’m not even asking you to drop everything to see me, but at least act like
“Yeah, there was a department meeting that ran late.” Harry sighs. “Madeline usually attends those but she’s taking time off this week, so I had the pleasure of listening to the head of the Auror Trainee Program complain about budget cuts.”
in no time.
One of the many things that had caught his attention when Draco had first been introduced to their little pub nights about three years ago, was the little camera he carried with him everywhere. Harry had been fascinated, the sight of Draco Malfoy with his little magical camera that shot out tiny pictures almost like Polaroids. Though, of course, that example had been lost on the other boy, Harry had always been curious where all the photos had gone. Even now, Draco would have his trusty camera with him for their weekly dinners and almost all important events. It is part of their routine now, little traditions formed amongst their group of friends. Ron brought the FireWhiskey (often the most adventurous blend he could find), Neville would bring along Mrs. Longbottoms's famous cheesecake and Draco
The time to be careful has passed and I grab onto his waist with one hand to pull him up, back against me as I fuck him, hard and fast. Just the way he likes it. He moans and mumbles in his sleep but I don’t think he’s awake yet, a thought that makes me groan as wave of arousal curls up from my belly and races up my spine. I’m giving it to him now, rolling and thrusting my hips as I feel the smooth walls of his rectum brush against my cock.
Harry wholeheartedly agreed with him.
“I’m not stinky!”
“Draco,” Harry said, looking apologetic. “I’m so sorry. There was a combat practice that ran over and I couldn’t leave even—”
The one solace the Manor offered was the sprawling gardens, acres upon acres of open land that was once the best in the country but was now the perfect representation of what the Malfoy name stood for. Drained and dry, no remainder of the splendour they once held. It gave Draco something to do, the familiarity of digging through soil to carefully nurture something became the bright spot of his days.
Draco wearily climbs up the stairs. It has taken him an hour to clear up the mess in the living room. It feels like the exhaustion has seeped into his bones, making each step a fight. He doesn’t remember feeling this tired ever before and just the thought of having to go through this for another week makes him want to curl up somewhere and just
The day after.
“Harry.”
I watch as each inch disappears inside his body, his pucker stretched around my cock. I trace a finger around the rim, rubbing the skin as I enter him. The stretched skin glistens obscenely around my cock as I push forward the final inch and sink in completely.
Draco laughs, trying to wiggle back as Harry angles for a kiss.
“Okay.”
Harry doesn’t know who leans first and as he bites down on Malfoy’s lower lip, he realises  that he doesn’t care.

Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Draco neatly pins the badge handed to him to the front of his robes.
Malfoy smirks. His eyes never leaving Harry’s face as he nods. “Sure. Harry it is. Is this where I insist that you call me Draco?”
The meeting with Mrs. Pembrook, the Society’s current Chairman, went well, better than Harry had been expecting. Draco had come prepared with questions, each answer making him relax a little further.
"Marry me."
Harry sits at the edge of the sofa, his biscuit tin still in his hands.
A very
“Sure, I guess.”
“Hi,” Harry says, bending down till he’s the same height as Scorpius. “I’m Harry.”
Draco blinks. His hair is longer now, Harry notices. It falls gracefully over his eyes, the wispy ends lifting lightly because of the wind. Harry is struck by his startling grey eyes.
He smiles then, soft and filled with warmth, a stark contrast to the look of despair a few moments ago.
Scorpius, who is busy petting Loki, points towards the rest of the house.
Draco deigns not to reply, which in hindsight is a bad idea as it gives Blaise the motivation to keep going.
idea,” Malfoy says, laughing at the memory. “I had no idea what to do but even through all the confusion I knew one thing for sure, Scorpius was my chance at redemption. He was, and will always be, my second chance.”
He had been there to see her silently weep every night for a week.
yet. It's too soon!  What do I write for the next 16 chapters then? :D
“Shut up.” he lightly shoved Harry and stalked over to the sofa. “Come on, let’s finish that Potions essay you’ve been putting off.”
“So,” he starts, capturing Draco’s gaze, his eyes focussed only on Draco. “You have to take a potion because you can get pregnant and there are Veelas involved?”
“It was hidden right at the back, thought we could use some before we head out in search of everyone else.”
Weekly dates to sleepovers to daily meetings. Draco kept waiting for that sense of familiarity to strike, for that moment of clarity where he would feel, “This is just like last time.” It never came.
“You haven’t given me any reason to feel differently, Harry,” Draco whispered, the fight seeping out of him. “I’m just so tired of being the only one fighting. I can’t do it anymore.”
“To be honest, I had been considering it for a while,” he says, giving Draco his full attention. “Umm.” He pauses then, playing with the strap of his bag. “I almost quit once before, after you left?”
One of the shortest chapters yet, I know, I completely forgot I had scheduled a test for tomorrow. :| Oh, the joys of standardised testing. Thankfully, it's only basic English.
Harry nods. “All done, it took surprisingly less time than I thought it would. Though that might be because I bought the house mostly furnished.”
“Will you play with me if I did?” Scorpius asks, biting his lip nervously.
Draco spends the next hour mingling. He meets Emma’s wife, Tara, a sociable witch who works in the Minister’s office. Bronan is there as well with his wife, a calm primary school teacher who complements his exuberance wonderfully.
Harry stumbles back against the wall outside his room as Malfoy fall onto him, focused on getting his hands on Harry’s hair.
As soon as the lift doors open Draco stalks out, ignoring Blaise. He steps up the line in front of the Apparation Chamber, ready to leave Blaise behind if need be. He’s almost there when Blaise walks up.
He was content with life continuing this way, a new normal where he was left alone and could make sure he followed everything mandated in his sentence while spending the morning in peaceful silence with Potter.
, I should say, decorating the tree was something father, mother and I did together and now, without him, it feels incomplete. For now, just for this, mother and I more comfortable being apart.”
“Fuck buddy then,” Blaise corrects himself, waving his hand in a manner indicating it doesn’t really matter much. The elderly witch next to them in the lift shoots them a pointed glare. “Either way, as you keep deluding yourself into believing that by the way, he would still make sure the higher ups knew how displeased he was.”
“Malfoy.” Ron nods, taking Hermione’s coat from her and hanging it next to his. “How’s it going, mate?” He asks Harry, side stepping Draco to enter the kitchen.
Scorpius trails off, sobs wracking his tiny frame as he hides his face in Harry’s shirt. Harry bites back his own tears of frustration at the world for making his little boy feel so insecure and hugs him tighter,
He straightens with a cough, looking anywhere but at Draco. “I think he smells good.”
As I lick along the curve of his arse, Draco moves. I freeze in place as he mumbles something and curves around the pillow next to him, pulling his leg up further and opening himself further to me.
He pulls the last batch of cookies from the oven, they’re crispy, light golden-brown and smell divine. Harry hopes that Malfoy likes them as much as he does. In an effort to integrate himself into the community and not end up living like a recluse like at Grimmauld Place, throughout the week Harry has made an effort to meet at least one of his neighbours from down the street. He’s met the wonderful couple that live two houses down, old Mr. Perkins who can be found playing with his grandson, the Smiths, a family of five that decorate the house together and invited Harry over for dinner.
“Hmm, most probably not.”
In the end, he only picks the toy broomstick, giggling in excitement as Harry helps him climb on. The broomstick is Charmed to hover a few inches above the ground. Draco had absolutely loved it as a child. Seeing Teddy on it, however, he’s also filled with concern, and though he knows Harry is there to take care of him, Draco tenses each time Teddy so much as wobbles.
He wouldn’t say he was content spending his days like this, finding the least uncomfortable corner of the Manor to research on what he could plant in the gardens. The majority of his days were spent planting what he’d ordered, relying on owl post for those, the sun warming the back of his neck till it hurt. It was a new normal he felt he could

that his attention was grabbed by Harry suddenly exclaiming in surprise.

“What do you think of this?” Ron asks, holding up a card for Harry’s inspection.
Twenty seconds before the Fiendfyre rise its head, ready to devour them, Harry Potter says three words that hold the key to his heart.
Draco smiles, the last thing he hears before losing his battle to sleep is Harry promising, his breath brushing against Draco’s lips, “I love you.”
“Travelling?”
He would have done so in the privacy of his house.
“Eight months after my release and I was living life with no direction. Every month was a new city, I would drink the night away, many times in the arms of men whose faces I couldn’t recall the next day. It was, without a doubt, the lowest I have ever felt in my entire life and yet, I saw no reason to change.”
"What are you thinking of?" Draco asks softly.
Harry stared as Draco continued.
Harry looks up from the lone game of Solitaire he’s playing with a pack of cards he found in the bedroom. Malfoy looks nervous, the sweatshirt and pyjama bottoms that Harry unearthed hanging loose on his lean frame.
Things got a little heavy but Draco's and Scorpius's story needed to come out bit by bit! Also, please ignore the weather I know it's all over the place. *hides*
“’Mione? What’s up?” he asked her. “Isn’t it your day off?”
“With the quill I’ll add this special colour to…” she stopped and it was visibly for everyone to see how her braincells were working. “You’re not allergic to any kind of organic pigments are you? Flowers, petals, leaves?”
“Mr Malfoy, one last thing,” Robards called him back. As Draco looked back at him he asked, “The ring you wear. It’s an engagement ring, isn’t it. Who’s the lucky fella?”
“Sorry,” he muttered, “I’m…”
“You’re right,” Draco mumbled. “Let’s go back.”
Draco freed himself from Harry’s grip and sat face to face with him, “You… would do that?”
Draco carefully handed Rose back to her mother and Hermione carried her over to the living room, placing her in a cradle.
“Yes and the yo-yo,” Harry added. “So?”
“It’s fine, Mrs Andrews,” Draco interrupted her. “I’ve already talked to Teddy. He’s fine. He knows the upper levels of the ministry well.”
Draco was a little irritated but remembered that she had eavesdropped on his and Hermione’s conversation.
“Draco,” muttered Harry and tried to hold his fiancé by putting down a hand on his arm, but Draco just slipped out of his grasp.
“You’re ready?” Harry asked him.
Harry sat down next to the blond and put an arm around him, “So tell me. What is it?”
Before he was able to reply, the question answered itself by calling out, “Draco?”
She ran out after him and on the hallway she asked if they could test it. Draco asked her to go ahead.
“And this is a catalogue about wedding cakes and locations, the notes from my wedding preparations are still in there,” she continued and totally changed the subject. “Also the name from the jewellery store in Diagon Alley from which Harry and I got your ring, and Ron and I got ours. Also, this is a register of all the muggle politicians that are currently in Westminster Palace on a daily basis. So it is possible that one of those is a potential target.”
“Zabini?” Harry wondered. “What are you-”
They still lived in the small house in the London suburb. It still looked the same from outside, but Draco had completely redesigned the inside. The floor in the kitchen, that had been a black-white chequer, had been replaced with an all white marble floor. The fronts of all the cupboards were dark grey now and the worktops were – like the floor – out of white marble.
Draco looked at the beautiful flowers. The big white rose was in full bloom as well as the countless narcissus’ with the puffed up golden centres. The tiger lily’s bright orange and yellow with the hint of red and the black dots were without a doubt an eye-catcher and really made it look like a vivid and positive tattoo.
At half past two Andromeda and Draco apparated to Teddy’s school and picked him up. The boy was happy to see his uncle and grandma. After asking Draco several times if anything he had packed was at Andromeda’s place he went with the old lady and they apparated away. Draco returned home and started to prepare everything for the evening. He put up candles and told Kelly five times not to kick anything down and every time he remembered that the cat was with Teddy. He was so used to Kelly being around him when he was alone at home.
He was interrupted by a hasty knock in the door and a woman that just stormed in, “Commissioner Ackles! Have you found my son yet!?”
The tattooing took about an hour. The quill tickled a little from time to time.
“Draco,” he greeted him. “Wouldn’t have expected
“D-Deatheaters can’t cast the Patronus Charm,” Lucius stuttered.
“Am I this irresistible?” he had asked Josephine.
“You’re looking for this?” asked Lucius smiling. In his hand he waved Draco’s hawthorn wand. “This wand of yours is really good, but not quite fitting for the dark wizard you’re supposed to be. Unicorn hair in the core. I should have seen that when we first bought this wand. You’re a good-for-nothing brat.” He swung his wand with a cutting gesture, shouting, “Sectumsempra!”
Krista immediately became defensive and stepped in front of her husband, “Are you nuts? Apologize right now or you can return home! I do not tolerate you talking like that with a friend of mine!”
He leaned back on the chair until the witch pulled back her wand and turned to the small desk beside her. Curiously, he looked at his arm. The dark mark looked much different now. Probably the most comforting to see was that the snakes head was almost completely gone. Only weak outlines were still to make out.
Draco carried the sorted files to Robards’ office. He knocked and stepped in afterwards. The old man with the grey hair sat behind his desk, writing a letter.
“No,” Draco said clearly. “You wouldn't see Kelly a much longer time if you get kidnapped. Kelly stays with Hermione over the weekend.”
The blond pulled his hand back and let Teddy look at the ring, “It’s an engagement ring.”
“Uhm… I’m free in half an hour. You want me to take Teddy home? He can stay with me until you finish working. I know this is an urgent matter for you from the Auror-Department, sooo… if I can help…”
Draco and Harry were all in on that idea and the witch promised to give the phones to her colleague tomorrow. They could get them back around noon.
“Oh my gosh, thank you, Detective, for finding my daughter,” she said. “And… this terrorist and the bomb threat? Is that really under control?”
“It’s your birthday,” Harry answered. “I’ve organised this just for you.”
“You have a cellphone?” he asked.
Outside the shop he sighed relieved.
“An owl registration?” he asked.
It was too much for Teddy and Kelly so they sneaked away, just to see how Ginny dropped her empty glass and her jaw. The glass broke into a thousand pieces. Teddy noticed Crookshanks walking towards the shards. He ordered Kelly to wait, ran to the other cat and picked it up so it wouldn’t step into a shard. Then he stepped to Ginny and looked up to her startled face.
Recognising her visitors, the woman began to smile even brighter, “Merlin, blow me down! Famous Mr Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. To what do I owe the honour of your visit.”
She put down her papers and sat down across Draco, “A lot of stuff. In this folder is everything the watchers have found about the maniac. This is about the tests of the
The three of them looked closely at the sketches.
“Alright, let’s go. You’re ready?” he asked.
“Well observed,” the blond replied dryly. “Care to come in now?”
Harry placed the band of gold and red on his head the ruby a lovely contrast against his pale face,
He misses the closeness of it. That's why he and Harry are sharing the same air right now. It's why he can't bring himself to pull away from where their heads are bent together, lips grazing over each other, breath mingling.
cross the street on my own, thanks." Draco huffed indignantly before he walked across the street hastily. He jammed his key into the front door upon arrival and practically ripped the door off its hinges at how quickly he threw it open. He made quick work of stepping in, shutting the door, locking it, and toeing off his shoes.
"You know, Draco, that was very stupid of you. Going up to their flat like you did, several times apparently. Not telling anyone." Pansy said absently, not asking for an explanation, but simply stating a fact. Draco looked at her, her eyes still focused on the telly, not bothering to look at him as she spoke. He'd hurt her. He knew he had, she was his best friend and he'd gone to Blaise and hadn't even mentioned the topic to her other than the one time they'd all heard the commotion upstairs.
“Er, ok,” said Harry, shooting Snape an apologetic look. “So. New plan, then. What have we got? And, more importantly, does anyone have any pain potion? That memory charm is doing my head in.”
“I’m not.” Draco spoke too quickly, readying himself to replicate Harry’s jump onto the platform. “I’m waiting for it to get out of my way so I can jump. Why—” he landed heavily. “Why are you quitting the team?”
“Yikes.” Cormac made a face. “He’s snippy,” he told Harry, as if Harry didn’t already know.
“Good.” Chrissy switched her attention to the rest of the group. “Right then, who fancies a shower after all that time lurking in the bogs?”
, that Draco is now certain stretches across Harry’s lower back.
“He’s fine! Bit banged up but your Dad’s a tough one.” Ron interjected. He was standing with his arm around a small, skinny boy with floppy black hair and smudged glasses.
“Harry, mate,” said Fred, darting off the bed. “How about we go for a walk? Hmm? Quick chat outside?”
hovering between them. Something that was hot and staticy and sometimes zapped gently at the back of Draco’s neck. He was fairly sure that Harry felt it too.
“Yeah I know my own name, thanks”, Harry grinned, inching closer to Draco and forcing him to come to a halt. Draco opened his mouth to protest, only to close it again as he took note of the completely unacceptable way in which gold threaded through the dark curls that had fallen across Harry’s face. Deciding that future Draco could blame sleep-deprivation, Draco lifted a hand to move one of the longer curls aside. Harry jerked slightly, eyes darting to Draco’s hand and then almost going cross-eyed as he stared up at his own curls. “What are you doing?”
“What do you mean ‘have to?’” Draco spoke with an exaggerated slowness.
A sharp breath from Draco sent Harry’s eyes darting back to the screen. They watched as the grumpy woman with the turquoise headphones shot Draco an irritated glance as he stumbled past her and slammed his hands down on the table in front of Harry. The screen flickered for a second, almost like it felt the impact.
“He’s fine. Been there since this morning. Wouldn’t move,” said Ron, waving for the Auror on duty to let Scorpius through. “Don’t worry, Gin’s been keeping an eye on him. Albus is here as well.”
“Um? Oh yes, a fascinating topic, one I myself greatly enjoy unpacking.” Draco glared at Harry, his back ramrod straight. “The nuances of ‘um’ truly are—”
“There you go.” Ron helped Draco sit on the ambulance steps, crouching down to take Draco’s pulse. “Hmm, bit high. Nothing to worry about though.”
“You mean a time loop?”
“Why?” Harry asked, remembering how only a week later, when they bumped into each other at the Leaky and Malfoy hadn’t even glanced his way.
“It’s-” Harry took a shaky breath, “it’s treacle tart.”
“Explain.” Draco interrupted.
her sadistic tendencies.
“Is that red and green fog part of the game?” he asked Draco. He was half expecting Draco to answer with some sneering put down, since Harry’s unfamiliarity with Magical stuff was one of Draco’s favourite jump-off points for a monologue.
“And yet you’ve styled yourself as some kind of expert.”
By the time Tonks caught up with them, Harry and Draco got all the way past the block of Auror desks, down the lift, through the Ministry of Magic atrium and they were ambling down Horse Guards Avenue as Draco loftily explained to Harry why, eggzactly, tomato-free shakshuka would not cut the mustard.
“What’s not worth it?” Cormac’s head poked over Harry’s shoulder. “Shower sex, eh? Personal fave but not sure it’s quite right for you, Haz.” He gave Harry a conciliatory bicep squeeze.
“Alright, enough questions about me,” Harry glanced at the clock. “If I know Hermione we’ve got max three minutes until they’re back, so tell me. What do you want?”
*~*~*
“Hello to you, too,” said Draco. “She, ah, she wasn’t being serious about fetching Luna?”
“Wha—?” Harry protested, glancing up at Cassius. It must have been really hot in the room, because Cassius was blushing as well. A red haze settled over his handsome face as he glared at Harry. And that just didn’t make any sense, because Cassius’ cheeks went dark brown when he blushed - not that Harry had spent a lot of time cataloguing this - and his collar seemed to be blushing a bright pink, too.
The cleaners seemed to share Draco’s unease. Sasha had planted himself in one of the six open doorways that overlooked the hall, arms folded and unlit cigarette clamped between his teeth as he glared at the swamp. The other cleaner, the one who simply stared Draco down when he introduced himself, was at least pretending to clean the wall behind Sasha. Although, Draco wasn’t completely convinced that the wallpaper itself should be coming off on the sponge.
joke. He tried to stop but new giggles kept running through him and he had to take a deep swallow of his Cheerio-cocktail.
“Tail out the window, head busting through the wall into the hallway, panicking too much to change back.” Harry was starting to enjoy himself. “Or maybe we’ll be really lucky and get an animal that can’t survive out of water. Three sardines flopping around on the floor while Snape runs off to look for a bucket. I hope you’ve got salt water handy.”
“Ghastly people,” Draco considered a theatrical shudder, then reconsidered when he realised it would place parts of him in sudden, repeated, contact with Harry. “We should follow them, or at least stop canoodling in a bog.”
Harry felt a smile stretch across his face as the knots in his stomach he hadn’t even realized had been there, for weeks probably, started to untangle. “I realized that night, too.” He stepped closer to Malfoy, not close enough to touch, but close enough for the bubble of intimacy to envelop them. “I was scared too, I still am. We’re a disaster. Much worse than Ron and Cormac.”
“Our financial position may no longer be what it once was but I assure you, my dear boy, that matters are far from desperate.”
“Not even a bit?” Harry translated for Cormac.
“What,” he cleared his throat, “what makes you think that?” How many Liams were there in London? Lots, Draco decided. There must be lots. Lots of Liams who were attracted to men and liked eating cereal and had decided to arrange a date at this particular restaurant on this particular evening.
“Oh, okay.” Harry nodded, took a deep breath. “Yeah, good point. Okay. I do want us to be friends.” A thrill shot through him as he watched Draco’s face fall slightly. “But, er, when I woke up and you were gone, on the last morning, I felt a bit empty? Maybe?”
“Right, first, it’s a Shake Weight.” Ron held up a finger. “Second, much as it pains me to admit it, those leg warmers do good things for his thighs and you know it.” Harry was forced to nod. Cormac McLeggen was a sight to behold. “And third, we were talking about how you’re beyond even my matchmakerly prowess.”
On screen the first-date versions of Harry and Draco were having an argument about the fictional Liam. Their real-life counterparts watched Draco try to storm out, only for the tape to flicker and transport him back to Harry.
“Cheers Draco.” Ron raised his new pint, downing half of it before anyone could
“Don’t bother.” She turns and walks away, leaving Draco in a puddle of melting snow.
“Now, run along and firecall your father.” Umbridge smile became slightly less manic as she read what must look like capitulation on Draco’s face. “I shall wait here for you, and then we will allow Dumbledore’s minions to show us where this weapon is kept.”
“Goodbye, Mr Potter.” Snape’s mask was back in place, although his cleaning charms seemed to fizz and sing a little louder.
“How wonderful,” Minerva murmured, wondering if she should go and stop Flint from shoving grass-cuttings down Woods’ back. “If I can be of any assistance, please do think of me.”
“Delightful.” Draco suppressed an eyeroll. “We’ll take two of the green bowls, please.”
“Surveillance of the cafe. Oh didn’t you know?” Ginny’s grin grew even wider. “Time traps are recorded for evidence and everyone involved needs to sign off permission before they can be used in a legal case.” She spoke as if from memory. Clearly having a brother in the Auror-Healer corps was doing wonders for both her knowledge of the law
“No.” Potter flashed Draco a rueful grin. “It was to help me work out those golden eggs we got. The way he phrased it made it sound like a bit of a come-on, though, and I suppose after the egg opened I realised I hadn’t really minded the idea that it was one. A come-on. What about you?”
They smiled at each other. It was intolerable.
“Alright that’s enough,” Harry pushed himself to his knees and pointed his wand at the watching otters. “Expectrum Patronum!” A stag erupted from the end of his wand, sending the otters scurrying off the bed. “Tell Hermione to calm the fuck down,” Harry said to the stag. He waited for it to gallop off before collapsing back onto the bed, one arm thrown over his eyes.
Harry hummed, giving Draco an assessing look. “You said you’d not been to that pub before? How’d you know what it smelled like?”
“Wait, why are those three the only ones who can play?” Harry regretted the question as soon as he asked. Sooner. It was like he knew he was making a mistake before he’d even opened his mouth.
Harry woke to find Snape looming over him.
“Yes, I am aware.” Draco snapped. Honestly, the Ravenclaw Inquisitors were so achingly
“Your…”
“Are you saying you wouldn’t want to hurt Draco now, Harry?” said Hermione.
Struggling to decide which scenario was less believable: that Malfoy would have a girlfriend (and be nice enough to run errands for her), or that the Aurors didn’t realise Hermione could neutralise tracking charms in seven different languages, Harry kept quiet.
“Course, er…” Ron trailed off. “Thing is…er…” he glanced at the Floo. “Thing is…”
“Vain people, you mean?”
“Obviously. Honestly, Potter. Did you learn anything at—”
It didn’t last long.
“Visiting the Infirmary,” said Blaise, lowering his hand.
“She does have a point”, said Draco. He experimentally wiggled his captive shoulder and Tonks’ pincer grip intensified.
“Excuse me,” said Malfoy. “Aren’t you an Auror?”
“Yes, ah,” Fred stepped over to where Harry and Angelina were sitting on the bed. “Ah, just, er, budge up Draco, you beast.” He grinned at Draco, squeezing in between him and Harry. “Look, it’s, ah, it’s a good charm for making sure that people like me and this arsehole—” he nodded to George who was back from the vending machines, “—it makes sure that arseholes like us don’t get carried away and insist that everyone snogs everyone else. You know, because it’s kind of hilarious.” He grinned at Harry, who felt himself grinning back. Maybe it would be okay. Maybe he wasn’t a rapist. Maybe Draco
“Would you like to try some soggy mattress filling?” Draco offered, nudging his own bowl across the table.
“Smooth move,” said Harry, watching with interest as Draco’s hands tightened around the notebook. The movement made his knuckles so white that Harry could almost believe the bone was sticking through. Suddenly squeamish, he looked down at his own knuckles; dark brown and relaxed against the pale denim of his jeans. Hermione had told Harry to wear these jeans, brushing off his complaints about how tight they were and insisting that “Liam” would like them. How Hermione knew what jeans Draco liked was a rabbit hole that Harry had no intention of clambering down.
. It didn’t ring any bells but, scrabbling through the memories previously obscured by the memory charm, Harry did recall weeks spent comforting Hermione. She’d escaped her own abductors but returned to the house the two of them shared with nightmares as a souvenir.
While Harry pondered the qualities of Malfoy’s smiles, the man had stepped up to the table, taken a bottle of lube in his hands, and let the liquid dribble over the head of a fake cock. As if slapped, Harry jerked out of his thoughts. Oh, no
“Well maybe if you didn’t set me up with arseholes-” Harry cut himself off as he realised that Ron actually knew his type rather well, and that he was starting to miss one arsehole in particular.
20th February, 2000
. Or not. Hmm.
Harry has been finding himself spending time with this little family almost everyday, mostly due to Scorpius’s insistence on meeting Loki everyday so that he doesn’t forget him.
“Harry, why does the puppy not have a name?”
He had turned then and found Potter standing closer than before, looking nervous as he pointed above them.
For Day 7 of the 25 Days of Drarry 2020 Challenge.
“Aha,” he exclaims, spotting fresh strawberries on the counter. A quick survey of the kitchen shows he has everything he needs for a delicious snack.
The counter curse starts flowing off his lips before he’s aware of it.
difficult to choose one but I think Loki fits the little guy perfectly!
It was days upon days of theoretical studies on spell work and damage, practical hours on forms of combat, ward breaking and spell detection. It was more work that Harry had imagined.
“Don’t think so much about it, it’s just two friends getting together. Dinner at my place or we can  go some place else, I don’t care. Just say yes.”
“What is it?”
“Draco, we’re alone at home.”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“You’re so good with Teddy,” Harry breathes, his lashes fluttering against Draco’s hair, “we would be such good parents.”
Draco had found the classroom on accident during one of his nightly walks around the castle, sleep evading him so regularly he’d all but given up on the facade of getting ready for bed.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispers, his voice gravelly and deep like it always got first thing in the morning. “He’s been asking to see you since last night.”
It was the third time Harry had promised he would be there only to get delayed or held up somewhere. Draco had been okay with it so far, had tried to be patient and understanding. But not anymore because this time Harry had promised. He had sworn up and down he would be there.
“There’s nothing to be done now,” he mutters, downing his potion for the morning in one go. He sighs as he steps under the warm water, the delicious pressure of the spray on his back making him stretch in relief. At the pull in his lower back, Draco bites back a moan and wonders if they
For some reason I was writing this thinking there's 15 chapters. When in reality there will be 25. Oops.
He is ready to give up when he feels a tug on his trouser leg, a tiny chocolate brown puppy, with the most brightest blue eyes Harry has ever seen, is waging a one puppy battle against his trousers. He tugs and tugs, till his grip slackens and the little thing goes tumbling down, but he’s up and ready again, growling at Harry’s leg.
“Harry,” Draco exclaims softly, one hand coming up rest on Harry’s cheek. “Why are you running yourself ragged? You’ve been stressing about the wedding for weeks now.”
When the summons come, Draco walks into the room with his head held high. He doesn’t flinch as the curse hits him; as consciousness fades away, he hopes that Potter makes the bastard suffer.
I need to work harder than the others. I don’t want to give anyone a chance to say I only got into the program because of my name.”
What he needs is to find a way to settle in, something to help him feel like this home, like he’s not so alone.
Scorpius, who is busy petting Loki, points towards the rest of the house.

“Why don’t we let daddy rest today and I -”
“Scorpius Malfoy-Potter, you are the most special little boy in the entire world. Magic doesn’t make you special, your heart does and you have one of the kindest hearts ever. Your dad and I love you because you are perfect, just the way you are.”
A little sneak peek into their future!
“I’m not sure…” Draco trailed off, surprised at the fact that it’s
Harry softly nudged him with his shoulder, stroking a new, bright leaf.
Harry smiles and ruffles Scorpius’s hair as he enters, asking as he takes off his coat, “Where is your daddy?”
And under the cover of darkness, Potter leans in to kiss him.
Draco tried to control the smile threatening to take over.
“I can’t believe it,” he beams, blinking away tears as he tries to speak through his joy. “I was hoping we would talk about maybe adopting one day and - “
Of course, that was before he learnt that firstly, they couldn’t choose their own partner so there went down the drain all the plans of camping with Ron, and secondly, because he just can’t catch a break, the higher powers decided that he and Malfoy would make a really good team.
Harry buys a bath bomb and meets a child who loves cotton candy!
“I should warn you then, stick with me and there will be lots more of that.”
Blaise hops off the table, coming to stand in front of Draco, “It’s Friday night, my friend, and that means it’s time to party.”
Draco looked up and sure enough, levitating in the air above them was a bright sprig of mistletoe, tied together with a golden ribbon. Potter was looking at him, his eyes bright and full lips set in a determined pout. He didn’t move, gazing expectantly at Draco.
Blaise laughs, bright and loud. “Oh, Draco. You’re almost living with him; I doubt you even remember the last time you went home. Not to mention, you’re having weekly Sunday brunches with his family and I have it on good account that Narcissa approves of him.”
But in this case he would have preferred to be informed that his partner on the case was going to be the acclaimed curse breaker, and git extraordinaire, Draco Malfoy. At least then he wouldn’t have cursed and thrown a tantrum in the Head Mistress’s office.
Draco shoots him a look, finding Harry staring right back at him.
Warning for implied violence.
Harry and his feelings.
Harry sniff, prompting Draco to envelope him in a hug again, holding on tight till he can hear Harry breathing normally again.
“Come on, into bed both of you,” Harry gently herds them along, knowing full well just how long it’s going to take them to get changed and tucked into bed.
on tumblr.  Thanks! ♥
Within seconds I have him spread again and I get to work: kissing, licking and sucking his hole until my spit is dripping down his crack onto his bollocks. I push the tip of my tongue past the ring of muscle and almost moan as he tightens around it. He’s still loose from a few hours ago, which means I won’t have to finger him open again. It also means I can easily fuck him with my tongue.
idea.”
"Malfoy," he calls again, tapping on the table with his knuckles. At his enquiring look, one perfect eyebrow arched, Harry waves in the general direction of his pocket. "Show me?"
Like Draco would ever willingly come between something Harry maybe wanted just because he didn’t want to be left aimless alone.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Yep, that’s my talent.”
It’s a silly little thing but within minutes they’re arguing, each trying to keep their voices low so as not to wake Scorpius.
“Will you and daddy come and pick me up?”
Harry arrives at Draco’s house bright and early, armed with gifts for both his dates inside.
Harry nods. “Me too.”
Harry stands against the entryway, smirking at the sight of Draco in an apron. It is cute, yeah, but the sight made him want to push Draco up against a counter and mess him up a little. Unfortunately, with Scorpius just outside that isn’t really an option but he
Potter flushed a little, the colour in his cheeks a stark contrast to the paleness of the rest of his face.
It’s as I’m almost lulled asleep by the sound of his breathing that I feel his fingers slip against mine and hold on tight.
As Draco settled into his usual spot on the window ledge, Transfiguration scroll in hand, he found his thoughts wandering back to Potter. He tried hard to ignore the other’s presence in the room by studiously focusing on the text in front of him, but Hubert’s Law of Matter Transference was even less engaging than usual.
Harry hides his smile and tries to act like he didn’t a word as Scorpius turns back to him and says, in full seriousness, “That means we are neighbours”.
“He’s going to love these.”
Malfoy laughs then, bitter and filled with self-loathing; Harry wants to smooth his hands over Malfoy’s shoulders, ease the tension he can see in those muscles.
“Of course.”
He walks out thirty minutes later with the puppy in his arms.
“Malfoy?” he mumbled, voice raspy. He seemed lost,
Malfoy sits up, ignoring Harry’s whine as his blankets get pulled away.
Where Harry decides to finally act like a Gryffindor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re
Maximus blinks at him.
“Malfoy! SHUT UP!”
They don’t stay long after, just enough for Harry and Draco to get the more common questions out of the way. Their conversation is stilted in a way it never was before.
Harry looks up at Malfoy, hoping he’s doing the right thing. Malfoy nods at him, his expression once again confusing Harry, giving him the impression that he’s being tested.
“You didn’t have any friends?” Scorpius asks, looking genuinely scandalised.
As Hermione and Harry wait for Ron to pay bill, Hermione turns to Harry and with a smirk, asks, “How’s Draco?”
“What . . no. . is
“So can’t I.”
five-year-olds.
, feel Draco’s body. Draco shudders at the touch, biting down on Harry’s lip when Harry digs his fingers in a little. He knows they should stop soon, Scorpius can walk in any minute and Harry isn’t sure just how much he knows about Draco and his relationship. But it’s so easy to get lost in the kiss, especially when Draco is doing that
They finally make it to the Atrium, Harry being the first one to run off. He pauses near the revolving doors, looking back to wave at Draco.
Harry looks up to see Draco holding out the bag of candy canes that they brought from a street vendor for Scorpius. When Harry had insisted on buying them for the little boy, Draco had smiled indulgently and only put up a token protest, rolling his eyes when Harry had whooped in joy once he had said yes.
“. . . and all I want to do is run my fingers through it and . . “
“Really?”
“-we’re at the pub and he’s refusing to leave till you get here. Come quickly!”
“But I don’t think teaching was ever the path for me,” he continues on. “I’m not sure I have the patience to deal with all the questions and paperwork.”
” Harry mock exclaims, “it’s all you. It’s uncanny.” He giggles at Draco’s affronted expression, pressing kisses along his neck till Draco relaxes back into his pillow. He noses along Draco's jaw, dropping a featherlight kiss along his corner of his lips before brushing along his cupid's bow. Draco opens up easily under him, bringing a hand up to cup his cheek. They kiss slowly, enjoying the moment and each other’s presence. When Harry barely suppresses a yawn, Draco presses one list kiss against his lips.
“I’ll be back soon, okay?” Harry says, almost as if he’s reassuring both Draco and Teddy, and then he’s gone.
“Well,” Harry tries explaining, “I need to find a name that suits him.”
“You can sleep here, when you need to.”
I don't remember how to write smut so your imagination will need to suffice, I'm sorry! :')
Scorpius still looks a little confused, his face scrunching adorably as he looks up at Harry.
With a determined nod, he starts coming up with a list of things he would need.
They share a long heated look, forgoing the need for words and Draco feels light headed; he takes another long drink, without breaking eye contact. He’s breathing hard, the club feeling hot suddenly. As green eyes stay trained on him, Draco reaches up to undo his tie, his long fingers tugging at the material till the tie hangs loose around his neck. Across the room he starts walking towards Draco, already pulling off his coat and revealing that slim waist and broad shoulders that Draco knows he’s left marks on.
He's still trying to explain his point when a tiny flash goes off, making Harry blink to dispel the flashing light still blinding him. As he clears his head, the flash having sobered him faster than he would have liked, he catches Malfoy hiding a small smile behind his glass.
Draco has had enough.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“I’ve wanted to do that for so long,” Malfoy whispers against his lips, bringing Harry’s attention to the fact that they’re pressed together, he can feel Malfoy’s chest rise and fall against his. He’s never before noticed just how red Malfoy’s lips are, or how he can stare into Malfoy’s eyes for hours.
“Harry!”
Malfoy smiles. “Thank you, it’s a recipe I learnt during the summers before fourth year.”
“Shut up, Potter, gloating doesn’t suit you.”
It sounds like days spent sitting at his knee, believing that he was invincible.
“Yes.”
“Do you think you can stand? I sent Healer Walsh a Patronus, he’ll be expecting us.”
“Potter.”
Malfoy’s face when they first stand in front of the wall, ready to call the room into existence, is one that makes Harry want to touch him, hold his hand or stand next to him so that Malfoy  would know he’s not alone.
Harry took a step forward. He looked scared.
He beckons him closer, waiting till Teddy is squatting next to him to carefully place a little soil in his tiny palm.
Potter looked different. Tired, yes, but also matured in a way Draco didn’t feel yet. His face seemed more chiselled, age defining his cheekbones and jawline in a way that emphasised his features. There was even a hint of stubble around his jaw. Potter had grown into a handsome man, irrevocably changed by the last year. Draco still felt as if he stood on the cusp of adulthood.
“It’s Christmas, Draco.” Teddy pouts, no trace of the stubborn seven-year-old who had been ecstatic on picking out his new bed. “Please?”
“I’m her boss,” he grumbles. Taking a deep breath, he seems to prepare himself before he asks, “So?”
Suddenly Harry remembers he had actually been running late. “Sorry for making you wait, Malfoy,” he rushes to apologise, fixing himself and adding, “err Draco.”
that I expect you to come out to see me. Or, you know, wait for you to show up or something. It’s okay either way. If you’re there in the morning or not. You know. It’s
Zeb already has the fire roaring while Milly brings around hot chocolate. Curled into Harry on the sofa, Draco watches Teddy carefully unwrap each gift.
He flushes, ducking his head. “Scorpius is a wonderful child, he deserves to get every possible opportunity he can. And If I can help any way, then . .” He shrugs, trailing off.
“The thing is.” Draco taps his fingers on the carpet, a silly melody he’d heard on the wireless the day before. “I quite liked the thrill of it, if I’m being honest.”
Harry rushes over to their table, relieved to see almost all their friends standing around Draco. He shoots Hermione a grateful look before kneeling by Draco’s chair and taking his hand.
Much like the indifferent witch at the welcome desk, the Ministry had changed considerably. The Atrium is more open now, the towering pillars replaced with rows of Floos and what seem to be rotating doors, witches and wizards walking out every few turns.
Harry doesn’t even have to think about it.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“That’s amazing,” Draco remarks, any awkwardness he felt forgotten as he leans closer to take a better look. “Metamorphmagi are quite rare, let alone ones this young.”
“Emma Way is our Expert on Potions and Herbology.”
The direct reference to their conversation and his departure makes Draco freeze.
Draco laughs. “I don’t think so, you need to relax.”
The atmosphere lightens, making Draco’s racing heart slow down a little. “Anyway,” he continues softly, raising a hand to brush through Harry’s dishevelled hair. “I do remember bringing up this little difference in our anatomies. We can thank Great Aunt Alice for this, she’s the one who always fancied a shag with a Veela.”
Draco clears his throat. “No, it’s not because of that. Mcgonagall has her faults, but I’ve never known her to be unfair.”
(See the end of the chapter for
stealthy they were but Harry can’t feel anything but joy. Its’ perfect, everything is perfect.
“. . . but then Aunt Hermione walked into the room. She was so angry. Rose is grounded for a week.” Albus chortles, nudging Scorpius with his elbow. He looks far too gleeful to be completely innocent. Harry watches in amusement as Scorpius shoots his brother a glare, almost an identical copy of the unimpressed look Draco wears when he’s just about done with Harry’s antics.
“You better warn him to sleep with his eyes open.”
will he do next?
“Girls too?”
Christmas at the Manor used to be the day he’d get whatever he asked for. There had been no gift, no toy, no new broomstick that he demanded and didn’t receive. It was the day all his wishes were fulfilled.
“Loki!”
Harry nods. “That sounds fun. I’ll do it too.” Before Malfoy can interrupt he flags down the bartender and asks for his suggestions.
Patience is clenched fingers and bitten down curses.

does make me feel better.”
“I’m pregnant.”
And the fact that Harry hasn’t ever seen Draco perform magic in front of Scorpius.
Harry
Maybe, Draco hoped, stepping closer and wrapping an arm around Potter’s neck. Maybe this Christmas could be a little like those.
He’s still staring when Harry turns, his smile bright enough to match the sun rays behind him as he greets Draco, “Good morning!”
Draco laughs, his entire body shaking as he chuckles against Harry’s shoulder.
“Of course.” Harry nods solemnly, biting back a grin.
Draco shrugs, “Just telling the truth. And besides, Weasel, you weren’t the only one who lost. Longbottom handled his loss quite admirably.” Draco munches on an apple, frowning thoughtfully as he continues, “Though, I think that might have to do with the way Lovegood was eyeing him and I can’t say I blame her. You wouldn’t think –“
Harry stands against the entryway, smirking at the sight of Draco in an apron. It is cute, yeah, but the sight made him want to push Draco up against a counter and mess him up a little. Unfortunately, with Scorpius just outside that isn’t really an option but he
With a sigh, Harry heads for the kitchen. He has an intense questioning session to look forward to now.
“Exactly! I need to find the right name for him.”
The potion turns green.
“Malfoy?” Harry gasps. While it might have been years since he last came across the man, probably at the end of the year dinner in their eighth year, it’s a face he knows he can’t ever forget.
,” he pauses for effect, “I got another letter just the day after that one.”
“Shh, back now, I need to open the door you silly little thing.” Harry laughs, nudging the puppy back with his foot as he opens the door, “stop biting, come o- Malfoy!”
“I had fun today,” Draco says, smiling that one smile which made Harry’s heart skip a beat every time.
“I thought you meant don’t forget to wear socks or something! At no point did you mention that I should wear extra layers!”
He squints against the sunlight, resisting the urge to find his wand and get the curtains back across the window so he can sleep in some more. It's Sunday, he has nowhere to be and nothing to do. As the last vestiges of sleep leave him and his vision becomes clearer, Harry discreetly reaches for his glasses from the bedside table behind him so he can appreciate his view better.
With slow dawning horror Harry looks back at Draco.
Dinner is a pleasant affair. Tara is loud and jovial; she has an air around her that instantly puts people at ease, making two hours pass like nothing. It’s around dessert that things take a more serious turn.
“Merry Christmas, Harry.”
"Please?"

. He knows it’s only a matter of time before Ron explodes but Harry would really like to eat breakfast first, he’s had a long and ahem,
“Sure,” Draco said, dropping down onto the carpet next to Harry. “That sounds fun.”
Kreacher makes an appearance! (Or he's mentioned at least!)
Professor Sprout had been nice enough, meeting him for a one-on-one conversation to understand his areas of study and how Herbology could fit in with them. While a career in Potions had always seemed like the obvious choice for him, he’d lately found himself unable to see a future in a career so largely influenced by his godfather.
I know Draco’s knackered, he’s had a long week at work and I should let him sleep. This is why I have no intention of waking him up.

Teddy bites his lip, looking up at Draco.

He gestures for her to lead the way and follows behind, taking in the warm decorations of the room. The tree stands in the corner, covered in Christmas baubles of different colours - red, green, gold and silver, fairy lights, tinsel and glitter. It’s wonderful, a far cry from the perfectly decorated trees at Hogwarts. The handiwork is sloppy in certain places, like the majority of glitter being sprinkled on the floor around the tree, most of the Christmas baubles are placed on the lower branches, the perfect height for a little child to reach up on his toes.
about applying to the Auror Program. I just asked him a few questions about his experience.”
“Listen,” Draco says, wrapping his scarf around his neck, “Scorpius has been begging to meet the puppy. Can I bring him by tomorrow?”
They start apologising together, each speaking over the other, begging for forgiveness. They fall into bed and create new memories to overshadow those that left bruises and aches.
The area around the wall are still under the throes of winter, the trees frozen solid, the grass no longer visible under the layer of snow. But there’s still more than enough space for a little puppy to run and play to his heart’s content.
“I was stubborn and now Scorpius will have to pay for it.”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“Yeah, they’re alright.”
But just because he can’t taste doesn’t mean he can’t tempt; at least till his man arrives. So Draco ups the ante, taking another deep swig, making sure to tilt his head back so that his neck is visible; his Adams apple bobbing as he swallows the drink. The music is picking up, the beat getting faster as the night wears on, couples getting more risqué as the level of inebriation in the club rises. Draco keeps dancing while avoiding lingering hands. It’s about an hour after Draco had arrived that he comes in.
So he’d refuse every time Harry would ask and would spend the afternoon alone instead, busying himself in the schoolwork or, surprisingly, find himself near the greenhouses.
“Potter, stop being so logical.”
“You okay?”
Harry wants something that’s just his.

Especially early in the mornings or later during the day, which is when he finally had the time to visit. With every visible surface covered in plants and pots of varying sizes and an array of earthy smells assaulting his senses, it was like entering an enclosed space that still made him feel like he could breathe. Though the walls were all glass, most of the outside view was obscured by leaves and vines of a multitude of shapes, colours and sizes.
Draco sighs exaggeratedly, “No, much worse.”
With his brow furrowed he watched on as a figure cut a path through the fog, running around the lake with a steady pace.
Super short chapter, sorry! I ended up getting really busy today. ♥
With this chapter, we have reached the end of this stage of the fic. I'm happy ending this here, now. ♥
“Oh?”
The poor puppy needs some way to work off all his energy and Harry would rather his new pair of boots stay safe from Loki’s little teeth.
Harry swallows.
“I guess I should start from the beginning . . . “

Malfoy takes a deep breath, strokes the puppy’s back once before letting him down to the floor. Harry realises that he can’t just stand there and listen without having something to do. Almost on autopilot he reaches for the kettle, tea
