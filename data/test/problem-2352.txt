James shot Harry a triumphant grin as he bypassed his mother one final time to plant a kiss on her cheek. Habit made him kiss the pale scar hashed across her cheekbone. She smiled at him fondly as he turned away. "You look like your dad when you wear them," she said.
"There are so many other fish in the sea, so many better pickings. You could have – hell, I'd even prefer you shag Ginny –"
The girls shared a moment of laughter that sounded a little forced, but Harry didn't mind. His interview with the officers had been awkward, so it wasn't as though he was expecting the one with his friends to be any better.
"Hm," Harry hummed around his straw. "People who think they're above me and all that because they have more social status or whatever." He continued as Draco's brow furrowed and hastened to add, "but you're not all that bad, Draco. I mean, you seem like a bit of an arse most of the time, but for the rest of it – yeah, not so bad."
Briefly, Harry was sure Draco was joking. His words, so serious and blunt, were so at odds with the vibrant, reeking McDonalds that it had to be. A murderer? Someone who'd killed 'a lot of people' and whose legacy had affected generations to come? Generations
"I've always been one, Harry. You've only just noticed now because you're finally learning manners for yourself."
"You and me are swapping." Jackie's smirk was far too satisfied as she jangled the key in Harry's face. "Pansy and me already talked about it."
"You just Apparated," Draco said, cutting him off again, "even though you told me you're not a wizard."
The grandfather clock in the living room had never seemed so loud. The living room itself never so deadly quiet. It was so hushed that the minute buzz of electricity, the hum of power winding through cords and cables to the television, to the phone in its cradle on the coffee-table beside the door, sounded like thematic background music.
Jacob opened his mouth retort, his friends snickering around him, but Harry planted himself before Jill and spoke before he could manage. "Look, Jacob, if you wanted to be the centre of attention so badly, you could do a strip show on the table or something rather than trying your hand at stand-up comedy. Your taste in jokes sucks."
"I mean," Harry felt the hitch of Draco's swallow more than he heard it, "that what you're going through, and your struggle? I could be constituted the same in my prejudice, only in a different area."
Reaching absently into his pocket, gaze still fixed upon the spread before him, he raised his phone to his ear. "Yes?"
Shivering slightly, Harry tucked his arms a little more tightly around himself. His chill had nothing to do with his blankets, magically warmed to stave off the iciness of winter's fingers that seeped through the dormitory's windows. Rather, it was the bed itself. It was his own arms, wrapped through one another, that seemed so insufficient. It was that the bed, once so gloriously his own, felt far too big for just himself.
They splayed across the table. He knew he should pack them away, should stow them for when he would inevitably return from his trip, but Draco had been staring at them for over an hour and couldn't draw himself away. His Portkey was set to leave that afternoon, and he anticipated hype at the terminal simply for being there – but he couldn't turn away from the images. He'd already pushed back his departure unnecessarily once – but he almost couldn't bring himself to leave.
It didn't last long. Harry didn't know how anyone possibly could. His irrepressible gasps and moans, whimpers and garbled attempts to speak Draco's name, culminated in a fevered "Draco, I'm going to –" before he couldn't hold himself back. Eyes closing, hips jerking, his hand in Draco's hair tightening, Harry was seized by the peaking waves of pleasure that burst through him.
"Did you not read any of the presentation, even though you presented?" Draco asked. "Because I'm suspecting not. You certainly did a poor performance."
Glancing sidelong, Harry met Draco's gaze. Standing in his robes – actual robes the likes that Harry still couldn't believe he'd have to wear himself – he looked like he was trying to bite back a smirk. It wouldn't be uncharacteristic of him. In fact, if anything, it would be far more typical than the melancholy he was only beginning to climb his way out of after weeks of brooding.
Harry didn't know what that touch meant. Just as he didn't know what Draco meant in that he 'made it harder' for him. He didn't quite understand why Draco had spoken as he had, or laughed without humour the way he did, or why he proceeded to make up his own bed and gesture Harry into it before Transfiguring his couch into a pseudo mimic and climbing into it himself.
Confusion made an even greater mess of Harry's head than it already had been. How had the situation, a perfect, wonderful situation, turned into nonsense and impossibility so quickly? Abruptly, he decided he'd had enough.
Harry immediately felt his hackles rise. Some upstart of a reporter – because it was a reporter, was always a Wizarding gossip-monger that invaded the sanctity of their space – was spouting noise about Dot. It would always be the same in that regard too: Harry should be the figurehead of the Wizarding world, not a figure in the Muggle one. He should be working for the ministry, or he should be an Auror, or he was supposed to be reserving his public appearances and professional time for Wizarding magazines and papers.
Harry could only stare at her. The small hospital room felt cluttered with so many bodies – his parents like sentinels on either side of his bed, Sirius skulking in the corner and Remus in his chair – and the two officers' entrance only added to the effect. Harry still felt a little light-headed, a little groggy after waking up only an hour before, and the intrusion wasn't helping.
Harry shrugged. None of Draco's accusations were new. It was all water off a duck's back at this point. "You have your priorities when it comes to work. I have mine."
Retreating just as quickly, Ginny took a step backwards. She beamed at Harry, raised a hand, and backed down the hallway. "Catch me later, yeah? The pitch. I'm counting on it."
"It's okay, Mum," he called back, straightening. "I nearly killed myself, but really, I'm fine. I'll try and mind my swearing in future."
Draco spared Pansy a sidelong glance to which she only gave the minutest of shrugs. He accepted the menu as she silently suggested, flipping it towards himself. Only to snort a moment later and roll his eyes. "Really, Pansy?"
For they were Muggles, Draco realised. Muggles in a Muggle club. He didn't care, and would probably even prefer a Muggle establishment if he actually had any preference at all, but he had to wonder.
Harry thought that Ron replied, though with words or something else he wasn't sure. He caught it as he instinctively turned back towards Draco and took in the slight frown on his forehead, the tug of his lips to the side, and felt the minute shift of his hands around his waist.
Alone with his thoughts, Draco couldn't help but wonder. Why was it, exactly, that he'd suddenly decided to care so much?
"You'll freeze your arse off." He spoke quietly, yet in the hush of the dormitory it somehow felt loud.
The girl, Hermione, rolled her eyes in a practiced response that left Harry with nothing if not the suspicion that they knew each other well. No one could possibly demonstrate such resigned exasperation otherwise. Harry knew it quite well himself. He might not have many friends but those he did have? Rolled eyes and one-armed hugs were their primary modes of communication.
A woman sat upon a white floor in nothing but an oversized white shirt, her legs elegantly folded around herself as she stared intensely at the camera.
At midday, the crowds of witches and wizards appeared to be out in full-force. There were men and women, children throughout, and all weaving in a garbled dance of embroidered robes and pointed hats. Sparks danced overhead, jumping across those hats as though they were stepping stones, and somewhere distantly something played jaunty music that managed to weave into a mess of a song with the conversation and laughter, the shouts and cries of playing children.
"I'm…" Draco trailed of for a moment before clearing his throat and continuing. "I'm just about to leave."
Harry didn't know why Draco asked. The questions might have been construed as intrusive, and Harry thought that quite a few people might even consider them too much, but he didn't care. With the shame, the inexplicable apology he felt towards Draco – for walking in on him? For having to see what he'd seen? – Harry felt as though he owed it to him.
They were a little tattered, but not enough to suggest they'd been there for long. Yellowing paper, stark black print, and images in motion at the very centre of each, as though they were little snippets of movies constantly playing a different yet stagnant scene. Moving pictures, Harry reminded himself. Draco had told him about them, had even shown him one when he'd asked, but it felt somehow different seeing it out in the open, carelessly pinned to a wall.
"She's right," Blaise said, slouching back in his seat. "She'll tell you even when you don't ask for it. Especially when, actually."
Disregarding the man, Draco dropped to his knees and began scooping up his prints. It was a good thing they were only untouched drafts; even if he could reprint them, he would be seething if he was required to. Copies weren't cheap.
Harry flinched. Venom dripped from Draco's voice, thickened with a resurgence of anger. "Yeah," he said quietly, dropping his hand back into his lap and training his gaze onto his knees. "Sorry."
Until that moment, Harry hadn't quite understood just what Draco considered magic. A week after they'd given their chosen topic to Mrs. Joyce, it began to dawn on him.
Truth be told, Harry didn't know why Draco had decided to be his boyfriend. He hadn't seemed the type, and Harry thought he'd become rather adept at discerning those sort of 'types' over the past few years. It wasn't hard to tell when a boy looked at him whether they were just looking or really
Draco didn't reply, but his shuffling ceased. As Harry set in bottled silence, swathed in a dark cloud that had nothing to do with the darkness shrouding the unfamiliar room, the pause of utter silence hummed like static between them. Then, with a heavy sigh that seemed to draw all remaining anger from Draco's voice, he said, "Why are you apologising again?"
Harry wondered about that. He really did. After all, Draco was not only a man but also their mutual ex-rival. Ron still had difficulties with civility at times, even after months of living in the same dorm as Draco. Still, he sat silent and attentive, un-interrupting as Ron continued.
Which wasn't to say that it was necessarily bad, but he found himself utterly unsurprised when, leading them back to the stage room, the guide planted himself before their crowd and began performing magic tricks.
She twisted the phone around to him, presenting the bright screen. Harry accepted it. He stared at it for a moment. He cocked his head. He considered it for a moment longer. "Oh. That's…"
It wasn't just because he was hot. Not just because Harry could relate to his experience of being marginalised and ostracised, even if their circumstances were different. Not because he was the only person helping Harry with their assignment, or because he seemed to have leant into their research in a manner that bespoke real interest. Not even because he still watched Harry's magic tricks with keen fascination, though that was certainly a part of it.
Ron slept. How he managed, Harry didn't know, but he'd always been a fast sleeper. They'd spoken quietly, shortly, before bed that evening, murmured words of little consequence – "Hermione wanted to head to Hogsmeade this weekend for Christmas shopping," and "Cool. Maybe I'll come this time" – but Ron's eyelids drooped and he didn't last long. Harry envied him that. When was the last time he'd fallen to sleep without a struggle? He didn't know. It felt like a long time.
"Hating my sister," Ron said with less heat than the statement warranted. "She's a bullshit artist, and I can't stand her."
Harry had noticed the ties. It seemed a little strange and inexplicable, that there was such a wealth of diverging uniforms. He knew that some schools disregarded uniforms entirely for A-Level students, while others were markedly more lax. Potting Point High wasn't one of those schools, but Harry wasn't unaware.
What Harry offered, though – what he would give, wasn't that. The simple fact that he offered at all, that "I would give it to you" was offered so readily like a sacrifice rather than an exchange, wasn't that. It hurt more than Draco could have ever anticipated. It hurt in parts of him that he hadn't even known existed.
"Great." Harry smiled again, then bit his lip, then struggled to maintain that smile. "So, I was wondering…"
Where the thought came from, Harry didn't know. He wasn't quite sure what triggered it, but instead of embarrassment, instead of anger, what welled forth was regret and something like shame. He wasn't ashamed to be fucking Sammy, not even really to have been found doing so, but that Draco had been the one to walk in on him? Somehow, it burned in places Harry hadn't even considered.
"Yeah," James said. "You might find yourself a boyfriend short if you start making suggestions. I wouldn't put it past him for Lily."
Pansy stared at him unwaveringly for a long moment. Then she clicked her tongue sharply and drew her gaze sideways in a glare. "Bloody hell, Draco. You've fallen deep."
"You've found me out," Harry said, glancing at his father sidelong as he continued his argument with Sirius, a jabbing pointed finger with each word of, "and another twenty pounds in the jar for –!"
Jackie flicked the side of Harry's head affectionately before turning to the slowly arriving Hogwarts pair. "Sometime today would be nice, you two."
Everything that had happened before, every word he'd flung at his parents for hiding magic and the Wizarding world from him, for lying to him, for persisting in denying him the truth, seemed so foolish now. So inconsequential. So cruel and unwarranted, because yes, Harry was angry, had been angry, but not anymore. Not in the face of everything that had followed. He couldn't be, because to see his parents after what had happened felt like the greatest reward in the world.
The man's face cleared instantly, and he too switched to French without a hitch. "Ah, of course! Mr. Malfoy. You have made good time today. I trust your travels were agreeable?"
Harry snorted, but he couldn't help but cling to the thought. They really hadn't been together for that long; a couple of months which paradoxically felt like both longer and shorter than that time. Harry found he couldn't imagine
At Harry's words, the police officers exchanged glances. At least he thought they were police officers. They weren't wearing the kinds of uniforms that he'd seen James and Sirius wear, and there had been no identification badge flashed upon entering the room to prove who they were. Except that Harry's parents – and Sirius and Remus – clearly knew them.
Even if Draco did insist magic was somehow involved, it was worth it. And even if it was under the guise of studying, it felt sort of like a date, which Harry didn't mind so much either. Draco was less of a prat when he was engrossed in magic. He hadn't looked down his nose even once since they'd met that day.
"Snape was trying to teach me Occlumency. It didn't stick 'cause he was as shit at teaching it as he was Potions, but whatever. No disrespecting the dead or anything. I'm sure he was a great bloke."
Was it wrong of him to look? To stare at pictures as though he were truly one of those lustful onlookers, the fans and photographers, the Samuel Ipetsky's of the world? Should Draco look away from what he sorely longed to follow, to approach, even to call just to talk as they'd never really had the chance to?
This time, when Harry turned in a wild spin, he really did trip. It was enough that he would have easily greeted the marble floor with his face had it not been for the raised edge of the fountain providing a convenient handhold. Resolutely ignoring the naked statue barely an arm's length away from him, Harry turned towards the direction he'd heard the voice.
When he lowered it, he met Harry's gaze silently. Whether Harry understood the silent question he asked or simply didn't care, he only smiled slightly in reply, a little confused but otherwise accepting. With only a final nod of his head, he turned and disappeared through the doorway, leaving Draco to cradle the captured image in the depths of camera.
Were they supposed to spend the night talking? Touching? Kissing and… and more than that? Was Jackie's suggestion that they'd really go there, that they'd really have sex, a justified one? Was that what people did when they found themselves with their boyfriends in the privacy of a simple but clean motel, walls thick enough to be soundproof? Harry had fantasised throughout the majority of his teenage life about what he could do, what he
As it happened, in the moments that Harry had been fishing for Jill and Abel, most of the rest of the rest of the students had settled themselves into comfortable quartets. He scanned his surroundings, not particularly bothered, but felt the need to highlight the fact to Jackie nonetheless. "Well, looks like we'll probably be alone again. Shame, that."
Lifting the camera before him, Harry cocked his head, raised an eyebrow, and deliberately snapped a picture in Draco's direction. Draco didn't protest. Once, he might have, and even had on a number of occasion – he was a photographer, not the one to be photographed – but not anymore. Not when the idea of his own picture pinned alongside Harry's presented such a favourable image.
? And yet… "Sort of. You know we've actually worked together in class? Not by choice, but it's actually not disastrous. He's really good at Potions."
Ginny regarded it for a moment before shrugging and scooping it up. "Still good," she said with a short nod.
"What the fuck do you want, Hayes?" he said, a statement which, given who he was talking to and who Jill was to Harry and his friends, seemed a little redundant.
, he thought as he dragged his chair to the side of the room. Not that he could do much about that fact, but it was a little embarrassing to admit, even to himself.
about having someone rise in his defence. Harry's skin prickled with an oddly feverish shiver, and it was almost impossible to resist the temptation to grab Draco and drag him into a fierce kiss right then and there.
"I think it's probably better if we break if off," Daphne had told him matter-of-factly, just as she always spoke of the fundamentals of their relationship. Always clinical, she was. "It's a little strange dating you when it feels like my little sister has a bigger crush on you than I ever did."
Shaking his head, Harry continued up the length of the table. He tapped Ron's shoulder as he passed, gesturing along the benches in vague indication, and left him with eyebrow raised and question half spoken to continue to what little spaces were available.
still for school, you know," he'd said, frowning as they'd climbed into the car that morning. "If you've got such a problem with it you don't have to come,"
"She did?" When Jackie's smile became a delighted grin, Harry punched Jackie's shoulder again before looping an arm around her neck. "Bloody hell, seriously? That's brilliant!"
Picard grunted lowly again. Despite her diminutive stature, it didn't seem strange coming from her. "I think 'meet-and-greet' is an improper use of terms."
Harry had never modelled before. Before Gertrude had found him, he hadn't even considered it for himself. Why should he care about what he wore? Why should he care what he looked like, how he was viewed by others, how his picture was depicted in a magazine? He'd been subjected to interviews and he hated them, even if he did agree to them. But even then, it hadn't been without a degree of derision. What was the point, after all, in the wake of a war that had killed and irreparably damaged so many? There were more important things than hearing Harry talk.
"Don't cry, Evans," Jacob said, and Harry snapped his eyes open. "You should have expected it, really. I warned you what would happen if you try any of that sick crap around here."
was a minefield of dodging glares and hisses of hatred. Since that first intervention, Harry had stepped in with his amicable smile and gently raised hand on several more occasions, but that didn't mean the outright threats and physical violence didn't cease.
"I'm not answering," Draco muttered, more to himself than to whoever lay on the other end of the call. "Leave a message."
Harry watched him approach, and he didn't protest. Just as he didn't comment when Draco cast a sharp glance around the floor, or when he stalked towards the discarded pile of Harry's clothes and snatched them up. He only tipped his head to watch as Draco took himself back towards his side, dropping onto his haunches.
"That's quite impressive," Draco said, frowning. That frown wasn't quite a glare as its predecessors had been. "Very, I might even say."
It wasn't only because Draco was who he was. It was as much because of who Harry was – not only an ex-Gryffindor, someone on the opposite side of the war, but also a boy. Boys didn't fancy boys were Harry came from. He was almost sure that any one of the Dursley's would have spluttered in horror before attempting to beat him black and blue for even considering it. If they'd thought he was, that there was any chance he was…
He knew Bellatrix was insane, that she had an agenda, and that Harry played a part in that agenda. That she had a lord and she was, somehow, working to bring him back. To life? Possibly. Probably. Harry had deduced that much.
It wasn't what Harry had expected. Not at all. Not because it was a regurgitation of the knowledge and history that he and Draco had been meticulously studying for weeks, nor because of the ambiance, the décor, or the excessive theatrics of their guide. It was simply… different. Definitely not typical of a museum.
didn't deserve the vicious attacks that Harry saw increasingly splattering across the papers and gossip magazines. It wasn't fair. It wasn't right. If Harry had the opportunity, he would say something, would do something, would relieve Draco and Pansy of their guilt –
Each were a different level of terror, but none were quite the same as how Harry felt in the face of the truth that Gertrude presented. Not how he felt when he was…
"It's not the word itself but the implications that matter," Harry said. He hunched his shoulders slightly. "I might be a bit of a hypocrite for saying this, but just because you see me as less than you doesn't mean that I'm more stupid, or less capable, or… or… I don't know, unworthy of respect. Who you're born as and where you're born shouldn't matter. It's what you make of yourself."
Modelling hadn't fit him at first. It wasn't something he'd ever considered for himself. But it surprisingly fit more than being an Auror had.
"He's always been an utter ass to us, all of us, and – come on, you saw him at the Battle, right?" Ron glanced between Harry and Hermione, back and forth. "Even after Harry saved him he tried to make nice with the Death Eaters."
Harry only nodded as Von dove into a breakdown of just everything he deemed wrong with Christine Walker's stylistic choices. He'd heard it all before and had to swallow a smirk as Von's satisfaction blossomed like the florals he so despised. Glancing sidelong to where Ginny, Hermione, and Ron clustered, he mouthed a brief "one second", before turning his attention back to Von.
"I really like him," Harry said, closing his eyes once more. "I don't care what family he comes from, or what his parents did in the war, or – or –" He paused, yawning, and sighed as he slipped towards sleep.
"Likewise," Draco said immediately, arms folding casually across his chest. "I'd rather retain my dignity."
Harry shook his head again. What had he gotten himself into exactly? Draco seemed to truly believe his own words. He was the real thing. What was it called again? Wiccan? Pagan? Some kind of old religion or supernatural belief? It sounded like he'd stepped straight out Macbeth.
Silence met his words. Silence that extended for so long, so uncharacteristic of what Harry had grown to know of Draco, that he opened his eyes once more. When he did, it was to find Draco regarding him with a slight frown that was far from unfamiliar to Harry. The frown of interest, consideration, and calculation. The only difference between this and every other time that Draco had worn such an expression when Harry was performing a magic trick was the dawning sense of… wonder?
"One might think you'd be more attentive to something that helps you see properly every single day."
"Oh, so the constant 'did you really not have sex' questions aren't classified as prying in your opinion?"
"True, but the Ministry does so like to posture, and even more so when it comes to criminals and convicts."
"Do I look like I want to be forgiven? He deserved it, even if it was an accident. Fuck, I can't stand them."
Pansy only laughed as she clopped through Dimitri's empty studio. "Trust me, Draco, after the opportunity I've landed you today, you'll be the one regretting every slight you've ever paid me."
Huffing once more, Pansy propped a hand on her hip. She cast a frustrated glance around the empty room that was Draco's pseudo-office, towards the dressing room over her shoulder that Draco had seen Harry leave barely minutes prior, before resettling her gaze upon him.
No. Surely not. Not like that. But he'd said he did. They might tease and taunt one another, but there had never been a prank like this before. Not when they were younger and certainly not now. And Pansy… what Pansy had said… Harry found himself glancing towards the point she'd vacated. It kind of fit. He'd just –
Ron said something else, and Hermione replied with a touch of bright enthusiasm, but Harry barely heard them. He might not know his own thoughts or feelings, or what he was going to tell Draco on the other side of Christmas, but he felt better with a hint of direction. Steadied, like a boat in a tumultuous sea abruptly lent a beaming light from a lighthouse.
Lowering his gaze to his toes, Harry pursed his lips. "You don't have to if you don't want to. Or if it's not allowed that you teach me or whatever. Is it forbidden? Because that's fine if you have to have a proper teacher or something, especially since, you know, magic does seem like it can be sort of dangerous. But I was thinking, seeing as somewhere along the way I missed my letter to go to your school – you said you got a letter, right? When you were eleven? I was thinking that I could, even for maybe just a few things, try to –"
With a sigh, Lily slumped onto the couch. Her head rocking back, and she scrubbed her eyes with the heels of her palms.
"What?" Wrenching his gaze from the wand, from repositioning himself to stay in its line of fire, Harry latched onto James' twisting face. "Dad, what are you talking about?"
"Do you think we could ask to be transferred back to the Basement?" Susan said, and though Harry saw a smile touch her lips, it was nowhere near as vibrant as those he'd seen her wear in the past.
"Hey," Draco said, his voice sharp, loud, and rising with something that sounded almost concerned. Harry wanted to look at him but couldn't even if Jacob's grasp had allowed him to. "What are you -? Put him down, you –"
Harry knew his mouth was hanging open again. He knew he stared like an idiot, and he continued to do nothing else when Malfoy turned back towards him. The smile – no, the smirk, for it was definitely more smirking than smiling this time – widened a little further. "So? What do you think?"
Draco sniffed. There was no delicate way to go about making a demand for such truths, not with someone who deliberately lied. Even if there was, Draco had learnt to abandon courteous attempts. He wasn't quite the upstanding pureblood he'd once been, the pureblood he couldn't be when the world considered him so much less.
PJ only grinned up at him, tongue lolling as he followed Harry down the hallway into the kitchen. He'd been Harry's shadow ever since James had carried him through the front door on Harry's seventh birthday. That love was never more demonstrative than loving just after their daily walks.
"Fucking Death Eater scum," he muttered before striding away in the opposite direction to Draco, shoulders rigid with tension.
"The shoot." Draco gestured to the vacated shoreline. "That's a wrap, unless I kick up a fuss and demand we do a re-take. So, what do you think?"
Harry wasn't used to extravagance. He'd lived without for most of his life, with even Hogwarts' particular brand of grandeur being distinctly less confronting. Such rooms, though - they were a little breath-taking, a little overwhelming. He didn't think he particularly liked it. Not at all. It made him feel somehow... small.
"We're all set then?" she said, turning back to the Hogwarts kids. "I don't know what the rest of you four will do, but I'm satisfied with this turn of events."
Draco hadn't even realised he'd been scowling, but he didn't vanquish it as he raised his gaze to glare at Pansy. "Shut the fuck up."
Dot was on her feet and rounding her desk in an instant. She had always been short, but Harry had almost forgotten just how diminutive she was. Not that it really affected her presence; the way she planted herself before him, eyeing him up and down, held the weight of someone three times her size.
"Are those the books you're using for it?" Jill said, pointing towards the stack at Jackie's feet. "The ones you got from the library?"
Draco stopped entirely in place, seemingly unaware of the grumbles and frowns his stillness provoked from the pedestrians passing by him. He stared at Harry, a touch of something pained making a brief appearance upon his feature, before he visibly swallowing. "You said something like that today. In the interview."
"That's…" He drew a sharp breath, snapping his eyes to meet Harry's. "That's magic. You just did magic."
"No." Harry shook his head, the motion made a little uncomfortable from the marble he rested his head upon. "Not anymore. Maybe we've got it all out of our systems or something, or – or maybe it's just… maybe I just…"
Beyond the door, as the hour stretched, noise began to build from a muted murmur to something more. Slowly, incrementally, with one person after another, the office came alive.
Silence. More silence. A ringing, calming, relieving silence that accepted Harry's words without judgment. Another slow inhalation eased the tightness in Harry's chest further, and for the first time since he'd charged blindly into the Room of Requirement, since he'd fled from the prefect's bathroom, he thought it would be okay. That he would be okay, and that –
Harry shrugged. "I don't really care, to be honest. I'll just talk, then, and he can listen whether he wants to or not."
Draco's hand was all but immobile in his own, but that was okay. Harry guided his arousal towards him, easing himself backwards at the same time. His own breath caught at the moment they touched, but he forced himself to relax, to inhale –
, had been close-lipped since they'd left Dimitri and Building Eight behind them. "All in good time," she'd said when Draco posed his questions with increasing demand. "Hold your hippogriffs, Draco. All in good time."
It all happened so fast. Far too fast. Harry wasn't quite sure how he found himself on his knees, all but sprawled on the ground. For a second, he thought he might have crashed into the gate and been thrown backwards rather than latching onto its heights to scale it, might have rebounded like a doll lobbed at a wall by an objectionable child, but…
"Come on, you pair!" Jackie called, waving them after where she strode ahead. With her loud outfit of long, striped socks, her patchwork jacket, and hair dyed a startling silver, she stood out like a beacon. "I have a potential girlfriend to woo with my dastardly charms."
"A ballpark would be good enough. Just a vague direction so we can work out it we need to do a Lunar Analysis for the higher-grade potions and have to time it, or…"
They ate in relative quietness, Draco wordlessly handing Harry a bowl of fruit even if his questioning, "That's all?" was very pointed. Harry only shrugged; it wasn't the time to discuss such things, nor to attempt to convince Draco as he did Hermione and just about everyone else that a strict diet it was all a part and parcel of his job. It wasn't worth it, and Harry was too sated to want to start an argument about it. Draco, apparently, was of the same mind.
With her wand out, she strode towards him with a sharp flick of her wrist but no audible spell. The slice on Harry's arm, crusted and hot to the touch, knitted itself into a patchy, half-healed scar.
Harry faltered, glanced towards Draco, then frowned as he was met with Draco's frown directed pointedly at Blaise. "Right," Harry said slowly. He eyed their stare-off for a moment before giving himself a mental shake. "This is Jackie," he elbowed her again, "and Jill. I didn't realise another person would be coming along –"
, Harry thought to himself not for the first time before quickly smothering the thought. "You said you'll check out the library near where your parents live, right?"
There was the good to come, but for the time being Draco had to weather the bad. He understood that, and saw that similar weathering in the agency that Harry had stood by since he'd first been discovered.
Harry blinked slowly, not quite shaken from his distraction. "I do. It's peaceful, and somehow clean. And private, even if probably millions of people have seen it before." He shrugged slightly. "Maybe I'm just an amateur when it comes to this kind of thing, though, so it's hitting me a bit more than it should."
Sighing, Lily let herself fall sideways, slumping onto James' shoulder. His head rocked against hers, cheek atop her crown, and for a moment Lily felt the weight of the day seep from her shoulders. She closed her eyes, massaged the frown from her forehead with her fingers, and bathed in the simple quiet of their living room, the crackle of the fireplace the only disruption.
The bell sounded, echoing through the library, as Jackie had just begun to drill Jill about everything she knew. Jill, being the kind of person that she was, replied as vaguely as anyone could possibly manage without invoking Jackie's wrath.
Harry smothered a snort, diving back into his book. Maybe they were just religious. Or maybe they had another stigma against the subject that they didn't feel inclined to share. Harry didn't know, and he was finding that he cared less and less as their shared afternoons progressed. Draco might be good-looking, and he might have perfect eyebrows, and he might be wonderfully tall and have perfect hair that Harry could never manage – but Harry didn't care. Not really.
"… time do you finish up today?" Ipetsky was saying, his hand rising to rest comfortably on Harry's shoulder heavily enough to jostle him.
How Gertrude had swept him into her clutches at all was a situation that Harry still wasn't quite sure he knew the nature of. In one moment, he'd been deliberately withdrawing from her and the offer she'd presented, but in the next, it was as though the world had been tipped on its head. He was joining her in her car. He was travelling alongside her to an unremarkable building in upper-middle class London that she only called
Pansy peered to where he pointed once more. She nodded slightly. "He's the best of a bad bunch, it seems."
The pleasure, that unique kind of closeness, and what it could achieve – he'd never had thought it could be like that.
"Where are you glasses, by the way," she said, turning away from him with the stolen Hobnobs in hand.
Draco swallowed. That knot in his belly tightened sickeningly, but he couldn't deny what it meant. "Yes. Somehow. Impossibly."
Stepping towards Malfoy, Harry sidled into the narrow space between his stool and the desk and, almost before he realised he was doing it, perched on the edge of Malfoy's knees. Wrapping a hand around the microscope, he leaned over the lens and peered through, stalwartly ignoring Draco's rigid silence behind him.
He still wasn't scowling, still wasn't sneering, and Harry supposed that was a good thing. It certainly made it easier to continue with the tentative hope that Draco wouldn't take his words too personally. "I've never really had much time for people like you," he said.
came in it was impossible to miss her. Thin and gaunt as she was, she filled the room for the brief moments she appeared.
That thought itself was enchanting. Stunning, even. Perfection was what Draco had strived for so long to attain in every area he applied himself, something he hadn't thought possible to reach. Now, in a turn that hadn't even been initiated by himself but by Pansy, he seemed to have stumbled across the closest thing to it.
Still no reply. Draco glared at the empty space Pansy had left as though staring long enough and hard enough might bring her back so he could properly murder her. He'd manage it easily, too, with the cold anger that Harry felt all but radiating from him. Draco was always been volatile, always ready with snapping retorts and sneering rebuttals – or he had been, years ago. But this was something else. This was foreign, and Harry couldn't help but shrink away from it slightly.
alongside every fitting, correspondence with editors, and meeting with the coordinators, the pre-interview session was to be held in private quarters. Dot had managed to instate her demands in that much, at least.
Ron snorted. Head hanging, he gave it an almost mocking shake. "No way." Ron peered up at Harry with just his eyes. "Have you been disappearing to 'study' with him, then?"
His anger wasn't quite gone, Harry knew. As Draco settled himself in the seat across from him, as they spoke of idle superficialities and casual mentions of what wasn't truly important, Harry watched him and couldn't help but see the damage that had been inflicted. It was muffled slightly by the darkness, but not masked completely.
Silence. Silence uninterrupted by the footsteps of Clementine's workers, or the crunch of stones beneath models' heels, or the bubble of chatter that passed between them. Silence except for the sound of Draco's breathing. The sound of his heartbeat in his ears. The sound of his internal cursing with the questioned why,
Draco stared at him for a silent moment. Then he shook himself as though to clear it. "I wanted to talk to you," he said.
Draco was watching him with a smirk that was more like a smile, his pale face cast aglow by his own magic. He wasn't even looking at his conjured hippogriff but instead watched Harry intently as though he were the fascinating one.
"You mean besides acquiring fashion sense? And a haircut? And finally realising that your glasses were an abomination?"
Malfoy frowned a little himself. He glanced back to the microscope, shifted slightly in his seat, then raised his hand in that fluttering, disregarding wave Harry had seen from him before. It was characteristic enough of his old prat-ish self that Harry had to bite back a smirk.
Right then, abusing the likely disgruntled Malfoy to the best of his incapacitated ability, Harry was more than happy to stay put. He was… surprisingly comfortable. Almost comfortable enough to sleep. Curling in upon himself, legs unconsciously tucking, Harry decided that was a very good idea.
Draco's lips thinned. He did that, Harry had noticed. It always seemed to happen when he was angry, or disapproving, or not quite satisfied with how a shot had turned out. Harry had seen it a number of times when he'd caught sight of Draco studying his prints spread on the table alongside the dressing room, bowing over them with hands steepled on either side of the spread and utterly focused.
At any other time, Harry might have taken her up on the suggestion. He and Jackie had always baited one another when it came to open acts of rebellion, both in school and out. But her words niggled at the back of his mind.
But that wasn't as bad as the disaster that arose when the prying attempts of an interviewer had discovered that he and Ginny were no longer dating. "We're still definitely friends, and maybe we could have been something more if we'd tried, but… we're headed in different directions. And Ginny has a career ahead of her, so –"
Draco hardly noticed when Ipetsky lurched into motion. He barely heard the sharp, spitting, "shit. Dammit, Malfoy, you – you didn't –" before stuttering into growling curses. He was hardly even aware of the moment that Ipesky snatched his wand from his jeans and, swinging in a wild turn with barely more than a glance towards Harry and a frustrated groan, disappeared in a crack of Apparition.
In the warm company of his two best friends, though, he could hide those fears. He could admit that he was sad but also excited. That he would definitely be returning and no, Jackie was not abruptly entitled to all of his belongings. He almost believed himself, too.
"No," Dot said immediately. She folded the papers together and clasped them firmly between both hands. "No, you did well today."
when he'd become something so much bigger than the small agency. He didn't have to look any further than Dot.
Harry wasn't looking at him. He stood, straight and unmoving, at the end of the alley, his wand jutting from the mouth of an overlong sleeve that swallowed his hand as though pointing accusingly towards the ground. Between his glasses, the hood drawn up around his face, and the scarf muffling his neck despite it surely being warm enough to discard both, he was almost entirely Other to the person he'd presented in the interview, the picturesque version of himself that he offered to the world.
It was only when, replacing another magazine back upon its perch and ignoring the watchful gaze of the newsstand attendant, Draco caught a glimpse of his wristwatch and paused in reaching for another. Cursing beneath his breath, he spared one final glance for the knowledge, the titbits, the tiny morsels of information in text format that he'd been bereft for so long, before turning away. He shook his head at his longing foolishness, though couldn't deny the truth; Draco had become something of a miser when it came to news stories. He was almost as bad as Pansy.
"You're hilarious," Draco said, rising to his feet, but he otherwise disregarded the teasing. Or at least he did but to smile with the irrepressible urge he often found himself caving beneath so often when it came to Harry these days. Draco slung the camera bag over his shoulder, casting a quick glance around the scattering of crewmen who had already started to make their way up the hill after the models. The supervisor on sight – Ana, he recalled her name was – raised her hand and her voice to him indicatively, suggesting they leave to 'escape the cold' that had admittedly fallen with the encroaching evening, and Draco nodded obligingly.
It was before that, in Diagon Alley, when Draco had been in Madam Malkin's being fitted for his robe. The frustratingly necessary fitting had been interrupted by a boy in oversized, patchy clothes, alone and peering into the shop with wide eyes and a mixture of fascination and wariness. That Harry had been nervous. He'd been tentative, if brave enough to step forward, even alone as he was. He'd been skinny and pale, and had breathed of the independence that Draco had only been able to recognise because he'd seen just such an attitude in his friend Blaise.
A strangled whimper spilled from Harry's mouth before he could stop himself. If he could stop himself. If he'd wanted to. He didn't know if he could, couldn't think, and could only stare down at Draco with blurring eyes. His wavering hand unerringly reached for Draco's head, his legs trembled, and the thick, heavy waves of pleasure radiating from his groin with every slide of Draco's tongue, every stroke of his lips, his hand, was almost too much to bear. It was all Harry could do to withhold the urge to buck his hips, chasing the pleasure, and force himself to suffer the ecstasy of Draco's ministrations.
"It's bound to be long term, because 'initial collection'?" Pansy snorted. "Picard knows that when the world gets a taste of him they'll want more. There's bound to be another, if not more still, and definitely one absent of all the necessary tiptoeing around magic that the Muggle version will have. More than that, you're the one who'll be doing the shots. It will put you out in the open. You'll be snatched up instantly."
"Then why?" Harry snapped his gaze sidelong, a grasping motion as though seeking to latch onto something tangible, a glance entirely different to his prior wistful staring upon the lack. Desperate, and frustrated, and searching for some explanation that Draco wasn't providing. "Then why didn't you just tell me? Draco, if you tell me, I would give it to you. You just have to ask."
Nonetheless, it still left him squirming in his seat. Shifting, Harry clasped his hands in his lap, then unclasped them and grasped his knees instead. "Um."
Harry smiled as James fumbled through unnecessary gratitude and platitudes, assurances that "yes, dear, you're wonderful" and "yes, I'm a terrible influence". Shaking his head, he tugged the last knot of his laces and straightened, slinging his bag from its seat beside the doorway as he did so.
"If you'll follow me this way, then," Clementine said, breaking into his thoughts. "Despite any inclinations we might share for talking the morning away, time waits for no witch."
Dot nodded her acceptance before shooing him and Draco both towards the door. "Off with you, then. And make sure you see Von on your way out. He'll be a menace to be in the same building with for the rest of the day if he hears you stopped by and didn't see him."
was quite literally buzzing with activity. Whether it was the lunch hour or simply that the size of the company exceeded most that Draco had previously dealt with, he didn't know. Or maybe it was because it was one of the few that juggled the fragile Wizard-Muggle overlap without infringing upon legalities. Even as a new company, they were rapidly becoming famous for it.
"Could you just get over it already?" Harry muttered, more to himself than to Jackie and too quiet to be properly heard over the exchange between Jill and the Hogwarts students.
The shift didn't go unnoticed. Glancing back towards Jacob and his friends, Harry saw Keith take an unconscious step backwards. Bruce shifted between his feet, eyeing each of the Hogwarts students in turn. Even Jacob, always so full of hot air, was shunted from from his posturing. He stared at Draco unblinkingly, and though his sneer was still fixed, it appeared more affixed by a change in the wind than for with actual ferocity. His audible swallow only enhanced the effects.
Magic. Real magic, as Draco called it. The kind that was in books, and people that followed Wiccan lore adhered to – or at least that was what Harry assumed he referred to. Not sleight of hand at all, but something supernatural. When Harry considered it like that, he found himself a little disappointed, and not only because Draco would be too.
It was so like Dot. Efficient, more than capable of setting aside any personal feelings for the most pressing matters. Harry had mentioned nearly three weeks before in a sporadic phone call that he and Draco were considering making their way home, but it had been far from definite. Yet despite that spontaneity, Dot had risen to the play as she always did.
"I know it's not unexpected." Harry pressed his fingers into his other eye, and it helped a little, but they still stung. "I mean, no one with a grain of awareness can really overlook that a good chunk of photographers and stylists sleep with their models, but…"
Draco glanced between them with only his eyes. There was something going on here. Something that Draco wasn't partial to. He was about to ask, to demand an answer for ignorance, but Picard turned sharply towards him a moment later.
Kerry ducked her head in for a moment, spared a short hello, before disappearing. Garrett stood so long in the doorway on his phone that Ursula had to nudge him into motion when she attempted to enter the room herself. The sound of doors closing, the fridge opening and shutting, a burst of talkback radio before whatever office it came from was silence by a closed door – it all flowed around Harry at an increasingly upbeat pace that, if not necessarily enthusiastic, certainly breathed efficiency.
For a moment, Harry swayed. His head took a dizzying turn. When was the last time he'd properly stood up? Days? He didn't know. He didn't know a whole lot of things, but some things he was certain of.
"I highly doubt there's trash talk," Lily said. She finally drew her gaze from Harry, though she still seemed a little stunned. "James, control yourself."
Harry would have been content to remain like that for the rest of the morning. More than content; he thought he would have quite liked to, actually. But Draco had work, and Harry wasn't so blinded by his own wants that he would ask Draco to compromise. Not for this.
Everyone laughed at Seamus' stipulations. When Harry spared a smile for Hermione, it was to see her flushed before the sea of entertained attention but similarly amused. On her other side, grinning widely, Ron slung an arm around her shoulders to pull her in an energetic one-armed embrace. It stayed there even as the laughter eased.
Even after a day of shooting that the crew had repeatedly and enthusiastically reminded him would be the last day , Draco was suddenly starkly aware of that fact. Aware, and just as abruptly confronted with the ardent need to know. To understand. To ask properly and to receive a proper answer.
Draco's amused huff brushed against Harry's neck as he leant forward, forehead dropping to rest on Harry's shoulder. "If you're being an asshole and pretending –"
"Boarding school," Harry said shortly. "Get your facts straight before you speak, Jacob, or you sound like even more of an idiot than you are."
"I didn't really mean it to be. Better to be obvious with these kinds of things than to give leeway for misinterpretation."
Leaning into him, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist. He kissed the corner of his mouth briefly before pulling away with a smile. "Thanks. I appreciate it."
Harry's friends clearly weren't comfortable. Not with the prep, the clothes, or the posing. Harry felt the now familiar weight of guilt for that, and he found himself murmuring apologies for their ears alone throughout.
"Jesus, they really are a bunch of bloody poofs," Bruce said, folding his heavy arms across his chest. He jerked a chin at Harry, at Draco, and spat a globule to the floor at his side. "Disgusting. You're infecting them all, Evans."
"Okay then, what about that girl you kissed last Easter? I only found out about it because your mum blabbed. Being embarrassed doesn't mean you shouldn't have told me too."
Harry nodded again. "Good. That's good, then." Taking a slow breath, ignoring that it shook slightly, Harry glanced to the nightstand alongside Draco's bed. "Would you like to cast the charm, or should I?"
For Harry, too. He knew he was changing, if only slightly and slowly. It was nothing deliberate, but there was a distinct sense of recovery to be found in the aftermath of school stress, an affliction that only a year before he would never have seen himself prioritising. For the most part, that took the form of sleep. And where Harry found sleep was, unerringly, with Draco.
But that distinct difference existed. He was certain of that. He just wasn't sure whether what he felt was the reliance of comfort, the tentative compassion towards a tentative friend, or… something else. It was baffling, and was a significant – if far from being the only – reason he'd barely slept a wink in days.
Except that it wasn't private. Not anymore. It was silent, but it wouldn't be for long. The humble detachedness of the cottage that was so removed from the surrounding village of Godric's Hollow was on limited time. Had been on limited time.
But not anymore. Malfoy, it seemed, was trying a little bit too, even if most of that trying took the form of remaining silent where he would have once spluttered with indignation and spat curses. That, and the fact that he 'd mostly likely been as drunk as Harry that first night.
A/N: I know this was a short chapter - sorry - but I have the next one up and posted, so be sure to check it out if you get the chance. Please let me know your thoughts too if you have a second! I love your comments!
Like from Pansy, who had given him a step-by-step, real-time rendition of how she had climbed in the reporting world, because she had somehow realised just how much he needed the little titbits that accompanied her story. Her recruitment and subsequent analysis of applicants was a process that she'd been undertaking for weeks with a very similar response to that she offered the sheaf before her at that moment.
"So long as you can accept the possibility, then I am content," Draco said. Then he straightened, folding his hands upon the table. "This has been most enlightening."
Draco nodded. He agreed with that, too. In any other situation, he would have bucked and denied the truth. But Pansy already knew, and Draco had accepted it. There really was no point denying it.
Instinctively, Harry rubbed his eyes. They always became a little dry after most of a day beneath the clarifying effects of an Optics Charm. He didn't mind, but a reprieve was always appreciated. "If you could."
So Harry sat with Jackie's disgruntlement. He enjoyed his pizza and laughed as Blaise poked fun as Pansy using her knife and fork "like a real Italian". When Jill asked him where they'd been that afternoon, he and Draco replied with a watered down – and non-magical – explanation of exploring a certain outdoor mall across the city. When Draco drew him into murmured conversation about the movie, the mechanics, how there had really been explosions, and if they'd been actual guns, Harry laughed and attempted to explain special effects in a way that felt as watered down as their explanation to Jill had been. Given he knew little enough about filmography, it was a case of the blind leading the blind, but Draco's fascination was worth the attempt.
"They're not listening," Harry said, though he lowered his voice further. "I was wondering, though, if you were maybe free this afternoon?"
in return just as much. His lips parted, mouth opened, and the urge was there but struggling, until –
Familiar bookshelves. Familiar filing cabinets and a familiar desk. Nothing had changed in Harry's absence and least of all the woman sitting behind the desk, a phone pressed to her ear and her hand curled in a death grip around the cord as Harry had long ago noticed she habitually did.
Harry didn't object to that redundancy. He had everything planned out and written meticulously not only at his flat but in Dot's office and likely on the inside of her brain, too. She wouldn't run the risk of him forgetting. "Yeah. I haven't even met the director yet."
"I have no idea," Harry said. "It seems a little redundant to me, and a time waster, especially since we're in sixth form."
Sirius glanced towards James, towards Remus, and Harry's clenched his jaw so hard it hurt. There was no surprise from any of them. Not the kind that Harry would have otherwise expected. "Did you all know about this?"
At that moment, his voice just beginning to slur with drink, Ron was making a different kind of demand. Nudging aside his beer glass, he hitched himself up in his chair a little and plopped his elbows heavily onto the table. He stared at Harry as Harry took another swirl and sip of his vodka, frowning just slightly as though he couldn't understand what Harry had just told him. Likely he really couldn't.
Or he would have been surprised. Tea was very far from his mind at that moment, and Harry had disregarded his own, dropping his hands into his lap. His shoulders curled, hitching further and further with every word Draco uttered. It wasn't because he was sad for the accusations, or that Draco was making them. It was because they were true.
Draco's frown deepened. The feather twirled in agitated spins between his fingers. "I meant something else. Something in particular." His gaze flickered to where Harry knew he'd left his wand, abandoned before him and as melancholically useless as it had been for months. "Are you worrying about the spellwork?"
Malfoy nodded. He was close enough now that Harry could see the faint shadow of a frown on his brow, previously invisible. "Do you?"
's headquarters. The hallways were wide and sleek, the elevator just as much and large enough to avoid more than the occasional brushing of shoulders with other passengers. The prevalence of windows, providing frequent panoramic views of the lake and the township at the bottom of the cliff the hotel-office perched upon, made those hallways seem larger still. Even the dining area – an actual dining area that looked more like a restaurant than a cafeteria – hosted a wall made purely of glass much like the reception several storeys above. It must have been magically insulated, for despite the winter that lightly frosted the windows, the restaurant wasn't cold, but that was the only artificiality about the room. The sight beyond was entirely real.
"Very smooth," Draco whispered in his ear, resettling his arm around Harry's shoulders as though they'd been doing just that for years. It was surprisingly easy to settle beneath.
Jam. Butter. Milk. A napkin, because he wasn't a Neanderthal. Draco was just about to pick up his toast when the first of them came.
"No, you can't," Draco said just as slowly. "You're a Muggle. That you would even consider yourself capable of –"
Harry didn't know why it was closed but he cursed whatever teacher had forgotten to unlock it. He didn't slow in his headlong charge, however, because the sounds of Jacob, of a grumbling shout that sounded far too much like the Bruce's bellowing tone, nipped at his heels. There was little he could do but –
Draco wasn't sure, but whatever it was, it worked. His hands still twitching at the hem of his shirt, he watched as Billy lowered his fist and Harry held onto it for just a moment longer before letting it go. Draco watched as Harry led the way to the door, Billy and his companion followed after him like dogs to heel. He watched and, breathing slowing, his heart still quivering, could only shake his head at the rapid turn of events.
But Ron nodded immediately. "Definitely. She's not into thinking stuff like that. I mean, of all people, can you think of anyone who would be less likely to pick on someone for that kind of stuff?"
Harry stared. Eyes locked on the wand in James' hand, he couldn't look away. Every other thought – of embarrassment, of sex, of pity both for himself and for Draco for being caught in such a compromising situation – faded into negligibility because… because Harry's
Scoffing at himself, Harry closed his eyes. "The ironic part is that sex with Sammy isn't even that great. I mean, if I had to put him on a scale, he wouldn't even be in my top ten…"
"This is a necessity, Harry, not a preference. I need my back to two walls so no one stabs me from behind."
Turning from the owl emporium, they made their slow, wandering way down Diagon Alley. It was still interesting, still exciting and novel enough that Harry enjoyed each new sight that he beheld, but the best part was being with Draco. Walking alongside him. Being so close to him and knowing that, in this instance at least, it was entirely okay. Not even the glimpse into a store stuffed with broomsticks and quidditch gear could quite compare.
Draco sighed as he shook his head, almost but not quite long-sufferingly. He'd done that quite a lot of late, and with increased frequency in their past few meetings when Harry's blatant denials had faded into dawning realisation and dumbfounded awe, which in turn faded to skepticism and avid questioning.
Harry himself wasn't particularly partial to the club atmosphere – or at least to certain aspects of it. The dancing was fine, and he'd even become comfortable with stepping onto the dancefloor when he'd finally learnt what to do with his hands. The conversations privatised by the din and the occasional drink were a bonus, too.
Instead of being any single part of that, it was everything as a whole. Everything about Draco had become such a rock of support, such a pillar of stability, that Harry didn't know what he'd do without him over the weeks and months building up to the NEWTs. Maybe he was leaning on Draco too much. Maybe he was growing to reply upon the consistency of their touches, the comfort of kisses that felt different to those he'd shared with Cho, with Ginny. Maybe Harry should caution himself against sinking too deeply, should look to other outlets for recovery and support just as Madam Pomfrey and the Ministry Healer reps had suggested.
Madame Clementine was a wonderful inspiration. Seeing her work, being in her presence – it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. But that apparently wasn't it. Escaping from England, from the reporters, the paparazzi, and the public, from curious eyes and wagging tongues – it was liberating, wasn't it? But apparently that wasn't it, either.
Weeks felt like such a short time. In his hospital bed, considering the days until he would make the move to Hogwarts – to learn magic as he should have already been doing but also to retreat to the added safety that he supposedly no longer needed – it had felt so far away.
Harry hadn't climbed from his window in a long time. Not since Jackie had fallen when they were kids and his parents – well, they hadn't expressly forbidden him, but they were both made acutely aware that if they were ever caught again there would be hell to pay. As Harry wedged the window open as far as it could go, he briefly ducked back from the blast of cold that immediately struck him before slinging a leg over the sill. He couldn't help but feel a touch of perverse pleasure from the notion that he was going against his parent's will.
"That I do," Pansy said, uncrossing her legs and rising fluidly to her feet. In her impractically high shoes, she was of a height with Draco himself when she clicked her way to his side. "This afternoon is our first meeting with the subject, in fact."
Jill's smile widened as she glanced between them both. "Sure. I'll come. I don't think I'll ask Abel to sniff them out for you, though, if it's all the same."
The room was white, sparse, and only dimly lit, as though the windows were covered. Were there even windows? Harry hoped there were. He hoped enough that he found the energy to roll his head on his pillow, to glance around the room – over the half-open curtains hanging around his bed, the machine that produced the beeping sounds – and paused before he found it.
Gathering himself and what little remained of his senses, Harry pressed a light kiss upon Draco lips. "Um," he began. "Maybe we should…"
Newly cleaned by one of Draco's charms, they dove back into the foot-traffic of Diagon Alley. It was no less exciting, no less wondrous, but Harry found Draco's presence at his side far more distracting than it had been before. He apparently wasn't alone in his distraction either, for when he made a show of peering into the window of the owl shop, his attention was caught more by Draco's reflection watching him than the tawny owl behind the glass.
She continued against what quickly evolved into Hermione being Ron's primary defender. Harry listened, but he barely heard a word of what they said. His phone continued to ring, and ring, and no amount of leg-jiggling and all but crushing his hands between his knees could alleviate the discomfort it elicited.
Harry didn't really know what Draco was referring to. He didn't know, but he didn't ask, instead staring and blinking listlessly. Not quite asleep yet not quite awake. It was an intermediate suspension that sounded good in theory but was really a right pain in the arse, and not of the frostbite kind.
"It enables communication by conjuring the image seen through the mirror's counterpart," Draco explained when Harry had unwrapped it. "It will be useful, I think, for communicating, especially given that I don't use one of those Muggle, ah… what are they called? The things you talk into?"
In spite of himself and the instinctive urge to disagree to anything Weasley-related, Draco found himself commiserating with the sentiment. Even if his commiseration was underscored by a distinct distaste for Ginny herself; there was a whole world of resentment involved when it came to Ginny Weasley that Draco didn't even want to consider resolving, a resentment that had absolutely nothing to do with her family name.
Hermione wasn't managing so well. Harry knew she still took herself to the library far too often for someone who had finished her exams, and he found her still buried in books more often than not. Ron joined her on occasion, but he was spending more time at the quidditch pitch than he'd been able to before. He and Ginny had taken to one another's company with more jovial commitment than Harry had ever seen of them before, and it was such an unexpected delight to witness that he almost wasn't sad when he couldn't bring himself to join them himself. At least not yet.
But by and large, Harry found he actually preferred working in the Muggle world. Here, he wasn't a Saviour. Here, he wasn't hailed as a hero as he had been from before he could remember. Here, whatever skills he possessed and performance he played was solely of his own making.
"That's not exactly the point we're trying to make, Harry," Remus said. "I believe Sirius is simply highlighting the fact that you've been out every night this week, including on Christmas, which is…"
Janice and Peter nodded their immediate agreement, but Harry couldn't help eyeing Hermione sidelong with a touch of surprise. He wouldn't have expected her understanding, at least in this instance. But then, she did have experience, if not directly with modelling, so maybe it shouldn't have been so unexpected.
It was strange that, given Harry had said almost exactly the same thing to him, he felt his hackles rise. Chewing on his straw, he ground a chip into potato mush on his tray. "You mean a Muggle," he said.
It seemed almost silly when he thought about it like that. How could anything, no matter how big, manage to hide parts of his character, traits and habits, likes and dislikes, without his awareness? And yet Harry half hoped it had been an oversight, that he simply hadn't noticed. To think that death had somehow changed him was a scarier thought than he wanted to admit. But then…
He trailed off, eyes flicking to where they'd settled before, and Ron and Hermione both twisted in their seats to follow the line of his gaze. Hermione pursed her lips and Ron frowned, hunching his shoulders slightly as he turned back to Harry.
Shaking his head, he twisted in his seat and scooped up his own book where it had fallen to the floor. Butler's
Daphne bypassed him with a side-eyed glance. Theodore didn't seem to notice him at all. Millicent had already found one of her cats somewhere along the trip from the Hall, and was paying more attention to the fur ball purring in her arms than where she was walking. Only Pansy and Blaise, walking side by side and in muted conversation, remained to take up the rear.
And blood. Blood, everywhere. Pressed against the wall half a room away, Harry couldn't look away from the cot and the bloodbath it held.
Had Harry not already been smiling, he wouldn't have been able to stop himself from doing so. As it was, he felt his smile unfold into a grin. There was something so profoundly wonderful about the meaning behind Draco's words.
Turning sharply on his heel and striding down the busy street, Draco deafened himself to the honking of horns, the revving of engines and the shouts from windows that emitted from the bumper-to-bumper traffic. He wove through pedestrians, dodging around a businessman talking into the palm-sized brick he knew to be a Muggle cell phone, skirted along the edge of a bus stop packed with school children cackling and shouting amongst themselves, and paused alongside the intermittently beeping lights of the crossing. When the luminescent WAIT flickered out, he was nearly barrelled over in the abrupt stampede of crossers.
Ipetsky breathed enthusiasm with his reply, but Draco didn't hear it except to know he spoke. He was far more concerned with staring at Harry's back, at his shoulders, where, barely noticeably, they twitched almost like a flinch. Like a drift towards tension before he caught himself. This was… Something was… The bitterness rising in Draco's throat flooded his mouth, and he had to clench his fists to avoid blurting out something he might regret.
"Right," Harry said. He propped a hand onto the table before him, his chin onto his knuckles, and regarded Draco with a slight frown. "You're really into this kind of stuff, huh?"
He said it so simply. So simply and easily, as though it was the answer to everything, alleviating any possible need for explanation. And, as Harry had seen in recent days – every day since school had let out, for that matter – it practically did.
Harry's lips pursed, his frown deepening as he swished his wand before Draco's face. The scummy feeling of drying blood beneath Draco's nose disappeared with it. "You don't get to justify people acting with cruelty in retaliation for a past wrong. An eye for an eye is just a vicious cycle that never has an ending."
Draco peered down at him, eyeing him with a slight frown even as his hand began a gentle caress through Harry's hair. "Meaning what?"
Draco didn't reply. He didn't shoot him down, or even grunt in acknowledgement. He simply sat and allowed Harry to benefit from his warm proximity. He even left his loosely cradling arms where they were, and Harry found he was nothing if not grateful for the allowance. That it came from Draco, once rival and once prat, didn't seem to matter in the least.
an irritatingly rational voice muttered in his head. Though he shrugged it aside alongside his awkwardness, Harry steeled himself for what was to come and stepped into the lamp light.
"Your, um, your lap." Harry snorted at his own thoughts, then again as he realised he'd actually spoken it aloud. "I think I've lost my feet."
"Good morning, Harry," Pansy said with friendly ease. She flopped her theatrical notepad down upon her vacated chair to cross the remaining distance between them, a picture of all smiles. "I like the shirt."
Harry loved Draco's smile. He loved his perfectly angular, slightly aquiline features that suited him without being too much of a blatant exaggeration. He loved that he held himself so casually and yet so confidently, and that, just for a moment, as Harry stood slightly shielded by him, it felt as though the surrounding crowd faded away. As though Harry's and Draco's friends didn't stand a handful of steps from them, distracted by their own conversation.
was one of the first Muggle-Wizard collaboration companies to step into the modern media industry. There had been others, smaller and less successful, but this was different. This was bigger. This was impressive.
"I mean it. If you're not playing quidditch this year – which is crazy enough as it is – you have to give me at least that."
Hermione and Ron's joint exclamation snapped loudly through the corridor, drowning out the conversation of the sparse students that still wandered past them. Ron, now in possession of Harry's phone, nearly let it slip through his fingers.
Draco didn't say, because to do so would be as good as admitting he had. "Stories can be biased. You'd know just how much if you had any kind of talent in your interviewing skills."
So, in the bleary chill of the winter morning, as murmured exchanges passed between his friends, directions given towards where the car was parked, and promises of catching up at school in a few days were made, Harry stood at Draco's side. He dawdled, if only to spend just a minute or two more in Draco's company. He brushed Draco's shoulder with his own, felt the warmth of his presence, shared many a glance that seemed to speak words of "I'm sorry" and "I wish I'd changed it". The wordless replies – "don't apologise" and "I'm happy to wait" – soothed as much as they ached.
"Mm," Harry hummed, resisting the urge to lean back a little. Hermione's theory was growing more likely by the second. Maybe he was just critically touch-starved.
He hadn't much of a care for his work – it was work, and he was good at it, and it was even sometimes enjoyable in a way – but this time had been just a little different. Harry didn't want it to end.
Hogwarts. Right, that was the name. Mrs Joyce had absentmindedly left just who they would be corresponding with off the board in her minimalistic note. "Sure," Harry said. "Would you like to just wait here or should I…?"
"That would be cool to see," Harry murmured to himself, dropping his gaze to his tea. He'd never been in a darkroom before. Photographer business had always seemed like just that: not his own.
"That you'd actually want to study." He'd shaken his head again. "But then, I guess, I sort of am, too. Maybe Hermione finally managed to infect us with her study bug." He'd said it like a bad thing, but his crooked smile, surfacing even at his own mention of Hermione, appeared as it so often did of late.
She continued, Harry knew, but he stopped listening to her as the bulk of the Hogwarts students drifted passed them. He caught sight Draco at the back with the rest of his green-tied classmates, already looking in his direction, and the warmth that flooded through him all but erased the coldness of the day. He didn't even know what excuse he gave to Ron and Hermione as he darted away from them; it was far more important to simply be
Dimiti's typical smile arose. "Only the best," he said. "I actually learnt to use his frankness as a means of determining whose demands were best to consider."
The ex-Ravenclaws he passed were still playing poker, though half of them looked more intent on sipping their drinks or counting their coins than actually playing. Michael was stretched out across the only route across the room, and Harry nearly tripped over Mandy's foot as he stepped over them both. The ex-Slytherins had somehow managed to obtain and keep the majority of the seats around the fireplace, though a handful of dancers had made their way into the centre of the suite's ring and looked to be trying to pull their reluctant dorm mates to their feet.
Jackie shot the speaker a scowl, then shift her gaze towards another who'd flicked a ball of scrunched paper in her direction. "Oh, really mature, Kurt, you wanker."
The wall had opened. A wall of fused, aged bricks the likes that Harry knew shouldn't budge so easily. But what lay beyond that opening was even more incredible.
Glancing back towards Draco, Harry regarded him for a moment. Whether it was Von's words or those of his friends, or perhaps even the disgruntlement of the Wizarding world and Muggle photographers in response to the announcement, he felt a flicker of curious arise within him. Instead of telling his own story, he'd rather learn what had become of Draco over the years. And Pansy, for that matter; she'd surely paved a colourful path to be able to plant herself as such a distinctive interviewer and reporter.
Harry pursed his lips. He plucked absently at his scarf. Then he muttered a brief "one sec," crossed towards the room that was all but unanimously accepted as the photographer's station.
"Mm…" Harry frowned briefly at a page; there was definitely something worth rereading amidst the flowery language. "A little before eight."
"Harry, I was happy to have you passing out drunk in my lap before you even had the faintest notion of considering caring for me in return," Draco replied, his own hand returning to threading through Harry's hair. "I think I've managed the worst of it."
Draco's voice, a murmur so skewed and muted it was barely words at all, hummed against Harry's shoulder. He glanced down at him, at Draco's face still lax with sleep. "It's nothing," he said, lips brushing over the top of Draco's head in a feather light kiss. "Go back to sleep."
Harry nodded and watched Von's reflection as he skirted around him once more and took himself to a distance. Not far, still in sight as he almost always was at work, but enough to give Harry a moment of relative privacy – or at least as much as could be given in the tight confines of the dressing room.
"Well, we're not working over our holidays," Jackie said, snapping her book closed. "That's not what Christmas is for."
Why Draco felt the need to protest, he didn't know. It could have been that Pansy was right and that it wasn't the life he'd wanted for himself – but then neither had being a Death Eater, or being incarcerated for two years. It could have been because he truly didn't like being incompetent at something and he would have to start from step one if he were to be a photographer – but then, every skill had to be started for the first time once. He chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment, frowning, until –
James worried too, but more than that, he had the potential to be overprotective. And demanding. And he had a strange tendency to 'assert his dominance as the alpha male' as Sirius jokingly called it at times. Harry hadn't quite considered the accuracy of that description until then.
Draco's expression flickered. Harry couldn't quite place just what it was that cast a shadow across it, but he'd seen it frequently of late. He wanted to ask, wanted to know why Draco would almost but not quite frown, why his lips would press together as though fighting the urge to speak when he'd once been the sort of person who never held back. But he didn't. People changed, after all, and Harry knew as well as anyone how tiresome it became being accused of such changes.
James' resigned chuckle was smothered, but leaning against him, Lily felt it nonetheless. "Kill Sirius, not me. He's the one who buys them for him."
As Harry watched Draco, he caught himself staring at the little parts of him he'd noticed but never had the chance to really appreciate. The slight curl of white-blond hair around his ear. The line of his jaw as it tightened slightly when he ducked to position himself properly behind the camera. The clever dancing of his fingers, the easy fluidity of his motions, the way he would thin his lips at the same moment he would ever-so-slightly frown in a show of disapproval that was all he let himself show.
"I don't care," Harry said, and for a second Draco thought he replied to his thoughts. That he 'didn't care' about what he'd realised of Draco. But then he continued with, "About seeing any of it, I mean. I'd rather… I'd rather know, it that's alright with you. If it doesn't bother you too much, I'd rather help."
"Did you by any chance bet on my reaction?" Harry asked, turning to the next page. Yes, he abruptly decided, Troy didn't seem so bad after all. He was quite tall, Harry recalled. And he had good cheekbones.
Harry felt it. He could feel the magic – or at least he thought he could. As Draco waved his wand in an elegant twirl, coils of gossamer gold flowing from its tip, Harry felt his skin prickle and his fingers tingle. He could almost smell it, like the metallic hint of static on the air, and for a moment he revelled in the feeling of what he had only just learnt the nature of. Had he always felt it or was this sixth sense a new phenomenon?
Harry wasn't uninterested in technology. He found it interesting, a curious study, and it was certainly useful. He could appreciate that it was impressive to have somehow modified such things to be able to function in the presence of magic, too, if not quite as enthusiastically as Ron did.
" – but I reckon we've hardly chatted properly for a good while now." Ron shifted, his chair squeaking, and sniffed in the way he did when he became a little awkward. "Look, I know I'm not too great at all the heavy talk and stuff, but I'll give it my best shot."
Pansy blinked. Blaise eyed her sidelong. Harry only spared Blaise himself a momentary glance, focusing upon Pansy. If she knew about Draco's feelings then Blaise most likely did too, but she was the only one Harry was certain knew of his and Draco's arrangement. Their arrangement that hadn't felt quite so strange for a long time but abruptly seemed more than a little absurd – and a little obvious – when Harry viewed it through either hers or Draco's lens.
Only the slight tightening around her eyes signified something close to anger. "The photographer was duly pleased. He's got a foot in the door with a handful of company's so that will do you good. Even better, I overheard that Tyler Olsen approved of you too. He's a designer we want on our side."
Harry flickered a glance down at his salad. A bubble of distaste fizzled in his belly. "And you," he said quietly, "have to cover up your bruises so that people won't see what they don't want to be blamed for."
Pansy's voice called him from his reverie and, with a brief moment to close his eyes, Draco set about gathering the prints. "Yes?"
Harry shrugged. What he knew didn't matter. What was surprising was that Dot had actually complimented him. She was realistic enough to do so when it was true, but occasional enough that it still held an element of unexpectedness. "What's happened?"
"Too right," Jackie muttered. "Always knew your mum and dad were smart people. Thinking on the same page as me and all."
He'd lost his glasses somewhere. He didn't know where, didn't really care. He could see the examiner well enough, though. Enough to recognise her as not one of Those faces. Not one of Those people, the ones who had stood at the end of his wand or behind what feeble protection he could provide. The ones who he should have protected but couldn't. Not a face that he saw at night, pleading with him, or begging, or simply staring.
"Harry couldn't get a big head if he tried," Hermione said over him, though she still grinned widely.
Harry traced his fingers over the glass, leaving snail trail-like smears behind each movement. He didn't speak for a moment, but not because he couldn't. Not because he didn't want to. Somehow, it was easier to admit things to Draco, too. Easier to consider voicing his suspicions, to admit that he wasn't as strong as he'd hoped he was, nor as courageous, or as resilient. That he was pretty sure dying had hurt him in ways more than physical, and that it had shrivelled something more than the Horcrux within him. Was it possible to destroy one's fortitude with little more than a curse that had struck wrong anyway?
"You can have a fiddle around with it if you'd like," he said, holding it out for Hermione's eager fingers. Ron immediately leant over her shoulder to peer at it with narrowed eyes. It was almost as though he'd never seen a phone before.
Harry glanced in the direction of her voice, saw her face only hazily, but didn't slow in his still stumbling entrance. He saw faces turn towards him, pale and exhausted. Parvati. Seamus. Susan. All only vaguely attentive, vaguely curious as they struggled to conjure the energy after a gruelling trial.
"If you'd like," Harry said, brushing the revelation aside with more casualness than he felt. "I still suck at Potions, though."
He would have asked just that, except that Draco's eyes tightened slightly. It was barely noticeable, but something about it… something in his expression seemed somehow pleading.
countless times. "I'm not necessarily disinclined towards Wizarding areas, but they're somewhat disinclined towards me."
Harry smiled. Wide and freeing, he couldn't help himself from all but grinning like a fool. Such simple words, and in the sea of good and bad pick-up lines, open flirtatiousness and exaggerated compliments, they were the most romantic that Harry had ever heard. He gave into the urge to step across the distance between them and, closing his eyes, captured Draco's lips in his own.
"How long does your school get off over the Christmas period?" Draco asked, leaning against the side of the wall with all of the casual, elegant grace Harry knew came so easily to him. Maybe there was something to be said for an aristocratic upbringing; Harry was sure he couldn't make a simple slouch look so classy.
The following transaction to gather sufficient breakfast for a hungry Jackie, a picky Pansy, and the combined efforts of Vince and Greg who seemed capable of consuming a day's worth of food before mid-morning, would have been easily overlooked in favour of revelling in Draco's half embrace if Harry hadn't felt the need to step in. Disaster of sorts almost descended when, dawdling as he and Draco were, he overheard a confused Jackie asking, "what the bloody hell are those?"
"Draco, shut the hell up," Harry said with another sigh. Despite what Harry might think of his questionable past relationships, he didn't really expect Draco to drop the subject. His stubbornness had definitely returned with his confidence, and it would be easier in the long run to simply get the matter sorted. Harry wasn't sure just how seriously damaged Sammy would walk out of any kind of confrontation that might arise, but he'd rather he could still actually walk out of it at all.
Cocking his head, Harry regarded him curiously. "Do you really get as much out of this whole seating arrangement as me? I was sure you were only humouring me for most of it."
"Of course," Harry said easily. "On that note, actually, do you mind if I have a chat to you about something? It'll only take a second, I promise. If you have the time."
The stereotype that models were dumb and oblivious was largely inaccurate, Draco knew. Of course, there were always exceptions; every industry had its share of illiterate and crass fools that begged the question of just how they'd managed to attain the position at all, and the role of a model was far from exempt – and yet it wasn't as overwhelmingly consuming as many assumed. Not in the least.
Hermione kept talking, but Harry was momentarily distracted. Not by Fiona, who nodded and smiled at him as she passed and ducked into the room nearest the elevator. Not by Paul, who muttered a distracted "morning" before stepping onto the returned elevator. It was that, through the midst of scurrying workers, he saw Draco striding towards him.
The prospect of a horse-bird-thing, though? That was a little bit more on the terrifying side. Harry had asked Draco so many questions – about his school, his life, about magic itself – that he almost thought he couldn't be surprised anymore, but daunted? Definitely. Especially when Draco's smile fell into a slight grimace.
Harry snorted again. "Don't let her hear you say that. She's worth at least three given how terrifying she is."
, people hastened as though they were running late. As though every second was precious and they were already pressed for time.
Draco wasn't sure, but the thought triggered another than had been itching at him for the past hours. A naggingly persistent thought that had grown more and more intense throughout Pansy's interview with the sense of wrongness.
He and Draco had rejoined their party on street side only half an hour ago. Darkness had fallen, the temperature seemed to have dropped by about a hundred degrees, and Harry was more than happy to abandon any thoughts of lingering at the Museum of Magical Arts. A night tucked into their hotel was a far more favourable prospect.
"But you, as I did, have the opportunity of utilising the anonymity of the Muggle world to your advantage."
Harry shook his head. He didn't know why, but desperation, had him shaking his head in fervent plea. "Please," he croaked, the word muffled by his fingers still clamped across his mouth. "Please, I –"
Draco gave a tight shrug. "I don't. She's always been good to me, or at least she has been since I've actually been allowed to see her. She's always resented my father, though, blaming him for getting my mother caught up in the wrong side of a war."
"Harry," Ginny turned her face into his temple and planted a wet kiss on his brow, "don't worry. Even if Ron's a massive git, I'll still stick by you. You can still shag Draco."
He shouldn't be there. James shouldn't have been home yet. He'd said he would be late but – why? Why now?
"Just a little while longer," Lily said, shifting and tucking her legs up and under her. "I think I need a bit of a respite."
Draco didn't tell him to put it down. Once upon a time, he might have. Once, the thought of someone touching his things would have raised his hackles and set his teeth on edge. Maybe it still would have if it were anyone else, but this was Harry. Draco was fairly sure that he'd happily share just about anything with Harry, especially when the simple act of holding Draco's camera drew such a contented little smile on his face.
Getting equipped for the few months of magic school that Harry would be attending – a few months only at Hogwarts, as had been decided with the current headmaster, before progressing elsewhere to continue his learning – had made it real and daunting. Flipping through the heavy tomes of his his textbooks that were so thick with jargon that Harry could barely read a sentence without being more confused than when he'd started only added to the effect. Packing his essentials, shipping them off to Hogwarts, and then finally leaving – it had all passed over the span of a day that felt like a matter of minutes.
"I don't love him, if that's what you were thinking. We were friends, maybe still even are a little bit, but I don't…" He heaved another sigh. Propping and elbow onto the table, Harry dropped his forehead into his palm. "I've got myself in a fix and can't get out of it. Not after it's been so long. What am I supposed to do? Tell him no?"
It wasn't for a performance that Harry kissed Draco an instant later. He'd wanted to since he gained enough presence of mind to separate the warmth of Draco's embrace from the thought of Draco himself. He'd wanted to touch him, to taste him, to feel the warm reassurance of Draco's lips that held the same soothing undertones as his closeness, as the coil of his arms around Harry. He just hadn't considered it to be a possibility; not now, and not before a live audience.
"Don't stay up too late," Hermione said, which Harry thought was rather restrained of her. She could rarely find it in herself to hold her tongue at a vague precaution rather than an order or demand – although, in the last few months, she'd been ordering and demanding far less than she once had. Maybe she'd changed in unexpected ways too?
The woman tipped her pointed chin towards the dressing room where Harry and the director still stood smiling and chatting practically in the doorway. "Just because you're working with him doesn't give you the right to get familiar. Keep your distance."
"Hey, poofter's my middle name," Harry said, folding his arms with dramatic affront. "Don't shame me by making that mistake, Kurt. Or are you really as much of an idiot as your poor attempts at bullying suggest? You must be a real moron if it happens literally every other day."
, turning towards him. Rather than reading over Harry's shoulder as he had been moments before, Draco was staring to their left down the road, eyeing a cluster of onlookers that bore frowns and narrowed eyes. Eyes that widened as Harry glanced their way before they crowding inward upon one another, heads ducking and whispering loud enough that Harry swore ducked he could hear from half a street away.
As if it had been waiting for their conversation to reach a natural close, the distant clocktower chimed again. Straining his ears, Harry cocked his head to listen to the chimes. "Shit," he said as they silenced. "It's four already?"
Harry opened his mouth to ask, confusion forming words in his throat, but they faded as he watched Draco's cheeks pale even more than normal. What a Dementor was, Harry didn't know. Why whatever punishment was being dealt was called such a thing was just as unknown. But it was clearly bad, clearly horrifying to Draco, and Harry couldn't bring himself to ask.
The foundations of the building were old, but inside was… different. Not what Harry had anticipated at all, and not in the least because when he'd read about 'a museum' he'd pictured an actual museum. This was anything but.
It was different because he had an agent who wasn't just a manager but a squib, a menace in the modelling industry, a businesswoman of her own right, and the hand that effectively held Harry's assumed reins.
Watching. Just watching. Not with lust or open desire, nor flooded with questions or demands. Not even with the clinical air of a professional eyeing their subject as Harry had seen him regard the models over the previous few days. This was different. This was softer, somehow, almost gentle. Before he'd worked with him on his own shoot, Harry doubted he would have thought it possible for Draco Malfoy to appear so human. Now, he couldn't imagine an expression more suited to him
Harry could have objected, but he didn't. He'd learnt just how much Von's stylistic choices meant to him. It was usually better to simply suck up any discomfort of being cold than risk inducing the physical twitch of discomfort Von couldn't quite manage to hide. Just as it was easier to sit and allow Von to work on his hair again than to protest.
The look Lily and James spared him, pointed and reprimanding, said otherwise. Harry supposed he should have expected it.
" Sirius said from across the room, a growl underlying his words. "There was nothing about escaped Death Eaters to be seen. It wasn't like anyone even knew we'd need the help."
He was still staring as Draco dusted his hands with more refinement than the McDonalds shopfront had likely ever seen and wiped his mouth on a napkin. "That was certainly an experience," he said, finally raising his gaze towards Harry. He quirked an eyebrow. "Are you not going to eat that?"
A hint of warmth pooled in Harry's cheeks, but he ignored it. It wasn't like Malfoy had said anything about it anyway. Once, maybe, he might have ensured that Harry never heard the end of it. Once, he probably would have kicked up a fuss and practically thrown Harry across the room if he'd so much as bumped into him, let alone tripped and fallen into his lap.
Harry pulled a face as Lily finally rose to her feet and rebuffed James' increasingly loud exclamations. "It could have gone worse."
Harry nearly jumped just as he had every other time Draco had done so. He made it seem so natural, so comfortable, as though there was absolutely nothing strange about it in the world. As though, should anyone see them, they wouldn't stare, or sneer, or spit at the thought of two boys holding hands. Once, Harry had thought that Draco might have been one to sneer, but the reality was quite the opposite.
"Shut the fuck up, Jackie," Harry said. He hoped the warmth that swept up his throat into his cheeks was only felt rather than seen.
Crawling on hands and knees, Harry ducked under his bed for one of the storage boxes packed beneath. He flipped open the lid, emptying the contents into a heap on the floor, and extracted the bundle of silken cloth that he always stowed at the very bottom, out of sight and hopefully away from curious eyes. Harry wouldn't have put it past Sirius to rummage through his belongings in an attempt to uncover a secret porn collection or something to tease him with. At that moment, the thought was hated rather than amusing.
Draco stuttered off, the tripping of his tongue suddenly turned shy. Despite what he'd revealed only the evening before, it felt like a whole new ordeal to be repeating himself in the bright light of day. It made it more real, more lasting, and Harry's open attentiveness even more so.
"You've got the face," the woman across the table told him, as though commenting upon the weather. "And you've got the publicity already. That's a step in the right direction that we can use."
Harry didn't recognise either of them, and they were less involved than usual for a shoot, but that wasn't what disconcerted him, either.
"What a way to start." Granger shook her head, turning back to Harry as they began to climb the shallow steps to the second floor. "Sorry about that. I hope you don't think we're all crass."
The future. After. Harry had never considered so far ahead before. Even in his fourth year, when Moody's imposter had first posed the idea of becoming an auror to him, it had only ever been a distant possibility. Something to come. Something to drift towards but not quite to actively pursue just yet.
Harry smothered a snort. It didn't entirely erase his momentary flush of embarrassment, but it helped to instil a little sensibility in him. Shaking his head, he glanced briefly towards Draco. "I've got to take off. See you next week."
"Call Von. Let him know what's going on and keep him updated so he'd not poking his head through my door like a lost puppy every other minute asking if you've called. It's a little bit pathetic."
Harry spared a final glance over his shoulder as Draco turned and drew him through the watching audience. He caught a glimpse of the performance – something to do with, predictably, more theatrical flourishes and a vibrant bouquet – and for just a moment met Jill's eyes where she'd turned towards him. The only one of their friends to notice, she didn't frown at his retreat. She didn't even seem confused. Instead, offering Harry a wink, she leaned towards Blaise to whisper into his ear, pointing at something in the tour guide's vicinity.
"You'll tell me if you're uncomfortable?" he said, a question more than a blatant demand. "You'll tell me if something I ask of you isn't to your liking, or makes you feel discomforted in any way?"
Again, the urge to glance over his shoulder arose, to make sure they weren't being watched, to be sure that no one was glaring and threatening to turn unfavourable stares into aggressive action welled within Harry. Welled – and disappeared almost as quickly with barely more than a swatting thought. How could it possibly linger after Draco said something like that? It took only a second more of contemplation before Harry looped his arm around Draco's waist in return.
Draco scrunched his nose. It was an unexpectedly adorable expression, and Harry couldn't help but nudge the end of his nose himself. It felt entirely natural, entirely perfect, to do so. "I'm fine," Draco said. "I'd rather enjoy myself with you, to be honest."
Harry had only shrugged. No, he supposed Draco probably hadn't told him that he'd picked fights with the so-called Gryffindors, and scolded the younger students in his own role as prefect himself, or that his Head of House favoured the Slytherins and he apparently used that to his advantage. Ron had been the one to tell Harry that.
Draco nearly flinched as he was tugged from his silent staring. Folding his arms slowly, as much to give time to gather himself, he raised an eyebrow that Harry likely didn't see. "Are you gussying up?"
"Yeah, that." Resettling his chin, Harry returned to gazing at the window. Through the window. Beyond that. Idly, he wondered if Draco was sleeping that night, or if he was just as sleepless as Harry found himself. Given his circumstances and how often they'd found one another similarly incapacitated, Harry doubted the former. Definitely when considering the home that Draco would be returning to.
Smiling more to himself than to Draco, Harry nodded and turned back down the street. "Yeah," he murmured. "I liked it." He set off in the direction Draco had led them and Draco followed wordlessly in step.
"Sorry," Harry found himself mumbling, dropping his gaze towards his lap and the crumpled jeans resting in his limp clasp. His eyes stung a little, the spell that let him see without his glasses objecting to its long-term use, but he didn't care. Besides, the stinging… for some reason, Harry didn't think the twinging in his eyes was entirely because of the spell. Sniffing didn't alleviate it in the slightest.
Apparently, he was wrong. Harry wasn't silent. He just chose the moments he spoke, and when he did, it wasn't in a fit of rage but with calculated deliberation.
Draco had already been in a disgruntled mood. Pansy, for all of her taunting and tempting, dangling the potential carrot of her contract with
That chill, sweeping through him and freezing the pit in his belly, was unlike any anger Harry had really felt before. It wasn't of the kind he was still distantly familiar with. It was… it was…
"Yeah. I mean, there's always long days, and sometimes you don't quite click with a photographer, but –"
He didn't blame them. Not the letter-writers, nor the journalists, nor the public that kept their comments and criticisms to themselves. Draco hadn't blamed anyone for their hatred for a long time, for if he did he knew he would be caught up in the endless cycle of blame for a long, long time. It was just as Harry had said all too accurately the second to last time Draco had seen him: it was better to simply move past it.
"What's up?" he asked as they drew along the side of the corridor. He could hardly hear his own words for the noise around them.
Harry gave another slow blink. It was too calm, too collected and detached for the thrumming beat that vibrated through the floor, echoing that pounding in Draco's head. Harry made no motion to take the clothes from Draco's hand where he all but crushed the denim into a bundle.

"You think that just because I'm locked up in a foreign manor the world would forget that my father is in Azkaban?"
Falling prey to the urge to do so, Harry finally raised a hand to the side of Draco's face. He almost expected Draco to pull away from him, to flinch as though repulsed or to frown with a bout of confusion, but he didn't. Instead, his eyes widened, lips parting and breath hissing with a sharp inhalation.
Draco scoffed, a sound remarkably similar to that Pansy had made before she disappeared. He raised his eyes to the ceiling once more. "Of course I do. Why the bloody hell else would I have let you sit in my lap?"
"Honestly," Harry muttered, "it's like she's dropping off a pre-schooler rather than a kid who, by all magical rights, is actually considered an adult."
"Which one do you want?" Jackie asked, dropping her pile of books before picking a pair at random and holding them up. Their covers were faded, the titles ornate in Old English calligraphy. "They both look enthralling."
Ginny rolled her eyes again. "Oh, I'm sure. I'm totally sure they smile like the sun's been given to them whenever anyone –"
Draco knew. Harry wasn't sure quite how he felt about it, but he knew what was necessary. It was… comforting? Comfortable?
"I can't be blamed for not keeping tabs on every item I own," Harry said, juggling his second piece of toast as he shrugged into his backpack. "I'm a teenager. It's my prerogative to be careless and forgetful."
Lifting one perfectly groomed hand, the woman fluttered her fingers in a wave. "Hello, Mr. Potter. You're in the studio a little early."
Draco licked his lips, flinching slightly when he caught the cut. "I know what you're doing," he said, and though his voice was low, Harry could still make it out through the bustle of the crowd and the humming of the traffic. "In your interviews – you're making it all a statement more about your beliefs and morals than about your past."
"Really," Harry said. Shuffling slightly on top of Draco, he adjusted himself so that he could rest his chin upon Draco's chest, his arms still wrapped around him. "So, do you?"
Ron didn't appear to mind. If anything, he only seemed amused, which Harry supposed was a good thing. Hermione was visibly more dubious, but she wasn't denying the suggestion.
"I don't know what your deal is with it," Harry said, "but us 'Muggles' are certainly more capable of magic than you give us credit for."
"Dorothea," Von said from the door, stepping aside like a porter and dutifully closing it behind her as she swept inside.
A spitting sound snapped Draco's attention from where it had drifted. In the middle of the hallway, he slowed in step and glanced sidelong at the man who even then was only just passing him. Narrow-eyed, square-jawed, lip curled. Aggression radiated off him in almost visible ripples.
That got their attention. Ginny immediately straightened, while Hermione only sighed heavily, the slightly pained expression that touched her face whenever mention of makeup was made welling once more. Ron's brief return of colour faded away to paleness and stark freckles once more.
The mattress wasn't particularly soft, not plush and flexible like his bed, but it was miles better than a wooden floor. The pillow, too. He could give or take the smell of antiseptic, the cloying aroma as thick as if a wad of sterile Vaseline was smeared under his nose, and the rhythmic noises, the muted
"But, that I kind of like you, too. A lot, actually. And that it's really, really weird, because it somehow happened before I even realised anything was changing. I'd say that I think you're really smart, and I can't believe I never properly noticed before, or that maybe I just didn't want to admit I noticed. I'd say that it's weird how you've become quieter than you were because you were always so loud, and I'm not sure that I like it, because I think I actually liked it when you talked more. But still, I… I kind of like how we talk more to each other now. In class, and when you, you know, bumped into me the other day and – fuck, I still can't believe you actually apologised, though by now I think I sort of expected it."
The waiter directed them to a single table that, even in the centre of the room, seemed somehow private for the predominance of dark woods and red lantern-borne lighting encompassing it. The clean, sharp smell of spices permeated the air, and despite the sharp contrast to Harry's usual dining experience, he thought it rather suited Draco.
Harry didn't glance over his shoulder at the noise. Not until it approached and stopped at his side. Even then, he only drew his gaze sidelong, a heavy glance weighted with weariness yet unable to sleep.
Draco, shrugging off the momentary solemnity, clicked his tongue. "How long do you think it will take your friends to send a search party out for you?"
"Even if it has been a long time. Even if you feel like you can't get out of it and you can't say no – you're wrong."
"I'll be there in a second," Harry said before disconnecting and shoving his phone into his pocket. Hitching his bag higher onto his shoulder, he broke into a jog through the student car park clogged with those leaving the school parking lot. The crowd of kids waiting for a lift, for the bus, or simply being annoyingly solid barriers for Harry to weave around, thinned slightly as he neared the side street a block from the school.
Harry didn't know whether the fact that she was alone, that she didn't have another person to help her in her endeavours, comforted him or left him feeling worse. Somehow, he thought it might have made her a little less crazy. Somehow, it might have made the thought of escape a little less impossible.
"Because he's such a hunk, am I right, sugar?" Thalia said. At Harry wince, and Calliope flung a barked rebuke at the plump woman, who only clicked her tongue. "Oh, come on. You catch sight of him buck naked in the bathroom –"
Not the colour of it as it struck the dark-robed figure, illuminating it in red as though it was on fire.
For a moment. there was nothing but comfortable silence permeating the room. It was a silence that hadn't always been so easy. It hadn't always been just as precious as exchanged words or gentle kisses. Draco had learned a lot in a single year, however, and the value of comfortable silence was one of them.
He trailed off, but Harry didn't need him to finish the thought. It was self-explanatory enough, because Harry felt the same. The Burrow was the same, but the people in it were irreversibly changed from who they'd been.
Harry closed his eyes. He couldn't even bring himself to look down at his phone where it vibrated against his belly.
It wasn't like this. Nothing like this. Harry hadn't asked for it, wasn't even sure he wanted to hear it, but –
Harry felt his cheeks warm. He loved his parents. He loved Sirius and Remus, too, more than anyone else in the world. But this conversation? Harry had heard Jackie talk about the degree of awkwardness she had been forced through when attempting to explain her sexuality to her parents, but this felt different. Harry wasn't concerned that his parents would have a problem with him dating a boy, especially not with Remus and Sirius as an example themselves, but…
"Exactly my response," Draco said, the top foot of his crossed legs shifting slightly to poke Harry in the knee. "See? I'm not alone in my scepticism."
When he considered it, properly thinking about it, Harry supposed he might. He might like to, even if it felt a little wrong. Wrong to leave, to all but abandon the Wizarding world and his responsibility to it, to disappear and inevitably cause upheaval just as the few times he'd had to lie low in the past years had proved always happened.
Barely a week into the school year, the sixth form students taking Communication and Culture for their A-levels had been pulled aside and informed that the principal of the school had decided to try something new that year. As students clearly already weighted by the stress of their final year and exams, it was apparently deemed a good idea to load even more onto their plates.
"Of course. The British Wizarding community isn't exactly the most heart-warming of places to be at the moment. They'll get their knickers in a knot at the slightest provocation."
Draco made a noise. It was somewhere between a grunt and a squeak, a sound Harry had never heard from him before, and he might have been surprised enough to comment upon it had he not felt so utterly defeated.
James snorted, his frown disappearing as he rolled his eyes. Lily didn't even spare Sirius a glance as she shook her head. "Remus, don't put crazy ideas into his head."
Draco was slightly tense beneath him, but a glance his way found him unconcerned. Sincerely unconcerned, that was, not simply hiding his discomfort behind blank-faced aloofness. It took that glimpse to notice that, by and large, Harry felt the same. Suspended in a state of exhaustion, no longer nauseous and horrified himself, not struggling for breath and fighting the urge to tear his eyes out but wrung dry nonetheless, he didn't really care. He cared even less when Ron's shrug caught his attention again.
"How about you come to my place instead?" Harry asked. He grinned as Draco's second eyebrow snapped up to join the first. He hadn't meant it for any particular reason expressly, but he supposed it might have sounded suggestive. "Mum and Dad are both working till late tonight. You've never been, so I figured… how about it?"
The receptionist nodded expectantly, glancing briefly at the chunky computer at her side before turning to an open planner spread across the desk at the other hand. "Of course," she said. "Ms. Picard will be with you shortly."
Exams were still a handful of weeks away, but his headache was a near-constant companion, the buzzing reminder in his ear that he had this essay to write, that chapter to read, or those notes to go over once more and to complete properly this time. Harry didn't know what he'd do without the support of his surprisingly compassionate professors, or the mutual suffering of his friends.
"Control myself?" James spluttered, colour rising in his cheeks. "My only kid has his first real boyfriend. This is a big deal."
Harry snapped angrily before he could help himself. As soon as the words burst forth, he realised just how confused and frustrated he was. The latter was certainly a feeling he hadn't experienced with such heat of late, but yes, he was frustrated. Really frustrated, and maybe even a little bit pissed off. It wasn't just about their agreement either, or that Draco had swept it aside without question on the basis of his own assumption and expectation.
Taking a sip of his wine, Draco swirled it around his mouth for a moment as he considered. It was a good vintage, rich and layered, the aroma sweet and fruity with a hint of discernible honey. He wondered idly if Pansy would agree it was worth the pounds.
Harry nodded but didn't otherwise reply. As he flicked through chapter four, he noticed absently that it must have been the first time he'd actually smiled when he was studying.
"Get back inside," Von said, half turning his head to glance over his shoulder. "Just leave your bike today."
With a sigh, Pansy took a small step towards him. Though there was only the distant murmur of voices in sidelong rooms, only the suggestion of eavesdroppers, she drew her wand and flicked a quick Muffling Charm around them that hung visibly for a moment before fizzling into transparency. Even then, when she spoke it was in a low voice.
With that, he skirted around the desk, crossed the room, and slipped through one of only two doors in the wall. In the minimalistic refinement of the space, the doors themselves almost invisible in their seamless camouflage with the wall, the man's confident, fluid step fit perfectly. He disappeared in a muted click of the door.
"No, you wouldn't," James snapped, shifting his wand to point at him once more and cursing as Harry moved with him. "You Malfoy's never did understand. It's part of your excuse for everything you did in the war, isn't it?"
Snapping his jaw shut, Harry glared down at the mushed mess he'd made. He couldn't look at Draco after his brief tirade, and not only because he felt more than a little embarrassed. It was the truth, and he worried that, if Draco thought less of him for it, then he would act upon the indignation that would likely arise. Harry didn't want to punch Draco in the face, but he would if he reared like the prat seated atop his high-horse that he'd been when Harry had first met him.
It wasn't posed to anyone in particular, but Hermione was the one who replied. "That's a stupid bet. It's practically assured."
Harry could only shake his head as Jackie powered through their classmates with little care for who she shouldered into. He let himself be tugged along with single-minded intent towards the opposite end of the hall.
"I've never seen him so relaxed," she murmured, so quietly that, had Harry not already been conscious, he doubted it would have bothered him into wakefulness. Pansy shook her head slowly. "Not even before everything that happened."
Harry rolled his eyes. "What the bloody hell does that have to do with the history of magic?" he asked.
"And thirdly," Draco said, raising another finger, "whether a magician or a wizard, you can do magic. The title matters little. Will you show me some of your magic?"
Smiling with as much warmth as he could manage, Harry nodded. "Thanks, Ginny. Everything fine, I swear, but thanks. I'll keep it in mind."
"You too, then, Dean?" Harry asked, glancing towards Dean. He couldn't quite help but tease just a little. "It's Dean, right? Convenient that it's the same model. That makes it so much easier to learn how to use it. I was shit at working it all out, to be honest. Had to ask my uncle to help, which is kind of pathetic."
Harry offered her another tokenistic smile in return. This kind of small talk - he hated it. He'd always hated it, had never seen the need for speaking when there was nothing important or enjoyment to talk about, and that dislike hadn't faded over time as he'd become desensitised to the rest of the frivolous proceedings. If anything, he thought his distaste had grown with frequent exposure. The only difference was that he was more adept at reciprocating in kind.
"It's a valid enough point, I suppose," the blond said. "I've no interest in polishing trophies with Filch tonight."
"What's this?" he asked, glancing up at the calligraphic text written in gold paint above the door. He started slightly as he read it properly. "Is this -?"
"Oh, sod off," Harry said, rolling his eyes. Draco flashed him a grin, however, and he couldn't help but reply in kind. "There's overprotective and then there's obsessive. I don't think Mum knows the difference."
The dining table was a little scratched and scuffed at the edges, despite the heavy, respectable wood of its make. The chair Harry sat in had squeaked slightly when he sat down. The blinds didn't quite fit the window, there was a hint of weathering to the glass, and throughout the conjoined rooms that Harry could see from where he sat were elements of life, of disrepair, of carelessness that seemed to suit the version of Draco that sat across from him.
None of them spoke. None of them moved. The woman wasn't hissing anymore, and Billy didn't raise his fist again. Draco stared fixedly at the closed doors, nowhere near as concerned as he should be, for he didn't care. There were more important things to think about. More fascinating things to occupy his mind.
But Harry didn't have a wand, and he wasn't even sure his own magic, what little he had, would work. That he couldn't use it, that it hadn't already acted for him, was nothing if not undermining of what little confidence in his abilities he'd had. Draco had said he'd Apparated on the day that he'd first been told about real magic. That time, he'd been desperate. So, why couldn't he do it again?
Ron downed drink after drink at Harry's side. Hermione sipped from a bottle and didn't look likely to put it down any time soon. Harry drank, too, and even if he wasn't partial much to drinking – he'd seen too much of what it did to Uncle Vernon to take more than a glass or two on a good day – that evening felt like an exception. Despite the increasingly frequent and increasingly loud laughter, there remained an aura of grief. A twinge of regret. A hint of wistfulness as bodies flopped into the colourful armchairs around the fire, more sprawling upon the grass-green rug, and in the voices that spoke at louder and louder volume either from drunkenness or an attempt to stave off that wistfulness.
Meghan stared at him for a beat before chuckling. "Surprise Dorothea? Good luck with that, Harry. She'll chew you up and spit you out before ever showing it."
Hermione, too. They'd always been leagues apart in personality, with Hermione headstrong and verbally explosive when it came to her opinions and embodying that even more completely as she dove onto the political scene. It didn't matter that they shared a commonality in their realised sexualities; they were too different for there to be much other common ground between them, and with her not-quite-hidden ambivalence for the modelling industry in spite of her open support of Harry…
He cut himself off as he clearly saw Jacob and his friends. It was a little difficult to overlook them when they were stalking towards the table Harry and his own friends were spread around, butting past chairs and tables as though they owned the place. In many ways, Harry suspected that Jacob thought he did. There was something to be said for a senior's unwarranted sense of entitlement.
Jackie rolled her eyes at Pansy, replying with a long-suffering sigh. "The canteen. Food. Hot chocolate. Defrost your skinny butt while I stuff my face with a bacon butty."
"He wouldn't scare that easily." Folding his arms, Draco narrowed his eyes further. "If anything, he'll be just as likely to hex us as shake our hands."
"I consider her more of a bodyguard than a babysitter," Harry said, settling back into his own seat.
"Tell me about it." Ron rolled his eyes, though shot Hermione a fond glance in the same motion. "Though some people probably disagree."
"Jealous, Jackie?" Harry teased, grinning at her rather than succumb to the urge to look at Draco. "Does this mean you're going to actually help me out?"
"Hey Bambi, come take a look at what Sirius brought home from the station. It's hilarious; you should see PJ with it."
"But not this year." Clio supplied from her own picture frame, tapping her chin thoughtfully. She'd chuckled her way through sharing her name with Harry, nothing if not amused by his blank-faced confusion about its vague familiarity. Something about Greek history, she'd said. "You don't dislike him anymore?"
Winter fell upon Potting Point almost too quickly for Harry to shrug into a scarf and jacket. Exposed as it was barely a handful of kilometres from the shoreline, the easterly winds that whipped inland seemed to carry every chill and nipping, biting snap of early frost that managed to muscle its way across the waves.
"Jackie called yesterday," James had said. "I forgot to tell you and you weren't here to take her message. You weren't out with her?"
Harry turned to face him, tucking his other arm under the pillow to join the first as he shuffled onto his side. "Well, I have it on good authority that flowers burn."
Leonard twitched, then took a lunging step forwards, but Jacob who reacted faster. He swept his arm across Leonard, halting him in step, while swinging the other at Harry. In a second, Harry found himself on his toes, Jacob's fist clenching the collar of his shirt and raising him from the ground in an iron-fisted grip. He lost his breath momentarily but not his glare.
Even in sixth year, when Draco had been so entangled by the threat of the Dark Lord, the threat to his family, to himself, he hadn't forgotten. Every class, every time he saw Potter, he couldn't help but wonder. He couldn't help but wish for the 'good old days' when they'd truly been rivals, when he'd hated him as reflection in the years since found he probably hadn't hated quite so deeply. Those moments, their brief bouts of conflict – they were surprisingly calming. An unexpected buoy in the turbulent sea that Draco's life had become.
A/N: This chapter deals pretty heavily with internalised homophobia. If you think this might be triggering for you, please read carefully and skip where necessary. Please.
A slow smile returned to Draco's lips. He cocked his head again, regarding Harry thoughtfully. "Then I suppose I erred. There is, in fact, a good way."
Then she twisted in her seat until she faced Harry directly, effectively shutting out the silenced Hogwarts students. "What did you want to do the project on, Harry?"
"Aristocratic," Hermione corrected him, even as Jackie opened her mouth once more. "You could say they're, ah… upper class?"
The bass boomed behind Draco as Harry was pinned against the wall. The shouts, the echoes, the bellows of laughter dribbled into his ears as the fucking spikey-haired prat latched his lips onto Harry's neck. As he pressed himself against Harry, his hips canting forwards and fingers tightening, and thrust with a solid slap.
It was as much of a welcome as Harry had expected, and he couldn't help but grin. His good-humour felt unshakable that day. "No," he said simply before raising his and Draco's held hand. "Just the one."
Bodies crowded him immediately. Draco didn't like it. The smell of sweat, alcohol, and aftershave was a cloying concoction, and he didn't like that either. Dodging between men, under glasses raised overhead so as not to spill, laughing faces shoved in his own, and more shoulders intent on bumping than he ever wanted to experience, Draco made his way to the bar. Slotting himself in a narrow gap at the counter, he eyed where Harry and Ipetsky sat and talked at a distance, barely perceivable through the people, the darkness, the almost visible blur of the music that bellowed at him.
Pursing his lips once more, Harry lowered his fork to the table. He'd had barely a mouthful, but the thought of eating more clenched his already tightened belly. Modelling was a career he'd pursued and being a model was what he'd become. Harry was proud of that in a way he hadn't thought was possible. And yet, in the face of explaining it all, of turning aside from a life as an Auror where he was fighting, and defending, and standing up for the minority and the victimised…
The past half a week had been extraordinary. Lucerne was a beautiful town, picturesque in a way that London metropolitan couldn't capture nor even pretend to embody in feeble mimicry. It was quieter, more peaceful, more open, and Draco was struck by the ease that had gradually sunk into every muscle and tissue within him at the knowledge that he could step outside of the hotel he stayed at without needing to cast a wary glance over his shoulder.
Draco was fit. He was tall, and lean, and his features were the kind that would cast the perfect shadows before the right angle of a camera. He possessed the kind of aloofness that bespoke entitlement the likes of which Harry might have expected he'd lost to the war, and his sentence, and the ostracism he was likely facing as just about every other ex-Death Eater that hadn't been imprisoned faced. It was just a little captivating to witness, and Harry knew he wasn't removed from being caught like a feeble moth in a spider's web.
Barely aware of his own words now, of the admittance within them that spilled forth so easily in the Room, Harry balled his hands into fists, thudding them softly on the ground at his sides. "He's an outcast, you know. Everyone hates him because of the war, even though he was pardoned, and even though it was more his parents who joined in on the wrong side than him. It's not fair, really, is it? And – and he really is different this year. He's..."
"It's no secret that this job will put you in the limelight. In the favourable limelight, if also an eventuality rather than an immediate reward. Your name will be attached to Parkinson's articles, to say nothing of your photographs, and every single person in the Wizarding world will see them. I can assure you of that much."
Help him. Help him with what? To see more of the truth? To be more honest, or to perhaps laugh at himself, or burst into tears at the impossibility of something he'd only just realised he wanted? "Sure," Harry said ruefully. "Go for it."
Why Draco had asked, he didn't know. In his state, it likely wasn't the wisest of suggestions. But he'd asked, and a tight fist clenched around his chest almost painfully at the agreement in Harry's words. Agreement, not just compliance. That distinction was one that Draco hadn't ever realised he needed.
Draco's eyes were heavy lidded as they too blinked open to peer up at him. Slightly dazed, a little disbelieving, but bright with a light that stretch incomparably beyond what the lamp upon the table could illuminate. Pretty eyes, even little more than a dark, formless gaze that met Harry's own with renewed steadiness.
Harry didn't speak. Not immediately. He barely even seemed to be breathing himself. The passing thought snagged Draco, and he instinctively glanced towards Harry with the irrational thought that he might have somehow stopped breathing altogether.
"I enjoy it," he said. Then, because it was true, "I think I just enjoy being with you and watching you, to be honest. Even if it's from a distance. I think… yeah, I think I've enjoyed that for a while. Even when we were working together."
Harry didn't mind. It didn't bother him. They could think what they liked. If he got riled at every thought that passed through everyone's mind, hackles rising at every dubious eye or sceptical pursing of lips, he wouldn't have the energy to step outside. Once, maybe. Once, it would have pissed him off enough to snatch his wand from his pocket and spin furiously towards anyone who challenged him, demanding recompense or at least retraction of words and thoughts.
Harry laughed. It was as forced as Jackie and Jill's had been, but it felt good. Nice to be able to talk and think – if only mostly think – of something other than the past few days. Over a week, it had been. Harry almost couldn't believe it.
Harry echoed in his head with a mental roll of his eyes. Did he have to sound so bloody pompous? Shaking his head, Harry hooked a thumb under the strap of his bag. "What do you want, Draco?"
Harry didn't bother. It wasn't because he didn't feel indignant too, but Jackie had that covered for the both of them. She usually did, and it was that reason as much as anything that he held his tongue. Stuffing his hands beneath his legs, curling his fingers around the edge of the seat just behind his knees, he waited and sat with the simmering beginnings of anger.
"Of course. I've got to get something out of this experience." She finally unhooked her arm from Harry's neck as she took the final steps towards the Hogwarts students and planted herself before the girl. "Hey. You gonna group with us?"
"Can we make a couple of extra, you reckon?" the sandy-haired boy Harry thought was named Seamus asked. "So we can pull it apart and have a look at its guts or something."
It wasn't even because of what would definitely be threats flung his way, most likely from the Wizarding community but possibly from envious fans of Harry Potter the Muggle model, too. That mattered, but it wasn't unfamiliar to Draco.
WARNING: this chapter contains descriptions of sexually explicit nature. If you don't like that kind of thing, probably best not to read it, at least until the page break.
Draco had seen models. He'd photographed them. He'd directed them into just the right stance, into just the right expression, and had been satisfied enough with countless takes even if they hadn't been perfect. He recognised beauty in features enhanced and streamlined by makeup that could be so subtle as to be all but mistaken for natural as often as screaming in pastel like a flaunting peacock. Draco was used to that.
As one, the entire group lurched into a flurry of motion. Heads snapped towards him, bodies turned and all but stumbled backwards, and wands disappeared up sleeves – but not, Harry noticed, before a number of split-second bursts of magic vanished the phones. Harry couldn't help but find it interesting, and several of many questions he'd pitted to Draco arose. What were the conjured items actual made from? Where did they come from? And, when vanished, did they actually disappear into atomic pieces? Were they just made invisible? Were they transported elsewhere?
"Bitch, then. Crazy bitch." Jackie's breath hissed between her teeth while Jill returned to wrapping her arms around Harry's waist in her gentle, firm hold. "I hope she rots in hell.
"That depends itself upon whether you actually know what you're talking about. I'm not partial to appreciating the regurgitation of flashy headlines."
Pansy scowled. She folded her arms across her chest with a huff. "You don't have to be so oblivious with me. I'm not ignorant of the situation. I can see well enough how you feel."
"Harry's right," Hermione said, interrupting Ron this time with a slight rise of her voice. "That's not fair, Ron. It's not fair to have double standards like that."
Her tone carried just a breath of amusement beneath her innocent inquiry. Draco ignored it to stare at her flatly. "Was it out of kindness or cruelty that you specifically chose a French-inspired restaurant for my first dinner back in Britain?"
"Jackie," he called to where she still ploughed half a dozen steps ahead. "Can you see them at all?"
"And besides, you don't like me. Not really. Let's face it, Draco, even the sex has become a bit lack-lustre these days."
Harry saw recognition register. He saw Jacob's eyes sweep over their heads. He saw him pause briefly on Jackie where she was tucked particularly closely to Pansy as they snickered to one another, then as he stopped on Harry. Instantly, Draco's arm around his shoulder's became intensively heavy. It was all Harry could do to resist shrinking beneath its weight. All he could do to glare at Jacob as Jacob's lip curled.
"I think it's nice," Luna said, drifting from where Harry hadn't even noticed her to Ginny's side. She smiled dopely at Harry. "You suit one another."
"Come out to my conservative Muggle parents?" Harry nodded. He could only commiserate with Hermione; she'd been dragged through the ringer ever since her parents had been retrieved from their brainwashed life in Australia, and it had only grown worse when she'd broken up with Ron who they both seemed to like so much. Worse still when she'd admitted it was largely because she'd realised she had more interest in Ron's sister than she did her ex-boyfriend.
How he stared was calculating. It was considering. But it was also curious, and frowning, and just a little objectionable and… something else. Was there a hint of attraction? Was there such a weight behind the way he paused in his work, straightened briefly, and stared at Harry for an extended pause before urging him to move 'just so', or to reposition himself 'like that'.
"I don't think I'm particularly strong," she would say. "I've just got wonderful people around me to help me when I feel a bit wobbly.
"Draco," Harry grumbled. He didn't want to have that conversation. Not now and possibly not ever. Draco was more open-minded than he'd thought him capable of, but that didn't mean he could identify with the admittedly baseless assumptions and discriminations of non-Wizarding society.
Thankfully, Jackie immediately pulled a face, Pansy an almost identical one a moment later. "Ew," Jackie said. "No. I said no study over the break."
"- I have the right of his paternity." He grinned wolfishly, dropping a hand to PJ's head, who turned adoring eyes towards him. "Best decision you ever made, Bambi."
Draco was different. Even as Harry accepted his own discomfort for being stared at, he couldn't quite stop himself from staring in return. Draco's chest was smooth and as pale as the rest of him, the lines of his abdomen hard, the curve of his arms, his biceps as they flexed each time his hands grasped Harry's legs, drawing his gaze each time. It was a different kind of beautiful again, and Harry didn't need to actively begin stripping Draco's clothes as he'd never properly had the urge to with either Cho or Ginny. It was all there before him, expectant and telling, impossible to ignore.
want it, so why not? He allowed himself to sink into the thick taste, the heat of Simon's hands, and the weight of him as he pressed Harry into the unfamiliar bed to be lost in skin, and warmth, and gasping breath.
Closing his eyes, Harry tipped his head back until it rested upon the edge of the fountain. "My friends hate him, you know. All of them do. I doubt Ron would even try to consider that he's changed, or that he might not be as much of a wanker as everyone says he is. And Hermione? Surely she'd hate me if I said I liked him, what with everything he's said to her."
She redirected instantly without missing a beat. "He likes you," she said. "You heard it today. He does."
Pansy's eyes narrowed again, but it was less a glare and instead more touched with thoughtfulness. "He doesn't care," she said with a touch of surprise, as though at the very notion she voiced was incredible. "You heard him today. He doesn't care what people do to him. Or use him for."
Too fast, too short, and too much regret. If Harry had learnt anything from the night before, it was that he really didn't like the feeling of holding himself back. Not when he didn't need to.
"You said you've worked with this man before?" Draco asked as they stood side-by-side in then refined elevator, accompanied only by calming, neutral music and the flicking of the numbered light above the doors.
"I'll not have this blowing up in our faces," Dot had said only that morning, and not for the first time. "Even Jack and Jill in London and beyond shuns this agency and everyone who's involved for keeping our hands on you rather than letting you go to somewhere with a bigger head on their shoulders. I'll not give them any more fodder."
