“Are you going home for Christmas?”
Draco didn’t interrupt her but continued to watch as she peeled the petals off one by one.
“He should have died.” Harry finished, now also watching the egg twitching ever so slightly.
Barely able to keep himself up, Draco didn’t wander far. A person had the audacity to walk straight into him and entangled, they dropped to the floor. Draco was normally a very composed young man but he was certainly also a rather temperamental one. So, as he usual handled situations where he was caught off guard, he immediately turned to anger. He quickly tried to push himself away from the warm body beneath him. He had barely recognized the red collar coated robe before an angry shout reached his ears.
Luna nodded understandingly. “Yes, I can only imagine how hard it must be to keep your temper while thunderflies are laying eggs on your shoulder.” She said completely serious. “Tell him to scrub with pomegranate seeds next time he takes a shower. It will really help his balance.”
Right now, everything was frightfully quiet. Harry wasn’t sure how long it had been since he sat down on the uncomfortable chair and the giant door to the infirmary had shut close. It was long enough for his ass to lose any kind of sensitivity. He was incredibly worried for his friend. No matter what Jason was suffering from, Harry had a suspicion it was connected to his refusal to be around Zabini.
As the laughing died out naturally, they laid still together, Jason stroking his cheek.
“So, everything is alright?”
“So, after almost three hours the game ended. Their seeker, Hisoku, did a Spiral dive, nearly hitting the ground. He caught the golden snitch and Japan won with only thirty points.”
“Oh hello, Parkinson.” Jason obviously hadn’t expected the girl to hear him. “We are heading for the library. We are doing the assignment for Magic of History.”
Snape would visit every day in between classes and afterwards. Sometimes they would speak but it was rare. Blaise could feel Snape blamed him. Even though he didn’t actually understand how much Snape cared for Jason, it was obvious he mattered a great deal to their head of house. Potter would join as well for an hour every day. He refused to look at Blaise and had nothing to say, but he faithfully sat beside his friend’s bed, hoping to see the smallest sign of recovery.
“I believe there is a reason for wearing glasses, Mr. Potter.”
“QUIETLY.” The murmuring stopped.
An entire two weeks had gone by and each day, Severus stepped inside the little pastry shop ‘Partly cakes’. For some horrible reason, he felt obligated to come back each day from the way Lauris smiled at him every time he came by.
“This will be quite a hazzle for your parents.” He simply reminded him.
“Mr. Melck eaten earlier, when Mr. Potter was sleeping.” The nervous elf informed him.
While Harry wished to tell the truth, he still felt so embarrassed by this ideal and was certain he would start crying again even if he tried. Seeing his inner struggle, the professor interrupted and asked Jason to sit down. Taking a seat next to him, Harry continued to watch his shoes as Snape explained what had happened to him and how he had found Harry sitting in the corridor in the middle of the night.
“France, actually.”
“You should go back to see him. You obviously want to.” Draco let go of his hand.
“Oh Harry, my brave prongs.” Remus consoled him, as the tears finally escaped him. Long wet drops ran over his cheeks and landed on the man’s shoulder, soaking into the dark fabric.
So, Potter had bought something and Draco hadn’t gotten him anything…
“Thank you.”
“Ah yes, good times…” Albus hummed and off they went.
“Sure, Hagrid.” He nodded and stood up to make a cup of tea.
“Well, how did this even happen? You have always hated each other’s guts” Dean tried.
Once again, Mr. Knott sent him on his way;
Harry must have had a worrisome expression on his face, because the teen laid a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“The keeper from Japan broke his arm. The Russian teams’ beater exchanged the quaffle for an incoming bludger and the keeper didn’t see it before it was too late. They paused the game for a few minutes because Japan’s coach was so pissed off, he nearly drew his wand.” Malfoy laughed.
Smiling, Harry tried to plead the man. “Are you sure you couldn’t give it a try? I will pay handsomely. It’s just… it’s the only gift a can think of that he would actually like.”
“I noticed that you seemed incredibly interested in the back Potter’s head this morning.”
Blaise watched the pair for a short minute, before his eyes started getting misty. Draco could only stare as his friend - possibly, his only real friend, - looked ready to cry. The boys had been friends since their parents introduced them for each other at the mere age of four, and only three times had Draco seen the boy cry. Once, when his grandmother died, the time he fell from the tree in the garden and broke his arm and now.
“You’re just different right now…”
Sometimes on rare occasions, Blaise and Melck decided to join them outside. While Draco certainly wasn’t a huge fan of the tall boy, he couldn’t deny how annoyingly nice it was to see Harry at ease around some of his housemates. Too bad, it had to Melck.
“Three Croissant.” Severus coldly told him. At the expecting look he got from the young man, he almost broke the frail pastry in his hands. “Please.”
Pansy thought for a moment, tapping her manicured fingertip against her lip for a second.
Harry wanted so badly to say no, to stay strong and deny Draco the pleasure of once again taking something that was his. But no matter the consequences, he found himself nodding slightly. Draco’s eyes, still slightly glazed from tears, dilated slightly before he leaned down. Harry could only hear his own beating heart and the gentle puff of air from the man he loved, as his lips were gathered.
Jason found the place in his book where he lost it and simply nodded.
The awkward silence was stretching. God, Couldn’t Malfoy just have stayed upstairs with his friends?
The bell-like voice could only belong to one student and Harry quickly finished his toast so he could say hello.
The door behind him closed and he stood alone in a freezing cold room. Without removing his glance from the stonewall, he took a step back. Then another and another, until he hit the other end of the room and slide down to the floor. So many emotions passed through him in just a few seconds. Sadness, betrayal and anger hit his body like a ranging train. So much pain…
He whispered. “Running.”
“So, we’re good?” Potter asked in a tiny voice.
They walked in comfortable silence, by which Harry was uncertain, surprised whom the most.
And so the lesson continued.
Dean looked intensely at him.
“Don’t worry, I know how much Professor Snape value his privacy and certainly his reputation.”
Grimacing slightly, Draco declined. “I think one time outside is more than enough for now.”
“That’s ridiculous.” Draco simply murmured, turning away from his annoying friend.
Barely a second passed before Albus had entered his living room’s fire pit, gently dusting the soot from his purple robe.
“Why would he choose to…” Harry left the heavy words in the air.
How was he supposed to know?
“Sorry to hear that.” Harry couldn’t help but smile.
But either way, thank you to all of you who left kudos and reviews, it meant the world to me.
Laughing at his expense, Jason agreed. “Yes, it is weird how the smallest- or most common things can suddenly shine a whole new light when you are with the one you love.”
The pale hand however, froze midair as Harry slapped away from him. Draco hissed in pain. Harry’s own hand was actually stinging as well, but he ignored it.
HP POV
“Yeah.”
“Well yes. Some of them.” Harry felt himself blush at the mentioning. “I have decided to go out with Malfoy. He asked and I said yes.” He stumbled.
Most of the way to his date’s home, Severus spent the time watching him. Seeing his reaction to different things around them. The children running between them caused a small smile. Every time they passed the painting-selling stalls, he would either wrinkle his nose disapprovingly or slightly nod in acknowledgment. Severus wasn’t sure if he was even aware of his own doings but he found it… somehow adoring.
A strong grip held his arm up, keeping Harry’s body from hitting the floor. Embarrassed as he was, Harry was rather grateful for the rescue.
“No offense Malfoy, but I most certainly do not need your opinion regarding my future career.” Potter retorted, turning his head to the window, clearly wanting to escape from the Slytherins’ staring.
The fight continued but it didn’t really last as long as they had hoped. Getting closer to each other became too easy, since it was impossible to avoid the snowballs at the same time. After two games ending after just six minutes they took a small break, wondering how to make the game last longer.
“I don’t know.” The veela cried against his neck. Harry no longer felt the need to hold back. The tears had finally started falling again and they only become worse when he heard Jason let out a low whine. The animalistic sound tortured his ears but right now the teen needed to be comforted as well for what probably felt like betrayal. For whilst Harry had lost a boyfriend, Jason felt like he hadn’t even known the person whom he was meant to spend the rest of his life with.
Or that.
“Was he sick?”
“No,” Harry slowly ate a cookie. “I think maybe soon, but not right now.”
A strong hand landed on his back. “I know ye’ are, lad. And I know ye’ only wanted him to have some fun.”
This time, he trembled as he took the letter. The Dark Lord had personally written a letter to him. He hadn’t even so much as looked at him since the initiation. A small black waxed shield held the letter together. He firmly held on to it as he bowed and once again took his place. He carefully glanced at his friends seeing both the envy and curiosity shining in their eyes.
“I’m rather sorry, love. I was on my way when I ran into Harry Potter. Have you met?”
“Uh is it that cute guy from Ravenclaw?” Dean asked.
“Well good for her.” Harry sneered. “Then why aren’t you on your honeymoon right now?”
“Draco would like it if you didn’t discuss his life as if he wasn’t here.” Draco sneered, trying to push the woman off him at the same time.
“But also be safe.” His twin ended.
“Seriously? It couldn’t see you?” Malfoy laughed challenging.
While Snape was intelligent enough to realize why Mr. Melck had come to see him, his brain reacted as though in slow-motion. Turning back, he watched the scared teen still sitting at the couch, looking younger than he ever had. Scared of the rejection, as he himself was scared of the truth.
“Nothing,” he smiled innocently as he slipped a few napkins inside it. “I just think I would have remembered you.”
In that second he was almost trampled by two children whom was chasing each other with toy guns.
Laughing awkwardly, Draco mentioned for Harry to start.
“Yes, I suppose I did.” Luna agreed lightly as she unpacked her own school stuff. “But I don’t have a lot of friends in my own year, so I have plenty of time for studying.”
Luna Lovegood was looking quite stunning as her tuftpoofy dress clashed colors in white, blue and oddly yellow. The airheaded girl continued to look towards the ceiling as Neville brought them over.
“Unfortunately, it would do more damage than good. The shell is only as hard as it needs to be for the dragon to come out. If the dragon can’t, he won’t survive out here.”
The dinner passed by quickly as everyone chatted delightfully. Harry had drunk his second glass of wine and decided to stay with water for the remaining time, as he started feeling lightheaded.
“But he could still make it. He is doing fine now.” Harry desperately pleaded to no one. It wasn’t as if the mother would come back to gather him, but it still seemed so unfair. The dragon was perfectly fine, even with the leg. In the saddened moment, Harry rocked the dragon back and forth, playing with him by dancing his fingers in front of him. He would make it, Harry was certain.
Looking at Lupin, Severs hoped for his expression to make Lupin rethink the very dangerous topic of conversation he had chosen. Unfortunately, Lupin had been used to his glares since childhood and they had obviously lost their touch.
Besides, he was pretty sure that Dean was coming to drag him out of the house – since he ditched on the boys, last Friday. Hopefully, he could sneak out of drinking his face off, manage to spend his Saturday being productive and not having to walk around with a major hangover at the same time.
After that, Harry had no way of interrogating Esben, as he was introduced to a whole group of Hufflepuffs.  Soon, Draco came from behind him and snatched him away from the yellow house as he wished to dance again with Harry. After another few drinks, dances and talking with his friends, the couple noticed many of the students fading out of the great hall. Many couples were giggling and holding hands as they escaped their friends.
This time Ron sent Harry a look, hoping to gain some support. Harry ignored it. He didn’t have anything against school, but he certainly wasn’t stupid enough to tell Hermione, that he as well, had no idea.
“How?”
As the other boys around the dorm room woke up and got ready for the day, they slowly made their way to breakfast. This morning the ceiling shone with sunrays. Way to dramatically to be real; Draco thought.
“Malfoy?” Dean asked gaping.
“Okay, Drake, I know you are pissed at Weasley, but you can’t stay in bed the rest of the day.” Careful not to sit on his fuming friend, Blaise sat on the side of the bed. “I’m sure Potter will tell him to apologize. That way it will be more embarrassing for Weasley than for you, right?”
“I never even got to tell him I’m gay….”
“Yeah, I guess.” He sighed dramatically. “I just really wanted to give them today. Oh! Maybe we can go down there now?”
provoked, sir. But I am truly, truly sorry for my behaviour.” Blaise just grabbed his hand harder and gently stroked it.
“Harry, would it be okay if Ron and I joined the game?” Hermione asked carefully. While her voice remained strong, it was rather clear to Harry, that her demeanor revealed the fear of being rejected. Harry still didn’t really want to be around the pair for now, but he couldn’t hold the grudge against his other friends. It wasn’t supposed to become their problem as well. Besides, Draco and he were doing fine now. While the Malfoys had become a sensitive subject to converse about, the two teens had stayed strong.  Deciding quickly, Harry merely nodded in consent and the group left the castle.
“Are you ready for tonight?” She carefully started untangling his locks.
“It’s understandable. You couldn’t possibly understand unless you’ve tried it. You see… the reason for my sudden change wasn’t an emotional response to my father, it was fate. As I introduced myself to Blaise, I had absolutely no idea how my life was starting to change… the day I met Blaise, and I came back home I looked in a mirror and saw my eyes.” He emphasized by pulling his brown curls away from his eyes.
“Hey, easy,” Fred smiled caringly. “Just do what your guts tell you too.”
“Yes. For now, I shall leave it be.” Snape picked up his quill again and pointed it directly at him. “But I swear Mr. Potter, if anyone get even the slightest idea of this discussion I will not hesitate to get you expelled for every single rule you have broken since your arrival to Hogwarts. Am I understood?”
Sitting at the end of the compartment beside the closed door, were Draco’s so called Gorillas. Crabbe and Goyle weren’t useful for much but they were certainly strong and made quite the army when it came down to charging the other houses. Draco didn’t need them for anything besides muscles. He was perfectly capable of having a conversation without the two boys.
“Oh, he was storming towards the library. Didn’t even say ‘hello’.” The Hufflepuff girl shrugged.
Harry tried to find the right words, but his body started to get sweaty. His palms turned clammy and he discreetly tried to wipe them on his pants. How was he supposed to tell the professor about his summer? What should he say? That things hadn’t turned any different from the last sixteen years he had lived with them. How it had only gotten worse, because this time he couldn’t ignore their constant hurtful comments regarding the death of his godfather. That now, because of his death, the Durleys were no longer afraid of hitting him again. The scoldings, the yelling, the constant anger and hateful words, were digging deeper than ever in his chest. Each comment slashed him harder than his uncle’s belt ever could… How the nightmares of him standing utterly alone next to Sirius’ corpse, haunted him every night? How, every time he cried, he had to bit into his bedding to keep from waking up the Durleys?
“Yeah,” Harry hurried to swallow the giant lump of bread with jam. “I’m going to say here with Remus. We are going to celebrate after the feast.”
“Nothing, simply asking.” Harry drank the last of his and sat down his empty cup. “I should probably get going. Thank you, for the talk. And the tea.” Getting up he didn’t bother to wait for an answer but headed for the exit. Opening up the portrait waited for him to get going.
“Fine, explain one thing; Did you ever stop to think, FOR JUST A SECOND, how this would affect me?”
“Malfoy didn’t tell you?”
Quickly letting go, Harry was almost more disappointed than embarrassed. This was the second time they had kissed and both times they had been cut off. The older matron at the end of his bed did not look amused.
Trying to stay focused in the moment, Harry continued to clap at the right time until he was next in line.
“Harry… I cant-“
The fight had continued and in the end, the light had won. Voldemort and him had thrown a single curse at each other, exploding in a shimmer of light. Laying on the floor between Harry and the Headmaster was Voldemort’s pale corpse. He had almost seemed human, lying down so quietly and small. Looking past his horrifying demeanor, Harry had realized he had actually grown taller than the serial killer. Sadly, the war had claimed as many loses for the good side as the evil. They had barely comprehended that they had finally won, when Remus Lupin had informed Harry that his godfather had died.
“I dropped my bag, sir and I was just collecting my things again.” Harry explained. Hoping the ghost wouldn’t actually bother to see Malfoy standing right behind him with all his stuff.
“Couldn’t you just take a Portkey?” Hermione asked.
“How do you know so much about them?” Harry asked distantly.
“Silence, please!” The charm Professor ascended the mountain of books he usually stood on. “Do hurry and place your assignments- Mrs. Granger could you collect- yes, thank you.”
“Understandable my boy, but may I give you a single piece of advice?”
“It was rather tasty.” He refused to handle out compliments as if he had nothing better to do. Unfortunately, it was good enough for the too happy guy and he smiled appraisingly. Then he looked straight at Severus and a finger as suddenly on his cheek. The Slytherin almost flinched at the contact but withheld himself.
Malfoy looked a gaping fish before he had collected his thoughts.
Some students had finished their décor and where spending their time practicing their flight- and lightweight spells. Left was the older students a bit more inclined to practice the harder spells of transfiguration. Looking at the horrible tree decorations, Harry couldn’t help but wonder what Malfoy’s tree looked like. It was probably ornamented by the houseelves. He truly had a hard time imagining Mrs. Malfoy doing such a menial task and almost laughed out loud, at the idea of Mr. Malfoy gathering tinsel with a Santa hat on.
Okay something beside his heart was definitely pounding now. Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from moaning out loud. The blond was now so close to him he could feel his breath on his lips.
Opening up, the Professor gave him a short look before backing up, waiting for him to enter. Nodding his thanks, Harry didn’t break the silence but hurried to sit down in the small couch in front of the fire. The small table in front of him held a tray with a kettle, milk and sugar.
“Do you mind if we try?” He pleaded. “I think it will be good for both of them to talk again. They are clearly avoiding each other.”
“Oh really?” Harry challenged him. Before Draco realized what he was hinting at, he found himself with a chocolate covered nose. The horrifying look on his face was totally worth wasting his precious dessert, and Harry only laughing harder, when Draco used a napkin to wipe it off.
“I wish it could always be like this.” Blaise whispered.
“It’s only the first week and you have already forgotten our schedule?”
Zabini looked up and for a long time to pounder if Harry had any intensions with the newly established proposal. After what felt like an hour, he finally exhaled hard and answered as he turned back to his book.
Suddenly Potter practically jumped up from his seat and ran out the hall. He didn’t look upset, in fact quite the opposite. Draco wondered where on earth, the boy could be heading for so early in the morning.
“I think someone like Professor Snape could use a friend.”
“Surely.” Taking a sip, Esben looked towards the couple. “Well, you see, while my family hasn’t been running in the same circles as the Malfoys’, my father inherited a larger company fund in the recent years. As we started getting invited to gatherings, I only met Draco once on occasion, as a child. I barely remember being introduced and I’m certain he wouldn’t remember me now.”
“I’ve only been here once before.” He explained. “I found it by accident, looking for the haunted house and I took a wrong turn. It wasn’t frozen the last time I was here. A few birds had gathered and was swimming around.”
A painful dark hand clasped around his heart and Harry quickly posed himself before everyone could see how much that bit of information was killing him. Seeing his friend in pain, Jason tried to cheer him up.
Nodding his thanks for the slightly helpful information. He hurried towards the stairs. The fourthyears’ mentioned he was angry. Jason was never angry. Sad, perhaps upset, but decisively angry? That was rather out of character.
“But you like boys, right?”
“Great, Luna.”
He was leaving Australia.
Believing it was time to tell Albus the truth about his youth; Severus took a dep breath before leaning forward, resting his elbows on his knees.
“I could!” Harry tried to defend himself as Malfoy started to seriously laugh. “What do you think I did for the past six years?”
But unfortunately, this was the second Mr. Malfoy noticed Harry’s presence in the room. His eye grew almost comically wide as he pointed his hidden wand cane at him.
“’Morning, Luna.” Catching up to him, they continued towards the staircase together.
“Why? What were they saying?” Harry challenged.
Pouting, Harry and Jason left the private quarters and closed the door.
“YO-“
“Goodbye.” What?
Knott and Harry followed, and they walked in silence. Feeling somewhat off, he thought back to how hard Draco had been trying to become acquainted with his friends and he should have the courtesy to do the same.
“Wasn’t exactly how I wanted it but I guess it’s okay now.” Harry mumbled. “By the way, I’m really sorry about that. If I had known my friends would have told others I wouldn’t have-“
“Oh.” Hermione wasn’t sure what to say. An anger she hadn’t felt since third year bubbled up inside of her. The self-justice of wanting to turn Malfoy into a giant slug, consumed her. Whatever had happened between them, Malfoy had obviously lied to Harry.
“Sorry?” Malfoy’s eyes widened in confusion.
Suddenly a rather annoyed and dark voice interrupted their little moment.
“No, seeker.”
A knock on the bathroom door alarmed him it was time to meet the others at the front entrance. Leaving the dorm room, his friends Michael, Astoria and Ethan stood waiting for him. Astoria was definitely wearing too much make up and not enough clothes but Jason was sure one of her girlfriends would inform her. Jason didn’t especially care what people wore, that was people’s own business. But, he cared that she would be freezing the second she came outside before complaining for an hour until he gave in and gave her his robe.
“No.”
“Yes, Professor?”
Turning around the boy indicated with a hand that he was listening.
“I don’t
As he ate in silence, Harry wondered if Draco was already up as well. Maybe he was opening his presents as they spoke. He couldn’t help the nervous flutter in his stomach as he wished he could see the look on his face when he opened his gift. Would he even like it? Maybe it had been too personal or childish. He certainly hoped it wasn’t and that Draco could see the meaning behind the present as it was intended. Thoughtful and caring. At the same time, Harry was rather disappointed he hadn’t gotten anything from him. Not even a simple greetingscard. Maybe he had forgotten about buying one for him? Or maybe he didn’t want to? Maybe he HAD bought one but after their fight, decided not to send it? Perhaps it had been too soon in their relationship?
Harry choked on a mouthful of cookie and Remus had to pat him on the back, until the last bit of chocolate was gone.
“Yes, yes, come in.” he waved Harry closer. Stepping forward he noticed the man was actually a few inch shorter than him. Getting a better look at the old man, Harry realized he could have been Dumbledore’s brother. While the man had no beard, he had sparkling blue eyes and seemed as overly cheerful as Dumbledore could be from time to time.
Harry suddenly felt awful. He should have handled it calmer. He knew from the beginning that being with the Slytherin was going to be difficult and at the first moment of disagreeing, he had freaked out and left. He should have stayed and asked Draco why he was acting so weird. Maybe they would’ve found a solution for whatever had managed to rattle him. It was true that Draco had really hurt him by calling them casual, but it also now seemed very suspicious. Draco was the one, whom had initiated most of their dates and the times they had kissed in public, so why did he all of a sudden care how people would see them?
Draco had played him like a fool.
Esben shook his head. “Only her mother. My mother spoke to her out of sheer willpower. She was… a rather eccentric woman when it came to her daughters. Always bragging…”
“I accept your apology.”
They walked for a while in comfortable silence. Harry was waiting for Dumbledore to speak, since he had never once asked him to ‘just walk’ with him. Harry knew the headmaster had in his best interest; he just wasn’t so sure Dumbledore actually knew what was best for him anymore.
“So what was this about you and Malfoy? You had a fight, eh?”
Slightly tilting his head, Zabini murmured; “In the bag.”
“I missed you too.” He understood and accepted the apology.
Christmas vacation was approaching slowly and the students were getting into the spirit of Father Christmas. The weather was indeed perfect on this Sunday. The blue sky was slightly covered with clouds but the wind was kind and gently swaying the trees.
“How was your summer, Potter?”
“Merlin, why?” Harry had had about enough.
Still slightly laughing, he thanked him for the present and Draco helped him put it on. As the pendant dangled from around his neck, Harry asked him to keep a secret.
“Oh right, we have one coming up right before the vacation begins.” Harry had completely forgotten.
“Get Snape, now!”
“Congratulations, my boy.” Dumbledore smiled joyfully. “I am very proud of you.” He whispered.
Draco and Jason both almost choked on their drinks to keep from laughing at the horrified expression on Blaise’s face. Harry knew how embarrassed Blaise must have felt and bit his lip from chuckling, hoping to seem like he hadn’t even heard what Luna said.
As Harry went downstairs, Theodore must have noticed him, because he leaned in and whispered something to Draco, before the blond abruptly turned around. Aphrodite must have stolen his lungs because Harry couldn’t breathe. Standing in front of him was the descended of a Greek god. Draco had pulled back his hair as when they were children but this time, the hair didn’t make his look pointy and arrogant but rather distinguished. The silver eyes matched his suit perfectly and Harry almost laughed at the irony when he realized the Slytherin’s suit was almost identical to the one he had declined back in the store.
’ Moron.
missed the Malfoy Manor.
Focusing his veela he flexed out his sharp nails and took a good swing in the bark of an oak tree. Inserting the other hand as well, he climbed up until he could see the teen from above his head. Going from tree branch to tree branch was quite more difficult than he had expected and he thanked Mother Nature for not placing the trees even further apart.
“If you do it and is sincere, then yes, I will.” Harry tried to keep the butterflies from leaving his stomach.
“Potter.”
Their breathing was speeding up as Malfoy looked steadily into his eyes. Neither of them moved for a while, both just getting used to being so close to one another. Malfoy moved his hands from where they had grabbed his arms and gradually moved up over his throat, slowing down to feel his pumping pulse, before gently holding his face in place. Of All the ways Harry had imagined his first kiss with another man, and of all the ways he had imagined kissing Malfoy, quickly, deeply, hungry, gentle, nothing could have prepared him for the spark of pleasure and warmth that hit him.
“Seriously? You drag me into a dark room and tell me to be quiet?!” Harry fumed.
The students quietly hurried off the pitch and Jason looked down at his shoes while Zabini guided him by hand. Harry too felt quite ashamed. It had been really fun to have a make-believe battle, but it was true that the Quidditch field was off limits.  Draco subtly grabbed his hand, and the gang was completely silent for the rest of walk towards the castle.
“Hey Blaise!”
“Alright, alright! Let’s meet in front of the gates at… four, I think.”
“Not really? We just started talking and got to know each other-“
Bringing their lips together again, the lovers fell onto the couch. Draco pushed their pelvis’ together and their tongues danced against each other; tasting the familiar and the missed. Harry tangled his fingers in the blond locks, almost gripping them enough for Draco to wince. But he held himself back, understanding the need for Harry to feel him as well.
Hagrid started to break a few of the fallen beams. “The poor thing got a cold and his sneezing seemed to increase. In the end, I imagine he must have started sneezing real fire. I wasn’t here when it happened. ‘should have known not to leave him alone…”
“You’re right. We should do something else.”
“Erhm thanks.” Harry practically whispered. The Slytherin whom had told them off, only shrug.
He took especially long time around the chest; rubbing the soap and his hands across his nipples a few times. It wasn’t so strange how sensitive his body felt. It had been at least three days since he had had the time to touch himself. Without further thinking, he soaked up his hand and started pinching his nipples playfully. At first gently running his fingertips across them, then actually gripping them, pinching. Gasping he felt the need arose as well as the flesh between his legs. If only it was Draco touching him, right now instead of his own hands.
Hugs? Harry couldn’t help the small smile from spreading across his face. Looking up from his letter he found himself being the center of attention once again, he stuffed the letter into his pocket before getting up to leave.
“Please, wake up Jay…”
“Zabini, did you have a nice summer?” The question was undeniably random, but it was the most neutral question that popped into his head at the moment.
Harry hurried to swing his bag over the shoulder, before following. He had to run slightly, to keep up with the professor. Snape didn’t tell him where they were going, but Harry almost figured that they were heading towards the potions classroom, considering it was his own first class.
“It’s real champagne and thankfully not the sour fake stuff the muggles sometimes hand out at reception.”
Draco swore his heart left his body for a second as someone stepped in behind him.
delicious sound.
“I think we’re gonna’ go to a café or the three broomsticks. Are you coming?”
“Potter?” Blaise almost wished he hadn’t been heard, but Potter looked back over his shoulder.
Stupid Draco…
They were at the floor where Harry was supposed to turn to head for the Gryffindor common room, when Malfoy grabbed his hand stopping him from leaving.
“Let me see!”
As he came to himself, he noticed how Harry was trying not to grind on his softened cock and he was quick to pull a hand around him to stroke the hard boy.
The group went straight to their dorm where they unpacked and showed their presents to one another. Seamus had gotten a new expansion pack for Exploding Snap. They played on the warm oakfloor until the sun began to set and dinner was about to be served. Harry was once again reminded of Draco and searched across the table to find him. As he encountered the recognizable blond hair, he noticed with disappointment that Draco had his back turned to him. Maybe he really didn’t care that he hadn’t seen Harry all Christmas…
Waiting for what felt like hours, he listened for the sound of footsteps towards the entrance. He had even started pacing when the portrait once again opened.
“Not so quick,”
“Mist apologies, sir, but no such cakes in kitchen.” The house elf flattened his ear against his baldhead and his eyes became even bigger as he had to disappoint his only master. Even though the elves in the kitchen knew they had no true master, simply an employee, the elves continued to behave as if they abided the Headmaster’s every wish.
“No.” Harry hurried to say.
This just got interesting.
Apparently, Lauris could see inner struggle and once again lend a hand.
Great! The present was almost done and he would have time to give it to Draco before he had to leave, tomorrow. Looking up, he scouted the Slytherin table but the few blonds he could see wasn’t his. After almost going back and forth three times, he stopped at Blaise, mentally yelling at him to look up.
“Nothing is wrong with her-“ Harry corrected him.
“Have you found anything?” Ron asked.
As some of the others from the standing group asked Colin a question, Harry was left talking to the newly introduced teen beside him. Harry had never been super comfortable talking to strangers alone, but it seemed Esben was a natural speaker. After asking the formalities of house, school and friends, Esben nodded towards the dance floor.
Just as he was about to give up on the small street, a scratched old red sign, caught his eye. The ink from the scribbling was almost completely gone and Harry had to walk very close before he was able to read it.
“The first person from Gryffindor who says Draco’s name will be our candidate. Seems fair.”  Pansy said moving to open the door. She held the door open for Draco and mockingly bowed.
“Quite well, thank you,” She nodded as they headed for the second floor. “Although he has been hit by a rather bad case of deergoe infection.”
“Crazy?”
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. It’s good to be here.” Releasing the younger teen’s hand, the professor went back a bit further, waiting to see the two teams fighting. Lifting his wand, he waited until he had their full attention before sending a red spark flying. At the ‘boom’ of the smaller explosion, the teens started running. Harry’s team ran across each section of the battlefield. Sandra quickly took the ladder towards the roof and Knott went underground to the tunnel. Harry ran and hid behind a tiny wall just able to put him out of sight.
“What?”
“Professor, I’ll still be Jason’s friend. Even with that snobbish ass-“
Thankfully, Harry didn’t give a girlish whine but he was certainly close. Right behind the third row, a small counter stood and behind it, a broad backed old man leaned over it.
“Really?” Hagrid wrinkled his eyebrows in wonderment. “Like what?”
“Nothing. You marry me as is already agreed to, but you
Harry’s hand was lifted, and the tinniest wet kiss was placed on it.
“I really thought he had become better, at least to you. I’m sorry.” Jason whispered.
It was almost comical two see two grown men turn into shy children, as they both looked surprised.
Both Remus and Snape started protesting at the same time, believing – and probably knowing – the atmosphere in the room would turn from cozy to freezing awkward in just a few minutes. Realizing he was agreeing with the Dark Arts Professor, Snape calmed himself enough to ask them to stay. It was incredibly obvious how desperately he wished for the opposite, but Harry appreciated the effort. Sitting down on the couch, he smiled as Remus slowly joined him.
“Jason, I haven’t known you for too long, but it’s very hard to imagine you losing control over ‘nothing’. Now, what I do know is Draco and while I… care for him, I know how snobbish and an outright prat he can be when he wants to.”
Snorting, Severus once again thanked the heavens how wrong Lupin could be.
Back in the common room, he hurried past his friends with just a quick greeting and went into the dorm room. Running through his school supplies, he found his marble pestle and granite mortar. Unsealing the cork, he poured three claws into the small bowl and tried to churn it.
Jason didn’t answer yet. He wasn’t even sure he was heading in the right direction and he didn’t want Blaise to be disappointed in case he was wrong.
“Well, it’s just…erh-“ Couching slightly, he tried again. “These last couple of months together- us being together- has meant the world to me and I just wanted to mention it.”
“Did I do something to upset Parkinson?”
“No, I was just waiting for you to taste it.”
“Veela by blood, but squib. My other father must have been a wizard and released that part of my father, which was able to carry children. I never saw any signs of him affected by the creature-side.”
“Well, Professor Flitwick has allowed me to follow the seventh year curriculum with the rest of the Ravenclaws, since I have already gathered more than enough points for my own.”
“But I knew you were worth waiting for. All the things I couldn’t explain you did to me…. why? I thought you were smart, loyal even with your background you knew right from wrong.”
“Fine.”
“Potter, pass the honey.”
“I suppose.”
“’Can’t believe we have classes at eight tomorrow.” Dean yawned and stretched his arms. Seamus had already gone to bed and was pulling his covers around his legs. Harry had just started to pull off his shirt when a slight tapping began. Seeing something move in the corner of his eye, he noticed a brown owl sitting on their window ceiling. Its yellow eyes stared unblinkingly at him, obviously waiting to be let in. He had barely opened a narrow slit before the owl dropped a note and jumped out of the way to fly back. Harry turned to see if any of the boys had noticed the interaction, but all had gone to bed and closed their drapes.
Ever since he had moved to Hogwarts and been near Blaise approximately on daily basis, his veela genes had increased in both hearing, strength and unfortunately – in the last case for Malfoy – his protective tendencies. Once again, he glanced at himself in the bathroom mirror, examining his eyes. It seemed so unreal to have a new eye color. Even though he had always liked his blue eyes, this new color represented a part of his mate that he would always carry with him no matter where he went. Even if Blaise left him, the color would remain…
Even under the warm glove, Harry could feel the smooth shell pushed against him. The globe was almost too perfect to be of natural causes, Harry awed. Gently, he moved it over and almost pulled back in shock as he felt the weight shifting inside the egg. Slowly he moved his hands. In the last second though, he gasped.
Entering the bathroom the students found it empty. Blaise was the last person to enter and pointed his wand at the door; closed it and locked it with a heavily spell. The second he placed a ‘Silencio’ around them, Pansy shrieked.
Strong hands suddenly grabbed his shoulders and Draco was removed from the golden boy. Goyle’s hands gentle placed him back on his feet and Draco hurried to straighten out his robes. Draco opened his mouth ready for a retort, when a dreadful thought hit him like a lightning.
“Oh, ermh, you just seem really tense around each other and more so than last time you worked here.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Severus got up and cleared the table with a wave of his hand. “Whatever was, is in the past. I found Lauris and I have a son. Nothing else matters now.” He turned away from Lupin, silently asking him to leave.
Harry smiled back and continued to walk as the older boy caught up.
Even though Harry knew now that he had been hit in the head, it seemed rather odd to see a blob of orange in the corner of his eye. Blinking a few times, he tried to get used to the blurry masses.
If some of the Gryffindors had known, surely they would have told him. Parkinson had said that the Slytherins had known forever. That must mean Crabbe and Goyle. Theodore. Certainly Blaise…. Had Jason known? Jason had become an amazing friend. The thought of the entire friendship being part of a twisted game gave Harry another stomachache. This was awful. Burying his head between his legs, he forced himself to take deep breathes as he felt like he was choking again.
Closing the distance between them, Harry sobbed as he was captured. Feeling the wet, yet warmth arms around him, he clung to Draco, simply taking in the scent of the man he loved. Draco moved his arms around him, feeling his back, arms and neck. Simply familiarizing himself again with the body he thought he had lost. They cried silently together, before Draco pulled slightly away. Enough for him to stroke Harry cheeks and whisper;
“I’ll be down there shortly too.” He assured her. “I just have to get a sweater.”
“Seriously?! That’s amazing!” Harry felt instantly excited for his friend yet a tiny bit jealous. Season opening was – beside the finals – the best game of the year. It wasn’t so much because of game itself but because the crowd was incredibly energetic. The spirit through the stadium was apparently always wild. At least that is what Ron had told him. They had only ever been to that one final game back in fourth year but if the opening was even remotely close to that, then Harry could see why everyone would want to be there.
“Yeah he saw you first, I guess.” Hagrid looked slightly disappointed but was obviously relieved the dragon had made it.  As Harry finally got the dragon to keep his claws in his clothes, it ringed its neck trying to mark itself against his neck and cheeks. The yellow eyes paused at his, as Harry gently moved his hands across the warm scales. A calming, almost sad noise escaped the dragon and Harry could feel its small moving chest and a strong heart pumping beneath it.
As Draco leaned down to kiss him, they were both smiling goofily. It continued even when their lips met and it was the most awkward yet wonderful kiss they had shared. Looking at the man he had come to care for so deeply, Harry wondered if he should tell Draco how he felt. It truly seemed like the perfect moment to declare his love for the man. On the other hand, standing between hundreds of students may be putting too much pressure on a person whom only realized it was all right to express their own feelings, a few months ago.
Scowling, Draco went along as they entered the room. Inside, the room had been decorated with Gryffindor-colors. Red walls covered with golden pattern and a roaring fire was kindling nicely with a brown couch in front. At the other end of the room stood a dark mahogany queen-sized bed carved with leaves up around the headboard and the high-ceilinged bedposts.
“See?”
“What did you say?”  Draco asked, practically tripping to leave.
“I was dying.”
“No,” Draco shook his head in denial. “It was the greatest present I’ve gotten in years.” Leaning in he kissed Harry gently on the lips once more before letting go all together.
Snape froze for a moment and Harry wished he had kept his big mouth shut for once. Imagining the amount of points Snape would deduct, he was surprised when the man only looked somewhat amused.
Knocking back the last amount of burning water in his crystal, he got up once more to fill it.
“Are you… alright?”
Draco barely liked talking about his feelings with Harry; discussing his relationship with his ex-fiancé wasn’t exactly his idea of fun.
“He wouldn’t…”
“Professor, I’m sorry for having forced you to come up here in the middle of the night.” Harry began. “I… had a nightmare.”
Hermione and Ron were still his friends but at times like these, Harry was worried they were outgrowing each other. They had been through so much together, walked through fire – literally – but they were becoming adults and were truly starting to find their own paths, instead of just the one of homework and Voldemort related incidents. Perhaps it was for the best Harry kept his distance for the time being. He couldn’t imagine losing his two first friends, especially over something as silly as a date but unfortunately, it seemed to be the only thing they discussed, recently. Giving each other some space, might not be the worst idea; At least for now.
SS POV
“Are you alright?” Harry whispered.
“And he knows of you?”
I have been looking forward so much to write this chapter! I really hope it turns out as great as I hoped.
What?
“Are you going home?”
I will hopefully return sometime with another story. I’ve actually started writing a crossover between Harry Potter and Twilight; Where the main pair will be Draco and Jacob.
A rather annoyed snort ceased his wondering.
“Harry.” For the second time that night, Snape placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. It wouldn’t seem like much but for someone like Harry whom had never felt the loving touch of a parent it was enough to break him. Sobbing like a child, he tried to gather himself.
The group of Slytherins got up almost synchronically and continued their day, heading for the charm classroom on the third floor. They had barely reached a few steps on the staircase before Blaise disappeared from Draco’s side. Looking back Draco witnessed a rather unusual sight, considering how calm and collected his best friend usually was.
“Harry-“
“… Really? Malfoy?”
“I will tell you sometime soon.”
Severus didn’t answer him. It had been such a blow to his pride and his buried emotions when Lupin left. Left him, left them behind. He knew, Merlin, he knew deep down that, Lupin had had as much choice in this as him, but he was still the one who pulled away. In addition, that was enough for Severus to keep a grudge.
“Just promise!” She raised her voice. “If any of the Slytherins found out I would be called a traitor…”
“Jason, Could you have any clue as to why Mr. Potter is sitting here in the middle of the night?”
“I think I found your jumper.” He handed Harry a red sweater with the golden snitch on it, which was hard to tell since it was covered in dustbunnies, right now.
Harry felt a stone dropping into his stomach. Had Malfoy seen them leave together and therefore followed them down here? Had he overheard their conversation? Him, being a Slytherin and even more for being a Malfoy, it was certainly a possibility. Harry knew he had to be causes now.
blood, from a rat or a snake?” he teased.
Ron didn’t seem convinced but given the nature of their relationship right now, he raised no further questions and continued to eat his scrambled eggs. Still feeling slightly hungry, Harry grabbed an apple before leaving. His heart was pumping in excitement and he felt butterflies in his stomach, while he tried not to run out of the hall.
“Indeed. Wither he kept all his emotions hidden after all those years at the orphanage or he simple didn’t feel anything except anger, we will never know.” Dumbledore answered thoughtfully.
“These animals, do you by any chance have a giraffe?” He held out a hand for the rows of stuffed toys.
“I love you.” Jason confessed, gazing deeply into his partner’s eyes. Watching as the emotion passed through them. surprise, fear, wonder, happiness. Never answering him, Blaise slipped off his woolen hat and carded his hands through his soft long hair. Tucking slightly on them he pulled Jason down and held on as their lips met. Firm and tender it seemed Blaise was desperately trying to tell him how he felt through the kiss.
Getting up he opened the door with magic again.
As the group was finally gathered, Ron and Hermione led the group out of the tower and towards the great hall. As they slowly approached the halls surrounding the great hall’s stairway, groups of students appeared more often. This was always how Harry had imagined the parties at a real high school. He couldn’t help but envy Dudley whenever the fat teen would brag about the fun parties they had at Smither’s private school. How he would invite his friends over beforehand, hear loud music, be drinking and laughing.
“Don’t bother. She is simply beside herself today.”
Lauris took a big swing of the red bottle and handed it to him. Severus wasn’t really a huge fan of muggle wine, considering the quality of elfmade, but accepted the outreached alcohol. He took a smaller sip, but it was surprisingly pleasant on his tongue.
“Always glad to help.” Dean mumbled, hidden behind his magazine.
“Merlin, I don’t think I can do it if I know, you know what I´m doing.”
Either way, Harry yelled the first thing that came to mind, in hopes of saving any of them from a very difficult conversation.
Standing outside potion, Harry and his friends were waiting for the clock to turn nine. Snape never let them enter before the stroke of nine. Harry had never once seen Snape fiddle with papers or organizing his ingredients, and he had a feeling the professor wanted it that way. Harry imagined how much Snape hated to be caught off guard, which was probably why he was always prepared and in such strict control of his emotions.
“Is everything okay?” he sounded worried.
On the way out, Harry heard Ron whisper if Hermione was okay, he smiled for himself when he heard the answer; “Yes, finally.”
“Hello, Potter.”
Draco pushed against his ass, the head constantly going past his opening and teasing it.
“Mr. Potter, last summer was a troubling one. Whereas most can rejoice in the defeating of the dark lord, some, including yourself and I, have been left with… difficulties. The Headmaster has been worried of your stay with the Dursleys but has told me not to intervene.”
“When our parents are involved, it is most certainly real, Potter.” She failed to keep from sneering. “But yes, if Draco said ‘no’ then it isn’t going to happen.”
“Nice. Dragon leather?” Malfoy nodded.
Turning back to the concerned couple, he decided just to tell the truth. Keeping his head high he quickly told them what they wanted.
“All right, just a little headache.” He joked. Hermione smiled and laid a hand on his.
“Is it really so horrible?”
“It’s not real blood, love. Just a thin bloodreplacement potion.” Jason explained.
DM POV
“Hey guys, how come you aren’t sitting with the other Slytherins?” Harry asked politely curious.
“Thanks.” He smiled gently at her in the mirror. Once again Harry was reminded how thankful he was to have the bright witch in his life.
“No fair! Malfoy tackled Harry to the floor first, that got to count right?” Seamus, the absolute most competitive teen from Gryffindor, hectically sought Jason out for a ruling.
Harry shook his head. “No it’s for my… boyfriend and he is rather picky.” He grimaced.
His friends looked rather perplexed and seeing Ron was ready to jump to conclusion, Harry hurried and reassured them to go ahead and get to class. They didn’t looked very comforted but slowly turned and went onward.
“Thank you, headmaster,” Snape answered, even though his face looked anything but pleased at the idea of drinking whiskey with an emotional Hagrid. “But I do believe I have other matters to attend before tomorrow.”
“Yes sir, of course.”
He had tried to stay far away from Ron and Hermione and they had certainly not seemed interested in having any sort of contact. At lunch, he ignored the other houses and focused on eating enough for both lunch and the breakfast he had missed. He listened intently on Seamus and Neville’s discussion concerning the house cup. Gryffindor was so far in third place behind Hufflepuff and Slytherin, which most definitely was not okay. As Seamus pointed out, they couldn’t expect the golden trio to win it with extra point this year as there were no more adventures in the castle.
It took a few seconds before Harry realized Snape was waiting for him to answer. The thought of speaking about his godfather, and especially with Snape, gave him a big lump in the throat. Coughing a bit, Harry found his voice.
“If so, then why wait? You had so much time and every opportunity to tell me!”
“What-“
“For what it’s worth, Potter… I’m sorry.”
“This.” Blaise held up their entwined hands. “You seem to think I’ll run away the second you let go.”
Chuckling, Harry nodded. “Yes, and this time, I actually have a dance partner to look forward to.”
“Thanks, Neville.” Harry took the offered piece of clothing and quickly spelled it clean. He pulled it on and gathered the rest of his clothes lying on the bed. The boys got ready as everyone finally found their missing pieces.
Looking back at the cauldron the giant sighed.
“Of course.” Jason shrugged.
“Malfoy definitely said something!“
“You are very welcome.” Lifting their joined hands, he kissed the back of Harry’s. “If you ever find yourself needing another favour, just ask.” He teased.
“Yeah, the hat actually wanted to place me in Slytherin but since I had only met you as a Slytherin so I begged the hat to place me anywhere else.”
Remus looked intensely at him for a second. “Harry, I am a werewolf. We only bite people for two reason. To kill and…”
“Blaise.” Jason used the most serious voice he could.
Opening it, Snape was surprised to see Mr. Melck standing at his doorstep. Stepping aside he nodded for the young man to enter. Normally he would never have allowed a student to just wonder into his private quarters but Mr. Melck had already been there plenty of times now as it seemed too dangerous to let him have his fill of blood in his classroom where any student might feel the need to stop by.
“They are still behind and I’m sorry to interrupt, but Blaise-“ He turned to watch the dark olive-skinned teen look at him with surprise and suspicion. “Have you seen Draco? I haven’t had the chance to say goodbye.”
“Severus.”
As Harry laid back down, he watched the body in the next bed move. Jason was asleep and had apparently been moved since Harry feel asleep. Right now, he was laying on his side with his back turned to Harry.
Chuckling, Harry’s eyes eyes had finally adjusted to the light and he could see Malfoy’s teeth when he spoke. He could see the tiny reflection of light in them. They were way too white and pretty to be natural, but it was truly a nice smile. A more comfortable silence settled over them and however uneasy it had been before, was now slowly being replaced by a more urging one. Harry couldn’t help but realize how close they stood, merely a hand-length from each other. Almost too deliberately slow, Malfoy leaned towards him. Harry, whom had always been horrible at reading people, froze at the idea of kissing him. So far, Malfoy hadn’t initiated anything beside them hanging out and it was possible for future friends to hang out alone, right?
While the décor from fourth year was truly amazing, Hermione had told them that this year would be astonishing. Harry couldn’t wait for all the classes to be over. Draco had smiled at him at breakfast and it had given him butterflies, thinking about them dancing together tonight. Harry had admitted to himself that he was in love with the Slytherin. After everything they had been through and with the astounding change, he had seen in Draco, it was only a matter of time before he would blurt it out. He wasn’t entirely sure if Draco was in the same place as him but it didn’t really matter, right? He would hopefully come to it at some point.
He glanced around the street, getting a quick look at each shop before continuing towards the next. At last, he saw a small shop. Stretching only as far as to make room for one door and a window. Inside the shop, there was a smaller line towards the disk and even though there were two small white tables with matching chairs, most seemed to be heading out after their purchases.
Harry nodded. “Yes, I would have been very disappointed if you had had to expel Jason.”
Then they began exchanging the gift. Harry quickly threw his present to Jason as the older boy caught it and ‘
Kissing Harry quickly, Draco smiled.
Rolling her eyes, Pansy almost looked manic. “We both know Zabini isn’t part of a long line of purebloods. His family has never been… us.”
Merlin, his farther could be so melodramatic sometimes. His mother still sat beside him, gently stroking his hand as her husband continued to pace the floor to particles. Snape had left moments ago, when he realized his father only wanted him here for moral support. As soon as the potion master expressed his knowledge of the relationship, his father dismissed his long-timed friend.
Draco didn’t answer him and for a second Harry was worried Draco was going to pull out. Then he legs were pushed further apart and a the kissing moved downwards. Before Harry couldn’t even guess what he was doing, something warm and velvet soft touched his opening. And again and again, it firmly moved over him pushing against Draco’s fingers. Pushing into his deepest area.
“Well, it happened rather quickly. You see Professor Bjorkfire and I had discussed his retirement at the end of last year, but at that time he was certain he could handle one more year. Unfortunately, his energy has decreased rapidly, and he simply cannot keep up. Therefor I suddenly had to find another teacher this late into the year. Thankfully, Remus had just finished his last mission and was ready to get back to teaching.”
“For trusting me. It means a lot.”
“Harry, when Sirius… died, I was a mess… but in the grieve, I was selfish enough to forget that you too had lost a family member. I should have acted like the adult I believed myself to be and taken better care of you.”
“Yeah, it’s what dragons do to their mothers.”
“Okay…”
Looking at the dragon once more, Harry finally felt the impact of the goodbye. Aodhan purred as Harry hugged him tighter around the neck. He felt the beating pulse against his chest and the roaring pure, vibrating. Hagrid continued to sob beside him, while Harry tried his best to keep the lump in his throat from escaping. He had watched the creature literally through his entire life. How did you say goodbye to that?
“Mr. Malfoy, seize that infernal inappropriate behavior, now!” a shrieking voice sounded.
Remus smiled, truly looking happy.
“Weasel…I happen to…” Malfoy?
“You know why I left. Why… why I had too.” Lupin whispered in a regretting voice. “But I never wanted to-“
Laughing, Jason spotted their fellow Slytherins, standing by the three broomsticks. Discreetly he directed Blaise away from them. As they had passed, Jason also saw Harry standing nearby. He hadn’t seen them but seemed a little dreaded.
“I see.” Was the only response he could give.
“Hi.” A quiet voice sounded from behind them.
Trying to hide a yawn, Draco hurried up the stairs in the dungeon. He was already late for breakfast, since he’d spent most of last night, turning and tossing. His head had left him with hundreds of different thoughts and ideas, all fighting for the right to rule. He kept imagined Harry’s smiling face and the laughter they shared. While the images left him flustered and spiralling, Pansy’s annoying shrill voice kept interrupting.
“Please tell Draco, I’m sorry.”
As most of the Gryffindors now had a free period – except those who had chosen Aritmancy as an elective – Harry decided to go down and visit Hagrid. He hadn’t seen the giant beside in Care of Magical Creatures and even though he hadn’t missed breaking his teeth on cakes, he had truly missed the joyful bearded man.
“’Arry?”
“Harry?” Dean called for him.
Harry turned over slightly in his bed so he could face him.
“Shut it.” He had had enough. Theo shouldn’t believe himself to be on his level. There was only a certain amount of attitude he would withstand.
“Yes Mr. Potter, what of it?” Snape narrowed his eyes.
“Potter, you have to return to your dorm.” He was hauled up but he decisively kept his gaze on the ground. “It is after curfew-“ Harry shook his head, refusing the order. The thought of going out, leaving the last place of safety he had… Merlin he couldn’t do that.
“Harry…” Draco cried. “I know I made a mistake, a huge one, but I can’t give you up like that. I want you in my life-“
“Maybe.” He finally answered the black haired boy. “If possibly I could get Potter alone-“
The spider, while intimidated, set out an angry screech of clicking sounds, extending the salivating white fangs. Aodhan refused to move and simply set out his own roar to keep the animal at bay. Spreading the massive wings, Aodhan stood solidly on the ground while the smaller gushes of wind ruffled the spider’s hairy legs. The beast chose to continue its way towards them in spite of the wind and now apparently the mighty dragon had had enough. Moving slightly over Harry, the dragon pulled in so much air, Harry feared for a second, its chest would crush him.
“-And neither do I.” The werewolf ended. “I’m certain Professor Snape is old enough to know what he wants. So please, go back to your tower and get some rest.”
Shaking his head, Remus drank the last of his tea.
Dumbledore raised a hand asking for silence.
The first trip to Hogsmeade would be taking place that day. It also happened to be the day of Harry’s first official date with Malfoy. He tried his best to concentrate on his breakfast and on the other Gryffindors’ chatting. He weighted in a few times, but it mostly didn’t turn out to be more than a ‘hmm’ or ‘sure’. His stomach was not just filled with butterflies it felt more like a cocoon of bees buzzing and gnawing their way right through him. He didn’t want to seem too eager but he couldn’t help but look at the Slytherin table where Malfoy was also eating. He was slowly chewing a red apple while talking to his friends. It seemed so unfair how relaxed he was while Harry tried not to break out in cold sweat.
“Our paper? History, you know?” Jason hinted gesturing with his arms where they were; the classroom.
Draco couldn’t say he cared much for their social life. Many of their associates had fled the country the second the news of the dark lords falling had reached them. Their Slytherin house would be rather quiet this year, but Draco swore it would remain the strongest. Looking past the window from his side, he was happy to say most of his… friends had made it back. He didn’t care too much except for his one true friend Blaise Zabini, who had convinced his mother to let him back. The olive-skinned boy was sitting right across from him, looking thoughtfully out at the green landscape. Both of them had definitely been around their fair share of women, before realizing it only led annoying girls whom kept trying to worm their way into their bed again.
Harry just gave him an overbearing smile and continued to squeeze his hand.
“I’m surprised you are so calm watching them dance together.”
The rest of the day had passed by quickly and now after dinner, Harry was heading back to the common room, where he would go to bed immediately. He had barely been able to keep from yawning multiple times at dinner.
Saying nothing, Harry simply took in the shocking sight. Right there in his doorway stood the man he loved but whom he hadn’t seen in months. Even with dripping wet hair and tired eyes, Draco still looked as gorgeous as Harry remembered him. Finally tearing away his eyes from the haunting grey ones, he noticed the dripping suit Draco was wearing.
“My word!” Professor McGonnagall gasped as she shifted her gaze from Harry to Aodhan.
“A vampire…” Harry whispered. Jason chuckled.
“You told her I was gay?!”
“Anyway… according to the new rules they are enforcing, all dragons must be kept under ‘natural’ procedures. And since his mother left it in the cold ground nest…” Hagrid murmured.
“You know Harry, most people don’t believe it is a good idea to be dating interhousing but I believe it could work very well between you and Draco.”
Further down the table sat Professor Snape along with the Headmaster on one side and Professor Vector on the other. While both Vector and Snape was known to be more introvert than most of the teachers, the headmaster was certainly jolly enough for all three of them. In the end, it obviously became too much Christmas joy for the potion Professor and he gracefully got up and left with a billowing cloak behind him. Jason watched him as well and only few minutes after, he got up and followed Snape out. Thankfully, the students around them were too busy eating and chatting to even notice, if the two Slytherins had left in a rather suspicious short time after each other.
Crash!
Harry shouldn’t really have been surprised that Dumbledore already knew about his situation. He had always kept a close eye on him and more often than not, been able to hand out great advice. Although he had called his – well whatever it was – with Malfoy a ‘friendship’. And while Harry hadn’t labeled them, he was most certain friends didn’t make out whenever a chance became available.
“I don’t understand.”
He was still quite early, considering none of his friend had arrived for breakfast yet. Perhaps if he hurried, he wouldn’t see them before class therefor wouldn’t be able to answer their impeccable questions. With renewed energy, he buttered his toast, and he poured some juice.
“I don’t suppose you would consider helping our friend here. I don’t think it is quite his time yet.” Dumbledore told the bird.
The annoying disruption continued to be a distraction through charms and Blaise barely got anything done. As soon as the bell rung, Blaise collected his things. Thankfully they wouldn’t have to see the Gryffindors for the rest of the day and even had a free period until the Hufflepuff were ready for Care of Magical Creatures.
On their way there, Lauris asked him all sorts of questions. Some he answered, some he couldn’t and some he simply didn’t wish to talk about. His parents for one. As thy continued to talk it seemed Lauris caught on to his silent domineer but instead of being put off, Lauris simply spoke enough for the both of them.
“Draco, seriously, calm down.” Inside the bathroom he took a quick glance around before pushing his lover inside the back stall.
“When you parents died and I was informed of Sirius betrayal and arrest, I blacked out. Nothing made sense to me as I had suddenly lost three of my reasons to live. My best friend had been arrested and left nothing but emptiness behind.”
“Right,” Hermione gave him another side-glance before pouring herself another cup of tea. “…all the dancing.”
“A night everything changed. The others have never told me what truly happened between us as animals, I will never know, but somehow we ended up fighting and as I tore into Padfoot I must have regained some sort of sanity and remembered they were my friends. I ended up biting Sirius to blood but I didn’t kill him, which as very lucky considering what I was. When I woke up, everything was changed.”
“Alright, now please take a few balls –yes, there is plenty for everyone- and sit down to practice. If you manage to transfigure a nice shape, then by all means hang it on the Christmas trees.” The jolly old man waved a hand towards the gathered trees in the decorated hall.
Suddenly a sorrowful melody called to him and Harry turned towards the forbidden forest. Along the edge of the woods a few thestrals had gathered. Carefully he moved away from the trail to approach them. He carefully stepped forward, making sure not to step on branches or stones. Watching them – there were three – he could see they were eating a smaller animal lying on the ground. The creatures were truly beautiful in a rather morbid way. So many people feared them for their leathery looks and the reputation for death, but if you were ever lucky – or unlucky- enough to see them, you would realize how gentle the creatures were.
“Not you too! This is insane! He is a completely nice block, and he hasn’t done the slightest thing to even raise suspicion.”
“Meeting your mate at such a young age is rather unusual.” Remus agreed.
It was ridiculous.
“Come on, Harry. Open it!” Neville smiled.
“Draco… stop.” Not able to see his boyfriends face, Draco immediately slowed down.
“Hey, Malfoy! You coming?”
Tumbling through the masses, he tried to protect the gift from too much damage as he ran outside. He ran around and passed so many students while he constantly searched for the blond head in between them. His lungs felt on the edge to collapse but somehow he found himself staring at the train station where the giant metal was still puffing smoke. Searching, he couldn’t see Draco anywhere but maybe some of his friends had seen him. Frantically looking around he finally saw a familiar head poking up between multiple of black robes. Jason was thankfully so tall it was impossible to miss him. He squeezed through people and apologized a few times, as he caught up with the Aussie.
When the need for air became too great, Severus slowly pulled back. He swallowed deeply as his obsidian eyes meet the icy blue of his date. He could see so many emotions flying through them. Heat, lust in the dilated pupils. Content from the way he was leaning against him and a tiny amount of sleepiness from the long day at work.
Outside in the frosty air, Harry scooted closer to the taller boy, trying to keep from freezing. A hand snuck around him and laid gently on his hip as they went towards Hagrid’s cabin, in silence. As they approached, the hut they saw Remus, McGonagall, Snape and the headmaster standing a few feet away, while Hagrid stood beside his curious friend. The professors seemed at unease standing so close to a magical creature without their wands ready. Dumbledore on the other hand seemed to be spellbound by the crimson flowers shining under the moonlight, never even bothered by the fact that his back was turned to the dragon.
“You want a picture, Granger? It will last longer if like to watch us make out.” He jested. Hermione simply narrowed her eyes even further and turned her back on them.
“Where are we going?” Harry whispered as Draco placed a hand around his waist.
“Please Sir, before you give me detention, please let me explain.”
Almost jumping up half a mile, Harry turned to see Hagrid standing right behind him. Who knew the giant could walk so soundlessly?  Hagrid must have seen the startled look on his face because he laughed and patted him on the shoulder.
“Jason Melck.”
“I promised your parents I would take care of you if anything were to happen to them and I had mentally prepared myself, in case that awful scenario was ever to happen. But in every scenario I had had Sirius beside me.”
The dungeon was colder than usual, and Harry could see why. As it was daytime, the house elves hadn’t bothered to lighten thee dozens of torches attached to the walls. Rubbing his arms to gather warmth, Harry walked towards the potion master’s private quarters. He had been there before and he knew the way by now. Knocking carefully on the portrait earned him a very long glare, which he avoided by staring at the wall beside it.
“Besides-“ Harry shrugged. “Snape is helping me as well with… some personal matter.” He repeated Jason’s own words. As if they somehow had gotten a small connection through the Professor, Harry placed a gentle hand on one of Jason’s arms.
“Yes.”
“Because,” Jason excitingly burst out. “We should sneak in there and have a snowball fight. An epic one, just muggle style!” Harry couldn’t help but smile at is enthusiasm.
Harry would love it if Draco had gotten him something for Christmas but he wasn’t the one whom had been describing their relationship as barely anything. He felt totally joyless as he listened to the excited murmurs around the hall. He and Ron still weren’t really speaking like they used to, and things were actually changing permanently between them. They had been fighting before but this one seemed rather final.
Oh. So if the headmaster had told him to stay out of it, then why were they discussing about it?
While Harry hated when people were sticking their nose in others business, Jason was his friend and helping his friends was always a good idea. Especially if they didn’t get punished by their Potion professor while doing it. Yes, the veela and his very stubborn father simply needed some help.
No. No matter, it was in the past. A past that a few months ago had seemed so important, but Severus guessed it was true what they said about becoming a parent. Everything changed. Anything that in the least bit didn’t concern your child was suddenly wiped clear of importance.
Harry sent him a sharp look. “Because he is my friend?”
A hand landed on his shoulder and he almost choked as he rinsed the bread with some apple juice. He immediately started coughing.
“You too, Potter.” He went inside the compartment.
“Can we talk?”
“Sure. The job is rather important, highly sought and the pay is worth the long hours.”
“I know-“
“How would you know that?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“We have charms with the Gryffindors.”
Blushing fiercely, Harry admitted to not knowing much.
“It could still be a while. The little guy isn’t moving as much as I would have hoped.” Hagrid sat down looking slightly concerned. Cold dread of fear smashed its way into his stomach.
HP POV
Jason smiled sadly.
The sound of running feet came towards him and Harry looked around for a place to hide. Thankfully, he could reach the tunnel from here and he stepped inside to avoid the confrontation. Practically holding his breath, he heard the blundering sound of feet above his head. The patchy ice above him reflected the light and he could actually see the person standing right above him. For a minute, he was convinced he had been found but then the person moved on and stepped out of sight.
“What’s wrong?” Blaise wondered breathlessly.
Potter was about to respond, when an angry red head practically tackled past him and brought Potter along.
Then a knock landed on his front door. It would seem it wasn’t death eaters. Harry doubted they would have the patience for him to open the door or shout ‘come in’.
“I would love to, but I can’t.”
“So what did you want to say?” Harry wondered. Trying his best not to sound eager. Malfoy still hadn’t removed his hand.
Sudden worry overcame him. Would Draco be alright on his own? His father wasn’t exactly one known for a calm temper, perhaps he should head back…. On the other hand, Mr. Malfoy didn’t really freak out before he noticed Harry standing in the corner of Madam Pomphrey’s office.
“So-“ Jason sighed. “Should we get back to the main topic?”
“Promise me you will not tell anyone. If the school board got any knowledge of my creature heritage, they would have enough ground to expel me.”
“-SO stubborn, anymore.” Harry finished and pretended not to have heard it.
Harry Potter who’s only chapter in the book of life was to turn Draco’s slightly more annoying. Cleansing himself, he left the shower, placing a towel around his hips. Taking a quick look in the mirror he felt a sense of pride as he flexed his toned muscles. Brushing his teeth, combing his hair with gel and drying himself clean, he emerged in a fresh pair of boxers. That was the one thing the muggles had gotten right; boxers. The soft silk against his smooth pale skin always felt amazing.
“Why do you ask, Mr. Potter?”
Nodding, Blaise gratefully changed the subject. “I’ve got my speech ready and those horrible rings they picked out, so don’t worry about that.” Showing him his inner pocket lining along the chest.
Panting quietly, Harry moved his hands up and into the blond locks. If it was even possible, his hair was even softer than his lips and Harry couldn’t help himself but weave his fingers into it.
He tried to focus on the sweetness and endearment of the kiss, rather than the tiny painful poking in his stomach and chest at the thought of Blaise not wanting to return the gesture. Their kiss continued as Jason locked his hands underneath his back, clinging to his body.
“I had no idea such a potion existed.” Harry whispered, wondering.
“Yes, please, say it louder.” Harry mumbled. A big slap on the back almost tipped him over on the staircase.
Harry had to clear his throat before answering; that he had a numbing headache. Madam Pomphrey gave him a smaller pain relieve potion and moved on to Jason.
Quickly his wand was back in his hand where it belonged, and he rose to his feet. His tiredness disappeared as dew under the sun, as his heart prepared him for battle. Even after Voldemort had been vanquished, death eaters and supporters were still out there, waiting for him at some point. Most of the time they remained hidden, knowing their lord was partly mold now, but sometimes a few of them would resurface and try to get back at him.
Politely declining, Harry asked him again to clarify. “I don’t want to run with gossip.” Esben once again apologized.
“But harry is alone. We have to-“ The red-haired boy clearly had a mighty internal struggle between wanting to help his friend and following his girlfriend. Hermione, the bright witch she was, had already figured out how to rescue them both from Malfoy before anything evolved.
“Well, we are all going to Hogsmeade on Friday, do you want to join?”
“Needless to say; we have a lot to celebrate this year. Which is why the schoolboard had agreed to hold a Christmas ball this year. To celebrate new beginnings-”
Blaise nodded. “Yeah, he is already on the train somewhere. He left as one of the first.”
Turning on the giant showerhead, Harry went under the scouring hot jet and closed his eyes. He enjoyed the warm water running smoothly over his body, trailing away all the dirt and dead skincells from today. Picking up his soap, he ran it under the water a few times to get the bubbles going, before dragging it across his body. His feet, legs, thighs and stomach was tended and then head, shoulder, arms and chest.
HP POV
“Okay, I’m seriously glad you are good, mate, but can we please discuss why the hell the ferret decided to join in?” Ron practically spluttered.
“So you haven’t found the reason yet?”
“We should
“Hurts.” Malfoy chuckled.
“I will give you a chance to explain yourself, but make it quick and truthful.” The professor ordered. Way to calmly placing his hands in front of him.
Draco couldn’t believe this. Potter had actually offered him a way out, if his parents denied him. While he said, he would be fine, his action told Draco otherwise. He looked upset and clearly hung on to Draco’s hand, not wanting to show him anymore emotions on the matter. But Draco wasn’t a Slytherin for nothing. He was an expert in shielding his emotion from the world and Potter weren’t.
“Yeah. You should go before you get caught.” Harry tried not to show how much he wished him to do the opposite and stay. It seemed as though Malfoy looked right through him and he leaned in to gently touch his lips. Harry could feel the rough edge of chapped lips molding against his own. It had been too long since the last time they kissed. Harry wasn’t sure which one of them moved closer, or if they both closed the distance, but he felt wonderful as Malfoy buried his hands into his back and spread each of them out as though he wished to touch every single of Harry’s spinal cords. Moving his own into the blond locks, he deepened the kiss and their tongues met. The taste of spearmint and something clean and sweet as powdered sugar exploded on his taste buds. Regretfully, Harry eventually pulled away but settled for a few last quick pecks.
“But Harry-“ Lifting a hand he silenced the ginger boy.
“Yeah. Sounds fun.” Harry couldn’t keep the smile of his lips. He literally felt… giddy. No one said anything as the two boys just stared at each other, smiling. Harry felt himself almost pulled closer to Malfoy by invisible force and leaned in.
Blaise just snorted.
The subtle meaning didn’t escape the blond as his eyebrows flew to his hairline.
Draco tried to slow his beating heart, desperate to get out of the overly heated classroom. Snape suddenly handed him a scrunched up piece of paper. He couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows at the change of topic as he reached for the note. Opening it, he certainly hadn’t expected to see a list of names. Glancing through it, he caught on to the fact that his own name was on it as well.
Chuckling, Draco sipped his drink dramatically.
“I’m really sorry Hagrid, truly.” Harry whispered.
“There is nothing ‘obvious’ going on. We are housemates.” At the rather undignified expression on Harry’s face he continued; “-And he has a tendency to bother me. Speaking of which, how are you and Draco doing?”
“My eyes haven’t always been different colors. But all of a sudden my right eye was a warm hazel color, and I was scared. I was terrified. I had a panic attack for the first time in my life and the friendly auror, whom were still in my house, helped me calm down. Since she was the only ‘friend’ around me, I ended up telling her everything. About my father’s picture, the suspicion of illegal potionmaking and my eye’s sudden change. I could no longer hold it together and I just sat there crying while she held me.”
The students quickly settled down and watched as Professor Dumbledore got up to stand at his golden podium. Holding onto the edges, he smiled out at the students.
Ridiculous Potter would assume something from a silly precious memory was a great way to show you cared.
“Yes, I told you I would.” Draco smiled and took the seat beside him.
“Stop that,” He started laughing. “You look like an old man.”  Laughing he tried to avoid the hand that pushed his shoulder. Severus got up, brushed the sand from his coat and Lauris followed.
Shaking hands with each of his teachers he smiled awkwardly as both Madam Pomphrey and Professor Sprout dried away their tears. Hagrid was bawling loudly into his handkerchief and embraced Harry in an airtight hug and didn’t let go until Remus coughed gently, reminding him of the awaiting students.
“But Harry… it’s kind of weird how much you run into him-“ Hermione began.
“You’re wearing it.” The Slytherin noted.
“You didn’t scare me.” the blond huffed, before seeming sympathetic. “Are you ready?”
“Had it possibly occurred to you that I might
“You’re not. You’re just sorry now because I’m angry with you instead of Malfoy.”
“NO!”
Fiddling with his own fingers, he moved in and closed the gap between them. As if natural, Draco placed his hands around him and pulled their chests together. Trying to keep his mouth from drying out, Harry licked his lips. Obviously, from the look on Draco’s face, he had seen the tongue dart out and moisturize the pink skin.
And now, here he was. Many years later and the children were still the same dunderheads they had always been. Few showed promises of talent in potion making and even fewer showed the interest in learning.
Their breaths mingled as Draco started feeling him up. Lifting up the white shirt, Draco started dragging it over Harry’s head, but halfway through he changed his mind and left it around his arms. Suddenly feeling trapped, Harry looked questionably as he flopped is hands for a second.
DM POV
After walking in through the giant wooden doors, they only had a left turn to go before they would be arriving at the great hall, where a magnificent feast would be awaiting them. The great hall was per usual, filled with floating candles. The sky ceiling had been charmed to look clear and brightly shinning with stars, unlike outside where the rain was still pouring. Finding their seats on the long bench at the Slytherin table, Draco turned his attention to the teachers’. Gaining eye contact with his godfather, Draco gave a slight nod and received one back. Even now when the dark lord had been vanquished, one couldn’t be too careful to show emotions. Even though Draco looked up to his godfather from a young age, he believed Snape had only provided him help in order to save his own skin. The Gryffindors may think otherwise but only a Slytherin knew how a Slytherin thought. This didn’t mean Draco didn’t care for Snape, it just meant he kept his thoughts to himself unless it was otherwise necessary.
Finally walking, Seamus dropped his hand to his and pulled him back. Four boys now stood in front of him. Two who looked rather concerned, one who looked unsure and a fourth who seemed ashamed.
Causally, Harry turned back to pay attention.
“Hey.” Hermione greeted them and laid her bag on the floor.
Seeing the look on her friend face. Tearful as it was, she could see disbelieve yet relief that she had taken his side.
“Jason… I swear-“ Blaise sought out behind him, afraid to hit something as Jason stalked closer. The smaller boy felt like a prey. A scared rabbit whom had walked into the lion’s den.
Harry didn’t even think about it before he hurried forward. Trying to keep from looking vulnerable in front of so many of his fellow students and friends, he forced himself not to run. The scared older man still smiled at him as he stumbled towards him. When only a few meters were left between them, Harry stopped.
“Oh please- just last night you practically fell out of your chair as Oliver picked up the book he dropped on the floor.” Dean rolled his eyes.
Blushing slightly at the mention of Draco, he tried not to smile like an idiot. “Good. It’s… really great. The other day we were sitting outside and just talking. Nothing else and I couldn’t believe I liked it as much as I love kissing him. I honestly thought it would be the more ‘normal’ part of a relationship.”
Seeing the careful look in the green eyes, Draco nodded and tried not to sound too disappointed. “Right.”
“Potter.”
charm.
“Jason?” Right then, Harry’s heart began to clench as well. Of course, breaking up would really suck. Anyone would be upset and he could barely comprehend how much Jason loved the dark-eyed boy but surely nothing else what happen besides having to leave each other?
Draco hated the fact that Potter was causing him emotional issues.
“-But it wasn’t your fault, I mean, he could at least have heard you out-“
Grimacing, Harry nodded.
“Is that why you moved here? To stay with her?”
The students walked back in silence. The fact that they had been caught and Professor Snape had deducted points, had left them feeling awkward around each other. Harry was still walking hand in hand with Draco and he squeezed it tightly.
“I’m glad we are getting this time together.” Remus pulled back.
“Hey Harry.”
“Ron, come on. They are not worth it.” Hermione urged him. She barely waved her wand before silently ‘accioing’ her book back safely into her hands.
Leaning back for support, he once more felt dreadful, but this time it wasn’t because of a spell…
“Right. You know what? I was actually doubting wither or not you had truly started changing, but you just made that very clear.” Harry went around the confused boy and sat out for class.
“Yeah, I think that would be great.”
“No, I hear that often. I never really cared where I ended up, I just wanted to be near my twin brother. When he quickly went to the Slytherin house at the ceremony, I begged the hat to place me with him. I would probably had ended up in Hufflepuff but thankfully the hat listened to me.” she told him.
It was Tuesday morning and Harry couldn’t help but feel that this was going to be a good day. First of all; They only had two classes that day, because for some reason DADA had been cancelled. First class was still Potions but the second was Care of magical creatures. Harry still couldn’t believe Hagrid had a dragon egg nesting in his home. Hopefully, the dragon would hatch soon and then it would only be a few weeks before he was going back to Rumania or another dragon reservation. Second of all, the sun was finally shining, rather brightly for this seasons weather. Today was actually blue sky, even though a few gray clouds had taken place, Harry refused to complain. Today was going to be a good day.
“Headmaster Dumbledore.” The dragonologists started introducing themselves to the professors and the headmaster, but Harry didn’t really bother to listen. He continued stroking the soft scaly head as he gently spoke.
“I’ll be right back!” he quickly yelled over his shoulder and ran out the small shop area. Severus wasn’t sure how long he waited but it was enough for him to have gotten quite hungry from the way-too-sweet smell in there. Suddenly a sound from the front startled him enough too almost draw his wand.
“Should I go?” Lupin asked timidly.
Damn the last part was actually quite hard to write, I feel so sad for Severus. But now, Remus has joined the gang and this will probably lead to more secrets being relieved…
Sniffling against his shoulder, she finally whispered; “I’ll try.”
“Well, friends might be stretch. More as… acquaintances.”
“I still don’t like how you always defend him.” Jason pouted.
“Is everything all right?”
“Can I come?” Harry asked.
“Or something below the guts.” George smirked teasingly.
“I know, Harry told me.” He still refused to look at him and Blaise wasn’t used to fight for his attention. Normally he only had to walk into a room before the teen would be sucked to him like an octopus.
Laughing deeply the old man picked up another cookie welcoming the hint to lighten the mood.
“Most people wouldn’t if they didn’t get a second chance.”
“But…” Jason digged.
Nodding the boy had almost closed the door when Harry called for him once again. The slightly annoyed boy stared at him, waiting for his bidding. Smiling gently, Harry wished him a merry Christmas. Blaise seemed surprised before smirking.
“Merlin sake.” Malfoy looked to be in disbelief, laughing.
“Git.”
“Something might have happened even before he was sent here. Harry, you must understand, dragons aren’t supposed to leave their eggs and even when they leave for hunting they never stay far from it. Probably not more than a few hours tops. We don’t know how long his mother had left him in the nest before they rescued him.”
“You felt him kick eh?”
It had almost been two months when they held their weekly meeting once more. Severus barely listened and only thought of tonight where Lauris and he were going to a small amusement park, as the tanned man had found out the wizard had never been to one.
Tearing his eyes away he quickly sneaked his way through the narrow halls before realizing he actually had no idea where to go. He couldn’t very well go home. It would be the first place his father would tear down to the ground, trying to find him. His family and all his friends were gathered here. Should he try to find Blaise in the hall?
Nodding, Seamus accepted the excuse and continued to talk about the presents he had bought for the family.
“I... I
Jason just mumbled something, but even though he sat right next to him, Harry wasn’t able to hear it. Complaining so, Jason sighed.
In that second, Harry found himself begging to every god he had ever heard off. Let it be a lie, a horrible lie she had made up. In a minute she loud laugh at him and turn away. Simply trying to amuse herself by seeing him in distress. She would turn away from him and everything was as before.
“Wow…” Ron smiled stupidly.
Thank you for continuing to read my story.
Harry only smiled greatly and thanked him for the gift. He knew the Professor was serious in his threat but had also come to understand how much easier it was to mask his insecurity with sarcasm.  It had obviously mattered to him that Harry had liked the gift.
“Do you think I can stay here instead? It’s kind of quiet there, right now.” Harry shrugged.
“Dragon claw powder, yes. It is from a Peruvian Vippertooth, I heard it was quite useable in certain potions.”
“Potter! Hurry up!”
… But it would be a lie.
Stupid Potter…
Looking away from Lupin, he pondered if he should continue his story. If he was able to handle such vigorous memories coming back, all of a sudden. He had been so desperate when he left that life behind and in it, apparently a pregnant man whom was now deceased.
“No, not that. But the whole thing about pureblood and silly stuff like that.”
“Mr. Malfoy, what did I just say? Don’t touch the petals! The smell may not be even half as strong now as they will be in January but the pollen will stick to you like glue!”
At the end of class, students were sweating from head to toe and spent the rest of the day picking out thorns from their clothing. The Ravenclaws, who weren’t exactly the type whom enjoyed exercising, seemed very unpleasant and tense for the remaining day. Harry didn’t just feel physically tired, but mentally as well, after a rather lived discussion with his friends. Waving goodbye, he headed for the library. Hermione offered to join but he declined. He would rather be alone for a while. Walking past students and the great hall, he left his two classmates behind.
“The warm-sensing charm won’t work when we are already colder than normal.” Draco disregarded his idea calmly. Once again, Harry mentally sent Draco a thank you kiss as he had kept from making fun of Neville in any way.
"Potter, this is ridiculous-“
One evening studying in the library, Harry was laughing at a joke Malfoy had just told when Zabini announced he was going to bed. Gathering their things, the four boys headed down. Zabini and Jason was standing in front of them on the moving staircase. The taller Australian was giving vain attempts to hold Zabini’s hand, but the proud Slytherin was anything but willing to give such a display of affection in public. Finally, on the sixteen hundred try, Blaise gave up trying to avoid it and they stood in silence both secretly enjoying the intimacy. Harry couldn’t help but smile at them. Who could? They were in such contrast, where Zabini’s cold and proud demeanor could make a first year pee his pants but with the warm sunshine smiling next to him, it became a perfect match.
“Seriously?” He was.
He took a final deep breath and yelled for the last time. “REMUS!”
“Yeah, it was great. You know, maybe we can see a game together next season.”
“Draco please…”
“Good, I think. I don’t really have any idea how to win a snowball fight. I never tried it.” She said bashfully.
“What were you thinking-“
As the group went on their way to find space enough for everyone, Ron leaned in to ask him who the new guy was.
A familiar hand on his shoulder stopped him as he left for the staircase. His heart knocked so hard against his chest, it would surely break his chest bone. But it was too late to escape. Malfoy was standing behind him. They were alone.
In the dungeon it wasn’t unusual to be little chilly but tonight it seemed almost to the extreme. The second Harry had descended the stairs, goosebumps rose on his arms and legs. By the time he was a few steps from the potion Professor’s private quarters, Remus had finally caught up with him.
Laughing sinisterly, Harry dried the rest of his cheeks with his sleeve. “You were right. About Malfoy. It wasn’t really… real.”
“I don’t.” Seeing the look the Malfoy gave him, he rephrased; “Okay, I do but I’m trying to understand, okay?”
“Well, I didn’t
Harry shook his head even though Jason was still digging through the snow and couldn’t see it.
Jason gave him a saddened smile; “Probably, but I can’t get into the spirit.”
Waving again, the blond boy said nothing and continued on his way to the Slytherin common room. Harry carefully waited until Malfoy was out of sight, before waking up the Fat Lady. She wasn’t happy, but promised in a huff, that she wouldn’t tell on him. “This once, young Harry!” she puffed as she ushered him in.
Potter looked completely perplexed as if he pondered having imagined, Draco actually talking to him.
His friend sat there, seemingly in incomprehension. “Okay Harry, I know you are hurting but Blaise wouldn’t be part of this. He wouldn’t lie to me.”
“God sake Seamus! We are in the middle of the street!” Dean almost whined and hurriedly went around him to continue walking. Laughing, the tallest boy ran after his boyfriend and the next few minutes Harry watched with a smile, how Seamus desperately tried to kiss him.
Reading how the Quidditch referee had gotten in a fight with the keeper from Braga Bombers had caught him and he had almost finished the page when someone pushed their elbow against him. Scowling annoyed he moved his owns a little closer together to make space. When it happened second time, Draco sneered; “What?”. There was after all, only so much patience a Malfoy could offer.
“…No.” Malfoy didn’t look at him any longer. The taller boy was staring at a spot above his head. As if he was bothered by the fact that Harry was tearing up. But he wouldn’t cry, never in front of him, would Harry cry. Ever again.
and ‘
“Yes, while your parents were terrified of Voldemort finding them, we managed to work around the fidelius charm, so we could get through the floonetwork without actually knowing where we were.”
Happy newyear everyone!
“You- you can have a second chance.” Blushing he scratched his head. “You know, with me. As friends- classmates, erhm people?” ‘Good job, Potter’, he felt like kicking himself.  Although the stupid statement was worth the smile, Malfoy sent him.
“Are we-“
“I will try this time, I promise I really will! I was… it was hard to imagine you together, but I can see now I was wrong.”
Draco pulled out his possessions and sat out to remake the notes from Ancient Runes. He and Blaise had almost finished the assignment already, but Blaise insisted on reading the material twice just in case they had missed something important. While Draco could appreciate the dedication, he didn’t feel the need to contribute for now. The five students sat rather closely, considering the table really was meant for just four. If he leaned out of his chair just a bit, his thighs would touch Potters’. Looking up from his notes discreetly, he could see the blush spreading across his friend’s face as Melck discreetly had laid a hand on the back of his neck, simply holding it there for comfort. No matter how annoying the boy got, it was hard to deny the healthy glow it brought his friend. Together- even just sitting beside each other- there was almost something
For a minute, Harry felt his anger start to melt, but he stubbornly held on to it. He wouldn’t let Draco get off so easily.
“Yeah.” Harry began. “It’s just, someone asked me out -days ago- and I said yes.”
“Yeah and I appreciate it. But I just realized in that moment how difficult it would be for us, erhm to be seen together.. as friends.” Harry explained awkwardly.
“You may go back to your common room, Mr. Potter.”
“I think it sounds like a good idea.” He began. “Oh, actually if you started working part time as a healer than studied on the side in a muggle care, it would certainly help your resume. You would stand out to apply, especially if you went for a private physic. You know, I actually know of this place near Regents Park-“
Remus lifted a hand to silence him.
“And it can’t get worse, right? Give him a chance and if it doesn’t work out then it will stay the same as it is now.”
“Did Potter tell you?”
Harry reached out with a closed fist and Draco accepted.
long distant cousin.” He waved a non-caring hand. “Either way, you can find our great grandparents related. It just so happened my grandmother immigrated to Sweden and was therefore not able to keep in contact. Thank merlin for small mercies.” He grinned behind his glass.
“Okay…?”
The rest of the day had been marvelous. The two boys spent it in the Slytherin common room as it was closer to the great hall and outside if they wanted to take a stroll. Inside the warm room they had been eating way too many sugar cookies with frosting and snickerdoodles. Playing exploding snap, wizard skittles and even a few rounds of chess the boys were having a great time. It had been a long time since Harry had laughed so much. They also spend an amount of time comparing the Wizarding world from Australia to Britain and some of the laws were scarily crazy.
Coughing slightly to regain his manners, he answered;
Receiving a rather stiff smile, Harry felt a gentle finger soothing the back of his hand.
As he rounded another corner, Harry was surprised to see the headmaster talking to some of the paintings.
For a while, the boys were lost in their own thoughts and when the silence finally appeared possible to break, two elves from the kitchen pop in with their breakfast. A glass orange juice and a slightly watery porridge later, Madam Pomphrey checked them over a second time before deciding to release them.
The dungeon that morning was terribly cold and he hurried to dress in both long socks and a new sweater from his aunt. The wool slightly itched, but with a long-sleeved underneath, it was probably be fine. Brushing his teeth and combing his hair in the bathroom, he listened to his dorm mates getting ready to leave for the excursion to Hogsmeade. Normally, having roommates for the first time in his life wouldn’t have been very difficult, if it weren’t for the fact that he now had rather sensitive hearing.
“Hey Harry, I wondered where you were. I thought you would have arrived with your friends to say goodbye.”
“Farther, I-“
Rolling his eyes, Blaise explained;
“Having you on your knees in front of me… under me.”
“After that I slept for a whole day. My body was exhausted. But when I saw myself in a mirror once again my eyes were still a different color each. Well, while it is a long story, I’m going to make it short before you get impatient.” He smiled.
“It’s getting late, huh?”
“I didn’t either until I started searching the possibilities for male pregnancies in the wizarding world. Every time I would buy a book or ask a birth healer, the faces I met all told the same story. Every time someone had been foolish enough to try such a potion, it had ended dreadfully.”
Malfoy and he held hands the entire time, while they were talking. It turned out they had more than enough to discuss, so much they needed to learn about each other. When they arrived at the small crocket stone bridge, they were in a lively tale of how Harry actually managed to beat the troll in first year.
“In a way.” Draco went to open the bottle. “We’re in La Rochelle. This is my room in the manor where we spent the summer.”
Seamus just smirked back. In that second, dinner arrived. Seamus had been right. The massive tables were covered with tins of pie. The tins all held different colors and shapes. Some, more ordinary looking were round and silver or even bronze, while others were shaped like simple animals or objects. A tiny sign had been placed in each pie, explaining the content. Meat&Carrot, Tuna and even one with rabbit were the first people dug in to, saving the dessert pies for latter.
Harry bit his lip from crying out. Two strong hands clasped his shoulders tightly, as Harry tried to break free.
“Not really… I got the picture and some other stuff after… it happened. Doesn’t really matter how.” Mr. Melck carefully explained. “When I realized I had to move here, I wanted to find you.”
Having convinced himself, Harry hurried to Remus’ private quarters.
“I hope he is going to be alright.” Harry worried.
“Right, so we aren’t going to be spending Christmas together at the Burrow, this year. Things with his sister are even worse.”
This was not good. If Snape got a whiff of their plan, he would do whatever it took to keep him away from Potter. For some reason Draco had never understood, Snape hated the golden boy more than anyone and at the same time kept him protected. He would have to think of something and fast. Why was he kissing Potter? Why indeed…
“Well thank you Mr. ferret, that’s very noble of you.” Harry mocked and bowed.
“No I didn’t. He seems… too friendly. Merlin sake, Harry, he is in Slytherin! Since when have they
Resting his head on a hand, Snape guessed; “Yes, I can imagine your
Slowly he let go of her hand, feeling more empty than he imagined he would. But he realized by letting go, he wasn’t just saying goodbye to a marriage. He was letting go of a future where he would have stayed good friends with his father, maybe getting his own children someday. Everything he had imagined his life would be like for so long, would pass by when he went the other way. But it was barely anything compared to what he could gain. So letting go, he gave a final smile to the crying woman before leaving.
DM POV
“Here. Read the third and sixteenth chapter.”
Humming the girl looked at him again.
“Oh.” Harry shifted a bit. “Can I ask you something, Dean?”
Deciding he had had enough of his friends’ fun on his behalf, he left to go to bed. Draco was about to throw his shirt off when he sound of footsteps came towards him. Without even knocking Pansy entered the room, seeming prissy as ever.
The next day had seemed to go by incredibly fast. Breakfast, classes and their fifteen-minute break almost molded, and then after Divination, someone caught Harry unexpectedly. Coming down from the tall ladder, Harry tried to follow his friends when a stiff hand landed on his shoulder.
“Then it shouldn’t matter what I think.” Dumbledore chuckled.
“It’s my fault. I forgot to send the presents down here.”
“Oh, okay.” Ron gave a rather awkward smile, but nonetheless a smile. Smiling back at him, Ron left the room with an unopened inkbottle. Things would certainly take its time, but perhaps being apart for a few weeks would be best for all of them. Even though Ron was his first- and for many years – best friend, Harry had to acknowledge they were growing older. He couldn’t expect him, Ron and Hermione to remain close for the rest of their lives. Hopefully, they would always remain friends but for now he would stick to hanging out with Seamus and Dean.
“Then I should say we can let them go with a warning this time and I am most confident you did a furrow job.” He continued to munch on the cookie, once dipping it into his tea.
Standing there holding most of his books, Malfoy lent a hand to help him up. Giving him a smile, Harry took the outreached help. Back on his feet, Harry was about to say ‘thank you’ when a rather angry voice erupted.
He kept looking around for a certain pastry shop that Mr. Knott had fallen for whilst here. It was a muggle store and Severus was apparently perfect to blend in with the wastes of breaths. He had never even seen the place but by direction is should be a small shop looking like a cousin to Madam Puttifoot’s Tea Shop.
Satisfied with the last attempt, he finally left for the tower. Slowly walking towards his destination, he felt how tired his body and mind truly was. He was heading straight to bed.
In fact, it had been quite pleasant to speak to him. The night unfortunately, had ended in a dreaded nightmare featuring his parents again. Harry had tried to push it away but the look on their faces had seemed so real. The anger, sadness, disappointment…
“Not a chance, Potter. I can accept the idea of you dating one, but no way am I spending any of my free time on Slytherins!” Ron opined dramatically.  Looking for help from Dean and Seamus, he felt rather betrayed when they grimaced.
“Don’t you have to get back as well?” Harry asked. Malfoy didn’t bother to answer but dragged him along towards the fat lady’s portrait.
“You wouldn’t happen to be interested in that too, would you?”
“You have to be done with this.”  Ignoring her, Draco continued to get ready for bed.  “You can’t keep Potter around. Get rid of him.”
Thinking back on all the moments Harry and his friend had had in this very hall. Harry felt excited. Yet, a lingering sadness tore him as he forever had to say goodbye to his only real home. It was with a heavy heart. Looking back at his NEWT results he was quite ready to leave. Hermione had assured him that his grades were enough to get him into a healing studentship at St. Mungos. It had been a harsh month. Looking back at the disaster of his first real relationship with a boy, Harry was at least relieved to leave it behind him. He hadn’t heard a single word from Malfoy ever since that day, and while he often felt the haunting looks at the back of his neck, he stubbornly held on and kept far away from the blond.
“No, don’t. It’s not your fault in any way…” realizing he wasn’t the only one hurting right now, he wisped around to face him. “Harry, you have to know, I didn’t! Know, that is. Nothing, I swear. I would have told you!”
A hand silently stilled his answer as the larger boy explained.
“What? No! I wouldn’t do that.” Harry then explained his idea and thankfully, Hagrid could see the sense in using Aodhan instead of buying some expensive claws from the apothecary. Anything coming from a dragon could be used in magical experiments but because of the difficult in breeding and gathering the supplies, dragon items could be very, VERY expensive.
Harry ran away before the boy could see him. Almost running straight into Hermione around the corner he quickly hit her and she huffed in mock anger before leaving the field.
At this point, Malfoy lost all social grace. Silent tears started forming and ran down his cheeks. And as much as Harry hated himself for showing such weakness, he couldn’t stop his own from falling, any longer. Crying together, yet so far apart, Malfoy desperately grabbed Harry’s hand between his own two. The Gryffindor was too tired to fight him anymore, no matter how much it burned.
Remembering the reason for coming down here, he tried a subtle approach.
Now he was heading towards the small hut where his tall friend was awaiting him. He hadn’t sent a correspond but he imagined Hagrid would know he was planning on coming. Taking the southern entrance as he usually did, he went through the now empty pumpkinpatch. Roots and dried leaves were still lying around in the dirt. Kicking up a few he watched as the wind played with them along the trail.
“Are you all right?”
“Everything the Prophet printed was pure lies and believe me, when I say they will be printing a retraction in the first print of tomorrow!”
This was without a doubt the most awkward conversation, Harry had ever had, including his date with Cho Chang in fifth year. Coughing, Malfoy tried again.
When Remus was on his way back to the front, Harry gave him a single nod before returning to his book.
Trying to focus on his friends’ conversation, Harry forced a smile. The two young men sitting across from him had been together for a long time now. No one was exactly sure how long. There had always been rumors of what was going on in their dorm room but Harry had never seen anything remotely close to intimacy, certainly not something out of the ordinary friendship. One day they had simple entered the great hall, hand in hand and that was it. Thankfully so many rumors had circulated, so when they actually came out of the closet, the Hogwarts community had been relatively supportive. Of course, Hogwarts wasn’t a fairytale and approximately a third of the students were born in rather conservative households and were therefore less excited to see an openly gay couple at their school. Luckily, they had mostly kept to themselves and Dean and Seamus denied to have felt any big impact of injustice.
“You got to be kidding me!” Harry stormed off.
“-Therefor you shall be teamed up in pairs between the houses-” Groaning and small uttered protests rang amongst the students. Hagrid swiftly tried to settle them down.
“I… would.” Draco cried now as well. Not loudly as Harry had, but tears were falling down his already wet cheeks.
Nodded with a full mouth of butterbeer, he elaborated; “Yes, I’m only missing one but I can get that at Hogwarts.” At Neville’s slightly worried look, he quickly explained he wasn’t planning on stealing anything, but it was more of a homemade gift. Believing him, the two friends turned back to the flourishing conversation.
“Ah, yes. It will certainly be fun for you this year. Now you can go without worrying about dragons and merepeple.”
He refused to look at her after she clearly didn’t believe it was necessary to keep her voice down. Instead, he continued to write his notes, however limited they were.
“I found it after it had fallen out of Mr. Potter’s pocket the other day. If you and he is in a… liaison, then do tell me why you are simply another name on a list?”
“Harry?”
Even though the Professor had been a master spy and had practiced his poker face for years, Harry was still able to see the slight change in his demeanor.
Waking up, he felt like shit. His neck and shoulders were unbelievably stiff and his neck loudly cracked as he rolled it from side to side. Finding his glasses on the coffee table beside him, he gazed around the room. As he realized where he was, the memories from yesterday, resurfaced.
“Jason, I’m not sure how much of his past Snape had been willing to tell you, but he hasn’t lived an easy life. I think no matter what he says, you are very important to him. I think you are his only family, at least probably, the only one he talks to.”
“No.” Malfoy shook his head and grabbed his hand once again. “Let’s just be the two of us today.”
On their way home, the wind had truly picked up and almost all the students were scooting together and holding up their scarfs to avoid the hail. Harry had already replaced the warming charm on his clothes, twice. As gross as it was, he kept drying his wet nose on his cloak. Thankfully, the trip from Hogsmeade wasn’t too long and the students soon found themselves safe inside the warm castle. Almost everyone took off their cloaks, gloves and scarf in the hall, the wet clothes were dripping with defrosted snow. The Professor summoned a few houseelves from the kitchens and they quickly collected the offered clothes.
“Pansy…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“While we won’t punish you for endangering the school and therefor wont have to involve the schoolboard-“ Snape snorted in disdain. “But we will punish you for keeping a creature in captivity where it didn’t belong and for keeping a secret wellaware of the consequences. You will have detention for the remaining of the months and will be kept from leaving Hogwarts grounds for the rest of the year. Meaning, no more trips to Hogsmeade.”
Stopping for a second, Harry realized he had no idea where in the castle Zabini was. Chances were that he was down in the Slytherin commonroom but he might as well be outside in the warm weather or even in the library, studying. He couldn’t waste Jason’s time searching the entire castle. No, he would need some help and Harry was already certain who could.
“I… Harry I want to believe you, I do, but this is Parkinson after all, are you really sure this is true? Like, really, really?”
Finally, the sound of footsteps arriving, travelled up the stairs. A darkened shadow entered the door and behind it came Ron in his bright colored pajamas. Harry never thought he would say it, but he felt so relieved to see Professor Snape. Hopefully, Ron hadn’t gotten in trouble for being out of bed this late at night.
The door opened once again as Jason stuck his head in. “We need to get ready.”
“No sir, thanks.”
“I’m sorry-“ Harry couldn’t help but sound startled. “Your father- is Snape.”
“How about you and Zabini?”
It had been almost two hours since Harry had joined and the firth time he had left to get fresh air. Getting back from the firth turn, he almost tripped over the tiny step when he heard a noise, ‘pop’. Hagrid suddenly looked up and both men hurried to the fireplace. Another pop, and another, until it sounded like someone was making popcorn. Inside the cauldron the egg twitched around, hitting the sides constantly.
A small child in a floral white dress shyly waved at him and hid her blushing face in her mother’s skirt as Harry returned it.
So last time we met a new character whom I made up. He is all mine! ;)
“Yes!” his torso moved up from the water as he shot white ropes of come over the bubbles. He gently pulled out his fingers and almost fell back into the tub as his jelly-like legs gave out. Panting, he moved a hand over his face, removing the sweat that had gathered. Completely exhausted, he got up carefully, cleaned the tub and went back to the tower. It was without a doubt the hardest he had ever come in his life. If sex were any better than what had just happened, he would probably die.
Hello again,
“A first-time occurrence.” Draco tried to keep calm as his fingernails shredded through the thin piece of paper he was holding.
“What happened? Was it… the war, You-Know-Who?” Neville looked uncomfortable.
“Yeah, sorry.” Harry gave a forced smile. “Just a little overwhelmed after the entire castle being so quiet during the entire week.” Well, that wasn’t completely a lie.
Smiling sadly, she placed her bouquet of pink lilies beside them.
Looking at himself in the mirror, you could barely tell he was tired. The cheering potion and concealing charm had worked wonders on his skin. Although he still felt like crap, it wasn’t exactly a new feeling. He straightened his tie on the horrible tuxedo, Pansy had insisted he wore. Why the pureblood circle had adopted this as the newest fashion, he would never know. It was quite uncomfortable and restricting as he kept pulling on his wrist cuffs.
Looking down at what he had stepped on, he bent over to pick up a stuffed black bear. The brown glass-eyes were way to huge on the small head but in a charming way. The bear’s stomach had a sewn heart on the front in a blood red color. Smiling, Harry looked for the place it had fallen from. Unfortunately, it became clear that there was no way to know which shelf it had fallen from, considering there was almost five complete shelves filled with different stuffed animals in all sizes, colors and kinds. Hoping it wouldn’t matter too much, he brushed off the floordust from the bear’s head and created a little space between a raccoon and another lighter colored bear.
Laughing at the confused expression, Harry explained;
A barely given grunt coming from behind Ron’s curtains was all he got in response and Harry imagined it probably wouldn’t matter if they didn’t even notice he was gone. Quickly out the door with his invisibility cloak and his map, he checked the common room for people. But no one was nearby, probably having been exhausted from the long journey.
As they gathered their breath, Lauris smiled cockily and tugged a black strand of hair behind his ears.
“I haven’t been here before. How did you find it?” Blaise marveled.
“No, really, you go. I only need two more.” Harry waved them off, smiling. “Really, you guys, go.” He continued when neither boy moved from their spot on the street. In the end, Harry simply turned around and continued his shopping. He would find the others later. Besides there was only two hours left until the students had to be gathered by the small stone bridge and Harry had to have gotten something by then.
HP POV
The second the cock hit the back of his throat he had to stop. He felt his eyes water and pulled back enough to breathe properly. Reminding himself to watch the teeth AND not hit the back of his throat, he went down once again. Trying to relax helped tremendously. Settling on a rhythm, he bobbed his head up and down and continued to suck.
“So Draco, have you gotten used to the idea of losing?” Pansy was practically skipping beside him.
Behind him, he could hear the clear sound of heels on the floor, but he didn’t bother to turn around and ask why Snape was following him.
“Really? They accepted us?”
“Definitely. If I didn’t have the boytoy next door, I wouldn’t mind dancing with you.” Dean winked at him. The two laughed and the olive skinned teen went back to his own room to change. Harry finished getting his worn-out muggle jeans back on and exited the small room.
The bird quickly crumbled under the pressure of warmth and a soon as the fire had died out, Harry blew the ashes of his desk. Harry didn’t really feel in the mood for researching anymore.
“Wauw…” Harry panted.
“Are you just going to let me dangle here?” he chuckled in disbelief.
Nodding lifelessly, he heard a deep sigh.
Fawkes sat quite still on top of the sleeping man, and Blaise wished the stupid bird would hurry up and do something beside sitting there and staring at him.
“Oh, sure.” He quickly peered at the Slytherin table where a smirking blond gave him a soft wave goodbye. Harry shyly waved back before getting up to leave with his friends. The weather outside was mild and it was thankfully not snowing yet again.
“Are you done?”
“Well actually…” Then Harry proceeded to tell Jason everything. It wasn’t a fool proved plan and his friend found many mistakes and turns the plan could take during the time and place. After cooperating and discussing the final points, Jason agreed to give it a try. As long as there were no chance of Snape finding out it was their fault. They discussed a few more scenarios before Jason pulled away and stretched his arms.
