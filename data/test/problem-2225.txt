allow you to hold back the only living necromancer. I will arrange for additional schooling as I see fit, and you will just have to accept it.”
”I know, and I wasn’t,” Ron sighed, waving his hand dismissively. ”I won’t go picking fights, but I will make fun of them like I’ve always done. Let me have that, at least.”
“They’re… okay,” Harry said. “I like them. It’s something to do, at least. I get bored sometimes when I’m home.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I think he’s a git and though I know he was a victim of his circumstances when it comes to being a Death Eater, everything else was him being himself. The bullying, the slurs, all that. If he has changed, that’s good. Be careful, still, but, you know… do what makes you happy. For once, just think of nothing else but making you happy. Merlin knows you’ve earned that right by now.”
Then again... Mrs. Goyle had her own ideas of what was important information and what wasn't - last time she'd lectured Harry about arranging furniture for gatherings, how to use utensils, what kind of a drink went with which dish, and various other matters that were just... not part of Harry's world, really.
. He cannot reach his full potential when he’s constantly distracted by a multitude of horrors
”I’m not really looking to live in a crowded area,” Harry admitted awkwardly. ”I just want a small place in a peaceful neighbourhood.”
Harry didn’t care to point out that he didn’t have any school materials yet either - he didn’t even know which books he’d need to buy eventually - as he had studied the basics from a few scattered sources. Either way, most people likely didn’t have the burning need to escape into books and forget about their lives the way Harry did.
“The Potters were a neutral family,” Nott said. Harry felt strange hearing his family being referred to as

, really - with his hands in moments like these. When he’d just sit down and focus on listening, blissfully unaware of the faces in the ceiling and the occasional pitiful moan coming from under the coffee table. Harry didn’t want to think of how anyone could’ve died
“Harry,” Uncle Tony said. “This is Bellatrix Lestrange, she—”
He had once – fleetingly – thought about going with his godfather. Just stepping into that fireplace and leaving, but the whole idea had been so unrealistic. He had never done such a thing before, didn’t know if it was even possible for him to leave. And the one time he had dared to approach the fireplace – just to
, it was all he could have for now.
Despite what Uncle Tony had ordered, Bella took Harry away from their designated study the moment the two of them were left alone. She hushed him, then pulled him along through corridors Harry wouldn’t know how to navigate on his own. Their footsteps were quiet, and yet Harry knew that they could be heard – or would have been heard, had Hillcrest been anything like the House. It wasn’t, and so they kept walking undisturbed, until they reached what appeared to be a chapel within the premises.
be - surely the corpse hadn’t been trying to get
Harry curled up in his hiding spot, wondering what would happen next. Lily would have to let go of James eventually - but would she then snap back to reality? Was that a possibility? Merlin, if it
”Great,” Harry said, pleased. Spending time with Malfoy became less and less weird, and while it wasn’t exactly enjoyable, at least they were civil. Harry doubted that they would ever become friends, but at least it didn’t seem as if Malfoy hated him anymore.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Ellis hissed. “If you want him to pull through in the long run and not end up like Bellatrix toeing the line of lunacy, you’ll have to train his mind where you train his magic and body as well. His living conditions are atrocious - are you
No, leaving felt like an impossibility. And yet the last time Uncle Tony had been there, he’d mentioned school. Said something about sending Harry to school soon, and Lily had ignored him much like she ignored everything else aside from James’s corpse.
When Harry heard his godfather’s voice calling for him from downstairs, two things happened: firstly, Harry knew now for sure that he was late from his class with Mrs. Goyle. Secondly,
“Potter.”
”You can decorate the place too, if you want,” Harry said. Honestly, spending effort on trying to look for furniture didn’t sound appealing in the least. If Malfoy saw it as something enjoyable, then he could do it. ”I don’t mind.”
your company.”
”Mate, it’s done!” Ron said, reaching to grab Harry’s shoulder. His voice was loud, but distant at the same time. ”You bloody did it!”
“You know, trying to sound humbe after killing a Dark Lord isn’t really working for you. It wouldn’t work for anything either, really, so don’t take it personally.”
“Do you often go someplace else?”
“Seven clans rule in Ghadames,” Uncle Tony explained. “Each clan has its own entrance, which makes approaching the city harder, of course. Now, look – do you see the runes carved higher up on the wall? Those are protective Kufi signs – you’ll see a lot of them around.”
? “And Lily found him there? She found him and now she’s screaming like a lunatic?”
"No," Bellatrix sneered. "Those little blood traitors know nothing, and simply drift from day to day, getting duller as time passes. They will be defenseless when the Dark Lord rises again, and not even their little Boy-Who-Lived can help them."
these curses are eventually. You mustn’t disagree with them. Now, to another question: do you believe your mother will ever become better?”
Luckily he was with Uncle Tony, who led him towards a table that was fairly secluded, and pushed him to sit down. Moments later a piece of paper with a list of food and drink options - written in Russian, allowing Harry with his limited grasp of the language to recognize only a few - appeared. Occupying himself with making sense of what was written made it even easier to push any thoughts of the morning into a small corner, temporarily stored away.
She had to have been aware, on some level, of James’s fragility - she no longer sat on his lap, and there were no longer sounds coming from her bedroom at night. Harry no longer found pieces of his father in the corridor outside his room, and even the pace at which the two walked had slowed down considerably.
It was Harry he was thinking of when in early February, while attending some celebration or another held by the Malfoys, Ellis saw his son talking with Lucius’s spawn. Sheltered children inspired a bone-deep repulsion in him, and his blood itched to wake those little bags of flesh to the cruel reality of existence. He should’ve raised his Theo the way baby Potter had apparently been raised - aware of death, if not of evil in this world. His wife had, unfortunately, taken the lead in raising the boy, and by now Ellis simply didn’t have the desire to invest that energy into Theo.
And Voldemort was dead.
“I know,” Ellis muttered. “But, as you said, that was the first round. The Dark Lord’s return is a matter of time - our Dark Marks are still visible. Every single Death Eater should know that his absence is temporary, and yet— so many have extracted themselves from the good company.”
can see ghosts that you can’t. Why’s that?”
The voice that broke the silence in the office was dry and low, like a hiss, yet it chilled Harry to his very bones. He twisted on the chair, expecting to see an evil creature of some kind, but was surprised – all he could see was a man whose appearance showed nothing that justified the wariness he inspired. The expression on his calm face spoke of some underlying amusement that seemed to be somehow etched into it. His round eyes were an odd mix of grey and gold, the thick-rimmed glasses doing nothing to hide them. His hair, beard, and mustache could have been once black, but were now a darker shade of grey.
“No,” Uncle Tony said immediately. “In fact, today you needn’t bother with Crabbe either. Have you had breakfast yet? I assume not. Let’s go.”
”Oh, Merlin, I hope not,” Harry joined the conversation with a grimace. ”I don’t want to make anyone feel guilty. Or grateful. Or like they owe me something.”
“Has she done other things?”
”Yes, I agree,” Hermione replied, taking a deep breath. ”And I need to go and look for my parents. Not right now, but... soon.”
Until then—
“Our Lord will be so pleased,” Lestrange hummed, clearly delighted.
”What’s happening?” Harry managed to ask.
'Just what was she up to during the war,' Harry thought then, doubting that all this advice was coming from a purely theoretical standpoint. He nodded, doubting that he'd ever have a reason to send a cutting curse at anyone's genitals.
“You didn’t say anything to it?” Mr. Nott asked carefully. “Anything at all?”
“What’s the matter with ghosts?” Harry asked. He wasn’t sure if he’d need to elaborate, but did so anyway: “How come there are ghosts that everybody can see, but then— I mean,
Harry, who hadn't really thought about practice wands before, didn't really care one way or another. Instead he stared at the picture of a man Bellatrix had hung on the wall in front of them. The picture appeared normal in every way - standing still, even, unlike portraits. It resembled the anatomical illustrations that Nott always had around him.
to hear people scream. There was nothing fun about it. Why would someone else screaming in agony be something anyone would want to hear?
“I’m really not,” Harry said. “I’m not perfect at anything, really.”
“These don’t notice everything you need to be aware of,” Bellatrix continued, her red mouth twisting into a grin. “You’re right,” she whispered. “There’s a woman in the box. And a man by the door. And another hanging from the ceiling. I can’t see them anymore, but I know they’re there - I was here when their bodies were put up to dry.”
Malfoy turned back to the cabinet handles, and was quiet for a long time. Harry wondered how busy his social life was, and if Parkinson was still looking to spend as much time with him as possible. Then again, who was he to comment on other people’s possible romantic relationships? He and Ginny were unlikely to reconnect like that again, and there was really no one else in Harry’s life who could fill that gap, was there?
“Seems to have his life sorted out, doesn’t he?” Ron said. “Got work, got studies to take care of. Family alive. Has a way out of everything, like the slippery snake that he is.”
”It’s not like he didn’t do anything to deserve it,” Ron argued. ”It’s not just a handful of insults that he has flung around. And no matter what we did in return, it was nowhere near the bloody mess he pulled when he let in those—”
“I’ll find someone,” Nott promised.
”It’s fine if you want to visit,” Dudley insisted, and Harry could hear a choked sound escape Petunia. Piers was observing the whole situation with the shifty-eyed awkwardness of a person stuck in a scene that was clearly none of their business. Harry walked past him, and headed towards the front door. He didn’t fancy staying any longer - not when Petunia wasn’t feeling sorry in the last.
“—will teach you alongside Nott and I. We will create a schedule for you to follow carefully, with plenty of materials for you to study.”
“Not entirely, though that did play a part in it,” he replied. “The Dark Lord envisioned the world in a way I could resonate with.”
“What about him?”
. To get to this point. To get to a point where Voldemort was well and truly dead. He was dead, wasn’t he? His horcruxes had all been destroyed, his supporters had been revealed, and there was no going back. Ron and Hermione—
Harry looked at Malfoy’s face, really looked at it - the pointy chin and narrow eyes. The thin eyebrows and pink lips. The eyes, a shade so light blue they were almost grey. It was kind of funny how despite years of knowing each other, Harry had never really looked at Malfoy before.
“Well, now you know why I need you here,” Harry said with a laugh, not noticing the blush making its way up Malfoy’s neck, reaching all the way to the tips of his ears. “I need someone to figure out these creative parts of making a home. I mean, I’d be fine with whatever tables and chairs I’d pick, but it’s great to have something… a bit more, you know… nice.”
“Nott must’ve told you,” the woman said. “There’s more to necromancy than raising the dead. It’s a whole different world. It’s a world you’ll need to hear and taste, and your eyes will only burden you. What you did here, now - do it
. His losses were older than that, weren’t they? He had lost the people who were a family to him well before the battle even began, and though Professor Lupin’s death had been a shock and he was sad, he had never been that close to the man.
”What did you expect us to do, then?” Petunia all but shrieked all of a sudden. ”What did you expect from us? Saddled with a freak we didn’t want and didn’t know what to do with! Life wasn’t easy for us either! And God, as soon as you left, you replaced us with... with them! You were
“But painlessly,” Harry said, thinking of Bellatrix. “Just, you know. I mean, I know Bellatrix does things like that for fun and she just… takes a lot of time. She’s told me a lot about the things she did in the war. I don’t want any of that. I don’t want to hurt people.”
“You’re absolutely sure his mother won’t interfere?” Nott asked, eyeing the schedule they had drafted. “Mondays and Wednesdays with me, Tuesdays and Thursdays with Lestrange, Fridays for etiquette and Saturdays with you. How will you explain his sudden absences when they’re this noticeable?”
“Sure,” Harry said, and hurried to follow the other wizard in. The door creaked when it was opened, and the sound was something Aunt Petunia would have never abided by. “I like the noises,” Harry said. “Of the house, I mean.”
”Malfoy,” Harry said aloud, startling the other wizard. Surprisingly, seeing Malfoy wasn’t upsetting at all, and Harry’s past urge to pick a fight with the other wizard every time they crossed paths had disappeared during the war. ”Fancy seeing you here.”
Well, he knew instinctively how to make his father move. He knew what he’d read about what necromancy
“You know,” Harry said, louder this time to catch Malfoy’s attention. “I don’t dislike you. Or resent you, if you have thought that at some point while working on this cottage.”
or stop feeling anxious, but it was easier to tell himself to not think about it with physical distance and so much change around him.
However, there was just… one thing. One little thing that he couldn’t quite shake off, and it’s the same thing that made his thoughts return to his mother’s stomping. Was it truly grief that had made her now turn to Harry and lie quietly in wait? Was it grief that turned her head and had her eyes following him?
“Yes.”
“Keep it that way,” Uncle Tony said. Crabbe almost turned away then, but stopped and said:
“Dreadfully lacking in knowledge, I see,” Nott said, sounding amused. “Necromancy isn’t just Dark - it’s Black Magic. Illegal in most countries, though there are ways around that. Now… there is a popular misconception that necromancy is a question of resurrection. That’s not quite it, as I’m sure you’ve realized. You can animate the body all you want, but the dead will not return.”
”That does make sense,” Hermione agreed. ”Voldemort is dead, and everything we fought so hard for is now done. And Harry had to be the one to... to defeat him. Perhaps he’ll feel better after some food and rest. And a shower. Merlin, those are things we all need, aren’t they?”
"Well, let's see it first," Harry said, and Malfoy pushed the bathroom's door open. It was, well, small. And very, very white. The faucet was black, however, and so was the showerhead and the pipe holding up the curtain separating the bathtub from the rest of the bathroom. It was surprisingly nice, and Harry knew that he wouldn't need much else for himself.
“Merlin, Potter, what does it matter what I think?”
Healer Crabbe didn’t say anything to that, and Harry sighed, trying to think harder about how he was feeling. It was just… so
peace of mind?
“Oh.” Malfoy’s reaction was a barely audible breath, that came with a now somewhat familiar, defensive, mometary hunch of his shoulders, before he straigthened up and seemed to accept whatever had confused him a mere moment earlier. “Very well.”
something.
The silence that followed was almost pleasant, and Harry found himself genuinely not minding Malfoy’s presence. Aside from a few jabs, they hadn’t argued, and the former Slytherin seemed to know what he was doing. It was strange to be on almost friendly terms with the guy, especially after everything that had happened between them. But being in charge of renovating and decorating the cottage seemed to put him into an exceptionally good mood, and Harry really wanted to see more happiness around him.
"I love you," Harry said, all out of nowhere. Draco paused, looking up at him. Harry suddenly wondered if the timing seemed off, or if it was the way he said it, if he shouldn't have said it now. He said it all the time anyway, hadn't thought it would seem so out of place.

Fuck. He shouldn't. He really shouldn't.
"But that is mostly for the sake of my mother. When I'm—" Malfoy halted, suddenly, his jaw working slightly. Harry finally looked up at him. "I would only like for people to be kinder to her if I'm ever not present, that is all." His head lifted, turning, meeting Harry's eyes again. "In return for your favours, I'm willing to offer whatever you ask of me. Whatever."
"You came back."
It’s a strange feeling, to be the only one now who knows of them — to be looking at his face, staring back at him with the dawning of bemusement. It feels like a certain kind of absence.
Somebody else had gotten him a stack of novels. Hermione, he guessed, very easily. Somebody else had gotten him a set of glasses full of beautiful, intricate patterns and a bottle of wine. Somebody else had gotten him a nice, branded pair of shoes. A piece of wall art and decor. A fancy box of art supplies.
"Not terrible," Draco said. He was examining it closely, this way and that, an almost-impressed flick of his brows and downturn of his mouth.
"Given the nature of your relationship, which your
Draco must have already come to a few of these places, because he knew a lot about them, and told Harry all about them too. The camera was often kept on, under the pretense of recording videos of the ancient architecture, or the stunning views from a high rooftop, the top of a tower, the edge near a canal with a few boats sailing on the water. He wondered if Draco could tell that it was on him too a lot of the time. Always trying to catch a laugh or a smile of his.
"What do you think? Parents like ours don't truly care for wants and desires. They care only for duty."
"We can't keep going like this anymore," Harry said, quieter. "This, not working together. Not talking to each other about important things."
(Chapter Nine)
And maybe Harry will really lose him now. He's already lost Draco, and maybe he loses Ron now too, but he wants to say it. As if he is making up for something. As if he is, somehow, choosing Draco now by telling them all, because he realises now he should have taken that risk. He realises now that he loves him more than he is afraid of anything, but now he is gone and all he has are his letters and his drawings and a coin that won't talk back to him, and nothing ever feels right anymore.
This all came to an end when Malfoy one day pushed his arm away with a frustrated noise, grabbed his wrist and pulled them both up to the wall beside the fridge, stepping back into it. He'd slid Harry's hands under his own shirt, put them to himself.
It was jarring, to be falling so naturally for somebody whose life Harry was forced into, who was forced into his. It was jarring, to want somebody who he had once been so sure he would never feel this way for, who he would never be able to have anyway because he could not imagine at all that Draco would want him back. Who Harry was damned to lose for what Draco might learn three years later, all the secrets Harry had kept.
Harry had spoken for him at his trial, had believed him better than his father
"What do you like to eat?"
Harry was utterly clueless about what it was that Malfoy just did.
Ahhh so close to the end, we are!!! One more chapter (and it's all good stuff from here on 🙌)
He sits there, a silent presence, only soothing hands in Potter's hair, over his biceps, his shoulders.
"Come here," she says, drawing him up on the bed next to her by his hand. Draco follows her, settling in front of her.
Harry remembered the legislation passed on Malfoy hours later
"Honestly, Potter. Are you a wizard or what?" The inadvertently similar words reminded him of Ron and Hermione.

After the war, he thought he could never be the kind of person that children should be around, didn't think he would ever know what to do with them when he had been a child with nothing, when war had made his life so grey, but he put himself through healing, learned, and got better, and there is no better way to learn what life is about than to live as witness to such innocence and freedom.
from what Harry had expected. There were papers, books, oddly shaped quills and some objects the boy couldn’t even recognize. Mostly there were maps, though. Maps and maps and even more maps. New and old, big and small, drawn on paper, etched on stone, woven into fabric and into air itself, floating figures like clouds of dust everywhere.
they knew by now that there was no reason to fear him?
Lily had been angry. Angrier than Harry had ever seen her. Right after James’s passing and resurrection, and before things had become
”Harry, how are you feeling?” Hermione asked, and she sounded so concerned that Harry almost managed to respond. To his relief, however, Ron spoke up first.
“You know… you and Nott keep forgetting that I was a Death Eater too, once. You cannot harm me, no matter what you think.”
“Yes,” Harry said. He had been unsure about the money needed for him to do his purchases, but apparently that wouldn’t be an issue – his godfather had kindly offered to pay for everything, as Lily clearly was in no condition to go to Gringotts and allow them entrance into the Potter vault.
Harry left, and took a deep sigh of relief as soon as the door to Nettlewick’s office clicked shut behind him. He looked down at the portfolio the agent had given him, and wasn’t sure what he’d do with it. He could just keep it around, but he really hadn’t liked any of the offers he had seen so far, and—
Harry nodded, hating what he was hearing, and hating even more that he also didn’t think his mother would ever return to how she used to be.
It took Harry nearly three weeks to finally visit Privet Drive. Unsurprisingly, nothing about the street had changed. The houses, neatly in a row, were untouched and just as they had been eight years ago before Harry's departure to Hogwarts. The Dursleys’ house was painfully familiar with its tidily trimmed green hedge, the tulips and pansies growing in the front garden, and the small wooden shed near the tree peeking from the back. It all made Harry stop and stare for a moment, feeling a strange ache in his chest. It was clear that the Dursleys had been quick to move in a reoccupy their house, now probably erasing any trace of Harry having ever lived with them.
Malfoy made a noise of annoyance, before gesturing for Harry to get up. “They left. The fireplace is now connected to the Floo system, so you can name this place whenever you feel like it. The renovations are more or less done now, so only decorating is left. Do you have any ideas regarding that?”
“You’re always welcome to visit us here, James would love your company despite how quiet he’s been lately,” Lily said, smiling a little. “Harry’s been like that too. Really quiet.” Harry hunched his shoulders and hid further behind Uncle Tony. He didn’t want Lily to see him.
The questions continued. They were easy for Harry to answer, but made him feel all the more nervous because of it. He couldn’t begin to guess what Healer Crabbe thought about him, but at least… at least it was comforting to know that the man wouldn’t be able to share whatever conclusions he got from anywhere else.
“Of course,” the woman nodded, smiling warmly at Harry. She then reached for a drawer, and after a moment picked up a strangely short wand that she then handed to the boy. “We use this for
“—and James kept telling me that I should owl you but we know how busy you are, so we didn’t.”
”Mum?” someone said hesitantly from the hallway, startling both Harry and Petunia. A few seconds later Dudley walked in, with Piers Polkiss of all people trailing behind him. Dudley’s eyes darted from his mother to Harry, before he offered a hesitant smile to his cousin. ”Harry. It’s... it’s good to see that you’re all right.”
It was funny, perhaps, in some way, that it wasn’t long after his encounter with Petunia that Harry bumped into Draco Malfoy.
“All that is normal for someone with your background,” Healer Crabbe continued. “However, it being normal doesn’t mean that you can’t change it or overcome it. And that is where our discussions come into play. We can start this session slowly, test the waters, and see how you feel about it. Nothing you say in this room will ever be repeated to anyone else outside of it, including your godfather.”
standing at the doorway.
Anyway. Slowburn Drarry. Is it a romcom or a horror story? Who the fuck knows.
“Yes,” Uncle Tony said, voice sharp and impatient. “I saw that he wasn’t in his room. How about you and James spend the day together? I will take Harry to Diagon Alley to enjoy his day there.”
Because little Harry knew he could.
That… that sounded pretty accurate. Harry had already felt all that when he’d first met Ellis and Bellatrix.
, his mother had said
Malfoy’s voice behind him caused Harry to turn. The other wizard had rolled his sleeves up to his elbows, and his wand was tucked into some sort of a holster at his hip. “Why are you outside?”
“I guess I’m just happy to have one less person hating me,” Harry said, shrugging. “I went to Privet Drive a few weeks ago, you know. I… I don’t know why I thought that anything would be different. Petunia still hates me. I thought I’d find closure, but… Merlin, that was not it at all. So I suppose that maybe having now a better relationship with Malfoy is making up for that disappointment.”
“There are many ways to do that.”
He didn’t have a home to return to, and he couldn’t stay forever at the Burrow. Not after Fred and George had— Not when the Weasleys were grieving like this. And, well, Ron and Hermione were clearly planning on going to Australia to look for Hermione’s parents, and Harry didn’t want to impose. Not when Ron and Hermione had had barely any time to spend together, without anyone else intruding. It wasn’t as if they had said anything, but Harry knew that they were too nice to do so. Especially with how worried they were about him.
“That is physical necromancy,” Nott said. “There is also spiritual necromancy, that calls the spirits of the dead. It’s… advanced and harder to control. It can easily lead to terrible, lasting haunting. Magnus Malfoy from the fifteen-hundreds notoriously died after a lasting haunting had driven him to suicide.”
it was Lily - was screaming.
“Students at Hogwarts share sleeping areas with their classmates in every single House,” Crabbe explained, having seen the confusion on Harry’s face. “I assumed you knew of this?”
”Honestly, all I want is to just... sort out... my life?” Harry admitted, the end of his sentence more of a question than a statement of intent. ”I don’t think I can focus on... classes and essays. Not right now, I mean. Nor after the summer. I just need to... sort myself out before I can do anything. I could take my NEWTs at some point, after studying on my own, but I... I don’t think I can stay.” Not after everything that had happened. Not when there were so many bad memories mixed with the good ones, at every corner of the castle.
He didn’t know how much time had passed with him hiding under his bed, too afraid to move or let out a sound. He dared to peek from under his bed, once, and saw that Lily
“There’s someone under the floorboards,” Harry said, his heart beating fast. “There’s someone else by the door. And a woman in the box. There’s a
Harry hadn’t ever been to a chapel before, but he’d seen pictures.
Creatures, however, knew better than to come near.
“This isn’t stone,” Harry said, touching the wall. It was firm and solid, rough to the touch, and yet he could tell it wasn’t made of stone.
“I’d suggest not testing that theory,” Uncle Tony said. “I’d hate for you to become an entirely avoidable casualty.”
“Well, if we’re done here for today,” Nott said, “I’ll take my leave. Potter – I’ll see you on Monday. Dolohov… we’ll keep in touch.”
eyes, though there were no indications of surprise or disapproval or— or
And— and he’d been right. She had been waiting for him quietly, all this time. What did she want? She could’ve easily found him under his bed - why didn’t she, if she wanted him?
Feather duster. It made Harry think of Aunt Petunia. Petunia. How was she doing? How soon would someone tell them that they could move back? This time without Harry. She’d be so happy to hear that, for sure. She never did like him. Harry wasn’t
”I did, yes,” Harry said. ”It needs a bit of fixing, which Malfoy offered to do. Said it’s his responsibility to have the house properly renovated before selling it to me.”
, and that something was
“Not really a difficult standard to exceed, that.”
Then again - who was? No one could be trusted, could they?
“I’m Caspar Crabbe,” the man said, as if he hadn’t been introduced already. “I’m a Healer at St. Mungo’s, where I work most of the time as a psychotherapist. I specialize in long-term treatment of children, teens, and young adults from alternative family backgrounds.”
“Well then,” Healer Crabbe started, gesturing for Harry to take a seat. “I know this may feel strange or awkward to you - that’s perfectly normal. I don’t think anyone knows how to talk about themselves when they know they’re being listened to. Not right away anyway.”
“Maybe not,” Harry agreed, “but it’s better than nothing, right?” Because even these small improvements mattered, and he wasn’t going to overlook his budding, hopefully not entirely one-sided, friendship with Malfoy.
Harry wasn’t sure if he really understood what was at play here, but also doubted that Nott could give him a better answer than the one he had already received. So he simply nodded, and refocused on the cadaver. He tried to muster up a smile, feeling sorry for the invisible pain of the body on the table.
“Wrong,” Ellis shot back. “As a necromancer he’ll need a balanced mind even more than the average person. Training a child’s endurance and ridding him of naivety is different from making him live a traumatizing childhood that could fracture his mind and leave him open and vulnerable to any attacks.”
," Narcissa whispers, her voice wavering. Her breaths are beginning to race in her emotion. "Do you
But Potter has shown him all his scars, has told the story behind each one, has been vulnerable with him more than once, and maybe it should be easier to talk about his own now.
? The great mystery was so bloody anticlimactic and underwhelming that Harry wanted to bash his head against a wall. He couldn't even Disapparate out of here due to the wards.
Harry frowned. "Doesn't look like an easy spell."
Draco sees Remus Lupin in the child's face. He hasn't seen Nymphadora closely enough to say much about her. But his nose is the same as Andromeda's, certainly.
Malfoy shrugged. "Neither do I."
Malfoy's lips pressed together slightly for a second, his feeble breaths pushing out through the very small part of them. He shook his head, a minute gesture.
The first time she saw Draco with Luna, she'd eyed him bemusedly and asked,
"Did you ever, um… find somebody else?" Harry asks him, after a while.
Potter doesn't leave. He slides off the mattress, and instead settles down beside his bed on the floor. He adjusts on his legs, his chin cushioned on his arm, and then begins to talk. His voice is quiet and rough with lingering slumber, the sound of soft kisses, of wild dancing and unbridled laughter filling his head.
He told him everything there, in his dreams. There was nothing he felt he couldn't say to him there, but maybe that was also because it was never things like these. It was all the little things like an exhausting day, an annoying encounter, a funny and ridiculous interaction. It was never things like these.
Harry swallowed, and laid back down. He followed the rhythm of the rise and fall of Draco's body, not able to fall back asleep.
Malfoy." Potter picks up something and holds it out to him. "I do know you like this a lot."
The children greet him in a loud chorus, drawing it out the way they do,
But Potter's expression is wrecked anyway. "Merlin, Malfoy, I'm..."
But Draco comes back a quarter of an hour later, takes his place beside him again, saying,  "I don't know what
Draco let out a breath of amusement, a slight smile, a little to himself. He shook his head, broke his gaze away from him to look down at his flowers again, his leather-gloved fingers brushing a little over them.
And then Malfoy slid off his chair, dropped to one trouser-clad knee in front of Harry, and held up the silver ring between his fingers. Harry felt the eyes of the fifteen other patrons on them, and he huddled into himself under their scrutiny, his face and his body burning and sweaty. Malfoy was looking up at him from beneath his eyelashes, his face shaped into one of hope, silver eyes painfully tender, his grin small and painfully tender, his face flushed with it. Harry had to give it to the bastard, he was good at making it look real.
Harry did not walk through.
"I can make up something about that, if you want. Maybe have an interview with Xenophillius and—"
Malfoy holding the door open for Harry. Check.
Draco was looking over the mess on his table, settling on a holder full of vials. He picked out one full of something faded and prussian blue.
Draco only met his eyes silently, red-rimmed and hollow. Harry moved in to kiss him again—
their only source of good feelings, in order to compensate for its lack.
Potter stands up, and makes his way over, taking his face in his feather-light hands.
Draco shook his head. "No. I'm alright watching."
"Right. Well." He cleared his throat. He let his hands fall to his sides, moving towards Harry. "Well, I will need you to do whatever you can, as much as you can, to show people that you are amicable and fond of Mother and
"You don't have to worry about me, Mother."
"Well. I think you were alright where you were." Draco leans back on the booth, resting a wrist on the tabletop. "Nobody wants to be second to some nonexistent version of themselves. I know I wouldn't. And... " Quieter, "And I wasn't in a place to be good for you back then either."
"You were the one with a lot more at stake, weren't you? You couldn't have said anything, because what if I rejected you, and made everything worse? Or maybe you wouldn't have been able to believe me because of how weird this bond made everything or you'd think you forced me into
"They deserve to know," Harry said, moving out of the kitchen with him. "The people that love you."
Malfoy had spent a good five minutes arguing with him about that too, because
"Hello," Malfoy said to the guard, who was eyeing the guest list in her hand. She flicked up a quick glance up at him, cocking an eyebrow. Her gaze was stuck for a moment on Harry, almost as if she was wondering if she was mistaken, before she shook her head and looked down at the list, clearly concluding that she was.
"Settle down with your mother bear tendencies, you all. I only want to speak to him for a moment," Malfoy drawled with a roll of his eyes, when he noticed their suspicious stares. "I promise I will give him back in one piece."
Smith is yelling again, shoving at him
Potter laughs, and Draco's heart kicks up further into a storm for a whole minute after. "I can't argue with that." He turns to glance at Draco, stilling to eye him in a curious and studious sort of way.
"I'm sure the two of you won't mind being placed in the VIP section?" She smiled brightly, looking to Harry with an even brighter gaze. He nodded awkwardly, and then shook his head awkwardly when the phrasing registered in his mind.
It's dangerous, to have been so embarrassingly obvious.
"You don't really like me though, do you?" Harry says. No point walking around it.
A smile twitched at Harry's cheek. He quickly looked down at Teddy, brushing his fingers through his bright blue hair to occupy himself. He was the most unmoving Harry had ever seen him be, enthralled as he watched his own little toes being coloured in.
Draco questions momentarily if he's only wasting his time speaking to her about any of this.
But then, little by little, it begins to fall away, and it becomes easy to be with him again, and Harry doesn't get sweaty hands anymore when he takes Draco's, not out of nervousness anyway. He doesn't constantly doubt himself and wonder if Draco likes what he's doing, despite Draco seeming fairly open, if moderate in his reactions — does he like it when Harry kisses him on the cheek when they're alone, trails another two down his jaw and neck when he's particularly excited to be with him? Does he like it when Harry grabs him by the waist and kisses him like he's always dreaming through classes of doing? Does he mind that Harry's hands are sweaty and hot when he holds his and that he sometimes laughs a bit too much at everything because Draco makes him nervous and warm from his chest to his face?
Harry pulled away slightly from his mouth. "Wait, you thought…?"
Draco shoves the hands off, shoves at a body in the dark, frantic and desperate and blind. He gasps for air, his throat hoarse and raw. His brain is foggy, his body languid and heavy, exhaustion making him all numb and drowsy. Then there's light, a face coming into his vision through the pinch in his gaze, through the blur and grit, his chest heaving. Slowing.
"Sorry I'm late," Harry said, attempting to alert him of his arrival. Malfoy's head snapped up at the sound of his voice. He hopped up to his feet, dusting down the front of his dark grey suit, which looked far too fancy for whatever this was going to be.
them. I know them only as facts, and they no longer feel any more real than mere dreams. So they have no hold over me."
"Gin," Harry says, shakes his head with an incredulous laugh. "Gin, I don't need you to be anything. I just need you to be — to be you, whoever that is right now. You don't have to be anything else."
Harry dreamed in a delirius haze, falling in and out of a faint awareness of himself, of a feather-light brush over his hand, upturned on something soft
"Hiraeth," Hermione says softly.
"Don't stop on my account, Potter," Draco lies back down on the grassy embankment, ignoring his question. "Keep on wandering."
And then the stage lit up, bright sparks and glows of light all over as coloured smoke permeated the air. The band went wild, jumping all over with their instruments and banging their heads and bodies to the music, as the guitar and drums start up, a hard and fast rhythm and riff raffs that have the entire crowd cheering loudly, others behind Malfoy jumping and dancing. Malfoy cupped his hands around his grin and whooped with such passion and joy that he had to bend slightly at the abdomen, knees crouching down by the force of it. The golden sunlight glittered down on him, caught in the silver of his crinkling eyes and platinum hair, making him all golden too.
He closes his eyes, his heart stretching taut, aching. He tries not to think about it.
, I believe telling him of the true reality of the outcome would jeopardise, and make artificial, any attempts at creating a good marriage
Harry closes the box quickly, closing his eyes, putting the back of a hand to his quivering mouth. He opens his trunk and fits it inside with all his things and the drawings and the notes.
He makes a hazy walk back to his own dorm. The entire commons is emptied of people by now, who have all gone to the Great Hall. Neville is the only one there, waiting for him.
"Good, you didn't run away. Well, you didn't tell me what you wanted, so I brought a bit of everything, fresh out of the kitchens." Potter drops down in front of him, next to his outstretched feet. He begins to lay it out on the little space beside Draco. Two roast beef and corn sandwiches, crumpets, caramel pudding and treacle tarts. "I missed breakfast, and I'm famished, so without further ado, please, your Highness..." He waves a hand at the set-up with a brandish.
"Are you sure?" Ron asked.
"Bloody hell, you'd have to be a certain level of fucked up to do
"So, in short, Ron and I got on fairly quick. It took time to get used to Hermione, especially for Ron, but here we are."
"Right," Ron said. He glanced over in the same direction Harry was looking a few seconds ago. "So, um. You and Malfoy…"
"What the hell was that?" Harry asked, eyes widened slightly.
"Showing off those beautiful abs!" George came in from behind them, even though he wasn't even a part of the conversation, all flushed and grinning. Then he was sitting down on the opposite arm of the couch, looking at Draco, saying something to him with a smirk, gesturing at Harry.
Malfoy was silent, and suddenly the kitchen was leaden, the air heavier than before. He had a rigid expression, sitting back in his chair as he met Harry's eyes, just as cold.
"Ah, come on, 'Mione, that's
Harry blinks, realizing the tension that's seeped into his body, inexplicably. He forces himself to relax. "I'm not. I just… you're bombarding me with all these questions, and it's catching me off guard. Just... what are you even trying to say anyway?"
It was only about a second after that he began to feel graceless and uncouth for his behaviour, seeing the look on Potter's face. There is an entire history of him acting graceless and uncouth with Potter, but in all that history, Potter had only ever snapped back, had only ever gotten fired up and wild.
Draco spread his hand out in a quick shrug of a gesture, an opening of his fingers before curling again. One elbow was on the arm of the couch. His drink was in his other hand, the sprawled arm, the tumbler held loose from the top. "What you're painting. Beauty? Someone you love?" There sounded an underlying wryness to it.
"Don't talk, Potter," was what Malfoy responded with. He looked flustered, sort of annoyed, not looking at him. "Don't think about it either."
"You're here early," Harry said, jostling Teddy a bit in his arms. "I thought you were going to have classes today?"
"Mother?" Draco's hand is already twisting the doorknob and pushing it open, and then he's inside the room, and he's kneeling in front of her. Narcissa is hunched over, her face buried in her hands. Her shoulders are quivering, but the sobs have stopped abruptly as soon as he'd entered.  "Tell me what's wrong."
"Would you like anything? Water? Tea?"
Draco finds Harry quiet at the edge of the lake.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked, sleepily frowning.
Draco does, a flick of a glance. "I know." He clears his throat, clears his voice. "But still. It should not have happened."
"Why'd you buy it then?"
Draco looks at him, a hushed and unfathomable stare. Harry works his lower lip, turns his head away. A few seconds after, Draco digs around in the bag one-handed and throws him a box of treacle tarts.
Maybe it's his voice, the way Harry finds Draco's voice comforting on his sleepless nights. Maybe it's Harry. Just Harry. Something about that thought makes his heart hurt.
suspicious," Ron said.
"We can talk to each other on this," Harry says. He hands Draco one of the Galleons. "It's charmed so that if we say each other's names, it turns on, and we'll be the only ones to hear each other."
It took him a while to fall asleep, the guilt sinking deep in his chest, and yet, unable to bring himself to go back down and face Draco. He felt out of control, off-kilter and embarrassed. He felt angry, still, only this time it was turned inward. He tussled in his bed a bit, fell into an uneasy sleep in what must be ten minutes later.
"Why, making another painting of me?" Draco said, a small, amused smirk at a corner of his mouth.
Harry floundered for something to say, sick to his throat with his own riot of emotions, his own fear. He looked down at the wood tiles instead, just sat there and stared at nothing with him. Draco's breaths shuddered next to him, low in his chest, a controlled exhale.
* * *
"Thank you," he says, hoarsely. Neville nods at him.
"You have ink on your face," Harry said, instead.
It's not the way he turns, with a face so lovely and hesitant, a hint of a smile mellow at the corner of his mouth. Harry nearly smiles back at him, pushed out of him like the breath stuck heavy and painful in his throat, stops himself. They tumble in his chest, slow and unsteady — love and longing, all the years of them long and old, burning afresh up to the base of his throat.
Draco's face is that of somebody not understanding a thing, but still trying very hard to humour him. "And that is?"
Harry doesn't say anything for a few seconds. Then, "I don't know."
"Nope. So, tell me, Harry, the rest of the view in those places was probably just background, wasn't it? Or, should I say,
* * *
Harry was watching him with a small quirk at one corner of his lips, roving over his face. Draco was so focused on fixing him up that he didn't notice it, and he let himself almost forget, for this moment, how he had ruined him and how angry Draco was for it.
Ginny smiles at Harry. "Teddy was just asking for you." She nods at Teddy in Ron's arms. He has his little, baby-pudged fingers in his mouth, his chin covered in drool. Upon catching sight of Harry, his face goes beaming with a gummy grin, his eyes turned green like his own. "You're the favourite today, so you might have to keep him with you tonight."
of places?"
"I wanted to discuss some details about the gala."
Malfoy nodded, relaxing dramatically.
"Don't you wish you could be up here, playing against these Gryffindor wankers, Draco?" Potter's voice is loud, trying to be heard over the chatter and noise and winds.
In the quiet of the night, Harry wonders of Hermione, of how she is. He misses her deeply, just as Ron does, even though they've both been rather terrible at returning her owls. However, she needs the time with her parents after having them regain their memories of her so recently. There's only a few weeks left now until they meet again at the Hogwarts Express.
"I want to see them."
and he remembered Draco saying,
One day, Draco forgets to bring himself clothes into a shower at night, comes out to move quickly for his room—and runs right into Blaise.
There was no sound of bustling around in the kitchen when he went downstairs. It was completely quiet, but for the chirps of birdsong outside
next to silly and exaggerated animations of a little doodle Harry’s mannerisms upon waking. They capture his sleepy frown, and the way he yawns and stretches his legs and back out while lying — things he’s never noticed of himself until now. He smiles down at it, scrubbing a hand through his hair, still sitting half-tangled amidst sheets.
They walk a few paces down the corridor, and then turn a corner. They pass by several crowds of students, all of them watching Harry, murmuring, some girls giggling. Ron shifts in line with him, as if to keep him from their disconcerting line of vision.
Hermione laughed, the bridge of her nose wrinkling up with it, and Ron threw his NEWTs results at him and called him a tit, but it didn't reach Harry's face, instead floating down unimpressively to the floor. Hermione would have been annoyed by it, usually, but even she seemed to have enough alcohol in her system to be relaxed about mistreatment of results parchments. They all watched it go down, snorting into another small fit, warm and woozy from the wine.
Ron eyes Neville across the booth at The Three Broomsticks. "So you're sharing a room with Malfoy." He grimaces. "Er. How's that going?"
There's a sketch of a ferret, a ghastly one, but it's upturned whiskery-nose and flat mouth is somewhat evident, and so is its slicked back hair, looking like a wig plopped on top of its head.
The thing is that it can be so very easy. All he has to do is tell Draco, and he is his. But his feelings are muddled, difficult to decipher, and he's never tried very hard to understand these things, especially the more complicated and nuanced. He's never known how to. And he is still trying to process the idea that there's been something that has been a part of him for a long time, but he hadn't known it was until now. The way he'd thought of Oliver Wood sometimes, and Cedric Diggory. Draco Malfoy, fascinated by him half of his life.
, and he goes even pinker. But he turns away and clears his throat, facing Matthew again.
"Sorry," Harry said, thick, as he drew back to try and hide his face. He quickly swiped the back of a hand over his cheeks, under his nose. "I'm sorry."
Ginny always said on everybody's birthdays, and Teddy getting a small dollop on cream on his nose, which had him giggling.
Draco steps back, turning around, and fades into the crowds.
She blinks awake to the stirring of his numbed hand. When she sees his opened eyes, she straightens, the side of her hair tousled. "Draco?" She quickly climbs up onto the bed beside him, leaning her head over him and running her fingers through his hair. The relief on her face is painfully tangible. "Thank Circe you're awake."
whileatwiltshire: my alphareader and beloved friend, who has read through this story at its WORST over a course of months, and was still so patient and supportive and kind. You have helped me so much through this by letting me discuss this fic with you, always giving me such in-depth and thoughtful answers to all my concerns and questions, breaking me out of my writer's block with all your suggested scenes and ideas. Probably would have been lost in that mess if it weren't for you
How much of a help could they be, seeing as they'd needed curse breakers' aid to determine anything?
Draco swallowed, his red-rimmed eyes glistening. His brows twitched into a doleful frown, chin crumpling, only dangling on the edge of breaking.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry thought of those beads in his hair, like fairy lights, Harry's latest painting of him. He liked his hair now too, just a bit shorter, still easy to tuck behind his ears, but trimmed up to rest just at the top of the nape of his neck. Not that Draco would care about that.
The fourth time had Harry straighten up. "Er, excuse me?"
"I'm still," Harry whispers. "so terribly mad over you."
They entered the kitchens bustling with house-elves, and there was a table in the distant corner, already set up with various kinds of foods. Harry tried to think of what else Malfoy could have been doing here, besides getting this ready (which was weird on its own, to think Malfoy would be going to such lengths to arrange a meal with Harry of all people), but he couldn't think of anything.
he writes. Harry puts them all in his box full of Draco's love.
Draco didn't spare him much of a glance or a word beyond, "Yes."
Harry strokes a thumb over the side of his hand, outlines the brown against light skin, curled together on his knee.
And they didn't talk about it, or think about it much, on Harry's part. That was a pitfall of mortification and fear and confusion that Harry did not want to fall into, once he'd fallen enough times. It was the curse, Harry reminded himself often, and Malfoy never spoke of it either. Neither of them were in a position to use this shameful vulnerability against the other.
Malfoy smiled then, soft and pleasant and his silver eyes crinkling, and Harry was startled, as was his heart. "Drink?"
He wakes up in the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey hovering above him, a furrow between her brows.
They took a room that was once his and slept in its bed, just because they could. Greyback was one of them.
Other times, it's only him and Luna together, having a stroll on the grounds of Hogwarts or edging around the skirts of the forests, where she teaches him wandless magic or where they sit together near a lake or a pond and create ripples in the water. Some days he  spends a fair amount of time searching for her things with her, which she claims have run off to explore the world and
There were memories, scattered through their school years, easy moments by the Great Lake, snow fights in Hogsmeade, and a Yule Ball dream that rang like a familiar story — Harry tripping over his feet, the two of them dancing — and Harry remembered Draco telling him about it, only he didn't know then what he truly meant
Hello!
"I wouldn't call it a date. And not really," Harry said. "Bit of a piece of work."
"It's alright. It's in the past now," Draco says, reading his remorse. "I left, didn't I. It's her you ought to
A blind jolt of terror woke Harry in the middle of the night. He blinked, rapid and hard through the grit of slumber in his eyes, trying to see. He breathed, trying to settle down his heart. There was no solid press of a back against his chest.
Neville drinks a sip of his butterbeer. "How am I doing sharing a room with my former bully, you mean?"
"Whatever, Potter. If you want to sit here and stare at nothing for several hours on end next to my bed-bound body again, suit yourself."
* * *
Harry finally managed to pull the heavy robe off his shoulder and arm, tugging a little. "So?"
Something in Harry gave at that, only half-aware of the sense that maybe he would have anyway, that he was only just waiting for a reason. He ignored ever having the thought, ever feeling terribly filthy, and pulled Malfoy in by the back of his knees, one after the other, Malfoy falling closer, pressing against him, gasping.
Harry feels suffocated with himself. "I could have done a lot more, anyway. I'm sorry I didn't."
There was a tingle in Harry's throat. He swallowed it down. He didn't want to say it, and thinking about it made his breaths climb up his throat, heavy and painful. It made his face go numb, and his hand trembled, tightening around Draco's shirt, clutching him just a bit closer.
generally considered stalking if you noticed that nearly the only thing your victim ate that year was caramel pudding."
Sometimes it was visible, running bright and sharp through him in tremors. Other times it just made him go lax against Harry, quiet in his arms except for his shallow and slow breaths against his neck. Harry couldn't tell which was worse.
"You alright?" he asked, settling an arm around Hermione beside him. They'd gathered in chairs by the fireplace, after Harry had casted the cleaning charms on his face.
"Oh." Harry grew warm and flustered. He wasn't sure how he didn't catch the sarcasm, but then again, could he be blamed? He had thought there was no way it could have been as simple as
Harry thinks that could just as well be due to Headmistress McGonagall's wrath in the aftermath. Smith's gotten off with a final warning, and any further strikes will result in immediate expulsion. He has also been banned from Hogsmeade trips for the rest of the year and will be serving detention until Christmas Holidays.
"Did you write back?" Harry asked.
Harry pulled him closer with the flat of his forearm against Draco's spine, kissing the corner of his mouth, pushed a lock of his hair back behind an ear and pressed a small, chaste kiss to his lips. There was a very imperceptible twitch of a smile in his sleep. Harry laughed softly, overcome by an overwhelming riot of emotions. He wanted to kiss him all over, hold him so close to himself there was nothing between them, love him without an inhale. He ran his other hand down his side over his shirt, settling still at his hipbone in the curl of a grip, all of it, like a habit now. There was a lingering need, even now, to ease pain where there was no longer pain, now just left with the phantoms of his built up instincts, following along to it.
"I think I'm quite close," Draco was saying, busied and distracted. Harry watched him work, pouring vials into the cauldron, adding ingredients to it that Harry couldn't even name. "Should only be another few weeks now."
Draco eyed him, in that studious sort of way he did sometimes. Then, there was a flicker at a corner of his lips, a slight half-smile. He hummed, softly. "Perhaps."
But he isn't all there, and he isn't the same.
In the dark was a silhouette, leaning heavily against the doorframe for a moment. That sickly pull in his chest had a direction now, focusing in on it. It wasn't an urge, anything forceful, only a mere sense, there, towards the body — Malfoy, stumbling towards him, tripping over when he reached the bed.
"I found you unconscious, is what happened." Harry's lips were parted, working around things he couldn't say. He could feel himself stalling, unable to pull the words of what he'd learned last night. "What… what do you remember?"
The name said out loud left a pang in his chest, even years later, briefly snatching the air away from his lungs. Malfoy had gone silent and solemn too, a far cry from the boy that once ruthlessly brought up Cedric's death in an insensitive manner.
Harry thinks, the letter between his hands.
Harry looked back at him. There was something brimming in his eyes, beneath the illness keeping them worn.
Draco was staring down at the bar, his chest heaving, as if trying to collect himself, pondering on something intensely. Harry thought he would ignore him, once more, but he shook his head after a while, still frowning.
"You were, um… " Harry gestures vaguely, at a loss yet again. He swallows around the throb of his own erratic heart, the turmoil of his feelings that made him feel tender under his skin all over. "You were going to say something."
really are."
He spent much of the next several days angry and despairing for his future. He drank himself into stupor on the weekends, his dour mood following him with his hangover the next morning.
Ron picks up his books, shoving them into his bags. Hermione's eye twitches at his brutal treatment of them. "You haven't sat with us at meals for ages, Harry, so you're not disappearing wherever you go off to without us this time!"
Draco huffed, smirking slightly. His head shifted against Harry's shoulder, his hair all a mess against it. "I know you. Wouldn't want you to spend the rest of your life thinking about… about poor old me."
Some people in the comments pointed out the role reversal in the fic, where it was Draco who remembered the dreams alone and now it's Harry, and I was just mindblown because what a COOL CATCH - I didn't realise this, thank you for that!! I used that concept a bit in this chapter!
"You said it some way."
"You cut your hair," Harry said.
All he could think about were the months they still had ahead of them, before the curse would break.
, growing smaller and smaller.
"Do you know why your father was desperate enough to risk his life in order to escape the Aurors, Draco?" Narcissa asks softly.
Okay, no. What. The fuck.
The billow of relief loosening a knot in Harry's chest, that he hadn't entirely noticed was there, was somewhat jarring and confusing. Harry didn't know what he was so worried about, why Malfoy locking himself up in his dorm room alone had him somewhat strangely anxious, but Harry hadn't even realized just
"But you don't owl her back," Harry said, more a statement than a question.
He can't say what it is more, that he forces it out or that it is forced out of him.
"If we don't find you, Molly's going to hex us! If not her, then your grandmum! What are we going to do, Teddy?"
A quick, frantic stock of Draco's appearance told Harry that he was alright, other than perhaps an erratic and weakened magic. He was staring off into the middle distance, not seeming to see much of anything.
They were asked several questions, some too personal,
Draco still seemed fairly confused by this.
And all of it was falling together into place, and the missing piece had always been this: Draco had been in love with him for a very long time.
"I'm awake," Draco responds.
"I can't even imagine what those fucking bastards did to…" he says, shaky, still with his fingers on his skin.
