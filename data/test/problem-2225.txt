I had to do some research into Jane Austen and finally discovered our library shamefully lacking in her works. I endeavour to remedy that. If you have any more recommendations, I would welcome them, since there seems to be an entire literary world I was deprived from due to my strict upbringing.
and filled to the brim with unspoken words. It’s ridiculous and over-dramatic, and Harry blames this tendency to produce random prose on Draco.
“Yes, yes, that is exactly what a good friend would have done,” Blaise insists, once again trying to corrupt them all into courting Pansy’s wrath. His theory is that Pansy cannot possibly punish them all, which is naive and rather offensively underestimates Pansy’s talent and stubbornness.
“Fascinating, good for them. I have no idea what you just said, or why you told me any of this because, frankly, I never wanted to know about your brother’s sex life, either.” Harry thinks he’s covered all the bases here, said all that there is to say. Plus, he made Ron laugh, which is always a good sign.
made a situation better, the weird muggle birds that can’t even fly. Pansy, however, looks as scandalised as if Draco just insulted her mother’s much praised and wildly admired rose garden.
, of course, but Draco decides to led it slide. Besides, Potter clearly enjoyed that, Draco doesn’t need to see the blissed-out smile to know that.
What matters is Potter laying next to him, laughing in the warm light and curling into Draco, his body warm and hands brave as they wander over Draco, seeking for purchase and clinging tight once they found it, wrapped around Draco’s waist and wound in his hair.
Before Draco can make up his mind on that one (whether it would be horribly cowardly and if he cares even if it is), Potter saunters into the kitchen as if he owns it. Which, technically, he does. But it was
Granger nudges Weasley up from his pout, until he is standing on what are indeed goat legs. Interesting. She nudges him again, neighing in laughter as he falls back into the river, spluttering and flailing around wildly despite how shallow the waters are.
Draco stares at Harry as if he grew a second head, bewildered and a little bit intrigued, keeping his distance just to be safe. Harry understands, he didn't mean to get preaching, seriously, but family is a sensitive topic for him. Draco knows that, it's the whole reason he brought it up, so really, he only has himself to blame himself for this one.
“Oh for — look at me.” Malfoy doesn’t, perhaps only to be contrary and difficult, but Harry doesn’t have the patience for either of these things. Blindly he gropes for Malfoy’s head, getting lucky surprisingly quickly, and taking his face into his hands to pull them closer together, bridging the darkness between them just a tiny bit. “I don’t actually hate you.”
, because they are already married, so whatever vengeful god could possibly curse them for their happiness is far too late. Harry thought it stupid the moment Hermione idly mentioned it, one of many old rituals and traditions she read up on and thought might interest them, but Draco liked the idea, and Harry likes Draco, and the matter was decided. Of course, that was before Harry knew he would be physically unable to sleep on his own.
“Sorry darling, there are several reasons this isn’t going to work for me. First off, these scones are store bought, not even the bakery I like.” Pansy ignores Draco’s offended gasp, talking over him like his outage doesn’t matter.
“I always win, darling. Now hurry up, I want ice cream.” Draco tugs Potter further away from the loud fans, loitering to discuss the game. Usually, Draco might be interested in joining them, really rubbing salt into the wound that is Potter’s loss, but he misses the intimacy they had when everyone was focused on the game and the world consisted of only the two of them.
Draco cannot let this happen. Yes, he is hurt and yes, he decided to leave and return with a clear head, but he can’t leave Potter like this. Draco is here to save Potter, he can do it one more time before leaving. He won’t even have to talk to the man.
to each other, let alone trust, but that Harry took this long to notice. He would have expected to smell a mystery sooner, and Malfoy is horrible at keeping them, anyway, getting all self-important and shifty when he fancies himself to be the only person in the room to be in the know. Harry should have noticed.
Draco is debating if it would be very impertinent of him to rut against Potter’s leg until he, too, comes—because Draco is still hard, so painfully hard, but it would be rude and that wasn’t part of the deal, Draco’s pleasure wasn’t what they agreed on—when Potter’s lips quirk into a lazy grin and his eyes flutter open.
“Surprised to see you here. What, did Parkinson throw you to the side to make more space for Ron and Hermione?” Harry isn’t bitter, he might sound it but he
“Enough already, Malfoy, are you in or not?” Potter looms over him, pressing Draco back into the couch without so much as touching him. Potter leans close enough that Draco can make out the freckles on his skin, the gold specks in his eyes.
likes better than a new failure of habitation they can report on, and Grimmauld delights in delivering the newspaper first thing in the morning, regardless of Harry not having a subscription. Hermione calls it fascinating, Ron begrudgingly admires their dedication, and Harry simply calls it an uninspired act of petulance and sets every single copy he gets aflame.
“You are doing that wrong,” Draco says almost out of instinct, against every resolve not to draw attention to himself.
Harry isn’t on the other side of the door.  He is out there, hiding. That is the only chance he has left, to hide from the light and what it does to him. To hide from the teeth and the claws and the eyes, the eyes that are everywhere and see everything.
Draco didn’t have high expectations, didn’t think the words a key phrase that open a secret door or even for actual hair to be thrown at them, but for
“Yeah, that one. Turns out he wasn’t cheating so I didn’t have to make him regret ever leaving Romania. They have… an arrangement, I guess you could call it. An open relationship, because Charlie is ace and doesn’t often want sex, and Lucas does want it, and, apparently, grows cranky when he doesn’t get laid regularly. Which, trust me, is more than I wanted to know about my brother’s sex life, ever. But they figured something out that allows them both to get as much or as little sex as they want while staying together. It wasn’t easy, but they love each other, so they made it work.” Ron nods, done with his little advertisement for open relationships (is that a
—” Draco is gesticulating widely, glaring at the coffeemaker as if it personally betrayed him. Which is ridiculous, Harry doesn’t think Draco has been burned even once by the thing, while Harry seriously contemplated getting all his coffee from overpriced coffee-shops when Grimmauld proved to be without mercy, going so far as to deny him his caffeine without paying for it with burned fingers. Worth it, sure, but not ideal.
go with Occam's razor. Draco will focus on the simplest, most likely solution: Weasley meant exactly what he said, no false bottom and no secret hints.
Not that it’s relevant, a distraction in well-trodden paths of his mind, winding up and down in familiar waves, just exciting enough to keep most of his attention.
How long ago was that? Great, Harry had already lost track of time, he must have been really close to sleeping before Malfoy came back.
“Calm down, you hero. It’s still very, very blond,” Weasley assures him, as if Draco would take his word for it.
“Seems it’s you and me, Granger. How long will they be, do you think?” Draco would like to cast a discreet charm, something to at least muffle the wall of sound, but he doesn’t know how well Granger would take to that. Gryffindors can be sensitive on the weirdest things, he wouldn’t be surprised if she took it as offence.
, and if it weren't for Draco's pride and anger, they might even have found a solution to navigate this wrong thing in Draco. Harry likes helping people, and perhaps he could have taught Draco.
“I mean, yes, perhaps,” Potter allows, looking properly scolded. “What about that face she always makes at me, though?”
Harry could theoretically steal Dean away from where he is sitting pressed next to Seamus, and nudge him to go talk to Draco. Only that it probably wouldn’t do them any good, because Dean can be painfully shy when meeting new people — and as already established, this counts as meeting Draco anew — and the last thing Harry needs right now is
"I am NOT gay!" He hissed to her. "Harry Potter is not gay, I'm not gay, we're both not gay! Okay?" He spoke to everyone before leaving, with Seamus following after him.
He dropped my hand. "I fancy you," he whispered to the ground. "I have for awhile now. Since you saved me...from the fiendfyre,"
“Good, that means we can finally talk about something else than your issues with Potter then. Do keep me updated though, now that it gets interesting.” It only takes Pansy one wink to dispel the solemnity in the room, usurping it with her usual easy charm. Still, Draco knows she meant it when she asked for updates. She rarely shows it this openly, but she always worried about Draco’s disconnect to the rest of the world. “On to the real problems: where do I take Granger if I want it to be the most amazing date she has ever been on?”
Harry wants to reach out, reassure them both that they aren’t locked in their rooms anymore, that they aren’t alone, but he doesn't quite dare. He doesn’t know how far gone Draco is, and there is stark difference between stroking a pet and suddenly being touched yourself. Harry doesn’t want to startle him, doesn’t want to make it worse. So he keeps his hands at his sides, watching Draco gaze into the distance and wishing he would wake up.
, as if hatred is any less hateful when it’s delivered with excellent posture instead of heated screeching. But then, Lucius Malfoy didn’t need logical reasoning to feel superior.
He angles his head down—prays that his hair falls right and that Potter didn’t lie to him—and blinks up at Potter with wide, innocent eyes. It’s an expression he used since early childhood, with only minor variations, to plead his faked innocence in the case of missing chocolates. He even used it to talk his way out of Azkaban, emphasising his youth and helplessness (he did refrain from salacious eyelashes batting, in that particular instance, though that had become something of a staple once he realised the looks impressive effectiveness in flirting).
Next Draco stores the plates, all in a neat row. It’s very quick and very satisfying and Draco smiles at the two of the piles he has taken care of. He puts the glasses and cups in the second drawer, places them in two rows and settles them closely against each other, using all the space he has.
This is not something Draco can ask for, however. He doesn’t know what exactly he should ask, what he expects, but Harry’s unwavering stare is unsettling. That doesn’t usually happen, Draco generally feels … safe when Harry is watching him, but he can see that Harry’s entire perception of him is undergoing major changes as he processes what Draco told him.
Especially because, occasionally, as the game goes on, Potter throws him quick looks, smiles growing with every time he finds Draco looking.
Draco didn't tell him sooner, how that makes Harry feel and if that is justified or selfish when, clearly, Draco is the one going through a crisis — Harry feels faint just thinking about it. Faint and nauseous and, like, maybe, their devious friends had the right idea all along.
Harry never wanted anything more than needing to buy that bed. Draco would have grumbled about it, would have complained about not getting any sleep anymore with all the tiny people in their bed, but he also would have hidden a tiny smile and allowed their children absolutely any of the blankets they wanted, making Harry carry them all.
Draco could stare at that smile for hours, could waste away without a care as long as he has that smile to cling to.
“So what does that mean, when are we getting to the rooms we actually live in?” Harry has been wanting to ask that since about 5 rooms now. He is getting tired of living like this, with barely more than they had when they were camping through the woods in constant fear for their lives.
who is flailing—internal; grace and composure are his birth right and he’ll be damned ere he gives them up for Potter—caught by surprise and and those green eyes, burning like the
“Diseases are medical conditions, abnormalities that negatively affect structure or function of an organism. Do you need me to take this apart, or do you see how the term doesn’t apply?” Pansy is as done talking about this as Draco is. This is her no-nonsense voice, for when she doesn’t want any answer except a nod in agreement. It’s always had an unfortunate tendency to drive Draco into hysteria.
Draco pretends not to listen to the sounds it is making, focuses all his attention on Potter falling through the air, nothing to hold him and nothing to save him. Nothing, that is, but Draco, running to where he thinks Potter is going to come down.
“I know it sounds like a very simple thing, to write a letter—” Blaise shushes him with a finger on his lips.
This is it, Narcissa will decide that he isn’t good enough for her son, that he obviously has drinking problems he was trying to hide, and, as everyone knows, it’s only downhill from there. Narcissa is going to discreetly take Harry aside, and very politely, and in the most diplomatic way possible, tell him that he will ask Draco for a divorce, and that Draco is to get anything he wants to help him over the shock.
— it’s a whole new reality Harry managed to avoid looking at surprisingly well. It's different now that he signed the papers and there is only Malfoy’s signature missing and he
Draco cannot think at all with Potter so close, petrified when faced with what is expected of him. He knew this was coming, had a whole week to prepare and even longer before that to make his peace with the vague concept of marriage, but it’s not the same as standing here.
But jealousy doesn’t listen to reason, and Harry doesn't try to fight it as he glares at Parkinson. Fighting it is as successful as ignoring it, after all, and in the end all you can do with jealousy is drown it and spit it out like vitriol, lest it borrows deep inside of you to nest and fester. It’s an ugly emotion, without a doubt, but that is the thing with ugly emotions, they stick, and they take, and there is no getting rid of them, no
Draco just closes his eyes and lets Potter arrange him however he sees fit, imagines himself far away and pretends not to notice the feeling over Potter’s fingers tracing over his skin, their intent obvious and heavy, acts like he doesn’t feel sick and in need of a cleaning afterwards.
Potter doesn’t look happy anymore, the cold falling back around them with viciousness, and then the darkness floods between them, pulling up towards the sky in black swirls and dragging everything with it.
(Draco hopes to all that is good and merciful that Potter somehow missed what is happening in this part of his mind.)
Draco has been standing in Potter’s innermost temple for a half a minute and he is already bored out of his mind. Unless the shop collapses around them, there is nothing that would snap Potter out of his focus—Potter doesn’t focus often but when he does you have a better chance wringing mercy out of a Dementor than attracting Potter’s attention.
force Draco, he doesn’t think—this is all terribly confusing and Draco would prefer not to think about it. He told Potter they could move and so they will, reason doesn’t matter anymore.
and Draco wants to soothe him, wants to promise that he will save him, that that is what he is here to do.
The blue of the dress does clash with the green of his eyes, quite badly, and Draco tells him so, combing the hair away from his face and cradling it in his hands. Potter laughs at him, changes the colour as easy as breathing, and Draco can gaze upon him without that horrible irritant, the dress a green that could almost rival his eyes in perfection.
“Because,” Potter starts, slowly, like he is talking to an exceptionally dumb toddler—which is rude and inaccurate; Draco has always been brilliant. “Ron and Hermione are already happily married; Parkinson terrifies me and I don’t want to risk my physical safety asking her; Ginny is my ex so that would be a kind of weird none of us wants or needs; Luna is an angel above such mortal coils; and Neville is dating Zabini, who you should well know is one possessive bastard—there is no way I could casually marry either of them.”
Still, Harry spent all his life defying what self-important people want him to be, and he has no intentions of bowing his head to some old crook who wouldn’t spit on Hermione if she burned. Harry would much rather they find a way around these archaic rules and make them seethe.
You don’t save the world and fulfill the prophecy dumped on your head when you were eleven and emotionally vulnerable to that sort of manipulation, and then disappear from the face of said heroically saved world.
like I’m doing?” Draco tries to go for coyness, to make Potter smile and say something silly and perhaps that would help with the tension rapidly building between them. But Potter doesn’t say anything and Draco feels ever weaker under the heavy echo of Potter’s only rule. “Really, Harry! I was playing the violin.”
Draco’s first instinct is to say that, yes, of course, anything Harry asks. His second is that, no, absolutely not, his thoughts need to remain his own. There is no middle ground between them, not in the third, fourth or fifth reaction.
(He finally gave in to thinking about the possibilities of positive touch. He realised too late and by now he likes the dreams too much to stop.)
, what was he saying again? Right, Malfoy can’t fool him anymore. He’s rattled, enough to still not let go of Harry, leaning back just as far as necessary to glare at him. Harry should really set him down now, this is getting awkward.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you will do no such thing!” Pansy clutches the ferret protectively against her chest, drawing herself up into her furious-animal-right-activist persona and glaring at Draco as if he proposed to kill every ferret and bath in their blood. “What you are suggesting there is not only cruel and abominable, but a despicable act of human impudence, woefully uninformed and repugnant.”
Weasley is there, holding Granger up and already staring at the bed, at the spells hovering over Potter. Actually, he isn’t looking at the spells, isn’t searching for information they could understand in the complicated figures and symbols the healers use. Weasley is looking at Potter, hovering like the overprotective best friend he is. Draco forgot; somewhere among these movies and Weasley’s enthusiasm, he forgot that Weasley cares, that he hurts and hopes.
“It’s alright, you already woke her so you might as well make it count. I also did say you could, so …” Draco meant for his words to be reassuring and dispel the awkwardness encroaching on them, but if anything Harry looks more conflicted. Draco used to be better at this.
“I might, depends on what you want from her.” Draco smirks at Granger's frustrated noise, recklessly leans closer towards Osbourne in a show of power.
into the gauze. Well, actually, with five older brothers, maybe the twins got settled with nursing duties. It would explain a lot.
doesn’t take too kindly to being told what to do (or to being pointed at, Harry had a lot of fun with that one when he first realised back in Third Year) and he doesn’t like to rely on Muggles—or anyone, for that matter; though Harry supposes them being Muggles doesn’t help—for his defence.
and whoever possessed Draco’s brain for that exceptionally stupid thought, he would like them to stay far away from him.)
is what Harry should tell him. Of course, the moment Harry composed himself enough for that realisation, Draco rudely steals his space.
Perhaps he should have kept to his tried and tested formula, that worked well enough for him in the past. Draco wouldn’t have showed Harry his secret sanctuary, not on his very first visit, but would have kept them to the main room. He would have showed Harry the collection of antiquities that intrigued him enough to talk his parents into buying them to be displayed on his shelves, neatly labelled and meticulously examined and catalogued. There would have been other toys to meet and possibly, if Harry were to indulge him, tea to drink from the good china reserved for special occasions. He might even have told Harry some stories, memories of what happened here and secrets like the giant splash of blue paint covered by a portrait of the last dodo.
Draco often hears loyalty linked to Gryffindor, mostly to praise foolhardy and excuse blind recklessness, but he never quite saw it. It’s selfishness, he thought, a desire to prove themselves righteous and good and brave that makes anyone claiming loyalty act the way they do. Loyal to what, even? They never specified. But here, now, in Harry, Draco sees it.
say. Which is ridiculous, Harry knows that, but he can’t help feeling like he took advantage of whatever problem Draco was having. There are two kinds of people in these stories, the scumbags that don’t care, and those who listen, those who heard the hitch in their voice and saw the hesitation in their eyes — yep, Harry reads too much trashy romance.
Granger definitely snorts this time, a very undignified sound for a horse to make. Draco raises his eyebrow at her to let her know that.
, for Godric’s sake! I think I was overcompensating, trying to catch up with Dudley and, just this one time, I wanted to have something that he could never have, no matter how loud he cried.” Harry’s voice sounds far off, lost in contemplation of a horror Draco cannot begin to comprehend. He doesn't know what it feels like to be denied what he wants, not in the way Harry suffered.
Potter scowls at him, displeased with that answers because it’s not one of the options he gave, neither a kiss nor a condemnation. Draco meets his eyes, doesn’t allow himself to look away as he is scrutinised. He wants to hide, wants to talk or kiss Potter, solely to avoid being seen like this, but he meets Potter, offers all he has for Potter to see. This is it, the Moment where Potter decides if Draco is worth it, if he wants to keep him and try.
“Your threat has been noted. Would you finally move Elfrida Windsor-Stenham up to the ‘Official Rules and Regulations for Gobstones Tournaments’?” Draco is getting a bit impatient. If they don’t finish resorting this bookshelf quickly, they will have to leave its books strewn all over the floor for the night. Grimmauld won’t appreciate that.
fighting for true love and Theo can smell lies you haven’t even told yet—Draco says no, tells him his feelings are neither that strong, nor is it this time sensitive.
Draco turns to look at him, takes the hand preparing to claw out his heart and folds it into his own, gripping Potter back just as tight. He needs to do this right, needs to reassure Potter and make him feel safe, make him feel
“Was my question not clear?” Potter asks before Weasley can go into more detail. Probably a good thing, Draco would like to forget this conversation ever happened; the less details he gets, the better. “Who are you and what do you want?”
In truth it’s a test, seeing how certain Granger is in Weasley’s ability when the stakes become real. Either Granger will keep her faith and they can proceed, or Granger will back down, suggest that they should go over the words again. Draco finds himself hoping for the first. It would be terribly humiliating for Weasley—not the fun and teasing kind they enjoyed so far—when Granger suddenly realised she doesn’t trust him; Draco doesn’t want to witness that. Also, it’s not like he was looking forward to going over the theory when he could be five steps further, wandering through Potter’s mind to find the problem.
“It’s really not. If you don’t want me here, you can just say so. I can rent a hotel room or ask —” Pansy glares him into silence before Draco can finish the sentence. Fair enough; it’s generally understood that the offer to leave for a hotel room is more of a threat (because what kind of friend would abandon you to a hotel when they have perfectly serviceable guest room) than it is a courtesy. In this concrete case, it means Draco doesn’t want to answer any more questions, and Pansy had better stop asking.
together, Malfoy is there every time Harry turns around. There is no escaping the blond menace and if there is one thing that can make relationships more complicated, it’s sex. They would have to be adult and responsible and talk about it and as fun as flustering Malfoy was the last time, it’s not exactly a conversation Harry is eager to repeat.
Pansy makes to say something else, equally insidious, when the ferret starts wildly jumping, leaping and curling and looking like it has gone crazy. It’s quite scary, would be to anyone, and Draco is out of the couch and as far away as he can in a matter of seconds. Merlin knows what’s wrong with it, and he doesn’t need the rabid thing to bite him.
“What?” Harry asks, because he both completely lost what they were talking about and can’t believe what Draco confessed to.
Then there are hands on his arm and Draco flinches, hands clenching on the desk and eyes pressed together tighter, a jolt of pain shooting through his brain.
“He can’t talk, it’s the movie,” a yellow fish helpfully explains. Granger? Probably, Draco doesn’t think Potter would speak to him through a different form when he refuses to use his body for it. “It’s a curse that can only be lifted with the kiss of true love. Thus this scene, to tempt you into kissing him.”
Granger stands there, in the middle of the giant ballroom, looking at Draco and trying to decide if he is worthy of her best friend. Draco says nothing in response, nods again. This time he understands exactly what she means: Potter might have decided to trust him, to throw himself into whatever it is they are building, but Granger isn’t convinced. She is here to look out for Potter, to protect him as much she can.
The moment feels surreal, leaning on Malfoy for support and not questioning his sanity for it, the most normal thing in the world. That must be the reason Harry told him about Sirius; little as it is, it’s enough for Malfoy to figure out a whole lot of unpleasant history and loss. Harry is sure he’ll regret it later, but right now he feels overwhelmed and alone, desperate enough to take comfort wherever he can find it.
say sex, you know? It’s not going to dirty that precious pure blood of yours. Might do wonders for your prudishness, too.” Potter smirks, leaning closer to watch Draco squirm. “I have to admit, you don’t look half bad with that blush giving you some colour.”
“Gross, get a room,” Weasley shouts, ripping apart the intimate warmth and closeness they shared between themselves.
Draco isn’t shocked awake, doesn’t jump up and demands Harry take it back, that they are still Potter and Malfoy and Harry should probably go back to his own bed now, anyway.
. That is the best response Draco could have asked for, no matter that it hurts hearing Potter hoarse from screaming.
this time. He doesn’t care about the rest, about his own morals or dignity or if this will stay a bloody sharp knife digging into his lungs, as long as Draco learns to trust him, and they can make their way back.
“So you lied, there is no way out of this.” Potter flops back onto the grass, dramatic and resigned as he opens himself for the rain to take him. It is terribly frustrating, seeing Potter determined not to use that bright intellect of his and instead content to lay in the mud, wallowing in the injustice of the world.
“Are you going to demand I leave again?” Draco prompts, because Potter seems to be stuck. “I’ll inform you that this is a place of business and I have every right to be here, unless you specifically ban me.”
and Harry would have been completely fine with that. This is Malfoy’s bed, after all, he had no intentions of throwing the git out of his own bed.
Draco doesn’t know to behave towards Potter, after their unconventional bonding moment a few days back. He never thought he would be the one to keep Potter from breaking apart at the seams, not when their childhood had been devoted to finding ever new ways of making the other explode and laugh at the ensuing confetti. But standing there, watching the first sign that Potter isn’t as unaffected by this whole ordeal as assumed, that he
them flirt. They keep asking me to judge who of the both of them she is actually interested in and I have no desire to be able to answer that question.” Potter shakes his head almost frantically, which is the best reaction Draco could have hoped for. Instead, Draco is oddly indignant on Pansy's behalf. It doesn’t make sense that he should be offended again; horrifying Potter to the point of cancelling dinner altogether was the plan.
Shame, Harry, too, would like to escape this conversation (no matter how amused Narcissa seems, Harry has a hard time believing she is actually comfortable discussing her son's sex life, even in unsubtle allusions), and tackling Draco onto the couch seems by far like the most entertaining way to achieve that.
Draco has seen her flirt, knows exactly what she is doing. She is laying it on thick, too, her lips blood red and smirking, promising him all kinds of things Draco doesn’t want from her, doesn’t even want to
Potter sighs, almost heavy enough to hide the smile. But Draco sees it, files it away as another piece adding up to the mystery of what became of Potter. Full of contractions, that man; that at least hasn’t changed.
, marrying Draco and laughing at his jokes, indulging his dramatics and cooking for him; making Draco fall in love. Harry, who is looking at him like he is a misbehaving pet, a Kneazle that’s brought in a dead bird, torn up and bloody, and Harry is wondering why he even kept Draco as long as he did, bewildered and disgusted.
Draco would love little more than planning their travels together, even as he must be soaking in mud by now. He would love to see Potter smile, hear where he wants to go, the places he wants the see. But he also wants to kiss Potter, wants at least the
“I don’t know your movies, Potter, how was I to know?” he asks softly, hoping Potter understands this is an apology, of sorts, not an accusation.
They have been getting along alright, fulfilling their sacred married duties without fights and murder threats and giving Grimmauld absolutely nothing to frown upon. They settled into something scarily domestic, sharing spaces more and more instead of just existing in them side by side. Granted, it was Ginny who pointed that out, dropping by to prove her infuriating theory of Harry’s alleged crush on Malfoy (talking to Hermione about not sharing her impressions of Harry’s love life with his ex turned out to be useless, Hermione refuses to see the problem and Ginny keeps on knowing too much) so nothing she said can truly be trusted, but it’s unsettling all the same.
There is nothing here, their cabin empty except for Draco, his heart pouding loudly in the stillness, his breath ragged, his limbs shaking.
kind of sound he makes, something croaked and punched out and not intentional, but it’s not a laugh. It’s more reverent, awed.
rituals the earth does around them. There is a quiet beauty to them, something that demands for you to stand still and watch.
to have children for that to work. And because pure-bloods don’t believe in divorce but instead invest time and effort in secret dalliances and love affairs to be denied at the dinner table, he will have to have those children with
Harry sighs. He won’t get anything useful out of Ron right now, not while he is concentrating on the food not doing what it is supposed to do. That’s the downside to your friend developing an interest in cooking, Harry supposes — they start to cook
He didn’t initiate anything after that first night (not even a kiss, though Malfoy was oddly against kissing anyway, so maybe it’s not surprising he didn’t try that again) and also refused all of Harry’s advances. It’s unbelievably frustrating, to know what Malfoy looks like, flushed and spread out on the bed for Harry, to know what his skin tastes like and what his hair feel like when gripped in passion, and to have any chance of getting to experience it again withheld.
He probably did, people can’t just express numerous facets of disdain in the curl of a lip without spending hours in front of a mirror. Malfoy must have dedicated years of his childhood learning how to smirk just right, going to his father for approval and getting advice on how to turn it a few notches nastier. It’s a family tradition, Harry is sure, passed on from one generation to the next, Malfoy learning from his father and then teaching their children — no! Mission abort!
Granger, as calculated, doesn’t like vague answers. She glares at Draco (her glare is quite impressive; Draco understands what Pansy sees in her, smart and terrifying), making him rethink his reckless pursuit of distraction for a moment before her expression changes to one of befuddlement, trying to figure out how to say whatever it is she wants him to know.
Draco couldn’t stand for Harry to laugh at him. Harry might not realise it, but he holds the key to Draco’s most treasured memories. This is where Draco grew up, where he discovered the world and hid from it in. This is
Draco is, honestly, not sure how to handle Potter in this moment. Tough love was perhaps not the best idea.
In the end, it’s simple — Draco is no fighter. He never was, not even when his entire world was threatened to be consumed by darkness. He is a coward, a follower, meekly bowing his head under the boot of someone stronger. He tries not to be, fully aware of how pathetic it is, but when push comes to shove… well, it would probably squash Draco before he found the courage to step out of the way. His awareness of this is the only thing Pansy’s passionate speeches ever sparked in him.
An aggressively small couch? How would that even work? Gryffindors aren’t polite enough to understand the subtle meanings conveyed in decor and furnishing, the implications of a small couch would be completely lost on them. They would only drag in something new, possibly even more hideous. Also, why does Harry think Draco would not simply deny them entry if he didn’t want them here? Didn’t he agree to participate in their next gathering?
at him again and Pansy doesn't seem pleased at all. Draco can't be sure if it's because he reminded them of Weasley's quasi wife or because he interrupted her hunt, but he'll pay for that one.
, what more could you want? — but he rather feels that whatever peace they found for themselves, this strange contentment laying in the air, it won’t hold up to scrutiny. His mother would ask questions, the hard ones usually avoided because no one knows how to answer them, and she would inspect the very foundation of their life, would take it up and turn it on its head, shake it and rattle it and see what comes crashing out, the nitty-gritty stuff purposefully sequestered out of sight.
Something moves again, and Harry swivels them around, wand arching through the air and the spell almost cast, magic high and potent around them, his entire force bundled and focused on —
“Potter! Nice to see you finally dragged yourself here, I made you some coffee. Hurry up drinking though, we have much to do today!” Malfoy almost
What Ron is saying sounds perfect, the right amount of excuse and responsibility, not making him look bad by either running away or running ahead too enthusiastically. Harry clings to that, tries to make himself believe it.
those are? — so that their pelts can be stolen and the animals discarded after losing the only thing of worth.” Weasley is looking a bit pale there, staring at Pansy in shock and numbly letting himself be poked when Pansy makes an especially gruesome point. Draco knows all too well how he feels, he has had enough talks like this to last him a lifetime, Pansy stripping away his wilful ignorance argument by argument.
Well, Harry expected somewhat … more. Shouting, maybe, a panicked refusal to stay in the house one second longer, a baleful look over dredged up childhood memories. This is most disappointing. (Yes, disappointing, not pleasant to hold Malfoy like this, disappointing.)
Potter stares at Draco with wide eyes, both of them frozen as they try to understand what happened and why the hell they aren’t kissing.
It was different when he announced to all the world that he is gay (well, confirmed, as mentioned before — Draco never was subtle enough to make a grand reveal necessary or even possible), because back then he had something to proclaim. He was
He wonders if it would have changed things, had he realised that sooner. Perhaps he would have been able to bear Harry’s touch with more ease if he’d had sentiment to cling to? But then, what good is sentiment in desperate situations? Sentiment is a hollow shell, a pretty ornament that you can worry about once you moved all the rest out of the way — it doesn’t make anything easier. It might just be the opposite; sentiment makes things worse. It’s complicated and messy and demands personal investment. That’s why people stay in bad relationships, even when they are fully aware it’s bad and know that the sensible thing would be to cut all ties. No, if Draco had realised how desperately in love he was with Harry, things would have been worse.
spilt Malfoy’s tea after he wrinkled his nose at his coffee. It essentially boils down to same thing, anyway. “Grimmauld gets a little uncomfortable if we aren’t in the same room, cold and draughty and making me trip over uneven ground — never Malfoy, which
Draco can spare a few thoughts to be grateful the hedges serve as separation between the, mostly unused, garden and the endless vastness that is Wiltshire, that there is nothing for them to have fallen onto expect the very same land simply going by another name. He supposes that makes their crouching and hovering close to each other somewhat unnecessary, but Harry had insisted it would dramatically influence the mood, which is a crucial point to success, and Draco didn’t think of objections quick enough — it doesn’t matter. Draco is trying hard to distract himself from the real issue, when the solving would be so very easy, much easier than assigning guilt.
“It’s not the song, they repeat the same few lines they know over and over again,” Granger finally says, slowly, making sure Draco doesn’t shock himself into another coughing fit. (Or waiting eagerly to see it? You can never know with those Gryffindors. Draco wouldn’t have guessed them to be a sadistic bunch and yet, here they are.)
Potter, at least, is still laughing, the frightened horse disappeared along with the cold, the snow nothing but pretty scenery. He has forgotten about it, Draco supposes, now that the danger is survived.
Draco doesn’t answer, firstly because he isn’t in the mood for Potter’s teasing and secondly because he can’t tell him that Blaise is incapable of cooking in small portions (saying that would also blow his cover). It’s none of Potter’s business that Blaise considers food a family bonding experience, that he doesn't like eating alone and thus never cooks for less than four people. Potter is lucky enough that he gets to eat it, anything else would be greedy.
Actually, is flower sniffing a thing? Draco has never had much concern for plants but he saw enough people do it for it to be something he noticed. Also, and this might be the most convincing point, Potter isn’t dumb. He is a bit foolish, sure, but if he were dumb enough to let himself be poisoned he wouldn’t have made it through the war. If Potter is sniffing that plant there has to be a reason there, one Draco never had the opportunity to learn because his father yelled at him when he got too close to The Infernal Green.
, even shunted off Slytherins not good enough for his friendship (yes, Draco is still a tiny bit bitter about that; what are you going to do about it?)—is free to speak their mind and be heard. Potter was a boy thrown into a war, observed like an experiment by those meant to protect him—he had quite different things to think about than justice and a new social order.
(Okay, fine, so Theo might need support of the softer kind for a bit longer, but surely Draco could borrow it for a few evenings?)
, Draco is more than content to remain here, at a safe distance and close to the nearest escape route.
It’s not a difficult task, not all that many things that Potter could have meant, but Draco’s brain is slow in accepting the obvious answer. Potter wants to do it again, and again and again after that, whenever the mood strikes him. He found a way to make it part of their agreement, make it something
“Good, that’s good.” Harry nods, his hands absentmindedly trailing up and down on Draco’s arms, lost in thought. Good, Draco reminds himself, this is good. Harry feels this is good. “I think that’s all for right now. The rest we figure out as we go. Sound alright?”
Rotten character however, that would be much harder to wipe out and, frankly, Draco isn’t convinced you would even
Harry would be capable of that, they both know it, more than capable. He has a talent for manipulating Draco into anything, similar to Pansy who doesn’t acknowledge that, occasionally, Draco does indeed know what is good for him and can make his own choices. But Pansy’s manipulation don’t leave a sour taste in his mouth, and he never has the feeling of losing to Pansy when she makes him do something. It’s different with Harry.
it was me. Someone give the man a medal!” Draco being sarcastic should be a good sign, but it only serves to infuriate Harry.
Draco gives her a shy and awkward wave, mostly to see if she would be alright with him stepping closer but also because he doesn’t know what else to do. She is scary, even as a horse, which is a hard feat to pull off.
That Draco would have much preferred the library isn’t a surprise either. Not only would it be easier to move through Potter’s mind (provided Potter does possess even the basic filing and shelving skills—even had Draco somehow managed to convince himself of the library part of this, it’s at the filing part that Draco’s dream of order collapses laughing) but it would also be much more comfortable.
He goes for Draco’s sides first, expecting him to immediately start squirming and preparing to hold him down and close when that happens, but it … doesn’t.
Ron smiles at him, crooked and somewhat wobbly, but Harry knows he is forgiven. And that he might have to get used to snakes in his life.
“What?” The word, the only thing Harry’s mind seems capable of producing, sounds punched out and hollow.
Harry had prepared himself for a lot, denial and pretending the words didn’t hit him, the crumbling look of pain denied expression, screaming and defences, reflections, retorts, faked sudden loss of hearing — Harry could have dealt with it all. It would not have been
Maybe that last one was mostly only a perk for Harry, come to think of it. But then, he died to save this miserable world, surely he deserves to use any and every chance he gets to taunt and perturb slimy, evil Slytherin twats.
They are on a lake, floating aimlessly with no oars in sight, frogs and crickets loud in the night, stars glittering above them, the moon illuminating Potter.
For one, Draco isn’t fond of people touching Capt'n. That is the whole idea behind the gamble, sacrificing the very thing Draco sought to protect so viscously. It’s quite poetic, if you think about it, and Draco has no doubt that it would be a good Grand Gesture in a story, something sappy and ridiculous.
Throwing one last glance over his shoulder at Harry (that odd half-smile is still tugging at his lips, far more reassuring than it should it be) Draco reaches out for the book. He hopes Harry appreciates how easy it would be for him to remember the book and the hidden passage, Draco doesn’t show this to just
"What's there to consider? We hate you, you hate us — just say no." Ron, always the first to stand up against something unfair. Harry has seldom been this grateful for it.
cut himself, stupid prejudiced house) and suspiciously not looking at Harry. He must have found something good here.
Draco glares up at the window, tiny in the distance but big enough to make for a clear aim. Draco is going to get there, if only to tell him that disappearing and conjuring up a dragon is a very rude way of rejecting someone. There would have been easier ways; they would have hurt about the same as a dragon stomping on him but they would have been kinder to his clothes.
evidence to be disappointed in his poor deflection. Her scepticism is sufficiently conveyed in her pointed silence.
Seamus and Dean are laying on the ground, toppled onto each other and laughing, the cause of their fall unclear but apparently nothing drastic. Which means Harry can throw his popcorn onto them without feeling too bad about exploiting their unfortunate circumstances. With a blood curling war cry everyone resumes their attack.
invade Harry’s privacy like that, but whatever. It’s not worth getting upset over and watch Malfoy get all smug. And if Harry is a little rougher with him that night, bites his skin more than he kisses it and lets his frustration bleed into bruises, Malfoy doesn’t protest.
So, keep Pansy away from his hair and don’t join another vile group of grumbling morons—Draco can learn from the past to make a better future! He totally can. This is why he came to Blaise in his newest time of need, because his other friends have proven themselves incapable and Weasley might have been surprisingly helpful, but Draco would rather not lose yet another game of chess to the smug ginger. (Very smug, very ginger—best not to repeat that experience.)
No, Harry refuses. That cannot possibly be what is expected of him. And even if, Harry turned it into a point of pride to never do what is expected of him. No, if there are to be children growing up in this house, playing hide and seek in the numerous secret places old houses hold, discovering the world through the extensive library and having their growth noted in marks on door frames and pictures on the walls, Harry wants them to be
have sex with Potter, so how can he be asexual, then?” Blaise asked this already, about three times, Draco thinks, but they are all even more drunk — because that’s what you do when you get big words you don’t understand that might change your life but also scare you.
exaggerated and overdrawn, and Draco actually did sigh wistfully — not out of calculation, but because he
, despite the frugal rooms that are meant to be homelier and the unfortunate occasion when Harry still holds his breath in anticipation before the doors open for him, as if they would never consider denying him entry — well, now that it’s
Draco didn’t doubt for a second that they would kill Potter and dump his body in the Thames if that were the best course of action, but it’s nice to be reassured regardless. What can he say, Potter is a sore topic for him, and having such a strong reminder that Draco is far from alone in this disaster is much appreciated. It can get lonely, having a husband who makes no secret out of hating you.
This time Harry doesn’t laugh. Draco almost wishes he would, the look of concern Harry is giving him makes him feel even more fragile then the constant bubbling of things cooking, the timers ticking down and everything slowly winding up and up and up into one disaster of a dinner.
“How are you such an idiot?” Draco directs the question up into the sky and when it’s Potter who makes to answer, he shuts him up with a kiss.
to kiss the man for the marriage to be recognised and Grimmauld not to murder him in his sleep, it will at least be on his own terms.
“Harry?” Malfoy stirs in his arms, voice rough from sleep and muffled against his shoulder. Harry freezes, one hand buried deep in Malfoy’s hair and the other slung over his back, holding him close as his mind took them far away.
Also, Draco does have to prove himself in the fight. That is a constant in their dance, regrets or not.
If it's going to hurt anyway, so Harry might as well do the decent thing and tell Draco to his face that — well, whatever it is that Harry needs to tell him.
“Unfortunately I did see that abomination, yes. I took the liberty of vanishing it. You are welcome.” If one were picky about these things, Draco ignited it. One has to be scrupulous where bad taste is concerned.
Malfoy looks at him as if he grew a second head, morbid fascination and befuddlement. Somehow, that is still better than offering to
He thinks better that way, putting nebulous ideas into words and seeing how they feel. Draco hoped performing his mind to Osbourne would have the added benefit of that useless owl puffing up, should someone intrude on Draco's solitude. Figures that Draco would forget about Pansy, who is the most likely to appear out of thin air not only because this is her house, but also because Osbourne would maybe preen at her entry — certainly not do the weird growling Draco was looking out for.
“I am going to talk for a while, tell you what we know, give you a few options of what to do, try not to throw you into a situation that would be worse than having you cooped up in that house. Sounds good?”
who brought it into the marriage. You can finally declare your intentions of divorcing me and throw me out of the house. I should warn you though, that won’t play out as you think it will — I will fight for this house and don’t think for a moment that Grimmauld would ever choose you over me,” Malfoy presses out, not stopping once for air as if Harry would interrupt him at the slightest chance.
fight, both of them getting things off their chest and draining their feelings to collapse into exhausted reconciliation.
He wouldn’t be welcome. That’s why he doesn't know for sure where Draco is; Draco didn’t tell him because he didn’t want Harry to follow him. Harry got the message loud and clear and he will respect Draco’s wishes (for once, Harry can do the decent thing and not violate Draco, just this one time).
an Erumpent, no need for visual confirmation. Despite the bad example, the point stands: Draco is trusted with the shop.)
Potter is completely unconcerned, of course, either suspiciously cheery if this was indeed a failed attempt at Draco’s life or obnoxiously eager to shove his extraordinary cooking skills in Draco’s face. Quite literally, Draco should comment on that.
Draco spent many a tense afternoon tea at that house, forced to smile and ask for another cup, until what was meant to be a necessary though quick bout of politeness had stretched into an awkward dinner. Family obligations, consistent in their occurrence as well as general horribleness. His father would always complain as soon as they were back home, his bland smile falling the second he stepped out of the floo and straight towards the liquor cabinet. He would demand things like
Potter doesn’t even glance at the tea—seriously, what is it with this man? Does he just hate tea or why is he stubbornly ignoring every cup Draco brings him?—trying to slouch back into something more relaxed than his excited-meerkat impression. He fails, trying too hard and landing instead on endearingly awkward.
too old for that already (they were 13 at that point, far too grown up for something so silly, they all solemnly agreed, before Seamus threw a pillow in Neville's face and the fight was on) and who invited Harry into his home, showing him the glorious hell of having a huge and nosey family. If Ron were here right now, he would be disappointed to see Harry overpowered by Draco so easily.
“Well, if you indeed read the letter, Parkinson,” Hermione’s tone strongly implies that she thinks Parkinson did
Potter doesn’t talk, nods his consent in a jerky movement that would be enough for Draco, if he wasn’t desperate to hear him speak.
Sure, there was a phase when they made bets about everything and Draco honestly would be more surprised to learn there are no bets involving him and Potter and the whole array of human emotions, crudely smashed together and mixed through—but to bring it up like this? To write them on a dirty piece of cheap fabric? Draco is insulted, rumours about his love life used to be worth more than that!
Granger, at least, is a constant he can rely on. She stands there grimacing, more aware the singing is bad than their two tone deaf singers, watching as Weasley twirls Potter, their silhouettes sharply cut against the light.
Harry is pretty sure that’s his fault. Malfoy was fine until Harry kissed him, his usual obnoxious self that normally would have gotten him pressed against a wall and a few new additions to the kissed bruises around his neck. Now,
“Malfoy! Did you see that?” Potter gestures at something on the field, something Draco didn’t see because he was looking at Potter, and then Potter turns his head to look at him.
“If you are here to pick me up, you are early.” Potter frowns up at Draco from his book, ink smudged onto his nose where he fiddled with his glasses. He squints as Draco waves, nose scrunched up to see better. (It’s adorable; don’t tell him that.)
“As a matter of fact, I do keep things only when it makes sense to do so.” Draco is rather proud of that ability, to let go of things he no longer needs or uses. Blaise says that is to balance out the way he clings to his feelings, every flatter and every grudge, but Blaise isn’t here so Harry will never know.
Draco doesn’t know what demons hold Potter small, lost somewhere in his head, but he doesn’t like them. He doesn’t like this Potter, who barely protests Draco taking up space in his home and who walks through the world blind. Inert, that’s what he is and Draco hates it.
“It took me entirely too long to realise Draco didn’t trust me. It seems laughably obvious now — of course Draco didn’t trust me! I was just that sleazy guy violating him, tying him up in the deals we struck. I thought we had something good, that we might genuinely grow to… grow to
Draco was reaching for Capt'n, that much he knows, because there was no need for Harry to put her away and Draco wanted to hold her, too. But Harry is taller than Draco remembered (which is entirely to blame on Draco’s slight difficulties with accepting the fact that Harry is taller than him, ever since they haven't been together at Hogwarts anymore and Harry shot up to rob Draco of his height advantage) and Draco misjudged the distance so his balance was off and he must have fallen. Fallen directly onto Harry, who didn’t expect that he would need to catch Draco and only had one arm to do so because the other was holding Capt'n, which can’t have helped
You want me to lie to you? I’m sorry, if you want someone to flatter your ego, you’ll have to find someone else.
rituals concerning movie night, he needs to stomp out this idea of two couches; absolutely ridiculous.
“I raped him. Draco. My husband. That is why —” why what? Why he ran away? Why their relationship was more doomed than Harry knew? Why Harry is the perfect Black heir, dark and twisted and the literal scum of the earth?
What he finds is disappointing. Most notably: it’s more of the bland, grey walls, constructing a large room, mostly empty. There is no extreme temperature and no attack jumping at them.
Another scream. Harry smothers a snicker in his pillow. Then he gets up and sneaks over to Malfoy's room. There is no way he is going to miss this, not if old Tom himself came back from the dead.
It’s a nice gesture, even nicer to be understood and valued, but that isn’t why Draco said what he said. He doesn’t want Potter to rage against the world for hurts that aren’t his to deal with (they could be, Draco thinks; they might be able to share pain like this, if they find a balance and way to make it work, the two of them together). Draco told him what he did so Potter wouldn’t interrupt him again, so that he could trust Draco to know what he is talking about.
Actually, Harry has a good idea of what Draco is talking about. Harry doesn't like it, but Draco doesn’t exactly use ambiguous words, and while he might like to call Harry stupid, he really isn’t. No, Harry hears him loud and clear, little as he likes it, but it’s early enough that he can get away with denying the truth before he will be forced to face it.
Instead of letting gravity drag him into the light, Draco flails and clings to Harry. It seems like a brilliant idea for all but one victorious moment, when Harry loses his balance and they are both falling.
Potter looks at him, eyes wide and uncertain, clutching at Draco’s hand like it’s a life line and Draco thinks perhaps he is, perhaps he will say yes and they can go back up, reenter the world and finally figure out what they have between them.
Draco watches somewhat detached as Pansy starts lecturing Blaise about charm (as if he needs any help in that department) and how, if anyone,
Malfoys don’t apologise, that is just how it is. But Draco, seeing how he married, isn’t a Malfoy anymore, is he? Not in name, at least, and names are ever so important. Names bind blood when clung to with enough conviction. And Draco always looked to his name to see who he is. Why stop that now?
They have been apart for a few hours, nothing said about finality or separation or breaks, but their marriage feels over all the same. It’s just not official, yet. They have been apart for a few hours, and Draco already misses the git. He misses his laughter and the passion he puts into anything he does, Harry’s tendency to lose his glasses and the simple delight he finds in even the most trivial things, as long as he thinks it would infuriate Draco’s ancestors. He misses his energy, strong and determined, misses his smiles and his smirks and his bad jokes. Draco even misses his hands, warm and steady when they hold him close, the gentle rise and fall of his breathing, the way he cards his fingers through Draco’s hair — Draco misses Harry.
Potter doesn’t answer, but he does take the plant, scowling as he snatches it from the counter to carry it back into his dreary flat. Good. Draco nods, satisfied and safely invisible behind Potter’s back, drinking his own tea and leaning against the counter, looking around the shop while he waits for Potter to return.
He looks at Potter again, evaluates him not as a nuisance but a potential partner for whatever this is shaping up to be. Draco isn't sure what this is, but it’s exciting, far more effective in pushing away the shadows than even the biggest fire.
Thankfully, Harry finally gives up whatever reservations he had, tension fading out of him as he gets comfortable. Draco doesn’t know what the next step would have been, short of knocking him out with a charm and abusing the lowered defences of sleep — which is highly unethical, Draco would have needed a lot of build-up to go there — there isn’t much more he could have done to be allowed to wrap his arms around Harry, to pull him close and lose himself in their embrace.
Despite the sheer ridiculous amounts of spoons they have amassed, Draco decides that the cutlery is probably easiest to deal with. If he can trust what Potter was doing before him—and Draco isn’t sure he can, honestly—then they are all supposed to go together into some sort of container for them. It looks horribly ineffective and there are few options in way of sorting them, but Draco shrugs and stuffs them inside, careful to point them all down. Here he can’t stop from making a snide comment to his captive audience.
“You can’t just name my fiddle.” Potter stares at him like Draco is nine kinds of crazy, which is really not fair.
It’s even better when Potter hands him his tea, exactly how Draco takes it. Draco didn’t realise he knew that, didn’t think Potter would bother to remember. But Potter did remember, sitting almost shy on the opposite of his strange table, eyes glancing away from Draco and hands fiddling with his cup. It’s like he is a whole new Potter; Draco isn’t sure he likes it.
Draco is spluttering, flailing wildly and struggling in Harry’s grip, making the whole Dashing Hero in Action thing far more difficult than expected. The couch is also considerably higher than Harry calculated, which, paired with Draco’s attempted escape, means Harry has to stand on his tiptoes to reach, determined not to let go. He is trying to save a life here; he can’t stop just because it’s a bit inconvenient!
“I could go to a bakery while you make tea?” Harry doesn’t know why he offers, getting dressed to face the world is about the last thing he wants to do, worse than trudging into the kitchen to make breakfast on his on, but Draco’s face lights up and the matter is decided.
Draco would have politely asked Harry to wait outside while he packed up some stuff to take with them and then he would have pressed all his most treasured secrets into Harry’s arms, protected by a thin but inscrutable layer of cardboard.
Draco had hoped that consummating their marriage would mean he gets rid of Potter. Grimmauld would see the traditions satisfied, Potter as Draco’s equal, and the tense silence of them both sitting in the same room and wishing to be far away would finally come to an end. Potter would avoid him just like Draco would avoid Potter, they would have their weekly dinners to keep up appearance and they could both move on with their lives. A perfectly normal marriage, as agreed.
Draco kneels down before her, knees hitting hard onto slick stone, and he could swear Granger is amused when he grimaces. (Draco barely keeps himself from scowling at her—it would be counterproductive to his efforts.)
because he enjoyed the horror he was inspiring in Draco; this one would be easy in comparison. Harry doesn’t
That is how things are: Harry saying nothing of what he wants to say more with every day passing in silence, watching Draco fight his own battles, and not talking about it.
Ironically, this time Harry really does have the urge to let go, if only to shake some sense into Draco. He doesn’t. The urge to hold Draco close is stronger, even if his mind works in endlessly winding ways that Harry will never understand.
Well, this is embarrassing. Harry walks backwards and hopes Draco left the door open, because his brain is still baffled at his disappearance and, frankly, Harry isn’t quite certain for how long he walked before he realised, or into which side of the corridor Draco slipped away.
Unfortunately, there is no way out of it. None that Draco can see at least, and he looked very thoroughly. Draco even considered admitting to his deceit and receiving Harry’s anger without the agony of humiliating himself first, but ultimately decided against it. It would be the right thing to do, of that he is sure, not dragging this out until the last possible second and doing Harry the courtesy of confessing, but Draco has never been a brave man. Owning up to your mistakes, holding your head high and looking them in the eyes when you say that yes, you did something wrong? That takes a good chunk more courage than could be safely contained inside of Draco.
, and it’s the loudest thought in his mind, laced with fondness and affection. Harry grins up at him, interpreting correctly but still waiting for more, waiting for Draco to say it. “Fine, yes, I will marry you, again. But I want you to propose again. I’ll organise a few tasteful photographers, and I want a ring —”
commenting. He and Seamus have been attached at the hip (and Harry doesn’t want to know where also, no sir, not thinking about that) since the first time Seamus tried to impress Dean with a spell and ended with blowing it up instead, they don’t get to have opinions on flirting and pining. Not even when they clearly don’t apply to Harry’s situation.
“You wouldn’t force me! You didn’t before, and you wouldn’t now.” Draco pulls Harry closer, because it seems like the thing to do and because he genuinely wants to have a hold on Harry, in case he decides to flee again.
“Don't do that again, Potter, not that.” There is something odd about Malfoy’s voice, the words shaky and half whispered, and Harry abruptly realises that there must be some kind of
His hand is big. Draco never noticed before, but Potter’s hand is big and warm as it cups the side of his face, sliding up higher to get a good grip on his hair. Draco almost moans at the contact, the warmth and the small tug as Potter settles into his hair. He stops himself just in time; it wouldn’t do to scare Potter off, not when he is delightfully cooperative. Draco does, however, lean into the touch, as encouragement and because he wants to.
“You can’t leave me behind, I'm the one who made the plan,” Harry protests, though he is much quieter in it than before. Draco counts that as a success.
Blindly trusting as Ron might be, Harry can’t argue with his logic. Well, he probably could. Harry once argued against
Well, not all that constant. Harry remembers fear, sure, exhaustion and frustration and being much more irritable, but a lot of that was the locket poisoning their minds. Besides, there was also dancing, laughter where even a small smile had become something of a rarity. There was a
this would happen, watched as Draco agonised over how best to place the bowls and rearrange them again and again—Potter was smirking the entire time because he
around them. Harry usually gets a few hours of Grimmauld being kind after that, before he does something to upset Malfoy and the whole thing falls apart. Still, the sex is good, Malfoy’s inexperience painfully obvious at times but never a hindrance, and Harry is convinced they have finally figured out the secret to Grimmauld’s approval.)
Potter looks like a man drowning, resigned to his fate and reaching out only because that’s what is expected of him, not because he thinks it will help.
, you may kiss your husband now.” Malfoy looks pleased with himself for all but a moment, before something else flatters over his face and his eyes land on Harry because — oh, because
His mother was different, the only reason they visited Walburga Black all those years. She spent a great deal of her childhood there, visiting the family and making use of its vast library. She knew the house in better times, before dark shadows shrouded its potential. Watching the house go to ruin hurt her, that much was always obvious, but nowadays Draco knows they went to visit her aunt. Driven mad by grief, his mother claims, voice heavy with pain and a kinship that scares Draco to this day.
Sure, Ron and Hermione did pressure him into making this meeting happen, no questions about that. He might have overstated their enthusiasm, though. Ron and Hermione looked forward to meeting again about as much as Draco did, which is to say not at all. Of course they had seen each other again since Draco moved in — kind of difficult to avoid with Draco skulking about the house and them hanging around so much to make sure Harry doesn’t get another evil scar by some totally unexplainable accident — but that was mostly in passing and with the mutual understanding to not acknowledge each other.
“No, his father,” Draco snaps, because he doesn’t know how to react to the unspoken accusation. Weasley frowns even more, confused (which isn’t what Draco wanted but does help diffuse the tension). “Yes, of course,
It all comes back to it being the truth, and the truth hurts simply because that is what the truth does. It doesn't get easier when shared.
“Moody beasts? Surely you don’t mean Archibald!” Draco, with great satisfaction, watches Potter choke. “We get along famously, Archibald and me.”
Harry didn’t mean to scandalise Malfoy that first time, he just wanted to host their tradition at his finally less hostile house. Grimmauld was huffing and puffing and
“Oi, he’s awake, set him down,” someone—Weasley?—shouts and then the ground moves under Draco, increment by increment. Draco falls into the dirt. He doesn’t appreciate
that is what he did, he certainly passed something in his approaching of the bed, something with consequences that he can’t quite tell yet. A ward would make sense, more than Malfoy just happily sleeping away, completely unaware of anything —
“Malfoy, calm down! No one is getting divorced and no one is throwing anyone out, alright? Look, I'm too tired for any of this, but we’ll talk about it tomorrow, definitely, okay?” If Harry has any say in it, they are
“I’d like that.” Draco smiles at him, and Harry is gone. He has no idea how it happened, or when, but Harry is completely and irrevocably gone on Draco Malfoy.
Blaise is infamous for his terrible betting skills, despite their best efforts to keep the knowledge under wraps. That is mainly due to Blaise himself, who refuses to accept what they collectively decided must be an ancient family curse and insists on trying again and again, each time convinced that this is the time his fortunes change. It never does. It’s a good thing Blaise is undefeatable in any other form of gambling — perhaps it’s some twisted apology, or an attempt at cosmic balance, but Blaise is as unable to lose at cards as he is unable to win a bet (which led to some uncanny accidents to avoid a definite outcome when they experimented with Blaise betting on his luck in cards) — or he would have long since lost all his money to bets. As it stands, it’s only his dignity he is giving up on, which seems to be an acceptable price for his experimentation.
“You did enough, Draco. If Potter wants to be part of this friendship, let him do some of the work.” Blaise is gazing down at Draco, all grave and serious; Draco wouldn’t be surprised to learn he is being hypnotised.
Dean and Seamus are both out as ‘first to initiate contact’ — Harry needs them to balance each other and sending them
Unconventional forms of relationships, Ron said, and Harry feels like a wanker. It’s not the polyamory he has a problem with, he would request Ron punch him in the face if that were his problem, but
“What do you want me to write?” It’s a bit ironic, that Draco’s resolution to passivity starts with an act of revolt, even if just against himself and his previous mindset. Pansy is going to be proud.
“So yes, Harry, I do cling to old family traditions that are seriously daft.” Harry startles at being addressed by name, Draco’s eyes fixated on him now and piercing him with cold grey and an underlying steel Harry saw only glimpses of before. “I have nothing else guiding me anymore, because my father is a
Draco chokes on his apple, coughing violently as Potter rambles on unconcerned. Salazar's sweaty socks — what is Potter even
is entailed in a marriage. Harry managed not to think about the implications of that, about the physicality of Malfoy standing right in front of him, looking at him like he is a particularly revolting kind of cockroach. Married life is going to be
“Hang in there mate, we’ll get you out.” Weasley sounds far too amused for Draco’s taste. Isn’t Weasley supposed to be wrecked with worry? Isn’t that why he came along, because he couldn’t stand the thought of Potter being hurt and him not being there to take care of him? And now that he sees that Potter is indeed hurt, he is
“Hello Potter.” Draco smiles at him like he isn’t clutching at his door for dear life, like it hasn’t been several weeks and an ugly fight since they last saw each other, like he isn’t suddenly terrified he misread Potter’s letter and he wasn’t invited after all.
“Wolves,” Weasley whispers, and Draco wants to snap at him for being stupid and giving away their location. He would, if he weren’t so grateful to have a name for the beast in the dark. Wolves.
Most of all, Draco hates himself. He hates this affliction, hates how well it fits him and how perfectly it explains his entire life, how tightly it seals away the future Draco’s worked for. He hates how he doesn’t know what to do and that he has to drag Harry down with him, that he can’t go down quietly but has to flail around, crazed and desperate, hurting Harry even in the last act.
“We agreed that we would have dinner together once a week. First dinner is tomorrow, we need to discuss exactly how much it’s going to take to satisfy Grimmauld. It will be very awkward, but I’ve had enough of this, Malfoy either makes the house behave or I’ll throw him out.” Harry has no idea
Harry feels a little bad about his hasty escape. Malfoy is the one trapped in the cold rest of the house now and he will soon come to understand why Harry thought coming here acceptable.
It doesn’t, but Draco doesn’t want to pull off to tell him that. Instead, on the next upwards motion, he sucks particularly hard to get Potter’s attention.
Draco steps closer to Potter, to be prepared for every possibility, a speedy escape or protecting him against hungry claws. Potter, bereft of his pan and finally remembering that he conjured Draco here to protect him, presses closer against him. Draco, because he sorely missed the hero role while he was kept like a prisoner, slides an arm around Potter’s waist, pulls him closer.
“Do you make a habit of getting too drunk to find your way home?” Narcissa doesn't blink, eyes piercing through him, sharp and damning. Harry’s really shot himself in the foot with that one, hasn’t he?
“Why don’t you start with the murder attempt you claim?” That is by far the most grotesque claim and the one Potter worked himself in such a state over. They should start there and make their way down.
Draco doesn’t know what he expected, if he thought Potter might laugh at him for falling for his prank or argue with him perhaps, clear the misunderstanding this hopefully is. But Potter looks
me? I don’t think I will.” Draco stands pressed against the wall, their blanket wrapped around himself.
“The world is cruel. It’s cold and rude and people don’t care about you; only about what you can do for them. They look at you and see what they want to see; and then they cry and yell when you tell them you are someone else. They are all lying, believing in some Saviour they made up and expect me to fit but really, none of them even
Draco seriously considers cutting of his ears. A spell would work better, yes, but it seems the folly is infectious and Draco is thinking more about how to illustrate his suffering best, instead of how to end it. Which probably means it’s best he suffers in impatient silence until Potter trips and needs saving and they can move on. Apparently that is Draco’s life now, saving Potter out of ridiculous scenarios that he himself created. Draco wishes he could hate the prospect more than he does.
Harry wishes there was something else, something to think about that isn’t his meltdown, Draco’s horrible secret he as good as told, or their ragged breathing. Out of the three of them, Harry can only hope to hyper-fixate on the breathing. Which gets
No, Draco couldn’t have known and this is Potter’s fault. Potter got angry and made Draco feel horrible enough that he called
The kiss was… there is no good way to say this — it was bad. It was wet and gross and revolting and invasive — it was what Draco expected, what he remembered, but so much worse. Draco thought that was only
And then suddenly, Harry is holding Malfoy. He can feel his rapid breathing, his muscles drawn tight, everything in him poised to take flight. But Harry also feels the same calm from before seep into him, Malfoy fitting against his body as if they were designed to stand together like this, his hands grabbing at the back of Harry’s shirt and his face buried against his neck, desperately holding on.
What’s even more puzzling though — infernal bags of fur? What on earth is Malfoy talking — the ferrets! Harry had forgotten Malfoy insists on hating them. As if Harry didn’t see him surreptitiously patting them behind books raised suspiciously highly, feeding them scraps of dinner under the table when he doesn’t think Harry notices or ordering all that expensive and unnecessary shampoo — admittedly, it smells really good and make their fur very shiny — to bath them (
? He figures it’s too late for the ‘politely averted eyes’ plan, though, which only leaves the flight forward.
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy says he as takes off his own family ring. Harry is vaguely aware of the officer gasping at the reveal of his status and identity, but he doesn’t have the brain-capacity or interest for smug triumph—Harry is all taken up by Malfoy, looking at him seriously and meeting his eyes, holding them. “Will you accept this ring as sign of my undying love and devotion? Will you wear it to honour the bond between us and be my partner in all the days to come?”
It’s somewhat creepy, that their life is being manipulated and orchestrated by a house adhering to all the worst things about pure-blood culture (and that is a difficult choice to make, Ron complained about it for at least an hour, talking about traditions and how it's only ever the bad ones that stick), but Harry can think about that later, when he isn’t running in danger of losing his toes to the cold.
Apparently a spouse trying to murder him over the dinner table is alright, though. Or maybe that’s just because it’s
“Well, then it seems to me that the marriage must qualify in the eyes of Grimmauld or you might as well divorce the git. The really archaic traditions expect a public consummation ceremony, you know? I think in comparison you got really lucky there.” Ron looks like the conversation is physically painful to him and he would rather be anywhere else. It’s a bit insulting, especially since Harry had to sit through hours of Ron drooling over Hermione, which was very weird and uncomfortable, and lately Parkinson too and really, Harry could have been a lot more graphic and made this even worse for Ron.
Draco is terrified Potter will decide he isn’t worth it, that he is too much effort, too many opinions that don’t fit with Potter’s.
Malfoy looks around, stepping elegantly out of the floo and dusting sooth off his clothes, sneering at the remains of their dinner and frowning at the general state of the living room. The only thing that betrays his surprise and indicates that he didn't plan on being here are his wide eyes and the fact that he didn't insult them yet. Apparently Harry can summon Malfoy; just the skill he always wanted to have.
talk an awful lot about him, worse than in 6th year.” Hermione too? Is this some sort of intervention? Aren’t they supposed to have a banner and cards prepared with texts about how much they love him before they list his flaws?
are the one who got weird! It’s not my fault you have hang ups about sharing a bed and ran out of here the second you realised
“Monster!” Draco yells again, the beast not paying him any attention. He doesn’t let himself be discouraged by that. “I am here to save the Damsel in Distress!”
Blaise and Theo don’t even have the good grace to feign shame, heads bend back over their scribbles, both of them whispering furiously and gesticulating widely.
“Of course you couldn’t have known! I didn’t think of that at all, you never seemed to struggle with them before and—” Draco cuts him off, awkwardly draping his head over Potter’s, pulling him against his chest.
Changing that heavily biased approach had been what Harry hoped to achieve, of course, but over the months of marriage and every tiny detail needing cutthroat negotiating and concessions, Harry had as good as given up on it.
Well, so, maybe Draco didn’t promise to love Harry. He does anyway, all out of his own free will, and that means he should make sure no one says anything… unflattering. Calling him weird, making fun of the fact that Harry quite literally saved all their lives —
“Potter, are you—” Draco isn’t sure where this question would have gone were it not for Weasley, finally catching up with them.
Harry marvels at Malfoy's dedication to making his mother happy (because that is who he is doing it all for, Harry knows from Ron who knows from Parkinson, so he feels the information can be trusted, unlikely as it seems) in the rooms they never used anyway, the countless parlous and guest rooms. It’s harder to watch him clear out rooms they spend a good amount of time in, the living room and kitchen reduced to their essentials, Harry’s bedroom packed up into neatly labelled boxes one day suddenly. Harry has to remind himself that that was the deal, that Malfoy could do whatever he wants in the house.
For his part, Harry doesn’t actually mind holding Malfoy up, wrapped around him as he is, fitting quite neatly into Harry’s arms. Wait, no! This is
Harry has no idea what to say to that, neither about his own parents nor about parents in general and certainly not about Draco’s parents. Then Draco looks up at him and Harry doesn’t think he could talk if he wanted to. There is something dark lurking in his eyes, shadows pooling, making his skin pale and eyes impossibly huge.
“You made it,” Weasley says through tears of laughter, making to hug her—which could potentially be problematic, hair near open flames and all—but Granger is about as amused as Draco is with the entire scene, dumping a load of snow on Weasley.
"Boys, please, attention back to me." Harry has no idea how long they made ridiculous faces (clearly he was winning) when Hermione interrupts them. She cleared up her papers, all neatly stacked and the books closed. She has come to her final judgement, and Harry better listen to her.
Oh no, this isn’t good. If Draco realises what this means, namely that Harry is extremely ticklish, then — Draco smirks at him, sharp and dangerous, and Harry has about half a second for the dawning horror before Draco is on him again, cruelly digging his fingers into Harry’s sides and grinning like a madman as Harry shrieks.
“The stars, I never got the stars,” Potter admits, though he doesn’t sound like is aware of the confession he is making.
How long has he waited to reveal this to Harry? How long has he held onto the thought of one day — this day — turning the tables on Harry, making him pay for what Harry did to him?
“Okay, that is bullshit and I need you to acknowledge that. You existed long before you knew Potter—I should know, you have been an annoying pain in my arse even before Hogwarts—and you can manage without him. If Potter prefers to wallow in the pains of the war and not accept help, he’s not someone you want close, is he?” Blaise looks sternly down at Draco, holding him still until Draco agrees.
job to do that. So he jumped, followed Potter down on instinct alone, no consultation with his brain. It’s in falling that his brain pipes back up, pointing out that, logically, he doomed them both.
Potter litters kisses down his neck and along his collar bone, biting and licking and sucking, spreading heat and leaving marks Draco knows will be impossible to cover without magic. Usually, he wouldn’t allow himself to be marked like this, for some convenient fool with grand aspiration to stake his claim on Draco. But
Draco is quite proud. He’ll have to tell Mary about their resounding success. (And apologise for his unannounced absence; heartbroken or not, that was rude.)
“No moving. I got you cleaned up but I didn’t get a chance to look at your nose yet, don’t you dare startle it back into bleeding—I’ll make you clean that round!” Potter. Draco doesn’t need to see him—he would very much
“Mufasa,” Weasley says, like that makes any sense. Granger makes a stifled noise, realising what it is Weasley means, and they stand there, looking at each other in horror, eyes darting between them and Draco and the cliff, the point where the mountain ends.
Sometimes Draco gets overwhelmed by how much they care, how much they pick up on without him having to openly admit to it. Like his completely disproportionate dread of this evening. So, grateful and terrified, Draco only manages a weak nod that will simply have to be enough for Blaise.
of favouritism, wasn’t ending this the entire motivation to marry the git? — so we spend a lot of our time loitering in the same room. Malfoy adapts that imperious silence that is supposed to make me feel inferior and constantly drawing those renovation plans of his; mostly it's just annoying. So when I’m being kind and considerate by reminding that he doesn’t need to strain his pretty little head by planning all that because there is no way I’ll allow him to implement any of the changes he sketches, Malfoy inevitably says something ugly, and it’s
“Nothing about this is simple, Ron!” Harry winces at his outburst, tea sloshing over his hands and soaking his clothes.
“I accept,” Harry says, because he couldn’t say anything else, couldn’t even think to do so. . How could he ever say no to this man?
It’s also not all simple, however, and Draco is naturally inclined to take the other route and deny there is something wrong. With enough imagination, you can fool yourself into believing anything.
There is nothing there. There is a burned stripe deep into the forest, yes, and there are imprints of its feet everywhere, but there is no
“Are you alright, Malfoy?” Potter stands a few feet away, hair mussed and glasses askew, breathing hard and staring at Draco’s lips. For one moment, Draco had forgotten about his presence.
That decided, Draco has very little to occupy his mind, nothing to distract him from the terrifying depth of the water beneath them, nothing but the tiny boat protecting them, humanity’s obstreperous construction to explore a realm not meant for them.
If he is honest, terrifyingly honest, Harry has enough of being Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World ™. Maybe he will be happier as Harry Black.
Malfoy doesn't move, sitting impossibly still. His eyes have gone wide, dramatically so since Harry is able to make it out in the low light, and pulls the blankets up and around his body, shielding himself in a flimsy cocoon of useless fabric.
It could be almost domestic, their own brand of it. And sure, this isn’t what he pictured, but Harry always wanted a family. He had hoped that it would be a better one than a prejudiced house and difficult-on-principle husband. But to get nothing at all? To be stuck in a marriage with Malfoy, who expects him to perform tricks for his attention (which again, wouldn’t be too bad, Harry likes proving Malfoy wrong after all, but it would be nice if Malfoy were to give him
, as tall as a dragon but build like a centaur. It’s also an unfortunate shade of blue and has long black hair, clinging to its neck in wet strands. It consists solely of obscenely bulging muscle and bad smell, most likely stemming from a bad diet and questionable personal hygiene (this thing could use a manicure, that’s all Draco is willing to say on these nails).
“Baking?” Draco asks, because he can’t appear more like an idiot, so he might as well make extra sure.
Draco feels like Potter punched him in the gut, so intense is the contact, hot and heavy even through of layer of clothes. Draco has been so hard for so long, ignored it and pushed it down to focus on Potter—he is strung tight as it goes, close to ripping from the strain alone.
and not a stranger? It doesn’t matter who you marry, after all, and I’m sure there are plenty of people out there who would be thrilled at the prospect of marrying you; much easier than talking
First he gathers his plans together, collects them from various surfaces — even from on top of the cupboards (more correct would be to say that
Harry grins at him, much broader than Draco thought him capable so early in the morning. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
Weasley looks back at him, eyes a starling blue, and for one moment, Draco sees the man who stood steady by Potter’s side as he died to save the world. There is calm, an understanding passing between them that goes beyond the principle of their mutual dislike. Weasley nods.
Malfoy stops and glances up from where he was inspecting the ward — looking for a way to break it, Harry hopes, he really doesn’t want to be stuck here — to favour him with a look that implies that Harry is the biggest idiot on the planet for having to ask. Is that supposed to answer the question? Or is Malfoy just going to ignore him, apart from the occasional derisive sneer? Harry might put up with that where only himself is concerned, but this is about his friends, and Harry won’t stand for Parkinson doing — whatever it is she plans on doing. She was far too excited at the prospect for it to have been something positive.
"Harry, Ron told me Grimmauld ate all your food?" Hermione has this particular talent to make everything she says sound at once worried and accusing, conveying her disappointment in a very simple yet thorough manner. "Ron will be right through with the food, he's looking for the Good Plates."
Alright, Draco will admit that this wouldn’t be all that bad, where it not for the water. Draco isn’t too fond of that part.
Potter, it seems, does not appreciate the truth. (Honestly, who would? The truth is terrible.) He scoffs, blowing a rebellious lock of hair out of his eye, to be settled higher onto his forehead. It would be endearing if Potter didn’t look so annoyed with Draco.
“Keep your voice down, my head hurts.” Draco wonders if Potter has anything against the impending headache, a potion or even just something to cool the swelling. Draco feels like an Erumpent stomped on him and really, that isn’t an experience he needed in his life.
Draco resolutely thinks of nothing but Potter caught in a tight grip above him. He thinks of Potter smiling at him and promising this to be the last time, just one more. Draco thinks of Potter and his smiles and how they make Draco feel warm and he runs between the monster’s legs, cutting the sinew in both his front heels.
Still disgruntled from being ripped out of his perfect dream of getting rid of Malfoy before their new deal starts, Harry tries to pull his hand away and throw Ron out again (because he is
Until Draco came along and stealthily started vanishing Harry’s bitterly fought for furniture. He didn’t notice at first — who actively notes their furniture? You don’t expect stuff to go missing — and when he did finally catch on it was far more amusing to watch Draco thinking himself oh so secretive. Harry never brought it up.
The renovations of Grimmauld are coming along well, Draco reassured him, but as far as Harry can see they are still living with nothing but the bare essentials, uncomfortable and sworn to be only temporary. For some inane reason, Draco insisted on not having any real furniture in the house during the process, and the first rooms he made livable again are the guest rooms and the countless parlours Harry didn’t even know about. Magic space, that’s what it must be, it’s ineffable. Or Grimmauld deeming him too plebeian to lay his eyes on the noble splendour.
“Why not? You certainly had no problems with it before.” Draco doesn’t mean it as an accusation, but Harry flinches and clearly takes it as such.
He lays there long enough, thinking and trying not to, to decide that, if the dragon were to kill him, it would have done so already. Draco is breathing normally again, the heat has receded from his skin, and he is getting restless. (Smug, he is triumphant and smug because there has been no sign of the dragon and Draco is beginning to think he might have won.)
Figuring there is nothing for it but to try and find out, Draco leans forward to sniff the plant, too.
how Draco tells him: insensitive and rude. It worked, though, and Potter frowns at the book as if only now realising it’s crumbling into dust at the sudden exposure to light.
is charitable. The movement is clumsy and his fingers not nimble enough to really express anything refined. But the general idea seems to be crude anyway, not something fit for polite company—wait, is Weasley talking about a
“I don’t know, that’s a lot you are asking. All I can promise is that I’ll try.” Draco chances a glance up at Harry, afraid to see his face shut down because it’s not good enough, because he needs better than Draco’s reassurances that he’ll try his hardest.
, and he didn’t think protesting against fox skins would break what they were slowly building, rescue after rescue.
“How long have you hated my touch?” Harry forces himself to look Draco in the eyes, because that, too, is something he
“My father let me down, I thought back then. Now I think I just wasn’t prepared for the truth, to realise that he is only human. Fallible. Fragile.” Draco still speaks in that horribly hallow tone, as if the whole thing doesn’t concern him at all, grown numb to his pain.
“You mean if you possessed more empathy than you like to admit and ached for Potter and his fate? If you raged against the entire world on his behalf more fearsomely than you did on your own? If you wanted for him to spend his time free of pain and sorrow and smiling at you?” Blaise doesn’t even have the decency to look away, staring Draco right in the eyes and keeping contact as he speaks his truths like knives.
No matter. Draco will get his Potter back, not this bland doll, and then they will talk about this. There will be shouting and insults and Potter glaring at him and Draco feeling seized by his gaze, this undeniable connection of crackling static—it will be glorious. Draco simply has to get Potter to move, wake up to the world around him, the world he saved. It would be a shame for Potter to sleep on all the things he died for.
Harry curses silently, he was so close to sleep already! Maybe, if he doesn’t react, Malfoy will think him still asleep and leave him alone? A foolish hope perhaps, but Harry doesn’t want to deal with him right now, not when he is quasi almost asleep already.
A howl breaks the quiet, breaks it like a stone in water, sends ripples through the entire, doomed lake. Draco flinches, presses himself back against the door, hopes to suppress the trembling.
The moment he turns to go Malfoy takes notice (possibly he announced his plans, too, Harry doesn’t feel fond enough of the git to credit him with perception) and — with some truly foul spell — snatches Harry’s coffee right out of his hand, away from where he had it cradled against his chest for the pleasant warmth and the scent in his nose. Malfoy doesn’t care, as he cruelly abducts Harry’s only friend this morning.
Potter doesn’t sleep anymore. Draco doesn't care; they all cope differently and Draco knows a thing or two about avoiding the nightmares. That’s exactly the problem, though: Draco doesn’t sleep either.
I could tell you all of that, could tell you that I understand your pain because I suffered it, too, but would you believe me? Would you read my words and understand them to be a desperate attempt to help?
He couldn’t. For all his recent exposure and his research, Draco couldn’t stand the thought. But he trained, and he got better. Sex, Draco knows, will either save or condemn his marriage.
Once Draco realised Harry wasn’t going to change his mind and accost him, things almost got pleasant. Perhaps pleasant isn’t the right word — surreal? Is there a good word to describe the staggering leap in intimacy they did? Something to catch the embarrassment of spilling his ridiculous fears of being rejected, the elation of Harry calling him by his first name that shouldn’t feel as gratifying as it does, the blossoming warmth where before Draco could convince himself there was nothing but the cold agreements of deals and contracts. There is no such word Draco can think of, nothing he ever experienced before, but he thinks he likes it.
Harry is grateful for it. He doesn’t like when his mind goes there, falling back into war-mode and trying to trace where a sick and twisted mind that yearned to be eternal would hide its soul. Questioning everything served Harry quite well during the war, but it does him no favours in the aftermath. It doesn’t make peace and closure easy.
Draco doesn’t watch their flirting as he goes in hunt of the button. He doesn’t like this, a feeling that isn’t helped by how comfortable Weasley is here. After all, he enjoyed the forest too, once Draco dealt with the wolves and they found Potter, after he was turned into a candlestick. Was that a movie reference, too?
“Okay, first off, don’t you dare say anything against my friends. I can call them useless, you can’t.” Weasley nods, conceding the point and Draco goes on: “This isn’t about my friends, anyway. I’m here to ask about Potter.”
“Come here, Potter,” he demands and Potter, miraculously, obliges with a smile. Potter truly is a wondrous man.
(Actually, scratch that, it’s way too soon to think about marriage. It’s embarrassing how gone he is on Potter.)
"Was?" Draco raises an eye brow and brushes back Harry's bangs while grabbing his chin. Harry giggles.
Surprise sparked in Draco's eyes, watching Harry descend down on his lips. He felt him nip at his bottom lip ever so gently, and Draco sighed with pleasure. He wrapped his arms at the customary place behind Harry's neck, and opened his mouth to deepen their kiss. Harry ran his fingers across Draco's wet hair, causing him to shiver even though they somehow started to burn up. And Harry moaned as Draco tugged on his hair while sucking on his tongue.
"Now, I'm not trying to get out another revenge against him or settle the score or even undermine his position to you all if that is what you are thinking, I'm trying to say that many of you thought you knew Harry and could deliver this but really only Hermione and I can; we know the real Harry, you only know the Harry that he decides you should know which is why we need to explain that to you so many times, you insufferable half-brains!" He leaned back some and watched the chaos he created with a grin. Once he deemed long enough, he cleared his throat and continued once their chattering stopped.
For some reason, tears sprang into my eyes. My shoulders started to shake as I wiped them away, biting my lip. "Merlin," I hiccuped. "What's wrong with me?"
"Does that mean you aren't real? I'm just imagining?" Draco furrowed his eyebrows, not liking this part of the deal.
Of course, none of them included a certain green-eyed hero that stole his heart one very important night to her knowledge. Nor any one else's
"I could never force you into betraying your values for my own selfish benefit," he panted, a sheen of sweat appearing as he picked up the pace. "I can't believe you even agreed-
"I, uh, well..." Harry struggled to find a way to answer without telling him the truth. Seamus, who had sat down closest to the book, picked it up and read the title out loud.
Harry made a surprise entrance at the Gryffindor table. Hermione, knowing of his condition, immediately stood up to help. He waved her down. Seamus, who also knew, didn't bother get up in fear of getting hit again and in guilt. Guilt that came as soon as Harry spoke his first sentence.
"What!" Draco huffed, wiping his cheek. "I did not! I didn't even touch you, but you spat on me. Eww..." He grimaced as he looked at his hand, choosing to wipe it on Harry's robe.
By the time Draco had blown off his steam and went inside his Common room, Blaise was there with the important piece of information. "So, Mr. I'm-not-gay-but-I'm-Potter's-Lover, explain yourself." He asked smugly. Draco flopped down onto a chair and ignored Blaise's hickeys.
"This will be the last time I make myself clear. I AM NOT GAY. Do you read me?" Draco snarled. Seamus quickly nodded his head and Draco stormed off again. He had to sprint to catch up.
"I copied this from...a book that my father gave me," he continued, briefly looking up during his pause to measure my reaction. I remained blank out of politeness. "It was the only thing I could find that was even remotely tied to the subject." Again, he was testing my resolve. Obviously the magic involved is not the kind you'd lightly cast in front of your grandmother. It made me wonder more about what Plan B contained.
"Fine!" He snapped, sitting up. "I'm not completely okay. I have a bloody insane headache, and I'm still suffering from after effects of that damn curse I received thanks to no-good-bloody-you. Now, give me my damned potions." Harry gave him a look and he groaned. "
Smirking, he reached for his goblet. "Funny, I was sure that the dark-haired man with blazing emerald eyes and lightning-bolt scar that I slept with was only some psychopath from a society that adores you."
"Just a little while, Drakie-poo." Harry said mockingly in a very high pitched voice, using their pet-names that they had come up with out of boredom. He started to cackle like mad as he ran away into the bathroom.
Well, anyways, I got up a bit stiffly since, you know, and went up to my dormitory to take a shower. Felt like it would be a nice way to freshen up after last night. Unfortunately for me, I didn't check the time. So the Common Room was practically full. And I entered looking, for all the world, like I had just had sex. Glasses slightly askew, hair even more messed up, bruised lips, maybe a few marks I hadn't noticed yet and all. I'm sure you see what everyone else did.
"I'm not suicidal like you, Harry!" Draco said running away, squeaking when Harry started to catch up to him after than comment.
"I'm a Gryffindor. I rush head-first into things," I managed to pull out of the hair's breadth between us. "When am I ever sure about anything?"
"Let me guess, Dumbledore told you--because we are supposed to be partners--to spend the day with me in order to establish friendship or some sugarcoated, merry, rainbows everywhere, sunshine-y faces thing?" He drawled with boredom.
Seamus wolf-whistled in the silence. Notorious mate himself, you know. "Way to go, Potter," he cheered, giving a few claps. "First ever walk of shame and on Christmas too, eh? Not bad work mate,"
Blaise smiled into the food that he was actually eating. "Because my boyfriend is about to slink over here and tell me how his plan went. Now, eat something. Harry wouldn't want you to be skin and bones when he returns now, would he?" Draco ignored him in favour of watching whomever was Blaise's boyfriend.
He kissed me again, a lot less hesitantly and I responded, arching under his contact. He moaned into my mouth and I shivered. I felt a forbidden thrill excite my frame. What were doing was
He nodded at my permission and froze before becoming lax and I closed my eyes to the feeling of being filled. It was nicer than I thought. But definitely odd and uncomfortable for longer than a few seconds; it had to be scourigified away. He collapsed next to me and we both listened to the other in order to control our breathing.
"Never!" Harry replied, completing them a lot slower and a bit more shakily than Draco. So then the score was 9-7, Draco then leading by 2. Now the score was 14-13, Draco only just behind. And all he had to do was spin three times in mid-air, hang off his broom for 25 seconds, climb on backwards and do the Wronski Feint. Piece of cake, right?
So, Draco and Harry went to school, putting their plan into action. Dumbledore officially announced at the Welcoming Feast that the Malfoys were working for the Light, and that Voldemort and his Death Eaters were no more. Everyone cheered, and Harry toasted to Draco and Draco to him secretly as everyone was in merriment. But of course, Dumbledore saw this and winked his always twinkling eyes at them. And they both groaned inwardly knowing that he had actually somehow gotten what he wanted like always.
-green shot out from Harry's wand and hit Voldemort square in the chest, killing him instantly and all the Death Eaters too. (Besides Snape and Lucius, whom had taken a potion to prevent such dropping-down-dead from happening. "Unfit for a Malfoy to die like a common fly," Lucius had remarked, no one knew if he was joking or not.) As dizziness threatened to overcome him, Harry goes over to check if his charge, Draco Malfoy, was still alive; and he was relieved to find out that he was. Then, just as he was about to faint, he kicked Voldemort's head and snarled, "And I'm bisexual, bitch."
Seventh year at Hogwarts started out well: having You-Know-Who sent to You-Know-Where. The Malfoys formally revealed their alliance to the Light and nobody was out to kill them in revenge as all the other actual Death Eaters were dead as a door nail. In fact, Harry and Draco declared a truce and became fast friends. Like, very fast. The two became so close that they even took turns sleeping in the other's House and swapped clothing. Somehow, Hermione and Ron weren't at all bothered by this; although, it was hard to believe that a single thought even had time to go through Hermione's head about anything, the couple was snogging so much.
Being ever so blunt as always, Ron blurted, "So, what's wrong with you, Harry?" before he even sat down.
"Dragons." Harry said wistfully, imagining the majestic fire-breathing beasts and reminiscing about all the thrilling times he spent around them in his head. He raised an eyebrow at Draco's cough, noticing a faint blush. "What?"
Now he almost rushed to within an inch of the List and he stared at it for awhile. I could see his mouth move but not hear the words as he swayed his wand back and forth with a flourish right at the end up and down directly at the List. Then there was a flash. I felt his body being flung aside into me with a surprised grunt from both of us. We fell to the floor from the power of momentum and sat there, breathing and coughing and blinking away dust.
"You mean, the fact that you gave up your virginity to me or your whole hero-complex in general?" he teased.
"Wha--Where am I?" Draco asks, blinking himself to awareness. His head was throbbing more than painfully, and his hands were twitching a bit. He appeared to be lying on a hospital bed. He turned to look at his surroundings and saw Harry wringing his hands on the edge of his seat, staring at himself with a whole lot of concern in those green eyes. "And what are you doing here?" He spat.
"Well, besides the fact that Voldemort is dead, I guess it's because its a new day, the sun is shinning...and I get to spend this glorious time with the only person in the whole wide world that still hates my guts." Draco was nearly smothered by the sarcasm in his voice.
"So, Draco, how about we get to know each other?" He flopped down, with some grace, onto the chair he was originally in.
untoward to his wife. She needn't be plagued by matters that may or may not involve him in certain completely shrouded but still possibly immoral dealings.
"Oh, so does little Potter and junior traitor Malfoy care for each other? I didn't know that you were that way for all the people you hated,
A flash of a smile and then his lips were on mine. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth to him. Both of us now clumsy and inarticulate in our ways, but determined. His natural prowess showed eventually and I lost my breath, pulling away to gasp as he shed his outer robes.
"Funny, I also was sure that the drop dead sexy blond with amazing silver eyes who was making love to me was a maniac from a society that adores you." Draco placed his goblet on the table.
." Potter spoke, his cheerful facade now overtly cracking with his suppressed anger. He then took a deep breath and exhaled loudly. "Ah, fresh air. Come, breath it with me." He continued to breath, eyes closed like that, even as Draco just stared dumbly at him. "I don't hear you breathing..." Draco just shook his head. "Breath, dammit." Potter growled and Malfoy glared at him as he picked up whatever this nonsense was.
"I may be getting off track by my passion to show you the 360° Harry, so excuse me and this sentence please; but now I think you are ready for my concluding debate:
"You know, they say body heat is the quickest way to warm up." Draco nodded along as Harry spoke, quaking like a leaf, just about prepared to do anything Harry asked of him. But then Harry sneezed.
," he sighed as he came down from his laughing binge, wiping his eyes. I shivered at the way he said my name. It was eerily similar to how Hermione exasperatedly said mine whenever I got a stupid idea in my head that I didn't realize was stupid at the time. "No, I meant I need to take someone
"Then it's settled. Ask me any question you want and I'll tell you as much truth as I can." Harry flashed him a toothy smirk and Draco sent one back.
Harry smiled at him like he was a silly child, or maybe like he enjoyed Draco's venom. "Headquarters, of course. And you are still my charge until the end of summer, remember? So I'm responsible for you. " Of course Draco remembered. He would always remember spending any amount of time with Potter unwillingly. He would always remember the old coot forcing them to be partners in the war over what should have been a happy, no-school-so-I-don't-see-Potter-and-his-lackeys summer with that stupid twinkle in his eyes.
Draco was half tempted to say 'because she's a mudblood' but refrained from doing so; there were only so many jokes he could get away with today, after all. "I'm sure Harry would want me to give the testimony, besides, I am the only one with a completed script. So, sit back down Mr. Weasley, I overrule you." Snickers came from his loyal snakes and a few others, giving him a confident smirk.
"You all know who I am, what I've done, so please, if anyone has any objections to me speaking for Harry object now or forever hold your peace." He scanned the crowd and none surprisingly, Ronald Weasley stood up with help of his cane.
"Should I be asking if you really are Potter instead?" he drawled and for the first time, I could understand why the girls loved him despite his horrible treatment of well, everyone, at one time. There was an undercurrent of warmth and a hint of intimacy that made me shiver.
"Alright," I said, clearing my throat. "I'll, um, I'll bottom is it?" I wasn't too sure on the technical terms, you see.
, hmm, I remember this book. It had a lot of information about male pairings and male pregnancy. Now, I wonder why our hero would read such a book...Are you gay?"
"So, the plan..." I urged. Nothing like secrecy in the middle of the night to get someone excited. But, er, not like it sounded. Merlin...
"I doubt any of you know- not even you, 'Mione..." Here, he allowed himself a smile at being able to withhold information from the notorious Granger. "that these are my wedding vows to Harry..." He raised his hand to show the sparkling diamond and engagement ring on his left hand. Their wedding was a secret one, even to close friends. "...slightly changed to fit this sad and somber occasion though, to prove to you how much and why I believe that Harry had all of these traits that he is now buried with."
"So that explains why we are so young. I didn't think you could get sexual dreams when you were that old." Draco laughed.
The first time that Draco awoke after that night, it was near the middle of summer. Draco groaned once he realized he was awake, startling Harry out of his zoned-outness. "Draco...Draco?" He said softly, using Malfoy's first name for the first time.
I did really care about him though. Er, for him. Once. Well, I still do but not...but not like that, I mean, I don't bloody fancy him or anything. Not like he isn't...urgh! Whatever. Why is it so hard for one straight guy to compliment another guy?
Never mind. It's unimportant, or what would Hermione--oh yeah, unrelevant or whatever. It doesn't relate to anything going on in my story. Well, I mean, it did help the speed of my acceptance since, for a guy, he is pretty-
Harry and Draco were decidedly not bored anymore as they reached their last days of vacation. But a new problem had arisen.
"Oh." He said after awhile, moving to sit down by Draco. "I guess that was obvious. But, hey, you do act more gay."
"Yeah, well, that's obviously not true," he muttered again. He was fond of those. I guess he just didn't like admitting nice things and he must've done a lot of them. You know, 'cause of him being on the Nice List and all and obviously he had to do things to get on there.
Draco somehow managed not to laugh during his read, but he exchanged glances with Harry wondering if he told her any of this stuff. And he gave Harry a quick smile when he read about the engagement plans of his. He figured that Harry couldn't get past the title, so, might as well. Smirking, he reached for his goblet and spoke to him nonchalantly, into it. "Funny, I was sure that the dark-haired man with blazing emerald eyes and lightning-bolt scar that I slept with was only some psychopath from a society that adores you." Clearly, as everyone was listening and watching them, he only had to raise his voice a little for the whole Hall to hear. Now he just hoped Harry got his point.
"Do what? Fall in love with boys? The-Boy-Who-Lived-Lives-For-Boys...and you sickened me before." The Death Eaters roared with laughter. You could practically see the steam coming out of Harry's ears.
"Don't laugh, but...hippogriffs." Harry couldn't help it. He laughed at the absurdity of it. Draco scowled at him. "I said don't laugh!" He threw a pillow that hit Potter smack in the face, which only further increased his laughter. After awhile, Draco started in too. Until, that is, when Harry whacked him behind the head with the pillow he threw, sniggering from time to time.
busy with school-work and paying attention to my lessons this time around. It was almost like being in sixth-year with my obsession on catching him in the middle of something incriminating, in the sense that all I saw was the same brief glimpses of him like before. I'm pretty sure he wasn't involved in any underhand dealings--some doubt, you know, because he is a Slytherin after all--because I listened to the rumours going around about him. That's really the only way I heard about him; I kept tabs on him for whatever reason. I don't know...let's go with Fate, or maybe compassion for the fellow man, my hero-complex even, me being a Gryffindor through and through. I really don't know. I mean it, I don't.
I watched him furiously--to the ignorant eye--and heart-brokenly in a fast speed--to the knowing--write out his fifteen sentence monologue to give to Harry. I was clueless, for once, as to why he was scripting out only fifteen sentences; Ronald and nearly all of our former class of Gryffindor was going to be there and he knew better than to possibly ignite my husband's fury by giving a less than adequate speech. Especially at tomorrow's services.
"I know what doesn't tickle..." he murmured before kissing him oh so sweetly. Harry couldn't help the sigh that fell out of his mouth.
He snorted, but looked a little more at ease. "And will your infamous curiosity hold you to your also rather notorious morals?" It didn't have any of his usual bite.
nothing to him, because he was dead.  Unfortunately, they still meant some things to the living, especially this one living person in particular.
He tugged her down the path his carefully-excited son was treading, knowing that her body had ceased its defensive bristling though not sated of her curiosity. "I merely have received concurrence to a dearly-awaited rain-check," he continued in a soothing tone, which finally set her at ease. After all, he had many rain-checks of important Ministry meetings which she was also aware that needed dealing with as soon as possible.
He could barely focus--the answer was obviously going to be yes, he just had to find a clever and just as sickeningly sweet way to respond. And he found it in the glowing text of a headline they read. He muttered the spell as fast as he could, nervous for no reason, as he passed the newspaper back once more. As he expected, Draco took one look at the new addition he created, his big smile with a touch of the haughty smirk Harry had grown fond of for some reason, and found himself pulled up into a much more passionate kiss. He let the newspaper go to fly up in the air and everyone else's eyes went to it, reading the new title:
Draco stutters a bit in his rant as Harry pulls him close to eliminate the last bit of distance between them, and then, Harry abruptly remembers that this is fake, that they are pretending for Narcissa's sake. Harry is about to get up with some vague excuse, give Draco some space, and sit back down far away — because exploiting this situation is
She — what? Draco pulls his hands away, gaping at her, trying to understand what just happened as Pansy laughs at him. Oh that insidious little —
what he planned on saying—handsome, Harry wanted to say handsome—but Malfoy blushes and Harry doesn’t care about the rest. What kind of stupid plan was that anyway, one that didn’t lead to Malfoy blushing? Not the kind of plan Harry is interested in, that’s for sure.
with that comb. It’s not only dastardly ugly but shimmering in something darker, sticking to it, something oily that smears its viscous darkness on everything it touches. It pulses in a sedate flare of ill-intention, a curse beating deep within it, pushing its bad magic into Potter and keeping him under, drowning him in it.
Harry wishes Neville were here. Neville would know what to do, he is kind and warm and used to coaxing plants to grow more and greener, Neville would calm Draco right down. Just Harry’s luck that Neville has a surprisingly erratic schedule for a gardener, resulting in him being less of a stable at movie night than they would like.
Draco only half conscious is a beautiful thing, Harry has learnt that quickly. It didn’t take him long to appreciate it either, the lazy grabbing motions Draco makes after sex, like he is coming out of a trance, seeking touch with the grace of a stumbling baby rabbit and an ethereal shimmer granted to him by his pale complexion. Harry could stare at him for hours, just laying here and going up in lethargy.
the plan, Harry rather wanted to get out of Grimmauld today. He already had more than he can handle without snapping, the ever-present air of self-satisfaction suffocating and itching. How one is supposed to recover from a war in this environment is a mystery to him. It feels like Harry is still fighting, only the foe is new.
Draco twists, Harry jumps, and then Harry is dragged over the back of the couch, landing in the world’s most uncomfortable sprawl on the couch.
“Perfect, thank you, darling.” Draco softly pushes Potter back down into the chair, shivers at the wild look Potter gives him when their eyes meet again. Draco has driven Potter to the brink of insanity, and they are both going to topple over.
Then again, even if that wasn’t enough to condemn him, Draco also trusted Harry to come up with the best tactic to get access to his room, pack whatever speaks to him at the moment (Draco has prepared a list, something else he will deny because Harry caught one glance at it and laughed, claiming that this kind of decisions can’t be made on paper but needs to be done in person, speaking judgement when rational thoughts are drowned out by sentimentality) and get them back out smoothly, without his parents being the wiser for it.
“Come on, Malfoy, dance with me. If you impress me, I might even show you where Muggles keep their stars; you can lecture me about why they are the best and tell me what the Muggles did wrong in labelling them.” Potter smiles at Draco, his arms still slung around his waist, waiting for permission to twirl them.
Until then, it seems they’ll have to just go on like this, placidly sitting in the same room, Harry yearning and Malfoy pretending to study his secret plans. Not what Harry expected, not what Harry expected at all. He thought Malfoy might share his blueprints, if only to rub them under Harry’s nose and show off how brilliant he is. They would fight about what modifications Malfoy is allowed to do with the house, because fighting is what they
“Would you excuse me,” Draco says, the words phrased like a question but none of it actually up to debate. He is already getting up, leaving the table. Harry messed up.
tense, enough so for Draco to question if it’s a good idea to place those hands upon himself, but he does it anyway. He wants them to be close, connected, wants to feel exactly what he is doing to Potter. These hands belong onto him the same way that, right now,
“It was a metaphor. I want you to meet my mother, I want you to exist out there, in that wonderful, fascinating, infuriating world you saved. Because, if I’m honest, it’s none of these things without you. It’s a dull thing, Potter, to live without you. I don’t want to do it anymore, so I think we should both go back to life.” Draco holds Potter’s hand, holds his eyes, hopes that even just a smidge of the things he is feeling comes through in his words. He has nothing but himself to convince Potter, nothing but his earnest plea.
Perhaps that is why he looks like he is having a nightmare and isn’t even allowed expressing it. Or maybe there is no peace for Potter, not even in death.
should be the one to write on Potter’s unexpected reappearance. (Well, Draco did a lot of asking and even more snooping to find Potter again. It’s less of a reappearance and more of a discovery, he supposes, but that just doesn’t have the same ring to it.) Someone will write it, after all, so it better be someone who doesn’t butcher Potter past recognition. Those people will write on Potter, anyway, because they feel entitled to his life, so time is of the essence. Draco doesn’t have a unique and brilliant idea in interviewing Potter, much as the admission pains him.
The same thing happened with Ginny, the sudden and all encompassing conviction that Harry could spend his life like this. Only, Ginny never fit quite as neatly into the house Harry’s mind so kindly provided, evidence of a childhood focused too intensely on getting out and away to this ideal house he build for himself. Harry never quite expected to get there, of course, as is the habit with most escapist fantasies, but then it became a viable possibility and, well, Malfoy fits right in.
“Yes, Potter, you were right all along and it’s so cold that my fingers are frozen off, could I please get back into my warm bed now?” If Malfoy weren’t so annoyingly persistent, Harry might be tempted to muse a bit longer, to make Malfoy stand in wait while he decides, but in the end that would only torture them both. Other times Harry might be willing to sacrifice his own comfort to see Malfoy squirm, but this is not one of them.
, of clenching his hands or tapping his feet or biting his lips. It drove his father crazy, how abysmal of a liar Draco is.
“Animals?” Hermione asks sharply, the question directed at Ron and Harry. They might have neglected to tell her about that tiny detail. Three ferrets and one badger — it just didn’t seem
It doesn’t taste great, and Draco can see how salt and pepper might make it better, but he doesn’t allow that concession on his face. Instead he swallows and smiles, because that is what you do when you get free food, you don’t go through all the trouble of getting lemon juice to make the cook doubt their culinary skills. To his credit, Harry does look properly apologetic.
Being spit out of someone’s mind is never pleasant, no matter how much time you had to prepare for the jump. Draco had no time at all, resting his lips on Potter’s forehead and praying that his love may be true enough, and then he was catapulted here, laying half on top of Potter and seeing absolutely nothing.
careful, Draco knocks against her wing. It feels daft even as he is doing it, knocking on her wing like it’s a door, but he doesn’t know how else to respectfully get Weasley’s attention. He could have shouted, started out on an aggressive note and set them both against him even more. No, making a fool out of himself is the better solution, much as it pains him to say. It’s not like he didn’t look like a fool already.
All told, Draco is pretty sure he is dead. He will either be burned or, if he miraculously manages to evade the flame, the dragon is going to eat him raw, snatch him off the ground and away from his glinting hope like it’s nothing.
“What, worried about your virtue?” Harry mainly asks as a joke, hopes perhaps that it will shake Malfoy out of his stupor, but Malfoy flinches and Harry suddenly feels sick.
“You should talk to Malfoy.” Ron shuts Harry’s protest down before he can fully articulate his problem. It’s not that he doesn’t
Draco could have drawn out gruesome deaths, could have very calmly explained that he has both the skill and the money to make Granger disappear without anyone saying a word about it, but that wouldn’t have impressed her. They all lived through the war, they are too familiar with blood and gore to make it an effective threat. If you keep things too vague, however, no one will believe that you are serious or have the knowledge to back up what you’ve promised.
“It’s called the weasel war dance, there is absolutely nothing to fear.” Pansy is exasperated, the way she always is when Draco doesn’t agree with her on the brilliancy of animals, and she shoves an elbow into his side when all he answers with is a vaguely understanding hum. “Why do you even own ferrets when you are so resistant to learning how to care for them?”
Granger laughs—which isn’t reassuring—and then Weasley screams and the warm atmosphere of music and fun vanishes, ripped away and leaving nothing but cold confusion, Weasley standing alone where he danced with Potter.
He doesn’t know what there is to explain — the couch is obviously a health and safety hazard and the fact that Draco tolerated it in his house for this long would make his father nauseous; it has to go. They went over this when Draco first wanted to wash his hands of it and they went over it when the mood took Harry, lazing on the abominable thing, which he did an improbable amount of time in an effort to prove it vital. It seems now they are discussing it again, and Draco is determined to not postpone it
the one who told her. Her scarily perceptive judgement is not something he wants to deal with, not when the world is already crashing down around him. Sure, Ginny insists that she is trying to help him and Harry is sure she thinks she does the right thing, but people prodding and pushing him into one direction usually ends in him running at high speed in the opposite one. So Harry doesn’t tell Ginny, because he might be as over their failed relationship as possible, but his brain is still wired to at best ignore anything she might have to say. Neither of them needs that, really.
in the endless possibilities of magic, two men cannot have children, wizards or not. But then, why was Malfoy allowed to marry him at all, if there can be no heir? Or is Harry supposed to graciously smile and pretend nothing is the matter as Malfoy takes a lover to sire a little army of blond children to run around here, raise them as his own and to uphold the family name in grace and dignity? Well, it
Time had not changed him much; it gave him a grace only time can. His hair was thinning perhaps, and turned silver like his father's, but it was cut long past his shoulders. It was worn in Harry's favourite style: back in a ponytail with two equal strands free to roam his angelic face. His back was still straight from all of the posture lessons he was subjected to and his body had little wrinkles. In fact the only real wrinkles he had was laugh lines and ones from furrowing his eyebrows in his early years. He pretty much looked only about 103. His vision and other senses had not diminished due to magic; ironically, Harry's was a sharp as a fine tuned predator before he died at age 156. (He beat Merlin by nearly a year.) However, Draco was still here at 157 and so was all of his friends; some even pushing 160 and others as young as 89.
"Then, what are you doing?" He seemed sort of surprised that I believed him so readily. He looked up at me and then around, casting yet another privacy spell I assumed.
"Could you pass me the Daily Prophet please, Neville?" Neville barely picked it up before Seamus stood as spoke to Harry.
"Well, go ahead, you know it better than me. I'll just be another one of your hulking bodyguards on the lookout," When he didn't laugh at my attempt to lighten the mood, I gestured for him to step forward even though I didn't know if he needed to cast if from a certain distance or not.
The smirk from before came back. "I'm a Slytherin," he said, taking my words and rephrasing them to suit his situation. "When do I ever tell the
"No, we are real. Everyone you see here is real. Just, say, I picture us a bit older; you would look older to me but I still look this way to you. It's complicated." He sighed.
When I wake up, I'm completely clothed and he's gone. And so is the List. At first, I worry that it didn't work and he just took off with it but that's stupid. I mean, it had to work.
It’s horrifying and scary and hurts, but it’s just one of the truths Draco will have to learn to live with. There are far too many of those, things he discovered in their marriage that didn’t really matter until it all broke apart (until
Somewhere in his lecture, Potter pushed himself into standing, looming over Draco and blocking out the light. He is glaring down at Draco, intent on scaring him into looking away from his problems.
“Yes. Next hand.” Potter gives him his other hand and that is that. They are back to silent closeness.
is usually safe. Come to think of it, all Harry’s friends are rather fantastic when angry, and he would love to watch them from a safe distance away.
“What do you want?” Weasley shouts from inside, not bothering to come out and face Draco, setting an aggressive tone. Draco supposes that is alright for
It is not Pansy who stands in the doorway, looking extremely unimpressed with both Draco's crisis and the mix-up. Draco should have recognised it at the voice; it didn't sound anything like Pansy.
If it weren’t for knowing look she shoots him, brief as it might have been, Draco could have convinced himself Pansy didn’t catch a glimpse of his pathetically fawning heart.
It was a bit of a shock to find out that his body could easily supply Potter with all the right reactions, while also making Draco feel sick at the performance, close to a betrayal really, but Draco adjusted. It’s a good thing, surely, because Draco isn’t keen on explaining to Potter how he is broken, must be, and he is confident that soon he’ll be able to bear Potter’s touch without feeling soiled, disgusted by his own skin.
to help! The only question that remain is how to convince Potter of that. Potter would never accept an outright recommendation, proud fool, but Draco isn’t a Slytherin for nothing. Draco can be sneaky when the situation calls for it. He’ll smuggle some nice things into Potter’s bath and before he even notices Draco exchanged his products, he’ll already recognise the benefits for himself. And Draco gets smoother skin to cuddle against. Everyone wins.
Draco makes a concentrated effort not to rip the clothes off Potter, to be as careful and gentle as possible as he frees his erection from the fabric, slides it past his hips and down his straining thighs.
“Shall we move this to the bedroom, then? No more kissing though, I’ll have to insist on that,” Draco says and smiles, ignoring everything in him screaming to call Blaise (because he is not a child, he is a grown and married man and he does
“I am fully capable of using the Floo system, Weasley, it might confuse you, but trust me that I am exactly where I set out to be.” Not where he
The people do not react well to that. Sure, there is a general concession that yes, it’s not what you’d call
into bullying Potter until he leaves?” Yes, that’s admiration in her voice, plain as day if you listen close enough, and Draco preens under her approval.
“Don’t be silly Harry, I assume you can find your own way to a Quidditch game; especially if it’s to see your precious
(Then again, it’s not like you can measure love by the clothes you wear. It’s about how much effort you are willing to do—which, yes, fine,
Of course, all his carefully concealed efforts paled next to Potter's proudly worn efforts. The man brushed his hair, for Salazar’s sake! There are no stains or wrinkles on him, the unfortunate orange goes unfairly well with his brown skin, and the sheer excitement he fell into once they reached the pitch would rival that of a spoilt child on their birthday. And Draco would know, he’s very spoilt and celebrated plenty of birthdays.
, popping up in Draco’s thoughts, never far away, but Draco will not let himself be dragged down once more), but he doesn’t see the appeal in knowing the outcome before things have even started. And, they must know the outcome, surely? Pansy is going to take her revenge in increasingly creative ways, and Blaise is going to regret his foolishness for a few hours, and then he will have all but forgotten about the consequences of testing Pansy.
that you get a room and spare me.” Weasley—who is only still here because this is Potter’s mind, not Draco’s—doesn’t sound as disgruntled as he claims to be. Draco would hazard a guess that he is actually pretty fond and charmed by Potter, a suspicion that would be easy enough to verify if Draco could bring himself to look away from Potter and check.
“Alright, let’s get you out of here.” Harry doesn't protest as Ron starts walking, slowly and carefully, pulling Harry with him. He wants to leave — there is no reason to stay now that Draco is gone.
Draco frowns at him, determined to say something now, before Potter shows up, when the howling starts. He will need to postpone that talk,
like it’s a proper name—they almost forgot about the game. Considering who they are here to see, Draco almost wishes he hadn’t reminded them. Well, at least Potter looks better in orange than Weasley does (though Draco is still very embarrassed to be seen with someone so enthusiastically rooting for the losing team).
?” There is more Harry means to say, about arrogance and priorities and insults, but he can’t wrap his thoughts around the words.
“Hermione is the love of my life, but she doesn’t feel the same way. So if all I can get is her friendship, I’ll treasure that and won’t push for more,” Ron says with conviction, sweeping the sadness away as if it’s nothing. He has gotten good at that, pretending and setting his own feelings back.
“They have basically been married since we all were eleven and you know it; that is close enough to count.” Draco has no patience for Millicent right now, not when he is looking to make Pansy the object of their communal curiosity.
“That’s enough!” Draco loudly interrupts him, causing a minor scene with several heads turned towards their table in various levels of subtly. “No one is courting anyone.”
No one watches the movie. Even Dean and Seamus stopped their gross affections to study him. Just great. Harry needs less nosey friends.
“Excuse me?” Draco has collected himself enough to pick the magazine off from the ground, smoothing out the wrinkles he must have caused by gripping too hard before letting go of it, glaring at Harry as thought it was
into my house?” Malfoy visibly tries to remain calm and keep his composure, but that is quite useless now after the little scene Harry was regrettably too preoccupied to enjoy because of these ridiculous pyjamas Malfoy thought appropriate —
sleep. And you won’t be waking me tomorrow at some barely even real hour of the morning, understood?” Harry sits up, searching in the room for Malfoy (which is of course useless, but since he is already up he might as well), hoping to see him nod and slink back out again.
How did Harry miss this? Trust, it’s so important, such a basic thing defining every relationship, either in its bounds or its absence, and yet they never stop to think about it. Harry’s whole life works on trust, the only reason he even still
knows the Harpies will win, even those covered in orange and shouting obscenities—and in the secure knowledge of a bet smugly won, he has all the time in the world to watch Potter watch his precious team lose. Which is almost as good as Potter watching him back.
It’s too late for any more excuses, however, and Draco will simply have to face his fate. The stakes are raised higher than they were before, due to Draco’s ridiculous urge to please, and Harry’s memory of what Blaise cooked for them the only tangible expectation he has in regards of Draco’s abilities. Harry will be more disappointed than he would have been otherwise, expecting Blaise’s feast and being settled with whatever Draco doesn't burn.
should have tried to reassure Malfoy that he doesn’t have to leave, that he is the kind of pretentious bastards who has a bed big enough for half an army and they could easily share without doing so much as breathe the same air, but, well, too late for regrets. Besides, it’s not his fault Malfoy decided to be weird about this. They could have shared this bed, strictly platonic like people who might, in the muddy darkness, be called
“I have to do what now?” Draco sounds like an imbecile, asking question over question, but he doesn’t have the faintest idea what Potter wants from him and he’ll take all the help he can get. “More importantly, why am I even tied and interrogated in the first place? Am I not meant to be be the dashing hero?”
, Potter, they want to be. It wasn’t easy for me, still isn’t and likely never will be, but you are their hero. You are right, I have no idea what that means for you, but they love
Draco pushes the first drawer in, surprised at how heavy it is. Then he moves to push the second one in, too, and finds that he can’t. He just … can’t. There is some sort of stopper, something jammed and—oh, the bowls are too high. Draco can see it now, one of the bowls wedged between the roof of the dishwasher and the bottom of the drawer, stuck unless enormous force is used.
“Fine, if that’s how you choose to remember it.” Draco sniffs and takes up his tea again, splutters as he remembers too late that it’s long cold. Potter laughs at him, an exhausted chuckle, and Draco smiles as he makes them more tea.
could use them to his advantage, Draco would be able to do things far beyond his most ambitious dreams within the fickle conditions they set. Maybe Draco should leave it like that, excuse himself and start plotting his revenge — his eyes land on the appetisers wilting in the middle of the table and Draco knows he can’t do it. There is more waiting where that came from, undiscovered depth of horror, and Draco isn’t willing to gamble with his life like this.
“Careful now, or I’ll loose the foot,” Draco says, smiling through that very real concern. “You could never live with the guilt.”
“You are aware you can levitate plates, yes? It’s a fairly simple charm; I’m sure I still have some old schoolbooks, if you would like to revise the lesson from first year.” Draco smiles, his charming, only
, the smug prick who sneers at Harry’s friends and made his life miserable since the first day they met.
Harry doesn’t bother with subtlety this time, snapping their attention back to what they are supposed to do with a rushed flick of his wand. Next time they might as well stay in the wizarding world, if they can’t have an uninterrupted talk anyway.
and distressingly tedious. Draco should ask Theo, he has the uncanny ability to ignite interest and enthusiasm for virtually everything. He would help Draco cut a good figure at the funeral without appearing too prepared. Or his father perhaps, he attended more than one funeral he might or might not have helped bring about.
“Longer than me, go make tea.” Draco pushes at his shoulder (ineffective, since he is still draped all over Harry) and Harry heaves a sigh and amends: he could watch Draco for hours, provided he doesn't talk. Draco gets demanding when he talks, and Harry doesn't feel like getting up to make tea.
sure and he doesn’t want to mess this up when he is barely back inside. It’s remarkable what panic can make you do: Draco pulls himself up on nothing but the door—a feat previously judged impossible even if the alternative would have been a blemished face—and suddenly stands on his feet again, brain still on the floor as he mutters about having forgotten the tea but being willing to fetch—it’s a train wreck, very painful to watch and horrifying to listen to the words falling out of his mouth, but it makes Potter laugh and then he is there, shushing Draco with a finger on his lips and Draco doesn’t know why everyone is doing that today, but he isn’t about to complain.
He doesn’t have to know that Blaise consoled him through a teary heartbreak, so Draco tells him pistachio is Blaise’s favourite, that he can never find it anywhere, and that Draco had no other reason whatsoever to bring Blaise ice cream from their definitely-a-date. Not a very convincing lie, no, but Potter bought it, smiling at Draco and charmed by how much Draco cares about his friends.
His head is hanging low, like he doesn’t have the energy to hold it up, hair falling over his expression in a greasy tangle. It needs washing, desperately so. Draco could have sworn that wasn’t a problem back in the forest, when Potter wore a dress and had his hair bound into a braid, ruffled by the exertion of his fight but much better cared for than they are now. Where Potter looked almost like himself in the forest—fighting, not backing down for anything (except when he did, when Draco was there and he stepped back to let Draco take care of the wolves)—he doesn’t look himself now, defeated and discouraged.
to Draco would shift the balance onto their side, which would be sure to make Draco feel like a cornered animal, more so than he already does.
It was only a question of time until Harry realised all the things Draco didn’t say, and, having seen how he reacted to the few truths Draco admitted to, he didn’t want to stay and watch that. At least this way, Draco can pretend that leaving was his own choice, can preserve the shaky remnants of his dignity. He walked out of that house upright, with his head held high and the certainty that Harry didn’t go unscathed either.
“Right.” Potter nods, like he might finally see reason and name the poor thing something permanent. “See, that is one more reason
“To sum this up,” Blaise interrupts Draco’s very eloquent and very sad monologue on why there simply
Instead he focuses on the touches that actually were, the pushing and shoving and jostling, the glares impressive enough to rival literal knives. That one extraordinary time Potter took Draco’s hand to save him.
“Does anyone have any ideas for how to get him down from there?” Draco mainly asks Granger but he doesn’t want to obviously cut Weasley out, lest it encourages him to answer out of spite.
“What hair? I never had any.” Potter frowns at him, scratches at his—bald, so bald—head and Draco gapes in horror.
He decides against informing Harry of his plan. He is unlikely to say no — he does love playing host — but Draco deems it best not to give him the chance in the first place. Besides, he is engrossed in sketching his own plans on how the living room ought to look, and Draco might not be able to see them properly from where he is sitting, but the likelihood of his ideas being in any way acceptable is rather low. That is more important than discussing exactly how many people will watch the movies. (Or just one movie perhaps? How long are these things anyway?)
, either, gazing up at Potter passed out in the armchair. He looks poured into it, boneless and in a state of relaxation people have to meditate hours to reach. His hair is a mess and his lips are swollen from teeth, trying to quieten sounds. Draco thinks about kissing him, about tasting Potter and soothing his abused lips. He would be good to Potter, he thinks, as good to Potter’s mouth as he was to his cock.
Dare Draco hope for a monster to fight? It sounds too easy, that he should just grab Potter and swing out of the window, but finally a monster for him to heroically slay doesn’t seem likely either.
“They can do this for hours.” Granger is resigned to her fate, not taking her eyes of them, perfectly blasé and composed.
“I’m up, totally awake, don’t drown me.” Draco even sits up, the ground far less comfortable now that he is leaning towards awake.
“You have put a lot of work into this friendship with Potter: you brought him flowers and tea and entered his shop with a smile. You tried to gently push him towards talking to his friends and even
“Can we stay here, Potter?” Draco asks, blurting out thoughts recklessly as Potter settles a hand into his hair, cards his fingers through it.
Draco can admit it’s scary. Weasley fought a war, same as all of them, and evidently his time following Potter taught him different skills than Draco learnt trying to survive in what used to be his home. Weasley doesn’t need to say the words for Draco to be absolutely sure that he would
“You couldn’t get rid of me if you wanted, this was your one and only chance,” Draco whispers back, wrapping his arms around Harry, wrapping them tighter and squeezing.
—that’s next in line to serve as entertainment. He did what he had to to preserve his parents from a painful death, closing his eyes to the mental decay already then baring its rotten teeth. Draco did as he was told, even though he didn’t like it, even though it made him violently sick and shaky, steadily grinding self-loathing turning into ashes what he sought to protect.
That’s just grand, exactly what Harry needed, a sudden emotional break-down right neatly presented for Malfoy’s merciless eyes. Fantastic.
That is … he would rather avoid that. Hermione confirmed that it would be needed to close the contract, that in fact they would have go so far as to
doing things. It’s what he did all his life, looking to his parents for orders of what to avoid. Don’t slump in your chair, don’t slur your speech, don’t spend all your time with friends and neglect your schoolwork. Draco knows how
“Yes?” Draco doesn’t like the way his answer sounds like a question—it’s a sign of feeble character, his father would say—but Weasley just nods.
He needs to tell Ron. There is no way around it. Harry needs to look Ron in the eyes and see the judgement there, face the consequences of his actions.
“Nonsense, I’ll just be a minute!” Harry is out of that room before he can do anything rash. Parkinson is
They sit there, gathered around Potter’s sickbed and hoping to love him back into health. If Draco hadn’t talked to Potter as much as he did, he would think them ridiculous, delusional, to think this is something that could help. Love as a cure, preposterous!
Harry shouts and pulls Draco closer, Darlington squeaks and hopefully takes cover somewhere, and the spell flies high through the air, blasting a hole into the ceiling. Draco hopes Grimmauld can forgive him for the damage.
Granger is human at least—Draco is pretty sure he is, too—and whatever Weasley is, he sounds like he is enjoying himself. Granger is wearing a costume almost the same as Potter’s (which suggest horrifying things about Draco’s own clothes), looking out through the face of a pale teenager, half hidden behind black hair and seemingly content with that. She is Not Amused and Draco is impressed with how well she expresses that, even in a body that isn’t her own and is unfamiliar in how it moves.
The hospital, where Potter lies in a bed exactly like this, sleeping, trapped in his own mind and waiting for someone to come and rescue him.
Draco doesn’t point out that Pansy is helplessly falling for Granger. Instead he spares her the prodding questions this would evoke and talks about his own problems, because he is a good friend like that.
“That is the only thing you wish to protest, then?” Pansy asks, wicked delight shining in her eyes, a predator ready to pounce.
“Much as I enjoy catching you Potter, you should shorten the dress.” Draco carefully steps a bit closer again, trying for normality as he sweeps them back into the rhythm, leading Potter and certainly not looking at his lips.
“Are we not, Harry?” Draco does his best for a charming grin, adrenaline from his near fall and Potter’s proximity coursing through him, breath coming fast and hard.
“Are you painting my nails green, Malfoy?” Potter asks, once Draco is done with his first hand. Which is a bit late for protest, so Draco shrugs.
flower language and thus not something to quickly google, sadly—and crafted a bouquet as tasteful as it’s sincere. Over that and retrieving his alibi ring, Harry completely forgot the time and was forced to show up to his own fake wedding in a ratty shirt and jeans with more once-artful holes than fabric. He’d have looked for something more ceremonial had he known Malfoy would be late, would have put more effort into looking the apart of loving groom.)
surprising, doesn’t say anything; he watches Harry, gaze steady while everything in Harry is in upheaval. Harry can’t stand it.
enjoying. He is also still pouting, though, so he doesn’t allow for that enjoyment to take visual form and turns his nose at Potter, lets him know there is more grovelling to be done before he has the pleasure of Draco’s smile again.
Harry seems to think so. It’s unfortunate for Harry, then, that Grimmauld has a fondness for making Draco happy, and that Draco has long since learnt how to exploit that fact.
Still a forest, still peaceful, still as non-threatening as it could possibly be. And Draco has no new leads because he pissed Weasley off.
“I want to, I desperately want to, okay?” Draco finally manages to pin Potter’s wrists down against the armchair, shouts the words in Potter’s angry grimace of a face.
who stuck his head into a plant that already contained one and really didn’t offer enough space for two.” Potter smirks, delight visible and his victory judged imminent.
He doesn’t want to do that. He doesn’t like failure, for one, but he also doesn’t want to lose Potter. He thought they shared something, something real even if it’s dressed up with monsters and swords. Draco thought they had something worth preserving, something that could exist outside of the paradises Potter built, and he doesn’t want to abandon that before they had a chance to try and make it work.
serve as effective shield against dark magic, if their half senile late headmaster is to be believed (a honour to be bestowed with caution, it cost many a trusting soul their life).
Malfoy would come back from his fancy dinner and find the living room splattered in blood. Harry would grin manically for effect, the ‘deranged convict escaped from Azkaban’ grin Sirius taught him proudly, and Malfoy would slowly back away and never dare show his face again. All further contact would be via owls that Harry would train to bite Malfoy as often as possible.
However, with the rituals out, there is nothing Harry can do to convince Grimmauld to accept him as the new Lord Black. Which would be fine, it’s not like Harry
Harry chances a glance up at Narcissa to get a gauge at how gruesome his death will be. That turns out to be a mistake.
“Come on, up you get.” Weasley nudges against his side, prodding him awake and dragging him out of that comfortably dimmed place where Draco could almost pretend Potter is here. “Don’t make me dunk cold water onto you.”
something, feeling things convention would have heavily disapproved of not too long ago. Draco did manage to taunt some of the Hogwarts portraits into murderous rage, shaking their fists at him but unable to do anything more threatening, trapped in frames as they were. (Draco never dared do the same at the Manor.)
“I don’t have to do anything in retaliation, Grimmauld is very loyal,” he says instead, which smoothly evades her question and gives her something new to think about.
He’s also moved as far away from Harry as possible without leaving the bed, as if he was contagious. Brilliant, just great.
“Unexpected, is that the best you can come up with?” How insulting. Not that Draco has any aspirations in that direction, but he should certainly hope that he would do better than
“I think there has been a misunderstanding here, something that could have been easily avoided if you would respect the boundaries of politeness and privacy or even bothered to ask a few essential questions before jumping to conclusions, Weasley.” Weasley practically
Granger, too, can’t quite believe that he’s said that and raises an eyebrow at him. Draco suddenly understands what Harry meant when he said that Granger had them all whipped, needing only a single expression to get them to do their homework or readjust their priorities in a fashion that seemed more fitting to Granger.
Things didn’t matter anymore, in that room with no time and nothing but echoes. Harry could just… exist, floating in the vast emptiness.
Artemis, she goes wherever she pleases. If she stays with you, then she does so of her own volition. My part is limited to the answering of your letters, which she watches over with careful eyes.
“What?” Draco is pretty sure he heard correctly—he has exceptional hearing, thank you very much—but what Potter said doesn’t make any sense.
