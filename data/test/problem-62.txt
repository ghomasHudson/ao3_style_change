Teddy and Harry had been pretty busy ever since. However, Harry kept on calling Draco through the two-way mirror almost every day.
But Draco wasn’t listening. The tears were burning his eyes and Draco never cried! It wasn’t up to the Malfoy Heir standard at all!
… I’d rather had so many scars from being on adventures and fighting magical creatures as they wrote on those fantasy novels… But it was just my family… My perfectly dysfunctional and loving family…” he said bitterly.
Draco cast a drying charm on himself before getting out. Harry was waiting on the other side of the door.
“Are you now?” Draco teased and the ghost of a smile appeared in Harry’s face before fading away again.
He had wanted to be a healer since he was a kid, but his father had always been against it. The Malfoy Heir would never lesser himself so much as to do a job of helping people! Merlin forbids, the Malfoy Heir was rich enough not to ever need a job and it was primordial that people knew about it! Draco gave up on his dream when he was around 8. But then, his father went to Azkaban and Teddy, somehow knew what Draco’s childhood dream was as he offered him a large range of books on healing spells for his 12th birthday. Despite his best effort, Draco didn’t manage to keep those books from his mother’s inquisition, but surprisingly, the woman seemed okay with the idea.
Teddy was back and sitting at the Hufflepuff table. Draco was only half listening while the headmaster was explaining that a special psychological support unit had been created in the Hospital Wing for students that might need it. He was watching at his friend from a distance. Clearly, Teddy wasn’t listening to any of what was going on. He had his nose on some old book, reading while everyone was mourning and keeping a minute of silence in the memory of Diggory. And that act of insensitiveness was so unlike him that Draco’s heart ached.
He hadn’t expected Harry to jolt up and to march through the Hall, determination beaming into his watery emerald eyes. Draco stood up, uncertain. If Harry wanted to talk, he would be ready to follow him. But Harry didn’t want to talk. He didn’t even say a word before kissing him deeply, as he only ever did in private, but this time the whole Hall was there to see.
Draco would never admit it aloud, but he was afraid. Afraid of what Potter could say about him. Afraid about what Black could say about him or his mother! Let alone his father… What if spending two whole months with those two changed the way Teddy was looking at him?? What if Teddy didn’t want to be his friend anymore after that???
It was Draco’s turn to freeze and without realising it, he had grabbed Potter’s wrist, preventing him to step further away.
Teddy looked at them both, staying a bit longer on Draco, waiting for him to deny it – which he didn’t do.
Apparently, Harry hadn’t even talked to Teddy yet because the Hufflepuff acted as if nothing happened during lunch. And it had already been three days!
Sorry about the delay. I hadn't been working much on this fic those past few weeks so I didn't feel like uploading a new chapter... I'm sorry!
He called through the two-way mirror every other day and talked to him as if they were still spending their days together. He also came to the Malfoy Manor regularly during the second half of the summer. Once, Draco and his mother had been invited to Lord Black’s residence. And everything went great! Draco’s mother came to peace with her older sister and her younger cousin. Potter had been decent. And Draco had met a new cousin and enjoyed the show while Dora and Teddy competed to know who the better metamorphmagus was.
Black had listened and said nothing for a long time. It was just as Draco started wondering if he should just go that the man spoke.
“Well, if it’s what you need to overcome your best Harry, I won’t oppose it…” Johnson said after a long time. “Please, tell Flint too. I don’t want him to curse my seeker if he caught him in a similar situation… And next time, come after we finish. You can train with Harry, but I won’t let you snitch our chasers’ tactics to your House…”
“Why? We would just play some Quidditch! What are you afraid of? It’s not as if I’m going to jump on you…”
Harry snorted loudly and Draco smiled tenderly before putting a soft kiss on his wet lips. Harry closed his eyes and let him do but stopped him when he tried to deepen their exchange.
Draco kept smiling and read the letter for the third time. Harry was Gryffindor Prefect, not Weasley… Which meant that Teddy’s prediction had been wrong!
Sorry for neglecting this fic... to be honest, I stuck with chapter 15 so I hesitated whereas I should wait to manage to write more before releasing this chapter or not...
“There’re other ways to warm up to each other,” Draco shrugged. “Maybe you could just, take it slow with Davis and see at what point you started feeling uncomfortable…”
He smiled and Harry smirked back sitting back next to him and resting his head against his shoulder before taking out a book on psychology.
It has been around a week ago and now; Draco and Teddy were doing their Prefect round together. Harry had joined them because Weasley and Granger had been fighting, again… Draco couldn’t see in what impossible future the two of them would end up marrying each other… but Teddy seemed convinced that it would happen, sooner or later.
“Yeah… I’ll tell you more later… Anyway, just so you know if I don’t catch you before you go to the Great Hall tomorrow morning… there’ll probably be a rumour about Blaise and me sleeping together… For the record, it was last year, before we were together!” he said quickly.
seems like a pretty good goal – except the wrongly imprisoned part for 10 years, of course… And it’s true. I don’t say that I would never work… just… well, I don’t
The place was almost deserted. Only a few upper years were still up, reading, studying, or quietly talking in a corner. Theo and Pansy were there too, probably finishing one their essay issued this week.
“No, for waiting for Teddy’s blessings…” Harry sighed. “Apparently, Remus had pulled a similar plot when they started going out back in their 6th year… He wanted to talk with my father and Pettigrew before they took it anywhere…”
Black barked a laugh at that. “Rem’… I think they’re still drunk. We surely can’t let them go like that! Can’t I just give them some sober-up potion?”
Harry looked at him and seemed sad for some reason. Had he found someone else during those two weeks? Did he want to break up? Did they grow apart so easily??? Was it Weasley?!
“Well… you see… we trained together last year and… well, we thought we could keep it up this year. And, no offence Angelina, your training is great, but I’m a Seeker, I’ll do better if I train with competition…”
Draco’s other hand was on Harry’s tight and he moaned softly into Draco’s mouth and Draco thought that there was no way they could stop there…
“Hello, Draco! What are you doing with Potter? Where’s Wolfe?” Pansy’s voice asked suddenly, and Draco immediately let go of Harry’s hand.
He grabbed his school robe and went to one of the booths to change. He was out less than a minute later. Draco tried to imitate Teddy’s puppy look to stop him from leaving but he only got a pitying smile in return.
By Draco’s 4th year at Hogwarts, the boy couldn’t see his life without Teddy by his side anymore. Sure, most of his fellow Slytherins had accepted him back in since his 1st year. But knowing what real friendship looked like through his relationship with Teddy put every other one in perspective.
“Teddy! Wait! It’s not what I meant!” Harry tried to stop him, but Draco grabbed his wrist before he could run after his brother.
And they went back at snogging. It was better but that discussion had triggered a weird feeling in Draco’s stomach. Why was he feeling so vulnerable right now? Harry’s hand was on his hair, and he usually hated it when people touched his hair… But now, it felt good. He let go of Harry’s mouth and move back to his neck, seeking the feeling he had felt a few weeks ago in Grimmauld Place. Harry kissed his ear and brushed his abdomen through his shirt. His hand ended up on Draco’s tight and the Slytherin exhaled deeply. Harry’s other hand levelled his chin, and they were back at exploring each other mouths.
The next morning, Teddy seemed not to be remembering much of his evening. Draco told them that Davis was a homophobic bitch and they decided not to talk about all that anymore. This incident seemed to have calmed down Teddy’s quest of looking for the girl of his dreams. Their O.W.L.s exams were only two months away after all, so they had better things to do.
“No,” Lupin said. “They’ll learn the consequences of their actions and suffer their hangover until the Sorting Feast tonight. Period. Now, off you go before I decide I’m being too soft on you!”
“Well, I certainly don’t see him naked as often as you do, but he does spend some time at my house every now and then…”
“It’s rude to keep an old woman waiting…” Narcissa said evenly when she understood that he was very purposefully taking his time.
“You’re insufferable!” Harry pouted. “Anyway, Remus said that my dad had always been supportive of them and that, when they told him, he was just happy to know that they would just never do it on
When Harry told Draco to meet him in the Quidditch Pitch after Gryffindor team’s training session, he clearly hadn’t expected his boyfriend to make an entrance at the end of his captain’s wand.
“First, we knew each other. And we’ve had a kind of a long-distance relationship for almost two months between the first and second times we kissed each other,” Draco added.
Draco stayed quiet. Harry was ashamed of him. That’s what it was. He should have known it… He was indeed the son of a Death Eater… No matter what his mother did to save their image, he will always be a pariah in their society.
Draco eyed Teddy, to see how his friend was reacting. It was the first time the three of them had really spend time together since Teddy learnt about Harry’s and Draco’s building relationship.
Draco and Teddy had spent some time together during those two weeks which hadn’t really happened since the end of the previous year. Draco wouldn’t admit it, but he hadn’t noticed how much he had missed that until now. Sure, Harry had been a good distraction and snogging had its perks, but it wasn’t the same as talking with your best friend for hours.
“What’s wrong with me?!!!” Davis repeated angrily. “What’s wrong with him?!! He’s the one who started it! He’s the one who believed I’m not good enough for him! Like I’m some kind of prude or something…”
“We’re going out… since this summer…” he admitted in a low voice so no one else heard. “Harry wants to keep it quiet… Same-sex relationships aren’t that well accepted in the muggle world and… well, he wants to keep a low profile…”
A few days later, Harry called again at night to tell him that Teddy had a break down the previous night but that he was doing a bit better now. Apparently, Remus, Sirius and Harry were now taking turns to be sure someone was always there to keep Teddy company while he was researching who knew what. It was a good idea, albeit a bit boring in Harry’s point of view.
Teddy raised an eyebrow and suddenly, a girl version of their best friend was with them in the compartment. She was pretty but also had really big boobs.
Once again, Draco had been nervous. Thankfully, Black had been alone. He didn’t know what he would have done his Lupin has been there too. They talked and Draco told Black what Harry had told him about his nightmares. He told him that Harry had agreed to see a mind-healer if they could stay together for the sessions. Of course, Draco also told him that Harry just had to say a word and he would leave the room without any discussion either. He just wanted to help.
And since then, she had been supportive if not realistic regarding his opportunities in this field at this young age.
He looked up and Draco noticed that he had stopped crying even if his face was still puffy. They kissed but it wasn’t as eager or needy as two weeks before. It was just soft and reassuring.
“You don’t have to justify yourself, Draco…” Harry sighed. “It’s ok, I trust you. I need to go; Teddy just made the room provide tequila…”
“Because, your punishment is, that you will have to listen and not question and accept that you can’t do anything about it, okay?”
“What?! Wait, Sirius! It’s only 11 a.m.!” Lupin protested but a trail of the finest flutes had already appeared on the coffee table. “They can’t drink, they’re underage!!” the wolf protested them after counting the number of glasses on the tray.
“He doesn’t have to say it! I know! He never touches me! As if I’m going to break! I’m not made of glass for God’s sake! We’re 16! Who cares if it’s my first time?! I don’t understand why he put so much importance in this! It’s not as if I’m asking him to marry me! It’s just sex! The whole school knows that he would just do it with anyone so why not me?!”
Draco stared at the raven-haired boy. They hadn’t been that far yet. Was he really suggesting what he thought he was suggesting?
“What would you say about coming over tomorrow to play some Quidditch?” Draco found the courage to ask eventually.
family. But so relieving. The mind-healer didn’t judge. Didn’t even talk about what his father was. What was on his vein. It was great and after some time, he started seeing changes in Harry too.
“You came to me; didn’t you know that I play both sides?” Blaise asked with disdain. “Because, for the records, Draco is a far better fuck that you’ll ever be.”
Harry nodded slowly, resting his head against Draco’s shoulder. “Will you… will you agree to come with me if… if I decided to go see one?”
“In a secret room up on the 7th floor. It’s called the Room of Requirement… Teddy got us here… I don’t know how he knows about it. It’s not even on the Map…”
“Teddy, we…” Draco started then turned to Harry. “Do you think we could take him to one of our Common Room?”
At least, Teddy was no longer burying himself in his endless studies about changing the world and he seemed truly happy, so Draco was happy too. Even if those girls would never be good enough for him. Draco agreed with Harry when he mentioned Granger’s crush on Teddy… The two would be good together. But it wasn’t his business and if Teddy didn’t see the girl like that… well, too bad for her.
Draco smirked and kneeled before him. Harry hadn’t noticed, of course. Draco let his hands gently stroke Harry’s tights. Harry opened his emerald eyes to his and accepted the unexpected kiss.
It wasn’t a problem though. Draco woke up a few times to Harry soft humming as the boy was sketching something on an old notebook. It gave him some ideas for his Christmas present, and he was in desperately needs for some. Thankfully, Diagon Alley had all the magical drawing supplies one could dream of.
“Hum… not that I know of… But how would I know? I was a Prefect too, and so were my sisters and Regulus, my baby cousin.”
“Well… we would have invited you, but it wasn’t really a planned thing and Remus specifically said ‘no boyfriend’…”
Draco decided to try and put all that in the back of his mind. He was home and he hadn’t seen his mother since last August as he had stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter.
boyfriend jealous, you failed to mention it was because you were a despicable homophobic bitch… You disgust me…”
“Draco knows that, once he will be done experimenting, I’ll be waiting for him…” she said, matter-of-factly, putting an overly manicured hand on Draco’s tight.
His mother had become quite busy since his father went to Azkaban. She was sitting as Lord Malfoy’s proxy in the Wizengamot until Draco was of age and had started to give special Wizarding Culture lessons to willing muggleborns and muggleraised students of Hogwarts during the summer.
The talk with his mother went without any incident. She wasn’t even surprised when he told her he was
At least, Teddy seemed happy too in the pictures. Still a bit tired and sun-deprived, of course, but better…
“It’s okay, it’s not real alcohol, it’s champagne!” Black told him while putting a soft kiss on his lips.
“What?! No! That’s not what I want!” Harry exclaimed. “I… We can still be friends and hang out together! Just… I don’t want to show public displays of affection while we’re… not around friends? I mean… I… It would make me uncomfortable anyway and… we can still find time to be just the two of us.”
Narcissa let him go and looked at him straight in the eyes. “So, mote it be. My son will be the Best Quidditch Captain Hogwarts has ever seen!”
Draco smirked as he grabbed Harry’s face. “If you think this will be enough for me to forgive you, you’re fooling yourself, Potter…” he whispered before kissing him back properly.
“Oh…” Draco said overdoing his disappointment. “Just as I was expecting to see how bad your self-control really was…”
“Are you implying that you’re having wet dreams about me?” Draco teased. It was so easy, and he didn’t regret it when the Gryffindor’s face turned bright red.
“Sirius! They’re only fifteen! Narcissa, say something!!” Lupin tried to engaged Draco’s mother who was already holding her own flute.
“And then,” Harry sighed and turned to show him the long scar on his back and side. “I was eight, Uncle Vernon forgot that he had asked me to wash the car and backed out without seeing me… He just probably didn’t see me…” Harry mumbled. “There had been other, but they have faded over time… my relatives just hate magic or me in general… can’t say…”
Something cold settled into Draco’s stomach at that statement. Well, of course, he had asked Pansy to keep it quiet and it was probably just a lie to cover it up. But it still hurt.
“Hum… I’m not sure it’s for me anyway but thanks for the support ‘Mione… It goes directly to my heart…” Harry sighed.
“What?! Wait!” Draco yelled after him. But Harry was already long gone and there was no way Draco loses that bet!
Teddy and Draco stopped the discussion they were having about the effect of Salamander Blood in healing salves to look at Harry. The three boys had just spent the day together shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and then had retreated to Malfoy Manor because Lord Black was still working on Grimmauld Place’s wards or something. Teddy and Harry were supposed to go back home by dinner time though…
“I don’t know… It’s not something I see myself doing in any near future. I’m very content with my current relationship after all…”
He left. Harry could deal with his teammates on his own. He did go to his own changing room and pondered to really change or not… After all, he could use a good flight before snogging his boyfriend!
“Meet me in front of the portrait of the gigantic silver fruit bowl, on the left-hand side of the Marble Staircase in ten then…” Harry said before grabbing his bag and joining Weasley and Granger, certainly to tell them that he wouldn’t eat with them.
Harry jolted a few meters away and Draco felt colder than he ever did in his entire life. He was ready to glare at the intruder but falter slightly when he noticed that it was none other than Lord Black himself, with a smug face on while leaning with cross arms against the open door.
“What about a Professional Quidditch Player?” Weasley suggested. “You’re so good, I’ve never seen someone fly like you! I’m sure any team would kill to have you!!!”
The kiss was… not like whatever Draco had ever experienced. He did try to kiss Pansy a few times and even Blaise once or twice… It had been casual, didn’t mean anything. But having P-Harry against his skin was just… another level? If that even made sense.
“Yes! Yes, I have! He took me to St Mungo’s and all. I’ve had to take Skele-gro and nutritive potions for two months after that! And I also have him promised that he won’t kill the Dursleys because he had just been out of Azkaban and Teddy couldn’t afford to lose him…”
Harry and Draco decided that they could meet around their respective Quidditch team training session. They had got used to getting up early to run the previous year, so they kept that upon three mornings a week. They didn’t have that many classes together as Draco hadn’t taken Divination and Harry wasn’t in Ancient Runes nor Arithmancy… but they still had Potion and Care of Magical Creatures together.
“Why don’t you go find Hermione if you’re that unhappy not to be in a relationship Ron?” Teddy asked pleasantly.
“Mistress is asking if Master Harry Potter will stay for dinner,” Dobby announced loudly making Harry jolted out of Draco’s arms.
Teddy’s strange behaviour had only one good side… Harry was no longer avoiding Draco. They started talking together about Teddy every night before going to sleep and Draco felt kind of bad for looking forward to those calls… Of course, he was worried! But he had his hypothesis. He was almost certain that Teddy had a vision of some kind and now he was trying to know if he could do something to avoid it from happening… Which was pretty mad, if anyone was asking. But clearly, Teddy didn’t want his friends’ help, so Draco was perfectly untitled to enjoy those little stolen times talking to his crush, right?
“Don’t worry, Draco,” Harry sighed. “Teddy made it very clear that he wouldn’t pursue the Black tradition of incestuous relationships…”
“Yeah… He told me that, one day, he caught his aunt – his godfather’s wife – cheating on him and that she was pregnant with her lover’s baby, but he’s never got the time to warn his godfather…”
Of course, the Weasley twins had teased Harry a bit when he went back to Gryffindor Tower in Slytherin robes, but even them admitted that green was looking good on him. Teddy asked Draco how the
Potter snorted. “Life is just so unfair…” he sighed. “How come him and you have skin as smooth as babies and people like me just have to fight against acne attacks every other morning?!”
Draco complied. He hadn’t hugged his mother in a few years. He wasn’t a child anymore but today felt different. He was proud too.
Harry nodded without looking at him. He was writing down Snape’s instructions for their next essay. Draco smirked and Harry sent him a side look.
Theo followed them and Draco was about to do the same, but Harry kept him behind by pulling his sleeve. Draco sent his a quizzingly look, but the raven-haired boy waited for the compartment door to close before speaking.
And that was how Draco ended up spending one hour every morning and three to four hours every weekend with Potter of all people. But it would have been a lie to say he hated it…
“No… Well, at first, she asked if there was something wrong with her and when I said no, she said it’s okay but… well, it’s been awkward between us ever since…”
“But Snape is still patrolling, he’s just outside your common room right now…” Harry sighed while looking at something on his lap.
’ because it made them feel better about themselves. But in the end, people would always try to connect with him for one and only thing: gaining something from it.
Draco only sipped the alcoholic beverage. He must admit that it was far better than the cheap firewhisky they used during their parties at school. And, as far as he was concerned, there was no way he would back Harry up on that claim.
“I think it’s bloody brilliant!” Ron jutted in before Hermione could say anything else about how important having class was. They made their way to the common room and Harry finally took stock of who all had come back. Ron, Hermione, and Neville, of course, Lavender, Seamus, and Dean, so most of Gryffindor, he didn’t see either of the Patil twins, though they might be somewhere else, no one told them they had to go back to their dorms. Draco, obviously, though he wasn’t in the common room, he saw Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson, as far as he knew, those were the only Syltherins who had returned. He supposed the rest had transferred to Durmstrung, as had most of Slytherin House, or forgone their eighth year altogether. Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones (of Hufflepuff) were talking to Sue Li (Ravenclaw). Ernie MacMillen and Justin Finch-Fletchley (both Hufflepuffs), were playing chess in the corner. He thought there had been more people yesterday, but he’d find out soon enough.
“I wanted to apologize, I haven’t seen you since, um, for saying we should hand you over to you-know-who, it was kinda bitchy of me, sorry.” Her face grew rather rosy as she said this.
“You didn’t have to.” They both looked as if that was the stupidest thing he had ever said, but they didn’t say anything else. The pair walked down to breakfast together, and Harry had to take a couple of breaths before walking through the doors. He tried his best to ignore the stares and whispers as they made their way to sit with the other Gryffindor eighth years. More than a few times, students came up asking for an autograph or a handshake, and Harry obliged, even though he didn’t feel like he should. He always thought of poor Colin Creevy whenever someone asked for an autograph, and he really wished he was thinking of anything else as he ate (though he barely ate). The others talked but he didn’t feel like talking.
Everyone  looked at him when he entered the common room, though they quickly looked away. Hermione stood up, but Harry flashed her one of the vials, muttered goodnight and walked back to his room. Draco was already in bed, the other beds curtains were shut and no light emanated from them. He downed one of the sleeping draughts and shoved the rest of the vials into his end table. He pulled the curtains shut and slept through the night for the first time in months.
He woke up to an empty room, Draco’s bed looked as if it had never been touched. He got dressed and took a deep breath before opening the door. He was greeted by Ron and Hermione.
“Don’t you have a class to get to?” He asked, having no idea what time it was or what her schedule looked like.
“Dreamless,” she paused, “Normally I wouldn’t give out this many but…” she trailed off, “Do come back if you have any more trouble, dear,” she smiled again, sincerely. Harry thanked her and walked back to the dorms, not bothering with the cloak this time, the feast had ended and no one was in the halls. He stuffed the vials into his robe, not wanting to be seen with them, not wanting to be so weak.
The others talked during the ride, but he was too busy staring out the window to pay any attention. He guessed Hermione was saying something about classes, and Neville said something about Professor Sprout, but he wasn’t sure what, exactly. Luna’s soft voice carried over to him, but he couldn’t quite make out what she said.
“No, it’s alright, he deserves his sleep,” Harry remembered his own sleepless night and for a moment, he envied the little boy. Andromeda led him to the familiar room, and left him alone with Teddy. He glanced at the empty portrait above the crib, which caused him to scrunch his nose for a minute. But then he turned his gaze to the baby, who was now donning dazzling bright blue hair now, and a faint smile.
“I wanted to get your opinion on the living arrangements for eighth years.” Harry just nodded. “As you know this past year has been rather difficult on all of us,” she paused, “But the war is over, we won, and it is our duty not to repeat the mistakes of our past. That is why, in support of school unity, I thought it best that you and Mr. Malfoy roomed together this year.” Bloody hell, he thought but didn’t say. “I understand if you do not want this, and I will make the necessary changes.” Harry stared at his shoes a minute longer before meeting her eyes.
They sat under the tree until lunch, they were joined by Neville at some point, and Ginny and Luna managed to find them after their first class was over. Harry only nodded or answered in very short sentences during lunch, the others didn’t press him for more, and for that, he was thankful. They spent the rest of the day in the common room. Harry played Ron in chess (even though he lost every round), Hermione started an Advanced Arithmancy textbook, a few people decorated for the party, and Neville and Seamus went off to see if they could find a new way to Hogsmead, or at least clear out the tunnel that used to be there. The party was to start after dinner, so until then, they just waited.
He jumped up and pulled his wand out in front of him, and, “Oh, sorry,” he mumbled, sitting back down.
“Tea, please.” He listened as Kreature walked to the kitchen, quickly cleaning up the mess he had made earlier with the snap of his fingers, before starting the kettle again. He missed the noise of The Burrow. But after he and Ginny agreed it’d be best to at least put a pause on their relationship, he felt like even more of a burden than before. He blamed himself for Fred’s death and it felt disrespectful to grieve with them, no matter what Mrs. Weasley said.
He made his way to the common room and found it wasn’t empty, though he was the only conscious one there. Ginny and Luna, having decided it too difficult to make it back to their dorms had crashed on the couch and armchair respectively. Someone had thrown a blanket over Ginny and Luna had to be curled up under at least five. Seamus had been unable to make it back to bed, although he was less fortunate than Ginny and Luna, he was sprawled on the floor, without a blanket. Justin was asleep on the window seat, his face pressed against the glass. And it looked like Anthony Goldstein had attempted to play chess at one point, seeing as he was sleeping on the board.
He planned on living at 12 Grimmauld Place, but there were too many memories, too many ghosts. So he got himself a tiny flat in London, someplace he could call his own, without worrying about those who had died for him. Not that it helped.
“D’you know who else is coming back?” Neville dared, “Seamus and Dean said they were, and last I hear Lavender hadn’t decided.” The others just shrugged, summer had been too hectic to send owls to old school friends.
“Finally!” He muttered as Ron and Hermione made their way into the common room. Pansy quickly scampered off of the sofa as they approached.
“You too, Madame Pomfrey,” he put on a fake smile, hoping she couldn’t tell, “I was wondering if I could get a sleeping draught?”
“Look who I found on the platform!” He gestured to Luna before sitting down next to Harry, Luna took her the last seat and gave him the signature Lovegood look. He hadn’t realized how much time had passed until the train pulled away from the station.
“Unitatis,” he panted to the portrait guarding their dorms. He squeezed through as soon as he could and ran until he found what he was looking for. “Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy” read the door, along with an etching of a lion and a snake, they appeared to be sleeping at the moment. He collapsed on the bed nearest the door, but didn’t close his eyes, afraid of what he would see when he did. He laid there, unmoving, until his heart beat returned to normal. He didn’t know how long the feast was going to go until, so he put on the invisibility cloak and stuffed the Marauders Map in his pocket, in order to avoid as many unwanted conversations as possible for as long as possible. He made his way to the hospital wing, walking this time, and he nearly forgot to remove the cloak before walking in.
“Nothings wrong, I’m alright, really,” he faked a smile. And they let him, it was too early to have an argument. They sat in silence a minute longer.
With nowhere else to go, he sat down on the couch by Ginny’s feet. He lit the fireplace with the flick of his wand and watched it as if it was the most exciting thing he had ever seen.
“Harry!” She greeted him with a warm embrace, “it’s so nice to see you.” Her smile and warm eyes were unmatched.
“Who knows! Accio that blue cup over there!” A blue cup zoomed over to her, “Aguamenti.” She drank her water eagerly. “Much better.” A few more people made their way to the common room, Dean looked at Seamus and just tutted. Neville announced he was going to the kitchen, and asked for orders before swerving dramatically and landing soundly in the nearest chair. Hannah bounded into the room, before asking, rather loudly, when the next party was. She was met with lots of groans and a few pillows.
“Would Master Harry like breakfast?” His mouth twisted into what could be considered a smile. Harry had ordered Kreature to help out the Weasley’s soon after the war ended, to which he voiced his disapproval but had to follow through with.
“You look better Harry, those potions really do wonders don’t they?” Luna said absently, Harry returned to nodding as a form of communication. The pair squished themselves in between whoever they could to sit at the table.
At nine sharp, he bid Kreature farewell, grabbed his things, stepped outside of his flat, and apparated to the Tonks’.
“Potter, are you drunk?” Draco asked as he fell over after pushing the door open, which had been a lot lighter than he thought it would be.
“Oh, congrats!” He nodded toward the shiny quidditch captain pin Ginny was wearing, “Knew you’d get it.” Ginny smiled.
“‘Arry!” Hagrid boomed ecstatically, Harry stood up to allow Hagrid to give him a hug that nearly knocked the breath out of him. “They made me ‘ead of Gryffindor ‘ouse! Isn’t that great!” Harry and the others gave a chorus of agreement at this news. “Minerva’s gonna give the eighth years a talk after breakfast about classes, I’ve got to pass out these timetables, it was nice seeing you lot!” Hagrid said as he made his way down the table.
“S’alright, Harry,” Ron sat down across from him, “I do it too, ya know, sometimes.” And Hermione just started at him in a way that said everything, he nodded at them and dropped his gaze to the floor. He hadn’t even noticed Ginny, who sat down next to Hermione, even though it was now a three to one seating arrangement. Neville came in shortly after, breaking the tension that Harry pretended not to notice was there.
At dinner, McGonagall said a few more words about respect and unity, Harry tried to listen, he really did, but he had no idea what she said. Word got out to a few trustworthy seventh years (Ginny and Luna, to be exact) about the events about to unfold in the seventh year common room. And Harry was excited, mainly because the loud music drowned out his rather negative thoughts and alcohol had the tendency to make him happier as a whole.
Harry woke up to an empty room, again. Though he had managed to get half his shirt off and turned himself around so his feet were on his pillows while sleeping. No nightmare, that was good. It was early though, and he supposed that everyone else was still sleeping there. Knowing there was no chance of going back to the bed, he went to the bathroom and made himself as presentable as possible, given his inability to see clearly, even with glasses.
“Mr. Potter, a word,” McGonagall appeared almost instantly after the last student made their way into the Great Hall. She quickly ushered him around the corner before casting a silencing charm.
“Bed,” was all he could croak out before falling asleep again. Ginny pulled her legs up to her chest as if she was embarrassed they had been so close to Harry.
“Walk?” Ron suggested just as they’d sat down, his twitching leg showed he was eager to do anything but sit down. They all got up and walked back out of the portrait they had just climbed through. They made their way to the lake in silence, though Harry walked a little behind Ron and Hermione. They kept whispering to each other, but Harry didn’t feel left out.
“Harry?” They said together as they sat down under a tree by the lake, “You’ll tell us if somethings wrong, yeah?” Ron finished.
They were stopped just inside the entrance hall, “McGonagall asked us to wait,” Hannah Abbot supplied, and so they watched the rest of the students walk past them into the Great Hall, each of them gawking at the Boy Who Lived as they passed. Perhaps Harry would have participated in the seemingly engaging conversation Ron and Hermione were having with Lavender Brown if he hadn’t noticed the bright blond hair of Draco Malfoy, but then again, maybe not. Draco was standing off to the side, looking at his feet. And so, he stared at him as if he were a ferret, which would’ve been funny enough a different year, except that Moody turned out to be a death eater in disguise and the real Mad-Eye was dead. It was an odd sight, and Harry didn’t know what to think, he wasn’t used to seeing him without his normal air of confidence. Although he hadn’t seen Draco since he testified on his and his mothers behalf (not Lucius’s though) near the end of May, maybe this is just how he is now. Draco finally looked up, sensing the hole Harry was burning in the back of his head. They made eye contact, which Draco quickly ended by looking back down at his feet.
“Drank… so much,” she groaned, before clapping a hand to her mouth. “Harry!” She practically shouted.
Harry jolted awake, the laugh of Voldemort echoing in his mind. It’s just a dream, the war is over, he mumbled to himself as he put his glasses on. He glanced at the alarm clock next to him, 4:00. Good, that was the most sleep he’d gotten all week. He pulled on an extra jumper and made his way to the kitchen, ignoring the empty trunk by his door. He liked his flat, it was small, but it didn’t hold the ghosts that The Burrow and 12 Grimmauld Place did. He turned the kettle on with a flick of his wand and curled up under a blanket, maybe sleep would come to him here. No such luck. He flicked his wand again, this time a loud crash followed, he cursed himself under his breath. He had gotten pretty good at wordless magic over the summer, but he was always disoriented this soon after a nightmare.
At eight, he decided to get up and get dressed. He spent the rest of the hour making sure Kreature had packed everything he needed (he had) and pacing the length of his flat.
“Oh, brilliant,” and for the first time since he left Andromeda’s house, he smiled. “Yeah, amazing, I saw him this morning and he had this bright blue hair, it was wicked, and he’s always smiling, always, and,” he rambled on and on, and no one moved to interrupt him. It was the most he said in a long time, but they didn’t know that. He continued, telling them stories he couldn’t remember if he had told them before, but it didn’t matter. He spoke until he couldn’t, his dream came crashing back to the front of his mind, Remus and Tonks were dead, and Teddy would grow up without his parents. So he stopped, abruptly, mid-sentence, and turned his gaze back to the window. An eerie silence followed, but what could he do about it.
“Honestly Harry, you’ve got to start listening to McGonagall!” He shrugged, and Hermione continued, “We’ve been given the rest of the week off, McGonagall wants to give us time to adjust before starting class. Which I think is rather ridiculous.”
The arrival of the trolly brought much needed sweets and normalcy to the compartment. The quaint attitude was quickly disrupted when Neville opened his chocolate frog.
And that’s how the rest of the week went. Harry slowly came back to his pre-war self, at least he was able to hold conversations longer than a few words, he still pulled out his wand whenever he heard anything resembling a suspicious noise, some things will never go back to normal, he thought. Student’s still approached him everywhere, and they stared and whispered as he walked past them. They had a few more parties, though none as intense as their first one. And Harry had finished the last of his sleeping draughts before lessons had even started, whether that be on the nights he was sober enough to take them, or when he fancied a nap in the middle of the day. It didn’t help, he was still tired all the time, and there was no way he could go back to Madam Pomfrey and ask for more, at least not so soon after his first visit. Harry had only seen his roommate a few times, he was never in the common room, and it seemed he always disappeared in the morning before Harry had even woken up. Although he was sure he could blame the sleeping draughts and hangovers for that, Draco had not attended a single party, as of yet.
“Well, if Pansy Parkinson is up, I think it’s time we go back, ready Luna?” He had not noticed Luna had woken up, she looked as if the only thing she drank last night was water. Pansy just shushed them and put a hand on her forehead. “See you at breakfast," she looked at him quizzically, "No, lunch!” Ginny said as she and Luna retreated out of the room.
A/N: I don’t actually have much to say this time which is surprising since I seem to talk a lot. Do my long author’s notes annoy you all?
“Who was the student that came forward?” Harry asked. Both Pomfrey and Harry seemed to have forgotten that Draco was still in the room.
“Physically, his condition terrible. He has several ribs which have been broken and have healed in funny positions due to lack of medical treatment. He’s also suffered minor damage to his skull, although I haven’t been able to tell the cause. If it had been from a Quidditch accident, I would have seen it and been able to heal it, but it seems to be from long before his Hogwarts days. He has a lot of bruising and scarring on his body, particularly on his upper back and arms. The scars on his upper back seem to be quite sensitive, as even in his unconscious state he flinched when I attempted to heal them. I did the best I could, but only the more recent ones have faded, and even then, they didn’t completely heal. I did manage to heal the fresh cuts on his arms and reduce the scarring from them, but the less recent ones are out of my healing abilities,” Pomfrey paused and gauged Draco’s reaction, which was that of shock, before continuing, “And, this is where it gets far worse, and if I hear of you telling any other students of this you will be punished severely. He seems to have suffered from intense damage to his… to his…” She broke of to regain composure. Draco glanced from her to Harry to back to her before returning his gaze to Harry.
“Boy! Look at me!” Vernon thundered, and Harry’s eyes snapped open. Vernon towered over Harry, making him feel smaller than he already was. “Hm, shame Petunia is home, isn’t it? There’s much more I could
“Well, erm, thanks for the birthday letter.” Harry said awkwardly before shuffling back to his bed and sitting down. Ron only grunted in reply, and Harry sighed, feeling both sadness and irritation twist at him. Why was Ron acting like this? It wasn’t like they’d spoken much since the end of the school year, and they had been fine then, so what could Harry have possibly done to upset Ron. ‘Perhaps I’m overthinking this,’ Harry thought, trying to relax. Suddenly, Ron shot up and snatched a newspaper that had been sitting on his nightstand. “I can’t believe you, Harry! You’ve not only betrayed me, but also Hermione and the rest of the Light Side.” He shouted, hurling the newspaper at Harry. Harry caught it and looked at the cover. He couldn’t believe what he was reading. It read:
After a long day of dragging himself around, always a few steps behind the Weasley family, they all met back at the Leaky Cauldron to Floo back to the Burrow. Fred and George had a few bags of products from their shop with them, while everyone else held bags of school supplies. Harry had noticed how Molly had skimped on getting new robes for Ron and Ginny and their books were used. He felt a pang of guilt, knowing he could have helped out, but Molly would never accept that from him. Once back at the Burrow, everyone went their separate ways like usual. Harry spent his time organising his things in his trunk. Later that night, while he was laying on his cot in the twins’ room, he felt his stomach twisting with nerves and excitement over going back to Hogwarts. Something felt like it was going to go terribly wrong, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was. He’d hardly heard a word from Dumbledore all summer, and he wondered if maybe his nerves were because he had no idea about what Voldemort had been doing for the past several months. Sighing heavily, he dozed off, his dreams plagued with faceless figures and insults being hurled at him.
The two reached the room and Harry immediately flung himself onto the nearest couch. “Y’know… I hate to ask you now, but what did Weasel do to you?” Draco asked, sitting down on the armchair next to the couch. A look of something similar to despair crossed over Harry’s face and his eyes seemed to be almost glazed over. Harry opened his mouth, seeming like he was going to answer Draco’s question, only to pour out a flood of self-hatred.
“I h-haven’t been able to d-do anything w-without you… Even all of my plants d-died. It’s like they w-went with you…” Draco choked out.
A/N: This was a long chapter and it took me ages to write and I’m not that happy with it but I’m posting it anyways since I need to get on with this story. I’ve sped up Draco and Harry befriending each other so they’ll have some pure moments before they start realizing their true feelings :’) Some of the characters that have gone against Harry will come back to support him for the sake of the ships that I want to feature! Anyways, I leave for the beach quite soon, so I’ll be trying to update as much as possible during that week, but we’ll see how it goes. I’m also planning far ahead in this story, so I know where I want to go but I’m not sure if I’ll ever eventually include smut or if I’ll not include that but oh wellllllll. Thank you for the nearly 100 reads on Wattpad, and the nearly 500 reads on AO3!
Harry, exhausted from the previous day’s drama, slept quite heavily that night. And with sleep comes dreams, but Harry’s are never pleasant. He slipped into a dream, which had taken him back to Number Four, Privet Drive.
“Where else would I sleep?” Draco gestured around the room. Pomfrey had taken the second bed out after seeing that Draco had slept in the chair. Harry scooted over in the bed to make extra space.
“So, we found another person, should he agree to this. Since he is already aware of what happened last night, he seemed like a good option.” Pomfrey’s eyes flicked over to Draco, who was listening intently to the conversation. Harry caught the implications of her words and his eyes widened.
“Yes, go on upstairs, but please,” She lowered her voice, “Take a dinner roll with you. And don’t let Vernon see it, for heaven’s sake.”
“Because… Wait, how accepting are you of, you know?” She made an incomprehensible motion with her hands.
As Draco made his way down the street towards where Harry now laid, forever, his mind replayed that fateful day over and over in his head. How he had found Harry, crumpled on the bathroom floor, unnaturally cold. And how the note he had left had only read, ‘I’m sorry, Draco. I love you. Forever.’
“There is a way, but it’s ancient and not used very often. It’s not too safe, but people still choose to put themselves through it.” Draco shrugged.
A/N: Before I get into this chapter I’d like to announce the ships that will be featured (eventually) in this fic! If you’re uninterested then you can just get right into reading the chapter!
“But it’s true! You are a Parselmouth! You did nearly get sorted into Slytherin! You can try to lie, but you can’t fool me! I know exactly what you’re playing at!” Ron shot back, his face flushing a beet red.
Harry snatched his wand from where he had left it on his bed. He checked his watch. 10:00. ‘Good,’ He thought, ‘Everyone will be in their common rooms now.’ He walked out of the Room of Requirement, leaving his invisibility cloak behind. He wouldn’t need it, should everything go according to his plan. Harry made his way to the Astronomy Tower, conjuring some parchment and a quill while he walked so he could write a note, not like anyone cared enough about him at this point to read it. The halls were deserted and dark, but that didn’t bother Harry at all. The only people he had to worry about running into were Prefects, but the chance of that was slim, seeing as the castle was huge and there were only two Prefects per house. He climbed the steps to the tower and went over to the edge, sitting down on the ground to finish writing the note.
I adopted a cat in October 2019! Her name is Luna and she's the most crazy cat I've ever met. Whenever I move out, I'll get to take her with me, which is probably just because she's way too insane for my parents to take care of. She was a stray kitten who was starving, so I fed her and now she's completely bonded to me and my family.
“Come here then. Close the curtains completely behind you.” She turned on her heel and went over to Harry’s bedside. Draco followed after her, securing the curtains closed with the small clasps that adorned them. He turned to look at Harry, and the sight shocked him. Harry was very pale, there were dark bags under his eyes, which seemed sunken. His whole body was very thin, but the thinness was most visible in his face, where his cheeks seemed pinched, and his cheekbones were prominent, where in previous years, they’d been less visible. Draco felt as if the wind had been knocked out of him, his brain struggled to process the image before him. Pomfrey noticed his shock and she conjured a chair for Draco to sit in. Draco quickly took a seat after he scooted the chair over to the side of Harry’s bed. “It’s far worse than it looks.” She said somberly.
“I’m sure you’ve already come to the conclusion of where I suspect the other physically injuries are from.” Pomfrey sighed. Draco nodded and scooted his chair up closer to Harry’s head.
“Alright, get those supply lists out, let’s see where we need to start.” Molly said, not unkindly, but with a firm tone in her voice. They stood just inside the entrance to Diagon Alley, looking rather scatter-brained despite going through the same drill every year.
Draco wanted nothing more than to go back in time and stop Harry from doing it. But no amount of hoping and wishing and battling with himself internally would change reality. He remembered stumbling to Pansy and Hermione’s flat several months after Harry had died, drunk and sobbing uncontrollably. No matter how many times Pansy tried to console him, he’d cry harder and manage to choke out a “When will this end? Why can’t he come back?” To which Pansy would always reply with “I don’t know, darling, I really don’t know.”
Shopping for school  supplies was uneventful, despite Ron’s blowup the day before. Ginny and Ron were both giving Harry death glares throughout the whole event, but Harry paid them no mind. If they were going to believe the rubbish Skeeter had published, then it was their loss. Fred and George accompanied Harry and the others on their school supply shopping trip despite no longer attending Hogwarts. The twins seemed to have come to some sort of unspoken agreement that they needed to keep an eye on Harry for the week he was at their house, to make sure Ron or Ginny didn’t try anything, seeing as both of them believed the article that had been written about Harry.
“You are to go clean the upstairs bathrooms. Once you finish, begin cooking dinner. I expect a lovely meal.” Vernon said, his voice deadly calm, sending a chill down Harry’s spine. Harry nodded and went to the closet and dug out all the cleaning supplies, mentally grumbling. There were three bathrooms upstairs, a tiny, cramped one in the hall for Harry to use, one in Dudley’s room just for him, and one in Petunia and Vernon’s room just for them. The master bathroom had both a jacuzzi bath and a shower, increasing the amount of work it took to clean. He lugged all the supplies up to the bathrooms and set to work, beginning in the master bathroom. He then cleaned Dudley’s bathroom, and finally, his own. He didn’t mind cleaning his own bathroom, it gave him a chance to make sure all his things he had stored in there remained hidden. At around 4:30 pm, Harry had finished his bathroom cleaning chore, so he made his way downstairs with the supplies. He tucked them away in the closet and washed his hands, beginning to prepare dinner. Vernon was thankfully asleep on the couch, a relief to Harry. Petunia was off at her computer, gossiping with her friends. Dudley would be spending the night with his gang, so Harry was pretty much alone again, with the cold feeling looming over him. He brushed it aside and started chopping vegetables for dinner. The house was silent except for chopping noises and the occasional snore from Vernon. Harry cooked quickly, knowing if dinner was still being prepared after 6:00, Vernon would throw a fit. He shuddered at the thought, quickening his pace. He finished right at six, placing the meal on the table. He had prepared a meal of beef stew, and the smell was wonderful. He had set the table beautifully, even adding some flowers in the centre for decoration. He did not set a place for himself, as always, since he was not welcome at the table. He went out to the main hall and called to both Vernon and Petunia. “Dinner is ready!” He called, careful to not be too loud, his voice hoarse. Petunia rose from her computer and gently woke Vernon. She nodded silently in Harry’s direction, allowing him a chance to escape up to his room before Vernon was awake. She and Harry had come to a sort of silent agreement; Harry would remain obedient and not challenge Vernon and Petunia would do her best to protect him from Vernon’s wrath when she could. Harry scurried off to his room, hungry but grateful to have avoided becoming a punching bag, at least for now. He could hear the clink of silverware against dishes and soon he fell asleep, the cold feeling creeping back to him like moth to a flame.
The first month after it had happened, Draco didn’t go and visit Harry on the one-month anniversary. It was raining heavily, and Draco felt as if the sky was feeling his pain and sadness.
“No need to thank me, I’m only doing what’s right. Well, at least, the most right thing I can do at the time.” Draco shrugged.
A couple hours later, Vernon and Petunia arrived back home, entering the house loudly. Harry awoke slowly, disoriented by the sudden noise. Petunia could be heard bustling around downstairs, putting their lunch leftovers into the fridge. Vernon stomped up the stairs and Harry sat up, bracing himself for whatever was to come.The sound of many locks being undone sounded much louder to Harry than it actually was. Vernon opened the door with a loud bam as it hit the wall, the doorstop having been removed eons ago. “Boy! Get up and go downstairs! Petunia has a list of chores for you!” Vernon barked. Harry scrambled off his mattress, knowing better than to give a verbal reply, even if it was one in agreement to what Vernon had said. He gave Vernon a half nod/half bow as he fled the room, practically running down the stairs. Harry knew much better than to delay in obeying
“Isn’t it obvious? I’m teaching this filth a lesson.” Ron turned back to Harry and landed a decent punch to his ribs, smirking evilly at the noise the force made. Something in Draco snapped, and he lunged forward, shoving Ron away from Harry and down onto the floor. With a wave of his wand, Ron was shoved even further away from Harry, and with another wave, Harry was released from the full body bind and he sat up, coughing. Draco lifted him from the floor and allowed Harry to prop himself against him. Draco quickly fixed Harry’s glasses and pushed them onto Harry’s face. Harry was extremely out of it. He was sporting a rather large bruise on his jaw and on his right eye, and he had scratch marks on his cheeks and throat. Harry blinked several times, determined to pull himself together. Draco wrapped an arm loosely around Harry’s waist, there to support him should he need it. “Do you want to go to the hospital wing so Pomfrey can heal whatever Weasel did to you?” Draco asked. Harry shook his head, not trusting his voice.
Later that evening after a rather awkward but delicious dinner, Harry and the twins played a bit of Wizard’s Chess, Fred and George alternating between rounds. It was late at night when they finally went to bed. The next day, they would be going to Diagon Alley to purchases school supplies, and Harry was feeling both excited and a bit of dread at having to spend so much time near Ron. He didn’t wish to be back at the Dursley’s, but he couldn’t help but wish he hadn’t come to the Weasley’s house. His thoughts trailed off as he fell asleep, sleeping peacefully for once in his life.
“As a flaming homosexual, I’m aware of what bisexuality is, I just didn’t take you as the type that swung both ways.” Draco replied, not bothering to voice his thoughts on Ginny.
“Hedwig is… locked in her cage…” He mumbled, gesturing lamely to the large padlock on the front of the cage. Hedwig wasn’t looking too great herself, she was thinner than a standard owl and her feathers were dull. There was also a great amount of her feathers at the bottom of her cage, either from her pulling them out herself or from them falling out due to lack of basic nutrition. Harry chewed his lower lip anxiously, he really didn’t want to have to think up  an excuse as to why she was locked in, but it would be even worse if he told Molly what happened at the Dursleys’ house. She’d likely storm over to Privet Drive and really tear into the Dursleys, and then when he inevitably would be forced back to them next summer, they’d make sure he’d never see the light of day again. He was snapped out of his increasingly dark thoughts by Molly uttering a simple unlocking charm. The padlock popped open and slipped off the bars of the cage, clattering first to the chair and then bouncing to the floor. Neither Molly or Harry made a move towards it at first, both staring semi-numbly at the offending object. Harry cleared his throat.
“Oh, don’t flatter me, they’re just sandwiches.” She replied, although the satisfied grin on her face told Harry that she enjoyed the praise.
“Fair point. What do you want to talk about?” Draco was still trying to wake up fully, which was evident in his lack of conversation skills.
Soon, the week was over and it was September 1st, and Molly Weasley had brought Harry, Ron, and Ginny to King’s Cross Station. They made their way to the platform, not talking to each other. Ron and Harry hadn’t spoken since Ron’s blowup, and Ginny hadn’t said a word to Harry since the end of the previous school year. Once they reached the platform, Molly hugged Harry goodbye before turning to Ron and Ginny, lecturing them about behaving and doing well in their classes. Harry boarded the train and made his way to the very back of the train, seating himself in an empty compartment. He tucked his trunk on the luggage rack above the seat and he set Hedwig’s cage on the seat across from his. Ron and Hermione had Prefect duties to attend to, not like they would have sat with him anyways. ‘Hermione probably believes the article as well, and even if she didn’t, she wouldn’t go against Ron, now that they’re dating,’ Harry thought bitterly, the cold feeling creeping up on him again. He’d been suppressing it as best he could, hanging out with the twins had been a much-needed distraction. But now, he was alone, with nothing to stop the coldness from consuming his thoughts. He drew the curtains of the compartment shut, leaving him to sit in the dim lighting of the magical lights on the walls. The motion of the train soon soothed him into sleep, and for once, his sleep wasn’t plagued with nightmares.
“Yes sir, I understand.” Harry replied, fighting to keep the tremour out of his voice. Vernon released his grip on Harry’s hair, looking disgusted at him. Harry stepped back, into the hall as Vernon grabbed the key to the cupboard. He pushed past Harry to roughly unlock the cupboard, just as a car pulling up could be heard outside. Harry’s trunk was roughly shoved at him as there was a knock at the door. Petunia emerged from wherever she had been, probably the back garden if Harry had to guess, and opened the door, plastering on her all-too-happy smile. She opened the door as Harry struggled with the weight of his trunk, Vernon standing menacingly behind him.
“I’ve been alright. My summer has been like usual. I couldn’t let Hedwig out so I wasn’t able to send many letters.” Harry shrugged.
“I thought Ron was writing to you? He told me he’d been writing to you pretty much every day.” Mr. Weasley said, a puzzled expression on his face as he drove.
“Sorry, sorry! I need to brush my hair and I forgot my hairbrush in here.” She grabbed the red brush off of the counter.
Nothing much happened from then until summer 2020, when I realised that I'm transgender. I use he/they pronouns now (although I prefer he/him). I'm still deciding on a name, but I'm going to be changing my writing profiles to reflect that I'm a dude. It's taking some getting used to but I feel so much happier with my short hair and new clothes. Any name suggestions are appreciated, I love unique and interesting names.
Harry wandered aimlessly through the school, occasionally chatting with the portraits or looking out the windows as the sun rose, casting a pinkish glow over the grounds. Somehow, his legs managed to carry him to the Gryffindor Tower, and to his dismay, it happened to be right around the time when everyone began leaving the tower. He looked around for somewhere to hide while he waited for the hall to be empty again. He ducked silently behind a rather large suit of armor right as Ginny and Hermione came out of the Tower, chatting loudly about the latest gossip, something very out of character for Hermione. After a while of waiting, and a ton of students flooding out of the Gryffindor Tower, Harry decided the coast was probably clear, so he stepped out from behind the suit of armor and began making his way down the hall to the main staircase, so he could go to breakfast. He made it about halfway down the hall before he felt a presence behind him. Harry slowly turned and was met with the sneering face of none other than Ronald Weasley. Ron quickly moved up to him and grabbed his robes collar, yanking Harry closer to him. Harry flinched and tried to pull Ron’s hands off of his robes, to no avail, due to him being extremely small and weak because of the malnourishment he had received from the Dursley’s. “Weasley, let go of me!” Harry hissed, struggling to get away.
Nothing was alright. Draco, and the rest of those close to Harry were completely devastated. Ron had lost his cheerfulness, and his usually rosy complexion was now a sickly grey. Hermione had lost her interest in books, claiming they reminded her too much of the days she’d nag Harry to study. The rest of the Weasley’s had set an extra seat for him at the table at every meal, next to the seat they would set for Fred. Pansy and Blaise, Harry’s newest friends, weren’t as torn up, but they still felt grief. They channeled their grief into helping Harry’s close friends.
About two hours into Harry’s nap, the compartment door slid open, the bright light from outside waking Harry. Harry blinked a few times, his eyes focusing on the person in the doorway. The figure stepped in, and Harry’s eyes adjusted, and he could clearly make out who was standing before him. Draco Malfoy had stepped into the compartment, wearing his pristine robes with a shiny Prefect’s badge positioned proudly on one side. He held his wand in one hand, and his trunk in the other. He rolled his eyes at Harry. “Care to move your bird cage off the other seat? I’ve got no where else to sit.” Draco said, boredom in his voice. He had grown weary of Pansy and Blaise’s bickering, but all of the other compartments had been full, or containing annoying first years.
Draco couldn’t wait for the day the rain would be a sunny day and give him the chance to sit out there with Harry, and maybe give him some peace.
Harry laid on his lumpy mattress in his room on Number Four, Privet Drive. It was a hot and humid August day, and Dudley was out with his gang, Petunia and Vernon were out having a nice lunch date, giving Harry no reason to get up and do something.  He stared at the ceiling, a cold feeling deep in the pit of his stomach. He’d been feeling that way a lot lately, but he usually could ignore it as he did chores and yard work. Today, however, he was alone with the strange cold feeling and he didn’t know what to do with it. He was beginning his 6th year at Hogwarts soon, a time where he should have his career picked out and a clear idea of where he wanted to go in life, yet he had never felt more unsure of himself. He stood and stretched, shaking his messy black hair out of his face and beginning to pack for school. He still had an entire month to wait before school started, but somehow the Weasley’s managed to get permission to pick him up for a week before for school shopping. Harry could not wait for the opportunity to get out of Privet Drive, he hadn’t been able to leave all summer.
“If you insist, Harry. Let me help you with your things,” Arthur replied calmly, taking Harry’s trunk from him. Harry bent and grabbed his backpack and Hedwig from where he had placed them by the door. Arthur turned and walked towards his car, Harry following closely. The door could be heard slamming behind them, but Harry didn’t have it in him to care. Arthur’s car was an older Ford, similar to the Anglia. It was slightly more battered than the Anglia had been in its better days. Arthur opened the door to the backseat and slid Harry’s trunk onto the seat. Harry set Hedwig gently on the seat next to his trunk and placed his bag on the floor, before making his way over to the passenger seat. Arthur hopped into the driver’s seat and started the car. After Harry got settled in and they were a bit down the road, Arthur decided to break the silence.
A/N: So, this took me forever to write and it’s not even that good, so I’m kind of disappointed with it. I really struggle to write the Weasleys, especially bad Weasleys like I’m using for this story but I’m trying my best! It’s going to take a while to get into the Drarry part since I don’t want to rush it because I want it to be as natural as possible and I need to incorporate Harry’s obvious mental scars into how he behaves. Not sure how many chapters this will end up being, but at this rate it’ll probably be 20+. Things are obviously going to get a lot darker for Harry and I will probably write about self-harm and suicidal thoughts, so if that upsets you then please don’t read. I feel like I’m always saying “don’t read if-“ but I really don’t want to upset anyone with my works. Please stay safe and my inbox is always open for those who wish to talk. Ciao for now~
Draco was vaguely aware of warm breath on his neck as he slowly woke up. The light from a nearby window hit his face and made him wince; it was far too early to be exposed to such brightness. As he became more aware of his surroundings, he became increasingly aware of the breathing on his neck. He twisted his head as far as he could without moving the rest of his body and caught a glimpse of Harry curled up behind him. Harry had somehow migrated over to Draco in his sleep and was now hugging him from behind. Harry had a leg thrown over Draco’s waist and an arm curled over Draco’s shoulders. Harry’s face was resting very close to Draco’s neck, almost touching it. Draco didn’t really mind this, but he needed to use the restroom so he gently nudged Harry. Harry didn’t budge, so he tried again. Harry’s eyes flew open and he blinked several times to try to focus them. Draco suddenly had an idea. “I thought you said to not try anything, Potter?” Draco smirked, his eyes going from Harry’s leg across his waist to Harry’s face. Harry blinked at Draco confusedly before looking down at his arm and his leg. He let out a shrill squeak and scrambled backwards, falling off the bed with a loud thud. “Oh Merlin, Potter, are you okay?” Draco asked as he scampered over to the other side of the bed to see where Harry had landed. Harry was sitting up on the floor, wincing a bit at the pain from hitting the floor. “I’m fine, Malfoy.” Harry said, a tinge of embarrassment on his cheeks.
