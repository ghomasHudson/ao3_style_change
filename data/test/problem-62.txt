“Nothing.”
“Isn’t it? It’s a great way to escape the world for a while, just watch everything go by. I started boating when I got divorced. I needed something to help me through the rough times, and it really did,” explained Ryan with a gentle smile. “Maybe you should look into it.”
“It was handed to my father at the ministry, taken away from an ex Death Eater who was attempting to use it for evil.”
“In love with Draco Malfoy,” said George from across the room. Harry had almost forgotten he was there. “Well, I guess
Malfoy hadn’t noticed spiral. He was too busy thinking about his argument with Astoria, how she had embarrassed him in front of his staff. But also, how he felt awful for shouting at her. He knew she didn’t mean any harm by it, sometimes she just talks too much which can get her in trouble. She had a heart of gold; she tried her hardest with Malfoy, but he didn’t try with her. He wasn’t honest with her from the beginning and now it felt it was too late to be honest. He had caught himself in a lie and was unsure how to get out of it.
“Thanks, Potter,” replied Malfoy, before Harry turned around and walked out of the dark room.
“I’m unsure,” he looked back out the window, a frown creasing his forehead. “I just know it doesn’t feel right with her, which makes it difficult for us to try and have a child. Which, is something she really wants.”
Mr Weasley was the first to recite the spell, muttering “protego totalum” over and over again, all the way around the attic room until it was completely sealed. Memories flashed in Harry’s mind back to Epping forest, when Hermione used a protection spell so the snatchers couldn’t find them.
“Yes,” replied the witch, looking at him in the eyes. “It’s time.”
“Just think of something, Malfoy. Anything you can. Let the memory consume you, take over you, so nothing else is in your mind. Anything at all and give it a try.”
Once the food had been laid out, even larger doors opened and in they came, the family Harry dreaded to see each day, following each other in one after another. As the family sat down, Harry and the other butlers got into action, grabbing the objects they did every single morning. Harry would be the one to pour the water.
“Draco,” said Harry quietly, “I need us to go back to the manor, now.”
“We’re apparating.”
There, he saw his own face. A poster similar to the ones used when he was hunting horcruxes.
“How on earth do you already know that?” Asked Harry, grabbing the soap and lathering his body with it.
“I don’t care,” yawned Malfoy. Trying his best not to chuckle, Harry shook his head. Malfoy looked very sweet, lying there curled up, his eyes closed still.
Then, it disappeared. Harry stopped in his tracks, frantically looking around to see if it would reappear anywhere. Heart racing, he could hear the blood pumping in his ears as his breath got quicker.
“Mm. That’s just how it is, isn’t it?” Malfoy looked back up at him, his grey eyes piercing. They were searching Harry’s face, as if searching for an answer. “Everything ends. Nothing lasts, not our relationships, not our souls. Sometimes it’s hard to remember the point of anything. Signing these papers, sipping tea, waking up in the morning. It’s all another step closer to our ends.”
“Have you told anyone else? Ron?” asked Mrs Weasley.
First, Draco thought back to his wedding with Astoria. The way she looked when he walked down in the isle, the proud smiles of his mother and father. The way they held hands throughout the whole ceremony, how Astoria’s hazel brown eyes didn’t leave Draco’s face as they spoke their vows to each other.
“It’s okay. I hate that he has missed out on so much, and so little, such as the sunrise. But I feel him here with me all the time. As if us being twins made us connected even after death. It’s as though he’s looking through my eyes, watching the sun with me, experiencing life with me.”
“They also did things such as using invisible ink, which we had attempted, but one of the Death Eaters had found out about this due to invisible ink being widely used in the wizarding world. Fortunately for us, it wasn’t an important letter, it was mostly a test to see if any of the Death Eaters figured out our tactics. We’ve managed to let a few letters slip through the cracks with having a certain pattern with letters within our sentences, but sometimes it would be difficult to decipher and we stopped doing that. The ribbon tactic was far easier, and we have been using it for the past two years or so,” explained Draco.
Without saying anything, she placed a piece of paper in front of Harry.
“Hi, George,” said Harry.
“Oh Harry,” she cooed, giving his hand a gentle squeeze. Nothing else was said by the trio, but that was okay, the silence almost comforted Harry. For years they’d tried to help him with words, tell him he was okay, everything was okay, but he knew it wasn’t. He’d never be okay again, not truly. Ron and Hermione found just sitting with Harry, sitting with him in the puddle of sadness, was the best comfort for him. No words, just being there, a gentle touch every so often to remind him that it was now all memories.
Harry knew he had truly succeeded in his life.
“We really fell for each other, then. Well, at least I fell for him. We’d sneak out of the manor to a place he liked to go and spend time together; we’d continue our day trips. Then Lucius found out and attacked me right in front of Draco. Told us I was no longer his bodyguard. Our relationship we had together became extremely strained, and we constantly argued, until I just couldn’t take it anymore,” finally, Harry looked up at Mrs Weasley. To his surprise, her eyes were twinkling with understanding, a small smile on her thin lips.
They entered the Three Broomsticks, noticing a few wizards and witches who would be studying at Hogwarts there. This excited Hermione, seeing the next generation of wizards and witches. Harry didn’t have the heart to remind her if they were half-blood or muggleborn, they’d just end up the same as the trio, trapped.
“Oh Hermione, I do adore your children,” complimented Astoria as she gushed over the two, who were happily chatting away. “Draco and I are trying to have children.”
He didn’t bother knocking on the door. He knew Malfoy wouldn’t let anyone in. He had to ask him straight up, what was going on. What was he hiding from his father? What was he hiding from
But it was too late, he was too loud, and there was a soft knock on the door.
“Sorry grandma,” the kids both said in unison before running away again, giggling and screaming.
“He has? How is Draco?” asked Harry quickly, giving her hand a squeeze so she’d respond fast.
They’d arrived at St. Mungos as quickly as they could floo there. The Weasleys were all outside the room, crying into their hands, Mr Weasley attempting to comfort Mrs Weasley as he sobbed too. The scene was heart breaking for Harry to watch, he felt as though he was intruding, he felt as though it was his fault.
“Well, you did say he was in a bad mood,” shrugged Harry.
“Draco,” whispered Harry softly, tucking hair behind Draco’s pointed ears. After a few more moments of silence, Harry stood up and walked to the other side of the bed. Taking off his shoes, he pulled back the quilt and lay himself down next to the small frame, which lay curled up like a child.
“Much, I won’t tomorrow though,” laughed Harry, still watching him. Malfoy’s eyes kept flickering down to Harry’s thin lips then back up to his eyes, not wanting to break the eye contact but not being able to help himself.
The sounds of birds woke him up. Grumbling to himself, he pulled himself out of bed and grabbed his wand. Nothing felt better than that to him. Flicking his wand, he opened the curtains to the living room and headed into the kitchen, flicking his wand again to make the kettle boil. Things sure are so much easier using magic, he thought.
“Keep your voice down!” hissed Malfoy angrily, there was venom dripping in his speech.
“A floo network with other ministries has been set up here. At some point within the next few hours, members of the French, German, Norwegian and American ministries will be entering here. Then we can commence the operation.”
“I wish we could overthrow Lucius,” Neville said in a very hushed voice. “I hate the fact that this is happening to you guys.”
“Fine, fine!” surrendered Harry with his hands up, “I just need to do this first,” he took the cup and downed the rest of the brew, grunting as he slammed the glass down on the table. Malfoy cheered him, clapping his hands and laughing, causing Ron and Hermione to look over at them with a confused stare.
“I know you were involved in the Order back in my Hogwarts days. You’re among the few of the Order that survived the war, and haven’t been sent to the workhouses or to work for pureblood families,” Draco shifted uncomfortably as he thought back to the war, thought back to all the bodies he had to step over in order to get to his parents. “I need your help with something that’s incredibly important but has to remain a secret.”
“It is, but at least I get to see the sun rise. Care to join me?”
“I am,” she finally answered. “I don’t want it to happen to me.”
Tonight was yet another restless night for Harry. He had been plagued by a nightmare early into the night, causing him to lie awake after midnight. The moonlight shone through the thin curtains, softly illuminating the cramped room.
“Knockturn Alley,” he said, and with a puff of green smoke, he vanished.
“She desperately wants a child but we’re struggling to have a child. Problems in the bedroom,” Malfoy snorted as he spoke, “I just don’t feel that intimate connection anymore. Or the intellectual connection. My marriage is very boring, Potter. It’s so boring,” Malfoy looked at him and whined. “So boring!”
There was suddenly a rapid knock on the door. Everyone looked at each other, confused, as Ron and Hermione barely got visitors. Ron got himself off the sofa and opened the door to a very distressed looking Malfoy.
That night, there was a large thunderstorm. Harry was sure it reached across most of Britain. The thunder crashed loudly over the burrow, lightning flashing every few seconds. The rain battered down so hard on the window Harry thought it might break.
“What the bloody hell is going on?” asked Ron.
By the time they were able to see George, he had come around and been given some potions to help with the healing. Harry had insisted he wanted to stay out of the room, but Mr Weasley had made him come in.
“I must look good, you can’t take your eyes off me,” joked Harry. When Malfoy didn’t respond, he felt his heart rate quicken and his palms get sweaty. “I’m sorry, sir,” he then stuttered, looking at him with worried eyes. “I didn’t mean it.”
“And she still wants me back?”
“I’m not sure,” replied Harry truthfully. “Sometimes I do. Sometimes I think they were the worst years of my life.”
“Potter,” Malfoy called from inside the office. Holding in an annoyed sigh, Harry walked into the office.
“Sounds like you need a drink,” said Mr Weasley as he got up and hobbled over to his drink’s cabinet. He poured Harry a whiskey, handing it to him with a smile.
Draco’s head turned and his silver eyes lay on his mother. Harry saw his chin crumple as Narcissa rushed to the bedside. This was the first time the mother and son had seen each other since that fateful night, and it definitely made Draco emotional.
“Thank you,” she whispered, her hand slowly rubbing his back. “For everything you have done for this family. I know you don’t think so, but you have helped us immensely. You are my son,” she told him. Harry felt the tears well up in his eyes, he was sure it was just the whiskey making him emotional.
Though, Harry didn’t need to wonder. Because miles away, in the comfort of his candle lit bedroom, Draco sat on his window seat, knees pulled to his chest. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he watched the storm that was just as strong above the manor, remembering the time he danced in the rain with Harry.
“I’ll see you both tomorrow,” said Harry quickly before rushing after Malfoy. Expecting him to apparate, Harry caught up with Malfoy, but they just kept walking in the open nature. “Not too fast, Malfoy,” begged Harry, grunting as he attempted to keep up, “my head is murder today.”
“This was sent today,” said the witch, passing the wizard the ribbons. One of every colour. Breath hitching in his throat, he squeezed them tight in his hand.
“Can’t sleep?”
“No,” replied Malfoy, turning a page before shaking his head. “This is rubbish.”
“Does Astoria?” pondered Harry, slowly walking back over to the desk.
“It has. You’re clear, you can enter.”
“Merlin,” coughed Draco, being sick one more time before switching on the tap. Without a moment’s delay, Harry’s hand was rubbing Draco’s back, soothing him as best as he possibly could. A small hand with a tissue entered Draco’s vision and he looked to his side, seeing the comforting face of Molly Weasley.
Harry tuned out again, sipping his whiskey.
Walking round the rest of the table, serving Astoria and Narcissa their water, Harry then went and stood back at his position. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched as Malfoy put the bare minimum on his plate. His face never changed, his full lips stayed clenched together, his eyes staring only at the plate. Every so often he would look up at Astoria, whom he married a few years back, but his expression never altered.
Harry tugged him up and they said their goodnights, before he walked into the bedroom with Draco.
, it’s a classic,” said Harry, taking the book from Malfoy’s hands and putting it back down on his nightstand.
His hand began to shake as he knew he was in danger.
“The weekend!” Beamed Harry as he sat down next to Ron, giving him an elbow in the ribs.
Finally, all the guests had arrived, so Harry and Ron stood at the side of the room with the other butlers, awaiting instructions from Malfoy.
“We’re getting more info. And it doesn’t look good for you,” a grizzly voice said from beside the main wizard.
Then there was Narcissa. Though Draco had stated since Lucius’ take over there had been far more arguments between them, even threats of divorce, everyone knew how much Narcissa loved her husband. She did everything she could for him, stood by his side when Voldemort had taken residence in their manor, looked after him as he drank too much every night and suffered excruciating nightmares all those years ago.
“Some of my friends at the ministry approached me yesterday. Told me how you had been caught in Knockturn Alley, being assaulted by a few wizards. Is this true, Draco?”
Something sent shivers up Harry’s spine as they entered. The whole room unnerved him, and he couldn’t figure out why. Malfoy walked along the artefacts, carefully looking at each one, before deciding on a deep purple crystal ball. He pulled a silk cloth from his robe pockets and wrapped it around the ball, slowly and carefully picking it up. Malfoy tapped his wand on the ball and Harry watched as it shrunk in Malfoy’s thin hand, who then slipped it into his robe pocket.
“There’s something father has asked me to do and I need you with me, please,” Malfoy’s words were rushed, scared. His lip trembled as he spoke, and he could barely maintain eye contact.
“With me?” Harry sat next to him.
“I’m his bodyguard, I’m with him most of the time.”
“You will do no such thing,” said Harry breathlessly before getting hit by another hex. This time it hit his arm, causing him to yowl in pain.
“He’s been taking it out on the staff, Harry,” said Hermione, obviously trying to not worry Harry, but of course he was going to worry. “And Malfoy.”
Harry knocked on Ron’s door. The door opened and Potter saw the redhead peeking out of it. He looked quite disappointed, when he saw Harry.
Malfoy tilted his head back and breathed out the smoke. It was burning the inside of his lungs, he was enjoying it. He laughed out loud. It sounded weird, scary, a maniac kind of laugh. He was so pathetic. Liking the thing that hurt him. The thing that was slowly destroying his lungs but at the same time wrapping his organs in a warm blanket. It was keeping him warm at cold nights. The nights he would spend sitting on the roof of Hogwarts, smoking, thinking. Those were the nights his insides burned the most. His lungs from the cigarettes, his heart from all the pain he had to go through.
With a flick of his wand, Harry got the fire going as even though it was summer, it was a very cold, wet, and stormy summer. There had been only a few days of blistering sunshine before the clouds had surrounded England and poured down. Not that Harry minded, he loved the rain.
“How’s life working for the Malfoy’s?” a familiar voice asked. Turning round, Harry saw Blaise Zabini in front of him. He was tall, he seemed taller now than at Hogwarts.
“Things are different now, Harry,” said Malfoy calmly, staring at his hands.
Harry heard, before the light faded.
“We have that though, don’t we?” said Harry, suddenly lost in thought. “Remember during the battle? He stopped me from being turned over to the Dark Lord, then I stopped him from burning in the room of requirement.”
Every now and then Malfoy would look over at Harry, who seemed to be intently watching the water which was sparkling in the sun. The small cut was still visible on Harry’s cheek, he wasn’t allowed to use any healing potion on Harry, and it hurt Malfoy to see him injured. Sometimes he’d look at Harry and see the eleven-year-old boy whom he’d desperately wanted to befriend, and sometimes he’d see the boy who he believed had destroyed his life.
“I’ll get a few things out. The chest is bound by a blood curse, so if you need anything from it, please ask me first. I don’t want to accidentally harm you,” said Draco as he walked over to the chest. He pulled some letters out, and what looked like different colours of ribbon.
The two had moved into a manor of their own, much smaller than the one Draco had grew up in, but still much larger than anywhere Harry had ever thought he’d end up. Every Friday night, they invited over all of the Weasleys, including Molly, Arthur and George, for a dinner before the weekend began.
“Right,” Malfoy looked back down at the papers he was signing. “Sorry to hear that, Potter.”
Malfoy was now staring at Harry, arms folded, something in his one hand that Harry couldn’t see. He didn’t know how long Malfoy had been watching him, he hadn’t taken any notice.
“Sit,” said Harry, gently taking one of his pale hands and slowly leading Draco over to the table. Sighing in a pretence of being annoyed, Draco sat and stared at the teacup. Harry sat opposite him and watched.
“Oh, my darling,” said Narcissa softly, running her fingers through his messy blonde hair. “You’re being so strong. Has Mr Potter been taking care of you?”
“Harry,” called Ron from behind them. “I need your help with George.”
“What are you expecting us to do with this information?” asked Mr Weasley, a frown creasing his already wrinkled forehead.
“I’ll cast a protection,” Mr Weasley said, rising up from his chair with a grunt, “you two eat some breakfast. Draco looks like he needs it.” Chuckling to himself, Mr Weasley hobbled out of the door. Mrs Weasley ushered them both to the table. The fact that neither of the parents seemed bothered of his presence, and instead just treated him as a friend, made Draco feel safe.
“That constellation. It’s the constellation I’m named after,” explained Malfoy quietly. “Mother loves this constellation. It’s named after a dragon. Mother named me after it.”
“Oh, I think you are,” the one spat, grabbing Draco by the neck and slamming him against the cold brick wall. He heard his head smack against the brickwork, and he groaned as the pain shot through him.
“Yes, you did. You know you did. I’m sick of it, Malfoy, sometimes I feel like you don’t value my feelings over yours. What about when I’m scared? When I watch Lucius walk around with that cane, afraid he’s going to beat me up again like he has done?”
“I can’t do anything, mum,” said Draco in a quiet, child-like voice.
Harry’s eyes quickly darted to the side, his breath caught in his throat. He braced himself to see Draco lying there, cold, stiff, just as he had seen so many bodies during the battle.
“Merlin, Potter, you got soppy,” mumbled Draco, opening one eye and shooting Harry a small grin.
The door swung open to Borgin and Burkes, knocking Draco out of his thoughts. There he saw Caractacus Burke stood behind the counter, a grin slowly seeping across his face as Caractacus saw his regular seller.
Malfoy stirred but didn’t wake, his eyes closed tighter, and his eyebrows furrowed.
Malfoy had gotten angry once again at his father, but this time for not allowing Harry to be his bodyguard anymore. Malfoy was now too scared to leave the manor, in case those men were around waiting for him.
Harry watched out the window, looking at the people who were walking past. It was starting to liven up a bit now, there were families walking together, businessmen with their briefcases rushing by, mothers with pushchairs having a leisurely stroll. Harry enjoyed people watching, especially muggles. Their lives were so much simpler than Harry’s, they’d never understand what he had been through, what he was still going through. Their worries would be what shoes to wear, or how much money they could spend without going into their overdraft. Of course Harry knew they had bigger worries than that, but even those seemed so miniscule to what Harry had been through.
Harry was back in the small room that he had began his time at the manor in. Dark, dreary, and consistently reminding him of the cupboard under the stairs. Having to share bathrooms with the other butlers. The perks, though, were that Ron’s room was only down the hall, and now they snuck out to visit each other every night like they had used to.
“That’s beautiful,” said Harry softly, staring at the stars in the sky. “They’re twinkling. It’s like they know you’re talking about them.”
After some moments of reflection on the past year, Harry finally decided to get up to make some food. There was little effort left in him from the long journey home, travelling from the top of the country to the very bottom. Harry didn’t mind taking the Hogwarts train rather than apparating home. It was nostalgic to him, sitting in those same carriages he sat in with Hermione and Ron for the first time fourteen years ago. He would make his way through the carriages of the train, chatting to any student that said hello to him. He truly loved being a professor at Hogwarts.
They had moved out of Malfoy manor, has there were too many memories lingering there. The last thing Draco did before officially leaving the manor, was step back into the dining room for the first time.
“Don’t touch it with your bare hands,” instructed Malfoy, handing Mr Borgin the cloth. “It’s cursed.”
As the two were sitting on the bank of the loch, there was suddenly a loud clash coming from the sky. Only a moment before it had been sunny, but now dark grey clouds quickly rolled in overhead.
“Could you make me a cup of tea, I’m very busy with my work,” instructed Malfoy. For a few moments Harry stood there, confused, before heading to the teapot and tapping it with his wand. He was glad he could have his wand as opposed to the other butlers, it certainly made making cups of teas much easier. After the tea had boiled, Harry poured a cup for Malfoy, watching him closely, unsure what was going to happen next. But, to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy just sipped the tea and continued scribbling with his quill.
It didn’t take long for the topic to become uncomfortable.
“That’s a shame. Keep me updated, please. Potter,” Malfoy turned and started to walk towards the hallways. Ron and Harry shared a very confused look to each other before Harry rushed to catch up to Malfoy. He admired the way Malfoy would glide along the floor, his robes moving freely around his body. His movements were so swift, so gentle. Once again Harry noticed his confident walk, staring straight forward, chin raised, just like always. He recognised where they were heading, back into that basement room that had all those strange artefacts.
“I know,” said Harry with a gentle tone, holding him even closer, if it was possible. The two walked through the manor corridors, Malfoy now clinging onto Harry, relying on him for support. The events of last night had completely tired him out, especially his conversation with Blaise, and the alcohol that resided in his body definitely did not help.
The thought made Harry’s heart lurch, and without thinking beforehand, he grabbed onto Malfoy’s hand.
“Patronus? Didn’t you get taught that already?”
“Fine,” said Harry and folded his arms, staring at the cup of tea in front of him. After a few moments of silence, he picked it up and took a sip, sighing into the cup. “I’m sorry. I’m very hungover.”
“Ginny won’t be coming today,” Mrs Weasley told Harry nonchalantly, not even looking at him. “Did Ron tell you?”
Shaking his head, Harry lay back down in the bed. Maybe it was George trying to get his attention again. He’d been doing that, especially with some old inventions of his and Fred’s to try and entice Harry out of the room to have fun.
“Ginny!” He got up from his seat and rushed over, wrapping his arms around her as a greeting. They held in an embrace for a few moments, Harry’s arms able to wrap all the way around her small figure. Ginny and Harry had been together for a while before their relationship ended. It didn’t work out between them, they both got invested in work and Harry realised something big about himself during their relationship. So, naturally, they ended things, and have been great friends ever since.
“Harry?” they both said in unison, with the same confused tone.
“Why would they be?”
The man had a protection spell cast on him, ensuring he wasn’t to be seen until he undid it.
Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks once he had approached Harry, who’s vision was now going blurry from the pain. For a few moments, Malfoy was silent, just watching Harry who refused to look at him.
“I’m sorry, Draco, but you have to,” shaking her head, Narcissa continued, “the ministry is nearly done with sorting out everything to do with your father. But the problem lies, they have no one to take over his post. They asked for you.”
“No, he is to stay here and guard the office,” huffed Malfoy. Harry followed him. It wasn’t often Malfoy left his office during the day, unless it were for dinner, and it was odd he had left Ron there. Usually he’d lock up the office, put an anti-unlocking charm on it. There was something in there that Malfoy seriously didn’t want anyone to see, and Harry desperately wanted to find out.
“Get the fuck out of my sight, Potter. I don’t want to see you for the rest of the day.”
“Why do you keep asking questions?” Shaking his head, Malfoy pulled one of the drawers from the bookshelf and started fiddling around with stuff inside. “This is not on your payroll.”
Harry heard the door open and he looked up, recognising the two figures who walked in. Malfoy and Astoria. Today Malfoy was dressed in a black turtleneck, paired with a blazer. Astoria looked graceful in a long floral dress, her hair golden brown hair hung loosely down her back, a style which Harry never saw her in. When Astoria noticed them, Harry saw her tug Malfoy’s arm and they made their way over.
“Come in, Mrs Malfoy,” said Harry as he stepped aside from the door. Narcissa walked in slowly, her long black dress flowing elegantly behind her.
He was careful handling it, ensuring the contraption didn’t get set off, and slowly he placed it into a small box. Giving his wand a flick, he silently used the shrinking charm and slipped the now tiny box into the pocket of his dark green robes. Moving quickly, he walked out of the basement and closed the doors, casting alohomora and ensuring the doors were definitely locked before gliding away.
Shaking his head, Harry spun around quickly on his heel and traipsed off. He shouldn’t be feeling like that, he was Malfoy’s
The morning seemed to go from bad to worse, as Harry didn’t get his cue early enough. He moved last, tripped on his own feet, then spilled water onto the table. Lucius, of course, was furious and got up to punish Harry, grabbing him by the collar and taking him to a separate room. The same thing happened as before, right on the same cheek, which wasn’t fully healed.
“You’re such a child,” he retorted as Harry walked in.
Before he decided to live a life hidden from the Malfoys.
A wolf. Draco’s patronus was a wolf.
“How are you getting on?” asked Ron, leaning his elbows on the table. Harry could tell he was so happy to see his brother, there was an excited gleam in his eyes, his lips hadn’t dropped from the smile he’d put on since they entered the room.
“We know,” said Ron, shuffling awkwardly. The three best friends knew Harry was now in danger. If he didn’t return, he could be captured and tortured. Yet, if he did return, he would be tortured for leaving. It was a losing battle, one that Harry felt he didn’t have the strength for. Not now. Not anymore. He’d already battled once in his life, had to hide from everyone and everything.
“Why not? I could do with the company.” Harry managed to clamber onto the boat, his head spinning as he did. It was lovely inside, like a little home. There was a little table and some chairs, a kitchen area and a sofa.
“What’s wrong, Potter? You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” responded Malfoy with a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
“She wasn’t rude,” assured Harry, “you’re both more than welcome to join us.” Malfoy just nodded in response.
“It doesn’t matter,” responded Harry, finally looking over at Ron with a stern expression. “Don’t ask questions.”
“Thank you,” both Pansy and Theo nodded before entering the room.
“I just hope he doesn’t have any nightmares tonight,” Harry nearly whispered.
Hermione had done all she could to help the situation, even after all the years of torment Draco put her in during Hogwarts. Every morning she would make Draco and Harry a cup of tea and a crumpet, even if Draco didn’t eat it, which happened most mornings. For the few moments Draco went to use the bathroom, Hermione would quickly use her wand to change his bedsheets, so he would always sleep in something clean.
“Wait,” whispered Malfoy. Turning back around, Harry looked at him, noticing how small he currently looked.
Draco sat there for a while, spitting out the blood that pooled in his mouth every now and then. He wasn’t sure whether he would be able to apparate home, his whole body felt weak, his mind numb. He was fighting unconsciousness, his eyelids drooping every so often, to which he would snap them open again. At this point, he felt as though he couldn’t find a reason to go home. His father would be furious he allowed himself to be so weak, his mother would get upset with his father for being so hard on her son. There seemed to be so little Draco wanted to be around for, maybe, he thought, he should just let himself stay here and deteriorate.
“It’s a hard one to relive,” admitted Harry, shaking his head, “it’s the last time I saw my family.”
As Draco walked out of the shop, shoving the money into his pocket, he felt someone following him. For a while, he continued on, chin up, but moving quicker than he usual pace. When the feeling didn’t subside, Draco turned into a deserted alley and spun round, facing the stalker.
“Feel better now?” asked Malfoy, looking at Harry who was lay next to him. For a moment, Harry stared into his grey eyes. They were alive, like the day of the storm, they were happy and twinkled in the dim light. It was as though they didn’t need any light to brighten them, Malfoy was doing that all on his own, especially as he gazed at Harry.
“Yes,” answered Harry, trying his hardest not to look down at the body that stood in front of him, trying to keep eye contact.
“You repeat any of that to anyone, and you’ll be sent straight to the workhouses, Potter,” he hissed, before turning on his heel and walking out of the door, leaving Harry stood there in shock.
He placed the book back down on the bedside table, not wanting to bring those memories with him. Solemnly, he continued to grab a few important items, one being the photo album that Hagrid had given him in his first year of Hogwarts, and then he used a shrinking charm on the bag.
“Quite,” responded Harry, sitting on one of the visitor chairs Malfoy had for when he held meetings. “After everything we’ve been through, I’m glad you feel comfortable enough to open up to me.”
“Hullo,” answered Draco.
you?” asked Hermione, the shock obvious in her voice.
Suddenly they were in the manor. Draco knew it was dinner time, so it would be easy to find Lucius. Only the day before, Draco had managed to muster all his strength to put a spell on the manor, making it physically impossible for Lucius to disapparate. Just like at Hogwarts.
Mrs Weasley paused for a moment. “Get inside.”
Harry and Malfoy had apparated back to the manor, soaking wet, getting rainwater all over the shiny black floors. For the first time since Harry had been working there, Malfoy didn’t seem to care. The storm had left him in some sort of euphoria.
“No, I get it. Salazar, at sixteen I was attempting to kill my headmaster for the Dark Lord so he didn’t murder my parents. Everything was so strict with my family, I had to follow my father’s rules, think like him, act like him, look like him,” Malfoy took a sip of his cappuccino. His eyes seemed to reflect his past and Harry thought it looked as though his whole life was flashing before him. And for Malfoy, it was. Suddenly he was back on the astronomy tower, wand raised at Albus Dumbledore, the fear making his hand shake.
“You’re using me, aren’t you?”
And then, Lucius struck Harry. Hard, with the silver snake head that sat at the top of his cane. The force knocked Harry to the ground and Lucius proceeded to beat him, kicking him in the ribs over and over, before kicking him once in the face.
“Yeah. Just seeing it go into the sky like that, makes me think about all the things in life Fred’s missing.”
He looked at the wolf one last time, a lump in his throat, as he nodded. The wolf faded. Harry was alone. He didn’t know whether Draco would be able to build up the strength to produce a full body patronus, which was exactly what Harry needed in order to find him.
(Trigger Warning: mentions of abuse.)
Harry looked down at the chunk of wood in his hand. It was heavy, as he remembered. Holding it felt warm in his hand, it felt right. The wand had reacted to him the same way Harry’s personal wand had.
The conversation flowed easily, and every now and then Draco would chime in. This warmed Harry’s heart, realising how comfortable Draco must now feel with the Weasleys. Though he knew it was going to be a tough few months, having to help Draco through the grief of losing Astoria, he felt positive. Times were changing, things were getting better. Things were going to be so much better.
“What is it?” asked Ron, grabbing onto his fork and shoving the food in his mouth.
“Potter,” called Malfoy as Harry had started to head towards the door.
“That’s okay,” said Harry, “it doesn’t really bother me anymore.”
“I’m sorry for my wife’s rudeness,” said Malfoy after a few moments of silence, ensuring he didn’t look at Harry.
It had been a tough year at Hogwarts. Being a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor took its toll on Harry each year, but he always looked forward to going back and teaching brand new faces. That was the most exciting part.
Harry always admired how Malfoy would just walk away, expecting whoever was with him to follow. And, of course, they always did. There was something so alluring about him, Harry found himself wanting to be around Malfoy more and more these days. He was exciting, full of surprises, but even their silences together felt comforting to Harry.
“It’s unsafe,” began Mrs Weasley, before Harry made an entrance into the room. He knew he shouldn’t exit the attic, but hearing his best friends beg Mrs Weasley just to know he’s safe made him take the risk.
Malfoy swallowed, “I am.”
“It’s my job,” said Harry, holding out his arm to give Malfoy his wand back.
The only time he had truly felt seen, felt understood, was with Draco. Those few moments where they would speak about the past, almost comparing their experiences, brought comfort to him. Draco had been through so much more than Harry had realised during his Hogwarts years. The mental torture he had experienced from having Voldemort use the manor as his grounds followed him through to adulthood, leaving him with nightly terrors. There were a few times Harry had walked past a room with him and Draco had frozen, just for a few seconds, before continuing. There were rooms Draco refused to even enter, and Harry suspected they were rooms that had been used to torture witches and wizards.
“How in Merlin did you manage this?” asked Mr Weasley.
“Hermione,” said Harry with a lump in his throat. Feeling her embrace comforted him, seeing Hermione and Ron made him feel emotional. It had felt like an eternity since he last spoke to them.
“It’s worth a read through the whole thing,” explained Draco as Mrs Weasley turned to the next page. “I supplied as much proof as I could.”
“200 Galleons,” said Mr Borgin and Harry nearly choked. Nodding, Malfoy accepted that offer with no questions, and Mr Borgin handed him the money after very carefully, and slowly, counting it. The two men left the shop.
Harry poured a glass of water for Draco and placed it beside them before giving his back another gentle rub, then walked away to allow them some privacy. Harry knew from experience how comforting Mrs Weasley’s hugs could be. Her grasp was always warm and tight, and for those few moments it felt as if nothing could harm you.
“Oh, sorry,” said Harry sheepishly, “I was just heading to the kitchen.”
But it all became too much. Everything with George, Lucius beating him, feeling weak. Even the way Malfoy watched him made him upset. Tears fell down from Harry’s eyes and he felt his ears redden, he couldn’t believe he was crying in front of Draco Malfoy.
“I’m sorry,” he said after a moment’s silence. “Today isn’t a good day.”
“You needed me.”
Now working as a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Harry couldn’t wait until Scorpius turned eleven, and he could teach his own son.
“So? Every day is different. You can’t hide in here forever just because of a few wizards.”
“I’ll go,” said Narcissa softly, then looked over to Harry, “if you begin separating my threads, that would be lovely,” she instructed before walking out the door Malfoy had left through. After a moment, Astoria stood up and motioned to Hermione and another half-blood named Beatrice, to follow her. Hermione shot Harry and Ron a sad glance, before rushing after the elegant figure who seemed to float out of the room.
“You’ve been having to deal with this on your own?” Harry nodded. “Oh, you poor thing,” Mrs Weasley squeezed his hand tighter.
“I have decided who I want to take over the ministry,” said Draco with a bold voice, “if they will accept the position.”
“Nothing was going on,” responded Harry abruptly, sitting up properly now. “We were just having fun.”
Before now, he had never felt complete.
“Mrs Hermione Weasley,” said Draco, looking over to the small woman who stood next to her husband. Her face was shocked, full lips in the shape of an o. She wasn’t expecting it. And by the gasping response of the room, neither was anyone else.
They managed to make their way back to the office, where Ron stood up tall when he saw them, but instantly had a face of confusion.
“You don’t realise how much I needed to say it,” chuckled Malfoy, giving him a small nod. “I’ll see you soon, Potter,” he said, before opening the door and walking out of Harry’s room without looking back, leaving Harry alone to sit and digest the day's events.
And then I come, Draco, with my eyes shut tightly, because if they weren’t I’d start to cry and feel even more pathetic than I already do.
. You locked yourself in the bedroom and I fell asleep on the couch waiting for you. The truth is I didn’t mind. At the time the thought of you existing on the other side of the threshold was enough for me. At dawn, you were already a warm and heavy-limbed ivy around me, with your stubborn arms and your hot breath in my neck. You couldn’t even make it through the night. You never stayed mad for long. I know that now.
Harry debates messing around with poor wasted Seamus, but then decides against it. Being honest won’t hurt anybody right now. Seamus probably won’t even remember talking to Harry. “No. He’s not here right now,” he says.
Harry’s working his wet and relaxed muscle even more pliant, his glasses getting all crooked again, moving onto his forehead, so Draco gently takes them off and blindly tries to place them somewhere on the bedside table, but he misses it and they fall onto the carpet instead.  He’s running a hand through Harry’s unruly curls, getting the sweaty strands out of his eyes and Harry moans like it’s the best thing in the world. He’s moaning all the time actually, now that Draco thinks about it. Which is funny considering that he’s not the one being pleasured, but it seems that he’s getting just as much from this as Draco is and that’s just beautiful – that making Draco feel like this has such an enormous effect on Harry.
and no matter how good Blaise is, how many
I’ve been writing a lot of letters to you lately, but never sending any of them. I don’t know what has changed, what makes this one different, but I think I’ll send it.
He props himself on an elbow next to Draco’s draped form and lets his hand smooth out Draco’s hair.
Draco doesn’t respond. He’s sitting on top of the desk still, his lanky legs dangling from it. He has his thinking face on. It’s the one that’s slightly pouty, with scrunched up white eyebrows and gentle creases between them. Harry want to straighten them with his thumb. He kisses Draco’s forehead instead.
red Gryffindor tie.
Stop. Stop thinking about Ginny. Jesus.
“Harry,” Draco croaks out, when Harry is about to put his mouth to use again. “Will you fuck me?
Maybe you’ve gotten yourself locked behind
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell us,” Hermione says scornfully. “Who is he?”
“You know what thing,” Draco murmurs. His lips brush the middle of Harry’s palm in the lightest of motions and tingles travel from it and spread onto the rest of Harry’s body.
“You’re not saying anything, because you know I’m right,” Harry says. He’s everywhere. A second ago he was kissing Draco’s face, now he’s grazing his ear shell with his teeth and whispering dirtily into it. “I’m gonna fuck you so good baby.”
He realizes now why everyone’s been looking at him weirdly all day. He was sure people were staring at him more than the usual amount, but he just brushed it off as being paranoid. Dean even asked him “if he was finally getting some” and now Harry can finally understands why.
She turns to look at Ron and he nods slowly.
Right now though, Draco just hums tiredly again. “Do that thing,” he croaks out, barely audible.
,” Draco repeats louder and more serious, “Then no.”
Sundays are the best and all Draco can think to respond is “Let’s.”
“That good?” he asks again for the thousandth time and Draco just doesn’t get how in Merlin’s name he could think something like this isn’t good.
I sleep on the couch instead. It’s reminiscent of that one time before. Do you remember? We were drunk and you wouldn’t let me kiss you, I kept missing your mouth. You said I called you by the wrong name, but I was just calling you
- I can’t tell him right now. He is too vulnerable, I will only hurt Harry, make it worse. He doesn’t need to question our relationship right now.
- You don’t know what to wear, right?
- Wait. No way!
Why is Draco becoming more punk with every chapter? also, I am not a smoker, so the smoking scene is based only on the things I read on the internet ;w;
Draco smiled. Harry was so funny when he was talking about muggle stuff.
Draco walked away, heading to his dorm to change into different clothes. He actually didn’t know what to wear, so that was going to be a problem.
- So, Harry, I found out that there are wizard therapy sessions for those, who suffered after the war. They are held in St. Mungo’s. I will leave you to think about it and I will come back tomorrow, okay?
- Uhh, come in.
- Any funny stories about scars?
- There you go. Let’s tuck you in and I’ll go look for Pomfrey.
he wouldn’t need go to the great hall every day. That would be great.
She smiled. Having a pierced ear really suited him. If she was straight she might have even developed a crush on Malfoy. Oh how mad would Ron get! She giggled at the thought.
- So do you have a piercing gun or I will have to do it with a needle?
Harry soon fell asleep again. Draco made sure, that Harry’s forehead wasn’t hot from the temperature anymore. He found a book to read and was trying not to fall asleep while reading the novel and holding Harry’s hand.
- So, we just walk back to Hogwarts now? - Draco asked.
- Why are you on the floor, Potter?
- That’s Neville, don’t mind him, he’s just been studying too much lately and that is how he usually falls asleep.
She left the homework for the next day and was already leaving when Malfoy’s voice stopped her.
- Draco, do you really like him?
- Draco? What happened? Is it an emergency?
- I, uhh.. Sixth year? I don’t know, maybe earlier. I always felt a bit different but at first I thought it was how being a pureblood felt like. Eventually I realised I was just gay.- He let out a small chuckle at the end.
- Well, before this year? No. Right now? I am very close to Granger. She did pierce my ear after all, that is a serious level of trust.
- Oh, thanks.
Harry was sad all the time. He wasn’t upset about anything in particular, he was just sad. He wasn’t crying or whining. He was only blankly starting at the wall or the ceiling, feeling empty inside. He couldn’t keep his attention on anything for more than five minutes, so books didn’t help him and lessons were forgotten about.
- Well, just a little one.
Hermione and Ron came as soon as they woke up. They entered the room, seeing both of the boys asleep, Harry clinging to Draco’s hand. Hermione smiled at them and put her hand on Ron’s shoulder, telling him they should leave.
Draco Opened his eyes for a bit and saw Hermione’s blushed cheeks. She felt a bit uncomfortable after the mentioning of Pansy.
She found Malfoy sitting on the bed, holding a small box in his hands.
Harry smiled. He knew Bloodwitch was Malfoy’s favorite band, he knew they were playing in Hogesmeade this evening. And he knew that the tickets were sold out. Though he still managed to get two tickets for them.
Harry came closer to him. He sat down on the wooden floor of the balcony, watching Draco’s movements. They were repetitive. Breathing in and breathing out, producing light clouds of smoke, over and over again. Harry didn’t mind it, though. They sat in silence for a while and then, the scarred boy started speaking.
Harry noticed that Malfoy’s hair was different. It wasn’t long and slicked back like the years before. The hair on top was parted in the middle, falling behind his ears and all of the remaining was buzzed off. Harry liked that kind of hairstyle much more than the long one. It suited Malfoy better.
- You said you were going to a club in Hogesmeade, right?
- No, no, no. It’s not you. - Harry breathed out heavily. - Professor Snape was killed here, right in front of me.
They left, Hermione judging Ron and Ron judging Draco. Malfoy went back into the room, almost falling asleep but fighting back the need of rest. No, he couldn’t he needed to take care off Harry… Draco’s eyes closed, mind drifting off to sleep.
- It’s great. You should go, it will help you be normal again.
Hermione looked at him with interest, not saying a word. She didn’t realise how much has Draco changed. It wasn’t only how he looked like but it was like a whole new person was standing in front of her.
Malfoy giggled a bit and playfully hit her shoulder.
They sat like this for a while, Draco saying calming words and Harry softly sobbing into his shoulder. When Potter pulled back from the hug Malfoy was ready for anything but not Potter’s red eyes. They were full of pain and sadness, it was awful seeing him like this.
- What a shame, it would be interesting to know. Next question. What was the best phrase you overheard?
- Well, I’m Harry Potter, I can do anything.
Harry stood up from the floor, threw on a hoodie, just the closest one that was laying on the floor, and walked out of his room.
- Okay, back to the questions. Have you ever had a best friend?
Malfoy heard a quiet sob. He slowly approached Harry, who was laying on the floor with Draco’s notes in his hands. It was the first time Harry has cried since the war. He didn’t know why but it felt painful and relieving at the same time. Tears felt too cold for his heated cheeks. They felt like they were leaving burn marks.
- Well, I still have an hour until Harry comes to pick me up. Do you want to stay and talk?
- Black or pink.
Hermione paused and hugged the boy.
Did I just make a cliffhanger?
Hermione took the piercing gun in her hand and put the needle in. She felt Malfoy tightening up a bit and she stopped to talk to him.
- How long have you been smoking?
- I love that song! Wanna dance?
- So you’re a wintery boy, huh?
- Never smelled it, actually. No one tried to charm me with a strong love potion.
He closed his eyes and breathed out. Hermione was definitely right, he felt less scared now.
Hermione gave Draco a neatly folded pile of clothes and waited for him, while he was changing in the bathroom.
It was hard to talk but Harry managed to spit out a few words.
- Hey, Malfoy!
- Just a little detail.
in this chapter Hermione is just like "i ship it"
Draco stormed out. Harry didn’t know how much time had passed since Malfoy went away. Two days probably? Somewhere deep down he felt guilty for treating Draco like that. But at the same time he couldn’t do anything with it.
The boy nodded and did as he was told. his hand were shaking a bit. Maybe from the excitement, maybe he was scared. He heard one of the Hufflepuff girls say that it hurt so much when she pierced her ears, Draco hoped he would at least still have his ear after Granger pierced him.
Draco panicked. ‘What should I do??’ - he thought - ‘Is it normal that he’s making noises? Should I call Granger??’
Malfoy put out his cigarette and vanished it with his wand. He wasn’t looking at Potter. He was afraid that the boy would understand everything by looking in his eyes.
‘What the hell?’- Malfoy thought - ‘eight years she hadn’t gone to a drugstore and now was the best time she picked?’
- That seems quite reasonable.
Draco wanted to stay so bad, but he knew he had to leave Harry to think. He took his hand away from Harry’s and stood up. Draco walked out of the room and went to the library. It became his second favorite place this year, always so peaceful and quiet. Except those awful sixth graders. Always kissing by the back shelves. Ugh.
“It’s alright” - he thought “Potter’s going through something. He will try sooner or later.”
A new song started playing and suddenly Draco’s eyes lit up, he finished his drink, and jumped up from his chair. He held out his hand, offering it to Harry.
- What is your favorite weather?
- He needs rest and after his temperature is gone, some warm food. Malfoy, can you watch him tonight? If he gets any worse, send me a patronus.
Malfoy hesitated a bit and then started talking, he looked uncomfortable while he was speaking and Hermione tried to stop him but he continued.
- Uhh, Granger-
Draco sat next to him and hugged him. He knows how important it is to be with Harry right now, holding him, comforting him. He faces Potter and looks him in the eyes, slightly holding him by the shoulders.
- You’re such a klutz!
Harry looked in the mirror for the first time after leaving his room. The hoodie on him was dark green with a big ’S’
The boy didn’t say anything for a few seconds. Then, he nodded.
- As much as I find Hermione attractive, we’re both too gay to date each other.
The notes were all written with neat handwriting and Harry enjoyed reading them, even though they didn’t help. “He doesn’t do anything. I don’t know why I’m still trying.” - Draco thought.
- Guys, a little more quiet? - Malfoy asked.
- I know what you’re doing here, Malfoy and you should stop it. You know that your parents won’t allow it and you shouldn’t start dating if you can’t keep it up.
This came out a bit smol but I am already working on the next chapter so it will come out soon. Make sure to leave me a comment if you liked it! Special thanks to VenusWulf for leaving such a positive comment, it really motivates me.
Draco looked at him with surprise. He really didn’t know what happened and why was Potter suddenly mad at him.
Ron was alone in his room, though the mess on the floor showed, that he wasn’t the only one living there. There were empty mugs, smelly clothes and… something that was moving?
- So, I’ll come by your room somewhere at ten, ok?
- Hey, you okay?
Hermione looked at him and smiled. She muttered ‘great job’ to herself and made a mental note to eat some pancakes later, as a reward.
Draco hurried to get to the hospital wing, bumping into people, not bothering to say sorry. Right now helping Harry was the only thing he thought about.
Harry’s breathing rhythm was coming back to normal, his eyes were not as red as before. Suddenly he felt cold. He started shaking a bit, which Draco noticed.
He opened the door and peeked out. Then, he fully entered the room. He was wearing a white shirt with two first buttons undone, a black tie hanging loose around his neck, and a pair of black trousers. He spun around to give Granger a full look.
Draco comes to Harry everyday. He helps him with studying and calms him when Harry feels weird. Malfoy makes sure Harry eats properly though it isn’t easy. They lay together on the floor and talk about what’s on their mind. They both find it relaxing.
“It would probably help him to interact with other people.” - Hermione thought - “He hasn’t been eating, sleeping or feeling anything for months now. Maybe Draco will help him somehow.”
- It will, I promise, just don’t take yourself away from me.
- Here, have my jacket, it’s warm and big, so you can wrap yourself in it.
- Hey. - Harry was too weak to say anything longer.
Hermione’s face became even more pink.
- Ever since Lucius has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban and Mother ran off to Italy. It’s a coping mechanism, a bad addiction based on past trauma. Pansy is drinking, Hermione is burying herself in books, you’re depressed, I’m smoking. It’s all just a coping mechanism.
- Harry can get that from our friendship. I don’t want to mess it up.
Someone knocked at the door. It opened with a slight creek and then Harry heard the sound of someone stepping in.
- It’s alright. Focus on me. Don’t think about other things. Focus.
- Oh, sorry, I thought you liked wintery things.
- A what?
- No. Uhh, just follow me.
- Have you ever seen a movie?
Harry invites Draco to a concert. Basically just a casual chapter, no drama (almost).
Draco nodded and went away, drifting off to sleep right after crawling into his bed.
Harry stopped for a second to think what would he like to ask. So many questions were filling his head but he didn’t want to scare Draco away. Better start with something simple.
- Well, I think it’s more of a hangout.
- You know, I had a dream today, I was flying at night and it started snowing.
Harry laughed as Draco practically jumped on him, embracing the boy in a hug.
- Yeah, thanks for taking care of me.
He understood everything Malfoy was saying but he couldn’t recall anything even if he tried. The notes didn’t help either, it was like his mind refused to think.
- I’m sorry about what I said the day before. I... I understand what you are going through, the war influenced you the most. I am really sorry.
- Okay.
Harry raised his eyebrows and looked at Hermione with pure confusion.
- That’s enough Potter! I have been trying to save your grades for almost a month now and you still haven’t done anything! Why can’t you just try?
They were sitting silent for a moment. In the silence a few words escaped from his lips. He didn’t know how it happened, he was thinking of it and somehow he just asked Draco.
Hermione smiled and continued wiping Draco’s ear with a disinfecting wipe she just casted.
- Sorry, Ron was just being a complete moron. Would you like us to watch over Harry or do you want to stay with him?
- That is because it’s his name. And we are friends with him.
Harry was always tired. Throughout the day he was yawning and almost falling asleep but when he reached his bed, he couldn’t sleep. Sometimes there was too much thoughts in his head to sleep. Sometimes his head was too empty to sleep. Usually he would drift off to asleep only in the early morning, leaving him with two-three hours of rest. It wasn’t good for him but he didn’t care. It was always weird to lay in bed all alone, the only one hugging him was the hands of the cold winter nights.
She fixed the t-shirt that she crumpled, while hugging Malfoy. He was so precious, only thinking about how Harry would feel. It would do him bad eventually, so Draco must be aware of his own feelings too.
The redhead was just starring with horror on Harry’s hoodie. It was like there was a spider sitting on it, trying to attack Ron.
- Draco, are you going to tell him?
(See the end of the chapter for
- Umm... Draco, have you heard our conversation with Ron this morning?
- It’s fine.
1. If you came back for the second chapter, I edited the first one, so make sure you read the changed version.
Hermione frowned. Draco would probably be a great boyfriend. Yeah, she could imagine the two boys spending days together, going on dates. She could trust Harry to the blonde.
- A panic attack.
- Draco, if you ever want to discuss anything, just let me know, okay?
Draco changed again and showed the next outfit to Hermione.
A grey cloud of smoke escaped Draco’s thin lips before he answered.
- Okay, okay, I give up. I’m afraid that one you are going to tickle me to death.
Just Malfoy and Hermione bonding.
- When did you know that you were... umm... gay?
Ron said it like it was okay but Harry had never seen Neville like that. How much has changed since the last time he was living consciously and actually understanding what was happening around him. Without Draco he would have still been like that. Luckily, everything has changed after that time when he was sick. Harry started feeling alive again, like he was not just a ghost in Harry Potter’s body. How relieving it was to be living again.
- Do you like me?
The view was amazing. The sky was starting to get a bit lighter, showing that it was almost sunrise. Even though it was almost morning, all the stars could still be seen and the moon was shining bright, too. There were some little, puffy clouds. They were dark purple, looking like the most soft thing ever. It would be so great to just lie down in those soft clouds, drown in them, cuddling each other, slowly falling asleep.
Draco noticed something else laying next to Harry on the floor. It was a little knife, the one muggles use to sharpen their pencils. He took it and put it in his back pocket. No, Draco couldn’t let Harry hurt himself. Malfoy wanted to scream at Potter for being so stupid and thinking the sharp object could help him somehow but Draco knew that it would only make things worse.
- Rain! It’s kinda sad but at the same time very nice and comforting. And yours?
They opened the box and took out the piercing gun. It was white but so used that it turned grey, there were some odd looking stains that Hermione decided to ignore. The machine looked quite scary even without the stains, there was also a needle inside the box, luckily, it was brand new and still in its original package. She took a small box from Malfoy’s hands. It was a little earring. The small piece of jewellery was round and flat, completely black.
They both laughed, then Draco pointed to a box on his bed table. It was quite creased and look a bit dirty. Looked like half of Hogwarts used before it got to Draco but it was the only one they had.
Malfoy turned to Harry and looked at him with confusion.
Harry tightened his grip around Malfoy’s hand and entered the house, without saying anything. It was hard for him to be here after everything that happened. He gulped and squeezed Draco’s hand tighter. Awful flashbacks were flooding his mind, making it impossible for Harry to think straight. The only thing holding him from falling to the floor and starting crying was Malfoy’s cold hand.
- Harry, you have visitor.
- Bring… Draco…. Please.
At Pomfrey’s cabinet a signed hanged from the door knob. “Gone off to take potions, will be back on Friday”
- I should let you know that It’s fine with me if you like Harry. Not that you need my permission to date him, I just wanted to say it to you.
She nodded.
- Draco found therapy for me. I am thinking about going.
Malfoy sat down next to Harry, took the notes from his hands and wrapped both his arms around him making it easy for the boy to cry on his shoulder.
The solution came to him when he was already taking out his wand for a patronus. Malfoy took Harry’s hand and locked it with his own. The sick boy immediately relaxed and the slight crease between his brows vanished. Draco let out a sigh. ‘Didn’t know it was this easy’ - he thought.
- Hey. - Draco was too tired from guarding Harry to say anything longer.
Malfoy screamed and jumped up a bit. His right ear was red but still on its place. He ran to the mirror in his bathroom and was quite satisfied with the way he looked like. The earring looked very stylish with his trendy haircut and simple black t-shirt completed the look.
- Good, the temperature is normal and he hasn’t started coughing or anything like that, so he must be alright.
- So, are you two going on a date? Or it’s just a casual hangout between friends?
Oh, no, it definitely wasn't.
This year winter was very cold. It was always freezing outside, though it didn’t snow once. It didn’t snow on Christmas, it didn’t snow on New Year’s Eve. Not once a snowflake fell from the sky. It did rain, though but it wasn’t the same. Rain felt cold and painful for Harry and snow felt happy and comforting.
Potter was soon in bed, covered with a blanket, still shivering. He was feeling worse than ever.
yes, I used the band name from IANOWT but what would trendy/punk/gay Draco listen to, if not this? Anyway, if you are not okay with that just tell me in the comments ;)
He didn’t care. Some people were coming to him every day, most of them he didn’t even know the names of.
- Purple. Everybody thinks it’s green but I truly hate it. Never liked it, had to cope with my dorm being green for six whole years!
Harry started sleeping a bit longer. He even had a dream, a normal one, not a nightmare. He was flying above Hogwarts, staring at the stars at night. Then snow started falling from the sky, Harry breathed in the cold air and felt so calm and relieved. He knew it all wasn’t real but he didn’t want it to end. It would be wonderful to just stay there forever, looking at the stars, snowflakes landing on his shoulders, breathing in chilly air. Even though it felt cold, he didn’t mind it. He woke up feeling calm and kind of safe. Harry couldn’t describe the feeling but it definitely was a good one.
- I thought you were British…
She handed him the next pile.
- What’s the point of laying in bed if one can’t even sleep properly?
- Yeah, okay, that is funny. Would you like to be a girl for one day?
Before Hermione could say anything, the door to Harry’s room opened and the boy who just got called “a bad decision” stuck his head out. He looked very tired but there was a hint of something else in his face. Maybe happiness? Love?
Harry turned back to Ron.
Malfoy spotted Harry and sat down next to him. He gently touched the boy, not to scare him away. After giving Potter a few seconds to get used to his hands, he hugged him.
- Don’t get me wrong. It’s okay if you are gay. But it’s not if you are gay with Malfoy.
- A movie! It’s like a moving picture but a very long one and there are different characters and scenes and they all are talking. We should go see one, in the summer.
- Draco, I don’t know much about you. Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
- A stabbing knife, then.
- It’s just an old habit, you know.
Malfoy was jumping up and down with the crowd, singing along with the words. He was so happy, Harry liked to see him that way. The boy didn’t know any lyrics but he recognised some of the song titles from the vinyls in Draco’s room. The music was quite enjoyable, though it definitely wasn’t something Harry would listen to intentionally.
- Yeah, that’s fine. See you in the evening then.
“Gay with Malfoy?” Harry laughed out loud. Ron on the other hand, looked very serious.
- Oh, no!
Hi, it's currently 20:57 in my country and it's raining so I thought 'why not post a chapter'. The plan is to post three chapters today, so this is not a big one.
There were three of them: a drummer, a singer, who was also playing the guitar, and a guy, who was playing the bass guitar. The singer was a redhead, her short cut hair was growing in every direction, looking very messy but cute on her.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don’t want to see you kissing or hugging, so please tell your boyfriend to stay away from me.
Malfoy opened the book and started reading out loud to Harry, sometimes stopping to explain something. Harry looked away from Malfoy and concentrated on the wall, forgetting there was someone else in the room.
Draco nodded, he was already sitting on the floor next to Harry’s bed. He couldn’t bear seeing him suffer so much. Suddenly he remembered something his mother always did for him, when he was sick. Draco casted towel and a glass of cold water, soaking the cloth in the liquid. He put the towel on Harry’s head, making sure it wouldn’t disturb him. Just as Malfoy had finished, Harry let out a quiet cry.
Everything was quite fine lately. Harry wasn’t having any shaking moments and he even started attending lessons. His first therapy session was in a week but right  Harry had some other plans he was thinking about.
- Uuhh...
- Sure, go ahead.
Harry started shaking a bit and his eyes were filling with tears. Everything seemed to be enormous but at the same it’s like the walls of the small room were closing and pressing against his shoulders. There isn’t enough air for him to breathe in and he gasps for it with his open mouth.
- Thank you soooo much! You are like the best person on earth!
- Now go to your room, you have already done enough, you need sleep.
The girl examined him and thought a few seconds before giving her verdict.
- Well, I changed a lot since the war and I don’t want to be associated with the old Draco. I want to start fresh. I already got rid of the old hairstyle and now I want to pierce my ear.
- Hmm, I gotta think for a second. - Malfoy was quiet for a bit. - Yeah, sure, I love experimenting.
- If you could pick a weapon, what would you pick?
- Of course it is up to me! I’m his friend and if you haven’t noticed, he has been out of his mind lately! He can’t decide for himself right now, he will make bad decisions and then regret them!
- Uhh, snow. I’m always happy when it’s snowing. I feel peaceful when everything is covered in snow.
Oh, Draco loved it here. It was awesome! He grabbed Harry by the wrist and pulled him into the centre of the crowd. They were just in time, the band was starting to play. Everyone turned to the stage, watching the members entering the stairs.
She waved at the boys and smiled when they left. Hermione thought about leaving the room but Draco had so many books in it! “Nah, I’ll stay” - she thought.
Hermione looked at him with confusion. Draco saw it and tried to explain.
- I- I read them, I promise. Just don’t leave me...
Draco changed and by the look on Hermione’s face, he knew this was the one.
But Malfoy did get Harry out of that awful state. Ugh, Harry was miserable back then. He owned that to the Slytherin.
- Oh no, it’s totally my fault, don’t apologise.
Took a bit more time than I expected.
- Harry said to bring you. He is shaking and…
- Hi. I see you woke up. Feeling better?
Harry goes to talk to Ron.
Draco looked up. The windows were closed and the fire was cracking in the fireplace. ‘There must be something wrong with Potter’ - he thought. Malfoy put one arm under Harry’s shoulder and one on the bed, helping him get up.
They walked out of the club to the fresh air. It was a bit cold for an April night. There were no leaves yet, and no signs of spring. It was a weird kind weather. Not a wintery one, not a spring one.
Draco sat down on the little metal fence that was surrounding the balcony. His legs were hanging over it, he shifted his weight onto his hands that were clinging to the black fence. Malfoy reached for his pocket, taking out a cigarette and lit it up with his wand. He inhaled and breathed out the smoke. The action looked so peaceful, calm somehow.
- You go, girl!
Harry felt safe in Draco’s hands. Breathing became easier, things around him felt less weird. Yeah, Draco made him feel better. He wanted to bury himself in Malfoy’s soft chest, wanted to feel his breathing rhythm. That was just friendship, right?
Draco didn’t for an answer and stood up taking Harry with him, finding his way into the center of the crowd. Harry was very shy and confused at first but he got used to it, and was enjoying every moment of it.
- Oh Potter, you are my favorite person in the world right now.
- Yeah, sure.
He guarded Harry all night, changing the towel, making sure it was cold. Only at sunrise, Draco fell asleep, still holding Harry’s hand. He was still worried about Potter in his sleep, hoping he would get better.
She took her books and left, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts. Before going away she got him some pancakes and soup from the kitchen so Harry could eat. He didn’t remember anything beside crying into Malfoy’s shoulder and feeling cold. It was probably all because of the fever. What happened in between him falling asleep and waking up? By the look on Hermione’s face when she talked about Malfoy guarding him he could tell something happened. And she never called him Draco before. That’s very strange.
- What?
- Well, you see, Harry got us tickets to a concert tonight and uhh…
- Draco, if you want to be friends, we need to call each other by our names.
- Yeah, that’s why you are still calling her “Granger” and not Hermione.
- No, no, no. Too casual. Try this one.
- Yeah, sure, that would be great.
- I have a scar on my right knee, I got it because I really wanted a pine cone, that I saw  in the forest but I tripped and fell, tearing off half my knee.
They sat on the bed, legs crossed, all comfy. Hermione liked being friends with Draco. She could tell him everything, gossip with him, and just laugh about different things.
- Forget about the notes, I’m not leaving you. We will go through this together, I promise.
(See the end of the chapter for
- Only by accident. I didn’t see what I was wearing.
- Okay.
- Tell what?
Draco playfully hit Harry’s shoulder. Harry was so cute snd clumsy.
- Stop your dirty hands right there, Malfoy.
He nodded and a quiet ‘thank you’ escaped his lips.
- I have been too scared to open it so I don’t even know how the gun looks like itself.
At some point he gave up and started sleeping on the floor, going out of his room only to poke the food at the great hall. He didn’t want to do that but usually Hermione would barge in every morning and take him there by force.
- I promise you, I don’t have anything going on with Draco.
They were both sitting on the wooden floor of the balcony, now. Malfoy was leaning against the metal fence and Harry’s was sitting on the opposite side of the small space, leaning against the old wall. Chilly breeze was tangling their hair, making it messier than it already was.
- Yeah, okay.
- There has got to be something that might cure him.
- Now try them on! Let’s see this one first.
- Oh, Potter. Why so excited?
Hmm, Draco. Weren’t they enemies or something? Or did it somehow go away at the beginning of the eight year? Ah, he didn’t care anyway.
- But he needs the trust, the love you can give him, Draco.
Draco climbed off Harry and offered the boy his hand. When they both were standing on the ground, Malfoy looked around, trying to understand where were they. Suddenly, he realised. The building was abandoned and all of the windows were boarded up.
Potter was almost unconscious, his face red, body shaking rapidly. Hermione touched his forehead and after a few seconds declared that Harry had a cold, maybe the flu.
- You have a crush on Pansy!
- Ron, I haven’t seen you lately. What happened between us?
He was wearing a black t-shirt, a jean jacket covered with pin badges and patches, wide jeans (he heard they had a funny name in the muggle world - mom jeans), and socks with little monsters on them. Yeah, Draco liked it, it was perfect.
- He told me I wasn’t his son, when I came out. If he can’t accept me, why do I want him to be my father?
- Ron, you’re being childish and unreasonable. Stop it. We’re friends, aren’t we?
- I left you all of this stuff: exercises, notes, questions. And you haven’t even bothered to read them once. They are always in the same place where I leave them the day before! “Oh Potter is depressed! Oh Potter needs help!” I am sick of it. I have real friends and I am wasting my time with you here! I’m gonna tell Mcgonagall that I’m quitting!
- Hey, Harry, focus on my eyes, okay?
Malfoy was once again led by Harry. They were going somewhere upstairs, passing an impossible amount of stairs. The boys climbed onto the roof, entering a small balcony.
- You...
- A fashion emergency!
Ron nodded. He didn’t actually know what happened to Harry after that day he saw Malfoy and his best friend holding hands. He kind of distanced himself from Harry since then. The thought of his enemy dating his friend weirded him out. It was… wrong? Yeah, wrong.
oof, feelingsarecompicated
- I want this to end, Draco, I really do.
- Stop it, your fingers are making me cold!
- Hey, you can close your eyes and I will ask you questions to distract you, okay?
Malfoy looked at Harry. They both had a great time and Draco didn’t want it to end. Will they have to just go their dorms?
Harry sinked himself in the warm material. It was way bigger than Harry’s usual clothes. He actually lost a lot of weight since the war, so now all his clothe were big for him. Draco was taller than Harry so his jacket was even bigger for the brunette.
- Now take deep breaths. Yeah, like that. Feel better?
The boy was stunned. He couldn’t have done even a single outfit and she managed to get five! Truly a powerful wizard.
- Yeah, one of my muggle friends taught me how to do it. Why do you ask?
- You didn’t! How?
Harry looked at him with a smile. He took Malfoy by the hand.
Draco smiled and wiped away the tears from Harry’s eyes with his hand. He hugged the boy again and made sure Potter wasn’t shaking anymore. He liked burying his face in brunette’s soft clothes, breathing in the smell of pancakes (the only food Harry would eat these days). They sat like that for a minute or two, their breathing rhythms synchronising, fingers locked together. Oh, how much Draco wanted to kiss Harry right now. To tell him it’s okay, and that he is his world, and Draco would never leave him. Instead, Malfoy bottled up that feeling and slightly pushed himself away from Potter.
Harry smiled. He hit Draco back and they ended up wrestling each other on the ground. Harry was the one who stopped first, trying to hold Malfoy from tickling him.
Something clicked in Harry’s mind.
Harry looked at the notes written in neat handwriting, read them over and put them in the exact same place as they were.
Harry smiled even wider. He knew they would have a good time at the concert.
Draco looked at Harry and smiled. Finally, Potter was having a good time. They both earned it. It was a stressful two months. Malfoy’s smoking became worse. Luckily, he had a freshening spell memorised, so Harry never felt the smell of smoke on Draco’s hoodies. It wasn’t like he was ashamed of smoking, he just didn’t want to disturb Harry with the smell of it. Potter seemed to wear the blonde’s hoodies a lot.
- We’re not dating. We’re just friends.
Harry looked at the stars, they were so peaceful. Then, he looked at Malfoy. He didn’t know much about him. He was so mysterious. Harry knew that Draco was hurt. He knew it without the words, he could see it in his eyes. It wasn’t easy for Harry to talk about his feelings, though he did share with Malfoy. The blonde was completely different. He didn’t open up at all, he tried not to show any signs of his feelings. Harry felt it, though. He felt it in that maniac laugh, in the way he breathed out the smoke, in the way he was sitting on the balcony fence (like he could jump from it any second, like it would be nothing for him to just let go of the black metal and fall). The scarred boy wanted to help Malfoy so much but how could he, if he couldn’t even help himself.
- Now, close your eyes, it might be painful a bit. I’m not a professional so I can’t promise you anything.
- Yeah but I did get the pine cone, so everything’s great.
- Yeah, sure, they are pretty cool. Okay, next question. What color would you dye your hair?
- Granger, I swear, if you rip my ear off i will-  aahh!
2. In this fic Hermione and Ron never dated!
- My wan-
The blonde jumped up a bit, he didn’t expect anyone being behind him. He stopped, letting Harry come close to him.
Malfoy grabbed the boy by the shoulders, slightly pushing him away. He looked Harry right in the eyes, making sure Harry looked into his. He stared at him for a moment, trying to tell him what he thought without speaking.
- The hell? - Ron was panicking. It was the first time he saw his friend like that.
- I got you, don’t worry.
- That you like him!
They were running hand in hand, chilly wind blowing in their faces. Then, Harry tripped and fell onto the soft grass, dragging Draco with him. They both collapsed to the ground, Draco landing on top of Harry. They both started laughing so hard, that their stomachs were hurting.
Tears were running down Harry’s face again. Malfoy hugged him, comforting Potter while he cried hysterically. It wasn’t quiet sobbing anymore, it was straightforward crying, which felt so relieving. Tears burning his face, Malfoy’s cold fingers stroking his back.
- Your wand doesn’t count!
The boys go to a concert.
Days passed and passed, it has been a week since Malfoy first came. The pile of notes beside Harry was growing, still not leaving a trace of knowledge in mis mind.
She sat on the bed next to Draco.
- Sure, yeah. So, Hermione, would you happen to know anything about... uhh... piercing?
Harry woke up somewhere near dinner. He saw Hermione sitting on the floor, reading a book.
(See the end of the chapter for
This time he was wearing a hoodie and black sweatpants.
The girl sat besides Malfoy. She put her hand on his shoulder and started speaking softly, after taking a deep breath.
Hermione came in, interrupting his thoughts.
They didn’t need to hear the end of the sentence. Both Ron and Hermione rushed into Harry’s room, ready to help. The girl was already taking out her wand, as if preparing to attack the cold.
- Follow me.
Draco chuckled to himself. Apparently, that song was the last one, so they kind of had to go. Though Malfoy didn’t want the night to end.
He ran back to the common room, searching for Ron and Hermione. They were found at their usual places by the fire.
- Oh, sorry.
Draco stopped and looked into Harry’s eyes. They were so close, holding hands, looking each other in the eyes. A pair of grey-blue ones, a pair of green ones. The green eyes were filling up with bitter tears. Salty droplets were rolling down Harry’s cheeks, burning his skin. Draco wiped the tears off with his hand and started speaking softly.
- Harry, do you know anything about therapy?
A month? Harry thought only a week had passed. Maybe he just lost track of time. Doesn’t matter, he really wants this year to end.
- ‘Mione, that doesn’t mean anything, does it?
- What are we doing at the Shrieking Shack?
- I’ll stay, you go get sleep, it’s still early so you have time before the lessons.
- Do you have any regrets? - Harry was continuing with the questions.
Draco didn’t like the silence. Was he being judged? Made fun of? He was so stupid to say what he said. “She now probably thinks I’m a moron or crazy.”- he thought.
- Too official. You need to be more casual, take this one.
- Ron. It isn’t up to you to decide who Harry can and cannot date. Besides, they were just holding hands.
Hermione laughed with him too. It was a bit awkward but she liked being around Draco, who changed a lot since the war. She was quite sure that he would not call her names again and not hex her. Maybe they even could become friends.
The songs were getting slower and calmer, Draco was tired, so he and Harry went to grab a drink at the bar. There were several people, who were also getting drinks but most of the crowd was still listening to the band, slowly moving to the calming songs.
It was an early February morning, a very cold one. The coldest one of the year probably. Harry was just laying on the floor, running his hands through the carpet. It was soft and comforting, making him forget about the things in the world outside of his room. Maybe the outside of his room could forget about him too? Then
- Left leg is for fools!
- Let’s start with History of Magic, shall we? - Draco asked
- So, where did you get the piercing gun?
- What animal is your patronus?
- But you would get cold, sitting only in a t-shirt.
They entered the club in Hogesmeade. The music wasn’t playing but it was loud and crowded already. People were standing everywhere, holding drinks in their hands, chatting, laughing. Some were dressed in muggle clothes, some were wearing wizard clothes. They were mostly young, though there were some older generations as well. Every fifth person had a tattoo or dyed hair. The only lights were the blue-purple ones, they were creating a very comforting atmosphere.
Draco was relieved. God, was he scared that Granger would say something horrible and make him feel worse. He breathed out and muttered a quiet ‘Thanks’ to her.
- That must be so hard to have a parent not accept you the way you are. I’m sorry, Draco.
- I’m the Winter King, don’t you remember?
After two hours of studying Draco left his notes and went away to Quidditch practice. Harry missed Quidditch but he knew that if he would like to fly again he would need to attend lessons and get decent grades, he still wasn’t ready to do that.
Harry sighed in response. Deep down he knew Ron was right, things were worse now than their time in Hogwarts, but Harry had been so blinded by his blossoming friendship with Malfoy that he had forgotten all about what was happening to him only a few months before. Brutal beatings from Lucius Malfoy, being constantly threatened to be sent to the workhouses, having to work long and exhausting hours just stood by an office door causing his muscles to go stiff. And now they were tending to a room full of Slytherins, who remember a time when Harry Potter ruled Hogwarts. Yet here he was now, serving their drinks.
“Live a little, Potter,” responded Malfoy, finally looking at him. His face was alive. Those grey eyes that normally appeared sunken and sad were now twinkling, filled with joy. There was colour in his face, his cheeks pink with glee.
“Me too,” said Harry. “She’s quite nice to me when I pass her. Always civil. I think it’s because I saved Malfoy’s life.”
“Your father has been acting out at the ministry,” one of them explained. Harry noticed he also worked at the ministry; Harry knew him from his training days.
Not being able to watch any more of this, Harry left and hurried down the stairs.
“We are holding a funeral for Astoria in two days time,” explained Narcissa in a soft voice, “but today there is something we need you to do.”
Malfoy didn’t even make eye contact with Harry, he just sat and stared at the table, waiting for Harry to complete his task. This happened every morning, and for some reason, it always bothered Harry. He just didn’t understand why.
“No one’s in here, mate.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Hermione,” whispered Harry. She just shook her head in response, keeping her eyes to the floor. Now, it was all different.
“You can’t just sleep on these feelings.”
He couldn’t imagine the emotions Draco would be going through right now. On one hand, he would be glad to see his father get taken down, for the wizarding world in England to be restored back to it’s glory it was in before Lucius took over. But Draco did love his father dearly, he always had and always would. Lucius was his idol ever since he was a very young boy, and Lucius did love Draco. Maybe less over the years, and especially less as Draco got older and started to rebel. But he had always given Draco as much love as his cold heart was able to and had done everything Draco had needed.
,” receipted Malfoy, “
“Harry?” called a familiar voice as he arrived at his destination. Suddenly, Mrs Weasley burst out the door to the burrow and ran to him before engulfing him in a warm, loving hug.
“Come here,” said Mrs Weasley, grabbing onto Draco’s extremely thin frame and wrapping her arms around him. Draco seemed to melt into the hug. As much as he loved his mother, he lacked the nurture Mrs Weasley had given to all her children for all the years they were alive. Not because Narcissa didn’t love Draco the same amount, but because she wasn’t able to show this love in front of her husband. Who always stood by her side when she saw her son.
“I can’t go back,” said Harry after a long pause, “Not now. Lucius will kill me.”
“Go to bed, Potter,” his voice remained gentle. “Have the rest of the day off.”
“I could never,” replied Malfoy, pointing to the door. “You’d better go and have your own breakfast. It’s nine, you’ll miss it if you don’t hurry.”
Malfoy lead Harry to a room that was used for travel. He grabbed the floo powder and instructed Harry to do so too, then headed towards a fireplace. As he threw down the floo, he said loudly ‘Knockturn Alley’, which made Harry’s heart race. Slowly Harry made his way to the fireplace and threw the powder down, repeating the same words Malfoy had said.
With a large grin, he looked at his bedside table. There sat an old faithful friend, his 11” holly wand. Grasping it, he felt the wand’s wood with his fingers, warmth caressing his hand. How he missed his wand for those long weeks at Malfoy Manor.
“We’re not up to anything, sir,” replied Malfoy. His shoulders were relaxed, his face expressionless. All he did was look up at the large men cowering over him, blinking every so often, lips pressed tightly shut together.
“When we were caught in the storm.”
“What’s happening?” asked Harry, eyebrows furrowed as the couple stood close together, tears running down Mrs Weasley’s face.
Without saying anything, Malfoy strode past Harry, expecting him to follow, which he did. Harry thought they would be going back to the office, but he was wrong. Instead, Malfoy lead him upstairs. He’d only been upstairs to Malfoy’s quarters a handful of times; his post was predominantly outside the office. The long black corridors were even more winding than those on the floors below. Every so often they approached a floor length window, with black curtains surrounding it. The view outside was astonishing, trees stretched for miles and miles. They truly were in the middle of nowhere.
“What?”
Harry was shocked. He sat there, his mouth open, staring at the back of Malfoy.
“Perfectly fucking fine,” spat Malfoy, shaking his head, and leaning back in the seat before looking out of his office window. The light from the candle on his desk illuminated his face, making the tears shine more. Malfoy swallowed, before looking back at Harry. “No, I’m not.”
There was a continuous tapping on Harry’s door. Groaning, he opened his eyes, hoping whoever it was would go away. Today was a Saturday, and Harry was supposed to be having the day off. But whoever this was behind the door definitely had other plans.
But, Harry was just a butler in this massive mansion, only seeing their public conversations. He didn’t know what they talked about behind closed doors, after dinner, when it was just the two of them. Maybe they were deeply in love, but Malfoy just didn’t want to show weakness like back at Hogwarts. Like back when he was ordered to kill Dumbledore…
Because of Ron taking the week off work, it had just been Harry stood outside Malfoy’s office. This was unfortunate, but since he’d started working there nothing much had happened. In reality Harry knew they only needed one ex-auror to stand outside Malfoy’s office, but Ron was definitely good company to have all day.
“I found you,” he said with a grin, “I will take you to Lucius.”
“It is. Astoria’s nice, too, Hermione’s right.”
“He’s okay,” called Harry to Narcissa, as Harry saw Malfoy’s eyes watching him.
Malfoy paused and swallowed. “You heard our conversation?”
Harry watched Malfoy for a few moments. His face was taut, as if he were deep in thought about something that troubled him. His legs took long strides as he strutted through the English town, trying to decide on where to go next. But his look never faltered, his chin never lowered, even though he was unsure on what to do he remained confident, as if he had walked these paths before.
“Astoria,” slurred Draco quietly.
“M-Me?” stuttered Hermione as she stepped forwards a few steps.
“Harry,” whispered Malfoy, not looking away. It was as if the pain had melted away. Here Harry was, by his side. This was all Draco needed.
“Harry?” he whispered.
“No, no, Narcissa. He must learn,” Lucius’ bony fingers placed themselves on Malfoy’s shoulders, squeezing them tightly, fingernails digging into his clothes so firmly they threatened to break the skin that lay underneath.
Malfoy slowly looked through each item of clothing, studying each one, running his thin hands over the material to feel it. After some careful consideration, he pulled out a suit and handed it over to Harry.
“You have to talk back. Let your father know he’s wrong.”
“Merlin, Potter, calm down,” laughed Malfoy, shaking his head, his eyes kind. “You’re so worried all the time.”
Ryan was getting ready to go boating when he spotted Harry, stumbling along near the canal docks before plopping himself down near the water’s edge. Ryan had headed over to Harry, asked him if he needed any help.
way.”
After a third thrash, Harry heard the door open.
“Astoria,” grumbled Malfoy, looking at her sternly.
The door swung open and Harry stormed in. For a moment, Malfoy’s expression read pure horror as all the blood drained from his face.
“Then you will just have to kill Lucius,” said Ron matter-of-factly, which had Harry chuckling.
“A song my mother used to sing to me as a child when I was crying,” replied Malfoy. “I used to come here often. I still do. No one ever comes here, it’s extremely hard to get to for muggles. It’s closed off from the world. I feel safe here,” Malfoy looked at Harry, his eyes seemed sad. “It’s the only place I can truly be alone,” he looked back out to the loch.
