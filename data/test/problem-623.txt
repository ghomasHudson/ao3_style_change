He had no information for a week, then suddenly an invitation came from Lucius to visit the Manor. He was pondering its weirdness when his wards sparkled. Someone just apparated on his propriety.
“What happened? You said something about a baby?” He asked.
“I am not implying anything, you killed Narcissa, what else can I expect from you!” Sirius’s voice boomed as if he had cast a Sonorus.
Hermione had been off the whole day after that. In Potions they had to make a Draught of the Living Dead and whoever succeeded would receive a vial of Liquid Luck, and she stirred both times clockwise… Her potion had the wrong color, she brewed a Polyjuice potion for Merlin’s sake…
“That is very clever,” Hermione’s eyes lighted up. “What about the straightening agent for the potion? How did you manage that?
“Abbot!?” Pansy asked in disbelief.
Her? Who was he talking about? From what Severus knew, he never had someone in his life, his only family is his brother… did… had he have a sister?
“I lost Teddy!” Sirius screamed.
“I do not care for or need help. I should have figured out you were behind the coin.”
“Can I… stay with you for this class?”
“Hello, sweetheart,” She said and took the baby in her arms. She cast a few diagnostic charms and the baby yelped unhappy at the touch of her magic.
“You’d win anyway, Gin,” He smiled and walked out.
“Everyone wants to be loved,” Hannah spat.
“He was out there for a while, I couldn’t pick any scents other than his own,” Remus stroked the few strands of hair on Teddy’s head.
“What?” Sirius and Remus said in the same time.
“They are everywhere, kind of hard to miss…”
The figure was hit by the spell and struggled against the magic chains.
The meeting concluded without any possible leads. A horcrux could be anything, a plate from the kitchen, a sickle Riddle came across… but Severus knew him, knew Riddle would choose something with significance…
“Of course, he did” Hermione bit her lip.
There were only a few minutes before the Feast ends and Harry finally made his appearance. He wasn’t injured, but he didn’t look ok. He passed by his usual table and sat by Ron at the Gryffindor table; the others greeted him merrily. Luna looked at him worried and then glared at the Slytherin table. Luna never glared, never got angry at anyone… Hermione was truly worried now.
It didn’t get easier for Hermione after that. She was distracted, she needed to focus even more to pay attention; her grades weren’t slipping yet, but she felt like she was on the precipice. Ron and Lavender were everywhere, she didn’t realize how much their life had intertwined.  In class, there they were not paying attention and passing notes; on their trips to Hogsmeade, their free time, she hadn’t got to exchange a word with Ron without Lavender being there as well, glued to his side.
Remus stared wide-eyed, the “our baby” part, the eyes changing part, a bit too much to take in.
Hermione tried to close her mouth, but it was pretty hard. She heard Draco had gone a bit off the rails, but she couldn’t really process it. It didn’t seem like the same Draco she knew. He was always cold and a bit rude, but nothing like what he was now… Last year he had changed a lot to fit with the Inquisition Squad, but that was history now.
Remus nodded and Bodin fed Teddy the potion. The baby started crying.
“Do not spoil my fun, Hermione! I think it’s Millicent… No way she could’ve got Harry to go out with her otherwise.”
“Without anyone noticing?”
“I was in London with some teammates,” she said. He raised his eyebrows – she wasn’t even going to
And, just like that, everyone snapped out of it, filling the empty seats and running full-speed into their own conversations. Hermione and Molly kept sending him worried glances, but they were the only ones.
Hermione sat on the edge of a chair, crossing her legs and looking at him expectantly. Her posture was stiff, formal.
“We’ll have to side-along,” Draco said. Harry held out his arm.
Nothing was broken, it seemed. Nothing important enough to keep him from walking. He took a step forward, then another. A persistent, nagging thought that made him stop. It was important, for some reason, that he make sure no one was around.
fault. It was all Harry - then Harry
“They wouldn’t,” Draco called.
Harry sat at the edge of the cushions, flipping until he found the flower-woman artwork again. There were other illustrations, but that one seemed to stick out. “A book.
“We’re going to be fine,” Hermione said from between them. Her tone brooked no argument. “It’s hardly the worst thing that could have happened. You need to remember that.”
He hadn’t seen her since that one came out, and anticipated her cheeky wink as he walked into the office. “Hello, Harry, me lover.”
“Yeah,” Dean frowned. “But you’re, like, smiling.”
judgement. She married a muggle, for example.”
“What?”
“I think the blood is a bit much,” he commented, holding a rook by the foot. Syrupy ‘blood’ dripped down to the foot but never actually fell away from the body, no matter how hard he shook it.
, I’ll need to find somewhere to live. More permanently.”
Oh, and
“Oh.” Was that a test? It sort of felt like one. “Lovely to meet you, er, Minerva.” It felt wrong to call her that, when even Ron never did.
“You took it from him. After we were captured by the Snatchers, we fought our way out of the Manor. I’m not certain how you got ahold of it, but there it was. Yours was – was destroyed, so you kept it. Worked well enough.”
“What’s that?”
“Of course,” he said, defensive. If Ron wasn’t constantly going on about it, the altercation in the hallway at the Ministry would be enough. “Don’t fancy a mob at the door.”
“I can’t produce a Patronus. I’ll Floo to Ron’s and wake them – “
The door closed.
“I’m the only one who can…perform it. The ritual.”
and be prepared to brief us. Got it?”
The stairway had switched. Not moved, like at Hogwarts, but…they had been climbing down, and now they were going up. Large windows on either side showed the library courtyard far below. The last of the dizziness faded as he reoriented. He lowered his arms where they were held out for balance.
“Erm, I’m well, thanks,” Harry answered. Molly set another plate down, absently
“You mean with the time turner?”
With absolutely no warning whatsoever, Hermione burst into tears. Quite violently. Her chair screeched back and she fled the room. Ron’s eyes went very wide.
“No. No.” Draco blinked furiously, and his breaths were growing less even. “The curtains opened themselves. There was a man on the street. Muggle clothes.”
Potter’s hand slid back into the mud. The next slap didn’t even register.
Yes. Right. Feeling a bit stupid, he stepped back again as the bricks rolled open like a great set of drapes, making certain his robes were fastened. He pulled his hood up for good measure as he saw just how many people were milling around. Maybe he could wear a headband, but his
“Which is good,” Hermione said next, looking more regretful. “I think he might trust you.”
Hermione was in his chair, head bent forward onto one hand. Ron was leaning over the desk, in the middle of saying something that sounded really cutting. Harry couldn’t quite catch it, because as soon as the door opened he stopped.
Ron smirked and threw a volley of curses. Harry blocked them, knocked back a step at the force of a
Refutation of All Heresies
“I did what anyone would do,” Draco said sharply. “And, for the record, I was only evening the score. You’ve saved my life – “
Pig was picking at the uneaten plate. The flight across London and right back must have exhausted the old thing, but Harry couldn’t have left him at the house with Castor.
For the first time, she looked at him. Abruptly, he understood. It was very, very scary. He made a concerted effort not to shrink away from her gaze. It wasn’t angry, he hoped, but her features didn’t seem like they’d allow for much else. Ginny’s description had been bang-on:
“Where’s your wand?”
Then she poofed away. Draco gave a disbelieving huff of air.
“It’s awful,” Harry summed up, sinking into an empty chair.
“I remember it like yesterday,” Seamus said wistfully. Debra wasn’t as misty-eyed, but her frown softened as she looked at the superstructure. “And you don’t remember it at all. Weird.”
Charlie’s voice floated through the door, then out to them as he pulled it open. “It’s bloody freezing out here. What the hell are you two doing?”
“You have nothing to show for all of this?” He gestured in her general direction. “What’s the point of it? The secrecy?”
“It’s drivel. Leftover from the first war – you should overturn it, really.”
He set it to the side, along with the
He smiled back without thinking, and her shoulders relaxed a bit.
“Stop,” Draco whispered back. Harry fell silent. “You think that’s why I’m doing this?”
So he stopped, listening intently without knowing why. Calling out for help would have made more sense, but he didn’t. It felt…dangerous. Someone must have done this to him, and left him there.
At the sound of his name, Draco’s hand spasmed. The measuring spoon glanced off the side of the cauldron and fell to the carpet, bleeding indigo into the threads. He cursed and cleaned it away with a spell, writing something down on parchment and re-filling the spoon in quick succession.
She stood there with her hands on her hips, breathing hard. Normally she at least knocked, and her afternoons with him were quiet. This was something different altogether. “Where’s the snake?”
“Sorry.” She leaned back. “It must be that foul old house mucking things up. Was Malfoy there?”
Ron prodded him in the chest, eyes bright with excitement. “Come on. They’ll eat up anything you say.”
Mahmoud didn’t even have to think about it. “I cannot think of anyone with a vendetta against me, if that’s what you’re asking.”
Ron made no attempt to cover his disdain. “We’re working on it. That’s why you’re here.”
Draco’s shoulders tensed. “Yes. Thursday.”
. “Or maybe I’ll go to that Quidditch game.”
Dean nodded. “Last time they fought, our office lost it’s per diem for a month.”
“No.”
“What?” Hermione asked.
Draco started to shake his head, then went frustratingly blank. It was a well-practiced sort of blankness, borne of years and years of hard work. He held out his hand, and Harry tossed the wand through the air. He caught it easily, using it to pull aside the curtain just a few inches. Golden street-light shone in a line over his face. Harry filed it all away. Later. He would ask, but it wouldn’t be tonight.
“The diary horcrux must have been the first. From what Harry and Ginny said, the soul shard trapped inside was a teenager; that must have been the age that the spell was cast,” Dumbledore explained.
“We have a complaint about the welfare of your… heir.”
“Can we borrow this?” Hermione asked weighting the coin in the palm of her hand.
“Magic?” Sirius asked.
“I will go and say hi to my Slytherins now,” He says loudly and grabbed his bag.
“There is Percy also.”
The Defense against the Dark Arts post was something he always wished for growing up, but now that he actually got it, his life felt even emptier. He missed Lily and Harry and even Black and Lupin; he got used to having them around, to have people to spend holidays and long summer days with. But he was doing the right thing, even if he caught himself saying that in the mirror.
“Well once during the developing period”
“I don’t know… I can’t get to him anymore, it’s like he is a different person now… I am afraid he took the Mark,” Harry confessed.
Hermione’s POV
“It changes every time I look at it… The time and place,” Seamus said looking down.
“Yeah. Tell me one evil Hufflepuff in all of our history.”
“Very sure, miss, we are talking our job very seriously,” Winky spoke for the first time. “We are good elves, miss.”
“Baby?” He asked catching his breath.
Severus started running. Dumbledore had shared with the teacher an emergency plan in case the Death Eaters attacked. Take the children to the dungeon, the least luckily place to strike and then lead the attackers as far away as possible. Dumbledore proposed to lead them to the Astronomy tower, so that was the destination he picked.
“So many people are hung up on other that do not care about them, not giving a chance to the people that do. So I am giving them a chance to be happy with the people that love them.”
“What eye color does he has to you?” Sirius asked holding Teddy up. Teddy was making grabby hands at the green fire and Remus snatched him back.
“Hello, Neville” Hermione smiled. “How come you are alone, is Ron sick?” She asked trying to not let her concern seep into her words.
He walked closer, he could hear a faint heartbeat, but could not smell anything other than rain and a barely there milk scent. He walked to the door cautious, they installed more charms on the door, but he was still shaken up from what happened to Narcissa.
“I just… I hate him so much…”
“Does Zonko sell something like that?”
“Padfoot!”
Draco raised a shaky wand to the headmaster. Severus stepped out of the shadows and raised his wand in turn. Dumbledore turned to him:
“In the market…I had my hands busy and asked Harry to hold him, but Teddy really wanted to walk so we let him down. And Harry was holding his hand….”
“He is eating apple bunnies with Harry in the kitchen,” Andromeda said.
“So we assume he has at least a few others out there, the maximum can be seven” Nympahadora speaks. The Auror work had changed her, she sounded more confident than she ever had in school.
“She asked him to go out last night and he said yes.”
Lupin was the first to speak in the silence that follows, “One of the Deathly Hallows!? I didn’t… I thought it was a myth.”
“I thought… it would be worth it if it worked, just to …see her again,” Dumbledore mumbled.
“It’s fine to not be” Pansy said.
Hermione headed to the kitchen; Pansy had to rush to follow after her. The Ravenclaw prefect tickled the pear near the Hufflepuff entrance and walked in. As soon as she got in, the elves started hiding and in a few seconds the kitchen was empty save for Dobby and Winky.
There was no note in the basket, the baby was wearing a blue onesie that had the word Teddy stitched on it with green thread. Remus picked him up, the baby was warm to the touch, so close Remus could smell the werewolf on him. He panicked. This baby was even younger than he was and he was the youngest ever recorded case. He sent a Patronus for Bodin, Lily and Sirius.
She disappeared with a poof.
“How could you?”
“His mother died, of course he did!” Sirius screamed.
Harry jumped; he didn’t notice her lost in thoughts.
“But he is so….” Bodin’s eyes watered. “I don’t know if a baby can even take the potion….”
Remus looked down at the sleeping baby in his lap. His scent got sharper, the werewolf overpowering the milk scent. Remus nodded and handed over the baby. Teddy woke up and stared at Remus with sharp blue eyes.
A few weeks in, Sirius took him and Harry to a muggle farmer’s market, Sirius’s latest obsession. Teddy’s favorite new thing was walking, so they tried to walk with him as more as possible even though he tire easily. Remus decided to sit in and read a bit since he didn’t get as much time to do it with Teddy around. Of course, he didn’t get to sleep as much either and he was out cold after the first paragraph.
The baby, Teddy, turned to Remus and grabbed at him. He started fussing in Lily’s arms, but still not crying.
“Why?”
“Is it deactivated?” Remus asked.
“The guy he considered his best friend turned out to be an… ass. Imagine sharing a room with someone like that,” Neville shudders.
“I would ask you to leave the house, I am sure you have enough kids to fill in the role!”
“What happened?” She asked.
“Hermione, it will be fine!” Harry reassured her.
His eyes looked a bit darker than usual, but a murky color, nothing definitive. Remus took Teddy and got a better look.
“He hasn’t,” Severus’s voice was softer, gentler.
“The kitchen elves, but I highly doubt it’s them.”
Remus was working in the store. They were getting a healthy flow of customers that summer. Remus took over Narcissa’s accounting after she…. left. In the end, no one was accused of it. Like she took her own life with an Avada Kadavra in her own home.
“I am kidnapping Draco as soon as he turns 18,” Sirius let Remus know with a dark look in his eyes.
“Yes, you can send messages to a lot of people or only one… But how do they know who to give it to? We didn’t receive any…”
“I was following him in the Cloak… He is spending a lot of time in the Room of Requirement, but I can’t go there with him, as soon as I step in the room changes for me… Today he spent almost all day there, even during classes… I found him the bathroom, he was crying… I tried to talk to him, promised to help him with his dad… But he… snapped at me and then we started fighting… I never wanted to…”
Dumbledore remained quiet for a few minutes. The people around the table were already getting restless and looking at each other, Black was about to ask something, but Remus squeezed his arm to stop him.
Hermione got her letter from the twins early the next morning. She was too afraid to touch her food so she poured over it instead. She didn’t know when to approach Pansy so she was still at the Ravenclaw table when her friend plumped down beside her.
“Since they are all connected I assume he knows, but I am not sure if he knows which are been deactivated,” Dumbledore explained.
“You improved,” He said pleased.
Lucius came to pick up Draco 20 minutes early. Sirius made him wait in the foyer for all of that time. Remus had to sit across from him in his chair and reading his book with the other man’s eyes glaring at him. When they left, Lucius didn’t even say good-bye.
“He is one year old, 9 kilograms, that is on the smaller side, the venom is taking hold though, not fully transformed, the bite is not older than a few hours, probably last night.”
Harry broke into a run.
“Thank god, he didn’t want to be a Death Eater then.”
A few days later Dora received her termination from the Ministry, for influence peddling. They all knew this was Lucius’s doing and interfering, but they had no way to fight it. Remus always found the Ministry scary, but now the beast that was growing inside it was more powerful than ever before.
When he walked in, Draco was bleeding on the floor. Harry was casting the small amount of healing spells Lily had thought him, but he was also crying, so he missed most of them.
didn’t,” Hannah said.
Basically if Pansy and Hermione were a cop duo.
“How did that happen?”
“We will find out soon enough,” Hermione whispered back. They were hiding in the greenhouse waiting for the culprit to arrive with the potion.
“As safe as we could make it,” Lily assured.
Hermione tensed as someone opened the door to the greenhouse. The figure was wearing a cloak.
Sirius was shaking outside the gates. the Manor starts resembling its old self, no doubt due to the newly formed heir bond and the familial magic poured in. A few peacocks hiss at them and try to attack, but Dora cast a shield around them.
“The bitch is back in the Government.”
“You only teach me defensive spells… It was the only offensive one I knew.”
After the break, both boys seem determined to avoid each other. Draco was attending all of his classes again, but he started spending all of his nights in the Room of Requirement.
“He is a metamorphus. This is how Dora started as well, next it will be hair color,” Andromeda said when it was her turn to held the squealing baby.
“Greyish,” Lily said.
Severus Snape was having one of the strangest years of his career. It all started when Dumbledore announced that he finally found a replacement for the Potions position and that Severus can take up Defense if he still wants to.  Severus accepted of course.
“Fine, then we need someone who is desperately in love and pining loudly then!” Pansy puffed.
“Car crash, a muggle death since she chose to give up magic.”
“Would never use it because it’s immoral?”
“It is now, I used the Gryffindor sword,” Dumbledore assured them.
Hermione started chatting with the elves, but Pansy spaced out.
“You look like someone pissed in your soup.”
The next few weeks felt like Hermione was living through years of bad luck. She had to work harder than ever to keep her grades up. It was like all around her people were going crazy, all that everyone talked about was dating. Harry was a breath of fresh air, but all that he ever talked about was Draco.
Remus laughed, “Then she will ban pets next!”
“Why didn’t you check it over first!? Of course it was cursed, it has a piece of Voldemort’s soul inside!” Black burst.
She was early, as expected. Draco had already got into the train, but he didn’t spare her a glance. Pansy sent her a sorry look and followed her best friend in. Hermione could understand that. Her own best friend was late; if she has to miss the train because of Harry…
“I know I would find you here!” Pansy said bustling in.
“You only leave now because I am beating you,” Ginny grinned.
“Didn’t you know I already tried?” Draco laughed humorless.
“Yet,” Harry’s voice was so defeated and small, it tugged at Severus’s heart.
Draco cast a spell using the house wand. The wards cast them out and Dora’s warrant burnt.
“If you want to… I mean, I am here to listen.”
“But there wasn’t a full….” Remus froze. “Greyback.”
“What are you going to do with him while we search for his parents?” Lily asked
Harry reacted fast, so Draco was not bleeding to death, but he had deep gashes across his arms and was laying in a pool of his own blood.
Harry was late for the Feast, the only time he ever did that was when Black had smuggled him in to school, he was ready to excuse himself and go check when Harry entered the Hall with Lovegood close behind. Harry looked sad, but unharmed; he passed by his usual seat though, since it was occupied by Nott.
Chapter III
“Why do I need to be a part of this?”
Draco hissed in his mind.
Remus squeezed Teddy tighter, “If they knew about us, they should have known we can cure a recent bite.”
“Who is not related to us in the magical community?” Andromeda sighed.
His eyes turned to clear brown in front of Lily’s eyes.
“Someone tried to poison you!?”
“Severus, please,” His voice was not begging for his life, he was asking Severus to do it, so Draco didn’t have to… The curse felt cold on his lips, he was surprised it even worked since Severus had no intent behind it, just fear for his godson, for the world.
“We have more than we had before,” Remus said.
“What about losing him then?” Remus turned towards his lover.
She was hanging around by the Astronomy tower one evening, she knew they weren’t any classes that day so the road should be clear. She wasn’t expecting any company, but she got one anyway. She was conjuring some birds, playing with a new spell when Pansy walked in.
Chapter II
“Fucking…” Bodin cursed loudly. “Let me get him a dose… How much do you distill a potion for a baby?”
“I think he got himself into something big this time…I am not sure how to get him out,” Pansy’s voice was trembling.
“I got my answer from the twins,” Hermione said pulling out the letter. “They sell the potion, but it shouldn’t be this effective, so I assume someone is increasing the strength of it locally.”
“What?” Remus rushed in.
Hannah glared.
“I know, it’s just easier to go with the flow”. The birds closed in, they were ruffling Pansy’s hair.
“But who has access to your meal?”
“Incarcerus!” Hermione cast.
Hermione flicked her wand and the birds disappeared leaving Pansy’s perfect bob messy.
“Why are you telling me this?”
“Siri!” Andromeda shook her head sad.
“It contained the Resurrection stone,” Dumbledore said in the end.
Remus glared at Sirius and held Teddy closer.
No one had an answer for that.
Hermione huffed, but guided him to their compartment. Ron, Neville and Ginny were already there playing Exploding Snap; they all had already agreed not to mention Draco.
Seamus’s eyes turned steely.
“You are right. I want to see Draco!”
Harry flinched. They hadn’t mentioned Draco’s name in a few months by unspoken agreement.
She was reading in the library one night, alone since no one was showing up to the study group anymore. She was sure there was a couple making out behind some shelves, but she was ignoring them.
When the room cleared of the first years and some of the others, Hermione slipped by Harry. Lavender dragged Ron off a few minutes ago leaving Harry alone.
“You’ve done enough, Harry,” Severus said.
Severus rushed over once he was sure the Death Eaters cleared the tower. Harry was hidden under the Invisibility Cloak frozen in place by a spell. Severus lifted it. Harry turned to him – big betrayed eyes.
“My family owns an inn,” Hannah started, it looked like all the fight had left her, she sounded tired and defeated. “We have had it for generations; we use a spell to get the food from the kitchen to the tables, similar to what the house elves are using at Hogwarts. I use that to deliver the potion…”
“But who left us the basket then?” Sirius asked. “I do not see Greyback being this considerate”
Chapter I
“He can be related to us then?” Sirius asked.
“Is he…”
“We caught the person that is in charge with spiking people’s food with a love potion,” Pansy started.
Sirius and Draco returned from the train station pensive and broody. Draco went up to his room after a quick hello. Remus told Sirius about seeing Draco in the woods that night, but they decided not to tell Harry. Harry and Draco had to figure it out themselves according to Sirius. A Black figuring out feelings and owning up to them, Remus had his doubts.
“Granger, Parkinson,” he nodded his head. “What can I do for ‘ya? Want to start an army again?”
“I heard about Weasley and Brown,” Pansy started after a few minutes of silence.
“We can’t let him live,” Nott stepped out.
“I know,” Pansy’s tone was softer than she ever heard before.
“I would listen to him, you do not want to start anything you can’t finish.”
The Black family lawyer looked like he may have a conniption.
“Yes, having Sirius claim him is a step up in the family hierarchy anyway, they will be pleased.”
”I want to file an official complaint with the Ministry, this is slander!”
The chaos that followed was louder than Hermione expected. What she didn’t expect was Lavender and Ron, the antidote didn’t broke them up, because Lavender hasn’t used a love potion. She was hiding away under the tree they found Seamus that day.
Sirius growled low and threatening. Remus grabbed his arm.
“Do not worry, my dear, I am not planning to go until we see this thing done,” Dumbledore assured the room.
Harry and Draco were in the center of it all, circling each other like vultures.
Harry was in a bad mood as well… Draco has requested them to change rooms and Harry is rooming with Blaise now. At Nott’s instructions, Crabbe and Goyle were giving Harry a hard time in the Slytherin dorm. Blaise was the only Slytherin Hermione talked to… Pansy was also by Draco’s side, she didn’t look worried, but Hermione knew she must’ve been… She kind of missed Pansy too.
“Auror Tonks, as you can see my heir is perfectly fine. You gave chase to enough wild geese, you can go now,” Lucius’s tone was cold as ice.
“Miss Granger,” Dobby smiled.
Bodin crushed though the front door, he was not fully dressed and his shirt was askew, but his eyes were focused.
“Disarm him then!” Severus snapped.
A raggedy house elf welcomed them at the door. She was shacking and not looking very good, but Remus tried to choose his battles. She wouldn’t come even if they abused her.
“You can talk to me now?” Hermione glared.
Remus sighed and rested his chin on the sleeping’s baby head.
“You talk like Bodin.”
“Because now I am where I belong.”
Hermione startled and raised her eyes from the book she was pouring over.
“It’s cereal,” Hermione sighed. ”But I appreciate the try anyway.”
“We need to find someone down the Black line, a minor relative,” he clarified.
“Let’s be honest, you are the family lawyer for a while now, this is not the weirdest thing someone in my family ever asked you.”
“It didn’t… work.”
“What is wrong with you?”
“That is so…”
“Do you think…” Hermione started “The school is acting weird, I think it’s not only you.”
“Know what?” Severus asked.
Harry was dropping by the shop almost every day that Lily was at the hospital. He was helping out where he could or dropped by Fred and George that were working hard to open in the fall. His friends stopped by as well, Hermione and the Gryffindors. Blaise Zabini once, but not the other Slytherins. Sirius believed their parents banned them from visiting.
“Nope, I am buying him and Harry and cottage and lock them inside.”
He opened the door slowly, he didn’t smell blood or infection that were very strong scents, so it was not anyone in need of medical care. He pointed his wand forward, but there was nothing in his line of vision. The rustling got louder and he looked down. A basket, filled with linen and a small baby bundled up.
“Nope, Brussel sprouts, those are even nastier,” Ginny snickered.
Bodin worked fast with the help of Lily to modify the potion he made into a dose that was not too strong for a baby to handle. Remus was in charge of Te… the baby, while Sirius was in the shop.
“I have reason to believe more are in the school,” Severus said as he took his seat. They were all seated at a round table, Dumbledore’s idea of symbolism, most definitely.
“Can Prefects make civil arrests?” She asked excited.
“He will be fine, Hermione,” Ron sighed.
“How can you look him in the eyes after you know what you have done?! And it’s not the first one you killed out of jealousy!” Sirius made a step to get to them, but Remus grabbed him tighter.
“You know I never expected a Hufflepuff,” Pansy said suddenly.
“His best friend? And what am I, chopped liver?” Ron puffed his chest.
Pansy rolled her eyes, but nodded.
“I am storming Malfoy Manor!” Sirius said with a calm tone simmering with rage.
“So, it a house elf or someone trying to raise chaos?”
“She is an expert in it. I mean all of her kids turned out great.”
The only think Draco did was filling in a request to change his dorm. Severus accepted. He was afraid the boys will start fighting again… He went to surprised Draco moving out. His godson was meticulous and quiet; Harry was looking like a kicked puppy in the corner. The boys avoided looking at each other. No words were exchanged and it was heartbreaking…
“He has something in mind, that one. I can’t seem to get to him anymore,” Sirius sighed.
“Because Dobby has integrated here doesn’t mean all of them want new masters.”
“Can I take a look?” Hermione asked.
The Death Eaters were moving to leave. Draco was one of the last. He turned to Severus and pointed at a corner of the room.
Albus collapsed out of the window, but Severus didn’t watch him fall. Draco was shacking imperceptibly by his side. He put a hand on his godson’s shoulder to calm him down, but Draco shook it away.
Severus heard them from the hallway, the sound of spells being cast, they were dueling. Then, his heart got cold “Septusempra” he heard Harry cast.
He started teaching Harry defensive spells a while ago, he and Remus both were training him to protect himself. He had given Harry his grimoire to study this year while they can’t interact… Severus mentioned the spell, but he specifically said it was for enemies. What was Harry thinking?
The train was about to go when finally Harry appears of the platform, running, followed by his two uncles. Sirius Black helped Harry into the train while Professor Lupin was holding a baby; all of them were panting. The baby seems happy with the commotion secured in his guardian’s arms.
At the start of the year Draco came to him and asked to be officially named Malfoy in school records since he legally changed his name. At first, Severus wanted to reject it, to shout at him, but Lucius was right there smirking at his son’s side.
“Draco, are you ok? We can help you with anything you need… If he has something on you, if he is threatening you…” Dora started.
“Not really. People want to find someone that they have a connection with and build on that… What you did is stole that from them, their time, their choice,” Pansy interjected.
“Auror Tonks,” Lucius is waiting for them in the main foyer. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
Dumbledore summoned an Order meeting in his office. Severus arrived late. Lily, Black, Remus and Nymphadora Tonks were already there when he did. Lily was just finishing recounting her talk with Slaughorn.
Harry was late to the dinner as well. He missed the announcement that Snape would be their new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher. His seat at the Slytherin table, by Draco’s right, was taken by a very chatty Nott. Pansy and Blaise were at their usual seats, but both were looking down and keeping to themselves. Hermione searched for Luna, she was seldom at the Ravenclaw table so it was quite hard to spot her… there, she was whispering something to Ginny and Neville at the Gryffindor table.
That he felt lonely.
They stepped outside at the same time and saw Hagrid, cradling a bundle in his arms. At his sides and behind him, rows upon rows of Death Eaters advanced, masks off and smiling, as if they had already won the war. Draco located his parents at the same time that they saw him, but he couldn’t think of a way to get to them. Just then, McGonagall cried out:
“Did you manage to listen in?” she whispered. “Did they figure out they’re meant for one another?”
. He’d been thinking about Potter while Dorcas talked to him. Why?
This Potter was far more serious than the one he’d met a few minutes ago. He looked several years older, too, as did Evans. Curiously enough, it wasn’t his height that gave out the difference in years, but rather the severe expression on his face. If there was one thing Draco was good at, it was recognising the weight of war in a Potter’s expression, and it was painfully obvious that the one in front of him knew pain and fear intimately.
There was no one else nearby, so the girl, whoever on Earth she was, was talking to him. Draco stared back, hoping the panic simmering in his veins wasn’t reflected on the face of the girl whose body he seemed to have possessed—Marlene.
“How’d you know I’d take it tonight?” It’d been almost a week since he’d bought it, during their last Hogsmeade trip. He couldn’t even begin to comprehend how Potter had known where to Apparate to in order to follow him, but the fact he’d known exactly when Draco would take it? That was just…
He groans, loud and long and unrestrained, as Draco slowly, oh so slowly pushes in, making his nerve endings vibrate and his chest heave and his body
How long since he’d realised that even his Slytherin classmates looked at him in askance?
“Mm,” Draco mumbles.
As he made his way up to the statue that led to the Headmaster’s office, Draco went through the last memories he could recall from before he woke up in the Hogwarts grounds.
What if Dumbledore recognised him the same way Myrtle had? What if he looked Marlene in the eye and was capable of seeing the boy that would one day be an accomplice of his murder?
“And you,” Draco said, not sure whether he should stand up.
Potter appeared from behind the sinks. He was wearing his pyjamas, and his hair was pointing in every direction. The bags under his eyes were a perfect reflection of the ones Draco had seen in the mirror just a few minutes before.
“I’m here to talk with Myrtle, not with you. I’ve got nothing to say to you.”
“Why wouldn’t I recognise my friend?”
His parents began to walk again, escorted by the aurors, but he remained frozen. He couldn’t keep going. His legs began to shake, a yell formed in his throat, and for a moment he thought that he was going to cry.
“Whatever it is you wanted to remember this time is probably gone for good,” Harry says.
But something wasn’t right.
Time and time again, he saw Dumbledore fall from the Astronomy tower, dead at Snape’s hands, unable to defend himself because Draco had disarmed him. He could remember Potter’s words, saying that all of that had been planned by Dumbledore himself, but that didn’t make him feel any less guilty.
Merlin, that’d been hard to say.
“Why are we here, Professor? Did something happen?” asked Not-Quite-potter. “Because if those damned Death Eaters have wreaked havoc again, we can help. We’re only a couple of months away from graduating anyway—”
“Myrtle?”
. That thought brought back some sort of… memory. He didn’t have the chance to figure out what exactly it was; the feeling vanished as soon as it had appeared. But whatever it was, he knew it was important.
.” Draco felt like he was in his element. He knew he should be worried, but Salazar, he’d found an opportunity to whine about Potter and he’d be damned if he’d let it go to waste. Panicking could wait ten minutes.
*“Dumbledore’s death was planned!”*
“They're back!”
He’d barely turned the next corner when Dorcas stormed toward him.
Dorcas caressed his cheekbone with a thumb, oh so slowly, as though unsure she was allowed to be doing it.
“Leave me alone.” He strode forward and, this time, Myrtle didn’t follow.
“It didn’t take me that long!”
“Let’s go, brat, we don’t have all day.”
After what seemed like an eternity, they arrived on solid ground. Draco had his back to the island, but he didn’t want to turn around. He didn’t want to see the tower looming behind him.
He huffed. Spying on one’s own friends: classic Gryffindor behaviour.
A mop of black hair caught his eye, and Draco’s heart skipped a beat. He tried desperately not to think too hard about it as he turned, in time with the redhead, to face...
“No, I don’t know what I’m doing here,” he muttered when they were too far for the Gryffindors to hear. “Are you going to tell me what you know, or are you just here to torment me?”
Malfoy sounds exhausted. Defeated. He sounds like he has no fight—no spark, no life—left in him.
The hallway was deserted save for Potter and Lily, who were standing in front of the statue that led to Dumbledore’s office. They must’ve left together with Marlene and Dorcas, and Marlene must’ve then scurried behind the column Draco was now spying their conversation from.
Someone’s fingers tangled between his in his lap, distracting him from his thoughts. A teary-eyed Dorcas shared an intimate glance with him and, her lips too close to his ear, murmured, “It’s so incredible we’re here, don’t you think?” When Draco just nodded, she went on, “I don’t think you remember, but just a few years ago Lily was telling James she’d date the Giant Squid before him.”
A chill crept down his back when he heard Potter say his name. He felt people's gazes on him, but he didn’t care, because he was busy trying to understand everything that Potter was saying.
“Hello, Marlene, darling. It’s so good to see you too.”
“I am.”
A knot formed in his throat. Or maybe it wasn’t a knot, but rather a serpent that coiled inside his body. The pressure extended toward his stomach, flooding his lungs, and, for a moment, he forgot to breathe.
“Can’t it wait?”
Dorcas’ hand left his to rest on Draco’s waist in a weirdly tender way. Startled, Draco looked at her so brusquely his neck cracked and his head spun and spun. This wasn’t right—heads didn’t spin this much just from… oh. Okay. He was travelling through time again, wasn’t he?
“Are you going to teach us?”
, toward the man sprawled on top of him and breathing raggedly close to his ear.
. Seriously, what kind of name is that?”
What an annoying voice. I was probably his mother. Or Theo, trying to get him up in time for breakfast. But he didn’t want to wake up just yet. All he wanted was to be back in Diagon Alley, enjoying his mint ice cream without a care in the world.
, Potter! Or rather, hello, Mr
As soon as Marlene’s body crossed the threshold, however, Draco felt a pull in his chest. He fell behind, feeling as though he was floating, floating, too dizzy to open his eyes. As though he was trapped in the split instant of an Apparation.
That had been his first kiss.
, was the only thought Draco could process before Lily Evans’ shout filled the silence of the room.
“God, how I wish I could erase his existence from my memory. Can you imagine? Urgh, he drives me crazy. He thinks he’s the centre of the bloody universe, and I’m sure he doesn’t even know how to use a bloody microwave!”
A sound like a roar came from the limits of the school, and, soon, a giant appeared before them. The other giants attacked and the Death Eaters broke rank. Draco had only looked away for a moment, but when he looked back at the ground, Potter’s body wasn’t there anymore.
Draco seems to take a few seconds to process Harry’s words, blinking difficultly up at the ceiling. And then he brings his hand close to his eyes, squinting up at it, and mutters, “Fuck.”
He could already see the door. He headed toward it, but when he was a few meters away, he came face to face with McGonagall. He raised his hands and cowered, terrified, but she didn’t attack him. Instead, she opened her mouth and started to say something, but her words were lost, drowned out by the Dark Lord’s, whose voice reverberated all around.
His mother held him tighter by the arm, and a second, more intense chill ran through his body. He'd just heard the Dark Lord say that he was going to kill him. In that moment, Draco hoped more than ever that Harry Potter really was the Chosen One. It was his only chance.
“Oi, you, snap out of it!” the auror that had mocked him yelled. Draco tried to take a deep breath to stop shaking, but he could barely bring in any air.
“I said I don’t want to—!”
They stayed there. Draco had thought that they would try to escape, but, apparently, surrender was their only option if they didn’t want to spend the rest of their lives in Azkaban.
They couldn’t be. They may have ended up together and conceived the bloody saviour of the magical world, but that didn’t mean… did it?
-ing himself, and the mere idea was so tempting it made terror and anxiety build in his chest again.
Draco didn’t reply. He could feel the anxiety building in his chest, and all he wanted was to leave. To go back to his world, even if there was nothing for him in it, and to stop thinking about everything he was seeing. He had nothing to learn from this place, and everything it was causing him to want, everything it was causing him to long for, were things he would never have.
Maybe because he’d just seen his parents declaring their love for one another.
Like they were heedless to the fact Potter had become a shadow of himself. Like it wasn’t obvious that Potter carried ghosts within his eyes.
“Look at you,” he says, slipping the tip of a thumb
“You know this could go terribly wrong, don’t you?”
“Yes.”
“That thing you call
“Please, just leave me alone.”
Dorcas looked around them, and Draco did, too, suddenly nervous. They were completely alone.
And they waited. Everyone was busy reuniting with their family and friends, and for a moment no one paid them any attention. Draco saw someone carrying the Dark Lord’s body away.
“Precisely.”
Harry rolls his eyes, mumbles, “I should never have introduced you to Muggle takeaway,” but grabs his phone anyway and complies.
, nerve endings flaring, cock twitching against their bedsheets.
The dementors were back.
He didn’t want to think about what his stupid dream had meant. He couldn’t afford to. Instead, he rolled out of bed and walked into the bathroom he shared with Theo, barely opening his eyes. He felt his way around for the tap and dipped his head under the freezing stream of water.
Dumbledore searched them carefully over his glasses, and Draco busied himself looking at Potter to avoid his gaze.
Draco was wearing a skirt. He could feel a breeze between his legs. And he had… he glanced down and, horrified, confirmed his suspicion. He had
A woman approached the Malfoys with a look of contempt, and signaled at the aurors to follow her.
Myrtle zoomed off, saying, “We may be friends, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to tell you!”
Myrtle floated around him, looking him over as she said, “Seriously? I couldn’t tell! You’re as ravishing as always.” Cackling, she swiped her ice-cold hand down Marlene’s long hair. “Don’t worry, you’re not stuck. You don’t remember now, but you’re here by choice. A pretty stupid choice, if you ask me!”
“What’d she want?”
*“Harry Potter has died. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you all lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the boy who lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.”*
“What do you think?” Myrtle crooned. Draco huffed and kept walking. “Just out of curiosity, how much have you figured out already?”
, he allows Draco in.
“I was talking about my parents. You can’t deny they were a lot like us.”
“Dump those three in cell 844. We’re going to need the space,” she said, her voice dripping with disdain.
“I really like you,” Dorcas said. “And… I know technically we’ve been dating for a while, but I wanted you to know I’m glad to be with you. However long this might last.”
In slow motion, Not-Quite-Potter raised a shaky hand and caressed the space between the doe’s ears. With his other hand, he gripped his wand and murmured, “
“Expelliarmus!”
Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk. One glance in his direction was enough for Draco to want to cry, and a second one made him want to run away. But he kept his composure. That was one of his specialities, after all.
“But it’s true; in this world we are friends. We’re that and so much more, and no one thinks it’s weird.” Her fingers closed around his tightly. “I don’t know about you, but I’d like to make the most of it while it lasts.”
The thought came by without his permission, and Draco grew hot. His damn dress was so tight he couldn’t breathe—couldn’t even think straight.
“Wait,” he murmurs. Malfoy doesn’t look up. “Listen, can…can we stay together a little longer? Please?”
“Potter?” Draco spluttered. This girl knew Potter? And referred to him by his surname? And what was that about a toilet lid prank? Draco was sure he would’ve been the first to find out if Potter had gotten in trouble again. He always was.
They doze off bathed by the light of the evening sun.
“Of course! I know I’ve gotten older since the last time we saw each other, but I didn’t think it was that grave!”
Evans left the room, quickly followed by that strange version of Potter, whom the teacher had called as well. They were back merely a moment afterwards, and Draco did what he guessed was appropriate for a close friend to do:
“Don’t you
Draco pressed his eyes shut as something in his chest shattered into a million pieces.
That voice. Salazar, Draco hadn’t realised just how much he’d missed that voice. His dad’s had been quite similar, yeah, but… there was
“Draco, about what I said in the dream—”
The boy that he had envied for years for his fame; the boy that had left his body full of scars, the boy that had just saved his life in the Room of Requirement, was gone. The war was over and Voldemort would rule.
Patting Dorcas’ face one last time, Mrs Evans walked away. Dorcas let herself fall back beside him on the bench.
When he decides to stay at Hogwarts for the winter holidays, the last thing he expects is for Malfoy to be the only other Eighth Year in the castle.
Time and time again, he found himself back at the dining table at Malfoy Manor, watching, frozen, as a giant serpent sunk its teeth into the Muggle Studies professor until she bled to death, cheered on by his aunt Bellatrix.
No. Draco would’ve loved for that to be the explanation, but knew he’d be lying to himself if he believed it. It’d been Dorcas. Something about her had caught the attention of that dark, deep part of Draco’s mind that was reserved only for Potter. Maybe it was the Gryffindor scarf, or the determination in her eyes...
“Er, can you do that? I—” He stuttered when Evans just stared at him, startled. “I have to use the loo.”
It seemed as though the wavelengths of its sound reverberated in the vacuum when the voice spoke again.
“Seriously? I think they make a great couple,” Dorcas interrupted his train of thought. She was smiling like a lunatic; like this whole situation caused her immense joy. “Not as great as you and I, though, if you want my opinion.”
They walked up the stairs in silence. Draco, realising his hands were shaking, tucked them in his pockets.
Draco remembered. Remembered not wanting to return to his Eighth Year but having no choice. Remembered thinking moving on was pointless, terrifying, painful.
’s his broom and takes off without a thought. When Malfoy arrives at the broom cupboard under the stands, Harry’s already there.
Draco was beginning to relax, at the realisation that everything was over, and that he was safe, when a group of aurors approached and surrounded them. He followed his parents’ example and kept his head down, didn’t look any of the witches and wizards in the eye as the aurors told them to get up, and cuffed them with magic. They took away the wand his father had stolen and came over to take Draco’s and his mother’s as well, and found that, as they had said, they didn’t have any. Then the aurors took them out of the castle and walked with them to the limits of Hogwarts, where they disapparated.
if we are to have a chance against them.”
“Evans, wait.”
“Lower your voice, they can still hear you!” she giggled. “Although now I think about it, it would be hilarious if they did…”
Harry smiles. “Fancy a game, then?”
Draco nodded, tense. He didn’t have time to reply; a moment later, they were walking into the office.
“I’m so happy to know the war hasn’t managed to tear the two of you apart,” she said. “I don’t just worry about my own kid, you know? You two are like daughters to me. You were always such happy kids, and oh, you’ve always been such good friends I can’t imagine you without the other. Promise me you’ll take care of each other and you won’t let the war change you, okay?”
He didn’t cross paths with anyone in the halls, so it must’ve been later—or earlier—than he’d assumed. Even so, Draco moved silently through the castle and resolutely pushed open another bathroom door.
“What’s that?”
“Well, the dream was meant to teach you something, wasn’t it? That’s what the dealer said.”
“But I’d like a second chance.” He stretches his hand out. “Please?”
hope you liked it <3
They climbed into a lift heading toward the tower’s eighth floor, and walked out into a dark hallway that was even colder than the lobby of the tower. At the other side of the hallway, Draco saw a Dementor. A pang of hopelessness gripped him at that instant, and once again, he thought that he wouldn’t be able to stay on his feet.
Draco sat down on the ground in the corner and immediately pulled his knees up to his chest. His mother sat by his side and made an attempt to hug him, but he didn’t return it. His father, on the other hand, began to pace from one side of the cell to the other.
“No,” Draco lied. “And they’re
“Yeah, I think so. It… It was quite shocking to find out in front of my friends and the Headmaster, I won’t lie.”
Harry sighs.
He remembered, one by one, all the times that he had disapointed his father: from the Quidditch games that he hadn’t won to the moment he’d had to torture a mudblood with the Cruciatus curse for the first time before the eyes of the Dark Lord. He hadn’t been able to cast the curse. He remembered the girl’s screams when, threatened with torture himself if he couldn’t cast it, he managed the curse. And it made him scream as well.
Draco panicked. He had no idea who Dorcas was.

“Very much so,” Draco beams down at him.
was a conversation he definitely knew how to have.
On Christmas day, however, Malfoy heads to the Quidditch pitch. Harry
A moment went by, and then Draco slowly turned around. The determination he found in Potter’s eyes made him look down again. He didn’t feel ready for this conversation.
When they arrived at the doors of the tower, which were metallic and appeared heavy, two of the aurors went forward in order to open them.
They also took a photo of his mother, and then brought them to a cell. With the three of them inside, the aurors shut the door and left, some sending one last look of disgust back toward them.
“Miss Evans, could I speak with you for a moment?”
When the class was over, Evans grabbed his arm and leaned in to whisper, “The message Prewett received was from Dumbledore. He wants to see James and I in his office for something Order-related. It’s the perfect chance to tell him you’re on our side too.” She glanced around, making sure no one was paying attention to them, and added, “Tell Dorcas to come with too.”
He didn’t want to admit it, but the truth was he envied Lily Evans.
“Evans!”
Draco scowled. How much longer was he going to be stuck in this goddamn place?
His dream.
A feeling of not being really home. Of being lost.
He continued talking, undoubtedly gloating over the death of Potter, who Hagrid had deposited on the ground. He began to duel Longbottom, and managed, somehow, to get a hold of the Sorting Hat. But Draco couldn’t understand anything that he was saying. He could only hear the whirlwind of thoughts that was threatening to bring him to his knees. He would have to be a death eater for his whole life. He would have to be cruel, and kill, and torture, and pretend that he enjoyed it all until the day he died.
“Are you quite happy with yourself?” he groans.
He stepped back, but didn’t try to walk away again. He couldn’t. Not without finding out what Potter wanted from him.
“Lily.” Potter was playing with his hair incessantly. “I think we should talk about what just happened… A-Are you okay?”
As quickly as the feeling had taken over, it vanished, and Draco fell, turning and turning, and, again, opened his eyes in a body that wasn’t his.
“I’ll tell you at the end of the lesson,” Evans murmured.
Draco swallowed, feeling weird all over. He wanted to run away, but this was so unexpected he was paralysed, and the only thing he could do while the girl touched his face and looked him in the eye was focus on his breathing. He had to stay calm. He was in another time and place. In a dream. Everything would come to nothing when he woke up, so he had nothing to worry about.
What did she mean, Draco had chosen to be here? There was no way she was telling the truth—he’d
The auror that had brought him twisted his arm to force him up. Draco got to his feet and left the boat, but the abrupt movement made his head spin. He’d barely gotten to the sand when he turned his head to the side and vomited.
The Dark Lord and the Gryffindor looked at each other with gazes full of hatred and began to duel.
When the Dememtors moved away from his cell, and he finally had a moment to think without being forced to relive his worst experiences, Draco only could think one thing: I deserve to be here. I deserve to rot in Azkaban. I’m a death eater. I attacked the Boy Who Lived for years. I served the Dark Lord. I did nothing to stop all of the evil that happened around me. I deserve to be here….

“Let us know if you need anything else,” Ron offered. She gave them a strange look and walked off through a corridor labeled
“I’ll show you how to rework the wards,” she said, pulling him along the asphalt with her big blue umbrella at her side, ready for whenever the inevitable rain decided on falling. Harry had noticed on Sunday with a great sense of irony that the front door had no handle.
“Hello,” someone said softly, knocking on the door as they opened it. A witch in pastel pink robes stepped in, long blonde hair hanging in a ponytail. “Ron said he’s awake?”
gotten off of. “You had a pleasant time, I think. Do you feel dizzy? Nauseous?”
“Pardon?” Draco asked, sharply.
He stood, walking slowly to the other end of the room. His legs felt fine, not at all wobbly. “So I’m free to go?” His arms had old, faded scars dotted across them. Made sense for an Auror.
“Alright. See you.” He hesitated at the door, watching Draco gather a few books together, stumbling slightly. “Last night was a good time.”
“Erm,” he said, but she was already leaning over the back of her seat to address her mother.
“Get up.” He stood, still looking around.
“Mr. Potter! What are you doing on this side of the castle?” Harry looked up at the ghost floating near the top of the hall, peering down at them over a ruffled collar. “Is there not important Ministry business to attend to?”
when he got here.”
“S’Fine,” Ron gasped, straightening up. “Worse than a Portkey, eh, Harry?”
"If you had to guess," he added blithely, pushing his untouched tea over as an afterthought.
“Do you know where they entered?” Ron asked.
“Whenever you’re there next is…is fine.” She slumped back, lifeless, like her work was finally done. “It’ll all be fine.”
“In this case.”
Harry tapped out so Charlie could have a turn, walking over to the table on wobbly legs. A warming charm washed over him as he drew near and sat on the ground next to Hermione. Fleur had a blanket spread for Victoire to crawl about on.
The first place he looked was in the bread box. There was a white loaf inside, fresh despite the lack of packaging.
“Finding an apartment in London?” He rolled his eyes. “No idea.”
is turning out to be a bit more error than trial. I need it back.”
He wondered what Teddy was doing. Then he fell asleep.
“He brought up…” she paused, wincing. “He apologized to me, when I was there Saturday. For everything that happened at the Manor.”
“You’re not wrong. But he’s fine, really. McGonagall wouldn’t let anything happen to him.”
“I had an intern do it,” she said defensively. Harry didn't believe her. “But yes. One mistake. And I don’t think we can afford any mistakes.”
“Is that supposed to smell like that?” Harry asked, nodding to the cauldron.

He looked up at Harry. Then he looked at the drawing.
She shook her head. “You don’t get it. Catching Dolohov is all you have cared about for the past ten years.”
“You’ll walk straight up the central staircase and to the left,” he said in a low voice, frowning at a button. “The library is past the Beryl Conservatory. Large mahogany door. All you need to do is say the name of the book you’re after. Understood?”
“You don’t want to go back.”

He didn’t bother with a drying charm on his hair. The water soaked into his pillow as he drew the blankets up, holding his wand tightly. This wand knew him very well. It anchored him. In the darkness, he murmured
“He said something about a trial?”

“Harry!”
“The Leaky Cauldron.”
George sat, letting his tea steep. Again, something had changed. He was more drawn into himself up here. Or just sober. “Weasley products are officially banned. Then again, Flitwick ordered thirty Headless Hats for his class just last week, so…” He shrugged. “Foot in the door, and all that.”
She stood in the center of the room, arms crossed, face set in stone. “We need to talk.”
“So it was better, in some ways. You were completely different at work. Ruthless, one might say, and that would be saying it nicely. I did my best to just...back you up where I could. But I worried. Sometimes it was like...”
Ron’s face fell slightly. “Oh. Well, I’d rather you…” he stood up, pacing in what small space allowed it. “There are Death Eaters after us. You, specifically. What if you can’t defend yourself? What if you forget to be on your guard, just for a second?”
Harry didn’t very much trust George’s tea supply. Possibly charmed to turn his tongue to taffy, and of course all loose-leaf. He pushed aside the boxes and picked a harmless-looking can of Lavender. “It seems like you’re doing well. No need to make more trouble for yourself. Wasn’t the Hogwarts thing bad enough?”
“I’ve…been doing research,” she whispered, picking at the fur behind Buck’s ears. “Could you make tea?”
“I’ll go first,” Harry said, ignoring the really very fetching spots of color on Draco’s cheeks. “Since I’ve got my wand.”
It took her a moment to respond. Her arms had wrapped themselves tightly around her torso. “Wizarding school. It’s where we all went.”
“Not bad,” she said, kicking her bare feet in the air. “But
When nothing revealed itself, he walked backwards and shut the door. Draco was looking around the floor almost frantically. Trying to help, Harry opened his mouth to
It was meant as a joke, but she only nodded tersely, catching his hand as he turned away. “Wait.”
Harry retreated to the corridor, and then down the steps to the parlor. There was still a fair amount of smoke when he opened the door and Summoned the Cloak, but it was nearly scentless.
Blue eyes moved over his face, anger turning soft. “The last time you had a feeling about Malfoy, you thought he might be becoming a Death Eater. And you were right.”
Harry finished up the signatures and took the papers to the Ministry. Dean and Seamus saw him in the hall, stopping for a brief conversation about the missing Kneazel. Apparently it had been found making a nest underneath some Dumpsters in Side Ward.
“Thanks,” she murmured, taking a mug from him. Buck had disappeared. “You didn’t see me yesterday, you know.”
He knocked on the plain door between the edible soap display and a stacked set of boxes with pictures of a tarantula on front. There was a slam, a clattering rush of footsteps, and George pulled the door open breathlessly.
“…Alright. I think I can manage that.” He’d been expecting a flat out refusal of his offer, now he found himself tasked with going all the way to West End. “When do you have to start up with the potion again? Tonight?”
When they got to the end of the war, and Harry’s extremely heroic defeat of Voldemort, he almost couldn’t take in any more information. He got the gist – he wasn’t
“What do you mean?” Ron pulled his draft back over (correspondence with the German Head Auror, written under Harry’s name for information on some case or another), making some last marks.
“Just let me know the next time you go,” she said, frowning at black pair of socks. “There are places to get clothes that are less hideously expensive than Twilfit’s.”
“Could be. I feel like McGonagall knows more than she’s letting on.”
It was a cruel thing to say, and not even true, but Ron choked so dramatically on his brew half the bar looked over.
Teddy only nodded, pulling away as someone called his name from far off. Reena was standing at the entrance to one of the castle’s many courtyards, waving. They both waved back.
The menagerie looked interesting. He’d be sending Todd the Owl back to Hogwarts that night, but even then he probably didn’t have a pet for good reason. An allergy or something he didn’t know about.

“Twenty-seven,” she supplied, frowning. “Who is the Prime Minister?”
Her eyes narrowed. “Traded what?”
“You think a Death Eater’ll formally ask you to duel?” Ron cast another curse. Harry blocked it, managing to get in a Sponge-Knee curse. Ron blocked that as well, but he too was knocked back a step. “No. They’ll do whatever it takes to kill you.”
“Certainly not mine.” Ron pushed up and rustled around the fridge for a minute, returning with a bottle of vinegar. “How was your trip, eh? Get the letter sent off?”
Ron’s eyebrows rose sharply. “You went to the
“Hagrid’s a friend,” George said, like Harry should have known. “And Albne’s a centaur.”
Draco turned the corner just as Harry had shoved the book back onto its shelf. He looked harried, like he’d just escaped something horrible.
George waved his wand about, and a white cloud drifted up to them, taking the form of a small monkey.
“No need.” He spun on his heels, clicking his tongue. “Though we
“I haven’t seen you two go at it like this in quite some time,” she said miserably, crossing her arms. Harry and Ron looked at each other, then away.
Ron nodded, tucking in. “Muggle. Near the Ministry.”
“Yes.”
“I don’t doubt it.” But he would be other things. Depressed, alone, ruthlessly determined on work and work alone.
“Sure you don’t wanna call it a day?” Dean asked as Harry went to the shelves of weighted barbells. These Auror weights were particularly awful – charmed to become incrementally heavier as the lifter’s stamina decreased.
“And the Minister for Magic?”
“Pardon?”
If they’d had another minute to themselves, what would Draco have said? What would he have
“Old,” he said, turning away as he re-dressed.
“’Mione!” Ron called, waiting on the back porch. He didn’t come closer.
“No!” He said, alarmed at the naked panic in Teddy’s voice. “
It all happened the same, only this time he kept his foot in as his house whizzed by, stepping out capably into the Grimmauld Place parlor.
“And?” He frowned as Harry got distracted again. “You’re not doing that right. Give me.”
Ron glanced up, troubled. “Yeah, it’s…”
“What?” He had just been wrinkling his nose again, a childish expression of distaste.
. “Okay,” he nodded. “Now?”
“Do you think it’s possible Dolohov did this on accident?”

Draco closed his eyes tightly, and let go of Harry’s arm. “You should go.”
Ron punctuated their silence with a snore.
Élise flipped it open, finding a page near the back and pushing it back to Ron. “There. Once he drinks the potion, anyone with the Mark will know what he’s done. They’ll be connected long enough for him to – “
Draco looked around, face blank. His eyes seemed to halt on Harry for a second longer than anyone else. He looked in the region of Harry’s tie, and Harry hoped – irrationally – that Draco hadn’t seen the paper that morning. He also wished he’d taken some tidying charms to himself after the dueling.
“Ron.”
Draco looked petrified, arms splayed out, chest heaving.
“Are you my owl?” Harry cut a cube of apple and set it on the other side of the table. The owl hopped down and snapped it up. “What’s your name, hm? You look like a…like a Todd.”
“Well, that wasn’t convincing at all,” Ron said, a delicate shade of green as they climbed out of the statue steps. The temperature had dropped, clouds thickening in the sky. “You let me talk way too much.”
,” Ron sighed. Harry shut up gratefully. “You never wear Auror robes.”
“Well.” Draco exhaled indulgently. “Assuming I found a ticket, and assuming I made it through the wards…someone could try to kill me, women and children would run screaming, foreign Ministries would pull funding from the League – “
“What,” Draco hissed under his breath, “are you
“Practice all you like,” he said blandly. “Stay away from this one.”
, so he popped into an alley off Langely Street, enjoying the short walk to the restaurant that he had also had to search up in the directory closest to his house. His thoughts turned to the night ahead, trying to shake off the fight and how uneasy it had made him.
Potter reached up, gripping the man’s shoulder with every ounce of strength he had. Shadowed eyes narrowed. “Don’t let them take me.”
“What – “ Harry started. Hermione grabbed his elbow, tugging him along with her as she left. “Wait. Ron – “
“What is it?” Ginny asked. He looked up at the sky. The moon was big. Waxing gibbous.
time,” he huffed. “You need sleep.”
He didn’t feel depressed, but clearly that had been a long struggle. Overwhelmed and anxious, yes. Not quite…depressed.
Harry pondered that. He didn’t know much about Legilimency. Maybe he would look for a book the next time he went to Diagon Alley.
Castor swayed at his full height, nearly three feet off the ground and waist-high with a terrified Draco Malfoy. “
When the wind really started buffeting at him, he knew he’d gone as high as this broom would allow. Leaning back into a hovering stop, he looked directly down at the house – a strange beast of a house, it was – and the trees, and even the town a little ways off. George was a pinprick, walking out the center of the field and laying on the grass to watch them.
Once, he went to her and Ron’s place and cleaned while they were at work. He was frustrated at the ancient rug in his living room and how it resisted any form of upholstery charm. He half wondered what would happen if he stuck it back in Grimmauld Place, where it had come from. Would it miraculously become good as new?
As was custom around other Ministry workers, he hunched his shoulders and tried to look appropriately glum while she and Ron made pleasantries. There was an Apparition point in the Old Bank of London, just two blocks away from The Maughan Library on King’s College campus.
as a direct source, when not even Durmstrang has a copy.”
“And gave Draco’s back to him?”
believe that worked.”
“I believe you,” Harry muttered. Apparently he was quite the public menace. “Should I pay it back?”
“Didn’t believe us, did you?”
Suddenly, her eyes widened. “Harry. Don’t – “
Harry
“We never do the same thing twice. Most places add their own touch, as well. Sides, Shield Wizards running to every school and business’ll put the whole city in a panic.”
“I, Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Head Auror of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and Third Chair to the Hogwarts Board of Governors…” He looked over his shoulder, grimacing. “That’s quite a mouthful.”
“I expect it to get worse the closer we come to the Quiet Moon,” he continued, with a grimace that hollowed out his cheeks and made his eyes more shadowed. The Mark disappeared beneath his sleeve as he tugged it back down. “Nature won’t take kindly to what I’m doing.”
Teddy frowned harder. “What?”
“Draco!”
“If you like. Food might get cold.” Harry turned down the alley he always Apparated to and from. “We can walk past the shops at Westminster, they’ve really gone all out – “

“I’d rather rob Gringotts,” he muttered. “
He left before midnight, but only just. Lee insisted he used the Floo, which he only agreed to because they were sure the Leaky would only be more crowded than it had been before. They were still looking for one of the escaped doxies when he stepped into the green flames, muttering his address and bracing for the feeling of his stomach dropping out.
“What? What is it?”

him. Anymore. He’s just to stay in the city until we’ve got your side of the story.”
Harry almost didn’t understand, then remembered all at once that yes, Hermione was still supposed to be working on that. On getting his brain back together. The agreement they’d come to was unofficial at best.
“It makes you shit yourself,” Harry guessed. George snapped his mouth closed. “Explosively. Absolutely not.”
He left Grimmauld Place in a daze – avoiding the parlor and strolling out to the street. Draco had agreed to dinner with him. Well, dinner
He didn’t bother asking for an explanation. “Do you know where Sirius’ room is?”
Interesting.
Harry nodded, sitting opposite Ron on the plush carpet. Neither of them spoke while Ron set up the board. He was working himself up to something, Harry knew. His eyebrows kept drawing tightly together, then he’d sigh and shake his head.
Ron gripped his hand and pulled it up, their fists raised like champions at a boxing match. It was
“To test me.”
Clearly, this was a serious question. But the name sparked absolutely nothing in him. When he shook his head, a little line started forming between her eyebrows. He shifted uncomfortably, feeling like a very disappointing student.
Draco let go of him. Harry could actually see the grass move as it was crushed under his invisible feet. “This way,” he said, and appeared with a flourish. The cloak shimmered into view as he held it away from his body, toward Harry. It had messed up his hair.
“Yes. Draco Malfoy.”
Harry set the vial just to the side, where Draco would see it, and turned his head at a noise from downstairs. Coughing. A door slamming shut.
Harry stared at a photo of Ron and Bill with Victoire sitting near the window. It had been the most draining day yet. First Hogwarts, which made him feel better and worse, then a blundering meeting with Neville. Nice enough guy, but he wasn’t in on the secret. Harry had tried his best to be surly, and sure enough Neville hadn’t caught on to anything amiss.
Hermione went perfectly still, eyes shining. Strong magic, she said – not Dark.
The penmanship was as clumsy as the other one, with a suspicious brown stain across the lower half. Harry was already smiling as he read.
His hair color changed throughout. Sometimes it was red, or brown (depending, Harry assumed, on who’d he spent the day with), but as he got older things made a turn for the primary. Unlike the photos in his office, he looked happy. He smiled with Teddy.
Office number 105 had a little nameplate on the door. Harry knocked.
“Flash-forward to the 1970’s, and this…man…comes to power. Only he’s not quite a man, but I’ll get to that. He and a load of his followers – Death Eaters – start trying to spread this pureblood-supremacy shite. It was horrible. They infiltrated the Ministry, used Imperious on the most influential people…you can imagine.
“Draco – “
‘him’.”
“What is it?” Draco asked without looking up.
He was reluctant to let it go, even for the amount of time it would take to go to his apartment, wherever that was. The room outside was large, bustling with people in pink and blue robes. Words and memos moved quickly overhead to their various destinations.
“Am I getting through to you?” He asked, feeling quite desperate himself. “Or do you need more?”
Draco looked down at the tea like he was seeing it for the first time, then back up at Harry, eyes tracking over his face like he was searching for something. “That…” he said slowly, “is an exceedingly personal question.”
“Ah.” This didn’t bode well. “Well, I’d better be off.”
“Thank you,” he said. The goblin – Rocknor, was it? – sniffed through a small, flat nose and turned on his heel. Fleur rolled her eyes behind his back.
She pulled the blanket back and deposited the book in Harry's lap.  “Could you take this to him?”
Harry shook his head, idly trying to scoop escaped sludge into Victoire’s mouth for the third time. “Said she’d set it on fire if I opened it before she left – oh,
“He’s also a professor,” she corrected, which was some news to Harry. “And when we were first years, he hatched a dragon egg in his house

“The tree stops whenever a name is burned,” Draco was saying, still on Andromeda’s name. “Had it continued, you would see her muggle husband, Edward Tonks.”
“I know,” Teddy sniffed, and it sounded wet. “You’re an adult.”
“Yeah. Bit hard to sell, and anyone who’d want it must be dodgy.”
Her hair was braided into a shining plait over one shoulder. Looking at her for too long was difficult, but he saw her smile as he focused on a photo of Victoire.
“The crying.”
“Yes,” Hermione smiled, already steering him toward the lift. “And biscuits. You’re welcome.”
“Alright,” Harry chewed the end of the sugar quill. “We’ll go this weekend. One way or another.”
Teddy looked up, and then behind them, where the others lagged. Luna was still lecturing Hermione about her horoscope, and Ron was making some acrobatically boggled expressions at Neville. “
. Hornets.”
“Do be patient,” Draco admonished, a hint of real irritation behind his words. “Every Death Eater that’s died will stay dead. The Dark Lord wasn’t so interested in binding us as he was in the control.”
It was a kitchen. The table was long, the room as overwhelming as the other had been. Every surface – walls, tables, counters – was lined and dripping with trinkets. Food, photos, books, newspapers, works of child-like art. One had a brown and black scribble that he guessed was meant to be a chocolate pie.
Debra sounded even more stoic after Élise’s quick, Belgian accent. “She makes it sound easier than it was. One spell alone took everything out of you, and then you had to do it again. For
When Molly started sniffling, Arthur closed up the albums and called it a night.

sort of way. Harry smiled at her.
Ron finally lowered his wand. “This research. You’ll give it to us?”
In full dark, they cast glowing charms on their clothes and on the Quaffle. Light gathered down by the shed, and Harry saw that the rest of the party had migrated out. Someone had levitated a table and chairs so they could all sit and watch the game. Laughter broke out every now and then from the audience as George sent random groups of bright red sparks that they all had to dodge and blink out of their vision.
“Like this, you mean?” Harry’s voice had turned stern without him deciding. “

was his best friend? He rather seemed like an arse.
“Okay.”
“’Auror-trained’?” He repeated, confused.
“What is?”
“Well, good morning,” he stuttered, hating this feeling. “How long was that?”
The possibility shocked him a bit. “I dunno. Am I?”
There were four other people. Two men and two women. All staring, naturally.
“This Tesco’s?” Harry asked, in the middle of writing a letter to Teddy. He set the parchment and pad on the coffee table, pulling the closest paper edge down to look at the piles of crap food inside. “They have a sale on?”
“Proth…setics?”

“Wake
“What happened?” Harry asked. Draco jumped when he spoke, the dark purple rings beneath his eyes making him appear even cagier than was obvious. “Where’s your wand?”
A week later, Hermione was – big surprise – at Harry’s house. She came right in through the front door and set a heavy brown bag on his coffee table, breathless from the cold.
The true scale of the room was hidden by the stacks. Ceiling high shelves, some protected by glass, stretched and turned in on each other. There was an armchair near the door, nestled between an empty table and a spindlier stand that had what looked like a cigar case on it. Two tall candleholders sat behind it, both lit by white flames.
“She’ll hardly notice the difference. Or care. But you and her have always gotten on
“He’s got you helping him test things, again?” Ron snorted. “He’ll use your lack of memory against you, you know.”
“In here,” he answered, looking nervous.
“Thanks.” He went in and turned on the light, shutting the door softly behind himself. This was his bedroom. This was where he slept every night. Of course, he didn’t recognize it, but the state of things didn’t make him feel any better.
“You can’t go in there. It’s cursed,” the stranger said tersely. Panicked. Afraid. His lit wand waved around a bit. Some of the worst cold went away. When he leaned in, his breath was sweet. Minty. “Listen to me, Potter. They’re going to think I did this to you. You

“Enjoying the quiet,” Harry retorted, not missing Ginny’s tiny, relieved breath.
Teddy tightened his grip on Harry’s sleeve. “Yes, Headmistress?”
“Yes.” Her voice managed to sound approving and reproachful all at once.
“Anything – ?”
Harry bit back a snort. “I had a great time with you and your friends.”
“No,” he murmured. “But it is the first time you’ve meant it.”
Ron’s expression went predictably taut. “He’s not in the logs. Besides, I doubt anyone but Zabini would want him here.”
to read the words near the ceiling.
“Why? You’ll have your memories back, soon enough. All this talking will have been for nothing, right?”
Despite Harry’s joke, the book looked very serious. It was relatively thin, but words were packed densely onto each page wherever there wasn’t a spindly diagram to look at. If this was the
When the door opened again, it was to admit a very large, very
“Need back up, Harry?” A goateed man with a Chudley Cannons tie called out. Horrifically, it looked like he meant it. One of the onlookers had poked their head into the office, drawing more witnesses.
“Dunno,” Harry muttered. “I tried to say –
“Thanks. I like you, as well.”
“Not this stuff – just think! We’re ubiquitous around campus. You know it’s being passed around – what if you could send your special tyke the
“I…I dreamed…” Draco’s voice was hoarse and cracked. He turned his face – just for a moment – into Harry’s touch. Then he blinked into himself and jerked his face away. Pain lanced across his features at the movement. “The time?”
They hadn’t gone past the second floor on Harry’s first visit. Hermione would have to show him which one belonged to Sirius. “I’ll do that.”
The liquid sloshed a bit from the movement. Slowly, she lowered the paper, expression blank as she folded it neatly back together.
“Ronald!”
Fantastic.
“Who’s George?”
It lowered its head, dropping to the floor and twisting around closer to the fire. Hermione released a massive breath as Harry got to his feet.
Dean tried to cover his laugh with a violent cough.
“Lovely to see you, Hagrid!”

had gotten a picture of you in Hogsmeade with ‘a mysterious blonde’ and Mum actually had the nerve to ask you about it.”
“…Right.” He helped her to her feet. “I hope that won't be necessary.”

In question, he looked up. Hermione’s lip trembled.
to be, for Teddy to write a letter so wonderfully…
Another shocked silence.
“Who is Tom Riddle?”
Ron glanced at Élise. "He's the one who killed Lupin. In the battle."
“He did something to me. We don’t really know what. But…”
The food was incredible. The House Elves – who looked nothing like Kreacher – were dreadfully nice, serving them plate after plate of whatever they wanted. Teddy practically buzzed with excitement at their little adventure. Ron ate more than Harry would have thought possible.
There had been two more ‘exposés’ done on him since the paisley disaster, both accusing him of a secret affair with different female Ministry employees. The ‘hopefuls’, as one Head Writer Brittany Barnesby wrote, were Romilda Vane of the Ludicrous Patents Office, Natalie McDonald from the Office of Misinformation, and, most upsettingly, Élise Smets the Auror.

“Only by a few hours.”
“I have to do this.” Measured, careful. Not meeting his eyes. “For the investigation.”
“Hey, Harry,” Hannah said, giving him a careful smile before casting a slurry of spells from the foot of his bed. Diagnostics, it looked like. Vague, uncomfortable feelings prodded along his body in time with her wand jabs. Words scribbled themselves across the air, darting down to the blank clipboard under her arm as she read them.
“Hm,” Harry hummed doubtfully, going on with the rest. Ron’s smile dropped away when he mentioned knowing Todrick’s name.
“Have you found an apartment?”
It was just that last, lingering look. Just before Harry passed out. It wasn’t a look of hate, or even of malice. Harsh words, yes, but with
After a moment of hesitation in the empty lift, he decided on going to Hermione first. Get this part over with. The black hallway was even creepier when he was alone; his relative confidence wavered as he approached the handle-less door.
Harry stepped past him and began climbing the winding set of steps. “Do you make
“For what?”
“So sorry,” George cut him off. “I believe there’s someone loitering just outside. Who’s there?!”
It was nestled at the bottom of the alcove, beside a stacked pile of trousers. Not very big at all, but ornate. Black stone engraved with runes that glowed the same color as the swirling contents.
There were other differences, of course. The house was renovating itself, so the formerly battered surface of the table was spotless and buffed, reflecting shades of crimson from the wallpaper. The china on the tallest shelves shone green and silver.
Now it was Harry’s turn to glare at Ron. “I think you’re wrong about him.”
She was worried about him. “I know that.”
“What were you doing in the city?”
By the time he'd read the thing front to cover, the light in the room had changed and his ankles were loudly protesting his crouched position.
hanging round her neck.
“Wiltshire.”
“Molly,” Ron’s mother finally said, her smile watery. “But you always call me Mrs. Weasley, no matter how many times I tell you not to.”
“Doesn’t Hermione bring you groceries?” He had to ask, gathering the empty containers and Scourgifying as Draco tossed them aside. “Where are those?”
,” Ron said, sounding genuine. “I shouldn’t get – I shouldn’t’ve said that. If you really want to…we can ask Malfoy for help.”
“This is a – “
Harry stared down at the odd peace offering, then dug through his own pockets. These were the same robes from Tuesday, weren’t they?
“I’m sure it must have been.”

“That one’s yours. Do whatever you have to do to get the Quaffle past it. This one’s mine, see?”
He turned to the second album, pointing out an image of the whole Weasley clan with Harry and a young Hermione pressed in on either side of Molly. “Where was this taken?”
“’arry,” Fleur said, sounding surprised and pleased. “Not at all. Please.”
“He will,” she said with odd certainty, moving to sit next to him. “Because you’re going to tell him I need to see this.”
“I reckon Ron rather fancies being in charge.” And there was nothing in the world he'd rather do than spend time with Teddy right now. Especially poring over dusty parchment. He gestured to the door. “Maybe you and Reena could give me a tour?”

“Everyone,
“And you have a vested interest in the opposite,” he snapped. She looked up with something like horror. “So make something up.”
He woke up the next morning to an irregular, insistent tapping. It took a minute to orient himself. Not just spatially, either – he had to recollect a rather scattered sense of self, first. Right. Harry Potter. And he was in Harry Potter’s house.
“Can’t even use a damn umbrella charm,” he muttered, kicking off his shoes. “Why we ever decided to live in a muggle neighborhood is beyond me.”
It was the first week that no one grilled Hermione and Ron on their progress with Harry’s memories. It was the first week no one remarked on it at all.
a golden, glittery quill had written in cursive on the bottom of the page. He frowned at it, and that’s about when he was interrupted.
“Good.” She pointed them to level two. The lift started a slow rise. “I think we made some real progress.”
The stranger finally broke his stare. “It took you quite long enough.”
It broke him, and soon they were both snickering.
, Victoire!”
Ron Apparated them to a place that looked remarkably like Diagon Alley. The buildings were all gray or white, but their windows burst with color. Warmth emanated from the protruding glass displays in the lower levels, and the lit candles in the upper ones. A very tame Diagon Alley.
He looked up, face full of curiosity and, more than that, trust. Trust that Harry was about to break. Nothing prepared him for how lost he felt
“Well, he’d just taken a Bludger to the head. He thought he was flying lower, but he just so happened to be heading straight for the Snitch. Broft just took him out to avoid a Cockney penalty.”
They walked up the steps. Harry looked around, trying to take in as much detail as he could. There weren’t many pictures around. The ones he did see didn’t give him anything new. It was mostly Hermione, Ron or Teddy.
“Top marks. Harry?”
Draco said nothing else as they reached the landing. Harry went to the first open door, finding a room much changed from the last look around he’d had. The empty bed frame was now a four poster, through the house’s interference or Draco’s. A fluffy green duvet stretched across, neatly made and probably not slept in for days.
“And I bet you and Hermione helped a lot,” Harry observed. Ron’s glumness brightened a little.
“Translations,” Harry said pointedly, looking up at Ron. “From Middle English.”
. That was a new one – though, if he thought about it, everyone had been comparing his attitude of late to that same era before the war. The war was what made him different, and who he had been ever since was the Harry they had struggled to love.
Harry. Because
“There you are,” Debra snapped, limping slightly. “Let’s get out of here.”
“A man.”
“Yeah. We didn’t really talk,” he lied. "It was awkward."
Sirius’ room. There had been some interesting books in there. Slipping quietly out of the parlor, he made his way upstairs, stopping at each landing to look around in consternation. It was spotless. All of it. The parlor was one thing, but Draco cleaning the entire house seemed far-fetched. Was there a House Elf here he didn’t know about?
Draco stuck his hand through the top and back out. One of the wasps sat on his index finger, wings flapping. Harry sucked in a breath.
He nodded, setting his shoulders in a way he hoped looked normal. “How are you?”
Not just any green, and not your run-of-the-mill silver. They were exactly Slytherin’s colors.
“See that you do. We’ll need to be far more discreet for your next visit.” As if to make her point, a group of students peeked around the end of the hall, chattering excitedly. Harry definitely heard his name. “Mr. Lupin.”
Ron,” Hermione exploded, and then just as quickly went hushed. “I’ve heard enough.”
“I already told her I can’t stay,” Draco went on. “You’re not her messenger, Friga. Just ignore her if you wish.”
“Have I put memories in there?”
Ron snorted. “You hexed a
Ron smiled guiltily. “Neither could I, being honest.”
Hermione’s sudden frown made him wonder if that was supposed to happen. “Not normal?” He asked, bracing for his limbs to start breaking off. “Did I mess it up?”
Draco stood, holding his hands out in front of him as he walked to the tap to wash them off.
He was still frowning when Harry looked up.
Harry decided against correcting him. It was as much George’s fault, anyway, for telling Teddy to do it.
Élise made a startled sound, and Seamus went green. Harry was missing something. “Rid of it?”
A shadow passed over them as the pan floated overhead and down, hovering above the empty plate and flipping the eggs once before dumping them down. It smelled incredible.
Draco smiled like he’d been caught. “A long time.”
She backed away, moving around him in a wide arc to open the shed. “Keep that rubbish away from me. They test us for that sort of thing, and the pre-season’s coming up. Besides, what was the point of the Giggle Gummies if you’re just going to smoke it?”
Ron opened his mouth, but Hermione walked out of the kitchen, looking at them curiously. Ron straightened up guiltily. Their whispered fight seemed to be over.
“I know,” Harry murmured. And he actually did – he had read some of that book Draco had given him. He just didn’t know it was
He didn’t calm down for what felt like hours, cycling through anger, helplessness, and finally plain dread. A temporary barrier. Had Hermione meant it? Or was it a bluff? Had she constructed the thing in the first place, so that this entire situation would drag on until she’d grown tired of it?
THAT, MISTER GRAMSBY – “
and he rushed out of the kitchen.
She looked up, biting her lip. “I’m an Unspeakable.”
Ron started laughing again, and after that the mood stayed light. They seemed to actually enjoy telling him about the nice, normal things. Every now and again, though, something innocuous would make them both clam up. Harry’s dating life, or lack of one, made them sad. He guessed it had something do to with his prolonged depression.
It was all hopelessly mixed up, with her. She seemed to know so much, and yet he had a good feeling she wasn’t above a healthy amount of manipulation. Her compassion, sure, he trusted that.
There. It was definitely a lie, but Harry could live with it. Ron worked through it with his expression, finally landing on baffled. “What’s it like?”
He didn’t think Draco expected him to ask that. The tops of his cheekbones turned the lightest shade of pink, his eyes taking on a far-off look. “It was surface level. I asked you who you were, to see if you'd answer truthfully or not. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular.”

“Well, not in so many words, I – I suppose.”
“No,” Ron snorted. “C’mon. We’ll be back,” he said to the team, and Harry turned away from their curious glances to follow Ron toward the lifts. They stepped inside, and Ron prodded Two. The level they were already on.
“What does that have to do with it?”
Ron laughed. “Sounds about right. Okay.” He clapped his hands together, standing. “Be back in ten.”
“Okay, I’m
As he pulled a maroon sweater over his head, he looked through the window. It was dark out, the street lit by yellow lamps. They were in the city, as evidenced by the glowing sky and nearby towers, but the closely packed townhouses were serene and quiet. A black cat trotted leisurely down the pavement.
“Draco?” He asked. To his left, the missing wall showed an empty, derelict apartment building. To the right, an empty warehouse. The rubble from the crash piled up in front of him, stray pieces falling to the ground.
Draco was right beside him. Together they tried to pull the curtains closed – which was impossibly difficult to do – while taking ear-splitting abuse from the old hag.
“Rubbish,” Percy argued in Harry’s other ear. “You don’t remember that. You were five.”
“Geroff me, you hag,” George growled, pushing her away and pointing his wand up. “Are you

Draco pushed it his way immediately. “You eat it.”
Harry winced. “I didn’t know it was so important to you.”
“Or…your life. Whatever catches your fancy.”
“Oh, yeah, them too, of course…”
“No,” Harry blinked, astonished. He looked down at himself. Nothing had changed…but then, he wouldn’t exactly know if he was missing epithelial cells, would he? “What did we do?”
The unmarked door opened soundlessly, to a room so cluttered and personal it could have only been vacated minutes ago. The bed and walls were adorned in what he now knew were Gryffindor colors – red and gold that gleamed in the low torchlight from the landing. Like Teddy’s room, there were scattered news clippings and periodical pages stuck to the walls. Unlike Teddy – thankfully – those clippings were mainly arranged in teenage ode to the female form.
Harry shut the door softly behind him, perplexed. “You didn’t answer my – “

“One step off the porch will do.”

“Draco, I think you’re exhausted.” Clinically, perhaps. Harry looked around at the scattered books. “When was the last time you slept?”
But there
matter…
“Well...Horcruxes are only peripherally understood. If you can harness this kind of magic, the Department of Mysteries will want to know how you did it.”
As the ground disappeared from under his feet, so did any and all apprehension. His body seemed very aware of what to do – so much so that his brain only had to focus on the absolute pleasure of being in the air. He shot up, wind blasting his hair back as he let out an exhilarated cry of excitement. This was
Ron cleared his throat. “I suppose some…introductions are in order.”
“Oh. Hey, Harry.” He ruffled George’s hair and squeezed his shoulder, peering into the box. “What are you two up to?”
“What does?” Harry said to thin air, not turning his head.
“Harry,” Percy said, leaning forward from a lawn chair. “How are you finding things?”
“We had to pry it off with our hands,” Dean said, rubbing his arm.
“I need to find Draco first.”
Whatever expression Harry had on made Hermione smile.
He didn’t sleep well. Not because of Draco. At least, not entirely because of Draco. He hadn’t been sleeping well for several nights now, tossing and turning and waking up feeling drained. Nightmares. They were impossible to remember. The feeling was usually helped by a few cups of tea, but he wasn’t sure it would last.

“No. I expect I’ll see her next weekend. Gryffindor game.”
“That’s a

There was a short, shocked silence that ended the moment Draco shut the door in his wake. Ron had a comical look on his face. “You

to protect himself from the worst of it, jumping to his feet before the dust settled and whipping his wand around in a circle, searching for the attacker. Not a soul. He heard screams from the buildings, and down the street. Car alarms were going off nearby. His ears rang.
Harry almost asked. But that was ridiculous. He wasn’t asking permission. He was a grown man, and he didn’t know a thing about Dark magic. “I’m going to Diagon Alley. Erm…do you need anything from me?”
“It’s up to you, innit?”
Like the front atrium, this room was a circle. Bookshelves covered the walls on both of the levels, one big circular desk on the floor, lit at intervals with yellow-bulbed lamps. All under another piece of artwork – only the bird-man here sat at a desk. His one visible eye was open, gray instead of black. There was only one window, nestled between two bookshelves.
The cat bolted, jarring Harry into standing straight.
Relieved he knew this one, Harry pointed the wand at a throw pillow embroidered with a large black
Hermione took a deep breath, gripping the clipboard. “It’s quite a lot to explain, Harry, but we need to keep you out of the public eye right now.”

“Hi,” she squeaked.
The pain was gone. That was relief. He was comfortable, warm and dry instead of freezing, muddy, and wet. There was light beyond his eyelids. It didn’t seem too incredibly bright, so he tried opening them.
“You’re all unbelievable,” Ron snapped, rather harshly. “I said act
“You know…” Ron said slowly. “If we went for a visit, we could take him to Hogsmeade ourselves.”
“Yes. As was being born a squib.” He tapped lightly over the black mark between Cassiopeia and Dorea, moving closer to Harry to point to another. “Cedrella. Married a Weasley.”
“You couldn’t even remember

“Enough,” he said quickly. He didn’t want to talk about the war. Not here, not with these people so clearly effected by it. “I think they wanted to make sure my head was nice and swollen.”
“This would’ve been useful in Herbology,” Lee said. George raised an eyebrow down at his writing. “
“It’s important you know that Chiron will be in the eight house of Virgo this week, inviting mistrust in your marital heritage and interpersonal – “
“Tonic water for you, then.” He looked behind him, at Harry’s bedroom. “You know, it’s
“Yeah.” Harry brushed away the crumbs from their sarneys. “If Draco makes it that long.”
“How’s the semester going?” Seamus asked, stuck between respectful and cowering. They were meant to be trained professionals, Harry thought uncharitably.
It was dark. Near pitch-black, but the sounds around him were vaguely…forest-like. The sound of rain was muted and echoed, like a barrier of canopy gently broke its fall. Standing up straight made it too hard to breath. He bent forward, sucking in air against the agony.
“Ungrateful cunt.”
He picked up a memo and read it aloud, trying to rid himself of the compulsion to speak.
“Well, I’m not just the brewer. I’m also the subject. It’s the binding magic that makes this so personal. And I’m taking the brunt of it to keep Dolohov and Macnair none the wiser to it.”
“Arthurian magic,” Seamus said doubtfully. He looked to Élise. “Don’t they teach that rubbish at Beauxbatons?”
The words were like a curse. Ron’s whole face darkened when he spoke them.
By some miracle, he didn’t argue. Harry went about starting a kettle and finishing the soup, pushing Castor’s face away from the steam every few seconds. “What was it?”
Harry told the snake late on Wednesday. “That’s what we call it. So I’m gonna call you Castor."
“Alright. Malfoy. This is…” she gestured to the block of spiky text. Harry glanced over so he could turn to the same page. Still what looked like history lectures. “Thorough. What do you plan to do with it?’
time ago. Mum knows that.”
“Yeah,” Ron said eagerly, nodding. “Yeah, he does.”
Everything he knew still wasn’t enough to prepare him for arriving at the Ministry. He managed not to trip this time, but people still stared. It was reflexive, like their necks turned automatically when he entered the room. He met eyes with one short, squirrely man who visibly jumped and scurried away.
Aside from the stares, the alley was enchanting. A narrow cobblestone path was crowded on either side by closely packed storefronts behind medieval timber-frame jettisons. Some were newly painted, or clearly in a state of repair.
She chewed a full bottom lip. “If the shields didn’t recognize you, your head, arms, and legs would fall clean off when you stepped through the door. Like a mannequin.”
“The Burrow,” she took a sip. “Helping Arthur with the garden. I should be getting over there, but…”
"Think you're funny?"
Ron’s pint hit the wood heavily. “I just wanted to know enough to tell if he’s feeding us bullshit. No way to step foot inside that mansion without a warrant – and Kingsley’s not bloody likely to grant that.”
A flash of movement drew his eye to a tall bookshelf. Shoved between several large volumes on Switching and Conjuring and a copper wolf-shaped bookend was an unframed, but upright, photo that he recognized instantly. It wasn’t exactly the one on his work desk, but was taken on the same day. The man and woman – his parents – were still in their wedding garb, only here they were joined by a tall and scruffy haired man who double-fisted two champagne flutes. In his plain suit, he shouldn’t have looked nearly as elegant as he managed.
“I’m gay!” He threw his hands up. She shut her eyes. “I’m fucking gay! Why does nobody know that about me?! Is
The potion in the cauldron had changed color since the night before. It was beige, now, and very thick looking, churning itself without being stirred. “You should have woken me up,” Harry said. “I came here to keep watch.”
“Who the fuck are you?”
“One owl to the head of Magical Game and Sports and you’d have the Trillenium Stadium all to yourself whenever you want. Not to mention Ginny Weasley’s connections. Fresh Snitches and state of the art brooms.”
