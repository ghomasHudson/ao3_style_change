Back downstairs, Harry stood outside the front door, scraping at some ice with his shoe. "That letter was... genuinely unexpected, coming from you."
"You can't expect me to spend the night here." Harry hated hospital stays. "I hardly get any sleep in this place, nurses buzzing in and out."
a cast. He just wanted to go home. He didn't protest when he was picked up by Harry. He hid his face against his teacher's shirt, hearing kind words being spoken into his ear.
"Better than me, so I can't judge," Harry answered. He hopped up on the counter beside Scorpius and helped himself to a chunk of edible play dough, rolling it between his hands to make a ball. "What do you do with Draco on your days off? Besides nothing, that is."
Harry pulled a few blades of grass from beside him, feigning an interest in them as he said, "What did he say about me?"
Harry dumped the sliced mushrooms into the stew, then tossed the knife and cutting board into the sink. "Dinner will be ready in about an hour, if you can wait."
Scorpius tsked and immediately moved onto poor Harry. "Harry, come play!" He grabbed Harry's arm and tried to pull him up.
Scorpius blushed as his jaw went slack. He was staggered for obvious reasons. He had no idea how to respond. He had heard other people say it before. Just... never his father. "I-I-I... I love you too," he managed to stammer out.
Harry tilted his head back in defeat and opened his eyes, letting them adjust to the chandelier lights above him. "Right," he muttered. With a loud groan he got up to his feet. "It's quite hard to be your friend, you know?" he added for Draco's benefit.
He grabbed Draco by the arm and swung him around. "Argh!" Draco cried out while shielding his eyes against the blazing orange sun that blinded him in an instant. In the meantime, Harry had already left him in the dust, diving straight downward in a tight spiral towards the grass for a 'graceful' win as the Snitch made contact with his awaiting palm. Behind him, he heard an enraged, "POTTER!"
Draco waved a flippant hand. "Routine questioning," he said. "They make me wait in the interrogation room for a few hours and ask me my whereabouts.. I provide alibis. They approve them."
"Huh?" Harry frowned quizzically. Draco turned his head to the side, motioning for Harry to come along. "Oh, um." Harry stood up as well.
"It's your star," Scorpius told him. "Harry and Gabrielle said we did a very good job with the tree, so I got a star and you got a star. Isn't that nice?"
The two of them sat back with mirroring disgruntled grunts and started stabbing their dinner while Harry and Scorpius shared a smile.
"Old fashioned way, then." He felt his way down the stone stairs, dragging his hand over the rough wall as he ventured into the unlit cellar. Once he reached level ground, he started searching blindly for the lanterns his father had kept around the place.
"But it's just up the way!" Harry exclaimed. "We're almost there already. No one's going home." He grabbed a fistful of Draco's shirt and pulled him onward. Scorpius had to follow since Draco held onto his hand. Neither Malfoy uttered a word as they stumbled over pebbles. "You two
and didn't say a word to me." He sat forward to give Draco a very disappointed look. "The least you could do is let me make my pitch."
And, sure enough, the candy started to pop and fizz in their mouth. "Ah!" Scorpius exclaimed before clapping a hand to his mouth.
Harry seemed to take that as a yes. He pushed a finger into Draco's chest. "You and Scorpius are good people."
Astoria stepped in front of Draco, stopping him in his tracks, and rested her arms on his shoulders. When he pulled a face at her, she responded with a laugh. “Do it for the fantasy."
He had been letting things happen. He knew all about 'letting it happen'. Most of his life, he let things happen to him. When you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, things do just tend to happen without your say so. He didn't make his father buy the entire Quidditch team Firebolts. He didn't make his mother send him on holidays to Italy and Spain for the summer. He didn't have to make them do anything. These things just happened to him. He let the Dark Lord mark him. He let his friend die in a Fiendfyre. He let Wizengamot take his mother and father away. He was no stranger to letting things happen.
"I'm not going anywhere," Draco insisted. "I'm here. See? I'm right here." His heart sank when he felt sweat soaking through Scorpius' pajamas. It was a fever. He flicked his wand to turn on the lights. "Everything is fine. Open your eyes."
"You're a big boy," Scorpius chided lightly. "You're supposed to sleep in your own bed, remember?" That's what Draco always told him if he kicked up a fuss and wanted to sleep in the master bedroom.
Teddy had refused to see him for the past three weeks. That was certainly the longest the two had gone without talking to each other over summer break. They had been glued at the hip for so long.
Harry let out a short burst of laughter that ended in a choked moan, which reverberated into Draco's chest, sending a thrill down his spine, pushing him over the edge. Had it always felt this good? He nearly collapsed atop Harry as he rode wave after wave of release. Fire and ice swept over him. He was barely holding himself up when he blinked to clear his vision, panting down at Harry who was looking up at him with a mixture of disbelief and bemusement. It was very unnerving. "What?"
When Scorpius returned with a toad grasped firmly in his hands, Draco was livid while Harry howled in glee. Scorpius was dismayed by their reactions, having hoped to surprise them with his ingenious find. Instead he was promptly marched into the manor where he splashed sadly in the bathtub while his father scrubbed his hands with an obscene amount of soap.
"Yes. Also I'll look after Dad." He patted Harry's arm twice. "I'm happy you came over, Harry. You're really nice to me and Dad and you don't even have to be."
Harry looked up in surprise when Draco also knelt down. His eyes widened still when Draco moved towards him, prompting him to back away. Before he could catch himself, he lost his balance and fell on his butt. He bumped against the bookshelf with nowhere to go, Draco closing the gap in an instant. Harry gulped and brought the books in his hands up between them, forcing Draco to stop barely an inch away. He waited for Draco to say something, or do something. But nothing happened. Draco stayed as he was, his disconcerting pale eyes boring a hole through Harry. That was almost as bad as doing something. Draco was too close for comfort and appeared rather determined to not move another inch until he heard what he wanted to hear. Flustered, Harry said, "Sorry...?"
important to him. More important than anything else." Draco patted Scorpius' back. "Have I confused you enough?"
Draco was on guard when he saw his son exit the school with Harry Potter. A scheme was afoot. Scorpius latched onto Draco's hand the moment he was close enough to reach it, squeezing him rapidly to telepathically let him know that Harry was about to say something absolutely outrageous.
They never ended up finding the peacocks, even though they walked all around the snowy grounds for almost an hour. Scorpius still had a great time though, kicking around in the snow, trying to follow what he insisted were peacock tracks, and delaying naptime.
She winked at him cheekily. "I just wanted you to have some more excitement in your life, darling. All you do is sleep and work. Your life revolves around Scorpius. Harry Potter is just the right kind of drama – nothing too sensational but just enough scuffles. Theo's told me all about it."
He looked at Harry again. Harry was now watching him very plainly, as though expecting him to say something. Draco was dumbfounded. "She will eat you alive." As Harry's brows knit together, Draco thought it best to explain further. "I'm biased, since she's my ex-wife. But I've known her for almost a decade and I've known you for longer." Harry seemed like someone who needed a nurturing relationship. Astoria could barely provide that for her own son, let alone another man. "She comes from money. Wizard money. Nothing wrong with that, of course. I grew up the same way. It's just that if she doesn't get her-"
Draco looked down at the cold glass and rolled it between his palms. Did he miss Harry? He wasn't sure. He had thrown himself into work and fixing things with Scorpius; distractions that gave him no time to think too hard. "Admitting it is rather mortifying."
Draco scooped Scorpius up and rolled onto his back so his son was lying atop him. He never wanted to let go of this precious boy. He hugged Scorpius tight. "I have done bad things," he confessed. "Things you wouldn't like. Things I'm sorry about."
Harry managed to get up the stairs blearily by trailing a hand over the banister and knowing Draco was behind, ready to catch him if he tripped. His stomach growled but he was too tired to eat. He stopped short of the bedroom as an errant thought wormed into his addled mind. He wasn't supposed to be here. He should be home. He turned around, finding himself face-to-face with Draco. "I should go." Or had he thought it? He couldn't tell. He couldn't tell if he was dreaming.
Draco sat up, bringing Scorpius along with him and nestling the boy on his lap. "Tell me. What's wrong?"
"I suppose it's no one's fault but your own." Draco examined the offending ankle with prodding fingers. He couldn't tell how bad the damage was but, from the looks of it, it wasn't that bad. "One more thing, Scorpius," he said. "Didn't you think it wise to mention that your teacher is Harry Potter?"
Scorpius had barely sat down on the bench in the dressing room to get the weight off of his jelly legs when his mother and father walked in, evidently having shirked the rest of the school's performance. Thankfully they weren't the only parents who had slipped out, that would have been very embarrassing for Scorpius. Well, he was embarrassed, nonetheless. But he would have been
Now Scorpius looked unsure. "I… um… My friends at school said that… Harry doesn't have a mother or father."
"If I were someone else, would it matter?" Harry asked instead. He began searching the rumpled bedspread for his glasses. Draco watched him sift through the sheets blindly, growing more and more exasperated until he simply had to reach over, grab the spectacles from beside the pillows, and shove it in Harry's hand. Harry mumbled his thanks while putting his glasses back on. Then he waited expectantly for Draco's reply. When he was met with silence, Harry nodded. "Right. Well." He sat up, pulling his legs in and crossing them under him. "I'll forget it." He gestured at his cheek. "You know, you've got some dirt on your face."
In the manor, Scorpius was running circles around the kitchen, recounting his newest trick to Patricia. He only stopped when she uncovered the casserole and a heavenly waft of roasted potatoes, melted cheese, and sweet ham made his stomach rumble something fierce. "I'm so hungry." He pawed at Patricia. "Is it dinnertime yet?"
Scorpius was a puzzling piece in Draco's world. Often he would slip out of his leisure reading, thinking about his son. He spent time watching Scorpius colour his next masterpiece, wondering where the years had flown. He would be playing Scorpius' newest imaginative game, and a nagging anxiety would tug at him deep down. For seven years, his world had revolved around this precious boy. When he wasn't at work, he had been with Scorpius. And when he couldn't be with Scorpius, he had searched hard to find an au pair who satisfied both his and Astoria's criteria, settling on Patricia who had been with the family for most of Scorpius' life. All he did, he did for his son.
"Just tell me already." Harry was perplexed as he squinted at Draco's back. He tried to remember the night before. He remembered dinner, talking Malfoy's ear off about the kids, more than a few glasses of wine, some laughs, the cellar, then blank.
Scorpius was a ball of nerves as soon as he realized that he was finally hovering two feet in the air. He had never gotten this far before. In fact, he had only left the grass once with Draco helping him, and it had ended with him in frustrated tears because Draco just wouldn't stop pestering him about the way he sat on the broom or how his elbows shouldn't be locked or the position of his head. It had all been too much. But now here he was, actually hovering two feet in the air.
"Because my cousin lives with him, right?" Scorpius continued. "Nanna said that's why Harry is my family."
"It's an art project by the students. Scorpius was supposed to bring it home, but I think he isn't too happy with them, so he keeps leaving them behind," Harry explained. "I was hoping to give them to you in person in school, and I haven't seen you since... well... Anyway, um, I think that's supposed to be you and him on a Quidditch pitch. The other one is a starry night he drew for his mother."
Scorpius giggled as Harry and Teddy scowled at each other. Those two were silly. He gulped down his juice really quick because he wanted to show Teddy the peacock he had almost caught a few days ago. As soon as Teddy was finished with his cereal, the two boys ran out the backdoor into the warm sunny morning, promising to be back in a jiffy because Teddy had a lunch date with his grandmother at noon.
The things he put up with… Harry resisted rolling his eyes. "Yes. Hadn't you heard?" He waved his arms around him. "Harry Potter’s Home for Knocked Down Death Eaters." He scowled at Malfoy. "Look, this is between you and me. I don't want anyone to know either. God knows I don't need that kind of trouble." He added, "Besides, you should stay away from your place until you know it’s safe. I’ll look into it." Logic and survival strategies should work on Malfoy. He was a Slytherin after all. "I don't want your untimely death on my conscience."
And that's how Draco Malfoy found himself alone in a spare bedroom with a bundle of clothes in his arms.
"I would rather have money," Draco said as he made his way up the stairs. "That's useful. What am I supposed to do with a star?"
"Not even a fish," Scorpius muttered. He looked down at his book and glared at it, perhaps hoping for his teacher to go away if he ignored the man for long enough. But Harry was just as stubborn. Scorpius flipped the page in his book deliberately and Harry didn't budge. Then Scorpius exhaled in exasperation. "You shouldn't be nice to me."
Scorpius turned to Harry, who still stood at the doorstep outside. "Thanks, Harry." He grinned a gruesome grin. "I had a lot of fun." He ran into the manor and upstairs without further ado, leaving Harry and Draco in an awkward silence.
Scorpius chewed on the side of his cheek while dutifully letting his father wash all the way up to his shoulders, even though the toad didn't go up his sleeves. "I'm sorry," he mumbled.
"Let's gooooo," Rose whined. She grabbed the men by the hand and urged them out the front yard, onto the street where little monsters and fairytale creatures flooded the sidewalk.
A minute later, Scorpius had his head by Draco's chest and they were reading the dragon book slowly. Draco wove his fingers into Scorpius' hair, massaging his scalp like his mother used to. Scorpius tugged at his ear for comfort. He wanted to forget about the creepy spiders and keep thinking about the white dragon. His eyes drooped shut not long after and he was asleep before he could get past page three. Draco didn't realize that until he was on the fifth page. He tilted his head down to find his son sleeping soundly. He put the book away. As tired as he was at the moment, he wouldn't be able to sleep. Not when Scorpius was like this.
His nanny wasn't far behind. Patricia appeared at the doorway, looking a bit embarrassed. "He thought you broke your neck," she said with an apologetic smile.
Draco glanced past Harry to find Astoria standing at the foot of the front steps, surrounded by presents at her feet.
A minute later, Draco walked out of the room with his son in his arms. Harry pushed off the wall, flicking carefully guarded eyes between Draco Malfoy and his son.
life." A small voice in the back of his mind kept telling him to shut up, but the building anger and humiliation sent cutting words to his sharp tongue. "Whatever this is, was, it's what you wanted. You've chalked it up to curiosity or confusion or boredom. Now you'll listen to what I want, for once. I've spent too many
Ginny glared at him to keep him quiet before continuing to recite, "What is her name? Have you seen her? Nanna says Harry's heart is broken. Is it bad? Can you look for his girlfriend?"
Harry was ready to accept defeat. He just lay on the ground, panting and sweating under the many layers of winter clothes he had piled on. He squinted up at the sunny sky, his glasses covered in drops of water, damp hair plastered to his forehead. He must have looked a frightful sight when Draco stood over him, blocking the sun from his view. He held up his hand. Draco took it to help him up to his feet. "You know, using magic was a bit unfair," Harry complained while patting at his jacket and pants to brush off the snow that had caked on. "I don't have my wand on me."
"Cut it!" Teddy suddenly brandished a knife out of nowhere. Harry yelped and snatched the knife away from him.
Teddy gasped again. "The nerve!" He couldn't believe the gall. "The absolute nerve on you, Harry Potter! I am the
Draco slipped his clammy hands into his pockets and cleared his throat. "It's obviously no coincidence that Scorpius is in your class," he told Harry.
What if Malfoy needed actual medical attention, not just a patch up job? Should he be at St. Mungo's? What if he died on the couch? Then Harry would have a real mess on his hands. He abruptly faced the fire. Hermione. But then he shook his head. Bad idea. One look at Malfoy and she would throw common sense out the window. A lot of people did that after one look at Malfoy. He glanced back at the man. He wouldn't be surprised if that was exactly what had happened that night. Some drunken mob wanting revenge. It didn't matter that the war had ended over ten years ago, or that justice should be left to the Magical Law Enforcement officers to deal out, or that all parties involved with the Dark Army had already been through Wizengamot, either ending up imprisoned or on probation. Harry ran a hand through his untamed hair as he continued to pace. He had tried his best to clean up Malfoy's injuries. At least his face was no longer blood covered, the salve should take care of the scarring, and his wrist didn’t appear to be in two pieces.
"I used to worry about you," Draco murmured. "I used to wonder what you would do if something happened to me. I used to get so worked up, thinking you would be all alone."
Draco looked back, thinking that maybe the boys had snuck down for a snack. But there was no one there. He frowned and turned forward.
"I don't want to talk about it." Scorpius walked out the room, leaving Draco to scratch his head in puzzlement. If the kid was already acting this way, Draco would have his hands full when puberty hit.
He blinked awake a second time, not remembering falling back to sleep. He was alone in bed this time and the noise in the manor was reaching unmanageable levels, as if he were living on top of a zoo. He supposed that meant it was time to finally give in.
"I'll bring over some food tomorrow. You'll need your rest tonight, and I'd wager you'll be famished tomorrow. How does that sound?"
The next morning, he was very surprised to find Scorpius marching towards him before class began. "Did you give my father my drawings?" he asked Harry with his arms folded across his chest, probably something he had seen adults do when they were miffed.
Harry snorted and wondered why he was surprised that this enormous manor could have a wine cellar. It certainly had an ominous dungeon prison. A wine cellar was quite the upgrade considering that. He followed Draco. "How many rooms do you have in this place?"
Why had he run to Potter at the first sign of trouble? He cursed his instincts. Why was it always Potter? He screwed his eyes shut as humiliation crushed him from the inside. He just wanted to curl into an insignificant ball and disappear through a crack in the wall, never to be heard from again.
"My thoughts exactly." Harry placed a finger at his lips. "You get ice-cream after, so it's worth it. Trust me."
"Scorpius hasn't said anything incriminating… yet." Theo hugged Scorpius reassuringly. "Harry doesn't have a mother or father anymore. But he used to, when he was a little baby."
He looked up at Harry, searching the teacher's face to make sure there were no signs of condescension. Once he was satisfied with Harry's genuine smile, he looked at his picture to inspect it. "Okay," he said with a polite nod, which only caused Harry to smile wider.
Draco groaned inwardly as he walked into their living room and placed Scorpius on the couch. What was Potter doing, filling his son's head with nonsense? Some of the things his son said led him to believe that the boy was really much older then five. "It's... complicated," he said as he knelt down in front of Scorpius and helped him take off his shoes.
Draco finally intervened, changing the subject from Harry to upcoming winter plans. However, this revelation was too incredible for Theo to gloss over. As soon as Scorpius had retired for the night, Theo pounced on Draco. "Harry Potter is your
"I'll be right back," Draco sighed. Astoria appeared troubled as she nodded. Draco weaved past the small crowd to get to the door.
"Let's see." Harry thought about it. "I love to sleep. I play with Rose and Hugo, have lunches and dinners with friends. If Teddy's around, he always wants to do things. Usually we fly in the evenings and have picnics. Recently I've been trying to grow some plants, but that hasn't been going well. I also do prep work for school. Sometimes I visit the Burrow. I like weekends."
being careful. Stop embarrassing me'. When Draco returned his attention to Harry, he realized that Harry was waiting patiently for him to continue talking. "Oh." It wasn't often that anyone wanted to hear him speak about work. "We handle small settlements. Mostly marital disputes and inheritance issues." He trailed off. "Nothing interesting."
He blinked away the sunlight and pressed a few fingers to his eyes. "Oh," he moaned. He felt like death had washed over him. It was horrid.
"Couldn't help it." Ginny laughed at Harry's mortification. "Anyway, he really does sound worried about you." She was genuine now. "You're alright, aren't you?"
After storming out of 12 Grimmauld Place, Scorpius had gotten a little further than a block when Draco had caught up to him. Once they had arrived at the Malfoy Manor, the two of them had screamed their voices away until they were red in the face. They hadn't spoken to each other since, not really. Draco threw himself at work, taking on any cases he could get his hands on. Scorpius spent his days with Patricia. They ate dinner in relative silence. Summer was ending that way, in relative silence...
The summer flew by splendidly for Scorpius. He had played with Teddy and Harry, read with Draco, and pestered Patricia. He spent a week traveling with his mother in Europe where he was lounging on beaches in Greece, eating all the gelato he wanted in Italy, and walking all over France. It was the most brilliant summer. His life had never seemed fuller - full of fun, full of sunshine, full of laughs, and full of family. He was in Versailles with Draco and Astoria, in a lavish French hotel, eating delicious French food, wearing fancy French clothes. He felt so grown up. And when they got back to their large suite, he couldn't believe his little eyes when he saw a brand new Firebolt sitting on the table.
"Yes, please," Scorpius said even though he didn't like to drink milk. He was trying to make a good impression.
Scorpius stirred when Draco gathered him up into a tight hug. Draco took a deep breath, the familiar smell of his son calming him considerably. He kissed Scorpius' forehead, then looked up to watch Harry boil water and measure out tea leaves. Steam rose hypnotically from the kettle. The old house creaked and settled in the dark. Spoons clinked against ceramic. A clock ticked somewhere upstairs.
Theo clinked the cold stones in his glass impatiently. Like pulling teeth. "I mean... are you really?"
Scorpius started to call Harry out on that statement, but he got distracted when he heard his name. He glanced back to find his nanny waving at him by the gate. He had half a mind to ignore her and continue with this
Draco snorted in derision. Yet another thing to worry about. "As you so eloquently put it, 'when everything inevitably goes to shit', what do I tell Scorpius?" he asked. "That you've decided to pursue more lucrative pastimes than giving him free flying lessons?"
"Hey, Dad?" Scorpius sidled up beside Draco, who was reading by the fire. "Do you think we can go see if the peacocks are alright? It's frightfully cold, you see. I wouldn't want them to freeze out there."
Harry knelt down next to Scorpius Malfoy and watched the boy blink rapidly with his chin tucked to his chest.
Harry could tell that Scorpius had immense reservations. At his age, Teddy would have jumped at the chance to have a play date with anyone who would have him, by hook or by crook. In fact, Teddy had run away that one time because Andromeda had told him no to a sleepover, much to Harry's fright. But Scorpius was nothing like Teddy.
Downstairs, Draco was setting out bowls, cereal, and milk on the table when Harry walked into the kitchen, asking, "Got any sugar?" Draco pointed out the sugar bowl on the countertop. After Harry had hunted down a spoon, he added some much needed sweetness to his coffee while enjoying the warmth beaming through the enormous windows. He tossed the spoon in the sink and turned to find Draco watching him. "What?"
He leaned back slightly to eavesdrop, letting his spoon rest on the lid of his lunchbox. Gossip about Harry Potter was something he couldn't ignore.
"The children are making some crafts for parents. I was wondering if Scorpius could expect to see his mother there as-"
Lost and blind, he ran through the unforgiving maze in his head. Blackness surrounded him as he struck wall after wall in an attempt to escape. Every inch of him ached but still he ran. Blood rushed against his ears, rendering him deaf to his own footsteps. If only he could-
"Really. Not everyone is great on stage the first time. You've never had to sing in front of so many people before, have you?"
"Harry, are you... um..." Hermione trailed off, gesturing vaguely instead of finishing her question.
Another pause filled their conversation, at which point Harry was trying to figure out how best to say that Scorpius might need to go home. But before he could speak-
"It didn't cost me anything!" Ginny answered cheerily. "I got it at the World Cup. I want you to have it."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry frowned at her as she left the hospital room to get back to the work she had abandoned in her hurry. Ron scurried after her.
"You may want to call his parents, Harry," the nurse advised. "Just to let them know? Nothing is the matter. The swelling will go down in a few hours. He just needs to rest with his foot elevated."
The hospital room rang with a loud wail as Scorpius spun around and threw his arms around Harry. Wrenching sobs burst out of him. His tears soon wet Harry's shirt. Harry held Scorpius tight. He whispered soft words that neither Patricia nor Ron could hear. Both of them made feeble excuses to get out of the room, leaving Harry and Scorpius to sort things out on their own.
Draco paused at the doorway leading into the kitchen when he realized that Patricia was preparing food. She looked up before he had a chance to slink away, making the situation a bit awkward for him. He walked in reluctantly, which didn't go unnoticed. Patricia hid her smile by looking down at the vegetables she was slicing for the salad.
Scorpius wished for more fun birthdays as he blew out seven candles on the brilliantly decorated carrot cake. He got many toys and books and art supplies. He ate enough sweets and drank enough juice to fill his yearly quota.
Scorpius eagerly opened his very first letter from Teddy and plopped down on the sofa to curl up and read it. It was hard to contain his anticipation.
Harry smoothed the paper napkin that lay on the table, attempting to break the uncomfortable silence between him and Draco. "So you are a lawyer?" he asked. He wasn't sure if Draco was in any sort of gumption to make more small talk.
your father. I would never do something you are uncomfortable with." Draco needed Scorpius to hear all this. "Tomorrow, at school, you will behave. When you see Harry, you will behave."
"I can hardly see you," Harry complained. He waved his hand in front of his myopic eyes. "You're a blur and not worth the money."
tent, of course. Teddy had made a tent in Scorpius' playroom out of blankets, chairs, and pillows. Teddy had also set his wand above their heads to make a soft light that wasn't too bright. The tent was plush and it was the most fun sleep Scorpius had ever had. He would wake up at night when Teddy elbowed or kicked him. But that was okay. Sometimes he awoke because Teddy was pulling him into a tight hug while muttering nonsense. He didn't mind that either. This was the first time someone had slept over in his room.
Draco slid his thumb over the condensation on his glass of water. "I didn't really know about him until a few years ago," he said. "And I'm not one to be curious."
wanted to say was that he had had a good time and that he wanted to have more sleepovers. But that would be too embarrassing. So he whined instead.
Harry glanced at Scorpius when he didn't make a move to start building his sandwich. "Not sure what you want?"
A lot of people were mean to Draco. That's why Scorpius wasn't allowed to go out with him to the park or the library. He had heard Draco and Patricia speak about it. He liked his nanny. She was always sweet to him, answering his questions and keeping him company when he was bored with his books. But he would rather spend time with his family. The only family he knew was his father. He wanted to go out and play with Draco by the lake like the kids in his school. But some people didn't like to see that. Draco would always brush it off, saying things will change when Scorpius grew up. Now it turns out Harry Potter was his family too. And he has a cousin named Teddy. Like the bear. Scorpius wondered what his cousin was like. But he had
"Oh no," Teddy groaned as he grabbed Harry's wrist and looked at the cut on his palm. "Harry, why are you like this?"
"That's awfully nice of you. Then I suppose I will just have to share my secret star technique with you."
He supposed they were. They had a child together, after all. "We are close for the sake of Scorpius," he said. "Why? Jealous, Potter?"
Harry looked at Theo, then at Draco, then quickly back at Theo again, saying, "Oh, I don't want to impose," because Draco had just glared at him from behind Theo's back with his lips drawn into a thin line, shaking his head while his nostrils flared, clearly wanting Harry to say no.
Harry held out a hand, asking Draco to help him up. As Draco pulled him upright, he remarked, "Haven't I always?"
Scorpius let Draco tuck him in and he didn't make a sound when he was kissed on the cheek. Draco furrowed his brows questioningly. Scorpius responded to the look by saying, "I love you."
"Wow." Scorpius found it hard to believe that someone as famous as Harry would be eating a sandwich with him or teaching at his school. He ignored the disparaging noises his father was making. "I don't think I would like to be that famous," he confessed. "People talk about you all the time. Did you know that?"
Draco glanced at Harry, who had his head down, picking at a loose thread on his sweater. Strange thing to admit. Draco reached for the platter of cookies.
That evening, Harry walked Scorpius down the stairs and towards the fence where Draco stood, glaring at everybody. From the looks of it, the man apparently hated all children except his own son. He glared at Harry too, but Harry was used to it. He had been glared at by Malfoy all his life. It was no big deal to him. Draco picked Scorpius up in his arms. "He didn't strain too much today," Harry reported dutifully.
"Let's draw something," Teddy said. He breathed against the window to fog it up. Scorpius followed suit. "The best part is that you can't mess up." Teddy used his finger to draw a stickman. "If you do, you just have to wipe it off and start again." Scorpius began to draw a flower on the glass.
Harry poked his head out from behind the Christmas tree that he was decorating. Rose and Hugo were playing with some toys in front of the crackling fire. Hermione was fiddling a wreath while Ron picked at caramel popcorn from a bowl on the sofa. Teddy had just walked into the living room carrying an armful of letters. He had taken the liberty of opening one, and he was making a sour face while reading it. "Are those mine?" Harry asked as he got up to his feet.
Scorpius nodded quickly. "Okay." He turned around and ran out of the study without saying anything else.
"You know my father?" Scorpius asked during recess. He was sat next to Harry on the grass with his sore leg stretched out in front of him and a picture book nestled on his lap.
"You can mix them too," Harry offered. "Teddy usually puts strawberry on one slice and chocolate on the other."
"Oh dear," Astoria sniffed. Draco had a handkerchief ready for her and she snatched it without another word to quickly dab her overflowing eyes.
Harry walked up to the table by the window, peeking over his students' heads to look at some drawings. There really was no structure to this assignment, of course. It was simply to gauge each student's level. He noticed that many of the children just scribbled on the paper with no purpose while others tried to impress each other and their teachers with their grown-up painting skills.
He knew that, at face value, Harry was right - it was only a few days. But there was more to this. He wanted Harry to acknowledge that they were on the same page. "I'm not what you expected. Right?" He crossed his arms at his chest. "I'm not who you expected to be with. It's not just a few days. It's everything else you might want. I'll... say no. No to Christmas, no to holidays, no to your parties, no to that annual Quidditch League pass, no to even being seen with you in bloody public." He bit his tongue before he blurted out more of his worries. He just knew how poisonous resentment can be. He had experienced it with his wife. The dread that welled up in him when he thought about going through that again, it was-
Harry felt as though he had been struck, like he had the wind knocked out of him. He stuffed his trembling hands in his pockets. Everything Draco said hit so close to home that he couldn't speak. Blinded by frustrated tears, he stormed out before he heard anything else he would regret.
Harry's heart sank when he heard this. "You're welcome," he said. "Of course I have to be nice to you. Imagine what Teddy would do if I wasn't?" Scorpius laughed and nodded in agreement at Harry's exaggerated terrified expression. Harry smiled after and ruffled Scorpius's hair. "You are a very special person, Scorp. Thank you for being nice to me too." He conjured a couple of cups of water as they walked back into the spacious master bedroom. Draco was still fast asleep. Scorpius crawled back into bed and Harry placed the water on the bedside table. "Lights on or off?"
Scorpius held the magazine up to Hermione, but she knelt next to him instead. "We went to a fair yesterday," he told her. "It was a Muggle fair. See?"
It took her a few minutes to wake up. She rubbed her eyes and sat up in bed while yawning. When she unrolled the parchment, she found a smaller paper enclosed within. She read that first.
Harry looked at him, piquing a brow. "There's some in the kitchen," he added with a vague gesture towards the hallway.
"You could say that," Draco murmured as he joined Harry on the couch. He took another look at the mantle above the fireplace, this time from afar. Potter's life was different from his. The mantle was a good depiction of it. Cluttered with photographs, curious memorabilia, disorder, and dust bunnies. In contrast, all the mantles at Draco's manor was either stark bare or had some antique baubles that his mother had placed ages ago. He had never thought himself to be the sentimental sort. These days, though, he couldn't be so sure. It wouldn't be so bad if he had a photograph of Scorpius on his writing desk.
Harry laughed and nodded. "Just be careful when you go upstairs, okay? Some of the rooms are strange."
Andromeda laughed with him as they followed the crowd of parents exiting the platform. "Whatever will you do when that time comes, Harry?" She shook her head at him. "You're a lost cause."
Harry, to his credit, didn't laugh out loud. "Don't worry, I haven't forgotten your name." He then shrugged. "It's just something I call you kids, I suppose. Don't want me to?"
These thoughts had been running wild circles in Draco's mind all day and well into the night. Astoria had left for one of her holiday soirees, the boys were full of sweets and passed out upstairs in Scorpius' room, and Draco was still nursing his whiskey in an attempt to quiet his thoughts when there was a knock at the door.
to be mean and you just won't let me." His hands were clenched into fists and he stood as close to Harry as he possibly could. "It's not fair. You shouldn't be nice to me. You shouldn't."
"Scorpius, wait outside," Draco said. Scorpius tugged at Draco's trousers to get him to shut up, but Draco simply pointed at the hallway. Scorpius dragged himself out of the classroom dejectedly. Draco closed the door between them. Now the classroom was empty but for him and Harry. "What have you been telling my son?"
"Are you sure you are alright, dear?" Molly fussed. Her hands were clasping her pink mittens tight and her lips were drawn into a thin line out of worry.
Draco was taken aback by the sudden questions. Scorpius had hardly spoken more than a few words to him over the past few days, only to start now. He was watching Draco closely. As though waiting to hear something important. It was unnerving and Draco tsked, "You're being difficult." Although he had said that, he was glad that Scorpius was being difficult. A difficult Scorpius was similar to normal Scorpius. He got up while swishing his wand to darken the room. "Goodnight."
"Hearing you kills the mood," Draco lied as he eased onto the bed beside Harry. The truth was much worse. He pulled his trousers up, then took his wand out of his pocket and waved it once, cleaning them off. As each moment passed, the ludicrousness of what they had just done was setting in. Like a couple of teenagers, jerking each other off. What on earth were they thinking? Draco sat up and willed his fuzzy head to clear up. "What time is it?"
being reasonable!" Draco exploded. "You think you know better? You think you can push this aside? The world does not revolve around you. It isn't an idealist paradise out there, despite what you might think. It doesn't bow down to your every whim and fancy.
"Be that as it may..." Harry didn't let the comment provoke him, because he was in a rather good mood today. "Instead of concerning myself with what others might be saying or my own expectations, I want to think about what you might be feeling. Because maybe I haven't been letting things happen, but rather making things happen."
Draco, like his son, was going to say his piece now that he finally had his chance with Harry. "From the beginning, I had my concerns, and I haven't tried to hide that from you. I have responsibilities, with Scorpius. I have a past. I hadn't planned for... you. We got caught up in the novelty for a while, but I always knew in the back of my mind that something had to give. When those photographs..." He broke off and cleared his throat. "It became real. Scorpius and I, we were scared. To have our faces splashed on a magazine for everyone to laugh at, it's what I had been dreading. It's how I had expected everything to end. I had imagined that, when it did end, I would be fine. We would be fine. It wouldn't matter." He looked away to steel his nerves, focusing on his frozen socked feet instead. The faster he finished speaking, the faster his toes would thaw out. "Then I saw you with Ginny and- I remembered that night you asked if I would go with you to the gala. I said no. That's the thing, Harry. I will always say no. Someone like her, she would say yes." He looked up at Harry.
"He sure does. He says if I don't finish my vegetables, I'll get warts on my face and I'll turn into a goblin. That's so silly. But he tells me it's true."
those letters, he liked yours the best. He wouldn't put it down or quit smiling for a whole day, can you believe it? Of course, he loves you two. He thinks the world of both of you."
"He had to go." Draco poured a glass of warm milk for Scorpius. He paused when he properly took in the state of his bedraggled son. Scorpius had a trail of dried drool on the corner of his mouth, his hair was a fright, and his eyes were barely cracked open. "Ah, so we aren't bothering with a morning brush these days?"
Draco snatched it from Harry's hand to study it. He blinked a few times to clear his swaying vision, then frowned, turning the paper this way and that. "What the hell is this?"
Harry ruffled the boy's soft blonde hair and stood up. Scorpius watched his teacher move to the table next to him and kneel down next to little Lucy and speak with her in a low voice, no doubt saying nice things to her too. But he didn't mind that. It was just so strange to see someone who was so caring and kind to everyone. He looked down at his half-done worksheet. Whenever Harry encouraged him, he felt like trying even harder. He pressed his pencil to the paper and carefully traced the triangle. He wanted Harry to keep saying nice things to him, even if he said those things to all the children.
Harry seemed committed to keeping his eyes on the flames. He blew on the steaming tea a few times, then sipped it, his gaze unwavering from the fire licking at the glowing logs. "All of it?" he eventually asked.
"Of course, I do." Draco clasped Scorpius' hands tight. "You are the best thing that ever happened to me. I will always love you more than anyone in the world."
The kitchen door swung open, Astoria poked her head in, and found Harry and Draco where she had left them, the former looking at her expectantly and the latter apparently having seen a ghost. She ignored Draco's dramatics, didn't even bat an eye, and asked Harry, "When do you and Teddy have to leave? Scorpius asked if there's time for a play in the snow."
"Your mother's waiting in there," Draco murmured and jerked his thumb into the classroom. Scorpius nodded before scurrying away.
"Wait." Harry reached out a hand to stop the door. "You should come along next year." Draco frowned at him. "Indulge me for a change." Draco scoffed while forcing the door shut in Harry's face. Amused, Harry muttered, "Goodnight," at the door. He tossed the severed foot between his hands as he hopped down the front steps of the manor.
Draco gave Harry a discreet nod before saying, "That's because you made twenty pancakes." He started filling up the box with ginger snap cookies that Patricia had made a couple of days ago. "Ten would have been plenty."
Harry flushed when he remembered that first letter from Scorpius. "Teddy loves writing letters to his cousins. He was thrilled when he got one from Scorpius," he told her. "In fact, they've already seemed to have made plans for the summer."
it," she gushed. "You were brilliant. I had eyes for no one else." She pulled back to kiss her son's cheek. Then she handed him the long-stemmed red rose that she had been holding onto. "For you."
Teddy nodded big. "Oh, yeah. He's definitely a Slytherin. No doubt about that. A better Slytherin than his father too."
Draco glanced up to find Harry at the doorway, flushed from the winter wind, wiping his dripping nose with the back of his glove, squinting as his spectacles fogged up, damp hair sticking up on end, scarf askew around his neck.
By this time Harry had managed to wrangle his arm back. He had noticed Astoria and Draco staring daggers at each other. "I should go."
That evening, Harry watched from the large front doors of the school as Scorpius walked along the length of the stairs one at a time with deliberate slowness. He would occasionally look up to scan the quiet street and, when he saw no one, would go back to watching his feet as he walked. Almost all the children had gone home by then, the few stragglers meeting up with parents at the front wrought iron gate. Scorpius, however, had yet to be claimed.
"I was being honest," Harry said. "I don't have one." Draco opened his mouth to retort, but Harry interjected, saying, "I know you don't believe me. Or maybe it's hard for you to believe that someone would walk into Malfoy Manor without an ulterior motive." He shrugged. "I don't want to hold grudges anymore, not if it stops Teddy from being around Scorpius." He then nodded once. "There you go. Scorpius is your ulterior motive. Teddy is mine. Happy?"
By the time the third song started, Scorpius was singing properly. His voice couldn't be heard above all the other children's, but he was singing. Sometimes he forgot the words but quickly caught up by watching Gabrielle's cues. He somehow managed to get through the whole routine and he didn't even notice that they had finished until the parents started clapping.
Scorpius paused and looked up at Harry, squinting when the sun got in his eyes. "Why do you call me that?" he asked. "My name is Scorpius."
"No." Harry didn't want to colour. He wanted to get out of the house. It was an unusually warm winter morning. Snow was beginning to melt off the trees. But the Malfoys were a couple of homebodies most of the time. "I'm bored."
Draco was on his third glass of the night when he heard the familiar and insistent knock on his door. He glanced at his watch as he groaned. Eight at night. What the hell did Potter want at this time of day? He supposed he should be glad that the man didn't pound on his door loud enough to wake Scorpius up. He contemplated letting it be, but two minutes of rhythmic knocking was not something he could ignore easily.
"No, he already left. He said not to bother you." Scorpius rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Are you still angry with him?"
Draco and Astoria had reconnected through mutual friends a few years after the war. After just five months of dating, they had gotten engaged and married. They were lovestruck and young. They had gone through so much in the war, they understood each other's dreams and nightmares. They were happy. But only for three years. Only until Scorpius' unannounced arrival.
On Saturday afternoon, Draco had barely finished knocking on the weathered door of 12 Grimmauld Place before it was thrown open.
Years ago, after the war, it was standard procedure for all Death Eaters to be questioned using the truth serum. Testimonies given under the effects of Veritaserum were not admissible in trials, but it was still widely used in small doses to verify details of a case. "You lose yourself." It seemed the Aurors had no qualms about using it for their own purposes. The memories still terrified Draco, of sitting in a small room on a cold chair, barely able to focus on the wizard standing across from him asking questions, words tumbling out of his mouth without him really knowing what he was saying. "I don't want to go through it again."
Harry glanced at his watch as Scorpius stirred upon hearing the familiar name. A little less than ten minutes.
"Take him to the Healer tomorrow. Both of you need to go. I'm sure they'll give him something for his throat. I'll stop by after school, check in on you."
Draco was surprised that he wasn't met with a snappy comeback. "Do you want me to care?" he asked quietly.
Scorpius pushed his nose against the window and stared up at the grey sky. "School." His breath fogged up the glass. "I get all my bad attitudes at school." He tsked once, turning around to face his father. "Maybe he didn't like the letter."
Scorpius hadn't realized that he was pouting until then. He quickly pulled his lower lip back in and attempted to put on a pleasant expression. "It's okay," he said with a small smile. He was now sitting on the island countertop in the kitchen, watching Draco get his after-school snack ready. "Sometimes it's okay to be a baby."
Harry slammed the door shut and glared at it for a couple seconds, hoping the reporters waiting outside caught the obvious hint. What part of 'no comment' did they not get? He kicked the door for good measure before stomping upstairs.
He sighed in frustration as he dragged his hands over his face, his tired eyes closing on their own accord. "I'm at my wit's end." Some days were worse than others. "They said they had an eyewitness. If it hadn't been for you, I don't know what I would have done."
Scorpius raced around the old house, throwing open every door that was unlocked, peering into dark rooms, jumping when spiders scrambled on the floorboards, listening for ghosts, sneezing when he disturbed dust on some of the drop-cloths that covered ancient furniture. This place was amazing! Teddy probably had so many adventures when he grew up here. Scorpius peered out the window that faced the street. In his home, all the windows faced green lawns. The Malfoy Manor was in a wizarding community. But Harry lived among Muggles. Scorpius liked this view more because it wasn't boring at all. Cars would splash by, men and women in hats and mitts would be slipping and sliding over the pavement, the streetlights blinked on, and the sun began to set.
Theo, with Scorpius still in his arms, started walking down the street. Just as Draco turned to follow them, he heard a quiet, "Could I speak with you for a second?" He turned back, surprised.
"I'm a metamorphmagus," Teddy explained. "I can change into whoever I want to be. I've been practicing Harry for years and years. I'm pretty good, huh?"
Astoria wriggled her nose. "They are growing boys." She set the heavy plate on the counter in dismay. "I don't want to dump these. Shall I pack some for you, Harry?" She cocked her head in concern when she noticed Harry massaging his temple. "Oh, headache? I've got a tincture in my trunk. It's marvelous. Works like a charm."
in love with this wonderful girl he had grown up with, gone to Hogwarts with. People say they were perfect for each other. Quidditch mad, full of adventures and magic."
Harry couldn't say he was too surprised when, after school the next day, he found Draco outside his classroom. Scorpius happily ran up to his father. But Draco patted his head and said, "I need to speak with Harry for a moment. Are you fine playing outside?"
He swiftly got up and stepped away just as Molly sat Harry down. Scorpius was too preoccupied to notice so he stayed near Harry and looked on with interest. Draco sidled towards the window as nonchalantly as possible.
Harry slumped in his seat and thought about ignoring her. He had been skirting her for ages. He dragged himself towards the fireplace. Ginny gestured for him to sit down on the rug and he obeyed without a word. Then she cleared her throat and made a show of holding up a piece of paper.
Harry had caught up to him by then, panting from the exertion of pushing his broom. "I think that's cheating," he said while catching his breath. He meant the fancy Japanese broom pitted against his nearly twenty-year-old relic.
"Let's try something here, shall we?" Harry murmured as he eased the pencil from Scorpius' tight fist. The boy quickly wiped his damp eyes and looked away. Harry smiled to himself as he rounded a few petals, erased a few errant lines and made a few clouds fluffier until the picture looked presentable. "Perfect, see?" he said encouragingly, moving the paper towards Scorpius.
"Shwell!" Scorpius had already stuck one end of the candy cane in his mouth. "May I have two more, pleash?" He held out his hand again. "For Mum and Dad."
He was yanked back without warning. "Stay." Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him into an embrace. Harry felt a steady drumming at his back, fingers twisting his shirt, radiating heat enveloping him, a shiver fluttering through him, his resolve weakening as he tilted his head to the side to let Draco's lips glide over his neck and up to his ear.
"He's a lot like his father in that aspect of things. Hard to keep up with both of them these days." She sighed in defeat. "But you know, I don't just mean in his schoolwork. Draco told me about your godson. Teddy, right?"
Harry knew then that Scorpius would have no trouble winning over the Weasleys with his solemn words. Hermione was already taken, he could tell. Teddy came up behind them and yanked Scorpius away from the midst of all the adults, spinning him around so the little Weasleys could get a good look at him. "This is my
"He likes fighting with you, you know?" Scorpius plopped down on his bum and began undoing his shoes. He wasn't supposed to wear them in the house. He met Draco's surprised expression with a cheeky grin. "I think you do too."
Harry reached up to push his glasses down off the top of his head, while doing so revealing his bewildered smile. "Quite possibly."
Scorpius didn't fancy crowds. The photographs were packed with people. This was definitely a different kind of family, something Scorpius wasn't used to. They were fun to look at. So many redheads. He had never seen this many people with orange hair before in his life, only in picture books. And he liked the way Teddy talked about them, with so much exclamations. Scorpius had never talked with anyone Teddy's age before. In fact, the only people he interacted with were children his own age and adults his father's age.
Teddy fluttered his innocent doe eyes at Harry. "Encourage me to do what?" He placed three cards down. "Three sevens."
He gulped his tea and then set his spoon down with a final clang, startling Draco. "What happened to you?"
Before long, Harry and Andromeda were waving goodbye to the departing train along with the throng of families on the platform. Teddy hung halfway out the window, a bright grin lighting up his face, ready to face adventures of Third Year with his friends, no doubt getting up to more shenanigans and trouble than the years before. Andromeda sighed wistfully. "Before long he'll be forging his own way in the world," she mused.
The four of them were playing Cheat. It was game of deceit. Each player had thirteen cards and they had to go in a circle playing cards face-down in ascending order starting with ace. If you didn't have a card to play, you could pass. Or, if you didn't have a card to play, you could lie and place cards down on the pile and hope that no one would call you out on it. So far Teddy and Draco had dwindled their hands down to just seven cards. Scorpius had fifteen in his hand and that left Harry with a whopping twenty-three that he was begrudgingly rearranging.
Draco rolled his eyes. Scorpius and Potter were always on the same side, and always pitted against him. Best not to engage at all.
Harry knew that feeling. He had felt the same apprehension when Teddy had started riding a broomstick. "You will," he assured Draco. They began walking to the manor. "One day you'll look at him and see yourself. You'll get used to it."
Draco picked up Scorpius' discarded broom off the grass and said, "I wonder if I'll ever get used to the idea of him flying."
"Harry said so," Scorpius told him. "He said it's okay to cry because then people will take care of you and be nice to you. He says it's okay to get mad too.
Harry dragged a hand through his hair in exasperation. "Look, I... It's not that I've forgotten all of that. But why does Scorpius have to pay for it?"
"And then what?" Scorpius asked his mother, prompting her to continue with her story that had been interrupted by Harry.
"Okay." Scorpius didn't know what else to say. "Bye." He turned and ran off to join his friends in the mess.
Less than five minutes later, Harry and Scorpius were on their way down the gravel path, walking away from the manor. Scorpius glanced over his shoulder to wave at his father. "Ooh, he is not very happy," he noted with an impish smirk directed at Harry.
Draco wasn't in the mood for this conversation so early in the morning. He twisted his arm to hide the Dark Mark.
He glanced up when he heard a soft knock against his open door. Draco stood there, his hands clutched in front of him. And those hands held neatly pressed leaves.
Draco pulled his gaze away from the window. The boys had marched out of the kitchen, taking their hullabaloo with them and leaving the kitchen quiet again. Harry was studying him with a kind expression. "I'm not fretting," Draco lied.
"But they aren't the only ones who think that, huh? Everyone thinks you're bad, huh? That's why you don't like to go to the park with me, huh?"
"What is it?" he asked his friends who were sprawled across the cushions on the floor. "Spit it out."
Draco looked down at the slender wand between his fingers and began absentmindedly fiddling with it. "You said you wouldn't."
"Dad says we can have lasagna for dinner and then cheesecake for dessert!" Scorpius crowed. "Because Theo's here, you see?"
"Inside," Harry murmured instead of handing Scorpius over. He turned away from Draco and walked down to the kitchen, trusting Draco to follow him in. Draco was too confused and tired to argue. He closed the door behind him, dragging his feet as he made his way through the dark house. He entered the kitchen just as Harry swished some dim lights on with his wand. Harry motioned for him to sit at the long banquet table. Once Draco had dropped into a chair, Harry handed Scorpius to him. "I'll make some tea."
Unfortunately for Harry, and usually he was more diplomatic than this, he chose that moment to glance down at his wristwatch.
"Huh?" That feeling was too abstract for a three year old to understand. But she did understand that he was feeling bad, so she plopped her ragged monkey doll down beside him. "Hug Minky," she ordered. Harry did as he was told. Then she brushed his hair with sticky fingers.
And when he gently laid their precious baby boy against her chest, she was filled with insurmountable emotion. She couldn't stop herself from pressing kisses onto Scorpius' warm cheeks. And when she looked up at Draco and saw him mouth 'thank you', she believed him. Wholeheartedly…
Draco was suddenly aware of the glances he was getting. No doubt news of the arrival of Harry Potter had traveled through the Ministry like wildfire. He shook off his trepidation, keeping his usual mask in place. It wasn't hard to do at all since he was immensely irritated and angry at the moment. His scowl came naturally to him. "You didn't have to wait."
Draco, having handed a towel to his son in the bathroom, now sat on the floor in the hallway, his back to the wall, nearly breathless.
They had reached 12 Grimmauld Place by then. Harry helped Scorpius out of his shoes and jacket, hanging up his backpack as well before ushering him down into the kitchen. Scorpius had his hands clasped shyly in front of him while he watched Harry get to work. Watching adults use magic was fascinating. It was amazing to see the things they could do. Like how Harry had conjured up white plates along with white mugs out of thin air.
that Potter was going to be his teacher, Stori." Draco now sat up straighter. "You don't know what I've been going through these past few months while you get to romp around the world."
"My father says that all the time." Scorpius squinted down at Harry's deft fingers. "He says it really quiet, so I can't hear him. But I still do." Tying shoelaces always looked like magic to him.
Harry tsked. Draco had a complex when it came to his relationship with Scorpius. For one thing, Scorpius adored his father. He thought Draco was one of the coolest people ever. Draco would do anything to keep being that person for Scorpius. That meant hiding his past, because his past had more than few demons lurking in it. Secondly, Draco wanted to provide as stable a life for Scorpius as possible, something his parents couldn't do for him. In his eyes, a stable life meant that the parent behaved as a parent should, and nothing more. Revealing to Scorpius that Draco wasn't just a father was not part of the plan, Harry knew that. "When will you stop lying to him?" he asked Draco.
Harry held the pillow to his face to muffle his embarrassed complaint and hide his foolish grin. Damn it, he really wanted Draco Malfoy.
Everyone pretended to not see Draco. He was used to being invisible. It was better than a confrontation.
Harry could hear his friends' hushed conversation as he walked away from the drawing room with Teddy in tow. "You shouldn't go through people's mail." He stalked into his cramped study. "It's an invasion of privacy and you could find yourself in hot water." He tossed the letters on the already messy desk. "I hope you don't go around opening your friends' letters at Hogwarts." He frowned in reproach at Teddy, who stood at the doorway chewing on his thumb. "You're such a bother these days."
"I never know with you." She paused for a moment, most likely thinking of what to do next. "Goodness, don't just stand there. You should be resting." She bustled over to Harry and forced him back into bed, despite Draco still sitting on it. Arthur cringed at his wife's bright idea.
"Oh, you don't know the half of it," Teddy crowed. "Harry's been on the most adventures out of any other person in the entire world ever. He's won every Quidditch game he has ever played. He won the Triwizard Tournament. He's swam with the merpeople and met the centaurs, you know? Harry and Ron and Hermione even know a giant. I've met him. His name's Hagrid. He works at Hogwarts. You'll meet him in a few years. He's really nice. And they've all learned a lot of curses; some of them are really
. Theo always brought chocolates for him from trips around the world. He also knew that Theo was Draco's best friend. He ran down the stairs with his backpack swinging wildly from side-to-side. He couldn't wait to see what Theo had brought him this time. "Hi, Uncle Theo!"
Scorpius wasn't sure yet. He pulled off a bigger piece and squished it in his hand. It was very greasy. "What should I make?" he asked Harry.
Teddy blew on the toasty marshmallow to cool it down before sliding it off the roaster. He handed it to Scorpius and said, "Prepare to have your entire world flip upside down."
Harry vaguely recalled being down here a few months ago, when he had had too much to drink. The cellar looked quite different when bathed in warm lantern glow. Opulent, one might say. The wine racks had expensive dust on them to show the valuable age of the wine nestled between them. The floors were rustic stone and the air was damp, cool. Wine wrapped around two of the walls, and there were a few barrels standing scattered on the floor. The lanterns were either affixed to the walls or simply floated near the rafted ceiling. There was a fortune down here, hidden under the Malfoy Manor. Harry gingerly pulled a bottle off the rack. The label was in Portuguese, something he couldn't read. Perhaps a Port wine, if he had to guess by the stenciled pictogram above the words.
Scorpius was bewildered because his father had never rushed him like this in the morning before. "Are we late?"
Draco interjected. "Astoria is a part of my life. She will always be part of Scorpius' life. Especially during the holidays, because it means a lot to them. They'll be close, despite... I mean, I hope you understand that."
"Yes, a short one. Decided to spend an evening with these two." Theo gestured at Draco and Scorpius.
Draco was in the middle of tidying up Scorpius' playroom when the boy ran in with his shoes on, laces undone. "There you are!" Scorpius exclaimed when he finally found his father after having looked for him all over the manor. "Look at me."
"Teddy is home for the holidays and he wanted to meet Scorpius. Would you like to bring him over this Saturday?"
Draco pushed through muddled sleep, beginning to wake up because of a strange stirring in his subconscious. It took him a little while, but he finally managed to break free and lift his heavy eyelids. It was still pitch-black outside. He was trying to figure out what had woken him up when he heard a soft rustle beside him. He rolled over onto his other side. When his eyes slowly adjusted to the dark, he could make out a small figure curled in bed beside him. Concerned, he pulled Scorpius into his arms. "What's wrong? Did you have a bad dream?" He hadn't even heard Scorpius come into his room.
Draco's disappointment showed plainly. The boys had already run upstairs. It was evident Scorpius had promptly forgotten about his gloomy mood now that his big brother was in town. He hadn't even acknowledged Harry in his excitement. Draco pulled the door open wider, inviting Harry inside.
"So... nothing, I guess." Harry wasn't looking forward to this shindig he had let Hermione rope him into. Every year, he was guilted into attending either a charity affair, celebration of life, or gala put on by the Ministry of Magic. Once the Boy-Who-Lived, always the Boy-Who-Lived, even after fifteen years. He would have to mingle with witches and wizards he would promptly forget the names of, pretend to be interested in policies he had no sway over, and generally be available for press photographs when he shook hands with countless dignitaries. "I wish I didn't have to go." Harry let out a martyred sigh. "It's dreadfully boring. Borderline unbearable. But someone has to do it."
Scorpius kept his eyes on his teachers. Even though his chest ached from nervousness, it wasn't the same scary feeling as the Christmas pageant. He had tried very hard to grow up since then. He felt a rush of adrenaline, making him giddy somehow. His voice wasn't loud, but he wasn't mouthing the words either. His gestures weren't wild, but he wasn't forgetting them either. He wasn't smiling, but he wasn't crying either. He was concentrating so hard, in fact, that Draco and Astoria could practically see the gears turning in their child's mind. When Draco glanced at Astoria, she seemed to be close to proud tears.
"Oh!" That was all the explanation the adults provided before they scurried out of the living room, evidently in search of Harry.
Draco couldn't bring himself to look at Harry. With his gaze trained at the floor, he shook his head. "I'm sorry for what I said."
He tried to remember the last time he had seen Malfoy. It must have been right after the war ended. At the time, his bitterness was strong and palpable. He hadn't even acknowledged the teen's presence in court. That family deserved whatever was dealt to them, he had thought then. But now, seeing Malfoy stumble into his home in the middle of the night, he couldn't help but feel abject pity. How the mighty had fallen.
Draco pushed open the door an inch and peeked into the dimly lit bedroom. He rested his aching head against the cold doorjamb as he watched his son sleep soundly, curled up near Harry, who lay atop the blanket with a careless arm thrown over Scorpius. The scene was incredibly laughable and straight out of a storybook. Draco's life was rather surreal at the moment, and the fever wasn't helping his case. He flicked his wand above the bed to cast a gentle stream of cold air across the room. Huddled this close together, it would be wonder if the two didn't wake up drenched in sweat. He shut the door behind him and walked downstairs where his work was spread out in the study yet again.
"I have a friend who is writing this great big book on fantastic animals and birds." Harry was referring to Luna. "Maybe I can ask if she knows of ways to lure peacocks out into the open. What do you think?"
The Weasleys were the exception. They had suffered horribly from the war and the Malfoys were an abomination. The wounds were still fresh in the minds of the Weasleys.
Harry urged Scorpius on encouragingly whenever their eyes met. The boy always felt his shaky voice calming down when Harry nodded at him like that. He was also glad for his friends standing on either side of him because they remembered all the words and helped him remember when he forgot. The four-minute performance felt like four hours to him, but he sang just like he had practiced, just like Harry had told him to. His hands were cold and his voice was hoarse as they neared the end, but he pressed on with his classmates without faltering. As long as he kept his eyes on his teachers, he wouldn't have to worry at all.
Harry walked them into his favourite busy pub and got a spot almost at once, being the celebrity he was. They ended up in a booth by the window. Teddy and Scorpius sat near the glass while Harry and Draco took the aisle. The boys stared out at all the sparkling holiday decorations and crowd in fascination, letting their breaths fog up the glass and then using their sleeves to wipe it off when they couldn't see outside any longer. Harry and Draco kept their gazes on the menus. Scorpius let his father order for him without fussing. He was sure that he would like
Harry stilled. Here's the reason Draco had asked him to tag along. "What isn't?" he asked and turned to Draco who was perched atop a barrel, wand in hand.
He clicked his tongue stormed out of the classroom. He would make damn sure that Scorpius wouldn't get hurt because of something like this, even if it meant antagonizing Potter. Scorpius had had enough disappointment for a lifetime. He grabbed his son by the hand and stalked out the front doors.
"Astoria has been busy," Draco corrected Harry. "She's done as she pleases to this place and gone off to her parties, leaving me to deal with it." He kicked some of the Christmas carnage further under the tree to hide it. "I'll be busy after she's gone, cleaning this up."
That comment snapped Draco out of it. "Wait!" He resorted to stepping out in just his socked feet because Harry was so damned keen to leave. "Where are you going?"
Draco watched the two of them join Teddy's Simon Says game. They got along well, the two of them. Annoyingly well. Draco often felt a twinge of envy when he saw how easily Harry could handle children. The only child Draco could stand was his own son. He would never have been able to wrestle the rest of the brats by himself.
"Yes, let's!" Scorpius threw his arms around Draco's legs. "Bye, Dad! Love you! I'll see you after school!" He zoomed out the house without waiting for a response.
Harry was handing out candy canes to the children. He wore a bright red winter sweater with flashy yellow and green lights trimming the edges. Beside him was his partner in crime, Gabrielle, dressed in a gingerbread man costume. The kids were milling around them, their hands outstretched for some sweets. Scorpius had no qualms about joining the masses, peeling away from his parents to get a piece of the spoils.
Draco did count on them. He had no doubt that Harry and Teddy would deliver on their promise to throw a great seventh birthday party for Scorpius.
Percy clicked his tongue in frustration. "The issue here isn't the children. It's Draco Malfoy. Is that a reality of your life too?"
Teddy beat Harry to the living room, and was celebrating despite loud protests from Harry that he had cheated. "My turn!" Scorpius shouted, already readying himself for the start of the race. Teddy was rearing to go too, not the least bit winded. Harry, in the meantime, was panting with his back to the wall. He was the first to notice Draco. He picked himself up off the floor and made his way over. "Did we wake you?"
"Don't be crass." What a mess. Draco felt filthy. With good reason too. He looked down at his white button-down shirt that was streaked with dust and grime. What the hell was Potter up to all day? Literally rolling around in this grubby house in his spare time? In fifteen minutes, Draco would have to sit down for dinner with his son, pretend to be perfectly normal. This was not something a normal person did.
"I like the excitement too." She lounged back against the cushions and gestured for Harry to hand her Rose. He carefully placed the little girl into Ginny's arms. Once they were settled down, she laid her head on his shoulder and they listened to Bill's quiet words that retold an ominous tale.
Teddy looked over his shoulder at Scorpius. "I probably kicked you a lot, huh?" He knew he was an excitable sleeper. Andromeda and Harry had made no secret of it. In fact, he sleepwalked so often that his friends at school had a Caterwauling Charm set around his bed to wake him if he decided to go on a night wander.
Rose giggled as Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. "That kid's a heartbreaker," he complained. "I would keep an eye on him." Harry laughed it off.
Draco returned his attention to the dishes, swishing his wand to clean them while his mind continued to wander as it had last night and this morning. He had been lying. Potter
strange conversation he was having with his teacher. But he was a Malfoy, after all. He narrowed his eyes at Harry and then turned around to leave without another word.
Draco looked up to find Scorpius standing by the doorway, half-hidden by the wall. He rearranged his expression and managed a weak smile. He gestured for his son to come closer. Scorpius shook his head and dropped his gaze to his socked feet. That made Draco's smile disappear. "Scorpius?"
Draco stifled a sigh. That had been cathartic. He sat down on the stiff chair, exhausted and troubled. He pushed down the wave of guilt building up in him. Harry deserved to hear every word of that. This was his fault, all of this. Surely.
But all of that had faded away as the memories of war became distant in people's minds as time passed. Draco had managed to get his hands on his current job a little over five years ago, just before Scorpius' birth. His desperation to support the new baby had led him to put aside his reservations and try hard to maintain a stable income. The hate letters and graffiti had stopped years ago as well, most likely due to a lack of retaliation on Draco's part. Eventually his last name merely elicited a sort of chill from many folks, but it did not invoke much hate or anger; just indifference.
He grimaced when he turned around to find Draco Malfoy standing at the doorway with a glower on his face and a overall menacing atmosphere emanating around him. Scorpius stood beside his father, looking a bit sorry and resigned.
Draco slapped a hand to his forehead as he watched his son dig the pencil into paper. Scorpius spoke out loud while writing so he could sound out the words, which meant Draco knew exactly what was going on. "What in heaven's name are you writing, Scorpius?"
"I know that magazine article was unexpected and people have been saying some strange things. But is that the only reason?"
The next day, Draco was in a right foul mood from the absurd 'conversation' with his son, fresh snow that had fallen the night before, and the Gringotts goblin who had taken him down a wrong turn, adding an additional ten minutes to what was supposed to be a quick stop at the bank. Now he was fighting his way out of there when he was jostled in the shoulder. He stumbled to the side, knocking into a crotchety old witch who snarled at him. He snarled back and then whipped his head around to glare at the offending party.
A familiar lump rose in Harry's throat. How had he messed things up so? He had never, for a moment, thought that he would end up hurting Scorpius like this. In the end, all he could do was walk away.
"All we require you to do is provide us with your own statement that proves otherwise. You may submit to Veritaserum testing or provide us with your memory of Saturday night, along with an affidavit that absolves you. It is the simple course of action."
Harry smiled in defeat. These boys had impeccable timing. Teddy surely couldn't handle any more of this.
By the time Scorpius clamored downstairs, he had all of twenty minutes to gobble up his eggs and toast, pack his lunch into his brand new backpack, and stuff his feet into his shoes. Draco helped him with his bag while Patricia did up his shoelaces. "We better get going now," she told him.
draw my stars," Harry said as he grabbed a scrap paper off the table and drew a five-point star without lifting his pencil.
Theo scoffed and made a show of looking around the grand dining room they were seated in, fitted with a crystal chandelier above them, white china in front of them, an enormous banquet table, marble floors, and antique paintings. "You say that like you don't live in a mansion, Draco."
"Don't worry. I think you're doing just fine now. Maybe some more medicine will help you get a bit of sleep." He rested a hand over Scorpius' forehead. It burned. "Something for the fever," he decided. "But I do have to warn you, it's going to be very gross."
Harry followed Draco through the manor, wondering why he had been asked along to pick an after-dinner drink. He knew next to nothing about fancy wine. Draco didn't make conversation as they climbed down the dark stairs. He had remembered his wand, unlike last time. He waved it once to light the wine cellar.
Theo left an hour later, thoroughly dissatisfied from the results of his attempted interrogation. Draco was glad for the silence once he had shut the front door. These days he was valuing his time alone and not having to constantly worry about how he appeared to others. He let out a quiet sigh as he flicked the lights off in the foyer. Sometimes he wondered if he should get better friends.
Hermione did see. She saw a photo of Teddy and Scorpius eating blue cotton candy. There was one with Harry beside Scorpius, pointing at something off frame that made them laugh. She didn't really understand
Harry stilled. He lifted his head to look at Draco in the dim light. Hesitating a beat, he asked, "Is this okay?"
Harry was undeterred. He didn't move away, and he didn't move any closer. He stood where he was, his piercing gaze trained on Draco. "Hmm."
you believe me, don't you?" Teddy proclaimed as he waved the letter in front of his friends' faces. Then he pulled it closer to read it. His eyes went wider and wider still as he skimmed the letter three times over. "Oh my goodness!" he hooted with laughter. Before his friends could ask, he had scrambled off of the bench and was racing down the Great Hall.
It's true. Ginny didn't look angry at all. She seemed sad instead. "You alright?" Harry hesitated before shaking his head. "Okay. I figured." She took his hand, made him sit on the couch, all the while pretending not to notice when he wiped his eyes. She sat beside him and opened the magazine to examine the incriminating photos. "Have you read it?"
They ended up in the living room upstairs where Scorpius climbed on Draco's lap and Teddy sat across from them. The older boy was tapping his foot on the floor, a habit he had picked up from his uncle Percy. When he tapped his foot like that, it meant that he had something very stern to say. He sat forward and asked Draco, "How come you never visited me?"
Draco realized he had touched a nerve. He was surprised that Harry hadn't given this much thought. "Or do we pretend to be completely normal and try not to kill each other?" he pressed on. "Because he's got it in his head that you and Teddy are part of the family. He won't let go."
"I'll miss you, Harry," Teddy pouted. He was on Platform 9 3/4 with Harry and Andromeda. They stood a little apart from the gaggle of Weasleys who were fussing over their children.
"She will be there," Draco snapped. Then he stormed off without bothering to hear a stuttering response.
Teddy promised Scorpius that they would hang out at least once a week during their summer break. Teddy was a man of his word.
"They were looking at your drawings. They really liked them. They said that whoever drew them had a great imagination."
," he said. This was the sort of nonsense he was trying to shield his son from. "You are his teacher. You have no right digging into his personal life, filling his head with fancy tales, playing mind games. He is a child. You have no right over him!" He snapped his teeth shut. He realized that he had gone overboard, let his emotions best him.
Even though the Malfoys were ultimately pardoned for crimes committed, they still played an enormous role in the mass deaths of the Second War. Lucius and Narcissa escaped the country as soon as possible, but Draco had refused to join them. He didn't want anything to do with his parents after all they had put him through. Most of the Malfoy assets had been possessed by the Ministry, save the manor and some investments. Draco was glad he wasn't left to wander the streets, at least he had a home. He couldn't find a job for ages because no one was willing to be in the room with him for longer than ten minutes. He was ridiculed behind hushed voices and discrete hands. The partitioning wall between the manor and the road was often vandalized with messages written in red. Prejudices ran high.
"Hey!" Teddy interrupted them. "Tell us about your Quidditch games. Scorpius hasn't heard about them yet. Harry's never lost a single match. He was a Seeker."
"You asked me whether it bothered me." Harry reminded him. "Being here, with you, in this place. You asked me what my ulterior motive was."
Scorpius could hardly believe his eyes when he arrived at the park on his birthday, hand-in-hand with Astoria and Draco. His parents had promised a surprise, but this?! He gasped. There were red, blue, yellow, and green balloons and twisted glittering streamers and a huge cake that was shaped like a broomstick and
"This summer for that Quidditch game. He can come over to the Burrow with me," Harry said. "All the kids play and he won't be the youngest either. It's a great time."
Once the children were occupied by the goodies in her bag, it was the adults' turn to squeeze the breath out of her. Her brothers were the roughest, of course, ruffling her hair and thumping her back. She was utterly disheveled when she got to Harry.
