"You should come by my tutorial sometime," he said, finally. "We always could always use some new ideas."
Draco cleared his throat and looked away. He turned his back, squelching in wet shoes on the wooden floor. “Turn around,” he said, barely loud enough to hear.
“I could be here just to catch up.” Draco picked at the tea bag tag, flicking at it with a petulant snick of his fingers. “I could just want a chat with someone in the know.”
As if summoned, Harry sauntered over, loose Muggle jeans comfortably at his hips, his pale grey pullover handsome against the light flush in his cheeks. Draco looked away from the too-long curl of his hair, staring at the rhythmic whorl of his drying clothes instead.
Can’t Potter see the affection in Malfoy’s gaze? It’s so obvious to you. They move like a matched pair of wands, like the bond between them is still true even though you’re certain it’s gone. Potter’s hand twitches when Malfoy’s moves; his eyes slip to Malfoy’s lips when he talks, like he wants to take everything but can't or won't.
Draco offered him the pack of Marlboros before he could think twice and watched him, voice in his throat.
Draco peered closer at him, at the vibrant maroon shade of his heavy cloak and the epaulettes at his shoulders and Harry’s wand held up at an awkward angle to get it into the frame. Portrait Harry was angry, mouth curled into a determined and slightly terrifying curl. The scar across his forehead was exaggerated, slicing down across his eye, his hair swept out of the way to emphasize the pale line against his warm skin.
She popped her gum.  "I mean, sure. That, I guess." She started walking her fingers over the top of the machine next to his. "But actually, I meant Dr. Draco Malfoy, the like, founder of Inter-Magical Relations. I'm dying to take your tutorial."
He hears Draco at the top of the bulkhead before he sees him, shouting into the wind, soaked through after only seconds on deck. They're both wearing thick wool and tar-coated jackets, and Harry had a hat at one point, though it's long gone, lost to the crashing, roiling waves but it doesn't matter, because he does feel a bit warmer now that Draco's there, doesn't he?
The rug squished under his feet. Harry stared at the ground, vision swimming, throat burning, salt soaked in every pore. Where was he? It must have taken a massive amount of power to Apparate from the middle of the ocean to somewhere on dry land.
They were nearly finished when the rain took to torrent. Suddenly, the air was thick with it, water filling every space where oxygen was meant to land, thick drops choking out the last bit of breathing room. The sky hung even lower, clouds not much higher than the mast.
“Right.” Harry nodded, and scrubbed a hand through his hair. He shivered despite the layered blankets and burrowed deeper. “I didn’t mean—”
“I like it when you kiss me like I might disappear,” Draco said, flicking ash into the fake grass flooring. “I could, after all.”
He tasted like none of the above, lips open and wet, and Harry kissed him and kissed him.  He put his hands on Draco’s face, rubbing his thumbs over his sharp jawline, his high cheekbones; he broke the kiss to breathe, nose against Draco’s nose, and pressed his thumb into Draco’s bottom lip.
Draco wanted to leave in the morning. They were meant to take a black-market portkey to the Continent. London felt like too many eyes, and the Ministry was only getting more and more violent. They could use only limited magic, if any, and knew that the Ministry tracked everything they cast with their wands.

“It’s the question I asked myself,” said Malfoy. Harry watched the arch of his lips and wondered if kissing this version of him was as good as it looked in the Mirror. “I spent months working on it, cleaning and restoring it to the best of my abilities.”
“James?” Harry shouted, rubbing the blood from his hands on his uniform. Scarlet on scarlet. He ran forward even though the door at the end of the hall seemed impossibly far. “I can hear your voice, please.” His hands shook. “Why are you doing this?”
It was close to closing time on that third day when Harry felt a presence near his shoulder. He didn’t bother looking away; Mirror-Harry and Draco were dancing together. Their evening had been perfectly mundane, sharing takeaway and laughing over some story Draco told with expressive hands and mirthful eyes. He couldn’t tell which one of them had set the radio playing, but if he focused, Harry could hear the tune, jazzy and light.
Harry curled closer still to him, pressing his warm body up against Draco’s. He cast a weak Rennervate over them both, letting the healing magic curl over them. It wasn’t his specialty, and it never felt as clean or as refreshing as Theo’s did, but it was good enough to ease the exhaustion of their time apart.
“I can’t get it to turn off,” Harry said again, shaking against Draco. Draco wrapped him with a thick towel and pulled him backwards. He stumbled against the wet tile floor, steam on the mirror and every surface.
if love is a whisper (it is a brook through the woods, bringing me to you). if love is a shout (it is written in the stars, singing to the world). if it is neither, then it must be only this (your hand in mine, as natural as the sea).
When their pants and trousers and shoes and socks were kicked aside, Harry reached for Draco’s arm. He slid the wand out of its holster and set it on the rest on the bedside table, neither of them breathing. It was an intimate thing, holding another man’s wand, and Harry did it without asking, as though it were a given.
Harry almost opened his betraying mouth again and tried to fix it with the words begging to unspool. It’s just that he was still getting used to using those words because he’d never really had a reason to say it. He still wasn’t sure when he was meant to say it and when it was too soon. How was he supposed to know that letting it roll off the sex-drunk tongue might mess up a perfectly good thing?
Ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy celebrates the publication of his autobiography, Love Letters from Azkaban: Or, How I Learned to Hope Again, an account of his five years imprisoned after the Second Wizarding War. Joining him on the congratulatory parapet is his esteemed husband and epistolary confidant, our saviour, Harry Potter.
Wolves mate for life, like cranes and married dancers in the fifteenth century and laughing lovers at Victorian masquerades. It’s fitting to begin this latest life as prowling enemies.
Draco was quiet. His knee bumped against Harry’s. Neither pulled away. The room was still but for the steady drip of water onto the rug.
“I think it’s for real this time. I’ve never seen him so impassioned,” Charlie shook his head. Draco frowned at the bricks behind him, trying to make sense of it all. “I swear, I haven’t seen him look this alive in four years.”
On the third day of the third week of the third year of Unspeakable training, Harry had received his triad assignment. Deep in the cavernous halls of Mysteries, Harry had put his wand hand forward, palm up. Draco Malfoy did the same, and Theo Nott completed the triangle. They knew the words, the spells, the motions.
“I’ve got it,” Draco says, and reaches across, flicking his rook into position. Ron grins, like he does when he’s about to destroy them, and makes his move.
At first glance as they stepped into the gallery, the portrait seemed innocuous. Portrait Harry was perhaps slightly more handsome, though Draco was beginning to notice the little details that made Harry so attractive in person. This portrait reproduced none of those details, not the freckle above Harry’s right eyebrow, nor the little bit of hair beside his left ear that never lies flat, and not even the slight bend to his nose. The portrait’s nose and hair and skin was perfect, a clean and idealized Harry that could never be.
“We’re safe enough for now, you ridiculous idiot.” Draco ran a hand over his face, through his wet hair.
voice. Harry lurched forward. The hall stretched and stretched. He looked backwards and the front door was a kilometer away, hidden in darkness. His shadow danced across the wall beside him, a grotesquerie of his red Auror uniform.
“Good,” Draco purred in his ear. They were in it together. “You’re doing so good. Cast for me, Harry.”
He was chatting with the brewer as he eyed the little noticeboard with its mutual aid offers, an ad for a new queer bookshop up the street, and a poster for an art expo showing over in Knockturn.
"I'll stay up for another few hours. Rest," Harry said, half-begged. If Draco stayed another moment, Harry would kiss him with all the force of feeling he wasn't allowed to have.
The healing charm sizzled across Harry’s skin, numbing away the miniscule bite of pain. Draco was so fucking close.
Auror, you know? But it’s so much worse inside, Malfoy, you have no idea. What you see out here, that’s just the surface.”
He cleared his throat, tossed the remaining bits of clothing, including those cursed red pants, into the dryer and shut the door.
Draco stole a bit of cheese in retribution, scowling.  The stale bread always tasted better after a fight, and even better with a thick cut of cheddar. “Was it luck?” Draco asked.  It wasn’t luck that he kept so many weapons on him when he and Harry went to meet a new coven, and it wasn’t luck that put him in between anything that would have it out for Harry.
“We should—” Draco stuttered and stopped, his body seizing with the chill. He was always so put together. Was Harry allowed to pull him in close? Draco had let him wrap a scarf around him last night. “We need to get warm.”
“In my fourteen years in a department I am not allowed to name, I have studied three emotions. I need not discuss fear today, nor guilt. Indeed, I have discovered far more about the sense of ‘joy’ in this man’s arms than anywhere else. May we keep discovering it together.”
Draco’s only solace was the ever-growing pile of books, nicked from big, corporate bookstores and purchased from little shops whenever he had the galleons to spare.
Draco couldn’t help himself. He reached out and pulled Harry closer, sliding his fingers into Harry’s hair tucking his other hand under the back of Harry’s loose shirt.  “Another feral vamp managed without a scrape on either of us,” Draco said into Harry’s smile, bringing him closer with the press of his fingers.  Draco broke the kiss suddenly, “Is that,” he tugged at the weapons belt tucked inside Harry’s waistband.
“You need to go get checked out,” Draco says, nodding towards the nurse’s station behind the door, which is bustling with mediwix and potions carts and noise. “Let me take care of him.”
Draco found a suitably small alcove in the shadows of a small chapel made of yellowed stone. He cast
,” slipped from his lips too easily, the magic building in his hand, in the place where Draco’s hand was against his, charged and ready.
,” Draco said beside him. “It’s another illusion. I’m right here.” He put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, steadying, comforting.
The water was disturbed, bubbling and moving as if drawn downwards by something too heavy to float. Harry shivered, stepping closer to Draco. “Is it the ghost?”
"She's going to change the world," Harry agreed. He stepped towards Draco, till he was leaning against the machine right beside him and there was not much space left between them.
“I know,” Draco said. He pressed his shoulder into Harry’s and Harry softened even further, giving him that gentle little smile that he saved only for Draco. There was something dark in Harry’s eyes too, right at the corners, a little too mischievous.
Harry had gone a bit red at the ears, the way he did when he was in an uncomfortable situation and Draco had learned to stop trying to get him out of these moments. Harry cleared his throat. “I’m not an Auror.”
“A pressure point,” he said, too eager, too excited, “I think it might be a real breakthrough, or at least we have to try.” Draco looked nervously around the room. The man with the laptop and the biro pen in his ear was still typing with a passion. The woman in the corner, tucked up the chair was looking rather teary-eyed at her novel. A new person had entered, with short gray hair and a sharp nose. Draco’s attention slipped from her as quickly as it had passed over her, back to the man across from him and the coffee swirling steam under his nose.
“Look, Potter, we’re going to need to share that bunk in a moment. Please don’t make this more difficult — more awkward than it needs to be. We don’t do this at work.”
And Draco had stared at him like he was feeling it too, big grey eyes bare to him, soaking in every bit of Harry like he was more important than breathing. Maybe Harry was a fool for thinking that looked like love.
"You didn't miss me, even a little bit?" Draco drawled, voice echoing in the small lamp at Harry's side.
It might have been better if he’d just called the day off and gone back to bed, but that would have been the lucky choice.  Instead, he pulled his three best dress shirts out of the laundry and frowned at them.  Instead of crisp white, the shirts were an awkward shade of pale pink, streaked at the shoulders and utterly embarrassing.  Draco ripped the rest of the laundry out of the machine, appalled at the tinge that covered every one of his light-colored items.
The Mirror-Harry was so happy. He smiled like he’d never been in a war, like he’d never died before. He laughed and touched Draco like he was allowed to want that. The other Draco — and he couldn’t bear to call this man Malfoy — he touched Harry too, as though he couldn’t stop even if he wanted to. In this meadow, Draco touched his hand as he poured more champagne, he fed Harry grapes and played with the hair at the back of his neck, and listened to Harry speak like it was the only thing that mattered.
It’s obvious from the start that the second shift didn’t tell them the bond was broken. If it weren’t half three in the morning, and if you weren’t dead bored with the rest of the caseload, you probably would have gone in and done your Healerly duty.
He kept moving, shifting closer to the Malfoy in his arms, the Mirror — for the first time — entirely forgotten.
Harry pulled off his thick scarf. He was going to offer it, but Draco leaned forward, so he wrapped it twice around Draco’s neck instead. And if he let his hands linger over the soft wool where it rested beneath his chin, well, that could be platonic.
The sneering fighter held him there, at swordpoint’s kiss, knees in the dirt and begging. The boy who lived to live again, mercy at his lover’s blessing.
You ought to go see what caused that awful crashing noise, but you’ve been in their room three times already and you really don’t want to have to walk out in the middle of your shift.
and even that looked tired, a paler white. But his eyes, those tell-tale Weasley eyes, deep whiskey-brown, they had a certain spark that looked a lot like hope. Draco wanted it to be hope.
One would expect a vampire never needs a bath, but blood-drunk and vulnerable, Harry lolls in my arms. Soap in my hands, in his hair, I wash away the burden of his curse, and beg, silently: let me carry it instead.
“Right, er,” Harry was nervous, that much was obvious. His fingers flicked at the little paper tag on his tea, tugging at it, and Draco wondered how long it would take to crumble. Near the front of the room Ander was getting ready to speak, which would surely take a half-hour.
In return, Harry offered only a single memory. He let it sink into the Legilimency link between them, like words whispered on a pillow late at night or early in the morning.
Draco cleared his throat. "I'll need three new shirts," he said. "From Twilfitt's, he'll have my measurements. In white.  You can bring them tonight."
“I mean it,” Harry looked at him then, a fierce intensity in his eyes. “You and me. It doesn’t,” he hesitated, but set his jaw. “It doesn’t get better from here, I don’t think.”
I wondered but didn’t say. I watched him, dimmed Lumos on his ashen face, sleepless late into the night.
Though his body still rocked with the memory of the boat, Harry was on stable ground. Under the shower spray, almost too hot to bear, Draco held him tenderly. Soap suds sluiced between their bodies, rinsed from Harry’s hair, the last vestiges of seaweed and sea-sweat down the drain.
“You’re an idiot, Potter,” Draco laughed, smiling, cheeks pink with exhilaration and the wind and the thrill of looking at Harry.
“I summoned a cuppa for Potter and he was displeased with the amount of cream I added to it — a perfectly reasonable amount if I might add, which he claims is scanty. Scanty!” Malfoy rolls his eyes at Potter.
“Do you want to see the garden?” Harry asked, finally, when he’d stopped searching for the edge of the paper among Draco’s clothes.
“We are here to protect you,” the Minister went on, and again, the Auror forces seemed to glimmer with something more divine than human, some cruel extra magic about them. Draco looked back at the pair of women, but they had disappeared into the crowd, any sign of their flashing little pens lost amid the cheering crowd.
On the morning of the fourth day, Harry’s scarf went missing. Or rather, he realised it had been missing. Digging through his bag, through the tangled sheets, the patterned fabric was nowhere to be seen.
“I might,” sighed Draco, but he didn’t look serious anymore. He yawned around another puff, smoke curling out his nose and the corners of his lips. “Is it terribly gauche if I ask you to sleep in my bed — only to sleep?”
“It’s a bit less about showing,” Draco began carefully, closing his eyes and relishing in the feeling of Harry’s hands, warm and gentle over his thin jumper. “More so about feeling. Listen to the magic, the way that it ebbs and flows.”
Draco was still warm when they found him, but it was too late. It was too late, and Harry’s hands were hot on his chest, begging him to breathe. He wasn’t breathing and Harry thought he’d be sick with the impossibility of his sudden stillness. Draco was still, warmth fading.
“Why New York?” Draco had asked, voice hoarse, as he leaned over Harry to begin a litany of healing spells over a deep gash on his thigh. Harry leaned back against the weathered wood wall — this was more a shack than anything else — and watched him, unflinching. It had been a sort of game, in the beginning. Pretending like they weren’t in as much pain as they really were. It made for easy
And the Oblivator — “Maia,” she’ll remind him, “Call me Maia, Harry” — will look old enough to be the original decorator with big hair and bright clothes. Harry will spend more time staring at her inked, psychedelic forearms instead of her eyes as he complains; it’s easier to pretend he’s not really there, to lose himself in the incandescent tattoos instead of grief.
“You won’t remember it tomorrow,” Harry said through another devastating kiss, “you’ll forget it all when the curse restarts.”
Another memory: Draco was in his bed, hands moving, working over Harry’s body, nails on Harry’s skin, staring at him with those same intent eyes.
Draco eased the paper out of his hands, and it was back away in some hidden pocket in the many folds of Draco’s coat before Harry could really process it all, and then Draco’s hand was away and Harry ached for its absence all over again.
“Careful.” Draco wrapped his other arm around Harry. His whole body slotted against Harry’s, as steadying as the mast and the deck underfoot. “Do you think a Killing Curse would do it?”
“Malfoy,” he shouted against the wind. The rain was still light, but he could smell downpour in the air. The sky was fit to burst.
Draco caught his eye and held it. Tied in place, Harry said nothing. They had rules; Harry followed them. They made it work.
Draco, breathless, shoved at his shoulder and curled a possessive hand over his bicep. “You started it.”
The sound of her desk shattering into a thousand pieces at Harry’s feet splinters in my ears. I reach for him, feel his real self, wet and warm in my arms, still slick from the soap. I’ll watch this horror for him; I’ll tell him he’s not the monster he thinks he must be.
“I don’t know if you’ll like this,” Charlie grinned, the corner of his lip turning in such a flattering way, dimpled and yet he could never be described as sweet. “There’s someone new, but he’s just starting out in this life too.”
“I don’t remember you.” Draco said it simply, but Harry felt it like a Crucio. “I don’t remember this,” he glared at the photograph of them laughing together, at their decorations stolen from the Manor, at the solitary bed.
Harry was distracted now too, his eyes on a confused student pressing the same button again and again.
Later, he lit it wordlessly and wandlessly, laughing over their shared meal. With the candle’s watchful power, he waited to hear the lie in Draco’s affection, but it never came.
A soft voice at his ear startled him, but Draco didn’t turn, looking forward. He felt and heard a body step beside him, so close that their shoulders brushed and Draco could feel gentle fingers at the back of his hand. “
“Thank you, Charlie,” Draco said, and meant it. There was something settled in his chest. That nervous energy that had been building for weeks (or was it months? nearly a year?) had eased its awful grip and Draco’s chest. He pressed the folded paper into his hand and looked towards the end of the alley, preparing for a Disapparition jump.
“But if I’m being honest,” Draco continued carefully, taking on a quieter voice, “and I am trying to be honest. I couldn’t stand to stay here.”
Harry had been wandering through the exhibit for most of an hour, and surely that was enough. He could remember the amulets and the sword, and something else, but he’d be able to tell Hermione about what else was on view.
“Auror Potter! Oh, Merlin above, I can’t believe it’s you in the flesh, Auror Potter,” a security guard interrupted, thrusting a hand out to shake. He wore neat black slacks, a Muggle radio at one hip and a wand holster at the other, as was the uniform for guards in this wing. He was eager, eyes wide and nearly sweating with excitement. Draco levelled a dark glare at him which might have deterred a less enthusiastic attendant, but not this man.
“I’d ask what you’re doing here,” Draco started, not unkindly this time, “but I rather think that’s obvious, isn’t it?”
When the Forbidden Forest finally stopped burning, the ground remained too hot to get near it. Burdened with his Service Assignment and trimmed head-to-toe in fire resistance charms, Draco stepped into the ash. Amid the charcoal branches, he found a second sprig of hope: the bloom of a dittany flower.
“I did. I couldn’t stomach it,” he said, and really did look sick. “This is no better than during the War. They say it’s to protect us, to keep wizards safe, but,” he shook his head, wordless, and looked at Draco with worried eyes. “I thought I could fix it, staying there,” he added, “be a
The leader took a step forward, repeating his warning to give up his wand and raise his hands. Draco’s hands were raised, and he was looking for any chance of escape, though the possibilities were rapidly disappearing.
“How is this different?” Draco paused a foot from Harry, stopping the world from turning and the boat from rocking under Harry’s feet. “We’re still working.”
Draco looked at him, and for a second, it felt like they were back in action with Harry on the defense, his Protego prepared and ready to safeguard Draco. Harry had entered Unspeakable Training with the ghost of too many lost weighing on his mind.
He poured hot water into both mugs, unspooled a tea bag into each and tied the tag on the handles to keep it from slipping into the scalding water. Steam swirled  into the air, aromatic with the scent of Assam. An invisible hand ghosted over Harry’s shoulders and sparkled at the mugs.
“If they can’t break this, I’m going to have to kill you, Potter,” comes the posh voice in bay three. “Can’t spend my whole life tied to an idiot saviour.”
“Harry Potter,” the Illusion said in Draco’s voice, and that ached even worse. Draco rarely called him Harry, and when he did, it was meant to be special. “Saviour of the Wizarding World,” the Illusion teased. There was something off about the voice, in that it seemed to come from the Illusion’s chest, rather than his mouth, and Harry looked away, sick with it.
” Spike murmured to the man, turning to the large coffee pot in the corner. They poured a drink for Draco, putting in two sugars and offering Draco the spoon, which he took gratefully. He stirred three times, and each time found himself breathing just a little bit easier.
Harry’s face didn’t appear on a wanted ad, but he didn’t appear in the newspaper either as an “Apprehended Threat.” Shayla appeared a week later, and Draco thought that it might be the first time he’d ever seen her without Jill at her side and a biro in hand and it made his chest ache.
Harry dropped his hand away and held them behind his back, afraid if he didn’t, he’d try to touch Malfoy again. He had no right to touch this Draco — this Malfoy.
“Are you here to chat?” Harry sipped his tea. It had gone mostly cold, the weak warming charm on the mug long worn away. “We can talk. Gee, Tell me, Draco, how has your past nine months been? Gone on any fantastic vacations?”
Harry glared at the second chair, considering. Draco made a note in one of the margins, again in writing too difficult to discern.
As he watched, Draco’s magic wove into the threads, lighting up the geometric meander of yellow at the border so that it began to swim. Harry sighed at it, entranced by the swirl. It pulled him in, a perfect, undulating optic, and he let himself swim in it, he let the tension drain from his body, till his hand on the mug was heavy and his knees felt like they belonged to the couch. The flowers began to bloom, somehow more red than they had ever been.  He could breathe again, the anger at Draco's disappearance, at Theo's death, at all of it out of his control fading like the colors worn from the carpet.
Draco turned another page. He was so intense when he was on a case, like the world around him wasn’t real, like whatever it was he was researching was the only thing that mattered. He could do anything, if he put his mind to it. That was the dangerous thing about Draco; he could tear the whole world apart if he decided that was what he wanted. But he was good now, or trying to be, and most days, Harry thought that was enough.
“Watch,” Draco added, dissolving the hawk. He lifted his wand and cast and a duplicate Draco faded into reality behind him. It wasn’t perfect, not to someone who knew Draco as intimately as Harry did, but to an ordinary person, this was him, no doubt. The phantom walked across the room lithely, an almost-human calibration.
these days? Because that’s such stellar journalism.” Harry interrupted him with something unintelligible, something pleading and gentle, Draco could tell from the way his voice lilted that it was his last attempt to beg Weasley to run with them.
Harry ducked into the tent and returned, shoving a jumper and a pair of joggers into Draco’s side. The sweater had that campfire smell of too many nights spent searching for heat in the flames.  He pressed his nose into the collar.  It was a smell that reminded him of Harry, that sense of life and risk tied up together.
“I’ve been around,” Draco said petulantly. He stretched out his feet and Harry glared at the scuff on the toe of one of his neat shoes.
Harry rolled his eyes and ducked under the water, resurfacing close to Draco’s rock.  The lake was relatively shallow, but he floated, leaning on the rock and kicking his legs back.  He flicked water at Draco and Draco scowled until Harry pressed a damp kiss to his knee, soaking the fabric of his joggers in the process.
Deep in the greenery, there was a small metal bench, rusted in two places and so old it had grown into the bushes in several places. Draco liked to entertain him by making shapes and figures in the iron back, twisting the metal with the tip of his wand. He didn’t make any illusions tonight.
The laundry machine in his flat had finally kicked the bucket after months of horrible squealing noises and leaking on the floor.  The landlord had patently refused to repair it, claiming that it still worked “well enough.”  Functional or not, Draco was left with a slightly-damp pile of clothes and a frankly sour mood.
Without meaning to, Draco stepped closer to Harry, brushing against his shoulder. Harry’s middle knuckle brushed against his thumb. He didn’t take Harry’s hand, didn’t know yet if he had the right to do so, but that softness there felt like a tether back to the ground beneath their feet.
“Welcome to the Library,” not-James said, tilting his head. He pulled his hands off the keyboard, but it kept making noise like he was typing. “What subject will you be studying today?”
Besides the current event commentaries and opinion pieces, a tap of the wand and the right code word would reveal a location for meetings with “Like-Minded Wizards & Non-Magical Folk Alike.” Draco had been coming to the shop and attending the secret meetings for nearly half a year, and the person who owned the shop knew him and his order, a coffee, two sugars, stirred three times clockwise, by heart.
Though Harry had never seen Draco out of his club wear, the neat oxfords by the door were so obviously his.  There was a tawny peacoat on a hanger by the door; someone —
They ended up on the porch, a spliff split between them, sweet smoke curling into the chill night air. Draco’s bare feet landed in Harry’s lap as he lounged across the posh outdoor couch, taking up far too much space for a man so lithe.  Harry ran his hands over the arch of his foot, the delicate curve of his ankle.  He counted Draco’s toes.  And oddly, Draco let him.
“You missed the last rendezvous,” the man said in a more familiar tone, voice hushed. There was a soft jazzy ambient music playing over the room, muddying the noise of the various Muggles milling about. They were all so carefree. One woman was reading in the corner, fiercely invested in a dog-eared novel, cozy on one of the public couches. In the other corner, a man sipped his coffee and typed away at a silver Muggle computer, fingers flying, a biro tucked behind his ear.
Draco snapped out with his hand, shooting a body-bind curse at her which she deflected, stepping towards him. He looked at her shoes, curling his lip up at the tarnished red leather, listening to the air for her next wand movement.
“It’s not posh,” Draco complained, stepping close to him, just far enough to feel his warmth but not close enough to touch.
There was a cup of coffee in an old camp mug, metal and dented on one side, blue paint chipped at the handle, waiting on the little wooden table under a Stasis charm.  Draco dissolved it and took a long drink, feeling the warmth pour through his chest faster than a heating charm.  It was bitter and a little stale, but it tasted like Harry’s magic and that made it alright.
The laws were clear: robbing the Ministry was a felony, with a minimum sentence of two years in Azkaban. Kidnapping was five years. The law was less clear about whether sneaking a consenting suspect out of Ministry holding counted as theft or kidnapping, but Harry was about to find out.
He landed somewhere near Kent and turned for another Apparition jump. Six was key to losing a tail, though he saw no obvious sign of his assailant’s partner following him. Perhaps he had caused her more damage than he had meant to do.
“That wasn’t a ghost,” he said, finally, and met Harry’s gaze. His eyes were pale grey and intent, resolved. “I’ve never heard reports of it outside pure mythology, but that didn’t act like a ghost.”
They finished rinsing, Draco’s gentle touch on every inch of Harry’s skin. They could leave the boat and the Siren behind them, curl up in the big bed upstairs and stay until morning.
, isn’t he? That’s what Harry’s been on about.” Draco said the words out loud and knew immediately that it was true. He scuffed his wide brown boot against the ground, staring at the loose bits of brick fallen from the wall behind him, lost to the dirt over time.
They didn’t make it back to the dance floor.  Harry lost the plot somewhere between Draco’s fingers slipping into his belt loop and the alley and the door to Draco’s flat.
How could his heart’s desire be breakfast with Draco Malfoy? He could smell the coffee as it brewed, Draco’s hands on the french press, so familiar and yet impossible. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy in years, and certainly had never watched him making coffee in only his briefs. And he’d never seen that kitchen before, brightly lit with fluttering pale green curtains and an antique clock on a handmade shelf and jars and jars and jars of spices along the counter.
“Thank you so much,” Potter says to you, like he’s trying to ingratiate himself. It works less well when he’s shoved into a single hospital bed in a gown he doesn’t need to be wearing, touching Draco Malfoy from shoulder to calf. “I was wondering,” Potter continues, “what your opinion is on the proper ratio of coffee to cream and sugar.”
“We can get breakfast in town too, if you like,” he murmured, eyeing Harry’s bare feet as they started the short walk back to the campsite.
He could see the appeal of a life at sea. Here, he could forget about all his land-going worries. All that mattered was the wood beneath his feet and at his back and the noise of water against the hull. There was no Muggle smog clinging to the air, nor the dense flavour of too much magic all in one place.
Charlie avoided his gaze by digging in the satchel he wore across his chest, pulling out three large flagons of what Draco could only hope were Polyjuice. He opened one, eyeing the bubbling liquid inside. It looked right, smelled alright, but one could never be perfectly certain.
Harry took the aged parchment and ran his fingers over the neat scrawl of ink on the surface. It was a little note about Theo’s plans to snag dinner for them on some random night late at the labs. It was nothing important, and yet the paper felt heavy in his palm, frighteningly real. Harry pressed his thumb into the crease of it, like he could feel Theo’s quill on the other side, wet with ink and still alive, still moving.
of their magic as they stood in the station. He could see the way that not a single busy New Yorker noticed or cared about the group of wizards in odd clothing was blocking up the pathway. The Aurors moved around them, as New Yorkers never do, unbothered by the little bubble, leaving Draco and Harry to be even more tightly surrounded.
Harry shivered. There was a violence to that word, but it didn’t matter because Draco’s breath was hot against his ear, his tongue, his lips, something wet against his earlobe.
,” Draco snapped without malice, as he kicked his boots off, pulling out a dangerous-looking spring-assisted knife and a taser.
They’d spent every minute together since the ghost had attacked Harry. It was necessary, so they slept tangled together in the bunk, legs and arms too close for anything to come between. They didn’t talk about it. The work required closeness, so they stayed near.
If they had not been in a Muggle venue, surrounded by the barista, the man with the biro, and the woman with the book, Draco could have won this fight, he knew that to be a fact just as he knew the true color of his partner’s eyes. But they
“Nice,” Draco said flatly, retreating like he’d cast an Occlumens across the readable surfaces of his body.
would bounce off steel and come back boomeranging into the casting hand of the shortest of the six attackers, like he hadn’t just had a lucky guess.
A hand touched his hand and Harry took it, reflecting the motion of his Mirror self. Draco Malfoy’s hand fit in his as promised: as though it belonged.
and even one or two reporters from the Continent, Quick Quotes quills scribbling furiously. And there, amid the ranks of the rookie Aurors, Harry Potter stood shoulder to shoulder with Ron Weasley and another pair of burly Auror-types.
In a pique of irritation, Harry bent over the washbasin in the corner of the cabin. He sluiced cool water, fresh from his wand, over his hands. There was a mirror fragment hung on the ship’s wall above the washbasin, a sharp, odd shape that cut across his chin and forehead awkwardly.

I can’t help but touch him as the last of the Polyjuice fades away, fingers following rivulets of water to track familiar lines across his collarbones, to press into the divot on his chest where he died (
“So demanding,” Harry muttered, too low to be heard under the thud of the music.  He didn’t care.  Draco could demand whatever he wanted if it meant Harry would end the night with his tongue pressed to Draco’s collarbone, his hands in Draco’s back pockets.
Draco draped himself behind the helm, half-hidden by the massive wooden wheel. He was barefoot, long arched feet dangling and touchable. Harry wanted to reach for him, put Draco’s back on the deck and kiss him. But they had a rule: never at work.
There were so few things he could control when he was running. Not how long he would have in one city before the next. Not the moments he could steal to press his fingers into Harry’s skin, to taste him on his tongue again. Not even his own face in the mirror. But Draco could control who he trusted. And that was the way of changing the big things: trusting with your heart in front.
, “—six, to start.” Harry nodded, and Draco held his hand as tightly as he could, visualizing a little shop outside of Dublin that sold thick hand-knit sweaters in every color imaginable.
“The Wizarding Heritage Museum,” Draco hummed, raising his hands in mock celebration. “You know this one will be hidden away, off into storage.”
"I'm not a pureblood," she snapped her gum. "Taking the tutorial so it'll show up on my transcript." She leaned in conspiratorially, "and 'cause Harry's an amazing teacher."
The lightning gleam of his helmet crest gave the camp away, and when their captors rained metal fury, that helmet saved his day.
. Harry recoiled, though he couldn’t deny it. They’d never given this a label, never claimed any sort of permanence for themselves.
“We should review the statements,” Draco said, finally. He stepped back,picked up his empty mug, and stomped down the hatch. “Maybe we’ll see her tonight.”
“I think we should visit her today,” Draco said quietly.  He reached for Harry, plucking a bit of green algae out of his hair and tossing it aside as an excuse to press his fingers over Harry’s temples.  Harry leaned into the touch, almost purring at it and Draco kept up the motion.
Without saying goodnight, Harry turned and stomped over to the bunk. He sprawled across it, taking up far more room than he was due, though the heavy wool blanket was a simple comfort. Draco could freeze until he decided that staring at fruitless papers would get them nowhere.
Harry pointed his wand at the man across from him. No, he had a son. He had two sons and a daughter.
“Don’t I?” Harry said, stepping closer to him, and it was so obvious that Draco ached with it. The saviour of the wizarding world was trying to pull. And it was bloody working. He swallowed hard, dropping the cigarette and stomping it out with the toe of his boot.
that problem number three is at the door. Sylvan is willowy, with a melodic accent and sparkling brown eyes and it’s no wonder Potter’s noticed him.
“None of that,” Harry grumbled, reaching for his spent cock. “It’s my turn, wouldn’t want you thinking I only go one way.”
Draco points to the illustration, gilded and gleaming off the page. “The author of this book didn’t know where it was.”
Harry visited the Mirror daily at the Tate Magique. Even among the noisy, nosy tourists, nobody stared at the Mirror like Harry did. Not even Harry understood the hours he spent lost in it, glued to his other self’s mundane domesticity. How could his soul’s desire be breakfast with Malfoy?
Second, never bring a tail back to a safe house. Also easier said than done, though Draco’s skill at detecting and losing a tail was improving day by day.
The fourth time, Harry really did see Draco. There was a little coffee shop off the beaten path, tucked far in the corner of Horizont Alley and only discoverable if you knew the right sorts of people.
Harry wouldn’t let Draco see it. Draco didn’t protest. There was something heavy in Harry’s eyes and maybe that was the Forest of Dean and maybe that was the note and maybe that was just a part of Harry that Draco could never understand. Such was the way of being on opposite sides of the war.
And finally, trust nothing, not even your own mind. There had been a horrible close call about a year into running, about six months after they’d started passing rendezvous plans nonverbally. And Draco really should have caught it sooner. They usually passed subtle places to Apparate to to find each other again: a street name, a store window. Something small but
Draco caught those blue eyes and found that familiar softness in them, and a twist of something eager. “I have a lead,” the blond man whispered.
The silence between them was palpable, like a vacuum consuming every exhale, turning it into pressure. Harry tapped his fingers against the leather of the couch, a staccato pattern of three. First finger, third finger, ring finger. Draco echoed it, rapping his nails against the ceramic mug. They went back and forth like that, a conversation without words.
“How many more have you got?” Harry asked, running a lazy finger along the outside seam of Draco’s trousers.
Harry's fingers flick against the back of his other hand. It's barely a reassurance, but it sends Malfoy's heart rate spiking anyway.
Draco pushed him, so he stumbled against the washbasin. The wood against his back, Draco plastered against his front.
First, never kill an enemy when survival is still possible. This one was easier said than done in many cases, and though he regretted each one, Draco had left more than a few bodies in his wake. Such was the necessary way of defending oneself.
Three days later, Draco’s face was plastered on every corner, bitter and angry, with the label of “Anarchist - Violent Threat” beneath. There was a reward for him, apparently. Draco started sleeping on various couches, carrying a mobile brewer with him so he could keep the first batch of Polyjuice going.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, prodding him. Harry blinked sleepily at him, woken from a deep dream.  Draco pressed closer under the blankets, warm hand over Harry’s beating heart.  “You’d tell me, if you were leaving me, right?”
Draco continued as though Harry hadn’t interrupted. He was using his official voice, the one that made everyone in the Archive stop and listen to him when he presented on their research. “It’s clear that it chose you — for whatever reason, I won’t speculate — probably in the same way it chose the previous victims.”
If they were at home and Draco were still asleep like this, Harry might allow himself to touch. He’d run his hands down Draco’s shoulders, slip his fingers under Draco’s waistband. Draco would wake and curl closer in his arms and they’d fuck sweet and dirty in Draco’s massive bed.
Draco brushed a hand over the molding on the door, wishing he could push through and reach out to Harry. “No— yeah, I know that,” Harry got in, before Weasley cut him off.
Draco could barely stand when they landed somewhere in Canada, the soft bustle of a crowd outside their little alley a reminder of how short this little bubble of peace could be.
“I could make you a constellation,” Draco promised, as he did every time they sat under the stars together. Harry pressed his knees against Draco’s warm thigh and watched the sky. Draco lit up the stars with his wand, moving them until they formed the body of a phoenix, wide wings like galaxies spit among the great black expanse. “I could make you whatever you wanted.”
“I know you have your reasons, and they’re good ones,” Charlie said quietly, running a hand over his mouth in a move that was somehow both attractive and embarrassed. “But Ron— he’s turned. He’s— He reached out to Harry, I don’t even know how he got through.”
“I think we could build something pretty beautiful,” Harry breathed. “Not just us, like you and me, but all of us.” There was a sound behind them, someone entering the gallery. Draco let his eyes linger on Harry’s chin, memorizing the little freckle there, slightly darker than his warm brown skin. He looked at the painting on the wall, thinking of Harry like a column, sturdy enough to withstand the twisting grasps of time.
Once dry, they pulled on clean jumpers and trousers wordlessly, avoiding each others’ gazes. It was ridiculous because they’d seen each other naked and yet this felt more intimate, as though their bodies, chilled by the rain and sudden onset of night, were completely bare.
“Say it again,” Harry murmured finally. “They’re shutting down the magical wing of the British Museum because of this painting, but not because of this painting?”
Draco moved quickly, Summoning the tent out of their extended bag.  He tossed the shrunken thing into the air over a wide mossy patch and cast at it.  It erupted into a neat white tent, the entrance about as tall as Harry.  It was well-worn, with a patch stitched messily across the front and a gouge along the bottom right corner, but it was better than the shack against the wind.
The blond man put a hand across the table, brushing a single finger over the arch of Draco’s right knuckle, pale fingers stark against the body Draco wore today — against Draco’s warm brown skin. It was the barest touch, as gentle as a breath of air across his skin and he shivered imperceptibly, lifting his pointer finger to caress over the arch of his fingernail. This man worked with his hands, that much was clear from the scarred and calloused roughness to it. It was better not to wonder at such things, better not to ask where this body had been.
“If this is our history,” Draco nodded to the painting, “showing us happy with the Muggles. What does that say about a government that claims we cannot possibly be safe with them?”
The young woman chasing him put a hand on his arm just as Draco fell out into the other side of the gaggle of people and he very nearly turned to catch her eyes. That would be his downfall, a powerful Legilimency link could be established and he’d be forever trying to run from this woman even as she had a direct link to his plans.
at her ankles. She moved too quickly, missing the Incarcerous and catching the biting end of the slashing curse at her shoulder. Blood bloomed through her grey jumper and she tossed her wand into her other hand, flying at him with a rapid string of binding curses spat between bitter teeth.
He saw, or maybe he imagined, Draco leaning over the side of the boat, forlorn, heartbroken, sobbing for him, calling him.
Draco was a little bit taller, but their eyes met. Grey in the steely night, Draco's expression was soulful, Harry's desire reflecting back. Harry hesitated too long, farewell words stuck in his throat.
Darkness was bliss; Harry slipped out of his own mind. He was the point of Draco’s fingertips against his cheekbone, his chin, his jaw; he was the brush of magic against the fragile softness by his ear, he was the pull of muscle in his neck when Draco pushed his chin this way and that. Loose, he was easy, he was anything Draco wanted him to be.
says I could do a lot in IMR, thinks I ought to go to uni for it, maybe even get a whole Master's and everything.  I mean, I know it's like a new field and everything, but I really think it's important and I might be able to make a difference, you know? Well, of course you know."
Two small pink flowers bloomed, tiny petals spreading wide. One was a pale pastel shade like a blush on Draco’s cheeks, The other was a deeper red, the way that Harry’s magic seemed to spark.
,” Draco echoed, and squeezed Harry’s hand hard. He let a final memory drifted between them, a new rendezvous point.
He slipped two fingers along Harry’s brow, curving along the corner of his eye. Harry’s shut eyelashes twitched against his touch, but he didn’t look.
The man waved his hand. “Ah, politics. It doesn’t much matter to me, you know, I’m just an old fart. I just keep on coming to work and doing my thing. What’s it to me? I’ve even got a bona fide guaranteed job at the swanky new museum and I won’t even have to deal with a single Muggle again. This radio thing here? I hate using it! I’ll be glad to get rid of it.”
“Never,” cut in Draco quickly, reaching to steal the butt-end of the loaf.  “I’m far too skilled for that. I had him, anyway,” he said around a too-big bite.
He had been to a proper laundrette only twice before and swore to avoid the mildew-scented noise of too many dryers spinning at the same time, but so much for that.  He pushed through the door, wincing at the obnoxious chime of cheery bells, and surveyed the scene.  Draco claimed the first machine; he shoved his damp clothes inside and tried desperately not to turn his nose up at the soap scum.
They landed in a little copse of trees not far from the lake in Hyde Park, laughing harder than they’d done in weeks.
Before Draco or Harry could cut him off or correct him, his radio crackled noisily. He rolled his eyes, sliding it off his belt, and stepped away from them, holding it awkwardly to his ear with an exasperated expression. “Just a few more weeks of this Muggle shite,” he muttered.
She was slime inside his mind, slithering through the blond man’s face, oozing with a stabbing, bitter pain across the little room he gave her as she pushed outward with her Legilimens
The Mirror was as he’d left it the day before. The room was more dimly lit than the bright, pale-painted main gallery. Black curtains hung behind the standing Mirror, and facing it on the wall opposite was a small display of cursed rings. Harry noticed these for the first time as he stepped into the gallery, determined to look around the room rather than directly into the Mirror.
“A lead,” Draco said under his breath, into the coffee mug as he sipped it, keeping the tight blue gaze.
Distantly, Harry remembered his abandoned shot, waiting on the bar counter.  It didn’t seem to matter anymore.  He couldn’t taste his earlier drink, couldn’t smell the sweat and heat of bodies and movement.
The nausea symptoms should have ended with the bond. Have they even bothered trying to stop touching?  Maybe it's easier to pretend their obvious connection is only magic.
He hadn’t expected to see Draco for hours, until he grew tired of whatever research he could complete far from any libraries and took over the second half of the watch.
“We could do it, you know,” Harry said, quietly. He was always quiet these days. It was like realizing his world was not what he expected had shifted something heavy in him, something dark. Draco had watched, watched the weight fall onto his shoulders all over again, or maybe the weight had always been there, but Harry hadn’t realized he’d been carrying it. “We could run.”
And there, of course, was Harry Potter. He had shucked his Auror robes, but not the stance or hyper awareness that came with the job title. Draco nearly dumped his coffee straight down Harry’s grey, soft-looking jumper, but he caught himself, surreptitiously shrinking and tucking away the little zine. He swallowed, eyeing Harry carefully. Harry seemed to be calculating him too.
In the real world, Draco was pressed and professional at all times. He wore collared shirts buttoned up to the neck and shiny dress shoes with perfect, unfrayed shoelaces.
.” The canvas erupted, utterly ruined. Draco snagged Harry’s free hand and cast. The gallery and the arriving guards spun away in the blink of an eye.
Harry will spend the first twenty minutes of their session complaining about how no one wants to forget happy things, so it makes no sense to decorate like this will be anybody’s happy place.
“I can’t rest,” he said, avoiding my touch when I begged him to lie with me instead. “There are too many names and too little time.”
“I’m not bloody well going to forget that,” Weasley spat, too angry, his hand twitching towards his wand. Harry’s eyes slid from Weasley’s face to Draco’s, resolved. Draco reached for him, and Harry stepped towards Weasley, hesitating as he waited for the anger to fade just enough.
“I didn’t know if you’d know it,” he said, whispering a wandless healing charm. It wasn’t strong enough to do much good, but it was enough to staunch the bleeding.
, that was this feeling. “Do we have a new supplier, then?” Draco tried to infuse his voice with some energy, though there was little to be found to spare.
Warmth settled over Harry slowly, then all at once. It was a soothing cascade from the top of his head down to his toes, like being touched gently on every part of his body.
He ran and ran and ran until he tucked himself inside Spike’s little coffee shop and shut the door, hair a mess and breath frantic in his throat. Spike and the man they had been speaking with looked up, taking in Draco’s appearance.
Draco looked down at the watch he wore (pocketed in the busy streets of Brussels a week ago) and saw that Harry was now nearly forty-five minutes past their agreed-upon rendezvous. Anxiety thrilled through him, as it always did when Harry was late. Had he been picked up? Had he been injured? Had he decided to leave Draco and go it alone, or with someone more preferable?
And in bed, that intense, perfection-seeking quality meant that they’d fuck until three in the morning, till Harry was wrung out and too shaky to do anything but roll into Draco’s touch and beg for an orgasm.
But Harry smiled, wide and indulgent, with those bright eyes that seemed to look straight into him. Draco strengthened his Occlumency just a touch, watching Harry, wondering if he would try to read Draco’s mind. “Maybe I’ll be lucky, then,” Harry grinned, “Merlin knows I need it.”
“No,” Draco agreed. He shifted, ever-so-carefully. He still wasn’t sure how much he was allowed to touch, but he sat just so his fingers were a breath away from Harry’s. He shifted and he waited. Harry closed the distance, sliding his palm over the back of Draco’s hand and holding him close.
“I’ll help you,” Draco murmured in his ear, sliding his hand against Harry’s. When had Harry drawn his wand? Draco held him so tightly, so securely. He felt like perfect security, like home, like safety wrapped around him. It was so much easier to fall for him at sea.
There was little more likely to incite a Slytherin to battle than a good bet and a fair chance of winning.  Draco stood up from his knees in one fluid motion and reached for Harry, pulling him up too.  He kissed him once, firmly on the mouth.  “There’s one for me and three on you so far.  Whoever has the fewest weapons on them cooks tonight?”
I watch it happen, blood on my hands, on Harry’s hands, the flicker-flash of the Legilimency burned around the edges with the force of his violent magic.
“As if I’m not worth savouring,” Draco tutted, but when Harry caught his eye, he found an anxious truth under Draco’s sarcasm.
“Come and see,” said a young boy, pulling a man who could only be his father over to the Mirror. “There’s Mom, right there,” he pointed, greasy finger getting too close to the glass for Harry’s liking.
“Are you saying that because you’re not sure if you agree with it?” Draco snapped, and Harry turned to him too.
But Draco lifted the peppermint soap Harry liked best and rubbed it into Harry’s sore shoulders so thoroughly Harry went weak against him. If this is what unspoiled looked like, Harry didn’t mind.
Harry fell asleep with his palm on Draco’s bare chest.  This time, instead of the swell of club noise and lights, he felt only the pulse of Draco’s heartbeat.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Draco frowned, wanting to drag Harry back in by the neck and kiss him again.
, shocking away the crawling feeling on his skin. Already, he felt lighter, buoyed by the saltwater.
“I don’t kiss Aurors,” he shrugged, a bit ruefully. “How was I meant to know that you were just as much a raging anarchist as I am?” Harry laughed again, that beautiful sound, and Draco found himself laughing just a little too. It was like that. When Harry laughed, you couldn’t help but join in and laugh with your whole belly too.
“Good one,” Harry had said, voice cheery and genuine and that was enough. Draco shook himself and sent another flurry of hexes - legal ones, this time - flying, flicking across the one still standing until he was pinned across the stanchion spread-eagle and wandless. Draco tossed both of their wands onto the tracks below, relishing the blast of wind as the train smashed them to pieces.
But there was a young man, not quite twenty, with hair tied up at the back of his head, his eyes set a bit too far apart to be perfect, but even more stunning for it. He had that look about him, like he was waiting for someone and Draco began to move towards him. Could
Each moment Maia erases will sit in the vials in her office till they’re done, just in case there’s a mistake. There won’t be a mistake, though, and when it’s over, Harry can take the vials and do whatever he wants with them.
"I think it's important for my students to read it," Harry added.  Behind Draco, the dryer began to thud insistently as it turned to the end of the cycle. Elena popped her gum once more and finally decided to abandon them.  Draco half-registered her bemused expression as she went off to instruct her classmates on the ways of detergent.
It stood, great claw feet on the ground, as tall as Harry remembered it. The gold-painted wood frame had been restored by a neat hand, all its former chips filled and the gleaming, glittering gilt along the edges seemed vital with new power. Harry looked across the surface. The glass too had been cleaned, silver oxidation spots wiped away so that it looked as fresh as though it had been crafted days before, not millenia.
The boat was so small. Harry was no bigger than a raindrop. The ocean could swallow them up without a ripple, erase the boat itself from the surface of the sea without any effort. Would the Archive even notice if they disappeared? Would they bother sending a second pair of investigators?
But for tonight, he’ll curl up in the too-big bed and press his nose into the pillowcase. The sheets won’t smell like Draco anymore, but if he turns his head just right, he can pretend.
Harry finished his tea. He set the mug down on the coffee table. He looked at Draco, and Draco accepted the wordless answer.
“There is power all around us,” Draco said, “in the grass, in the dirt, in the air, in the trees, in you,” he nodded to Harry. “They’ve said that wands are the best way to channel it, but I’m not so sure.”
The snap of Draco’s fingers broke Harry’s attention. He looked down at the cup in his hands for an excuse.
Malfoy takes the offered pan from you, but sets it aside without looking; Potter's got his full attention.
“We can dry these once they’re off.” There was the sound of wet fabric hitting the floor. Harry didn’t turn around, although the compulsion to do so gnawed at his neck.
“Cup of tea to your right.” Draco stood and stretched. Harry looked away, at the seam in the sheets, at the curl of steam from the metal mug beside him, at the woodgrain. Anywhere but at Draco.
You shove past Sylvan to grab a bucket, barely restraining a hip check on the way as he murmurs something about forbidden caresses and watchful moons.
“Right,” Draco nodded, not really believing it. He pulled the small beaded bag from inside his robes and waved a hand to summon two small and slightly stale loaves of bread. He offered one to Harry, who took it gratefully, and passed along the jam as well. They ate in silence.
was buried under smoke and mirrors, even to those closest to him. When Theo Nott failed to come back from his final mission, Harry and Draco were sent home, as though it were an ordinary day in an ordinary week and their third partner would be there in the morning.
“Right,” Harry said, and Draco ached at how good-natured he was, that heart so willing to hear Weasley’s earnestness. It was the same heart that had opened to Draco and offered him unconditional forgiveness. “Look, Ron, I know you’re not
“Potter!” Draco snapped, and Harry reeled back. Draco was still at the mast, not behind him nor in the water.
A massive painting of Hogwarts burning covered one wall, the stars almost completely blacked out by still-curling smoke. Draco could almost hear screams from the people fighting in the bottom of the painting, too small and too caught among flashing spell-light to distinguish.
“You have your friends,” she’ll try, but they’ll both know it’s futile. “Your Ron, your Molly, and the others.”
She looked terrible, slumped against the register and would certainly be a sight for the Muggles, but it didn’t matter. Draco had to go, had to get to Harry before the information got to another set of Aurors. He Apparated out of the coffee shop with a loud
“I didn’t hear you coming,” Harry murmured, and blinked at his palm spread across Malfoy’s neat grey suit jacket. This wasn’t right. He wasn’t in the Mirror. They were at the Tate, and there were people outside and a whole gallery full of objects and art and they didn’t belong together.
It was like the war years all over again, Harry said, hiding like this. It was different for Draco. He had spent most of the war in plain sight, following along an increasingly dark path because those he trusted claimed there was light ahead. He had to make his own way, now.
The club was fucking hot, and Draco’s shirt was open, which really wasn’t fair, because Harry had to look at his bare chest and the sweat by his navel.  They weren’t serious.  It was only dancing, surrounded by other people, close, but never more than that.
"You'll help me Floo to Dr. Malfoy's tutorial, won't you, Harry?" Her eager voice interrupted his brooding and he looked a bit sheepish in Harry's direction.
, whatever, I can’t. I can’t.” He opened his eyes, but that was worse. Draco was everywhere around him, and Harry was awash in those piercing sea-foam eyes. “I can’t,” he said, but he was failing to convince himself.
If Sylvan had any tact he’d leave them be, but — and you catch the glint in his smile — maybe he’s as onto them as you are.
Harry was too incensed, and he knew it. “How about work? Tell me all about the fabulous research you’ve been conducting. Look at your amazing new tricks. Look at how much you’ve improved.” There was bile in his voice and he couldn’t feel the palms of his hands for how tightly clenched they were around the mug. “I’m so glad you’ve spent this time so well.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry grinned, knowing exactly what those words would do to Draco’s heart.  “Clean as a whip.”  He slid a spare wand out of the bottom of his trousers, tossing it onto the pile with a flash of red sparks, grinning as Draco rolled his eyes.
Once Harry started laughing, he couldn’t stop. He pulled out of Draco gently — so gently — and lay there, sweaty hand on Draco’s side, trying to stifle his light-headed buzz. Draco laughed too, even though he didn’t know what they were laughing at, but Harry’s joy was infectious.
“I brought you tea.” Draco pushed a porcelain mug into Harry’s hands. Dark liquid swirled inside, but the mug was oddly cold.
Draco had balanced his mug on his chest, staring at the sky. His hair, which was usually so neatly coiffed, hung loose and damp, like a sea god strung up out of the water and splashed across the deck.
He had started the morning with a mug of oversteeped tea and a cold shower, since the neighbors had once again used up the last of the hot water.  He tripped over the cat and got himself a great purple bruise on his knee, and caught the sleeve of his nice dress shirt on the drawer pull, tearing a Sickle-sized hole.
The bartender was quick, or maybe time wasn’t moving right.  Draco’s breath was on his throat, and he was talking about the music, but Harry wanted to kiss him so badly it hurt. If Draco didn’t take him home, Harry thought he might just lay on the floor of the club under the dancers’ feet for the rest of the night.
Blindly, he reached for Harry and Apparated away before he could fully take in the carnage. But the image was burned into his eyes. The image was burned into his mind.
In the course of the next six seconds, six things happened in succession. Draco’s magic poured into the palm of his hand wandlessly, curled and ready. An image, three stones on a white sand beach, flashed into his mind, tinted with the scent of roses. The man across the table stood up, scraping his chair over the linoleum floor, slinging his bag over his shoulder. He brushed the back of his hand against Draco’s where it still rested on the table, then turned and walked out the door.
Instead, they sipped their tea and avoided looking at each other. Draco examined the chip in the lip of his mug, though he knew perfectly how it was formed, when one of his Illusions had held the cup and Harry had distracted Draco. Harry stared at the carpet, at the ugly pattern of flowers promenading around the middle in an awful, faded shade of red. A thousand feet had tracked dust and age over the surface of the carpet.
Draco tossed his cigarette to the ground and crushed it underfoot. “Where to?” he asked, only the barest tint of exhaustion in his voice. He was very good at pretending that all was fine, these days.
It should have been obvious, staring (at each other) through the flickers of the dying bonfire. It should have been inevitable, waiting to be alone (with each other) as the sky began to wake. It felt fated (to be each other’s other), side by side, smoke rising, a new day.
Harry grabbed the mirror, wrenching it off the wall. It flashed silver in his hand as he brought it crashing against not-Draco’s shoulder.
It had worked so seamlessly for that first month that they had spent an entire weekend tucked away in a motel lying naked on the bed together. Draco had run his hands over Harry’s face, Harry’s real and genuine face for the first time in three months and it had been incredible. He cried, just a little, running his pointer finger over the scar where it reached Harry’s hairline, over his bare brown collarbone, down over his dusty nipples. Draco had spent nearly an hour transfixed on Harry’s palm, memorizing every whorl and ridge, tracing a fingernail through the creases at his palm until Harry laughed and pulled his hand away claiming that he had grown ticklish.
"I was distracted," Draco insisted. Beside him, the dryer clicked off, and he swung the door open with a little more force than necessary, folding and shoving his pink-tinged clothes into his bag. "As I was this morning too, clearly."
“I’m a good Auror, mate,” Weasley’s voice was getting louder and Draco could picture the red flush that would start right at Harry’s collar.
James’ face was fading, turning pale. His hair grew. It was all wrong. Why didn’t Harry’s spell work?
Naturally, that was also when that awful bell chimed again and the noise of an odd ensemble of new people buzzed into the small space.
“I’m going to keep improving.” Draco finally dismissed his doppelganger, and Harry settled, sinking back into the couch cushions, the stress in his spine fading. He realized too late that the Illusion hadn’t cast a shadow, even as he stood close to the decorative lamp.
“Should I believe it?” Malfoy finally, finally looked up. Harry saw reflected in Malfoy the same question he felt: that parallel desire and uncertainty inextricably interwoven.
Draco and Harry were tucked in the parlor of Grimmauld Place, knees against each other, the flickering fire sending warmth over their skin. Draco was watching Harry, and Harry was watching the fire.
It’ll feel like such a stupid detail to want to erase, but he’ll tell her about it anyway: the way that Draco’s eyes lit up gold by the flickering flames as he taught Harry the constellations. Harry will tell her about messing them up just so Draco could correct him.
He’ll tell her how Draco won the Weasleys over with the Pleiades and his story of the seven siblings in the sky. He’ll tell her how that night changed everything, because suddenly Draco was allowed to stay.
Perhaps if Draco had not seen Harry outside the shop, he might have been more wary when he found him for the fifth time since the war in the little Friends Meetinghouse late on a Thursday night. There were about thirty of them, little folding chairs laid out in the exceedingly democratic circle.
This time, he noticed the little label propped up beside it, black text on bright white. The words swam before his eyes and he ignored it. Harry knew the Mirror far better than any curator spouting history to the waiting masses.
Harry pressed a hand over his face. His finger came away pink with blood, his cheek stinging, his jaw half-shaved.
“Avery, Ron,” a cheerful voice said, and Draco looked beyond the leader to see Harry, standing in jeans, a heavy black cloak draped over his shoulders. “And is that you, Selwyn?” he asked, raising his voice even louder so the names echoed off the bricks.
He looked at her, then, finally, at the clear passion in her eyes even as she slumped over the door, the eagerness in her voice under her affect of disinterest.
Up the stairs, he was surprised at how dark the sky had become. It was only half four in the afternoon but the sky was an angry bruise, wine dark and shifting. Draco was tying down the sail, wind in his hair, the thick scarf bound around his neck. He looked wild like this, like the white cap of a wave, carried in motion and more powerful than Harry knew how to manage.
“The spell takes an incantation, a golden talisman, and three stones marked in the name of Merlin,” Draco reads, scanning over the page quickly. “The incantation is here, it’s— well, it’s complex, but it’s manageable,” and he mutters some translation Harry can’t make out.
Draco shook two tiny packets of sugar into the tea and stirred three times clockwise, waiting for the man’s acknowledgement. He breathed a sigh of relief as the blond man softened, the crease in his forehead easing and a subtle smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
He swam back under the surface, blinking in the bright blue-green haze, and did a lap around the boat as his heart adjusted to the temperature.
A soft tug at his shoulder pulled his attention to a man about his height with deep brown skin and the most striking jaw. He had a buzzcut and a scar across his chin and Draco thought he might just be his favorite face yet.
There was sour shame in Draco’s expression. “Sirens. They’re full of promises and they use the truth to get you. Is that — what I saw in there — what you want? Do you want me to be desperate for you like that?”
The sun was hot and the air was fresh and Draco was high on the mast, thighs holding himself up as he fixed a rain-frayed line. Harry shucked seaweed off the aft deck with a hefty levitation spell, wrinkling his nose at the smell, decayed fish and rotted plants.
Draco turned away. “It doesn’t matter. I was concerned when I stopped hearing your ridiculous splashing about. We have work to do.”
Draco cast a stunner, sending her careening to the very back of the Protego bubble, but it was too late. She smiled, the evil curl of her red lips turning up at the corners. It was too late.
Draco slipped into the kitchenette, pouring two glasses of water.  Harry took the second, and sipped it gratefully.
Harry couldn’t see his face properly, but he could hear the eye-roll in his tone. Had he only seen Draco’s reflection?
Harry just stared at him, and Draco felt rather uncomfortable, like he’d said something wrong. Well, he knew that he had said something wrong, only, he had expected Harry to snap back at him, to banter.
“Malfoy?” he said, without looking up, reaching lower along the rope. It was loose, so loose, slipping through his hands as though there were nothing left attached.
“The ocean,” Draco clarified. “Dive in and swim until there’s no boat or land in sight. Can you imagine how freeing that would feel?”
"Well," Draco started, feeling all together awkward. "It's not much, to be honest, the course is quite small. But, yes, I suppose, if Professor Potter might be willing to help organize transportation."
He was about a metre from a wide brick wall, and if he was fully against it when they started casting at him, Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to escape. The leader of the three, a gold pin glinting off his chest, was broad shouldered and terrifyingly strong. Draco couldn't recognize the other two under their new Ministry-standard masks, but he thought he might see a telltale hint of red hair on the one who was hesitating.
The kiss wasn’t an erasure, nor a memorial. It was a continuation, as raw as they had ever been. Harry kissed like he would throw himself on an AK to protect Draco, and he probably would. Draco kissed like he wanted to make it clear that every inch of his body was real.
Finally, gasping, Harry came up for air. Salt burned in his throat and his eyes, too much. He spat water out, suddenly nauseous from the rocking waves.
There was so much water in his clothes that Harry felt soaked even mostly naked. He left his pants on, still facing the back wall of the boat, waiting for permission to turn back around.
” James whispered, too close. Harry whipped around; the door slammed behind him. “The Librarian will see you now.”
Draco was leaning up against the brick wall of a small alley somewhere in Greece, the screeching sounds of children playing the square nearby making the space feel oddly private, exposed as they were. He wore the face of a handsome young Italian man, all olive skin and brown eyes. He was on his second cigarette, and Harry had still not arrived. Harry was usually better about making rendezvous points these days. Their evasion tactics had improved after over a year running.
“Drink with me?” he asked, begged, leaning into Draco’s space.  He put his hands on either side of Draco, on the edge of the bar, anything to keep them both here a little longer.
“You’ve brought your wand, though,” Draco noted, nodding to the holster on his forearm. “That’s a risk for everyone here.”
And so he’ll talk about July seventh, and the bonfire by the beach. He’ll tell her what it felt like to watch the stars wake up, the fire’s sparks bright orange against the bruise-black sky.
Together, they readied the boat for the storm. Draco was faster and stronger than Harry had expected — tossing heavy lines across the deck for Harry to roll up, moving across the lurching ship like he was on stable ground.
The cold shock of water rolled over his skin and pulled at his clothes, dragging him in all directions. He surfaced a few feet from Draco, who reached for him, spitting water.
“There’s something here,” Draco murmured. He put his glasses on, and Harry knew it was too late to talk him out of it. “I’m missing something. I’ll just read them one more time.”
“Right, but that’s important, see,” Harry had stepped into his wider stance, the one that he did when he was getting ready to practice hand-to-hand to or to go into a duel session. “I’m not an Auror. I don’t want to be associated with them, I don’t—”
“Like this,” Draco breathed, palm over Harry’s hand, guiding the thread through the paper. “Gently, or you’ll tear it.” Harry did so, tugging the thread into a neat knot. Harry spread his hand over the page, inked with the names and history of his family. “Once bound, it’ll write itself.”
“Maybe,” murmured Harry as he slid his hands over a kiss-bruise on Draco’s skin and said with his fingers what he could not yet speak aloud:
That should have been his first clue, since Draco didn’t own anything red, but it wasn’t until he stuck one adventuring hand into the back reaches of the machine and pulled out a tight pair of red pants that it all clicked.
But it was stolen time. And beautiful things never lasted long. It was Harry who had heard them at the door, the soft sound of wizards Apparating in not far from their little motel. It was enough to have them both on edge, throwing on clothes and drinking from their reserve Polyjuice stores. They had been meant to restock while they were in the motel, but hadn’t left the little room, unable to pull their eyes from each other.
“You have your Polyjuice, don’t you?” Harry asked. It was nearly ready, only a few days longer and it would be prime for dosage.
He couldn’t help it. Harry hugged him, slipping across the room and into his arms so forcefully they stumbled and crashed to the floor in a damp heap.
“Please,” Harry begged, under his breath. They sat at the wide Ministry table in full regalia, all pomp and no joy.
"You think we're done," Draco laughed, between a question and a threat. "If this is the last time, I won't let you off easy," he said, definitely a threat. Harry shivered, already fucked-out, kiss bitten, and buzzing with overstimulation.
Harry woke up alone, overheated, and tangled in the sheets. Whatever dreams he’d had left him overstimulated; every brush of wool sweater over his skin was too much, the sheets were cold and hot and restrictive all at once. The air in the cabin was stale.
“—everything,” Draco shouted. The rain was so thick between them, Harry could hardly see Draco through it. “We have everything,” Draco said again, and grabbed Harry’s sleeve. He dragged Harry down the hatch, stumbling into each other as they slipped down the small steps.
Draco knew almost everyone there, and almost everyone knew him. That was the way of things. You got to know each other and you got to care for each other. So Draco wasn’t the only one who noticed Harry, who stood out even more so for the fact that he had spent the better part of the past four years decorating the Ministry’s halls.
“Always the Saviour.”  Draco shoved the excess bread back into Harry’s hands, and started eating, any pretense of polite meal times long gone from their relationship.  He leaned into Harry’s touch, though, pressing his shoulder against Harry’s, willing himself to stay upright and not lean his head against Harry and fall asleep right there.
Draco breathed carefully, taking in every element of her position, her careful, well-trained stance, the curl of her fingers over the hilt of her wand, the almost-feral expression in her eyes.
and a repellent charm around them, glancing at his watch to judge the frugal seconds ticking by when he felt so exposed already. He still refused to meet his companion’s eye, sending a wandless
in a little Muggle coffeeshop in a little Muggle town on the coast of a little bay that no one was supposed to find so quickly. And he could keep his powerful Protego sturdy around him, protecting the three of them from even the knowledge of the fight happening and lose, or he could run and risk them all.
“We can change it from the inside—” Weasley said, right at Harry’s heels. He levelled a bitter glare at Draco as he passed, reaching for Harry’s shoulder. He touched and Harry flinched away and that was that.
“I can hold this too,” I say out loud, half-broken, half-strong. Harry touches my shoulders to free me from the memory. “I’ll hold this for you too.”
Harry blushed too, at the memory of not-Draco’s hands all over his body. “I want— Yes, I want you. All the time.”
“I’m not a spy,” Harry answered, looking down at the paper cup of tea in his hand, the little tea bag label flickering under his fingertips.
Draco scowled at the separation, though he understood immediately when he saw Harry’s gaze.  He unbuttoned his shirt and unstrapped the sharp-edged sheath from its position across his hips.  “Better?” he asked, tossing it aside.  Harry’s hands were on him again, scraping over his bare chest and the hint of the holster at his shoulder.  He brushed familiar fingertips over the scars new and old, staring at Draco with that deep admiration that Harry reserved for him alone.
Draco sent a flurry of hexes, each more bitter and violent than the last, slinging at her, shredding into her already damaged shoulder, leaving her bloody and weak and tied against the cash stand. He threw an Obliviate at her, though it was probably too late.
"Your students are all around us," Draco insisted, glancing behind Harry at a triad of giggling teenagers who most certainly were not doing laundry.
Harry hummed, looking at the painting again. Down in the bottom corner, a wizard, wand in hand and wearing vibrant red robes, paused beside a man leading a small donkey with a proper Muggle bridle. The actual figures were tiny, only a few centimeters in a smear of carefully detailed paint.
Draco always suspected it was fake. Even if the evidence of supernatural activity was incontrovertible, Draco attended each of their research sessions certain he was going to debunk it. When they’d first started working together, Harry found it annoying, like most qualities of Draco’s behavior. Now, he couldn’t imagine a life without it. Draco’s suspicion made his research perfect, his attention to detail unmatched.
managed the wine, it would fulfill the bet,” Draco said, dusting a bit of pollen off of his knees.  He looked toward the village in the distance.
A bit of flirtation made the hours pass more quickly, anyway, and Harry liked the way Draco’s mouth curved at the corner. Like he wasn’t paying attention, even though he was; as though the research was his priority.
Draco nodded.  Harry hoisted himself up onto the rock and Draco skittered backwards, avoiding the rush of water in Harry’s wake.  He shivered, shaking off a spray of drops, and grinned at Draco as he did so.  Draco frowned at him, taking care to show extreme distaste for the wetness soaking through his jumper.
Draco left the cup half-full on the table and stepped out of the tent.  The dew was still fresh, the air still with that morning chill.  He breathed for just one moment, feeling the air on his skin and the sun barely awake in the sky.
“I get it. Separation. There’s work-Malfoy. And then there’s Draco when you’re in my bed.” Harry looked at him intently, even though Draco wouldn’t meet his gaze. “I’m okay with that separation if it means I still get some of you some of the time.”
He glanced at the window across the street. There were no ghosts watching him; the war was nineteen years past. “It’s not real,” he said.
Harry woke in the bunk again, head pounding and heart spinning. There was a sage candle burning beside the bed, and Draco sat against the wall, an awkward tumble of limbs. He had an old paperback in hand and those shining silver reading glasses perched on his nose. He was soft, like this.
Draco didn’t respond. Harry tapped three times. Draco tapped back. Then Draco flicked his wand and sent a great bird soaring around the room. The hawk was handsome and perfectly detailed. Each feather was a careful craft of woven magic, so real and so close Harry could almost hear its heartbeat, could feel the wind moving against his skin like a sure caress. It wasn’t a Patronus, nor an actual hawk, but something in-between: an Illusion, Draco’s specialty.
Harry didn’t catch Draco staring the third time Draco saw him either. It was a massive press event, with representatives from the
“Right,” Harry said, giggling. “I’m giddy with how happy this is.” Harry kissed Draco with his smile, all teeth.
He couldn’t stop. He didn’t want to. It felt inevitable to be in each other’s arms. It was a desire made tangible and he was going to hold onto it as though every heartbeat in his chest depended on their gentle rhythm together.
On the surface, they looked perfectly ordinary.  Two wizards, a little bit unshaven but otherwise ordinary, and yet, just below they were a deadly team, armed and prepared for the most feral vampires.
“You only noticed me because of the bond,” Draco muttered into the pillow, skin still flush and sweaty.
It was there, that tiny detail reflected against the surface of his glasses, that Draco found the subtle truth of this painting. In the left glasses lens, wizards in traditional robes stood proudly, wands in hand and gathered together. In the right lens, among the barest twitches of paint swiped across the canvas, there were shadowy figures of Muggles, guns drawn and advancing.
noticed, but he never said. Draco passed him, nodding at the shopkeep and slipping out the door. He didn’t look back, and he never went back to the little shop on Diagon Alley.
“You take me apart,” Draco murmured against his jaw, breathless and aching already. “You leave me naked,” Draco reached for Harry’s shirt, fiddling with the buttons till it all started to come open.  He pressed his hands under the open edges of the shirt, hesitating at the feeling of a wooden stake strapped across Harry’s chest.  “What, more?”
“It’s getting worse too, I think,” Harry murmured, and Draco wasn’t sure if that was meant for him or for Harry. “I just felt so lost and so afraid,” he said, and Draco got it. He understood. And he knew that Harry might just be worth trusting.
Such blatant rudeness would not be tolerated for anyone but Potter. The one furthest to the left, who Draco had thought might be Weasley, broke from their formation, turning to Potter.
And Theo was the perfect fulcrum. He could listen to their spats and find them a common ground. He could repair the age-old pain between them better than any Healing magic.
And the world was upside down, green-blue and bubbling under the water. Was that Draco’s hand on his wrist? Where was his wand? His feet kicked against something, his hands moved by the will of the water.
Waves crashed everywhere around them, wine-dark in the deep night. Draco draped himself over the boat’s rail, trailing his fingers through the icy water.
“Harry Potter has come to visit the Library.” Was the voice in his head now? It was too close, too much like his son’s voice. He wanted to turn and run, but he had to investigate.
“Let me down,” Harry calls back, praying the wind would carry it down. “He’s going to be alright, we just have to get back now.”
position, but freezing water poured from the spigot. He shivered violently and stumbled out of the shower stall.
Draco loomed over Harry, so Harry stood too, leaning against the mast. He stared over Draco’s shoulder, at the spread of sea as far as he could see in every direction, with only Draco and the mast and the last vestiges of sun interrupting the horizon line.
“We’ve got all the time in the world,” Harry said, when he realized it, fingertip on Draco’s pinky toe. “I thought—” he started, and hesitated. He reached for the blunt and took a long drag, blowing the smoke out in a huff. “I thought I had to savour it.”
It was all wood paneling here, with a thick blueish carpet worn by decades of treading shoes. Potter was still holding that stupid cup of tea, still playing with the tag like it might be his last defense.
“Good thing you know now,” Harry said, and leaned forward to kiss him again. Draco closed his eyes and pushed his fingers into Harry’s hair, relishing the soft curls under his hands.
Instead, you murmur, “Just taking a new set of vitals,” as you conduct the familiar charms. Harry Potter’s pulse is jumpy, too high to be his resting, and he’s got a flush to his cheeks even though he’s not sick.
Bound by the gilt frame, his Mirror-self was laughing, free and joyful. Today, the parallel Harry was sitting in a wide meadow, free of anyone but his companion, a picnic basking open beside them and a glass of champagne in his hand. The sun was warm on his skin and as Harry looked, he felt the warmth burning his other self’s bare shoulders on his own, he could smell the breeze light and airy, taste the champagne on his tongue, sweet and bubbly.
There was a small puddle of water pooling underneath them, soaking into the dusty Grimmauld carpet. “You brought us back here,” murmured Harry.
But it was too late. Draco pulled back and stomped up the steps to the hatch without another word. Harry threw himself back against the wall, legs caught in the quilt and the sheet. Draco was water, endlessly restless and impossible to hold still. Draco would slip through Harry’s hands before Harry realised he was wet.
“Let yourself want, Harry,” it said. It was sugar-sweet, like a toothache, like sunburn the day after a beautiful adventure. “Give in to this.”
A young woman put her hand on his arm, eyes flashing, and he looked away, shoving past a little boy with short curly brown hair. She was tracking him, no wand in sight yet, but she was too close for him to Apparate away safely. He stepped up onto the stone edge of a fountain and walked along it as quickly as he could, speeding up as he heard the sound of her footsteps on the stone behind him.
Harry smiled sadly, and Draco’s eyebrows creased in concern. He almost spoke, but Harry shook his head, looking at the fire. He was rather handsome like this, with the soft orange glow flickering over his features, reflecting off of his glasses and disguising whatever it was in his eyes that Draco could not discern.
.” He cast the spell with an open palm, moving his hand in the same swirling gesture he might have done with his wand. Harry did the same, copying him carefully, and they both looked down at the grass.
There were few holiday traditions that Harry brought to the relationship, and too many from Draco. Somewhere amid the chaos of baking and visits and gifts, Harry locked them in their bedroom and refused to work. They listened to Tchaikovsky for one restful night, and so the new tradition began.
Draco paused as they came to the end of the cemetery, to the short marble wall and the most recent grave.  Narcissa Malfoy’s headstone was simple, more so than almost any other in the cemetery, cut in a gray stone with the symbols of the Black family and the Malfoy family carved in a neat hand.
“I could get used to this.” Harry hadn’t realised how cold the nights on the ship had been until he felt warm like this again.
“The watch was unaccountably boring,” Draco began. Harry brushed past him, walking to the edge of the boat. “Although I do have a new theory, based on the content of the— Harry?”
It was only once he was settled into the lumpy bunk that Harry realised he'd abandoned his own mug on the upper deck.
Harry so rarely had a moment beside Draco in the morning. He was always so fast, too intent to leave and start the day. Yet here, he breathed as slowly as the waves, skin soft and slack. He was beautiful like this; beautiful with all the pressure of work and perfection drained away.
“Potter,” he shouted, through the din, as his cauldron and satchel came whizzing through the air and into his hands. The wizard closest to him drew back as if to send a Stunning spell. “Buttercups.
“Why’s this one upside down?” Harry said, tugging it out and pressing it between his lips. He passed the pack back to Draco and slid his wand into his hand, lighting the cig as though he had done it a thousand times before. Maybe he had. Maybe Harry Potter spent all his free time at this bar. Maybe he picked up men all the time by flirting with them over cigarettes. Draco’s world shifted, and he looked at the ground between them, dirty with recent rainwater and abandoned cigarette butts.
Harry settled his palm against Draco’s lower back as Draco leaned down to set the bouquet before the grave.  Draco tugged a weed out of the grass, tossing it over the wall, and brushed a hand over the top edge of the headstone.
Draco shook salt over the wet skin, leaned in and licked again, like he was sucking a promise into Harry’s skin.
Draco closed his eyes, holding out a palm towards Harry, breathing in the feeling of fresh air and the sound of a little bird in the tree above Harry and the soft sound of Harry’s breath. He let the soft magic course through his arm along the ley lines of his body and coaxed it into the form he wanted. A little flame appeared just above his palm, and grew as he set his mind to it.
Behind Harry, the triad of students seemed to swoon with glee.  Elena was sitting on top of the row of washing machines, one of which was overflowing dangerously with bright white suds. In the back corner, a pair of students still had not yet sorted out their coins, and a third was frantically hitting buttons.
"You know," the girl continued, entirely unphased by his conversational ineptitude. "He assigned your article on the first day of class."
“Do you want to see it?” Draco murmured, all hint of their early banter settled from his voice, a gentleness in its place.
“I just… I got confused. I thought there was something different about this, about being here. I thought I saw you wanting me too, but I was wrong. It was just my own feelings reflected back. You’re Malfoy, and this is work, and we don’t blur those lines.”
Sequoia, fir, and redwood branches lay stacked in the back of the old Corolla.  Draco sipped from a glass coke bottle with his feet on the dash, humming tunelessly to Bruce Springsteen.
There was a door at the end of the hallway. He had to get to the door to see the speaker, to know who was using
But the Draco parts, those will go. He’ll describe every detail of bringing a beer over to Draco, where he sat alone by the fire because the Weasleys hadn’t warmed to him yet. Harry will remember — just for a moment, in the safety of her awful patterned walls — the feeling of Draco’s knuckles against the back of his hand.
The Lumos dimmed, a soft glow around Draco’s table. Harry tossed his glasses onto the small overhead shelf and shut his eyes. He tried to lose himself in the memory of Draco’s cool hand against his cheek. They didn’t fuck at work. They didn’t talk about important things. So what? He could manage.
“Let me finish this too,” Draco murmured, running his thumb over Harry’s half-shaved jaw, his fingernail sharp against Harry’s lower lip.
The sky was perfectly empty, not a single cloud in sight. The water was bright blue, fresh and clean and clear, like he could see down into depths with nothing hidden.
“You’re so good,” Draco murmured, as he pressed Harry’s head back, the tip of his wand curving along the underside of his jaw. “Look at you,” he breathed into Harry’s ear. “You’d do anything for me.”
And yet, when he recounted the story at the pub later that night, he found that he could remember only the Mirror and not a single other object on display. He had spent nearly four hours wandering through the galleries, drifting back towards the tiny room off the main hall with the Mirror inside. As he tried to describe the exhibition to Ginny and Hermione, the words slipped from his mind. Ginny asked him about a set of amulets on display, purported to increase power on offensive hexes, but Harry could not recall even the slightest glimpse at the amber beads.
Though he was most certainly not supposed to be listening, Draco was pressed nearly flush up against the wooden door, anxiety thrilling through him. They were in the small flat in Camden, a share that Ron Weasley kept with Hermione Granger. Draco and Harry were only meant to be in the city for a night, but Harry had insisted on one more chance. The work would continue there, even louder than they could manage on the surface, but the Ministry was cracking down.
They had long since stopped asking by name after a fiasco involving two different faces claiming to be Draco in disguise. There were other ways of knowing. The man eased the pack out of Draco’s hand and began to turn each cigarette upside down until just one remained properly in the pack. He took one of the upside-down smokes and leaned forward, a single eyebrow twitched upwards.
fell from his lips with an all-too-familiar snarl, and the man crumpled to the ground. Draco had faltered, then, unsure if he was more appalled at his magic or at himself. It had felt so natural, sliding from his lips like that. As if that awful word belonged there.
Harry swallowed hard. He’d spent too long himself trying to crack the secret to no avail. The only thing more hidden than Mysteries itself was the mysteries it kept from itself.
“You know well he’s British-born,” Draco rolled his eyes, “as I told you that the first time we stood here looking at this thing.” He gestured with his free hand to the canvas stretched across its gold frame.
It was easy, after that, to let the months fade away. Draco’s hand was so steady, so real under Harry’s. The garden was so simple, a familiar routine. They sat on the bench and Harry kicked off his shoes and tucked his bare, dirt-covered toes under Draco’s neat trousers against the cold iron. The stars were bright, and there was not a single cloud in the sky.
“Can we trust him?” Draco asked, breaking from the memory to catch Harry’s gaze. Harry nodded slowly, carefully. Harry was watching the man at the entry to the alley now too, distracted. The man was pacing back and forth and staring at them, speaking into what looked like a mobile.
Draco and Harry used to move like limbs of the same body, sharing one mind, one goal, one heart. It was a surprise to no one when they fell into bed together afterwards, just an obvious extension of the dynamic they shared in the field and in the labs.
And the room was busy with people, wix from all over the world in attendance. They cooed over the jewels and stared in awe at the artifacts. A tour wandered through, a young witch with brightly-dyed hair gave a cheery explanation of the properties of a true Philosopher’s Stone.
“Really, Draco,” Charlie murmured, “he’s alright. Fleur’s got him in an unplottable flat off Luxembourg Gardens. He’s not in harm’s way.” Draco imagined Harry convalescing beside a massive window looking over the Muggles and wizards alike promenading through the French greenery.
“If the coffee still looks like coffee, there’s not enough cream." The cup in question is sitting on Potter’s side table, horribly pale and still steaming away under a warming charm.
Draco darted a speedy kiss to Harry's cheek and was out the door and past the awful bell in the blink of an eye. Maybe it wasn't such an awful afternoon after all.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged, picking at a loose thread on the hem of his shorts. “Tim would have been a mistake.”
The library is busy with scholars, nose-deep in their reading or caught in conversation, and no one notices Draco’s poorly draped robes, nor Harry’s badly-transfigured leather boots and the glint of the gold Time-Turner under the collar of his robe as he rushes to Draco’s side.
“Were you?” Harry said, and oh, he was in that sort of a mood. Draco took another drag from his cigarette, eyeing the entry to the little alley. The man from before had walked past for a third time and Draco was growing anxious.
Finally, he looked away. Harry caught his breath, unspooling from the hypnotic intensity of those eyes.
When he sat back against the mast, a little dreamy, shivering at the biting cold. He turned his eyes to the stars and the distant, blurry horizon. If he brought two fingers to the cool memory of Draco's lips on his cheek, no one could catch him.
Without their third, Harry and Draco were a line, unstable, unsturdy, waiting to fail, a deficit of magic. Without Draco, Harry was a single dot on a plane, stable but motionless.
"Right," he rolled his eyes. "Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater, Muggle-hater, and supremely dark wizard." He shoved a shirt into the dryer with a little more force than necessary.
Draco grabbed him by the hips and brought him close enough to breathe the same air. His eyes were a shock of spread pupil.
It was after sunset, in the blue hour. The air was cool, though the ground under their feet was still warm with the last vestiges of just-faded sunlight. The sound of bugs and the noise of the emerging night filled the air. They faced the empty bench, shoulder to shoulder, centimeters between them.
“Maybe some rest was a wise choice,” Harry said. “But you're done resting, aren't you? You don’t come by to catch up.”
It was knowing what hovered, both visible and invisible, right under the surface that made all of it so much worse.
“And do you believe it?” Harry wasn’t sure he knew his own answer. Once, years ago, the Mirror had shown Harry his family and a past he’d never known. Was the Mirror lying to him now, or could that future be as natural as the past?
As the morning mist lifted, revealing the broken stones, bloody bodies, ruined lives at the foot of the castle, Harry stood alone, cloaked and watching. It was Draco who surprised him the most. Kneeling over the wounded, unobtrusive, unassuming, he healed with perfect blue magic, searching for no special acknowledgement.
He’s gold in my hands, too precious. I’m certain if I hold him too close, the furnace in my chest will scald him and he’ll melt away, remold into something unknown. When he sleeps in my bed, golden sun across his skin, I swear I’m lying beside magic made man.
It didn’t make any sense, and yet, the Mirror was comfortable. It promised him that the other world didn’t need to make sense, that he was allowed to stand and stare and lose himself in this possibility. And Godric, did he want to lose himself in it.
Harry emerged from another meditative chrysalis, flicking wet wings and perching on Draco’s extended finger. There was freedom found in the ultraviolet otherness: in flight and in this homeward landing.
“Miss me?” Draco said, through a shadow on the wall, inky and tall, with limbs like tree branches backlit by the moon. His voice came from the flickers, moving through the room disembodied, light as air. Harry shut the journal in his lap, placing a possessive hand over the cover. It wouldn't stop Draco, not if he wanted to rifle through it, but the semblance of privacy was enough.
The Minister isn’t going to answer, that much is clear from the set to her jaw. She expects that the saviour will be a good man. He is a good man, but not by her standards.
“Dogwood,” Harry said out loud, looking at Draco in real life, outside the memory. Draco blinked, still seeing the false face in Harry’s memory, and his remembered version of Harry’s face, and finally, there, in the middle of the quiet gallery, Harry’s true face.
Draco snorted under his breath, kicking at a loose rock. If prevailing meant increasing security tenfold, sending out Auror patrols nightly and establishing a curfew during the week, then sure. They had prevailed. The wizarding world was safe from the threat of the Dark Lord once more.
He hesitated on the side of the boat, staring at the ripple and whorl of water against the hull. Though the sun was rising, the air still had that morning chill to it, and the water would be worse.
Another image flashed into his mind, this one from a Legilimens he didn’t recognize: an obvious image on the coast of Portugal, kilometer marker in view, the whole thing cast in saturated color. Draco almost laughed at the audacity - that this Ministry hack thought she could implant a rendezvous spot without Draco realizing.
“A butterfly Animagus?” Harry snorted when Draco first proposed the idea. But the Phoenix’s transformation had never left his heart.
«Même cette prose! C’est en français, » Harry s’est plaint. «Mais... peut-être c’est bon», Harry l’a taquiné, «parle-moi un peu plus».
In the Mirror, Harry and Draco had stopped dancing and were speaking in quiet, inaudible tones. Mirror-Harry reached for Draco’s hand and Draco let him.
“We keep things separate.” All of sleep’s ease was gone from him. “I can’t risk my position for whatever this is.”
“Right,” Harry said, shaking his head. He could still feel the press of Draco’s lips against his cheek from the night before. Warm in the face of the storm’s bitter chill. “I know. We don’t fuck at work.”
Harry grinned.  He slid the shirt off, unbuttoned the strap and tossed the stake to the side.  Draco shivered against him, pressing close for warmth.  Harry held him close, wrapped him up so tight he could barely move his arms and Draco didn’t mind.
“I won’t,” he’ll say again. “I gave him every trace of love I had. I don’t have any left without him.”
“Phantasmancy,” Draco half-murmured, half-thought, linked as they were through Harry’s Legilimens. “The study of illusions.”
Harry slipped into it as easily as diving into deep water. Draco kissed him like breathing, like he was taking every bit of oxygen straight from Harry’s lungs, symbiotic. Harry kissed him back, eyes watering with how badly he wanted this, how much he knew he should stop and ask for certainty.
There was something wrong with the line connected to the anchor. Harry bent over the side of the boat, running his hands along the visible rope. It should be taut, the boat straining against the hard lead anchor far below, but it came up slack in his hands.
If the DMLE had been organized, they might have noted a former Death Eater’s Potions Mastery in “Long-term Polyjuice Usage and Development.”  But no one noticed, not until Harry found him, smelled old magic on his skin, tasted the too-familiar Polyjuice on his tongue, and realized he was kissing Draco.
“I didn’t,” Harry answered, tugging him off towards the alley that Draco had been hiding in. “That’s what took me so long. Think I scared the shit out of the librarian at the London Public, looking like this. Well, not exactly like this.” Harry pressed against the brick wall, running a hand through his hair and looking tired again, the excitement of finding Draco already wearing off. “They found me again as soon as I stepped out of the building with a copy of the code,” he patted his breast pocket, where Draco saw a shrunken book. “Knew it had to be something posh.”
Miraculously, no one disturbed them. Another song began, and it seemed like Malfoy knew this one too or could hear it ringing from the Mirror because they continued to move like one body.
"Goodnight, Harry," Draco said, quietly, reverently. He leaned in and kissed Harry's cheek while Harry stood open-mouthed. Could the ocean really grant Draco such tenderness? And yet, as Draco drifted toward the hatch, a hand lifted in goodnight, Harry could only thank whatever gods were left for the feeling of his lips on Harry's cheek.
Malfoy hesitates as you move to cast the spell to record his blood pressure. In your years on the ward, you’ve seen more Dark Marks than you can count, and even though it doesn’t bother you anymore, you try to make the charms quick for him.
Spruce tips, honey, and water simmered over the stove. Harry ached on the couch, shivered under the worn afghan, flushed with fever. Draco poured out a fragrant mug and brought it to Harry, healing steam curling under his nose.
“Take care,” Harry said, almost wistfully, and pushed past him to Draco’s side, taking his hand and moving towards the door. They left, the door slamming behind them, and broke into a run without needing to say it in words, heading for somewhere to charge the portkey and get out before Weasley or anyone else could set the Ministry on their trail. Draco heard — or maybe he only imagined for Harry’s sake — Weasley’s whispered “good luck,” offered like an olive branch as they clambered down the apartment steps and back to their life in the shadows.
They moved more smoothly, more slowly through the crowd now, the new person close at Draco’s heels. Whoever she was, and whether she could be trusted or not was yet to be seen. But
“I’ll have to keep you grounded.” Draco smiled, like he enjoyed the thought of being Harry’s tether.
“I’m going in the water,” Harry snapped. He was angry for no good reason, that same bite of over-emotion that reminded him too palpably of Riddle in his head. “You can join me, but if you don’t want to see me naked, you should find somewhere else to sit.”
Weasley,” Draco corrected, looking at the sheepish man before him as he tugged his hair into a ponytail.
“You’re early,” called a voice, younger than he expected and frighteningly familiar. It spoke from deep in the building.
“I do,” he answered, thinking it over. “I suppose we could pick out different people anywhere we go.” He pressed his hand to his lips, considering. “We’d need to sort out a way to find each other if we ever were separated.”
“Our new Wand Registry plan is the next phase of restoring order,” he boomed, too gleeful. “And,” he added as if he were offering all watching a gift, “you won’t even have to do a thing. We have your wands on record already, and will commence tracking all spells. This will keep us all safer.” A sick feeling filled Draco’s chest.
against skin. Not to mention the very fact of his being Harry Potter. “You don’t need luck,” Draco said, the last breath of smoke drifting from his mouth as he spoke.
If they had been more prepared, Draco would have understood that the too-bright image of the New York subway stop, the green Astor Place station sign flashing, wasn’t Harry’s suggestion in his mind.
Selfishly, he wanted Draco to stay. They’d been naked together so many times, what difference would one more make? The idea of Draco lounging on the deck while Harry stripped down was enticing — a reminder that Draco still wanted him even when they wouldn’t indulge.
Immortality inspired risk, risk found Harry toeing the line, thrilled with teasing Death. Falling from the Astronomy Tower wasn't frightening with a wand. Even Muggle guns couldn't touch him. Cursing out a hippogriff wasn't enough. But Malfoy, spitfire Malfoy, kissed him like he was breakable, reminded him to be human.
The water’s hot at our hips and even the steam curling off the surface of the water looks pink. There’s too much blood, and though I know it’s not his, the thunderbolt in my throat hurts like it is, like my Harry is hurt. It’s worse because the disguise is fading, and the bruise at his wrist is less stark on his deep brown skin, and his eyes are green again and carry too much for his young shoulders. I want to take it all away from him. Let him rest, let him rest.
The blinding sunlight streamed through the hatch behind the real Draco, tall and imposing, rough edges and as handsome as ever.
“I think the line to the anchor’s snapped,” Harry said blankly, staring past Draco, past the front of the boat.
He leaned forward, and Harry’s breath stuttered. Draco pressed his cheek to Harry’s, slid against him. Harry shook with it, with the feeling of his breath hard in his chest.
“And what I saw in the reflection never changed. I scrubbed away all the water damage, all the age spots and ruin in the glass. I made it
“Did you hear about Shayla?” Harry said the words gently, like he was delivering bad news. Draco shook his head. He had been hiding out in Grimmauld for the better part of the past two weeks. The only news he got was from Harry. “She was attacked, Spike said. They’re not sure what, but she was in rough shape, all kinds of wicked curses. Illegal ones, but,” Harry chewed on his bottom lip. “Word is that the attackers were full-on in Ministry gear.”
The Weasleys’ love will last, as deep as ever, but it won’t be the same. Draco’s not in his future, so he won’t be in his past anymore.
Draco’s chest rose and fell. His breath ghosted across Harry’s cheek. He shifted infinitesimally beneath the heavy quilt, and —
Draco slides the heavy tome into his hands and steps off the ladder so they can spread it out between them, one hand on either side. Harry leans closer, pressing his shoulder against Draco’s and breathing in the feeling.
Draco’s hands stilled somewhere between a cleaning spell and a layer of protection, sparks fading at the tip. He swallowed hard. “That was not mine,” he whispered, the realization of exactly how lost they were settling heavily on his mind. There was something horribly invasive about a false Legilimency link and the idea of someone sliming into his mind to plant a trap.
I feel his swallow under my fingertips, the flannel a bare barrier between my hand and his throat. I think these are the marks of fingernails, and I want to hurt the person that dared leave them on him, though I know she’s already dead.
Draco put one chilly hand over Harry’s. Kept him there. Harry’s hand was an inch from Draco’s chin, a breath away from a caress. His skin was so pale in the moonlight, so cold. What would Harry give to get to warm him up?
He swam up to the ladder, throwing a last look at the empty sea as he pulled himself back on deck. The water was still and quiet, and above, the sun had risen more, turning the sky a peaceful blue. Harry’s wishful thinking had turned a reflection into something more. What a fool he was.
They landed somewhere near Stuttgart, in the spare room of an old pub that Draco had read about, only read about, they had quickly run out of safe places they knew about before they started running. Those in the life shared information as they could, but you could never know if these were perfectly safe, or some sort of set up.
So he returned the next day, determined to rectify his mistake. He wandered through the main galleries, staring intently at the labels in the hopes that some element would stick in his mind. Surely there was more to the Exhibition than the Mirror. And there was: the amulets that Ginny had described were sparkling in person, even beneath glass, and the curling iron gate, forged centuries ago as a door between wizarding and fae worlds was stunning. The sword of Gryffindor and Slytherin’s amulet sat on a shelf under a sign decrying Voldemort’s crimes.
When Harry yawned, the Mirror-Harry yawned, and blinked blearily in precisely the same way. Draco was just as touchy in the kitchen as he was in the meadow the day before. He ran his hands over Mirror-Harry’s hands, tracing his knuckles, over Harry’s scar, so gently and so lovingly that the real Harry felt it and shivered. Harry looked down at his hands and found them mimicking the movement though he had no conscious thought of doing so.
"Right, 'course." Harry smiled at him, that rare and flattering smile that reaches to his eyes and brightens him up head to toe. "Though you didn't seem to mind the colour the other night."
“We’re safe here,” murmured Harry, moving so he was trapped between Draco’s arms. “We’re safe right now.”
Both of their jumpers, abandoned on their way to the bed, lay strewn across the tarp floor. Draco smiled, remembering the way they had distractedly extinguished the fire and stumbled inside the tent, caught up in the easy magnetism of being together and surviving another fight.
The three of them paused, hesitating. Draco reached behind him, putting his palms against the stone for any sense of comfort.
Harry could see it now, the wrong-paleness of his cheeks, the sea-sick gray of his eyes, the pink maw of his mouth, the too-sharp brine of salt in the air.
Harry Summoned a towel from the bag, ruffling his hair with it before tossing it aside.  Draco rolled his eyes, though he certainly didn’t mind the morning look.
But he does, damn him, and he says it back, “Me too,” and smiles for the first time since he landed. The smile doesn’t touch his eyes (
It started there, but it didn’t stop. The sixth time they saw each other by accident, it was a very lucky thing. Draco had been caught putting up fliers with “Anti-Ministry propaganda” written on them, and he was stuck. Three Aurors, clad in the new maroon and black uniforms, sleeker and more terrifying than the traditional robes, were advancing on him. They demanded he give up his wand and would not take any excuse, though Draco did not have it on him.
Draco smiled, just the barest twitch of his lip, and looked at the painting, sliding his fingers into Harry’s grasp. Harry grabbed them, holding him tightly, subtly, so that anyone passing them in the gallery might think they were only standing close together, sharing some conversation, and misunderstand the intimacy of the quiet between them.
Draco looked at him then, full on, turning on his heels to really take in Harry’s face. “You really are new to this, aren’t you? Who brought you here?”
There was special magic around the police. They knew that then, and Draco knew it all too well still. Draco could feel the
“Will you admit your collusion with neo-Death Eaters?” Harry asks. I can feel the rumble in his chest even in the memory. “Will you accept responsibility for the hundreds of Muggle lives already lost under your—” his mouth twists, my mouth twists, “—
Malfoy had changed in the intervening years, at least on the outside. He was not as pale nor as angry as he had once been. His hands were soft and stained with paint and small marks from years of careful work. He dressed as formally as ever, but it suited him. He was decorous now, and handsome, at least to Harry. Harry was curious about what else was different about him, so he opened his eyes and looked.
“It’s not right,” Harry got out, before Draco could make a decision. “None of it. I— I agree with you, or them, or whatever. I’m trying to learn,” he said, “I’m trying.” And if Harry were any less obviously honest, any less of a genuine person, Draco would have doubted him, would have sent him on his way and rushed in to disperse his friends.
“Both,” Harry answered, getting to his feet and moving over to the dugout fire pit, piling up the sticks in a neat pyramid.  The sun was setting in the west and the cool night air was settling in their bones.  The hot adrenaline of a good fight could not last.
“No,” she agreed carefully, forming the word as though it felt foreign in her mouth. Draco looked down at her shoes, a little too small for her, a little too masculine for someone with such lanky limbs and a delicate dress.
.” He ran a hand through his hair (Harry did that when he was nervous, Draco had come to know). “You’ve got a damn impressive glamour charm.”
She was a strong opponent. She dismissed both curses easily. Draco felt a particularly savage twinge of pain bitter in his skull, an ice pick shooting through his temple. He winced, but launched into movement without a second breath.
Though it was true that Hermione’s latest bill had done some good, it was a drop of water in the sea of Ministry power, swept under and ignored. There was little that a single lawyer could do without the strength of precedent under her feet.
Instead of meeting Hermione for drinks as he’d promised, he fell asleep and dreamed of flying astride a thestral with Draco at his back, fingers at his hips. He didn’t mind that Draco wore short-sleeved shirts and laughed with his mouth too open, or that Draco was quick-witted and smarter than Harry. They drifted through the air together, body against body, warm against warm and Harry could swear it was real.
Draco put the last of his shirts into the bag and pulled the final article from the back of the dryer. He shoved Harry's awful red pants into Harry's chest, resolving not to blush any worse than he already was. "I do like," he said, finally, as Harry shoved the pants deep into his pocket, casting a furtive glance at his students. Draco put one hand on his shoulder, softening just a little. "I'll see you tonight, Harry."
There was a close call: the Auror closest to him stepped up and Draco caught his eyes. If the Auror had been a proper Legilimens, everything would have been lost. Draco would have been lost, the power of the mind link connecting and sending the Auror deep into his secrets as the curses flew around them. He was lucky. They had to count their luck because it was so rare.
It’s the subtle changes: my hair longer, my jaw softer, my lips pinker. Harry likes me better like this, but he’ll never admit it, not aloud. Draco sees it. He holds Harry, sweat-slick, heart-pounding, on the club floor, watching me. But I’ll wait. We both know Harry has no resolve.
“I’m going to say something, and you’re not going to stop me,” Harry said. His voice felt too loud in the sea’s wideness.
Harry laughed, a startling, joyful sound, and Draco blinked. The spell was not quite broken, not if the warmth burning like a long-standing candle was anything to show for it, but Harry was pulling back and he was laughing.
“But I want the Draco who loses himself in work and forgets to eat when there’s a good research question, and the Draco who’s an arse in the morning. The Draco who would often rather read a book than let me suck him off. The one who doesn’t let me get away with anything, ever.”
“Anyway,” the man continued, oblivious to their shared look of near-horror, “I was coming to tell you that they’ve put your portrait back on view, right over in Gallery 394, and oh, mate, let me tell you it is more impressive than I remembered! Auror Potter indeed.”
He blinked at his own reflection. There was nothing but the ugly curve of seaweed sinking out of view.
Ron’s sprawled out on the couch and Draco is sitting — as he always does — too neatly, legs crossed, surveying the board like a battlemap. Harry is pacing, since he says he thinks better that way, towering over them and the board.
“I’ll make you a big meal when we get back home,” added Harry, eyes earnest.  “With all the veg you could want, and potatoes and meat fresh from the market in Diagon.”
For a moment, it was just the bugs and a distant frog, and the sound of their unhurried breathing left between them. The heaviness of the lonely months weighed on Harry’s shoulders. Draco touched his hand and it felt a little bit lighter. Harry slid his hand into Draco’s. He rested his head against Draco’s shoulder.
“What was next?” Outside, the rain and waves crashed, but inside was so quiet, his voice too loud. “Put on the kettle?”
“I’ve still got more metal on me than you,” he grumbled, “and you didn’t even properly cook last night.  So you still owe me.”
“You know,” Malfoy says, and you’re starting to understand why nobody else wants to deal with them. “Potter here thought it was a good idea to start reading the spellbooks in my library out loud. Do you know better than to do that?”
And that means you’ve got a new problem, because Malfoy’s glaring at Potter staring at Sylvan, and Sylvan’s got his stupid notebook out and he’s going to start quoting his erotic poetry at them, isn’t he?
Harry tapped the table with two fingers. “Wrong place, then. Since they’re—” He swallowed the word. Was it bad luck to talk about drowning on a ship?
Two days and two nights passed without further sightings. Harry hovered at Draco’s side — at the real Draco’s side — never out of sight. Draco, for all of his irritation, weathered his shadow with little complaint.
That, evidently, was the wrong thing to say. Draco’s handsome, arched feet were on the floor and stomping over to his abandoned clothes faster than Harry could blink. He searched the tangled sheets for his abandoned glasses, found them dangling precariously off the side of the bed, flung aside in that haze of need from only moments ago.
“Outside Three Stones Bar,” Harry shook his head. “You smelled like lemons then too. I could have sworn I knew you, and I was
“Perhaps.” Draco sat up, slipping the mug into his hands. “Let me propose a logical alternative. The first sailor experiences something genuinely upsetting. Probably a hallucination — scurvy can do that. Too much time offshore can unsettle the mind.”
Draco was standing in front of a large painting somewhere on the ground floor of the National Gallery of Art. He was wearing a simple glamour, just enough to make him a few centimetres taller and his hair a bit darker and his nose twisted a bit like it had been broken when he was younger. His mother had always said that the best hiding places were in plain sight. There were mostly Muggles here, glancing at the paintings and moving on, not a care in the world.
“I’ll do it,” Harry had said, high voice carrying something of the old ache. He reached for Draco’s shoulder and they breathed for a second. Another. Harry’s hand, broad and strong, pressed into his shoulder, grounded him. He looked up at Harry, curling against him, listening to his steady heartbeat. Harry held him.
“You were late, love,” he added, just above a whisper, and reached for Harry’s hand, pressing his fingers into his palm, a soft and subtle reminder of their connection. Harry seemed to soften towards him, his shoulder knocking against Draco’s, leaning in and over him. It was a heady feeling.
Draco scoffed before he could stop himself, and flushed, taking a long drag to distract. Harry might be the last person in the world who would need luck to pull on a night like tonight, looking the way he did, all scruffy hair and the first hints of a beard that would feel
Those were the worst years, because he felt the memories most viscerally, but Maia is good at her job and it’s more of a dull ache now. Harry could think about those years if he wanted, but it’ll be more like looking into someone else’s Pensieve than remembering.
It clicked into place as Draco passed over the Polyjuice dissolution potion. She drank it, and the long hair faded to something chin-length, her bony, lanky form filling out until it seemed to suit her properly. “
“Well, I’ve got eight,” said Draco proudly, finally finishing off his trousers and whipping a stake and a bottle of holy water to the ground by the fire.  They clinked against the small mountain of silver knives and Muggle guns and Draco laughed out loud at it.   “So I win.”
“Now they’re all lucky,” he said, and Draco knew this must be Harry. He smiled around his cigarette, leaning forward with it between his lips. The man now known to be Harry leaned forward too, pressing his unlit end against Draco’s until both flared.
Draco was quiet for a little too long, staring at Harry with that intensity he usually reserved for research and difficult cases. Was Harry a problem to solve? If only he could be easy.
— nearer. His hand slipped to cradle Harry’s head, fingertips curling behind his ear, holding him so tenderly Harry wanted to break apart. His hips were a breath away. Could he feel how desperate Harry was from only this?
Draco turned and walked pointedly to the other side of the boat without another word. They didn’t fuck when they were working. They didn’t flirt either, apparently.
“Illusionary sugar isn’t the same as actual sweetener,” Harry complained, though he pressed his fingers around the stained mug all the same, the scent slightly sweeter. “Are you coming or going?”
When he finished, Draco was glaring into the pot of unexciting soup. Harry stepped up beside him and made two mugs of steaming tea with the kettle. The metal cups clinked against the snug countertop; there was hardly enough room by the stove for one person, let alone two.
"Good to know I'm on your mind," Harry teased, leaning over the dryer door and into Draco's space. "I'll bring dinner too, if you like."
“I know you could,” Harry said, and kissed him. Draco tasted like old tea and Harry didn’t want him to leave again. “You’re magic, after all.”
“We have worked to deceive you since the end of the war.” His voice sounded wrong. “Dumbledore’s Army needed a figurehead, and so I lied. Harry Potter is dead.”
“It’s alright, love,” Harry said, a touch of disappointment in his eyes. Harry was disappointed that Draco had turned him down. Draco thought he might treasure that moment to the very last of his days. “I hear you.” He stepped back against the wall so that they were standing side-by-side. He didn’t make to leave, though, puffing on the cigarette like it was a lifeline. Maybe it was. Draco regretted stubbing his out after only half because he didn’t have an excuse to stay any longer without something to smoke.
"I know who you are," a girl with bright blue hair and even brighter red lipstick said, popping her ever-chew gum at him. Draco blinked at her, refusing to be intimidated by an eyebrow slit and lip piercing.
In winter, Harry gets heavier. The cold bites his knees and clouds his head, and no amount of warm baths can steam away the nightmares. I touch him more, tell him I love him more often, and I think it helps. I love him in winter, same as the summer.
Draco wrote a note in the margin, circling a line of text Harry couldn’t read. Harry leaned across the table, straining his eyes, but the words didn’t seem like real words. This close, he could smell Draco’s tea, rich and black, the same scent that always lingered in Draco’s flat.
, not really, but you have to admit, it’s hard to put on the uniform,” Harry was uncharacteristically careful in his word choice, “knowing, well. Knowing.”
Draco took down the tent.  Harry kicked the ashes from their fire out, vanishing a half-burnt log and erasing the evidence of their presence. From the scuffed tip of his combat boots to the shirt worn at the seams and patched against taloned tears to the stubble scratching at his chin, Harry was the picture of danger, a carefully designed weapon.
, do you hear me?” he yelled, staring through the noise and magic flying, seeking out those green eyes. A red light flashed in front of his eyes and he Apparated, pulling out of the building and ripping through the wards and the ruined Fidelius and flying across the country.
On Harry's uncomfortable armchair, a cooling cup of tea in hand, Draco pressed his lips together. It was a too-familiar expression, the one he wore when Harry ranted himself sick about the Ministry, when Theo came back too late from a mission and Harry was worried, when Harry had swore up and down he was going to change things for their trio, that they were going to be the first.
A curse flashed his way. He ducked and it rebounded off the inside of his Protego bubble, dissolving to the right of her shoulder in a flurry of blue sparks. Draco sent two hexes flying in rapid succession, fingers snapping sharply, the wordless, wandless magic flying from him.
Was the Mirror calling to him, or was it merely natural curiousity? The first time Harry visited the Tate Magique after the
“But—” Harry said. He looked at his hands, refracted in the shifting water. “You were in the water.”
“Is it?” Harry asked, tilting his head. He still wouldn’t look straight at Draco. “I didn’t realize. I won’t do that again. Do you—” he seemed to pause, perhaps remembering who he was speaking to. “Er,” he started again, “do you usually leave it at home? How do you get here, if you can’t Apparate?”
He turned back just in time to snag a thick towel from the air. He wrapped it around his shoulders, relishing in the warm softness and ruffled it through his hair.
You’ve got three problems. First: their collective chart claims that the marriage bond was broken three hours ago, but second: neither patient seems to be aware that they are both free to leave. The third problem is named Sylvan, the willowy werewolf on a bad wolfsbane dose from bay six. He wouldn’t be an issue if it he hadn't also taken an interest in the bickering pair in bay three.
Harry said nothing, gazing at the painting with an open expression. His shoulder was just a brush away from Draco’s, near enough to offer some sense of stability but far enough that they weren’t quite touching. That was how things were, these days. Close enough to touch, but not brave enough to do it. Draco was waiting. Harry was waiting. One day at a time.
Draco’s fingers were flying with the speed at which he spat spells, flashing them at the two men in his sightline without planning his curses in advance. Something innate had unlocked in him, then. Something dark that he had put away after that fateful seventh year.
Draco was at the bow of the boat, sandy-haired and shining in the yellow sun as he swept the deck. The days outdoors had left a scatter of pale freckles on his forehead and cheeks and a rosy glow to his skin he swore wasn’t sunburn.
"Maybe you should." The dryer made an odd noise and Draco broke his intense eye contact to glare at it. Cock-blocking thing.
“You’re hurt.” Draco crossed the room in a flash, so quickly Harry couldn’t track his motion. He brushed a hand against Harry’s jaw, gentle enough to hurt. He was cool against Harry’s skin, like he’d been standing in the wind, but his cheeks were pink and sunkissed, as handsome as he’d ever been.
“I can,” Draco breathed heavily, “take the next one.” He put his hand on Harry’s arm, feeling the soft texture of hair there. In every body, he was solid, reliable. In every body he was beautiful. He leaned up, pressing on his toes to request a kiss, and Harry granted one, just the shortest peck, They didn’t have time for pleasantries.
In the hours that Harry spent staring at the Mirror, other people came in. Tourists adorned in Ilvermorny sweatshirts and babbling in brash American accents shouldered their way into the space and blocked his view, but he did not move. The compulsion to stay and watch the rest of their joyful day as the sun began to set and Mirror-Draco began to drift asleep on Harry’s lap was too important.
“Draco,” gasped Harry, breathless from the exertion when a third song began. His lips moved in time with the Mirror-Harry, who paused too, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder.
It was so subtle that two steps back left the lenses looking perfectly clean, not a hint of anything untoward painted inside. The painting was, at its very surface, an image of Harry Potter, cloaked in the Ministry and standing at the apex of their greatness.
Potter’s hand brushes against Malfoy’s knuckles, so quick you almost miss it, but Malfoy snags his wrist and puts two fingers on Potter’s pulse point.
“Yeah,” Harry hummed, brushing a hand over the hair at the back of Draco’s neck.  “Always your saviour.”
Draco and Harry are playing chess together against Ron because it’s the only way that the game is fair, and Ron’s still winning. It’s an antique set that Draco dredged out of an estate sale and cleaned and repaired till it gleams like it was made fresh yesterday, even though the hands that carved each perfect marble piece are centuries buried.
to her as he forced himself to look through her powerful Notice-Me-Not. The soft burble and fizz of coffee brewing drew his gaze to the steamer again. Draco’s teeth clicked together with an audible snap and he set the coffee mug down, eyes flashing to the blond’s.
The room warped around him like it was made of paper, like the stacks were unfolding and rebinding themselves.
No one responded to their noisy appearance, so Draco settled himself bitterly on the broken mattress in the corner. It was a dull gray color, faded and ugly, and the springs creaked unhappily as he sat on it. It was the most welcome rest he thought he’d ever have.
charm echoing from the point of his wand. “We are making great strides for the security of our wizarding nation,” he gestured to the gathered crowds. “Look at how strong we are,” he nodded, and the Auror forces, rookies in the front and lines and lines of recruits new and old behind them all snapped to attention like a sea of red blood, moving in unison. “Look at how we have prevailed in these past three years.”
“Get me another drink,” Draco said, leaning too close to him.  He smelled like tequila and lemon, and Harry wanted to throw himself into his arms, to lay his claim across his skin.
“It wasn’t luck,” Harry murmured, shifting closer, till his hip brushed up against Draco’s.  He pushed a little more than half the loaf and the cheese onto Draco’s lap.
.  Harry could do that.  He started there, lost in the sensation of Draco’s mouth, the spread of his lips, wet and open still.  Did he taste like lemon, salt, or tequila?
“I know,” Harry said. He meant it to come off snappish, but instead, it was a quiet, sad sort of sound. Back to research and watching and waiting for the ghostly
around them, though he could tell that they were chattering back and forth angrily. The taller of the two waved a hand at the Minister in anger.
They both breathed for a moment. The quiet clearing was silent but for the careful sound of their exhales and a gentle breeze. A little bird flitted from one tree branch to another. Draco stepped backwards just enough to put grass between their feet. He pressed his toes into the earth, feeling the cool texture of the grass and the soil, untouched by the sun beneath the shade of trees.
It rolled off his tongue unbidden, too soon, while he was sweaty with the feeling of Draco’s hands on his skin. Draco froze beside him, warm breath against his neck suddenly absent, trailing fingers teasing at his pubic hair suddenly still.
“Oh,” Draco said. Ron Weasley, Auror extraordinaire. The very symbol of that corruption that Draco was against and that Harry was supposed to be against. Draco supposed he shouldn’t have thought Weasley’s brother would be against him, even entrenched as Charlie was in their world.
Harry faltered, then, looking over at Draco with wide eyes and Draco had to hold back a laugh. The man was so clearly stuck in all the Ministry’s brainwashing it seemed almost funny, almost unreal, except for the fact that it was entirely real and right before their eyes.
He woke up when he turned to kiss Draco again and fell off the bed, tumbling to the floor in a heap of bruises and blankets. It was only a dream. It was only a dream, but why did he feel the windburn on his cheeks and in his throat as though he’d been running all night?
), to slip over the curve of his hipbones under the water. His breath is warm against my wet shoulder, I have to pull him into my arms. The tub’s so full, water slips over the sides as we move, but I don’t care.
Draco slid till his back hit the bar, knees falling open.  Harry leaned over him, waving to the bartender.  He slipped between Draco’s legs, and he fit right there, his thighs against Draco’s, his hips too close.
He landed in an impossibly dull suburb somewhere in the middle of Surrey and ducked immediately into an alleyway, shrouding himself as best he could without magic. He was on borrowed time now, he knew it. He’d used his wand to Apparate and they could track that. They surely were tracking him, wand or no, as soon as he had left the security of Grimmauld.
and the noise of the rain on the upper deck. When all was done, and the dishes were put away, and there was nothing left to do, Harry hesitated. What now? They couldn’t keep watch without being soaked through, and with no visibility, it wouldn’t matter anyway.
“More than you.” Draco preened at the touch, shifting just so Harry’s finger could slip down and run up against the knife strapped to his thigh.
“Have you found—” Harry started, and cleared his throat. His voice was pitched too low, too desirous. He tried again. “Why
Draco stepped across the room to settle into the uncomfortable metal seat, eyes on the black mark on the bottom right corner of the bag. A broken pot of ink, not caught in time to remove the stain. Draco remembered that night, the panic as they had run, grabbing bags and food and leaving more behind. They had left so much behind.
“Fix that line,” Draco shouted, sending wandless magic across the deck. The spark lit upon the curved knot of a loose rope. Harry hurried over and tightened it, even though the rope bit at his freezing fingers.
He’ll unspool the memory at wand-tip, letting it sink into the vial, viscous and bittersweet. He’ll press the cork in and that’ll be that. It won’t get rid of the memory, but it’ll feel a little lighter, like unpicking a knit blanket one stitch at a time.
The flat smelled like him, like Draco was made of the same stuff as the floorboards and the paint and the framed landscape on the wall. It was quiet away from the buzz of the club.  Still.  Aglow in the warm orange tint of Lumos bulbs floating in the sconces, Draco was more incandescent than he’d ever been on the dancefloor.
“Harry,” it said again, reaching for him, awful face turning into a horrible caricature of sweetness.
They kissed and it was like breathing again, like if Harry ever stopped kissing Draco, he’d combust right then and there for lack of air. There was much to talk about, but they would not need the Mirror for that. After all, it was better to live than to dwell in dreams; it was better to kiss him in reality than let hope remain reflected.
“He is,” Harry said too quickly, then regretted the impulse at the lightness in Draco’s gaze. “I’ve never said I dislike your magic, or your travels, or any of it.”
They were too close. Draco turned away from the water, back to Harry, and their eyes met and burned. Draco’s eyes were slate and steel, elusive as the unsettled water.
At that, Draco finally met his eye. Harry gripped the mug of tea for balance. It was like old times, those eyes, like too many memories.  Draco was across the worktable deep in the Department of Mysteries, eyes bright as he regaled Harry with his latest Phantasmic research.

“Harry Potter,” she said, echoing out loud, in his mind, his own words, reflected to her, twisted out of him with the talon of her mind magic. “You know where he is,” she said out loud, grinning ear to ear, “you’ll meet him at the three stones.”
“You must have left it on deck before the storm,” Draco sighed, as Harry picked through his bag too. “I’m not responsible for your disorganisation. It’s probably fish food now.”
links us together with a flash like a camera going off. I’m his eyes and itching under his skin, I’m in his mind, and he’s guiding me through too many colors and sounds. I don’t know how he lives like this, in this cacophony; I don’t know how he thinks in this noise. I want to take every burden from him, let him sit in quiet.
There was a little pot of tea between them and two mugs, waiting for it to finish steeping. Spike had sent over a little box of fresh leaves, aromatic and grassy, with his little owl. It was getting worse every day. But there was tea, for now, and the slow bubble of the warming charm as it set the tea to steeping.
Malfoy touched him, just like the Mirror-Draco did, a polite brush of fingers against his forearm. It was too comforting. “I’m the Conservator,” said Malfoy. “I fixed it.”
They were near Calais, the sound of water rushing over the beach and the smell of bitter saltwater stinging his nose. Then Amsterdam, the noise of the city not unlike that rolling whiteness of the waves. A person with long brown hair looked them over, eyeing the way that Draco clung to Harry’s arms, unsure that he could hold himself up.
Harry swallowed it all, the flavor like burning logs and daffodil petals. This would be the last time, he promised again.
When an Unspeakable died, no one knew the cause. There was no funeral, no memorial, no grave to visit.  The occurrence
“Honestly, I don’t know what right you even have telling me how to fix things,” Weasley said. “You haven’t been part of the department in what is it now, three months?”
The block of rubble snapped up into the air half a second before the green light of the killing curse hit it, and Draco stopped breathing. Stopped thinking. He moved mechanically, hand moving without input from his mind or his conscience. Draco cast three curses, to bind, to kill, and to slice, a
Harry put the cup down on the coffee table and folded his hands in his lap. He glared down at the still carpet, willing it to explode into the distracting, calming motion again. It didn’t.
“You’re ridiculous,” he said as Harry sat down on an upturned log, stretching out his legs.  The sun, still barely over the horizon line, hit the line of his shoulders like gold, lighting up the dampness in his hair and the arch of his muscular arms like a great statue in repose.
Sunset offered a fleeting moment to spite the curse and look across the meadow. Draco turned from his hawk form back into human, stealing the single moment of the sun’s hesitation when he could glimpse Harry. The sun sank below the horizon, and the cursed wolf claimed his lover’s body.
“You’ve been in the walls, and hiding in the shadows, and dancing in coloured lights,” Harry complained. “Sending Illusions to deliver messages is not
“Then I’ll ask you the same question that I asked you then,” Harry said. “Are we Nature, taking the world apart? Or are we the ruins, crumbling under the weight of our own,” he paused, looking at the floor. Five years ago, the question hadn’t seemed so dire. It had been philosophical, fun, almost a game to imagine themselves revolutionaries. “Crumbling under the weight of our own people’s self-destruction?”
There’s soap in my hands, in his hair, and it’s the only defense I have against the tidal swell of heartache in my gut. I hate him in his Polyjuiced form. The Minister’s assistant’s shoulders are too thin, his hair too long. Harry’s lips are someone else’s lips, but I kiss him all the same. My hands on his skin are the only balm I’ve got to give, the only salvation I can offer the man who can’t stop saving everyone but himself.
Draco’s eyes grew even wider and he pressed his hand to his mouth, where Harry’s lips had just caressed him so gently, so perfectly.
The two young women Draco had caught chatting at the Ministry event, nearly a year ago, with their biro pens and yellow notebooks were there. Draco had learned that Jill and Shayla were the brains behind the
“I’ve got him,” murmurs Draco, pushing past Harry to sit by his bedside. “I can watch over him for you.”
Broke all my rules and wrote two longer than 50 words - one unapologetically long, and one a drabble. All these have been posted on Tumblr before.
A pair of young witches in grey caps were taking furious notes with biro pens and bright yellow notebooks not far from his vantage. He couldn’t hear them as there was some sort of spell like a
He's got his wand still, at least, barely keeping a hold on it as the boat lurches and he stares into the night sky, and wonders if Merlin ever listens to prayers, because Harry's going to need some saving this time around. He's meant to be looking out for other ships or great waves, or anything that might set them to capsize but all he can see is rain and the black-blue bruise of the sea.
“Convenience.” Draco didn’t look up, scanning one of the copied statements. It was in an old hand, seventeenth century or so. Draco was so much better at the old penmanship than Harry was.
Draco did the same, sliding Harry’s holly wand to rest beside Draco’s, dark wood beside light wood, matched in all things. They didn’t need to speak to know the night wasn’t about sex. They were naked together, no Illusions, no defensive magic, only this.
, that could only mean real harm. Harry was the sort to get a deep and awful curse wound and not tell anyone about it until he was passed out on the floor.
It was meant to be a casual flight, but Harry couldn’t help but see a future in each passing house. There, he imagined lounging in the yard with Draco’s head on his lap. That one had room for kids. That one would need repainting, but they could do it together.
“I was worried,” Draco said quietly, as smoking curled from his lips, blurring his view of Harry. He was enamored with the gentle curve to Harry’s new smile, the little hint of teeth tucked away. It was an expression he was used to seeing on so many faces, but it fit this one neatly.
Draco was already turning away to begin the other charms. Harry walked around the perimeter of the boat. All the windows were shut. The hatch was closed and latched.
Their sitting room was cramped, a couch shoved too close and an awkwardly large coffee table stolen from the Manor filled the space. Yet, they were graceful. Harry’s hand was clasped in Draco’s like it was precious gold. They had done this before; it was obvious in the way they knew each other’s bodies. It felt too intimate to watch and yet Harry could not stop.
” the voice turned sing-song, slipping around the walls, resounding in the floorboards. It was everywhere and nowhere.
“Even that has power in it too,” Draco murmured back, shutting his eyes and Apparating across the clearing. Harry whirled around, mouth agape.
“Right,” Draco said, too quickly, belatedly pulling his hand from its tease beside Harry’s overstimulated cock. “Right. Nice. Loved it too,” he murmured, though his mind was clearly spinning elsewhere.
He turned back to his dryer, shoving his wet clothes inside with a bit more force than was perfectly necessary. Behind him, Harry instructed the students on the purpose and function of a laundry machine, and the merits compared to a magical cleaning. Draco tried very hard to focus on his ruined shirts instead of Harry's confident teaching.
around himself and the woman with the short hair— the Auror —where she stood near the counter. The ward was thick and immediately muffled the sound of the jazz playing, the odd man in the corner’s typing, the sound of the espresso machine whirring. The whole world seemed to narrow to their tiny bubble as she turned, wand sliding into her hand.
