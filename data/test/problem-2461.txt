“Oh, this looks delicious!” Draco exclaims.
. “I have a way we can monitor both Hermione and Ron, we just need to get to Grimmauld Place.”
...” she starts, sounding lost for words. Harry suddenly feels uncomfortable in the face of Hermione’s speechlessness. He didn’t mean to admit so much in front of her.
The line goes dead.
“I felt like the luckiest bloke on the planet,” Harry whispers.
“Oh, fuck,” Blaise moans before pressing his lips to the back of Draco’s neck. “Draco, oh God. Have you always been like this?” Blaise murmurs as he continues to push forward, and when he’s finally seated, his chest flush against Draco’s back, he places small kisses on the back of his neck. “You feel so good.”
Draco laughs, taking Harry’s wandering hand in his. “As I was
, but since when has Draco been keen on spending the night at Harry’s? Or even watching films here? He doesn’t question it, though, as he takes a sip of his wine. Draco is his best mate, and who is Harry to turn down his affections?
You sweet, naughty little thing, of course, of course! Do you, ah...need some help or advice?” Blaise asks.
Surprise blinks across Potter’s face before he nods. “Sure Malfoy…I guess, well, I guess I’ll see you around these parts,” he says carefully.
“Piss off, Harry, you’re ruining the vibe here!”
It’s 5am and still dark outside when Harry notices Draco stirring from sleep. He’s quickly pulling on his jeans when Draco, who had turned to face Harry sometime during the night, freezes mid-stretch when he notices that the other side of the bed is empty. He finally turns tired eyes onto Harry.
bookstore!”
“Shut up, love, I’m feeling
Draco abruptly stops listening, the words floating around him becoming nonsensical. He feels a hazy weight trickle over the top of his head down to the tips of his toes. His mind drifts.
There are several groans after that, but Robards ignores them as he sweeps out the room. Harry instead smiles out at the crowd of Aurors.
“I believe it’s a stuffed toy ferret. With its head sheared off.”
“No. I mean, yeah, but,” Harry pauses, cocking his head back and biting his lower lip as his eyes flit across Draco’s face. There’s a blush staining across his cheeks that Draco has no business finding so endearing. “You make me happy. I know it hasn’t been long, but I just want you to know that you make me happy.”
“Draco, don’t - don’t listen to his rubbish, okay? It’s not - it’s not what you think—” Harry starts.
Harry moans, writhing in the centre of the bed, his arms wrapped tightly around his stomach as he whimpers in pain. “Fuck,” he says through gritted teeth. “I feel like my skin is about to rip to pieces,” he hisses, the tendons in his neck prominent and straining. Draco watches his boyfriend thrash on the bed, fighting the inevitable.
“Jesus fucking Christ, are you kidding?”
“Easy there. If compliments nearly kill you, perhaps I should stick to insults,” he teases. Draco coughs into the crook of his elbow, but manages to spare Potter a roll of his eyes.
“I don’t think your friends liked me very much.”
“Draco bloody Malfoy, how the hell are you, old bean?” He holds out his hand and Draco briefly shakes it, annoyed at even having to stand near the man.

During the funeral planning Hermione had said, “She would have liked to have honoured
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know, but someone elected by the people and
Draco doesn’t respond, but instead smacks the back of Harry’s head.
As he buckles Lily into her car seat, Scorpius and Albus begin to shove one another in the chest as they fight over a toy. He ignores their scuffle to ensure Lils is safely fastened. Mrs Pumpernickel swoops in then, her dated, heavy, musky, woody perfume filling Draco’s nostrils.
It feels like hours have passed until Draco can finally draw in a full breath, his body trembling. He shakes his head one more time, trying to clear his thoughts, his breathing rapid. “I’m okay, I’m okay…caught off guard...”
Draco whips his head towards Pansy. He jabs a trembling finger in her direction.
Draco sneers at seeing the property again after such a long time. Theo is a messy, long-limbed bundle of nerves, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet, teeth grinding as he murmurs out small affirmations, and it pulls Draco from his sour mood.
“It’s going to be okay,” Draco mutters. “Stop fidgeting.”
“Rude. But I hear no lie in that statement,” Draco says coolly, gracefully folding himself into an armchair and pulling a
“I’ve asked you several times to stop calling me your boy. I don’t like it,” Harry says flatly.

He tugs on the collar of his shirt, staring out the large window to take in the rain-slick, picturesque street in Covent Garden. Draco’s found that Potter is surprisingly funny, having kept Draco entertained throughout the rest of Luna’s wild birthday party. Potter was genuinely interested in hearing about Draco’s time in the States, his current research, and how he was settling in at Parkinson House. He hardly left Draco’s side, and made sure to include Draco in conversations sparked up with him by the people around them.
“So I can cuddle you,” Harry suggests.
former model.
Robards clucks his tongue at them before continuing his tread towards the Auror Department. “Right away!” Potter calls out, tucking his head in the crook Draco’s neck to hide his abashed grin. Draco sniggers. “I reckon that’s not anything good,” he says as he lifts his head to quickly peck him on the cheek. “Are you ready for tomorrow?” Draco nods, his good mood spoiling with thoughts of his obligations. After much pestering from Potter, he had finally agreed to a gathering of their friends and had offered to host their catch up at his flat instead of at a Muggle pub, not ready to venture out yet. Potter had seconded the suggestion immediately. “I’ll bring the whisky.”
Finch-Fletchley blinks. “
“Yeah, and I was comforting him, and well, one thing led to another and—”
“Hermione’s been

“You’re right,” he responds, bowing slightly in her direction. “I’ve some material to look over before my day truly begins. I’ll see you in the labs, and the rest of you— good day.” He sweeps out of the kitchen towards the Floo, dodging a wild-haired, pyjama-clad Susan in the hallway.

the material feels like heaven in his hands. His gaze trails over to Malfoy who’s standing in the open space kitchen fixing himself another drink. How in the bleeding fuck Malfoy hasn’t keeled over from alcohol poisoning, he doesn’t know, but just watching him makes Harry’s own stomach roll unpleasantly.
Andrews wipes away the glob on his cheek before striking Draco across the face with the back of his hand. Then, he sidles up beside Draco, pressing his lips close to his ear.
“I never want to see him again, either. I hope I never have to.”
Harry steps in closer. “Yes.”
“Fuck off, Harry! This doesn’t fuckin’ concern you!” Smith shouts.

Love for the other man flares through him
“If we were a normal family, Scorp would still be alive,” James continues, his tone furious and broken all at once. “Al cries every day for his twin, and even though Lily is only two, she knows something is wrong.” James wipes his nose with the sleeve of his jumper. “Dad, I know what people say about Father. I know what he did, I read what you both left out when discussing your pasts in
He hasn’t figured out yet how he’s going to give this to Potter. Or if he should. Whatever Tracey is embroiled in seems potentially dangerous if Potter is at all involved, and Draco has never been of the courageous or adventurous sort. Simply put, Tracey was wrong to trust him with this.
“You’re right. But I
He steps into the room, his gaze transfixed by the miserable look on his best mate’s face, tears still flowing freely. Merlin knows he’s seen people cry before, and never have they looked this sweet. Hermione’s face crumbles in a way that reminds him of a prune, Ron’s face turns a beet red that clashes horribly with his hair, and Ginny always seems to get snot all over her face
“I...I wanted to just drown out my anger. I alienated myself, started turning up at the off-licence for alcohol all the time instead of snacks and slush puppies like I used to. I was stumbling into his shop almost every night, even after a pub visit. One night, Martin intervened, told me he couldn’t go on watching me drink my life away, but I just broke down and begged him to give it to me, told him I was sick and needed it. It was - it was my rock bottom, and the last time I saw him. Until today.”

Draco’s curious to ask Potter what he
Harry takes a moment to glance at the man. They had to be around the same age. He’s quite handsome, Harry thinks. The bloke’s heavy-set, tall and friendly-looking with thick chestnut-coloured hair and icy blue eyes. Harry can’t help but notice how nicely his trousers stretch over his backside as he bends forward, calling attention to the man’s round, firm-looking arse.
Pansy, Blaise, Millie, Theo have always been there for him in some way and somewhere in the recesses of mind he knows they’re loyal, but it hurts to think he’s unable to turn to them about this. He’s not afraid that they’d betray him, despite what Bitty and Blaise may imply. He’s experienced betrayal before, from his parents about their warped supremacy views, the Pureblood community with their thinly-veiled supremacy, from his co-workers and their hatred for him, from his Father's hatred for
“Does it taste like a peach as well?” Potter asks lewdly, voice even as he leans back on his stool to check Draco’s arse out. The grin on his face is wild, reckless, and it does something completely terrible to Draco’s equilibrium.
Bitty tsks. “Aren’t you tired of being alone, Draco? What if I can change that for you?” Bitty asks, her voice low and playful.
the cherry-red ones, it’s my absolute favourite flavour!” Draco sighs, glancing up into Harry’s grinning face. “I can’t remember the name of the drink.”
“Enough!” Harry barks. “Regardless of Malfoy being within the targeted audience, or his bloody past, he is a part of this team now. If you have a problem with it, feel free to find me afterwards to discuss it, though I promise you it will not end the way you’ll want it to,” Harry threatens, his eyes hard.
Bitty places a slow, showy kiss on each of Pansy’s cheeks. Draco covers his incredulity with a soft cough at the thinly-veiled look of disgust Pansy shoots him over Bitty’s shoulder. He knows that Bitty only suffers Pansy’s rude behaviour because she needs a Pureblood woman who has already come out in society to be her mentor to qualify for the upcoming Jewell Ball. She’s also the previous It-Girl, having worn the proverbial crown up until Blaise announced his engagement to Bitty.
He makes his way to Potter’s personal study, which is far smaller than Draco’s. Draco’s study consists of the Black Library and is decorated in black, white, and grey tones. The larger study has a spiralling staircase that extends three storeys with the use of a permanent Extension Charms. He also has a grand piano, an elaborate work table, and multiple armchairs surrounding a well-built fireplace. Potter’s study is so…Potter, as in, completely Gryffindor. Scarlet with glinting gold accents, one armchair with a side table beside it, a modest fireplace which will never be used for Floo, one bookshelf and a thick, oak table pushed up against a wall, a tattered leather swivel chair in front of it. Draco smiles as he takes in Potter sleeping in the battered microfibre armchair in his office, his glasses pushed into his hair, a low light now burning in the scones around the room. There’s a dog-eared book open mid-way resting on Potter’s chest and Draco cocks his head to read the title:
“Prepare yourselves!” Pansy says before dumping the pile of confiscated rubbish that have been erroneously tapped for portkeys, nearly knocking over Draco’s chips and cakes.
Harry giggles, but tries to say in a solemn voice, “Are you going to be safe going home tonight?”
about it! I won’t ever want you in
Because it’s the fucking Season everywhere Draco looks, he sees the young and old, the wealthy and the terribly fit and fashionable. Parasites. All of them. The irony that he’s just another, hotter version of the people in this crowd is not lost on him.
Draco lowers his hand.
,” he hisses to get her attention.
He couldn’t reconcile his own helplessness with the role Harry had adopted in carrying Draco’s burdens. The weight of Draco’s fears appeared across Harry’s face like carvings from a knife, ugly, and etched deep. Isolation has never been a friend of Harry’s, but soon after moving in with Draco, his friends refused to come over, and all they had were each other.
“Hello Harry.”
George laughed. “Well, that’s the most important bit, innit? To expect a bit of chaos and mistakes within your relationship? Sometimes, I question how I got landed with this beaut, but then I remember, it’s because she likes a little bit of chaos, isn’t that right, love?” George asked, wrapping his arms around Angelina’s waist.
“I think that should cover our meal and a very generous tip. If you think I should add more just let me know, but I really do need to be going—”

He was about to lose Harry all over again, and permanently this time.

“Yeah. And congrats again,” he mutters, watching as Dean walks away with his wife, his arm still securely wrapped around her shoulders. When they’ve disappeared into the next room of the shop, Harry stumbles into the table with the karaoke machine. He feels like he’s survived a muggle gunshot to the chest. Draco places a steadying hand on his shoulder.
Barbara stares up at him, an incredulous look blooming across her face. Draco cringes.
“—About my questions,” Draco cuts him off. “I was wondering if there was any news on how he died?”
“You could always nip around the shop to help George,” Ron offers with a wry smile. “You know he’s always in search of someone to test his new creations on.” Harry immediately feels faint, images of him blowing up and floating away like his Aunt Marge or shooting fireworks from his nose coming to mind at the thought of working for George.

“So…would you, er…like to get dinner sometime?
He hadn’t been at the shop when she had picked the dress, having been unable to get away from training– instead her mother, Hermione, Luna, Fleur, Audrey, and Angelina had been there. Seeing it now, Harry is speechless. Her wedding dress is a white ballgown with an empire waist and off the shoulder straps. The cut is simple, but elegant, her shoulders and arms bare, showing off her delicate but sinewy form. She pins a lavish, birdcage veil to the side of her pixie-cut hair, completing the look.
“YOU WHAT?” came a shout from over the phone. “What in the
, Harry thinks bitterly. He knows his anger is misplaced. He buries his nose into Teddy’s hair. Draco’s hand darts out to rest lightly on his knee. He draws in a deep breath, the touch calming his nerves and the sharp pain of loss he feels. His gaze locks with Draco’s and within a few seconds, they’ve decided on what to do next. Draco jerks his head. Harry nods. He gets up and walks away from the sermon, Teddy still cradled against his chest. They both needed a distraction. Harry knows that an ice cream for Teddy and a moment of silence for him is needed. He’ll send a Patronus to Draco when they make it to Diagon Alley.
Saeed took a part of Draco with him when he broke things off.
“You know it starts off like this, don’t you?” he begins as his laughter dies down. They all stand quietly before him. “We started out like this, Dean and I. Grimmauld Place was nothing but blank walls when you first left Gin, and then Dean came along, and we hung his paintings, pictures of us from holidays, and of his family. We looked at swatches,

Draco scrambles out of his seat, rushing towards the file cabinet that holds some of his runic charts from Hogwarts. He pulls out a number of parchments. He knows he has a Muggle chart in here somewhere. He finally pulls free a heavy, square piece of cardboard with the English alphabet on them...Draco’s nifty
“I don’t know, Gin, I just don’t see why I need to start dating again. It’s only been a week since Dean left. Again,” he says, stressing the
“Why aren’t you at the party? You’re missing some rather lovely dance moves from our favourite birthday girl,” Potter says teasingly. Draco once again stares at Potter. Although not as hostile towards one another as they once were, Draco’s hardly spoken to Potter over the last year and a half. Granger mentions him and sometimes he’ll catch Potter in Granger’s office and they’ll all exchange mundane pleasantries, but that was the extent.
The brain-fog dissipates as he pushes the memory down to the recesses of his mind. Draco finally steps into the room and gets on his haunches before her. He places a hand on her shoulder and she flinches.
goes unsaid.
He exited his  car and ambled around the property for a while, wanting to gain a better sense of his new work environment. There’s a 25-mile-long anti-Apparition ward surrounding the property and no Floo Network connection. Everything about the property felt duplicitous. The beautiful large bay windows were covered excessively with sharp, pointy metal bars, stained-glass depicting religious iconography are covered in grime and spiderwebs. The columned archway framing the front entrance had cracks in them and were covered in rotting foliage. Behind the estate was a crematorium where ominous black smoke currently poured from the vents, spilling upward into the grey sky. He should have known then that something was amiss.
“He’s queer?” Ginny asks, excitement once again in her voice. Harry nods. “Well, well, well, Malfoy. Welcome to The Family,” she giggles before ceasing and shooting him a suspicious, narrowed glance. “

silver, Blaise?
Blaise looks as sad as Draco feels. He sucks his teeth and, with a shake of his head, opens his arms. “Come here.” Draco eagerly throws himself into Blaise’s strong embrace. They hold each other—Draco trying to put every ounce of his love and support into it and feeling that same energy poured back into him from Blaise.

He fixes her with a bewildered stare.

Draco would be lying if he said he hasn’t thought about going beyond kissing with Harry, hasn’t fantasised all day about Harry’s hands on his naked skin, his mouth kissing him in his most intimate places. There were entire days where Draco's mind was preoccupied with sexy thoughts about Harry, even when he was trying to convince himself that he hated Harry.
“It looks pretty bad, Draco. Why is it so–”
“Well, technically a foundation doctor. But yes, Potter. I’m fully aware of my profession. Marijuana is quite possibly the safest, most holistic, most relieving agents out there.” Malfoy smirks at him, lighting the tip of the spliff. “Don’t tell me you’ve never smoked weed before, Potter. And take that stick out your arse, will you? We did pure MDMA together.”
“You would know all about
He had told Pansy about the threats and the physical assault from Smith a week after it happened. All the windows in their flat shook at her outrage, something that embarrassed her once Draco had calmed her down. Secretly, her bit of emotional, accidental magic made him incredibly warm on the inside. She wanted Draco to report Smith, to file a petition to get him removed from his Auror post. She even mentioned roping Potter into it, and she hated Potter. She knew Smith and Potter were Auror partners from working in the Ministry, but had no idea Draco was essentially on friendly terms with the Boy Hero. Draco had somehow convinced her that he could handle Smith on his own, even though the thought of confronting the man again made Draco feel like he swallowed cement, the heaviness in his belly unnatural and unnerving.

Smith laughs again, the sound crueler than before and ringing in Draco’s ears. “Don’t flatter yourself, Malfoy. Any common little slut can give me a bloody stiffy. Walking around the way you do, you might as well be a fucking woman. Keep moving, and I’ll punch your teeth out,” Smith whispers, pinning Draco to the wall. Draco’s heartbeat is a loud thumping in his ears. He can slowly feel his thoughts shutting down as he goes pliant, trapped between Smith and the wall, fear so visceral it bleeds into Draco’s head, filling it with what feels like tiny shards of glass. Smith laughs in his face, pleasure in his eyes. “Poor, scared little Malfoy. You’re
Draco smacks it down, his face furious. “You’re being ridiculous!”
Sneaking into the Ministry after hours proves to be incredibly easy. On the night before the Great Harry Potter is to be buried, the Ministry is practically a ghost-town, the usual overnight Aurors nowhere in sight by the Floos in the Atrium. Draco has donned his lab coat and brought along his briefcase to appear as if he’s there for a long night of research. The one security guard he does pass gets on the lift as Draco gets on. The Auror looks exhausted but nods at Draco before shuffling towards the Atrium.
Pansy’s shark-like grin is on her face. “Well, don’t keep us in suspense, do share…”
Lily is dressed in a flowing white dress with balloon sleeves, a crown of white flowers in her red hair. James is dressed in tight tan trousers rolled up to mid-calf, a white button-down with the first few buttons undone, and a brown tweed blazer, his hair wild and glasses slightly askew as he holds a piece of cake to Lily’s lips for her to bite into. He then leans forward to kiss the frosting from a laughing Lily’s lips. The images loops.
Draco lifts his hand to wrap around Harry’s hesitant one, wincing through the pain in his hand as he holds onto Harry. Draco’s head begins to spin, the sounds around him going in and out. He can hear footsteps and shouting for Healers.
Dean holds up both hands as a sign of peace. “Please.
“Ya, yer fouking roight bout at one!” he responds in his most exaggerated Cockney accent. It does the job because the other man freezes immediately, lifting large, surprised grey eyes from the bottle to Harry. Only a moment goes by before Malfoy bursts into great, heaping laughs.
“I’m still bloody here.”
“Healer Malfoy,” comes a low, slow drawl. “A word, please?”
“I just remembered that I have a deadline to meet, you know, publishing studies can be a headache sometimes. I have to go, but please, let me pay for this lovely meal,” he says, pulling his jacket into his lap and grabbing his wallet from his back pocket.
“I’m sorry, do you hear something, Pansy?” he asks, not looking up from the photo.
-----
“Okay.”
He’s staring at Draco as if he’s grown a second head.
The lights of the club darken, the strobe lights receding to decorate the ceiling with low, dotted blue lights, plunging the dancefloor into near darkness as a slow, romantic song begins to play. Draco’s eyes dart around the pub, certain that somewhere in this place is a grinning Blaise sweet-talking a very happy pub owner right now.
“Would it help if I told you Dean’s in London right now?” Hermione asks over the rim of her glass of water. Harry places his fork down and glares at her. His aubergine and chickpea salad isn’t inspiring much enthusiasm in him anyway.
“Can you
Harry smiles in between their kisses. “Are you sure?” he asks.
the table, carefully placing the bright blue folder containing DMLE potion-related files beside his tray. Hermione chatters away about the benefits of integrating with vampires as he sips his tea, staring warily down at the tomato basil soup he’s grabbed. His nose wrinkles as it bubbles and pops ominously. He wasn’t hungry anyway.
Draco had been so adamant about staying single and waiting for “the one” that it felt to Harry as if he’d just agreed to date whomever was flung at him just to prove that he could still pull someone... Oliver Wood isn’t a bad looking bloke, either, Harry thinks rather glumly. He’s quite handsome, burly, and tall. Not to mention, famous, filthy rich and slightly older, though nowhere near the daddy-type he knows Draco prefers.
Draco closes his eyes, swaying in his perched spot on the edge of the bed, his brain catching up to the scene unfurling before him. He can hear the sound of their frantic kissing, their soft moans, the brush of fabric against skin.
“That’s not true!”
“Ah. Mr Malfoy, how lovely for you to have finally joined us,” Robards says, his ruddy face sour.
, is that what I’m hearing?”
friend anymore, Dean.”
Draco is standing off to the side of the dancefloor trying to decide if leaving now without greeting his mother and Dany is worth the possibility of a tersely-worded owl later, when suddenly bangs of Apparition start sounding off around him. He’s temporarily blinded by a dizzying, flashing blur of scarlet and gold before everything becomes still.
Draco nudges him with a knee. “Ugh, just stop talking and see if we can salvage our meal.”
. No. Just this body.
When his orgasm hits him, Draco cries out, both in pleasure and in shock. He trembles, clinging to the edge of the tub as he draws in great, heaping breaths. He smiles.

reported that Parvati had been hexed with boils. The whole incident reminded Harry strongly of Marietta Edgecombe’s brush with Hermione’s wrath. Unlike Marietta though, the jinx Parvati was hit with faded after a few weeks and there were no words spelled out on her face, but not even a glamour could hide the scars during that time.
“I-I can’t believe I gave in,” Harry whispers.
A moment goes by and Potter breaks into tears, his shoulders shaking. “I’m sorry,” Potter says dejectedly, hands wringing at his waist. “I’ve been trying so hard to understand you while not pressuring you and…and I fucked up. Draco. I see how hard you struggle, what you go through every day. I want to help you unburden as much of your pain as possible but sometimes I’m so lost as to

Draco considers her quite the mad scientist. And she would say the same of him.
“She loved it,” Draco says excitedly. “We had so much fun.”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Draco says, his foot now tapping out of nerves.
Harry presses himself against Draco’s other side. Draco watches as Harry’s arms fold behind his head and he closes his eyes, a smile splitting across his sun-kissed face. They sit pressed against each other, not a care about the heat, simply enjoying being next to one another.
Harry presses his forehead against Draco’s and closes his eyes.

I love that you’ve invented an invisibility cloak of strength so your patients can feel strong and that you carry lollipops for them on you.

The problem is that Draco thought the Auror Department would be empty, mourning the loss of their Deputy, but found quite the opposite once they reached Level Two. It was as if the Aurors were mourning and celebrating Potter’s memory by coming into work. A few people stopped to place their hand on his door and close their eyes, as if in prayer. Or worship.

sorry.” And he is. He’s sorry he can’t fix whatever is happening between them. He’s sorry he can’t heal Blaise’s broken heart or convince Pansy she’s worth being promised to forever. He can’t even completely fix himself, but it still hurts to realise he can’t fix the two people he loves more than himself.
“Done and done,” she giggles, quickly swiping the back of her hand across her eyes as she hikes her holdall higher onto her shoulder.
He shook away thoughts of the anticlimactic night he lost his virginity and instead tried to focus on the many faces of the Wizengamot, protestors and finally, Hermione. She was perched beside him with a notebook and ballpoint pen in her lap. She had insisted on coming along with him ‘for support.’”
“Touch me, Harry,” Draco demands in a low, breathy voice. “

He throws the powder into the fire, waits for it to turn emerald green, and sticks his head into the flames to call out for Grimmauld Place.
…I don’t need
They were only nineteen when they eloped. Draco was still so wide-eyed and afraid of everything. Still checking for the monsters lurking under his bed. Who was going to dry Harry’s tears in the middle of the night if Draco could barely stomach to acknowledge his own tearful nightmares? Who was going to take care of Harry, when Draco couldn’t, because their relationship destroyed all semblance of family for Harry? Draco’s parents were in Azkaban. He was doomed to be alone for quite a while, and had made peace with that before Harry came along.
“Shhh…it’s okay, it’s okay,” he says consolingly, but Hermione continues to choke out sobs, her body trembling. “
When they exit the V.I.P. Floo near the long bar of the Leaky, Draco is shocked to find that the place has been converted into something similar to a Muggle nightclub. The entire pub is dark with colourful, flashing lights, the music louder than usual with a fast, pumping beat. Instead of tables and chairs, there are booths located on one side of the room and a massive dance floor that’s already crowded with people.
“N-n-no, I don’t think that’s a good, er, idea,” he stammers. A part of him thinks it’s a brilliant idea, but he’s made a total cock-up of tonight already in his drunken state. He really should quit while he’s ahead.
“Yes,” Draco whispers. “Please.”
“Oh, no one would suspect you of being crazy, Malfoy,” Harry offers. “Only that you’ve been in a bad mood for the last twenty-two years.” He smiles because even Parkinson barks out a laugh.
His thoughts feel muddled, his eyes sore, his body sorer. He hates that his mouth is so dry to the point that opening his lips feels like breaking a seal. Even more irritating is the cough-inducing scent of antiseptic charms mixed with the eye-watering overindulgence of lemon filling his nostrils. Draco knows for sure he’s in St Mungo’s. For the life of him, he doesn’t recall how he got here. All he can remember is Harry’s bloodied knuckles, a barely alive Smith, and his own twisted and bleeding body, cradled in Harry’s embrace.
Mia leans forward, a conspiratorial look on her face. “Your secret’s safe with me, Slytherin’s honour!” she whispers with a wink. Draco nearly drops his glass.
Draco can understand the frantic need to
Harry finds that this heartbreak is different from all the others. With Ginny, Harry had felt unbearable loss. He didn’t know who he was anymore, his future was no longer set in stone, and he was bitter. With Dean, Harry had felt uncontrollable anger. He broke things, ripped paintings, and punched walls.
getting raped?
As Draco approaches the portrait, Walburga quiets immediately as her dark eyes narrow.
,” Mia interrupts with suppressed mirth, tone playfully chastising, “I think you’ve had one too many tonight, darling. You’re starting to scare my customers.”
“We were friends for so long – it took me some time to pull my head out of my arse myself and acknowledge just how much I love you. Just how much I
Draco swallows nervously as he knocks on the door.
You’ve been bottling up your emotions for so long, just the thought of experiencing them at all makes you want to kill yourself.”

will fix it just right up if I do.”
“Yeah, of course. I mean, I’m happy either way just being with you, but Draco, you must know…you’re it for me.”
A series of beeps occurs and the heavy concrete door of the Love Chamber slides open.

rather unfair how gorgeous Malfoy is. He takes a moment to look down at his own beat-up trainers, stained blue jeans, plain red T-shirt and long-sleeved flannel shirt tied around his waist.

“You’re Occluding,” Potter says simply.
Draco wishes he could hug her right now, but he doesn’t want to wrinkle her delicate silk frock.
“Why, yes,” Bart says, beaming. “The most prestigious residency programs are currently scouting him for his clinical rotations for his final two years. He’s fast-tracked the programme, my little genius…” At Malfoy’s scowl, Bart pulls back slightly, obviously aware of Malfoy’s discomfort over his overwhelming display of pride and affection. “And what is it that you do, Mr Potter?”
know Muggle songs by heart,” he drawls sarcastically. Potter pokes him in the ribs.
Draco plucks up the remaining shots and passes one to Pansy.
Draco would grin slowly, lazily, pointy teeth exposed, cupid bow shaped lips wide. Arrogant. Proud. Magical. Gorgeous.
“Look, Harry, I can explain. I can explain everything,” Draco says calmly, lifting his hands, palms facing out in a gesture of peace. “Just give me a chance.”
he thinks frantically. He sobs again, a squeezing pressure building in the centre of his chest.
“Okay,” Draco starts, his hands wrapping around Harry’s arms. “We both have been dealing with some light cognitive dissonance, it appears,” he says wryly. “I forgive you. I know you forgive me. I want us both to spend our lifetimes loving the hell out of one another. I—” Draco’s voice catches, his eyes burning. “I almost
“Do you not think I know that? That I don’t suffer the same? I’m doing my best with him, Molly, but I draw the line when he endangers my children,” Harry snarls, feeling no remorse when Molly shrinks back from him. He jerks away, ready to turn on his heel and Disapparate when Molly speaks up.
"Say Dada."
"He's alright," Draco murmured. "Tired and sore, but he's okay."
That early on?
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that,” Harry says softly, sitting beside him.
"Godric, I missed you."
Harry stared her down. "It doesn't matter."
"So you did," Harry laughed, "might have happened sooner if you could stop baiting him for one bloody evening."
“It’s really nice to meet you,” Draco responds. And for an hour, as they eat and talk, Draco forgets to worry about seeing Harry later.
Hermione gave him a watery smile.
"I didn't think you and Harry ever fought," Dean comments, looking curiously at Draco.
"Me!" Potter exclaims, right as Draco answers, "
"Thank you," Harry whispered, swallowing hard.
"Look. At. Me." Draco hissed furiously. "You're
Harry took the picture and examined it. A younger Nadine's dark red hair hung loosely around her shoulders, a wide grin splitting her face. Her sleeveless white dress was simple, but beautiful, accentuating her slender waist. Her hazel eyes were shining. She looked radiant.
But it was also unnecessary. Harry couldn't, he
“Why not?” Teddy demands, now on the verge of tears. “We could be a

“Are you okay?” Harry asks, his brow creasing in concern.
“What happened today?” Draco asks, unmoved by his dramatics.
"What happened?" He seethed.

“Why don’t I just take him up to his room upstairs?” She smiles at them. “You’re all more than welcome to stay the night.”
They Apparate up to Draco’s bed eventually. Harry stretches out on his back, looking over at him with adoring eyes and reaching out to stroke his fingers over his cheek again, a touch that Draco leans into.
Draco excuses himself from his teammates and takes off running after him, catching him in the Entrance Hall.
Draco shook his head. "It's okay." He conjured a glass of water and passed it over to him. "Are you alright?"
She nodded hesitantly, glancing between him and Harry and biting her lower lip nervously. "Alright. Please be safe, Draco."
"Alright, time for bed, darling," Draco murmured gently.
Harry raised an eyebrow and stared him down.
forcing Draco into that kind of bond. Stuck with a fucking werewolf for the rest of his life? No. He doesn't deserve that.

They make breakfast in the morning, and a disgruntled Teddy is the first one downstairs.
"I can't!"
Draco shot his mother an indignant look. "
loved me, you would."
He tells Harry all about the conversation at lunch, and the Minor-League Quidditch player, David, who had been at St. Mungo’s for a final check up on a healed injury, and who is the reason his heart is beating faster all of the sudden.

She reaches out to set a hand on his shoulder. “Then why are you...or
“I’m a fountain of wisdom,” she deadpans. “You should have come to me sooner.”
"Teddy!" Harry forces a wide smile and walks over to his godson, ignoring Draco's presence entirely. "I didn't know you were here. How was school today?"
“Right,” Draco smiles and touches the full moon. “Beautiful.”
"Oh." Okay. So. No need to spiral, then.
...leaders than you, I'm afraid. The full moon tends to make it worse. Also, your magical abilities with and without a wand are widely known. And feared by many...anyone with half a brain, I imagine," she added with a little smile.
"What?"
"Merlin, Draco. What did you do?" Harry sighed, stretching his arms over his head. "I feel so much better than normal."
you, I don't
"You shouldn't be here," he rasped.
"Draco likes emeralds. In his jewelry."
Ron beat her down the stairs, hands over his ears the entire way. Jenkins bid them goodbye at the door, and they Apparated home from the front step.
"Where is he? Do you know?"
Draco pulled his wand from his sleeve, gave it a wave, and the cauldron poured itself into a line of prepared vials, which immediately corked themselves when they were full.
And Harry, completely unaware of Draco’s thoughts, pours himself a cup of coffee and moans softly around a sip, and Draco wants to throw something at his stupidly handsome, oblivious face.
“I just…I wanted to see you,” he whispers, meeting my eyes again.
“If you want him to fuck you so badly, ask
, am not."
“It’s my dad and Sirius and Remus. You remember they were Animagi? So they could go out with Remus on the full moon,” I remind him.
"My house. I should have just taken you home," Potter shifted uncomfortably, "but this is the first place that came to my mind."
"Draco?"
and Nadine stumbled forward.
"I bonded with Draco last night," Harry explained.
. We do have a lot to talk about now, don’t we?”
“I don’t know. I was lonely, Draco.” Paul gives him a small, sad smile. “And I liked you. I hoped, in vain I know now, that maybe things would change. But it’s okay that they didn’t. I’ll be alright.”
"Overwhelming," Harry sighed, "especially the sharp hearing and sense of smell. But I'm getting used to it. It gets a bit easier each day."
So that's what he meant by..."
"Nominated?" He laughed incredulously, raising a dark brow at her.
Draco scowls. Harry may not see through Teddy's attempt to make him jealous, but Draco isn't quite so naïve.
“Thanks,” Draco murmurs, setting it aside.
the—“ Harry shakes his head, laughing again. He does that a lot during sex. Draco decides he likes it. “Fine, next time I’ll ride you and you can just lie there.”
When a potions order came in from the shop on Diagon Alley, he turned it away in favor of sitting with Harry, despite Harry telling him he should take it, and that felt strangely satisfying. Taking care of someone else didn't exactly come naturally to Draco, but when it came to Harry, he found he quite liked it.
“Alright, share your secrets.”
Harry turned to look at Draco and stood, a wide grin spreading across his face. "Hi!"
is how Harry Potter found him. Because of-fucking-course it was Harry Potter who had to find him.
distraction?" Harry grins.
They waved as they left, and then Harry and Draco were alone with Healer Gordon again. She picked up the walking cane and raised her eyebrows.
Lorcan turned and walked over to the solid wood table, sitting down heavily and glaring pointedly at Harry. "I've been leading this pack for a long time, Potter. What makes you think you're ready, that you're even

men I've ever met," Hermione fumes. "Fix this, Draco. Or you'll be facing the end of my wand the next time I see you."
A high pitched voice shrieked, and they both turned toward the source of the noise. There was a loud, wet, crashing sound and something splashed over the floor.
Until I feel a soft, wet kiss on the inside of my thigh, and a twinge of arousal goes straight to my cock. He trails kisses over the phoenix’s tail, around my arse cheek and up my lower back and I’m
“Why don’t we just plan on you for dinner here next Friday?” Draco cuts in.
"Wouldn't miss it for the world," Harry smiled and lifted a hand to wave goodbye as they left.
The Healer's face had gone very white. "Wh—why is he dead? Is this some kind of...

Draco pulled him up and kissed him. "Of course I will, you sentimental git."

It's one of the few memories I have from my life that I would classify as a perfect moment.
“Right,” Oliver says, sounding annoyed. He touches Harry’s elbow and presses a kiss to his cheek. “I’m going to go find George, see if he’ll tell me what’s new at WWW.”
"And I never had Andromeda's bravery. At least, not until I was faced with the choice between getting to you and saving Harry Potter, our only chance at freedom and safety, or supporting Lord Voldemort, a man I knew by then was nothing but a cruel dictator."
“Yeah, Hermione adjusted them for me each year. The prescription, too. In fact, I should probably ask her to look at them again.”
Harry smiled and kissed him one more time. "I'll do my best, love."
"You're back," he murmured, rolling over to look up at Draco.
Harry nodded and inclined his head toward the doorway. "He's just outside. He wants to meet you."
the villain—"
"Who is it, Gracie?" A deep voice asked. A man stepped through a nearby doorway. He too had long, dark grey hair, with streaks of white at the temples, all of it pulled back into a messy ponytail. His skin was tanned and weathered, but the wrinkles at the corners of his bright blue eyes gave him a friendly appearance. Like the woman, his clothes were faded and worn, but clean and well-kept.
"What would you like to hear?"
Teddy grins. “I’m just glad you finally did and you’re happy together now.”
He walked into the house and found his wolf pack gathered in the sitting room.
Harry's blush deepened. "Er...yeah. I mean, if you want it to be, I would like for...yeah."
"Of course not, Master Draco! Is you being hungry?"
"You're entirely too cheeky for your own good, you know that?" Harry pressed a kiss to his cheek, laughing softly.
She practically cackled. "You didn't tell him? Oh,
He reached out with his newfound ability to read the other wolves emotions and sought out Nadine. The emotions coming from her were melancholy; sadness, grief, regret. No wonder she'd been holed up in her room.
someone—"
"I hate the facts."
"Would you mind getting some breakfast for Harry?"
Harry looks over at Hermione, who smiles and nods.
"Perfect," Lewis answered for all of them, ushering Marie toward the door. "Now, let's get you home and get started on your homework, your mum is very busy at work right now."
"Are you okay, though?" Potter asked, shaking his head as if to clear it.
“Teddy. I mean, we talked about it once, but it was a long time ago. We just...we can’t risk it, upending his whole life. He's the most important thing."
more comfortable.
Harry shook his head slightly, his throat feeling tight. "It was about us moving in together. Even though we've been dating for two years now. She's calling for a media-observed health check at St. Mungo's. For me. To prove that you're not... Drugging me. Or something."
Harry grinned and took the parchment from Thomas to examine his writing practice. "Nice work, Tommy! I'd love to come for a walk." He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "Can Draco come with us?"
"For what?"
“Do you, er, do you want me to tell Teddy?”
Draco nodded mutely, staring at the ground. He didn't like the sound of that. But Harry was

distraction."
"Mother, stop. I'm perfectly fine."
“I know,” Draco whispers back. “Losing you that day would have killed me. I’m glad I created that potion, that it helps save lives, but especially yours.”
Draco raises a disdainful brow at him. “I’m fine, Potter. It was just a kiss.”
Draco had rolled onto his back, his arm thrown over his head on the pillow. Golden afternoon sunlight filtering through the curtains gave him an ethereal glow. He was still breathing deeply, his face relaxed in sleep. He looked beautiful, and Harry felt his heart flutter a bit just watching him.

He was funny, and clever. He easily kept up with Draco's wit and incisive tongue when they bantered, which was any time they were together.
"Harry?"
Lorcan turned toward Harry. "That's plausible. But no matter. We'll set things right, won't we, Potter?"
He looked away, unable to meet her gaze once again. "He won't."
"Watch me," Draco hissed, "you're clearly not competent enough to help him, so I'm going to find someone who can."
"How could I forget?" Draco deadpanned.
"Play something for me?"
“I know,” he answers, looking at me with nothing but trust in his eyes.
He’s trying hard not to focus on how good it feels—Harry’s hands warm even through his dress robes, his smile even warmer.

He was dressed in soft sweatpants and a t-shirt, which was strange, because he knew he'd never have been able to manage that on his own. Or even climb into his bed, for that matter.

Harry nodded. "It's not ideal, but yes. Absolutely."
plans
Hermione thought cynically. She shook her head to chase the thought away. The spells were unlikely to hurt him, and one of them might work. Harry's life was on the line. She could do this.
Harry groaned in pain.
"So that's why, when you were..."
Draco reached out and took his hand. "That's

He shrugged. "It's not a big deal. We can figure it out before next month—whether I take a cell with you lot, or provide enough Wolfsbane for everyone. Was that why one person had to be nominated to talk to me? You're all afraid of me? Of what I'd do if I lost my temper?"
Harry shook his head. "Not yet, sorry. Should pass in a minute. Thanks for catching me. Again."
Draco blushed, smiling into Harry's dark hair. "Yeah? And just
Draco was watching him closely from where he stood beside the fireplace, eyes hooded.
"I don't hear anything."
“Wow,” Draco murmurs as Harry keeps talking excitedly.
It works, and Harry lets out a shaky laugh. “So we say yes?”
Lottie beams at him. “I wasn’t sure if you’d want to, I didn’t want to presume…”
"That doesn't mean it isn't true, darling. So his...
•••••
"How could you tell him, 'Mione?" Harry's whisper was laced with anguish. "You promised."
She took off running, and Harry dragged himself to his feet, wincing. He had bruises all over his body, and his left wrist was definitely broken. A wandless Summons called his wand to his hand. The books flew back into his bag as he grabbed it, and he Apparated clumsily home.
It takes Harry a long moment to answer, and Draco wonders if he’s already fallen asleep, until—
Unaware of what would follow, Harry had agreed to arrange the meeting.
"That's what I said!" Ron crows.
“I’m not fine.”
"Okay, well I just wanted to say 'hello,'" Draco sighs. "I'm going to go back to work now."
Ron joined her in the entrance. "Hey Malfoy, how's Harry? Is he okay?"
They set up a steady rhythm, and several exquisite minutes later they were both coming, first Draco with his hand rapidly fisting his cock, shooting long white streams over Harry's chest and into his hair, and then Harry, his hands on Draco's thighs, with a deep thrust inside him and another loud moan that made Draco briefly wonder if the neighbors would complain.
All of Bitty’s little glances, the crazy behaviour, the gaslighting, the subtle flirtation. It’s been luring Draco up to this very moment. They apologised to him and it had felt so real—Blaise called Draco his brother, his family, and it all makes Draco feel sick. Maybe in their own twisted way they meant what they said, but thinking about it now sounds absurd to Draco’s muddy brain.
Draco closed the faucet and examined his fingers. “I’m getting stupid without you here, Harry.” Draco turned his back from the sink and leaned his hips on the wooden drawers. He rubbed his fingers finally felling the pain prick his skin, then he laughed. “How grand would it be to be scolded by you instead of this suffering alone.” He pushed himself away from the counter and prepared another set of bread to toast.
I sat back on the chair and smiled. “I am still here.”
“You just burned your toast.” I mentioned as I stared at Draco sitting across from me, eyes focused on the parchment before him. He was too engrossed with whatever was written on it that he had forgotten he was toasting bread.
I remembered how I used to hug him until his anger died down, how fragile he felt around my arms as he ranted about work. I would only listen despite the fact that I know what he’s been through on that day. Of course I can… I was his partner before my demise.
The papercrane then flew towards Harry’s lips and before Harry could react, the paper crane pecked his lips lightly— as though planting a soft kiss on him—and then the crane transformed into a snitch. Harry blinked. The paper snitch’s wings flapped up and down and it began zigzagging before him, mimicking the movements of the real thing.
If only I could touch him. If only he could hear me. If only… Draco could see me.
Draco snickered.
Draco dropped the bread and it fell on the counter. He opened the faucet and placed his fingers underneath the cooling water. Gritting his teeth from his idiocracy, he waited for ten minutes to cool down his burnt fingers. The fire alarm had already stopped blaring too.
Harry’s hand reached forward but the paper snitch moved to the side. Harry narrowed his eyes and reached for it again but it kept avoiding his hand. Harry then suddenly felt challenged and with a brief movement of his hand, successfully snatched the snitch and it first struggled on his grip, wings batting furiously inside his hand.  Then it stopped. Harry opened his hand and the paper snitch has now turned into a neatly folded paper.
Draco was just smirking, bemused with what he had done.
There were gasps heard. Ron looked aghast and Hermione was shaking her head. Pansy looked at Draco with an exasperated look, hitting his friend at his back with her notebook .
Draco looked away and sat on a stool, his gaze looking up to the dark ceiling. “I miss you, Harry.”
“What happened to using magic with all things mundane?” I shook my head.
Draco turned his attention back to Harry, who was now smiling. It’s working!
And as usual, I would walk myself closer to him, wrap my arms around him even thought his flesh would pass mine. But I dearly wanted him to feel safe, hoping I could give him little warmth. But each time I would hold him close, he would slip away from me. Like water slipping from my fingers. “I am here, Draco.” I whispered to nothing.
I stared at him from the far corner of the room, just beside the dead Dattiny plant that he once used to water everyday. He kept on pacing the room, his footsteps heavy on the wooden floors.
And then I would watch him go to bed, not bothered to shower or change clothes and cry himself dreamless.
Then I stood beside him, observing the burn and deducing to myself that it would not blister or be in a lot of pain. Looking at Draco’s distorted expression, I smiled. If I was still alive, I would have scolded Draco for being careless and Draco would whine and complain that it was all my fault just to ease himself from being labeled stupid.
The game was a disaster.
said.
I looked back to Draco, my heart in pieces when Draco began to cry again. I lost count how many times he had been crying, calling out to me and pleading for me to come back.
Harry turned back to the folded paper and opened it. Ron watched but then something hits him on the head. Draco had thrown a hex at him. Ron then looked away from the paper, mumbling cursed words at Draco as he scribbled back to his notebook.
But then Draco’s expression turned grim. Harry looked in front of him and there standing in front of him was Slughorn, now more aware of what was happening behind his back. He gingerly snatched the paper from Harry’s hand and read it. He eyed Harry with a raised brow full of curiousity and then turned to Draco, who avoided eye contact. “Minus ten points for both Griffindor and Slytherin.”
It broke my heart.
Yesterday, Ron and Hermione did their best to cheer up their best friend but to no avail. By the end of that day, they reluctantly asked for Draco’s help. Draco was more enthusiastic to help and this worried Hermione much to the disapproval of Ron.
Draco stared at himself on
Slughorn cleared his throat and began writing back on the board. Ron turned to Draco and glared daggers at him, Draco looked unbothered, waving the ginger off.
“Not again, not again.” Draco muttered to himself, his voice strained. He stopped pacing and fell on the floor with a thud. He hunched his back and his trembling hands found his sweat soaked face. I heard him sniffed, his lips now trembling too. “Shit!” He cursed under heavy breaths.
Harry smirked and then turned to look at Malfoy. “Git!” He looked happy now and Draco felt satisfied with his mischievous yet brilliant plan.
“Be careful next time, love.” I moved closer and placed my hand underneath Draco’s. I watched as the water slipped from Draco’s hand and to mine. How I wish I could soothe his hand without using charm and just caress those calloused fingers, kissing them softly until they were fine.
Harry closed his eyes, barring his teeth to avoid bursting out from anger now. Draco looked away from everyone’s gazes, tapping an impatient finger on wood.
“What is it doing?” Ron whispered and Harry just stared.
Harry was startled at first. But upon closer inspection of the Origami Crane, he realized where it came from and who gave him that. He remembered third year. Turning to look behind him, he looked straight to Draco, who only smiled at him. Harry ignored him and went back to his moping. Ron turned to look at Draco, amused now on what brilliant plan Malfoy’s cooking in his head. Ron hated seeking help from his arch-nemesis and eventhough he had observed Harry getting comfortable with Malfoy since the beginning of the year, still he feels a bit akward seeing them hang out. It felt like the end of times. Even Hermione would have agreed. But Harry’s their best friend, so they needed to accept that no matter how ackward it may be, Draco might be of great help.
“I just, I don’t know, I feel strange being here,” Potter says slowly, unsurely.
fucking elf.
“You need to recuse yourself from the investigation right
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose at Pansy’s high-pitched scream.
“Divorce!” Hermione battle cries, nipping at Ron’s ear. “Honestly, Ron! It took me three tries to get it right; I want Molly to be the one to taste it properly.”
“Blaise, I don’t—”
Harry seems to accept this and he takes the last few steps to the front of Draco’s desk.
Because a small part of Draco liked it. He liked the attention from Potter. He’s burning up on the inside from it, but he
Ron or Hermione. He feels guilty that they’re being overly cautious with him.
Draco’s brow furrows. “I’m not quite sure. I suppose it would be, considering the fact that you’re, well, dead. You technically have no brain activity occurring, no other organ functions, nothing at all. In order to smell, the aroma sets off a signal made by the receptors that travels along the olfactory nerve to what’s called an olfactory bulb, which sits underneath the front of your brain.”
His jaw clenches when he notices the glimmer indeed reveals a charm that’s hiding three well-read scrolls. He eyes Potter. Seeing the other man’s head is tilted back, mouth slightly open, with a bit of drool crusting at the corner of his lips, Draco decides to quickly read the scrolls, too anxious to know why Potter would go to the trouble of hiding them.
-----
Draco turns the small snuff bullet over in his hands. There’s a bubbling fear in the pit of his stomach that’s now making itself known. He knows what it feels like to enjoy something dangerous too much. Merlin knows that the desire to be a powerful and successful Death Eater was irresistible to him long before he took the Mark. He was scared as all hell, but he craved proving himself, craved having Lucius’s approval and protecting his Mother. This cocaine makes him feel powerful, and it’s a slippery slope towards absolute chaos and fuckery.
“I don’t know, how about you shove that invitation up your arse?”
A sharp pain shoots through Draco at Harry’s words—a line right down the middle of his heart. What Harry wants to unlock are some of the darkest, cruellest parts of Draco, and Draco would rather die than be exposed like that. He releases a breath and sags against Harry, his thoughts a messy jumble as the other man caresses his cheek.
Harry abruptly stands, knocking over his glass of champagne, the contents spilling across his knee. He doesn’t even care, the desire to get away from Dean is too strong. How dare him.
“Great! I’ll start the toast,” responds Romilda.
“Draco!” Pansy exclaims, pivoting towards him. “It slipped my mind, my reason for coming over here. I’m to bring you to Narcissa. Right away.” She then glances back at Bitty. “Do send me an owl about it, darling; I’m sure I can find some time in my schedule to respond to your questions.”
But all Draco wants to do now is protect the people he loves and show his strength—isn’t that why he agreed to come back to Britain? To sit beside Blaise at a table full of people who hate Draco? Now, standing on the cobbled pavement surrounded by jovial, drunk chatter and the thick scent of cigarette smoke, Draco uses his wand to dry his jumper and remove the lingering scent of beer. With a nasal exhale, he turns towards the nearest picnic bench. He zeroes in on a young, friendly-looking witch dressed in a pink cloak with an even pinker lipstick who so happens to be smoking a Marlboro light. He hasn’t smoked since moving back to Britain despite having a hidden emergency pack, wanting to see if he can quit. After a shit night like this one, Draco thinks he deserves a smoke. The young witch smiles at something her friend says, her eyes lighting up. She reminds Draco of Pansy, sort of. Draco thinks he can take a chance by asking her and approaches.
Draco reels back as he eyes Potter warily, unsure of what to say. He hasn’t seen Potter since the trials. Potter’s testimony may have saved Draco and his parents from Azkaban but that was the extent of their interactions. There was nothing Potter had to make right with Draco. And Draco doesn’t want anything that Potter feels some absurd obligation to provide.
to the chest. She promised herself afterwards that she’d strive to be a better person. To her that meant leaving her parents, her inheritance, and everything she knew to be comfortable behind. According to her parents, she ran away to live a perverted, hedonistic life with Daphne Greengrass; Draco thought that wasn’t too far from the truth. After settling in the house, she opened her doors to Millicent and Luna, Padma and Susan, Tracey and Romilda, and finally Draco, the only male in a house full of bizarre, albeit strong women. All of them are trying to navigate the harsh, painful realities of survivor’s guilt and the existential dread borne by that survival.
Harry does a double take when he sees Pansy, he’s never seen her dressed so casually. She’s donned a pair of skin tight black leggings and an oversized ochre-coloured funnel neck jumper, her narrow feet bare. She’s making her way through a box of books and vases, swinging her shapely hips to Ladytron’s
, Harry,” Ginny starts.
Doing three snorts in quick succession, his hands tremble so much that he nearly drops the damned thing. When he feels a bit more grounded, he lets himself out of Blaise and Bitty’s flat.
from someone like you, Malfoy?” Smith asks, now pressing his weight against Draco.
“Won’t the house-elves be at the larger estate?” Theo whispers.
“It’ll be self-defence! They’ll understand why I have to do this, you’re a monster, a fucking werewolf! You’re trying to kill me, over a fucking Death Eater. I’ll be forgiven!” Smith rambles on, his hand shaking.
who I am. So, don’t feel sorry for me, Potter, and certainly don’t look at me and think something’s broken and needs fixing.”
“Are you sure it’s safe?” Daphne asks, running a hand through her short blonde locks as she eyes the spliffs passing around the room.
Potter steps back, opening the door wide. “Then welcome to the beginning of the end, Malfoy."
Draco nods. “You’re right...I’m just...worried. I don’t want her to be disappointed in me.”
Only a minute passes before Mr Graham is gagging, tar-like liquid spilling over his lips and down the sides of his face to pool onto the floor. Milton jumps back as Mr Graham begins to gasp and choke.
“Right,” Draco says, clambering to his feet. He searches the ground for his clothes, quickly throwing them on as Harry quietly watches him from the floor. When he finally laces up his shoes, his gaze catches on his briefcase. “I’m really sorry. I’ll just go.”
“How are you able to have a laugh right now? After everything we’ve all been through, are you seriously going to fucking crack a joke right now?” Harry snarls, stepping forward from his spot in the corner.
Potter closes his eyes, face contorting with pain as if Draco’s words are like weapons that can pierce the flesh. “I didn’t want to tell you because I was…ashamed. I had been drinking and I couldn’t fight him off, I should have been paying attention to my surroundings in a dodgy neighbourhood. I never thought, never imagined,
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks, a small frown gracing his face.
“Narcissa’s boy.” She gives him a once-over. “Still a blood-traitor I see, fraternising with a half-blood.”
“You’re
“I want you to be happy, too,” he says. The silence between them is deafening and after several long seconds, Harry sighs.
“Merlin, I
________________________________________
He hadn't been offered his job back, and actually, despite being offered better positions within the Ministry, Draco had decided that he’d spent enough of his energy dealing with the Ministry to last him a lifetime. Instead, he’d opened a small legal aid agency in Diagon Alley where he offers advice on anything from legalese to legal advice for perplexed contract holders or individuals dealing with matters of workplace harassment and discrimation. Draco’s found some peace with his new work environment and goals. There are parts of his life that are still painful to deal with.
“Draco, you don’t have to lie to me or deal with this alone—”
The little boy. Ethan. A Squib born from an extramarital affair between…
talked about him. Ron and Hermione were worried you’d gone off your nut. It was—hell, it was hardly healthy. I rest my case.”
Granger’s shoulders tremble, as if she’s cold. She draws in a slow breath. “Ron is handling all the funeral preparations. I,” Granger pauses, drawing in another slow breath. “I don’t have the strength.”
With a startled gasp, Potter releases him at once, stumbling back so quickly he nearly trips over his pants and trousers. Now that he can move, Draco sprints away from Potter like a rabbit running from its prey, nearly colliding into the shelf of potion ingredients within the small space. He’s breathing heavily through his nostrils as he huddles in the corner. His vision starts to right itself, the room stops spinning, and he realises he’s still in his lab. He slowly faces Potter, whose jaw is slack. He watches as Potter closes his mouth and swallows.
Yes. He’s obviously having a nightmare right now; this can’t be reality, he thinks despairingly. But here he is with Ginny’s warm body pressed against him, her anchoring hand on his back, making this situation too real and so very fleeting all at once.
Draco’s voice catches. “I told him he shouldn’t say those things. That-that I didn’t want to hear it.” Draco breaks down, shaky, wet sobs bubbling up his throat. “I became completely closed off. In that moment I was my father—angry, confused, and disappointed because I refused to understand what my child was going through. I refused to even acknowledge it. I’m no better than those boys that bullied him. And I’m sorry.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco chokes out. The heat from the Veil comes off of it in thick waves, heating up the side of Draco’s body and face as Jenkins holds them perilously close to the surface.
The simple term of endearment causes Draco to wince. How many times has he heard it directed towards himself? Countless.
Draco tries to keep yet another rush of terrible thoughts from encroaching his mind but fails, feeling helpless.
Harry is hit with a pang of loneliness so fierce that he gasps, his body jerking from the wave of discomfort. He hasn’t felt this lonely in a very long time...
“Have you been to the Leaky at all since we’ve been back?” Draco asks through gritted teeth, trying to hold in as much smoke as possible before exhaling. When he does, he coughs roughly.
himself clean, not having the energy to stand under the showerhead to wash himself properly.
The Aurors caught the stranger with assistance from the Muggle Aurors – the police. He was required to come down to the place called New Scotland Yard to arrange for an official police identity parade in one week. He feels—well, he doesn’t know how he feels. He should feel elated by this, like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders thanks to Potter. But he doesn’t feel anything. He places the letter back down, feeds the owl a treat and watches as it takes off through the open window. He shrugs the letter off, entering the kitchen to throw together lunch. He eats a salad in relative peace, flipping through
He feels…
“But I haven’t read—”
It’s been a month since Draco learned that Harry was a werewolf.
“Ah! Mr Potter, right? What a pleasure it is to see you again,” Bart says jovially, pulling away from Malfoy to offer Harry his hand. Harry pumps the other man’s hand twice before dropping it as if it’s hot coal. Any man willing to snog Malfoy is someone unsavoury, he thinks. “I have a train to catch, so until next time!”
What was he on about anyway? Ah, yes. Boyfriends. Are they? He’s not sure Draco thinks so. He certainly isn’t ready for other people to assume so. That’s the only logical reason Harry can come up with, as to why Draco refuses to go to Honeydukes with him. Or to study together in the Great hall. Or to go flying with Harry on the weekends. It’s not like he’s asking him to hold hands and furiously make out in front of their friends.
It’s the tie. He’s wearing Harry’s tie.

for it. Because Malfoys don’t beg. Well, more like – Malfoys aren’t supposed to beg. Good thing Draco’s always been a rule breaker then.
Harry’s griping Draco’s thighs aggressively, digging his harsh thumbs into the flesh of it like Draco might run off any second now and it’s terribly endearing how his possessiveness shines through in moments like these. Like Draco could ever run off from him. He’s lapping at Draco’s hole rhythmically, plunging the tip of his tongue into it just to force a shiver out of Draco and when he does, he goes back to sweeping perfect equal licks all the way to Draco’s balls. Draco’s about to implode, so it’s a good thing that Harry stops for a moment, catching his breath and unhooking Draco’s ankles from where they rest on his back. He wipes his mouth carelessly with the back of his hand sending Draco a hungry lust-filled gaze and then he’s pushing Draco’s knees to his chest enabling a better position.
At dawn, when my body violently jerks me out of sleep and I open my eyes – there’s no breathing in the crook of my neck nor warm skin under my fingers. Again.
“See! I told you! There’s no way Harry would be involved with someone…
He’s okay with leaving it nameless at the moment though. He’s quite certain it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.
“Shall we clean up, love?” Harry asks a second later, stroking Draco’s hair back.
“So, will you see me tonight? Eight o’clock?” Harry pokes again with a lazy smirk, pulling his pants back on and buckling his belt.
Like with the hair caressing thing, this time is also the only time when Draco will let him make such cheesy declarations without objection. That’s not to say that Harry doesn’t make them all the time anyway, because of course he does, but they’re always met with a frown that says
It’s the bloody tie.
Everything stills for those couple of seconds it gets Draco to come to him. It seems that everybody in the room has stopped speaking. Harry holds his breath.
letting all his guards down, pausing all the bitchy snarkiness and the perpetual smart-mouthness even if just for a brief expanse of time. He is quiet and soft and
Harry frowns. He should’ve seen it coming. He’s not been able to coax him into anything like this before, so why would today be any different? He tries one more time though, just because he’s a tireless bastard.
“I’ll see you tonight, yes?” Harry asks, pressing wet splotchy kisses on the stretch of pale milky skin of Draco’s neck.
His eyes are so green, shining brightly like two emerald gemstones behind his glasses as Draco reaches out a shaky hand to straighten the frames on his nose. They’re all crooked and disheveled just like the rest of him is and Draco is mesmerized. He doesn’t feel capable of forming any coherent sentences right now though, so he just sticks to nodding his head with a stupid dazed smile on his lips instead. It’s the special one that stretches his sharp cheeks oddly and even though his teeth are blindingly white he knows they still come off weird when he has a smile like that plastered on his face. Only a handful of chosen people get to witness it and an even smaller amount get to have it be directed their way. Harry’s one of them of course and he always claims that it’s his favorite. He always tells Draco so too.
without telling us about it first,” Hermione says sternly, addressing Ron. But Ron’s face is still grimacing.
Harry shakes the thoughts away and focuses on the task of getting Draco Malfoy to finally attend a social gathering (if one of Gryffindorian excuses for getting pissed out of your mind could be called that) with him. As boyfriends. Or whatever. Harry cringes a bit at the wording, his mouth still latched onto the side of Draco’s extended neck. He’s so warm, so soft. Nothing like he was only fifteen minutes ago, before Harry strip him of his clothing and fucking him from the back into the old table in the long unused Charms classroom. Are they boyfriends though? Is that what this is? Harry’s not sure. He’s never had a boyfriend before. Him and Ginny were… well, different. It wasn’t anything like this. He’s never felt this ravenous about Ginny. Like he had to have her right at the spot; to touch and hold onto whatever part of her he could get.
I can’t sleep in
He’s swirling his warm spongy tongue all over Draco’s muscle, letting it dip inside teasingly, his beard simultaneously tickling and scratching and Draco can’t wait to be marked by it and sore deep inside when Harry’s done with him.
Harry intertwines their fingers until all ten knuckles are white and then they’re coming at the same time not having even attempted to time it. One just triggers the other, Harry’s cock twitching inside of Draco, while Draco’s hole quivers and spasms and his cock is pulses between their sweaty chests, coming untouched and sensitive.
First comes Blaise Zabini with his golden shirt, unbuttoned almost all the way and that smirk that never seems to get off of his gorgeous face. After him comes Pansy Parkinson and she’s equally as stunning, wearing a two piece maroon colored suit, with nothing but a lacey bra underneath.
He has a feeling that the bloke he’s actually shagging will come as more of a shock to Ron and Hermione than Goyle ever could.
“Ohhh Good Lord yes,” Draco moans as Harry finally slips inside, first only half of his heavy erect length and then the rest of it too, fitting snugly inside Draco like that’s exactly where it’s supposed to be. “
“Not even if I eat your ass until you come afterwards?” He tilts his head to side a little, hoping his eyes are glinting with the promise of something dirty to come. He’s got his fingers busy with buttoning up his shirt, but it feels like he’s taking it off. “Remember last Sunday?” He adds, recalling the day he and Draco spent at Harry’s dorm, with all of its other occupiers gone to Hogsmeade. Harry had him spread out on the sheets, writhing and shaking. If he remembers correctly (and he does) he made Draco come five times that afternoon. He gets hard only thinking about it.
Then what is it?
Harry doesn’t say anything to him, though. Instead, he brings his attention back onto Draco, hoping that Ron’s outburst hadn’t made him withdraw. To Harry’s utter joy, it hasn’t. Draco’s still there. In fact, he’s walking in what looks to be Harry’s direction.
Sure he loves that first half a second when he slips into Draco’s yielding body beneath him, when everything is so terribly slick and swollen that he has to stop himself from plugging forwards before he loses it completely or those snippets before they both finish when every sensation is amplified from the building pleasure and his eyes are blurry from sweat and tears of frustration, but no matter how bone-deep and core-shaking those couple of seconds are, they don’t come close to the intensity of the affection that overflows him after they’re over.
I touch myself and think about you saying
He can hear the chatter of people come back, the wireless kick in, the party continue, like no one cares. And no one cares. It’s good. It’s good having Draco like this, on his lap, in front of all of his friends. He’s good. They’ll be good.
“Yes well. It’s all part of my charm.”
“Fuck, fucking hell! Are...are you okay?” Harry whispers, his eyes wide and fearful behind his glasses. Draco shakes his head, his throat contracting as Harry scrambles off of him. “Oh my God, please, what’s happening…” Draco continues to shake his head, his hand reaching out to squeeze Harry’s briefly.
Harry nods. “I happen to agree with you, Ashley. That’s why it’s important that we have appropriate suggested profiles on the types of individuals that might be involved,” Harry says, tapping a pile of folders placed on the table before him. “I want offender observations leading to sufficient reasons for these crimes, maybe actual suspected individuals on my desk within the next 24-hours.”
He loses his suit jacket somewhere along the night, not that he cares, but that starfish brooch was worth a pretty Galleon. He doesn’t think twice about it when he finds himself in the middle of a Muggle club, pressed between Bitty and Blaise as they grind together to the beat of House music, something he recalls from his club-hopping with Pansy, Theo, and Millie. They keep dancing, keep drinking, and Bitty shoves her own personal snuff bullet in Draco’s hands in the middle of the club. It’s been so long since Draco’s indulged that taking pulls from the bullet feels like the warm embrace of a loving friend. They take pulls from it throughout the night, the supply seemingly endless.
Draco laughs, but Harry can see how bright Draco’s eyes are.
When he reaches the first-floor landing he notices that the sconces on the wall come to life for him, dim pools of light illuminating the dark path down the narrow hallway. Draco can make out a curved, ominous staircase at the very end, and he knows that he does not want to creep up those stairs, fear crawling up the back of his spine. He doesn’t know how Harry can live here, with its dark corners and musty smell.
Draco hides his shaking hands under his thighs. “I think it’s finally happened. I’ve lost the plot.”
After a few lines it feels like he’s been strung upside down: all the blood rushes to the top of his head, fiercely pumping through his much too-thin blood vessels. His skin suddenly feels hot and nearly unbearable to touch as his eyes water from the horrid taste dripping down the back of his throat. He feels like he’s been hit with a Stinging Hex, his whole body tightening but awakening with an explosive surge of jittery nerves, each climbing atop one another, vying to be the first to burst from the top of his head. He feels like he’s flying. Only without a fucking broom.
“Tell them to keep out of the corridors, the Shafiq ancestors are there. Just stick to the main rooms and bedrooms,” he warns. Theo nods and gives him a short salute.
“Thank you,” Draco says softly, taking the towel from him to hug against his chest.
Saturday morning finds Draco strolling through Portobello Market with a small paper cup of flat white in his hand and a pair of square Chanel shades covering his eyes. Last night was one of the rare occasions that both his mates were at home, so they spent it together, enjoying a lavish charcuterie board and too much Prosecco.
“You’re not a lesbian then?”
exactly did you find all this out?”
“Oh, fuck.”
“May I kiss you, Potter?” Draco asks, feeling bold.
“He is quite competitive, but I’m sure you know all about that,” the older man says with a small nod, his muscled arm tightening around Malfoy. Malfoy calmly hands him a macchiato, which Bart takes gratefully. “Did Draco mention his impending honouring at Imperial College School of Medicine?” Bart takes a sip of his coffee, a slow smug look spreading across his handsome face.
taste when it comes to interior design. Mummy was sick with jealousy when she saw their newly remodeled ballroom last Autumn,” Pansy says, staring up at the chandelier in awe.
“Merlin! Does she know what the Second Wizarding War is?” Blaise snorts as Draco laughs.
Draco stares up at the ceiling. “Astounding.”
“I want you to slowly remove your trousers, Draco.”
Trust him. It’s such a loaded request. He doesn’t trust himself, so he doesn’t know if he’s brave enough to put all of what he can’t do for himself in Potter, but he wants to try. He wants to feel safe. He wants Potter to help him feel safe again, and if that means taking a leap of faith, Draco decides he’ll do it.

“That’s worth more than your stupid Ming,” Ginny says sullenly.

“Stop!” he says, voice high and frightened. “Stop! Stop! Get off me!”
“Yes...but Draco—”
He’s right where he should be.
Draco can feel sweat building on his forehead as a dull fog settles over his thoughts. The strange feeling is compounded with another, more insidious sensation; the feeling rooted in his chest is a kind of slow unravelling of emotions he’s kept closed off since the war and more recently, his mother’s death. Petty insults, childish, petulant fears, his tightly-wound anger, violence, hatred, all his cruel little idiosyncrasies feel as if they’re seeping out to the forefront of his mind. He feels reckless despite his efforts to maintain constant control. He feels weak.
“She sings a different tune about my madness when we’re in the bedroom.”
Draco starts, shocked. “What were her reasons? Why was I not provided her letter of resignation as well?”
-------
Harry’s fingers leave his hair. Draco makes a small noise from the loss and watches Harry get up from the sofa to head towards the kitchen. A cabinet door opens gracefully as a glass floats out towards Harry who plucks it from the air, the faucet flicking on before he even approaches it to run cold water into the glass. Draco’s in awe of Harry’s wandless and non-verbal skills. It shouldn’t be possible, the fluidity and the seemingly inherent nature of it. A mature magical person ordinarily can do maybe one or two tasks wandlessly, wandlessly
The walk to Granger’s new office is a wordless affair rife with tension so strong that halfway through their journey Draco feels an actual cramp in his neck and shoulders from the stress. There is no significant conversation between them, their earlier exchange of barbed insults hanging like a foul odour in the air, exacerbating the wedge of distrust and hatred that’s existed between them since the very first day they met. Draco can sense that Potter is holding his tongue, probably for the first time in his incredibly short-lived, moronic life. Even in death the man is frustrating. Draco has to push away the budding desire to lash out at Potter with a fiery force that’s a culmination of pure fury and indignation. Though, Draco's acutely aware that something at the core of him has shifted from the encounter. Potter’s anger and surprising cruelty exposed a truth about Draco’s crumbling health.
Draco understands because he can feel it too. And he can feel Potter’s presence, and not like before, not the slick-like oozing cold, but strong and alluring. If Draco closes his eyes he can almost convince himself that Potter is solid and radiating a kind of comforting warmth.
Draco’s almost certain that if Harry was somehow lured down to the Death Chamber and encountered the Veil unwillingly, he’d be there, trapped in the marble. It was the most obvious possibility. Occam’s razor.
“We can do that after. You want this more than I do,” Queensbury says, pressing his hips against Draco’s. “You’re hard. Don’t fight it, Draco. Just give yourself to me.”
Draco nods, feeling himself drifting a bit. He clenches the armrest of his chair, trying to steady himself. “That’s a pretty great idea.”
Draco snorts. “I thought it would be nice being on the right side of it for once.” He groans. “Do we have to talk about work? I don’t have the energy. Do you visit this pub often?”
— he’s been running his hands through his hair like crazy since finishing off Theo’s eight-ball and downing some more gin and tonic—but Theo sounds hysterical.
“Can I...can I
The phone line goes dead.
safe. He had spent so long pretending he didn’t need or want it. But despite his feelings for Harry, Draco can’t seem to reconcile his wants with his reality, and his reality is that he’s created nothing but an ocean of lies between them. He wants to stop the lies, but he’s afraid to. He’s only been able to partially share the truth with Harry, through secrets and anonymity, but that’s not enough.
Draco is coming to terms with some peculiar aspects of himself. After answering an Ad in the shadiest part of the Daily Prophet, he's confronted with both the past and the future.
“Er,” Harry says weakly. That sounds like murder to him. They’re trying to kill him.
“You are so special, look at you. Amazing,” Harry says, placing a chaste kiss against Draco’s knee. “Yeah?”
Draco chuckles, his heart soaring at the love he feels for his best friend. He lifts his arms to wrap loosely around Pansy’s waist, pulling her in closer. He presses his face into her stomach.
“I contacted McGonagall who provided me a list of names of people she could recall having attended the wedding...people she thought are still alive,” Draco explains, a sad look on his face. “This one woman in particular, a witch by the name of Laura Stephens, responded. She explained that her mother, Mary MacDonald, passed away a year ago. Mary fled to Australia just days after your parents’ wedding.”
Draco looks up from the cameras, wondering what kind of wanker is out jogging shirtless in February, and pushes his shades to the top of his head. His hand tightens around his cup so hard that the lid pops off.
Draco hasn’t read it yet, but Harry, of course, had offered himself up to go public as a credible source, a somewhat whistleblower to the shadow government and crimes happening within the Ministry. When Harry had mentioned it the first time, Draco had gone crazy with anger and paranoia. There was no way he was going to allow Harry to put a target on his back, larger than the one he already carries around. When it had been just the idea of releasing the dossier anonymously to the media, Draco had supported that, but if they needed to attach a face to the story to make it verifiable— well, the risk had just been too great. There had to be another way.
Before I drift off completely, I think about the ingredients I have on hand in the kitchen and decide what I’m making for breakfast in the morning, because Draco came back, and my world finally feels whole and right, and I’m never letting him go again.
thing on my mind when I dragged you up here was getting you alone so I could snog you senseless."
"Of course I will, but Harry—"
It's nothing like Malfoy Manor, and Draco can tell Potter's a little thrown by that. But it's big enough for Draco and Teddy, and it's well-decorated and kept in order by a small staff of free house elves. Draco is proud of it, and he watches Potter closely, looking for signs of disapproval.
"Just the rest of the bloody castle," Draco grumbles, looking annoyed.
Draco gestures at the sofa in the sitting room through the open doorway. “Sit down. I’ll make tea.”
Harry laughed. "I was just guessing and got lucky, but I expect to be called the 'Quidditch Whisperer' from now on."
. On Wolfsbane you're basically a giant puppy, did you know that?"
Momentarily distracted, he slowly unfolded the newspaper and took in the front page. Harry quickly re-folded the newspaper and tossed it in the bin. He grabbed his wand from the counter where he'd left it and pointed it, and the paper burst into flames, right as Draco walked into the room to see what was taking so long.
wearing trousers, I assume that’s what you meant.”
He's trying to take some of the blame, trying to ease my pain and guilt even though he doesn't deserve any of it. Bloody hero.
Harry turned wide puppy-dog eyes on her, and she laughed and tossed him one.
Harry was looking around at them all. His expression was full of gratitude, but Draco caught the hint of conflict in his eyes when he glanced over. He knew Harry didn't like others sacrificing for him—it was a weight he still carried after losing so many people in the war.
Ron's eyes narrowed. "You can't. I don't
Ron made gagging sounds behind them.
"I'm so sorry, love." Harry tightened his arms around him. "Your father is wrong. You've done nothing but good for the Malfoy name since the War. You apologized and made reparations, you kept your head down, you found a career that you love and you've been helping people ever since...you can't listen to him."
We've been working on this for weeks! Come on, Rosie!"
Harry hugged his two best friends and followed them to the Ministry Floos to go home, but when he got to Grimmauld Place, he found Jenkins alone.
," Harry responded flatly, eyes dull and haunted.
"I think so," Hermione finally said, her voice tinged with sadness. "I think we all have to."
Harry asked polite questions and listened to the responses. Draco remained silent at his side, listening and observing, picking up on as many non-verbal cues as he could. He learned a considerable amount of information this way.
too hard at whatever Harry just said.
Harry’s rolling laughter follows him as Draco goes to the pantry in search of the bottle of Muggle vodka Harry gave
When Draco had asked him about costumes, Harry had sighed and told him it didn't matter, because he didn't want to go, but that Draco could go without him if he wanted.
When the song is over, Draco excuses himself, citing the excuse that he needs to check on Teddy, despite the fact that he’s surrounded by family and friends and perfectly safe. Draco hides in Ginny’s old bedroom until the urge to break down subsides, then rejoins the party with his smile firmly in place.
"We're following up on a disturbing report, Potter." Warren eyed Harry's cane. "That you were in an...altercation...with another werewolf. One that ended in murder."
Draco took Harry's scorching hand and Apparated them both to St. Mungo's Hospital.
Draco scoots closer and snuggles up to his boyfriend face-to-face, tucking his head under Harry's chin and wrapping an arm around him. Harry settles an arm over him too, tugging the blanket up over them both and sighing contentedly.
“We’re okay?”
sorry," Draco responded softly, reaching up to brush a hand over his cheek. "I should have remembered, I should have realized—"
Eventually, Draco drifts outside to the porch to sip his Butterbeer alone, grateful for the quiet. He watches a gnome digging around in the garden for a bit, until the back door opens behind him.
He smiled sadly. "I'm
Harry glanced back. "For Draco."
Harry lingered in the doorway, knowing better than to interrupt Draco when he was actively brewing. He didn't mind waiting and watching him, anyway. The sight of Draco, focused and a little bit disheveled from the work and the heat, eyes bright with excitement and a smudge of ink across his cheek, was always alluring.
They spent the day in bed, eating meals from trays, sleeping, talking, reading, kissing fervently until that devolved into heated snogging and then slow, passionate love-making, and then (in Harry's case), more sleeping.
Draco watches from the window as Harry laughs, gesticulating wildly with his hands. David says something back, demonstrating some kind of Quidditch maneuver gone wrong, and he laughs, too. He claps Harry on the shoulder as they talk, a friendly gesture.
precedence for our situation, in 1915, a pack faced a situation almost exactly the same as ours. Interfering
The knowing look she gives him as he sputters and coughs out fervent denials of any such plans is no comfort at all.
It makes Draco's stomach roil with guilt. He's been treating Harry like he'd jilted him somehow, keeping him at arms-length and their conversations stilted, even though Harry hasn't really done anything wrong. Seeing him with Derek had been horrible, but Harry didn't
"Mm. Later," Harry agreed, then said, "I think Ron is getting suspicious."
“Draco!” A familiar voice calls.
Draco thinks.
"What?"
Draco advanced on Harry as he reigned his magic back in and pocketed his wand.
"Is everything okay? You know you can talk to me about—"
"Oh." Draco could feel his face flaming. He cringed internally; he was usually extremely socially adept—able to easily adapt to any situation—but he felt out of his depth here, and he hated it. "We did. A long time ago. But now we, erm, don't. Anymore."
“I don’t know.” Draco is so very tired, suddenly. “I just...I’m not proud of how it ended. I didn’t want to talk about it. With anyone, not just you.”
Draco propped himself up on one arm to stare incredulously at him. "Between the sanctuary and the wedding we've been working nonstop! It's been
“Lottie,” Harry cuts her off, “you and Violet are welcome here for as long as you’d like, you know that. But...what happened with Dudley? Are you…?”
"Yeah." Harry magically cleans himself and the sheets up with a wave of his wand, tugs the towel off his waist and tosses it on the floor, then lays down beside Draco and smiles sleepily, reaching out for him. "Cuddle with me?"
He liked to cook, and Draco quickly became his sounding board to try all kinds of new recipes — Some good, some not.
The house elf appeared beside him. "What can I do for you Master Draco?"
"Harry," Draco murmured, stroking his hair again.
"No," Harry rasped. "Not anymore."
“I um, I may have hit him with a Hex to the back before he made it out the front door.”
does."
, as expected. There isn't much more to say. Can you take my mind off of it for a little while?
A few minutes later, they're standing in front of the ruins of the old cottage where Harry's parents had been murdered, where Hagrid had pulled him from the wreckage after he'd defeated Voldemort for the first time.
"Well, you're a juvenile, jealous, unhinged, insecure
"I won't disagree with you there," Draco hears the bitterness in his tone, notices the sympathetic look that Ron slants over at him, but tries to ignore both. "You're right, we'd better get in the house."
Draco took Harry's hand where it was resting loosely on his waist, and gave it a reassuring squeeze.
Harry reaches into his coat again. "I know this is probably a weird day for this,
Ron pushes the door open to peek inside, and the Silencing Charm breaks.
“I...what?”
A few days later, when Draco arrived at Grimmauld Place, he found Harry practically bouncing with excitement.
"What are you thinking about?"
Harry didn't go home, however. He Apparated directly to Malfoy Manor.
"I do," Draco smiled, lying down on his chest with a contented sigh. "Later."
“I know. I shouldn’t have let it.”
Harry lowers his wand, his eyes locked on Draco’s face, but Brandon is still clearly itching for a fight.
The Healer murmurs a few spells in quick succession before nodding, apparently satisfied. “Everything appears in order. You’re free to go home. I would recommend refraining from any...strenuous activity,” the man coughs and glances at Draco, “for at least twelve hours to give your body time to recover from the strain of the Curse. But tomorrow you should be in the clear to resume your, er, normal level of physical activity.”
"I'm sure it's all good," he answered with a smile of his own.
His back is to Draco. The first thing he notices is how much better Harry’s recent injury looks. The scar curves around his side, bright pink and slightly raised against his copper skin, but mostly healed.
even warmed with a charm the next day. I can only imagine how good it was last night when it was fresh.”
Harry gives him a shy smile. "Yeah?"
"Maybe it has to do with the fact that you made me buy this green monstrosity in the first place," Harry teased.
, or anything.”
As he showers and gets ready for work at home, Draco’s thoughts take a more wholesome turn, wondering what it would be like to wake up with the version of Harry he’s just seen, still sleepy and adorably tousled, to stay and eat breakfast with him, to leave for work after a long, sweet kiss…
Draco doesn’t have the patience to play this game. The realization that this isn’t even the first time this has happened and he was just too blind to see it strikes him, and his temper snaps. “Oh? And who were
Draco sighed. "Fine, I promise. I told Hermione I'd let her know what was going on. I'll go over and speak to her and Weasley tonight. Let them know you're going to live and all that."
The next morning, they'd talked.
do you get him to go to bed at night?” Potter asks, looking a bit desperate, catching Draco by the arm before he can slip away. “I can’t do another month like last time. I’ll go insane!”
“Do you have a minute? It’s Teddy.”
Draco forcefully threw the book into the fireplace and cast an Incendio Charm at it for good measure. It burned to ash in seconds.

thinks?' Yes, I'm quite sure he meant me."
Draco dropped his head back onto the pillow with a thump, burying his face in it so that his voice was muffled. "What are they saying?"
Draco set Harry on top of the deep purple duvet, gently brushing his unruly hair off of his forehead before rubbing at his own aching arms and shoulders. He turned to the older man, who was watching him impassively.
He also still liked having his hair pulled, Harry discovered. And when Harry slid his hands up the back of his t-shirt and lightly dragged his nails back down.
, but that wasn’t what I was…”
fucked up. I just enjoy talking to her sometimes! Like, a mother figure? Not...
"Of course not, darling. I'm just enjoying our time together. Would you like to go anywhere else while we're in Diagon Alley? Quality Quidditch Supplies, perhaps?"
"What are you going to..."
They both look away again, an awkward silence stretching between them until Harry breaks it, blurting—
As he sinks back into his chair, he's hit with the unpleasant realization that neither of them cast a Silencing Charm and his entire staff just heard that little screaming match.
—I'd imagine he's completely terrified right now."
” Draco is rapidly getting tired of this conversation and has to resist the urge to run a hand over his face in frustration.
Harry found Draco fast asleep on a sofa in the library, a book about Potions theory still in his lap.
Harry lifted a hand to flip him off, but didn't stop kissing Draco.
“I’m certainly not opposed,” Draco laughs, and Harry resumes kissing his way back up his neck. “Aren’t you tired, though?”
"Alright, what happened this time? I thought you were happy with Paul. He was nice, and Teddy liked him, even though I know it didn't seem like it the other day... He told me he liked that Paul made you smile."
Draco made a muted sound of pleasure against his mouth and kissed back, his hands sliding up into Harry's hair. Everything and everyone else disappeared in Harry's mind. Nothing mattered except the way Draco's mouth was moving against his, the hot slide of their tongues, the gentle tug of his fingers in his hair, the warmth of his chest pressed against his own...nothing else even existed.
"So, what's
"No." Harry shook his head minutely, careful not to wake his sleeping fiancé. "I never wanted this. I was thrown into it, and I was willing to try my best, but Nadine is actually
"That's what Kingsley said," Harry chuckled, stroking Draco's cheek with his thumb.
"I don't have enough bloody
"Good," Pansy smiled. "I like him. I forgot just how sassy that boy can be. It's
"You weren't at the time! You were just a trainee!"
“Feeling up to some...physical activity...this morning?”
“That was excellent, Teddy! The way you feinted to the right and then threw it through the middle? I almost didn’t see it coming!”
Draco looked stricken. "Starting when?"
"No," Draco shakes his head, "all of this is new to me, but I've heard it's nice."
“He’s only...well, we’ve never actually talked about it. But he can’t be more than ten years older than us!”
He swallows hard, the anger in his eyes fading away as they fill with a grief that matches my own.
“Harry? It’s late, what—? Is everything okay?”
"It was," Draco's face burned even brighter, and he whispered. "Until I fell in love with you."
She barely has time to nod before Ron grabs Draco's arm and Apparates them directly to the hospital Waiting Room.
"Narcissa—"
, so you can't talk," Ginny chimes in with a grin. "Harry and I never made you watch
Isn't that what you promised earlier?" Draco whispered in his ear.
Draco shivered, a thrill running up his spine. "Say that again."
“You’re absolutely right, Teddy,” Draco’s mother agrees solemnly. “We don’t.”
“Oh.” Draco takes another nervous sip of his tea, disturbed by the dark turn of the conversation and the slightly manic look in Harry’s eyes, coupled with fear and deep sadness. “So, are you going to…”
Draco thinks. They crinkle at the corners as Harry smiles at him again, and Draco’s stomach flutters nervously.
"No."
And then Draco is running, crossing the space between them and leaping into Harry's arms, legs coiling around his waist. Harry catches him in an impressive show of strength, holding him and looking at him with such unabashed love and
Where's that nice Healer from yesterday? I want her to come back. I hate all the rest."
," Harry's voice went cold. "He's my partner, I want him here. How would you feel if I referred to Hermione that way?"
He hops up onto the counter, feet dangling, and watches Draco wash his hands in the sink on the far wall before climbing up to sit beside him.
“What? Not going to defend him after all, Potter?”
Lottie nods and allows him to escort her upstairs.

Harry brushed a stray lock of hair out of Draco's face. "You didn't."
"I love you," Draco murmured.
attempted to go home and take a shower that morning, and he hadn't even made it down the hallway before a panic attack had begun and he had lost the ability to breathe. Back in Harry's room he'd been able to calm down, but he wouldn't be leaving again anytime soon.
“Yeah!” Teddy changes his hair to match Harry’s. “Be nice, Dad!”
Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm not answering that. Tell me about this new girlfriend you mentioned in your last letter." At this, Pansy actually looked slightly love-struck, and Draco grinned. "Oh, you
Harry's face lights up at the sight of him, and that softens him a bit, but he still glares at the two young men in front of him.
"Really went all out this time, didn't you?" Ron asked, nodding toward the open doorway.
“‘They might find you a

Harry shook his head, squeezing his eyes shut.
Draco pulled him into a tight hug before taking his hand and guiding him into the large living room where Christine and a large number of werewolves were gathered.
"It's bigger than your old sofa," Draco huffed. "
Harry was shouting, "you don't know
had a broom for him to borrow, as it turned out. He'd bought his house out in the country specifically for the large parcel of land that came with it, which was heavily Warded against Muggles and intruders alike, and provided for spectacular flying. They'd even managed to spell a set of goal posts a mile away from the house where they spent hours trying to get Quaffles past one another when they needed a break from chasing the Snitch.
"The laws are changing quickly, Mr. Malfoy," Harry recognized the voice that answered. McDougal. "You would do well to keep up."
"Not exactly," Harry said slowly, "something like that, but also a hospital, and a school. All in one. A sort of...sanctuary. The children could be taught magic in a safe environment. Healers could be trained in werewolf magic and healing. I want to fight for rights within the magical community as well, fight for acceptance and peace, but what if we started by showing that werewolves just want safety and security? Hermione is already working on the rest."
"Okay." Draco cups his cheek and plants a firm kiss on his mouth. "Thank you, for bringing me here."
"Already see that face every time I look in a bloody mirror."

Ron took off running, pushing past anyone who got in his way as he bolted toward the Minister's office on the other end of the floor.

"No Healer would ever come to a Werewolf House."
"What? I keep every single one I get of me! I love them!" Ron laughed.
Harry smiled and held his arms out, offering. Hermione passed the drooling baby over, laughing as she spat all over him exclaiming. "Hawy!" He didn't even care, truth be told. Draco made a disgruntled noise in his sleep, and Harry smiled, running the hand not securing Rose in his lap over Draco's hair.
They sit in silence for a little while, until curiosity and awkwardness prompts Draco to ask a question that he’s been dying to ask for ages.
Draco smiled and shook his head slightly against his pillow. "You're incorrigible. Didn't you get enough last night?"
"I think he's had his memory modified."
"Time's up, Mr. Malfoy," Troll said sharply.
Harry kissed Draco's forehead. "Time to wake up, gorgeous."
Draco pouts again, and then he shivers. His body shifts from scorching hot to freezing cold in a flash, and he panics. "Harry!"
Nadine sighed, then whimpered in her sleep, shifting under the blanket.
Potter can’t resist Teddy’s pleading either, apparently. Teddy and Draco both watch through the huge windows of the ice cream parlour as he walks the girl outside. He says something, then allows her to press a kiss to his cheek but doesn’t encourage any further physical affection before she Apparates away.

“Oh, um, fine. Good, I mean. Really really good.”
"But how would he...it doesn't make sense, Kasper," Lorcan spoke more calmly than he had the entire morning. "He would have had to prepare an official challenge...is it possible? And why?"
wanted to go home. A light knock on the door saved Harry from having to come up with a response.
"Right," Harry confirmed, looking guilty. "He gets really weird when I tell him about, I don't know, dating, or..."
A shout from outside finally gives him an indication as to where they might be.
Draco's expression hardened. "

to do so, in fact."
Draco lets him pull him to his feet and lead him out onto the floor. “I haven’t been sulking, I’m just tired. Are you sure you’re up for more dancing?
Hermione walked into the Magical Creatures Department of the Ministry of Magic and froze in confusion. The typically small and quiet department was in uproar. Harry and Ron's boss Gawain Robards was there, and so was Ron's Auror partner, Gregory McDougal.
Draco draped himself over Harry, pressing him down into the cold floor. Harry snapped his fingers to clean up the mess and wrapped his arms around him.
Harry's voice goes low and cold. "Do you have any idea the damage you've done? You could have ended my career with that rumor, if not for that confession you just made, and my personal life—" Harry cuts himself off abruptly, sucking in a sharp breath. "You're fired, Davis. Get your things and get out of my sight."
He watches Harry’s back until he disappears from view to go upstairs before collapsing into one of the kitchen chairs and covering his face with his hands.
Lost in his thoughts, Harry didn't notice when the song ended. He jumped in his seat when Draco leaned over and whispered loudly in his ear. "So, now that Nadine's officially taken over as Alpha, does that mean I can top occasionally again?"
Harry slowly pulled out and waved a hand, Vanishing every trace of the mess they'd just made. Draco smiled and leaned down to kiss him as Harry pulled the quilt back up over them both. Draco settled against his chest, sliding a hand up to tangle in his soft, thick hair.
On his way out, Harry hugged a teary Hermione and ruffled Thomas's hair when he found them in the kitchen.
Back in their bedroom, Draco was pouting.
"Nope, only runs," Harry laughed, and then he sighed. "Nadine's upset about something. I'm surprised I didn't sense it sooner. We'd better go check on her."
seem better, and Draco had missed his work, and so he spent the day sweating over cauldrons in the spare room of his flat that he'd converted into a small potions lab. He sent the order off in the afternoon, took a quick shower, and Apparated over to Grimmauld Place.
He tried to smile at her when she pulled away, but it looked more like a grimace. "It's alright," he repeated. "I'll go, let you two talk. I'll be back."
Harry. Who came home late last night, covered in sweat and grime after dueling and arresting the dark wizard he'd been after for weeks. He'd had no energy for anything but a quick shower and to fall into bed.
"It's the fucking

"Oh, sod off," Harry laughs.
She nodded. "Thanks for listening, Harry. Let's go catch up to those boys of ours before they eat all the raspberries."
“Thank you.”
“I thought…” Harry swallows hard. “I thought you’d moved on. I didn’t dare hope…”
Teddy sighs and agrees. He takes Harry’s hand and Draco follows them up to the front of the shop as they go pay for Teddy’s robes, determinedly
"Later," Harry growls, dragging Draco toward the stairs to the bedrooms.
"You're too late I'm afraid," Harry laughed. "The moment is over. You missed it."
"No one will ever have the power to threaten you and Thomas again," Harry whispered, and she sobbed against his shoulder.
“I haven’t yet,” Harry takes a sip of mulled mead and glances over at Draco. “I’d like to, though. Draco blushes every time anyone asks about him. Look.”
"Stand

“Where did it come from?” Ron Weasley asks. It takes a moment for the words to penetrate Draco’s frenzied mind, but when they do Draco points, and the other man takes off running.
Teddy rarely lets either of them do more than hug him, especially in public, and holding hands has been out of the question for at least a year. But now the three of them make their way down the street, a wall of clasped hands that people have to walk around.

Lost in thought, Draco walks headlong into someone, knocking them to the ground.

,” he says, repeating Harry’s drunken words from so long ago.
"Good morning, Mr. Potter!" This Healer was a new face, a rotund woman with kind, maternal features and curly brown hair, and her cheerful greeting sounded sincere, which was definitely new. "I'm Healer Gordon and I'm taking over your treatment for the rest of the day. How are you feeling?"
They ate, and then Draco started reading one of the new books Harry had brought from the library at Wolf's Hollow. Harry curled against Draco's leg and went back to sleep.
Draco walked in the direction Harry had indicated, watching his feet as he carefully traversed the uneven ground and dragging Harry along with him until, eventually, Harry slumped against him and passed out entirely. Draco re-cast his Lightening Charm and picked him up.
She points, and I follow her gaze to a brunet dancing a little ways away, watching us and staring openly at my forehead. Absolutely not. I shake my head.

Ron gave him a tentative smile. "Old joke," he explained with a shrug.
," Draco breathed. This part would never be easy. He knelt beside his fiancé and gently put his hands on him. After conjuring a warm, sweet-smelling oil onto his hands with a new Spell he'd learned, Draco massaged Harry from his neck and shoulders down all the way down to his calves and feet. Harry let out soft hisses of relief as Draco softened the knots in his muscles. He summoned clothes from the wardrobe and carefully helped him get dressed, then helped him into bed. Harry was only semi-coherent, but he slurred 'thank you's' and 'I love you's' before going right back to sleep.
“Thanks, Harry,” he forces out. “Are you bringing Derek?”
"Okay, do you want...?"
“And you never will,” I glower at her.
After a moment, the door swung open. Behind it stood a woman. She had beautiful gunmetal grey hair that fell loosely to her waist and she wore a faded, but clean, dark blue dress. Her eyes were guarded as she took in the sight of them.
Draco. I was...I was trying to distract myself, and he was there, and he was willing, and I knew I wasn’t happy, but in the moment I didn’t care, because I didn’t think you would ever…”
"No," Nadine laughed as she led them through the large front doors. "Harry here got married tonight. You've arrived in the middle of the party I'm afraid."
"What?"
"What?" Draco gasps, "what did that do to you?"

for Christmas last year. It takes a few minutes to find it, but he eventually returns with the bottle and no drinking glasses, and Harry’s eyes widen.
“It’s not that, Ron,” Harry sighs. “Not anymore. It’s just...too late. Again.
Draco grinned. "Harry raided the library at Wolf's Hollow. Books about werewolves written

Harry took the tray and their plates, politely offering to wash them. Draco watched him go, eyes locked on that firm arse, still only covered by a thin layer of fabric. Yes, green was

Harry walked through the halls of the old Manor. He stopped by the kitchen and requested a plate of sandwiches for them both for lunch and one of Sofia's famous strawberry cheese pastries for Draco. He paused outside the third classroom door, where the nine and ten-year-olds were in class with Lewis. There were ten of them in total, and they were a wild bunch, but Harry knew that Lewis could handle them. He listened as they enthusiastically spouted answers to an arithmetic game they seemed to be playing as a class.

Hermione sighed sadly. "Greyback escaped custody. Harry was working the case, trying to track him down. Greyback let himself be seen outside a small village on a full moon night just before he turned, and when Harry's Auror team went after him, Greyback hunted and attacked Harry."
Harry groans into his arms, where his head is buried. "I know."
“She was.” I turn onto my side with my back to him, knowing he’ll want to examine the enormous phoenix I’d gotten during the MACUSA training next. He runs both hands down the smooth, brightly-colored skin. “Why the phoenix? Because you died and came back?”
"To everyone outside this room, especially Draco, this
“That’s a relief,” Draco smiles. “I’m glad you’re home.”
* * *
"What? I was just going to say we'd be going to get some dinner. I'm famished." Draco said innocently.
Harry crawled down the bed, jostling the mattress as little as possible, and made his way downstairs.
"Yeah, it's a mess." Draco stood up. "Listen, Panse. It's getting late and I'm tired. Let's get together again soon though, okay?"
Harry laughed and kissed him again, gently setting him back on his feet. "I'm telling your Healer about that too, you idiot," Draco scolded, but there was no heat behind it, and he reached out and touched his cheek, smiling softly at him.
A few days later, Harry, Draco, and Teddy privately celebrate Harry’s full recovery by attending a Quidditch match: The Chudley Cannons vs. Aunt Ginny and the Holyhead Harpies.

"I was overjoyed when we found each other after we both turned, thrilled to have a friend with me through the painful journey. We found and joined Fenrir's pack together. But I still couldn't love Lorcan, and I fell for Fenrir almost immediately, much to Lorcan's fury. Now he wants to punish me for it. Punish my son for it. My little boy. I don't know what to do, Harry. I'm afraid...I'll have to bond with him just to keep Thomas safe."
Draco looks back down at the large, ancient-looking tome in front of him, running a finger down the page to pick up where he left off. "Did you need something else, Potter?"
He leaned forward and caught Harry's mouth in a sweet kiss, then looked right into Harry's eyes and demanded, "Bond with me, Harry. Right now. You said this morning that you're mine? Prove it. Make me
"So. That was..."
“And you don’t feel ready for that?” Harry asks gently.
"I wanted to," Harry perched on the arm of the sofa. "Do you want to stay for tea?"
"Well,

George flushed, and Harry wasn't sure if it was the mention of the loss of his job, or the good deed he had done that embarrassed him more.
"How could it
They found basic toiletries in the bathroom, and they quickly prepared for bed. Soon, Harry was fast asleep in the bed beside him. Draco lay awake for a while, his thoughts racing, but eventually exhaustion took him as well, and he drifted off to sleep.
The group of werewolves just smiled at him and nodded to him in turn.
Harry shrugs. “It’s not like it matters.”
"Yes."
•••••
"Ah!" Draco's probably-broken ankle immediately gives out the second he puts any weight on it, but Harry catches him around the waist, pulling him up against his chest.
Draco reached out, fingers hovering over the discolored and damaged skin. He hesitated, looking up into Harry's face. "May I touch you?"
Draco studiously avoided looking at Harry's leg; the gruesome sight made him shiver.
Draco walked into the room to Harry cheering and Ron groaning.
"No, that's Ron's job." Harry's eyes widen in shock at his own words, and he covers his mouth, face flushing the exact shade of his Gryffindor tie. "I mean—I'm sorry, that was

Harry closes his eyes. “Not just once, several times. Just goes to show you can’t ever really know someone, even if you think you do.”
different. His long hair was a bit shinier, maybe. His eyes a bit brighter; molten silver instead of steel. The few freckles that had dusted across his nose, so light that you practically had to be close enough to kiss him to notice them, were completely gone, too. His teeth were almost blindingly white, like Lockhart's in Second Year, he thought with a slightly hysterical laugh.
Harry tilts his head in agreement and reaches out to brush his fingers over the longest of the scars, slashing from Draco’s left collarbone to his right hip. “That’s fair, but never physically. Never like this. Never again.”
"Good idea," she laughed. "I'm just going to finish the pasta and dinner will be served. Ron and Rosie are just playing in here, if you want to—"
"Been dreaming about this," Harry breathes as Draco strokes him slowly.
Draco padded down the stairs to the kitchen, where a light was shining up the staircase.
Harry perks up, in more ways than one. "Deal."
Draco swallowed hard. "Thank you," he managed to croak, before rolling over to face away from him.
“You’re here?”
"Of course you do," Harry teased, grinning back.
Draco saw right through his weak attempt at humor and pulled him into a tight hug. Harry released a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. He relaxed and leaned into the embrace, pressing his lips against Draco's cheek.
The flickering torches illuminated Lorcan's body, in human form, first, as he was nearest the door, and Draco could see that he was clearly dead, blood pooled gruesomely under his body, his eyes open and unseeing.
"No, hug you, you prat." Harry loosens his hold, laughing again, and presses a kiss to his pout. "Alright, let's go shower. And then, I was thinking..." He slides his hands down Draco's back to cup his bum. "We should break in our new bed."
Harry just laughs. “I’m sorry! We didn’t mean for it to be secretive, at least not until you got so weird and accusatory about it…”
Paul stops short of him, thankfully not pushing for any kind of physical greeting, and smiles politely at Harry and Teddy.
“Fuck me?” Harry asks hopefully, pushing him onto his back and grinding their hips together.

"Good."
“Even though you’re co-parenting a child together?”
He was cut off by a loud ruckus from downstairs.

“Oh.” Merlin, this conversation is painful. “Yeah, protection spells and everything, every time. I was careful.”

“Nothing permanent!” Harry says quickly. “Just a little variation on the Furnunculus Charm. The boils will go away after a couple of days. Faster if he goes to St. Mungo’s.”
A/N: My birthday gift to Draco is a surprise weekend post that moves him one step closer to the happy ending of this story.
“I know you’ve changed,” George shrugs again. “I know Ginny approves. And if you keep making Harry smile like that and you’ll win over the whole family in no time. Ron and I were watching you today, out the shop window. You and Harry are good together, anyone with eyes can see that.”
Draco and Teddy arrive at the Burrow a few days later just in time to watch Harry storm out of the house, his best friend on his heels.
Harry gives him a weak smile. "Your wish is my command."
"We can't solve all our problems with sex, you know," Harry teases.
Ron gave her a trusting smile.
"Before I tell you this, you have to swear not to tell anyone."
As they walked, Nadine fell into step with Harry, while Thomas ran ahead. Draco sped up to follow the little boy and keep an eye on him, sensing that Nadine needed a moment alone to finish talking with Harry.
"Oh, I don't think..." Hermione started.
and everything—"
Harry gives him a forced smile and ruffles his hair. “I know, kid. Thanks.”
"No, he wasn't!"
Draco thinks about Paul, with his dark hair, just starting to go grey at the temples, and striking blue eyes. He's...nice. Another safe choice.
"But if I'd been here, if I hadn't goaded McDougal—"
"'S okay. Where did you go?"
She turned around and walked down the hallway, and Harry shut the front door behind himself, before following her into a cozy living room.

Harry squeezed his eyes shut. "Why didn't you say anything?"
"Harry? Did you mean what you said earlier? About wanting to..."

Draco could have sworn Harry’s eyes darkened for a moment, but then he looks away and laughs lightly. “Sorry.”
"But I...I didn't expect..."

There’s no sign of them anywhere in the house, and no food preparation going on in the kitchen, which is strange since Harry is usually busy putting the finishing touches on dinner when Draco arrives on Sundays.
Draco snickers, then pulls a disgusted face. "I did
"Yeah. Erm. That...that does sound nice. The grounds at the Manor are beautiful in the Spring. We could get married there. Mum would be thrilled."
Harry shook his head and walked past him toward the stairs.
"I'm glad." Draco intertwines their fingers and squeezes.
Harry swallowed as he stared him down, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. "Draco, it's too soon. We talked about this. We have time. Time to take it slow, time to make sure this is what you really want—"
"Ron!" Hermione exclaimed.
Draco sent his stag Patronus careening towards St. Mungo's for Christine, and then, warily, he stood. There was blood on his hands and on his wand, sticky and hot, but he tried not to think about that for the moment.
But Harry hasn’t said anything about not being able to come this evening yet, and Draco is starting to hope he might actually show up. If he doesn’t, there’s only one more week before it’ll be his turn with Teddy, and Harry will
why you wouldn’t tell me why you broke up!” Harry laughs.
attractive anymore?" He asked softly.
Draco is terrified to voice the idea that he’s had over the course of the evening, but he and Potter have spent a reasonable amount of time around each other in the past few months without a single murder attempt, so he does.
He was seated at the kitchen table, slumped over a textbook, his face squished against the page. Harry grinned. He approached him and gently rubbed his back, waking him up slowly. "Dray?"
“I’m always up for Quidditch,” Draco smiles. “As long as someone’s got an eye on Teddy on the ground.”
"You have better taste than me, I'm not worried," Harry grinned up at him.
She reached out and touched his arm. "I'm sorry, Harry. I shouldn't have said that. I overstepped—"
“Where’s your bedroom?” He asks.
Harry's heart clenched painfully in his chest. "I...I'm really sorry, Teddy. I wasn't feeling well for a long time. I just needed some time to feel better."
Draco. Two years together, and you didn't even wait a
Harry at least has the decency to look guilty, but Draco’s mother merely looks amused.
He decided to borrow his sweet elderly neighbor's owl and write into work. He had two weeks of vacation he could take to give himself time to adjust before he had to face his Unspeakable coworkers in the Department of Mysteries and let the Ministry rumor mill spread the word about the scintillating secret the Malfoy family had been hiding.
“Well, the added benefit is that he went down more quickly than I’ve ever seen. Completely exhausted, poor tyke.”
"Yes, yes," Hermione cut her off. "I need to go."
Teddy looks at Potter, his lower lip trembling. “Sorry, Harry.”
A wild-eyed man with dark blond hair that hung in waves to his shoulders was caught by the arms and held back by two other men, both younger, with chocolate-brown skin, and short, textured black hair. They appeared to be twins. Although not identical, they bore an unmistakable resemblance to one another. The captive man was snarling and struggling against the two brothers in an attempt to get at Harry.
The young wolf went down again and found himself unable to get back up, no matter how hard he tried. He watched, green eyes cloudy with pain, and whimpered as the grey wolf advanced, teeth bared, its muzzle dripping with the black wolf's blood.
"What's wrong, Draco?"
She turned to look back at Harry.
Draco swallowed nervously, eyes still brimming with tears. He bit his lip. "Are you sure it's worth it
"Then I'll do it."
bad idea,” he mutters, his face going pale as he sways on his feet. “Should have walked to the Floo. Probably wouldn’t have been much better, though.”
"That's impossible."

in bed, but Draco had been caught up preparing for his Potions Mastery Examinations next week. He vaguely remembers tilting his face up for a kiss, running his fingers over the stubble on Harry's chin, telling him he'd come to bed soon.
Draco crawls up to lay on the pillows beside him, laughing softly at Harry’s blissed out, slightly dazed expression as he turns his head to look over at him. “You’re
"Well, you didn't give me a lot of time to come up with something," Harry said. "
was devastating. This doesn’t feel great, I’ll admit, but by comparison...well, I’ll be fine.”
“Are we doing okay?” Potter asks, frowning slightly. “Raising him like this? He doesn’t seem to mind all the inconsistency, but…I’m not sure. I worry about it.”
Harry smiles and touches his face again. "Rest and drink fluids, so that you can be better before then," he says firmly.
"You did the right thing. We're trying to lower their numbers, not give them our best people. It's too bad Weasley got to Potter first after
Harry swallows, and Draco tracks the movement along his throat with his eyes.
Draco brushes his fingers over Harry's cheek, watching his chest slowly rise and fall.
Back in his bed, Harry Potter shot up into a sitting position, gasping for breath. Draco groaned, woken by the abrupt movement beside him.
"Ron? You're here?"
A/N: Please forgive me for this one. It's awful, I know. I promise to fix everything by the end.
The man's nostrils flared. "That's not the problem, Mr. Potter. We. Don't. Serve. Your. Kind. Here. Understand? Everyone here knows what you are now. Leave, before I get security involved and wands are drawn."
As soon as he’s gone, Draco groans and buries his face in his hands. “Merlin, that was embarrassing.”
Draco smiled and brushed a hand through Harry's unruly hair. "Happy to."
Harry steps forward, offering a hand to shake. “Paul! It’s great to finally meet you.”
And he
—" He lunged off the bed and stumbled into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before he began to be sick. Draco followed him, crouching beside Harry and setting a tentative hand on his back.
"I know," Draco's voice sounds small. "I know, darling."
Harry chose to stay quiet, ignoring the other werewolf's taunts as he carefully checked the doors of each cell to make sure they were locked.
When they had read everything they could, Draco finally convinced Harry it was time to loop in Hermione, which, much to Draco's dismay, also meant looping in her husband.
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Lottie says, “I didn’t know where else to go.”
you, I'm not! If I was, he'd have to have been 'influencing' me since we were sixteen years old! I've wanted him since we were
Harry gave him a reassuring smile. "No, I'm afraid you're stuck with me."
Harry nodded.
She shrugged and thought for a second, then knocked loudly on the bedroom door several times.
Lottie’s hand flew to her mouth. “Those poor children...that’s awful.”
“Hi,” Harry leans in for a kiss, and Draco purposely grinds forward against him as their lips meet, eliciting a low moan from Harry that Draco doesn’t think he’ll ever forget, not that he’d want to. He does it again, and Harry whines against his mouth. “Merlin, Draco, you’re killing me.”
Ginny hugs him tightly, then pulls back to put a hand on his arm. “Go. I’ll tell everyone you weren’t feeling well.”
care. One day I’ll actually force myself into the clinic to remove it instead of wearing a Glamour all the time.
"Mm. Comfortable?"
He was still on the bed, but for once, he was wide awake. There was a book on the bedside table, but he wasn't reading at the moment. He was lying on his stomach, clutching a pillow to his chest, his head resting on his arms as he gazed into the fire glowing merrily in the fireplace.
“Grandmother Narcissa!” Teddy cuts in, sounding scandalized. “We don’t
"We're not—we didn't. But I
that made Harry jump.
“Hello, are you the one who…?”
The strop he'd thrown in response had felt right in the moment, but it's downright embarrassing looking back. Harry had finally agreed to go to the party, and sullenly told Draco he'd wear whatever he wanted if he'd just shut up about it. The ensuing fight had very nearly ended their relationship.
She beamed at him, and finally let the subject drop. "Alright, then. I wanted to tell you about something interesting I read about pack dynamics..."
“You weren’t at the time!” Draco says plaintively, begging me to understand. “You were just a trainee!”
kill you on sight."
"Okay."
has ever happened between you and Draco? Romantically?” Marc asks Harry later, when he thinks no one is listening.
"Alright. I have one in my kit downstairs."
Draco was still kissing his neck. He'd dropped down on top of him after his orgasm, but Harry didn't mind. It felt good, Draco's weight on top of him. Grounding.
"I know. I hated to A.K. him, but Parker knew the risks. If he'd been lucid he'd have begged me to do it rather than become one of
A few days later, Harry looked up when Draco walked into the kitchen. "Hey."
Harry swatted his arse playfully, then climbed out of bed. "Sorry, Drake. Just facing the facts."
He and Harry had known it was too soon to reveal their relationship, that people wouldn't be ready for it, especially so soon after he went off the Suppressants, but they hadn't had much choice when Harry's friends had come over unannounced and caught them snogging on the sofa a few weeks previous, and now there was no going back.
okay. We need to get you all some new wands."
"I don't know. She's one of your oldest friends. I should probably get to know her at some point, if we're serious about this."
Harry's answering smile is so soft and bright it's nearly blinding. He leans down to kiss Draco again. "So... Quidditch practice tomorrow? A Seeker's match?"
A woman around their age comes into view. She has chestnut brown hair curled into ringlets and warm brown eyes that light up her round face. “Oh! Hello. You must be Harry, Dudley told us you were stopping by tonight. Come in, I’ll send Violet to go and fetch him.” She smiled politely and ushered them inside. “Go get your dad, sugarplum.”
"I know it won't be easy out there, with the eyes of the entire Wizarding World on us," Harry murmurs, running a thumb over Draco's cheek. "But I do think it'll be worth it."
One of the twins, Laith, was with Mia-Rose, who, in answer to Harry's questions, revealed that she was the pack's newest member. Several months back, Laith and Mathias had found her in the forest where she had been the only survivor of a brutal werewolf attack. She was a Muggle and her family, unaware of the danger, had gone camping during the full moon. She'd been brought back to the house and nursed back to health, falling for one of her rescuers shortly after.
“You wish,” Draco laughs, sinking down and turning a laugh into an involuntary moan of pleasure. “Oh,
"I dunno...pride?" Harry grinned. "It was
“Right.”
"Oh good, Harry found Malfoy," Auror Weasley said sarcastically, pulling a face at the sight of them.
“Dad,” Harry says softly, solemnly. “He wants to call me
“Yeah, he is.”
"Tell me again how the crying is a good thing?"
Draco groaned and covered his face with his hands. "Thanks for that, Panse. See if I ever invite you over for dinner again."
circle anyway."
"Jenkins!"
“No way in hell, Gin.”
"Would he have considered a Challenge for Dominance?"
Harry grinned.
They would eat meals together, play chess or exploding snap, read, nap when Harry got tired, and, most of all, talk. More than they ever had before, and about things they'd never been bold enough to bring up in the past. Now, they talked about anything and everything: Voldemort and the war, Hogwarts and how they'd perceived each other as young teenagers, their vastly different childhoods (a subject that filled Draco with outrage and fury every single time), and, while they scoured for more information each day, about Harry's discovery about Greyback's former wolf pack.
Paul nods, and they change the subject.
She sighed. "The werewolves, Harry. Sofia and Mathias throwing themselves at you. He's not handling that as well as he'd like you to believe, I can guarantee you that."
"I love you, too."
"Nap?"
Harry guides him into the bathroom and helps him out of his clothes and into the hot water that smells strongly of peppermint.
"That one seemed especially bad," he murmured.
"Yeah," Harry responded slowly, his brow creasing as he gazed up at the ceiling, lost in thought. "Very interesting."
"Can't feel my leg," Harry mumbled, his brow creasing.
“You’re better at it than I am,” Harry chokes out, eyes wet.
Harry’s cheeky grin is back. “Scared, Malfoy?”
The red wolf leapt at the bars that confined her and bounced back, shaking her head.
"So you
Harry and Draco exchange a look. Harry’s eyes are amused, but also full of warning to keep quiet. He sounds completely serious as he turns to the Headmistress and Draco schools his own expression to match. “That is...bad.”
Draco swallows and chances a glance up. "Why?"
"Who sent you this?" He seethed.
"I know," Draco's smile doesn't flicker. "You've already apologized. Don't dwell on it, love."
She nodded. "What's happened?"
“Maybe...but being in Gryffindor like Uncle Harry with Rose and Hugo sounds pretty good, too.”
"You remember this clearly?" Grace asked.
“Yes, sir,” Harry teases, moving obediently to lie down, rolling his eyes a little.
him?" Ron said incredulously, disdainfully. "
Harry grins and turns to peck him on the cheek before spinning around on the bench, standing, and turning to leave. "I doubt it. The Owls are on a three week winning streak. Soon to be four. But I
"No, you just never cook anything," Harry laughed and pushed himself up to sit up against the headboard, then summoned his glasses to his hand and put them on, completely unaware of the effect he was having on Draco.
"Thank you." Harry leaned against Draco's chest. "Love you. Wish you were really here."
Ron's expression turned serious. "I'm with Hermione. This Lorcan guy doesn't seem like the type who would allow someone to challenge him and live. Harry could just challenge him again in the future, you know?
His head slammed against the floor at the bottom, and everything went black.

"Let me go get another plate, there's more in the kitchen."
“I need to show you something,” Harry says quickly. “I really hope I’m wrong, because I only met him the one time through the Floo, and it was really dark tonight in the Onyx Spire, so
“It’s fine,” Harry snaps, letting the door swing closed behind him without another word.
“Romania?” The one word, spoken in a barely-audible, strained voice, snaps me back. He looks like he might cry again, and it takes me a second to realize why. Charlie.
Harry closed his eyes and sighed, gently setting his hands on Draco's waist. "But—"
shut up."
Harry nods, smiling faintly at his hands.
Kasper smiled reassuringly. "He'll be fine. The fever is part of the transition from regular werewolf to Alpha. The mantle doesn't usually settle on the new Alpha for at least five or six moon cycles, but Harry's always been exceptional, hasn't he?"
"What do you want?" Harry asked shrewdly, ignoring the apology.
"Well, no," Potter was looking earnestly at him. "Honestly, I'm just a bit worried about you at the moment."
It’s exquisite; Harry’s tongue exploring his mouth, tasting of Firewhisky and himself, the delicious, fluid movements of their hips sending shocks of pleasure up his spine. The fingers of the hand not still held above Draco’s head are tangled in Harry’s messy hair, and each tug draws delicious gasps and moans from him.
"I should have talked to Ron about all of this sooner. I put it off because I knew he wouldn't take it well, but that was a mistake. I'll talk to him and sort it out between us. I'm really sorry, Drake, he shouldn't have said those things to you."
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you were doing that on purpose."
Harry had been hurting for the past few months, too. Hurting so much that he'd preferred to sleep all day than deal with how he'd been feeling.
He grins. “I know.”
"But—"
Harry groaned again and turned over, trying to recall the events of the previous night. The pain was distracting, making it difficult to think clearly. He ached right down to his bones; every muscle had been torn, every bone broken, and then all of it roughly put back together while he slept.
Harry is frozen in place on his broom, staring at him in bewildered shock.
mistake he’s made when Harry comes downstairs shirtless and in plaid pajama bottoms, hair even messier than usual, everything about him rumpled in a way that’s horribly attractive, rubbing at his eyes behind his glasses.
“I was thinking I might enjoy being a, um,” Harry bites his lower lip, "a Pediatric Healer. Is that stupid?”

"No, Apparate us up to our bed."

Draco rolled his eyes. "Now I

Draco lifts his head as I tap a finger against my neck and release the Glamour, and his tattoo reappears against my skin. He stares, eyes getting misty again, his throat working as if he’d like to speak but he just can’t.
"None of us want that, Nadine. You and Thomas are family. We can't deny what Lorcan has done for us, though. He kept us together when Fenrir left to follow Voldemort. He served well in his role as Beta when our Alpha abandoned us," Kasper contributed, "I'm not sure he would be the best Alpha now, however, I'm afraid the power has gone to his head over the years, but he must be allowed to challenge. It is his right."

Harry crouches down to pick up the remnants of their food. “I’m so happy for them,” Harry says, beaming up at Draco.
Draco’s gasping, struggling to breath. Jeremy yanks the knife out and both of Draco’s hands reach down to cover the wound, blood spilling over his hands like a crimson waterfall. He turns to see Potter, fear and panic in his eyes.
“I’m sorry,” he says to her, his eyes widening. Padma takes a deep breath.
“I’m er, actually going to dinner with Malfoy. You know, Draco Malfoy,” Harry says, feeling dumb. His friends stare at him in surprise.
“Hey,” Harry starts soothingly, reaching out to grasp Draco’s hand. “I think it’s great that you’ve got a date.”
“It’s gone 5 in the bloody morning, Harry, how have you already fucked something up?”
“They would’ve activated the Trace on it,” Draco says before falling silent.
“Is this okay?” Harry asks, looking up at him. Draco’s eyes, though still bloodshot from his tears, are wide, the pupils blown.
Of course, none of that came to fruition. It had hurt Draco, more than he’ll ever be able to admit to, when Potter spurned him on the train when they were eleven. Draco deserved it, though. He had insulted Weasley, and then told Potter more or less that he’d end up dead like his parents, hanging about with riffraff.
“You could have killed my fucking kids,” Harry growls, shaking it. “Haven’t you done enough? Haven’t you fucking done enough!” Harry screams in its face.
Hannah’s dark eyes were nearly concealed beneath her straight blonde bangs as she peered down at her tightly clasped hands.

“DON'T YOU DARE, RONALD BILIUS GRANGER-WEASLEY!” Hermione screeches, jetting past Harry in a furious blur of curls and burnt-orange and brown jumper. She jumps on Ron’s back, her arms flinging around his neck, legs following, leaving Ron no choice but to back away from the kitchen counter while using his strong, scarred arms to hold Hermione up.
Which was over four hours ago now.
Her voice shakes.

“Did Potter say something to you?” Pansy asks, her tone pressing. “Tell me now, what did that miserable bastard say?”
Harry. Loves him so much he can hardly breathe as he looks up at the man, his gaze focused to the left of Draco’s cheek, carefully holding a section of hair between his index and middle fingers as he continues to carefully cut millimetres off the edges of his strands. Draco waits patiently, body thrumming, until Harry pulls back, surveying his handiwork.
Siobhan is still dressed in her simple navy-blue robes from yesterday, but now her long black hair is pulled up into a tight bun. She’s an older woman with a soft look about her.
the creature’s voice breaks.
Potter finally turns around. There’s a lack of focus, of recognition in the depths of his green eyes. His thick eyebrows furrow, his shapely lips pressing into a fitful frown as he stares at Draco. The silence that stretches between them is anxiety-inducing, and Draco pushes the duvet back and slowly sits on the edge of the bed. The chill in the room hasn’t diminished in the slightest and he shivers again.
” Ainsworth says.
For the first time in nearly a week, the flutters stir in the cavernous cold of Draco’s stomach.
Harry then peers around the room, taking in the slightly messy chaos. It looks like Draco and Thea had one of their legendary tea parties, inviting Thea’s army of stuffed dragons, pygmy puffs, and unicorns to join them.
Potter takes a sip from his beer. “Not as often as I’d like. It’s nice for drinks after work. Sometimes going to the Leaky or Diagon Alley in general is too much. Too busy.”
He makes his way towards the lounge chair, throwing himself on it, one arm coming up to fall across his eyes as he draws in several deep, relaxing breaths. It’s quiet up here, the only sound is the flow of water coming from the small waterfall splashing into the pond.
“Oh. Ginny and I wanted different things,” Potter starts with a small frown. “She wanted to move to Wales permanently and I wanted to stay here and join the Aurors, so we decided to end things. It was for the best. I mean, we still love each other, but we now know that we weren’t made for each other.”
? You’re wrong, you are what you are, Harry,” Smith says cryptically, a knowing smile on his face.
Draco perches himself on one of Pansy’s tall wooden stools. “Potter smiled at me this morning.”

“Well. What else can I do?” Potter asks.
“I don’t know. I mean, how seriously should we take a five-year-old?”
“—and we love you so much, Draco. I do.
As Draco stands nearly shoulder to shoulder with Harry on the dais, he desperately wishes he could hold Harry’s hand. He wants to feel his warm calloused palm against his softer one. He wants to graze his thumb across the back of his knuckles before lifting his hand up and peppering soft kisses across them. He wants, wants, and wants.
Harry’s eyes narrow. “How could you think that about me? Do you think any of the shit I deal with is
“She definitely owns some blood diamonds,” Theo answers.
“Of course,” he says, wrapping his arms around Draco once more. He leans in to kiss his cheek again, but misses and instead accidentally lands on the corner of his mouth before quickly pulling back. After a beat, Draco meets his gaze, but this time his eyes are carefully searching Harry’s face. A familiar flare of heat spirals up Harry’s spine and tightens in his stomach as his eyes catches on Draco’s pink, cupid bow shaped lips, swollen from biting them and wet from his tears. He meets Draco’s eyes once more and only a second flies by before he realises what’s about to happen.
“Scotty here has already provided you with a timeline,” Marcus continues, his face manic. “I want that fucking folder back by then, or I’ll come for you, Draco. And
The progression of announcing each débutante, her escort, and her biography is tedious and Draco finds that he has to blink rapidly to keep from nodding off. He’s only startled from his drowsy demeanour when his mother clears her throat.
Draco is filled with a giddy excitement at the very thought. As they finally enter the Death Chamber, he crosses his arms against his chest as he tilts his head up to look upon the dais in the middle of the room. He can’t help but be in awe of Granger’s intelligence.
“Stop telling me to relax,” Draco barks, running a hand through his hair. He rolls his neck. As he does this, he’s annoyed to be on the receiving of a wry grin from Potter.
He can sense that there’s something lurking beyond the surface of 'cheerful war-hero Harry Potter' that’s frightening and monstrous. Perhaps even untrustworthy, and that’s saying a lot coming from someone like him. On one hand, Draco seriously, truly, wants nothing to do with the man or whatever antics he’s involved in. On the other, he wonders what it would be like to have Potter on top of him, kissing him, fucking him...
Draco squeezes his eyes shut. Holds his breath, fingers pressing deeply into his chest.
!” He tosses the book onto the shelf before pointing at it. “You’ll fight over this fucking book just because. I mean it. Put your name in it, on all your separate belongings, otherwise you’ll be getting an owl in the middle of the night a week after you break up asking whether or not you’re holding his paintbrushes hostage!” Harry screams.
“I have a neighbour a few floors down that suffers with debilitating arthritis. She used to take her cat, Jazzy, for walks around the courtyard, but has been unable to for a few months now. So, when I can, I take him for walks and run small errands for her.”
“Potter and I,” Draco says, drawing in a shaky breath, “are just at odds with one another. I told you I’m on the case for the break-ins. Everything has been fine thus far, but Potter is—”
“Piss off, Potter,” Malfoy growls. “I don’t owe you anything for pulling your self-indulgent Saviour bollocks. As far as I’m concerned, this day never happened. Go save someone else.” Malfoy then turns to face the wall, exposing his back to Harry in an angry huff. A part of him feels pleased that Malfoy is speaking to him in such a dismissive way now— not quite as off-kilter as he was previously led to believe.
Draco can see Pansy stiffen. “Never mind what you have to live with. The most important person to me nearly died. He nearly
The next few minutes are a terrifying frenzy of chaos.
“Oh hell,” Draco says, setting his glass down and staring at Hermione, both eyebrows shooting up to his hairline. Harry hasn’t been able to really look directly at Draco at all tonight, what with his hair down about his shoulders and his pale face prettily flushed from the alcohol. It’s too much, too beautiful, too painful. It’s a bit like staring into the sun. “You’re not drinking, you’ve been going to the loo like crazy, and your breasts look bigger.”
