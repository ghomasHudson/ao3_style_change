The last trial we saw was for four people. When they were brought in Draco told me the woman was his aunt, his mother’s sister. And that one of the men was her husband. They were sentenced for torturing Frank Longbottom and his wife. Draco and I looked at each other and mentioned Neville at the same time. He was raised by his grandmother because of what Draco’s aunt did to his parents. Draco feels bad about this, I know. He says it’s fine, but he started to be kinder to Neville ever since we saw the memory of his aunt’s trail.
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought up the Hogsmeade weekends,” Neville says.
The next morning Draco was already up and out in the Great Hall having breakfast by the time I got out of bed. I dressed quickly and went to find him. He was sitting with Pansy and Daphne on either side of him like he was making sure I couldn’t sit down next to him. I walked up to him and greeted him, but he didn’t respond at all, didn’t even look at me. I begged him to please talk to me, but he wouldn’t. Nott was grinning on the other side of the table. He most think it’s really funny that Draco is ignoring me. When it was clear he wouldn’t speak to me I just walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to Hermione to have my breakfast.
Love you, and I’m sorry I messed everything up,
Harry raises his eyebrows. “What do you mean?” he asks. “Placing the traps, or going after Pettigrew?”
Morning comes too soon. Breakfast is a silent affair. Aunt Bella watches every move Draco makes. Draco is sure she doesn’t believe Draco killed Harry. He wouldn’t believe it either. It’s so unlikely. Lucius is different. He’s never been this happy for Draco to be home from school. For once there are no questions about house points, the Quidditch cup or scrawls about the fact that Granger gets higher grades than him. No, only praise comes from Lucius’ lips. Draco is again the best son in the world. The whole conversation of last Easter forgotten. No more threats of disowning Draco ring through the halls of Malfoy Manor.
After they lay on the floor in the living room, their hands linked and one of the blankets that never leaves the sofa on top of them to make sure they stay warm.
Voldemort summoned his followers by touching the Dark Mark on Wormtail’s arm. It took some time for them to arrive, and Voldemort started talking to me like I was his friend. He told me he killed his own father. Who could even do that? Kill the man that put you on this world?
And with that Ginny is gone. Hermione has opened her book again and Neville’s focus is back on his chess game. Only Ron stares at Harry a little longer.
“I guessed that, as he’s part of the Defence Against the Dark Arts class,” Harry says. He takes another look and then walks back to his seat. He scrapes his throat. “I wanted to ask you something,” he says.
After that I quickly slid into class, only to have Nott make some stupid comment on how I already needed extra help from the professors. And it didn’t stop there, Nott and Crabbe have been making nasty comments all week about how professor Lockhart favours me, that he likes me. They even asked when the wedding would be. And all the time Draco just stands there and acts like nothing is happening. At least Hermione, Ron, Neville and Blaise all talk back to them, telling them to shut their mouths. Even I did a couple of times. But I’m scared they are going to hurt me again, dad. Just like last year. Now that Draco is not looking out for me anymore I’ll be a target again. I’m sure of it. I don’t want to hide bruises all the time and look over my shoulder every time I walk somewhere alone, just to make sure they won’t hex me.
“Nothing, Harry,” Neville says. “But Hermione does have a point. We don’t know Malfoy. And Remus promised he would help. We can let him deal with it. We’ve got enough on our plate as it is.”
We have a plan. Malfoy is going to teach me some spells that will help me defend myself when they attack me again and some spells I can use to get back at them. I’m not sure about attacking them, but Malfoy says I need to show them that I will stick up for myself, that it is the only way to make them stop. And maybe he’s right, so I will learn the jinxes and see if I’ll use them when the time is there.
Third-year starts and brings with it the Dementors, who seem to affect Harry more than any other student. And who is this Sirius Black that has escaped from Azkaban? Harry and Draco try to figure it out in the little free time they have next to all their extra classes, Quidditch training and Harry's therapy sessions.
Monday 27 December 1993
Hermione nods and then gets up to make more tea.
The landlord of our campsite was a muggle and was really confused about all the crazy people that had pre-booked and looked like crazy people that kept showing up. Mr Tonks had a nice chat with him. Being Muggle-born, he was able to settle the man a little and he showed us on a little map where our site was. The entire field was filled with tents, some of them looked muggle, but a lot of them didn’t. Our spot was at the edge of the wood at the end of the field. With the guidance of Mr Tonks, we set up two small tents. One for Tonks and her father, and one for Sirius, Remus, Draco and I. The tent looked very small from the outside, but once you would get in it was pretty large. It had two bedrooms, both with bunk beds. Sirius told us we could have one just for the two of us, as long as we promised to keep our hands to ourselves.
“You won’t be helping him by making him hate you,” Hermione says. And Harry knows she’s right. That doesn’t mean Harry is just going to give up on being Malfoy’s friend. He’s going to help that boy to become less lonely. Even if it’s the last thing he does.
Professor Snape has been in a foul mood, we think it’s because of Neville his Bogart taking Snape’s shape and then getting dressed in Neville’s grandmother's clothes. The story has been circling the castle all month. And whenever anyone in his vicinity says Professor Lupin’s name Snape his eyes flash menacingly at them. I feel sorry for the Gryffindors in his class. Professor Snape is ducking them points all the time. I’m glad I have Draco helping me with my potions and all, otherwise, I’m sure he would be yelling at me all the time too. Neville is really having a hard time.
“Courting, Potter, that’s what I’m on about,” Zabini snaps.
A familiar voice snaps Harry out of his thoughts. Malfoy walks by with Parkinson on his arm. Harry follows him with his eyes until he’s out of sight. He looks good in his black velvet dress robes and his hair falling over the high collar. He’s talking to Parkinson who laughs and Harry wants to punch her. She’s so annoying. The perfect little pureblood bride for Malfoy.
Remus has a point. Harry will admit that. But it’s all so unfair. Malfoy is smart. And nobody gets to see it. Just because his father doesn’t want him to be deaf.
Classes are also hard. It seems like everything I learnt last year has somehow leaked out my head during the summer. We had to turn a beetle into a button during Transfiguration, but I just couldn’t. Ron is also struggling, but that is more because his wand snapped when we crashed the car than his inability to do magic.
Hermione blushes and then leans against Harry. Harry pulls her arm in his and they continue to walk.
“What deal?” Hermione asks.
“Thank you,” Harry whispers. He’d expected Neville to fight him on this, maybe even say he should not give up on Draco. Just as their dad did. But Neville seems to understand that Harry needs this, to forget about his heartbreak for just a little. Maybe forget about Draco altogether during the summer and start fresh when September comes around the corner again. There are sure to be more gay students at Hogwarts. And maybe Harry can fall in love with one of them. And then he will forget all about Draco and how he was the first person to break Harry’s heart.
of September to go to my new school. I’ll tell you all about it when I get there.
Draco nods and turns his focus back to his tea. The cup warms his hands. It reminds him of the cups of tea his mother used to make when he was little. She would always say that a good cup of tea makes everything better. He stopped believing that during the war, when nothing could make things better, not even a cup of tea. When the only thing Draco could do was get high so he would forget. The tea also does nothing for the pain he feels right now. It doesn’t magically heal the hole that has formed in his heart.
“He attacked Neville?” Harry shouts at them.
“Okay,” Harry says. The smile on his face wavers, but he doesn’t say anything else.
Mr Malfoy didn’t get the change to respond to Draco because a stooping man had appeared behind the counter and he focused his attention on him. I couldn’t look away from Draco, wondering why he acted so different from what I’m used to. I know he was worried about not coming first in our class, but surely his father would not buy him a new broom if he was still upset about that, would he?
My first port of call was – of course – to panic. Had one of his clients given him a hard time? I told Draco that we needn’t stay all night at The Burrow if he was feeling poorly, but he only protested at my fussing.
I really ought to stop thinking about social injustice.
“A wager on what? On who of us gets him?” Harry guesses.
“Your company tonight. I wouldn’t have thought that you were so close.”
Anxiously, Draco closed his hands around the glass, waiting for the inevitable angry outburst on Harry’s part.
It’d been sex, bad sex, and nothing more.
Potter said that he hadn’t ever known somebody as confident about sex as I am. He told me that Muggles have this thing called sex therapy, and I snorted at the idea that wizarding kind hadn’t come up with something like that.
Phoenix isn’t one of the famous brand names – we’ll never compete internationally with Cleansweep or Firebolt – but we do right for ourselves. Profits have risen every single year that I’ve worked there. Our brooms are far sportier than the big brand's models, lighter too, which makes them more manoeuvrable on the Quidditch pitch. I’m looking forward to Christmas. That’s when we make most of our yearly Galleons. Every young wix wants a smashing new broomstick in their stocking.
Let’s see how docile Potter can be.
Harry agrees and continues scrutinising the antique, following Draco’s instructions to make himself familiar with it before he tries even one spell on it.
“It’s stigmatised,” Draco agrees, pensive. Then his head perks up. “But I think I’ve seen Amanda Parker tonight.”
Harry takes a shaky little breath, cheeks burning with embarrassment. But before he can answer, both Hermione and Teddy break out in a little amused laugh. “You call each other by your last names?” Hermione asks. Next to Harry, Draco wears a pleased smile.
“The thing is that I had a client in October who must’ve been magic. And the night we spent together- Potter, I’m pregnant. Twelve weeks pregnant.”
“Just look at it first.”
“Die of starvation more like!” Harry groused, drinking a mouthful of tea. He winced. It had long ago gone cold, so he warmed it back up with a tap of his wand before speaking again. He leant back in his chair. “Ron said that you’d have to be Merlin himself to get a reservation. He wanted to take ‘Mione for her birthday, but all he got was a big fat nope. It’s booked up for months.”
Draco sighed and huffed out a defeated breath. He’d already lied today, and he wasn’t about to bury himself further in the mire. Malfoys were many rotten things, but they were, at the very least, honourable.
Draco didn’t think that he would.
Maybe I’d been too prissy, too prudish. Maybe the answer to my dry spell wasn’t another awkward dinner date in Diagon Alley with some fawning boy looking for a good anecdote to share with his mates. Maybe, just this once, I could treat myself. After all, I’ve got enough gold in my vaults to buy any commodity I fancy. I'm blessed with good fortune.
“You’re going?” Malfoy asks, startled, his cup rattling on the saucer. He gets up as well, and Harry half-remembers him, standing up after being sat in the middle of the room for hours on end, head bowed and shoulder slouched, but when he stood, there was an urgency about him. “
that this-“ Draco gestures between them. “This is just
“Fuck you,” Harry interrupts him.
When they are in the hallway, Draco asks, “Is that everything? Everything you had with you?” his voice tight, eyes on the two big travel bags Harry dropped there. Harry shrugs and nods, and Draco is very quiet for a moment. His arms are wrapped around Harry when he murmurs, “I can’t believe my luck. That you really want to stay here with me.”
Everything is orange and too hot. Fiendfyre or perhaps a curse? It’s not fair that he has to go through this again, he doesn’t want to. He’s going to fail this time, and he wonders whether he can just pretend that everything worked out fine. Dumbledore will see right through his lie, he supposes, but it’ll give him time. Time to get everything right.
It’s not fair. How ironic things always turn out to be. As I write that I’m feeling a sense of absurd fatalism. But it’s just so bloody ironic that I’m pregnant with the baby of the person whom I had a stupid pash on since forever and whom I grew to love. And that we fell for each other so hard that it felt inevitable. Being with him felt familiar and new all at once. And all of it was only a pretence, only some intrigue, spun by the one single bloke who held up my faith in humanity.
His new life as a Wizengamot court reporter began that same afternoon. Every day was as humdrum, and foreseeable as the one before it, and that suited Draco perfectly. Each day was a parade of the same petty crimes and misdemeanours.
It felt surprisingly good. I admit, I felt like a right twink with the older man’s arms around my waist. His brown eyes were heavy-lidded as his eyes flickered down to my lips. Honestly? I wanted to kiss him. I really should not think that, but the conversation flew well, the dancing felt nice. And I will write this down once again for myself: I wanted to kiss James, and it had nothing to do with the fact that he was about to pay me the other half of the five grand in the morning.
That’s what they don’t tell you about saving the world when you’re just a kid. Men won’t sleep with you because you’re you. They’ll sleep with you because you’re Harry Potter. The real bloke, with a too-hairy chest, and a too-flabby belly and a cock that is bang on average-sized is an inevitable disappointment. Men like the idea of the hero. The real Harry Potter is fairly pathetic in comparison to the despot-slaying legend the
An hour ago, I’d been cheerfully going about my day. Now Draco was in a St Mungo’s bed, and everything,
“You’re a very mysterious man.”
“What are you on about, Potter?” Draco asks while some wand movements follow to prepare their plates. “I also brought this lager. It’s locally brewed, and I thought you might like it. I’ll even accept the humiliation of drinking something that has a big, fat red lion plastered across the tag. The owner—and brewer—is such a Gryffindor, it’s like she never really left Hogwarts.”
Harry knows that. He doesn’t tell him, but says, “You never had it in you to hurt me.”
He nods, blinking for a moment too long, nostrils flaring as he expels a breath. I lean in close to his face, press gentle lips to the troubled furrow between his brows, then the soft of his cheek, the velvet of his lips. Our skin connects, reluctant to let go as we part, and the uncorked phial is almost forgotten at the moment, only returns when I tighten my grip around it in an attempt to calm the pleasure our touch gives me.
After a brief silence, Tarquin, still busy with pressing his shirt, says, “You’re cute, Pots.”
“Draco, it’s alright.” He ponders whether he can tell Draco about the morphine he’s taking—not injecting!—and thinks, what the fuck, why not. Draco listens intently when Harry talks about how much easier his days start on two pills, and how he gets the stuff from a Muggle apothecary, copying prescriptions with as little as a tap of his wand and, when in doubt, using a quick charm that makes the pharmacist just a  little more trusting. The only thing he avoids mentioning is how unexpectedly hard the two weeks in summer had been that he spent tossing and turning in bed, sweaty and quivering and nauseous like he's never been before in his life.
Too much beer and too little water later, Harry’s body still feels ecstatic and restless with energy and raw magic, so raw that he’s surprised that no one notices that there is something is odd about his presence. But then the bloke from earlier is gone and there’s Tarquin, only Tarquin, who looks at him with beautiful brown eyes. He’s pushing Harry against the wall for a fierce kiss, he’s pacing the bedroom, his hands all over himself, grimacing, and groaning.
I felt sweaty all over. It was a warm day, and we hadn’t administered any Cooling Charms to the sheets yet, but the smells of sex and Harry filling the room only aroused me more. “Never stop,” I told him, and the plea made his frantic movements slow down a bit, made him shove his prick all the way before he pulled far out again. I craned my neck to be able to kiss him, tongues connecting in an idle play.
“Like for us,” Tarquin goes on, still catching his breath. “Like- Tonight was just . . . so good. Absolutely evocative—inspiring!” Harry agrees, recalling the unexpectedly soft vocals, a crescendo of sounds that carried him away, eyes glued to the stage of a few long-haired blokes, powering their souls into distorted guitars, choir-like harmonies alternating with heart-clenching screams.
“Hundred percent.”
With a snicker, Carol holds her hand in front of her mouth while she chews and swallows. “And here I was, thinking you were going to say what a smart-mouthed, desirable-looking lady I am.”
,” he says, and Harry obeys. Draco angles for his wand and casts spells that he saw last  over a decade ago. He feels Draco’s protective magic rush over his prick in a tingly swirl, followed by Draco’s fingers massaging his length in slow, glorious strokes, palming his head and going down all the way to his balls with every movement.
Harry wakes, still feeling all the eyes on him, endless shades of blues and browns and now grey too. Before he does anything else, he takes two morphine in the hopes of napping until they take.
For a moment I stood stock still, stunned out of my skin, but then I got a hold of myself. This was the day we’d been waiting for, and I rushed over to Draco’s side, rubbing the base of his back, and helping him to breathe through it.
, just below his navel and Draco gasped at the sensation, stunned by the force behind it. His hands flew to his middle and then the bump kicked him again.
We walked into the waiting room, hand in hand, and I checked the pair of us in while Draco found us a pair of seats that were beside each other. It was the oddest feeling, diary, to be surrounded by all those other expectant parents. I felt a few inquisitive eyes rake over the pair of us, but nobody spoke. Whispers will start though, and they’ll grow into rumours. I don’t care though. I’m not ashamed of Draco and if he lets me be part of the plum's life then I’ll be honoured.
“They’re fine,” the Healer cut in. “Their heartbeat is stable and they’re moving exactly as I’d wish for them too. We’ve replenished Mr Malfoy’s magic artificially and given him a sleeping potion to help him rest. As you can imagine, he was very upset, and we needed to get his blood pressure under control. He’s unconscious at the moment and will remain so for the next few hours.” The Healer paused, frowning into the middle distance. “I don’t know if you’re aware, but Mr Malfoy wrote your name as his next of kin in his medical notes, which means I can be frank with you about his condition. I’m afraid this is a very serious matter. The file says that the father of the baby is an unknown person. Do you have any clue whatsoever whom it might be? A mutual friend, or-“
Then I’m alone. So alone. Every day. I look out the window because I can’t abide the sight of the wet spot on the ceiling, the traces that the former tenant has left in the parquet-mocking linoleum for me to sneer at, and I phantasise about evenings a decade ago, a life I once led, of Harry because there’s no one else-
Harry takes a breath. “I’ll miss you.”
Harry folds the note and carefully shoves it back into the envelope. Back into the box. He thinks of putting it back into the back, but he leaves it on the nightstand on his side of the bed.
Draco muses for a moment. "None that I'm aware of."
Nobody spoke to him, but that was fine. That only meant he didn’t have to speak in return. He spent his lunchtimes in the Wizengamot law library, staring blankly at his notes and trying his hardest not to think.
A sting behind his eyes, and a lump in his throat. “But they are here
Missing someone
“That’s changing. Ever since the logistics got better, not everyone does all their shopping in Diagon, dad.”
Draco’s lithe, pale body is revealed between the black of his shirt. And now, for the first time, Harry really looks. He runs his fingers along the most prominent scar, listening to the way Draco’s breath hitches.
, Harry wants to say for a moment, but he thinks better of it. Perhaps Draco wants to cry. Perhaps he needs to cry, and that’s fine. That’s just fine.
The thrill of a familiar nervousness blooms in Harry’s chest, both familiar because it’s Draco Malfoy, but mainly because there are enough cases in which it is hard to figure out if a bloke is into men or not. Luckily, Harry hardly ever had any bad experiences with men who were not into other men at all, but sometimes it’s hard to read the signs especially with this visceral euphoria he’s feeling which, as he well knows, comes from the coke and the alcohol.
Fitzgerald got to leave, got to begin afresh, but Draco had to stay. He had to live with the reality of what had happened to him. His words hadn’t been enough. If you consent enough times, you weren’t allowed to say no, not ever again. If you’ve fucked enough men, then one more didn't matter. You were fair game.
The tendons in Draco’s throat work below his thin, smooth skin.
John’s eyebrows rise towards his hairline. “At the Courtauld Institute?”
Fitzgerald hadn’t even bothered to use a condom. The room was filled with the musty, detergent-like stink of cum. It turned Draco’s stomach. Usually he adored the scent of another man, but today it was repugnant.
To say Harry was surprised when he discovered Draco sat on their bed one afternoon, cross-legged and pensive when he was supposed to be over at Andi’s house picking strawberries with Teddy and Daisy would be quite an understatement.
When they run into each other the second time, Harry has a Muggle mobile, and the first thing he does is exchange numbers with John. Then they try to find beanie-bloke somewhere close to the bar. They leave the ear-splitting dance floor to stand in the hallway close to the cloakroom where it’s easier to understand each other. They are trying to be fugitive with their smokes, and the hip flask beanie-bloke—Tarquin—bootlegged into the club. On that night, Harry learns that his last blackout wasn’t only from too much alcohol, but rather from mixing said alcohol with mollies. Harry concludes that this must be some kind of drug, but he has no clue about what they might consist of.
when you told him I’d invited him for dinner?”
With the next
,” Draco supplies through gritted teeth in the same moment that Harry starts explaining that they would like to leave with the magic, that it’s not dangerous for anyone, and that they will be gone within the blink of an eye.
Also, I just chatted with Kayden again, and he agreed with everything I suggested. Meeting him thrice a week now at the Dalston Inn for as long as I’m up for work before the due date. Last time we met, he wanted to know how I'd gotten myself in my condition, but he was even more turned on when I arched an eyebrow at him and retorted, “And why again would I share my secrets with a punter?” He likes me a bit bratty. And he loves all the filthy dirty talk. It’s rather amusing how he keeps on grunting out things like “whore” and “slut”, but once we’re done, he insists on a few minutes of cuddling and is back to being a well-mannered man who always gives me dad vibes.
at me.”
What I’m going to do, in order to plan exactly what I’m going to do – if anything – about the new little person growing inside of Draco is start from the beginning. Not
couldn’t help him. The bump would still be there, growing regardless.
That was when Draco knew for sure.
Pansy raised a perfect eyebrow, and sat forward in her seat. “And that, by itself, hardly warrants the
of you. You don’t have to do this – any of this – on your own. I believe you, and I believe in you. You’re brilliant, and funny, and clever, and I refuse to believe this is going to be the defining moment of your life, Draco.”
“Harry,” Draco repeated, knowing that he sounded rather foolish but unable to help himself. In his defence, he had drunk two shots of whisky on an empty belly.
“Because of skill building and inclusion,” Hermione answers.
Harry considers asking whether he could read it—sometimes Tarquin shares his poetry with him, but more often he rereads his writing when he's down from his trip and he tears everything apart, burning the scraps to ashes afterwards—but Harry finds that he isn't in the mood for reading a cryptic succession of words that may or may not bear sensical meaning if strung together.
“I’m not so sure,” George says. “It’s the same cock-up with many joke items. I tried ordering from China once. Was a good deal
Harry starts glaring at him, but he feels his expression grow incredulous. “What?”
As I watched, the swelling rose and fell with Draco’s breathing, and I remembered myself. Gently, I covered Draco with the blanket, hardly daring to breathe myself. Draco was pregnant, and there was more than a good chance that I’d fathered his baby.
There were other places, other men, that he could Firecall and fuck, but right now Draco wanted nothing more than to go home. Strip off, have a shower and take a sleeping elixir. He wanted to be very far away from Fitzgerald.
“You’ve got a gorgeous cock Stuart,” Draco said, trying to inject a bit of erotic tension into their liaison. “Fancy letting me go down on you?”
“Potter?”
” All laughter dropped from Harry’s face then because it was beautiful. Draco told him, very proudly, that he just cited Pride and Prejudice to him, and Harry kissed him until they both were completely out of breath before he said, “
“Well, I should . . . you know.” Harry draws his wand and performs the Transfiguration he’d so dutifully perfected before taking heroin for the first time—well, before
“You want me to shave?” Harry asks, incredulous.
Draco braced his back against the wet wall of shower tiles. I wouldn’t ever let him fall, but it was still better to be safe. I pressed an ardent kiss onto the stretch mark. “Exquisite,” I complimented, my fingertips dipping eagerly into Draco’s thighs.
of it, as is always the case with magical homes. There are charms embedded into the very foundation of the house, into the walls and the pipes, into the curtains and the furniture. “The Wards are very strong,” Harry points out, concentrating on the long-forgotten magic he learnt during his Auror training.
There’s a book on Muggle technology that I know Arthur would love for Christmas, and they’ve promised me that they’d hold onto a copy for me when it arrives. Fifteen minutes away from the shop floor will do me the world of good too. Still, I shouldn’t complain. Every time we sell another broomstick, that's another pile of Galleons in our till.
It was Muggle, one of Teddy’s hand-downs with illustrations of different types of vehicles. She looked into the opened book, studying the thick cardboard page intently, before she turned around and toddled over to her dad, bright eyes still glued on the page. She fell along the way, causing Draco to jolt, but Daisy was completely unimpressed by his panic, and just got back up to continue the last steps of her little journey.
a gossip rag,” Harry says, carding his hands through Draco’s hair. “If anything, I’m the one who sullies you. Your magic is anything but weak, and . . . And they should have written
Draco’s eyes are on him, appraising. Harry takes the water bottle from where it’s cradled in Draco’s lap.
“Draco, fuck,” Potter whined, breathless. His prick was throbbing, his hips coming off the bed to meet me halfway. “You’re beautiful. So big with our baby and so gorgeous.” His hands were at my nipples, pinching gently as he watched my reaction closely. I always see it in his face, how perfectly aware he is of my pleasure and sensitivity.
Harry holds his breath, feeling odd and sad.
Suddenly Harry questions whether getting drugged in an ex-Death Eater’s home was a safe, wise thing to do and not completely insane. But he tries to calm his speeding heart.
Harry didn’t seem frightened in the least by Draco’s bravado, and his expression didn’t change an iota. He slid his wand out from the pocket in his trousers, and took a single step forward.
What I came into was the bloke holding up a bundle of money. “This,” he said, counting a whole grand, laying the banknotes out on the rumpled sheets. “If you cancel all your plans and stay the night. Morning sex and shower sex if that’s alright with you.”
“Salazar’s sake,
I’d have one night, and one night alone. After all, I’m not the sort of wizard that buys sex. This would be a one-off, an indulgence. A risqué memory to look back on when I’m old and decrepit. First, I made the decision that I’d pay lavishly: I didn’t want my rent boy to think me miserly. Secondly, I made the decision that I wanted my boy for the whole of the night: I didn’t want to rush proceedings and have him peering discreetly at his watch.
“You’re a bloody mess, Potter.” The drawl is as unnervingly laconic and as coolly spoken as one might imagine.
Right at that moment, I wondered what his life might possibly be like. Whether he was lonely and doesn’t have a single soul holding his hand from time to time. Rather disconcerting thoughts, when I consider how my usual hook-ups go. Usually it's a little chat about what they like, what I won’t do, and two orgasms later they are gone. Salazar, I’ve even mentally made a shopping list several times while letting a bloke have at me.
Harry’s heartbeat quickens when he feels the tears well in his eyes. He rubs his face, his cheeks numb from too much wine. But the moment he meets his own eyes in the mirror, the feeling of loneliness and disappointment and
“Harry,” Draco says, sincere. “Do you want me to leave my shirt on?”
“To me it rather looks like you’re running from it.”
They collapse next to each other on the bed with Harry being the one panting away. When they look at each other, they both can’t help a grin. Harry feels like he’s dissolving in satisfaction. Right when he feels exhaustion and the cosy warmth take over him, the aftershocks from the coke faintly wearing off, Harry finds himself feeling out for the presence next to him with searching fingers, blinking as though to make sure Draco isn’t a dream.
He vomits, the half-digested, acidic remnants of a sour-sweet cocktail and bile splatter down into the toilet. The sound and view of it makes him retch again; coughing and gasping for air around his contracting throat. When he rubs the back of his hand over his mouth, feeling slack and chilly with cold sweat, the woman is still standing there, staring at him with a deadly pallor in her face and hazy doe-eyes.
“Only read the Muggle news,” Harry replies, half-lying because he barely consumes any news ever. But now that Malfoy mentions it, he remembers Malfoy was said to have left Britain after his parents were imprisoned. He himself was pardoned on most of the charges. How odd it had felt to see Draco Malfoy in the Wizengamot chambers back then, reliving the day Harry was brought into the Manor by Snatchers, reliving the day of the battle, and hearing Malfoy’s meek voice explain his supposedly harmless intentions. Harry had felt nothing but pity for him. He didn’t even care if his words were truthful or not. He just wanted this farce to stop, to release him from Malfoy’s Pensieve memories, projected into the room for everyone to see, meticulously compared to Harry’s, to Ron’s, to Hermione’s, to Goyle’s; and, what the fuck, just release Malfoy too. Harry didn’t care.
I also read so many lovely words written about me. Sweet Circe, he’s in love with me. Not that I didn’t believe it when he told me, but I read it from his words just as much as I see it in his eyes. And it didn’t even start because he knew we’d have a baby, it started even earlier and just sort of ten-folded when he knew.
Potter liked that little metaphor, and he said how weird it is that feelings get so complicated when it comes to sex. “I know what you mean,” he told me. “But I can’t picture how it’s different when it’s not about a smile but about something as intimate as sex.”
“Does this hurt?” Harry asks. His hand rests on Draco’s hot, goose-bumped skin right below his chest where a scar crosses his pebbled nipple. The areola below the nipple isn’t as clearly defined as in the other parts but patched with white scar tissue that’s crossed with the pink curse scar.
Their voices rise into a heated discussion.
There’s astonished silence. The woman finds her husband’s gaze for a moment, looking for a sign of trustworthiness towards the two strangers. The feeling tastes like bile in Draco’s throat, that estrangement and fear that is not only directed at himself but includes Potter as well. Petunia Dursley descents the stairs until she’s standing right before Potter. A storm of emotions patters down on the two of them, too chaotic to be distinguishable. A swirl of disappointment, impotent anger, fear, guilt, and heart-wrenching pleas, only for what, Draco doesn’t know.
what? And who?” Harry is curious despite himself. He didn’t know how much he wanted to think, to talk about all of this.
Draco was less lucky than me. I was already an orphan, but for all intents and purposes, Draco became one after the war. Both his parents were given long prison sentences. The boy who, once upon a time, had everything now had to fend for himself.
Thin morning light floods the room. A kitchen gleaming with polished woods and stone, cleaned to perfection. The scent is nothing like ordinary
“I mean it, I’m not here,” he gestures, including the bar and her and himself, struggling with words, “because of
Harry shifted his hands swiftly and dropped Draco like he was aflame. He took two steps backwards and raised his hands up in a gesture of sincerity. Draco narrowed his eyes, assessing the threat.
He felt traitorous tears leak as the spell was cast, and he watched the glittering magic coalesce into the form of a baby. Draco saw tiny limbs wiggling and he saw their face in profile. The bump existed, and they would be born in just over eight week’s time.
“And I you,” Harry answered. Part of him wished to take Draco’s hands in his own, but he didn’t. Instead, he kept his hands clasped behind his back. His muscles were straining when Draco’s hands explored lower and lower, and Harry almost felt ashamed when his prick reacted to the touch. And to the sight of Draco. His shirt started to soak where the water ran up his arm. His bare feet. And his skinny jeans, dark, saturated with water.
But he ploughs on, and he follows the agenda that he’s planned out in his head and shared with Draco so that he would remind him of it and hold him to it.
“You’re not really an art student, are you?” Tarquin asks at some point.
Harry has been outside the wizarding world for long enough to be startled when a gathering of ghosts soar up the hill towards them, and he’s startled enough to frantically shove his hand into his robes for his wand, but Draco stops him from actually drawing it. He rubs his thumb over the inside of Harry’s wrist before he lets go of Harry’s hand again, and Harry feels a bit insecure about the customs of showing their affection in public, wondering whether the wizarding world has a problem with same sex couples because, as far as Harry can remember, he’s never seen any.
Nick’s eyes are glued to the television until he notices Harry watching him. "Something the matter, mate?" he says with feigned provocation, squaring his chest and nodding his chin at Harry, an amused glint in his eyes.
On the bright side, reading Harry’s words has opened my eyes. I did assume that Harry had some issues with his self-esteem but reading all these thoughts… Especially about the bloke he Polyjuiced himself into.
His hands probed lower, and he squeezed the bulge in my trousers, looking up as though he was waiting for my consent. I answered by undoing my fly and shoving my clothes down.
“Watch it, mate,” Harry says. “Far as I know, homophobia is quite out of fashion,
There was nothing for it. Draco had to leave, and he had to leave now. The pair had him backed into a corner.
The bump made their arrival in the world during their early hours of the fourteenth of April. She was seven pounds in weight, as bald as a bludger and she wailed loudly, outraged at having to leave the only home that she’d ever known. With a swish of their wand, the Mediwizard cast a collection of protective spells over the tiny witch, and he placed her on Draco’s chest. As soon as she heard Draco’s familiar heartbeat, her tears ceased.
“We both knew what bloody happened. Read a history book if you like,” Harry retorts with an eye roll.
It wouldn’t ever happen, not if Draco lived to be a million.
Draco’s childhood bedroom is huge. There’s a four-poster against a highlighted wall with a dark-green silken tapestry, and a fireplace with a huge settee in front of it. A velvet chair, a
,” said Draco to Harry’s observations, and Harry couldn’t help the urge to lie closer to him, to feel his firm body against his own. “
Or perhaps Potter would have preferred to keep on kissing me instead of watching the spectacle above. I would have parted my lips and licked into his mouth to taste him and his warmth. He would’ve made a soft little sound – I’m sure of it, he’s always humming and oh’ing – and he’d melted into my touch.
That was the last that Draco mentioned feeling unwell. Before much longer, the colour had returned to Draco’s cheeks, the amusement returned to his voice, and the Butterbeer had been replaced with fruit punch. After an hour or so, I nipped to the loo and, as I made my way back to Draco, I was collared by Tony Goldstein. The boring git talked my ear off for ages, reminiscing about the old DA days before I could extract myself.
So far they have restored the kitchen, the living quarters Draco used to occupy with his parents two decades before, and the library with the attached study. Right next to the broad armchair in the study where Harry already plans on spending wonderful afternoons with a book in his lap, lives his grandmother’s phoenix perch on an ebony
I digress.
“Harry,” Draco interrupted him, caressing his head and his cheek. “You never pressured me. I know that, and I want to be intimate with you. It’s just a question of how. I felt like a kid-free afternoon would be a good moment to talk or, you know,
“At that hotel where I found you.”
Draco ripped the page in his haste to close the paper. His heart was skittering and racing, and all the air rushed from his lungs. The restaurant seemed to tilt, and his vision was blurry. Harry slid into the booth beside him. Draco saw the look of concern – the look of panic – that crossed his face.
I know I’m a bit frustrating sometimes – I tiptoe around Draco like the wizard is made of
?” and Harry explains about the seventh Horcrux.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees. “Yeah, it feels like you can’t be in on the joke if you
“Thus I bought this place-” Draco gestures to the room- “wrote my thesis here, organised the funeral for Mother, ran all those-” he huffs a laugh- “
Malfoy’s eyebrows raise slightly, followed by a dry laugh. “Yes? I suppose so.” There’s a creepy silence in which Malfoy just eyes him appraisingly, his lips a taut, thin line. “There was heroin in your system.”
Draco raised his head and gave me a scathing glace. If looks could kill, then I’d have been six feet beneath the soil.
In the five minutes they are allowed to talk, Tarquin emphasises how much he despises his mother once or twice, but other than that, they just sit in silence, Harry’s hand on the table between them as close to Tarquin as he’s allowed before the guards shout a warning. He couldn’t bring himself to tell him that his mum refused to come.
Our DATE took us into the hotel restaurant first where James had booked a table for two. It was an Italian restaurant with silver candelabras and white candles – it almost looked wizarding in that regard. But even with that little detail, I felt a bit out of place. There I was, sat at that table with that random bloke. Candlelight, Romantic music. This did not at all feel anything like my usual work. A real, authentic date is what it felt like, and I have never even been on one. (I will not count in Jules because pints at a sports bar with a bunch of friends doesn’t count. Just no.)
I tell Draco about my days at Phoenix brooms, and sometimes he tells me a little about his clientele, and about how endlessly fascinated they are with his bump. It’s an odd feeling, imagining Draco with these men. I’m not envious or resentful, not at all – I know that Draco is providing a service to them and letting them live out their fantasies a little – but I do sometimes feel concerned.
sex, and nothing more, and hadn’t he been punished enough? Hadn't he already lost so much?
, felt like his body had betrayed him somehow, but whenever the whining, squealing voice in his head tried to whisper the answer Draco shut it down.
“Tea in the kitchen and your little treat on the settee. How does that sound?”
Salazar, Draco is much, much more than worth it. The lovely, silly man had no idea how much he loves his baby already, even though he jokes about getting fat and getting a belly. He’s adjusted his lifestyle. He won’t drink even a sip of alcohol and takes folic acid and extra vitamins every single day. When he’s sitting, leafing through a book, or watching the television, and he thinks I’m not looking, I see the way that his hand curls around his bump, warm and reverent. Draco is happy about the baby, I think – I
“Oh, shut up,” Harry says, joining her laughter.
It was late in January when Harry first slept over. The night was frigid and there was a deep layer of snow on the ground. Harry and he had been lazing on the settee, listening to his record player when Draco had realised that he didn’t want to be alone. The idea of Harry Disapparating away felt terribly upsetting – his stupid hormones were all over the place – so Draco asked Harry to stay overnight.
"I can't understand you when you mumble baby boy."  Draco hissed out watching how the Hufflepuff's face contorted when his fingers curled up into that same spot of spongey flesh over and over again.
"He could easily beat our arses."  Henry choked out obviously get more and more uncomfortable with this situation.
"That's Harry Potter."  Henry stammered out and kept shifting his light brown hued gaze between his friends and the still kneeling Harry.
"I didn't say we were done here cutie."  Thomas chuckled out moving his face so closer to Harry's.  Their noses brushed together, and Harry squirmed harder and harder trying to get away from the Ravenclaw.  "Now little one," Thomas cooed gripping onto Harry’s hip with a bruising force.  Harry whimpered out in pain and watched as the other two seemingly backed away to let someone by them.  "Why don't you show us how our mighty hero cries out for Malfoy?"  Thomas teased his question out but was caught off guard by a pale hand gripping his shoulder in warning.  Emerald hued eyes found grey ones as silvery-blond tresses glinted in the hallway light.  Harry recognized that gaze anywhere; Draco stood behind his captor obviously annoyed with the sight he found once turning the corner.
"Like some Hufflepuff could."  Harry pursed his lips out in another pout as Thomas spoke ill about himself.  Harry really wished he could be in his classroom learning about potions right now and not stuck in the middle of the hallway with these three knobheads.
"I love you too."  Draco quipped back to deaf ears and smiled when he heard the Hufflepuff's familiar snores fill up the Astronomy Tower.  A glance down at the dozen hickeys over Harry's neck caused a smile to work its way onto the Slytherin's face.  "Let's see if anyone else thinks they can have you now."  Draco sighed out laying his own head in the crook of his boyfriend's neck and smiled into Harry's kiss bruised skin dazedly.
"So full."  Harry quipped back as Draco cantered his hips into the Hufflepuff before pulling his cock back until only its head was left in Harry's spasming hole.  Muscular hips supported the harsh thrust as the Hufflepuff continued to moan and whine with his boyfriend's increasing pace.  Neither of them would last long at this point.  The Slytherin reached with his dominant hand to tangle his fingers into his boyfriend's dark hued tresses before yanking back so hard on them that it caused Harry's head to painfully arch back and stretch his neck but the moans and pleas for more never left the Hufflepuff's lips.  Draco's other hand moved to grab at the corner of Harry's mouth and use three fingers to painfully tug his mouth open.  Spittle fell out of the Hufflepuff's mouth and onto his chin and the Slytherin's fingers with each body-rocking thrust that rammed into Harry.
"M-malfoy we were just playing around is all."  Thomas spoke dropping his hand from Harry's hip and the smaller Hufflepuff bit back a sigh of relief from the pressure now being gone.  Draco's bone-dry laugh sent shivers down everyone's spines but Harry who held no fear for how his boyfriend was acting.  Harry knew if this wasn't going to end in a fight then Thomas really needed to let him go from this wall.
"Draco please I need you in me."  Harry's last sense of rationality was used to basically sob out those words and quicker than he'd said them the silvery-blond wizard's fingers pulled out of his tight heat.  The Hufflepuff felt tears fall from his lashes at the emptiness he felt in his lower stomach but it didn't last long before he was being shoved down onto his hands and knees by his boyfriend.
"One Ravenclaw teasing me doesn't mean you have to fuck my brains out during first period."  Harry's tone was riled as he earned an angry growl from his boyfriend as grey eyes darkened in a mix of lust and rage.  Maybe now wasn't the time to be talking back?
"Just that Ravenclaw's grip."  Draco tensed harshly and pulled his boyfriend back to lock their gazes.
"Why would it bruise?"  Draco mumbled as Harry wrapped his own arms around Draco's waist happily.
"Ass up."  As if Harry needed to be told that.  Trembling thighs somehow helped to hold up his ass as the dark-haired Hufflepuff arched his back seductively and cast his emerald green gaze over his shoulder to Draco.  "Good boy."  The silvery-blond wizard spoke as he slipped off his black boxers and spat into his hand.  Draco's cock was red with need and dripped fat beads of precum onto the floor as the Slytherin wrapped a spit slickened hand around his own cock to pump around his shaft slowly.  Soft grunts left his lips as grey eyes closed slightly before opening in search of his boyfriend.  When they landed on Harry, the smaller wizard shook his ass teasingly in the air.  "Patience."  The silvery-blond wizard  huffed out as he lowered his own body onto his knees behind the keening Hufflepuff.
"It was an accident."  Harry mumbled out quietly moving to sit up on his knees to set a soft glare on the unnamed Ravenclaw.  A sneer was sent down to the dark-haired Hufflepuff.  A deeper blush dug its way into Harry's cheekbones as the dirty blond haired wizard quirked up his right eyebrow in challenge.
"What the bloody hell is it Henry?"  Thomas groaned out turning his incredulous gaze on who Harry assumed was Henry.  Thomas looked slightly taken aback by the panic-stricken expression on the ginger's head.
"Thomas," the ginger spoke quickly, and Harry couldn't help but to notice how the boy's light brown eyes widened in worry.  The ashen blonde presumably Thomas continued to ignore his shorter friend but a quick jab to his side got his attention.
"Y-you!"  Harry yelled around his boyfriend's fingers as he felt his stomach coil in preparation of his impending release.  "Draco-"  A broken sob got a pleasure filled grunt in response.  Everything was becoming so, so carnal as Draco used all of his strength to piston his hips into the Hufflepuff's wrecked whole.  Squelching and the sound of the Slytherin's full balls slapping against his boyfriend's ass filed the room as Harry gave one warning of his orgasm.  "I'm gonna-"  Another harsh thrust landing into his prostate had Harry falling over the edge as a silent scream passed his lips.  Emerald green eyes were blown wide as Draco continued to chase his own release.
"In me," Harry's thoughts were almost as erratic as his words as his hips rocked down onto the Slytherin's hand.
"Did you say something?"  The Ravenclaw grunted out as his friend to his left just now seemed to notice who the clumsy Hufflepuff was.
"Someone knew you were mine and yet they still continued to mess with you."  Draco pulled his face away from the dark-haired Hufflepuff's and locked his ireful gaze onto his shorter boyfriend's wrecked one.  "Do you not understand how frustrating that is?"  Silvery-blond brows furrowed as the Slytherin continued his rant not giving the overwhelmed Harry a chance to respond.  "How am I supposed to protect and take care of you if no one takes me seriously?"  Another question went unanswered as moans and whimpers tumbled past the Hufflepuff's lips as each word was separated by a harsh canter of Draco's hips into his own.  Harry could feel his cock slicken with precum as his groin began to sorely throb from the lack of attention.  "So, I'll just have to show them your mine."  Draco's last word was emphasized as gave another firm smack down onto his boyfriend's ass causing a pleasurable sting to ebb its way into the Hufflepuff's skin.
"I was going to be patient and coddle you, but you just don't listen Harry."  Draco's statement was finished by him yanking down the dark-haired Hufflepuff's boxers.  Cold air blew onto Harry's flushed and twitching cock as it slapped up against his lower stomach causing a broken sob of a moan to drip out of the dark-haired Hufflepuff's wrecked lips.  "Guess I'll have to ruin you."  The silvery-blond Slytherin's hand dropped away from Harry's ass to the back of thigh to tug up and hook Harry's leg into place on his own hips.  Harry squealed in shock as Draco's long fingers were pressed into his open mouth.  "Suck."  The Slytherin clipped out his command and when his boyfriend hesitated; Draco thrusted three of his fingers back into the velvety cavern gaging Harry in the process.  Spittle slung out with each thrust of the silvery-blond wizard's fingers into his mouth as the Hufflepuff tried to get into a rhythm of sucking and swallowing the long digits cantering into his mouth.  Seemingly satisfied with his somewhat lubed up fingers, Draco pulled them out of his boyfriend's mouth and dropped his saliva-soaked hand down to the Hufflepuff's ass. The Slytherin's other hand came down to Harry's ass and grabbed one of the dark-haired Hufflepuff's cheeks into his large hand and stretched them apart.
"Up," Draco all but snarled out his deep pitched voice dripping in tetchiness as he rose a silvery-blond brow as to show his obvious provocation.  Having done this one to many times Harry was quick to obey fearing whatever fun punishment that would follow if he didn't.  The lean Hufflepuff hopped up and wrapped his muscular legs around Draco's back making sure to hook them together behind the Slytherin's strong back.  "Good boy."  Draco's acclaim sent more heated electricity down to Harry's ever hardening cock as grey eyes glinted in a playful malice.  The larger Slytherin was quick to lean down into the crook of Harry's neck and begin to place frenzied opened mouthed kisses to the soft skin.  Teeth raked down as if starving for physical contact with the Hufflepuff's skin as Harry tipped his head back to whine softly.
"Shove off."  The dark-haired Hufflepuff huffed out and was thankful when the silvery-blond Slytherin offered his forearm as a pillow to the smaller wizard that Draco cradled in his arms.  Harry laid his head down on his boyfriend's muscular arm and felt exhaustion sink its snuggly claws into his wrecked body.  The Hufflepuff let unconsciousness take over him completely before the Slytherin could retort back.
"Are you okay?"  Draco asked turning around and glared at Thomas's retreating figure while still being concerned for his boyfriend.
"Hurry, hurry."  Harry all but sobbed out as Draco's hands pulled his ass apart to stare down at his twitching hole.  The Slytherin lined his throbbing cock up with his boyfriend's ass and groaned at the way the Hufflepuff rolled his hips back against his cock.
"You should know."  The Slytherin's response was clipped as he continued his trail of hickeys down the dark-haired Hufflepuff's neck slowly coming closer and closer to Harry's clothed shoulder.  Draco's hips involuntarily cantered up to rock against the smaller wizard's crotch and a fragmented gasp snuck its way through kiss slicken lips and Harry rolled his hips down to meet his boyfriend's.
"There you are love."  Draco's deep pitched voice spoke only to his boyfriend and grey eyes sharpened in annoyance when he saw the hand on Harry's hip.  "You weren't at breakfast, so I came to make sure you were fine."  Draco spoke sweetly to Harry but the small Hufflepuff could see the restraint clear in his every narrowing grey gaze.  "But I see something came up."  The Slytherin's tone was heavy with the promise of an attack as he tightened his grip on Thomas's shoulder.
"His handprint is going to be bruised on my boyfriend?"  Draco hissed out his question moving to lift up Harry's shirt to look at his hip.  Grey eyes found a reddened handprint darkening by the second on Harry's lean hip.  Draco tried to place his hand on the forming bruise to have it match up, but his hand was too large.  Harry gulped down his worry and lifted his gaze to lock his Draco's grey one and noticed how his eyes darkened in lust and possessiveness.
"He's Malfoy's boy Thomas."  The dark-haired Ravenclaw called out grabbing both of his friend's attentions easily.  Thomas looked slightly worried but brushed it off as he rolled his azure hued eyes amusement.  Harry perked up at the mention of his longtime boyfriend and placed his own green hued gaze on Thomas.
"No.  I'm not going to let you take out your anger on me."  The dark-haired Hufflepuff turned to leave and got as far as opening the wooden door before a pale hand slamming it closed above his head had the shorter wizard freezing in his tracks.
"You're so tight baby boy."  The Slytherin groaned out continuing his mix of curling and scissoring motions as Harry's fingernails scraped down his muscular back most likely drawing blood.  "Can't wait to be in you."  Draco pushed in a third finger and Harry felt a spurt of precum pulse out of his deprived cock.  The dark-haired Hufflepuff felt full and yet his body still craved to have his boyfriend to be fully sheathed in him.  Fuck this foreplay shit he needed Draco's cock now.
"So?"  Thomas quipped back obviously not wanting to give the boy who lived any special treatment.  The ebony haired man on the opposite side of Thomas went rigid and Harry could see his hazel eyes darting back in forth between his friends incredulously.
Harry squeaked out in pain as his back was shoved roughly into the Astronomy Tower's door as it closed shut behind him and Draco; emerald green eyes slammed shut on impact.  Before the dark-haired Hufflepuff could make another noise, Draco's chapped lips pressed indignantly against Harry's own and a growl slipped out of the Slytherin's mouth and onto his boyfriend's trembling lips.  Hot air puffed against Harry's lips as large hands moved down from his shoulders to his hips gripping harshly as Draco began to feverishly move his lips against the shorter Hufflepuff's.  Harry's whimper of pain was swallowed by Draco's mouth as he eagerly pushed his tongue past the dark-haired Hufflepuff's lips.  Teeth clashed on teeth in a such manner that had Harry's head swimming and his skin sizzling as the Slytherin's hands slipped away from his hips to hold the small of the shorter Hufflepuff's back.  Harry regained the feeling in his limbs as he lifted his arms to knot his fingers into silvery-blond tresses as boiling waves of electricity pulsed down through his veins and straight to his half hard cock.  Draco groaned in praise as the shorter wizard jerked down on his styled hair as the Slytherin sucked Harry's bottom lip into his mouth to nip and lick at it.  Draco's hands slipped down further to grip hastily onto the Hufflepuff's ass as he pulled back from their heated kiss.  Strings of saliva connected their mouths and grey eyes avidly took in the sight of Harry's flushed face and kiss wet and reddened lips as a lazy smirk lifted up the edges of Draco's mouth.  Harry panted pathetically as he opened his emerald green hued eyes to lock with the taller Slytherin's with furrowing dark hued brows.  The bells for first period chimed and as the dark-haired Hufflepuff glared at his boyfriend Draco laughed it off.  After a few more rasping heaves of his chest Harry keened out loudly at the fixed smack that came down on his ass.
"Strip or I'll fuck that naughty little mouth of yours until you can't talk back."  The Slytherin's tone held no room for argument but Harry couldn't say he didn't like the sound of his punishment.  However, being able to verbally explain his absence tomorrow would be better than getting his throat used like a sex toy even if the latter did sound oh, so delicious to the Hufflepuff.  Muttering a defiant 'fine' Harry shucked off his jumper easily before Draco pulled away from the door.  A tense silence filled the room while the boys quickly stripped down to their boxers.  "Turn around and be a good boy for me."  The silvery-blond wizzard purred out and the shorter Hufflepuff was quick to comply.  Grey eyes roamed his body hungrily and caught sight of the strained bulge in his red boxers reached down with a large hand to cup it softly.  Harry couldn't stop himself as he bucked into Draco's palm and quickly reached up to grip onto the pale Slytherin's shoulders.  "So hard and all we did was kiss."  Draco teased as he ran his free hand down the Hufflepuff's chest and slowly took one hardened nipple in his hands to roll it between his index finger and thumb softly.  Harry bit down onto his bottom lip as his emerald green eyes cast downwards to watch his boyfriend's hands work over his clothed cock and erect nipples.  "Such a good boy."  Harry let a whimper past his bruised lips at the praise and felt his aching cock jump up when the Slytherin's thumb rolled over its head.
"Fuck!"  Draco's hips stalled as he emptied his searing hot seed into Harry's tight hole as his own head knocked back and his grey eyes shut tightly.  The Slytherin rocked his hips riding out his high before he pulled his cock out with an audible popping and squishing sound as he gently untangled his hands from the Hufflepuff's hair and mouth.  Grey eyes watched as Harry's body slumped forwards onto the floor and his own seed dripped out of his boyfriend's wrecked and spasming holes.  A quick cleaning spell was cast on both of them by Draco as the Hufflepuff tried to clear the fog in his mind and ease his thundering pulse.  When Harry came to his back was pressed against Draco's chest and their robes were draped over them in mock blankets.  The Hufflepuff turned his sore neck despite its throbbing to lock his gaze onto the larger Slytherin's content one.  "Welcome back to Earth."  Draco laughed out pressing a tender kiss to his boyfriend's forehead.
"Who do you belong to?"  Draco snarled up quickening his pace and angling his hips to hit the oh, so familiar spongey patch of tissue that had the small Hufflepuff falling apart instantly.  All Harry could do was whine out at the pain and pleasure coursing through his veins as he felt his own ass tighten with the threat of an orgasm.  "Who's the only person that can make you feel this good?"  The Slytherin's tone was noting less than carnal as he felt his own orgasm approach as his thrusts became more and more erratic.
"Astronomy Tower."  Draco huffed out and Harry knew instantly how he was going to spend his morning.
"My hip might bruise but I'm fine."  Harry spoke moving to collapse into the taller Slytherin's chest with a sigh or relief.  Harry took in greedy breaths of Draco's cologne enjoying the woodsy-mint scent.  Strong arms wrapped around the Hufflepuff's back and Draco pressed his chin on top of Harry's head.
"Draco?"  Harry asked not really knowing how to respond to his overprotective boyfriend was reacting.  A harsh glare was set on him and Draco moved to pick up the books Harry had dropped when he was slammed into the wall.  After grabbing the books, he intertwined their fingers and took off at brisk pace pulling the smaller Hufflepuff down the hallway.  "Babe?"  Harry called trying to get his boyfriend to listen to him as they turned down another hallway.  "Where are we going?"  The small Hufflepuff asked and felt his own excitement deepen the pit in his stomach.
I offered Harry to read my journal as well, but he insisted that it wasn’t necessary, that he understands why I read his words, but that he doesn’t want me to feel compelled to reciprocate it. “I accept whatever you want to confide in me,” he had said. “You needed to rebuild trust, so you were curious what I kept hidden. That’s alright, I understand that.”
"I'm very willing to forgive you," I replied. "I ought to confess that there are moments in which it all wells up inside of me. Moments in which I’m angry at you, and in which I doubt are truthful to me. But I don’t want to let those moments define me, us. You forgave me things far worse than what you did, Potter.”
They each leant against the sides of the shower’s small confines; Draco against the closed door, Harry against the tiles.
Now, the thing is: he might be magic without knowing it? I’m not sure how well Muggleborn wixen are detected. Or he might be a Squib and my exceedingly hot self milked some arcane burst of enchantment out of him? I need to believe it’s one of those options. Because the only other answer to my questions is that he paid me so well because he wanted to make some Death Eater scum his cockslut…
A succession of sounds rolls from Draco’s lips that Harry doesn’t quite get, both because Draco is in his headspace again, and probably also because he likely doesn’t know the words.
My afternoon’s work was conducted without engaging my brain. That was elsewhere, busily making plans. If I were to buy sex, it’d have to be outside the confines of the magical world. The risk of being seen – or being caught – on Diagon were too high. The person that I’d engage to fuck would have to be Muggle. I knew there were websites that helped to find men. I’ve seen them advertised in telephone boxes and in the back of newspapers when I’ve visited gay sex shops in Soho.
Back to today, though. We had a brilliant day, truly amazing.
Some of the tension thaws from Harry’s shoulder as he groans and rubs his face. “Yeah, s’pose you’re right.”
or that, potentially, the
Draco was livid with the letter. He screwed it up and burst it into flames, all with one small flick of his wand. “You let me worry,” he said, cutting through my tears and my self-recriminations with sharp words. “Your cajoling words, and your stupid smiles and all your little kindnesses. They were all just lies. You’re nowhere near as good as you’d like to believe you are. Me… the
“How can you be so-“ But what he is, Harry never gets to know. The guy is back in his face, their mouths crushing together so hard that the back of Harry’s head hits the panelling again. He’s anything but a good kisser, and the night is too young to waste it away with such a tosser. Harry seizes his hands and twists around to push the bloke up against the wall, leaning in for another kiss before leaving him there without a second glance, retreating to the huge entertaining room where the party is in full swing.
The last date he could have gotten an abortion had already passed him by, marked only by a tiny star that he’d stuck into his diary.
Unable to speak, I nodded my agreement. I gave the coin a tap with my wand. I’d cast a clever bit of magic onto it, stolen from Hermione, and I felt myself flung through space immediately.
He’d been so alone, and too frightened to face up to what was happening to him. His only recourse had been to try to blank it all out, but that hadn’t helped. He’d pretended so hard that nothing was changing but that hadn’t made a Sickle of difference. He hadn’t dared to reach out to anybody. Draco had buried his head in the sand.
alarm, but it can’t be long. Still sleepy and ready to snuggle back under the sheets, Harry rolls over, the figure next to him only a blur without his glasses, but perfectly familiar. His arms sneak below the quilt, one below Draco’s neck, one clasping his chest; Draco scoots backwards until his back is flush against Harry’s chest.
Potter will most certainly not hate me.
And I was more turned on than I believed I’d ever been in my life.
“Oh god,” Harry says, hands clasping around Draco’s shoulders in an attempt to steady himself. Even though he can’t pinpoint every minute movement, it very much feels like the toy is suckling a spot inside his arse that might be his prostate, he isn’t sure. But once it starts moving again, it rubs that spot time and time again, and it’s so,
, I am not enough. How I never have been. Not lordly enough for Father, not agreeable enough for Mother, not good enough for stupid Potter and the Weasel when we were eleven, not smart enough for Snape, not brave enough for Dumbledore, not enough of a ruthless killer for Bellatrix and that maniac.
“Yes.”
, what the fuck.”
Harry gives a laugh. “Oh yes, very. There’s blow all over your nose, mate.”
Harry stares at it, not understanding anything but grandmother and phoenix. “Phoenixes?” Harry realises that the crossed sticks do look a bit like a perch for a huge bird.
And then, suddenly, it’s all too much.
that he impregnated me? He surely must’ve felt the magic, and Potter isn’t as thick as he likes to pretend.
the pack. But he shook his head, his one hand finding mine, the other caressed my middle. “No smoking when I’m with you. And definitely not in your bedroom.”
” Draco said, squeezing Harry unnecessarily forcefully and scattering kisses over his face. “
Draco spoke to me today though. He spoke to me half an hour ago. Draco shouted, and he screamed, and he threw the food that I’d prepared for him and left beneath a stasis spell. I’ve tomato sauce congealed in my hair and tears are tracking down my face.
On their way upstairs, Harry just tells him that his week was fine. In the living room, Harry gets his coke vial out of his back pocket and wiggles it in front of Draco.
The moon looks other-worldly the way it’s huge and pale, illuminating the clouds that coil around the orb. Harry stops for a moment just to watch that beautiful scenery, chasing away a few stray thoughts about the influence of the moon on magical plants—he’ll think none of that. He just wants to watch the moon. It reminds him to pay attention to himself, to dwell in this contented rapture he’s experiencing right now. His heart feels light and happy in anticipation of talking through the whole night with two amazing people, his body limp and stimulated from the exertions of dancing.
“But he left us,” Harry emphasised. “We’ve been so close and he just- We shouldn’t have been so nice to him. I’m not sure he deserves it after- He just went away like we haven’t been through so much together. Through
Carol’s voice trails off, and Harry takes a bracing breath. He’s feeling dizzy, slightly nauseous, and perhaps he’s starting a cold or something, because he keeps on shuddering along to bittersweet pulses of migraine that seize his head every so often, despite being wrapped in a perfectly warm jumper that he’s even secretly charmed to stay warm.
That was enough for me to feel like a right arsehole for trying to pick a fight. I took a deep, calming breath, and I conceded that I probably meant only half of what I said. “I’m not sure how to proceed from here,” I said, meaning the pregnancy. “I don’t want to go back to St Mungo’s, that audacious brute of a wizard can go to hell. But I will need a Healer. And I assume that I will need to find James Evens.”
“Perfect is just right for you,” Harry answered, giving a small smile.
Worse, what if I saw Draco and confessed everything, the words spilling from my mouth like under Veritaserum? Circe, but my teacup was trembling in my hand, and when I heard the Floo chime, the most embarrassing thing happened.
“There’s somebody here you’ll be very pleased to see,” Ginny hissed in a noisy stage whisper. “A certain wizard who
“Otherworldly,” Tarquin concludes with Harry agreeing along, trying to phrase what listening to the band felt like, consumed by this crowd of black shirts and veils of swaying thatches.
badges. Now, though, the witch was gawking up at him, her face aghast, as if he’d committed the most iniquitous of crimes. Perhaps he had. In twenty-two years, Draco didn’t believe that he’d ever lied to Pansy before.
under influence whenever we see each other.”
Draco chuckles softly. “One ought to think the Samhain celebrations should have been eerie enough.”
Harry Potter… Yes, the one with the scar and the Expelliarmus! Yes I’m the real deal, I promise. Now, you offered me seats to celebrate being open for a month? I know I said I didn’t accept things like that but… It seems I’ve changed my mind.”
Draco’s words are both Harry’s biggest hope fulfilled and his worst trepidation coming true. “You’ll grow tired of me,” Harry says, crying. “You’ll get tired of my shit, or you’ll find someone or something else that is just not as
. A hundred, thousand times
Harry feels his prick harden but is wrenched from his intense observation by a dull thud next to him, a sound belonging to the umpteenth person tripping over the small step that leads up to this floor. The bloke’s obnoxiously loud laugh carries over the dense sound of music and chatter, his gaze searches for his friends who are following behind him while he spills his beer over his hands and the floor.
Harry shouts over the noise how good the DJ is and how perfect it feels that it’s so crowded tonight, not hearing his own voice and fully convinced that Tarquin won’t hear his words but will understand him anyways.
Draco squats back down to plant the final two garlic bulbs. “Have you ever been to a Samhain bonfire? You were raised Muggle, right?”
hell, his other hand had managed to find its way to his arsehole. Somehow Fitzgerald had managed to slick up his fingers and now they were grazing over his entrance.
“Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,” Draco repeats, slower. “It’s the eerie one, usually played on an organ. You know it.”
With a nine-to-five job, my social life would be a complete disaster. And my pretence with it. People knowing about my actual occupation and all these ludicrous reparations I have to pay would be the definite end of me. I suppose it’s partly my Malfoy pride that kept me from mentioning financial problems or anything else of the sort to even my closest friends. And it keeps me sane, meeting up with friends and family and telling them how I lark about all day, enjoying life at the Zabini estate to the fullest. Luckily, to Blaise and Pansy it doesn’t even occur that people actually have to earn the money that they spend.
We went on forever. I was lying in the middle of the bed in a supine position, legs in the air. We were kissing quite sloppily, and when his hand was tight on my prick, pulling quite ruthlessly with his lube and precum-slick palm, I felt my orgasm building up. Suddenly and with full force.
As we sat there, ordering wine and starters, it was all a bit stilted. Conversations about finding our way here, one of the first things I always ask about, because Muggles do take so much longer to get anywhere. But James didn’t seem to have anything to complain about finding the hotel and he did not start to brag or vent about his automobile. What a strange specimen of a man he was.
A chilly, but pleasant draught catches in his hair, on his cheeks in a tingly caress. The sunrise looks beautiful from so up high, the horizon unobstructed and broad as can be. The red sun is still low. The flaming beams catch on flat and gabled rooftops beautifully, veiling the grid of streets below in dark shadow. He wonders whether he'd dream about it, about death, if he went to bed now.
Harry feels like he ought to say something.
, so much music, and art galleries, and restaurants, and days in bed or on the settee in the red parlour. Me playing the pianoforte under Harry’s appreciative gazes, and Harry reading achingly beautiful literature to me in the warm timbre of his lovely voice.
After they part with plans to meet soon—Hermione insisted on concrete plans, and they’ll see each other this Sunday at their house—Harry stands there in the hallway of the deserted house, looking up the stairway that vanishes into darkness and back through the double-winged door into the drawing room where, over a decade ago, Harry, Ron and Hermione slept on the ground between the settees, huddled together and taking turns on their night vigil.
But the pregnancy books are helping so far. I’d imagine that most things must be similar for witches and wizards, at least the supplements as well as the guidelines on diet and rest.
“I don’t think I’m a cut above you,” I answered truthfully. “I told you in my letter, Draco, and I’ll tell you again now. What I did that night was stupid, and rash, and if I could take it back I would. I don’t know what to say except-“
He finds Hermione’s gaze and they smile at each other. She nods at the excited bunch behind her and suggests a little eyeroll. Earlier, they had talked about her approaching due date, and she made Harry promise to drop by every now and then. She told him how she went mad after Rose was born because, even though she loves being a mum, it can be very tiring to spend weeks and weeks at home when your mind is still occupied with the newest crazy draft law one or another bureau wants to push through.
. You might have paid for me once, but now it’s your turn, Harry. You’ll give me your magic, and you’ll keep
“You’ve said it on occasion,” Draco responded, amusement in his voice. I picked up the shampoo bottle and squirted a Gallon sized dollop into my palm. I worked it through Draco’s hair, massaging his scalp and working the soap into a fine lather.
A flash and rude words. Make-up sex in the spa of a fancy hotel and another round in an alley, nothing but Harry’s pale arse bared for me to claim, and I recognise the area as the one close to Teddy’s university.
“The wonders of the wizarding world, isn’t that right?” Andromeda says. “It’s a shame when the traditional celebrations fall into oblivion. Pureblood supremacy very much dug its own grave.”
Draco pauses, his eyes assessing Harry for a moment apprehensively. “Any morphine? Heroin?”
Draco laughed at my plan. “Oh, love,” he said, watching as I caught the jar and then unscrewed the lid. “I’ve been using that since the day I found out I was expecting. Must have slathered on three tubs of the stuff. It hasn’t made a whit of difference. I’ve still got a stretch mark.”
Draco glanced around, trying to work out whom Potter wanted to speak to. There wasn't anyone else though, and before he had time to make a sharp exit, Harry sat down beside him.
I even recall that bloke he dated from the night in the Leaky with Ronald and Astoria. Jonas or Jonathan or some other common name like that. It’s his fault that I’m reminded of the option that Potter might not find me entirely unattractive.
There’s a knock. “Guys? Don’t mean to interrupt.” It’s Teddy, leaning against the doorframe with a cheeky grin on his face. His hair is a vibrant blue colour and he’s wearing only pyjama bottoms. Teddy is back in Britain after his last trip abroad. He blogs about his travels and had delayed his studies to the point that Harry and Draco doubt he will ever resume his education. Neither of them quite understands how exactly Teddy makes his money except that there are ads, and he sometimes streams from secluded places. But he looks happy and only rarely asks for money, so Harry and Draco love that he’s found something for him. Harry can’t begin to say how glad he is that Teddy didn’t even apply for Auror training. When his godson started listening to punk rock, a sudden antipathy with the Ministry rose in him also, one which suited Harry only too well.
Harry’s frown deepens.
And why? Because Harry looked so free and so happy, and I thought that my views on these things might be a bit uptight and formal. Since when do I make other’s interest my priority when there’s nothing in it for me?
“That. Is. Not. What. I. Meant.” Harry’s jaw starts to hurt from clenching it so hard, but it helps him restraining himself from jostling Draco again. His fingernails dig into the flesh of his palms. Harry tries to concentrate on that.
“Yes,” Harry responded, his hands cautiously stroking Draco’s thin chest.
“Sure, they had no idea,” George says, ironic. Percy rolls his eyes but doesn’t argue. Harry downs his wine and gets another glass.
I’m not ashamed to say that I cried too, Cassie, and so did Draco. Matching tears ran down our faces. Gods, but you were the most perfect thing that I’d ever laid eyes on, red and furious, and wailing loudly at the indignity of being born. I used my wand to cut your umbilical cord and then Bartsch cast protective magic over you, and wrapped you in a soft yellow towel, before you were plonked onto Draco’s upper chest for a cuddle.
“It’s all about the dynamic—we’re both terrific kissers, I’d say.” Harry licks his lips, his hands travelling up and down the rough fabric covering Draco’s skinny thighs. “How about we take this upstairs?”
Journal, help.
“You look a bit pale,” Draco determines.
of all the cruelty that happened around him rather than the sheltered old money pureblood life that he was raised to lead.
This Harry Potter looked entirely tangible, however, and the jovial smile he wore was real enough. “You’re sure you want to do this?” Draco asked, waiting for the other boot to drop. “You’d- you’d pretend to be my boyfriend?”
It’s just starting to get dark with a mostly overcast sky and the hint of the setting sun in the distance. Industrial buildings, tall but not reaching the level of the rooftop terrace, angular and silver with cement, shadows, and stale window shades. What a sombre view to look down into the world from up here, Harry thinks, bitter, and he leans on the ice-cold balustrade, face to the sky, briefly faint with a new wave of dizziness.
“Harry,” Draco says, and Harry realises that he’s muttered a succession of
First thing he did was swallow, hard. I’m not sure whether he found me attractive or whether it was because of the bump or the scars across my chest. Most likely a combination of all three. He took off his own shirt and lay down very close to me. He started trailing his fingertips down my torso, and when he reached the swell of my belly, he flattened his hand and rested it there, warm and protective.
for the sick. And this thing with Potter—it’s so verdant, so new. It shouldn’t weigh on him so heavily. It shouldn’t feel as though his entire world were ending if Harry doesn’t manage at least half of his small ration.
define me that isn’t
That being said, Harry was desperately dull. He hadn’t tried it on, or ever made any sneering remarks about his reputation. He was also an Auror, and they practiced lots of spells and enchantments the public didn’t get taught at Hogwarts. If Fitzgerald had gotten ideas after seeing Draco and was waiting in the dark shadows of his home…
They are both giddy with a line of cocaine; Draco gave in when Harry snorted his second one, commenting Harry’s grin with, “It’s you who got me all emotional, Potter.” But aside from that, Draco didn’t bring up that Harry cried or asked any unpleasant questions about reasons or other things. On the coffee table sits the phoenix perch that Harry asked Draco to show him again, and Harry, in incredulous awe, tried to imagine an elderly lady in a Victorian-style furnished room with two phoenixes on that perch.
good that it’s almost too much. He desperately claws at Draco who keeps holding him and kissing him, open-mouthed and almost idle while Harry pants against his mouth, desperate.
” that they duelled each other. Unblinking glares, a merciless succession of spells, no shields, and it ended almost,
Harry found his own hand wandering down to his prick where he cupped his balls and gave himself a tug. Draco looked so flooded with satisfaction that he almost couldn’t stand the idea to have him tasked with anything other than enjoying his afterglow. But without waiting for an answer, Draco heaved himself up and dived down to Harry’s crotch.
“Sounds intriguing,” Harry says. Frankly, he’s never dared to take shrooms because he’s heard about the most horrible stories about bad trips. He doesn’t exactly trust his brain to not go down that road. On the other hand, Malfoy’s mind surely can go to very dark places too, so maybe Harry should reconsider his thoughts on acid, seeing how exhilarated the man looks, lost in the memories of trips in the past. Harry has a hard time picturing the life Malfoy must’ve led.
We sat together way into the night after that. He looked at me a little funny when I refused the beer he had stored away in a cupboard, but he didn’t pry. It feels like he reads me so well. He knows that something is up.
Draco wasn’t ever shy about pursuing the objects of his desire, and the opportunity to add a Fitzgerald-shaped notch on his broomstick arrived before he had time to draw breath. Oliver Wood, the much-loved Appleby Captain, was throwing his customary end-of-season party the following Friday night. As a Quidditch journo Draco always got an automatic invite, so as to keep him sweet for the coming season.
A faint hint of a bass accompanies Harry’s lift ride. He watches the digits of the display climb from zero to seven. Draco was right, Harry thinks, about moving to a small town, busy with people starting their lives and cafés occupied by spectacled eggheads clad in tweed jackets. It’s better than the literal cabin in the woods they had before, secluded from the world, just the two of them. Harry doesn’t like the fact that it was too much, too intense. He wanted Draco to want nothing but him.
Teddy nods, but glances at Harry quizzically.
Draco looked down at his daughter, prouder than he’d believed it was possible to be, and had known in his heart that he couldn’t be parted from her. His
The two of them kissed soundly and the rest of the world fell away. They could have been the only two wizards on the face of the earth. They were interrupted by the delicate cough of an Elf-Waiter. “It is time for the mains to be served,” he said, eyes twinkling. “And may I present a bottle of Elven Champagne, compliments of The Chimaera’s Den. We wish you every happiness.”
“She worth it?” the guy with the beanie asks.
“Except that’s where you’re wrong Mr Malfoy,” the wizard answered, impassive and unimpressed. He picked up a quill, and fiddled with the feather, taking his sweet time before speaking again. “You, by yourself, won’t be anywhere
Harry’s throat constricts when he undoes button after button, inevitably revealing streaks of long-healed cuts, prominent as though inflicted only a few months ago. And briefly, memories dawn in Harry’s mind. Memories so repressed and simultaneously urgent that he briefly feels as though it happened only a few months ago.
“Yes, well,” the other bloke demurs, fumbling with a pack of cigarettes. “If it just didn’t take her so long, you know? To stop bearing a grudge after shit like that.” When Harry sees the bloke searching his coat pockets, Harry offers to light his cigarette that’s sticking between his lips.
So, please, please, let him be like that with my spawn too.
to mend things, and you're brilliant at it," Harry points out as though he has to explain a very important concept to Draco.
Harry looked around the sparkling restaurant and back at his fiancé. He couldn’t imagine a more magical night.  A future shared with Draco was the only one he wanted.
They get their mollies anyway—five capsules that they break open to snort the encased stark white powder. John pleads with them to deny him any more of the mollies they bought from Harry’s money. Harry chugs the rest of his beer, already feeling ecstatic with the faint vibration of the bass that thrums through his body.
“And she must’ve lived in Malfoy Manor as a young girl,” Harry realises, and Draco nods. In contrast to earlier, the idea is rather fascinating now than overwhelming.
I enjoyed a pleasant visit to Hogwarts, where Neville and Seamus live a frightfully domestic married existence as the respective Charms and Herbology Professors. Seamus plied me with his homemade Elderflower wine, and – while I was terribly drunk – asked me if there was somebody special. I confessed that there was, “but that it was the very last person in the world you’d both expect me to have fallen in love with.”
They were both panting, the sound almost but not quite drowned in the stream of the shower.
“The Chimaera’s Den?” Harry asked. “Ron mentioned it the other day, while we were finishing up the paperwork on the magical creature smuggling case? You remember, love. The one with the Kneazles being kept two in a cage? Merlin, but it was awful, that-“
if we don’t talk about all the shit that happened.”
There’s a brief silence before Draco says, “I will always listen, Harry.” Harry believes him.
. Stupid, boring Harry with his sensible glass of water, who wasn’t
” I didn’t dare though. He might have said that he already had, and I don’t think that I could have borne to hear those words leave his mouth.
Draco is visibly pregnant now, and so the sight of him elicits gossip everywhere he goes. It’s easier for him to Apparate whenever he meets clients and to spend the rest of his time lazing inside the library and the gardens of Grimmauld Place. That’s usually where I find him, napping or leafing through some ancient spell book. Of course, the moment that I see him, I can’t resist him. I wrap my hands around his middle, feeling for the swell of his belly and his smooth, silky skin beneath my palm.
When Harry concentrates, he can feel the once-familiar nausea caused from the pull of Apparition behind his navel. Which might add to the confusion he feels about wherever the fuck he is, and just for a moment he’s not even sure
“Again, I’m sorry for your loss, ma’am,” Draco says with a grave timbre.
Pansy was the first to get tired of Draco’s self-imposed absence from her life. When three of her owls had been ignored, and there had been four weeks of silence, Draco found himself holding an invite to brunch. He was expected at Parkinson Manor the following Sunday.
The aristocratic old witch showed Draco the door. Her respect for the old ways and the old Sacred Twenty-Eight families don’t stretch so far that she was willing to have an unbonded father living beneath her roof.
After some time had passed, we realised how late the hour was. All the other shops would have been closed as well. “We will have to go on another day,” Harry pointed out, a bit bemused.
When he came back, he was holding a plate of chocolate digestives. The biscuits were terribly Muggle, but so delicious, and Draco felt a wave of affection for Potter. He opened his mouth to both thank Harry, and to chide him for fattening him up, but the words that fell out of his mouth weren’t the ones that Draco expected to say.
’s and
Merlin, but Draco needed some small respite. Fitzgerald had taken up residence in his consciousness like a particularly ugly toad and there was no shifting him.
Harry was there, of course. Didn’t take a minute until I heard the crack of his Apparition while there was a war raging in my mind about calling a Muggle ambulance. And he kept a cool head, of course, and got me into safety. Same old story. Malfoy can’t look after himself and needs Potter’s grandeur to be saved. The Saviour strikes again. Bloody brilliant.
“Well, but they are,” George chimes in, his eyebrows raised at his dad. “Their purchase is cheap because they usually use cheap wood. And often enough, it’s neither hand-carved nor are the charms applied very expertly. Quality does cost money sometimes, dad.”
When I was out of my shirt, I second-guessed my capability of casting my glamours expertly, because James ran his hand over my chest so reverently that I thought all my scars were on bright display. But they weren’t.
Well, anyway. Harry probably knows that I’m scared anyway. He knows me well.
, are some of the first thoughts that cross Vernon Dursley’s mind.
Harry didn’t say the word rape, and for that Draco was grateful. Pansy’s words rang through his head,
When Draco’s
Draco Malfoy’s reputation preceded him. Draco was a flirt. Draco liked sex, and he liked plenty of it. He was out, and brash, and proud of who he was. Despite being part of their staff, Draco spent half his life in the Prophet scandal pages. There was always a different man on his arm, and a different man – or two – sharing his bed.
, and watching himself spurt half into him and half over his arse.
The last one rather sounds like a tease. “Oi!” Harry exclaims with pretend indignance. He feels like shoving Malfoy but refrains. “I’ll have you know that I’m an orator extraordinaire.”
Draco lets his head lull backwards against the cold stone wall next to his bed. There’s no reprieve though, not really. The images are burnt into the insides of his lids. Harry, his depleting frame wrapped in a stark white blanket, hands shaking as he tries to persuade his mind and body into eating.
Inwardly, Draco cursed himself. He’d let himself get caught so easily. It was as if time had slowed down to a trickle. He was an idiot, and he deserved everything he got.
talking about his babies and ask Harry what his life with Draco is like because his life fucking
Harry feels petulant when he shrugs at that and, in lieu of having anything useful to do with his hands, uncaps the vial and snorts a spoonful under Draco’s scrutinizing gaze. The sniffing and throat-clearing that Harry can’t hold back seem too loud in the room.
“So you don’t get angry with me because I—what?—saved your life? Testified for you at your Wizengamot trial? Do you think you’re not allowed to get mad at me?”
The first time it’d happened, Draco had legitimately believed he was dying from a heart attack. He’d been looking inside his wardrobe, and had happened to come across the gauzy midnight blue shirt that he’d worn the evening of Oliver’s party.
Their sex in the mornings is always like this. Slow and lazy. Without much movement except for undulating hips and close embraces. They don’t talk or try new things like they might sometimes do in the evening. It’s not about creating a particularly special moment or about giving or receiving the most brilliant orgasm. They would simply use any friction they find with each other’s bodies, use their hands, the crease of their bums, or frot their pricks together into sweet release, following the addictive pleasure without thinking. Pulled towards each other as though the day couldn't start without the intimacy. And after, they would roll out of bed, talk quietly about their day, shower and brush their teeth together.
Draco had always lived his life as he saw fit, and assumed that he would be respected for that. He hadn’t needed to worry about being touched, or about people listening to him because they always had done. That had been a given. Draco supposed that was what Fitzgerald had stolen from him. His self-assurance.
They stand in the middle of that room, hugging and kissing while glimpsing around. “Imagine a past where we were friends,” Harry says, a grin creeping up his face at the idea. “Imagine I had visited you here and we’d fucked in your bed.”
and groans, then what looks like a
“Make me cum,” I said, and Harry laughed at the sudden prompt. But I only smiled at him and repeated my words at his amused grin. “Use your hands or mouth – whatever you like. But do it.”
“No,” Harry says quickly. “I like it. I listen to pretty much anything.”
Malfoy turned away after that, the thin light of his wand travelling into the night, leaving Harry behind until he woke from an odd pause of not thinking, not breathing. Then he made his feet move to follow Malfoy through the dew-soaked grass, “
“I’m looking.”
My heart skipped as I opened his profile, and I felt my breathing racing in my chest.
“Sure,” Harry says without thinking. Then he remembers that they are Muggles and that they’ll ask for a telephone number that he doesn’t have. “Erm . . . Thing is, I don’t have a number at the moment.”
“You’ll have to bring her,” Harry answered. “Perhaps it’ll give the two of you some ideas for when you’re planning our-“
“You don’t ever have to see him again, darling, not if you don’t want to,” Pansy said. “But you
Again, Draco nods.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, hugging Draco closer. Draco’s shaky hands fist the back of Harry’s shirt. “I didn’t mean to . . . You’re doing an amazing job. You’re good at it, and you repair things that mean a lot to people for all different kinds of reasons. It’s a good job, Draco.”
"Wait, you were always the one who put a ridiculous amount of time and effort into pranks."
The Mediwizard led us to a small side room. He opened the door and indicated that we sat in two chairs before he went to his desk. He spent a few moments leafing through the parchment papers in his desk before making eye contact with Draco once more. “Well, well,” he said, his stare taking in Draco’s form and lingering on his swollen middle. “A male pregnancy! I never thought I’d see the like in my lifetime. I’m going to assume that this is the other father?”
He pulled on his clothes, and located his wand. He spelled his belly clean with a
I should probably write a few sentences about seeing Mother and Father. After all, it’s why I started writing a journal in the first place. Was sort of the next best thing to seeing a Mind Healer.
I told him how good he felt. “Like I’m meant to take your prick,” I said, getting so much into that feeling of that glorious prickle I felt while sliding up and down his length.
The next morning, they had made their way into Muggle London for breakfast. The two of them crunched through the snow of Hyde Park. They settled down in a booth inside of a McDonalds, and Harry stood up to collect their order of Sausage McMuffins, tea and hash browns. Merlin but Draco's cravings were so powerful that his mouth was almost watering. He actually had to bite back a smile. His ancestors must be rolling in their graves! There he was, unbonded and pregnant, eating Muggle fast food with a Potter. This wasn’t the existence that he’d envisioned for himself, not ever before in his life.
The oldest Malfoy on the parchment—and Harry has to get on his knees and crawl forward a bit to see the upper end of the scroll—is one Armand Malfoy who was born 992 in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, France and died 1099 in Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire. “Wait,” Harry says, agitated, because he needs a moment to take in the information that Draco can track his ancestry back to the tenth century. That Malfoy Manor seems to be just as old even though Harry has no idea whether a house can get that old or if it was rebuilt at some point or not, or-
“Opine,” he mocked me with a snort, but he swallowed it when I seized his prick a bit tighter.
Harry kisses down towards Draco’s neck and his clavicles, sucking at a few spots of the pristine skin which evokes a soft chuckle from Draco. He lets himself slide down on his knees, past all the lines and past the remnants of the Dark Mark which he spots in his peripheral vision. He concentrates on undoing the buttons and the fly on Draco’s trousers, only feeling that he knows what he’s doing when Draco’s tented bulge is in view, covered only by the sleek fabric of his thin boxer shorts.
Ironically, the only thing that took my mind off my gloomy thoughts ever since the check-up was Potter. Of course! It’s always stupid Potter with his golden prick and his cooking dinner and cajoling me.
He sometimes can’t believe that this is his life. Draco and he vowed
All of Harry’s blood rushes south when Draco sits up and catches Harry’s wrists, pushing him down into the mattress. “Hands stay up there,
Draco does, and it’s true that Harry knows the song, even though he has no idea how or that it’s Bach. Draco seems to listen very intently, so Harry doesn’t interrupt him, but goes back to observing the little music box, unfolding it now while absently listening to the resonations of the harp.
Harry relaxes into the touch.
, you’re so . . .”
There was nothing for it. Harry was sitting there, so steady and unwavering, and Draco had been so very alone for so many months.
Draco holds his breath. Counts to five.
loved ones are like. For all I know yours might deck you out like a house-elf and parade you across Diagon Alley-”
Draco had to admit himself quite in awe at Harry’s artfully sneaky skills. Indeed, when Harry told Pansy that the salmon-and-cress hors d’oeuvres were the finest he’d ever tasted – and the witch had tittered in reply like a teenage Potter fangirl – Draco had needed to repeat to himself that Harry was only acting. The wizard wasn’t actually striving to win over his friends. He remembered Harry’s words from the day before:
front page,” she said. “So, what went wrong? You’ve had plenty of disappointing shags before. Remember that Minister? The one who turned out to be a weirdo? Wanted you to pretend to be Lucius, and-“
Draco goes back to work, and Harry goes upstairs to try and sort a few things away which were mostly clothes. While he digs through his few belongings, Harry thinks about the empathy glistening from Draco’s eyes just a few minutes ago, and he thinks about the phoenix perch that stands in Draco’s study and which is
Draco turns on his heels, taking a step towards the man who almost ducks at the sudden movement, the woman shrieks.
As birthdays went, this was going to be a quiet one. A few of their loved ones were coming over to celebrate with the three of them in the afternoon, but Draco wanted to keep their day low-key. They’d only just managed to get Daisy into any kind of routine, and neither wizard wanted to mess up their fragile arrangement.
“What’s that mean?” the man asks, gaze directed at Harry. “Tell him to stop using these, these, these-“
“I can do one better than that,” Draco answered, leaning back in the chair with a lazy smile on his face, and amusement evident in his expression. “What about dinner and a pint? You’ve had as much presence as a man made of smoke these last few weeks, and I’ve missed your face terribly, Potter! My hectic social life has gifted me a free night on Monday. Shall we make a night of it?”
Harry wakes, his muscles sore, his head buzzing with a pressing pain and a low beat that’s playing somewhere nearby. Light catches in thick curtains, painting the room a dim orange. Next to him, he finds the curve of a bare back, spine a gracious line and shoulder blades angular and lithe, attractive. Too devoid of freckles to be Ginny- no, Ginny was ages ago, right? Too skinny for Tarquin. Oh, but he is gone anyway. A stranger, Harry concludes.
“Draco, love,” Pansy said, sitting back down in her seat. Ordinarily Pansy was pretty, but her face was warped with disappointment and distress. “You weren’t raped. Don’t say the word. Don’t even
“You haven’t cum yet,” Harry protested, but moved up anyway.
Bloody do-gooder Potter. Draco bristled, hurt pride and sheer relief flooding through him.
Dudley would be upstairs, playing with his new toys, and that meant I could have time to myself. I’d eat a couple of slices of Christmas cake and give myself a belly ache. It was entirely worth it. I swear to Merlin, never in my life has any cake tasted sweeter.
"So . . . Draco." Another sob-laugh; Harry smiles. "What about you and karaoke?"
“Yes, I think so. Let’s see what the
Harry dashes forward and gets down next to the guy who stares at him in panic, eyes and mouth open wide. He doesn’t get a good angle next to him, so he straddles his hips and places both his hands on the bloke’s middle, briefly feeling where his rib cage end, and then he starts pushing into him, into the soft of his flesh, down and up. Down and up. Down and up.
Harry pulled me into a hug. I’m not sure whether we ever hugged before, except sometimes in greeting, but he hugged me as though his life depended on it. With his chin on my shoulder, he said, “That’s amazing, Draco,” which wasn’t at all what I had expected his first reaction to be. “I’m sorry about the circumstances in which it happened, but I've been so worried about you. You felt so poorly for the whole of December, and I feared that you were carrying some sort of malady. Instead, you’re carrying a little one in there. This is good news, Draco. It’s bloody brilliant.”
“Where’s the lube?” Harry asks, and Draco summons it.
, they’d kissed. Yes, he’d been left pregnant but no, he hadn’t asked Fitzgerald to wear a condom. There hadn’t been threats, or bruises, and there hadn’t been bleeding. It was a flimsy, fragile tale, but Draco was still pleased that he’d told it. It might not lead to an arrest, or charges, but at least the Aurors would have to speak to Fitzgerald. The Beater would know that Draco had finally decided to fight back, even though so many months had passed.
Harry feels his heart rate doubling over and his hands trembling, but he doesn’t dare say anything negative because Draco looks so happy every time he talks about Teddy. Harry can’t abide the idea of tainting that happiness with anything he would say only because he’s feeling so estranged.
and mused that it was time for Daisy to have her bath and go to bed soon. Which, in turn, set Harry into motion. Every evening, their routine was him giving Daisy a lovely bubble bath, Levitating her little rubber duck through the air together with a myriad of different-coloured suds. Seeing her laugh, her eyes full of wonder about the magical world surrounding her- it was honestly the best part of Harry’s day. It made Harry’s rib cage too small to contain his heart, and his busy day became a mere afterthought when he looked into her brown eyes and washed her white-blonde peach hair with a shampoo that smelled like crème.
Tarquin takes a long drag from his smoke, eyes glimpsing to Harry and back into the wintery night. “What do you do then?”
According to the few lines of text, Drake was twenty-five, a well-educated country boy, and he took cock like a champion.
Harry locked his gaze on me, looking very young and vulnerable with his beautiful green eyes. "I'm not sure if I know that. You loved me?"
– that Draco wouldn’t continue to meet his clients, but I can’t in good faith ask him to stop working.
I will need to relax now. Have to think about the baby. Mediwizard Bartsch said that my body’s reaction to a growth spurt was just a bit heavier than is considered normal, but that I needn’t be afraid. Just some rest, magical infusions, and happy thoughts.
Tarquin puts down the iron. His deep-blue eyes travel over Harry’s face for a moment, face open and somewhat thoughtful. Harry ponders whether he can kiss him or not; Tarquin often calls him cute before they make out. But before he can decide, Tarquin smiles at him and closes the few steps that separated them. After taking off Harry's glasses, Tarquin kisses his cheek and then his mouth, chaste and close-lipped, before shoving the spectacles back on the bridge of Harry’s nose, smoothing down his hair where the frames sit. “We still have some E’s, don’t we?”
With a wide-eyed look, pupils dilated, Tarquin raises his hand to his forehead, feeling for the injury and squinting his eyes when he finds it. "Guess so," he says, scrutinising the spot with careful fingers. Then realisation dawns in his face, and he snaps his fingers at Harry with an unexpected enthusiasm. "Yeah, yeah. Happened last night. I was helping Judith to climb the fence backstage, and she kicked me in the head." Harry still can’t believe that the two had made backstage, snacking on sandwiches and chugging down beers for a full three hours before being exposed, halfway through the set of the second support band, and kicked out of the whole venue.
“I just got you that book you wanted so badly. It feels like a stupid gift now,” Draco answers. He doesn’t want to think about how this battle will destroy him and Harry with it. No matter how hopeful Harry still is, it won’t last. That’s just the story of Draco’s life, and there is nothing they can do to stop it. Draco has to pay for what he did, and his debt is finally due.
“I keep thinking of it. Keep seeing in how much pain you were. I hate how I couldn’t help you back then,” Harry says. “I felt so helpless.”
When I reached the staircase up to the third floor, Hermione was waiting there with Ron, looking around the corner at Peeves, who was bobbing halfway up the stairs, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. I couldn’t believe she brought Ron. How where we supposed to use the cloak with him here?
Wormtail started a spell. It made the grave beneath me crackle and a small amount of dust rose into the air. It fell into the cauldron and the potion in it turned blue. Then Wormtail said something about the flesh of the servant and cut off his hand. He dumped it in the cauldron, turning the potion red. And then he walked towards me. His words frightened me, and I thought my end was there. He said: ‘blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.’
“Shut up and kiss me,” Harry signs back.
Professor Snape came by when I was in the hospital wing, demanding me to tell him who had tied me on that tree. I told him I wasn’t sure, that I had fallen asleep on my bed and woke up tied up. Professor Snape got angry at me then, really angry. He shouted: ‘How am I supposed to help you when you won’t let me. Mr Potter? I thought that by now you would know that you can trust me. I can’t do anything about the bullying if you don’t give me names, Mr Potter. But have it your own way. Just don’t come hunting me when they finally manage to kill you.’
“Just remember what will happen if you fail,” the Dark Lord says. He looks at Narcissa, a crooked smile on his face. Draco blinks and nods his head. Of course, it will not just be him who will die for his betrayal. The Dark Lord knows that there is no way Draco will manage to kill Dumbledore in the last two months of the school year. Draco will die trying. And his mother will pay the price. She will die at the hands of the Dark Lord. Her dead won’t be quick and painless. She will pay for their disobedient behaviour towards the Dark Lord.
Oh yes, that’s also something we just talked about. We are officially boyfriends now. Now I just need to find someone who can punch that silly smile of Draco’s face.
Oh, Ron is fine by the way. Hermione was able to bring him around and bring him to the hospital wing that night. They ran into the headmaster in the entrance hall and said that he had already known that I was down the trap door. That upset Draco. He said that it was terribly irresponsible from the idiot to let me go down there, I could have been killed. But I think the headmaster is a funny man, and that he wanted to give me a chance to face Voldemort. I’m sure by now that he even made sure I found out how the mirror worked so I would be prepared. That didn’t change Draco’s mind about the headmaster, he still thinks the man is off his rocker.
It is stupid and unrealistic. Harry knows this. But he can’t help it. He sits down at the back of the class during potions, just so he can stare at the platinum blond hair in front of him. Hermione and Ron have stopped trying to make conversations with him during meals, sure that Harry won’t hear a word they say. And they are right of course. Dinner is only useful because it gives Harry the chance to study Malfoy.
We are learning to use the Patronus Charm. It’s very highly advanced magic and he wasn’t sure if we could manage it. A Patronus is a positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon, like hope, happiness and the desire to survive. To conjure a Patronus you need to concentrate on a single, very happy memory. Draco nodded and I knew he had thought of a happy memory for him. I had some struggles to find one. I was happy when I flew a broom for the first time, but I don’t think that will be a happy enough memory. And then I just looked at Draco and I knew I had a massive amount of happy memories with him. Christmas afternoon came to mind and I knew I was happy then, but I didn’t want to get a hard-on while Professor Lupin was there, so I searched for another happy memory with Draco. We had some good times flying together this summer and during Quidditch practise so I decided to focus on one of those memories.
“Stop it,” Harry complains with a smile on his face.
Professor Lupin asks for a chance to explain and gave us all our wands back. He put his own wand in his belt and asked if I was now willing to listen. I asked him that if he hadn’t been helping Black, then how did he knew where we were. Lupin said it was because of the map, that he had been looking at it, knowing I would sneak out to go see Hagrid. He said he knew how to use the map because he was one of the people that made it. And he knew about my cloak because he had seen dad disappear under it a lot of times. And then he continued that he’d seen us come back from Hagrid with an extra person. We told him there was no other person, but he just continued that he’d seen on the map that Sirius had pulled Ron and the other person away. And then he asked to see Ron’s rat Scabbers. Lupin and Black said it wasn’t a rat, but a wizard. An Animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew.
Just that morning Draco and I had joked about the book Blaise had sent us, and now we are both thinking about it. About how better it might even be when we aren’t still wearing all our clothes. But also about how scary it all is. We’re only thirteen years old, isn’t that too young to start thinking of having sex? But on the other hand, I want Draco so much, want to be close to him all the time? I don’t know what to do now. I’m a little scared that Draco will want to do more now, and I’m not sure if I’m ready for that. I love kissing him, and what we did that Christmas afternoon, it was amazing and I want to feel like that again. But I don’t know if I want to start getting naked together. I wish I could really talk to you about all this, dad. I don’t want to lose Draco because I don’t want to take this any further, but I also don’t want to do something I’m not ready for. I know I should just talk to Draco about it, but I’m scared of what he will say. It’s not like anything has really changed. We still kiss all the time and I still want his hand in mine all the time. And we still have so much fun together. I just wish I knew if he wants to do it again, or if he wants to go even further?
The room turns quiet after that. Draco stares at the ceiling again. Another tear makes it way out of his eye, to slowly travel down. Harry wipes it away before it can drop down on the pillow. He kisses Draco’s cheek, his eyes, and then his mouth. It’s sweet and gentle. When Draco looks at him, he can see the moisture in Harry’s eyes. He hates that he put that there, caused Harry to feel this pain. So he does the only thing he can think of, he pulls Harry close and kisses him with more urgency until Harry forgets that they have lost James Scorpius Potter, until the only thing on Harry’s mind is Draco’s name.
I brought up Professor Moody. I still don’t like him, not after how he treated Draco. But Sirius says he’s a good guy, always tried to bring in the Death Eaters alive. He’s not a killer, according to Sirius. So, for now, I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt, even though I still think he’s crazy for blaming children for thinks their parents supposedly did. But Sirius trust him and I trust Sirius.
Harry’s hands are turning blue from the cold and he struggles to hold on to his broom. The Dementors come closer. Harry can see them now, even in the dark. Screams enter Harry’s mind. His mother’s screams. Of that night when she was tortured. Harry can hardly remember. He was too small to know what was happening. But now he can hear it all. The pain and despair of his mother. It makes it harder to concentrate. Which way is down?
I told Miss Davis that I’m good and that I don’t think I need any more therapy. She didn’t agree with me, so I still have to come back every Thursday after my classes and before dinner. It’s really annoying because I also have Quidditch practice at that time. I told Miss Davis this and she would look if she can find another afternoon to do this. Draco said Marcus wasn’t happy I wasn’t there for the first training this afternoon and that he would go look for another Seeker is I miss practice once a week. After dinner, Draco and I went to speak with Professor Snape and he assured me that he would take care of it. I hope he does because I would hate to be kicked off the team before I even get the change to really play.
“I thought you hated those?” Harry says. “Aren’t they sugar monsters that will kill me before I even turn forty?”
Malfoy stands up and Harry’s coffee floats to the desk. Two hands grab his cheeks and then Malfoy’s lips are placed on his. Harry smiles into the kiss which doesn’t last long enough if you ask Harry.
“The Quidditch World Cup,” James and Harry say in unison.
“No, I won’t,’ Harry writes down.
Ron snores as usual. He’s fast asleep. Just as Neville, Seamus and Dean. Only Harry lays awake in his bed. He’s had a nightmare. It started as a good dream. Harry was in the library with Draco. They were doing their homework. Their knees were touching and they kept smiling at each other. But then it all changed. Pettigrew was suddenly there. There was nothing Harry could do. Green light flashed around them. Harry looked at Draco. His head lay on the table, his eyes still open, but he was dead.
Yes, we all know, Draco loves me. But back to the point. Dobby has this believe that Draco and I will die a horrible death if we stay at Hogwarts. I don’t know why he’s worried since Draco is a pure-blood and I’m a half-blood. Until now only Muggle-born witches and wizards have been attacked. But there was no calming Dobby down. He threatened to bodily harm me if I would not go. And that is when Draco ordered him to never harm me in any way. Dobby bowed and said he wouldn’t, that he would never go against young Master Malfoy’s wishes. I wanted to ask him why we, in particular, were in danger, but Blaise came into the dormitory and Dobby disappeared with a loud crack.
“Because it’s my birthday,” Teddy tells Draco. “I’m four now, and on Monday I’m going to school together with uncle Harry.”
Draco was angry at Professor Lupin for saying that. That, of course, I took it seriously and that he had no right to say something like that. Lupin took ten points from Slytherin and then just turned around and walked away. I told Draco to drop it, that Lupin was right and that I should have never gone out. That I could have gotten Draco hurt or even killed by being out alone with him.
Thursday 9 June 1994
“No, Ron, fuck, it’s worse, okay. Just, please, I need to… Draco, he’s a mess. It’s all a mess right now. I promise I’ll explain tomorrow.”
It’s night when the Dark Lord comes to Draco’s rooms. Most of the Death Eaters have gone home, or wherever it is they go to spend the night. Draco puts down his book and strengthens the shields around his mind. The true battle is about to start. The Dark Lord doesn’t like to be kept in the dark. But there is no way that Draco will show him any of his precious memories about Harry. The Dark Lord won’t taint them with his hatred, Draco won’t let him. Harry was pure and good. He was the only person in this world who saw Draco for who he really is and loved him for it. And Draco won’t have anyone take that away from him.
“Uncle Remus, he’s been sick for a long time,” Neville says. “Ever since he got bitten by a werewolf when he was just a child.”
Like I was telling, we tried to convince Hagrid to let Norbert go, but he wouldn’t, saying it would die if he would set it free. And then I had an idea. Ron his older brother Charlie studies dragons in Romania. I asked Ron if we could send Norbert to him. Hagrid needed some convincing but soon realized that it would be the best change for Norbert. So Ron wrote a letter to Charlie.
After some time, Harry walks back into the room. He doesn’t say a word when he grabs a duffel bag and starts to push some of his clothes inside it. Draco can hear him sniff and he knows Harry’s cried. Draco doesn’t want Harry to leave. He wants him to stay. Draco loves him and will give him whatever he wants, if only he could. But now he needs to let him go, give him the freedom he deserves. Harry should be happy, not locked in a fruitless marriage that will only destroy him.
“Don’t think it goes that quickly, Neville,” Harry says. “Have you already forgotten about Ginny?”
“To what? Be a homophobic pure-blood?” Ron asks.
“Sorry, force of habit,” he says. “I’ve got a deaf husband at home, and he loves to know what I mumble about all the time.”
Malfoy shakes his head and then breaks off another piece of chocolate.
His body is cold. His skin paler then Draco’s has ever been. It has been hours and he still hasn’t moved. Draco doesn’t understand. He did everything the same, just like he remembered. Only it looks like it didn’t work. It looks like he’s dead and won’t come back to spend the rest of eternity with Draco. Draco blinks with his eyes. If he could he would cry, but it has been years since he shed his last tear. Since he took his last breath and walked in the sunlight. Draco has lost count of the decades he’s wandered the halls of Hogwarts, of the times he sat through seventh year, fooling everyone around him. He never minded living forever. Until now.
And then she was off. Ron, Draco and I followed her. Ron was worried Skeeter would go for Hermione next, but Hermione didn’t seem to care. She went on and on that Hagrid shouldn’t let Skeeter get to him and that he’s done hiding out in his cabin. She screamed at his door that he should open up, that nobody cared that his mother was a giant and that he couldn’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to him. And you should have seen her face when the door opened and Headmaster Dumbledore was standing there. He invited us in and we all sat down while the Headmaster summoned some tea and cake. He told Hagrid that we almost broke down his door because we still want to see him. We all agreed with him and told Hagrid that we liked him and didn’t care who his mother was. Draco pitched in that he understands, that there are a lot of students that don’t like him just because his father is Lucius Malfoy and that Hagrid shouldn’t let others get to him, but that he should show them that he’s his own person. And then he hit me in the ribs, motioning with his head for me to pitch in. So I told him I also couldn’t pick my family and that I had to live with the Dursleys who despised magic. And how nobody blames me for them.
Harry looks at the pictures on the mantle. Draco is present in almost all of them. He smiles at Harry from the top of a mountain in Iceland. He holds little Rose when she was just born. And he hugs Harry on the day of their first anniversary.
“You love me?” Draco asks. His movements are small, almost unreadable for Harry.
“Have you seen Neville?” he snaps at the girls. Their faces go blank as if they don’t know who Harry is talking about.
Harry knows he’s not dead. He can hear Iris' soft cries and Hermione telling her everything will be all right. Ron complains that he’ll be late for dinner. If this was heaven, they all wouldn’t be here. And his body hurts too much for it to be dead. His back aches and his head is pounding. Maybe if Ron would just shut up about dinner.
“You found something more important than beating Slytherin with Quidditch. You can’t be the real Harry,” Ron explains. Neville laughs and then looks the other way when Harry gives him an angry stare.
Harry looks down at Malfoy. He looks kind of peaceful now that he’s passed out. Harry wishes he would just pass out. That it would all be over. He wants his mother’s screams to stop. He doesn’t want to live now that all his friends are dead. He will never be happy again. It would be better if it was done. If Harry would die today at least he won’t have to live the rest of his life alone.
It wasn’t fun. When the Boggart was in front of Draco it turned into me, laying on the floor, face pale, blood leaking from my arm, my eyes open but unfocused. Draco started to cry and turned away. I rushed toward him and pulled him in my arms, telling him it’s not real, that I was still here, that I was okay. I heard later that Professor Lupin had stepped in front of us to distract the Boggart and that it had turned into a silvery-white orb hanging in the air and that then Neville got his chance to finish him off. I only had eyes for Draco, who was shaking in my arms. Professor Lupin dismissed the class and made sure Draco eat some chocolate before he let the two of us leave. He apologised to us, said he hadn’t expected anything like that, that he only had been worried that mine would turn into Voldemort.
The flying lesson is thought by Madam Hooch. She has yellow eyes like a hawk. We had to go stand next to a broom and hold out our hand above the broom and say up. My broom jumped into my hand at once, I and Malfoy were the only ones that managed that. Madam Hooch gave me a friendly smile and I felt proud of myself. Next, we got to mount the brooms and Malfoy got told that he was holding his broom wrong. He complained about that to Nott, saying that Hoochy had no idea what she was talking about.
Harry turns and walks out of the Great Hall. If nobody is going to help him, he’ll do it alone. Not that Harry has any clue on how he’s going to help Malfoy. But that won’t stop him.
“The little traitor. Not wanting to sleep all night and as soon as you pick him up, he’s gone. Next time he won’t sleep I’m calling you to come to babysit so I can sleep,” Pansy says.
“Fine, yes, I did something stupid. But not in front of the kid. Come on Draco, be the responsible parent.”
“Oh, that’s okay, Molly. I was wondering if you had made any lemonade. I would love two glasses if so,” Draco says.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. Neville has a point. Harry is hardly ever alone. He’s always been a people person who likes to have others around. But lately, it has been different. Harry is never alone because Draco is always there. In class, after class, during dinner. They spend all their time together. This time it’s Harry who blushes. He can’t help it. He likes being around Draco.
“You’re sure? He is from Slytherin,” James says.
DADA is different. Malfoy tries to sit in the back and just read the textbook, only Professor Lupin (who Harry by accident calls Uncle Remus in their first lesson) has a more hands-on approach than his predecessor Lockhart. Remus asks everyone to take out their wands and practice the Riddikulus incantation with him before he takes them to a cupboard holding a Boggart. It is clear that Malfoy doesn’t understand what is going on. He squishes his eyebrows together and he glances around the classroom.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispers.
It had been the best day of Harry’s life. The day Draco became his husband.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says again. A bit louder now and with more confidence. He’s genuinely sorry. “For all of it, the baby. I’m sorry I couldn’t keep him safe. I’m sorry I’ve destroyed our chance to be happy. You’ll be better off without me. You and Teddy both.”
“No, you wouldn’t,” James says. “But did it really have to be someone from Slytherin?”
And he keeps talking about how good he is in Quidditch and flying, ever since the notice for our flying lessons was posted on the notice board. He complains all the time that it’s unfair that he’s not allowed his own broom and that he’s not allowed to try out for the Quidditch house team. And don’t get me started about all the stories of how he narrowly escapes helicopters. And after every story he has to remind everyone that I don’t have my own broom and how I’m going to make a fool of myself in front of the Gryffindor’s, shaming the Slytherin house even more.
‘I’ll teach you,’ Harry writes.
That evening we had a massive party in the dungeon. There were Butterbeers and so many snacks. We celebrated until I couldn’t stand on my legs anymore. Draco carried me to our dormitory and Blaise shouted at us to remember to use silencing charms. We both laughed and once in bed, Draco took his time undressing me. He kissed me everywhere and I came inside his mouth. I thought getting jerked off by him was amazing, well I can tell you, having him suck me off is even better.
Harry James Potter.
“Oh, no, we can’t have that. What if the truth comes out that you are a big softy?” Remus teases.
Hermione is driving me insane! She has made herself a study schedule because exams are only eight weeks away. And she’s been bugging me, Ron and Neville to do the same. She’s been complaining about it for the last two weeks, saying the exams will be here before we know it. As if it isn’t bad enough already that we have stacks of homework for this Easter holiday. It’s been really hard to relax with Hermione reciting all her work or practising wand movements. I’m hiding from her right now. Malfoy thinks it’s very funny, he’s been trying to hide his laugh since I walked into the dormitory.
