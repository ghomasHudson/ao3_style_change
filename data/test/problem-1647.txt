1, 2, 3, Hermione, Ron and I start running and within a few seconds we are standing on the perron where the Hogwarts Express is waiting.
"How was your holiday Harry?" Hermione asks.
Wait… Oh no, I will see Draco at every class...
A loud moan escapes my mouth. My body shakes. Draco follows right after.
Harry turns around, what is he doing? Few second later he is speed walking to a seat on the other side of the classroom.
D POV
I smile, she is sweet. End of last year we started dating. I feel like I'm not being fair to her. Every cell in my body tells me to leave her. I feel the butterflies and blush when I think of him.
"Well, I decided to go for a walk, and I then saw you walking too. I didn't want to walk behind you, like some creep and decided to ask you if you'd, eh, like to walk together?" He said.
The following day it's Saturday. No classes. What means no Potter to deal with. I will have some time to catch up what I missed in classes the past days because of him. But nothing was less true. How can I ever focus when I keep thinking of him... I wonder how the game wil go.
I'm nervous, this afternoon we are playing quidditch against Gryffindor. Nothing is more hot then Harry trying to catch the Golden Snitch. Us racing against each other... I'm getting more excited. Goyle noticed and asked: "Jeez Malfoy where are you so happy about? Already thinking about the victory later this day, are you?"
While walking back to Crabbe, Parkinson and Goyle, I was wondering if Potter knew I touched his arm on purpose. Would he feel the same way? I wish I could tell him. Would I ever find the courage?
I'm getting ready. In a few minutes we will enter the field to play against Hufflepuff. They have gotten better over the summer. I feel like I have never been more nervous. If Draco is actually here watching. I can't lose!
H POV
I quickly turn around, take a deep breath and follow Hermione and Ron to some seats that aren't taken while staring at the ground. I can feel his eyes burning in my neck.
"I'm sorry Draco, think I'm just a bit tired."
After that we eat.
I feel that I'm blushing, he wanted to watch the game? My game?
D POV
I couldn't stop thinking about Harry though. It was almost like I could hear him? "Draco!"
Professor Snape interrups my thoughts by telling everyone to get off the train and go to the Great hall.
H POV
"Well, I feel like it was better then last year. But you know how the Dursleys are"... "I'm glad to go back to Hogwarts!"
Professor Snape interrupts my thoughts by starting his lesson. And I'm trying my hardest to focus.
Our teams walks into the arena. I'm searching trough the public. I can spot Ron and Hermione who are sitting together. Ron has his arm around her shoulder. It is sweet. They started dating at the end of last year. I smile and look further around me. There is Ginny. She waves. I wave back. A small wave though. I actually don't want Draco to see me wave. And then, there he is. He actually came! I can feel myself getting sick again. I try to focus and take position. I hear the start signal and my thoughts go to the Snitch. I want to impress him. So I need to focus!
D POV
3 lessons have passed. We have a lunch break now. I lost eye of Draco and have no idea where he is. Maybe for the better. I tell Hermione and Ron that I have to go to the toilet and meet up with them in the Great Hall.
"Did you use some kind of love spell or something?"
"Then don't stand in my way, Potter!” He snarls.
We spend the whole day talking, walking and we really got to know each other better. I still felt nervous, but it was way less and instead I felt mostly excitement. We even hold hands for most of the time. We decide to come back alone so no one would see us together.
"That's great Harry, remember that we are here for you. You want to watch a movie or so tonight?" Ron asks. I don't know what to say. "I slept really bad actually. Don't know why. So I think I'll go to bed early. You should go watch together though!"
I'm confused, Draco is being nice. Again? Does that mean... Does that mean he likes me too?
Later that night in Bed I decide not to tell them. Not yet. They will only judge me and that would ruin the night with Draco tomorrow. Suddenly i feel sick. Night with Draco, I've never been so nervous in my life... How will it go. What does he expect? I tried to sleep, but failed. Instead I kept thinking about wat technically would be tonight. Since it was 3.05 a.m. already.
I can see him look at me in the doorway. Potter, butterfly's storm through my stomach. Shit, I don't want to feel this. Make it stop.
Two days later, I'm about to walk in the first class of the year. The first class of Draco being in the same room for every class, and every day. I will definitely fail this school year...
H POV
I look up... Draco is standing in front of me and stares. "Potter! Don't you have glasses?? I feel like you should have seen me!" He snarls.
I haven't slept all night. I kept seeing Harry's face. I was so nervous for tonight. I feel like I acted very confident when I baslicly told Harry when and where to meet me. How will it go? What will we do together? Would it be akward?
D POV
When it's time to get up I meet with the others for breakfast. As usual the converstations at our table are pointless. After that I decide to go for a walk outside. It's October. So it already started to get colder. I can see my breath make little clouds in the air.
"Bloody hell Harry, have you seen a ghost?" Ron asks. "It was just Malfoy, I hope he and his gang will leave us alone this year."
It is 8.55 p.m. and I'm standing in front the door of the Room we agreed to meet. I wonder if Draco is inside already. I look around to see if nobody is there and walk in.
H POV
Ron and I agree, that sounds fun. Would be nice to have something to kill the time with. The time doesn't actually goes faster when you keep looking at the clock.
As I'm walking tot he toilet my thoughts go to Draco again. What was the look? What... OUGH!
H POV
D POV
Wait, it actually is him. "Harry? What are you doing here?"
"I, uhm. I acually really like you. Like, really like you. From the beginning we met. I'm sorry for giving you such a hard time the past years. I was scared you know?" I stare at the ground. Then I look at Harry. His face has gotten red. I stare at the ground again. "Can you please say something?" I ask. "I, uhm. I...”  I can hear him struggle. See, he thinks I'm an idiot. ”I like you too Draco.”
"How do we start training?" She flashes a smile at me.
Then go, quickly!
By the time Friday arrives, I am fully prepared to leave. I'm more than excited to see my godfather again, as well as learn more about being a wolf. Plus, the sooner I leave the Weasleys, the sooner I find my mate. I watch out of my window as Sirius and Lupin apparate outside the house. I go downstairs, even more excited than I thought I would be. Sirius hugs me as soon as I open the door.
Alex POV this time! Enjoy...
"No, of course not!"
I make my way to Ron's room, which we've been sharing this summer, and pull out a quill, ink, and parchment, and begin writing to Lupin.
"I know. But you're a good teacher, a great teacher, and I'm determined. I can do this." What I don't tell them is I plan to spend every waking moment that I don't spend actively training researching using the books Hermione sent me, and practising on my own. I won't look like a fool at school, I won't. I want to find a pack, like you said, and fit in with my kind. But most importantly, I want to be able to impress my mate, something that will never happen if I don't even know how to act. And so, we get started.
"I'd like that."
"Draco? You're a sub?" He doesn't say it like I thought he would. Instead he's gentle, caring. You smile.
"Really?" He wraps me in a hug, and I hug him back. "That means a lot, Harry, really. Thank you."
"You too."
"'Lexie, sweetheart, what's up?"
But... I want to see my mate now, I don't want to wait!
"We flew here from the station. Wanted to spread our wings after being cooped up in the train," Blaise explains, and I'm glad he didn't mention my anxiety. He sits down, but I remain standing, until he mumbles, "You may sit, Draco." I do so, blushing slightly. I realise I've become used to Uncle Michael giving me orders, having explained some dominants like to do so, not maliciously, just to maintain power. I expected to hate it, but I grew to depend on it. I appreciate Blaise for acknowledging this, and for doing it now.
"Ah. That would be your mate."
"And did you want to go?"
"Still think he wouldn't want to see me?" Zabini sighs. What does that mean? Is that bad?
"Thanks. Um, I was wondering... I've been having mate dreams, and I'm pretty sure he's at Hogwarts. I was just wondering..."
- submissive nature to hurt me. And then, inexplicably, what if my mate knew me? What if they knew me before, and hated me then, and don't give me another chance? What if they reject me? What if they reject me and ridicule me and hurt me and hate me hate me hate me? My mate can't hate me, they just can't.
You sound desperate. I can't blame you; so am I. I'm faster. I have better eyesight and sense of smell. I'll find him.
"Mate," he says, his voice nondescript, but simultaneously pleading and demanding. I can't help but whimper, and he sways towards me at the sound. "Please." I want so badly to go to him. It's like his voice is a tide, pulling me away from shore, away from safety. I can't let it. I shake my head, forcing myself to look away from him. He growls, and it makes my knees shake. "Mate, come here." It's not a request this time, it's a demand, and I can't resist it. I practically fall into his arms, and he immediately pulls me into his chest and wraps his arms around me. I feel safe, and I can't help but wish I could stay here forever. His scent engulfs me and I take in lungfuls of it, letting it calm me down. But then he pulls away from me, holding me at arms length. I try to look away from him, thankful he can't see me blush, but he tilts my chin back up to face him. "Talk to me, please. Why-" he seems to choke on his words. "Can't ask questions, okay. You don't want to come to me. Tell me why."
The day after not finding my mate in the pack, I can't help but be slightly down. Whatever little expectations there were, they were still there. And they were still dashed. It doesn't help that my mate pains have officially turned from annoying to painful. There's a constant throbbing at the base of my head, and my muscles ache the more I use them. Occasionally, my skin starts burning, but after a while, it fades away. I wonder if it's when I get close to my mate. I try to chase it sometimes but never get anywhere. I'm at breakfast, staring at a full plate and decidedly not listening to Ron and Hermione bickering, whilst instead watching Romilda Vane do a very similar thing across the table. I realise that it must be even worse for her than it is for me. She has met her mate, and after all, missing someone you know and love with all your heart is far worse than missing someone you've never met. The realisation does nothing to make me feel better. I don't think anything could at this point, aside from finally meeting my mate.
"So do you think anyone else went through an inheritance?" Hermione asks.
"I am yours."
I watch the sorting numbly, noticing a few firsties recognise me and Blaise from the entrance hall and continue their staring. When a couple join Slytherin, I clap along with my house, but don't even listen to their names. I find myself not as interested in the house system. My new nature does not lend itself to competitiveness. The sorting ends, and McGonagall gives her speech; much more suitable than Dumbledore's previous ones; before allowing us to tuck in. I wait, hoping for Blaise's permission again. I didn't realise how much I depended on the guidance of a dom.
"I- I need to ask. Please." And him begging is something else. He's so unbelievably submissive, and of course, he would feel more comfortable asking my permission to do things, he relies on me, I'm his dominant.
"It's no problem. You're a good hunter."
So he did think that. Oh, Draco, my mate. I will kill whoever caused him to feel so unworthy to think his mate would reject him.
When I get back to the house, much faster after my inheritance, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror as I tip-toe across the landing, and pause. I look different. It's nothing drastic, I'm still myself, but I'm definitely taller, maybe even taller than Ron, at least 6'3". My hair is longer, and my eyes seem even greener. I'm stronger, too, my muscles more defined even through the shirt I'm wearing. I look good.
"I thought we cleared that up, sweetheart. You fainted during your inheritance, and you have all the characteristics of a sub."
Mate.
"Yeah, but... he has an inheritance?"
I head up to the dorms to get Ron, who, surprise surprise, is still sleeping. I wake him up, wait for him to get ready (which for Ron is just shrugging on some casual robes) and we head down to the great hall. Half way there, we meet Zabini and Nev.
"Excellent. As I said, there are three species of Veela: séduisant, which are probably the most common; oiseau; and lastly, as Mr Zabini and Mr Malfoy are, alliage, or, as they are more commonly known, Royal Veela." He went on to explain what each of them were, and point out distinguishing features.
"Share?" His answer is an unrestrained grin, and I shift so the towel is around both of us. We dry off, then head back to the main room. My eyes snag on my 'nest', and the panic flies through me again, stealing my breath and bringing stinging tears to my eyes. But one look at Harry shows he's deliberately not noticing it, and just that calms me down slightly.
"Right, yeah, but if Malfoy- you know, the pretentious git- was one, wouldn't that be hilarious?" I growl lowly.
"You're meant to tell my mother I'm a dominant."
"How... how did you know I was going to-"
I put you on figurative mute, and take a breath. I've been wanting to ask a certain question for a while, but I never found the right moment. But I guess I'm kind of running out of time.
”Potter? Potter! You're there?” He waves in my face. "Uhm, yeah! Sorry?" "I asked when the next game is." "Sunday, we will be playing against Hufflepuff" I answer.
"Mate. Draco, you're my mate, my sub." My voice is so quiet, I can barely hear it, but I have no breath to speak with, and I'm not sure I will ever have any again. I have never been so happy. But then... Then, that beautiful, gorgeous grey starts to darken. I thought he was scared before. Now he's terrified. "Draco..." He's shaking, not just his hands, like before, but all over, quaking. He scrambles to his feet, eyes darting around the room. Looking for a way out. Backing away from me. I try to follow him, to try and calm him down, because he's so scared and he can't reject me, I won't let him. "Draco, wait. Please stop." But he doesn't listen - why isn't he listening to me? - and keeps backing away, further and further, until he reaches the window. I don't realise what he's about to do until it's too late - stupid, stupid - and so I can't stop him as he opens the window and leaps out of it. I'm left alone with silence. The only sounds are the thumping of my breaking heart and your deafening howls echoing in my mind.
He spins around, either scenting me or hearing my breath, and his eyes light up when he sees me, with more joy than anyone has the right to feel at the sight of me. Well, apart from him. He deserves to feel all the joy in the world. But I made him look like that. I made him that happy. My heart soars. I hold my hand out, scared that if I speak it will come out choked. He grins wider than I would have thought possible, before quite literally flying into my arms, his wings lifting him off the ground before he barrels into me.
I unlock Bernie's cage, having received the key after last year's birthday, and attach the letter to his leg. It occurs to me whilst doing this that I should probably write to Hermione as well, who has been staying with her parents this summer to help them get their memories back, so I ask Bernie to please wait. Bernie's much like Hedwig in the fact he requires a polite owner.
I promise. Of course.
"Almost more than I was. He's different, Draco. He doesn't care about your past, all he knows is that you're a sub and it's his job to protect you. Trust me, aside from myself, he is the least likely to hurt you." It reassures me somewhat, I no longer feel terrified at least, but I can't help but feel sceptical. I know for a fact that Potter hates me, and to be honest, I don't blame him. So why would he be worried about me? I just don't understand. "I should get back. I don't like leaving my mate so long. I'll see you in a bit, okay? Shouldn't take too long."
"I can imagine."
Nothing, don't fret. We kissed, like once. It wasn't a big deal. We never went further and we never technically dated.
Exactly that's the-
Exactly. Plus, even if we don't know what he looks like, it's still narrowed down! There are only a few male subs in the school-
"I get that he's scared, I understand why. I thought he just needed time, but now I'm not so sure. It doesn't seem like he even wants to find his mate; I didn't even know he was having mate dreams until his Veela told me this morning. He's paranoid that everyone still hates him, that any dom is going to abuse their power over him. Sometimes I think seeing you would actually be good for him."
"Stop it," Nev mumbles. We start heading up to the castle in silence, before Neville asks, "we have to go see McGonagall, right?" I groan. I had forgotten about that.
Draco meets his uncle...
I keep going, faster than I've ever flown before. I don't know where I'm going, I don't even know where I am with the tears that are obscuring my vision. I just want to get away. I realise that the muscles in my wings are aching, burning, when I falter in the sky. I almost fall, but force my wings to keep flapping. It hurts, but not as much as rejection will. I know I can't fly for much longer, so I start letting myself drift lower, trying to find a gap in the trees. When I do, all I can bring myself to do is collapse, wrapping my wings tight around me and finally let the tears overcome me. Now that I don't have air rushing past me or muscles protesting, all I'm left with is the pain of deserting my mate. And fuck, fuck, it hurts. More than anything, more than the cruciatus, more than my inheritance.
"Draco."
"I don't hate you."
"It's fine. I probably overreacted a bit, but don't insult subs, okay?" He nods.
"You may eat, Draco." I nod, and do as he says. Somehow, the food tastes better for his permission to eat it. I know it doesn't sound like a healthy relationship by regular wizard standards. But his permission let's me know I'm doing the right thing, means I don't ever need to worry. It's freeing, rather than constrictive. I didn't realise until now how much my late start put me at a disadvantage. Emma didn't act nearly as submissive as I do now, she just found comfort in my uncle. But every little thing scares me. The thought of making Blaise angry, or worse, disappointed, makes me feel physically ill. I look to him before doing anything.
It's a hard match. But one hour, a few scratches and bruises after we started I am able to catch the Golden Snitch. We won!! Yes!
"Draco?" ”Yes?” He said "Uhm, eh, will you come watch? N... not me, just the team?" "Eh yeah sure, I think I can come watch you Harry, uhm… the team I mean." He walked away.
My heart is pounding. I just came back from the most amazing walk with Draco. Draco, of all people. And he actually liked him back. We talked so much. It was amazing. I still feel nervous for tonight. Will that be just as great?
Luckily professor Snape starts the lesson. I'm praying that i'll be able to concentrate. Pissing off Snape isn't something I want to deal with right now.
Draco takes off my t-shirt and looks at me. He then goes back to kissing and moves down from my neck to my right shoulder. I take off his green Slytherin tie and slowly unbutton his shirt. I can feel him tense. "Is this okay?" I ask. "I don't want to scare you away." He says. He helps me take off his shirt. Showing what his long sleeves are hiding. "I'm sorry you are hurting." I say. And I pull him closer to me and hug him I can feel Draco relax again and after a little while of standing in eacht others arms he kisses me again. I softly touch his arms. His hands taking off my belt and then my pants. Showing my dark green boxers. He smiles. We move to the couch. I push him backward and am now on top of him. We kiss again, I move back to his neck. And bite him playfully. He moans softly. Going back to kissing, moving down to his stomach. He takes off my boxers. I'm now taking off his pants. And boxers too. "You are okay with this?" He asks.
When Snape finish his announchement I can feel Potter staring at me. My heart races. Every class... I couldn't help thinking about our moment in the train. I can't figure out the way he was looking at me. I want to say he looked like he felt something too. But it was probably just fear. The whuss. The guy fights Voldemort, but is scared of me. How ironic.
Dumbledore's voice speaks loudly. "Dear Hogwarts students. Please give a loud applause for today's players and let the game begin!"
We arrive and with a loud sharp sound the train stops. As we are about to get out of the train cabine, Draco is walking my way hitting his elbow agains my ribs. "Ough!"
Our teams leave the field and after showering and changing into clean clothes I go find Ron and Hermione. I find them in the hallway talking. "Hey Harry! You were great! Congratulations! Did you see Draco's face when you caught the Snitch? It was great!" Hermione laughs. Her face gets serious all of a sudden and I look behind me. Draco is standing there. "Potter, can I speak to you for a moment? Alone?" Ron and Hermione look at me, i nod and they walk away. "We will be in the library Harry." Ron says. That's okay! I'll see you guys there." I respond.
I can feel my face turn red again. But she seems to ignore it.
"Oh okay, we'll do that then. Do you want to hang out right now though? I heard dinner is an hour late so we will have to be there around 7.30 a.m. We will have enough time to play a game if you two want?" Hermione says.
I smile. "Yes". I take a moment to admire the person I see. "You are beautiful". "So are you." he says. We kiss again and I can feel him touching me. I do the same. I can feel that my heartrate goes up. I can hear him breathing and feel his hot body against me. His hands start to move a bit faster. I moan and I follow to do the same. "Faster." he whispers. I can feel our bodies tense, while we keep kissing. "Faster."
"You like someone else don't you? Did you ever liked me?" She says ”Ginny, I'm sorry. I didn't want for this to happen. I do like you. I just think, not in that way. I'm sorry. I thought I did. You mean very much to me!" I take her hands. She pulls them back. "Who is it? Tell me, I have the right to know!" She is a bit angry now. "I'm so sorry Ginny. I never meant to hurt you. I'll tell you. But you can't tell anyone. Not yet. And promise not to laugh. I know you are angry. And you have the right to be. But please promise." I can se her looking confused now but she nods. "It... It." "Jeez Harry say it!" She almost yells. "It's Draco" and I stare at the ground. Total silence. Then I hear a giggle. "You promised not to laugh!” I'm sorry, I'm sorry" she giggles. "You are serious aren't you?" She hugs me. Now I'm confused. "I always thought there was something going on between you two! I thought I was wrong when you said yes to dating me." She says. I'm lost for words and she continues: "I can't be mad at you now. I actually am happy for you." She turns red. I have been wanting to talk to you too for a while now... I look at her. She continues, "I think i'm in love with someone else too. I have been denying it to myself. But since you have the courage to tell me. I feel like I should be honest too." I'm baffled. She then says "I think I'm in love with Luna..." I smile. "Thank you for telling me Ginny, I'm sorry if I hurt you." "It's okay Harry” She says. "Thank you for trusting me and telling me this. Will we be friends?"
"You don't mind coming to Slytherin?"
"I think he must be. My first mate dream was on the train, and I've had a couple since then. Thing is, werewolves can be mated to wizards as well, so he could literally be anyone."
You think they're here?
I appreciate the effort, I really do. After all, it's important for regular wizards to learn about the different inheritances and how to act around people who get them. But I would really rather not be here. I do, after all, know everything they are saying and more. And with such a good alternative (spending time in a mate dream with my mate, for example), I would give anything to not be here right now. However, it's interesting to see who has an inheritance, and I pay attention for that reason. Being a small year, there weren't that many; only two from Hufflepuff (Ernie Macmillan, a dominant fire elf and Zacharias Smith, a dominant Coraniaid) and two Ravenclaw (Terry Boot, a submissive vampire and Morag MacDougal, a sub Draconi). I try to catch Terry and Morag's eyes to see if either of them are my mate, but can't, as they're both looking down.
"That means a lot."
"I'm so happy for you, Neville." I am, I really am. But just because I'm happy doesn't mean I can't be jealous as well. I would give anything to find my mate, too.
"It's my pleasure." She pauses, smiling softly at me. "It is really great to meet you."
They won't start hunting until sundown, idiot. There's no point in going down until then, and besides, I've got work to do today. I left all my homework until this weekend, and now I have heaps of it. Just because I'm a werewolf doesn't mean I don't take my N.E.W.T.s.
"How is Draco taking being a sub?" This comes from Blaise. He sounds concerned.
"Just answer my question!"
"Well, there's a simple explanation for that, beautiful." In reply, I rub my cheek against the palm of his hand. "It's insane how much I missed you in half an hour. Merlin, I thought I might die."
"I don't want to go down to the hall. Too many people."
"I dare you to go and ask!"
"Ha! Draco Malfoy, king of over-confident pricks, a submissive! Imagine!" Ron says, laughing, and I feel you getting angry again. I learnt that it's in most dominant creatures' instinct to protect any and all subs, even those who aren't their mates. But I didn't think we would get this defensive at such a small comment, about Malfoy no less.
"Okay, that's more than okay, my love. Whatever you need. You have my permission to speak throughout this whole conversation, is that okay?" I nod, finally sucking in breath. "Good boy, you're so good for me." I chirp happily at his praise, nuzzling further into the hand that's still on my cheek.
"Is it... is it scary, being a submissive? Knowing they could have that kind of control over you?"
I've felt pain before, more times than I would like to remember, but this is unlike anything else I have ever felt. It feels like every inch of my skin is splitting open, all my bones are breaking in every place and then being fused back together just so they can break again. It feels like all the air in the world has been compressed into the 10 centimetre cubed radius around my head, putting so much pressure on it I feel close to imploding. It hurts so much I find myself begging whatever god there might be to let me pass out, to let me die even. I just don't want to feel this anymore.
"Aren't those the guys with wings?"
"What are you talking about? I'm a Malfoy, I can't be a sub."
"F-fine." A lie. "Th-thank you. Again."
"You're my chick. You needn't thank me." You beam, and Mother heads to the downstairs living room to use the fireplace. I can't believe you just did that.
"Tired, mostly. It's draining not being near my forest." Dryads like Romilda have a specific tree to which they belong, and can only truly re-energise when in the forest to which that tree belongs.
"Aunt." She whimpers, tears filling her eyes.
"You weren't exactly subtle. And I guess I would have done the same thing."
"No, I think I know that guy! Isn't that Draco Malfoy? He was in the Daily Prophet with his family; I think his dad was a death eater!" My heart sinks. I didn't want this. I don't want to be thought of as Lucius Malfoy's son. I loved my father, I still do, but he made some wrong decisions, decisions that made me make the same ones, ones I regret with every fibre of my being. If I'm known of as Lucius Malfoy's son, I'll be known of as a death eater. I thought the knowledge of who I was would deter them, but it seemed to make them more interested, and before I know it, the three of them have found their way over to us; two boys and a girl. They seem to be quietly arguing over who should speak first. I see Blaise smirk, obviously realising what's going on.
"Wouldn't miss it," Neville says. "I want to go down to the forest anyway, it energises me."
You cock your head at him to repeat the question, and he chuckles. Just that sound makes me forget why I was upset in the first place. Was I even? How could anything possibly be bad when my dominant is making that noise?
I curl up in my makeshift nest, but I can't help but hate it. I didn't spend time on it, for one, and it's not the right shape at all. It's only made of my duvet and comforter as well, so only smells like me, when it should have something from everyone I care about. And a lot from my mate. It should scent more like him than me, and I hate that it doesn't. The worst thing, though, is that he's not in it. A nest is something to be shared, and alone it feels empty, making my mate-pains even worse, and making you even more upset.
I am.
"If you want we can go up to my dorm and I'll keep you there forever, just us, my precious treasure."
"Your turn." Oh.
Find him.
"Whatever role you are, you will be happy in it, whether you believe it now or not. It's how your inheritance works," Mother says with a sigh.
"But wasn't your mum a muggleborn?"
"Please." I think I'm crying.
"You're not the only one who hates me. Or, I thought you did." Anger.
I know that this hurts you; I can feel you getting increasingly timid the more I think of rejection. And I'm sorry, but I can't stop.
You rush past the pair, but the Veela grabs your wrist, stopping you. You growl again, even louder than before, louder than I've ever heard you growl, baring your canines, releasing your claws and standing tall over him. Immediately, he lets go, whimpering once and ducking his head in submission. Good. It's time he knows his place. You give him one last glare, sparing a glance at the elf, who I realise has sunk to his knees behind his mate. Part of me doesn't like that you scared a submissive so much, but the other part thinks it serves him right. He shouldn't have let his mate try to stop us getting to my 'Lexie. Even as I'm thinking this, you're rushing out of the house common room - houses, what a stupid system - and upstairs.
Yeah, it's huge. There are actually rumoured to be other werewolves in there.
I have trained my whole life to be what I am- a dominant Veela. But somehow, it doesn't feel right.
"I knew werewolves were big, but I didn't expect... this!" It's true, I'm not surprised she's shocked. You're actually higher than even Ron's hips; if you stood on your hind legs you could rest your front paws on his head, easy. Compared to Hermione, who's fairly small... well, I'm not surprised she's shocked.
Okay, okay. I was wrong, I get it. Shit. What are we going to do?
"We're good?"
"Because you were hurt, Draco, and I wasn't there to save you."
"I'm here, darling, I'm here."
"Stay here, Alex. I'll see what's going on. Don't move, okay? I'm not going far, just outside the carriage." You nod, not making eye contact. Blaise pokes his head outside the compartment door, and I hear his conversation with someone who obviously did the same, due to my enhanced hearing.
My mate is... gone? No, no, no, my mate, my 'Lexie wouldn't leave me. No, no, no. He'll come back, he has to come back, I'm his mate, his dominant. He has to come back to me. He can't reject me, he... he can't. I'm his mate. He can't reject me. But I can feel the pain of it ebbing through me. Not like a river because rivers are wet, damp. You fall into a river and it is quiet, calm. This is not any of those things. This is raging and loud and burning. This is fire. This hurts. Mate.
He keeps walking and disappears out of my eye sight.
I look at him, he must be joking! But his face is serious. Butterflies are storming trough my body again and I feel like my face must been even more red than Harry's. ”Re... Really?" I stutter. He nods. "Do, do you want to hang out?” I ask. "I should talk to Ginny first." He says. I thought I liked her. And I do. She is sweet. But not like that... She deserves the truth." I look at Harry and nod. "So, tomorrow night then?' Meet me in the Room of Requirement at nine?" I ask. Harry blushes and agrees. "Cool, see you then." And I walk away. I should have kissed him...
The rest of the train ride I couldn't stop thinking about his hair. He did indeed was even hotter then he was last year.
"Okay, well good luck then!" He said and walked past me. This time our hands touched softly.
What I don't tell them is what made it better. The Dursleys were worse then ever. So it wasn't on them.
I'm trying my best not to scream and look too happy. They won! I'm actually so proud of Harry. It seemed like a painfull match. The seeker from Hufflepuff played agressive and Harry looked tired.
On that note our Slytherin players take position. I'm now right across from Harry. We share a quick look before we hear the start sign. In a split second he races after the Snitch and I start chasing Harry. Slowly getting besides him and take the lead after. This goes on for about ten minutes before he pushes me to the side. I push back. For a minute I forget about the Snitch and Harry takes his chance and is able to catch it.
Ron and Hermione are walking in front of me. I'm nervous. When we arrive at the door I can already see him sitting there. He turns his head and looks at me. There it is, the same look as in the train. I feel my cheeks getting red. OH NO.
"Harry! Hey! Where have you been?" Hermione waves at me. I can see her sitting outside with Ron. "Uh."
"Yeah, no problem. You played very well again. Does it hurt though?" I softly touch the bleeding scratch on his face. I can see him tense but he doesn't move away. I take back my arm and decide to go for it. "Harry, can I tell you something? You have to promise not to tell anyone. Okay?" "Sure, okay." Harry nods.
D POV
But at the same time I see a twinkle in his eyes. I blink. He walks past and I wonder if I imagined the twinkle. Is he...?
H POV
Potter asked me to come watch the game. What would he mean by that? How can I find out if he likes me too? Should I just ask? What if he doesn't. In the end he and Ginny are a thing. So why would he be with her if he doesn't like her? Can't blame him though, for not liking me. I haven't particularly been nice to him in the past... He will probably tell everyone at Hogwarts.
D POV
I lay in his arms in front of the fire place while he strokes through my hair. "Are you happy, Harry?" He looks at me. "I couldn't be happier this exact moment." I say and smile. He smiles too. "Yes, me neither."
It was 4.00 p.m. now. It was a great way to spend the morning and afternoon. I again wish that I had the courage to kiss him when we said goodbye. Maybe tonight though...
"A werewolf. A dom." Of course he fucking is. The one person who probably, understandably, hates me the most is in a prime position to... I don't know what. Hurt me, humiliate me, ruin me. Salazar, what the fuck am I meant to do? Unlike me, he was probably paying attention this morning, and saw me go up. Harry fucking Potter knows I'm a sub, and a pathetic, whimpering, scared one at that, and he's a dominant. Blaise can see the fear in my eyes, or smells the change in my scent, because he says, "Potter won't abuse his dominance, if that's what you're scared of. You should have seen him, all he could talk about was you after he saw you run out of the hall this morning. 'Is Draco okay, have you seen Draco, how is he, do you think I should check on him?' Literally, he is one of the most obnoxiously chivalrous guys ever."
"Just trousers, please?"
Yeah, yeah I know what my name means. I've had it for eighteen years.
"That's the first time you've said my name."
Ah, okay. Right, I think I get it.
"I think it would be good for you. You need to understand that if not everyone, dominants want to help you. You need to find your mate, Draco."
"Some inheritances have many different kinds. Elves are a good example of this, as there is a type of elf for each element, although fire, water and nature elves are the more common kinds. Are there any elves in the room?" Two people stand up: a fire elf from Hufflepuff, who I realise is probably the one Blaise spoke to on the train; and a nature elf from Gryffindor a few moments later. I realise with a jolt of surprise that it's Longbottom. The fire elf is a dominant, and I consciously avoid his gaze, in case he's my mate. If we make eye contact, he'll realise, and my goal of avoiding them would be for nothing. "Please make your way to the front." They do so, and the speakers look pleased. "Excellent, excellent, thank you. If I am correct, here we have a dominant fire elf and a submissive nature elf. You can see the similarities in them, with the bone structure, pointed ears and hair texture, however there are clear differences, some due to the fact that they are different kinds and some because one is a dominant and the other submissive. We'll go onto dominance and submission in the second portion of this talk.
Right. I get that. After all, so am I. Tired of fucking waiting. I lie in bed for a while, revelling in the aftermath of the dream, and hoping the aching will fade. It doesn't; if anything, it gets worse the more I think about him. Eventually, I force myself out of bed, and cast a quick tempus. I groan. It's almost dinner, and the talk must be over by now. I'm not in the mood to go down to the great hall, so instead I head outside towards the forest. I figure I'll let you out and you can hunt for dinner.
"Could all seventh and eighth years please stay behind after breakfast. Thank you."
You sound almost insulted. If you were anyone else I wouldn't tell you, but the thing about having someone in your head is that you can't hide anything from them.
"You're awake." It's Blaise. He must've stayed with me whilst I slept. I nod. Like you, I don't feel like talking. "It's almost dinner. Do you want to go down to the hall?" I shake my head no. "You sure? I don't want you cooped up here forever." For a second I think he's unhappy with me, and it terrifies me. I must look like it too, because he immediately comforts me. "Hey, it's okay. You haven't done anything wrong. Stay as long as you need, but only need, okay?" I nod my head yes. "Good sub." I let out a chirp, and blush at the sound. "Mateo wants to hunt." Like birds of prey, which most Veela are related to, we need to hunt on a regular basis, particularly doms. "Do you mind if we catch something for you instead of grab something from the hall?" I shake my head no, I don't mind. "Okay. I'll be back in a while. Sure you don't want to come?" I nod, and he releases his wings and leaps out of the window.
"So gorgeous," I murmur. "What's on your mind, gorgeous? Talk to me."
I manage to blink my eyes open, and immediately slam them shut again as the light almost blinds me. Daylight has never been this bright, Merlin. I try again, slowly, and am greeted by Mother sitting on the edge of my bed, smiling widely, wings flittering with excitement behind her.
I'm sorry. I just... I'm on edge.
"Said what?"
He's talking to you, 'Lex.
I can't Alex, I can't.
"Emphasis on the past tense. I only did because I was young and stupid and I didn't understand the pressure placed on you. But I understand now. I only wish I had then, and maybe I could have helped..." I want to keep going, but he cuts me off.
"They... they'll judge me, like the first years, and everyone h-hates m-me bec-cause I was a d-death eater... no one was mean b-because they were scared of m-me, b-but now... now I'm pathetic."
"Who's there?" The voice chuckles.
The seminar begins with an explanation of the different possible inheritances one could receive, and an explanation of what each creature is. It becomes evident quite quickly that they intend to use those of us who have gone through inheritances as examples, something you are rather uncomfortable with, and Blaise is obviously angry about. They start off by going through the rarer inheritances, such as Shiwana and Drachael, which no one has received. Eventually, they get on to the more common ones, and go into more detail, starting to ask people to come up so they can demonstrate.
I want to reply, say no, I love you, and so will our mate, but Blaise interrupts.
"What about you?" Another says, gesturing to me. "You haven't said anything; that's not very dominant." I gulp, looking to Blaise, who nods, indicating I can speak.
I have to force you to the back of my mind to stop you from taking over, and even that is almost too much to think about. Because my mate could be in this room. I practically push Nev and Zabini out of the way, rushing into the common room and scanning it. Several heads look up, confused, but I don't care, and neither do you. I keep looking around, and feel my heart sink with every passing second I don't find him. Where is my mate?
"Who is she, Harry?" The ginger girl - Ginny - chimes in. She actually sounds interested, rather than jealous or mocking like I might expect. She did have feelings for you, right? But still, the use of female pronouns annoys me. Is she suggesting our mate should be female? That it's wrong to have a male mate? That Draco isn't good enough? Because he's more than good enough, he's perfect, and she can shove her 'she' up her-
"You're welcome. Why don't you go to sleep? There's still a couple hours to go." I nod, trying to relax.
Once I reach the edge of the forest, I strip my clothes off and let you out, and get pushed to the back of our mind. You shake, wincing when the movement hurts slightly. Apparently the mate-pains affect you too.
"He's a sub, Ron," I reply, my words clipped. If he says anything offensive I don't think I'll be able to restrain from hurting him. I watch his eyes widen, and he opens his mouth, but I growl at him and he closes it again.
"Hi! I'm Narcissa, it's so nice to finally meet you."
I don't know. I didn't even know my parents were werewolves, or my dad, I guess. My mum was a muggle-born, so she wasn't, right?
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" A new voice. The Gryffindors turn, revealing a dominant fire elf. He's a Hufflepuff from my year, the one Blaise spoke to on the train. I think his name is Macmillan. And he looks angry. His eyes are a flaming red and there's flames on the tips of his fingers.
. Anyway, I realise his shirt is almost stiff with dried blood, so I remove it, trying not to wake him, then wrap his cloak back around his shoulders so he doesn't get cold. His body is truly breath-taking. His skin is even paler where it is usually covered by clothes, and softer too. His collar bones and hip bones jut out, and I find myself tracing them with the tips of my fingers, making him whine quietly in his sleep, and I know if I keep going and he keeps making that noise I'll do something I'll regret.
"I love you, Mother. Thank you."
"Look how pathetic he is, can't even stand up for himself. Probably realised he fucking deserved it!"
"Do you think he would mind if I went to see him? It's just, my wolf hated seeing him like that, and won't shut up about making sure he's alright and safe." A
"Don't you have a big scary dominant to protect you?" It's taunting me, it can scent that I don't. Probably trying to get under my skin. I try not to let it, but it works. I whimper, seeing flashes of my last mate dream where he - Potter - held me close and whispered comforts in my ear. "Oh? You don't have a mate? How sad. Well, I suppose that means there's nothing to save you when I take you back to my lair to gobble you up, pluck you like a chicken. I wonder if you taste like one too? I hope you don't mind, I like to play with my food." The chimaera grabs one of my wings in its teeth - which hurts like, well, like razor-sharp fangs stabbing my wings - and tugs me onto its back, all in one movement. My scream makes the chimera chuckle. "There's no point in screaming, little Veela. There's no one here to hear you." I think that's what breaks me. How alone I am. I don't even have you anymore, Alex. No one will ever know what will happen to me, and, maybe worse, no one will care. Blaise is probably the only one who will even realise I'm missing, and even then he'll be better off without me. He'll finally be able to worry about his own life and submissive rather than one that latched into him like a parasite because he was too fucking scared to find a dom of his own. And then: I'm going to die without a mate. And then I'm crying, and the chimaera is chuckling, and I'm alone alone alone.
"Submissives?" I say, cutting her off, which immediately makes me feel bad for being rude, but I ignore it. Why did she compare me to a sub?
The first thing I notice is the sheer number of people. The den is in a large clearing, shielded with boulders and ferns that cut it off from the rest of the forest. In the centre is what appears to be a fighting ring, where two dominants face-off currently. From the outside it looks vicious, but neither appear hurt and both are grinning. In one corner there's a pile of food, some of which has just been caught. There's a fire burning next to it, the only light in the den apart from the rising moon. But everywhere, everywhere, is people. Some are in human form, some have given their wolf control, but they're everywhere. Some of the subs have made nests, where they huddle with their pups and doms. Groups of people sit talking, but they're close, some on each other's laps and others with arms wrapped around another. People come to greet the Alpha as we walk in. People turn when they scent me, an apparent rogue, but relax when they see I'm with the alpha because they trust him. People play with their pups, and pups play with each other. There are people, wolves, everywhere. And each and every one of them looks happy. All I can think is that I can't wait until I have a pack. The more I gaze in astonishment, the more I notice that there are some people who aren't wolves. There are a few dryads, some nature elves, a Veela. And each non-wolf has a wolf - their mate - wrapped around them.
"Cool! Can you tell who they are?"
"That empty feeling is the beginning of mate-pains. Unfortunately, they'll only get worse from here on out."
"Speaking of Draco, how is he?" I ask, not caring how weird I sound. After all, like Zabini said, he understands the need to protect him.
"Draco..." he says, his voice full of pity. I hate it. I don't know what I want, but it isn't his comfort. That's for my mate to give me. I try to push the thought from my head. I don't need my mate. But nevertheless, I don't want Blaise to try to comfort me. And even if I don't know what I do want, he seems to. "Sub," he growls, and I whimper in response. I realise it isn't him anymore; he gave his Veela control. "Come." I scramble towards him and sit at his feet. "Good sub." He begins to pet me, stroking my hair, and I chirp subconsciously. "Breathe, sub." At his order, I find myself able to take the deep breath I had been trying to take before. "Good, now relax." I let the tension leave my shoulders. "Look at me." He lifts my chin, and I let my eyes drift to his. "Tell me what's wrong." The words fall out of my mouth before I even understand his order.
My mother and uncle leave me and Emma alone. She seems to have relaxed a bit, presumably because she knows there is no unmated dominant around her. Emma is pretty, there's no doubt about it. She has long, chocolate brown hair curled delicately into ringlets, and wide hazel eyes. Her skin is on the darker side of caramel and her frame is delicate.
- You were about to, though.
You yell. I don't like it when you yell.
"He is not being pathetic. He is scared and his instincts are in control," I say, trying to stay calm, but the words still come out as growls.
"Lastly, of course, any school rules that contradict your specific creature's laws do not apply. For example, many creatures permit extreme violence if defending your mate, and so the school rule against violence will be temporarily lifted if this is the case. I would, however, discourage the use of violence, and instead would encourage you to come to me if any of your classmates... offend you in anyway, and allow me to punish them appropriately.
Why would I do that? I would never do that!
"You sure you're okay?"
"Shouldn't be allowed to roam free after what you did. But I guess you're too pathetic to do anything now aren't you, submissive?"
"Draco, I want you to see him."
"When your schooling is up, at the end of the sixth month, you can join us, if you please." The offer takes me by surprise, and joy jolts through you at the thought of having a pack, enough that I almost say yes before I catch myself.
You seem guarded, probably assessing her threat level.
I don't trust you. I feel you wince at that, and frown. Why do you care if I trust you or not?
"Of course."
"It's... I don't know. Hard to explain. I feel the same, but different at the same time."
"Right. Well, I'm ready to go. Let me just say goodbye to the Weasleys."
"He's my mate." You're smiling, almost madly, just at the thought of him. No one else is smiling.
"You basically just mortally insulted him," Hermione replies. Thank Merlin for Hermione. "Doms hold the safety and happiness of any sub above all else, and you just threatened one's. And suggested, like he said, he would abuse his status and power as a dom."
"I'm not joking. I would never joke about this. He's my mate, and I love him, and I don't give two fucks about what you think of me. But if you say anything negative about him, I swear to Godric I will kick your arse." He looks scared. They all do. Good.
"It's nice. Thank you for inviting me, by the way. And helping me. It means a lot."
"Scared. Thought you would reject me."
"Nephew. Mine. Family," she says, and you move to her side so quickly it disorientates me.
"Here. The chimaera scratched you."
"Of course. Thank you, Draco, so good for me." He's so pretty when he blushes like that.
"That you're a sub?" I nod. "Why does that upset you?"
"Mine too."
"I promise. But... you missed me that much?"
"I know, I know." My breathing slows, and I suddenly realise it had been accelerated. I inhale a deep breath of 'Lexie's scent, calming me more.
I'm pushed back into reality, and scamper over to my mate. My mate, who I had left to bleed out. My mate, who is hurt, and I had ignored in favour of hurting someone else. My mate is almost out of it, eyes drooping. The sight of him hurt is worse than anything I've ever seen. There is a large, deep gash across his chest, and scratch marks across his face that I fear will scar, as well as what looks like a bite wound on his left shoulder and wings. But still, he's smiling lazily, raising a hand to my cheek, which I nuzzle against, whining softly. Then his eyes shut, and he sleeps. I curl up against him, pressing as much skin to his, knowing my touch - the touch of his mate - will help him heal more than any human medi-witch will. His limp hand remains on my muzzle, and I lick at it gently, hoping to wake him up. After what feels like too long, the bleeding starts to stop, and I exhale deeply in relief. He'll be okay. My mate will be okay. Everything will be okay.
And suddenly, I'm no longer suffocating. You have control, you can do this. I metaphorically release a sigh of relief. You can do this.
"But... but you were."
Mother's face lights up, and she rushes around the island to hug you tightly, which you return. I can feel you practically glowing at her affection as you nuzzle into her neck, chirping happily.
"No, I've had a couple of mate dreams though. What about you?" Her whole face lights up.
"You are dismissed, thank you for coming to see me. Feel free to do so if you find yourselves needing anything." She nods, and we take it as our cue to leave her office. Zabini leans down to whisper something in Neville's ear, who blushes and nods, before letting himself be led away in the direction of the dungeons.
"What's wrong, sweetheart? Talk to me."
"Then you've done absolutely nothing wrong."
"Hence why I'm a dominant!"
"Normally I wouldn't allow it, but I want to trust you. But if you hurt a single one of my pack members, you won't leave this forest."
Shut up, Alex! You're not right!
"Malfoy? What about him?" I'm glad I don't have control - I might have broken your eyes from rolling them too hard.
For these things, I'm willing to go through the half an hour of pain that comes with a dominant inheritance. But suddenly, inexplicably, the pain goes, leaving only darkness and quiet in its wake.
"Shut up, Zabini. I have to go."
"What did I say?" Ron asks, and you growl in my head.
"Why are you talking in third person?" Pansy asks.
"I- I..." the word flies out of my mouth, trying desperately to obey his order, but not knowing what to say.
I don't under-
My mother and I apparate to the station, and I am faced with swarming crowds that make me feel even more anxious. Like I'm completely surrounded, trapped. And it's so loud and hot, and I can feel glances, and sometimes outright stares, crawling all over me like bugs. They're looking at my wings, I know they are. I knew that to attempt to hide them with my robe wouldn't work; they're too big. Or maybe they're just looking at me- Draco Malfoy, Death Eater who was for some reason excused from punishment. Draco Malfoy, son of Azkaban prisoner and one of the Dark Lord's right-hand men. Draco Malfoy, the enemy of the saviour of the entire Wizarding World. Draco Malfoy, now nothing.
Suddenly, irrationally, I'm kind of nervous. Before I was riding on instinct and adrenaline, doing what you said and what I wanted to. I didn't feel real, like my actions wouldn't have consequences. Harry wasn't Harry, he was just my mate. But now, in front of the castle, everything feels different. My mate is Harry Potter. I don't really know how mates are supposed to act, especially ones that hated each other for years previously. What if he was acting on instinct too, if he actually hates me and was only being nice because he saw me as only a sub, not as me? But, more than the fear, I desperately want to be around him, them, both Harry and Eli.
Okay, I've now caught up with myself posting wise, so from now on I hope to be updating this once a week. Hope you've enjoyed it so far! Make sure to leave a comment telling me what you think.
"What?" I tenderly stroke his cheek.
"You may." He shifts back into his wolf, and I take it as a dismissal, giving you control. You nod to the Alpha, turn, and run back towards Hogwarts. Back at the edge of the trees, you give me control back and I put on the clothes I left there. I'm about to head back up when my name is called.
"How often do I get to do it?" Get to. Get to, not have to, not like it's a chore, like it's something to look forward to.
Harry goes to Remus and Sirius'.
Yeah.
"Oh, I hope you don't mind. When you were asleep I was trying to clean the blood off, and feathers kept falling out, so I just decided to remove the dead ones. It seemed to be helping, so I kept going. Is that okay?" I'm choking. Merlin. I can't say anything, and I think I'm crying, and I can't tell if I'm breathing. Because I thought my mate would hate me. I thought my wings would be disgusting forever, because who in their right mind would care enough about Draco Malfoy to groom him? Harry does. Harry did.
"Never ever?"
"And even if it was, you've apologised. You realised your mistake, and you won't do it again, right?"
"So how are you gay?" one of the boys says with the most disgust I've ever heard someone utter.
The chimaera's den is hidden in the roots of a huge oak tree. When we get to the entrance, it throws me off its back. I land with a thump on the ground, pain ricocheting through my back, air thrown from my lungs. The chimaera starts slowly making its way towards me, and on reflex I start shuffling backwards until I hit one of the roots. I wince as I do, making the chimaera grin widely, showing off its teeth, the ones that will be impaled through the skin of my neck as it rips my head off. "Don't look so scared, Little Veela. I'm not going to eat you... yet." A whimper flies out of my mouth before I can stop it. "Oh hush, you pathetic thing. How a thing like you could ever endear yourself to a dominant is beyond me..." Ironic. After all, I can't 'endear myself to a dominant'. That thought sends a fresh sob forcing its way through my lips. The chimaera growls, then goes back to grinning. "Now, now. I thought I just told you to hush. Seems I'm going have to punish you." In a flash, faster than I thought possible, it has me pinned, its claws digging into my wings and shins. It ever-so-slowly runs a single claw across my chest, tearing a hole in my shirt and ripping the skin, drawing blood from the wound and a scream from my mouth. It hurts. It chuckles, delighted by my scream, and in one quick movement slashes a paw of claws across my face. I can feel the blood dripping down my cheek, and squeeze my eyes shut so none gets in. This means I don't see when it bares its teeth, so feeling sharp fangs pierce my shoulder comes as a shock, and I scream another sob.
"I think you should, but not without telling him." Neville says. "It might be too much if you burst in with no warning. Maybe tomorrow, after breakfast?"
"What's he like?"
"Harry, I... I'm sorry, it just slipped out."
"You'll hate me." The words are a whisper, pulled out of my mouth by his command before I can decide whether or not to say them.
"Thank you so much for coming, it means so much to me."
"Now," the man continues, "it is fairly easy to tell the difference between dominants and submissives, in their appearances but also in simple things like their stances. "For example, Mr Malfoy here, is clearly a sub." A few shocked gasps and mumbles come from the crowd. They know. Everyone knows, and I can't take it back. I keep my head down, for fear of making eye contact with someone. I'm scared that I will look into their eyes and see disgust, contempt. But I'm more scared I will find my mate, and they will hate me. Blaise senses my unease, placing a hand on my shoulder. It helps a lot; his approval; and I instantly feel slightly more at ease. I didn't realise how much I would come to depend on him.
"Because that's helpful," she says sarcastically. I role my eyes.
"Once a Royal Veela comes into their inheritance, their Veela side develops. That's me. Whilst Draco and I share a body and are two halves of one person, we are technically separate people."
"There's nothing wrong with being a sub, Ron," I say, a bit harsher than I intended.
"Well, he needn't be. No one will think anything, and if they do I'll beat some sense into them."
"You heard that?" Blaise asks.
"You can call me Remus, Harry. After all, we'll be spending quite a lot of time together."
Make sure he's okay. You're a bit obsessed with him, aren't you? You huff, your pride wounded. But you're kind of right anyway.
"Mate?" I'm drawn to the word, which is weird. I've heard it all my life, been called it and called others it, but now it feels different. Heavier.
"Oh, um," he stutters, and I think I swoon a little. "Why are you sorry?"
"Huh?"
"Right. Should I go apologise?"
"There are perfectly reasonable explanations for those things!" I argue. Because there has to be. I am dominant, so there has to be.
As long as you don't hurt anyone. I nod to the woman, and head out a side door to strip down before giving you control.
