“Safe?”
“They are not
“M’fine.” Harry pulled Draco’s hand back down and waved the Healer away. “Just not used to being around this stuff anymore.”
That particular evening Pansy had begged off, sighting homework and a date with Theo, and Draco was planning to spend the evening listening to the rather gruesomely titled ‘Meat is Murder’ and practise transforming old boots into daffodils. He’d been looking forward to it all day and was dismayed when, less than a minute after taking a seat behind the Inquisitor’s desk, Janice and Nigel marched in with two new prisoners.
“Haz.” Cormac clapped him on the back, giving him the kind of patronising look a teacher gave to a child. “You’re just too vanilla.”
“I...” panic clawed at Draco’s chest and throat. He stood, tipping his flimsy chair over and knocking his new drink onto the floor. “I have to go.” He turned and walked towards the door. Looking over his shoulder he saw Potter start to follow, calling for Draco to wait. Shaking his head one last time, Draco brushed aside the cardboard monkey. Once again, he felt that familiar hitch behind his belly button and the world tipped 90 degrees before disappearing into darkness.
Predictably, Theo had sniffed that he didn’t need a free broom and then proceeded to sulk when, as Draco already knew, there were no spare brooms available. Theo’s disappointment soon settled into spite and by the end of the week the castle was awash with the news that Draco’s father had brought him a place on the team.
“Not all the time,” Draco interrupted, his breath coming fast as Harry inched closer.
“See you later Harry,” Luna called. Raising a hand. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and pressed closer, closer to Draco. He’d worry about the glee in Luna’s voice later.
“You don’t know that.”
“Probably,” Harry shrugged and the leapt, his trousers slipping down slightly and showing cotton-clad arse. Huffing and puffing, the Saviour of the Magical World flopped onto his back and pulled his trousers back up, glaring at Draco while he did it. “Stop staring at my arse.”
“Fine.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. Why was the flat so fucking small, like it had been built to punish the people who lived there? “I’m going to lie down,” he declared, marching into the bedroom.
“Best leave it.” Harry took another piece of toast, spreading Marmite on it and pushing it over to Draco. “Not really looking for anything at the minute.” He smiled as Draco began mechanically eating the toast, shooting little glances at Harry from under his fringe.
"You think Malfoy is the donor?" Snape asked. "Please," he stepped onto the stairs, "everybody knows that Lucius Malfoy is as poor as a church mouse. The man has his wife in homemade robes and that son running around with a Glamoured broom." The stairs began to move away, the rushing in Draco's ears drowned out Flitwick's answer.
“Are you just copying Hermione?”
“Have you had your two gallons today?” The other woman behind the stall had turned her attention to Harry. She was quite tall with big eyes that pinned Harry in place.
“Harry!” Ron and Cormac had advanced towards the seats, leaving Harry to stare at the stage in horror. Ron’s shout sent Malfoy’s eyes sweeping the crowd until they found Harry in the far corner. Malfoy’s arms stopped mid-wave, and his mouth parted slightly in surprise. Harry felt his throat go dry and his palms turn into a sweaty swamp. His body couldn’t even regulate fluid distribution around Malfoy anymore.
“May I kiss you?” He asked. “Or offer you a gag. Whichever will help you stop talking and make up your mind faster.”
Malfoy stopped talking to the audience and turned to Harry. “Since I’ve been employed by SlickEasy’s Lube.”
“For enemies?” Hermione said a bit too loudly—Snape was only in the loo and he had ears to match his bat-like wardrobe.
Shouts from the other bed alerted them to the fact that Alicia’s spin had landed on Draco. The mist was back to red again and Angelina and Fred were arguing over whether Alicia should have to kiss Fred’s trainer or Angelina’s pumice stone.
?” Hermione was staring at Harry in disbelief. “That was your first date? Were you high?”
“Ms Granger, Mr Potter.” Snape nodded at the two of them. “Would you care to join Mr Malfoy and myself in—”
“Harry Potter.” Harry shook Draco’s hand. It was warm, dry. There were callouses on the underside of Draco’s fingers, the same as the callouses Harry had.
“It could be with you.” Draco interrupted. “If you want. You haven’t eaten either and you, well... you should.” He trailed off, looking both terrified and hopeful.
“Harry.” The question mark stayed in place. “Er, Harry Potter.” With a shiver the question mark became two exclamation marks and the door swung open to reveal a dark hallway. The carpet was soft underfoot—Harry’s trainers sank into it as he followed Mr Snape into the flat. All the doors were closed, the only light coming from Mr Snape’s Lumos.
“Well.” Malfoy looked a little unsure of Harry’s abrupt change in demeanor. He was also covered in big black spots, but that was probably Harry pressing too hard on his own eyeballs. “I suppose we could start with the way in which you allowed the groundskeeper’s horrible horse-bird to maul me in Third Year.”
“Because you were hoping that the thing I desire the most is you.” Draco doesn’t even try to stop the smile spreading across his face. Hope fizzes in his chest, spills out along his arms, through his body to the roots of his hair and the bottom of his feet.
“Indeed.” Draco inspected the jar for cracks. “I haven’t had this much trouble with a Summoning charm since our Academy graduation party. Speaking of which.” He placed the jar on the table and nodded to the second chair. “Breakfast.”
“Stop.” Harry didn’t place his hand on Draco’s knee but he did give him a gentle nudge. “It’s nothing to worry about, we were just talking about, um…” he ran out of words.
“Hmm? Oh,” Rolanda glanced over her shoulder to where the Slytherins and Gryffindors were running drills. “Not sure, to be honest. I’ve got some ideas, but...” she shrugged, turning back to smile at Minerva. The smile was the tight, slightly unhappy thing that Rolanda always wore whenever Minerva tried to talk about Quidditch tactics.
“What? Marcus!”
“We don’t have to do anything,” said Draco, fighting to keep his voice level. “We don’t owe them a thing. They are the ones who lied, dragged us out here with lies and lying promises.”
in anything, do you understand me?”
“I just got a text from Hermione,” Potter was talking to Draco. “She’s saying she lied about my date to get me here. I think she wants us to make up.”
“Yeah but I don’t want to kiss you, you giant pervert,” she smiled.
“Blaise? What do you want with him?”
“Dear me,” she tutted. “A weapon, how horrid. Not at all suitable for children.” Every single teenager in the room, including Draco, bristled. “Did Dumbledore say what kind of weapon it was?”
“What... I... Do you do that as well?” Malfoy was back to looming over Harry. “Casting Patroni willy-nilly?”
“Drink.” Draco looked up in time to see the waitress place a matching beaker in front of Potter. Draco’s phone buzzed with a text as the waitress asked “Have you decided what you want to order yet?”
“I said I was going out to buy tampons for my girlfriend,” said Malfoy. “That’s all it took to give them the slip. I suppose I should be grateful that the kidnappers didn’t waltz up to the Manor, brandishing a packet of Kotex. They’d have been waved straight through.”
“As if I would. I’m an overworked Seeker. Not a fool.”
wanted to kiss him back and-
“Indeed.”
“Harry.” Hermione was standing in the doorway, a silk scarf wrapped around her head. “Shut up. Shut up right now. Or at least keep your voice down.”
“Yeah, but she’s Games and Sports.” Harry smiled up at Draco. “Not exactly a normal bunch. Last time I dropped ‘round, one of them tried to convince me to use protein powder instead of sugar in my tea.”
“To the ends of the Earth,” Lucius gleefully wrote back. “When the Dark Lord’s day arrives there won’t be a single bolt or loophole for those animals to wiggle through.”
“Roger?” Would it be greedy for Harry to take three scoops of egg? He already knew Draco’s scrambled eggs were brilliant, why bother playing coy when—
“Yeah, but Hermione wouldn’t do it without a really good reason.”
“Harry.” Draco closed his eyes. “I think I know who the murderer is.”
“Harry is a wonderful dinner guest.” Hermione joined in. “Your parents would be lucky to have him. Do you hear me? Lucky. If anything they should be begging him to join them.”
“Potter,” Draco leant forward. “You have a horror story like that, and yet you accepted an invitation to a restaurant that serves only cereal? My man, how desperate are you?” Potter's surprised laughter attracted a glare from the tall woman at the table next to them.
“Here you go.” The waitress was back, carrying their new cocktails and two matching green bowls. It was the first time that they’d been given bowls the same size. The contents of the bowls were the same — glass for Potter, mush for Draco — but at least they now had the same amount of inedible food.
“What about Draco?” Harry was still bleary with sleep. He watched in confusion as Snape shrugged and picked his way over to the window, throwing it open in the manner of a man performing an exorcism. “Um.” Harry stood, Accioing the rest of his clothes. “I’ll just... go... then.” He inched towards the door. “Er...”
“M’not shagging him.”
“Well,” Draco grinned, “how else would you describe three players doing the work of one?”
“Right.” Potter grinned even wider and Draco felt himself grinning back.
-+-+-+-+-+-
Sighing one last time, Severus bent forward in his chair and lightly tapped his forehead on the table.
“What was her response to this revelation?”
“I can assure you that if this were a date I would be behaving very differently.”
“Thanks, for, um. You know. Saving our lives.”
“You said it was your favourite cinema.” Draco snarled, his eyes wandering down to Harry’s mouth. It would be rather hot if Harry weren’t so bloody cold his teeth were starting to chatter.
epilogue to follow!
“Alright,” the fluffy-haired fool didn’t look especially bothered by Draco’s tone. “I think Al would like them to be friends, although he’ll kill me for saying it.”
“If he’s your type, why not call him?” Draco eventually asked.
Another whiskery face poked through the bedroom door.
“I... you didn’t want green?”
“What?” he asked. It came out a bit more defensively than he’d expected. “It was just a kiss.”
“Beg pardon?”
“What was stopping you?”
“Friend?” Harry shook his head, his grin fading into one of those smiles Draco had started seeing more and more of. It was exactly the kind of smile that had got him into this (literal) mess in the first place. “I see no friends here.” Harry continued. “Only the woman who dreamt up this nightmare,” he nodded towards Angelina, who was doing some stretches of her own. “And the man who enabled her.”
“Drink.” The waitress placed matching beakers on the table. “Have you decided what you want to order yet?”
“What’s the question?” Draco had pulled the duvet up almost to his chin. It made him look younger.
Rolling his eyes at Ginny's awkwardness, Draco attempted to side-step the pair of them. It was a bit of a squeeze and he bashed his elbow on the corner of the popcorn cart.
“So is Pansy.”
“No cereal?”
“Saving the public indecency? No, no. I imagine we’ll find time to fit that in.” Draco smiled, delighting in the way Potter’s shoulders shook as he laughed.
“Right then.” Harry pushed his glasses up his nose. “Didn’t quite expect this.”
to the stage on
“Well it seems an unlikely coincidence,” Potter shrugged, giving voice to Draco’s uneasy musings. “But also I just got a text from Hermione,” he waved his phone, “saying that she’s sorry about the Liam thing but “you and Draco need to start getting on, for all our sakes.”” Potter’s cheeks went a bit pink as he read out the last part of the text. Draco filed that away to think about later.
“How can a flower pot look like a... oh.” Draco tipped his head to the side, squinting at the pot Harry was pointing to. “Yes, I see it.”
“Mhm.”
“I do not give a single, muddy, shit what it’s called. Do you want to go out with me? Because you looked pretty upset when I stopped flirting with you back there, and it’s given me this awkward medical condition called Hope.”
“No, don’t hurt yourself.” Draco nodded to where the table was biting into Potter’s stomach. Frowning, Potter looked down.
He picked up a bottle of blue lube and poured it onto another dilldo. “It wouldn’t do for the flavours to mix,” he explained. Harry guessed this one, too, (raspberry), but the next samples were getting harder and harder to determine. There was Butterbeer, which he had guessed; then pumpkin pasties flavoured lube, which Harry claimed tasted like pumpkin juice; Chocolate Frog, which Draco insisted was different from pure chocolate, but Harry insisted he was just being pretentious. Then came Firewhisky, which burned so bad that Harry’s eyes began to water - a sado-masochistic range, Draco explained. Interspersed between these flavours were the “niche” lubes, which Harry found was code for “disgusting” and “never want to suck this from a cock ever”. Among them was haggis, tomato sauce, charcoal, and protein powder. “I’ll take a tube,” Cormac yelled.
George, Fred, Angelina, Katie and Alicia took over the twins’ double bed, using the rucked up duvet to pool all their vending machine snacks. Everyone was very excited to try the Lion Bar, even the Slytherins. Harry had quickly given up trying to explain that Muggle sweets were very, very, very boring, and had silently unwrapped a Chocolate Frog while he waited for everyone to pick a spot.
“-horrific period pains.” Ginny was saying. “I’m basically a waterfall of blood. Blaise was helping me to reach the Infirmary. Because I could barely walk.” She turned her attention to Draco. “You know, because the lining of my womb is peeling away and dripping into my-”
“Yeah, looks alright. What about you?” Harry nudged Draco’s shoulder. “You in?”
“Hmm, well Ron didn’t give me all the details but it seems like murder and cannibalism charges are on the table. Not literally.” Ginny rushed to reassure him. As if Draco’s primary concern in that moment were whether he’d ingested Human Nut Loops. “Seems like they’ll definitely want to use the tapes.”
“But the two of us as the only players on the pitch, chasing after the Snitch for hours wouldn’t be vainglorious at all?”
“Well?” Hermione was looking at Harry, a chocolatey thumb holding her place on the page.
“Alright.”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, only to close it again when Tonks appeared in the doorway.
“If you can’t sleep you can start working out how we’re going to break the prophecy,” said the second otter. Also in Hermione’s voice.
“Alright?” Harry kept his hands in his pockets, his left-hand wrapped around his wand. Hermione’s note had said that Harry should trust Mr Snape. There’d been no mention of lanky twats. And this new man was a twat, Harry could feel it in the way his eyes were running over Harry, taking in the mud along the bottom of his jeans, the ratty JB Sports bag hooked over Harry’s shoulder.
“I need to talk to Potter,” Malfoy said. “Alone,” he added after neither Ron nor Cormac gave any indication of removing themselves from his presence. Ron looked at Harry, and Harry nodded that it was okay. Cormac slapped Harry hard on his upper back.
“Yes. It would have been nice if you were there.”
“A number of established magical families have latent Animagi traits,” McGonagall smiled. “A few centuries ago Black Animagi, for example-”
“It’s a dragon.” Draco wills himself to stay calm. “You have a tattoo of a dragon.”
“Er. I think my mate is going to let his boyfriend put that up his arse.” He nodded to Cormac, Ron, and the towering, sugary dildo.
“Right then,” the waitress tapped something rapidly into her iPad, “two greens coming up.”
“Yeah, ahem— I mean, yes.” Malfoy was shaking his head, a small smile pushing curves into his sharp cheeks. “Very well. Let us go over what we know so far. We need to achieve a transformation.” he waited for Harry’s confirmation.
“N-no.” Draco shakes his head.
“Or at least start it,” Angelina called, from her position on top of the climbing wall.
And Draco hadn’t stopped at the personal apologies. The East-wing of the Malfoy estate had been turned over to St Mungo's as a teaching school and the Malfoy family donated to a number of Muggle-born support programs. Draco had made sure to protect Scorpius from blood-politics and serial killers. He was on good terms with his ex-wife and all his ex-partners. Every Christmas without fail he sent a box of Prestat truffles to his Muggle publisher and a box of Longbottom candied fruit to his Magical publisher. He made sure to purchase Scorpius a free-range owl for his first year at Hogwarts and he always remembered to take the recycling out.
“Um, no,” said Harry. “She’s not ‘doing a great job’ because it still makes no sense and it’s not rape.”
In which Draco and Harry have a chat.
The next morning, his head aching from lack of sleep and his eyes rubbed raw, Draco pulled Theo aside.
“Are you bloody mental?” Ron rounded on his boyfriend. “If that came anywhere near your your arse, you would be as dead to me as the mummy that first used it.” At that he promptly pushed Cormac away from the stand.
“Yeah I saw, lucky thing.” Angelina smiled in a way that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Sorry, we should have explained the game before we started playing. You’re so good at all this flying shit, it’s easy to forget you were raised Muggle.”
The argument had petered out after that. Although Malfoy kept shaking his head and muttering about how long it took him to collect signatures. A plate of dry tuna and mayo sandwiches later and they’d moved on to debating hotly whether Malfoy had stolen Neville’s Remembrall or been the victim of a fix-up.
“Pretty cool, right?” One of the stall owners was looking at Harry expectantly. She had charmed her hair to match the mugs and it flicked to a new colour every time she smiled. She seemed to do that a lot.
It was the best night Harry had ever had.
“Sorry. I didn’t see you.” Harry helped her balance the tray.
“What does your current self thinking about it?”
“Pack it in,” said Angelina, coming over to sit next to Harry. “Look, Haz. It’s alright, yeah? The mist was green so you didn’t do anything to Draco that he wasn’t happy for you to do.”
“Sounds good,” said Potter, his face was rather red and his shoulders were still shaking, yet he managed to sound completely genuine as he asked the waitress if there was a specific colour of bowl she would recommend.
“It’s Beltane.” Hermione avoided his eyes. “It’s Beltane and we’re not being dragged into some horrible murderous prophecy and we’re alive and just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon-”
“Before Hogwarts, I was maybe four or five.” Draco responded absent-mindedly, his attention still focused on the idea of Potter making illicit use of the Prefects Bathroom. The cheek of the man.
“I don’t recall getting ‘gory details’ when you and Hermione got together.”
“I…” Draco looked utterly befuddled. “What relationship?”
“Are you enjoying this?” Draco gasped, sucking down air as he finally flipped off the last trampoline and landed at Harry’s feet. “Getting an illicit thrill?”
“Why did you pick green bowls?”
“They do,” said Harry, choosing to ignore the fact that he had never played the Muggle version either. He was fairly sure that red and green smoke was not part of it. “But can’t people just say if they don’t want to kiss someone?”
“‘Severus’? Bloody ‘Severus’?” Harry interrupted. “You know he had me call him ‘Mr Snape’?”
“Interesting; maybe we should consider playing by these Muggle rules,” said Cassius. “You know,” he said, turning to Mafalda, “in the name of Magical-Muggle Cooperation and all that.”
“Yes.”
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Janice was such an avid patroller that she and Nigel had usually cleared the castle by the time Draco and Pansy arrived to take over at 10 pm. The Inquisitors Den was little more than an enlarged stationary cupboard with a desk and two squashy armchairs cramed against the back wall. It did have a Wireless, however, and with all the miscreants scared back to their beds, Draco spent his Wednesday evenings listening to those maudlin Muggle bands Astoria liked.
“He looks exactly like me.” Harry tried to argue.
“A little bit.”
Harry and Draco continued sharing a bed, despite the fact that Snape wasn’t even sleeping in the flat and there was a perfectly good sofa going.
“Thank you for endorsing my hard-won non-bigoted status.” Draco interrupted, pushing as much ice as possible into his voice. “As you appear to already be aware of my motivations without the need to actually check any of your assumptions with me and I must confess myself to be at a loss as to why you suddenly feel the need to do so now.”
, Severus wrote,
“Don’t you agree?” he asked, feeling rather lightheaded.
“I care,” said Blaise. “Do give the Minister my regards. Draco.”
“Please be less idiotic,” Malfoy interrupted Harry.
“Yes, yes.” Draco waved the words aside, impatient with whatever social insurance Blaise was about to concoct. “Not a word to the others, you and Nervy are simply star-crossed lovers-” he felt a jolt of mean satisfaction at the uneasy glance Blaise threw towards the door. “I saw nothing, know nothing, consider me a vault, sealed and-”
This jumbled feeling lingered with Draco as he stumbled home, owl’d Scorpius and collapsed into bed. He dreamt of cereal and green eyes and woke in a cold sweat. Was Harry alright? Why hadn’t he waited for Draco after the second interrogation? What if he’d sustained some long-lasting spell damage during the raid that was only just becoming apparent? Should Draco call him? Text? Owl? Orchestrate an elaborate badge-centric flirtation?
As Draco watches, Harry leans back against the window and allows his thick thighs to fall slightly open, grinning at whatever reaction he sees on Draco’s face.
“I don’t…” Draco hovers. They are all so damnably knowing. Smiling and nodding and telling him where to find Harry, as if he cares. Well, obviously Draco does care. There is the question of the dragon tattoo to undress-unwrap, he mentally corrects himself. But he didn’t care enough to warrant an entire table of Weasleys and assorted hangers-on looking at him and, and, and-
“Well I wouldn’t personally have any objection to that,” said Fred.
“You didn’t know me, Potter.” Draco jerked the duvet over his knees and back up to under his chin. “You were one boy, trying to keep himself and his friends alive, why should you be responsible for the entire castle?”
“More like wistful thinking.” Pansy finishes towelling off her hair and starts flinging anti-wrinkle spells at her tights. “She’ll never forgive me for ousting her favourite daughter-in-law.”
“Honestly.” Draco looped the scarf around Harry’s neck, frowning as he tucked the ends into the front of Harry’s hoodie. It was probably making Harry look like he had one giant breast in the middle of his chest but, rather than complain, he snuggled into the scarf. The action caused Draco to roll his eyes, a small smile pulling at his thin lips.
“It certainly doesn’t
“Beside the point,” said Draco, looking a bit pleased. “That was a date?”
“For the love of magic it was a mistake.” Ginny pushed her own glasses up her nose, rubbing her eyes and looking every inch of done. “Al, we’ll talk about this later. Scorpius, your dad is fine but maybe he’d like to sit down? Draco, there’s a tent for us lot to sit while they finish up the raid.”
“Y-yes.” Granger issued a pathetic sob, her eyes darting once again to Potter. “D-dumbledore told us that if-if we joined his army that we would be saved fr-from the weapon.” Umbridge nodded, greedily, leaning over Grangers chair and offering her a tissue.
“Just that Hermione’s never done this before.”
“More lies, you love me. The important question is why are you pretending you don’t also love Harry?”
-+-+-+-+-+-
“What?” The queasiness Harry had been fighting off ever since Draco sat down came roaring back. “Just, you know, our dates. The dating…thing.”
“I’m Malfoy, now?” Draco asked, Malfoyishly.
“Oh no.” She said. “No, no, no. You do
“Right.” Draco nodded uncertainly, picking up his pint. Hermione fidgeted with a coaster for a few microseconds, then turned to Ron.
“Pshaw. We should join the others, oh goodness-” Pansy finally takes a proper look at Draco “-you’re soaked!” On cue, a cold icy dribble of melted snow finds its way beneath Draco’s collar. He shivers, remembering how Ron had grasped Harry’s jumper, yanking the collar open to stuff snow down Harry’s back. A move that revealed several inches of Harry’s lower back and… “Draco?” Pansy’s face creases with concern. “Are you alright? You’re not getting ill, are you?”
“Malfoy,” Harry shook his head, because of course it was Draco. Green smoke erupted from the neck of the bottle; as he straightened up, Harry was dimly aware that everyone else had started whistling and whooping. Turning to Draco, he shifted across the duvet until they were facing each other.
“I don’t... this wasn’t what I envisaged,” said Draco, his eyes drifting across Harry’s face. “Um...” He lifted his left hand and pressed against Harry’s left shoulder. “I’m not pushing you away,” he insisted, apparently seeing something uneasy on Harry’s face. “Just, let me... There.” When Draco finished they were both lying on their right sides, with Harry’s back pressed up against Draco’s chest. Draco’s arm was heavy around Harry’s waist and his nose was in Harry’s hair.
They had reached the end of the hall when Harry’s eyes fell on a small stage and his entire self crumbled into dust. On the side of the stage closest to Harry, was a small table covered in little bottles and a near-regimental row of dildos. The other side had a larger, sturdier table, laden with small cauldrons, tubes, and pipettes. Blue, red, and yellow liquids dripped into small test tubes and orange and green smoke was curling in the air above the cauldrons. In short, it looked a lot like Harry’s potions class nightmare, except he wasn’t naked and there was no sign of Snape.
Harry laughed in earnest. Ron was crazy for putting up with a boyfriend like that, but Harry had never seen him happier and more at ease with who he was. He liked this new Ron, unburdened by expectations, free to simply be. He wondered if love and acceptance did that to people and felt burning jealousy in his throat.
“Alright lads?” said Chrissy. “And lasses, of course. Welcome to the Sheffield Travelodge. Piss about and you’re out on your arses, play nice and I’ll tell you which vending machine gives out pound coins every time you buy a Twix.” She smiled at the groups of nonplussed teens, all of whom looked at Harry.
“He won't be interested in you, if that's what you're hoping for.” Draco smiled as Ginny blushed and crossed her arms.
“Dunno, we were just starting to discuss, er, temperature settings when—”
Trying to mould the two teams into one cohesive unit was an intimidating prospect, even for a woman who had once scaled Kilimanjaro while fighting off a yeast infection. If she
“Fix what?”
Potter was looking as ridiculously self-righteous as ever, glowing at Umbridge from beneath his heavy dark fringe and from behind those ludicrous, heavy-framed glasses. It was just as well, Draco mused, that Potter’s eyes were so bright, otherwise they’d be easy to overlook and The Boy Who Lived would be nothing more than hair, glasses, and freckles. And when had those appeared? Summer was still a long way away and Potter definitely hadn’t had so many dark flecks scattered across his cheeks during their conversation in the changing rooms. Was it possible that he had picked them up from Ginny? Draco had seen the two of them walking together by the lake, but surely if that was the case then Blaise would have acquired a-
“Sometimes,” she nodded. “You’d be surprised how often people have photos of their own anus to hand. Fancy a cauldron cake?” She produced a gigantic cake from her rucksack. It was golden brown and dotted with glace cherries.
“Yes.” This time Draco’s wince was strong enough to smush his entire face. “They intercepted some of my owls to Scorpius where I was less than flattering about the city of Leicester in general and about the ghost guides at Ashby de la Zouch Castle specifically.”
tell you that you’re not a complete berk.”
“Here we are.” They’d reached the fourth floor, stopped in front of a door that had scuff marks around the lock and a blue squiggle of spray paint across the peephole. The paint sparkled as Mr Snape passed his wand over it, fizzing as it started to move, spreading out to form a question mark. “Severus Snape,” said Mr Snape, gesturing for Harry to do the same.
“It doesn’t hurt. It’s just a table.”
“How did I get here?” Draco struggled to remember the timestamp on Pansy’s last text to him, 19.36. “What time is it?”
“Couples code?” Draco asked Harry, ducking his head to lean in. Close. Too close.
“Shh, it’s alright love,” Oliver whispered, his face contorting as he tried to smother a grin. “No one cares that you’ve got a-”
“Fond?”
Which is where yet another of Minerva’s problems lay: Rolanda of the thoughtful gifts and twinkles and gruff “hullo”s had no interest in letting Minerva anywhere near her Quidditch pitch. At least, not as anything other than a spectator.
“Should have kicked off mate,” said Harry, shifting out of the way as Ernie stepped into the swamp and began making his way over to the climbing wall.
In which Draco has a little chat with Umbridge.
“But you just found the prophecy in a random box,” Harry persisted, ignoring Hermione’s attempts to hush him.
“Yet,” Malfoy muttered.
“What is it then?” Harry folded his arms, still blocking Draco’s path.
“Is that me?” Harry asked, tipping his head to the side.
“Nothing’s happening yet.” Harry shuffled his chair a little closer to Draco. “Why am I “Potter” again? You were calling me Harry back in the cafe.”
“My what?”
“You and Malfoy, the gory details.”
“Think he’s a bit tired,” Ginny muttered to Draco.
“A time trap.” Draco breathed, mentally reshuffling his entire evening. “It wasn’t... so it wasn’t waiting for me to, ah...” He trailed off. All of Narcissa’s training—as comprehensive as it was—had ill-prepared Draco to ask the question; “you mean to say that I am not the centre of the universe?” without at least a twinge of embarrassment.
“And thirdly.” Ron raised his voice. “Do you want to talk about it before Draco comes back with the drinks?”
“Er yes. It was awkward as fuck. Are you sure you don’t want me to come tonight? I don’t mind.”
“I am definitely going to be taking the piss out of you for that later,” said Harry. “But that bloke seems a bit interested in us and maybe we should, um, leave.” He nodded his head towards a short wizard standing a few feet behind them. The short wizard waved and lifted a gigantic camera—disconcerting reminiscent of the Malfoy canons—onto his shoulder.
His thoughts continued on their maddening hamster wheel, throwing out reminders of the way Harry had leapt in the air to avoid being hit. The way that stupid, flappy jumper had lifted again, flashing a tantalizing glimpse of-
“I think you’ll find it’s called ‘a cinema’, Hermione.” Draco interrupted. “And I will thank you to stop glaring at my—at Harry in that manner. He didn’t have many opportunities to watch Muggle cinemas growing up. You know.”
“Wha-” he shook his head in disbelief. “You’re actually selling
“Sorry,  Mum.” He kisses her cheek, flipping two fingers behind his back as Harry and George break into a choreographed routine of, ‘Honestly Ronald, do have some care!’ and ‘Such an uncouth young man!’ The three of them disappear towards the kitchen, laughing and pushing as Draco and Pansy gratefully accept their towels.
“Hughh, Profezzer Snape?” Clearing his throat, Harry tried to sit up. “Wazzamatta?”
“Yeah, you said.”
“Right.” Harry lapsed into silence. He carried on staring at Draco, watching the way his long fingers gripped the edges of the Ministry-issue notebook. They were supposed to be recording the timestamp of any moments of the date that they didn’t want shown in open court. As long as no crime was actually being committed during those time stamps, the judges would view them in a private Pensieve, prior to making their final judgement. Harry knew this because Tonks had already explained it to Draco. At length. He also knew this because that had been his first job as a Junior Auror, shifting through time trap footage to make sure the Aurors hadn’t missed anything. It had been mind-numbingly dull and Harry still wasn’t convinced that Kingsley hadn’t assigned him that shift specifically to put him off Auroring for life.
“As a friend?”
getting the mermaid’s Floo address before continuing his conquest of every stand.
“Right.” Draco nodded a few times. “Of course. She’s right, of course. Transformation.” he cleared his throat, visibly gathering up his composure and smoothing it over the anxious lines covering his forehead. “We should focus our efforts on no longer being recognisable as the subjects of the prophecy.”
“Hmm.” Harry carried on chewing. “Great eggs.”
Harry was rather doubtful that Mafalda - a woman wearing a top that said ‘gone fisting’ across the chest - had ever been particularly susceptible to peer pressure. Still, he nodded his head.
"The whole team?" Professor Flitwick asked. "All of them?"
After their shouting match they’d sat back on the edge of the bed, both sets of feet firmly on the floor. It was a lot less comfortable than sitting against the wall, and Harry wanted to suggest that they move back. But what if Draco didn’t want to? Harry couldn’t move on his own, that would just be weird.
A fifth otter.
In a previous life the restaurant had been a computer repairs shop and it still had the old sign above the door.
“Well I… I…” At a loss, Draco looked to the empty training room for help. “I’m sorry? If that made you uncomfortable.”
“This is my table, Malfoy.”
“Dad?!?” Scorpius’ grey eyes swam with fresh tears. Goodness. Draco hadn’t seen his son this emotional since the Magical Menagerie ran out of Flailtail Snail Kale; forcing Leopold to dine on dandelion leaves like a common garden snail. Speaking of which.
“Squib and Muggle-born, thank you very much,” the Slytherin Beater corrected from her perch on top of the sanitary towel bin. If it was anyone else, Harry would assume that they just didn’t know what the bin was for, but considering that Mafalda was the student who had successfully campaigned for the theme of the last Yule Ball to be ‘Sexy Squibs and Mad-For-It-Muggles,’ it was probably some kind of Slytherin power move.
“Well,” Malfoy sniffed, retracting into himself and alerting Harry to the fact that they had been sitting rather close. “I suppose that bad temper and self-pity are to be expected. Some people might suggest that a little common courtesy wouldn’t be too much to expect among old school fellowes and bed mates, some might even say—”
The frantic tapping of Scorpius’ Hogwarts owl delivered Draco from a meditation on the gruesome gallantry of green-eyed Gryffindors. He knew it was Scorpius’ owl because it looked old enough to have witnessed humanity crawl out of the primordial ooze and then go for a stiff, legal drink after. Whenever he was feeling homesick, Scorpius had developed an unfortunate habit of choosing the most pitiful of the Hogwarts owls. This was done with the confidence that Draco would never risk a reply on anything below Bald Eagle class. These Hogwarts owls, relieved of their duties, would then hang around the Manor for a few days; sleeping in Draco’s slippers and stealing his toast until he packed them into a cage and personally returned them to Hogwarts. These trips always seemed to end with Draco taking Scorpius out for spiced apple juice in Hogsmeade.
“Janice is surprisingly dense for a Ravenclaw,” said Draco, stung. “She may have memorized the Educational Decrees but she does not understand me, or my motivations.”
“Course it was,” Fred grinned as Angelina waggled her eyebrows and Millicent rolled her eyes.
“Please stop.” Potter grimaced. “I’m sorry, when you started asking who I fancied at school I thought... Yeah, never mind. Let’s leave it, yeah?”
“Well this removes the pressure. The mist knows your true heart.” Mafalda paused to simper at Millicent in a manner that was, frankly, uncalled for. “Even if you say it’s fine, everyone else will know you don’t want to kiss the other person, and so you just kiss something else instead.”
“Severus told me—”
“Malfoy.” Harry sat up enough to fold his arms. Malfoy’s innocent expression melted into wavering uncertainty.
“Alright lads?” Tonk’s hair was standing on end and there were dark circles under her eyes. “Haz I know you already know this but Draco, mate, did you know that because I’m the first Auror to have contact with you when you left the crime scene, I can’t go home until you do?”
“I didn’t ignore the mist,” Harry insisted. “I just didn’t notice it.”
“Right. Except that we now need you to watch all the bits you talked through.” The door slammed behind Tonks, leaving Draco and Harry to exchange guilty glances. Draco’s cheeks were a bit pink and he groaned as the tape began to rewind. Harry shifted in his seat, took another swallow of cold tea and offered up a silent prayer to the gods of romance that, one day, this cursed date would just bloody end.
“Yes, the magic of the Manor protected Draco from anything... you know,” Hermione pulled a face, eyes darting to the bedroom where Draco was having a rage nap. “But that didn’t mean Voldemort couldn’t keep him close. Draco said that—”
“I thought you might like dinner and drinks. Somewhere that didn’t smell like a rainbow had vomited.”

try tell anyone what Blaise was up to.
“Stop it.” Draco batted her hand away, accidentally catching his thumb on one of her rings.
The corner of Potter’s mouth twitched. “Lies and lying promises?” he asked. “Wow, you’re really upset about this. Aren’t you?”
It was Harry’s turn to go slack-jawed. And then...
“Sounds gruesome,” Draco laughed.
“Couldn’t get one, eh?” Potter nodded sympathetically. “Took me three tries on the website, you know they’re using Java? Who does that?”
“That looks brilliant,” said Harry. “It’s not… er… it’s not sex themed, is it?”
, Potter,” Draco hissed. “This is not the behaviour of someone showing a healthy appreciation for the Malfoy line, this is... this is...” he lowered his voice, glancing at the door. “This is the kind of behaviour Aunt Bella indulged in. The sort of thing that led to Death Eaters and, and, and, and Voldemort and the like.” Draco trailed off, blinking at Harry.
“Fucks sake, alright. It’s like now I know you as Draco, you know? But back then you were Malfoy, so it’s like that happened to Malfoy, yeah?”
“I think it used to belong to Snape’s mum,” said Hermione, not quite answering his question. “You know I would have come if I could.”
“Yeah, do that.”
“On a Sunday?” Draco asks, standing up and taking a step towards the window seat. “Dreadfully unfair. Don’t they know who you are?”
“Are you telling me,” Ron’s voice was faint, “that there are people in this world who buy a dead person’s dildo and shove it up their arse?”
“I... what?”
The snowball fight is winding down, and everyone is thoroughly soaked by the time Molly calls them in for lunch. All eight try to cram through the backdoor at once, grabbing towels and casting drying spells as they scuff the snow off their shoes.
“Getting wankered at the Auror Christmas Party, telling your mate, me—” Harry jerked a thumb towards his own chest “—that you fancy him, and then never mentioning it again.”
“No, it wasn’t a bloody suggestion!” Harry glared, crossing his arms, not caring that the slicked dildo in his hand grazed against his clothes.
With no idea what Potter was talking about, Draco hummed his agreement before trying again. “I do have a reservation, thank you. The man I am meeting made it under his name and the waitress appears to think that he is you, or rather I am him.”
"Of course. The usual spells will remain in place," said Snape, referring to the charms all match brooms were treated with to avoid any student having an advantage.
“Did I hear someone mention bottoms?” The woman who had spoken was wearing black and yellow striped dungarees and a sign around her neck that said ‘Arse Readings: Your Fate Lies Between Your Cheeks.’ Harry felt his life flash before his eyes as he read and reread the words.
“Maybe I'm not interested in him,” she said. “Come on Draco, didn't you used to be mates? I promise it's nothing bad.” Her words hit Draco in some soft, fleshy part of himself that he usually tried to pretend didn't exist.
a new headline. The Chosen One Brags about Fellatio Prowess.
“I couldn’t sleep,” he said. “I thought you might want to work on things.”
“Chrissy doesn’t scare me,” said George, dramatically dropping the volume of his voice and winking at Harry. “C’mon Draco, what have you got for us?”
“Right,” he said, pulling on his own goggles and gazing mournfully down at the swamp. “I’ll just. Go. Then.” It was only mud, Draco reminded himself as he stepped down into the swamp. Mud. Soft, harmless, mu—”Why is it so cold?” He demanded. The swamp seemed to be charmed to always come up to the inhabitants armpits, no matter how tall they were. Raising his voice, Draco asked the question again.
“I... Um...” Draco swallowed, staring at Potter. “I...”

shake. “Happy?”
“Oh Liam likes green too,” Potter jumped in before Draco could reply.
With a shudder, Draco’s attention wandered back to where the Aurors were still standing in formation. “Shouldn’t they be doing something?” He asked, swallowing against the thought of Harry. Alone. Waiting for Draco to come back. Possibly sharing a bowl of Shreddies with a mass murderer.
“Fuck off,” Harry flailed, trying to escape, throw a handful of mud back, and keep his footing all at once. It was a doomed enterprise and, without thinking, Draco darted out an arm to steady him. “Thanks.” Harry was flushed, his side pressed against Draco with only a thin layer of mud between them. “You’re a hero or something.”
“You haven’t had a date that I didn’t organise in at least a year.”
“Ouch,” said Harry, grinning. “Alright, mate?”
Headlines about the attempted kidnapping of Hero Hermione Granger had dominated the Ministry atrium for weeks.
“What were you really talking about?” Draco persisted.
“Of course this business with Scorpius has reinforced that wariness.” Draco hurried on. “People who are overly concerned with their appearance are not... they do not seem...”
important-”
“I...” he trailed off. “I... I...”
“-but insisting on the creation of a completely new team is nonsense,” Draco continued. It was nothing that Harry hadn’t thought himself; still, a small thrill went through him as he watched Draco’s gestures get looser and his face more flushed.
“Wanker.” Harry Vanished the ketchup, ignoring the way his shaky spell took half the paint off the table top. “So selfish.”
“Mr Potter.”
“So...” he said, green eyes floating back to Draco. “Should we have a chat, then? You know, to please Hermione and Pansy.”
“Would you like another?” Draco was smiling at Harry.
Wow. Remember back in 2017 when I thought I could plot a story and regularly update it and then it only took three years and a global pandemic for me to actually finish a less than 20k fic? Good times. Good times. Thanks for staying with me (and welcome to new readers!) - I hope you enjoyed it!
“Have a biscuit, Malfoy.” McGonagall waved her wand and a tin of shortbread came zooming out from behind the sofa cushions. “Odd place to keep them” some part of Draco’s mind registered, as he automatically reached for a biscuit.
After reading about Hermione and Malfoy’s separate kidnapping attempts in
gleaned from Practical Prophecies for the Perplexed Pizard.”
“Fudge is puffed-up little upstart who has nothing to recommend him beyond a few decades of Ministry drudgery and the ability to cultivate connections such as myself.” Lucius snapped, raising his voice as Draco opened his mouth to reply. “The day the Malfoys are seen to beg for friendship from the likes of Fudge we may as well throw in our gloves and retrench to the continent.”
“Thanks Mrs Albus’s Mum.” Scorpius interrupted Draco’s half-formed refusal. “Come on Al.” With a last glance at the crowd – most of whom were waiting patiently in line to be seen by the Healers – Albus and Scorpius started off towards a white tent with a hastily spelled
“Secrets,” he finally said.
“Yes dear.”

Draco opens his mouth to reply, only to become distracted by the soft press of Harry’s lips against his own.
“Oh.” Draco’s cheeks flushed as he looked down. “Yes, it was on the floor.”
“Yes,” Draco smiled back at Harry. “It is. Fine.”
“Yes! Eventually…” Draco’s eyes did a bit of a shifty thing but his hands remained firmly clasped around Harry’s. Harry valiantly tried to remind himself that, apparently, Draco held hands with everyone. It just didn’t really work when Draco was softly rubbing his thumbs over the backs of Harry’s hands.
desperate, loose limbed and grinning easily across the table at Draco. “What about you?”
“So, Mr Malfoy.”
“Absolutely not.” Draco frowned at the form. “Did Gryffinbottom really say “you’ve bested me, o’mighty Potter” when you arrested him?”
“Yes.” Draco cleared his throat. “I do.”
“Oh, I prefer to go on a good old fashion kitten rescue with them, said Draco. “This is the first time I will have graced this particular establishment.” He shoved his hands into his trousers pockets and rocked back on his heels. “Of course,” he kept his eyes on the group of shrieking pissheads and pixies who were congregating around the Bunion’s doorway. “Of course we could always save that particular experience for another day.”
“Bloody hell.” Tonks spun Draco around by his captive shoulder and used her spare hand to grab Harry’s sleeve. “Time to get out of here before we end up on the frontpage of
“Look,” said Potter, dragging in a heavy breath and making a visible effort to relax. “I don’t know why you’re asking all this and it’s not really any of your business. But if you’re finally ready to talk about this thing." He gestured between the two of them, “then I am, too. I’ve been ready. Yes, I fancied you at school and I quite fancy you now. What about you?”
With a sigh, Draco lifted a soapy hand to beckon Harry closer.
Draco froze. Everyone froze. Looking around the room, Harry saw that Fred and Angelina had frozen mid-arm wrestle, Oliver and Marcus were mid-grope, Cassius was mid-preen, Millicent and Mafalda appeared to be mid-yoga routine. Everyone was still and then...
Harry waited until George and Katie had collected everyone's orders and headed off to the vending machines.
“Investigating the possibilities of obtaining our Animagus form should be a priority, however, before you arrived Professor Snape, myself, and Hermione, we, ah, we...” Malfoy trailed off, his neck going a splotchy pink.
“Just a moment.” Draco raised both a hand and an eyebrow. “I believe that it is my turn to choose what Harry kisses.”
“If I’d known we were dating, I would have kissed you.”
“Why you were given a firefighter and I was given an underwear model? Presumably a misguided attempt on the part of Granger and Pansy to predict the kind of man we would find most appealing.” A small sour feeling was starting to uncurl in Draco’s chest. It shouldn’t be surprising that Potter, the ultimate Gryffindor, would prefer a man of action.
“Since-fucking-when are you a lube taster?” Harry’s voice came out a bit panicked, but he felt he had every right to be. After all, he’d just found out why the lube he sucked off Malfoy’s cock on multiple occasions was so fucking delicious.
“Good.” She beamed. “99 percent of magical beings underestimate the importance of hydration to a fulfilling sex life, it’s a pleasure to meet a fellow 1 percenter. That’s a pun, I’m Muggle-born.”
“Pfft, fine.” Harry tried to keep the smile off his face. It didn’t work. He carried on smiling for the next twenty minutes, until the warmth of Draco’s body and the early hour lulled him back to sleep.
“What? Oh! It’s, um,” Potter checked his phone again, “twenty to eight.” Four minutes. Surely it had been longer than four minutes. Draco must have fainted, maybe he keeled over once he stepped outside.
“Don’t lie to me.” Draco was standing very close, the wind whipping his fine white hair into Harry’s face. Thinking that he should probably step back, or push Draco away, Harry moved forward.
“Well I-”
“They’re splitting up.”
“You’d rather have Voldemort for dinner? Over Harry?” Ron’s face was almost purple. “You fucking fuck, do you have any idea—”
“Alright.” Draco still looked a bit terrified, but he smiled as Harry gestured towards the door. “Alright, Potter. Let’s go.”
“You… you read arses?” He asked, involuntary clenching.
you doing?” Draco asked.
“They get everywhere, don’t they?” She laughed. “Although I guess that’s kind of the idea.”
“Yeah, we’ve already got a Seeker,” George grinned.
“S’technically still the beginning,” said Albus. “Might be he’s going to drop dead later. Could drop dead right now?”
*~*~*
“Actually Mafalda and I are non-monogamous,” said Millicent. “We just don’t want to snog any of you. No offense.” Half the room failed not to look offended while the other half nodded in a knowing way.
.” She marched them back the way they’d come, through the atrium and back up the lifts. Somewhere between the Auror desks and the interrogation rooms, Draco and Harry got seperated. One moment Harry was wagging those ridiculous eyebrows at Draco and the next he’d been whisked into a different room by another Auror.
“Neither has Pansy.”
“I said nothing of the sort,” Draco sniffed. Noticing a gleam in Harry’s eye, he hurried to tack “Potter” onto the end of his sentence.
“Diggory propositioned you?” Draco interrupted.
“I believe the Muggles call them ‘leggings.’” Draco avoided Harry’s eyes.
Mist. Red mist. Billowing up from the bottle and swirling around Cassius, Draco and Harry.
“I… that’s terrible.” Draco’s cheeks hurt from smiling, Harry looked like he was having the same problem. “I look like a troll and you’re not supposed to desire your friends, unless the rumours about Gryffindor house are true.”
As soon as the thought occurred to him Draco knew it was time to call it a night. Annoying Potter had lost its appeal a while ago, although he’d still hex Pansy, Draco decided as he stood and tossed some Muggle notes on the table.
Indeed, Blaise had been forced to relive the same eight week period for over a year before an Unspeakable had turned up at his door with a bag of grey powder in one hand and a smashed amulet in the other. Time loops were a common enough problem, the stuff of children’s games and amusing pub anecdotes. Certainly nothing to worry about. Of course this knowledge didn’t stop Draco from trying to leave the restaurant again. And again. And again.
“But you’re not like that anymore,” said Harry, dropping his voice to match Draco. “What do you mean ‘scare me off’? Were you going to ask me out?”
“So a person who was hungry might see a pumpkin pasty?” he asks.
“Cereal cafes are fucking stupid?”
that you choose the colour of the bowl you want and the chef creates a specially tailored menu for you.”
“No,” said Malfoy. “No, no. Absolutely not. I won’t do it. Waiting around, jumping at every noise.” His voice was rising. “I did quite enough of that during the war, thank you very much.”
Why, then, was he finding the tableau before him so… disquieting?
“The sheets are because we’re having work done,” said Chrissy, coming out from behind the desk and moving to stand in front of Malfoy. “Which is the only reason that you lot are able to come and stay at this
“Yes.”
“He’s sitting in the second tier. I think. Now. Are you going to tell me why you want to speak to him?”
Draco didn’t need the owl from his mother, or the firecall from his father, to understand that he needed to get on Umbridge’s good side. Years of being able to transform at will and coaching from McGonagall had improved Draco’s control. But stress still brought out his furry alter ego and those early lessons with Moody had taught Draco that becoming a ferret was no proof against torture. Indeed, a few tea parties with Umbridge had made it crystal clear to Draco that she was likely to reach new, sadistic heights if faced with a rogue, undocumented Animagus.
“May we see the menu?” he asked, fighting off a shiver.
“Dunno.” Potter sat back, rubbing a hand over his stubbly chin. “Guess I’ve got a bit of experience when it comes to be judged on the physical.”
been up to on the 23rd must have been rather juicy, he speculated as she grabbed her things and slammed out of the room.
“Afraid not.” Apparently happy with his diagonistic spells, Ron sat down next to Draco. “Time loops are fine, time traps are another thing. The Aurors use them on crowd stakeouts, when there’s a mix of Muggles and Magics and they don’t know if a suspect is armed. Someone in there-” he nodded to the Cereal Monogamist “-is dangerous and the easiest way to extract them with minimal casualties was-”
“Fucking hell.” Harry groaned.
“Harry,” Draco paused. “Must kiss. Marcus’.” Oliver sat up straight. “Teddy bear.” The room erupted into cheers and dramatic gasps.
“You don’t have to catch any criminals!” Tonks yelled after him. “That’s what we’re for. You tell him, yeah?” She pointed at Harry.
“Schoolboy rivalry?” Draco croaked. “Wanted to see if you could beat me at this as well?”
Draco knew that people were saying his father bought him a place on the Slytherin Quidditch team. He knew long before that Mudblood Granger threw it in his face, because Draco was the one who started the rumours.
“You wish,” Harry replied with just as much conviction as all those years ago. He ripped the dildo out of Draco’s hand and, without breaking eye contact, gave it a long, slow lick.
“I don’t know. He said he’d tell us — you, me and Draco — when you arrived.”
“I wasn’t.” Draco was unable to keep the petulance out of his voice.
“Oh stuff it, Potter. Once we have forgiven each other our magical cores will no longer be recognisable, the first step in the ritual will no longer be possible, and the prophecy will melt away.”
The kiss was surprisingly nice. Should kisses with old rivals and new teammates be nice? Harry’s train of thought was interrupted as Draco pulled away, his cheeks flushed as his eyes darted across Harry’s face. Unable to shake the feeling that he’d missed something important, Harry settled back against the wall, wiping his mouth with the cuff of his sleeve. Most of the yelling had died down and everyone stared back at Harry. Including Draco.
“Oi, you alright?” Ron reached forward to move the pint out of Harry’s eyeline.
“Look, you dramatic fucker.” Harry caught up with Draco, spinning around to block his path. “I know I said that I wanted to do the whole dinner and drinks thing again but I was hoping that we could avoid repeating that whole bit where you constantly leave.” He was breathing a bit heavily, his eyes not quite meeting Draco’s.
“Pans.”
“Your mate’s already here.”
“Yeah, nice one mate.” Ron grinned, tugging Hermione a little closer to him and wrapping an arm around her shoulders.
“You’re quiet,” said Draco.
“What? No.” Harry shook his head. “Just tell me what it’s for.”
“Yes.” Draco cleared his throat. “A firefighter on the other hand.” He smiled, it felt a bit wobbly but at least Potter smiled back. “Now that I can see the appeal of.”
“It’s the consent charm,” said Draco, smiling softly at Harry. There wasn’t even the hint of a sneer, and Harry was a bit distracted by how... non-prattish Draco looked.
“Idiot.” Draco was properly smiling now, reaching forward to wrap an arm around Harry and pull him along the street. “Come along, Tod.”
“Ah, sorry.” The owner of the stand called out and dashed from behind the table to grab the dildo, which was wiggling on the floor. “This one’s a bit excitable today.”
“I know, I—”
The corner of Potter’s mouth twitched. “Do you want some of my brightly coloured glass?”
“Well, I... you’re an attractive man, Potter.” Draco’s mind darted back-and-forth, collecting all the different parts of his post-war relationship with Potter and trying to assemble them into a scenario where this made sense. “I can’t say that I have... not that I wouldn’t... I...”
“Did she tell you that she was setting you up on a date with a man called Liam?” Draco sounded like his father, he hated when that happened.
“Overworked? Thinking of putting in for overtime, are you?”
“Oh goodie.” Grimacing, Draco experimentally lifted his left foot and tried to take a step back. It didn’t work. This time Harry grabbed him, settling an arm around Draco’s waist. “Not that I don’t appreciate having the Chosen One wrapped around me—” Draco tried to take another step and swayed again, “—but we should probably try to complete the course—”
The door slammed with Hermione on the outside and Draco on the inside.
*~*~*
“He said that the same men who tried to kidnap me last month had also tried to take Draco.” Hermione was back to business, flicking her wand to finish off the sandwich as she returned Harry’s stare. “He said that they’d try again and that I wasn’t safe in the house.”
“Er, no. Not so much. Not unless you want to go back to trying to kill each other.” Lost for words, Draco shook his head. “Right,” Harry turned his attention back to the last platform and made the leap. He peered down at Draco as the two platforms drifted apart. “Me neither, thought you were a bit of a tit, back then. Also a Death Eater. But now...”
“Yes, but-”
“Hmm.” Draco rubbed at his own mouth, glanced at Harry and then looked away again. “Hmm.”
“Indeed.” Dimly, Minerva realised that they were already talking about bottoms, and that it was probably the ideal scenario for some flirting, but her mind seemed to be moving rather slowly. She watched as Rolanda fiddled with the end of the broom. “Do you... have you given much thought as to how you’ll create camaraderie within the new team?”
“No, I’m a trainee-instructor with the Auror academy.”
“No,” Draco shook his head. “I don’t think I am. Will you cast a
“Oh?” Harry started piling his plate with toast and eggs, happily noting that the toast was all cut on the diagonal. “Are you at my beck and call now, to make up for the hangover potion?”
“It’s actually an ancient Anglo practice.” The arse reader was explaining to Ron. “The Anglos believed that a man’s fortune could be foretold through detailed examination of his anus. Of course, now we know that a lot of that was sublimated homoerotic desires and confusion over the translation of some awkwardly rendered runes.”
“They’re not that bad, are they?” Potter ducked his head to examine the table.
“More as in...”
“Your scar?” Draco nodded. “It is incredibly unsightly.”
“I... that is not-” Shouts interrupted whatever self-incriminating thing Draco had been about to say. The Aurors had started their raid on the Cereal Monogamist. His heart clenched as blue and purple spells lit up the steamy windows.
“So with this in mind, we should focus on transformation.”
“I. Did. Not. Know.” He spoke through gritted teeth.
“What. I...” Draco trailed off, frowning at Potter.
Potter beamed and began happily burbling on about James’ last Quidditch game as Draco immediately allowed his mind to wander.
“Scared, Potter?” Malfoy asked, his eyes locked on Harry’s. It felt as if Malfoy was asking for a lot more than Harry’s public embarrassment. As if he was dredging up their past to see whether it should stay buried forever or if future could be built on it.
“Oh fuck you, Potter,” said Draco, appearing in the kitchen doorway. “I have absolutely no intention of giving up
The rest of the Ministry of Magic Magical Mudders team (someone really should stop letting Draco name things) watched her progress for a while, then turned their attention to Draco.
send a lot of Patronuses (“Patroni”, he corrected himself). Malfoy seemed a bit cross about it in a loud, happy way that made his pale cheeks flush and his eyes shine.
“Righto.” Ron drank the rest of his pint.
Taking Potter down a peg or two was usually enough to put a smile on his face and, after the Slytherin team’s rather bruising show matches, Draco needed a win. Something to take his mind off the ever-percolating worries about his future and the sneaky suspicions that his ferret form had developed Magical Mange.
“No one is being forced to kiss anyone,” Angelina was saying. “We’re playing with the charm or not at all, and-” She was interrupted by a snort from Marcus. “Swear down I will come for you as well.” The Slytherin Captain’s snort turned into a gurgle as Angelina continued, stepping back to address the whole room. “If we play by Muggle rules, then Oliver, Marcus, Mafalda, Millicent, me, Fred, Astoria, Harry, Greg, Draco and Alicia can’t play. So what... we’re going to sit around and watch Katie, George and Cassius snog each other?”
“Doing something? What, like getting chucked out of a restaurant most people wouldn’t pay to sit in?” Ron’s question sent Draco spluttering.
“Alright.” Harry stands in a rush, too fast for Draco to step back. They are standing very close, the air warm between them. Turning slowly, Harry hikes his t-shirt up under his armpits, exposing his lower back.
“Fred and I are exclusive,” said Angelina, being careful not to look at Fred while she said it.
“No.” She yanked her hand away from his. “You’re always bloody protecting him. Why? All he’s ever done is spread poison and use you to seem better than he is.” Her voice dropped. “You don’t need that, B.”
in the middle of Muggle London?”
“Not for a well-established prophecy,” said Malfoy. “But the prophecy Snape found is fairly new.”
“Oh god.” Nigel interrupted. “I can’t stay and listen to this filth. Deal with her, will you Draco?” Without waiting for an answer, he slammed out of the room.
At least Draco’s Slytherin side had stopped him from being the first to volunteer. That dubious and potentially dangerous honour went to Ginny.
“Are they?” Hermione turned to Harry, her face all scrunched up. He hated it when something he did made her look like that. “Are you alright? I’m sorry, I know how much you liked him. Do you want me to talk to him for you or—”
“Right.” Malfoy cleared his throat. “Right.”
Yes. Harry was willing to forgo an evening doing redacted and redacted with Draco in order to spend time with the Malfoys.
“Yes.”
“I thought we’d be given the same dish?” said Draco, eyeing the multicoloured contents of Potter’s bowl. His own bowl was half-full of browny-grey mush.
“Even worse, Angelina was a full minute behind the two of you, and she’s about to finish.”
“Go get him, tiger!” He slapped Harry on the arse for good measure and then started retreating backwards his eyes still on Malfoy. He made an ‘I’m watching you’ gesture with his fingers that he learnt from some film. A muscle in Malfoy’s jaw twitched. Whether from annoyance or from amusement, Harry couldn’t tell.
“Actually, you’re both the reason you’re standing around in mud.” Angelina was the last member of the team to enter the swamp, Draco absently noted that Ginny had nearly finished, and Millicent wasn’t far behind her. “Because, you know, you’re not bloody moving.” She reached out a muddy hand, as if to ruffle Harry’s hair.
“Mm, of course.” Glancing around, as if to admire the crowds, Narcissa continued. “Your father will have his way and you and I must be seen to support him.”
“You.”
“No.” Ginny’s smile grew a bit. “But thank you. I
“Are all girls this comfortable with blood and gore?” Draco heard himself asking.
Knowing that everyone knew he’d wanted to kiss Draco made Harry seriously consider flying his broom into the nearest wall. His shoulders were tense and it felt like his face was on fire as he imagined them all looking at him, knowing that he was hoping it would land on Draco again.
“The flirting? The sexual tension? You really haven’t seen it?”’
“What are you up to?” he asked.
He counted to 100 as he stood in the drafty corridor outside the classroom. Then he counted to 100 again. Then one more time.
“And another thing,” Draco said, picking up his complaint from before, “as Seekers, you and I will be flying far more than any of the other players. Getting used to a new team requires a great deal more training than flying with tried-and-tested teammates. We’ll be worn out before the tournament even starts.”
, had become rather breathy. When Malfoy reached for another flask - this one full of rainbow glitter - Harry stopped him.
“Draco!” Molly bustles out of the pantry, a steaming dish of apple crumble floating behind her. “Be a love and check on Harry? He’s in the-”
“Really?” Potter frowned. “I didn’t think they were friends.”
“Er…” Hermione was frozen, even her righteous curls were still.
“It’s a terrible pub on a British highstreet with a lot of drunk pixies hanging around outside. Now.” Draco took a step closer and braced himself for an immediate interruption. When none came, he exhaled and smiled down at Harry in a way that he hoped made him look charming and not nervous enough to do some vomiting of his own. “May I invite you to my home for dinner and a decent bottle of wine?”
“No, no.” Hermione swatted Harry, although he could tell she was trying not to laugh. “Be serious. She used to make him do it because Voldemort
“Alright.” The waitress smiled at Potter and glanced at Draco before moving away.
“Nothing,” she glanced around at the surging pre-match crowds. “So,” hazel eyes darted back to pin Draco in place. “Have you seen him?”
“You made me breakfast.”
“As I said, fine.”
“I was not...” Minerva trailed off, wondering how much of her conversation with herself Rolanda had heard. “That is to say, I was reminiscing about Igor’s insufferable speech the last time Durmstrang won the European Cup.”
you to stay, and-” His mouth shut with a snap as Harry plopped down on the bench.
“I’ll pick you up later then?”
Harry found Hermione in the kitchen, once the memory charm had mostly evaporated. Stumbling out of the sitting room (“don’t follow me”), he had opened a door, thinking it would lead him out of the flat. Instead he found himself in a kitchen, watching a familiar figure struggle to open a packet of cheese slices.
“Beg pardon?”
“En-enabled? You can’t be serious,” Draco laughed. “You are the one who asked if I wanted to join the team.”
“I can assure you, it is not.” Draco didn’t think he’d spoken out of turn, yet Potter’s head snapped up and he glared at Draco.
“I can assure you, Potter, that we will not be ordering any food,” said Draco. “Or at least you will not be. I will be ordering food with my date who will be here soon and I’m sure very distressed at the sight of a pint-sized saviour squatting in his seat.”
“That... no. This doesn’t make sense,” Harry croaked.
“Oh, I do apologise.” Draco was starting to look irritated. Good, Harry quite fancied a fight. “Spending time alone with an unmarried wizard, what was I thinking? Clearly that denotes a romantic entanglement. I do hope that Blaise, Pansy, my own mother, Theo, Luna and every other friend I have ever spent more than 10 seconds alone with will understand as I am clearly dating them all.” Spent, he collapsed back into his chair, glaring at Harry.
“Hmm.” Draco pretended to consider as he scrambled to collect himself. Sasha and the nameless cleaner were starting to sweep up the swamp. They didn’t look very happy about it. “Why don’t we go any place in the world that isn’t here then maybe a meal? And a shower?” Despite the last few minutes and weeks of heated glances and hesitant touches, Draco found himself half-convinced that Harry would say no.
After a bit more jeering and cheering, everyone calmed down enough for Fred to insist that George had to kiss the lightbulb in the bedside lamp and “leave the lovely Tori unmolested.” Astoria made a most unlovely gesture in return and reached forward to take her spin.
“Sorry, sorry. Of course I’m Liam. I’ll just... go... over... there...” he trailed off, glaring at the top of Potter’s head. Like the rest of the diners, Potter was reading on his phone, and hadn't noticed Draco, yet. There was no cereal in front of him and maybe if Draco spoke slowly and loudly, using only small words, Potter would agree to vacate the table before Liam arrived.
“Going out with me or me thinking that you want to go out with me?” Harry was laughing, too.
“What is this?”
“I know you’re wearing skinny jeans under there.”
“Not really.” Draco reached forward to play with the stem of his near-empty cocktail glass. “I have nothing against underwear models, I just... I, ah, I find myself uncomfortable around people who are required to place a great deal of value on their physical appearance.”
“Tell me who framed you.” Harry asked again, wincing as a phantom hex shot through his left arsecheek.
“Gryffindors,” he shook his head in mock wonder. “So violent.”
They met at the tube station and the awkward silence Draco had been dreading failed to materialise as Harry launched into a blow-by-blow account of his interview and eventual release by the Aurors. He then asked Draco so many questions about Tonks’ interrogation style that Draco was compelled to point out that Harry was interrogating him about an interrogation. Harry’s response was to push Draco off the pavement. Draco hexed him in return and the ensuing argument was so flirtatious that it took Draco a few moments to realise that they were standing outside the pub.
