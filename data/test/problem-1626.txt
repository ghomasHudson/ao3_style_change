"You think so?" Harry asked, his voice crestfallen. He'd just read the glowing email from Sly, excited that the man had spent the evening curled up reading his words and eating his food. It was almost as if they'd spent that time together.
Draco let out an exasperated sigh when Harry's breath against his ear made his cock twitch. Though he didn't voice it, he was hoping the same thing Harry was – they definitely weren't fit to be around other people at the moment, and he'd really like to see Cal soon.
He remembered drinking at the club with Bill and Charlie, and the Sobriety spell Bill had hit him with. And then – oh, bloody hell –
"Listen up," he said, his voice still hard. "I could leave you to do this on your own, but it will likely take forever and the Minister is already waiting for you."
He wondered if his friend had realized he was in love with Draco yet. Sure, Harry now knew Sly and Draco were the same person, but had he
. It was lovemaking, pure and simple, Harry thought with a satisfied grin that was quickly lost in another of Draco's intoxicating kisses.
He backed out of the cupboard entirely, casting his gaze around the rest of the house. It looked nice enough. Small, but clean. There was no evidence that the family who lived there wouldn't be able to properly care for a child.
He'd spent as much time as possible with Cal over the last week, and he'd come to the realization that Gryffin – Harry – would never stand for an innocent child to be hurt because of their relationship. It would be hard to keep things under wraps, but together, he was sure they could manage it.
Draco felt like an iron fist was squeezing his heart. His son had been refusing to leave his side for days, and he'd assumed it was because he was adjusting to having him back fulltime. He'd never even considered that Cal thought he was taking care of
Harry stood quickly, throwing a signed document on Pansy's desk – his official request to be removed from the site.
"I've been meaning to look you up," the man continued, leering suggestively at Harry in a way that made his skin crawl.
The thought of Malfoy revealing that tidbit of information to the press – which Harry fully expected he would – took care of the remnants of his erection, and Harry sprang to his feet, his napkin falling to the ground unnoticed.
sorry about that in the morning," Charlie said, ready to defend his honor – and his heterosexuality.
"I'll allow six questions," Harry said, studying the crowd carefully. Every reporter there had raised their hand, eagerly waving it to garner his attention.
"I can't believe you sent him the manuscript, Harry," she chided, her voice stern. She really didn't like where this was heading – if Harry didn't fess up to his identity soon, this Sly person might never forgive him. "You should have told him you are James Evans. He's going to be mortified that he's gushed over it when he finds out
"I'm going to go email him, apologize," Draco said, smiling slightly for the first time since they'd come inside. He grinned as he left the room, laughing at his own joke. "Harry Potter.
"Drain the pasta," he said, hoping she hadn't heard the hoarseness in his voice. It didn't do to dwell on things he couldn't change, like his social standing and the effect it would have on Cal once it was revealed the boy was a Malfoy. He wasn't foolish enough to believe it would never happen; he just wanted to do as much good with the name as he could before it did. "We're about ready."
Harry sat up, glaring at the blond in the doorway. He quickly covered himself with the duvet when it was clear that Draco was about to open the door.
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but Hermione shushed him with a stern look. She settled back into the chair nearest the computer and looked expectantly over at Harry, her fingers poised over the keyboard.
Ron groaned, heaving himself up off the sand after reading the headline. He didn't need to see more than that to know they needed to go home immediately. It wasn't the news he'd been expecting, but it would cause fireworks all the same.
, he thought, grinning fondly despite the being the one to concede. After all, he'd managed to have a marvelous orgasm, and he'd helped Sly have one, too. He stretched lazily, enjoying the slight burn in his muscles from the strenuous wank. He was pleased that Sly's hand had felt so familiar when it touched his cock. Definitely something he could get used to, but surprising since they'd only done it once before.
," Hermione said with a thoughtful frown, tying the twine around the plain brown paper with a spell when it kept slipping through Harry's fingers. "Are you sure it will count?"
"Mmm," Harry groaned, feeling his arousal build, heavy and hot in his belly. He was hardly capable of coherent thought, but his brain hummed with the energy and pleasure of their lovemaking. As hurried as their actions were – Draco was still wearing his trousers, Harry's were pushed haphazardly over his hips, his legs restricted by the pool of fabric – he still wouldn't dare classify their actions as
"The dating site just added a chat function," he said, startled when he saw remorse and sadness in the grey eyes in the mirror. He'd been using the glamour for years, but he'd never seen that expression on the now uncomfortably familiar features. "I told him who I was – that I was James Evans, at any rate."
As much as I'd rather ignore them and write for you lovelies (and honestly, I would!), the thought of sitting in my living room writing slash while hubby's grandmother is in residence is gross. *leaves to go wash brain out with soap, trying to get rid of the image*
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. They belong to JKR. Thanks to Kamerreon for her reassurances and her editing skills!
"Ah," Harry said, his tone faintly disapproving. "I'm familiar with it, yes. Not a member, unfortunately, but I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself, Mr. Wedgewick."
Draco nodded, returning to his task. He'd met Ginny and Theo's daughter a few days earlier when he visited them in the hospital. Draco grinned, remembering how silly he'd felt as he skulked around the corridors of the St. Mungo's nursery, hoping for a glimpse of Gryffin. He knew the man had a friend in labor there as well, and he'd hoped their paths might cross. Of course, he'd had no idea what Gryffin looked like, or if the man's friend had still been in the hospital, but he'd hoped nonetheless. He'd worried that perhaps
Harry nodded, running a finger over the silver lettering. Any of their friends who hadn't known about the silver bond would know the moment they laid eyes on the invitations. If they ever went public with their marriage, Harry and Draco would be forever listed in the pages of wizarding history, one of only a few dozen silver bonded pairs since the time of Merlin, who had supposedly started the practice.
"This, Mr. Potter, sir?" he asked, reaching out to grasp the side of the stone basin. "It was hand-carved in 1611 by a renowned Seer named Chaitali, rumored to be the result of a thirty-day spirit meditation fast."
Draco's eyes widened as he realized what was happening. He couldn't believe they'd managed to hide this from him. He felt the hot prick of tears, swallowing hard to regain his composure. Harry's hand, warm and comforting, slid into his, giving him a gentle squeeze. He could feel his husband trying to calm him through their bond, and he was grateful. Without Harry's calming influence, he might embarrass himself in front of all their friends.
Or worse. Harry moaned, slumping against the wall. A hot blush flooded his cheeks as he wondered what he might have said to the Slytherin in his drunken state.
Draco pulled his head out of the fire when he heard a noise behind him. Blaise had entered the room and was crouching down next to him.
"There's nothing shameful about a Slytherin, brother dear," Ginny said smartly as she slid into the booth next to Harry, snagging a chip as she scooted past.
He jerked to awareness when he heard the peculiar noise again, briefly thanking his war-honed reflexes for pulling him out of his alcohol-induced slumber to alert him to a problem. It had been years since he'd needed to wield his wand for protection, but the instinct was still there.
a present," he assured Hermione, touched that she worried so much about his courtship. True, it was annoying most of the time, but she did it because she loved him. And because she was desperate to find out more about the laws and traditions she didn't understand.
miss deadlines, Harry!" she had said, standing over him and shaking his mostly finished manuscript for emphasis.
"Twenty seconds," Draco rasped, his hand stealing down the front of his silk pajamas and wrapping around his leaking cock.
Neville spluttered, pushing Cal behind him when the three men suddenly appeared in the chateau's entryway.
She blushed under Blaise's appreciative stare, absently stroking the back of her hand, still tingling from Draco's kiss.
Harry winced when his denims landed on the cushion next to him, followed by his boxers and his T-shirt. He looked up, glowering at a fully dressed Draco. He'd taken advantage of Snape's distraction and retrieved his clothes.
Harry sank into his desk chair, exhausted from a full day of editorial meetings for his latest book. The publisher had been pleased with his new photo for the book jacket, but now the publicist wanted him to agree to a three-week tour and media junket.
"You have two portraits," Harry whispered, his voice still brittle with humiliation. Snape had just watched he and Draco –
"His bedroom's up here. Can one of you cast a Lightening charm? I'm just going to carry him," he said, sighing in relief when Draco's spell made it possible to easily heft the sleeping man.
"Draco Abraxas Potter-Black, it is the wish of your son, Caleum Alexander Malfoy, and your husband, Harry James Potter-Black, that guardianship over your son be shared with Harry James Potter-Black. He will be granted full rights as your son's father, and will be recognized by the law and your son's magic as such. Is this your wish?"
A special thanks to Kamerreon for fixing my errors and soothing my ego throughout MLQ. You helped me think through plot lines and kept my grammar in-line. Thanks!
"He loved it, and so did I. In the future, though, don't buy him anything live without checking with me first."
It was true. Harry wanted to get to know the real Sly, but he was having a good time exchanging emails and gifts with him, and he didn't want that to end. What if they didn't get along in person? Harry rubbed a hand across the back of his neck, gently squeezing try to dispel the tightness there.
"Malfoy?" he asked, his eyes widening as he realized the footsteps hadn't belonged to Hermione after all. "What are
Kingsley motioned for Harry to tap the parchment once more with his still-glowing wand. The words he had just spoken transferred to the page in silver script.
"He's fine. I just needed to clear my head a bit," Draco said, suppressing the urge to question Pansy about Gryffin's identity. He knew it would do nothing but frustrate both of them – she'd sworn an Unbreakable Vow. She couldn't tell him if she wanted to.
Draco followed Harry down, grateful for the blind luck that seemed to so doggedly follow Harry. The same good fortune Draco had cursed as a teen was now serving him well; if it had been anyone other than Harry, he was sure they'd be sprawled on the floor at the moment instead of on a very comfortable sofa.
He indulged himself for a few more seconds, already missing his son terribly. He wasn't surprised when Draco materialized next to him, his bright hair spelled brown and his distinctive eyes hidden by sunglasses. He handed their daughter over wordlessly, knowing his husband needed the comfort her small, warm presence could provide.
"Just a little Sleeping Draught," she said with a smirk. Ron raised an eyebrow, and she grinned. "Alright, alright. It was a Calming Draught mixed with Dreamless Sleep. God knows I don't want to be awakened by anymore of his dreams," she said, blushing as she looked away from the sleeping man.
"Harry," she said sharply, squeezing his knee. "He will answer when he can. He warned you he would be out of contact for several days. Just relax."
"What does it matter? We don't need romance," he all but growled, pushing against Harry until the other man lost his balance and sprawled across the sofa.
The thought reminded Harry of the other secret he no longer had any hope of keeping – his identity as James Evans. The cold realization stopped him in his tracks, obliterating the odd but undeniable enjoyment he'd been getting out of verbally sparring with the Slytherin.
Ron grinned, launching into an explanation of the protective spells on the Pensieve and details about the intricate runes that covered most of the rim. Draco and Pansy were both suitably impressed by the story behind the ancient basin, awed by the history and the obvious power that emanated from it.
"That it is, mate," George said cheerfully, grabbing two of the prototypes and stuffing them in a bag for Harry. He held the bag back though, his face sobering. "Ang and I tested them," he said, his face coloring. "And, er, they're good. They work, I mean. But they won't actually physically stop you from, you know –"
" – so you see, it's not alarming, so much as it was just surprising," Daphne said, waving her arms vaguely as she spoke.
The warmth Draco had seen in Harry's green eyes vanished at the words, and he swallowed hard at the surprising depth of his disappointment at seeing the dark-haired man's shutters firmly back in place.
The older wizard hurried over, his eyes widening when he recognized Harry. His bored expression was immediately replaced with one of keen interest.
"The proposal for the warehouse in Diagon Alley should be on your desk in the morning," he said, switching easily back to work mode. "Theo's hoping to get everything finalized before the end of June."
Draco shrugged, lazily retrieving the spilled file with his wand. The papers were still out of order, but it hardly mattered. The Ataliers had just made it clear that Malfoy Industries no longer represented their businesses, so keeping their file tidy was no longer necessary.
"The Traylor contract is solid. The land is already zoned for residential development, so it will be a snap to get the permits we need. It's truly a genius idea, building a gated and warded wizarding community. The lots will sell like caldron cakes," Blaise said.
"Mr. Potter, the contract has recognized and approved your magical signature. Do you stand before me ready to invoke the ancient rite of
He jumped on the sleeping man's stomach, giggling madly when the movement caused Blaise to curse loudly and grab his wand, instantly on the alert for an attack.
Draco thought absently – as he stumbled into the room. Harry had been using the Floo to come over often during the last few days, and Draco never ceased to be amazed at how the normally graceful man always tripped over himself as he stepped out.
"Yes," Harry answered, his hips bucking as he felt Draco's hand fly over his cock, his fingers still buried in his arse. "Now."
She brushed away Ron's question, her eyes narrowing as she plotted. She looked up at Teddy, her face a mask of concentration. It was probably wrong to put so much effort into beating a 10-year-old, but he'd won the past two games.
Draco's throat tightened as the potion continued to work, his muscles shaking with the effort of holding back the information. This was worse than any torture he'd ever been subjected to – worse, even, than the Cruciatus Curse Voldemort had been so fond of using on him every time he disobeyed.
"Really?" Harry asked, turning his head to get a better view. The cut was flattering and attractive, but hardly something he'd have requested.
“I didn’t hear any complaints out of you at the time,” she snapped, looking around in her bag for something to cover herself for the long walk to Gryffindor. Theo wasn’t wearing robes, so she couldn’t just borrow his, she noted with a grimace.
Harry groaned, running his hand through his hair in frustration. He'd been trying to contact Draco for days now, and he'd been shot down at every turn. No Owls. No emails. He couldn't visit the idiot because his home was protected. He couldn't even Fire-call the prat because the house-elves at the Manor wouldn't tell him where he was staying and Draco's secretary seemed to guard him with her life. He'd even tried to drop by Draco's office, mortified to find himself escorted from the building by two burly security guards before he'd even made it past the lobby.
“Sure, sure,” he called back, hoping she couldn’t hear the way he rolled his eyes as he said it. He wouldn’t put it past her, especially since she was holed up with Hermione.
Harry laughed, a bit of unease slipping across his face. He'd talked with Neville about it before buying the puppy, and the man had assured him Draco was planning to buy a Crup for Cal soon. Harry figured it had been a safe gift, but maybe he'd been wrong?
. He'd avoided cutting it ever since that development, hoping to deter his so-called fans, but it was becoming annoyingly unkempt.
He scanned the room for Harry, whom he’d lost about an hour ago. He spotted him in the corner, dancing on a table. Draco growled, angry until he realized who else was there – his boyfriend was currently grinding against a very inebriated gangly redhead.
Harry's mouth dropped open in shock. How could she just walk away from Cal? The boy was perfect. His heart broke for the worry and pain his mother's abandonment must still cause him.
While he wasn't pleased that business had taken Sly offline, so to speak, for the next few days, it did give him a chance to reflect on what he knew about the man so far, which was frustratingly little. Determined to find a way to expedite the process, he sat down with his laptop and his lovely glass of wine to compose another note for Sly.
“Excellent,” Hermione purred, flicking her own wand to banish the half-Transfigured parchment and replace it with a new sheet. She uncrossed her legs, giving Theo a feral smile when he watched the movement carefully. “Again.”
"No party," he said over his shoulder, his smile growing as her eyebrows shot up. "This is all for one person. One very special person."
Pansy's shoulders relaxed at Ron's dismissive tone, relieved she hadn't wandered into some sort of epic battle between the two former rivals. She thrust the box at Draco, sighing in relief when he took her heavy burden.
Draco turned, nodding at the Gryffindor. It was obvious Neville had already had a few drinks from the way his hand was slowly snaking its way up Pansy’s shirt. From the looks of things, she was on her way to tanked as well, since she was doing nothing to stop it.
Harry laughed, rolling his eyes. He felt guilty that they'd cut their honeymoon short on his behalf, but he couldn't deny he was happy to see them.
Pansy's brow furrowed in confusion. Draco had gone on about how much he admired Harry Potter? She honestly couldn't reconcile the statement with anything she knew of Draco.
"I loved him despite the horrendous things he did, because he was my father. I don't have to agree with what he did to love him."
"I knew you'd be here," he muttered, wrapping his arm around Draco's waist as they made their way through the barrier into King's Cross Station.
"Yes," Harry rasped, closing his eyes as he ran a tentative finger down his own chest. He heard Draco gasp, but his satisfied smirk was gone the instant he felt an answering touch trailing down his thigh.
felt differently. Potter's mask was as seamless as his own. Draco was confident that no one – not even Pansy – would be able to see the tension in his shoulders or the carefully guarded panic in his eyes.
"So," Harry continued, not waiting for an answer. He knew Draco well enough to know he wouldn't speak until he was over his snit about Harry's lateness. "I figured out a way around the no-touching thing."
Draco had no idea where either man lived, but Theo did, so he took charge, calling out a destination that sounded vaguely familiar to the blond. When they stepped through the fireplace, he realized it must be the Black ancestral home. He'd been there once or twice as a child, but he remembered it being much darker and dirtier than it was now.
"No," Draco said firmly, sliding a few more Galleons across the table to the pouting witch. They disappeared quickly, and so did she, sauntering off to another table. "You'll thank me in the morning, trust me."
"So beautiful," he heard Ron slur as a topless witch leaned down in front of their table, apparently intent on giving the bridegroom a lap dance.
"This is bone china and crystal, Harry," she said, shaking her head and plunging her hands into the suds. "Scourgify is too rough for delicate pieces like these. You obviously want to keep them, so that leaves the old-fashioned way."
Ginny lifted an eyebrow at Harry, looking from his face down to his mostly uneaten plate of chips. He held his hands up in surrender and she grabbed the plate, smothering the chips in loads of vinegar.
He hadn't realized how much he had been looking forward to bringing the man into Cal's life until that moment. Feeling like a voyeur, Draco stole further back into the shadows, not yet ready to turn his back on the beautiful sight of a completely relaxed Harry Potter holding a sleeping child, his eyes glinting in the soft moonlight, his hair ruffling slightly in the summer breeze. Draco had no problem at all imagining a similar scene, with Potter holding Caleum in his arms.
He did know, if not whether or not Malfoy was guilty, that it couldn’t be as dark as it felt. He’d been in all the courtrooms before, had given testimony dozens of times. He’d always been able to see the whole council, and had never felt as though his attention was so unavoidably drawn to the suspect. He’d never had to hold on to the railing to keep himself from tripping as he took his seat. It had never been the case that the accused was the only thing he could see.
Draco bent forward and dropped to his elbows. Harry inhaled sharply when Draco’s stomach trapped his cock between them. Experimentally, Draco rolled his hips again, and Harry’s moan resonated through him.
Harry smiled at that. “Right. I can’t honestly say I’m sorry, can I? Not when it was so important. Or, um. When I’m not sorry.”
Offering another Seeker’s game as recompense was a stroke of brilliance on my part, entirely instinctual. But it got another brilliant smile out of him. We’ll play Wednesday night.
Potter glanced over, but didn’t stop pacing back and forth on the opposite side of the room. Of course he wouldn’t know how to behave in a gallery. Not enough of a posh arsehole for the basic rules of decorum.
“Happy to, and I wouldn’t be anywhere else,” Draco answered honestly. He pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek. “Is that your way of saying we’ve got to go back in?”
Luna stood over the stove. Ron and Hermione were at the sink. Standing next to each other beside a butcher’s block, Dean and Draco were waving their wands at a pair of potato peelers. Draco brandished his wand in a very peculiar pattern, and he and Dean both dissolved as the peeler carved an elaborate “D” in the side of the vegetable.
“That’s amazing, Dr—” at Draco’s sharp look he turns it into a cough, ending with “Malfoy.” He coughs again for good measure. “Sorry. Pollen.” He smiles weakly. “That’d be amazing in the field.”
Harry set his pint on the bar and let himself be pulled towards the dance floor. He was awkward at first, moving too tentatively to look at ease.
And then a fourth surprise. He paused. Nodded once, held my gaze for a moment, then ducked under my arm and disappeared down the street.
“Think of how good that’s going to feel with my cock inside you.” I only hope it’s true. I’m quite certain that
It wouldn’t be Mother, who had just returned from a fortnight in Tuscany, or Father, who had gone seven years with nothing more than a terse missive in the beak of his Siberian crane and showed no signs of changing course. Pansy and Greg didn’t pay their own rent, let alone make international calls, and Blaise and Millie only called when they were already in town.
Having already charmed the device, it was easy enough to change the tune. Something breezy and romantic off the dreadful new Weird Sisters album; they’re as preoccupied as Potter with the idea of love.
With a sigh, Harry pushes back the covers and trudges towards the bathroom. Draco likes them to get to the Ministry at least five minutes apart anyway; might as well get started showering, and let Draco sleep a little longer.
“That’s door number two, removing the Wand. Then there’s door number one. Magical aversion. A patient spends so much time in a magical void that exposure to magical energy becomes overwhelming.”
Draco hoped he succeeded at keeping his face impassive. “Ah. I suppose the elves can serve breakfast twice.”
The sixtieth day after the Battle of Hogwarts marks the start of the trials. Easiest cases first. Stan Shunpike, the Cattermoles. Three dozen, at least, easily dispatched on the first of July.
He was at dinner tonight. Of course he was. Idiot. I’m an idiot. He’s at dinner every night. Most every night. He was sitting between Granger and Weasley. Joking. Laughing. They adore him. All of them. Thomas and Finnigan. Ginevra, whatever her intentions. Patil and the remaining Creevey. Longbottom. They protect him. His happiness. He seems to glow around them. Was glowing tonight. Over steak and kidney pie. Not everyone can manage that, to look good over steak and kidney pie. To look happy. Free.
Potter’s head was bowed, but Draco thought he saw his eyes come back up to Draco’s cuffs, first one and then the other.
He stared openly, taking it in, until Potter’s breath began to even out, and Draco looked down. He was still half-clothed, his shirt and waistcoat and jacket hanging open, his trousers at his thighs. A gentleman in a suit, with his limp prick hanging out. Fresh off of fucking a former childhood nemesis with his jeans around his ankles, no less. The absurdity of it hit Draco before Potter could even turn around.
, you might find dropping trou a bit more useful than craning your neck like a first year in Flourish & Blotts.”
Harry handled the crowd gracefully, accepting envelopes with broad smiles and earnest thanks. He shook hands and smiled and laughed at jokes, though Draco didn’t miss the hint of relief when Granger came to join him.
Potter looked up again, letting a bit of a smile through this time. “It is possible to enjoy things without magic, you know. To be fine without it.”
Without translating, Harry began to ride him in earnest, pulling Draco up to sit facing him and twining his fingers through Draco’s hair as he bore down on the hard cock below him. “
He roars. I push down. I’ve survived many epithets and ‘gentle’ was never among them. Whereas all the words Potter’s using certainly were.
Draco tucked his prick away and hastened to do up his flies and all of his buttons. He might be a bit mussed, but there was no need to wander around with his dick looking like a bespoke bloody elephant.
And didn’t I see that I hadn’t won at all? That she’d got me to give up my one big chance at love, over an idle threat? Over a suggestion?
Draco raised his glass again. “Cheers,” he said, and threw it back, with mental apologies to the Jameson family. He sat it on the bar. “Fancy a dance?”
Slughorn’s a possibility, always an ear to the ground, but he’s not exactly keeping too many upper year Slytherins around, except Blaise.
“Yeah, though it’s been six months, maybe seven, where I’ve really wanted to hear about you, too. Tell you mine if you tell me yours?”
“I’m not asking you to make a decision right now, and I know I don’t know the ins and outs. But what if, instead of living there and travelling here, and vice-versa for me, you lived here and travelled there?”
I had just gotten up to follow Pansy to the showers when he came into the common room. He smiled, mouth and eyes both, and asked if I was coming to look for him. Joking, of course, I think, but not an opportunity to miss. I said yes.
I keep trying to piece everything together but I just can’t be sure yet if I’ve got it all. It’s such a blur. I gave a statement right after, and they’re going to let me read the Auror reports, cause I guess I was the intended target of the actual curse and they’ll need me to go in front of the Wizengamot and tell them all the same stuff again if they take her in. They’re still deciding whether it was an accident, though I don’t know how anyone could think it wasn’t. They’re trying to be fair to her. Would you like that? I don’t even know for sure.
It wasn’t that it didn’t last long enough, but that it was so unreal, so unbelievably fantastic, that the minutes blurred together. It wasn’t that it wasn’t long, but that it seemed not to be time. And then he was stroking himself while I thrust into him, and his breathing grew faster, his grip on my shoulders stronger, and then he was coming, arching and groaning and calling my name, and I let go of everything, filled him, let it carry me away entirely.
He smiles again, then slips his lips around the head of Draco’s cock, which is almost as red as Harry’s lips.
Whether for better or worse, the owls were coming and going with enough frequency that my parents began asking questions. They may not have been overjoyed with the answer – Father seems rather committed to forgetting it and Mother’s anxious glances are perhaps not the ideal break from her tears – but when I told them I was going to London for New Years they didn’t object. Mother did ask if they could reach me at Blaise’s, but even after I corrected her assumption…nothing. Which is, I suppose, better than many of the alternatives.
A third point for Granger. Draco was starting to hope she did something properly loathsome in the near future. “Granger.” He nodded, then looked to Robards, Croaker, and Shacklebolt in turn. “You can’t remove the implant.”
Potter pinched the curtain between his knuckles and let it drop again. “When I get the letter I’m going to tell them to schedule for the morning of the 2nd. If you have a solution before then… maybe. We’ll see.”
“Yes,” Harry said. His eyes were glazed. “Yes, I want. Fuck, Draco, I want. But…” he trailed off nervously.
It was more thrilling than Draco cared to admit. “Didn’t realise you knew much of anything about good manners. Or perhaps caring about them is simply beneath you? That must be the case, if all you can think to ask is whether you can escape your loathsome, onerous evening of standing around eating crudités amongst Britain’s most well-regarded artists.”
“52.9630 North, .6042 east. It’s the Titchwell Marsh Reserve, and you’ll need to walk down the boardwalk toward Fen Hide. There will be signs. Draco’s veterinary clinic is Disillusioned, but attached.”
Draco cut him off. “They’re house elves. They have plenty of protective magic. This is their forte. And frankly, they’d be offended if we brought in contractors.”
He shrugged his suit jacket on, the better to retrieve the key from its pocket. Holding his breath, he slid it into the lock and turned.
“Drop the ‘off’ and you’ve got yourself a deal.” He pulled Potter’s jeans and pants down over his arse until he could see the swell of his bollocks, and abruptly stepped back, dropping down into one of the seats opposite his desk.
His work was coming along too. Uagadou didn’t take visitors—about which Draco was a bit relieved once spring was in full bloom—but Madame Sissoko made introductions for Draco among the community of Malian expatriate wizards in Paris. Whereas Draco came to Muggle science through and for his magical research, Professor Traoré had done the reverse, and the combination of her work on nervous disorders, including their relationship to magical deprivation, was a perfect match for Draco’s own. It was a ten-minute walk from Draco’s office to the École Normale Supérieure, and long brainstorming lunches with Amina became at least a weekly ritual.
“You can return to the task at hand and identify the next item.” Draco moves to stand beside another desk. He rests a hand on the tabletop to, Harry realises, keep his fingers from shaking. “Writing desk, mahogany, early twentieth century. Familiar?”
yesterday. “The Boy Who Grieves.” Utter tripe, but hard to miss, and a major lapse to have let it slip my mind.
Potter shot to his feet, looming over Draco. “You’re a lot of things, Malfoy, but you’re not an idiot. I’ll give you that. So think about it. Think about that meeting. What they said. The plans they were making.” He laughed, a bit madly. “Let me guess. ‘He’ll be our ultimate weapon!’ ‘He’ll single handedly save wizarding kind!’ ‘Let’s put him in a cage!’ ‘Let’s put him on the streets!’ ‘Let’s write down everything he’s ever said and sell it on street corners!’” Potter laughed bitterly. “Sound about right?”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Definitely not.” He took another swig of his lager, draining it more than halfway. “If you’re sure.”
The first was the easiest to discover. His neck was aching and twinged when he tried to lift his head, which was at an odd angle on an unfamiliar armrest.
“Jordan,” Draco spits. “Was this your grand idea, or his?” He laughs, low and harsh. “Or have you become a cheater?”
The footsteps grew louder and, with a snap, Prippa Vanished Draco’s cloak to parts unknown. Probably his wardrobe, Draco reminded himself. In the blue rooms. To which he could go at any time.
“I thought it best not to share this information with one of his oldest and dearest friends when he has not yet, at least to my knowledge, come to terms with it himself.”
Still, given that the parties involved were Gryffindors, watching them was almost as telling. Granger rushed to scoop Harry into a hug, which he returned, though with tense shoulders that belied the sentiment.
“He goes to a lot of big family events with children present. Of course there have been incidents of accidental magic near him, but it’s the children, and nothing out of the ordinary.”
Harry stepped closer, so Draco could feel the heat of his chest. “I don’t really want to stick my finger in your ear.”
“Good,” Harry said. “I’m glad. And when I thought about it…” He took a deep breath, as if preparing himself. “When I thought about it, I realised that… I’ve been very lucky, to have relationships with people who I trusted, who… well. I guess I’ll just say that things were good, in all sorts of ways.”
Draco couldn’t stand the idea of Potter trying to let him down easy. He’d rather rip the plaster off. “Well then—”
“I know, and I know you’re good at it. I’m not trying to say otherwise. Just that I could be helpful. I’d like to help.”
“More?” He barely dared to whisper it back, but then Potter nodded and Draco had to bite down on his lip to keep from moaning. He gave him more, rolled his hips heavily into Potter’s and felt it when Potter pressed up into him, seeking the friction, the weight, of their bodies together. Potter moaned properly, then, his neck bared as he arched his head back.
They kissed, and that’s how he felt Potter coming first; his jaw fell open, his shoulders strained against Draco’s, he threw his head back and for a moment, Draco felt bereft of it. Then Potter went entirely still and Draco realised what he was witnessing, and his own cock jerked at the thought of it, that it was Potter in his hand, Potter he could feel spilling hot and sticky in his palm. It was Potter draped limply between him and the wall, still gasping, still stroking him.
He relaxes his hips, pulls back as far as he can against the wall, and slams forward into Harry’s waiting mouth. Harry moans around him. Draco does it again, and again, and Harry’s humming around him and brings his free hand to Draco’s hip to urge him to go faster, harder. Which Draco does, through a stream of exhortations he’s not even fully conscious of, requests for, “More,” and, “Deeper,” and, “Take it, fuck, take it just like that,” and praise for being, “So good,” “So hot,” “Best fucking cocksucker in the world, the way you fucking take it.”
. Protocols. High levels of departmental responsiveness and efficiency. Before you, of course. Before you showed up with your accidentally Vanished house, with no idea what you own, not the faintest idea of what you’re mucking up.” Draco laughs, barks, fury coiling in his chest. “Not even a second thought for anyone else.
“More,” I confirm, pulling my fingers out, repressing a victorious exclamation when he raises his arse off the bed to follow them.
He crosses his arms. “Your sense of what is or isn’t practical and beneficial has certainly changed.”
Draco shivered as she brushed his cheek. “You look so much better that you used to. In and out of your trousers.” She removed herself and floated through the wall. “Eat his words, he will. Hmph.”
Draco took up his position against the chair. “I imagine this will be similar to our experiments with atmospheric charms. I’ll ask you to focus on a particular feeling. As much as possible, you should dwell in that feeling, let yourself experience it. And then, when you’re ready, cast.”
Your mum thought you’d probably want to know what happened when you woke up. There’ll be the reports and things, but she thought I should tell you too. I think maybe she just wants to know, but I don’t know what you’d want me to tell her or if there are things that would get you in trouble, so I just told her I’d write it down.
Potter led him into the void, past two clusters of settees, and past his usual bergère. He settled into an identical chair at the next window. It had a mate on the other side of the window frame and Draco took it, torn between being frustrated by Potter’s determination to keep him at a distance and being glad of it.
“We’ve focused on fairly powerful magic, and on magic that trades on positive emotions, as has been the plan. And we still will be, at least in part.” It was like watching walls come up as Harry realised what that meant, and Draco rushed to continue, to reassure him. “But you won’t always only feel those emotions, as you know, and making sure you’re prepared—”
The Aurors’ briefing room was warmer than the Unspeakables’. Much warmer. Draco could feel beads of perspiration collecting under the heavy wool collar of his robes. Of course, the Aurors wouldn’t think to adjust the temperature. It would be far too unlike them to be concerned with anyone’s comfort but their own. Though
Pansy’s been really playing up how sad she is, telling everyone it was a terrible accident and that she meant to cast Rictumsempra instead of Sectumsempra, like those two are that easy to confuse. She had organised a big healing circle kind of a thing in the Great Hall after dinner so people could send healing energy or some such rot. Mostly so that she could cry in public. She was giving this great big speech about how she had tried to bring you over to the side of the light and how much she missed you and how you were an example of what happened to people who didn’t move forward with the times, standing up on a bench in front of everyone.
He hopes. It’s something he seems to do a lot of these days. Which, Luna had pointed out, is an important change on its own. Though it hurts more than he remembered, this churning, achy feeling that’s seen him to sleep and woken up with him these last few days.
“That sounds delightful,” Mille confirmed as perfectly roasted Cornish hens appeared on each plate, framed by vegetables.
“Okay.” Harry still sounded sceptical. “You realise that category includes the Venomous Tentacula and the Mandrake?”
Of course, I have pulled recently. Not with any member of Dumbledore’s godforsaken Army, but with a level of skill that would do Salazar proud. However, this sort of thing requires discretion, and Pans can’t keep her mouth any more shut than her legs.
“I’ll take that as a compliment.” Harry kept smiling, even as he narrowed his eyes in mock-suspicion.
“That may be, but it doesn’t stop them from trying. Now that Weasley’s story about getting into the Chamber is public knowledge, it’s only so long until somebody stumbles on the password.”
He felt Potter sit back, felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end as Potter’s hands roamed over his thighs and up his back and down again to his arse. He canted his hips, pressing into Potter’s touch when Potter grazed a fingertip over his hole. He realised he never should’ve doubted; it might not have been saving the world from Nundus, but of course Potter would be the sort of man who made sure his partner came.
Without looking at them, Draco returns the set of photos to their folder and shoves them into his desk. “I’ll handle this.”
He held my hand as we walked into the Hall for breakfast. I had relaxed my fingers, trying to tell him it was all right to let go, even though his hand in mine had become remarkably familiar over the course of yesterday. The consequences of such public displays are not insubstantial, and I know that he must know that. Still, he was having none of it. I would’ve ascribed it to stupidity not too long ago, but somewhere between Quidditch practises and yesterday’s meals and our lesson in Muggle construction, it turns out he’s both funny and clever. And not at all how he’s made out to be. He’s got a real sarcastic streak and a hint of biting wit. Though he melts in an instant when kissed or held, or when I tell him I love him.
“Do not speak to her that way!” Croaker wheezed. “I might remind you that as an Unspeakable she outranks you absolutely and unequivocally.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed. “Always yes.” He moved his hand from Harry’s jaw to his cock and wrapped his fingers around it. He stroked the shaft slowly, once, twice, pushing his foreskin back and watching Harry’s eyes follow his hand. He let go and reached out again, crooking a finger under Harry’s chin and drawing him up so their eyes me. “Please.”
He almost didn’t notice when one of Potter’s hands loosened its grip. But then it was at his waistband, the fingers were sliding the top button through its fastening, and then the next, and then Potter—always impatient—was plunging his hand downwards. The solidity of fine wool held Potter’s hand close, and his strokes were firm and strong. It was almost too much and entirely too little.
After another moment’s pause, Potter steps into Draco’s line of sight and Draco’s survey begins. Potter’s wearing the motorcycle boots again, along with those snug, dark jeans, and then the green jumper. Draco draws his eyes up Potter’s body. By the time he reaches Potter’s face, he’s delighted to find the beginnings of a blush. He quirks an eyebrow.
He tried rolling over again, facing out into the office with his knees pulled up and his side wedged into the crack between the seat and the back. It felt like he was slowly pressing his hip into concrete.
Draco took control of their joined hands and ran them along his side, where his wand sat holstered close to his ribs. “Mutual.” He raised an eyebrow.
“No.” Malfoy tilted his head to the right, just like he always had; the mirror Malfoys seemed to lag a fraction of a thousandth of a second behind. “Just didn’t expect to find you here.”
Without the heat of Draco’s body above him, Harry is suddenly freezing. He follows Draco’s lead, pushing himself to stand.
His heart pounds as he takes the stand. An Auror waits at the bottom of the stairs he’s just ascended. There are two more on the floor, one at each of Malfoy’s elbows. Malfoy feels so far away. It all feels so far away, and he's hungry again, and the room is almost as cold as it was with Dementors circling overhead, and where to begin, where to go, with him and Malfoy and the things they’d said and done in the course of a war?
“I must agree,” Robards added. “Aside from needing Potter back in the field, inquiries from the press are increasingly aggressive. We can’t hold them off forever.”
Five minutes after he was meant to arrive, the maitre’d led Draco downstairs. It was quickly apparent that he needn’t have shown Draco to the table. The entire downstairs was conspicuously empty, with Shacklebolt’s shining head straight in front of him. To his left, Millicent’s blunt bob. To his right, with hair that was still unmistakeable on such a humid day, Granger, whose presence was almost enough to make Draco turn tail, if only because he was loathe to join any sort of team that thought Granger might be persuasive.
Draco’s cock ached with want, and he thought he might not last when he felt Potter’s arms wrap around him, languorous at first, and then tighter. Potter moved his whole body into Draco’s, rolling them over until Draco found himself underneath Potter’s weight.
“Yeah, socks, you know. They’re warm. Dumbledore always –” He pauses. They haven’t gone there. Shouldn’t go there. “I’ll be alright. Trainers’ll probably be dry by the time we get back up front.”
Tentatively, almost worried it would break whatever truce they'd reached, Harry pulled back and reached his hands forward. He looked up, half hoping and half afraid that Malfoy would be watching him, but he wasn't. Malfoy's head was tilted back, the long line of his neck cast into shadow, his chest rising and falling. He stilled when Harry moved, but didn't pull away.
“The Ministry has an entire department devoted to public relations and you couldn’t find some sort of cover story? You’ll excuse me if I find that difficult to believe.”
s the note. Mother sends him chocolates, and all her love. He doesn’t have much of an appetite these days. He gives the sweets to Higsbee.
His 162nd Monday in the Vanishing Department starts out promisingly enough. He has time to enjoy a proper breakfast before he leaves the Manor. There are no angry clients waiting outside the front office. There are a reasonable, but not unmanageable, number of additions waiting for him on the dais. The pile is becoming wieldy. He might even, if he skips a dusting or two, have the whole mess conquered by the end of the week.
In the last two weeks he’s sorted through furniture so dusty he can barely levitate it without inciting a sneezing fit, house elf heads, suspiciously stiff Gryffindor-red sheets, a revolting nest-pile of filthy linens, pots with Merlin-knows-what caked to the bottom, and a hollowed-out troll’s leg that serves no discernible purpose whatsoever. This morning he caught a glimpse of a semi-pornographic Muggle poster, and the further in he gets the more certain he is that the polite coughing from within the pile belongs to a portrait or two. Though with his luck and this pile it could be mould gone sentient.
He slipped in beside Harry, who was gushing over an elderly witch whose granddaughter was apparently well on the way to single-handedly revolutionising the role of the Beater.
Draco followed her into the dim main corridor that led down the East Wing, past a dozen dozing portraits, the doors to the ballroom, the drawing room, a trick staircase. She turned into the music room without giving him a second glance. He paused for a steadying breath before closing the distance and turning in after her.
Potter frowned. “Being empathetic and trying to see the best in people isn’t the same thing as being a doormat.”
Lifting one hand from the desk, Harry shifted his angle and grabbed his cock, moving until just the tip grazed Malfoy's hole. He pushed forward slowly, and gave up entirely on suppressing the shuddering moan that reverberated through his chest as he was surrounded by tight heat. He rocked back again, and then in again, still slowly, barely hanging on to his reserve but determined not to be too rough about it.
“Daily diagnostics, magical exposure, interviews and examinations, extensive research, and frequent consultation with Ms Granger and Ms Bulstrode.”
Harry dropped his handful into the pot, wiped his hands on his trousers, and reached, tentatively for the wand.
Still, something scratched at the back of his throat. His arrangement with Malfoy hardly extended to anything resembling friendship, but surely a biscuit would be permissible, if he could find one.
The moon was high enough and full enough to cast light over the shoreline and Harry had the distinct sense that he ought to be looking at it, but his entire focus was trained on Draco.
He moves with alarming speed and precision. Harry’s a bit awed by the rate at which he pulls shelving units down and creates parallel lines stretching down the aisle. When he reaches the end, he turns back to Harry and points to the first one on his right. “This one?”
upset about the blind item. Not exactly a pleasant day at work, thanks very much. Pretty crap move of you, really. I mean—is that what you asked me here to apologise for?”
“No, no,” Harry replies, embarrassed. “Just lost sort of a lot of things. Vanishing spell got a bit out of hand.”
Draco was two seconds from pulling out his hair. “And if he decided to jump off the Eiffel Tower, you’d let him do that too? Hold his hand on the way up?”
“I don’t mean any disrespect,” Potter offered, the earnestness of his tone completely at odds with the blankness written across his face.
“Of all the things I thought I’d never live to witness, Potter, seeing you reduced to a glorified potato would’ve been too unfathomable to even make the list.”
things. He likes nice things. He wants nice things. A nice house and a nice girlfriend, well, or a nice someone? And a nice garden and probably a Crup. Two Crups. A Crup and a Kneazle?
.” The stack contracted and then, with a pop, produced an identical stack. “Do you ever listen? I told you there was more to it than that.”
I woke again when it grew warm, this morning. His windows let in quite a bit of heat with the light, and our bodies, still pressed so closely together, had generated a fair bit of slippery, sweaty dampness. He stirred when I moved off him and reached for me. He didn’t wake till I laughed; I didn’t mean to, but his stomach let out a growl worthy of a Blast-Ended Skrewt. He cracked an eye open at me and, thankfully, smiled.
Draco, peeking between his fingers, looked towards the bar and let out a plaintive moan, flattening himself over Harry to, it seemed, try to hide behind the arm of the settee.
He is expecting rude remarks. He doesn’t get them. Instead, Malfoy pushes him against the nearest wall, almost sends the back of Harry’s skull into the bottom of a mounted elf-head plaque, and growls, “Bedroom?”
When he went to see Potter the next morning, Draco found Granger waiting for him at the end of the corridor. She was pale and fidgety, looking down at the floor and rocking back on her heels, clearly trying not to pace.
I pull him towards my face. He’s startled enough to roll his hips, and I feel as much as hear his gasp when I go to work, licking, sucking, kissing his hole.
He huffed, but he felt his shoulders loosen. “I know. I do. It’s just… frustrating. To say the least.”
Draco turns to Potter. He’s wearing the dragonhide boots they’d retrieved. The uppers are loose around a pair of jeans that aren’t dragging on a floor. They’re dark and fitted, loose in the calf and snug through the thigh. He’s got on that black jumper again, or one just like it, with a hint of dark hair peeking over the V. His hair’s not any different, but the rest of the sartorial shift makes it look more intentional. The clothes don’t do anything to change Potter’s face, though. The tentative openness Draco finds there is almost becoming familiar, if no less irritating.
Compared to the previous morning’s eagerness, Draco’s trepidation about going to see Potter was especially noticeable. He took an unusually long time over his breakfast tray, even though he managed all of a slice of toast and cup of tea. He spent a truly unnecessary amount of time dressing, particularly given that he wound up in work robes as always. He even found himself walking slowly, which he wanted to blame on a hangover even though he’d only had a drink and a half over the course of the night, which couldn’t explain why his feet felt leaden, or his stomach sour. That was all down to his intense desire to avoid Potter.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut for just a moment as he turns the doorknob, trying to steady himself. He knows the bedroom’s not any better and he sure as hell doesn’t want to think of the last time Draco was here, or what he’ll have to say about it now.
Malfoy’s eyes snapped to his face, and he felt more naked then than he had all evening. But he knew he wanted it.
“It is. And, with this, we’ve run through every exercise I had planned. We might do them all again, or come up with more, but there isn’t really a need for it. As far as control, as far as integrating the Elder Wand into your casting, you’re as improved as I’d expect. Maybe more so. Continuing the exercises on your own should suffice as long as you continue working with Healer Barrett.”
Draco’s heart twisted to match the pain writ across Harry’s features. He thought it probably showed. He hoped it did. That Harry would know that.
It felt good. It all felt very, very good, to be moving again, to be free to walk down the Rue Saint-Jacques with Luc in the morning, or to leave his office when restlessness struck mid-afternoon and go further, turning down the Quai de Montebello to stare at Notre-Dame across the Seine. He felt more relaxed than he had in ages.
“I don’t have to,” Draco said again. He looked at Harry, saw his pulse pounding in his throat, the shallowness of his breathing.
“I imagine this, most honourable Warlocks.” Harry paused as though to collect himself. “And imagine the fear that would have overwhelmed me. How insignificant I would have felt, to learn that my place in our world was predetermined by people who I had never known, whose names I did not know. What does it mean, to a child, to learn that before being a member of this magical community, or a student at Hogwarts, or a member of their house, they are the product of their ancestry?
It was a violation of the statute of secrecy, but Harry figured the Ministry owed him one or two dozen, and he turned and Apparated on the spot.
It was almost an hour before he looked up. He saw Millie and Blaise first, entwined on the dance floor and so entranced with each other that when a shirtless, be-glittered bloke attempted to grind up behind Blaise, Blaise very sincerely apologised for bumping into the man. It left the poor bloke thoroughly flummoxed, and Draco laughing too hard to dance with any sort of finesse.
There was no way Draco was going to be able to sleep. It would’ve been impossible before he was locked in with Potter—thus the idea of a good old-fashioned all-night piss-up—but the idea of closing his eyes on someone so determined to find him in the wrong was…not exactly restful.
“I’m fine, Malfoy.” Potter’s voice was steadier than Draco would’ve expected. “Just focused on the actual mission, instead of batting my lashes at you over spaghetti carbonara.”
Draco does not hesitate before Apparating to Grimmauld Place. He does not pace in front of Number 12 before stepping through the wards. He does not hesitate on the landing before he knocks. He does not find himself at a bit of a loss for words when Potter opens the door. If his throat constricts, it’s just because it’s fucking freezing and really, someone as powerful as Potter ought to be able to spare a warming charm.
“Pass on the elves,” he said. “I’d rather the Hippogriffs, and burnt elf fingers smell awful. Terrible idea, even as that sort of thing goes.”
And the extra time spent with Pansy and Blaise, to reassure them that he won’t disappear on account of Harry.
“When you ask why I’ve done this… I’ve told the truth, whether or not you believe it. I can’t tell you that I’m always certain it’s unselfish. I can say, though, that it feels different to want peace. That what I want now, what I’m working for now—it feels different than anything before it ever has.”
“It could not have been my plan to ignore you, as it was not my plan to have you for breakfast at all.” Draco pulls the paper from under a pile of discarded parchment. “C1. What do you see?”
He turned the water off and inhaled the steam. It filled his lungs with heat, and when he exhaled he felt fresh and cool. There was nothing like a real shower.
Though he would concede that that could be the aftershock of the…he still couldn’t get his head around it.
Not just his ears. It rang through his chest, through his veins. He had cared what Potter thought, but the possibility of that mattering had never been real enough to motivate his work. He had taught himself to believe in other things, and he had done it for other reasons. It mattered to him for other reasons. That Potter believed it was incidental—but Merlin, it was blissful all the same.
He moans, quietly at first, as I take one into my mouth and let it drop again, moving to lave the other, and back again. He bucks against me. I do my level best not to do the same to the mattress.
A witch Draco didn’t recognise raised her hand. Weasley signaled for her question. “Why is Auror Potter in a void? Aren’t they usually reserved for dangerous cases?”
The building seemed even more ominous than Harry remembered without any hustle and bustle to distract from all the glass and steel and the cavernous echoing they created as his boots hit the lobby floor. Malfoy had been quicker to agree than Harry had expected, and it seemed the meeting time had helped convince him rather than becoming a point of contention. Maybe the effect of the building at night was part of it. Heartless and cold and sterile was probably the sort of thing that made Malfoy feel that much more at home after seven years spent living in an underwater dungeon. And he probably expected it to throw Harry off.
“Was the Lion of Gryffindor this modest the whole way through? Change behind your bed curtains, did you?”
Draco bit back a smile. Six years of astronomical success at Barclays had got him a bit used to leaving people speechless, but seeing it on Potter’s face came with an extra edge of nostalgic charm. “All a bit unfamiliar? Fine, then. How did you get here?”
“I’m offering you a genuine solution. One that will require maintenance, yes, but a course of treatment that addresses the root cause and that might, given the nature of his condition, make Potter a fair sight happier in the long run, too.” His frustration swelled, as did his voice. “And you’d ignore that for an untested, superficial treatment that may or may not work? Is it that impossible for you to acknowledge that Potter didn’t make it through unscathed? That he’s ill? That your grand hero is in need of assistance? Does that make him less to you, or—”
“Merlin,” he breathes. “You…” He traces his fingers down the row of buttons concealing Draco’s sternum. He wants to undo every inch of him. This man who works in forms and protocols. Who responds beautifully to requests. It’s something Harry can work with, that. He wants it badly enough to try.
He looked away from Malfoy then, down to his hands. It was too different, too strange, to be catching Malfoy’s eye across a courtroom rather than a dinner table. Rather than one of their naked bodies.
Draco had anticipated that. “Would you, then, consider it as a favour, from one duty-bound professional to another, and for the sake of scientific research that could help those suffering from magical illnesses, to begin this course of treatment in the few days before you leave? It will only give us very preliminary data, but it would be helpful regardless.”
“Fine. Your cock. If the issue is that I need to… you know.” Malfoy sighed. “Fine! Need to get fucked up the arse, is that better?”
Harry looked at him, just looked, and Draco resisted the urge to squirm, or to argue. “Guess that makes sense,” Harry said, finally. “And you will?”
“Okay.” Harry said. “It’s June, probably. Sunny, but not too sunny.” He opened his eyes. “I don’t know how to do this.”
anything. Even Malfoy’s smirking announcement that a pair of thigh-high leather boots are also in a men’s ten doesn’t jar him too substantially, though it’s not exactly expected, as possible revelations go. Somewhere between the idea that he’s got something of Sirius’ and the unnecessarily specific shoe-related jargon Malfoy expects him to know, he’s gone a bit numb.
Malfoy spoke through gritted teeth. “I am a young gay wizard who’s just had a willing arse bent over his desk. Of course I’m hard.”
“I’ve felt others, but someone required my undivided attention immediately upon arrival. I haven’t exactly had a chance to take the tour.”
Draco was determined to go back to sleep on that note. Except the sound of the Floo was bloody irritating. And sort of…off.
“There’s Quidditch on the WWN this afternoon, if you’d like to listen in the library. The Magpies are set to trounce Puddlemere.”
Fine, then. Malfoy wouldn’t let him in. That didn’t mean he was giving up. He planted himself on the wooden bench and waited.
is my world. Pansy and Blaise and Slytherin House. Money and power and the finer things. Not some dusty garret. How long would that last? A sawdusty season, perhaps, but it’s not a way to live a life. Not once you’ve had the best.
Draco hasn’t managed to say anything by the time Potter steps away, shakes his head one last time, and leaves the room. He doesn’t manage to say anything for several minutes after. He knows there are ten hangers, and he’s half hard again already, and Potter still smells like the same soap and has the filthiest mouth this side of the Leaky. And, he finds, he knows very little else. Or if he does, he’s not admitting it.
He doesn’t look away, even as he slips the thin cotton over his head. As soon as it’s off, he’s holding my gaze and begins to lie back. He crosses his arms behind his head, aiming for some sort of a challenge. He succeeds, though I’m loath to admit it. He looks as accusatory as he does trusting.
Draco had meant to defuse the situation. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, and as soon as that look passed over Potter’s face, he knew he’d done the opposite. But then, if their past record was anything to go by, there wasn’t anything he could’ve safely said, not even Potter’s name, without being misunderstood to the point of near-blows.
He wraps his hand around the thick leather of Potter’s belt. It’s smooth in his hand, cold where Potter’s skin is hot. He runs his fingers to the buckle and pauses, leaning in. “Do you want it?”
With a sigh and a smile, Blaise leaned back. “That was delicious, Draco. Not sure there’s even room for more.”
It was so fucking tight, and the touch of Potter’s skin so electric, and there was Potter, naked, hard, plastered to his window, on display for all of London and singlemindedly fucking himself onto Draco’s cock, and Draco had no desire whatsoever to say no, or do anything but bury himself entirely in the moment.
“Aren’t we supposed to, I mean, I thought Tuesdays and Thursdays, we were, that those were our days to –”
“Listen here, Potter. Everything I’ve done, everything I do, is completely in compliance with Ministry regulation. Completely. My solicitors and accountants, Muggle and magical, look over every penny, every charm I cast,
It might be Pansy or Mill, and Draco would be happy to see either of them. Or Greg, or Blaise. Or Galder, though he wouldn’t have knocked.
Potter cuts an imposing figure. He isn’t taller than he was at 20, nor has he filled out much in the intervening decade, but that much Draco knows from the papers. From the relentless parade of photos he prints—has to print, really, to compete with
He had told himself a million times that his fears weren’t realities. That he was doing good, that he was doing all of this in order to do good.
“When you left,” Malfoy began, as Edgar rose a fourth time, “I was in the middle of applying to a program in London. A graduate diploma in Muggle biology. I had my NEWTs but no chance outside of a miracle or an Imperius of getting a job with them. I had been unsure of what to do. Rely on what was left of the family money, try to start an Apothecary. I don’t know.”
Potter had the good grace to look vaguely chagrined at the reference to their last conversation as he climbed to his feet. “About that.”
Now that–that was interesting. The Potter in these photos was a different creature to the nervous, flappable bloke who’d let himself be hung upside down over the rug. He had much more in common with the stupidly heroic–and, Draco would admit, self-assured, determined, athletic, surprisingly competent, utterly confident–subject of at least a dozen of his schoolboy wank fantasies.
"Don't move," he ordered, and tightened one hand around Malfoy's wrists while removing the other. He hesitated for a moment before dropping his hand to Malfoy's tie. It was navy, with a tiny houndstooth print, and it felt like silk. Probably was silk. Malfoy gasped, and Harry barely bit back a moan, when Harry reached for the knot, slipping a finger inside of it to loosen it.
, on one twin’s left wrist, meant defence, then its inversion, on her twin’s right wrist, meant attack. Nevermind that anyone with a working knowledge of the Dark Arts could have explained how much more it meant. There was barely anyone left who could’ve told them, even if they’d shown any indication of wanting to know.
The twins were next. Robards hadn’t said as much about them, but he knew the Aurors had found them in closer quarters. They probably would’ve assumed the same combination of a Blasting Curse and impact. Even if they’d thought to do a more thorough investigation into possible variants, the corpses were too mangled for it to be detectable. That sort of damage to the bodies would’ve hidden more evidence than it revealed, not least of all since it could so easily have produced effects similar to Crucio or Transmogrifian Torture, and if they were going to suspect anything else, it would have to be that.
Malfoy threaded a needle and sewed the wound shut with tiny, careful stitches. He bent closely over it and held the tip of his tongue between his front teeth as he worked, then stood back to levitate the bird and spread its wings. Harry was almost certain he heard Malfoy apologise to the unconscious spoonbill when he snapped its wing back into place and wrapped it, with visible tenderness, in tape. He summoned a phial from a nearby closet and, with just the tip of a finger, pulled at the bird’s bill until it was open just enough to slip the phial’s contents inside. When he shut the bill, he gave it a kind sort of caress.
The sun’s burned off any remnants of the kind of dewy mornings Harry usually associates with Draco and he has to shield his eyes to get his bearings. It doesn’t help, really. He doesn’t know where they are, just that it’s green as far as he can see and totally deserted.
Draco couldn’t look away. He couldn’t have looked away if he’d been blindfolded and put under an Imperius. There was no power on earth, Muggle or wizarding, that could have compelled him to look anywhere else.
in a loping script, with a Muggle lightbulb standing in for the dot over the second ‘i.’ “Took weeks, this.”
Draco reaches beneath the counter for another sheaf of parchment. “I suspect you’re going to need a bit more room to write.”
Draco ignores him. “String of 144 petrified fairies. Sixteen self-lighting candles. One large bowl, carved from – oh, goodness, from a Goblin skull. One fan made of Augury feathers. One fan made of Occamy feathers. One snake-woven basket.”
Draco moaned and rolled over to reach for his water. Instead of wrapping around cool glass, his hand collided with the sharp edge of an unfamiliar nightstand.
“Thought I would give up everything I’ve worked for, risk a trip to the FSA, just because you asked?”
“You’ll be here in the morning. I’ll have Lobsey check on him tonight and I’ll go see him in the morning. If he’d like a visitor, you can see him then.”
“Oh,” Potter stammered. “Right.” He dropped his arms and inhaled before quickly peeling off his top and setting it next to him.
“Muscle memory, most likely.” Draco’s smile deepens. “Or the distinct possibility that you want to impress me even in your deepest sleep.”
He plastered a smile on his face and dragged Draco towards a circle of friendly faces lingering near the front of the Hall.
He was so close behind me that instead of air my palm pushed into soft white cotton, and he fell back with an indignant, “Hey, watch it!” He held the hem of his t-shirt away from him, examined it. The imprints of my fingers were arrayed over his chest, five distinct marks arcing across his heart.
Draco was taken aback. Though, once again, in the reassuringly familiar sort of way he’d felt when Potter had resorted to ignoring him at the party, and he wasn’t sure what to do with that, other than move on. “Because of the contents. It contains medical advice that I’d ask you, at a minimum, to examine critically.”
It was a mess. Slips of parchment were crammed haphazardly on top of each other, some crumpled at the edges as though they’d caught while being shoved away in a hurry. Harry shifted the top few pieces, lowering his wand so the small ball of light hovered over them.
Draco snapped his head to look. He’d known freeing the elves would lead to disaster sooner or later. Though, upon examination, there wasn’t anything there.
“Yes. It will, I suspect, be co-signed by Robards and Croaker. Possibly Granger and Shacklebolt as well.”
“But before that, I thought we might work up an appetite.” Draco slips the cloak around his shoulders and slips a hand into his other pocket, pulling out a snitch. “What do you say to some flying?”
“It can wait.” Potter paused, seeming to search for the right words. “I— I was thinking of what someone said to me last night, at the party. It was something about trying things, being willing to see things in a new light. I didn’t want to do that at first, but…I think they were right.”
He could’ve come just from that, he was sure, and then he felt one of Harry’s hands slide up his thigh, to the crease of his arse, and up, a finger tracing up his balls and finally wrapping around his shaft. Draco whined, low in his throat, and canted his hips for more.
“Since you’re creating something, rather than producing a general atmosphere or conducting your energy towards a tangible thing, a wand might be easier, but either should work.”
“Please,” Harry murmurs, looking up at Draco. “Let me touch you.” He presses his hand into the ridged outline of Draco’s erection, hoping that will be enough to make his meaning clear.
He stopped as the waiter came in bearing plates of vegetable tartlets. It was, as an added benefit, another moment in which he could get away with watching Harry, who was preoccupied with watching their server.
The silver banged around as she jumped in relief. “Thank you Master Draco, sir! Prippa will be telling Mistress Pansy!” She popped out of the room, tray and all. Draco wished he’d had the presence of mind to ask her to leave the tea.
The tomatoes could do nicely. Not the first time someone had tried to Vanish an “heirloom” and sent the bowl along with the tomatoes. They’ve begun to liquefy and he can imagine the wet splattering sound they’ll make when they’re blown to pieces by the impact. If only he could throw them at the walls and see the results for himself.
“I’ve come to ask for your help, Malfoy.” Potter’s face twisted into nervousness at the end of the sentence, as though he’d been just annoyed enough to get through the start of it, and lost steam as he remembered what exactly he was asking, and of whom, and how it was likely to be received. Which Draco thought showed better judgment than the request itself.
Draco stood and Harry stopped talking. Draco swallowed, and just managed to lift a hand, to gesture to the space between them. “May I?”
He wonders how many other men Harry’s reduced to incoherence. How many men he’s got down on his knees for. Made moan. It’s almost enough to stop Draco. To make him pull Harry to his stupid feet and kick him right back out into the ballroom.
Harry closes his eyes for a moment to keep from rolling them. He takes a deep breath and tries again. “Can you be more specific?”
Harry studied him, and Draco resisted the urge to squirm under his gaze. “It’s… Well, not okay, obviously. Not really okay. But I understand you asking.”
Draco reaches for a book that’s too high for him to quite be able to reach. He has to stretch for it. He leans up and those stiff robes fall against the line of his body. Harry’s eyes are immediately glued to the sight.
The leather squeaked, as though Malfoy was leaning on it. “You do realise you’ve still got your clothes on.”
The door clicks shut. There’s a trace of the beat, of the bass. It’s as loud as your steps in the pools of last night’s rain. It’s as loud as the cars that roll past out of sight. It’s as loud as his breath against your neck. It is as loud as the
“Ministry regulations, including officially issued forms and correspondence, serve an important role in the day-to-day functioning of Britain’s bureaucratic agencies.”
“I’m saying that it hardly matters what I have or haven’t done when you’ve already drawn the sort of conclusions that compelled you to have me arrested in our post-coital bed.”
Harry nodded and hugged her, gently guiding her away from the bathroom in the process. “Not if we can help it, promise. And we’ll come find you as soon as it’s done.”
Though the people are interesting too. People who he’d wondered about sometimes, since the end of the trials. Who he’d wondered if he would ever see again. Not that he’s thought about it much, but it had been a bit strange to go from spending the better part of a year following him to going on the run and still bumping into him at every turn to reading about him all through the trials, testifying for him, and then never hearing anything more. It makes sense that he’d think about him from time to time. That he’d wonder. That he’d be surprised to bump into him after that much time had passed. Really surprised. Shocked, even. And a bit curious. Though he doesn’t seem to have changed all that much, circumstances aside. A little taller, maybe. A bit broader through the shoulders. Just as sharp, though.
They stepped through the Floo in order. Weasley first, then Goshawk. Harry followed only after extracting Draco’s promise that he’d follow right behind. He was searching for Harry when he stepped into the Ministry atrium and fell in line right behind him. Within moments, Wilkins stood behind him to the left, and Finnigan came last, to the right.
Potter was, as ordered, on the treadmill, jogging at a steady pace. He was flushed and sweating a bit, but not to any sort of abnormal degree.
There wasn’t much precome to work with, so I sucked one of my fingers until it was wet, and watched him as I set it against the crease of his arse. That bloody Gryffindor just spread his legs further, so I could see the fine dark hairs that pointed me onwards.
He was pressed to the wall, pants around his thighs, prick heavy in my hand, my spunk still scenting his breath. I had a solid grip on his arse, all firm muscle, tense and shaking. He didn’t pull away. No, not until I slid a finger down the crevice of his arse and pressed against his hole.
He counts backwards from ten. At six he turns the page he still hasn’t read. At three he tamps the edges of the stack. At one, he looks up.
Training his eyes on the fence, he wills himself towards it again, manages to settle on the top rail with considerably more aplomb this time.
“Yes,” Draco said. “As is the case for me; people in my position are…well, certainly not sent out to advertise it at dinner.”
“My home, my work… I have a life in Paris. This was never meant to be… all of this. I have commitments, I’ve said I’m going back.”
Though even that basic fact of the world doesn’t save him from that hangdog, kicked puppy sort of a look when it’s brought to his attention, as though he really thinks this Ministry will be better than the last. As though he really
“We’ll be attending as dates, is that right?” Potter’s voice is so insistent that it’s barely a question.
No fireplaces, and they couldn’t have been connected to the Floo for a Muggle event even if they’d been present.
the colour seems a bit lighter because it was rather desperately in need of the rigorous Scourgification we give every Vanished object.
Noise in the background grew louder, and when particular chants grew distinct we both snapped out of that strange, warm haze. There was about to be a game on, and it wouldn’t do to be seen like that, for either of us. Which is why I withdrew my hand. I’m not sure why he didn’t let go.
Granger moved to speak, and Draco was glad he resisted the urge to throttle her when, of her own volition, she sat all the way back, tucked her fingertips back under her legs, and waited for Harry to speak.
When we joked about it after, the charity stuff, was that a lie too? Cause it seemed like things started to change between us then. You were being more honest with me, not sucking up and following me around and stuff. And all those Quidditch games. You really did seem different. Less angry, less like you were trying to push me away. Like you wanted to be there. Like you liked taking the piss which, for Merlin’s sake, Draco, I liked it too. There aren’t a lot of people who will just treat me like that. Like a normal person instead of the saviour. And you always have, except when you’re taking the piss about that too. Do you know how much I like that you’re just you around me? That you hate doing charity (even if you were beyond an arsehole to that old lady) and you make fun of everything and you’re not walking around just pretending like the war never happened? It’s not that I didn’t know you might have been trying to fuck with me, but there were so many moments where I was just sure that you weren’t. Where I liked spending time with you so much, and then wanted you so much, that it was worth it to take the chance. And it seemed you liked it too. You smiled, and sometimes it seemed like you were scared the same way I was. In a good way. Like when I took my shirt off, on the pitch that time. I’m glad you weren’t just grossed out, though I guess I know that by now. But I was scared, cause I would’ve – I wanted you to touch me then, already. And I think, having read all this, that you wanted to, too, and you were just scared of what it meant. But were you really that angry afterwards? Was it because you were being a bad Slytherin, or because you were being a good one?
Harry nodded, though it took him another moment to move. He perched on the foot of the bed, then slid over it, pushing himself back to the centre of the duvet.
“Yeah, cause I’ve never done anything dangerous near the Chamber of Secrets. Can’t possibly imagine what that would be like.”
“I’ll take my chances. Though given what Hermione had to go through to collect all this, you might want to keep the butter knives on this end of the table.”
If Draco hadn’t caught the hint of a tremble in it, he would’ve been put out. “Don’t speak too soon.” He took a long sip. “The finer things are best savoured.”
Harry thought he might be sick. “Why would he agree to investigate the case if he’s the killer? Why help them solve it?”
His back tightened when Malfoy slipped his fingers into Harry’s waistband and pulled. Harry spread his legs apart further, keeping his jeans from dropping below his thighs, and tightened his arse. Malfoy laid a hand on the middle of his back. “Relax, Potter.”
fucked Finch-Fletchley before. And no one’s ever fucked Pansy before, unless you count the entirety of Slytherin house and, at this point, half the members of Dumbledore’s Army. How she keeps it a secret I’ll never know, but her strategy is painfully obvious: she’s got spectacular tits and no reservations about using them, or that stupid charm she’s got wedged between them.
I worked him between my finger and mouth, then, letting him rock into each sensation and trying to keep up a rhythm. I stopped when he did, but it was only to ask me for more.
Draco, feeling as nervous as Harry looked, stepped over Harry’s legs to take the other end. There was plenty of space between them, he reasoned, and he didn’t want Harry to think him distant. He shifted, and shifted again, trying to get comfortable.
He was panting heavily by the time Draco pulled away, grinning. “Not that I’m unhappy to see you, Potter, but that’s a ritual candle you’re humping.” He laughed, breathy and low, at Harry’s confusion. “I do appreciate the enthusiasm, but perhaps you’d best save it for the ritual.”
Draco felt like he might vibrate out of his skin. In fact, he was fairly certain that only the occasional calming touch from Blaise or Pansy kept him from shattering under the strain of the evening.
Harry tries for a saucy eyebrow waggle. If Draco’s face is anything to go by, he’s missed “saucy” by a mile.
Draco takes two long strides around him. Harry looks up at him, distressed, and Draco scrambles. “Proper cataloguing. Have to tag each item.”
“Well then perhaps you’d like to find them yourself.” Draco has regained enough confidence in his own iciness to turn and face him again.
With his eyes still trained on Potter, Draco threw it to the sofa. “Shall we see what’s underneath, then?”
“Yes. I was doing my zoology field placement at the time, and he came in one day, shadowing one of our veterinary experts for the week. Muggle-born. He was very quiet and very kind to the animals.”
Harry nods slowly. Almost, Draco thinks, still nervously. Harry scoots down the bed, bracketing Draco’s legs with his own, and lays his fingers against the waistband.
Fortunately, Blaise was willing to trade one serious lapse in discretion for another. Not sure whether Pansy was more indignant about the idea that there was a war hero she couldn’t bed or that her tits might not be enough to make Longbottom forget she’d tried to kill one of his best friends, but the look on her face when Blaise and I agreed on both counts was almost as sweet as seeing Blaise up Longbottom’s arse will be.
Millie, bless her, was trying to ease the way with Scotch and the sort of concise briefing that got one promoted to an assistant to the Minister. Though after the third glass, he was no longer sure if the two were complementary or at cross purposes.
It only urged Harry on. He slid a hand up Malfoy's side, until he was gripping Malfoy's waist, his fingers digging into the open waistcoat and the lining of the suit jacket sliding over his hand. Holding him like that, Harry could feel it when Malfoy started to tremble, was tight enough against him that he could feel the tension in Malfoy's thigh. With one hand firmly on Malfoy's waist, Harry moved the other to his cock, which was rock hard and dripping.
It wouldn’t open. His instincts were still right, technically, but the first set. The ones about being shut out entirely. He pushed his whole weight against it, but he could tell the resistance was more magical than physical. He thought about banging, and it was only the memory of the spoonbill—Edgar, apparently—crying out as he stretched his wing that kept Harry from trying to charm his way in.
Draco stills at the word and Harry’s heart skips a beat. Something’s working. Something, finally. He says it again. “Please.”
“There was no mismanagement,” Granger bit out. “We worked within the constraints of this case to the best of our ability and, as you are clearly aware, the Elder Wand is a significant complicating factor.”
“Well.” Potter leans his broomstick against the wall and folds his arms across his chest. “You wanted to apologise?”
“The Ministry…” Draco sighed, at a loss for how to begin to explain the machinations he’d witnessed. Created.
“A car might be a good start.” He glanced down at his watch. “And I don’t mean a shiny new Vauxhall. I’m off, Potter.” He looked back up. “I’ll be back in thirty minutes. If you haven’t come up with something substantial by then, I’ll have Kate block your calls and security ban you from the building.” He started moving towards the doors, stopped, and cast a few quick wards. “If anyone else comes in, I’ll know about it. And remember, this is just the apology we’re negotiating.”
Draco moves to pick up the next item. Potter’s hand closes over his. “Malfoy. What aren’t you telling me?”
“No, we left all the carnivorous furniture with Walburga in the old Black residence. Besides which”—he cut off Potter’s riposte—“the Statute of Secrecy is rather a concern, what with all the Muggles about.”
Quietly, he gathered his drawings into a tidy stack, running his thumb over the edges as he walked towards the kitchen. He’d been at it for hours; he needed a nightcap, and so, a tumbler. He shoved the pile of parchment into an empty drawer near the relevant cupboard, jamming them back as they caught on the edge, and left the room, glass in hand, to walk towards the bar and the glow of a roaring fire.
"To help with a crime!" Draco answered. He studiously avoided looking at the switchboard and tried to sound defensive, as though it was some great surprise that his good friend Harry Potter wouldn't drop everything and come help him. "They've taken quite a few things, I think."
Potter didn’t say anything, but looked more and more crushed as the realisation hit. He hid his eyes, turning his focus to a grey kitten trying to attack his fingers.
“I have a list.” Potter stood and held out a battered mobile before Draco had even finished closing the door. Damned shame, not least of all because the door on the left was squeaking, and somewhere there was an office manager who needed to hear about it.
“There’s nothing Draco doesn’t know about the project, and his insights into how Voldemort would’ve protected the Chamber during the battle have been instrumental. Besides which, we’re almost certain that the ritual will take two people, and he and I are the only Reconstruction Committee members who are willing. He has to know everything.”
“Is this what you’re looking for?” Draco slid his cock into the crevice of Harry’s arse. “D’you want me to fuck you?”
The numbing sensation of the void hit Draco as he followed Potter back into his sitting room, leveraging his weight to pull the door shut behind him.
Potter tries to peer over it. Draco is thoroughly satisfied that the mop of his hair barely pokes over the top. “Malfoy?”
Draco’s quick to realise it’s not a question. Potter’s thoroughly sex-addled, and if there’s an excuse for confusion that Draco can abide, that’s it.
“Robards will tell everyone this has been a ruse once it’s all over. There’s no need to contradict him, or form any sort of attachment. Simple release. Well worth it, if it will keep you from throwing the mission.”
He was visibly straining to keep his eyes off my towel. Few are more familiar with his intense stares than I, and this was not one of them. He was staring at the ceiling, pointedly avoiding me. Afraid of where his eyes might wander, perhaps?
It’s just so hard to tell what he wants. Difficult to strategise when the target is so unpredictable.
He slams into Malfoy and bounces off, stunned. Malfoy doesn’t look any happier about it. There is, momentarily, an irritated twist to his face. Harry’s stomach churns.
The very tops of Harry’s cheekbones flushed just a bit pink. “Might’ve done. But they might not know, for one thing. And it’s just not the same as asking.”
A long moment’s silence hung over the room before Pansy crossed her arms and sighed. “Gryffindors. Can’t even exit a room without making it an act of war.”
The night before rushed back in. Potter, his intimations, their intimacies. He closed his eyes against it. How had he got here? What were they doing?
Draco ran his hand over Harry’s skin, still running hot, like the Mediterranean sun or a fireplace at Christmas. He looked towards his hand, away from Harry’s eyes, to ask his question. Had to. “Do you ever wish you had?”
“It’s not all the same to me.” Draco held out the handle of the wand. “You can, of course, decline to do anything I suggest, but if you’re willing it could be quite instructive.”
“Okay.” He went to put a hand on the door but switched at the last moment, without seeming to notice, to rest on the stone wall of the Manor. Outside of the void, Draco noticed.
“Buckbeak.” Potter’s breath was quick and shallow, his chest rising and falling rapidly. “You knew that before that class, with Hagrid and Buckbeak.”
Harry licks the tip, and Draco’s eyelids strain. He takes deep breaths. He counts backwards from 20.
Still, I swallow when I see his hole. I’m so big, and he was so well prepared, that he’s still open for me. He’s slicked with lube and his hole is dripping as my come runs into the crease of his arse.
“Don’t say anything.” Malfoy met Harry in the waiting room with Edgar on his arm. “Do you understand?”
“You’ve helped me retrieve everything that was Vanished from my house. I would like to invite you to come see it in person, properly arranged, and to share a drink with me from my newly abundant collection. You pick the bottle.”
Potter tipped slowly forward. Draco just had time to catch him before his face collided with the stone.
I would have asked her what of it, but she had it out of my hands and was reading aloud before I could get a word in edgewise. The article, if revolting, is slightly more palatable without Pansy’s dulcet tones:
Potter shook his head without bothering to look back. “Completely sealed in with security and anti-Apparition charms.”
Stubbornness – that was the feeling, he decided. He gathered the bird in his arms. “Not a problem. Coordinates?”
Draco pulls his hips back, lifts the fabric away from himself and, in one motion, lets his trousers and pants drop to the floor.
“Well, you see, the photograph, and his statement about the photograph, were really rather good for Mr Jordan’s social standing. He’s been seeing Donaghan Tremlett from the Weird Sisters for three weeks now.”
He’s everything Harry’s fantasised about. Hard in all the right places, lean and strong, pale skin stretched across jutting hipbones that fairly call out for Harry’s lips.
“What?” I don’t know if I need to hear it again. I don’t know if I’ve even heard it correctly the first time.
Right, then. He straightens his robes and turns towards the dais. He’ll sort some items. It’s his job. He’ll do his job. That’s perfectly reasonable.
,” Harry’s breath hitched as Draco plowed into him, his thrusts coming faster and more erratically. “
But more to the point, the duvet is half turned back, as though Harry had only finished making one side of the bed. There are trainers strewn under the wardrobe and several sets of robes thrown over the chair. There’s a water glass and a glasses cleaning cloth and a stack of
Besides which, a quieter voice added, he would have believed him, then. Five hours and several lifetimes ago.
“Oh.” Harry fidgets. Another inadvisable subject. “Well, uh,” he scrambles, “how about Miss Havisham?”
Beginning to feel more secure in his return to terra firma, Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Yes, we do. Some of them more immediately useful than others.”
“The wards on the property are embedded in the very foundation, as well as many of the root systems on the grounds, and some predate the Magna Carta by over a century. Do you really think it would accommodate WiFi?”
Harry groans and sinks down, and Draco is there to meet him. He relaxes his throat and takes Harry in, and he can feel the moan that resonates through Harry. “Fuck, Draco.”
Harry follows him halfway down an aisle, resisting the urge to crane his neck. The shelves are epically tall and crammed full of every sort of shoes Harry’s ever seen, plus some he hasn’t, but he doesn’t have the time for a proper look. Malfoy’s a fast walker and unlikely to take kindly to another collision.
It’s far lighter than he’d expected and, thankfully, not too warm, but Harry’s no less confused about what they’re doing.
Croaker and Robards looked distinctly dissatisfied, but seemed unwilling to challenge Shacklebolt directly. Robards took a turn: “We’ll look forward to hearing from you afterwards.”
Harry surveyed the room. “How could any just society not want to make amends for these unjust acts? Who would we be if we did not, as is written in this bill, ‘protect the most vulnerable’? I have no quarrel with the stated purpose of the bill. Who could?
"Harry?" Draco asked, blinking at the unexpected appearance of Harry's head in his fireplace. They'd just seen each other yesterday, a quiet dinner with Cal at the chateau, and didn't have any plans for today.
Draco held his gaze, waiting a few beats before moving. Instead of responding, he stood quickly, tossing the bracelets onto the table carelessly as he scrambled to unbutton his shirt. Harry almost choked on this tongue as creamy flesh came into view, snapping himself out of his stupor when slender fingers slipped under Draco's waistband, deftly unfastening his trousers and pushing them to the ground.
He wasn't surprised to see Blaise stride into the room moments later, a huge grin on his face. He was sure the house-elves had called for him, probably worried about their master's health. They knew better than to go to Mistress Cissa with concerns about Draco; she wasn't even speaking with him now after a particularly nasty fight a few days ago.
Harry was waiting in a comfortable armchair by the fire when Neville stepped through the Floo. He'd clearly been expecting him, since Nev's favorite Muggle beer was waiting on the table, chilled to the perfect temperature, and held there under a Stasis Charm.
"I still don't understand why he couldn't stay," Hermione said, a deep furrow forming as she frowned.
He looked up, searching through the fog that had settled over the vineyard, his head turned toward the deep, familiar voice. He couldn't see further than the vine in front of him – he had no idea how the man even knew he was out here.
"Morning," he drawled, quirking an eyebrow at Nev before turning his attention back to Cal, who was flying on a toy broom around the grounds.
Draco laughed, cracking the book open. He loved the way the spine of a new book resisted at first, and the way the pages were so crisp.
"None of my concern," Draco said quickly, holding up his hands to stop her. "It's moot, anyway. I've met someone. It's still in the early stages, but I think it could really work out."
Draco smoothed his robes, relieved his erection had finally waned. Blaise had found him about an hour ago, handing him a purple vial with a smirk. Draco downed it without a word, handing the empty vial back to his best man and stalking off to find his son. He hadn't been successful, but since Harry was missing as well, Draco assumed the two were off somewhere together and hadn't worried.
"There should be something from the Diagon Alley Zoning Board in that mess," Blaise said, waving negligently toward the pile. "I took your meeting with the Director of Planning. He wasn't pleased to be dealing with me instead of you, but I told him you'd definitely be at the board meeting Monday night."
– Draco was sure the temptation to sell Caleum's identity and his relation to Draco would have been too much to ignore for him.
is your problem today?" Hermione asked, frowning when she caught Ginny staring out into the sea of people who'd already been seated for the ceremony.
He grinned, shoving the box on his kitchen table as he walked through to his study, flicking his wand to turn on lights as he went. It was late, but he wanted to check in and see if Sly had emailed.
"Speaking of the future," Draco said, putting his glass aside so he could retrieve a large box from behind his desk. Harry's present.
His breath caught in his throat, the words of congratulations he'd been forming dying on his lips. The newly married Weasleys weren't on the terrace, but Potter was. The dark-haired wizard was seated on a chaise, cradling his godson in his arms, his expression soft as he pressed a kiss to the sleeping boy's forehead. Teddy – all long limbs and sharp angles – had obviously exhausted himself in all the excitement, not moving at all under his godfather's gentle caress. Suddenly, the enormity of what he was losing with Gryffin hit Draco.
“And how do you suggest I get there, since you were the one who saw fit to let Hannah Abbott walk off with my robes?”
"He's just winding you up, Hermione," Harry said, squinting as he studied the antique stone basin in front of him.
it's nothing. We hate each other. That's not going to change, no matter how civil we act in public. He's still Harry Potter, and I'm still Draco Malfoy," he said, his tone bitter, remembering the recriminating look the green-eyed wizard had given him yesterday at the mention of the Divitiae Society.
Draco grinned, holding a hand out to help Blaise up from the sofav . He'd make sure the man got to bed, even if he had to place him there himself.
"Mr. Malfoy?" she asked, her glasses perched on her nose as she looked up from typing a contract. "Can I get something for you, sir?"
"A silver bond," she marveled, shaking her head. "Who'd have imagined it? A silver bond from a match made over the internet!"
"Thanks, Nev," Draco said, momentarily shaken by the level of devotion and loyalty that fairly emanated from the Gryffindor. The man's calming presence was exactly what he needed when he was feeling like this. Draco wondered if that was why he'd come here, unconsciously seeking Neville's company.
The blond ignored him, casting several diagnostic charms over him instead. Draco called for Madge, asking her to bring the wizard a glass of water.
Draco held the door for an older witch, smiling and bowing politely as she passed. He'd popped by his favorite restaurant to meet Blaise for lunch. He had something important to discuss with him, and he'd wanted to do it away from the distractions at the office.
"It'll all be over tomorrow, thank Merlin," he said, waiting for Hermione to pull back the covers on Harry's bed before depositing the sleeping man on the mattress. He pulled Harry's shoes off, stepping back as Hermione Transfigured his clothes into pajamas.
"You're right, of course," Wedgewick said, still oblivious to the sexual tension that had sprung up between the two men. "We need to continue on with the petitions. But it was lovely to have met you, Mr. Potter, and to have seen you again, Mr. Malfoy. I do hope
: If you haven't already checked it out, I posted an extra scene from MLQ on my author page yesterday. It's called Snape's Voice, and it shows the unfortunate reaction Harry describes to the sound of Snape's voice in Potions. Hilarity and wanking ensues! *grins*
Neville took another sip of tea, sitting back in his chair. He knew more about the planned date than Draco did, but refrained from mentioning it. Gryffin and Sly had agreed to meet up for a movie, and if things went well, Draco had been planning to take Gryffin to dinner at an exclusive restaurant in Muggle London that was actually owned by wizards. What Draco didn't know was that Harry had made similar plans, intending to whisk Sly away to the very same restaurant. Neville had found the fact that they'd both made reservations at the notoriously difficult to book restaurant amusing at the time, but now it pained him. Another example of how bloody compatible they were, and it was never going to come to light unless Harry and Draco dropped this disinterested act.
Hermione giggled to herself, feeling indescribably naughty as she slung her bag over her shoulder and made her way to the library to meet Theo. No bra and no knickers would make for a very interesting study session indeed. After all, Theo had asked for her help studying Transfiguration tonight. She smirked, sure her outfit would produce at least
Harry watched until the train pulled out of the station, full of pride and anxiety. As the heavy smoke cleared, he saw most of the other parents had left. No one had recognized him, thanks to a light glamour that hid his more recognizable features. Cari had laughed when he cast it, filling his bedroom with delighted giggles and cries of 'Silly daddy! Silly!'
Draco groaned, nestling his face into the curve of Harry's neck. How did he end up in this position? All he wanted to do was shag the man through the floor, and the infuriating Gryffindor wanted to talk about hearts and roses?
Harry laughed, rolling his eyes when Draco launched into a detailed explanation about the ingredients Cal had been experimenting with and telling him exactly why they had exploded. The boy definitely had potions genius potential. Even Snape thought so. He'd been – Harry searched for the right word, but kept landing back on
"I mean, it's not like he told me he was Harry bloody Potter, for fuck's sake," Draco said, shaking his head. "James Evans. Really. I still can't believe it."
"Harry James Potter, Head of the House of Potter, Head of the House of Black," Kingsley intoned, nodding toward Harry, who tapped his wand against his family seals. The Potter Seal glowed a deep crimson, while the Black Seal glowed light green.
She glared at him, crossing the kitchen – skirting the spilled Firewhisky – to get him a glass of water, which he gulped gratefully. She started a pot of coffee – it clearly wasn't the time for tea – and threw some bread in the toaster, figuring he wouldn't be able to stomach much more than that.
"You've got to stop testing these things on yourself," Harry chastised, his grin growing when George blushed even darker, his face and hair nearly indistinguishable.
"Could you mention it casually?" she asked hopefully, her eyes traveling to Harry's laptop on the desk, seeking permission. He nodded, and she jumped up, eager to read the latest missive from Harry's anonymous suitor.
wanted to keep Cal close, too. But they couldn't keep hiding him away, especially when Cal wanted the world to know who he was and who his fathers were. Keeping him back a year from Hogwarts on a technicality would have done more damage than good; Cal was much too smart to wait another year to start his formal education, and it was past time he had friends his own age. He had Teddy and Victoire, who were older, and scads of younger cousins, but no one who was close to his age.
He relished the stunned looks on everyone's faces, already predicting what tomorrow's headlines would bring. "Boy-Who-Lived to spend eternity with Death Eater," was his best guess.
"Ms. Skeeter, why don't you have a go?" Harry said, waiting for Hermione to lift the spell on the woman.
Draco was struck with a perplexing sensation of guilt at Potter's words, feeling ashamed that he retained membership in a society the other man so clearly disdained. Which was ridiculous, he reasoned, because he himself never went to the club, disliking it as much as Potter obviously did. Wedgewick blathered on about the society, seemingly oblivious to the dark-haired wizard's tight expression.
Draco clenched his teeth, the low-grade headache he'd had ever since he woke after his run-in with Cartwell blossoming painfully.
"Let's see how Slytherin he can be now that he can't hide things from me!" Harry laughed, ducking when Draco pretended to choke him.
he thought, his head hitting the back of the chair as the strokes became faster, more sure. He closed his eyes, remembering the words Gryffin had used in his letter about the cock rings being twins.
"An official investigation," Draco offered with a wry smile, nodding his head toward the corridor, where three similarly attired wizards were sorting through boxes of files.
Harry noticed Ron had edged up so he was blocking her slightly with his body. He felt no tug on his bond, no reason to think they were a threat. He glanced at Draco, who looked similarly untroubled.
he didn't have someone else write the emails. He flushed, remembering how Hermione hadhelped him write his profile and his initial response to Sly. And what had that gotten him anyway? Two months of trading emails with
Hermione stroked Theo’s balls lightly, teasing every last bit of come out of him. After all, he’d definitely earned his reward, even if a blow job wasn’t what she’d initially had in mind. Hannah had said the party was still going on, though, which meant she’d be able to sneak him back to her room – being the Head Girl had
He would have asked for Blaise's help writing a response, but his secretary poked her head in the door before he could ask.
I'm going to do my best to update over the next week, but it might be difficult. Things are just starting to get interesting between Harry and Draco, and I hate to leave you hanging, but the holidays are upon us, and that means truckloads of visiting relatives beating down Bru's door, all expecting a clean bed to sleep in, cookies and nicely wrapped presents!
"I have to –" Draco was appalled at how rough his voice sounded, and he winced when pain lanced through his tongue. He moved it tentatively, deciding it was still in one piece.
She hesitated, lowering her wand and sheathing it in her wrist holster. Harry was right. She needed to calm down, and a walk down to get some coffee was the perfect opportunity.
," he enunciated clearly, shooting Hermione a grin, "in the Chamber of Secrets," he paused again, drawing it out even more, "with the Sword of Gryffindor."
Draco squeezed their joined fingers, his throat dry as he answered. "I do hereby swear a Wizard's Oath that I intend to marry Harry Potter."
She blushed slightly, and Draco knew he had been forgiven. She closed the door firmly behind her as she left.
"He's fabulous," she said, sneaking a piece of fennel from Draco's cutting board. He made quite the elegant figure, standing in her kitchen chopping vegetables.
Ron coughed again, looking extremely uncomfortable. "Remember what happened to Lockhart? How he ended up in St. Mungo's?"
"Close your eyes," Harry said, his voice low and soothing. He tightened his arms around Draco, letting him feel the warmth of his body. "Just let everything go."
He smiled, his shoulders relaxing as he thought about Sly, who was likely fielding similar questions wherever he was today. It made Harry feel better, for some reason, knowing Sly was just as miserable as he was.
"Some of that Ogden's?" Harry suggested, taking the seat furthest from the fire. He'd gotten a bit overheated on the walk back up to the house, especially with Caleum's warm weight cradled in his arms. Being alone with Draco for the first time in weeks wasn't helping, either.
She nodded absently, wondering how she'd never picked up on the attraction between the men before. It was so obvious now – all those years of fighting, that intense hatred between them. It was no wonder Draco had felt sparks fly when they touched.
Harry was worried about Ron. The wizard had been staring at him all morning, and it was a bit concerning.
Draco was beaming when Kingsley released him. He watched as the man enveloped Harry in a bear hug, laughing along with everyone else when Harry's feet left the ground.
"Well, yes," Neville said, his head snapping up when he heard footsteps approaching. Draco and Pansy came around the corner, stopping short when they saw them.
Harry shook his head, feeling a bit guilty. Maybe he should have? He honestly hadn't considered it. He was about to move toward the wizard, who was now talking with Theo and Ron near the bar, when he saw a bright shock of blond hair by the loo.
Luna watched the little family, knowing she'd made the right choice. It was hard to give the little girl up, but she'd come into this knowing she wouldn't be the baby's mother. Harry had been stunned when she'd approached him nearly a year ago with the offer to bear a child for him to continue on the Potter line. With her blonde hair and light eyes, there was a good chance the child would look like a blend of Harry and Draco, just like Cal did.
Draco's voice was hoarse when he responded, his tone bitter. "He shouldn't have to worry about me. Even trying to do the right thing I manage to fuck it up."
"No? This one, then. He wants someone who will 'allow me to dominate you in every sense of the word'," Blaise said, looking at Draco with a grin.
Hermione nodded, cringing inwardly at the influx of Fire-calls and owls she knew her office would be getting over the next few weeks.
"Had to be something we wouldn't say by accident," Blaise laughed, wrapping his arms tighter around Cal before activating the necklace his godson still wore.
"Er, no," he said, smiling sheepishly. "We found each other on Pansy's dating site. I haven't actually met him yet."
It was unexpected that said acquaintance would turn out to be the same person I'd been pouring my soul out to for months.
Draco gasped as he felt a hand firmly grasp his cock, his heart racing as an unfamiliar callused palm ghosted over the head.
"Be that as is may, we are still honored to be here with them to watch as they reconfirm their love and commitment to each other," Kingsley continued. Draco noticed a sly smile on the older man's face, and his unease ratcheted up a notch. Something was definitely up.
"I still can't believe you gave me Christmas as your last gift," Draco said, and he saw Harry's eyes flash gratefully at the subject change.
The door swung open, and Ron was standing there, a protective order from the Wizengamot in his hand. He blanched at the sight of Draco's bloody mouth, the blond obviously in deep distress. Before Draco succumbed to the blackness that threatened, his mouth opened again, his words slurred by his swollen tongue.
"I hope he remembers that in the morning," Charlie said wistfully, watching Ron take a bite out of a lime wedged between the Irishman's lips.
Harry held the vial of swirling grey smoke in his palm, realizing he was taking a huge step. He'd repressed these memories for so long it was almost as though they had happened to someone else. His muscles felt tight and shaky, and he wiped away a stray tear absently with his fist. It was important that Draco knew these things. That part of Harry's life was over, but it would never truly be gone.
"I apologize, Mr. Wedgewick, but I really must be going," Harry broke in, thrusting his hand at the man so he was forced to take it. Harry shook their joined hands briefly, quickly releasing the man's slightly damp palm.
Blaise watched Draco's face as his longtime friend scrutinized the post. He knew Draco's love life had been a mess for ages. He had a long string of failed relationships behind him. Men either wanted to date him for his money – either to have him support them or support various business ventures they wanted to pursue – or because they enjoyed the status of dating such a notorious and well-known man. Draco was loved and hated by the press at the same time; his every move was splashed across the pages of wizarding publications for all to see. Blaise wrinkled his nose in distaste. He hated the publicity seekers even more than the money grubbers, since they paraded Draco out in public so they could be photographed on his arm. Draco hated the press and he hated going out; though he'd never admit it, he was a homebody at heart.
“I have an idea that might help,” she murmured, and Theo swallowed at the husky quality her voice had taken on.
Harry laughed again, fumbling to untie his apron. He lifted it over his head, tossing is onto a chair before pushing past Draco and running for the stairs. He was too old to be fucked on a kitchen table, he thought as he tore toward the bedroom.
"Harry correctly assumed that part of Draco's hesitancy was the press he was likely to garner if he was dating the Chosen One," Neville said, sticking his tongue out in response when the dark-haired wizard quirked an eyebrow at him. "And yes, I know the implications of the law, Harry. I just hadn't gotten there yet."
Harry squeezed Draco's arm reassuringly before pushing the door open. He didn't flinch when a huge three-headed dog began to bark.
"Morning," Neville said with a forced cheerfulness that made Draco grimace, sliding into the chair next to Draco with his own cup of tea.
Draco groaned loudly, falling backward into his bed fully dressed. He was absolutely exhausted. His business trip had gone fairly quickly, just as he had hoped. Blaise and Theo had dragged him to several wizarding clubs around England similar to the one Theo wanted to develop to help give Draco an idea of what they were trying to do. The trip had gone quickly – they'd only been gone one night – mainly because Theo was anxious to get back to Ginny. She hadn't been too pleased about him leaving her so late in her pregnancy, and from what Draco understood, it was going to take a lot of wheedling and chocolate to get back into her good graces.
The tiny Dumbledore figure waved his fist in Ron's direction, eliciting giggles from Teddy. He laughed harder when the small Hermione Granger shoved the Ron Weasley figurine, catching it off balance and sending it sprawling to the bottom of the box.
The darker wizard nodded, prodding Theo with his elbow. They managed to hit Potter with another Sobriety spell, and several men Draco vaguely recognized came to help lead the still-disoriented dark-haired wizard and the giggling bridegroom out of the club.
Harry nodded, staring at his feet. The fact that Draco had this whole other life he knew nothing about was really starting to hit home, and it was worrying him. Draco had agreed to the courtship, but had he really intended to progress to the next step? Harry chewed on his bottom lip, his mind focusing on the little boy he'd met earlier. Draco's son.
"You've got thirty seconds before I sink my cock into that naked arse of yours," Draco growled, his eyes flashing.
"Cal," he said, earning Caleum's eternal gratitude for extending a hand for a manly shake instead of giving him a kiss as well. After all, he had his reputation to think of.
"Madam Atalier's son had an appointment with you yesterday, Mr. Malfoy," Blaise said, his lips curved into a smirk only Draco could see, since he remained in the doorway. "Your cancellation was quite inconvenient for him, and Madam was kind enough to come in his place today to settle the matter herself."
Draco was still lost in thought when Blaise returned, and the wizard took the opportunity to study his friend. He was a bit thinner than he'd been a month ago and it was clear from the smudges under his eyes that he wasn't sleeping well, either.

Draco stretched as much as he was able without waking the boy, trying to wake up enough to shift Cal over to the mattress. He really needed to set some sort of alarm ward that would notify him when Cal was out of bed, he thought, easing himself up into a sitting position once the sleeping boy was safely nestled next to him.
