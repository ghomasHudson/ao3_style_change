“How many times do I have to tell you — Call me Eddie!” said DuPont loudly.
Pansy held onto the hug, and he thought she might be crying, but she held her composure.
“Let’s see then,” said Harry, snagging it out of Hermione’s hands and cracking it open. “‘A parking metre is a device which looks after motor vehicles to keep them from being stolen’… what?”
,” and the wand reacted instantly, as if it knew what Harry was about to command it to do.
Dumbledore hummed in acknowledgement.
Hermione gasped and her hands flew to her face. “Harry, it can’t be… that’s…”
and the memory went haywire. A voice told Riddle off for asking, but when the smoke cleared, no one in the memory looked like they had seen it. Draco, pale at Harry’s side, certainly had.
“I have to go,” he said, looking up at Harry.
The mental image of Draco dusting off the oldest bottle of wine he had ever seen and cracking up into hysterics when it tasted like absolute shit made Harry smile stupidly to himself in the darkness. That was what he loved about Draco – he was the perfect mix of composure, wit, and fearlessness.
Lucius sighed. “It was Narcissa,” he said. Draco sat bolt upright in his chair. “She had a vision.”
As Yaxley took a few lumbering steps towards the door, Harry surveyed the room. This was the same room he’d seen over the summer. There had been a figure just there on the tile floor, in a pool of blood. And to the left was a mirror, where he saw – he didn’t dare look.
At the end of the room was a high-backed chair, carved to look like the wood had scales and silhouetted all around by one enormous fireplace that was alive with a pale blue flame. In the chair sat the slender form of Voldemort, a snake twined around his legs and its enormous head laid on his lap, eyes fixed on Harry.
“Tell me his name.”
The man narrowed his eyes at Draco and took a few more steps – a little farther and he’d be right on top of Harry.
As he turned out of the Great Hall, he heard someone calling his name and a bushy-haired witch was running in his direction.
The short section ended abruptly, but the next page showed a white-haired Dr Weaver, standing alongside an adult man in more modern Muggle attire with the caption,
Holding the blade upright and reading the name Godric Gryffindor in the hilt, Harry knew what he had to do. How Al had planned for it to fall into his hands he would never understand, but gripping the sword tighter, he was struck with the mad thought that this could work after all.
“Of course,” said Hermione. “Thank you, Professor.”
“Well, because—” Draco started.
“I told him, of course, that I’d already revealed everything I’d seen in the cards. But he seemed a bit distressed. He was asking whether if he gave me names I could tell him which one was involved.”
“Right, you must know exactly what it’s like,” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Look, if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather skip the part where we bond and go straight back to practising.”
“Why don’t I say I’m studying advanced Tasseography with Trelawney? That’ll get anyone off my back,” said Draco, knowing McGonagall would secretly appreciate the jab. He knew all the teachers at Hogwarts well enough to know their tells.
“A Muggle-born whose only claim to fame is his dead parents.”
“It’s not taught here,” said Draco, unbuckling a few of the bulkier pieces of his Quidditch uniform. “My father had me tutored privately. As Granger so graciously pointed out the other day – my family has a long history of doing whatever it takes to protect ourselves.”
Realising that he might miss his opportunity to get involved in this little plot, Draco was quick to make his entrance with a polite knock. Whatever secret it was that Dumbledore was getting them to hide, he wanted to be the one to reveal it to the Dark Lord.
Harry smiled to himself in the darkness. It had been soothing to relive the memory of Ivy’s rescue with his best friend. Maybe Malfoy would warm up to her in the same way.
“Oh?” said the Dark Lord, resting one arm on his chair and perching his chin upon it. He was trying to play as though he was too superior to rise in Harry’s presence, but Harry got the sense that he was fatigued, his movements were so laboured. “And why would you say that?”
“Back on schedule then?”
Fear and anger tore through Harry as his magic released, sending a burst of energy through his small room and severing the connection. As his consciousness slipped away, he could see the worried face of McGonagall hovering over him and whispering a healing spell.
“Can’t, I have Quidditch,” said Draco, shifting his arm away to pack up.
“Not to mention Dumbledore could have been off his rocker,” said Cedric. “Or suffering from a curse or poison that was affecting his judgement. We have no way of knowing if anything in this trunk is even sound evidence.”
Greenacre ceased his ruffling through papers and nodded mutely.
Draco squared his shoulders and Tonks winked and turned to enter the pub.
“I know,” said Harry, and Pansy pulled back with a smile spreading across her beautiful lips.
“I told her she doesn’t have to,” said Harry, heading to the corner where they always held their Legilimency sessions.
having cleared to just a mist. Charlotte was collapsed on the ground, her eyes open and unblinking in a look of terror. A creature in tattered black robes hovered above her, reaching out with gnarled, bony hands like those of a corpse.
A tingling sensation prickled at Harry’s fingers as a familiar feeling of anger welled up inside him. First his parents, then Al. He wouldn’t lose Draco too.
“So it’s true,” said Yaxley, turning to his friend. “It’s better than we could have hoped. We’ll be made kings for this.”
Harry laughed. “Sorry about that. Sometimes the crowds can be too much. I haven’t been great with them since the war.”
Lucius took a step back in surprise as Narcissa dissolved into sobs, her thin shoulders jumping, her face buried in her hands.
“What’s a Nargle?” asked Harry.
“Isn’t he always out of sorts?” said Theo, but none of them laughed. No one was much in the mood for bashing Longbottom, when it felt more like kicking a fallen horse.
But Granger, usually quick to correct their professors, seemed to take no notice. She was bent over a piece of parchment, listing out a curriculum of spellwork spanning Charms, Transfiguration, and Defence. And she wasn’t alone in working on other things. Most other students were dozing, doodling on scraps of parchment, or frantically finishing their essays ahead of the afternoon’s double Potions.
All eyes turned to Draco who had been sitting quietly in his armchair, regarding the group with an even stare.
“He could have been Albanian,” said Luna, who was lying flat on the rug in a fluffy pink bathrobe, holding an old issue of the
Lucius stiffened and cut into his quail with a slow precision. “Indeed, it was an auspicious time for our family. Something not easily forgotten.”
Greenacre started in surprise at the change in Draco’s tone. “Apologies, Mr Malfoy,” said Greenacre, sitting back up in his chair, “But the terms of secrecy around the Collective’s affairs are quite strict. Only in the event of death—”
Once Hermione left, Draco glided back over to his place on the sofa. “Merlin, she’s insufferable.”
Somewhere in Britain…
Harry’s hand closed around the cold metal and a sense of foreboding chilled him, remembering the way the locket had hung heavy around his neck in the diadem vision, but he pushed it to the back of his mind. “Draco said to contact someone called Nymphadora Tonks. He says she can help us reach the Order.”
“I thought the whole point of all this was that only I could access the memory,” said Harry, apprehensively. “I don’t think either of us want to relive that first time over again.”
“Did you stop to consider the implications of the world finding out that Potter survived?” asked Snape.
“Come look at the mimbletonia with me while we wait. It looks like it might need repotting again soon,” Luna said, flitting over to the window seat where the plant in question was starting to drop tentacle-like roots over the edge of the pot.
“Harry, just wait a moment,” said Hermione, trying to placate as Harry looked frantically through the contents of the spilled trunk, broken shards of memory phials tinkling lightly. “We need to think. What do you mean Voldemort is trying to steal your regeneration?”
“What kind of stories?” asked Draco, shifting to a sitting position against the trunk as the two of them unpacked the odd collection of books and ephemera which had seemingly not been organised in any logical way.
The stone piece cracked and gave way, crumbling to the board in a pile of rubble. And in the end, the gold ring lay gleaming on top of the heap, like the ring of power severed from Sauron’s hand by Isildur.
Draco pulled back to look at Harry and froze. The strange static in Harry’s brain was getting louder. He blinked.
“Let’s go then,” she said.
They had spent the last few days plotting a back-to-back heist as the first phase of a plan that would bring about the destruction of the Dark Lord, Draco’s approach to which seemed to be at least partially inspired by the plot of Muggle films.
“Harry?” said an airy voice from the couch.
. “It says it’s possible to access memories you don’t even know you have.”
“Oh, er, you know Muggles. Always looking for something to celebrate,” said Harry as Luna scooped Ivy off of the collar of his jumper and deposited her into a pocket of her dress.
He took a few slow strides down the rows, making note that Madam Pince was at her desk at the other end of the room, and turned into the Restricted Section. A few books rustled on their shelf as he passed by. He scanned the titles, but there was nothing until…
Harry pulled up a few chairs and Angelica struck up a conversation with Gemma despite her inability to utter anything longer than a few syllables. Harry tried to catch Draco’s eye, but he pretended to be engrossed in Angelica’s blathering, which involved a light card reading that predicted Blaise would wind up singing on a stage and Gemma would leave the party with someone famous.
“Alright, I’ll make a deal with you, since those are the only terms you seem to understand these days,” said Pansy, her eyes darting back to Draco with a conspiratorial glint.
, and they popped open with satisfying clicks. He silently thanked Hermione for all her boring, if not practical, lessons.
By the time they got through with telling her everything they had been up to over the past few weeks, McGonagall was looking very much like the younger version of herself that had marched James and his friends into this very office.
“Yes, red sparks,” said Cedric, turning back to Harry. “It’s the universal magical signal for help, or to alert of danger.”
“What? No, that’s—”
How easily Draco could have found himself in Snape’s place. He felt his resolve harden.
“Don’t be too hard on yourself. There was no way you could have known.”
“No, you’re right, I quite agree,” said Draco, casting a quick
With that, the bard strummed a few solemn notes, and the hallway fell silent.
“No need to be jealous, Granger,” said Malfoy, crossing around behind Harry.
“If you think I’m going to sanction a trip to London, you’ve got another thing coming,” said Hermione, frowning as her diagnostic spell went up in a puff of smoke. “Though it would be good to try and get some answers. What about Dumbledore’s memories?”
Harry could feel his blood run cold as he looked out through the slit-eyed pupils into the now familiar sitting room. His shadow self seemed to recognise his arrival, but did not call for assistance as he did last time. Instead, his hand paused as he stroked a giant snake draped over his lap and he shifted his gaze to look into the cool flames of an enchanted fire.
She cracked a reluctant smile. “Let’s not count him out completely,” she said, putting a hand on Draco’s arm. “I’m so glad it’s all worked out with Angelica, and I’m sure everything is about to change for the better. But let’s just keep an eye out for him, alright? Merlin knows he’d do the same for you.”
,” she practically spat the last word.
“Alright,” said Harry, bracing himself on the couch and locking onto Draco’s eyes with a determined stare. “I’ve got it.”
“You control them,” said Draco, with a huff of astonished laughter.
“Don’t thank me yet,” said Hermione, also pointing her wand at him. “Any funny business and you won’t get another chance.”
Draco laughed. “You’re absolutely right, Professor. It’s just hard for me to believe you when you never practice what you preach.”
“Yes, there are many… varied accounts of Dumbledore, so there’s lots you can learn about him if you like,” said Hermione, successfully restraining herself from disparaging the
“It’s so beautiful. I can’t believe they were going to hurt it,” said Charlotte, reaching down a finger to stroke her tiny head.
“Appraising,” said Draco, pulling out the bundle of black fabric that held the ring.
“Can’t say I risk living a normal life anytime soon,” said Harry, closing the book. “Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“It’s truth serum,” said Draco, looking through the rest of Luna’s ingredients box and adding a sprig of peppermint to the mug. “And a lot, from the looks of things. If he came here in this state to tell us the Ministry’s coming, I’d be surprised if it wasn’t them that gave it to him. They’ll be in the castle soon. If we take him to Pomfrey, they’ll realise he’s come to warn us.”
Draco nodded in reverence. “And I presume you did your duty otherwise our Lord would not be with us now.”
Draco felt his heart beat uncharacteristically fast at the sight of him, and he searched for something intelligent to say. Maybe he should have taken the hit of fool’s luck after all.
“That will do,” said Voldemort at last. Draco fell to his knees on the cold tile floor and the Dark Lord glided over, bending slightly to speak into his ear. “You have done enough to survive, but your value has dried up in my eyes. What I need from you is very specific: find me the boy and bring him here. If you are incapable of this, remember you are expendable.”
“Meaning that until yesterday, Harry didn’t know he was magical at all.”
“So what’s the problem?”
Hermione kept Harry’s curriculum on track by sheer force of will. Cedric turned up for stretches at a time when he could get a break from casework. And Luna came by whenever it suited, to read aloud articles from the
BANG BANG!
“Harry in the other world told me that story once when I asked him how he learned to speak Parseltongue,” said Luna matter-of-factly.
Off the bat, Harry spotted Riddle present among a group of students having dinner with a portly, moustached man. Draco recognised the location as the old Potions classroom and the adult at the table as Professor Slughorn, a teacher who was known for picking favourites.
Perhaps it was somewhere along the lines of what Draco had been imagining lately as well: his hands slipping up the back of Harry’s flimsy cotton shirt, running them through messy black hair and dragging him closer, Harry’s lips inches from his own. Draco stopped mid stride so quickly that a wall sconce fluttered in his wake.
A still more pressing fear was that Draco could no longer see himself rejoicing over a summons to Wisteria Hall. In fact, he was petrified by it. Judging by the looks on his friends’ faces, they were as well. Pansy moved a hand to the crook of his elbow and squeezed.
The second was a rather chilling confrontation Potter had with a horse-faced woman in the hall of his home. Draco had seen the beatings Potter sustained at the hands of the other two Dursleys, but this woman, dressed in a ridiculous set of hair curlers, was vile. Draco was repelled by her callous words, but Potter felt next to nothing in emotional response. It occurred to him for the first time that his relationship with his own mother was an advantage that not all were exposed to.
In fact, Harry had spent a great deal of the past few weeks trying
“Did you know that pickled murtlap tentacles can make you resistant to jinxes?” mused Luna, laying on her back with her legs propped up on the windowsill wearing woolly leggings and an oversized jumper, her hair laid out in a long ponytail bound by a turquoise scrunchie.
“Are we sure it’s not an option to just let him return?” Cedric asked. Draco rolled his eyes. “We’d keep him under surveillance, obviously, but he’d be out of the castle. I’m worried he might pose a risk to the other students if he’s kept here.”
Whether it was the drone of wind in his ears or the morose news that had shrouded the morning, the crowd was quieter than he had ever known them to be. The announcer, some Ravenclaw boy, was clipped, speaking factually to the action on the field, and even the teams had given up their usual trash talking. And despite an early Slytherin lead, Hufflepuff were fighting their way back to even the score.
“… He was so secretive at first when he was in hospital, but she got special access to cover the story as an exclusive.” Gemma’s incessant talking hit his eardrums again, and he put a hand to his forehead in exasperation. “She said he was just the sweetest, like a little puppy. And I mean, I knew who he was, of course, but I never thought he was particularly fit. But then when she introduced me to him at the gala and I saw those green eyes—”
Harry wheeled around brandishing the flaming sword, coming face to face with a man with an outstretched wand who was the spitting image of Draco. He hesitated for a moment as the Dark Lord laughed viciously, but Lucius did not move his wand. Instead he reached into the pocket of his robes and withdrew a tattered leather bound book, throwing it at Harry’s feet.
“A wise lesson. But, every good friend was once a stranger,” said the voice. Draco pushed on the memory, trying to bring the voice into focus, or nudge Harry into the light to see the face of the speaker. But the park was growing hazy, like a mirror fogged up with steam.
“You want Merlin’s honest truth?” said DuPont, leaning in close to Draco’s ear, his nest of clear hairs whipping around in the breeze at close range. “I don’t give a damn about Muggles. Couldn’t care one way or the other.”
“All the more reason to celebrate!” said Blaise, grabbing the champagne bottle from the table and topping up everyone’s glass again.
Draco’s eyes flickered to Harry’s and then quickly into the fire as he took a deep drink of Butterbeer. Harry noticed his hand was shaking. “In what way?”
It didn’t take long for Luna to get Hermione up to speed on the properties of the diadem, and for Hermione to make the call that they give Harry a little while longer before escalating to someone else in the castle.
“It’s okay, Draco,” said Pansy, in a soothing tone. “I’ve had my suspicions for a long time now. I see the way you look at other guys. The fact that you only want to snog but you want everyone else to believe we’re doing something else.”
“If I can help,” said Luna with a shrug. “For one thing, we should get to work on your potions brewing. We’re definitely going to need some Nargle repellent up here.”
If anything, the increasingly vivid nature of these dreams was proof to him that whatever danger lay out there, it was getting stronger. Could it possibly be aware of his presence? Or was he fabricating these visions to fill in the gaps from McGonagall’s story?
“Stop!” yelled Draco, flying at Harry and grabbing him by the shoulders. “Don’t you get it? I will not survive this!”
“Daddy, we just heard from Draco’s friend Harry, who’s free to come play with us today,” said Angelica brightly.
Where would the diadem version of himself be right now? Maybe running escapees out of London, or planning for another attack on a Death Eater base. Wherever he was he was in a hell of a better position than Draco was feeling currently.
Though the room was dim, Draco could make out the faces of a few recognisable individuals in the upper echelon of society, including the heiress of the Bertie Botts Every Flavour Bean fortune, and a table full of professional quidditch players who looked to be a mixture of Falmouth Falcons and the Dutch national team.
“That reminds me.” Malfoy reached into his robes pocket and pulled out a folded copy of the day’s
“If two of the confirmed Horcruxes are objects that belonged to Hogwarts founders, I bet the cup is one as well,” said Hermione, sliding the old catalogue of artefacts towards her and rifling through it. “Are there any other founder’s items on there, Luna?”
Draco smiled. He would be in complete control, of course, but now he had Harry believing he’d been given some agency in all of this. Something he was clearly craving, having been locked up in a room for two weeks.
“I can’t help it,” said Harry, watching in wonder as the translucent figure of a woman glided by. “I’ve been dreaming about a place like this my whole life. You guys must have some idea how incredible it is that what’s mundane to you the rest of the world can’t even imagine.”
“Tell me,” said Draco, turning to face the Potions Master. “What did the Dark Lord set out to do the night that the Potters died? Was he merely trying to destroy a family of blood traitors, or was he coming to collect them?”
The trip had been a successful one, treating Pansy to a new duelling periodical and stopping by Zonko’s where the Weasley twins were apprenticing, and surreptitiously picking up a few more Extendable Ears. But throughout the next few days, he simply couldn’t get Harry out of his head.
Memories. There had to be hundreds of them. Draco had the realisation that the answer to some of the deepest mysteries in the wizarding world may very well be in the trunk in front of them.
“I wish we could have given it a go, Potter, really I do,” said Draco. “In another life maybe.”
“No!” cried Snape, falling desperately to his knees. His legs were still petrified, but his hands scrabbled furiously at the shards. “What have you done?”
“Thought I better come save you. Or her! Looked like you were about to set her on fire,” she said with a smile. “Can’t say she didn’t deserve it though, that woman is punishing.”
The paper said nothing of Potter, but Draco knew the Death Eaters had been there on his tip. With no word from his mother, he could only hope that they had played their roles as instructed and avoided killing him.
He inspected his left arm — it did not bear the Mark. Looking down, he spotted trainers poking out from below. What in fresh hell? He had to check his reflection in the kettle just to make sure he was even himself.
casting had much improved since the previous Friday, and the wands themselves had a certain hum to them that felt altogether different.
Reflecting on his feelings for a moment, he recalled the initial shame he felt when Draco started first seeing his memories of the Dursleys. It had been a part of his past he wished he could rewrite. But now, knowing who his parents were and, more importantly, the power he had to create his own family, he felt that his childhood no longer defined him.
Suddenly a jet of red light flew out of the wall of mist and hit Draco on the arm, causing him to leap off the stool.
“And you really should keep up the Occlumency practice,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore made it explicitly clear. If Voldemort can traverse the connection, he’ll find out where you are. Everyone in the castle will be in danger.”
“Zabini was needed for a menial task, well below your station,” said Lucius, waving this notion away with a pale hand. “There is a group of prisoners who are undergoing various stages of interrogation. I had thought someone in your age bracket may be of some use with one in particular.”
Sometimes he wondered if this was what his schooling might have been like, had he not been in mortal danger every year. It was part of why he was so dedicated to his job--so no children had to take it upon themselves to save each other.
“Keep talking,” she said, unflinching.
She elbowed him in the ribs. “Assets, remember?”
Harry craned his neck to make out a title in cracked gold lettering:
“Is this a warning?” asked Draco, his voice coming out barely more than a whisper. “Are you telling me… to defy him?”
“It certainly sounds like he knew what needed to be done, but he hasn’t left us very much to go on,” said Hermione, skimming the letter again as she nibbled on a piece of toast. “Seven pieces of a soul? That sounds like seriously dark magic. I can’t imagine there’d be anything in the school library about it.”
Suddenly there was a blinding wave of pain crashing through Harry like his scar was bursting open. He cried out and fell to his knees, clutching his forehead. He hadn’t felt a pain like this in weeks, and this was worse than he remembered. Like electricity was crackling through his brain, setting every nerve ending on fire.
“It remains unclear,” said McGonagall.
“I already tried that,” snapped Hermione. “It’s unnaturally messy. I think we’ll just have to change the rest of him, maybe lighten the eyebrows.”
“No, of course,” said Draco as he re-read the note the owl had just dropped off. “It makes perfect sense.”
Draco knew he ought to tell the others about the diary, but convinced himself that it was pointless to do until they had a way to destroy the damn thing. Hermione’s book gave little insight into how to do just that, and the experiments they were able to set off in the house resulted in little more than a singed rug for their troubles.
“You are such an idiot sometimes,” he said, letting go of Draco roughly, who stumbled back against the building. “I never should have mentioned that to you. And what the hell do you think you’re doing bringing it up in such a public place?”
Sitting with his knees pulled up to his chest, surrounded by the prickly branches of the hedge, he was partially concealed, pressed as far away from the light as he could go. He peered out frantically from between the slats in the bench, but couldn’t see anyone.
“Your father’s family were not just any wizarding family,” said Draco, watching Harry’s head bob around as he struggled to his feet. “These are extremely rare, it would have been passed down for generations, I’d wager.”
Draco’s lips quirked into a grin as he thought about the past few days he’d spent with Harry.
But no, he had a responsibility back home in Surrey. He and his best friend were going to make something of their lives, and it would not be magic tricks that got him that. It was going to be actual skills, a real future. And getting as far away from Privet Drive as soon as possible. To that end, Ivy wasn’t wrong – the Dursleys were the last thing he wanted to go home to.
“Moreover, I can’t recall her ever having a gift with the Sight before the incident this year,” said Voldemort, shifting his gaze from Lucius to Draco. “Can you Yaxley?”
Luna hummed, gazing at the Mimbulus mimbletonia.
“Water under the bridge,” he said, accepting it.
“How did you learn healing magic?” asked Harry. “Only I haven’t seen it in the curriculum from Hermione.”
“You mean with Horcruxes?” said Harry.
“Well, there’s got to be a figurehead, sure, someone who is esteemed and admired so the rest can be inspired to follow. Then the counsel helps to uphold the law, for there to be peace.”
“Nothing pleases him, Dolores. Haven’t you learned that by now?” said McGonagall, raising her head weakly to glare at the toad of a woman. “When he’s done with you, he will destroy you, like all the res—”
Draco turned away. Why was Snape telling him this? He needed reassurance, support from a fellow member of the brethren. Not a seed of doubt.
Draco took the long way to Knockturn Alley, careful not to cross in front of any shops where proprietors might recognise him and force him to explain why he was out of school. If it got back to his parents that he was in London, he wouldn’t be able to provide a very good reason. Worse still, if he had to answer to the Dark Lord.
“They wouldn’t be able to do much Ron. If what Dumbledore told Harry was true about people wasting away, that makes it sound like it’s addictive.”
There Malfoy was just coming up from the dungeons and making a beeline for the 7
“Mmm, rather not.”
All of this just swirled around in his tired mind like a tornado of annoyance, leaving him feeling raw and irritable. He was currently sat inform of the common room fire, staring into the strong flames hoping they would ‘illuminate’ his troubles. Though with the last of the summer heat clinging it the air, the fire did little more than make brow sweat.
“Miss Party. You lot are 8
Finally sitting down, Harry bent over to whisper to Hermione, “He isn’t here again.” Harry pointed to the Slytherin table. Malfoy couldn’t be found. Hermione’s nodded in understanding then went back to the conversation that Ginny was having with a few of her friends, the names of the newest, and best looking, professional quidditch player being tossed about.
(See the end of the chapter for
Glaring, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, nostrils flaring. Harry watched as Malfoys quicksilver eyes bounced around taking in every detail of Harry’s face. Harry wonders what exactly Malfoy is seeing if it's as ugly looking as it feels late at night. Whatever it is though, Malfoy seems to shake it off, unimpressed, “I have better things to do.”
Even with the annoyance of Malfoy in his dreams, a fact he hoped to never have to admit out loud, Harry wished he was still in bed, instead, he was digging around the banks of the lake. “Any luck Harry?” Neville Longbottom asked, himself nearly up to his hips in the shallow wake, a streak of mud spread across his cheek.
Suddenly noticing just how close they were, Malfoy jumps back, pulling his hands to his chest as if he was burned, “Give it here Potter.” He kept demanding.
“Not a clue. When I got close, he chased me off, nearly set my hair on fire. Afterward, I found this.” Harry fished the pendant out of his pocket, handing it to Hermione. The little petals inside were closed tightly, just on the cusp of blooming. They twinkled slightly, covered in microscopic dew drops just like the morning grass of the school grounds. She held it delicately, running her fingers along the chain and inscribed initials. Her lips were pulled tight, almost a flat line, in worry.
“Wait, do we need to worry about the cabinet?” Ron asked anxiously.
“Well go to the infirmary and get the hell out of my sight until you’re ready to do the work properly.”
Looking back at the Map Harry notices Malfoy’s moved, not far but he seems to be moving around in the room. His little footstep path laps back and forth along over and over. He tracks about and forth nearly ten times before ultimately seeming to give up and leave the Room of Requirements. His little name tag floating through the map towards the Slytherin dungeons. Is he passing? Looking for something? Harry digs in his pocket and pulls out the necklace. He probably is looking for it. He didn’t know what it was or if it did anything, but it was evidently important to Malfoy and that was reason enough for Harry to keep a close eye on it.
“Why do you even care Potter?”
“No.” Malfoy refused his offered hand, refused to even look at him, eyes still affixed to the mirror.
Skin tingling, His sheets were drenched in sweat, plastering his bangs to his forehead and the front of his shirt to his chest. The night was oppressively hot with the magic holding in the heat of the long, dead fireplace. His dorm mates were all fast asleep, curtains drawn closed tight, locking out the rest of the world and providing just a modicum of privacy that a boarding school had to give.
Slowly, as if deliberately, the creature lowered its gaze, turning back and reentering the forest, disappearing amongst the dense thicket. Just like that, it was gone again, and with it so went the light. Harry shook his head. Surely, it’s just Hagrid messing around with some truly dangerous creature that he will inevitably thrust upon one of his magical creatures’ class.
“Do you?” Davies raised a blocky eyebrow, the wrinkles on his head shifting and becoming deeper.  “Hold to your convictions, kid. You want to have opinions than be ready to debate them, that’s what a man would do.” He strode back to the front of the room, leaving a flushed Ron at the center of everyone’s attention.
“You said you saw your family in the mirror?” Hermione pressed him, clearly already formulating an idea. Harry nodded, she turned to Ron, “and you saw yourself outperforming your brothers and being in the spotlight.” Ron’s lips pressed thin, not enjoying having his insecurities put on such display, but nodded none the less. “So, this mirror is obviously showing you your deepest desires. I mean with a name like Erised it’s a bit on the nose,” Hermione concluded. Ron and Harry looked at each other surprised and confused. How did she manage to figure things out so quickly? Hermione took one look at their confused faces and gave a put-upon sigh, “Oh, come on now, you two are telling me you never noticed that Erised is just Desire spelled backward?”
Every time he closed his eyes, he sees Sirius. Every nightmare started the same, Harry was in the woods, a sunny cheery meadow with happy birds and cutesy little bunnies. Walking the path Harry would just enjoy the sounds of nature his black dog body running about barking at squirrels and rustling in bushes. They would wrestle together and race one another through the trees. Then, Sirius would disappear, jump over some overgrowth, and be gone. Harry would try and follow but as he ran the forest would grow dark and cold, clouds overhead like a hail storm were just waiting to fall. Then he would burst through the thicket and he would find Sirius. Lying beside a murky lake, as a human, dead. Skin as devoid of life as a dried white rose.
Draco chanced a look in Gemma’s direction and saw that she and the Magenta witch had been joined by a few others at the next table, all talking simultaneously at each other and gesturing with floppy hands around the room.
“I was actually thinking,” said Draco, coming to take his usual place on the couch and levitating a few books away. “That we might switch gears. Maybe start looking at some older memories from today in order to access the one about your parents.”
“Yeah actually,” said Harry apprehensively, not looking up from where his fingers skimmed across the chapter. “The first time we tried this, when it was like watching my life in rewind, I think I saw a memory… of the night my parents died. Do you think we could find it again?”
Draco tried to respond, but the now familiar pain of the Fidelius was blocking him. Why? He hadn’t even said anything yet.
“Why not?” She giggled. “He’s adorable. It’s fine by me, really. Whatever keeps you happy will keep me happy. As long as you keep it well under wraps. But I’m sure that was the plan, anyway.”
Then, just as the crowd was reaching a fever pitch, he saw it — the Golden Snitch. The Ravenclaw Seeker hadn’t spotted it yet, but as soon as he went into a dive, she was on his tail. He plummeted towards the ground, gaining inches on the Snitch as it darted in front of him, but when it took a turn, pulling the two Seekers out of their dive, he thought he had lost it for good.
“You better watch out for this one,” said DuPont to Draco, shaking a playful finger at his daughter. “Six summers in a row, we got her golfing lessons until she outgrew the coach. When she was little, we even thought about going pro.”
“This is madness,” said Draco
Draco felt a light weight on his knee as Ivy dropped from the edge of the bed and slithered towards one resting hand. He could feel Harry smiling as the little snake curled up in his palm and settled there. Whatever he’d done to earn it’s favour, he didn’t deserve it.
“Even if you had the opportunity to make all the same decisions.
“I’m quite astonished,” said Draco, collecting his thoughts and wondering about the scope of the charm and whether he’d be able to relay this valuable information to certain interested parties. “It seems a hard thing to keep a secret for this long. Surely every teacher, every friend, every shop owner, would have heard the name before. Would have recognised him. Where has he trained?”
He rummaged in his school bag for a sack of items he’d taken off one of the insufferable Weasleys, certain he’d caught them using some makeshift listening device. Discovering a fleshy ear on a string, he held one end to his own ear, which adhered like a suction cup, and slid the other end through a crack under the door.
Harry raced to the desk to grab the potions ingredients that Luna had left behind, thrusting them into Hermione’s hands as Draco cast a
Pansy folded the newspaper and looked up stoically at the others. “That’ll be why Neville is out of sorts lately.”
“So it’s not just a rumour then,” said the Irish boy. “How did you do it? How did you survive?”
But Luna did not seem to hear him.
“Not really,” said Harry, his eyes darting around the rest of the room as he realised all remaining conversation had ceased.
Maybe the soul fragment was something he’d have to play for. Al’s note said he’d have to challenge him for it. He turned the board around, playing white. It was worth a shot, anyway.
He had refused to admit the possibility to himself for so long that he had actually believed she was still out there, waiting to be saved. But Cedric was right. There was little reason to believe she had made it off the train platform after the Dementor attack and even less reason for the followers of Voldemort to keep her alive.
“Cheers gang,” boomed Blaise over the music, holding up a full, foaming glass of champagne. “To old friends.”
Draco watched along, half-interestedly thinking that there would not be much to see other than the familiar faces of the Death Eaters, and instead spending the time rehearsing his pseudo surprised response once for once he left the memory.
“I’ll take your word for it.” Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to the door with one more demand to make of McGonagall. This time, however, he noticed muffled voices from within. He couldn’t miss the chance to eavesdrop on news of Dumbledore, but his normal charm proved ineffective.
Harry didn’t think there was anything Hermione could say that would give him hope he’d be seeing out the day alive, but somehow this did.
The pretty redhead had flung herself into Potter’s arms the first chance she got. Potter for his part seemed genuinely surprised by the gesture, and Draco could almost feel present day Potter squirming as Draco watched the memory, even trying to Occlude weakly. But Draco forced the scene to play out, feeling an inexplicable level of loathing towards the girl, and utterly exasperated with Potter’s naïveté.
“I am just trying to figure out how you managed to stay on your broom, you washed up seeker.” Harry threw back, his words lacking their normal fire.
Like a quaffle barreling into his chest, an angry fire exploded forth. Reeling back, Harry punched Malfoy, square in the jaw.
Suddenly an ear-piercing screech came from the water, making Harry’s ears ring, as Neville was pulled to the ground. He screamed and clawed at the wet rocks, but their slick surface slipped through his fingers as he was pulled under. A flash of a silvery tail made waves as a mermaid pull Neville down deeper into the lake. Luna screamed his name as Harry instantly dived back into the frigid waters. The scratching of merpeople echoed around him as Harry swam in the direction, he last saw Neville pulled towards.
“He had said something along the lines of the mirror shows you your deepest desires, that the happiest man in the world could look in and only see himself and that men have wasted away before it.”
“Doesn’t mean it isn’t fear-driven.” Ron retorted it was a strategy they had all grown accustom to and could see through easier than some.
“And?”
Ron perked up at that, a skeptical glare coming into his eye, “What was he doing?”
“Right, What’s wrong?”
“Harry-“ignoring her response, Harry headed for the Great Hall’s massive double doors. Once in the quiet hall, Harry debated whether to head for the dungeons of the castle or instead towards the Room of Requirements. If only he had his map to be certain. Going with his gut, Harry turned towards the stairs with the most direct route to the 7
Pacing for a moment, torn which way to go. His curiosity was screaming for him to keep tracking, find out what was happening.
His rear starts to ache and grows cold from the stone slabs of the sill. The first tinges of blue creep into the sky as the sun rises, turning clouds cotton candy pink. Nothing has happened. Malfoy’s name tag hasn’t moved an inch all night. If Harry didn’t know better, he would almost think this was a muggle map with how still the images were being.
Filch’s nose twitched in anger, “Get back to your dorm.” Filch spat before storming off down the hall, grumbling a slew of curse words under his breath. Harry watched his disappeared into the darkness of the long hallway, before continuing on his way back to his room.
Heading down the dimly lit hallway, He could just make out the edges of the ridiculously huge tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls ballet. The image of four large, lead-footed trolls attempting to do a Dance des Petits Cygnes from Swan Lake was guaranteed to capture the humorous attention of any passerby, making it even more certain that they will miss the magic room opposite them.
A flash of gold catches his attention, ignoring the forest, Harry dives for the snitch revealing in the exciting thrill of a free fall nosedive. Letting the rush of wind wipe away all the thoughts on his mind.
“No, sir.”
“I still just want to know what he is doing…” Harry admitted, sitting down himself. He turned his head, trying to grab another look at Malfoy without being noticed. He wasn’t in the same clothes he had on last night, having gone to his room just long enough to change. His skin had a ghostly pallor to it, even in the dungeons he looked like the spookiest thing around. He was set at a table all by himself. One of only 3 other 8
Just as Malfoy stepped through the doorway, the entire staircase gave a rumble, a warning as it was about to move. Making as quick and silent work as possible Harry climbs the stairs to the 7
Somewhere, small, in the back of Harry’s mind tells him that he wants that look protected. It's too good for this world and it needs someone to keep it safe.
Early year Students, worried about being late or getting lost, scurried the hallways as Harry walked back from his dorm, quidditch robes on and broom in hand. All of them giving Harry a wide birth as they looked up at him like he was their personal savior. He even saw as one young man almost fell off a set of shifting stairs, his attention fully on ogling Harry. Luckily, he had friends close by to snatch him from the edge, though he didn’t seem as scared as they were instead still just staring at Harry until he managed to round the corner.
“Found it,” Harry said vaguely, throwing his arm high above his head to put distance between Malfoy and the charm. Malfoy tried to reach for it, bringing him unbearable close to Harry. An earthy slightly powdery scent wafted from Malfoy, it was a surprisingly simple smell for a man that seemed constantly surrounded but opulence. It was oddly comforting for a man whose life seemed to revolve around pomp.
“You’re lucky they didn’t kill you.”  He retorted, looking annoyed about that fact.  “… Lucky in a lot of ways.”
“You’re a bloody Git, Potter.” The other man spat at him, stalking behind.
“Want to join us on the front lawn Harry?” Ron asked, looking excited to escape into the fresh air for their free period. He always had taken to their camping better than Harry or Hermione, “It’s lovely out.”
Hermione flattened out the paper on the table, taking her quill and circling a passage several times, “The journalist is trying to lay out all the structural problems that are preventing progress.”
The other creature let go of him, scared off by Luna casting more spells in their direction. Still seeing Neville in the distance, hard swam towards them. Blasting one mermaid in the chest with a stunner and grabbing Neville around the torso. His eyes were closed and his chest wasn’t moving. As fast as humanly possible Harry headed for the surface.
Harry had to laugh to see it, his four friends sat around the table in his small room, pulling dish after dish off the elf shelf, dressed head to toe in Muggle attire – including Draco, whose only Muggle clothes were the black t-shirt and jeans Harry had given him.
“It’s not that,” said Luna, tucking her hair behind her ears as a pretty flush appeared on her cheeks. “I like Neville. He’s changed a lot this year, and he’s really smart and good with plants.”
“Well, in that case, I have no issue with it. Quick Blaise, find us the most extravagant drink on the menu.”
Draco was just starting to feel back in control of the conversation when the fireplace near them roared up with green flames and Harry stepped out, straightening his glasses and running a hand over his hair in an attempt to flatten it. A small cloud of dark ash kicked up around his ankles as he stepped over the hearth onto the pristine Persian rug.
Draco summoned a chair, mustering a smile at the gesture with difficulty. The Draco of six months ago would have been thrilled.
Harry saw himself staring back. The glamours were completely gone.
Draco dropped to his knees, his heart breaking for his mother. “Enough of this, I can’t watch you torment yourself. I know why you raised me to believe what you did, but I’ve seen more of the world now. I think I know what I need to do, but it would kill me if you and father thought I betrayed you.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, nodding. “And I am ready to make that commitment to you all. I promise to do anything that’s necessary to keep this group safe. The only higher priority in my mind is making sure Voldemort gets what’s coming to him. For Charlotte, and Al, and all the victims he’ll never have a chance to hurt. Are you in?”
He was a bit of an arse, sure, but also incredibly thoughtful and observant. He tried to maintain an appearance of indifference, but Harry didn’t miss how his face lit up when he talked about Quidditch, or the way he laughed at Harry’s memories of old Batman cartoons. Underneath this curated image was someone Harry might even like.
“Football?”
“Five, actually,” said Harry, withdrawing the locket from his pocket. “I’m pretty sure Neville’s locket is a fake.”
“I just can’t believe he never told me.” Harry tore his eyes away. “There were so many chances.”
“Did you know that all this would happen? That I would end up here,” asked Harry. “Was this all part of your plan?”
“Oh, it’s nothing really. Merely theoretical,” lied Harry, hoping that Luna would not run tattling on him for something that was clearly against the rules of magical safety. Her eyes flew over the matrix he’d scrawled out and he tried to tug it gently from her hands. “I was just about to throw it in the bin, actually.”
Luna rolled her eyes, but Hermione’s shoulders dropped and she sighed, smiling weakly.
Cedric held up the fake locket he’d Transfigured out of an aluminum can rather expertly. “I’ll get close enough that I can perform a switching spell with the fake locket, but it’s only a rough copy, so we’ll still need to get out of there fast. One look at this thing and she’ll notice it’s a fake for sure.”
and Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry and was rewarded with a silent laugh.
“You’re experimenting with charms?” asked Draco.
“No, you’re right,” said Draco with an agitated sigh. He didn’t want to lash out at Pansy with his own issues. “I just don’t think we ever would have seen eye to eye, you know? And I do feel for him. The
Draco tried to steady himself, his wand felt slippery in his hand. He knew he didn’t have a choice, but as Charlotte turned her moon-eyes to him, he thought of Harry and his resolve crumbled.
After all, Hogwarts was many things, least of which a Haunted House.
“Draco, what’s wrong?” asked Pansy, hastening to keep up with him as he made his way through the entranceway and down the corridor to the Slytherin common room. “You hardly said two words on the train and I haven’t seen you eat a thing all day.”
“Don’t kill him. The Dark Lord will want this one alive,” growled Yaxley.
“What would you do if you were in my shoes?” Draco asked, knowing that if Snape were anything like himself he would never reveal his true allegiances either way.
“I think we should try and organise a trip back to the Manor,” he said in a low voice, coming to take the handles of the trolley as Hermione inspected the produce.
“Are you serious? Peeves set off that dung bomb there last week and everyone’s been avoiding it and taking the west stairs. Or haven’t you been walking around the castle much?” said Draco, taking a few long strides in the other direction.
A smaller thug was trying to get his hand around her to pull her off the spoke, but she was winding herself deeper into the tyre. Harry started to turn – he knew things wouldn’t end well for the snake – when he heard small cries that sounded like the mewlings of a kitten. He felt a pang of sympathy for the helpless creature, but there wasn’t anything he could do. There were too many of them.
. At least one of them had been able to retain a sense of normalcy.
Draco could say nothing; let Harry struggle with the wand. If anything, it would make it easier to overtake him in the future. But Snape’s words of advice rang in his ears. If he needed Potter’s help to access the memory, it shouldn’t be too hard to befriend him. Giving him a bit of assistance might go a long way in securing his trust.
Sure the public jilting he’d given Theo on the ride back to Hogwarts was harsher than he might have planned on another occasion, but he had to be put in his place. If he didn’t do it now, he would have had to do it later. Now that Draco was a Death Eater, those close to him would be watched more closely. One slip up could mean severe punishment.
“It’s not,” Draco agreed, tossing it on the table next to the cup and fuming. “Damn. Back to square one.”
“Sneaking around in the shadows?” asked a voice from the empty hallway. “Much more can be accomplished when one is invisible.”
A small sound rang out, like the coo of a bird, and all three heads turned in the direction of the bundle in Dumbledore’s arms. The baby was stirring, blinking sleepily and flexing his little hand. He made a small babble again and clear, green eyes looked up at his would-be caretakers.
He gripped the arms of the chair as Blaise started to snore lightly and stared angrily into the fireplace, cursing Potter for messing up what would otherwise have been a perfectly good school year.
He had spent so many years trying to cover it up, wondering why he was cursed to have survived the accident that killed his parents, but suddenly, it felt like the most powerful thing in the world. A few of the students started murmuring to themselves. Ron and his crew nodded appreciatively, and everyone crowded in closer, their eyes on Harry.
“Stop being dramatic.”
They sat in silence for a moment longer, until Harry said. “I never told you everything I saw about the version of you in my diadem vision.”
“Still! She’s lucky it didn’t turn her to stone on the spot or something. My ability to heal has its limits.”
Tonks wheeled on him with fire in her eyes, casting a Silencing Charm around them. “Don’t you dare start talking like one of them. These people will die if they’re left here. We’ll deal with that evil twat and his lackeys later, but right now I need you focused on one thing: getting these people to the Order’s safe zone. Now, are you in or do I have to do this on my own?”
“What did you know about my father?” said Harry, the words choking in his throat.
“Well, are you good at glamours or not?”
“Just a bit of context,” drawled Draco. “I thank you for bringing me in on this goldmine of information, but you clearly know something that you’re not telling me. And since there’s no one else I can really talk about it with…”
“What do you want with us?” called Harry, his hand flying to his jumper pocket.
Yaxley smacked his compatriot on the arm and jerked a chin in Harry’s direction, not taking his eyes off him. “Carrow, are you seeing what I’m seeing?” he asked in a gravelly voice.
“I was thinking I might still try for university,” said Harry, pushing the thoughts of Sirius away.
Draco opened his eyes with a start, grabbing the edges of the couch.
“Yep, that was before you were born. I still saw Lucius two or three times a year back then. I remember the first time I saw him after that empire fell. He was a changed man. It was tangible, like he’d become unshackled from some great weight. And here’s where we get to the interesting part.”
“Why would an Albanian wizard care about usurping the English Ministry?” asked Hermione, as Ivy poked her head out over the pages of the large book she was reading.
He chided himself. There was nothing malicious in the castle anymore, and certainly nothing he couldn’t easily handle.
“He’s been in the mix,” said Tonks. “Did you hear about the Death Eater camp near Manchester they had to abandon to banshee infestation? That was Draco’s plan.”
“It’s about time you arrived,” said Pansy. “Draco was about to reduce this entryway to rubble if you didn’t walk through those doors.”
Magic crackled at his fingertips as he flopped back down on the bed, trying to slow his breathing, telling himself that it was just a night terror, it wasn’t real. But the feeling of his other self has been so visceral even he didn’t believe himself. Whatever he was looking at, these visions, he had to admit that he was seeing something real. He even got the strange feeling that his other self might have known he was there, watching.
He was about to suggest calling for Hermione when Luna grasped the tiara with both hands and held it up to eye level.
Harry turned back to the blond, who had an eyebrow raised. “Oh yeah, that’s Charlotte.”
“For someone who’s trying to avoid crowds, you’ve picked an interesting date.”
“In a way I do,” said Harry, sitting next to her and scooping a pile of potatoes onto his plate. “But I guess you always miss what you know.”
Draco was fighting nausea as he made his way down to the Potions dungeon so fast a portrait of a jousting knight tumbled off course, shaking his fist angrily in Draco’s wake.
“I know,” said Luna, unphased by her dismissal. “Only, if you unfocus your eyes, they sometimes form strange shapes. Almost like letters or… runic symbols.”
Though she squirmed uncomfortably at his first meeting with her, she seemed to relax into the memory, and he flicked through the ensuing weeks. Learning magic, duelling the others, Luna’s surprise arrival. He had to laugh to himself watching their diatribe on Muggle Studies — It was incredible really to revisit just how much had happened to him in the last few months and how much these four friends had changed his worldview.
“‘Zis way, if you please,” said the waiter in a heavy accent, motioning them through and then scurrying back out, drawing the curtain closed behind him.
“He would, he was just talking to me about it the other night.”
She turned over another card, which showed a man and a woman walking towards each other; the Lovers.
“I knew I should have gotten into duelling,” moaned Neville from the front, causing a ripple of tense laughter to waft through the group.
And the Dark Lord? Unclear.
Draco turned back to the newspaper in his hand, watching the charming way the glasses slid down Harry’s nose when he laughed. He looked up at the sound of fluttering wings to behold an incredibly ordinary looking owl descending into a perch on the chair opposite him. The owl regarded him quietly, tilting its head first one way, then another, and held out its leg to which was attached a small piece of parchment with his name in a familiar, slanted writing.
“And why do you think he chooses orphans, Harry,” said Voldemort, taking a few slow paces to turn and face him, a dangerous edge to his voice. “Because we are disposable.”
“No, no,” DuPont interrupted, waving a hand. “No, I know all about that. Doesn’t bother me.”
Harry’s heart leapt at the sight of the book and he ran his hands over the embossed words
Snape took a sidelong glance at the elf, who blinked earnestly and leaned closer with the phial.
Through Harry’s eyes, he could see the small space turn as he looked around. There was a strangely shaped door with a poster of Potter’s Muggle sports team. And to the right was a shelf with a few belongings spaced evenly apart.
“There’s a message in the locket,” said Cedric, holding the open locket up for the others to see.
“Do you resign?” asked Draco, walking in a few slow paces around his end of the hall. “There’s no shame in it.”
“Well, I haven’t accidentally erupted again, so I guess that’s a good sign,” said Harry, inspecting a suit of body armour on the shelves. “But I’m struggling to get a hang of this memory recall thing. Is that normal?”
“Be that as it may, he must have some power he is controlling. And it will only grow stronger with practice. To unlock Potter’s deepest memories, he may need to help you break down whatever mental or magical barrier is blocking them. And the best chance you have at that is by getting him to genuinely want to… open up.” said Snape, lazily sorting papers on his desk. “Put that back, Draco.”
“So was the diadem until today,” said Hermione, skimming the book. “Here, at least we know the cup isn’t a legend. It was in the collection of someone named Hepsibah Smith in the 1950s, but it’s been missing ever since. That’s about the right time for Voldemort’s Horcruxes, wouldn’t you say?”
“It was in Cedric’s notes, something about Dumbledore’s body having a blackened hand. The last time I saw him, we got into a massive fight. I don’t even remember how it started, but I do remember his hand was injured. And now I know the last thing I ever said to him was probably something awful.”
For a moment, the battle was one sided as dark robed figures looked to the front of the room for their orders while blocking or shielding what they could see coming.
He sat in the crackling glow of the common room fireplace, tucked away in a corner in one of his favourite chairs, where he had a view of everyone in the room. It was practically empty at this hour, though a few fifth-year girls sat studying in a corner, speaking in hushed tones and shooting glances in his direction every once in a while. He normally appreciated the attention of people who would someday bow to him, but tonight it was simply annoying.
He turned and headed for the seventh floor corridor.
“I don’t know any Ron,” said Harry, as memories of a gregarious redhead came swimming into view. Sitting on a train together, playing Quidditch, opening up presents of chunky knitted jumpers. “I didn’t know anyone until a few months ago.”
He landed on an attempt as vague as to be seemingly useless.
He was grateful for the distraction. His mind had been far too filled with thoughts of Potter lately, and the conversation they’d just had was replaying at top speed in his mind. He’d nearly exposed his own loyalties to the Dark Lord for Merlin’s sake, on nothing more than a spur-of-the-moment opportunity to come clean.
“Where are we?” asked Draco.
“If you had told me six months ago that I’d find myself listening to Muggle music in the attic of my ancestral home, with a bloke who was believed dead for 17 years I’d have said you were mental,” said Draco, coming to sit next to Harry.
“Don’t worry, Pansy. If I were after a quick shag, I’d ask you instead.”
Draco yanked the doors of the wardrobe open where the large stone basin lay glowing. “How good is your levitation?” he asked in Harry’s direction.
A chill ran through the room. Snape’s laughter died away to a hollow chuckle. Draco clenched his fingers on the edge of the desk.
“McGonagall told me,” said Hermione, quickening her pace to get out from under him. “And I wasn’t surprised when she told me you were the only one with Occlumency skills in the castle. Such a strange skill set to invest time in. From what I’ve read it seems like there’s a certain type of person who likes to shield their thoughts.”
“I am sorry, Harry. You deserved to know sooner. It is my single biggest regret,” said the portrait, folding his hands in his lap. “But the fact that you are here shows me that there were better teachers for you than I.”
implored Lily, sounding panicked. Harry jolted as the words hit him.
Instead, he raised his wand. Harry felt cold. There was a flash of green and then, nothing.
“Whatever it is, it’s bound to have some value, at least to the owner. This is an Asper Curse,” said Borgin. He flicked the black fabric open with his wand, pressing the corners out with his fingers, careful not to make contact with the dark object. “You wouldn’t want to try and steal this, that’s for sure.”
“Doesn’t seem hard to make a goal with a net that big,” said Draco, raising an eyebrow.
In one swift motion, he hurled the phial at the floor, shattering the glass into a million pieces as silver wisps of vapour began to coil from the splattered liquid within.
“If he’s not, I can’t see how I can release him,” said McGonagall, with a pang of maternal sympathy to her voice. “Another patient has gone missing from St Mungo’s. The Wizengamot is refusing to hear anything on the topic of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, but the International Confederation is readying itself. No one yet understands the dangers that await him out there. Has he exhibited any more magical flares?”
“I’m not angry,” said Draco, through gritted teeth.
Draco cringed, knowing what was coming next. In his memory, his mind was full to bursting with thoughts of Harry as he blurted out, “
His eyes fell on Draco, who looked momentarily lost in thought as he gazed into the dancing flames of the fireplace. The truce between the group extended to Draco, but just barely. The happy camaraderie they had once had as a group had been replaced by mission-driven cooperation.
“Never heard of it,” said Harry, flipping to the front of the newspaper, where a headline read,
“To which I say, was it flying or strategy that helped you win that last match against Gryffindor? Because I still think we were robbed,” said Fred, holding the kitchen door open for the others.
“Wizard’s chess looks a lot like normal chess,” said Harry.
Harry wanted to feel angry. He wanted to explode and send his aunt flying down the hallway like he’d done to Vernon, but he couldn’t feel anything. He was numb.
Harry felt his face grow hot with embarrassment, remembering his previous outburst. “About last time – I think I was just caught off guard,” he said, taking a seat opposite. “It won’t happen again, now that I know what to expect.”
“Out of the fire, Dursley,” said Draco. “Unless you want Granger on top of you.”
“Look, I know it’s dangerous and I’m doing what I can to deflect it, but you guys are missing the point,” said Harry. “We can use this to our advantage! I’ve seen the room where he’s living. We could even use this to spy on him. With Malfoy’s skill in Legilimency, maybe we could—”
Harry crossed the room quickly to her frame and pulled the curtains back to find the portrait empty. This
A dark shadow passed behind Harry, blocking out the light from the battle as the Dark Lord’s face split with glee. “Kill him, Lucius!” he cried.
“Oh, yeah, it was fine,” said Harry, unconvincingly. “You would have hated it,”
” and the chair lifted into the air with a jerk and cracked violently down the middle. “Huh,” said Harry.
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry flew into a rage. His breath was coming in shaky gasps, and his hands tingling, his ears ringing, and suddenly an explosive burst of magic ripped through him, shaking the house like an earthquake.
“I can make you something for that,” said Draco, before he knew the words were out of his mouth. “For the pain. I know a few healing potions that might help.”
She led Draco down a twisting pathway of streets and back alleyways. They did little to disguise their presence, but it didn’t matter, as the streets were practically empty save for a few stray cats. Draco followed Tonks numbly, playing the diadem’s reality over and over in his mind. Why had he been given this vision of the Dark Lord’s ultimate rule, when he wasn’t even on the winning side?
“To be honest, I don’t know,” said Draco, looking up at Harry, who was perched cross legged in a patchy crimson armchair, the wall behind him covered in pictures of motorcycles. “I never spent time with her before this year. Most people take one look at her and write her off, but they’re wrong.”
The buzzing began to subside in Harry’s ears, but like a charged battery he was still pulsing with magical energy. Maybe if he could calm down, just negotiate with McGonagall, she’d see reason. He opened his mouth to apologise when a blinding pain split through his head, and he cried out, falling to his knees.
Seeing a chance, Harry dives between two bookcases. Slamming a hand over his mouth he tries to as quickly and quietly as possible to slow his breath back down to a whisper of a sound. The splintering woodcuts and prods him all along his back. He will probably be bleeding from several spots.
Then his pursuer steps forward and Harry sees who is following him.
“Don’t act like you know what you’re talking about.” Harry growled, under his breathe he added, “I’m not what she needs.”
“Afraid I will kick your ass on the field?” Harry just kept going, seeing a chance to goad Malfoy.
“That explains all the birds he keeps in his office I guess.” Neville surmised, shrugging. Harry was more bothered by the thought of being near the forest. Too much had happened within it let Harry feel comfortable with anyone going inside it, even if they were just simple nonmagical birds. Maybe Hagrid had some idea on why the birds in the forest were suddenly so vocal.
“What does he have to gain though? Voldemort is dead and even then if Malfoy is caught doing anything even slightly Death Eater based his probation is forfeit and he could go to Azkaban for the rest of his life. He literally has no motive.”
The relentless following and searching felt like his way of gaining knowledge and to know was to keep yourself alive ultimately. It was his best skill for gaining knowledge, just like Hermione in a library. Even thinking that though, he could imagine the deep-set frown of Hermione’s disapproval. As she would ultimately remind him, the war was over and the habits, though once effective, were quickly becoming destructive.
He sat stock still, shocked, in front of the Mirror of Erised. He wasn’t talking to anyone. He was talking to himself, or from his perspective, he was talking to someone in his fantasy. Malfoy swiveled around, twisting his spine in a way that had to be painful. He wand slipped in his hand, clattering into the space between him and Harry.
“Just tired, couldn’t sleep.”
They circled in closer to one another, staring down each other and that was when Harry noticed something. There was something there that Harry had never seen before. It’s just a flash, easily missed if Harry wasn’t so lucky to catch it, but He sees it none the less. In Malfoys crystal clear eyes is a spark of life, excitement, joy. He looks youthfully happy.
Malfoy had disappeared into the background, a place that, since the first year, the boy fought against constantly. If there was a situation Malfoy could insert himself into, and even more so when it didn’t, than he was more than happy to do so. Like a glowing beacon of sheer annoyance, Malfoy always seemed right at Harry’s side to make sure his opinions were known.
He was quiet to open his dorm door, Ron’s snoring, ensuring that the click of the lock wouldn’t bother any of his roommates. The room was almost sweltering warm, with all the tapestries, small central fire, and bodies, compared to the large corridors of the rest of the castle.  Less than a month and the room was already a disaster zone of hazard hung quidditch posters, dirty clothes, and empty junk food containers. Most of it overflowing of Seamus’ corner as he seemed unable to throw anything away.
“Seems straightforward enough,” said Harry. “There’s only one choice that makes any sense.”
The Beater seemed to come out of his daze and a dopey smile spread across his face, revealing a chipped front tooth. He lumbered to his feet and took a few steps towards an attractive witch at the next table. He leaned toward her to say something and she hauled back and slapped him across the face, turning indignantly and marching off while the Beater looked on dreamily, hand cupping his cheek. Yep, definitely fool’s luck.
“How quickly a counsel becomes one.”
“I have assessed all other options, and I am convinced that this is the best place for him. It pains me that you do not trust in me as you once did, Minerva, but I must see to it that Harry remains here to be raised by his aunt and uncle away from our kind,” he replied.
“What Voldemort did in the first war,” continued Harry, ignoring the several gobstruck faces of students as he said the name. “Was to attempt to divide the magical community even further, by telling us that something as arbitrary as bloodlines could make us enemies. My parents died trying to prove him wrong, and I’m not about to let their deaths be in vain.”
Draco had kept a respectful distance since the discussion of Charlotte and his Marking ceremony, making Harry oscillate wildly between wanting to punch the daylights out of him or fall into his eyes again and relive a memory of a better time.
. Can you grab it for me, Luna? It’s just in my bag there.”
Landing on the memory of a cool marble floor, he looked up at the grand entry hall of the Manor, where a double staircase curled away from him. It looked taller than ever from his small vantage point, and the emerald green walls seemed to bow out like a fishbowl from this perspective. He was well versed in his memories enough to know that he could navigate to pretty much everything from a starting point in the Manor.
Harry looked into the crimson eyes, now level with his own.
“Well, they’re better than whatever horrible clothing Diggory found for us,” he said, pushing through into the crimson and gold room.
didn’t, and that’s what matters. I reckon Sirius could have been the same. A good guy, caught on the end of some bad decisions.”
Draco smiled contentedly at Angelica as he laid a hand on top of her own and laced their fingers together. Despite the bumpiness of the past few weeks, everything was finally coming together.
“Harry? What’s wrong?” asked Hermione, craning to look into his face. “We got the locket. The plan worked!”
But surely the Dark Lord would want him to get as much information as possible, and it wouldn’t be hard to get close to Potter. People were like puzzle boxes; all it took was a bit of tinkering to break in. And Potter was certainly a box he wanted to break into.
Rapid footsteps could be heard in the hall and an ebony door swung open, revealing a tall, blunt man with greying hair.
“Where did you say you obtained this?” asked Borgin, rising to look Draco in the eye.
“I can’t even look at you right now,” he said as he slammed open the door, and Draco could hear his feet receding down the stairs.
“Whatever you want, darling,” said Draco, trying to placate her quickly so he didn’t miss hearing what Lovegood knew.
“What does he know?” asked Snape.
The gravity of her words hit him like a ton of bricks. There was a pang in his chest as he pictured Harry’s stupid smile, the glint in his eyes as they bickered at the statue, the way he controlled the room when he put McLaggen in his place, his good-natured ribbing with the DuPonts on the golf course.
“I’m sure you can see how this puts me in quite a situation,” said Ollivander, tilting his head down to give each of them a meaningful look. “What makes you think I even know the wizard you’re talking about?”
Draco went rigid. He placed the glass down with a dull thunk. “I don’t know what you think you know,” he started in a low voice, the glow of the fireplace casting strange shadows on his eyes. “But I can explain.”
Harry and Draco both started as Luna sat dazedly up, rubbing her eyes sleepily with one hand as she removed the diadem with the other.
“It doesn’t matter, anyway! It would never work between us,” said Draco, finally exasperated. “He has no blood status to speak of. He hardly even has a family, not to mention the fact that he’s wanted by the law AND is an insufferably noble git on top of it all. Forget about what I want, my parents would never—”
“He says the Undersecretary is getting ready to file an injunction against Dumbledore’s estate in order to remove any latent control at Hogwarts,” she said, flipping to a new page. “Hm. Compact mirror rumoured to belong to Merga Bien. That could be interesting.”
“He’ll be fine,” said Draco, planting a quick peck on her cheek. Best to change the subject. “Did you enjoy yourself?”
“Enough, Wormtail,” snapped Voldemort, twisting his head and causing the fidgety man to let out a whimper. “Your eagerness displeases me. Can’t you see I’m busy catching up with an old friend?”
and see if there were any shortcuts he could work on.
“Treason, my dear. Treason of the highest order,” said Umbridge, licking her finger to page through a hefty document that she tossed down in front of McGonagall. “Attempted collusion to overthrow the Ministry, racketeering with the vigilante group the ‘Order of the Phoenix,’ reckless endangerment of minors – you name it, really.”
Back in the room’s normal configuration, Luna sat cross-legged on the couches while Harry laid the crown on the coffee table for the two of them to inspect. He now saw that the front of the tiara depicted an eagle with its wings spread, the blue gems dripping off of it like raindrops.
For once in his life, he let his anger consume him, embracing the wave of magic as it pulsed through him. He had no idea whether this would work, but it was the only chance he had. It was ending Voldemort’s reign today or die trying.
“Severus?” Draco said in disbelief, an echo of Harry’s sentiments about ten minutes previously. “You’re here too?”
“That’s a bit unfair then, isn’t it,” said Harry, surprised that he didn’t know something so important about his friend. Surely he’d know if Draco were dealing in dark artefacts, he had spent hours inside his memories at this point.
“I would, but in case you’ve forgotten, I’m not allowed outside of my bloody room.” Harry clenched his fists.
“I’m not getting anywhere near that thing after it ruined a perfectly good set of robes,” said Draco, wandering over towards the window and taking a seat in a nearby chair just the same. “Why do you even keep it?”
“See how faded it was around the edges? Sometimes old memories get a bit hazy and it can help to anchor in a sense, like the sound of a voice or the smell of a room.”
Sprout had enlisted the help of the older students to replenish her storage, claiming that greenhouses were great but one rarely lives their entire life near one. She wanted them to learn to scavenge, to use their wits, and be able to identify their supplies out in the wild. Leading to Neville, Luna, and him spending twenty minutes of their free time skimming the lakefront, in search of Lithops- Living Stones.
“… Okay, Good night.” Harry said head dropped low disappointed in himself just as much as with Malfoy.
