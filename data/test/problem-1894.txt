“Yeah,” is Malfoy’s hot response. He gets his hands under Harry’s mustard crop top and yanks at it until Harry lets him pull it over his head. Malfoy pinches his nipples and bites at his neck, tugs on his hair so hard that tears come to his eyes and he almost comes in his pants.
“I’m not the one threatening violence,” Harry says, sticking his face into Malfoy’s chest, scraping his teeth over his shirt. Malfoy makes a frustrated sound and pulls them both up and off of the chair, up the winding staircase to Harry’s bed, where his hair fans out soft on the pillows and his arse looks so perfect in Harry’s big hands.
“Because you’re the Boy Who Lived. I thought, well, Harry will certainly have a complex about making certain everyone treats me with respect,” Draco smiles. He’s joking, eyes flashing with a darling evil Harry has come to know as being for him only.
, when they sit beside each other at dinner. Harry takes breakfast from the elves in his rooms. He usually scrounges something for lunch. He wonders if Draco eats these meals with everyone else. Despite everything, he still finds himself wondering about Draco. He supposes that he is making up for five years without a thought about him. He’ll always be obsessed. And Draco isn’t helping it now, with his long black robes and long blond hair and all of his grace and height beside Harry, who is filled out and shorter and sometimes accidentally brushes his brown skin against Draco’s most pale wrist. Accidents happen. Draco has fine blond hair all up his arms.
strong connection, and is exceedingly rare. Some even say that the bond can only manifest itself when the recipients are soulmates, though that has not in any way been proven in a magical science capacity.”
“Draco, I want you,” he whispers. His voice cracks, and he swallows before continuing. His mouth is dry. “I like you. You won’t cause me trouble. We’ll be a power couple, like I said. I wasn’t joking. How could this bond have formed if I was stringing you along but didn’t truly want you?”
“Familiar?” Malfoy still isn’t looking up at him, his eyes fixated on something on the floor. Harry can’t help it, reaches to lift his chin manually. “I can feel it too. My own magic, in it. It’s our magic, Potter, either we did this ourselves without knowing or something in the house… Either way, it’s not solely your fault. It’s on the both of us.”
The next morning, Harry takes Malfoy to his local grocery, where Malfoy proceeds to convince him to purchase seven different types of ice cream treats after nearly coming to blows in the frozen aisle. And then they go home and fuck some more, with ice cream and lying naked on the floor listening to music and smoking in between.
They start to take lunch together, once the both of them realize that they have the same lunch hour free. Draco mostly grades, and Harry reads. It’s sweet. Draco sometimes hums in an interested, impressed way at what Harry is reading. It makes Harry roll his eyes and flick him off.
This is different. Harry knows nefarious magic, knows the difference intimately when something is trying to lull him into a false sense of security and when his own magic is making something to protect him. When he knew that he had sent that
“It really is not much at all. Just a stepping point, between Hogwarts and here I never much felt like I needed to buy much decoration, or furniture, since, well.”
“Potter. I know. It’s all right.” Malfoy looks up at him, pushes up to his hands and kisses him chastely. “Thank you for trying to valiantly to preserve my innocence and coveted privacy.”
It was seeing Harry’s head in front of him, in the air, the breeze against Draco’s ears making a rushing sound, like fire, and everything coming crashing then in his chest, Draco says. And all he could do was reach for Harry.
“So, to what do I owe the pleasure? I can feel you burning up wanting to say it, Harry. It’s Draco, isn’t it.” Her eyebrows are high on her forehead.
Malfoy looks nice, wearing big grey wide-leg pants and a peasant top with a deep v. His hair is left fluffy and framing his face. He has his usual light eye makeup and a single gold hoop earring. Harry keeps looking at him, knowing Ron and Hermione will see but not caring.
He spends the afternoon, over tiny sandwiches and tea, shaking and going over this moment with Harry beside him. Harry tells him,
“Draco, I’ve already asked them. They’re happy to invite you along. It’s a celebration of the school year, that it’s starting up. We want you there.”
“Harry. I’ll tell you a secret. It’s bigger than my closet, bigger than my Muggles,” Draco says into the dark hall. The house is big and comforting around them. Their home, Harry thinks. His heart aches. “I love you, too.”
Malfoy shifts in his seat, Harry can feel the bond shift along with him. He is hyper aware of it now, that buzzing feeling between them, on a plane he knows his magic to be on.
, Harry thinks. So he sits out in the garden he’s been grudgingly trying to tame, at least the first twenty or so feet of it out from the back porch, and writes Malfoy.
Winter at Hogwarts has never lost its magic. Harry stares out the window at snowball fights and students trudging to class and Draco scratches his scalp with the tip of his wand. They get into an explosive argument about Harry’s insistence on visiting Dumbledore’s portrait multiple days a week, and Harry feels bruised physically, in the chest area. Like he can feel the ache of the locket, still.
“You were not, come here,” Malfoy says. Again, so sure that Harry will come. And he does. He drapes himself across Malfoy’s lap, circles his arms around the back of his neck. “Come here.”
“Well, not so much since I got comfortable in Egypt. It was like I was so distracted all the time, with work and everything being so new, I forgot to have nightmares. And yeah, so…”
Harry looks down at him from his perch with dark eyes, almost black in the dim light of the gas lamps beside the mirror. Freezing rain pelts against the window, but Draco feels comforted by it, held by the house despite what tries so hard to get in. The candles around the massive claw-foot tub are lit, flickering on Harry’s pupils.
The next morning, a humid Monday, Harry is in the kitchen smoking his first cigarette of the day and nursing an iced coffee when Malfoy rings the doorbell.
“Apparate us?” Draco grunts. Harry pulls away and looks up through the kitchen window. Everyone is still inside, but nobody seems to be looking around for them.
“I’m in love with you, Potter.” To couch it with a “too” sounds like a joke, at this point. “I love you.”
Draco shakes his head, but he is squinting and pulling down the corners of his mouth desperate not to smile. Harry puts his bare toes over Draco’s and watches his shiver happen, all the way up his spine.
The next day, there’s tension in the air that Harry had been dreading all week, knowing that something was bound to tip over and spill out. He feels uneasy, when Malfoy leaves to the bedroom to fetch his book, and a cigarette does nothing to stop his itching fingers. Finally, Malfoy opens his mouth, closes it, then must decide he should say it, whatever it is.
It’s a slow fall. Harry is back from University in Egypt, five years of backbreaking work and getting the absolute least amount of sleep he’s gotten since the War. He comes back tanned and relaxed despite all of it, hating English rain more than he ever thought possible. He sleeps for three days, after hanging his shining diploma on the wall in the parlor, with all the pictures of his families and Luna in Singapore and he and Neville in giant wading boots, holding carnivorous ferns.
The fire starts up in the kitchen fireplace as he enters the room. The house has gotten used to his night owl ways, and is always ready for him to come down at odd hours and snap the lights on, the stove top burner to warm hot chocolate. He settles in at the kitchen table with yesterday’s
“You’re a hopeless case, Potter. You can’t help yourself from saving people left and right. It’s only right that I take advantage of that. If you’re offering.” Draco sniffs, and looks down his nose at Harry. It’s so reminiscent of him at age eleven that Harry barks a surprised cough. Something pings in his chest.
In bed, Harry has never, not with anyone, been held like this. Draco places him atop his chest, on his back, his head right below his chin so that he can stroke his hair. He holds Harry right over his heart and strokes his hair, massages his scalp without a word. And then Harry is asleep, before he can tell Draco just how much what he is doing isn’t working one bit.
“Alright, but assume we’ll be picking this discussion up sometime before spring. Daphne has already had to take over Defense for two months because you’ve got cold feet, and she doesn’t mind it, but that’s just because she loves to work herself to death, you see.”
“Draco, darling, I’ve kept some things for you I knew you would love. These are from Pam, and then some of these we think were Anita’s, but we can’t always be so sure, can we. That’s the
“You turn me on,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I like that you’re good at things. I like that you’re cool.”
“Harry. Harry. Sometimes, I swear, you are so silly. And forgetful. Willingly forgetful. I cannot forget. I cannot forget any of it, because
Harry pulls Draco onto his lap in the morning at breakfast, at the daily tactical meeting, at lunchtime when everyone drags themselves into the kitchen to see what’s around to eat, at afternoon tea in the parlor. He seems much too delighted to have Draco’s leg over his thigh at dinner. Harry likes to keep Draco’s ass between his strong thighs, likes to have his lips just brushing Draco’s cheeks at all times. It would annoy Draco were he not so similarly desperate to have Harry near him in every capacity for every moment they are available to each other. Harry tries to hold his hand through every meal, as if by letting go Draco will get up and fly out the window. Harry tells him that he loves him with everyone around. Draco wonders if they are better or worse than Granger and Weasley. Harry says,
So, he continues to work on the back garden while he waits for Malfoy. He wants to wait, because he wants him, and that is enough. He doesn’t mind it, almost, beyond feeling like he is stretched thin with need, because somehow he knows Malfoy will come back. And something to wait for feels like something to look forward to, and Harry has mastered finding things to look forward to to keep him going.
“It’s convenient. And nice, Ron,” he says. He has to ignore Malfoy’s little choking sound too, but he knows Hermione is analyzing their every move. “I like him.”
“I brought liquor,” she says, kissing Draco and then Harry on the cheek, shoving the bottle of fancy gin into Draco’s hands. He nearly coos at the sight of it, and Harry sends Ginny a grateful look. She smirks at him as Draco exclaims over how impossible it must have been for her to get it, however did she manage?
Harry reads it twice, and then falls asleep reading it that night, in the light of his starry bedroom ceiling.
Harry likes that they’ve all become teachers, and helpers, how they’re all scrabbling to make something better out of what they’d left destroyed, what their parents destined to be ruined for them. Something about Malfoy like this makes his heart explode. He knocks his socked foot against Malfoy’s red clog.
The lights in the big house have been dimmed and Draco has set up colorful fairy lights around each room and draped all of the lamps with silk scarves. Despite the crowd being fairly small, the party is loud and joyus, and Harry has a thrill inside of his stomach at the idea of Christmas, and New Years, and how good of a match he and Draco are and what they must look like together, standing as a unit and hosting.
, like all their lives they’ve known each other. And they have. He knows Draco in a way that he will never know Sinistra, or Flitwick, will never know Sprout, who is set to retire after this one last year. Conversations with Draco are sometimes minefields, rife with bombs of
Harry continues to write him. He doesn’t have much to do, and since Malfoy is suddenly skeeved out or put off by Harry, Harry can think of no better way to get him back than to write him.
“You know, as a child, when I was very young, I spent a lot of time in this house.” His tone is smooth and neutral. Harry raises his eyebrows to prompt him to continue. “I would hide from the adults in the kitchen, there would always be some row that started between my father and my mother’s side. And I would see that nasty elf-”
me, you idiot.” Malfoy takes him by the elbow where Harry is leaning onto him rather pathetically and drags him into the kitchen, sits him down at the table.
“I’m rather sick of it too,” Potter says. Draco starts, then is reminded dearly of Potter’s absolute abysmal Legilimency skills. Draco’s exact thoughts must have been stark on his face. He fingers the old scar on his chin, where it runs down his neck and chest. Potter watches his fingers. His eyes are dark, but Draco knows what he is thinking.
Harry digs his thick fingers into Draco’s bicep. Draco swoons against him, shameless. It’s easy to forgo shame in wartime. He is in love with Harry Potter. He kisses Harry on the cheek.
It takes a couple of hours before they make it to St. Mungo’s. They get caught up in testing the bond, or whatever it is, Malfoy standing out in the street and Harry in the back garden, Malfoy all the way to the grocery and Harry seated dutifully waiting on the front steps. He can feel it stronger the farther Malfoy goes, when he is away Harry finds himself desperate for Malfoy’s touch, his voice. Like he felt those first days, wanting him so bad. He feels sick that he didn’t think it to be a bond, that he merely believed it to come of his own wishes.
“Romantic soul bonds are usually professionally administered, to those who desire them, often in the case of a marriage. Wizarding marriages are, more or less, simply the administering of this bond to the recipients. However, in rare cases,” she ceases scribbling and turns to grin down at them, “the bond manifests itself. This is in the case of those who have a
“Get in me Potter, get in me, hurry, I can’t last forever you fuck, been waiting all day for you to get in me,” Malfoy says, babbling. Harry ignores him for as long as it takes him to calm himself down so he won’t explode from head to toe, then lubes Malfoy up with a gentle pat.
They all eat slowly, drinking and toasting Draco and Harry so often Harry has whiplash from turning back and forth to opposite sides of the table. Ron makes a speech that lasts a few minutes too long, and Hermione is too drunk to bother pulling him back to his seat, simply stuffing her face into his hip and plugging her ears. Harry is embarrassed almost the whole time, so many people give him and Draco genuine well-wishes that it catches him entirely off-guard. He doesn’t know why he assumed it to be any different, but he is filled with love for all of them. Draco sometimes shrinks into his shoulder, turning and hiding his face behind Harry’s back in humiliation, but a hand on his pretty knee pulls him back to the party, simple as that. The bond seems to enjoy the attention and the sparks everyone keeps sending off with their wands at the end of each toast, for it is warm between them and growing thicker, more full of the cool, effortless magic Harry can feel as being Draco’s. His fingers tingle with it, and he chain smokes to soothe the feeling of being so in love it makes him on edge.
Draco has learned to love Grimmauld Place and its humdrum lonely feel. It matches Potter, he thinks, his dark presence that is flipped like a switch into pure delight. The largeness of him that he came into after the death of his godfather, almost as if Sirius had gone inside of him and taken up half of the space. The house has expanded to fit all of them, and sometimes when Potter is out Draco will whisper to the wall of their shared bedroom and stroke it, to feel his blood thrumming with something from before in his fingertips, like how it felt to put his head in his mother’s lap. Potter sits in the living room with dragonhide boots propped onto the antique coffee table, and the floorboards themselves groan in fond protest of him. Draco has learned the rush of magic in the walls and its ever-shifting meanings.
“You can swim in it now, with me. If you’d like,” Harry says. Malfoy shoots him a look that’s absolutely dripping with it.
The kitchen is heavy, sticky with silence. The walls are black with shimmering blue pinstriped wallpaper, in the night. Potter uses his finger-flame to light his cigarette. Draco keeps watching. That hard pit in his stomach won’t go away. The night around them is winterfallen silence. The kind that is muffled further by the snow, dementor-snow, now. Heavy snow that is rare in London. Potter’s line of long black hair blocks half of his sharp face in waves, while the warm glow of the fireplace lights the other. Draco cups his hands around his teacup. His fingers are perpetually cold. The hot makes them sting. He does his best to contain a shiver.
Before long, Draco and Hermione have books spread out across the coffee table in the small parlor, the antique one with the leg screwed back on when Ron fell backwards onto it with they were twenty and wasted listening to Aerosmith, and they’ve ordered a curry and are all talking late into the night.
He starts over the next morning, after he’s finished going through all of Sirius and Regulus’ clothes he’d stashed in the attic while doing the remodel. He finds about twelve pairs of bell bottoms he thinks Malfoy will like and fit into perfectly, really just tiny little things that are much too long for Harry, he’s never been good at alteration charms, and too many of those puffy shirts and little velvet waistcoats to count. So he writes to tell Malfoy about that, to say that if he would like them Harry has them all cleaned and dust-free, hanging in the closet of the first guest room where he also keeps his dress robes, and he can come and peruse the selection if he so desires. Maybe he would have kept the clothes if he didn’t want Malfoy to come over so badly, but really, he can’t bring himself to try most of them on when he’s already imagined Malfoy inside of them.
, like Malfoy is forcing distance between them, ignores him until they are drying off in the lunar eclipse bathroom, as Luna had signed by the door beside her name, when Malfoy pulls him close and tugs on his cock.
“We have to talk about why it hurts so much for me to be apart from you,” Malfoy says. Harry jerks to look over at him, sitting in the green armchair, reading glasses at the end of his nose. Harry opens his mouth but nothing comes out, like he’s a fish out of water. “I mean physically, you dolt. I can feel a pull, here. I realized it this morning, about what was happening at the restaurant. You said you were sick, too.”
Harry relishes in the new feeling, though, that he gets from Malfoy. Even when they are sitting on opposite sides of the room, the air between them is warmer and Malfoy will look up at him with twinkling eyes that are so familiar by now, in a way much different than they were in school.
They are walking down the street with two large duffel bags of clothes, and some hanging on hangers as well. Malfoy laughs down at him.
Fall seems like a new beginning for Harry. It’s been years since he’s lived an English fall, and he and Draco sit out in the garden for hours in the middle of the day when it isn’t so cold, Draco reading and Harry drifting in and out of sleep. Draco sprawls himself out on the outdoor furniture gracefully, very long and malleable.
He loves the giant fireplace, heavy with old soot and carved with vague worn creatures, the big worn table and chairs, and the dark wood cabinets. The stack of old
“Fine. Fine! I’m sorry. Potter, I am sorry, so horribly sorry and regretful of everything that’s, that’s happened and everything that will happen now.”
“I love you. I’m done wasting time,” he says. Potter says it hot against Draco’s face. Draco is kissing him before he can take another breath. He tastes Potter’s blood.
He’s put on his brimmed suede hat and a silk scarf to go out, and his shirt is so tight and the waist of his pants so tight that he looks impossibly skinny but also quite cool, and Harry is maybe just realizing it now, how he looks so retro with his outfit and his white ankle boots, cigarette hanging carelessly from his lips as he delicately sorts through two racks of clothes.
Harry nods. He doesn’t know what to say to this Malfoy, who is teaching Potions at Hogwarts but is also getting hammered at Luna’s at noon on a Wednesday after term, wearing an antique lace blouse and tight bell bottoms. This Malfoy who has put on muscle but is still thin and willowy to one side, whose cheeks look immeasurably soft. Malfoy studies him, then laughs lightly. Good-naturedly. Harry wants to make him laugh, he thinks, and feels himself blush.
Draco remembers their conversation like it happened moments ago, can still feel the burn of the frozen air shock his lungs. Potter had told him he was glad to work with him, and Draco had stared at the round muscle of his shoulder beneath his thick white t-shirt. It had been freezing, and Potter’s usually quite rosy brown skin had been greyed and goose-bumped.
When they are back in Harry’s living room, he turns to confront Malfoy finally. His purposeful silence at St. Mungo’s and then all through their stop at his apartment to gather his necessities has been grating on his ears far more than his rambling could be in any other situation.
“I- yeah, I didn’t mean to wake you. Nightmare,” he says. Draco nods, rubs his hand across his face. There is a crease on his cheek from the pillowcase almost parallel with the scar on his chin. “You should go back to sleep.”
When they are nearly to the castle, Draco stops to stare out at the snow, and Harry grips his delicate, sharp jaw in his hand that looks so large on his face and kisses him hard. Draco chokes into his mouth, but then immediately opens those pink lips and pushes that hot tongue Harry’s always wanted to touch against Harry’s.
“I’m telling you, Potter. When they find out you’re with me, and I wear a miniskirt to the next Ministry event, you’re done for,” he says. Harry’s heart squeezes. He takes both of Draco’s cold hands into his own, clasps them between his palms. Draco comes up into his space unconsciously, one moment he is not there and the next he is breathing into Harry’s mouth. His cigarette has disappeared somewhere.
“I would recommend you remain in the same house. You will notice, if you part, that you will become exceedingly uncomfortable and that the discomfort will only grow worse as time passes. This
“What are you saying? I’m not in trouble because of you, I rather like you, like I said, I wasn’t lying to you, I mean the bond is indicative-”
“Oh my god, so hot. Draco,” Harry says into his mouth. Draco nods, kissing him. And then, they’re laughing at all of it, standing up against the door. Draco’s hand on the doorframe. Harry cups his chin again, just looks at his eyes and his lashes and those pink cheeks. He taps a finger on his bitten lips. Draco and his music taste, and how he writes, and his little ass in his desk chair, his long robes and his pretty cock and all of that
“Yes, it’s the original,” Draco says. He is leaning down to speak to George, and Harry laughs at the sight of them. “I have most of the originals.”
of, that he doesn’t mind asking Malfoy to stay the night, and then keep staying the night, again and again and again until he doesn’t think he has to ask anymore.
Malfoy folds up the paper and drops it to the porch, turning to his side in the lawn chair to face Harry. He is wearing a pink shirt and pink wide leg pants. His pants always seem so tight around his dick, Harry thinks. He doesn’t know how he can stand it.
“So?” Harry leans into his space, across the polite divide Malfoy has created between them. Malfoy leans away a little, but still tilts his face up to Harry like he wants to be kissed, and Harry kisses him, biting his bottom lip first, just gently. Malfoy leans in and Harry’s lashes flutter involuntarily, and then Ron is loudly exclaiming from the doorway about how excellent the coffee is, really.
“Travelling. You have got to come to a few games, you know, I can get you both tickets and you could come on weekends, when you’re not both teaching-”
Malfoy doesn’t go on, trailing off into silence. Harry looks around and confirms it to be so. There is not much of anything in the whole space.
Harry nods. Shakes his head. He doesn’t know. He looks over to the cupboards, finger printed in day glo by Teddy.
Eventually, Harry is writing Malfoy that he misses him. In one drunken letter, he even ends up writing that he misses his cock, and wishes it was in his mouth, and if Malfoy wanted to come over right then he should and could and Harry would be waiting for him all night. And that he was sorry for everything and how it had ended up. But Malfoy had responded with much of the same, ignoring all of Harry’s frankly embarrassing pleas for attention. And Harry had passed out more or less immediately after he had sent the thing, after all.
“You want one?” Potter asks. He’s taken to engaging Draco in conversation at every opportunity. Especially when Draco craves silence. His voice is deep and cracking around the smoke. There’s a bit of tinsel on his broad shoulder, likely from brushing against the hallway decorations on his way in from patrol.
“I think it’s lovely, Harry, if you want to see him. I mean, we’ve all been hanging around him for years, really, he’s quite a bit different from when we were kids, you know. Much more himself, I think. Like his father isn’t hanging over his head so much,” she says. Harry agrees. “And I think that you two have always had something, really. You well obviously liked him a bit in sixth year, or couldn’t get him out of your head.”
“Thank you,” he says, and Draco sees his eyes brim a little. He gently lifts Harry’s hair and twists it into a bun atop his head.
, that permanent scowl he gets when he does deep on his face. They are close enough that Harry can see him, despite him being a bit blurry.
Which he did, and had commissioned Luna to paint the bathroom ceilings. And then, when all of it was done, he slept in each bedroom for as many nights as there were them, so as to admire his own handiwork.
The kitchen is one of Draco’s favorite rooms in the old house. He spends a decadent amount of time here, when not on patrol, working out in the cellar, or agonizing over theory in the library with Granger. He wakes before all other inhabitants of the house, even Minerva, who usually comes down for tea half an hour after him. It is a not-rare, but still precious morning quiet.
But now, with Potter’s face in the firelight, it is silent but for their breathing. Draco’s eyes lift upwards to the ceiling. He can’t truly place where it is in the dark. Just pitch black, oblivion above their heads. The house swirling family magic in the spaces that they do not take up.
“Put something on, Potter. Something good,” Malfoy gestures to the turntable, and Harry groans loudly. “Come on, Potter. I want to feel bad, convince me to stay. Huh? D’you want me to stay the night? Put something good on, then. I might like you if you do.”
“And you, well. You were a part of it, why I thought I would be alright coming back,” Draco says. Harry smirks.
It is a Friday when Harry finds himself in short sleeves and denim cutoffs, a final wave of heat before fall comes tumbling to the grounds of the castle. When he knocks on Draco’s office door in the late morning, he finds Draco’s fingers wrapped tightly around his wrist— cold and smooth, tickling the hair there— and lifting his arm to inspect every last one of his tattoos. It makes Harry laugh again, and he realizes, with Draco’s face squeezed in shameless curiosity, that he hasn’t laughed this hard this many times in months.
It now feels almost, tentatively, as though he belongs in the place. With Harry’s décor. And the house adores him, plies him with wine and fine whiskeys it won’t even provide to Harry.
“All I am saying, really, Harry, is that I know you have a thing for him and I think you should just tell him that you quite like him. Look at you, all cut up about it. Is he at Grimmauld now?”
“You’re getting more freckles,” Malfoy says to him, near impossible to hear around the creaky pipes. “Freckles all over…”
“Thank you,” Draco says. Stilted. Harry nods. The Draco knocking on his door in midwinter six stretching years ago, tears frozen to his cheeks, to ask for Harry to accept his well-rehearsed apology and thanks, is a million miles away. Draco is older and has broader shoulders, like Harry has filled out from Hogwarts feasts.
The first time he and Potter had really spoken, after Draco had felt settled enough in the place to make his own tea without invitation from Severus, it had been in the garden, in the winter. No-one had bothered in decades, maybe, to tend to it the way wizards do, and the perennials had been sleeping in ways Draco had only seen in the woods around the Manor, never in the perpetually flowering gardens on the grounds. It had been silent as a result. It had felt wild and far away. Potter had brought him out for a cigarette. Sirius had been dead three years, by then.
“I’m trying, damnit, I’ve written him and tried to talk to him in person, but he’ll come for days and then leave me again as if it’s nothing, but then again, he said he was obsessed with me and then left for so long and ignored everything I wrote him.”
“Fucking shit, Potter. You are a piece of work. I do declare,” Draco mumbles around the cig. Harry giggles and decides to let the ‘Potter’ go. “You’re lucky I’m sticking with you because I’ve neared the end of my rope time after time. A bloody eccentric…”
It is not a question. Harry hates how well she knows him. He wants to respond but can only nod. She rolls her eyes.
“I am here,” Harry says. Malfoy strokes his hair back from his forehead, where it is hanging in his face. Harry snaps his fingers and his drink comes to rest beside Malfoy’s wine on the coffee table. He disentangles himself from Malfoy’s body to take a gulp.
Luna cuts them slices of lazy-daisy cake with “Welcome Home Harry” written on in calligraphy-by-frosting in gold, atop the coconut topping. Harry winks at Luna’s serene acknowledgement of their clasped hands, and leads Malfoy again out to the garden, sits him down on the blue bench Harry painted years ago. The green is just popping out from the ground and from the budding flowers, leaves from brown dirt. The birds are singing in the early afternoon, near morning time. Malfoy lights a cigarette and Harry watches him smoke it.
“I’m half redhead,” Harry says dumbly. Malfoy snorts, kisses him on both cheeks where Harry knows his dimples to be, because Ginny would kiss him there, and then Dean, and now Malfoy, who is in his shower all over him. “Like you’re half veela.”
Being with Draco feels like the war was mere days ago, sometimes. And then, others, like it never happened. Harry comes into Draco’s office on the Saturday two weeks before classes and Draco is playing The Breeders at top volume, silenced behind his door to spill out into the corridor when he lets Harry in. Harry laughs and laughs while Draco drinks brandy and watches him collapse to the ground,
It’s something they haven’t done together yet, and it surprises Harry how Malfoy gets them both high immediately, then takes him to a car boot sale and then to two Muggle sales out of their own mansions in London. Both are being hosted by older women dressed to the nines in all sorts of costume, and both of them know Malfoy very well, it seems.
And if the next morning, when Draco has gone to bed and everyone has gone home, Harry sends off a quick letter to McGonagall, Draco will be none the wiser, fast asleep with his eyeshadow smeared down his cheeks and his lips soft and open.
“Okay? I’m just going to let you fuck me, then. Nothing else. We shall… coexist,” Malfoy says. Harry nods, under his hand. Malfoy’s palm is soft and his hand is long across Harry’s face.
Harry thrills in being back home full-time, being in a place of his creation instead of his thin-walled apartment in Cairo. He feels so spoiled by space, and color, in a place so radically different from anything the Dursleys would ever even
Harry kisses him sweetly, makes it wet and warm and good. Malfoy whimpers into his cheek and wiggles down onto his dick unconsciously. He pulls back and rests his forehead on Harry’s. His smooth skin on Harry’s scar, so shocking in its delicateness.
“I think I like you,” he says. Malfoy’s hand stills for half of a half of a second, just barely long enough for Harry to realize it’s happening, but then he is kissing Harry even harder, whining a little into his mouth. “I really, really like you.”
Kreacher eventually brings them whiskey and lemonade and croissants. Harry insists on feeding Malfoy his, bite by bite, Malfoy’s perfectly wonky teeth snipping at the tips of his fingers dangerously. Malfoy makes him giggle, when they aren’t fighting, and sometimes even when they are, like a real silent belly laugh kind of joy. It’s intoxicating, and Harry isn’t that drunk but he is seeing double by the time they are sun-warmed and too tired to stand being outside anymore.
and make an early dinner curry for the both of them. He starts another pot of coffee while he is in the kitchen and then marvels at how easy it feels to be with Draco. Only one day of this and he is already comfortable. It’s likely to do with how they had already been codependent, since that party at Luna’s, except he still thought that there was some kind of conflict bound to start up at every moment, then.
Harry is so comfortable and satisfied to his core that he falls asleep again and wakes up refreshed rather than even further muddled in the head. Draco is sleeping too when he wakes, and Harry leaves him to rest to go cast a
“Oh, come on, Harry. You know you’re going to take the job. You’ll be the married couple of Hogwarts, the kids will be fascinated by you two,” she says. Ron and Hermione have already gone to the kitchen and are exclaiming faintly over the table spread.
More stupid comments, and Malfoy is laughing even harder, pressing fingers beneath Harry’s cheekbones and rubbing up against his teeth through his cheeks. His palm cups beneath Harry’s chin, and he kisses him wet and uncomfortable right under the showerhead.
“Thanks,” Harry says. He’s wearing a pair of Sirius’ pants, a purple straight leg. “I like yours, too.”
Harry snorts, pats the top of Draco’s hand. He strides ahead a few paces, and then turns to face Draco.
Draco sniffs, long. Harry lifts both arms again for him to see. Another offering. Draco’s fingers go to his inner tricep, tracing the sketched snitch, there.
“What?” Harry’s jaw has dropped. Malfoy has a hand covering his eyes, now, like he wants to peek at Harry but can’t allow himself to.
, travelling up through his fingers and in a line of fear and more-than-possibly excitement up his arm—settling in the crook of his elbow and then barely missing giving him a spasm to splash the teacup he was setting (peace offering) on Draco’s desk.
“What?” Malfoy is distracted with patting his pockets for all of his necessary items. “What are you on about?”
Harry kisses him, then. He wants to eat Malfoy up, swallow him down and have him live inside of him. Malfoy kisses him back just as hard, and Harry is high on the relief that Malfoy wants him as much as he wants Malfoy. They bite each other and Harry tugs him in so close his hat falls off, and Malfoy pulls him to sit him down on the red armchair, climbs onto his lap and pulls his dick out of his purple pants.
Malfoy ignores him, though, not without a cherry blush, and stuffs his face back into Harry’s chest.
“Potter. I’d be happy to join. You know Granger and I worked together, yes?” Harry nods. Hermione had led workshops on Hogwarts curriculums when he had been in Egypt. She had written him saying that she and Malfoy were going for tea regularly and that they had been revolutionizing, in her humble opinion, a more inclusive and well-rounded approach to Muggle studies. How Malfoy had provided insight into the topic, Harry hadn’t asked. He loves to imagine, retroactively, Hermione in her oversized cable-knit sweaters and Malfoy in his velvet pants chatting over tea.
“Come back with me,” Draco says. He crosses the room to Harry and puts a warm hand on his shoulder. “Do you do this often? Lose sleep like this? You’re all settled in.”
Malfoy drapes the paper over the armrest and gestures to his gut. His knobby knees are crossed over, in his stripedy pants. Harry stares.
Harry grins, lights Draco a cigarette, still lying on him, and they share it with Harry’s fingers stroking the side of Draco’s neck, up behind his ear, along his hairline. It’s more than they’ve ever spoken about it, and Harry feels immensely drained. He isn’t used to speaking his emotions, and doubts he ever will be. Draco is a welcome diversion, especially when he starts ashing onto Harry’s hardwood floors and he needs to be pinched lightly on the thigh for it.
Harry wakes from a nightmare for the first time since Egypt early that morning, or very late that night. He knows the score by now, the panicky sweaty bright lights behind his eyes type of feeling that he wakes with, the gasp and pounding heart. He doesn’t remember the dream when he wakes, just shadowy thoughts of snakes and something creeping behind a door. And then, Draco snoring softly beside him, one of his long hands splayed across Harry’s side, thumb to his ribcage.
“I know, I know,” Draco mumbles. His fingers brush freezing to Harry’s stomach, bringing a gasp out of the bottom of his belly where he has touched him. “I know. I need you, Harry.”
“I don’t think there's much chance of any child of mine being a redhead,” he says. It’s what he decides to go with, in the interest of remaining neutral.
“Do you think we should invite Hermione over?” Draco asks once they are finished and sprawled across the tabletop. He is drawing circles on the wood with his finger. Harry watches his perfect fingernail and his sweet knuckle. “To tell her, I mean.”
“You look nice!” Harry says. Malfoy clicks his tongue and turns away from him. “Don’t throw a tantrum, I’m serious. I think you look lovely today. Are you enjoying the lunch?”
As the time approaches, Harry dutifully sits in the hallway as Draco obsessively checks his eyeshadow in the hall mirror, insisting that it has the best lighting in the house, up until the moment Ron and Hermione arrive, with Ginny trailing behind them.
It’s not much of a letter, but Harry doesn’t really know how personal he wants to make it. All he knows is that he
you hate me being here, I’ll just go up to the study, I could be working on lesson plans, I have many, many things I could get done in this short time you would finally be out of my hair. Trust me, there is nothing I would like more,” Malfoy snaps. Harry looks him up and down, appalled.
Draco can feel a change in the air, something about the way Potter’s eyes flash. He knows it’s coming. He doesn’t want to stop it, so he doesn’t. He just waits.
, darling. But I’ve kept them aside because you know, when you know they’ll be taken care of, you want to wait,” she says as she lights a cigarette and offers one to Malfoy.
Harry had laughed, deep and caught in his throat, and Malfoy’s eyes had flashed dangerously, hungry. Harry had sucked him right back up.
He doesn’t quite remember how, in hindsight, but soon he and Malfoy are standing in Luna’s bright kitchen, Malfoy snatching the joint right from Harry’s mouth and exhaling smoke in his face. Despite Malfoy’s extremely satisfied look of impish delight Harry cannot find it in himself to be annoyed. There is something tugging at his gut at the smile lines on Malfoy’s cheeks. Those weren’t there seven years ago. Malfoy’s arms are certainly more sculpted than previous. He is simply beautiful in the afternoon hours in Luna’s familiar house, too much so for Harry to be able to ignore it.
“Let’s say I do,” Harry cuts him off. Malfoy chuckles, a lush, posh laugh that Harry is ashamed to admit, even to himself, cuts straight to Harry’s core. Or his dick. Or both.
Draco gently wipes the blood from his face, his lips, down his neck. He pulls Harry’s shirt off gently, heals his sprained shoulder with spellwork he had to learn while still living with his aunt. Neither of them speak, but Draco’s stomach is bumped by Harry’s knees, which aren’t nearly as knobby as they were when he wasn’t fed. Draco is washing his face once more when Harry puts his thumb on his bottom lip, pulls down a little. Draco wants to cry for his tenderness.
“Technically, they’d be at least one-fourth redhead any way it’d go,” Harry says, earning a quick spank from a damp hand. Harry squeals, shamefully, and Malfoy wheezes a long laugh. “But, no, not Weasley-wise. No.”
,” Malfoy says. His voice is high in his throat. He reaches to take his wine back from the coffee table as Harry sucks at his underwear. “And you’re good. And you want me.”
He knows that this is why one evening he and Harry go to bed and find their twin beds shifted into one king-size, soft, curtained heaven. Draco laughs at Harry’s complete bewilderment.
The house likes Potter. Draco was surprised to find it so at the beginning, when he had been taken off his post as teenage-spy. He had still been enthralled by his family history in the worst way, and had felt a twinge of betrayal, maybe, at Potter’s reckless treatment of the place. Stomping mud everywhere. Putting cigarettes out on the bathroom tiles while he showered. Spitting into the sink. But the house had siphoned up the dirt, had let the water run off the ash. And Draco had learned to do the same, too, somewhere between then and now.
Smoking and eating yesterday’s leftover curry, he feels confident in his home and his adulthood and Harry wants Malfoy, wants to see him in his ancestral home that still has that construction and that magic despite being so changed. Malfoy leaving has convinced him of how badly Harry wants him here. And when Malfoy writes back to Harry after those two weeks of fucking and eating and fighting that yes, he’ll come back for dinner, and would Harry like him to bring food and wine along? Harry twitches and knocks his beer over, spilling it all down the kitchen table.
“That’s all right,” Draco says. Harry has a feeling he’s no longer talking about the cigarettes. Draco scratches the inside of his elbow. Leather smooth as butter on his gentle fingertips, well-manicured nails.
“Well, if you like it and think it’s all right to keep the bond, I mean, it seems like you do, a bit, then I would say you’ll just need those three-ish weeks to keep close, then you should be all right,” Hermione says around a mouthful of chicken. “I mean, it’s not like your lives will change dramatically once the bond has settled. You’ll be able to live your lives as you did before, it’s just a connection point, really.” Her dark purple lipstick is smeared a little on her chin, and Draco reaches over to her to wipe it with his napkin.
Malfoy turns back to face Harry, pulling a cigarette out of the top of his leather boot. He stuffs it in his mouth hurriedly and lights it with a snap of his fingers. He closes his eyes to take a drag and a little line Harry has never seen before manifests between his eyebrows. Harry waits.
“Who’s done all of this?” Malfoy had asked, in his bed with the baby blue blue silk sheets and the Peter Max duvet, naked and so so pink himself, panting and desperate with his dick in Harry’s mouth. Harry had pulled off of him, delicious, sweaty at his tender hipbones, to great protest to answer.
“Come to my house,” Harry says. Malfoy shivers. Harry can feel him hesitate, but then he nods. The way Harry’s spine lights up with shivers at his response almost makes him laugh, who would have thought. Him and Malfoy. Maybe there was something in the cake.
“Ooh, any teasers? I’ve been telling the girls about your connections, you know, and they’re just dying to meet you and see your face, love. You know how they are, hangers-on.”
Harry jumps, drops his biscuit on the floor. Draco is standing in the doorway, rumpled. His hair is sticking up in the front. Harry’s heart skips a beat, thrills at the sight of him. He is so gone.
Malfoy goes back after the second day to fetch some “blouses that cover his midriff” and that don’t give off the impression that he is a “druggie,” and ends up taking half of Harry’s bedroom closet with his creamy silk button-ups, pussy-bow blouses, and velvet flared pants. Harry spends enough time wondering why Malfoy’s adult style has seemingly been so influenced by Muggle seventies rock stars (and “druggies”) to warrant him asking Malfoy flat-out, but decides against it. They mostly fuck, anyways.
Somehow they end up in Malfoy’s little living room, on the couch under a throw. Malfoy had insisted they both strip down to their underwear, and now he lies on Harry’s chest, making patterns in his skin with his finger. Harry keeps getting a chill, and then Malfoy will put his palm down where it starts and Harry will be warm again.
“No, Potter. I may welcome you into my personal space more often than not, lately, but I do know where I am and am not welcome, otherwise. There is not a chance in hell that Weasley or Granger would ever want to speak to me, let alone at one of your precious shared pub nights.”
“He isn’t wrong,” Hermione cuts in. Harry does sneak a look at Malfoy then, who looks as if he is about to faint. He covertly beckons him over to the loveseat, where he sits gingerly beside Harry. He clasps his hands on his knees and doesn’t speak a word until Hermione directly asks him a question fifteen minutes into the conversation.
“‘Mione. I’ve invited her and Ron for tea. You don’t have to be here, but. If you’d like, I’m sure they’ll bring pastries and stuff from this French bakery we go to, and there’ll be enough to share, and-”
“You just say that because you’re incapable of toning it down,” he says. Malfoy scoffs, runs a careless hand through his hair. He jerks his chin up and Harry stares at the long lines of his neck.
Malfoy speaks quickly and matter-of-factly, as he gets more comfortable. Harry realizes that he’s always had Malfoy’s quick tenor memorized, like he could make Malfoy say anything in his head. Harry nods belatedly, though Malfoy hardly asked anything of him.
“You’re back,” Malfoy says. He says it as if he is volunteering the information to Harry casually, as if Harry himself was unaware. “I didn’t know you’d be back this year. For good, that is.”
. And it is so strange, for them to be together and going over that time, in the very castle, so many years later. Draco is baffled how the memory could be pushed far down enough that he ended up only remembering once he was far in the air, and Harry is caught up in the feeling of reassuring him.
“Harry, have you heard The Cure? Luna sent me—” Harry cuts him off by flying straight past him, taking off towards the castle. Draco squawks, comes after him immediately. Draco was never the best at quidditch, but he and Harry were certainly a match. They twist around each other and Harry feels it high in his chest, like he’s twelve years old. And then, Draco’s hand is tight around his arm, and Harry understands, guides them down slowly, to the grass so green.
Harry has been fielding letters from McGonagall for far too long to be able to do something about them by the time term starts, and he tells himself that he had wanted to, sure, except that he had gotten married sort of all of the sudden, and he had so much to think about, so he couldn’t possibly take the job of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts on such short notice.
“He does not. Merlin, you sound like a teenager. Why don’t you just talk to him, tell him you like him? I’m too old to be playing wingman for you. You’ve done all of these lovely things with your life, you’ve lived abroad, you’d think you could just confront your reality at home as well.”
“Hmm. So curious, Potter. Thought you would for sure,” Malfoy says. His voice is low, and his grey eyes are trained at Harry’s hipbone. “Everyone was so certain.”
But- really, something about it feels like it came from the two of them, something about the magic feels familiar and comfortable. Harry has dealt with cursed objects, has fought their magic off and placed them behind magical barriers without trouble while his classmates passed out or vomited onto their desktops. He’s experienced magic that tries to control him, he is immune to the
“I don’t care about your feeling responsible, Draco. I don’t care. I want you there, and I deserve to be selfish. You’re my friend. You’re fucked if you think otherwise.”
“Watch, Potter,” he snaps. Harry watches the spell between them, bright electric purple and pulsing. It makes his eyes ache, but he can’t look away now that he’s paid attention to it. A hot pink, fuzzy waving line travels between them, snapping like lightning and dropping up and down, up and down. Harry’s eyes nearly cross trying to follow it.
“I want you in a miniskirt at the next Ministry event. I can’t imagine it any other way,” he says. Draco’s forehead is still wrinkled in angst, and he is biting his bottom lip. “I hope you wear bangles, too. And a puffy shirt. I won’t let you dress in stuffy robes. I don’t even really
“Yeah,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes and shifts down in his seat. his bare toes wiggle on the hardwood floor, and he momentarily digs them underneath the purple rug beneath the coffee table. Harry watches all of that, because Malfoy’s delicate, pale ankles and calves are something to rave about. When he makes his way back up Malfoy’s bright blue denim pants and his little silk shirt to his grey eyes, he’s staring at Harry intently. And hotly. “I was listening.”
“I know. I mean, I’d gathered. It seemed private, and, that’s a bit why I didn’t ask, because you had never invited me here, and-”
“It’s nothing. Can we just get settled?” Malfoy spits this through a thick cloud of smoke and rage. But Harry sees how his hands are shaking.
“Well, obviously I have some magical means of keeping everything perfectly preserved, in my closet at home. But these, now that we’re at the corner-” Malfoy pulls his wand from his back pocket and taps all of their bundles, and they disappear into the tiny bag over Malfoy’s shoulder. “Now, come. I’ll show you
“Looks like you’ve got a little family here, Harry. Not so lonely in the big house, eh?” Harry rolls his eyes, ignores Malfoy going grey.
know. I think I know her better than you do, just because I’m a Gemini and therefore better at psychoanalysis,” Draco offers. Harry laughs and stands to walk over and grip the collar of his pajama shirt. “What?”
“Was boring tonight,” Potter says. A thick cloud of smoke spills out of his mouth on the comment. Draco raises a brow in acknowledgement. “‘S getting old. Patrol. Especially ‘round Hogwarts. I mean really, with Sev up there, what’s the worst that could happen? Nothing I could prevent, that’s for sure. We’ve been thinking they’re creeping further east, now that their numbers are fewer.”
Their healer is younger than them, a witch Harry vaguely recognizes from Hogwarts, or maybe Beauxbatons. She is much more cheery than Harry thinks the situation calls for.
Draco’s face changes into something, something open and forlorn and longing. His forehead goes into little lines. Harry smiles.
in third year, he knew it in his bones. He could feel it in his magic, the knowledge that he was wrapped up inside of that magic and reflecting it outward. He doesn’t know if he should tell Malfoy, or simply wait to hear more from a Healer.
“I hated him in sixth,” Harry says. Hermione laughs at him, so hard that tears come to her eyes, and turns away from him to the fridge to compose herself. “What. What? I did, he was a right git and I wanted to kill him, a bit. I nearly
They stay in Malfoy’s apartment for a little while. Neither of them having anything to do, both a blessing and a curse the whole long summer, Malfoy pulls him to one of the vanities and has him go digging through the drawers of lingerie to dress him. Harry puts him in a tight little bullet bra and matching panties with little bows on the hips, thigh high stockings and delicate garter belt, and then he ruins him and probably the whole set on the floor, fingers under Malfoy’s bra to pinch his nipples and mouth all over the panties to make him come.
“You’re welcome,” Draco says, and Harry flushes at how soft his voice becomes, how he looks over at Harry again with his cool eyes. “I like your pants.”
Draco had suggested he put on a sweater, or a jacket. Potter had looked down at himself in genuine surprise.
“You are, don’t bother arguing again. I don’t want you like this. We’re a good team,” Draco can physically feel himself doing the turning-up-his-nose thing. Potter laughs a little, hushed in the close room. The house makes a sigh, so alive with Christmas and despair.
. And all anybody ever talks about is sweaters this, scarves that. Pea coats. And I’m not saying it’s all awful, some of it is rather nice, but when it’s all paired together, I swear. My goodness, is it dismal. Greys and navy blues.”
Harry stops himself. Draco raises soft eyebrows and possibly a corner of his mouth in question. Harry snorts, and all of it is broken to pieces, and something cracks inside of Harry’s chest like everything outside of him has gone right into place. It is an odd feeling, but not uncomfortable. Draco’s lips pull into the smallest smile. His cheeks are going pink. Harry watches as he laughs harder, deep in his belly, Draco’s hands as they twist on his desk and are then moved to his lap.
Draco moans, half from the pain of hearing him say it and half from his cock hardening against the sheets. He wants Harry so much, and it means it all to have him.
“Like, Seamus Finnegan. Gay, yes? But still so… like the rest of them. He wears jeans and sweaters from Malkin’s Muggle line, for Merlin’s sake. It’s all so
She pulls him into a hug of the same intensity she had served Harry, even kisses him on the cheek. Malfoy looks properly confused but also quite pleased. Harry swallows his giggle.
All of them together, somehow, is the most romantic part of it to Harry. For all of them to see him with Draco, and for it to be long enough past for them to take it in stride, how lucky he must be.
That night, after Malfoy has gone home to finish up just a spot of work, Harry floos Hermione before he can convince himself not to. She answers disheveled as usual, always in the middle of something. Harry envies her energy, always has.
for, and I am not exaggerating,” Malfoy says, and he is wearing a faint smile that seems to be the most genuine one Harry has ever seen. He wants to kiss Malfoy badly, then, and doesn’t know if it would be too much, too romantic, if he feels like he is a little bit in love with him.
In the morning, or later in the morning, Draco knows it is nearing four, Potter may laugh that giggle, the one that makes your own stomach seize with the sheer joy of it. Painfully contagious. Potter has discovered some kind of endless font of amusement in these troubled times. Maybe it has something to do with Fleur’s pregnant belly, or Molly’s dinners, everyone crammed tight at the long table. Draco feels it, too, sometimes. Just barely. When they are all together and he looks at someone just the right way. A big feeling, in his chest. Wide and growing. A fast feeling, a flash between his temples. That hot, determined recognition of love, or maybe just camaraderie, that brings his hands to twist together and his heart to race.
The next morning, Harry wakes at noon and Draco is nowhere to be found, but the bond is not unhappy so he knows that he is somewhere in the house. He finds him, groggy with too much sleep, on the loveseat reading the
Malfoy has a dual energy where he seems to be totally willing to write to Harry and be civil in conversation, but sometimes he will snap right back to his old ways. It isn’t an easy medium between the two but a hard boundary that gives Harry whiplash. It seems random and inconsiderate. Malfoy is driven by himself and himself only. Harry’s only comfort is in that Malfoy seems to want him, for how often he writes back.
He doesn’t know if he can imagine an end to it. He thinks about it in bed, with Potter snoring loudly across the room. When he is unable to sleep, he wonders if he’ll be dead tomorrow, or if they’ll win it, or if Potter will keep staring at him on cold evenings when all of it stops.
Harry nods. He’s growing numb, and he can’t believe that his look is not a hint for the healer to drop her grin. She continues with much of the same, though.
Draco ducks to avoid a low-hanging branch, and his chin ends up sharply on Harry’s shoulder. Harry can feel his fingers, then, digging around in Harry’s jacket pocket for his cigarettes. He grunts, lets Draco push a cig in his mouth and light it with a flick of his fingers. And then he is leaning into Harry to light his own against it. Harry huffs a big breath of air and Draco’s eyelashes flutter. He feels very young and carefree, all of a sudden. Like he’s in a world he had thought he would never have. Draco blushes fiercely. Harry laughs out smoke at him. His hand on Harry’s arm doesn’t move.
“It’s funny, when you think about it, how we ended up being the same kind of person,” Malfoy says, on a Sunday. They are sitting on the back porch, which had been the last thing for Harry to repair. He had stained it dark, like the wood of the big kitchen table. It is getting a little cooler than most Augusts, and September seems to be coming up quite fast.
“Who is intoxicated?” She asks. Harry rolls his eyes, coughs a bit on smoke and floo powder. “Ah. I see. To what do I owe the pleasure of this afternoon call?”
somewhere between the battle and when he had first seen her, interviewing. Four years ago. She needn’t have worried. Harry is here, isn’t he.
Harry nods. Draco takes another sip of tea. Harry had carried the cup—spelled so as not to spill—all the way down to the dungeons, from his own office.
Harry lets him go on, stuffing his nose into his neck and closing his eyes, drifting off to Draco’s soft berating monologue. It is never harsher than vague poetry, and the stream of his voice is more comforting than Ron and Hermione, or the voices of a Hogwarts feast, and the knowledge that he has found such a thing fills him with the heavy sands of sleep.
“So, put some rose petals on the bed for when he comes back, light some candles, you know, he seems like he would like that,” she says. Harry groans and tips his head back to stare up at the ceiling. “Harry.”
And with that, far too little information, in Harry’s opinion, they are released into the world with a mere handful of pamphlets.
Malfoy seems different, more on edge. Like he wants to scream at Harry, like he’s being forced to come. Harry can’t help the way his slight barbs make his chest burn from the inside out, like he is on fire. He wants to snap Malfoy’s neck, a little, and then he wants to fuck him again. And then again, he hates him, after Malfoy mentions his aunt like it’s nothing.
Eva disappears almost immediately, and comes back with a tray of gin and tonics with a charcuterie plate. She sits beside Harry on the low couch and hands him a drink.
Malfoy, of course, is in a brown lightweight and so, so tight turtleneck, with light colored massive wide leg pants, suede ankle boots. The waist of them is so tight it looks like it might pop. All of it is covered by a purple velvet robe, and topped off with a wide-brimmed black hat. He brings his lit cigarette inside from the front step.
“Obviously not,” he says, eyes flashing with something like delight. “Everyone else did, though. Terribly. Bemoaning your absence all through the decade, wishing you were here. Writing you and sending you gifts. Group photos for to send to Harry. You have a degree now, I suppose.”
“I’d thought,” he says. His sarcasm is absolutely noxious. Harry laughs at him again, strips off his boxers before he can say another word.
“‘S lovely,” Harry says. Draco takes his hands and brings them to his waist. Harry’s eyes are closed, and he breathes deep into Draco’s hair. He smells like smoke and a little of St. Mungo’s, but mostly of his cologne and his shampoo and leave-in conditioners. He smells like the house.
And now, two weeks later, Malfoy sits in the library with the kelley green shag rug and the Tiffany lamps keeping the space dim but not cold to read up on whatever horrible things the Blacks had deemed important. And Harry lets him. Wants him to. It’s all very confusing and quite a bit to consider.
“But we could be a power couple,” Harry says, grinning. “Come stay with me for the summer. Come on. Come here.”
“You don’t want your kids to be redheads, too, then?” He says it against Harry’s lips. Harry wishes he could say his dick flagged at the mention of any Weasley, but with Malfoy’s hands on it it seems impossible under any circumstance and Harry shakes his head in confusion. “Ginevra, I mean?”
With so many dead and dying, his old pit of gnarled fear inside of his stomach untangles into something that cushions embarrassment he would have felt not too long ago at saying so.
A failed mission, something at the Ministry with Umbridge and Potter is storming through the hall to a harried Draco, who waits for him despite all his rationale begging him to remain upstairs, to not be in the way when the next best course of action is always to debrief. His hands cup Draco’s cheeks and Draco’s mouth has already fallen open, his eyes bore into Draco’s. His nose is bleeding all down his neck.
“Mmm, yes, Harry, finally. Oh, I’ve waited—” Harry groans at Draco’s little comments, kisses him to shut him up and strokes him just three times before he comes.
The one night Malfoy leaves to go out with Pansy, Harry feels almost physically ill. His heart hurts, and his stomach is rolling in disappointment. He feels insane, almost, like there is an itch he cannot scratch, a mistake he made that only Malfoy in his bed can fix. Malfoy comes home early, saying he felt awful at dinner, like he would vomit up anything he put in his mouth, and he and Harry end up sharing his leftovers in bed. They fall asleep without fucking, with Malfoy’s arms around his head and Harry’s face where his heart is, trying to get as close as possible.
“I like you. I want you. I’m bonded to you, I mean,” Harry raises his brows meaningfully. Draco scoffs. “I like you. I-”
“Harry, Draco,” she greets them with a warm smile. Her drink has a crazy straw in it that spells her name. Harry assumes it’s a gift from Dean.
“Will you stay?” Harry asks, muffled. Malfoy nods. And it’s all the confirmation he ever needed. “Even if I am an eccentric?”
Harry eventually brings out the red metal patio chairs after they’ve dunked each other enough times to be waterlogged up to their ears, and they sprawl out on them naked in the hot sun. The muggy air is thick enough to hold in the palm of one’s hand, and Harry casts lazy sun protection charms all over himself and three times over Malfoy, he can’t help it. Malfoy’s stink eye is well-worth how hot his skin gets without Harry seeing any prospective burning happening. Malfoy looks so nice naked, all long and pale and stretchy. His body is so nice, and lovely, and to see him so naked all day in the sunshine feels like Harry is being let in on a holy secret, Malfoy’s body usually being draped in so many beautiful things, to be able to see him like this, insecure and warm. He keeps wrapping his hand around Malfoy’s ankles, bringing Malfoy’s feet up to his face to kiss the bottoms of them, and stroking behind Malfoy’s sharp knees.
Draco raises his eyebrows in question. Harry laughs again, shakes his head. He takes Draco’s hands in his and apparates them into his front hallway.
Malfoy’s lips are moving to his neck from his hairline, then, and Harry tears himself away to cross the room and pick some kind of something good out. He knows that Malfoy means the Stones, or something equally heavy, for his wine mouth and his mean streak. He’s in a mood Harry has never seen him in, in all his years of watching. Harry doesn’t want to cross him or encourage him, so he charms
“Wouldn’t be a good look on you either, you’re already so pale,” he says. He brings his free hand to Draco’s pink cheek. Which darkens redder. He marvels at how Draco warms under his touch.
“Oh Harry, it’s so lovely. How did I forget it? We didn’t really get around to visiting and checking up as much as I think you’d wanted us to, I just trusted that your charms would hold,” Hermione says, pulling away from him and looking all around, down the hall and up at the ceiling. “So lovely. And Draco, so lovely to see you, too.”
“We should stay away from each other. You aren’t good for me. I’ve done all of this to be- I’ve tried to be a better person,” Malfoy breathes. Harry leans to try and capture his lips. His eyes are falling closed, Malfoy’s face blurring behind his eyelashes. “I’ve tried to be good. You make me want-”
with me? I thought we were just fucking. You kept saying-” Malfoy cuts him off with a searing kiss, nasty and hard. Harry groans into him, presses his body up against him. Malfoy’s velvet robe cushions Harry’s bare chest. He pulls away, reaches behind to finally shut the door. “And,
“I do really like you, you know,” Harry says in a rare moment of feeling like he will die if he doesn’t say it. Malfoy blushes a bright red.
Malfoy is wearing the red clogs again, with denim culottes and a blue poet sleeve blouse tied in the middle of his torso. He has a silk scarf tied around his neck. Harry wants to touch all of his skin, what is visible and what is under those delicate vintage pieces. He can’t stop imagining pulling the ends of the little scarf to him, to bring him close up over the table and put his lips over Malfoy’s sweet nose.
Malfoy seemingly begrudgingly stays the next night, nights, days in between. He is in Harry’s space most of the time, and Harry really truly doesn’t mind it, not even when he interrupts Harry’s showers or insists on Harry’s absolute silence so he can finish just this last chapter. It is without a doubt dysfunctional. Malfoy is rude as ever. He berates Harry’s style choices and even goes so far as to comment on the décor, detailing
“Mm.” Draco smiled, remembering fondly. “I found the thestral cave. And you cast your new patronus.”
He doesn’t try honesty with Ron again that night, nor any night after. Instead, he gets as drunk as he can before letting Ron drag him home, collapsing on his bed, not even changing out of his clothes.
“I will sell Malfoy Manor as soon as it comes into my name.” Malfoy stated, still turned away from Harry.
“Draco.” Harry said, softly at first. But there was no response, his lips kissing further down his stomach now, his hands sliding toward the flimsy waistband of his bottoms.
Harry bit down a small laugh and finally looked at Draco. “I think I’m having a crisis.” He said finally, with a confused and pained look on his face.
He sighed, smiling to himself. His magic these days was immense, but not in the terrifying and unpredictable way it had been before - it was calm and placid and gentle, and responded to his needs without him having to do much thinking about it. When he had walked out this morning, the grey sky had cleared and the weak winter sun had shone through to the clearing where he wanted to practice. He had started to notice that he had a bit of an effect on the weather these days, the atmospheric charms he had learned so long ago crackling up from his fingertips without him actively thinking about them, the winter chill constantly buffered by a sense of warm and comfort that surrounded him.
“And you couldn’t get an erection for Ginny?” He asked, using his clinical voice while his insides writhed like snakes on fire.
It had taken longer than usual to calm down, he thought with a dull resignation. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the file below him. Lestrange. What a joy.
He came with a loud cry, his orgasm washing through him as if pulled by a lunar tide. He fucked up into his fist, riding the last of the receding waves until the sensation was almost overwhelming and his cock was nearly flaccid again. He lay there feeling elated with his breakthrough. Floating on a cloud. The shame that normally broke through his post orgasmic haze only danced on his periphery, unable to gain entry into the hallowed space he had cultivated during his explorations.
“That stuff is basically bulbadox powder with arrowroot, you know.” Draco said, sniffily, then grinning at Harry. Then, softer, “I’m glad you spoke to them. It will help. I’m sure it will help.”
“I’ve always felt drawn to go through the veil.” Harry’s voice came quietly through the dark. They were wrapped together in their duvet, a fire burning in the grate, Harry’s body like a furnace against him. Draco had finally showered upon returning home and picked the remaining detritus out of his hair before allowing Harry to pull him under the covers. He felt properly warm for the first time in days.
“It’s been too long,” a third voice sounded from directly behind Harry and Draco just inches from the barrier of their protective charms, making Draco nearly jump out of his skin in fright, “since we had that pretty girl near Hogsmeade. Too long! And I can smell something too.”
“And, you were technically master of the Elder Wand, for a while.” Harry said looking over at him, one eyebrow raised and a hint of a smile on his face.
Harry pulled an apple from his pocket, having saved one from the bowl on the breakfast table that morning, just after he’d wolfed down a sizeable helping of both eggs and bacon. He sunk his teeth in and savored in the sweet taste, sitting back on the damp earth of the path, leaning against the bed behind him. It was amazing how much he had neglected food, neglected eating, and even the simplest of flavors at their fastidiously routine mealtimes was more than just physically nourishing, it made him happy.
Through the whistling wind, he heard Voileami shrieking her eerie song, saw her shadow pass over them, Flea close behind. Draco was drawing in long, slow, steadying breaths as they walked, feeling suffocated by the salt in the air, by the metallic stench of dark magic and decay. He wished he were back in their cottage, so warm and cosseting, loving. There was no love here.
“Dirty git!” Draco yelled after him, pushing off hard and tearing through the stinging air after Harry.
Finally reaching the bottom on the letter and having not read a single hateful word, Draco dropped to the floor in sweet relief and laughed. Harry
Why was it always Potter when everything went tits up? Casting a quick but strong stasis charm on his limp and gasping body, Draco grabbed a tight hold on his arm, announced to the house that he needed the wards to let him out, and disapparated them both into Draco’s apartment.
Harry nodded, his foot lifting up and onto the first step, propelled by the moment of reprieve from his eddying thoughts.
Harry cringed internally at the thought. How could he ensure anonymity? What would a group meeting be like with the famous Harry Potter admitting he used narcotics to cope?
Draco watched as Harry waved his hand to cast his patronus. As Harry spoke to the silvery thestral, Draco walked back to the kettle to make more tea and a plan for food. It appeared they would be having company after all.
He held Draco firm against him while he spoke, as if trying to convey his surety. “I am completely enamoured with you, and it makes me… it makes me feel things that I never thought I would.” He was talking into Draco’s shoulder, voice slightly muffled by the material of his shirt.
Draco righted himself and turned to face Harry. The anxiety of the months prior leaving his body, a huge weight lifted from his shoulders. The sight of Harry’s kind eyes and warm smile and obvious pride in Draco’s work overwhelmed him, and in a moment of weakness he reached out and pulled Harry towards him, his hands around his waist and his face buried in his shoulder.
, it was brilliant. Fucking brilliant. It wasn’t flying, it was free falling, careening deep down into something soft and beautiful and lovely, like dropping into a bathtub full of honey. The golden liquid was being painted all over the raw parts of him, coating his very bones, dripping across all of the wounds he carried, knitting them back together, making him feel whole. It was sweet and sticky and Gods, he felt nourished. Like the empty parts of himself were filling with something pure and beautiful and golden, like he finally had sunlight within him, warming his soul.
Hermione agreed wholeheartedly, sniffling. “Gods, Ron has been obsessed with her pregnancy— the poor man. He’s been spending so much time with Greg— I swear if he could grow a uterus and birth babies himself he would do it in a heartbeat. He even offered to breastfeed Rose for me.” Hermione laughed thickly, blowing her nose.
“So, I tried to power through. Like I did with the honey. I grabbed a bunch of books and tried reading to distract me. I even tried wanking.” He blushed violently again, looking down at his hands, which were resting on the counter.
Harry let him nervously ramble a bit, bringing a hand up to push the hair out of his face and smooth down the back where he had slept on it funny. He let a thumb drag across his cheek as he spoke. Slow and soft and careful.
Due to the unusual name of the west London eatery, it became a hot spot for queer folk looking for a bite to eat during their pub crawls. It’s not that there was anything overtly
“Love.” He replied patiently. “His love for you and his desire to protect you was stronger than any dark magic I could have placed on him.”
“The thestrals! They led me through the forest down into this gorge and up a cliff face to their lair!” Draco was gesticulating wildly with excitement, but Harry just looked more and more concerned.
Draco sat and marvelled at what had just happened. The simple act nearly entirely eclipsed his reason for being in the forest in the first place. He would have to go read the stack of thestral books and test the blood he had collected, yet forgotten in the excitement of the unicorn sample he had collected, immediately.
Draco lifted his head and leaned back just far enough to press his shoulder into Harry’s side. “I finally got a letter back from the DoM.” He said, feeling elated with the response he had gotten. “And, I’m finally getting around to responding to letters from Christmas.”
Harry nodded. He wanted a bath. He wanted to scrub his skin clean of the smell of dark magic and regret, and shame. He needed out of this place - he had done what he had come to do, but it had taken a toll on him. He curled into himself and waited, too overwhelmed even to engage the little serpets on the taps of the bath, who were looking up at him expectantly.
“There you are.” Harry mused, picking up the crust Draco had thrown at him and eating it. “Was beginning to worry there for a minute.”
Harry sighed. “Of course you knew. Well, did you know I found a seed in that old cupboard in a bit of parchment labeled Wiggenweld? I had forgotten what it was until I came across it in one of the old potion books. I knew we used the bark in brewing healing potions, but I didn’t realize the actual trees were living, protective sentries.”
It was when his thoughts had focused on his companion that Harry felt the chill of the season settle on him, and he had roused himself to trek down the mountain. He spent far too much time these days reflecting on the feelings he might be having. The strange stirring within himself that Draco was becoming more than an enemy turned friend, more than a focus of his admiration, and much more akin to the epicenter of his world.
He loaded the largest dose he could. He knew he’d pass out once he hit it, and he didn’t want the moments of worrying or regret, of wondering if this was the right choice. It was. In this moment, he was sure.
Harry was so grateful for the contact. He instantly felt less raw, less needy, less panicked. Malfoy’s hand on his back was a gentle reminder that he was safe and nothing had changed, he was still in Tenebris Hollow, still sober and not in danger of running off to get drugs, he just had to get through this feeling and he would be okay, right?
Harry snorted in response, then his quiet voice broke through the clinking of tea cups and spoons, “Was that story real? Or did you just tell me that to get me out of the forest?”
He rekindled the fire and let the blast of heat penetrate his clothes as he stood too close, trying to shake the jittery feeling from his limbs and piece together what his dream had pulled from the depths of his memories. He boiled a kettle for tea and opened a packet of chocolate digestives and proceeded to silently eat the entire package.
The bartender laughed, and slipped him a coaster across the bar. “Try this. Go home, get yourself comfortable and get ready to feel like you’re flying.”
Hestia’s dark amber eyes met Harry’s gaze. “When he misses Colin, when he feels the world is forgetting him, he drowns it away. He used to say he’d get drunk enough to hear his voice again, to keep him close. To not forget.”
“Want some company?” Harry offered. He was so kind and open and fucking friendly. Insufferable, really.
Seeing him, Gods, touching him. It had taken all his willpower to control himself, the whole of the trial, sitting behind him, watching him be nothing but powerful and confident and gloriously unashamed. Watching him revel in the ardent support and nearly fanatical admiration of those he had always feared had turned on him.
“Hello there.” He smiled, marveling at how serene she seemed to be mostly naked before him, in labour.
Harry opened his mouth again to speak, then shut it, still uncertain of how to start. He looked down at his hands and rubbed the callouses there, biding his time.
“Feel your magic.” He said. “I know you can feel mine, now show me what yours is like. Describe it to me. Make me feel it.”
“It’s ok little one, I’ve got you now.” He crooned softly as he hurried back down the path. He was already running through a mental checklist of what Hagrid would do. Step one, reignite the fire that had burnt low during the night, step two let the little guy warm up on his own a bit and get some kind of split on the wing that he’d reset. Harry silently hoped episkey would be good enough, as he didn’t know any more specific healing spells for animals. Step three, convince Draco this wasn’t a terrible idea and the cabin could fit one more just fine, that it’d be good for them, for Harry, to have some company. Step four, food. He’d have to write the house elves for raw chicken and owl treats as soon as he got back.
He hadn’t noticed Juniper leave him to his rumination, or noticed that she had measured out the precise amount of pearl dust for him, leaving it neatly beside his cauldron.
Harry, in his interminable calm, wrapped his arm over her shoulder and gave her a squeeze, an intimate and familiar gesture. “Let’s go make some tea, yeah?”
His heart stuttered in his chest and he felt a familiar snaking tingling run up his sides, up his spine and across his shoulders. It was like a breathy shiver of ice, pulling his insides this way and that, squirming uncomfortably.
Or, perhaps it was someone who didn’t appreciate a Death Eater opening up shop in a quiet town full of innocent people. He ran through a mental list of people that would want to snoop around his practice in the dead of night, as he heard more distinct shuffling of feet.
Behind Harry, the thestral opened his massive wings, and dropped slowly onto its heavy forelimbs, gingerly laying down, its side tucked up against Harry’s back, scooping him up beneath one of his massive wings as he refolded them to his sides, drawing Harry close.
“I think, Healer Malfoy, it’s time for you to come in for some questioning.” Said the taller one, eyeing Draco with amusement. Draco felt the low thrum of dread he’d been experiencing, mount to a crescendo.
Okay, he thought, so far so good, but this is not King’s Cross Station. Harry rubbed his eyes and noticed the tension he suddenly felt, the ache of his muscles, his bones, his very being suddenly came rushing into his awareness. Surely the dead don’t feel pain, do they? Harry’s heart sped up a bit at the thought - was he cursed to spend the rest of eternity in pain rather? He shook his head and dismissed the thought. Don’t panic. Not yet, anyway.
He walked to the arched doorway to the kitchen and saw Harry and Greg fused together in a tight hug, rocking slightly on the spot. He stopped short at the endearing sight, not wanting to interrupt them and leaned against the wall in the shadows. He could hear Greg mumbling something into Harry’s shoulder, his face hidden. He could see Harry nodding and whispering back.
“No, really—“ Harry continued, reaching out and taking Draco’s hand. “I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. There’s a lot of societal pressure— I mean— even in the literature that we read—” Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco, clearly thinking of Herbert and Gable, and Draco snorted a reluctant laugh. “Well, I just don’t think it’s a necessary part of— of—” He was moving his hand in a circular motion by his face, casting about for the right words.
Draco took Harry’s proffered hand and allowed himself to be hoisted up. Draco lit his wand and Harry summoned a bright blue bell flame in his hand and they began to march towards the dark abyss of the cave.
He was afraid that when they left the forest, Harry would get tired of waiting for Draco to be ready for him. And Draco wasn’t ready. He wasn’t ready to reopen himself in that way, even if it was with Harry. But if he didn’t, would Harry leave? Would he realize there were easier ways to get off than sitting around waiting for Draco to unpack the rest of his baggage? Draco wanted Harry, he really did, and perhaps that’s all it would take to push himself through the discomfort and just give Harry what he wanted.
“No, father, Pansy married Blaise.” He said shortly. His father faltered a little at the interruption.
He’d barely had time to do anything other than cram information into his brain and try to diligently distance himself from his past indiscretions in the war.
Draco sat on the bed and reached for Harry who tried to disentangle himself from the dark duvet saying, “You’re right, we’re going to be late—” A little too loudly.
Little Dipper hooted in understanding as Draco took a moment to stroke the soft feathers of his head. “Go on, then, you little menace.” He encouraged fondly.
Since apparating to her disturbingly charming garden, he nearly disapparated away twice in panic. This was new and uncomfortable territory. He hadn’t made a new friend since Unice— not that Luna was new, but her company was. The path to her front door was overrun with beautiful sprawling plants. Nasturtiums, violas, lavender, daisies, and creeping thyme tumbled over one another in bundles of fragrant bursts of colour. Big fat bumblebees meandered pleasantly from blossom to blossom and clouds of butterflies erupted in front of him as he walked.
He was washed in warm relief as the wards shimmered and the lock clicked, the door swinging open to him. The thestrals shook their heads, silken manes the last to ripple with the house’s magic before the door swung shut behind him and all went still again. Harry stood, motionless in the familiar entry hall, taking deep breaths, willing himself to remain calm. To not think of the last time. Of the days before they started camping, the days before the heaviness of the horcrux they carried. It had been hard even then, in the terrible old house. It had been filled with uncertainty, of fear.
Ron sighed sadly. “We found about a dozen people down there. One young as maybe six— oldest at about, we guess, late 70’s. All of them had their memory wiped. They don’t know a thing. No idea why they were there or what happened to them.”
The sky outside was turning pink, and out the large kitchen windows Draco could see Flea and Voileami, each with one end of a large stick in their mouths, each tugging trying to gain ownership of it. He turned to tell Harry, to get his attention, when it happened.
He sighed and dropped his head on the table, feeling a little overwhelmed and a bit lost. His inner boggart dancing to a familiar tune.
Draco was feeling jittery and nervous and he allowed a sympathetic Harry to take the heavy paella pan from his sweaty hands and place it gently at the centre of the table. He decided to rather summon the salad than risk carrying it.
He pushes in and lets out a sob of exhaustion, his letter to Hermione fluttering from his hand as it drops next to the mattress, his eyes roll back in his head and he gently slips away, laying back against the ratty, stained pillow. The house falls silent.
“Ah, but have you?” Dumbledore countered. When neither of them responded, he continued. “Twice, now, you’ve brought memorials to this school to honour those we’ve lost. You comfort those who grieve. Offer solace to those who are lost. You, Mr. Malfoy, you heal those who need it. Save those who can be saved. And both of you, have formed strong bonds with your thestral shadows, have you not? From what I hear, they seldom leave your side.”
Draco didn’t know much time had passed. Their patronuses circled the pool lazily as they stood transfixed, mouths ajar. Voileami was idling by Draco’s side, occasionally stamping her foot, when Flea re emerged from beyond the veil.
“I can’t tell you.” Draco said sadly. “Really, thank you all for your support and concern, but I’m not ready to divulge the details of my last year. I’m still processing it for myself.”
“No, I don’t want an audience.” She laughed softly, pointing her wand at Harry and casting a silent spell to clear his throat. “I’m not asking you to come into the room— just to be here when it happens. Be the first to meet them.”
Harry, still coughing, stood and pounded a fist to his chest to dislodge the errant crumb that was attempting to kill him.
He would fix this. He would show Draco he could be the man who didn’t break. Who didn’t run. Who didn’t need Draco to fix him. He would take the lesson of this year and know that it was possible. What they have together was possible. And he’d just have to show Draco he could carve out space for it in the outside world. A world where Harry could forgive Draco for being so scared. A world where Harry still wanted him, still wanted to go slowly.
The token was a plastic coin-like medallion, painted bronze with a large triangle in the centre and the number one printed in the middle. On the edges of the triangle read the words
Draco just looked at him feeling overwhelmed again, but not in a bad way. He didn’t know how words worked anymore.
His office was small but not uncomfortably so. It was cosseting. His department too, was small as he was the only double specialist there making it Draco’s very own tiny fiefdom. He had spent many nights sleeping on his little beige couch or pouring over research behind his little oak desk.
“I’ve been thinking—” Draco repeated, still softly, not really sure how to articulate his whirring thoughts.
He had realised, with frightening, blinding clarity, that night, as he stared at the ceiling and felt Harry’s warm body, asleep against him, that he felt the same way. He had told Luna all those months ago that he loved Harry, but he didn’t think he even really knew what that meant back then. He had thought the words, sometimes, in the depths of night with Harry wrapped around him— or, in the quiet moments sharing tea on the sofa— or, in the thrill of sparring words and diatribes over what sheets to put on the bed. He had been thinking it for weeks— months, now. But, how does he tell Harry?
One moment he’s pining over Harry, the next he’s being led by thestrals into a deep gorge in the forest where no one would be able to find him. Good planning, he thought. Really top shelf work.
Draco hadn’t noticed he had been holding his breath, frozen by the implications. The dread of what magic had been spilled into the very earth.
At the end of the quaint side lane that housed the practice, Harry turned and made his way up the central high street of the village. The sun was high in the sky and he let its warmth wash across his skin, a magic of its own, soft but powerful.
The barman raised his eyebrow. “I gave you enough to kill someone - how you’re still standing is a bit of a mystery at the moment. How do you have any places left to hit?”
He knows what he’s going to tell them this first lesson. This first meeting is going to be about the importance of friendship. Of having people to lean on, to rely on, to reach out to when you’re in the dark. When you’re worried you’re alone. When you can feel the dread come rushing down upon you. When you stop feeling like you can breathe.
“He hurts people, Ron. He’s still hurting people.” Harry said this part softer. His mind was full of the scars on Draco’s hips and down his stomach. Of his fear. Of his nightmares, where invisible hands closed around his neck. As he begged to be released. Gasping.
Harry sometimes wondered if he had helped push Ginny to this sexually extravagant lifestyle. The one and only time they had gotten the courage up to strip down and make an honest attempt at vaginal intercourse, Harry had struggled to get hard. It was in the weeks after Voldemort’s defeat, and while everyone was celebrating and decrying the return to a free and fair wizarding world, he couldn’t shake the prickling notion that there was so much left to be afraid of, so much left to fight. He may have mastered the art of appearances, but his cock was inclined to lie.
Lestrange’s freedom was fetid and heavy, like something since deceased, but foul and putrid, more so with each day that passed. Like carrion. The weight of it was dripping with the things that kept him up at night, that stopped him from engaging with his own sense of self and pleasure, too distracted by the rivulets of rotten offal and shame. How could he lose himself to the throws of passion with himself or another when he could always feel the pressure of that corpse dangling from his frame?
Draco considered protesting for a fleeting moment, feeling nettled, but he heard the bite of pragmatism in her voice and remembered that he had been acting like a lost child for days, and knew better than to argue. He nodded and allowed Luna to pull him up off the couch and towards the bathroom.
Draco had felt as if he had been electrocuted, swiftly followed by an all-consuming full body numbness, reading those words. That was not what he had expected. He couldn’t believe these words had been sitting in his pocket for three weeks. He felt like a fucking idiot.

“I’m just having a hard time believing that you’re not seeing someone. You just look too… pleased with yourself.”
Harry didn’t say anything and Draco couldn’t decide if he was relieved for the space or desperate for Harry to break the silence.
“Like how and why they keep healing me when I’m injured.” Draco said. “Come Potter, let’s get back, I’m starving.”
“I know Malfoy, you like a quarter cup of milk and a single spoon of honey. I was kidding before, I know you like tea. I’ve watched you make it for years across the great hall.” Harry was still smiling, pulling the silver jar full of honey toward himself.
” Said Harry, closing his eyes and picturing the day he had been so intent on dying. So resigned. Trapped. “
Had Harry really said it? Had he meant it? Or had Draco been hallucinating? If he had said it, should Draco have said it back? Was Harry mad that he hadn’t reciprocated? Had he only said it because they had taken things to the next level in the bedroom?
Between the spluttered latin phrases, Draco saw a nod of understanding, a moment of peace, and he began following Mr. Deklerk’s latin with his own intonations, pushing back against the onslaught of dark magic. He would have to send the broach to the DMLE in a lead box— whoever had cursed it had hoped for death.
They only want him there because, let’s be clear, Harry is a fun drunk. He’s funny and charming and is the first to come up with cheers or jeers, bar games and silly pickup lines. Externally, Harry is the picture of a fun work mate, a good time guy, and Gods, they love him for it.
He needed a cup of water, but he was afraid of getting up from his corner cubicle, where at least his co-workers couldn’t watch him fidgeting and sweating like a suspect cornered in interrogation. Gods, what they must think of him.
He stretched his legs from beneath him and stood, the thestral reaching out his giant wings away and above Harry’s form, also slipping it’s forelegs out into the snow and gingerly raising it’s skeletal form, the great slopes of his hip bones and knobs of each vertebra sliding below his coal colored skin. With one last forlorn look at Harry, the glassy eyes impassive as always, the thestral snorted softly and started off to the North, picking it’s way through the unmarked snow.
“Where’s Harry?” He asked the thestrals, realizing one of them was Voileami. They turned slowly and began walking towards him.
Draco was listening to the orchestra of bird song in the forest mingling with the sound of a gentle breeze playing in the field flowers around them. It was a perfectly gorgeous day, and he felt gloriously content, lying there having lazy conversation with Harry.
The next morning Little Dipper came swooping in the window with a letter from Hermione and a copy of the Daily Prophet. He crashed spectacularly into the tray of waffles, knocking over Harry’s tea and taking advantage of the general chaos to snap a piece of bacon.
“Yeah.” He breathed out. “Maybe.” He had saved one of those early drafts. His preliminary notes— in the cabin. Stuffed in the hidden stone cubby with
“Well don’t thank us just yet Auror Weasley, we’ve still got no clue what’s going on here – he doesn’t seem to be reacting to any of the curses from the raid and so far we couldn’t find anything other than him being a bit dehydrated – we’ve found no magical contaminant in his blood, and we’ve just hydrated him and given him a calming draught.”
“Mixed. French and English, too,” he says. Malfoy’s long fingers circle his wrist and take his hand. He hums.
Harry likes to put his thumb right in the middle of Malfoy’s pink lips, his fingerprint at the part of his upper lip where it is more flat and long. Malfoy always opens his lips beneath it, but maybe someday he will sit still long enough for Harry to be able to trace his whole face. His roman nose, flushed pink with hot water, his sharp jaw, his arched cheekbones.
“I am most certainly not,” he says. Harry giggles, falls forwards into his neck, both hands on velvet lapels.
“And you seem to have quite a style about yourself as well, don’t you? I must say, darling Draco is so mysterious, I had no idea he had a
Eventually, Harry can pull his hair up into a bun at the back of his head. It makes Draco look at him quizzically, almost like something, on a Friday, but then Harry leaves for a weekend with Teddy, and on Monday it seems to all be forgotten.
“I like that you know about this stuff,” Harry says. Draco breathes an assent through his nose. “It’s nice. I like when you teach me.”
“New glasses,” Malfoy states, gently placing Harry’s joint back between his fingers. He makes a belated gesture to Harry’s face.
That is, until he runs into Malfoy, wasted at one of Luna’s spring parties. His first back. Harry is twisted,
“Well, Potter.” Harry waits for more, but Draco is still prodding at his skin. Goosebumps break out over Harry’s forearms, and Draco looks down at his face. “Fascinating.”
“Why are you like this, Potter.” Malfoy crosses his arms. His sleeves are tight around his delicate wrists. He looks bad in purple, but also quite good, Harry can’t decide. He is just so pale. “I can’t give you what you want. What makes you think we’ll ever be different than we were before you left and came back all free-love and such? What in Merlin’s left nut are you thinking we’ll gain from each other?”
“Well, let me just get the diagnostics running, and we’ll see what’s manifested between the two of you! I’m not getting any hints of Dark magic at this point, from the preliminary runs. Does it feel foreign to either of you, like someone else's' magic you don’t recognize?”
“Harry! I feel like we haven’t spoken in forever, what are you up to? Want to come through? It’s just me, Ron is out with Arthur for dinner.”
“You’ve got freckles,” Malfoy says. Harry nods dumbly, again. He looks through his lashes up at him, and apparently that is all it takes for Malfoy to kiss him, up pressed against the sink, lips hot and exploratory, half down Harry’s stubbled chin, joint left forgotten in a bowl on the countertop. Harry’s fingers go to Malfoy’s warm waist, twist in his thick cotton t-shirt, pull up until they are touching bare skin.
They get hard and ignore it, even though Harry wants to put Malfoy’s dick in his mouth he won’t, he wants to see what Malfoy wants to do first, or he’s a little nervous by how much Malfoy seems to be opening up to him, or something. It’s a little romantic, though, to be half hard lying beside each other and just talking, looking at each other. So much so that Harry is glad for the sunshine and how it is concealing his embarrassed flush.
Malfoy does come for dinner that night, his pink robes folding naturally into the front hall closet amongst all of Harry’s jackets and robes, like they belong there. He’s brought buttercups in a hot pink vase. He insists he has no clue as to their intended meaning but thought Harry would like the pink and yellow. And Harry kisses him hard on the mouth right there in the front hall, the vase tipping in Malfoy’s hands and dripping water onto both of their feet.
Draco is looking at Harry so earnestly that he trails off into nothing. He shrugs helplessly. Draco sighs.
Harry is fuzzy and horny, warm from the inside out and feverish with a kind of lazy need. He clutches Malfoy’s hair, strokes up his back, drowns in the sounds he makes in Harry’s mouth. Everything is slow and heavy. His heart is pounding, and he thinks that he can feel Malfoy’s heartbeat, too.
Harry grunts and grips Malfoy’s arse to settle him down on his lap more, unbuttons his impossibly tight pants and pulls his dick out, so familiar to him by now, and Malfoy is sweating down his forehead where it is pressed to Harry’s so sweetly, and when he comes his pupils are so blown out Harry wants to weep.
“I like you so much. I didn’t know that about you, today,” he says. Malfoy rolls his eyes, looks grateful for the subject change.
leather jacket, and how romantic must Harry be to want him inside of something so precious. How in love. He sees it in his eyes when Harry laughs at him dancing.
His hair is growing out a bit at the top, but he has kept the sides short to his head. He sits grading on the couch as Harry takes his desk, some nights. Draco pours Harry shots of Firewhiskey at the small bar in his office, hands them to him with a look. Harry gives him the look right back.
He is among the blue when he knows, instinctively, that Draco is flying up to him. Harry hovers in waiting. His heart pounding in his fingertips.
“I’ll have to come and see them sometime! Watch the drink,” George says. He smacks a kiss on both of their cheeks, and waltzes off to Angelina and Luna on the dance floor.
They dance for hours, with Ginny and Luna and then, when they are really drunk, with Pansy and Percy, who have somehow formed an alliance Harry believes to possibly be more about leverage at the Ministry than Percy likely thinks. Draco does not stop touching Harry the entire time, always a finger looped in his, never allowing him to be taken by another partner. Hermione puts on Puccini, this time, to make Draco laugh, but it just makes Harry’s eyes fill and Draco smacks him gently on the shoulder.
The kids love Draco, despite being terrified of him. Harry loves to watch them give their two professors a wide berth when they make their way to the Three Broomsticks on Hogsmeade weekends. Harry wears Doc Martens boots Hermione had gifted him for Christmas five years ago in the snow, never minding how little they really do to warm his toes. Draco wears all of the same. Pointed leather shoes charmed to repel the cold. But stares at Harry’s feet, too.
“You are. But not for me,” he says. Harry pouts, looks up at him through his eyelashes. “Potter, I am serious. Deadly serious. You’re ridiculous and I despise you. And your hair, and your arms, and such. You’re entirely too much. You’re an eccentric. I simply cannot be with you.”
“Come back,” he says as Malfoy attempts to escape him to the hallway. “What’s wrong with you? Besides the obvious, that is. Can you, like, support me? We’re going to have to figure this out together, or else I’ll call Hermione, or someone, I need to talk about it or I’ll scream, Malfoy.”
Not out loud, but in his most private thoughts, in the shower in his rooms or when he and Draco are making their way to the quidditch pitch to sit in the stands and snack on crackers and cheese. He thinks,
“Natural soul bond?” He asks. The healer is already turned to the desk, scribbling on her sheets of parchment. “What-”
And now, the sanctuary with Potter in the early morning hours. The radio is crackling on a Muggle station in the corner, so quietly Draco knows they will forget to turn it off when they finally creep up to bed.
“Orgasms? I like to fuck you,” Harry says. Malfoy scoffs, that piece of hair falls between his eyes. He squints over at Harry from the counter. “But seriously. I like you. And I hate you, a little. But can we stop pretending we’re sixteen? I’m trying to put all that behind me… being as you’re here, and all…”
“Right. Good, because I want you there,” Harry says. Malfoy scoffs, rolls his eyes all the way back.
Draco looks up at him from behind long, blond lashes. His eyes are grey-er. Maybe. Harry sniffs, and Draco mirrors him, cautiously lifting the tea to his pink lips, blowing, and sipping. Slowly. Harry doesn’t dare break the eye contact. Draco has more of a jaw. His hair is braided down his back.
“The- Merlin, Potter, don’t- get my dick back in your mouth, I’ll tour your fucking house later you arse.”
, he thinks now. But Draco is still pleasantly flushed, looking down almost shy at his desk. Harry flexes his fingers.
“It’s not nothing, you know it’s not nothing. I’m fucking begging you to talk to me, Malfoy,” Harry hates the desperation in his own voice. He grips the back of the couch.
He drags Harry to the big bathroom on the third floor, the one they share with Weasley and Granger and Ginny and Luna and Neville, all the
In the morning light, when he wakes up to read the letter again against his better judgement, he finds it easier to send off a casual response, reminding Malfoy that he can come to look at those shirts whenever he feels so inclined.
“We’ve been sleeping for a day, we have to eat. Decorum be damned,” Harry says. Draco puts all ten fingers in his hair, scratches his scalp, tilts his head back so that he can kiss his forehead. He runs fingers down Harry’s neck, sticks his joint in Harry’s mouth.
Draco locks the door as Harry drops his jacket and scarf on the floor. For a flash of a second, he can hear Sirius laughing at him and the predicament he’s found himself in—
Malfoy, once they are back at Grimmauld Place, shows Harry the empty bedroom on the second floor where he has been leaving a bit of his closet every day so that it is easier to be Harry’s “live-in fuck buddy,” as he calls it.
“But Malfoy. Hey,” Harry is watching him as he dithers at the coffee machine. He is still wearing his wide-brimmed hat. “Come here.”
Harry shifts, coughs. Draco blinks, and then gestures, silently, one flat, long, white hand to the chair across from him. The desk between them. Harry sits. He thinks about, well, a dark corridor, sixteen, Draco’s muffled insistence. He thinks,
, Potter, and I’m saying you do as well, so you’d do well to take the compliment. I’m not one to just hand them out.”
George comes up to Harry and Draco immediately, firewhiskey in hand, and claps Draco hard on the shoulder. It seems unforgiving, Draco winces and Harry chokes down a laugh.
“It’s from a cousin,” Draco says airily, and offers no more. Harry frowns, but lets it be. All these fashion secrets. He can’t stop looking at the flush on Draco’s cheeks. “We look good.”
“You are…” Harry starts. Comes back up to kiss Draco at the back of his neck, to whisper in his ear. “Everything I’ve ever wanted.”
And then Malfoy leaves their sex-den psychedelic dreamworld to visit so-and-so who-knows-where, and Harry writes him to come back after he’s only been gone the one day.
“He will.” Harry looks to Draco in shock. “What? You think Minerva hasn’t already talked about it with me? I know all about this disaster waiting to happen.”
“Well!” The healer says. She waves her wand and the diagnostic spell disappears. “You’ve got a perfectly healthy, natural soul bond here.”
“Mmm. You know what they say about assuming, Potter.” Harry takes Malfoy’s outstretched elbow and is immediately apparated away.
Harry shakes his head, but Malfoy cuts him off with an open-mouthed kiss. He bites down on Harry’s bottom lip, making him groan, and then pulls back, puts both of his hands in Harry’s hair to push his head back and expose his throat.
Harry has taken to wearing Sirius’ leather jacket over his sweaters and scarves, has grown his beard and hair out a bit with the oncoming winter. He sees Draco’s sweeping looks over him, he sees those grey eyes fixating on his chin.
Malfoy starts laughing too, and pulls Harry up to kiss him. He pulls away and his eyes look frantic, scanning Harry’s face, like if he blinks he’ll forget it. Harry kisses him again.
“I should be able to touch my own skin without you sending yourself into hysterics, Potter. And self-flagellating hysterics, at that. Come on,” Draco coughs. Potter raises his head, tucks his hair behind his ear, then laughs a single sharp note. Draco rolls his eyes.
They finally venture out to a club to dance on the eighth day, get much too drunk and stumble home much too early, and Harry ends up getting Malfoy to sit in the parlor with him late into the night with the sound system and all of Harry’s vinyl. Malfoy knows more Muggle music than Harry would have ever expected him to, more than Harry knows himself. He wants to ask why, but neither of them ask many questions beyond surface level, seeming to both of them understand that all this is is fucking, and enjoying non-judgement for as long as they can. It’s pure decadence, and Malfoy has an air about him that he is always wasted, or is merely floating through the world in his own head, where he is gracing everyone with his presence. And shockingly, Harry finds it hot. It goes quite well with his well-crafted presence, his whispering, and his perfectly fucked up hair, his necklaces and rings.
“No! It’s okay. Listen—listen to me. I thought one for Sirius, and then one for Teddy, because he asked me to, and then. It’s like I blinked, and now I’m full of them.”
A wave of nausea, because Draco has cut his hair and suddenly Harry is at Malfoy Manor, and he reaches for something, anything, but finds nothing. He is vomiting on the floor on his hurried way out the door, and Draco’s fingers are on his shoulder but Harry pushes him away, with all the force of his strength and magic, too.
And as Harry sits patiently, listening to the two of them fawn over the academic aspect of Harry’s recent dramatic life-changing event, he realizes that this may just be his new reality, until the day he dies. And he doesn’t hate it.
“I have all the necessary literature here for you both. No need to do anything differently than you are now, the bond is new and will strengthen with time. I would say that you do need to remain near each other for the time being, anywhere from three weeks to two months abouts while the bond calibrates itself. I do assume that you have already been in close quarters though, for the bond to form. Living together?”
“He wears strappy clogs,” Harry groans. It sends Hermione off again, laughing and going back to the dishes as Harry downs his beer despondently. “I feel like he hates me.”
One evening, on the walk back from Hogsmeade, Draco slips his hand into the crook of Harry’s elbow, and Harry lifts his forearm to support it without thinking. The trees around them are groaning with recent snowfall, and the shrieks and laughter of the students behind them has Harry’s stomach warm.
“I am so not,” Harry mumbles. But Malfoy’s hands in his hair are getting him hard, as anyone’s hands would. Harry swears it to himself. His scalp is just sensitive. And if Malfoy gets him on his knees in front of the loveseat in a matter of seconds later with just his fingers showing Harry the way down, down, down, it’s just because he likes to be touched. Harry is a stupid girl, on his knees with his hands on Malfoy’s strong, wiry thighs and his lips kissing Draco’s dick through his underwear. He always wears what look like antique high-waisted panties. Harry can’t get enough of it, the creamy lace against his cut hips. Harry worries that his pants might rip- Sirius’ orange bell bottoms, groaning beneath his knees on the floor.
“Yes, I do think so,” Draco says. Harry is a little drunk and much too comfortable on the fainting couch, wrapped in a knit blanket. Draco is playing Walburga’s collection of opera on the gramophone. “Harry, what do you think?”
And then Harry’s fingers are pulling down his trousers and his pants and he’s biting the dimples above Draco’s arse and Draco sobs, involuntarily, but he isn’t ashamed or surprised by himself. He just
“Here we sit,” Malfoy says. Harry snorts, and waits. He knows more is coming, is so used to Malfoy’s casual theatrics by now. He watches Malfoy’s long fingers smooth over the wrinkle in the middle of the folded spine of the paper. “I mean, they’re all… the same. And we’re so different.”
“Lovely. Just lovely, really, everything’s going well at work and I’m quite busy but you know, aren’t I always,” she says.
There is something hot and wet on Harry’s cheekbone. Draco chokes a sob, and Harry cannot help himself from taking him up tighter in his arms. He smells like fresh air, and fear, and his fingers digging into Harry’s neck are reminiscent of the time he had Harry jokingly waltzing to Sonic Youth.
He nearly trips over himself making his way to the front door, opens it panting and hanging off of the doorframe like an idiot. Malfoy looks him up and down, judgemental as ever. Harry follows his eyes and is reminded he is only wearing his blue linen button-up, open, with his striped pajama boxers.
Draco is very impatient with the whole thing, kissing at Harry’s adam’s apple and pinching his sides, so much so that he rips his fly down and clasps his hand around Harry’s to yank his underwear down and put his fingers to his hot cock.
Malfoy laughs, barely above a whisper. He steps towards Harry, in his hat and his little pink shirt. His elbows are sharp and fantastic. Harry reaches out to touch one.
It’s on a late night beside the roaring fireplace in the living room that they plan their wedding party- of sorts. Harry doesn’t know what to call it but that, and every time he does Draco’s nose scrunches in distaste. So Harry pours him white wine, and tasks him with writing invitations in his signature green ink while he goes through the list of must-haves Draco had been compiling since they’d thought of the whole thing. He absolutely vetoes peacocks and ice sculptures but is more willing to bend on some of the other still quite fanciful decor wishes.
The first night Malfoy had come home with him, from Luna’s party, he had stood open-mouthed at the entryway, and the living room where Harry had poured him whiskey, and then up the stairs with the orange shag carpet and then to Harry’s room, the former master, which Luna had insisted he allow her to paint. She had done a room-wide mural, the walls swept in plants and suns and moons, the ceiling covered in constellations. Sirius was up there, as was Draco. Harry hadn’t commented on it at the time, as he had assumed Luna did not know that he knew.
They fall asleep there, and when Harry wakes in the morning, Malfoy is puttering about in his tiny kitchen with the coffeemaker, humming as he makes omelettes for the two of them, and Harry feels himself falling deeper and deeper down. Far beyond the point of no return, to a place where Malfoy’s straight back and thoughtful manner have him stuck here on this couch until Malfoy himself tells him he has to leave. He can feel it in his chest, like a string connecting them there, tied in little bows around their hearts. Malfoy is right- he can’t move for being corny.
“Thank you, ‘Mione,” Harry says gratefully. The bell rings, then, and Harry turns quickly to let Luna and Pansy in.
Harry feels suddenly as if he would like to faint. Malfoy gives a strange whimper beside him. Harry can’t look at him.
On the one-thousand, nine hundred and seventeenth night of Draco’s stay in Grimmauld place, it is nearing Christmastime. There is a pervasive ache in his ribs from a stunner meant for Potter. He and Granger had spent the day lying on the couches in the library, reading Muggle romance novels. And now he sits quietly, watching Potter’s fingers flick a red flame, in the blue-dark of the big house.
Everyone comes fairly on-time, dressed in what Draco had written as being a Studio 54 theme. They all look lovely, and high, and Harry’s lips are soon sore from kissing everyone hello. He gets drunk in the welcome line, with everyone passing him one champagne flute after another, Draco by his side so warm and lovely, charming and on his best party behavior.
fucked, and sipping from his fourth mug of dandelion wine when through his personal cloud of smoke surrounding his designated beat-up old armchair, he spots that fucking head of blond hair. It’s-
By the time dinner and drinks are served out in the garden, it is pouring rain and freezing. But Draco’s charms on the tent hold, and it is warm and golden inside. Harry and Draco sit beside each other at the head of the table, with everyone around them watching and laughing and talking amongst each other, Narcissa and Molly having gotten over things some time ago, a fascinating development Harry was not privy to, Arthur drunk and asking Hermione stupid questions about dentistry, Pansy and Ginny doing shots all through the night with Percy, somehow, and Blaise and Charlie sitting close enough that Draco keeps sending them a suspicious eye. Teddy sits yawning beside Victoire until Andromeda finally pats his shoulder and announces that it is much too far past the children’s bedtime, bringing them both home despite their insistence otherwise.
By the time October comes, chilly and pouring rain as usual, Draco has grown his hair into a cropped bob, just at his jawline, and Harry has to wait for him to moisturize it far longer whenever he washes it. Sometimes he still slicks it back and Harry spends a lot of time looking at the shiny hair on the back of his neck. He likes to watch it disappearing beneath a heavy cashmere scarf or a bright red turtleneck that shouldn’t look good on him but does.
like he was made to taunt Harry with it, and isn’t it a turn from them laughing in Luna’s garden except that then Harry is laughing anyways again, into Malfoy’s lap.
He whispers it to Draco, lips nearly brushing his ear, at the table in the Great Hall. He ignores McGonagall’s eyes. He is starving from not eating lunch, from lifting his bookshelf and repairing it and re-stacking everything. He could feel Draco’s magic against the side of it, warm and now-familiar. Like when he would hold Draco’s wand.
Malfoy stays for one night, Harry remembers, and then he’s out on Monday mornings buying groceries and smoking cigarettes in the back garden two months later, writing in his leather-bound notebook with Muggle pens.
He writes him about Egypt, and his friends there, and what his classes were like. He asks unashamedly what Malfoy’s NEWTS were in, and when he finished his Potions Mastery. He asks about Hogwarts, and if he likes teaching, and then he thinks better of all of it and burns the letter right then and there.
“Harry.” Draco speaks his name, voice cracking on the second syllable, into the pillow. The smell of Harry’s hair chokes him, male and deep and good. He found one of Harry’s long curls on the shoulder of his coat the other day. Harry’s fingers dig into his hips. “Hurry.”
He’s whispering in Harry’s ear. Harry turns and his lips are met by Malfoy’s, hot and wide open. Malfoy licks the corner of his mouth. The door is wide open to the street, yet no one can see them. Harry groans out loud against Malfoy’s soft mouth, reaches back to pull his hips against Harry’s arse. He’s hard, and Harry fights the urge to drop deadweight to the floor and take Malfoy with him.
“It’s Harry,” he says. Draco closes his eyes. His long, pale lashes glint softly. “Do you want another cigarette?”
“You know, smoking will kill you. It’s a filthy Muggle habit,” Draco says matter-of-factly. “I’m not saying I
Draco studies him. His face is clear of past emotion, Harry feels a gratitude for him that catches him off guard. Erases his almost-tears.
He had blown his Order of Merlin cash on furniture, antique to vintage mid-century modern and everything in-between. He had spent three straight weeks painting and putting up the most bizarre wallpapers he could find, magical and Muggle. He had charmed each bathroom’s white tiles a different color and pattern, to the point that when even Luna came to stay for a couple days to help out she had strongly encouraged him to reconsider the whole operation and start collecting plants instead.
“Thanks, then,” he cuts her off. “I’d better be getting back. Not proud of it, but he’s coming back soon and I’d like to be there when, you know.”
“I’m so in love with you. Draco.” Potter looks back up at him. His eyes sparkle in the dark. He huffs out a hot laugh onto Draco’s cheeks. It’s embarrassing, almost. The raw honesty that the both of them have accepted in their new reality. Draco wants to live in it forever.
“You’re wrapped around my little finger, Potter,” he says. The music is almost too loud, but Malfoy is tapping in rhythm on his temple as he runs his nails gently across Harry’s scalp. “You’re all mine.”
He is rambling again, and as he shuts himself up via wineglass he sticks his hand back in Harry’s hair. Harry shakes his head in protest, but he laughs onto Malfoy’s dick, too. Harry can feel the bass under his knees on the hardwood. Harry ignores the music and how it makes his cheeks burn, how Malfoy whispers along to
. So much like his parents. Dead with a baby at twenty-one. Harry and Draco, something like twenty-six years later, teaching children what Harry often wishes they would never have to know.
“You should be proud of this, Malfoy. It’s crazy, what you’ve done here. It’s incredible,” Harry says. He turns to face Malfoy, who is looking in one of the full-length mirrors on the walls.
“Two peas in a pod, you two,” Harry says. Draco laughs and takes his arm. It sends a shock to Harry’s heart, like he’s forgotten it, that Draco is in love with him as he is in love with Draco.
“What about a live band.” It isn’t a question, and all Harry has to do is look his way for him to nod grimly and accept his defeat.
Here is Malfoy teasing Harry in a way he never has before, letting Harry in on the joke. He’s smirking and it is achingly familiar but also new, in the way his eyes are dark, dark grey with want and sparkling with joy. Harry takes it and decides he’ll run with it, leans into Malfoy’s space and sticks his nose into his hair. He inhales deeply, putting his hand across Malfoy’s lap and at the far side of him on the bench, so he is diagonally all across him. Malfoy’s free hand not gracefully holding his cigarette comes up immediately to his hair, tugs where it is coming out of its loose braid. Harry groans, takes his lips right to the soft, delicate skin of Malfoy’s neck.
