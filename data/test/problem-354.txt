Point being they ended up inside Hogwarts two days later with little to no trouble. Severus had seemed a bit confused as to why they would possibly want to be in there, but Harry had assured him that it was necessary. Everything had seemed to be going fine as they were all under invisibility spells, until they had heard Voldemort’s voice rocket through the entire castle. And Draco’s mark started burning so badly he thought he was going to die. Ginny and Luna had left to go search Ravenclaw tower, and he and the others were down in the Chamber of Secrets gathering basilisk fangs.
“Wow I’m starving! I think I need food because I definitely did not just eat before coming up here, see you later Sev!” Draco said in a rush, calling him Sev because he knew Severus hated that. He leapt off the chair and flew out of the common room, thinking he would go write a letter to Luna and complain about everything that was going wrong. He was on his way to the owlery when he hit something solid with an “Umph!”
“Er-Can I have a room please?” he said slowly, not making eye contact. Thank Merlin no one he recognized was in here.
Hermione shot him a grateful look before continuing. “The address is here in London, so I could walk there.” She explained.
“No, but I felt it.” Luna was silent for a moment more before continuing. “It’s loud but quiet at the same time, the air is somber and cold...and it's inside of me.” she shuddered. Draco never would’ve used those exact words, but Luna described the atmosphere on the train perfectly. A black hooded figure glided past their car door and Pansy let out an ear piercing scream, while Luna stayed perfectly still with her eyes squeezed shut. A heaviness came over Draco and he wanted nothing more than to fall asleep for all eternity. Voices in his head started and he put his hands over his ears. He heard his father telling him he was a failure, his mother murmuring about him being a disappointment-but then it was over. There were no more voices in his head and the lights in the car turned back on. Everyone was pale and shaken.
Hermione snorted softly before her face settled back into a grimace. “She yelled at all of us, I’ve never seen her so angry. Makes sense I suppose, but still. I would’ve thought she would’ve been more understanding.”
It wasn’t until Harry had mentioned something about Ravenclaw that Hermione had practically screamed with joy.
“Draco?” she asked, rubbing her eyes. Then she saw the look on her face and she paled. “What is it? What happened?”
“Alright.” He shrugged and held the door open for her, not able to resist a glance over his shoulder.
Hey everyone! So just a heads up this chapter is like almost completely AU. And sorry this took so long to get out but it took foreverrr to write. And beware of angst. Lol. Okay anyway the next chapter should be up in like 2-3 weeks or so because I expect it to be very long. Sooooooo, yeah. Hope you enjoy this chapter because it was a headache to write. Thanks for reading! <3
“My eyes. I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s going on. This burns, oh my, oh Merlin, oh shite. Harry and-and my asshole cousin. Ew, ow. Guys-” She was staring at them with eyes as large as plates, her hands clasped over her mouth. Draco realized they were still holding onto each other. Draco could feel his face burning, and he was sure Harry felt the same sentiment. Awkwardly they stepped away from each, looking in opposite directions now. Of course she had to come right when they were about to kiss.
Draco flung his letter box under the couch as Severus walked into the room. Draco was honestly surprised that he was still here. For sure he had thought that he would’ve left by now. However he seemed to want to stay to make sure Hermione healed properly and they knew what they were doing. It quickly became clear to Severus that they were a lost cause. No one knew where Weasley was, it seemed he had done his job of disappearing almost too well. And Potter kept mentioning something about finding artifacts or something or other. Draco didn’t know what was happening anymore. He had given up trying to keep track of the disaster they were stuck in.
“Here’s what we’re going to do.” He blinked in surprise, a small kernel of hope growing in his chest.
There was someone else in the car. He’d heard thumping above them and nearly sprinted out of the car. He was always easily scared these days. He had been about to leave with the others but then glimpsed a flash of a shoe. Potter’s shoe. Damn it. How did he know what Potter’s shoes looked like?
A few days later Draco received a letter from his father. Which was an extremely rare occurrence, so he tore the letter open with excitement. Only to be confused by its contents.
“Er, alright then. If that was all?” Draco stepped away, getting ready once more to leave. Before he could leave Severus pulled him closer and for a second there Draco thought he was going to be taken prisoner, but instead he hugged him. Draco stiffened, unsure of what to do. Fuck it. He might be dead in a few days. He threw his arms around Severus and buried his head in his shoulder. After a brief (or long, Draco couldn’t really tell) moment Severus stepped back and nodded at him. Unsure of what to say Draco nodded back, trying to pull himself together. Before he could change his mind he swung his leg over his broom and tied his bag around it. Looking at Severus one last time he kicked off from the ground and flew upwards. Leaving his home behind.
“Draco, wake up love it’s morning. We have classes.” Harry was whispering gently in his ear. Love. Love. Love.
“Er…” Harry took a long breath and brought his eyes up to meet his. “What do you think about…” He trailed off, eyes darting away again. The suspense was practically killing him.
Severus looked very uncomfortable at those words. So what. Draco didn’t care, he was the one making Draco uncomfortable. His love life was none of Severus’s business.
A few days after Draco tucked the latest letter away Severus ambushed him in the library and scared the shite out of him. It was late, nearly 8, and Draco was reading up on charms when he saw a shadow towering over him. He almost screamed before Severus put a hand over his mouth and he realized who it was.
One rather awful thing has happened of late, however I suppose something good has come out of it. First off I want you to know that Hermione isn’t going to die. Because I’m going to break into my house, find some damn potions, and take you with me when I leave. Sure, this could go terribly terribly wrong. But Granger needs potions and I need you, so fuck it. Really there isn’t anything else we can do. I hope you don’t punch me when I rescue you. I feel sick every time I think about it. I know what’s going to happen when I see you again, and yet I still delude myself into thinking we’re going to make out once it’s safe. I’m going to end it here and stop torturing myself. I leave very soon after all. See you soon Potter.
“No one’s trying to drive you insane!” Potter yelled. They were basically screaming at each other now, and Draco was thankful no one had come running to see what all the commotion was about.
“Ah well, worth a try but you were a bit obvious-” Weasley said. Granger and Weasley broke into an argument and Draco was puzzled when he heard nothing of Potter. Where had he gone? Surely he was still with them.
For some reason that only made Draco sob harder. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. He knew that he and Harry were supposed to be together. But Harry didn’t remember that, and he never would. He would never know about their history together, about how they were so in love that they decided to go against Severus’s demand and stay in a relationship. How Draco had tried, and failed, to teach Harry occlumency.
“That must’ve been fucking scary.” He replied. Not for the first time Draco wished he was better at comforting people.
“Draco!” Luna scrambled up from a bed and flung herself into his arms. “I was going to tell you where we were going but Harry wanted to leave right away and he was so worried, and I’m sure you were so worried too.” She sobbed into his neck. More quietly she said, “He’s really back, I-I, saw him. We all did.”
Draco had to admit, Potter was rather good on a broom. Which he would’ve expected before...Well that didn’t matter now. What mattered now was that he and Potter were enemies. And Potter actually appeared to be a worthy opponent, unlike everyone else. Enemies, friends. There wasn’t really such a big difference. At least Harry Potter wasn’t out of his life entirely. That was all he could really ask for. He held the letter for a moment more before slipping it amongst the rest of the letters. He should really stop writing these.
Draco practically flung himself into the barrier after waving goodbye to his mother. He was free. Not forever. And for who knew how long, but he was free for now.
“Go on then.” She nodded upstairs. The shower was off now, and he could hear Harry moving around in the room upstairs.
“I agree.” Potter said without missing a beat. Draco felt himself get hot. Potter had just agreed with him. He felt happiness spread all the way down to his toes. He was a mess these days, honestly.
“No, I think he’s going to pay.” Weasley drew his wand once again and he felt himself double over in laughter.
“How-how.” Draco stuttered, his stomach tightening in panic and his mind whirling desperately. He couldn’t even deny it, he was so stunned.
“Have you already killed him?” Alecto asked eagerly, even in the dark Draco could see that her eyes were glistening with excitement.
“Spare me, come on then.” He dragged Draco towards a lighted room down the corridor, and all too late Draco realized they were headed straight into Slughorn's party. Where Harry was, where Luna was, and Merlin knew who else was there. He blinked as he was pushed into the loud and brightly lit room. His eyes immediately began searching for Harry’s, he found Granger’s instead. Her eyes widened when she saw him, and she ducked away immediately.
“Okay, yes. That makes sense. How are we going to go about breaking him out?” Draco couldn’t help but feel slightly hopeful. Even though Harry would no longer remember him, he could be safe. Key word could. No news had gotten out yet about Harry being held prisoner, or if he was dead or alive, so that was good he supposed.
“Do you know what would happen if the dark lord found out about this?” Severus gestured between the two of them. Draco felt a twinge of annoyance at those words. Of course he knew. He wasn’t a child. He wasn’t stupid. He was a death eater for Merlin’s sake. He knew the consequences one's actions had in regards to the dark lord.
“Yes Ms. Parkinson.” Flitwick said stiffly. She flushed and looked down at her shoes. He began pairing off people and to Draco’s great dismay and greater excitement Potter was paired with him. Being paired with Potter was always...interesting. Draco drew in a deep breath and resolved to act normal. Like enemies normally acted. He tried to draw his face into a scowl. Potter came to his desk and stiffly sat with him. Act normal, act normal.
It wasn’t until a few months later that Draco absolutely lost what little peace of mind he had left. Luna had made some joke about house rivalries and Draco had been laughing along with Theo and Pansy, when a flash of light appeared. All three of them lept to their feet and started clapping excitedly. The band started playing and everyone was screaming in excitement. A scream sounded from the audience. And then another. And then the most guttural scream Draco had ever heard sounded from a little ways away. It was the 6th year Diggory had been snogging. He was screaming. Screaming so loud that it sounded more animal than human. Pansy clapped a hand to her mouth and muffled a scream of her own.
“A cafe, it’s only a block from here. I used to come here with mum sometimes, when I was still in primary school.” Her eyes were glistening as she said so, they had a faraway look in them. People were walking briskly around them, Draco was surprised to find that Muggles were no more polite than wizards. No one seemed to have any qualms about bumping into others without an apology before continuing on their way. By now Draco had already been jostled by several people.
“Yes, yes here. How much?” After paying Tom, he showed Draco a small, dingy room upstairs. It smelled like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages, and there was an odd heaviness in the air that clung to his skin. He was a tad worried that a rat would come and gnaw at his toes in the middle of the night, but he tried to shove his thoughts to other places. He could just stay here until morning. And then at the crack of dawn he would go to Gringotts and take some money out of account and exchange it for Muggle money. After that he supposed he would just have to wander all over Muggle Britain and pray that he somehow picked up some clues on the Order along the way. Because that was most definitely a brilliant plan.
“Urgh, shite.” Pansy muttered under her breath at the sight of them. Pansy had always hated Granger for some reason unknown to him. Both Granger and Weasley had their heads bent together and were violently whispering, when they noticed the two new figures in the car they straightened immediately. Both seemed to make it a point to look anywhere but at Draco. What the bloody hell was going on. Draco swallowed and slid into a seat next to Padma.
“Oh my...This is quite the predicament.” Granger shook her head and resumed pacing. “Okay, okay.” She began muttering to herself then stopped to turn and face him.
“Over here alright?” Harry asked, pointing at an empty table near a window. Outside rain had started to fall lightly. Draco had always enjoyed watching the rain from inside.
“I know you’re there Potter.” After a rustling from above Potter was in front of them, holding a silvery looking blanket. Wait a second.
“Draco, Draco, your head is practically buzzing, it's distracting.” Oops. He was supposed to be helping her finalize a potions essay. Not that he’d been much help so far. He was way too excited.
I hope you’re not doing too terribly. Which I suppose is too much to ask for considering you’re at my house at the moment. Where the dark lord and my father live. Well you’ll simply have to do your best to survive. Because I’ll kill you if you die. Okay, let’s move on. I don’t want to talk about this anymore. It’s too upsetting. I suppose I have absolutely no right to be complaining, it’s a likely possibility that you’re being torchered right now, and I am setting out in a few minutes with money jangling in my pockets. But now writing letters to you doesn’t feel the same, because we actually were something, and now we’re nothing. I hate thinking about this, because we should still be together. I love you, I like to believe you could’ve loved me. Somehow. And now there’s some stupid war and you’re captured and I’m on the run but not really and it all fucking sucks. A part of me wishes we had never met, that way I wouldn't’ have to continue to feel this way. This morning I woke up in a cold sweat. When I closed my eyes and sleep took me I saw you. At first you were staring at me with a small smile on your face, you brushed hair out of my eyes and pressed a kiss to my nose. You knew that always made me laugh. Then you pulled away abruptly and looked bloody terrified.
“Okay.” Hermione whispered to herself and broke into a run down the corridor. Draco gave Harry a glance before following after her, even now his heart was pounding softly in his chest, the way it always did whenever Harry was around. They were nearing Gryffindor tower when a huge crash echoed through the castle and bone chilling screaming began.
“Nothing.” Draco spat. He couldn’t get any peace around this damn castle. Couldn’t even read the bloody paper without being interrupted.
“Oh bloody hell, come on you two.” Luna swung her book bag over her shoulder and dragged Draco by the hand, motioning Harry to follow them out of the library. She tugged Draco into an abandoned classroom and waited impatiently for Harry to enter. She kicked the door shut and turned to face them.
“But we’re already in danger, there’s a war going on, you can’t protect everyone. And this was something I wanted to know, you two mean a lot to me I wouldn’t tell anyone. She blinked rapidly and looked away.
“Bye!” She said brightly, giving both of them a wave. Draco gave her a confused glance but she had already shut the door behind them. Both of them stood blinking in the sudden light. Clouds hung overhead, but as of the moment no rain had fallen.
“Something wrong?” asked Theo, who was watching him read the letter. Draco threw down the letter in frustration.
“Hey I know. I know this is real.” He said quickly, not wanting her to start going off on a louder tangent and attract more people’s attention.
He did his best to carry her over to the couch without jostling her further. She was muttering something, but he couldn’t understand a word she was saying. Okay, okay, okay. Draco didn’t know what to do. He was shite at healing spells. And his hands were shaking so hard he didn’t trust himself to do it. He turned to go get Ginny or Luna but a hand on his arm stopped him.
A few weeks later they found themselves breaking into the ministry. Of course it fell upon Draco to be the distraction. He wasn’t even polyjuiced, just to ensure that every single eye in the room would be drawn to him. Hermione had come up with this idea actually. Once again, she was correct. While the rest of them snuck into the Ministry, intending to go steal the horcrux that they didn’t know where it was, he was to walk into the middle of the Ministry. Where the most employees would be, and yell that he had seen Harry Potter. Draco was a wanted man himself, and Hermione’s idea had been for him to pretend to sell Harry out. Which actually, worked out quite brilliantly.
“Okay, show me. I’ll get my wand.” Luna hurried back into the room and came out with her wand, an angry Ginny trailing behind her.
You have riddled me with some sort of illness. You must have cursed me while I wasn’t looking. I feel ill. I feel as if I am dying whenever I am around you. This must be your plan, to make me feel sick so that we cannot fight. Am I no longer a worthy enemy of you? Is that why you have done this to me? I don’t understand what is happening. Even the thought of you sends this feeling to the pit of my stomach and this warmth spreads all over me. I hate you. This is all your fault Potter.
“Look.” He started, fumbling for a good reason. He was about to continue when there was a flash of light and Harry collapsed. For a second Draco thought he was dead, and he raised his wand to kill whoever had done so, but it was only Severus. Of course it was.
“Come.” The dark lord stood from his seat and turned to face them, his red eyes narrowing in on them. Draco walked unsteadily towards him, already pushing up his sleeve. As soon as he got within arms reach of him, the dark lord roughly grabbed Draco’s arm and placed the tip of his wand to it. Draco didn’t have time to think what would happen before a sharp, stabbing pain was making its way up his arm and the mark was spreading over it. He nearly passed out from how badly it hurt, and looked quickly away when he saw it. It was disgusting. He would never be able to get rid of it. It was always going to be there, taunting him. And he couldn’t do anything about it.
“I don’t need your help! He trusted me with this and I can do it by myself, I don’t need your help.” Draco repeated, he set his jaw stubbornly and didn’t meet Severus’ eyes.
“What?” Draco felt like he was watching this whole scene play from above. This couldn’t possibly be happening. How was it possible for so much to go wrong in one night?
This whole death eater is going to be harder than I thought. And believe me, I was already pretty damn sure it was going to be hard. You see the thing is, Snape is trying to help me, so now I have to have my guard up 24/7. Which is very exhausting. I don’t know why he’s trying to help me, I mean it’s my problem and the dark lord will probably kill him if he ever finds out what he’s doing. So why even try? But apparently he made some sort of vow with my mother. And why Harry, why. It’s as if they think I can’t do this myself. Okay I know, I can’t do this myself because I’m trapped. Yet I did find a short term solution and am currently working on the bigger picture. I mean so far the only thing I’ve come up with is to run away together, but something tells me that isn’t the brightest idea I’ve ever had. The other problem I have is you. I don’t like keeping this from you. I don’t know if you would understand, or if you wouldn’t. I’ve contemplated telling you just to see what would happen but I don’t want you to be put in danger because of me. So I suppose the only thing to do is feel guilty all the time. I wonder if you can tell if something is troubling me. If you can, you haven’t asked. Which is a good thing I suppose. It’s already hard enough keeping this from you, I don’t want to have to lie to your face. Even though I sort of already am. This is stressing me out further. I’m going to think of a solution now.
“Draco! Draco get your ass over here we’ve been worried sick!” Pansy called from where she was standing with Theo. Some of Draco’s excitement started to fade away at that. He had hardly spoken to Theo since he had kissed him under the mistletoe. Draco shook himself, these were his friends and he owed them some sort of explanation.
“Oh Draco, I’m sure he likes you too. I see the way he’s always watching you. Ginevra was telling me he’s practically obsessed with you and this is just so perfect there are no other words for me to say!” To Draco’s dismay her eyes were shining with tears of what he could only assume was happiness.
Draco was ready to say fuck you, before two specks of spit landed on his face. Any words Draco had thought to say got burned in the back of his throat. His father had just spit on him. What the actual fuck. Lucius was smiling at him still, a wild kind of pleasure alight in his eyes. Draco made a choking sound. He recoiled, not even having the capacity to feel embarrassed as he flinched away from his father.
A few days after school started Draco had his first class of Umbridge. It was an absolute nightmare. By then the tale had already spread through the school about Potter’s showdown with Umbridge in the middle of class. Draco wished he had been there to see it. Although from the rumors he hadn’t quite grasped how terrible she was. No one had mentioned her large bulging eyes that never seemed to blink. Draco sat with Pansy, Theo, and Blaise as usual. The first half of class she told them to read from the textbooks, which they did. Until one of the Hufflepuffs asked a question about defending themselves. It was Hannah Abott.
“Please don’t tell me you’re going to leave me too.” she said desperately, her voice tight with pain. Draco sighed and sat on the couch at her feet.
“Alright.” What could she possibly want? She wasn’t going to slap him again was she? Together they walked out of the classroom and turned down the corridor. Instead of going towards the Great Hall she motioned towards an empty alcove. Eyeing her warily he followed. She cast a spell around them and Draco was nothing short of terrified. Was she going to murder him here? No one would hear him scream, everyone would find his lifeless body here-
You truly are a complete disturbance to this entire school. A flying car? The train isn’t good enough for you and your bloody sidekick? Ugh. I was disgusted when Theo told me all about your adventure. I have to admit, I was rather worried when you didn’t come to the feast. As you are well aware, I hate you, but I do need you to be my enemy. Sorry, I’m getting off topic. You’re an idiot. It amazes me that school has barely even begun and you have already injured a magnificent piece of school property. Okay the whomping willow isn’t that magnificent, it scares me to be perfectly truthful, but still. You damaged school property before your first class. That has to be a record. Well I only needed to tell you that I loathe you and you are a danger to this entire institution.
“I knew you could do it.” That wasn’t really true but Draco was going to pretend that it most certainly was.
“Right then. Miss?” he asked, trying to wake the sleeping girl. She started and brushed the hair out of her eyes hastily.
When school finally rolled around again, Draco could not have been more glad. He was even excited to see Weasley for goodness sake. The whole summer had been the worst and most boring one yet. Even when he had gotten his prefect badge he couldn’t feel happy. His mother had looked extremely excited but to him it hadn’t really mattered. It also meant that he could not sit with Luna and Theo for the first part of the train ride. He walked with Pansy to the prefect train car, trying to guess who the other prefects would be. Together they walked in and saw Hannah Abott, Ernie Macmillan, Padma Patil, Anthony Goldstein, and-
“Let me get this straight.” He drained the last of his coffee and grimaced at the coldness of it. Coffee was rather disgusting when it had been left out for too long. They had been here for over an hour, however no one seemed to be paying them any mind.
“Okay, okay.” Hermione was pacing back and forth shaking her hands out as they went over the plan one last time.
Draco needed to stop writing these letters. What if someone found them? Merlin, what if his father found them? He could only imagine the punishment he would get if his father even glimpsed the things he was saying. Yet he could not bring himself to throw them away. They were letters to his enemy. The person he loathed most in the world. He should be able to burn them without a second thought. It should bring him pleasure to watch every written word crumble to ashes. It didn’t. And that worried him a great deal.
Please don’t kill the hippogriff. It really wasn’t Buckbeak’s fault for what happened, it was my own. Just call off the execution please. I don’t want him to die.
It was just him and Potter now. Draco felt like he was going to pass on. Every part of him was sweating and his knees were shaking. Potter was still bright red and Draco tried, he really did, not to look at Potter’s lips. But they were parted, and Draco wanted nothing more than to run his fingers through his hair and kiss him until he couldn’t remember anything else, until- And then he realized his face was impossibly close next to Potter’s. Potter had grabbed the front of his quidditch robes and pulled him closer so that he could see the gorgeous color of his eyes and he could hear Potter breathing unevenly. What was going on, what was happening, Draco was going to pass out from the stress and excitement of all of this because this was way too much to believe was actually happening. It would be so so easy to lean in and part Harry’s lips with his own. All he had to do now was lean in a little. And he almost did. But reality came crashing back into him when he glimpsed Umbridge storming towards them from over Potter’s shoulder. Without thinking he quickly shoved Potter away. He wished he hadn’t seen the hurt and confusion that passed over his face as he stared in horror at Umbridge storming towards them.
“We can hide it from Vol-him, I mean. I’ll get better at occlumency, or whatever, learn to clear my mind and all that.” Harry gushed.
“You’re supposed to be the positive one.” he protested. She stared at him with a grim expression on her face.
Draco nodded vigorously, “Of course.” Theo turned and really did leave this time. Draco went to the nearest staircase and sat there thinking for a long while. He should’ve listened to Pansy. Should’ve told Theo right away instead of letting him believe they might ever have a chance together. Draco was a complete mess of a person, he couldn’t understand why even Theo liked him in the first place. But that really wasn’t the point right now. The point was, he had hurt someone he cared about. And although he would really like to blame this on Potter, it wasn’t his fault. It was Draco’s.
“Right this way then lad.” Tom nodded at him, looking him up and down, before motioning towards the stairs. “I’ll show you where you can stay. Got your money with yah?”
“Will you come with me? I-er, Her-” He paused and realized he should probably refer to everyone by their surname so as to not freak Harry out. “Granger, Lovegood, and the Weasley girl, we’re all staying at Grimmauld place.”
Er-not quite. He was a very bizarre mix of devastated, worried, and blissfully happy. He settled for a nod, not really trusting himself to speak. Her brows furrowed together, as if she was thinking very hard.
“They’re going to put one to death!” she practically shrieked. “They’re going to murder that majestic creature right here on school grounds!”
I FINISHED A FIC GUYSSSSSSS. I'm very proud of myself, usually I abandon my fics hahhhh. Anyway announcement time everyone.
Harry’s eyes snapped to Draco’s, his face immediately softening. Draco nodded hastily, struggling to get up. Harry rushed over and took his hand gently. Draco knew it was entirely the wrong time but he pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek.
“Who?” Theo wiped at his eyes as his voice cracked. Draco twisted his hands together, desperately trying to find the right words.
The very next day Potter dragged him behind some curtains. Draco had been alone, intending to go to the library to do some thinking about his situation. Er-or about Potter. That seemed to be where his thoughts always wandered anyway. Then suddenly a familiar rough hand had pulled him behind heavy curtains. And Draco hadn’t been scared, he had been thrilled.
“I’d like a word with you Draco.” Came Severus’ stern voice. Shite. He was here too? Finally, Harry came into view. He ducked out from under some curtains, looking puzzled. He mouthed something to Draco but he was no good at reading lips. He settled for gesturing wildly with his hands, not quite sure exactly what he was hoping to convey to Harry.
A couple weeks later Mcgonagall announced in Transfiguration that there was going to be a ball at Hogwarts. The Yule Ball apparently. Draco wasn’t really looking forward to this. His father had already owled him and told him to go with Pansy or Millicent, as they had been bred from “good” families. However Draco had no intention of going with either of them. Pansy and Millicent were like sisters to him. He knew who he actually wanted to go with. But that was certainly not an option. So he did his best to shake the ludicrous idea out of his head.
“We have good reason to believe Harry Potter might be expelled.” he said, and then gave Draco a smile. “I wanted to tell you, I know how much you despise him.”
A few lonely weeks had passed, in which Draco had spent most of the time writing letters to Luna and practicing piano. He should probably have studied more for his Hogwarts classes, but he couldn’t bring himself to open his textbooks in the middle of summer. All of his necessary homework had been finished long ago after all. The only remotely interesting thing that had happened was when his Monster Book of Monsters had tried to eat him, and then his bedroom. Now he was finally going back to Hogwarts where he could see all of the Slytherins, Luna, and no-not Potter. He didn’t want to see Potter. He did not want to see Potter. He merely wanted to spend a Potter free year in which he could enjoy the company of the Slytherins plus one Ravenclaw.
“Here you are.” The girl came back and placed their coffees down on the table. Now she was grinning from ear to ear. Draco must have had a confused look on her face because hurriedly she said,
“I would love to! I didn’t think I would get a chance but now I can visit with all of the nargles and there’s going to be so many wrackspurts, and thank you thank you thank you!” She grinned at him and flung her arms around him.
After a few days of worrying terribly, Draco realized the entire thing had simply been a false alarm. They put Potter on trial and everything but he got off. Something about Dumbledore, his mother had told him, but he hadn’t been paying attention. He was too excited by the fact that Potter was coming back. He practically flew up the stairs and flung himself at his desk to write another letter. Though right at that moment two owls came flapping towards his window and clicked their beaks noisily. Blinking once, Draco opened his window cautiously.
Hermione shook her head and rolled her eyes. “I know, it’s hard for all of us to accept. But not thinking about it, or pretending it isn’t real, isn’t going to help anyone. People are dying, we need to do something before it’s too late, while we still have a chance. And ugh-” She gripped at her hair, Draco half expected her to jump up from her chair and began pacing the room. Though he supposed that was something Harry would’ve done, not Hermione.
“It’s fine, I understand. I’ll be upstairs.” Draco said stiffly, not looking at any of them as he hurried out of the room. The stairs creaked eerily as he walked up them, trying to ignore the sound of hushed voices from downstairs. He wandered down the hall, not knowing which room to go into. Finally he stopped at a room marked Regulus Arcturus Black. He frowned, he didn’t know much about Sirius’s brother. He hesitated a brief moment before pushing the door open and stepping inside. The room was covered in dust, and looked as though no one had been in there for years.
You are not speaking to me. You’ve spoken to everyone else, even Severus. I couldn’t believe my own ears when I heard the two of you talking quietly in the kitchen. I didn’t make much effort to speak to you either at first. I had some weird chest pain, and my breathing became incredibly difficult. I stayed in there for a couple hours before Ginny pounded on the door and told me to get out before she broke down the door. I bet she would’ve. Hermione’s going to be okay though, I’m glad. I won’t pretend I wasn’t worried sick. Everyone’s still pissed at her though. I don’t understand why she would do something so incredibly stupid. I mean she’s literally the smartest person in all of Hogwarts. Hell I wouldn’t be surprised if she was the smartest person in the whole wizarding world. No matter. She’s safe now at least. I tried talking to you the other day, but you left the room right as I entered. I certainly helped no one told you about our history, and then what I did. I don’t think anyone would have. Hopefully that is. I wonder what you do remember of me. All the terrible stuff I guess. That doesn’t erase the sting I feel every time I see you though. You’re still beautiful. Merlin. I’m doomed. I’m going to go wallow now Potter. There doesn’t seem to be much else I can do at the moment.
“Hey, hey it’s okay.” he said quickly. Though it was not okay. A figure had just fallen from their broom and was plummeting to the ground.
The next morning Draco woke to soft giggles. Sleeping on the couch had been a bad idea. With his eyes still squeezed shut he sat up and wondered if he could leave the room without Luna and Ginny noticing. He did not want to know what they were doing. He stood up shakily and tried to take a step in what he hoped was the opposite direction.
The song came to an abrupt end and Potter practically sprinted away from Patil. He joined Weasley over in the corner and both of them leaned their heads together in conversation.
“Why don’t you come to the quidditch game.” Luna suggested, brightening up. He had nearly forgotten about the Gryffindor Hufflepuff match, due to his illness he had not thought of much else except Potter. Well, it wasn’t like he had much else to do besides feel sick and miserable.
“That’s what he wants us to know, that we can bring down the wards and then break Potter out. The wards must be what is keeping the charms in place.” Draco nodded at Hermione who cracked a smile.
“No. It’s not enough. Go.” He motioned for Harry to get out of his office. Harry jumped up, practically shaking with fury, and for a second there Draco thought Harry was going to scream at the man. But instead he walked out in silence and slammed the door behind them.
You owe me. I saw you in Borgin and Burkes. I saw you inside that cabinet. You make as much as a racoon, Merlin. I’m surprised Mr. Burkes didn’t open the door to make sure the cabinet wasn’t possessed. That’s besides the point. I saved your skin today. And you might not know that, but I saved you. I thought about saying something. I could make your day bloody miserable. But I didn’t. Why? I don’t really know. You just looked so...scared. And, well, it wouldn’t have been right to give myself the upper hand. We need to be on equal footing. That’s all. Anyway, we conversed later on in the bookshop. Don’t you think Lockhart is a self absorbed prick? Not that I care what you think. It’s simply that I found him to be rather annoying, forcing you to stand there and take pictures for the press. You looked uncomfortable there. Once again, not that I care. I do want to apologize for my father’s behavior though. It bothers me when my father drones on and on about Malfoy manners and such, but he can’t even be bothered to have a civil conversation whenever I’m around. My father was very rude today, and I’m not sorry exactly. Merely troubled I suppose. I know I should want to be like him but I really don’t. He has no manners, and he pretends he does. Which in my opinion is even worse. Now I don’t know why I’m telling you this. It appears I don’t know many things after all. Probably why Granger is beating me in all of my classes. I better go study now. Bye Potter.
He sat there for so long that early morning light finally soaked through the curtains and into the dim hallway.
“No, no, nothing’s wrong. I was merely lonely.” she met his eyes and grinned. “But I’m not anymore.”
“You can tell me.” He wanted to. Truly, he wanted to tell Luna everything that had been weighing on him all summer. But that might put her in danger. She shouldn’t have to suffer the consequences of knowing his burdens.
She took a shuddering breath and squared her shoulders. “Okay then. Be careful.” He was about to tell her to do the same but she took off at a sprint before the words had even formed on his lips. He was left alone in the corridor, waiting for the door to the room of requirement to appear. His stomach hurt terribly as the seconds dragged on for hours. This really hadn’t been a very good idea. Abruptly a door appeared in the empty corridor and Draco sucked in a shallow breath, waiting for them to appear. Slowly, it creaked open, making a long whining sound as several Death Eaters emerged from behind it. His Aunt Bellatrix among them. Her hair was as wild as ever, and her eyes held the same bloody thirsty glint they usually did.
Turns out you're a potions prodigy. Fascinating. I wonder how you did so good in a subject you’re normally so terrible at. No offense meant but it was incredible how you beat Granger. She looked very pissed about it. I was a bit too preoccupied to pay much attention to what I was doing. Slughorn seemed rather annoyed with my potion, although I don’t really care what he thinks. He’s kind of creepy. He collects kids, Blaise told me about it. Who collects people? Apparently him. No matter, I’m just glad I get to have another class with you. Although we haven’t talked since then. Which is sad. It’s been like two days but it feels like much longer. That’s terribly cliche isn’t it. Oh well. I can’t help it. My emotions have been off the walls bonkers these past few days. First I was overjoyed. Then I was terrified. Then angry. Then depressed. Honestly I don’t even know what I’m feeling now. I can’t stop thinking about what will happen when (if?) the dark lord finds out. Will he kill me and then my mother? Or will he torture me to find out your secrets? Not that you’ve told me any. We haven’t actually gotten a chance to talk. Just make out. Which was nice, don’t get me wrong, but it feels like we should probably discuss what the fuck is going on. I best be off now, Severus wants to talk to me. Can’t imagine why.
“Oh, and don’t mention this to anyone. Even my mother.” Draco said, glancing back. Borgin glanced upward before bowing and replying.
It turned out Draco was actually quite good at tuning people out. He didn’t really pay attention to what was going on for most of the game, and by the time he came back to himself, it was already over. Draco had been planning to book it to the changing rooms but one of the twin’s voices stopped him.
The plan immediately went to complete and utter shit. For one thing, they hadn’t even been planning to pull the whole thing into motion for a couple weeks. However his dear Aunt Bellatrix had sent him a vast amount of concerning messages regarding the impatience of the dark lord, and both Draco and Hermione thought it best to just do it immediately. The dark lord had begun threatening his mother.
“Alright! What is it you aren’t telling us?” She demanded, glaring at them angrily. Draco was glad he wasn’t on the receiving end of her anger.
I don’t know what to do. You haven’t looked at me in eight very long days. We haven’t spoken a single word to each other and I don’t know if that’s good or bad. My emotions are a wreck these days and it’s all your fault. Some moments I’m practically giddy because, well, you know. And other days I cry and scream into my pillow because I want to be your boyfriend so badly. And we both know that can never happen. We’re supposed to be worst enemies. And here I am, completely and utterly in love with someone who is incredibly confusing and clearly doesn’t know how to communicate very well. I don’t want to wallow anymore, so I’m going to go and try to do some homework.
“Okay here.” Ginny ran back into the room with a bunch of towels in her arms. She shoved them at Luna and quickly backed away.
He was about to suggest they part ways when Harry pulled him into a kiss. He tried not to burst into giggles as Harry tugged him closer and ran his finger down Draco’s cheek. He put his hands to Harry’s neck, heart beating rapidly. He had never known lips could feel so soft as his parted gently and allowed for Harry’s tongue to slip inside. Warmth came over Draco as he kissed Harry back and he tried to breath in the sensation of the moment. They pulled away from each other, both breathing a little harder.
She nodded quickly. “I will. The wards…” Draco let out a strangled laugh. Merlin nothing could shake her focus.
He had been reading the paper as he went down to lunch when Weasley bumped into him and sent the paper flying to the floor. On the cover was Weasley’s family. He hadn’t had the chance to read the article quite yet, mostly he was looking at the paper so he would not have to see Potter.
“I’m coming. You can tell him I’m on my way.” He folded his arms and stared back. It didn’t even blink.
He awoke to a loud banging on the door. He fumbled for his wand and rolled out of bed as fast as he could. He swallowed down a yawn and took a trembling step forward.
“I should go. And so should you.” Potter said quietly, nodding at Ms. Norris. Draco blinked quickly.
A few weeks later Draco was working on a Potion’s essay in the library when he heard a quiet creaking. He paused for a moment before putting his quill down and rising from his seat. The noise wasn’t bothering him, he was simply curious. He found Luna sitting on top of a table, her wand behind her ear, staring at the ceiling.
“Oh I’m sorry I’m acting like a bloody idiot. I just really love love.” She covered her mouth with her hands to try and contain giggles, but they spilled through her fingers.
His eyes widened. “Well I’m not going to just let you die! I don’t know what the bloody hell to do!” He said angrily, his voice rising. Why why why, had she left the house without someone again?
The edge of her mouth tilted upwards. “Yeah, us Malfoy. I’m going to help you so we can all make it out together.”
“Hello Ulysses.” he muttered as he untied the letter from it’s leg. The other owl waited patiently and stuck out it’s leg in excitement.
“Draco.” Luckily it was only Severus. Draco knew he should fear him, yet something in him told him to wait.
“It’s okay, Draco will help.” Luna handed him a towel and began instructing him. “So you’re going to hold this to her side, and I’m going to take off her shirt so we can clean her up a little better.”
I don’t really know what to say anymore. One of our classmates is dead. And the dark lord has returned. The tale going around is that you saw him. I’m not sure I want to know what it means that you saw him come back. I keep thinking about how it could’ve been you who had died, so easily you could’ve been the one the dark lord decided to kill. You’re still alive but you seem to have a death sentence Potter. How do you always manage to get yourself into these life or death situations at the drop of a hat? I’m glad you’re alive but I am unable to comfort you in any of the ways I want. I want to hug you and hold you close while you tell me everything horrible that you had to bear witness too. I don’t know how much longer I can keep silent and keep these things to myself. It’s overwhelming and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I suppose I will pack up my things and hope everything is not absolute shite at home. Goodbye for now Potter. I’m thankful that you made it out alive again.
“You have to. You know what they’ll do to you once they find out.” Despite practically having been sentenced to death Harry didn’t look scared.
The box shrunk, along with his letters and he held it a moment longer before slipping it into the pockets of his robes. He wasn’t about to leave this behind and risk the dark lord finding it. Or his father. He blinked quickly, not sure why he was getting all mushy over his stupid box. He shook his head and grabbed his book bag filled with supplies. He’d asked the house elves for some food, money, and a spare cloak. He didn’t want to be burdened down with his things as he traipsed all over the country. It was as thrilling as it was terrifying to finally be leaving everything to do with the dark lord behind. Well, nearly everything, save for the mark on his arm which would still continue to burn by the dark lord’s summons. Draco inhaled sharply and summoned his broom. Steeling himself, he walked down the stairs and out the front door. He was about to mount his broom when something stopped him. Someone was watching him. The back of his neck was prickling uneasily and his stomach had grown tight, as if someone was twisting his organs.
“Hello?” he called in uncertainty. In hindsight it would’ve been much smarter for Draco to have just kicked off the ground before someone caught him.
October 31st: A Translucent Crime (I'm going to write as much as I can before then and then release chapters like once a week as I continue to write.)
“So?” Draco asked breathlessly. Potter placed a hand on the small of his back and drew him even closer. Draco couldn’t breathe. He was going to pass out on top of Potter because of how fast his heart was going. Could one go into cardiac arrest from feeling so much at one time?
A couple weeks after Draco had hidden the most recent letter away, he was on the train talking to Luna. The rest of the Slyterthins were in another car doing Merlin knew what.
“I’ll go find them and we’ll tell everyone we can that you’re back, you and Draco look for the snake.” Her gaze focused on Draco. “Are you going to be alright?”
“I was at a meeting earlier today.” he said quietly. “And they told me the best student in Hogwarts was Hermione Granger. A muggleborn.” Draco’s heart dropped to his stomach. He was…
“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” Draco tried to say it with a lazy, uncaring tone. Knowing he failed when his voice cracked on the last word. Luna’s eyes looked glassy and Granger’s were wide and bright. Draco frowned at her, lately she had always seemed to be quite surprised around him. Weasley opened his mouth to say something but Granger put a hand on his knee and he flushed. He floundered around for another insult, thinking of all the terrible things he would very much like to say, and realized he didn’t have any. He didn’t want to insult them. His father would’ve been so disappointed.
“Bloody bird.” Muttering under his breath Draco shoved his shoes on and stormed out of the dormitory. It was nearly dinnertime and most students were already on their way to the Great Hall. He better not miss dinner for whatever this was. Although some part of him could guess. Potter. It was always about Potter. Or Harry. Harry now he supposed. Shaking himself he brought his hand up to knock on Severus’s office door. It swung open before he even could touch it. He drew back, a little scared at what was going to happen.
After that everything happened very fast. The three of them were thrown to the floor by a big blast and students and teachers began pouring out of the walls.
“Well then what else are we supposed to do!” Harry fired back, removing his hand from Draco’s shoulder to stalk over to where Hermione was standing worriedly.
“Harry? It’s okay with me that you guys are friends Luna.” he said, doing his best to sound nonchalant.
“I can’t. It needs to stay where it is. Can’t you just tell me how to do it?” he asked, his eyes flickering briefly to the shadows.
“Draco.” He motioned for him to come closer. Harry brought his hands to Draco’s face and pressed a kiss to the top of his head through the bars. Draco shivered and grasped his arm.
Draco was so bored. He knew writing these letters was a terrible idea. Anyone could come and find them. But it wasn’t like it was a secret that he and Harry were enemies. Even the seven years must know that they despised each other. Because they did, despise each other. What was he even thinking? He had more important things to worry about than Harry bloody Potter. Ugh, Potter was probably doing this on purpose. Drawing all of this attention to himself to try and distract Draco. He needed to focus more on his studies, Granger had started to pull ahead of him.
What mattered was getting out of here as swiftly as possible. Steeling himself, he walked into his house and let the door click shut behind him. Okay. First up. Potions. Severus kept some stored in the basement he believed. Fuck he really hated the basement. His father had locked him in there for three hours once. He didn’t even remember what he had done. Draco listened for a beat, praying he didn’t hear the quiet murmuring of a death eater meeting. Then he frowned. Now that he thought about it, his dark mark should’ve been stinging whenever meetings were called. Granted he had barely been gone a week so perhaps they hadn’t had a meeting. Yet...something didn’t sit right with him. Well now wasn’t really the time to contemplate such thoughts. After only silence answered him, he crept down the basement stairs. Trying to make as little noise as possible, in case someone happened to be home. After shakily shoving the correct potions into a bag, he speed walked up the stairs, accidentally slamming the door behind him.
“Yeah, yeah of course.” He responded in a low voice. For the second time in an hour he was sure his face was on fire.
“Quite.” Draco shook his head. What exactly did his father want him to do? Egg Potter on? For some reason he didn’t particularly want to use this information against Potter. However a few days later it became apparent that he would have to. He received two more letters from Lucius, both telling him different ways in which he would present this information to Potter. So, he supposed the only thing he could do was pick a fight with Potter and...hint at some information? This was going to go brilliant. The perfect opportunity came in potions the next day. Draco ended up working with both Potter and the Weasel, and Finnigan brought up the subject of none other than Sirius Black. Draco’s ears perked up at the mention of his name. Aha, this was his chance. He was about to open his mouth to say something ambiguous about revenge when he felt Potter’s hand brush against his as he reached for the caterpillars.
“Oh?” Draco situated himself closer to Harry and drew infinity symbols on his right arm. Harry shivered a little then said,
“No, I’ll stay. I have to go out and find potions soon though.” He pressed a hand to his eyes before glancing back at her. “We don’t have any here, and you’re going to need them soon.”
“I want to help you, I made the unbreakable vow to your mother and swore I would protect you. The Unbreakable vow Draco.” Draco’s heart sank. Why on earth would he make the Unbreakable vow? That was a bloody terrible idea. And what exactly had he made the unbreakable vow to do? He opted to say nothing, merely staring at the ceiling in silence.
“Er, yeah.” Potter said sheepishly. He was turning red and Draco found that extremely adorable. Shite. He was losing it again.
“Gone soft that one.” Amycus nodded somberly at Draco. “Bet he doesn’t want to kill Dumbledore.” Draco tried to make a sound of annoyance, though it came out as more of a squeak.
Hermione is a good friend. She told me about the horcruxes. I guess I see why you didn’t want to tell me. In the case that I actually am a terrible person and rat you out to the dark lord. It makes sense. Yet something has been nagging at me this whole time. Why is it that you trusted Severus (who bullied you for several years I might add) yet you do not trust me? Whatever, it’s fine. It’s not actually. I’m not. But I’m going to pretend everything is just bloody brilliant. Because honestly, what else is there for me to do? Potter, I’m very tired of everything. I know it’s apparently too much to ask, but I want to be happy. I want to be happy and in love, and fuck, I want a normal life. I have complained about this before, but I am going to again, because I feel sorry for myself. You have it much worse, I am sure, yet I am currently drowning in self pity because you won’t even look at me without disgust written all over your face. Shite. I’m crying again. Why is it that this always happens? Why do I seem to cry all the bloody time now? It’s fucking annoying. I’m basically a waterfall.
Harry nodded, although he said nothing. Nearly all of the air rushed out of Draco’s lungs. They were safe. It wasn’t his fault.
“Nothing to say now boy?” Lucius asked, eyes still glittering. Mutely, Draco fumbled for Severus’s arm. He had to get out of here. He nearly vomited all over his father as he was yanked away, twisting and turning. Severus must’ve deemed him unfit to apparate. Which was pretty true at the moment.
“Severus left the other Death Eaters there, I don’t know what he’s planning but he must be thinking of something.” He said, trying to convince himself that Severus was actually on their side.
Draco could hear Harry’s swallow. No one spoke for several moments, then Draco gathered up the courage to ask,
“I know…” Her voice was weak, and he could tell her breathing was heavy. “I know about you and-and Harry.” He swung the door open and there on the doorstep was Hermione. Bleeding all over it. There was a gash on her side that was rapidly leaking blood. The fuck?
“You can always ask her to dance later then.” Draco shrugged. Her eyes snapped to his, deadly serious.
He started a pot of coffee and hummed lightly to himself. He heard the shower turn on upstairs and stiffened. Wait. Did that mean that Harry had read the letter by now? What if he hadn’t read the letter at all and decided to fling it in the trash? He sucked in a breath and stood, not knowing what he intended to do.
“Bloody hell how did you do that?” Weasley demanded from across the room. Potter shrugged sheepishly, a blush rising to his cheeks.
Draco did his best not to think of Harry Potter for a while. Or as long as he could go. Which was only about 15 minutes. Though that was still worth something in his mind. He kept himself busy with Quidditch practice, he helped Luna find her shoes and find nargles hiding in the castle, and he...well the rest of the time he was thinking about Potter. Every time the mention of his name came up warmth would pool in the pit of his tummy and a pleasant feeling would spread throughout his whole body. He couldn’t help the way thinking of him made him feel. Soon the school year was coming to a rapid close and Draco had to spend more time on his school work instead of what Potter was doing at all times. The Buckbeak incident had been long behind Draco and he hadn’t really thought much about it since he’d received a letter from his mother making sure he was okay. Until Luna ran up to him after Potions with tears in her eyes.
“It’s scary. Having blanks in your memory.” Ginny said softly, after a long stretch of silence. His conversation with Luna from a couple weeks ago poked at his memory. She was only 11, she didn’t know what was happening.
I hate you. I absolutely despise you. And do you want to know something? You’re never going to read any of my letters. Ever. I hope you have a horrible friendship with Weasel and he stabs you in the back. I’m not going to do anything about it. Because we are never going to be friends. I will hate you for all eternity and spend the rest of my days making you miserable. And to think I was going to go behind my fathers back for the likes of you. You can have your Weasel and you’re stupid Gryffindor pride. I have Slytherin so I don’t bloody need you. Have a terrible rest of your life.
It was a couple weeks later when Draco learned just how knee deep he was in this hole. It was closing in on Christmas and he had yet to think of anything. Big shocker there. The only thing he had done was continue to work on the wardrobe. The one who’s twin lay in Burgin and Burkes. He knew if he somehow got both wardrobes to work again, he could invite some death eaters into the school without anyone detecting. And then from there they could...do something else.
And for some reason that broke something in him. He supposed it was nice to know that other people cared when he was sad.
“Yes.” He replied flatly, not even bothering to look at the man. Flashes of anger had risen inside him, and he wasn’t quite sure why. Severus was only trying to help. At least he hoped he was trying to help.
“They don’t seem to like me very much. Everyone keeps telling me to stuff it when I tell my stories.” She rolled her eyes a little. “Most seem to be very close minded around here.”
“Over here is good.” She pointed a finger towards a booth in the back. The cafe was empty, with only a few people scattered about here and there. They sat and Hermione leaned forward to whisper,
“I hate that name.” His cousin practically growled. Severus said nothing, only staring at Potter. Oh shite. He was trying to legilimence Potter. Draco drew up his own shields but had no way to warn Potter about what Severus was doing. Or...Harry. Could he call Potter Harry now? Draco had so many questions that he needed answered. He was going insane, standing here next to him but not being able to hold him. Severus’s eyes snapped to Draco and he gulped. He certainly did not look happy for Draco.
“Don’t worry though.” For a moment Draco thought Harry was going to say something else. He was biting his lip, not meeting Draco’s eyes. Instead they settled into a silence and Draco moved even closer so that he could rest his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry laughed a little and put his arm around Draco, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. Draco smiled into Harry’s shoulder and rubbed his nose lightly against it. He was going to say something about how blissfully happy he was, but his eyes were drooping and the words grew heavy on his tongue. Before he knew it he had faded away into sleep and so had Harry.
“Me?” Draco asked, but knowing she was right. He’d barely spoken to any of them on the rest of the ride.
“It’s Black.” Snape said furiously. “We had him, and he escaped. It’s Potter’s fault. All his fault, just like his father he is. Going around doing whatever he wants, not thinking of the consequences. He could’ve bloody killed me but not like he cares.” Snape was throwing random ingredients into a cauldron and Draco wondered for a moment if he was making some sort of poison to murder Potter before he got back on the train.
“We don’t know quite yet. The others wanted to make sure we could trust you before we all got together.” Draco blinked.
There’s not much for me to write here anymore. Now I can talk to you whenever I like and I know you’re always going to listen. I suppose this is going to be the end of my letters. I thought I would be more sad but I’m not really. We’re going to spend the next year at Hogwarts together, and honestly, I couldn’t want anything more than that. So I’m going to leave it here. I love you. A fucking ton.
“OH MY FUCKING MERLIN!” Luna had fallen out of her seat, making a loud clang as her chair went down with her. She scrambled to her feet, head whipping back and forth between the two of them. Her mouth was soundlessly shaping the words you-you-you over and over again.
Draco had vomited on his own shoes at those words. Amycus had rolled his eyes and half dragged, half carried him off the grounds. Draco didn’t care. Harry was captured. And it was all his fault.
Hermione Granger truly is the brightest witch of her age. I can’t believe she hangs around with you and Weasley all the time (no offense). All this time she was here and we never even talked! Save for the times I would insult her because I was a senseless prat, those don’t count alright? Anyway I meant to say that she comes up with the most ingenious plans. Honestly if you and Weasley listened to her more often you wouldn’t have ended up in half those deadly scenarios. She told me quite a bit about him, I think she’s in love with Weasley. Don’t tell her I said that though, I nearly asked her about it but it seems she knew what I was thinking and shot me a deadly look. That’s really besides the point though. We might all actually make it out of this alive Potter, how incredible is that! Here’s our new and improved plan;
It is my assumption that one of you will end up reading this, as both of you are my two most clever students. I am taking a huge risk in giving you this letter, so please do me the courtesy of reading it quite thoroughly and disposing of it properly. I understand that what I have done paints me in the worst of the light, however I ask that you listen fully to what I have to say. I am still a spy, and I intend to play my part till the very end. Albus Dumbledore was already dying when he asked me to kill him, he wanted me to take the part of Draco, who was intended to go through with the deed. I did as he asked and fled with the other death eaters. I will soon be the new Headmaster of Hogwarts, and I shall do my best to protect what students I can. Do not return, although I know you aren’t stupid enough to even consider it. Help Potter escape is all I can ask of you two. And whomever else you have happened to drag along. I cannot give too much away in this letter, save it be taken by the wrong people. However I can tell you that I Will not Ask much moRe of you than this. You are Decidedly Still children, after all. Take care of yourselves.
“Thank you, Granger,” he said sincerely. He couldn’t believe his good fortune in meeting someone like her. Someone who wasn’t willing to let him work through everything by himself.
He slid his chair back and sat down. The waitress came back holding a paper and pen. She appeared to be fighting back a smile.
When the Yule Ball rolled around Draco was actually somewhat looking forward to it. He knew that he would have a good time with Luna, listening to her talk about nargles and wrackspurts. Whatever those were. He met her in the entrance of the Great Hall and smiled. Her butterbeer cap necklace and radish earrings were absolutely perfect.
“Nah we know it was you.” One of them nodded, they’re eyes bright. Draco was starting to feel queasy.
“Guys…” Hermione said, but he could hear the smile in her voice. Shakily he gave her a kiss on the cheek too.
She didn’t speak for a few moments, her brows were furrowed and he could tell she was thinking hard about something.
“I was supposed to get it a while ago but I kind of forgot.” A blush crept up his neck and Draco bit back a smile.
“You can’t attack him, you'll get detention!” Granger yelled worriedly. She glanced at Draco and an odd expression came over her face before she turned back to Weasley.
I’m sure you are. Have you considered that you might be in love? I’ve heard that love drives people rather crazy. Not that I think you’re crazy, you just seem rather tense. But you’re always like that actually. Nevermind me, I just received a letter from Ginevra and I’m a little starstruck. And I don’t think you and Harry are worst enemies. You both always act very odd around each other but never quite like you hate each other. I hope the two of you come to your senses soon enough and kiss. I’m doing quite well thanks for asking. I discovered this fascinating plant that sings whenever I water it. You probably didn’t want to know that but I wanted to tell you. And I did send a letter to Ginevra, and she replied as I mentioned earlier. I did do a lot of screaming when I received that letter. Daddy thought there was a bee in the house (I’m allergic) and I had to explain my entire situation. I ought to go help with dinner now. It was nice hearing from you, write soon.
“No, no er-your father wanted me to give you some books.” Snape said quickly, standing and pulling some books from his robes. Snape was always pulling odd things out of his voluminous robes.  He handed Draco the books before nodding at him.
“You can say that again.” Theo said, glancing sideways at her. Draco and Luna were wrapped together in their cloaks, huddling together for warmth. Hardly any of the players were visible during the match, except for brief glimpses when they came close to the stands.
“I was able to place a tracking spell on your owl. That was stupid what you did, sending me a letter. You’re lucky I’m the one who found it.” She shook her head and brushed past him.
I don’t remember much of what happened at the feast. Only that Severus was glaring at me most of the time. Not that I blame him too badly. I know deep down he only does these things because he cares. Even though he often pretends he doesn’t, he does. Anyway I hope we get a chance to meet again soon. I wonder what you’re thinking right now. I’m scared that you thought it was all a mistake, but then again, why would you keep seeking me out? It doesn’t make any sense. You’re a very confusing person Potter (Harry? Can I call you that now?) And I want to know what’s going to happen with us. I have so many things I should tell you. Like that I’m a death eater. And that I’ve fallen hopelessly in love with you and I believe you might actually feel some sort of affection for me. Oh I had something to tell you. Severus is very very very veryyyy pissed at the both of us. He made me come to his office to yell at me. I thought he was going to start crying. He was so angry. I mean he didn’t look like he was going to cry but I just had this feeling that he was scared and angry and sad. He doesn’t want either of us to die I suppose. And he seems extremely worried that this will put the both of us in danger. And he’s right. But both of us already have targets on our backs. So what’s the point of making it through this whole thing without even living? The whole point is, we feel this way for each other and there’s a good chance we both will be dead soon. Why not try then?
“POTTER!” Draco yelled so loud the several people stuck their heads out of other cars to see what was the matter.
“I kept thinking about it, you could’ve easily kidnapped him, or let the Death Eaters in but you didn’t. Voldemort wanted you to do something but none of us knew what it was, he sent you on some sort of quest and Harry trusted you enough never to pry. He assumed you were just going to ignore Voldemort and then go into hiding with Snape or the order eventually. But I don’t think that’s true either.” She said everything in a rush, making broad gestures with her hands all the while. Now Draco knew why Granger had continued to beat him year after year in every single class. She was a bloody genius.
“Is that the…” Harry trailed off in horror, head shaking quickly. “No, no it’s fake right. You're not actually one of them?” Draco didn’t know what to say, he yanked his arm out of Harry’s grasp and pushed his sleeve down. Tears were already springing to his eyes, and his heart was cold with horror.
“To bring back favor, for our family. And you need to take the dark mark, so the dark lord knows he can trust you.” Draco thought he had known terror before, but nothing compared to the way his stomach plummeted in this instance. His chest grew tight at the look on his mother’s face. What would happen to her if he didn’t take it and carry out the dark lord’s plan?
“I didn’t do anything!” Draco said angrily. And it was true. All he had said was that the Slytherins could go ahead and sing they’re stupid song.
“Fine. Whatever, come along then. You can carry him, I have this.” He held up the bag of potions. Severus raised an eyebrow.
“Right.” Together the three of them walked onto the train. Pansy and Draco waved to Theo as they slid into the Prefect’s compartment. Draco bounced his knee up and down as he waited for the signal that they could go sit with their friends. He needed to find Luna and tell her what had happened. Not what had actually happened obviously, but bits and pieces to explain his disappearance over the summer. Weasley and Granger kept glancing at him, and he started to get rather annoyed by it. Why did they always have to stare at him like he was some sort of puzzle that needed piecing together? He was not a puzzle. He was a death eater in love with Harry Potter. Once the headboy and girl had come to tell them they could leave, Draco leapt up and hurried out the compartment door. He had to find Luna. Would she be with Theo and Blaise or...Potter. She was probably with Potter, because Ginevra was there. And now wherever Ginevra went, Luna went. Muttering under his breath he stalked down the train, looking left and right until he could find Luna. Finally he skidded to a stop when he spotted them. Luna, Ginevra, Longbottom, and Potter. Obviously. Luna was swinging Ginevra’s hand back and forth, yet she did not look blissfully happy. She was chewing her bottom lip and kept glancing out the window. Draco stood there for a few more moments, wondering exactly what he should do when she turned her head and realized he was there. Her eyes widened and she quickly flew out of her seat and shut the compartment door behind her. He had a second to view everyone’s confused glances, and Potter’s flushed face, before Luna yanked him down the hall.
“I know you found the answer! Okay, but that doesn't matter now because what if-” A sob escaped her and she left the room. A door slammed upstairs. What if you die?
“Fucking Ron.” She muttered under her breath. Damn. She must be really pissed at the Weasel. Draco shared her sentiment. She yanked her shoes off angrily and rubbed at her eyes with her forearm. Draco turned to leave but Granger stopped him.
Draco folded the letter carefully and placed it among the ever growing stack in his box. Shaking slightly he took out his wand and whispered “Diminuendo.”
I’d like to blame you for nearly having my arm chopped off by a Hippogriff. I mean I was just copying what you did after all. I followed all the instructions and in return my arm nearly got taken off. I’m not writing because I haven’t seen you in days, I’m bored. That’s really all. It’s not like I expected you to come visit so that we could-nevermind. Anyway the Hippogriff lesson was rather interesting wasn’t it? Crabbe and Goyle didn’t really think so, but I did. And I’m not jealous that you got to ride the Hippogriff (look at the state of me I probably would’ve died on the bloody thing), but that did look rather fun. Well I suppose the whole Sirius Black ordeal is not such a big deal after all if they’re letting us go into the Forbidden Forest for lessons. I do wonder why they’ve brought the dementors on though. They seem to be bothering most. Poor Luna, she gets in the right state whenever we walk past them. Won’t tell me what’s up though. Not that I blame her. They make you hear some downright awful stuff. I better go, Madam Pomfrey is giving me dirty looks for not resting.
I should have expected this from you. You truly do have the most insane hero complex. You’re the bloodiest Gryffindor in the history of Gryffindor. I don’t really know what to say here anymore. Everytime I think you’re going to die I get all panicked and it fucking sucks. I don’t want to care about you Potter. I want to be able to live my Potter free life. Instead I have to worry about you and whether or not you’re finally going to die. I wish more than anything that this world could be normal and I could wrap my arms around you. I wish that you weren’t Harry Potter and I wasn’t Draco Malfoy. I wish we were just too normal boys and we could fall in love without having to worry about tournaments and blood purity, and the stupid dark lord. Screw all of this. I want to be your boyfriend. What has befallen me? Why have I been cursed to think about you all day long. Why? I don’t have anything else to say. I guess I’m glad you didn’t die.
Draco nearly fell down the stairs on his way out of the Leaky Cauldron. His entire body was practically vibrating with excitement. He, Draco Malfoy, was going to Muggle London. Although he was excited it felt terribly inappropriate to be so. After all, everyone else in the Wizarding World was busy fighting a war, and what was he doing? He was completely useless. So far he had only managed to escape his own home, and even then Severus had caught him leaving! He would make a bloody terrible spy. He had no idea how Severus managed. Sneaking around was quite the hassle.
“There’s food and water downstairs.” he said softly, looking back and forth between the two letters. One was from Luna, and the other was from Theo. He and Theo were good friends, but they didn’t really write to each other much over the summer. He decided to open the one from Luna first.
“That’s fine mum.” he said, suppressing a sigh. What were his parents doing all of the time? His father barely talked to him anymore, except to nag him about his grades. And his mother...his mother loved him, he knew that much. But nowadays she was always looking over her shoulder and staring at Draco as if he might disappear any second. It was quite a bit frightening to be perfectly honest. He missed the days when she was carefree and would laugh when he made a silly face of some sort.
“Luna told me, trust me. She knows what she’s talking about.” Ginny nodded seriously at him. Draco couldn’t help breaking into a grin and shaking his head.
“Single handed…” Potter repeated. Draco felt Potter’s breath on his cheek and every single thought about Sirius Black vanished from his head. Focus, he had to...Draco moved his foot slightly and it touched Potter’s under the table. He felt himself flush but made no move to pull his foot away. He wasn’t going to be the first one to do so. From the corner of his eye he saw Potter start to turn red as well, but he still didn’t move his foot. Draco turned and pretended to busy himself with Potions ingredients while really studying him. He gazed at the tousled black hair, and bright green eyes, the way he was biting his lip. Potter was...was- Oh Merlin’s pants. He was beautiful.
“Well that’s a load of bullshit.” Draco said, thinking about how his father would’ve loved that rule. Wait a minute. Had he actually said that to her face? That was a terrible idea.
Draco blinked. He wondered what was going on with her. Most likely it had something to do with Harry and Weasley, though something about that felt off.
Draco swept his eyes over the shop and his eyes settled over the old magic wardrobe. This was the same one Montague had disappeared through, right?
Ginny laughed and shook her head. “You have no idea.” She sat up suddenly, looking Draco dead in the eye.
“Don’t think about that.” Harry said hastily with a shake of his head. “We can’t get through this if we’re worrying about-that.”
“We never use transfiguration as a punishment!” Mcgonagall was saying, her brows were drawn together in frustration. Draco was too distracted by the fact that he was leaning against Potter to care what they were saying. He vaguely heard the words “detention” and “Snape”, but his and Potter’s hands had somehow become interlocked. And neither of them were letting go. He could feel his heart pounding in his throat as he stared at their hands clasped together.
I thought you were dragon food. I thought the dragon was going to eat you and I would never get to see you again. I am thoroughly embarrassed of how I behaved while you were stuck in the arena with that dragon. I was sitting with Luna and Theo (Pansy and Blaise were off somewhere sucking face, it was rather an unpleasant sight to witness but that’s besides the point) and now I suspect Theo knows something is very very wrong with me. And, well, the dragon singed you. So I began screaming my bloody head off. Luna tried tugging on my sleeve to snap me out of it but I legitimately thought you were going to die. I have thought this many times before but never have I had to think I was going to actually watch you die. I may or may not have started sobbing. I hate you for making me feel this way, Potter. I wish I could go back to the days when I hated you, but now that I truly think about it, I don’t think I ever did. I’ve never hated you, and I don’t think I can. I mean I hate you for turning me into a love struck idiot. But I don’t actually hate you. This is all very complicated and I wish that I could forget all about you. I’m going to go drown in my own sorrows now.
“Nevermind.” She said, probably noticing his pained expression. “It doesn’t matter right now. We shouldn’t be standing in the middle of the street.” She jerked her head and pointed towards a small building, with fading bricks. “We’re here.”
“There is not much room between the spaces of hating and loving one another.” She said simply. That was some metaphorical bullshit if Draco had ever heard any.
“What...I don’t understand. I need to get out of here.” Abruptly he sprung off the couch and practically ran out the door. Draco made to follow him but the door already slammed shut, nearly hitting Draco in the face. His head was reeling, what did that mean? Fuck. He should’ve told Harry before they got so far. Maybe if he had told him...what? He wouldn’t have been pissed? Of course he would have. Draco was a death eater for Merlin’s sake.
“Don’t say that.” She shook her head. “It wasn’t a mistake and you know it.” Draco didn’t know what to say to that so he didn’t say anything. After a beat she placed her head gently on his shoulder.
“It will be, we’ll make sure of it. We’ll be so careful no one will know I swear.” Draco said, nodding his head.
“Ah, yes.” Came his father’s cool voice. “Someone indeed.”  A bead of cold sweat trickled down his back. He felt nauseated. He had never realized how much he hated his father’s voice. How much he hated his father in general actually.
Hello! So I was super bored over the summer and I never have time to write fanfiction once school picks up, and I decided to try and write one now. Because why not. I like drarry, I like fanfiction. Anyway I wrote this thing. And it's like 7 or 8 chapters long. I don't want to give too much away but I don't really know how to describe this. I mean there's drarry? And love? And letters that Draco writes? Lemme try again.
He opened his mouth to ask when he would see him again, but Harry had already left him standing alone, hidden behind the curtain. He blew out a slightly frustrated breath and left the curtains after counting to ten.
“Bye Harry.” he whispered back. It was the first time he had called him that to his face. Harry blinked, before a slow smile spread over his face.
“I suppose.” she slipped out from a suit of armor, making quite a lot of noise as all of it crashed to the floor.
“You can’t?” Was the only thing that came out of his mouth. And damn him. He sounded hopeful. Because he was damnit. He was so hopeful that Potter had actually enjoyed the kiss.
“Yes, no, not worse. He just won’t be happy with me for letting Granger get so far ahead and all.” Draco shrugged like it was no big deal, even though it actually was.
“No, no not yet. Dumbledore has fled the castle it seems.” Severus gazed at Draco with an expression that he was unable to read. Fled the castle...What the bloody hell was going on?
After a flick of Harry’s wand, and a loud pop, they were gone. Draco nearly fell on top of Harry as they appeared in Muggle London.
“Was, Malfoy.” Spat Weasley. He opened his mouth and raised his wand, he was going to curse Draco. Shit, shit. Think of a spell, you’re not this stupid come on.
It wasn’t until the next day that Draco realized something had happened. Once again he was flopped on the floor of the library when he saw Snape angrily storm past outside from the window. He sat up. A moody Snape beat laying here feeling sorry miserable. He found Snape in his office, bitterly making some sort of potion.
“Cedric Diggory was not killed!” Umbridge’s voice was high, and she almost sounded scared. “His death was merely a tragic accident, you’re just innocent children who know nothing of the real-”
Ginny gasped and clapped a hand over her mouth. “Merlin...I’m going to get towels Luna.” She sprinted off in the other direction, as Luna approached Hermione.
“She did not leave the house again. Tell me she did not leave without one of us again.” She said, her lips pressed tightly together.
“Oh, sorry. Should I tell you about the wards now in case…” she trailed off and Draco didn’t catch what she meant until her eyes filled with tears and she closed her eyes.
Nothing’s terribly wrong just yet so don’t panic. But I’ve begun to worry. I’ve been exchanging letters with Pansy and Blaise and both have said their parents have told them that they’re currently in service to the dark lord. My parents won’t tell me anything. I think they’re trying to convince me that the dark lord isn’t actually back, but I know better. I fear both of my parents have returned to serve the dark lord Draco. And I’m scared to think of what will happen to them. My mum used to tell me about how she regretted ever taking part in all that in the beginning, so I don’t understand why they decided to go back. I didn’t mean to write about this for so long. What I really wanted to tell you was that I’m bisexual. I figured it out this summer and I told Pansy and I wanted to tell you too. I’ll probably tell Blaise soon as well. That was all, I hope your summer isn’t completely terrible.
He searched for the right words but found there wasn’t really anything to say. She was right after all. They weren’t learning anything, the dark lord was back, and they couldn’t do anything about it.
“The dark lord.” Pansy drew in a shallow breath. “That’s what they’re saying, the dark lord...he’s back.” If it was somehow possible, Draco started to feel even worse.
“Harry?” Granger called. The warmth of his hands vanished, but not before giving Draco’s shoulder a squeeze.
Draco apparated in front of Grimmauld place and fell to his knees panting. A dawning realization hit him. Hermione and Luna were still in the Ministry. All of a sudden a weight was being pressed down on his chest, and tears leaked from the corner of his eyes. They were still in there, they had left them there. Without meaning to, he began rocking back and forth, trying to get a grip on himself. He was fine. He should be getting inside and discussing a plan. Not vibrating on the front steps. He wasn’t helping anyone, he was a fucking failure.
A couple days later something extraordinary, and puzzling, happened to him. He was in charms and Flitwick decided that now was a good time for some interhouse bonding.
“We can argue about this later.” Draco broke in, it suddenly hit him what this might mean. “What happened when you went to the address?”
“Whose dead Harry?” Hermione tried to get him to come into the classroom they had just left, but he tugged his arm out of her grip. He was shaking, Draco realized. His hands were clenching and unclenching and he continued to rub his nails against the skin of his thumbs.
Draco felt something icy brush against his insides. That was true. He had never thought about that before. Someone should’ve noticed when an 11 year old girl was possessed and wandering around the castle covered in blood at odd hours. A newfound admiration for Ginny Weasley sprung up inside him.
“We can fight for fucks sake!” She yelled frantically. Even through the pain Draco could hear that her voice was thick with tears.
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for this to happen. It was all supposed to work out. I used to think I was an okay person but now I think I must be a monster. I caused all of this. And I don’t see how I can fix it. But I’m going to try. I haven’t seen you. I’ve tried, believe me. It’s rather that there are death eaters all over my house these days and I don’t know how to get past them. I’m going to though. I’m not going to stop until you’re out of here safely and you’re safe for good. I don’t know much about what’s going on, though I’ve heard bits and pieces. Mother doesn’t want to tell me anything. I’ve barely talked to anyone in days, I can’t complain I know. I’m sure you have it much worse. I better go. I have to think of some sort of solution. And Harry, for what it’s worth, I do love you.
“He’s dead.” Harry croaked, his eyes glassed over, not looking at either of them. His expression was vacant, haunted.
That night he sat in the common room, moping. He had to go on patrol in a couple minutes but he couldn’t bring himself to get ready. He wanted to stay here and think about how one of his closest friends had traded him for Potter. Luna hadn’t even ridden in the carriage with him.
“Heyyy.” Harry complained, tugging at his arm playfully. Draco pretended he didn’t see the shadows in his eyes as he said it.
“Is it true? Is he really staying at your house?” she asked in a hoarse whisper. Draco stiffened, then nodded quickly.
In the chaos Draco took the chance to sprint after them, dodging curses all the while. He watched as Harry and Ginny were pulled into the fireplace, and disappeared. Where were Hermione and Luna? He wanted to stay and find them, but he knew that if he stayed there wouldn’t be any hope for him. He would be captured and sent to Azkaban, where he would be of no help to anyone. Among the curses, he apparated out of the ministry. Dear Merlin he hoped he didn’t splinch himself.
“Sorry.” Hermione didn’t look very sorry in Draco’s opinion. He noticed the shadows under her eyes were more prominent than they had been before. She didn’t look like she had slept at all.
“Yeah. My letters.” He gritted his teeth and glared at Harry. How could he? How could he read every single one of those letters? He must’ve been asleep for a while, if he had had time to read all of them. Harry had grown so pale his lips had started to go white.
“My father sent it to me so he could prove to me just how small Weasley’s house was.” Draco said suddenly. It was an awful thing to say, he was well aware. And his father had sent a note making fun of the Weasley family, but Draco had never intended to bring that to light.
“That’s great Harry!” Granger said enthusiastically. She already had a stack of pillows on her desk. Potter gave him a sideways glance.
Harry placed his hands on the table next to Draco’s and smiled. Draco had never noticed Harry had a dimple on his right cheek. Without thinking Draco entwined their fingers together, grinning.
Normally I make it a lot longer without writing to you. But unfortunately this summer was different. However hard I may try I cannot seem to think of anything else besides you. I am still half convinced that I am dying from some sort of illness you have cursed me with. I mean as you are well aware we have been enemies since as long as we have known each other. And I obviously still despise you. It’s simply that now this strange fluttering feeling arises inside of me when I think of you. It’s rather terrifying if I’m being perfectly honest. I can’t stop thinking about you and some absolutely insane part of me wants to believe that wherever you are, you’re thinking of me too. However on the other hand I absolutely loathe you and the very ground you walk on. You must have cursed me to this terrible fate because it brings you joy to watch me suffer so. And this truly is suffering believe me. Can you even begin to fathom what it is like to think about someone all damn day and have this stupid sickening feeling always swirling in your stomach? And worst of all this weird warmth that creeps into every part of you and spreads to your face by mention of your name. You have done this to me Potter. This is all your fault. Even though for some deranged reason I find you attractive, I shall forever feel nauseous by the very mention of your name.
“Of course my lord.” He tried nodding to make it seem more convincing. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see his mother shaking. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears.
“Fuck.” A shaky voice had his eyes opening slowly. Draco groaned and sat up. Why had he decided to sit on the floor? The couch was right next to him, but no, he had practically collapsed on the floor. Draco stretched a little and yawned. His vision was still blurry from sleep. There was a figure holding something in front of him, a box it looked like. He shook his head a little and stood shakily.
“Oh, er-yes of course.” Draco didn’t mention that he had no bloody idea how to make coffee. He’d never even watched someone do it. The two girls left the room and Draco wandered into the kitchen, feeling discouraged. He was useless. Merlin he couldn’t even make coffee. How was he going to help rescue Harry when he couldn’t even get them energized to do so? Draco began opening random drawers, hoping he would find coffee beans. Or grounds. Did one have to ground coffee beans before they made them into coffee? Could he perhaps get away with transfigurating water into coffee? Draco was contemplating doing just that when Ginny and Luna sprinted back into the room, their eyes wide with fear.
“Er...This way.” Harry pointed a finger in the direction of a small cafe. Draco frowned. Why on earth were they going into a cafe? He had assumed they were supposed to be doing something productive.
“I obliviated him, yes. It doesn’t matter anymore so there’s really nothing to say about the whole matter. I don’t know why you even brought him up, it’s not like I bloody care!” Draco babbled, unable to stop the words from falling out of his mouth. Severus took a step back, as if the rush of emotion was too much for him to be around. Draco was horrified to find tears leaking from the corner of his eyes. Shite. Yet he couldn’t move. He should’ve sprinted out of the room as soon as the tears started falling but the only thing he could seem to do was stand there, shaking. He ran an unsteady hand through his hair and tried to breathe. Severus stood there for a beat before placing an unsure hand on his shoulder.
“It just said Severus on it.” Draco cocked his head, confused. Severus...why would his name be on a coin?
“That day. In the corridor.” Draco sucked in a shallow breath and wished he could see Potter’s face. He wanted to know just how close he was to him. Draco took an uncertain step forward.
“Give it a few minutes, then we can talk.” Leaning back in her seat she began to chatter on about random meaningless things. Some fake job (he assumed), getting her drivers license finally, classes she was going to register for this coming fall. Draco could hardly follow a word of what she was saying. He really should’ve taken Muggle studies. After a waitress came for their orders, the pair of them ordered cappuccinos, and Draco raised the steaming liquid to his lips. He nearly choked as the piping hot coffee ran down his throat and through his chest.
Tom opened his mouth, and Draco sensed that he was about to ask what his last name was, however he abruptly shut it and shook his head.
That same day Severus left and they were alone again. The five of them were in the living room, warming themselves by the fire.The heat made him feel sick. Draco was listening to everyone talk about founding Weasley, he didn’t have the heart to participate in the conversation. It wasn’t like he ever came up with any good ideas. Harry and Hermione kept giving each other side glances, as if they knew something that the rest of them didn’t. After what must have been the fifth side glance Ginny exploded on the pair of them.
Harry looked torn for a brief moment before speaking again. “Alright, but I don’t want him in the room when I tell you guys.” He jerked his head towards Draco. He felt as if he was being stabbed in the chest over and over again.
“Yeah Cedric was our friend and You-Know-Who killed him!” Justin Finch Fletchley said, his eyes bright and glistening.
“You really think she would dance with me? I thought she fancied Harry.” What. She couldn’t possibly still fancy Potter. That had been two years ago.
“I can’t believe her! She knows people who died in the first war for goodness sake! More people are going to die no matter what, and-and-”
“It’s alright, I know he’s terrible, believe me. Where are we going?” He was desperate to move on from the subject of his father. It always made him feel icy and slightly sick inside. Memories of long lectures about Muggleborns and bloody purity poked at his head. He shook himself a little, as if that would help get his head clear.
“Hello?” Came a shaky voice. Draco nearly fell to his knees. In hindsight it shouldn’t have shaken him so much. He hadn’t been gone that long. Yet something in Harry’s voice caused something in Draco to unravel.
His hands crept into Potter’s hair and he ran his fingers through it, loving the softness of it. There was no such thing as time anymore, they kissed for so long they didn’t even know the darkening shadows outside. They stopped when they heard a meowing noise nearby.
It’s risky of me to send this. But when haven’t I been doing insanely risky things in the past couple weeks? I’m sorry I chastised you for sending me a letter. I understand now that you were desperate, as I am now. It’s not so much that I am in need of your help, actually I think we’re making excellent progress at the moment. It’s that, well, I need someone to talk to. I used to think we had nothing in common, though clearly I was sorely mistaken. I realized how much you were keeping to yourself for years, and I wish I had been there for you to confide in. I know you haven’t agreed to be my listening ear, but I am going to ask you too anyway. I’m so fucking lonely Draco. I don’t know what’s happening to me. I didn’t tell you this, but I obliviated my parents, so they would be safe. Very similar to what happened with you and Harry. I can’t really tell anyone else this because they won’t understand. They can be sympathetic of course, yet no one will really know the agony that everyday life has become. I tried to be a good daughter. However something says I just messed up everything even more. If my parents ever do get their memories back, will they even love me anymore? I took everything from them, how could they ever forgive me? This, this is the reason I can’t stop doing dangerous things. Because what does all of it matter anymore? Some days I feel so much I can’t breathe, and most days I feel nothing at all. I feel nothing, and then I feel everything. I don’t think I’m doing well, Draco. But I don’t get to complain. My parents are safe, and at the moment so am I. That’s enough feeling sorry for myself for now. How are you faring? You lot are safe right? Don’t try to meet up with us, I think we’ve decided it’s best to split up so we can get horcruxes killed faster. I believe Ron is going to meet up with us soon. I’m rather excited about that. Even though you haven’t replied yet I do feel a bit better. Just knowing you’re reading this brings me quite a bit of comfort. You’re a good friend Draco, and for what it’s worth, you were a really good boyfriend to Harry too. Take care of yourself.
Fuck. So he had nothing. Except an imposing death sentence that was ever approaching as the days continued mournly.
“So, I think I like you.” It took a shit ton of self control for Draco to not scream and jump up and down. He wanted to fling himself into Potter’s arms and cry. Harry Potter liked him.
“You will take the mark.” It was not a question, and every word was drawn out extremely slowly, as if he was daring Draco to say no.
“We’ll be okay.” Hermione sounded slightly hysterical. It wasn’t a question. As if she merely stated the words that would make them true. Harry’s hesitation was enough to bring tears to her eyes.
You’re a bloody idiot. I can’t believe I wanted to be friends with you, you’re so bloody stupid. You actually fell for the duel. Do you want to get expelled? It’s annoying how many rules you can break without getting expelled. You should’ve been expelled by now, I hope you know that. Even though we’re enemies I don’t want you to be expelled. You’re my worst enemy. Who am I going to compete with once you're gone? I couldn’t stand it if I actually had to talk to Granger, or Merlin forbid...Weasel. So you have to stick around, and don’t get expelled. Please. Anyway I hate you. A ton.
“Oh, I’m sorry we just didn’t want anyone else to be put in danger.” Harry said with a sheepish shrug.
“This-this is so…” Potter trailed off and Draco noticed how close they were. How close their hands were. Without thinking he threaded his fingers through Potter’s and relished in how warm his hands were. How their fingers fit perfectly together. How Potter’s hand was rough against his smooth one.
“Stop this immediately.” Draco felt as if he had been punched in the stomach. Stop. This. Immediately. But it had not even begun.
“Right!” She had gotten to her feet and started pacing the room. “So think about it! Something from ravenclaw most definitely, and then his stupid snake I guess.” She shrugged, eyes glinting with pleasure.
“I…” Hermione began, then shook her head and sat on a stool. “Okay so I know it’s going to sound insane.”
I wonder what you heard to make you pass out. I don’t care that you passed out. Obviously I could care less what you were doing on the train ride over, I was just wondering why you passed out and none of the rest of us did. We were all terrified out of our minds to be sure, but we didn’t pass out. I’m not quite sure why Sirius Black’s breakout requires all the extra precautions. I mean if it’s really such a big deal why not have us stay home with our parents? See, I can add this to the list of reasons why I despise Dumbledore. Anyway, you're no fun to fight with when you’re pale and moody. So feel better soon please. I hate you.
