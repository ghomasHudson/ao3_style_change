“I just know. I can’t explain it, but I know. I do know him, Neville. If we take him to Mungo’s and he recovers, and everyone finds out, they’ll take everything from him. He won’t have anything left. Draco wouldn’t want to live like that.”

“I’m so sorry, I didn’t know. If you need to leave…”
“What?”
“No, you weren’t.”
Harry placed a soothing hand on his arm, gently extracting the offending mug from his grip and handing it back to its bewildered owner.
So Draco – thoughts filled with of tactics and strategies to suggest – was barely aware of his surroundings as he wandered languidly over to his teammates. He was considering calling out to them when suddenly he was jolted from his pleasant reverie by a loud jeering noise coming from behind him.
“Anyway,” said Harry, expression stern once more, “That’s my answer. I’ve been honest with you – which is probably more than you deserve. It’s your turn now, and you’d better be convincing. You owe me that at the very least. By rights, I should have hauled your idiot arse straight in last night.”
“So I keep on reminding him.”
in his bloodstream and leaving the muscles in his legs twitching with the sudden urge to run. Unable to suppress it, Draco jumped off the bed, twisting his hands painfully in front of him as he paced back and forth across the room. After spending so much of his early life powerless, tossed about like a leaf on the wind at the whim of his family and then the Dark Lord, Draco had relished the feeling of control that the

? Am I right? Were you on it already, all those years ago, the first time I came to the shop?”
Guiltily, she looked back up at him. The fringes stilled. “I’m quite well, thank you,” she replied, her clipped voice betraying the lie. Draco remained quiet, examining her face, until she lowered her wine glass, tapping her finger lightly against the bowl.
Potter himself was a different matter – those green eyes and easy smile crept into Draco’s mind all too often these days, in the bright, fragmented way that was the only way he could reflect on anything while on

“What, sobriety? Oh, great fun.” Harry’s brows furrowed at the careless reply, and Draco hastened to clarify. “No, it’s – I’m good. I haven’t taken a potion or had a drink now in―” He thought for a second. “Six months, three weeks and six days.”
“It’s – I –?” is all Draco manages, before he visibly composes himself. “Thank you. You look good, too.”
To be honest, Harry didn’t really.
As it turned out, Lee
Things wound down rather quickly from there. Harry’s teammates called out sleepy farewells before Apparating home, and one by one, the Unspeakables began to do the same. Harry stood awkwardly off to the side, watching Malfoy chat away blithely to the
“I’m surprised that you’d come by. I’ve seen Harry and Ron lately, I’ve walked by your shop, and I got your letter, of course. I guess I just – well, it’s thoughtful of you to visit Garrick, after everything. You heard about his illness, I suppose?”
Harry breathes in, hard, trying to reason with himself. It’s too difficult, though, with Draco so close; after everything that’s happened over the past hour. So he stops thinking – stops worrying – and says what he’s needed to say from the moment he saw Draco leaning against their old front steps.

Time bent and warped again before his eyes; seconds becoming hours as a hundred different scenarios ran simultaneously through his mind.

He found that he was able to concentrate for longer, to hold down conversations better, to walk out into wizarding London without starting to hyperventilate and having to Apparate home. He began regaining some of the weight he’d lost – the pads of his cheeks filling out again, his ribs no longer so unattractively prominent – and regular sleep helped his skin lose its sallow, ashy appearance. Two weeks spent mostly in bed had left him wheezing like an old man and his weakened calf muscles complaining bitterly the first time he climbed the stairs to his flat, but busy shop work and lunchtime walks quickly set him right. He even visited Dean at Ollivanders, and they made tentative plans to go flying together.
“Oh great, you’re back!” she said cheerfully, a little too loud. “As you can see, we’re awake now.”

At 3 p.m., as agreed, the entrance hall Floo flared, and Neville Longbottom tumbled out onto the hearth. He brushed his clothes off and straightened up, looking around apprehensively. Neville had grown taller – almost as tall as Draco – since Draco had last seen him. He wore his sandy blond hair short, his round face had sharpened out at the edges, and there was a few days’ worth of stubble on his chin. Draco had the overall impression of a calm, self-assured, and not unattractive young man, with no remaining hint of the awkward adolescent he had been at school. He was wearing Muggle clothes: a fitted royal blue sweater over grey trousers, and his expression was inscrutable as he turned to look at Draco.
“No, when I look at it now I’m concerned that it’s going to eat me. I’m not sure that’s any better.”
and Harry’s heating charms, they rested in comfortable silence. Harry let his head droop forwards against the broom handle, watching as a tiny dark shadow below – a pipistrel – swooped in neat, tight circles in and out of the trees. His exhaustion was bone-deep, their surroundings too dreamlike, and he allowed himself to grow dazed and stuporous as he drifted through this endless, shining, magical night with Malfoy beside him. Malfoy, who’d been sneaking into Harry’s office and sharing snacks with him for nearly a year now. Malfoy, who never seemed to answer Harry’s questions seriously, who had an endless supply of funny anecdotes, but who – until tonight – had clearly and deliberately held something of himself back. Malfoy, who Harry could never stop thinking about – hadn’t been able to since the very first day he’d walked through the door. Was Harry a fool, reading so much into all Malfoy’s behaviour today? Always, he’d joked earlier –
“Gay? Yes. Obviously.” Draco frowned. “It was fairly common knowledge in Slytherin. I must say,” he added, with a mock pout, “although I didn’t shout it from the Astronomy Tower, I’m a bit miffed that no one in Gryffindor was even

reporters were watching the both of them intensely, heads cocked to the side none-too-subtly: clearly, they were using eavesdropping devices.
“I see what you mean.”
“People had been ignoring it for years, because they were scared of him. I… we, Robards and I, could see how dangerous he was, but so far as we could tell he hadn’t done anything strictly
Draco shook his head.
With one last glance back in the mirror (“truly exquisite!”), he headed towards his bathroom, feet gliding smoothly across the floor. His robes might have been perfect, but there were still plenty of things that could go wrong. If ever an occasion called for an extra dose of good luck, it was this one.

, badly, his skin crawling and his palms sweating. He focussed on his breathing like his Mind Healer had taught him, trying not to shiver when he felt the occasional brush of heat from the edge of a warming charm, or caught a glimpse of soft curls blown about by the wind.
Potter shifted a fraction. He wet his lips. Deliberately, almost imperceptibly, without taking his eyes off Draco, he drew his knees apart.
A shadow fell on Draco, but still, he couldn’t look up. He relaxed his fingers, unwinding the feather, attempting to keep his voice steady. “I really care about you, and I’m only sorry it took me so long to realise that. To understand. So I wonder…” Draco finally looked up at Harry, warmth pooling in his gut as their eyes met “…could we go back to being friends? I’d like that. Turns out I… I’ve really missed you.”
“Everything’s changed, Harry. How could things stay the same once I started to remember what we were like? How much I looked forward to seeing you each week? How kind you were with Lee? The way you… the way you looked at me?”
It didn’t take long for Harry to spy the Snitch, flaring gold in the sunlight just above a cluster of beech trees. Harry drifted steadily closer, body tense, keeping a wary eye out for the flash of silver-white which would surely follow as Malfoy cottoned on to his change in direction. But no – Malfoy didn’t move from his own position hovering above the Unspeakables’ hoops, apparently nattering away to their Keeper. Harry allowed his speed to increase as he neared the Snitch. He approached it from above, his preferred technique. The air was still today, so still that Harry could almost hear those tiny wings beating. A burst of adrenaline flooded his body, and with a huge grin he dropped easily into a rolling dive, the gasps of the spectators echoing in his ears as he pulled up with the little golden ball clutched tightly in his grasp. As the score down below changed to reflect his catch, he flew a celebratory lap, fist held high, right over the roaring crowd.
“Talking to me?” demanded Draco, irritated. “What on earth are you
“I know what everyone thinks of me, Potter. That’s why I don’t usually go out,” Draco said quietly, shaking his left arm, which was now tingling as though trapped in a vice.
Harry snorted, stopping just next to the body on the floor. “I’m sure I can handle it, Hermione. After all, it’s just
“So what d’you get up to around here, anyway?”
Lee regarded the chair with undisguised distaste. She reached for Draco’s hand, grasping it tightly in hers.

Neville looked up from the parchment. “You’re―”

It felt like Draco had barely closed his eyes when he was awoken by a sudden, blinding headache, which had him sitting forward and clutching his head in his hands. He was hot –
The breakthrough, when it did arrive, was from a wholly unexpected source. It was late one Friday afternoon, the weak October sun already hidden behind the buildings opposite, when she arrived. Draco was out back, busy putting the finishing touches to a batch of Strengthening Solution, breathing a sigh of relief that the end of another long week was in sight. He heard the door to the shop open and shut, the sharp clacking of stiletto heels on wood, but he paid it no mind, until―

Bare minutes later and they’re out on the balcony, watching the world wake up. It’s so peaceful: cornflower skies still hazy with sleep, car horns and voices floating up from below, a breeze rustling the boulangerie bags strewn across the table. As you watch, Harry leans forward, swiping a gentle thumb over the flakes of croissant still stuck to the corner of young Draco’s lips. Young Draco smiles then, brings his own hands up to Harry’s face, moves to kiss him deeply. He’s only 22, so he’s always ready. Your own strokes are firmer now, and when Harry’s hand trails down to the bulge in your younger self’s shorts you watch him take hold of it, a wicked smile spreading across his face as he guides it under his waistband.
He attempted to pull himself up. Blood rushed to his head, and the edges of his vision began blurring until he laid himself back down, panting. He could hear Leonie downstairs, opening up the shop, and he started to panic. His head was almost in a vice and he was sweaty all over, stuck to the bedsheets. What the hell was he going to do?
Draco forced his eyes shut, willing himself to focus.
They fall silent once more. Draco’s expression is shuttered, inscrutable, as he stares at their old front door; Harry well remembers what that means.
Potter obliged, handing over a single dark strand. Draco placed it in a cauldron, where it made a loud crackling sound and emitted a spicy-sweet smell, like gingerbread fresh from the oven. He stirred it five times clockwise, tipped the thick, sky-blue potion out into a vial and cooled it rapidly with a modified
, he drew his finger in a line straight down Draco’s throat and chest. Draco could only stand stock still, heart pounding, as he felt his robes peel open from the top down, the shimmering fabric split in two. Harry’s eyes widened like he was unwrapping a Christmas gift as Draco’s body was finally uncovered.
Potter tensed, his knuckles turning white where they gripped the seat beneath him. Not blind then, thought Draco, with a thrill of excitement.

“Yeah, I’m talking to you, Death Eater!”
Harry pulled him closer, kissing the back of his head. “I’m getting the idea.”
“Maybe later, okay? It’s just –” he indicates the carpet before him, which is barely visible now beneath pieces of parchment containing complicated drawings of body parts, textbooks open to gory pictures and coloured cards covered with Draco’s careful handwriting.

, and Draco was suddenly struck with a strong desire not to go back home to his lonely flat, where all he would do was mope around all afternoon. It was too cold out to fly, his usual method of burning off steam. So he grabbed his wand and carefully unstuck a string of bunting from the rafters, nodding gratefully at Hannah when she offered him a coffee.
was, all I could think was – how could anyone blame you for doing what you had to? We might have been on different sides, but we were both motivated by the same thing. Both prepared to do whatever we had to, to defend the people we loved from Voldemort.”
“I bet. Hey, where is the little terror, anyway?”
“Oh, don’t worry about it,” Draco cut in. “It was my fault, I should have known.”
Draco’s wand slipped. A drawer slammed, the noise reverberating through the house. “I
Draco stretched his fingers down towards the glassy surface, leaning further and further forward, getting closer and closer until – yes! Abruptly, gravity took over, his body tumbling uncontrollably over the side. Draco closed his eyes, bracing himself for the cool splash of liquid against his cheeks.

“Five minutes!” called the old wizard in a hoarse voice. Harry groaned, repeating his usual series of stretches and rubbing ineffectually at his screaming calf muscles, barely even noticing the cries of the witches getting louder as he bent forwards. But when he finally stood up again, he
“What? What did I say?”
Neville chuckled, looking a little brighter for the first time that day. “Nope. Sorry to disappoint.”
Oh, Merlin. “Potter, I―”
“All right, then.” She stepped back, all business once more, reaching under the counter and pulling out his wand. She swished it around a bit, expression wistful. “I’ve kept it safe for you. God, you have no idea how much I wanted one of these growing up.” She gave it one last ineffectual wave before huffing a laugh and throwing it across to Draco.

“You know it.”

, Draco found, was particularly enjoyable. The ease with which he was able to indulge in all his fantasies, free of nagging guilt and shame, was a welcome change. Without a second thought, he reached down, took himself in hand and let his eyes flutter closed under the spray of the shower. He braced himself against the tile with the other hand, a soft moan drowned out by the running water, as images of Potter in his lab assaulted his senses, brought to him in perfect clarity courtesy of

“All right.” Harry took a flannel from the sink and ran it under the tap. Draco opened his mouth to protest but recognised the futility of even attempting and closed it again after a few seconds. He caught sight of Harry watching him as he wrung the excess liquid out.
“Oh,” breathed Harry, glazed eyes coming back into focus, gaze darting rapidly over Draco’s face. “Oh,” he repeated, brow furrowed. “And since?”
“Oh, hello, Draco! It’s
“’Course,” said Draco, “it wasn’t great the time he caught me. Shouted at me in front of the whole House, wrote to my father, and gave me a week’s worth of detention to boot. It was so terrifying that – did you notice? – two years after the man’s death, I’m still checking that he’s not behind me before I do an impression of him.”
“Draco. He was really into you, for years. I mean, he spent six months working on reforming the laws about interrogation and fair use of Veritaserum – on top of his Auror training – because he was so upset by the way you’d been treated. That’s not something you do for just anyone.”
Maybe playing a Quidditch match while sober was a good place to start.

on the back – but declined point-blank to wear robes, pointing out that her mother never wore them at work or at home.
Draco, too, recalled the order by heart. The Aurors guarding the Ministry holding cells had thoroughly enjoyed providing daily updates on the fate of each one of their former associates. Draco still remembered being read the
“I don’t know,” Draco said after a while, voice small and worn. “It’s just – it’s not how I remember it, I suppose. Or,” he looked up at Harry, eyes shining in the dark, “maybe it is, and that’s worse?” Harry wound a comforting arm around him. The cold was seeping into his thighs from where they touched the stone steps and he shivered, pulling Draco close against his side and handing over the ice cream stick for him to finish off.
how much I wanted―”
“Yes?”
When he first realised he’d developed a bit of a crush on Malfoy, he hadn’t been alarmed. It wasn’t the first time he’d found a co-worker attractive; at least in Malfoy’s case half the Ministry seemed to agree with him. He still didn’t much fancy hearing Ron’s opinion on the matter though, so he kept the details of Malfoy’s little visits to himself – and for some weird reason, he got the impression that Malfoy did too.

Draco huffed a soft laugh. It wasn’t a lie.

Draco kept his eyes closed. The hand on his head was gentle and kind, thumb stroking through the stubble of his hair. He’d like to stay here. This seemed like a nice place to be.
With a nod and a sharp crack, Harry was gone. Draco was left staring in his wake, heart pounding, thoughts still confused and disjointed. His legs carried him shakily over to his bed, and the only reasonable course of action left to him – drinking Firewhisky, straight from the bottle, until unconsciousness rose up to claim him.
Hannah turned to Neville. “See?”
But things were rapidly heading that way again, he could tell. There was a constant ringing noise in his ears now, and he could barely concentrate on what Harry was saying. The silence stretched out between them. Draco was struggling to sit still, his calves twitching painfully, and he swung his legs back and forth, fighting the overwhelming urge to run to the bathroom for more

“It does. It was.”

up for it. She happily nipped out to grab some Firewhisky – there was no way to avoid alcohol without arousing Pansy’s suspicions, after all – and the three of them ended up (in a much more pleasant rehash of Draco and Pansy’s last meeting) upstairs at the kitchen table. The two girls passed the bottle back and forth, excitedly discussing Pansy’s wedding plans – the ring had been given to her by a Swiss banker named Michel, it turned out – while Draco sipped grumpily at a glass of cordial, belatedly realising his big mistake. If seeing Lee and Hermione together had made him nervous before – well, comparing that to the unholy alliance that was Lee and Pansy was like comparing a Kneazle to a Manticore.
Neville picked up a too-hot bacon rasher with his fingers, cursing and dropping it quickly, and Hannah tutted at him before turning back to Draco. “I know you didn’t have the best night, though. I’m sorry about Susan and Dennis. I don’t think we realised how―”
Harry’s words were soft, and Draco could tell he was smiling. He relaxed slightly, loosening his grip on the railing, working up the courage to turn around.
“George had to remortgage the shop to end up the highest bidder,” said Harry with a grin, “and he still reckons it was worth every Knut.”

“Yep.
Shining green eyes were staring back at Draco, boring into his very soul, it felt like: it was far,
Draco stretches, tipping his head back into Harry’s lap, groaning when Harry tugs at his hair. “It’s – it’s just a lot of effort, Harry. But if it means that much to you, I’ll come.”
Was that going too far? Probably, thought Harry. But Malfoy didn’t look put off; he didn’t even roll his eyes, as Harry had expected. If anything, he swung his broom handle round to move a little closer. His leg was touching Harry’s now; Harry could sense the new pressure against the side of his kneepad, and he glanced down, gaze automatically drawn to the constant shifting movement of Malfoy’s thigh in its tight black leggings as it tensed against the rising wind.
Harry hummed in sympathy, warming his hands on his little Styrofoam cup of Ovaltine as Ron’s rant continued. Behind him, Malfoy was leaning over again, this time touching first one foot and then the other. He really

, but they wouldn’t fetch half their original worth. With the Malfoy vaults emptied by the Ministry – Draco and his mother were surviving on a measly weekly stipend – and the cursed house unlikely to find a buyer so soon after the war, the stark truth seemed to be that the fabled Malfoy fortune was all but gone. As Draco moved around his lab, ignoring the growing knot in the pit of his stomach, he stole occasional glances at the
Draco banged his head lightly against the side of the window frame. “Go away!”
"Ron and Hermione have invited us over for dinner tomorrow, by the way," Draco told him. Harry hummed, turning around in his lover's arms.
"Well, there goes that," Malfoy said, nettled. Harry sighed.
Harry looked down in surprise when he saw his wound seal, his right hand gleaming brightly.
"You're his friend. It wouldn't be right of me to keep you two apart," he said, clearly irritated. Hermione smiled unconsciously.
"It could just be you, Harry," Draco said quietly. "Maybe you just need to stop fighting yourself."
"What would you wear then?" Harry said, turning from side to side, examining the different angles in the mirror.
"Ah!" Draco shrieked as a fake spider fell from mid-air and landed on his nose. "Get it off! Get it off!"
But then something clicked.
"In Transfiguration." Harry had forgotten that Ron was in different classes than him.
"Is that really so bad?" Harry said, winking.
He shook his head and watched as Draco took the bottle and spun it.
"I hope not, Jemma. I really do."
Draco hesitated, before stepping outside the room.
"Look what we've got here."
"Turns out it was Voldemort trying to get the Prophecy through me. He couldn't go to the Ministry himself, and I was the only one who could get it. So he..." Harry's eyes started to well with the tears he was never able to shed. "He sent me a vision, on the day of our last exam that year, of Sirius getting tortured in the Department of Mysteries."
Everything went dark again.
"I got your letter late," Harry explained, leaving out the bit where he had only just gotten up from the bed. It was Sunday! The guy was allowed a break!
"We'll tell you later, please, hurry!" Draco shrieked. Madam Pomfrey took the brunet in her arms and quickly laid him down on the bed, frantically searching through drawers for blood-replacing potions. She found one and shoved it down his throat.
"You can't get rid of me!" he said as she locked the door to her stall. "I will get answers!"
"To be free!"
He was so lost in thought, that he walked straight into a wall. Draco chuckled beside him. "We're here, Harry."
Harry and Draco paused.
When the meeting ended, Harry and Draco went back to Draco's office, feeling shocked and empty.
"I'll be right outside. If I'm not, I'm hiding from Flich."
A throat cleared from the doorway. The two looked back to see Ron standing there, clearly uncomfortable. Hermione got up.
"Because I'm in love with someone who played me and tossed me aside like some broken toy," Ron's voice quietened, his pride dissipating rapidly. "I didn't want to admit it. I didn't. But you can't help you love. No matter how much they hurt you."
Draco abandoned his food and ran to the Hospital Wing. His stomach screamed at him to slow down, but he didn't listen. He needed to know if his Harry was alright.
"I'm not scared, Harry. I'm with you."
When he Apparated back inside him home, he saw Draco sitting on the couch with his head hidden in his hands. The blond looked up when he heart the familiar
"I thought you left your wand outside," Ron said in confusion.
"Tell me about it," Harry responded sadly. The two boys sighed in unison, and Harry became alarmed when Ron started to sob. He began to pat the ginger's back awkwardly and gasped when he was pulled in for a hug.
"Should I wear a gold tie or a red one?"
The next day, they were silent around one another. Draco tried to talk to Harry, but the brunet would just cut him off and change the topic or leave the room. There was something heavy in the air and Draco hated it.
Harry looked at Draco as if he was expecting him to flinch or interrupt. Draco said nothing, however, urging Harry with his eyes to carry on.
"I love you," Draco said, smiling, poking his cheek lightly.
"She's supposedly killing everyone who wronged her right? Maybe she went to her ex-partner, Dylan. It says here the two were married for seven years before Dylan found out about Molly's powers," Malfoy said.
Harry glared at his boyfriend over his shoulder. "They do not!"
"Merlin... this is harder than I thought," Harry said dejectedly. The portrait swung open and Harry and Malfoy gaped at each other.
Hermione and Ron rushed up to them, looking flushed.
"You think I was going to be a dick about what species you were after what happened with Remus?" Harry said, affronted. Draco shrugged delicately.
“Why do you want to know?” Harry asked, eyes narrowing.
The sight he found horrified him to his core.
"Hurts... Draco," he sobbed. Draco looked around helplessly.
”I’m sorry,” he whispered. Draco edged closer to him and crouched down. “Please don’t hurt me. Please...”
"I'm telling you now that you won't find anything!" Jemma said. Harry sighed.
"That would fit!" Harry said in awe. "But where would she have gone?"
A cough made him jerk back, pulling out his wand with narrowed eyes. He flushed when he saw the familiar blond standing in the doorway. Malfoy glared at him.
"So what if I do? I didn't mean for this to happen! I don't want this kind of blood on my hands!" Smith panicked. Draco let out a gasp filled with disgust.
Rob's voice was empty and devoid of emotion. "I know she had DID and took regular medication for it. Lola asked me to keep an eye on her quite a few times when she slipped into the other version of herself. She failed out of Hogwarts because she could never concentrate on her work and was always daydreaming during classes. She didn't have many friends, either. Her husband, Dylan, was abusive towards her and left her after he discovered her magic."
"What makes you think that?" Harry asked defensively, covering the item in question with his hand while staring at the two with suspicious eyes.
"I'm guessing you aren't planning on giving him the address?" Harry guessed. Molly shook her head with glistening eyes.
"I know. It feels like it was only yesterday that we got bonded together!" Harry whispered in awe. Draco nodded, turning on his side to face his boyfriend.
Lavender stood up and made her way over to Draco, who looked apprehensive. The kiss was chaste but not sloppy. When the two pulled away, they looked disgusted with the other. Draco wiped his mouth.
"And what would he have done? Kissed you awake like you're fucking Sleeping Beauty?"
"She's off her nut," Malfoy said, pacing his office with a scowl on his face. Harry watched him from where he was seated on the desk.
"Don't worry about them," Draco whispered once he noticed Harry's anxiety. "Focus on my hand."
"So that must be how the DID developed," Harry mused quietly.
Lavender Brown eagerly took the empty Firewhiskey bottle from Parvati's hand.
"Why not?" the Headmistress asked. "Draco here told me, while you were unconscious, that you've been murmuring in your sleep. And you also have trouble sleeping, do you not?"
"Hermione, I-" Harry gripped his boyfriend's hand tighter. "What are you doing here?"
The two pulled away quickly, and Ron looked nauseous, but Harry looked much worse.
Harry stirred, waking up for the third time that day. Draco sat on a chair by him looking anxious and pale. He almost sobbed with relief when Harry came to.
"They're able to share their energy with their mate," Pomfrey explained. "He will heal himself with your magic."
"It wasn't even moving." Harry rolled his eyes.
Ron made a spectacular save, in the meantime, and the Gryffindors cheered.
"So it won't bother you anymore?"
"It is?" Draco laughed.
A pair of grey orbs opened and stared into his emerald ones. They crinkled at the edges.
"Well... now we're looking on altering between different moods," Hermione said nervously, twisting a strand of her hair with her finger and looking down. Harry raised an eyebrow confusedly.
"Harry, what's gotten into you? This is the second time you've lost your temper! You were fine with all this before! And no one is saying your crazy!" Draco said hastily.
"Hermione, the part of me that was Voldemort has been destroyed," Harry hissed.
Molly's eyes flashed with an unknown emotion. She quickly recovered and growled like an animal. Harry took this as an opportunity, pulling out his wand and effortlessly Stunning the woman. He looked down at the hawthorn wand in his hand with a smile.
Harry made to grab Draco's hand, before remembering Hermione's presence. Draco must have noticed the movement because he frowned deeply.
"They created a different kind of bonding potion, Harry. One which forced a Veela and their mate to be together. It only worked if the two had not already been, uh, mated, you could say," Slughorn said.
Molly gasped, scandalized. "Excuse me, Mr. Malfoy, but it appears to me you're saying that because I'm a single woman, I am unable to provide for myself?"
Harry gave Malfoy one last glance before letting out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. He held out a reluctant hand.
"I'm sorry, Harry," Draco said apologetically. "I just- she was my friend back then! How could she betray me like this?"
Harry hurriedly left the room, not wanting to be on the receiving end of Draco's wrath. He leaned against the door to try and overhear their conversation, but it was useless. It seemed that Draco had cast a Muffliato.
The bottle stopped moving, and everyone held their breaths.
The blond reached a hand out and stroked his wild hair tenderly. “It’s okay. Don’t worry. I won’t hurt you. Keep counting, love.”
were written on the board in Slughorn's neat script.
The Headmistress nodded. "I wanted to tell you about the new arrangements. As you two can no longer be apart from each other, you will be given one of the spare rooms. You may eat in there if you wish and can sit at any of the Slytherin and Gryffindor house tables together. Your friends may join you if they want. Your timetables have been remade. I will owl them to you later today. Expect them in an hour or so after I've left."
"Yes! I want to stay with Draco!" Harry protested. Sirius rolled his eyes.
“...Fuck.”
Harry's jaw dropped to the floor. Hermione burst into tears and quickly ran out of the bathroom. Harry tried to process what he had just heard, but his brain refused to believe it.
"It's only twenty words! You're not going to find anything from it!" he said, looking at the pair as if they were demented. Malfoy chuckled.
"Oh God, you really are a Slytherin," Draco sighed. "And you look like my own personal devil with that tie on."
"Yes, Headmistress," Malfoy said, nodding. "We're much better now."
Harry sat tentatively on the edge of the double bed. It had been awkward enough, changing in the same room and having to be in the bathroom at the same time, but sleeping together?
"Remember our sewing class? Saturday night, a couple of weeks ago?" Rob's voice strained, obviously nervous. If Mike didn't remember, then he could be a liable suspect.
"Fine, Potter. You can hold the shiny case file," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes, perking himself on the edge of the desk, and trying to look over Harry's shoulder at the writing.
"Harry!" Draco said cheerfully. Harry turned around, and the sight of the Veela's gleaming grin made his insides melt into a warm puddle at the bottom of his stomach.
"I told you we'd find something," he said.
He was standing in Hogwarts uniform, his tie was green and silver. His red pupils looked like those of a cat's, and he hissed like a snake.
”Hi, Ron,” she said with a bright smile. “What took you so long?”
Harry was sitting on the edge of his four-poster bed, looking as if he had committed third-degree murder. Ron patted his back.
"I'm not too sure about that," Malfoy said teasingly. Harry scowled at him.
"Were you trying to break my phone?" Harry said, putting his phone away. To think the git didn't want to be friends. Fucking bipolar.
They went to the very back of the classroom and sat down. Harry was next to the window, and Malfoy faced the class.
Smith looked up from where he was sitting by Harry's bed and narrowed his eyes at Draco.
"Who, you?" Ron joked. Hermione didn't laugh.
Harry pouted, but Draco laughed instead. "Tell you what, you let me take you home and take care of you I'll let you kiss me however much you want."
"What do you want?" he asked, hating himself for the shake in his voice. It was the place his mentor had died, after all. The memories of that night still haunted him in his dreams.
"Here! Look! I got Professor McGonagall to allow me into the restricted section and I found this!" she said eagerly. Harry leaned over Draco's plate and inspected the book.
go. And I'm fine!"
"Sure it was only the unicorn horn, Malfoy?" Harry said snidely as they turned a corner and headed towards their classroom.
Harry smirked evilly. "I've got a brilliant idea..."
"Excuse me?" he said, chuckling slightly. "Are you insulting my family?"
The portrait sneered down at them. "Password?"
"If your brain has locked them off, it might be...
"I did. But Draco slipped his own into my pocket when I started to step forwards," Harry admitted, blushing. Everyone looked at the blond, but he paid them no heed. Rushing forward, he took Harry's face in his hands.
Although they had come out, they thoroughly enjoyed the privacy of the Room of Requirement. Undisturbed, the two had done a wide range of things. Some of those being wholesome, like snuggling and talking. The others were... not so wholesome.
Draco jerked back as the parchment set alight, burning Harry's hand. It went up in flames, ruining any chance of Draco reading it.
"You look good in everything, Draco," Harry said, leaning up to kiss him. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and tilted his head slightly, deepening the kiss. Someone moaned, and Harry's hands traveled up into Draco's hair and tugged.
They traveled along the corridor to the room in awkward silence. As soon as they entered, Draco ushered Harry and locked the door behind them.
"You were
"That is the same thing I've been told that for years! 'You won't be able to complete your education, darling, you're not well enough' and 'are you sure you're up for marriage'?"
Harry scoffed. "I'm willing to go through any amount of pain if it means I'll be away from you."
"Oh no, I'd never do that," Harry chuckled. The laugh didn't quite meet his eyes, and Ginny frowned.
"Unless you think I had a business meeting with myself, I think you know the answer to that question," Henley growled. Something snapped inside Harry.
"I'm sure lots of people have trouble sleeping, Professor," Harry pointed out. "We went through a war, not more than a year ago."
"Alright, alright. I'm just wondering how Lola missing her ex-husband got her murdered!" Malfoy exclaimed. People looked over to him from their tables, and Harry smiled apologetically at them.
”Jealousy?” Harry threw his head back and laughed, immediately getting up from his position on the couch. “Who the fuck said anything about jealousy? I’m not jealous! In fact, I don’t give a shit anymore! Go over to Peter and see if I care!”
"You can't honestly expect me to be happy when
It turned out that Draco was planning a surprise for Harry. A surprise that consisted of a birthday party and balloons.
"Your friend has a crush on me," he told Harry once they were settled inside their room.
“I’ll go make you some tea, alright?” she said gently, smoothing the hair out his eyes. Harry nodded, and watched her as she got up from the couch and made for the kitchen.
Ron visibly shut down at the mention of the war. Hermione realised her mistake a moment later and bit her lip regretfully.
Harry looked down at the silver and green tie in confusion. "But it's just a tie?"
Draco stiffened beside him, but Hermione chirped in. "I mean, he hasn't called me a mudblood this year at all."
Before Mike could give a reply, Rob ended the call. He gave Malfoy a condescending smirk.
"Sure," Draco said, his eyes sparkling.
"How long until he wakes up?" he asked the matron. She looked at Harry fondly.
"I'm not siding with anyone!" Harry protested, which wasn't a lie.
"Pansy," Harry said.
"Hello," Draco mumbled, pulling Harry even closer into his chest.
The holidays were edging nearer, and the students of Hogwarts were excited. Harry and Draco had taken advantage of the several mistletoes that had hung up in the corridors.
Hermione looked up from the book she was rifling through. "Like with Voldemort, you mean? When he possessed you-"
"Why should I go back to him? He hasn't spoken to me in a month! And don't tell me he doesn't have time! He has time to text
"Mama, Lucy won't share!" the old woman sighed in frustration and smiled apologetically at the two young men, before disappearing promptly.
"Focus, you idiot!" Harry scolded. He wrinkled his nose as a foul stench breached his senses. The inside of the house was dark and small. A narrow and rickety staircase was a few feet in front of him, with what he presumed was the living room to his left.
"It'll never be alright! It was my fault! I should've gone through it while there was still time! I never should've gone to the Ministry on my own! I never should've-"
Why Ron?
Draco shrugged and proceeded to follow the two. Harry followed reluctantly but didn't say anything. They went over to a secluded corner of the room filled with their classmates.
For some reason the time sight of the blond made Harry cry even harder, and Draco immediately took Harry into his arms, whispering soothingly into his ear.
"I am Sirius, Harry," his godfather smiled warmly, his eyebrows furrowing slightly in concern. Harry backed away.
"Pfft," Harry giggled. "Balance each other... that's funny."
"Well it did," Malfoy said, staring deep into Harry's eyes. "It made me really angry."
Ron and Hermione's new friendship was awkward, to say the least. The pair's relationship was out the window, but they were desperately trying to gain their previous friendship back for old time's sake.
Professor McGonagall took that exact moment to walk inside.
”Harry, love, you’re safe,” Draco cried, wiping Harry’s tear-stained cheeks, stroking his hair soothingly and holding his body close. “You’re safe, you’re safe.”
"Don't," he said. "Show the world who you belong to."
”Because, quite simply, Harry Potter, I would die for you,” Malfoy replied. “I love you.”
"Alright. Let's go, Potter." Harry winced at hearing his last name leaving Draco's mouth.
The Slytherin version of him crouched down in front of him and pulled him up by his hair. His tie tightened an impossible amount more, and he felt his eyes roll to the back of his head.
Harry grumbled and walked over to the door, knocking on it.
"What," he gasped dreamily. "was that spell?"
"How will I know when she's ready to talk?"
"Leave it, Potter," he snarled, snatching his arm away and exiting the cafe. Harry looked on with longing and guilt.
"Cheer up, mate, I'm sure you two will find plenty of time to snog each other's brains out later." Harry smacked him again.
"Come on, Brown, there are some girls who are dying to be in your shoes," Zabini said. Pug-faced Parkinson seemed to be one of them, as she was glaring holes into the side of Lavender's head.
There was a sound of glass breaking and pans clanging and Draco rushed into the kitchen, eyes wide, and saw Harry sitting on the floor, crying, broken glass scattered around him, his hands shining with blood.
Harry's heart started to pound in his ears at the intensity of Malfoy's stare and he cleared his throat, backing away from the blond.
"Did you have to be so rude to him?" he asked the blond. Malfoy snorted, leaning back in his chair slightly.
"Fuck off, Potter," Malfoy snarled.
"Wait here," he said before walking away and up the stairs. Malfoy gave Harry a smug smirk.
"You were holding it really tightly before you blacked out," Draco said lazily.
"Oi, I found something!" Draco called. Harry tentatively stepped over various papers and files and made his way over to his partner.
Malfoy whipped his head around, and Hermione giggled. "Well, that's understandable." she smirked knowingly. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
She left the room, shutting the door behind her. Malfoy cut his eyes to Harry.
"Fine, fine!" Harry said hastily. "Please."
"I thought you might be able to erase it! There's something seriously wrong with him!" Madam Pomfrey said, looking between her patient and the Headmistress. She had never felt more useless.
"He was just checking in on me, like a normal friend. What's the big deal?" Draco said incredulously, sitting down next to Harry on the couch.
, Harry said mentally. "Well, what do we do then?"
"So it wasn't the Oath of Pain?" Harry asked. She shook her head.
"Shut up, Malfoy."
"It hasn't even been a day yet!" she exasperated.
"Hey, mate! How's yours coming along-" he stopped midsentence when Harry gave a jolt and spilled the drink over himself and Malfoy. He made to apologize, but the liquid had already disappeared from Malfoy's shirt, seeping through his shirt. Harry felt a cold sensation spreading through his abdomen, and he felt odd. Ron made a quick getaway, leaving Malfoy and Harry by themselves.
"I have to change your bandages, so stay still for a little bit," she said, chiding at him when he flinched away from her hand. He let her pull up his shirt, trying to ignore Malfoy's flaming gaze as she took off his current bandages.
"Looks like someone missed me," Harry beamed, wrapping his slender arms around Draco's neck and pulling him in for a kiss. Draco shifted so he was straddling Harry's waist and the two made out passionately.
He tried not to facepalm when he saw the first year Chaser, Elliot Nile, mount his broom with the back facing front.
"I guess we were pretty shit at hiding it," Harry mumbled.
"There's nothing wrong with my eyes!" Draco said.
"And what, exactly, do you plan to do about that?" Harry said, standing up a little straighter, taking a step forward. They were nose to nose, glaring at each other with pure hatred in their eyes.
Malfoy snorted. "We're doing fine, Professor. Potter here has agreed to take my notes,"
Harry lay on the ground with his limbs at odd angles. His glasses were askew, and blood was dribbling out his mouth. Draco's mouth stretched open in a torn cry as he went to crouch down by his lover. Harry's eyes were fluttering, tears streaming down his face.
Harry groaned inwardly. Anything was better than that.
Harry thought for a moment. What did he really want? He could say no and walk away from the chance to cure whatever's wrong with him and die anyway: or he could say yes and finally be free of the wretched disease.
"Anyways, let's get this over with," Harry said. He downed what was left with the drink in one gulp and set it down on the table. He braced himself for Malfoy's questions.
"The commitments, the responsibilities. And don't forget those devilish little blighters they make after themselves," Henley said. Harry raised an eyebrow.
Harry didn't know himself.
"Sorry. I- uh, forgot," Harry stammered, looking pointedly over Malfoy's shoulder. "Let's just go back, and I can send the owl later this evening."
"I'm not letting you leave until you tell me," Draco said bluntly, resting his back against the door. Harry glared at him before sitting down on the bed submissively.
But suddenly, something opened. It was... enlightening, to say the least. Harry's mind was filled with color and memories, and he could hear the Headmistress grunting as she extracted them and lowered them into the Pensieve. She collapsed against a desk and Harry opened his eyes to see her starch white face.
Harry had been under the impression that Draco hadn't seen a thing on the letter, but Draco had seen two words.
Harry whipped his head around to stare at-
He sucked in a breath and opened his eyes. "The end of our friendship? Why the fuck would I let
"That's not the point," Harry said quickly. "We are interrogating you, not looking for other suspects. We need to know what you were doing on the night of the murder."
"Hey," he said. Draco looked at the two of them with jealousy burning in his eyes. Noticing this, Harry took his hand and squeezed reassuringly.
Malfoy stuck his tongue out at her and resumed pacing back and forth.
"Lupin," Harry said quietly, staring at the ground. The portrait swung open, and the two boys walked inside.
Draco sighed. "It's a dinner with my
"What's your problem, Potter?" Draco inquired, now slightly taken aback.
"You're not one to run away from your problems," Draco mused. "Aren't Gryffindors know for bravery?"
"You two were talking about me?" Hermione said, looking suspicious. Harry could have sworn he saw hope in her eyes.
They scurried out of the Wing and left the matron to tend to her blistering headache. They both scowled at each other when they came to their joint room. They hadn't slept in it yet, and they weren't looking forward to it.
"What if I want to be his mate?" Harry asked quietly.
Ron's ears flushed. Draco smirked at that. "Damn, Weasley. You're blushing like a virgin."
"I'll go first," they said simultaneously. They growled.
”I was showing the new employee around,” he explained. “She’s pretty nice. I’ll have to introduce you guys sometime.”
"Don't blame yourself," Draco whispered fiercely in his ear. "Nothing was your fault."
The two got out of bed and went to shower, which ended up with a very flustered Harry and a very smug Draco. After getting ready for the day, the pair exited their room and made their way to the Great Hall. Draco pulled him back by their conjoined hands before they entered.
"I love you too," Harry murmured, resting his head against Draco's shoulder and humming in content.
Harry flipped him off. "They may as well be the Prime Minister. They're scary!"
"Are you crazy?" the blond hissed. Harry shook his hand off him and continued forward.
Draco opened his mouth to lie but thought better of it. Of course, he wanted Harry to himself! Was that so wrong? To be jealous?
"It's complicated, Neville!" Harry said exasperatedly. Neville clapped him on the back sympathetically.
"But Draco, I thought we had agreed we both wanted this!" Harry said.
The gargoyles stepped aside, and the staircase leading to the Headmistress' appeared. The boys hurriedly walked behind Professor Sprout, and she rapped lightly on the door.
It was Draco. His head peered through the door.
"I beg you, please! My father will murder me!" she sobbed, tugging on the front of his robes.
Harry grunted as he was dropped roughly to the ground.
Harry inwardly groaned and trudged over to the table where the pair were working at.
"And would you mind telling me where I could find her?"
Harry mumbled something incoherent and Malfoy sighed.
"Oi, genius! You forgot your glasses!" Draco called.
She spun the bottle, and as it started to slow to a stop in front of Harry, he flicked it away, and it landed in front of Hermione. Everyone laughed.
"You think, Draco?" Harry snapped.
"Malfoy?" he whispered into the dark, not expecting a response.
"We'll go now," he said tiredly, grabbing Harry's arm roughly and pulling him out of the classroom.
"This should be relatively easy," Malfoy mused as he read it.
"...It was Pansy."
"Please, Harry, try to understand. This could be your only chance of getting separated."
"I love you," he said, pulling Harry in for a kiss.
"Everyone has those!" Harry argued. His tie got tighter.
Mike chuckled, and they heard someone laughing in the background.
