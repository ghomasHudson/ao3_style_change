To second Poe's comment: This is not the "good but kinda mean Malfoys" this is my take on what Draco's life would have been like with his parents. They are monsters in this story and they will continue to be monsters in this story. Draco is essentially the rich version of a neglected kid when you meet him. Now prepare to meet my adorable and incredibly lonely little Draco!
"The scales are much softer than I thought they would be, but I like the way they feel! No rats is a good thing. I hope Remus will let you have a pet inside soon as well! Snakes should be as warm as they want to be whenever possible. You were able to make a branch stay warm? That is super cool! What else have you done? What else do you know about snakes? And why did the snake call you a pup?" Draco asked his questions excitedly and hurriedly, unable to slow his talking due to his excitement. He added the pup question as an after thought since he had heard Harry called that twice today. He was curious.
Narcissa nodded and gave him a fake seal that magically bonded to the parchment for him to use to close the letter, Draco put it on the letter and then gave it back to his mother.
Draco knew his mother would come get him in a little while but he just didn't care anymore. He was sad and lonely and a little scared of losing this new world of his...so he just let himself cry. In between sobs he said, "Can I really be friends with Ron too? Do you really think so Remus? And I'm sorry I mentioned sleepovers, I know those are just for special occasions when it's guaranteed safe and super planned out...I just don't like to sleep in my room. It's always so dark..."
She found him reading "Tales of Beedle the Bard" aloud to himself. He was getting quite good at reading which made Narcissa proud. She hoped he would continue to learn quickly and give the Malfoy name an upstanding reputation as he grew. She waited for him to finish the page he was on before she spoke.
Harry blinked a bit. He and Remus had managed to get a small apartment off of Diagon Alley, and they were out getting Christmas presents for everyone. Harry had forgotten something for one of them, and had been running back to get it when he ran smack into someone. He blinked when he saw the blonde boy from before. He hadn't forgotten about the boy at all, and had been hoping to see him every day from when they had started living near the Alley.
Harry hugged Draco as soon as Narcissa was away, happy he was there. He gave a wriggle at Remus' suggestion. "Say yes! Please say yes! Mister Florian always gives me extra, and I bet he'd give you extra too, cuz you're my best friend!" His eyes sparkled with mischief and excitement.
Draco and Harry settle into a rhythm at Lupin's and then Ron Weasley is dropped off one day. What will happen when a third kiddo enters the mix? Will adult fights stop friendships? Or will this duo become a trio?
"This is Draco, my new friend. He got separated from his mum, so I brought him here because we couldn't see her. Can he stay, please? F-for a little bit, anyway?" He looked hopefully up at his guardian, begging with his whole body.  He really, really wanted Draco to stay with him, for as long as possible. That way they could learn all about each other and become really good friends. Maybe even best friends.
We hope you enjoy~
Lucius and Narcissa were rarely home so Draco was usually completely alone with only their house elf as company. Dobby did his best to make sure that Draco was happy, because if Draco was crying when Narcissa came home, Dobby would be punished. He was a kind elf, but the fear he lived in was almost contagious. Draco felt a sort of kinship to the elf but he rarely let it show because of how his parents interacted with the elf. He saw Dobby's treatment and came to the decision that he would rather be ignored than physically hurt.
Harry had almost forgotten that he had written to Draco and was waiting for a reply when the owl came. It was a much fancier owl than the one he and Remus had, though Remus had told him that he could get an owl when he was older. That way he could send mail all by himself. But he had to be old enough to handle the bird first, and that made sense. He hoped he was old enough soon.
It read:
Draco got ready for bed as soon as he returned to his room. Then once his pajamas were on, Draco sat down at his desk, and pulled out the book Remus had given him. Once he placed it on his desk, Draco opened it and started to trace out his letters, hoping to get better at them. He wanted Harry to be able to read his writing when he wrote back to the letter Harry had promised to send.
"Harry... did you tell the rest of our year about the wedding?" Draco asked softly, still looking at the box. He was a bit worried about what might be inside of it. He hadn't been the most popular student, after all. His own fault, really, but he could admit it now. Harry frowned a bit, coming over from where he was adjusting Luna's gift to get more light.
Harry crumpled up the page, and tossed it at his bin. It missed, bouncing off of the rim with a soft ping that woke Cajetan. The owl gave a grumpy hoot, and Harry gave him a wry smile before heading over to stroke his head.
"Thank you Remus, for everything. I have really enjoyed being here with you both." Draco said kindly to his Remus.
"Good night, Cajetan. Enjoy your hunting." Harry waved to his owl as he headed to his bedroom. He did feel a bit better, having written that letter for his assignment. He'd have to let his Mind Healer know. And write another one soon.
Remus nodded to Narcissa. "It was a pleasure to have Draco visit. He's welcome anytime, with some forewarning. An owl should be plenty adequate to contact me." Remus answered her before she left.  Harry chirped out a pleasant "You're welcome!" before Narcissa had left. Once she had, both Werewolves looked at each other, then burst out laughing.
"Who's this with you, Harry?" The man asked, squatting down a bit so he wouldn't seem as tall. Harry did a happy little dance of joy before answering him.
Harry gave Draco a quick, tight hug. "I bet she'll be fine. It was mostly reading today, anyway. Uncle Remus says we're ahead, so he needs a day to plan things. He was just going to have us work on drawing after, which is fun anyway!" He wriggled excitedly.
"Who is Dudley? I am sorry they took your toys, can I play with your toys though? Your broom looks awesome! And is that a potions kit? What do you do with that? Or you know, what toys are your favorite? We could play with those ones first maybe?" Draco asked both in a voice that was both excited and nervous.
"Well okay then, if you are sure... Lead the way!" Draco said with a smile as he walked closer to the building.
Oh, yes. It was all the fault of that bloody owl!
Harry listened to Draco's barrage of questions. He was a little afraid to answer the last one, because most of the time when people found out, they were either afraid of him or they looked at him with pity. He didn't like either of those things, but he didn't want to lie to his friend either. He took a deep breath before answering everything.
While his two friends talked, Harry got everything they needed, and had those sent to Remus as well, bouncing a bit. "Now, off to the Ice Cream Palace!" He zipped out, laughing, causing his two friends to have to tear after him, heading straight for Florian's. There had been some unexpected deals today, so they had a lot of money to bring home ice cream!
Harry had already picked his book, and had one for Ron as well. The redhead accepted his book, happy to sit with the other boys and read. "Yeah." Ron grinned happily. "I'd like that. For us all to be friends." He was determined now, to make Draco his friend no matter what, and to be a better friend to Harry. This was something special, he felt, and he was being allowed to share in it. It was something just for him, Harry, and Draco, and none of his brothers would be able to say they had it. He just knew they would all be best friends. He could feel it.
Remus chuckled, happy to see them all happy. He had already adjusted his lesson plans again, to include Ron, and sent a copy of the new ones to Narcissa, only mentioning that there would be another boy learning with Harry and Draco, and that he would make sure it did not interrupt their learning or hinder them in any way.
"We should definitely write letters to each other! I don't really know how to write much yet though, so mine may not be all that good." Draco shuffled his feet nervously and looked down at the floor, embarrassed by his admission.
Harry beamed brightly, bouncing a bit. "Dudley is my cousin, and he didn't know any better, or so Remus says, so I'm not mad at him. You can play with my toys, because you're my friend!" He gave a happy wriggle. "I like my broom, but I'm not allowed to fly it very fast yet. I like potions. They smell funny, and make me sneeze sometimes, but I like making them. I can make one that tastes like chocolate! It's in my book." He dug the book in question out, which was potions that were toddler safe.
"Well... Apparently they've found out." Draco looked a bit more pale than usual. He was worried about the gift now. It had been heavy, and he was glad he hadn't simply opened it. What if it was cursed? Specifically against him? He looked up at Harry, who seemed to be sharing his concerns.
"Uncle Remus says I'm only supposed to do the potions in this book, until I'm bigger. He says these ones are safe and can't hurt me." Harry tapped the book gently. "Maybe we can make the one that tastes like chocolate sometime. I'm out of all the imgridanents, but Remus said he'll get more for me." He wriggled excitedly. "Yah! I can help you learn. It'll be awesome. Uncle Remus sometimes takes me to a place he knows, and I can fly out there!" He beamed brightly.
Draco was surprised to see the red haired boy be dropped off, he even recognized the boy and his Mom. They were part of that big family Draco had seen in Diagon Alley on the day he met Harry. They were a family that hugged, and looked happy to see each other. Maybe having Ron play with them for a day or two wouldn't be so bad, Draco thought to himself.
"Yeah umm Mother kept going after I accidentally ran into Harry. I had been looking around Diagon Alley as we walked but Mother was walking too fast and I was having trouble keeping up. I am not really sure where she is just that she is in Diagon Alley trying to do some Christmas shopping. I thought it was to get ideas for my gifts but then she...she left me...." Draco said blinking quickly trying not to cry as the realization hit him. Draco looked down at the floor, scared and feeling ashamed at his tears.
"I'm okay. I know I look all skinny and stuff, but I'm pretty tough. I don't see your mum anywhere, so maybe you'd better come with me. Uncle Remus will know how to find her again, but you'll be safe if you stick with me here." He smiled. "I'm getting something for a Christmas present for my friends, Fred and George. They like to play pranks. You want to help me?"
Harry offered her a brilliant smile, one that could melt anyone's heart. "I would like that very much, if he can, Mrs. Malfoy. I do hope that Mr. Malfoy says yes." He was doing his very best to be charming, which he was very good at, because he wanted to get his way. Which was to have Draco over as much as possible.
-HPDM-
Realizing he was staring when Harry told him to dig in, Draco started and blushed a little.
Narcissa nodded at Remus's words and took the papers from him, briefly looking them over. She put them inside her bag and nodded at Remus again. "Well thank you for these, if you prepare the lessons a month in advance then you can just give them to me however works best for you, but I will definitely look over this week's. Thank you again for agreeing to this, I know it will be good for Draco, and I also know that you are smart, so I appreciate you teaching the kids as well. Thank you for this, please tell me if I can do anything to help you with the lessons, supplies or anything of that sort. I would happily help you there. And if Draco steps out of line please tell me as well so it can be dealt with accordingly." At this Narcissa gave her son a steely look, which made Draco stand up straighter. He had just returned Harry's hand squeeze a moment before, but now he was back to being at attention, and ready to stand up to any scrutiny his mother would put on him.
"That was your mother? She... reminds me of my aunt." He didn't mind when Draco held his hand for longer than needed, but frowned when he saw the boy rub his wrists. He didn't interrupt while Draco was talking though. Remus had told him that was rude, and he didn't want to be rude at all. He really, really hoped the other boy wanted to be his friend, too. This would be the first time Harry chose a friend for himself, and he didn't want to mess it up.
Harry got the snake settled and closed his window, going to hug Draco. "I'll write you a letter about how I talk to my wolf, okay? You can write me back. Friends do that, yeah?" He hugged his friend tight, not wanting to let go of him, but knowing that he couldn't keep him there. Not yet, at least. But maybe someday, he could.
"So today is just a day of fun and play? That sounds awesome! Oooh I wonder what stories we will have today? They are short but I like them, do you like to read Ron? Ooooh! Maybe we could work writing into our adventure as well?" Draco said, and then realized he might sound like someone who liked learning too much so he tried to settle down. But ended up dancing in place instead.
A tap on his window drew Draco out of his thoughts, and he looked up to see an owl at his window. He didn't recognize it, but he got up and let it in anyway. The owl hooted at him, butting his hand with its head like a cat before holding out what was clearly a crumpled piece of parchment. Draco took it with bemusement.
Draco looked around as he followed Harry to his chair. He also bounced a bit as he took in the room. The kitchen was small but it felt....cozy? Or at least much warmer than his entire house did. He saw pictures up on the walls of Remus and Harry having a good time, and could tell that there was love in this house. The thought made him smile, he was glad that Harry seemed to be in a good home. From what Harry had briefly mentioned about his Aunt, Draco gathered she wasn't very nice to him, sort of like his parents weren't very nice to, well anyone. Draco scooted his chair in and sniffed happily. He had never had lasagna but it smelled delicious. Maybe Dobby knew how to make it? Draco thought to himself since of course Dobby did all the cooking.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So I have some news to relate to you Lucius. I may have gotten separated from Draco today in Diagon Alley. Apparently during this time he literally ran into Harry Potter. That's right THE Harry Potter. Harry is staying with Remus Lupin now, so he is inside the magical world once more. Anyways, Draco and Harry seem to have become best friends during their afternoon together. Remus assured me that Draco had been on his best behavior and that the boys had a great time today. So Draco wants to go back to visit Harry and Remus. I just wanted to see what you think about it." Narcissa informed her husband.
Remus smiled at Draco. "You don't have to call me sir. Remus is just fine." He served himself and Harry, then sat down to eat, wondering if Draco thought he had to call all adult figures in his life 'sir'. He hoped that Harry would help him get past that.
Draco hugged Ron back as well and returned the compliment to his new friend. "I am glad we can still be friends, and you are nice as well, I had a great time today. I am glad we met."
She smiled warmly at the boys and replied, "Well Ronald if you are sure you want to join Harry and Draco and that you will be on your best behavior during lessons, then I see no reason why you shouldn't study here with Remus. Especially if Remus is sure it won't be any extra trouble. What time should I start bringing Ron over in the mornings, Remus?" Molly asked, turning her attention back to the other adult in the room.
His room was painted in neutral colors with hints of earth tones and greens, and he had a small children's potions kit, some books, and a toy broom. On his bed sat a single plush wolf with bright green eyes. He loved his room, it was much better than the cupboard at Aunt Petunia's house, and he was very glad that he never ever had to go back there again.
Harry wriggled a bit, but decided that, since Draco hadn't fully given his secret away, that it was okay. Besides, he wanted Ron to join the sleepovers. That would be super cool. Then they could have after dark adventures for midnight snacks. "Sleepovers would be really, really cool!" He looked up at the adults with his puppy-dog face again.
Draco settled into a cushion, on his belly with the book out in front of him. Draco wriggled a little as he read, since he always had trouble sitting still for long periods of time. Lying on his stomach, gave him the ability to wiggle his legs without making it hard for him to read. Draco was reading a book about a cat named Pete, and it always made him giggle. So as he read he laughed, though he tried to keep the laughter quiet so as to not disrupt anyone else's reading.
Draco jumped up and down in excitement at Mrs. Weasley's answer and exclaimed, "Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!" Then he danced around in a circle, while also hugging both of his friends. Draco was ecstatic about having another friend, especially one as nice as Ron, so much so that he spoke without thinking about Harry's secret.
He hoped that Draco would write back soon, though he knew that it was probably silly to expect a reply immediately. He hoped Draco could visit soon, too. It would be so much fun! And he could take Draco to meet the Weasleys, maybe, and then if they got caught up in their own games again, he would have someone to play with too! Harry knew that the Weasleys didn't mean to leave him out of their games and things, but it still hurt when they did it. They just weren't used to playing with him yet, even though they were really nice and friendly.
"Oh this letter is addressed to Draco, it must be from your new friend. Why don't you finish your breakfast and then you can go upstairs and work on your response. While I write to Remus to see when he is free for you to come visit them again." Narcissa said as she looked at Draco, who seemed about to leap out of his chair.
Harry decided to just go ahead and write, after a few false starts. He bit his lip, and sat for several moments writing what he wished he could have said. There were a few cross outs, but he didn't give up. It still took him almost an hour to write out what felt like a short, simple letter.
Draco hugged Harry back just as tightly, not wanting to leave his new found friend. He also wasn't excited to be going back to his house where it was cold and dreary and no one really talked to him.
Draco nodded, too nervous to do so. Harry was good, but he wasn't finished with his Mastery yet and there might be something new on it that no one knew how to detect. Or it might be keyed to Draco opening it. They'd seen a few letters like that off and on since the war. It wasn't an entirely unfounded fear. He watched as Harry undid the wrapping and took the lid off.
Remus frowned a bit. "I don't think your parents would begrudge you a friend, Draco. Here, let me get you a book before we leave, it will help you with writing your letters." He found the one he was looking for quickly, since it was on a shelf by Harry's door. "This book helps you learn to write and read better. This copy isn't in use right now, and I can always find another for Harry. You take it with you, that way you won't need too much help to write to Harry. We'll be looking forward to your letters."
Harry beamed when Draco seemed to relax some. Draco smiled back at Harry, still a little timid but excited to be joining Harry at his house. Harry didn't want his friend to be afraid. He held the other boy's hand tight, and walked up to his door. He had to dig for his key to unlock it, but it didn't take long and they were soon inside. "Uncle Remus! I'm hoooome!" He called out. His call brought a man with sandy-brown hair and a warm smile to the room.
The Mind Healer had said that he didn't need to show them to her. And despite it looking like a letter, Harry had absolutely no intention of sending it off. This exercise was about helping him to embrace something about himself that he had been taught was wrong. It was about reassuring his subconscious mind that it was okay to be gay.
Harry giggled with them, and accepted the money and the list. He looked at the list. "Lets get all the things that don't get bad first! So we need... some new books!" He struck a dramatic pose. "Let's go, adventurers!"
“Ooh it would be cool if you could have your party here! That would be super cool and there would be all sorts of ice cream for everyone to choose from! Annnd as for ice cream, can I have chocolate and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream? Like a little of both? Or is that too much to ask for?" Draco asked curiously. He always loved ice cream but he didn't want to be greedy either. Mr. Florian smiled at Draco in response and added a tiny bit extra of both types for Draco, to reward the young boy’s manners.
"Yes why don't we talk about sleepovers and such another time boys. Let's see how these next few weeks of lessons go and then we can discuss sleepovers in further detail. As for your party Ronald, we will have to see about locations after I talk to your father, okay? I am not saying no, I just don't know what the Ice Cream Parlor will cost. As for a drop off time, if you are up that early Remus, and if Mrs. Malfoy is the only one who comes by, perhaps Arthur could bring Ron by on his way to work? I will talk to him and see how he feels about that. But for now I do think we have to get going Ron, before your siblings tear up the house." Molly said kindly, smiling at the boys.
Draco giggled a little at Harry's happy dance and bounced up and down as his friend danced. He felt happy for the first time in quite a while, and while he was still nervous, he felt hope that it would work out. Draco looked Remus up and down, trying to size up the man, and read him as well as he could. Remus seemed kind, and non threatening. So Draco smiled at him shyly.
They each got plenty of what they wanted, and Florian even sent them home with a couple of tubs of each flavor, since they had enough, charmed to stay frozen for a few hours. Harry hurried them home anyway, skipping happily. "It's gonna be a great party!" He chirped.
During some hurried holiday shopping within Diagon Alley Draco gets separated from the unobservant and uncaring Narcissa Malfoy. He runs into a dark haired boy, that seems to be the same age of him and really nice. Draco swears he has seen him somewhere before...
"So a joke is supposed to be funny, right? Maybe you could tell me about some of your favorite pranks your friends have done? I might understand it better that way." Draco asked curiously, holding tight to Harry's hand as he led him through the joke shop, a store he had never been in before.
"Well I don't think that you are evil, even when you transform into a werewolf, you are still a good person. I am sorry that transforming hurts you though, that can't be fun to live through all the time. Is there a way to make it less painful? I know you won't bite me, I trust you Harry. Do you have to be alone when you transform? That sounds worse than just having to transform. Can friends be with you? I don't like the idea of you being alone when you are in pain..." Draco said with empathy in his voice.
"Bye Draco." He whispered softly. "See you soon!" He was so glad it had worked out.
Harry’s words made Draco look around. He had been so keen on possibly attending Ron’s party that he had momentarily forgotten their mission. “Oh, but if we don't stop talking...Harry is going to leave us behind for ice cream! We have to go Ron!" Draco said with a laugh as he started to run after Harry.
Draco looked up at his mother and said. "Oh well thank you Mother for thinking of me. But I think for the rest of my gifts this year, I would like to just be able to spend time with Harry. It's nice to have a friend to play with! I would also like to maybe get him a gift or two? I think that would be nice. Would that be ok Mother?" Draco asked hopefully.
So Harry had dutifully gone out and scoured all of the magical menageries that he knew of. He'd learned of a few more, for sure, since he'd come to the wizarding world. At first, his friends had forced him out, with him dragging his heels over the task. They pushed, and he dug in. Slowly but surely, however, he began to enjoy going out simply for the sake of going out. He even started to look forward to seeing owls, if only to visit them and have them not look at him shiftily. Okay... so maybe the Owl Post people were not entirely happy with him, and the owls knew it.
Draco then returned Harry's hug, grateful to be held by his friend. Harry was the person he trusted most in this world, with Remus being a close second. "I don't want them to shout either. And I am sorry that my parents are such bad people. I..." Draco's voice became a very low whisper at this point, only for Harry's ears. "I wish they weren't my parents" Draco said as his voice broke and he hugged Harry back tighter.
Draco saw Harry's eyes watering and that made him cry harder for a minute because he was making his friend cry and he didn't mean to. But then as Remus picked them up and held them, Draco's breathing started to return to normal, and his tears started to slow. Draco snuggled into Remus as well as Harry and listened to the older man talk. He let himself believe in Remus's words as if they were indeed a magical guarantee. Remus telling him that he wasn't mad at Draco made him feel better. Draco hiccupped a little as Remus stopped talking and just sat in the man's arms for a bit, not quite sure what to say but enjoying the feeling. Draco also wanted to bask in the compliment Remus had given him.
I like to think that, since wixen use owls for mail, that maybe the owl species that we think have disappeared have simply been cultivated by them.
Harry meets the Weasleys! It's a brief description, as this fic is primarily a Drarry and will focus more on how they grow together. We'll eventually get into longer chapters as more characters are met and Draco and Harry grow together.
"Remus, how long are we supposed to read for today? I read my book twice already so I was going to look for a new one if you wanted us to read for longer. If not then maybe we could do some writing and work it into our adventure for the day?" Draco said shimmying hopefully.
"Ooooh! I would love to make potions with you sometime! When you have more things to make them with that is, and if I can visit again. And riding a broom would be an awesome thing to learn too! Maybe I could go with you to learn to fly sometime too.” Draco said all of this in a hurry, he was too excited to speak slowly.
Harry started speaking again, this time telling his new friend more about himself. "Uncle Remus isn't actually my uncle. He was best friends with my mum and dad when they were in school. Even though he gets sick a lot, they were really nice to him, and didn't shun him like a lot of people do when they find out. I get sick, sometimes, too. That's why he's taking care of me, we have the same thing. But don't worry, I won't get you sick by touching. Uncle Remus says it's to do with DNA, whatever that is. I don't mind you staying with me at all. I bet Uncle Remus won't mind either. Even if she's mad, at least you'll be safe. She can be happy about that."
Harry cheered along with his friends and dashed for Ingredient Mountain. After that, it would be the Ice Cream Palace and a mad dash home to make sure nothing melted, even though he knew that Mr. Florian would charm it to stay frozen until they got it in the freezer.
Draco hugged Harry back just as tightly, and made a noise akin to a purr at Harry's words. "Yes best friends forever and ever!" Draco said in a voice that dripped with hope and excitement. Being hugged was very soothing and slowly but surely Draco felt himself calming down.
Wow! The responses to this have been so great! Thank you, everyone! Sorry it took so long to get this chapter up. We wanted to make sure we got the next plot point across and didn't miss anything in our massive backlog of text.
"I'm sure!" Harry beamed brightly and returned the hug. He liked hugs a lot, and he had a feeling that getting hugs from Draco would be something extra special.
Their lessons progressed, and they did quite well. In fact, Draco learned more from Remus than his previous tutors had been teaching him, and in a more neutral light. Remus truly was an excellent teacher, and Harry enjoyed having other boys to learn with.
Remus got down on Draco's level and hugged him. "I'm sorry, Draco. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. I just thought that perhaps it would be better if your parents and Ron's parents didn't have to meet a lot, because they fight and can say mean things. I didn't want that to spoil your friendship with Ron, and make any of you feel bad about being here. Will you forgive me?"
Harry and Draco both get to choose their first friends! (Well first friends they themselves choose)
Draco also returned Ron's hand squeeze before mimicking his cheer about Ingredient Mountain.
Draco made an excited noise and said, "That sounds awesome Father! Thank you!"
Draco wiggled happily in his chair, excited to help Remus write a shopping list. He wiggled a lot more when he was Remus's place because he was happy, and he knew he could be himself without getting into trouble. So Draco had fun and played and let himself move when he wanted to instead of trying to be as still as possible at all times. Draco waited happily by the parchment and quill, excited to practice his letters while also helping Remus.
Harry bit back a giggle. "It smells with its tongue. Isn't that cool?" He smiled brightly, watching Draco's face to see how he reacted. His own lisp wasn't as noticeable when the snake spoke. He watched, waiting to see how Draco would respond to his pet. He hoped that Draco liked talking with it just as much as he did.
Draco pushed aside the pile of papers on his tiny table (he'd been futilely searching for a job, yet again) and uncrumpled the ball of parchment. His brow furrowed as he read it, confused as to why someone would send him something like this. He scanned to the end, one elegant brow raising as he took in the signature, before going back to read it over properly.
Draco's introduction! Hope everyone enjoyed~
"Oooh! I think a three person adventure would be awesome! I am sure we could go on a fun new adventure sometime today if Remus is okay with it that is." Draco said with a smile on his face.
Harry stuck close to Draco, sensing his friend's nerves. "I bet Uncle Remus means Ron Weasley. He's okay, but he's got lots of older brothers, so he gets jealous easy. Just don't make fun of him, and if he makes fun of you, I'll yell at him. Because you're my best friend, and he's not."
After the war, one thing that everyone could agree on was that Harry Potter definitely needed a new owl. Well, everyone but Harry Potter, of course. He was still mourning the loss of his beloved Hedwig. She had been a grand owl- everyone agreed on that- but she was gone and Harry definitely couldn't keep using the Owl Post owls forever. For one thing, he inevitably got mobbed whenever he went out to send mail. For another, if another owl came back injured he was definitely going to have to pay a fine. Being a hero only went so far.
Draco giggled a little as they passed the parchment around, because it seemed almost like a game now that they were passing the parchment in a circle. Draco still paid plenty of attention though, and was happy to be working with his friends on the shopping list. After a little while, the list was finished and the boys were ready to head out. Draco danced in place a bit, and looked at Harry, as Remus gave him the money pouch.
Harry enjoyed having Draco over, and he found plenty of adventures for them to have, even if most of them were pretend, and ended at some store or another where the adults would give them a treat. He did enjoy having someone to learn with, and having a friendly competition with Draco did push him to be a much better student. He was always willing to help if Draco got stuck on something, though. When he heard Remus mention a friend being dropped off, he squirmed a little.
Draco giggled a little at Harry's fierceness, not sure how else to respond. He hugged Harry back tightly and whispered "Thank you for being my friend," before letting the other boy go.
Remus held both boys close, snuggling them. "You are a very nice person, Draco. And you shouldn't ever stop trying to be a nice person. I think, if you work hard enough at it, you'll prove to everyone that you aren't like your parents at all." He very much wanted to take the poor lad in and lavish him with all the love he so clearly deserved, but knew what a fuss would be made if he did. He did plan to make sure that the blonde would always be welcome in his home, though.
Harry was quivering with excitement, and he subtly squeezed Draco's hand. He waited for the grown ups to stop talking, so that he and Draco could run off and play. Remus always let him play after breakfast, at least for a little, so that he wasn't as distracted from learning. He was sure that wouldn't change with Draco there.
Remus smiled a bit at Draco's wiggling. "You've already read longer than you had to. I'd be happy to do some writing with you. We have a small shopping list that you boys can take care of for me while you go on your adventure. I'll give Harry the money pouch, since I know he's usually your leader. You can help me write it out." He offered Draco a seat beside him, getting him a piece of paper to help him write everything out.
Harry loved Cajetan quite a bit. It wasn't the same love as he'd shared with Hedwig, but he was pretty sure that Cajetan loved him back. The bird went out of his way to be affectionate to Harry, and Harry had wholeheartedly returned it. He thought perhaps he had space in his heart for two owls. Plus, no one would expect a bird that behaved like Cajetan to belong to their 'Savior.'
The snake itself appeared to be some kind of magical hybrid, though neither of the boys would understand that yet. It had markings like a python, but was built like a venomous snake and had a small hood. Harry adored it, and did his best to take care of it. He looked at Draco hopefully. "It won't bite, I promise."
"Uh oh. Uncle Remus is coming. I have to put my snake back out the window, Draco!" He scrambled up to do so, not wanting to get into trouble. He knew the mess would be forgiven, but the snake might not be and he didn't want to lose it just because Uncle Remus got mad.
Remus didn't let Draco see his frown, watching the two boys go off to the bathroom. He sighed softly, wondering if there was something that could be done that wouldn't drastically change Draco's life the way Harry's had been. He didn't want to cause Draco pain, or Harry. He decided to put off writing the letter to the blonde's parents until after they had eaten and the boys were playing happily. He hoped they didn't get rid of it on principle because it had been written by a Werewolf, but at least he'd have tried.
Gifts were still coming in, almost two weeks after they'd had their quiet wedding in a quiet little village with a quaint little garden that they'd both found very peaceful after the stress of the war. Dennis Creevey's gift (in Colin's memory) had been paying for their wedding photos. There were quite a few of those that they were looking forward to seeing, but the development process did still take some time and they hadn't received those yet.
Ron nodded a bit, going back to his mother once Draco was a little calmer. He didn't like that he had to go, but was glad he could come back again the next day. "I gotta go, Draco, but I'll see you tomorrow, okay?"
Of course, Harry acquiring Cajetan was only the beginning of things. No one had any possible way of knowing what would happen afterwards. Though they would always say in the end that Cajetan was only trying to be helpful, and must have mistaken the crumpled up balls of parchment for letters. Harry knew better, though. Cajetan had planned the whole thing. He was sure of it. He wouldn't even blame Draco for any of it.
Remus had to take Harry out to get a new writing book. Harry didn't mind this, because it meant he could start practicing his letters better, too. He wanted to make sure all of his letters were really, really nice, so that Draco's parents wouldn't change their minds at all, ever. If Harry was on his best behavior with them, and always super polite, then they would never have to change their minds. It usually worked with the Dursleys, so it might work with them too, he thought.
"Of course I forgive you Remus, you didn't mean to make me feel bad. It's really not you that makes me feel bad...it's my parents. I feel like because of them...I am automatically considered mean and bad and it makes me sad. I want to be friends with Harry, and Ron, and I think I can be a good friend to them, I really do. But I don't want to get them in trouble, or make Ron's parents mad at him because my parents are mean. But I don't like the idea of my parents yelling at Ron's parents either, so you can definitely make sure that mother doesn't see Ron's parents... I just want to be friends with everyone and go to Ron's party and feel safe." Draco said somewhat quietly as Remus hugged him, though his voice got louder as he talked about how hurt he felt.
Draco nodded and followed his mother to the fireplace where they used Floo Powder to travel to the fireplace of the Leaky Cauldron.. Narcissa threw a fit over cleaning off Draco, he still had to look presentable at all times. Especially when they were out in public. Draco could have fun and get dirty the way small children do, when they played at Harry's. But being a kid wasn't allowed anywhere in public, at least not in front of his Mother. Draco held back a sigh as he let Narcissa fitfully clean him. Then they left the Leaky Cauldron together, heading to Remus's place. Draco had to hold in his excitement as they got closer. Narcissa knocked on the door and waited for it to open.
Harry was really nervous about telling Draco his big secret. Remus had told him not to tell people, but he wanted Draco to be his best friend, and Remus said you didn't hide things from best friends, too. He took a deep breath, hearing the trust and the smile in Draco's voice.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand back as he listened to Remus speak, his eyes welling up with tears again. His parents rarely talked to him, not to mention welcomed him home. Yet here Remus was, saying that he was welcome in their home whenever, and for any reason it would seem. Draco nodded at Remus, not sure how to share his feelings properly. Harry was his age, so he felt safer with him, but Draco had never really been around an affectionate adult so he didn't know how to show his appreciation. Deciding to try to voice his feelings Draco said;
"Umm should we play for a bit more before my Mom comes to pick me up?" Draco asked Harry as he realized his arm was still in the air. Draco blushed slightly as he put his arm down. The boys played for a bit longer until Narcissa came to pick him up. Draco told Harry bye, with just a brief hug, scared as always to show too much emotion with his mother present. Emotion was frowned upon in his family, unless it was an emotion that could be used for power…
"Remus doesn't understand. I'm trying to teach him, but he's afraid of his wolf. A lot of people are, I guess. Because normally people hate them for it. I'd be afraid too, if I didn't think it was neat. It got me away from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. They were mean, and bad." Harry smiled at Draco, squeezing the boy's hand back. "Uncle Remus won't ever let us do a full moon sleepover, but we can try at school. We'll have to try very hard to be in the same House, but even if we aren't, you'll always be my best friend." He looked up, hearing Remus before Draco did.
"Um... Um. Okay. So, um. I live with Uncle Remus now because of why I get sick sometimes." He fidgeted, with his own fingers. "Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon got scared of me, and dumped me by the Leaky Cauldron. They got scared, because... Because I got bit." He looked down. "B-by a Werewolf. Lots of people think that means I'm scary and bad, or that they should be sad for me, so I'll understand if you don't want to be my friend any more..." His voice got very quiet by the end.
"I would like to meet your Uncle then, he sounds awesome!"
Harry hugged Draco, not wanting his friend to feel ashamed. He whispered, "It's okay. I cry too. Uncle Remus says crying means we're strong enough to admit when we're hurting." He didn't let go, letting the blonde cry on his shoulder. Draco hugged Harry back hard. He let the other boy hold and comfort him the way he had seen other people's family comfort them. For a minute he relaxed completely and sagged into Harry's arms, trusting this new friend to keep him safe. Harry glanced hopefully up at Remus again, still begging silently for his friend to be allowed to stay. He really, really didn't want to have to send him back to the person who had left bruises on his arms.
Harry squeezed Draco's hand, listening to Uncle Remus talk to his friend. He had just known that Remus wouldn't be upset with his choice, and was glad that Draco could hear him say it. He was going to write to Draco lots when the blonde went back home, so that Draco would know he was thinking about him. He would make sure to learn Draco's birthday, too, and send him a present for it. Nothing in the world was going to stop Harry Potter from being Draco Malfoy's friend now!
Draco thought about the red haired family often, and couldn't wait to see them again, maybe this time he could get away from his mother and talk to them. There had been some other people around the family and while they clearly were not related to the red haired family, they did seem just as friendly. Draco dreamed of meeting them all and becoming friends, with some of them at the very least. Friends could give hugs, right? Draco hoped so. He spent some of his time trying to draw the family and figure out why they seemed so happy when his parents always just seemed busy or angry. Draco's main emotion was sadness, and he didn't like it, but he didn't understand how to change it on his own.
The owl, its duty clearly finished, butted his hand once more before winging back out the window to whomever owned it. Draco watched it fly away, confusion warring with his amusement. He couldn't recall the last time an owl had shown him quite that much affection. A reply was clearly not expected, however, so he closed his window and went back to his seat.
Narcissa rolled up her scroll and waited for a few minutes before going to check on Draco. "Draco are you done with your response letter? I have written to Remus about seeing when you can visit them next, but I wanted to send my letter with yours."
Draco loved going into the Mighty Book Jungle and enjoyed looking at all the titles, and was more than happy to help pick out new reading materials. The shopkeep sent the books to Remus's place for them, which meant that the boys had room to carry the groceries and such back. Draco saw a few people looking at them funny but did his best to ignore it, just hoping that they were looking at them because they were kids. Draco worried slightly that his mother would find out about this and get mad at him for it, for some reason.
Remus answered the door, keeping his expression neutral. "Lady Malfoy. You received my letter, I see. Please come in. I apologize, as my home is nowhere near your standards, but I hope that it will have been adequate enough that we kept Draco off of the street, where any kidnapper could have snatched him." He moved aside, letting her in, while not-so-subtly chiding her for losing track of her child and not looking for him. "The boys are playing in Harry's room. I'll just go up and let them know it's time for Draco to go home." He headed up, taking his time.
Remus chuckled, and took the boys out for ice cream, letting them order what they wanted. Florian Fortescue did indeed give both boys an extra scoop, happy to see Harry have a friend his own age. After ice cream, he took them back and taught them what he said he would. The days usually went similarly whenever Draco came over.
Lucius glared at Narcissa for having lost their son, her incompetence bothered him sometimes. But he didn't feel like yelling at her now because there was something better to talk about. He looked at his wife and said, "You really need to be more careful with Draco. I realize that you don't seem to have the mothering gene but this is unacceptable. However the fact that our son has made friends with the famous Harry Potter is interesting. I think we should let them be friends, hell let Draco spend as much time with Harry as he wants. This will eventually work out in our favor, I am sure of it. We can ensure that Harry becomes fascinated with the Dark Arts and either he will lead us one day, or he will help the Dark Lord when he returns. We will be revered for this act, so I say we allow our son to be friends with this boy, and do our best to play it in our favor. You will write to Remus to see when he is available to watch Draco. Hell pay him for it if you want, just make sure our son and Harry stay close." Lucius gave a self-satisfied smirk at his idea. Then he went upstairs to check on Draco.
Cajetan steals Harry's first discarded page with his feelings about Draco on it, and delivers it. Draco is not impressed, but doesn't respond as he thinks it's some kind of prank and he doesn't initially recognize that Cajetan is Harry's owl.
"I see that." Harry pulled his wand out. It was his repaired Holly and Phoenix Feather wand, since he'd returned Draco's wand on the first instant he could. He'd been grateful that Draco had let him take it and use it, but it wasn't the same as his own. He began casting charms to detect harmful substances or magic in the gift. After everything came back clean, he frowned at it. "Well, Draco, love... it appears to be clean. Would you like me to open it anyway?"
Draco hugged Harry and Remus back tightly and slowly broke apart from them, as he tried hastily to wipe his eyes before looking back at Ron and his Mum.
Thanks for sticking around for the first chapter! Sorry it's so short. This is just Harry's Introduction. The chapter lengths will likely vary quite a bit, as I'll cut them wherever we feel is appropriate as we edit. We're editing together, to minimize mistakes.
Ron noticed how close they were, and wondered if maybe Draco didn't have many friends. That would be sad, he thought. Ron didn't have many friends either, because older brothers and a baby sister didn't really count as friends in the same way. Maybe Draco would want to be his friend, too. He didn't mind sharing that with Harry, as long as Draco wanted to be his friend. That would be nice, having a friend that his siblings didn't have. He offered Draco a smile, deciding to try to be friends.
So Harry was sitting at his desk, thinking about what he would write to his first crush, at the first point where he should have realized that he had it. He'd tried to start a few times, crossing things out when they didn't feel right. He had decided to write his crushes letters. He was good at writing letters. He was pretty sure that writing his crushes essays about how he'd felt would not have worked out for him.
Narcissa glared a warning at Remus before replying. "My parenting techniques are none of your business. Though I am glad that Draco was somewhere...safe." She rolled her eyes at the smallness of the apartment. "I will just wait here then, shall I?" Narcissa said as Remus left her in the main room.
Next chapter is Meowfoy's to post, but don't worry! Our pal windrider will be posting soon~
Pleased to have something to do and recognizing the name from a few other of his human's writings, Cajetan hopped once. He carefully reached out a talon, gripped the ball of parchment in it, and headed out of the open window. His human always left him an open window. It was charmed to behave like a closed window except to allow passage for the owl in and out.
Harry hugged back, accepting Draco's reassurance. He hugged a little tighter as he listened to his friend speak, grateful that Draco wasn't going to stop being his friend now. He sniffled a bit, but somehow the sound seemed happy. He answered Draco with as much care, trying to remember what Remus had told him.
"My favorite toy is Wolfy, but I don't play with him. He stays on my bed, and keeps me safe while I dream. He's very important." He nodded seriously, eyes huge. "But we can play with all the other ones. Remus says I'm going to get more toys for Christmas. I'll have lots and lots then!"
The man, Remus, took some kind of medicine every month, but said that it would hurt Harry's insides, and so Harry couldn't have it. He saw how it made the man-wolf-man lethargic, and decided he didn't ever want to take it. He would learn how not to bite and scratch and be bad. After all, whatever made him change was good. It had brought him to Remus, and Remus was good and kind.
Harry ran up to his room to read Draco's letter. He flopped onto his bed on his stomach, and wiggled his feet in the air as he read. He was very excited about the part that said that they could be friends still, and that maybe they could play together more. Uncle Remus had told him that it would be up to Draco's parents how often the boy was over, but he was hoping it was lots.
Draco nodded at Remus's comment and said. "Okay well thank you Remus!" Draco looked at the older man happily, taking in the lines on his face but even with those lines, Remus seemed genuinely happy. His parents' faces had similar lines, but mostly from frowning and glowering all the time. Remus's lines must have been caused by something different.
Draco danced about, he had stopped hugging Harry, but had grabbed his best friend's hand, still craving some form of contact. He danced while he waited for Remus to respond. Grey eyes alight with joy and hope.
Sure, Harry had been right about Malfoy being up to something as well. But that didn't mean he'd had to stalk the boy (man now) for the whole year. Maybe if he'd spent less time stalking Malfoy, he might have actually stood a chance of helping him sooner. He'd done his best to make up for it, though. He'd spoken up at the Malfoys' trials, doing his best to reduce their sentencing.
Molly stared at the trio of boys intently, trying to read them all. Ron seemed to have really enjoyed himself with the other boys and the young Malfoy boy seemed to be a kind kid. As Molly read a little more into their faces, her heart melted at the sight of such friendship and adorableness. Only someone with a closed off heart could say no to those faces, and Molly's heart was anything but closed.
"So Wolfy is your plushie that you sleep with? I have a white cat that I cuddle with at night. He makes me feel safe and loved, which helps me fall asleep. I don't usually play with him during the day much either because he stays on my bed. So we have a similar bedtime animal. I think I will get some more toys for Christmas this year...if Mother isn't too mad at me that is. I guess we will have to wait and see when my parents get here..."
Draco had two helpings of lasagna, and felt nicely full for the first time in a while. The meal had been delicious, and he had only made a little mess on himself. Even though the mess wasn't that bad Draco felt self conscious about it. His mother would have yelled at him if she saw his face right now but Remus didn't seem to mind. Draco had eaten every bite of food put on his plate, and he did his best to eat neatly because that was how he was taught.
Draco's face fell a little at the mention of his mother, clearly worried that it would make her mad. And well nothing brought Draco's mood down faster than remembering his mother and how she didn't seem to like being a mother. Draco shook himself to clear out the bad thoughts, and put a smile back on his face.
After a little while, Draco had read his book twice, and so he sat up and put up the book. He looked around, trying to see if he should get another book or not, and just decided to ask Remus.
He looked down at the ground for a moment before answering the last question. "I... Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon always called me that. Uncle Remus says they're wrong, and I'm still working on believing it." He looked back up again, breathing deeply and accepting Draco's hand. He squeezed the other boy's hand gently.
Harry loathed that title. Almost as much as he loathed the 'Boy-Who-Lived' title. Three years after the war, at 20 years of age, you'd think a bloke could at least be upgraded to Man-Who-Lived. His disdain for his monikers had been a stressing point between him and Ginny. It was why they'd broken up again after giving it another go.
"I love you too, Harry Malfoy-Potter."
Draco looked at his friend and wondered why he seemed uncomfortable all of the sudden. Draco reached out and took Harry's hand, squeezing it in comfort, hoping to ease Harry's nerves. "I promise I won't scream and I don't think you could say anything that would scare me. I already know how nice you are Harry." Draco finished talking and smiled at his friend.
Harry hugged his friend even tighter. "Of course you're going to be my best friend. Forever and ever. I promise." He sniffled, upset that Draco had been upset but glad he was calming. Remus always knew what to say, and it turned out he'd known what to say with Draco too. He was glad. Maybe it was a werewolf thing, and maybe he could learn to do it too.
Harry helped Draco get cleaned up, and then took him to the kitchen. It was much smaller, and they didn't have a house elf at all it seemed like, but there was a lot of food and it smelled good.  Harry tugged an extra chair to the table for Draco to sit, and got out a plate and silverware for him. "Uncle Remus made lasagna tonight. I love his lasagna. It's really, really good." He made sure Draco had a cup, then climbed into his own seat, bouncing in it a bit.
"Yeah, we did win, didn't we? We have each other, and the last laugh."
Harry was starting to think that maybe they'd been wrong on an entirely different level, as well. His Mind Healer had pointed out his obsession with Draco Malfoy throughout his Hogwarts years. She'd also pointed out that he tended to notice men in the room before he ever noticed girls. Harry quite thought that perhaps this was why his attempt at a relationship with Cho had been so disastrous.
Draco stared at Harry, curious as to what it was that made him sick, but glad it wasn't contagious. He liked holding Harry's hand and was glad that he seemed to have made a new friend, a real friend. Not just some kid that was forced by their parents to be at his house. Harry seemed to really want to be his friend and that made Draco's heart happy. Draco squeezed Harry's hand, letting him know that he didn't mind if Harry sometimes got sick, he still wanted to be friends.
Sensing Draco’s distress, Ron grabbed the blonde's hand and squeezed it before letting it go. "To Ingredient Mountain!" He cheered.
Draco watched his new friend speak and felt his heart breaking for him, he didn't want Harry to have to feel ashamed of who he was. And the fact that Harry felt scared to tell Draco made his heart hurt as well. Draco closed the gap between them and pulled Harry into a tight hug. Still hugging his friend, Draco chose his words carefully.
Remus nodded. "I prepare everything a month in advance, so giving you a copy of the week's plans should be no problem." He gathered the ones she'd requested and handed them over. "Today, we're just working on some reading, writing, and basic maths. Harry is quite adept at maths, and I'm sure he and Draco will help each other to excel." He offered a small smile, genuinely grateful to have a chance to do what he truly loved, which was teaching. "I don't mind you taking them home at all." He appreciated her respect, though he would be much happier once she was away and the boys felt like they could relax.
"Hullo. I'm Ron. I guess it's nice to meet you too. My favorite game is chess... it's when I get to spend time with Dad alone." He fidgeted a bit. "I like adventures, too... Maybe I could come?" He decided to be hopeful instead, and shook the blonde's hand.
Harry was utterly baffled the next morning when he came in to check on his post, and found that the crumpled up ball of paper that had been his healing assignment was nowhere to be found.
-DMHP-
"Oooh potions! I am super excited to make potions with you and Remus! That sounds like it will be super fun. Maybe your Mom will let you come learn with us more often Ron? And you can do potions with us! We won't blow them up, at least not on purpose and I am sure that Remus won't let us make anything dangerous at this point either. We are too young for that. But I am excited for you to help us find things at Ingredient Mountain! And then ice cream after, for sure! Remus always lets us get ice cream which makes me happy because I don't ever get ice cream at home. We don't really do parties or well fun at my house..." Draco tapered off, looking down at his feet.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry watching him and he felt empowered by that. Harry being nearby gave him hope as usual, and so Draco was able to put a smile back on his face and look around them, prepared to go to Ingredient Mountain, feeling hopeful again.
Draco returns to Malfoy Manor with his parents, hoping to be allowed to be Harry's friend. Meanwhile, Lucius and Narcissa plot and plan, hoping to sway Harry to the Dark. Remus just wants both boys to have their own choices and beliefs in life, whatever they happen to be. Letters are exchanged, and Remus briefly dreams of starting a daycare. How little he knows....
Harry, now cleaned up, bounced over to Draco's side. "C'mon, you can play with me, in my room, while we wait for your mum or dad to come get you." He was highly excited, wanting to show the blonde all of his toys because he'd never had any before Remus and he loved them a lot. He also wanted to show Draco his secret pet. It was a secret, because Remus had said he wasn't old enough for a pet yet, but this one talked to him and he made sure it stayed warm.
Remus smiled brightly. "Yes, we really can have ice cream now." He was happy to see the small blonde boy so happy. "I don't mind that you don't know what kind of ice cream you like. I'm sure we can help you either remember, or pick a new one." He gathered what he needed to go out.
"Are you sure it's ok if I stay? I don't want to be a burden..." Draco said using a word he had heard numerous times in his life usually about him. "Also do you know my parents? Umm my last name is Malfoy...if that helps. And if Mother is mean to you about finding me...well I am sorry for that too. I am really glad I ran into Harry though. I don't really have many friends, because well I am usually at home by myself....So I am sorry if I cause or have caused you any trouble, but I am not sorry that Harry is my friend."
Harry was working on something for his Mind Healer now, actually. Since they'd been examining his memories, she'd noticed several crushes. Harry had thought noticing them was enough, but she'd insisted that he write out what he'd been feeling at the time. He could do it however he liked, but she thought it would help him process and internalize parts of his childhood.
Harry and Draco had respectfully avoided each other since the Malfoys' trials. Harry had, of course, spoken on behalf of Draco and Narcissa. Draco, because he'd been a teen with as little choice in the matter as Harry himself. Narcissa, because she had spoken up for him when Voldemort thought him dead. He had not cared one whit about Lucius, but had argue that he receive a reduced sentencing. Having Voldemort live in your home had to have been at least partial punishment for all of them.
One family in particular came to his attention during a hurried shopping trip to Diagon Alley with his mother. Narcissa hated bringing her son out in public, and so she dragged him along at a hurried pace. During this outing, Draco's eye was caught by a group of people with flaming red hair. Clearly they were all related and his mother stuck her nose up as she passed them, showing her disapproval. Curious, Draco had watched the group as he waited for his mother to finish her shopping. The kids all seemed rather happy albeit a tad shabby, and the mother's face glowed when she looked at her children. The father and mother were going to split up to shop with their kids, and before they left each other hugs were exchanged. Real hugs, full of love and comfort, something Draco could never remember happening in his household. Draco stared at the family longingly, but was dragged out of the store by his mother before he had gotten his fill. Draco trudged along behind her, barely able to keep pace since he wanted to watch the family some more and he kept looking behind him. Draco didn't know who they were, and didn't dare ask his mother about them based on her attitude, but he made a note of them and decided to always look for them when he was in Diagon Alley. Even though he was only four, Draco knew his house wasn't the loving place that he was beginning to suspect it should be…
Harry nodded a bit, hugging Draco tightly once more. "I'll write soon, okay?"
"Umm. I have a book about snakes. I know that they lay eggs, and that there are magic ones, and that some have poison and some eat by squishing things to death. And once in a while they shed their whole skins! Even over their eyes!"
Harry was just thrilled that Draco liked his room. He hoped that the other boy's parents took a long time to come and get him, so that they could play as long as possible. He would have to get up and learn things in the morning, with Remus, but that was the morning and it could wait! Draco was here right now and that was so much more important than learning things in the morning. He tugged some toys over and plopped down to play, looking up at Draco invitingly.
He still stood out in Britain, since his species was supposed to be native to Indonesia. His coloring allowed him to blend in a bit more, though, since it would take a trained eye in ornithology to actually realize that the bird was out of place. Harry like that, a bit. He thought he deserved a bird that blended in. After all, there had already been a Hedwig, and he didn't think that this owl was a replacement. Not in the sense that he would ever take her place in Harry's heart. Still, he was quite a handsome specimen and Harry liked his looks.
Draco looked confused at Harry saying Remus was coming upstairs but he assumed that Harry's hearing was better than his and so he just nodded and watched as Harry put his pet back outside. Draco looked around Harry's room again, his spirits sinking because if Remus was on his way up, that most likely meant that his parents or at least one of his parents had arrived…
"Well this smells delicious sir! I am excited to try it!" Draco said sincerely as Remus dished some lasagna onto his plate. This, Draco decided, looking around the apartment once more, this is a home.
"Well I think it would be fun if you learned with us, and then we could get to know you better and become a group of super close friends!" Draco said as he danced about happily. "Should we go ahead and do our reading now? Oh and when your Mum comes back to pick you up we could all ask her if you could learn with us too!" Draco said happily as he danced about it a bit more, then he ran towards the bookshelves to grab one of his favorite books. After retrieving it, he went and sat down next to Harry, but still in between Harry and Ron, excited to have another friend.
Draco tentatively reached a hand out towards the snake, not sure if he should try to pet it or not so he spoke to Harry. "Umm can I pet it? Or do they need to sniff me first? I have never met a snake before. But my family has loads of pictures of snakes around the manor. Apparently it's the symbol of our family's usual school House. Whatever that means." Draco said with a shrug, his hand was still reaching towards the snake but hadn't quite reached the animal yet.
A few weeks later, Draco's mother said they were going into town for the day to do some Christmas shopping. Draco's eyes lit up at the thought, and he rushed to make sure he was presentable before his mother could change her mind. Narcissa looked Draco over before they left the Manor and gave him a curt nod of something close to approval, but definitely not love. Diagon Alley had more people around than usual, but Draco's eyes scanned the crowd hungrily regardless, looking for that flaming red hair. Draco was so distracted that he wasn't watching the path ahead of him, and sadly neither was Narcissa. She was merely dragging Draco by his arm, forcing him to move along behind her, not worrying about whether or not he could keep pace. She was a woman on a mission and nothing was going to stand in her way, not even her son. Narcissa had only brought Draco along to pick out his presents for the holiday, and then they would return home. As Draco's eyes scanned the crowd frantically looking for that nice family, he lost track of where he was going completely but didn't realize it until he ran into something. Or more accurately someone. Draco's mother kept walking, unaware that her contact with her son had been severed. Draco, stood up shakily ready to murmur an apology to whoever he had walked into, and race to catch his mother, when his eyes finally took in the kid in front of him. He had to be the same age as Draco, or very close to it, and his hair was jet black. Draco thought he looked familiar but couldn't quite place him.
Remus offered her a polite smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. He wasn't worried about her noticing it, as she wasn't exactly meeting his eyes. "It's my pleasure. Draco was on his best behavior last time, and I know he will be in the future. He's a good boy, and I look forward to teaching him. If I need any help with lessons, in any way, I'll be sure to ask. Have a good day, Lady Malfoy." He escorted her out the door as she left. Once she was gone, he turned to the boys. "What do you say we be very, very bad for just a little bit? How would you like ice cream right after breakfast? I know I want some, after that." His smile was kinder, and did reach his eyes this time.
-HPDM-
Remus and Harry's morning went much differently, with the older werewolf tickling the younger awake, and cooking breakfast himself. They didn't have any elves, but it didn't seem to make a difference, and Harry had never really known life with one, so he didn't know any different. They had French toast and sausages for breakfast, and then Harry cleaned up and got dressed.
Harry nodded to Draco, eyes bright. "I'll write you really soon!" He held in his desire to dance, sensing that his friend's mother would not appreciate it.
Harry was looking forward to it. He had noticed the blonde boy in Diagon Alley who had stared at all the people hugging. He had stared when Remus had hugged Harry as well. Harry wondered why the blonde had smelled and looked so sad, but hadn't had the courage to go and ask. He thought, maybe, if he saw the boy again, next time he would ask. Maybe the boy had been like Harry, and all he needed was someone to want to be his friend. Harry decided that he would talk to the boy, next time he saw him, and be his friend and give him hugs. He didn't want the boy to smell so sad any more. He knew what it was like to be sad and lonely, and he didn't want anyone to be that way again.
With that he followed Harry to the bathroom, curious to see what dinner would be, only just realizing he was hungry as his stomach grumbled loudly.
Draco hugged Remus back, and let the man hold him. He felt safe in Remus's arms, and at Remus's house, and really that was the only time he felt safe. Draco listened carefully to Remus's words and started to nod as he understood. Draco felt tears welling up in his eyes regardless.
"I thought it was a good way, too.” Harry said, changing the subject back to pranks. “It didn't hurt him, just made him angry at first and made him look silly for a long while." He smiled, cheering up again. "Uncle Remus said he'd accept any friends I made. So he'd better accept you. C'mon, my house is this way." He tugged Draco along to the turn off, and then down the back-alley to their apartment. It wasn't fancy, but it was liveable and everything worked. That's all Harry cared about.
Draco nodded happily and then went back to his book. He knew his mother was on her way out and he didn't want her to feel like he was holding her up by talking. Narcissa nodded at her son again and left the room. She called out to Dobby and instructed him to make whatever Draco wanted for lunch, and then she left the Manor.
Harry giggled happily, glad Draco was feeling better. He was happy to go and play with Draco until his mother arrived. From there, Remus and Molly worked on making sure that Draco would be able to attend Ron's birthday, and be friends with Ron, without upsetting his parents. Ron was equally pleased, and fiercely loyal to Draco and Harry. He loved that they were his friends, and only he got to be friends with Draco and Harry.
Harry nodded. "I'm not giving it to you so you'll be my friend. I'm giving it to you because you are my friend, Draco."
Harry noticed Draco looking at the joke items, and picked up a couple of extra ones for him to try. Ones that shouldn't get him into trouble with his parents. They mostly changed into something else, or sent a spray of harmless sparks somewhere. He liked those ones best, sometimes, when he just wanted something silly to laugh at.
"Thank you for forgiving me, Draco. No one will stop you from being friends with Ron and Harry. We'll do everything we can to make the party safe and happy for everyone, I promise."
Ron did not look happy to be there at all. He had been hoping to spend the day alone with Harry, and that hope was foiled by learning there was another boy there. He always had to share, but he thought maybe this time it wasn't entirely anyone's fault. It's not like the rest of his siblings asked to be sick. He looked at the blonde boy curiously, sitting through his introduction.
Narcissa nodded in response and stepped inside, following a rather excited Draco. Draco went straight to Harry's side as he replied with his own "Good Morning!" His grey eyes sparkled in joy and happiness.
Remus read over Narcissa's letter before handing Harry his, considering how to reply. He was pleased that Draco had been able to write back, and pleased to know that the little blonde would be permitted to visit Harry. He had hoped so, and was glad he didn't have to disappoint his pup. He shooed Harry up to his room to answer Draco while he wrote a reply to the boy's mother.
Harry grinned brightly, plopping himself near both of them. "Remus says, since Ron is visiting, we don't have to do any lessons but the reading ones. And they're really short. He sent a note to your mum, Draco, explaining why. So after we've read, we can all go on an adventure." He liked that they were getting along, and thought maybe Draco could be good for Ron too. He hoped so.
"Sorry about that, Cajetan. I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm going to bed now. You have a good night." Harry had never found it odd that he spoke to his owls. He'd talked to Hedwig. She'd been a great listener. Cajetan was pretty good at it too, though his opinions varied greatly from what Hedwig's had. Still, he appreciated the listening ear.
Remus smiled as well. "We would be happy to have Draco over more often, if that's what you decide. He was very well behaved and polite while here, and seemed to have a good time. Please do let me know what you decide." He patted Draco's shoulder gently, reluctantly giving him over to his mother.
"I do live near here, with Uncle Remus. He's the best. I don't mind you sticking with me." Harry grinned a bit and tugged Draco down to the joke shop.
"Good to see you have been using your manners Draco, we do our best to make sure you know how to act around others. Glad to see it has paid off. As I said I will talk to your father but at this point, with the way you look right now I doubt he will be able to say no. Which means we will be in touch soon Remus. Is owl the best way to contact you? I will talk to Lucius as soon as he gets home tonight and write you afterward. Thank you for keeping Draco out of the street while I was away. Harry, thank you for being kind to my Draco, and for being a friend when he needed one." Narcissa finished speaking and nodded at both Harry and Remus before dragging Draco out of the door behind her.
"Oh, ok, if you are sure...Draco said in response to the gift. Then, completely surprising himself, Draco gave Harry a hug in thanks and well appreciation. He had never felt so wanted before, and he was grateful to Harry for it.
Harry squirmed a bit, looking down. "U-um... Well.... You gotta promise you aren't gonna scream and be scared, okay?"
Draco shrugged and then said. "Well I hope your Uncle Remus won't judge me based on my parents.”
He enjoyed playing with the plushes, giggling when the cat flopped as well. His eyes lit up happily, aware that he was the one making things happen, but trying not to force it. He thought it was the very best that Draco could make things happen, too, and wondered if maybe his new friend could talk to his secret pet with him. That would be really neat, if someone else could do that, too. Then they'd have a secret language, just for them!
"Well I am glad you have your Uncle Remus then, he sounds like a really good person. I think if we don't find Mother before we get back to your place, I would like to meet him. But Mother isn't always nice to people, neither is Father...so there is a chance your Uncle won't want to meet me. Apparently my parents are well known..."
-DMHP-
Draco straightened up as Harry and Remus finished speaking. While following Harry to the bathroom Draco spoke to Remus, his fears once again rising.
Once they were out of the shop, he fished his purchase out and handed the bag to Draco. "Here. This is for you. Because you're my first friend I ever picked for myself, and you look nicer when you smiled. These should make you smile. Happy Christmas." He beamed brightly.
"Of course you can help Ron! It should be fun! I will probably need some help spelling depending on what Remus needs us to get, but I think we can take turns writing down the items we need to get while out on our adventure. Do you want to go first Ron?"
Draco saw his mother waiting and her foot was tapping, showing her impatience. She listened to Remus talk about the boys with only a small amount of interest. "I am not sure my Draco knows how to write and read well enough to send letters but I am sure he will be able to learn soon enough. Thank you for watching Draco today, I am glad you were home when we got separated. He seems to have had a good day so maybe at some point the boys could do this again. I will talk it over with Lucius when I get home. I am usually busy during the days and so is my husband so Draco spends most of his days at home. Maybe this way he can get out more and interact with people his age. We will have to see."
"Okay Ron, that sounds great! Thanks for saying you will try to make it so I can come, that means a lot to me Ron. You are an awesome friend. I would really like to come to your birthday party. Draco said happily, glad to see that Ron really wanted to be his friend.
"I'd like that, a lot. My brothers don't like to take me on adventures with them, and my little sister is too little for them." The redhead's eyes were bright, and he seemed more cheerful now.
Harry gave a happy wriggle of excitement, settling in to read, wanting to get it done so they could go on their adventure. He was completely on board with asking Mrs. Weasley if Ron could come and study with them. He knew Remus wouldn't mind, because he knew Remus really loved teaching. He wished that Remus could be hired as a teacher, because he was really, really good at it and he deserved it, but he was also happy that Remus was his teacher, and now Draco's and maybe Ron's.
"I think Uncle Remus is pretty awesome." Before turning to walk home holding the other boy’s hand.
The next morning Narcissa got up early, and woke up Draco. "Time to get ready so we can head to Remus and Harry's. Get dressed and get a bag of whatever toys you want to take with you ready and meet me downstairs in the kitchen. Dobby is in charge of breakfast as per usual so when you get to the kitchen you can start eating while I finish getting ready. I will meet you down there in a little while." Narcissa said abruptly, as was her usual way of waking up Draco.
As they entered the shop Harry said, "In here, they use these things for pranking. It's like playing a joke, but on lots of people instead of just one, or a really big one on just one person, and not getting caught if you can help it." He held the blonde's hand, happy. He figured the questions about the shop were more important right now since they were in the shop, but he would answer the ones about Remus later.
Draco danced around as they got their ice cream orders placed. He was excited at the prospect of ice cream as well as having fun with his friends when they got back to Remus's to eat. Draco followed Harry back to his house, and enjoyed the rest of the day with his friends, looking forward to asking Ron's Mum if he could come over more often to study with them all.
Harry beamed a bit, glad that they were getting along for now.
He fell asleep writing his letter, head slumped to one side of it, and Remus had to put him to bed. There, he snuggled his Wofly, dreaming about all the fun he would have with his best friend, and all the adventures they would have together.
As Harry stared, Remus sighed softly and gave in. He couldn't deny his pup something this important. "Alright, Harry Pup. He can stay for a little while, but I'll have to send a message to his parents later on, so that they know where he is and that he's safe." Remus didn't try to hug either of them, knowing just how touchy Harry had been at first and seeing it in Draco. "I've got dinner ready, so why don't you two get cleaned up, and then we can all eat?" He smiled, and meant it, glad that Harry was making friends. He hoped that Draco's parents didn't ruin the boy they way they had been ruined. Maybe his pup could help with that.
Cajetan hooted again, forgiving his human easily. After all, it was clear he hadn't meant the disturbance. He eyed the crumpled up piece of parchment on the floor, and waited for his human to head to bed. It didn't take long, and once he was sure not to be caught the owl glided over to the parchment. Near the top, he could see the name of the recipient of this oddly shaped letter.
When Harry woke up, he gathered up his letter and begged Remus to send it, hoping dearly that it would be accepted and that Draco's father had said that they could be friends. He bounced a bit, until Remus woke up enough to send the letter off. He spent the rest of the day being as good as possible, as if that would have some effect on what the Malfoys had decided to do.
-DMHP-
Ron perked up a bit at Draco offering him to go first. He glanced over at Harry too, but smiled. "Yeah. I don't mind needing a little help. Mum says help is how we learn." He took the quill and let Remus help him spell out the first thing they needed on their list. His handwriting was a little sloppy, but readable. Remus smiled to see the two getting along.
"And I want chocolate!" Ron exclaimed excitedly remembering why they were at the ice cream parlor.
There were a few additional gifts, from a few people along the way that they'd trusted to keep the wedding on the down low. Neither of them had really wanted a ton of fuss about themselves after the war. They were tired, and figuring out who they wanted to be. Harry had decided that, despite his obvious (read: forced) talent for hunting down Dark Lords, he didn't really want to be an Auror. He had gone through the process of taking his NEWTS outside of school, and was currently working on a Mastery in Defense Against the Dark Arts. He'd put in an application to teach at Hogwarts, as the end of that was coming up soon.
Remus offered Narcissa a polite smile. "I apologize for the wait. Draco and Harry were having quite a bit of fun, and didn't want to stop right away. Harry and Draco seem to wish to write to each other. I hope that you'll be expecting a letter from him soon." He squeezed Draco's hand lightly. "It was lovely to have you, Draco. I hope you can visit again soon, you made our small flat very lively."
“Are we headed to your place now? I still don't see Mother..." Draco finished speaking, looking about and sighing. Draco reached out to take Harry's hand in hopes of comforting both of them, “I don't think you are a freak, I think you are a nice person, why do you call yourself that?"
Draco woke up the next morning excited to hear when he could see his friend Harry again. Dobby had made breakfast by the time Draco had made his way downstairs. Draco sniffed the air happily at the smell of bacon and sat down at the table. He pulled a plate towards him as his parents talked in the kitchen. Draco ate his breakfast quietly until an owl arrived. He got excited when he saw the owl, but he knew better than to get up from the table before he was dismissed. Narcissa jumped at the sound but went to the window and let the owl in.
It was while Draco was reading an illustrated version of "Tales of Beedle the Bard" that Narcissa received a letter from Remus. She read it, and thought about the idea of just dropping Draco off most days before she left the house to socialize and what have you. Narcissa was certain that Lucius wouldn't mind if she did this since they had already agreed to let Draco be friends with the Potter boy, hoping that in time it would work out in their favor. Thoughtfully, Narcissa consulted a watch on the wall that showed the time in terms of the Lunar Cycle. The full moon was still quite a ways away. Narcissa nodded at the clock as if it could see her thinking and pulled out another piece of parchment.
Harry promptly named his new bird Cajetan. He thought it was fitting, given that luck had been how they'd connected and luck was definitely what he would need for his friendships to weather the bird. Cajetan was aggressive, noisy, messy, and rude. If the bird didn't think he was getting enough attention, he would insert himself into Harry's daily schedule. He also barely waited for Harry to finish any letter he was writing, whisking it away almost before the ink had dried on the recipient's address.
"Oh your friends' prank sounds funny to me! I think that's a good way to get back at their brother for being mean, but I don't have a brother so I guess I wouldn't really know...." Draco said with a giggle at Harry’s story.
Ron took his mother's hand, looking up at her. Someday, he was going to get a great job, and make lots of money, so that she didn't have to worry about it any more, and she could do what she wanted where she wanted. He didn't like it when his mother talked about not being able to afford things. "Okay, Mum."
Lucius and Narcissa are still monsters. Harry will hopefully prevent Draco from becoming a monster.
"I'd had no clue. Looks like we won, though. Can't believe we won a bet we didn't even know about." Harry's eyes shone happily as he looked at Draco from the chair he'd slumped in after they'd finished arranging the living room to their liking. Sure, they had magic, but they still had to do some work.
Draco giggled at the accidental sweater magic, it sounded like it had been a good thing for Harry at least. He was awed by Harry's ability to do magic randomly, he rarely saw other kids so he didn't realize it was that common. Draco also was able to do magic at random times but nothing as cool as shrinking something he didn't want to wear or heating up a branch forever. Draco was impressed by his new friend, and to make things better Harry was really nice.
After a quick breakfast, Draco was ready and practically dancing in excitement in his chair. Narcissa came down, grabbed her own plate, and ate hurriedly whilst drinking a mimosa. Narcissa watched Draco quietly, not a fan of the dancing he was doing, but she was still glad to see him more animated. This showed promise already, to make him appear to seem more normal and happy. Naricssa finished her breakfast, got up, and grabbed her bag. "Well Draco are you ready to go? If so let's head to the fireplace."
Draco looked his new friend over, trying to get a good read on him. He seemed to really want to be Draco's friend, for whatever reason, and he seemed sincere about his Uncle being a good person. Harry also seemed determined to be friends with Draco regardless of what anyone else thought, and he seemed capable of sticking up for himself. So Draco shook himself a bit to get some of his fear to go away, or at least lessen it, and nodded to Harry.
"Did you know that they'd been betting on us getting together?" Draco asked Harry later, curious to know if he'd been as blindsided by the gift. It was still making them both chuckle as they settled to bed for the night.
"Oh, ok, if you are sure...Draco said in response to the gift. Then, completely surprising himself, Draco gave Harry a hug in thanks and well appreciation. He had never felt so wanted before, and he was grateful to Harry for it.
Harry held the snake steady. He was good at holding things steady. The snake lifted its head to stare imperiously at Draco, quite offended to be left out of the conversation. "Of courssse you may pet me, sssmall sspeaker. I like the ssscaless of my hood sscratched." It spread said hood for Draco to attend to, tongue flicking. "I don't need to sssmell you. I have already done sssso."
Hermione and Ron were both amused and frustrated in turns by Cajetan. While they appreciated hearing from Harry again regularly, they were not so fond of the bird's manners. Despite this, they put up with him. If Harry was happy with him, they weren't about to tell him to get a different bird. A mail owl was a mail owl, after all. Cajetan did his job dutifully. None of Harry's mail every arrived at its destination damaged or torn. The same could not always be said of the recipients, but birds would be birds.
He blushed when Draco called him the nicest person, though his darker skin made it so the blush didn't show nearly as much as the blonde's did. His skin had gotten darker after the funny dog - wolf, Remus said it was a werewolf - had bitten him.
Draco debated hugging him, but thought better of it, that wasn't really allowed in his household, no real signs of affection were. Lucius then told Draco good night, and left the boy to his dreams. Draco hopped into bed, excited about his day. He dreamed of more fun times with Harry, and wished to learn more about his new friend.
“I hope so Harry!" Draco said excitedly as his mother dragged him out the door.
Harry was absorbed in his book, having picked a longer one. Ron finished his book, a slower reader but good at comprehending once he'd read it, and put it up. He came over to see what Draco and Remus were doing, climbing up on the other side of the table into a chair to look. "Can I help too?"
"Yeah, I don't know how I made it stay warm, but I did. Sometimes I can make things float, and sometimes things just disappear if I get afraid, or if I don't like them. I made a sweater shrink once, before Uncle Remus came to find me. At least, I think I did. Aunt Petunia was trying to put it on me, but it was ugly, and I didn't want it. When she stopped, it barely fit her hand. She said it shrunk in the wash." He was avoiding answering the last question, and knew it, but the story was pretty good he thought.
Narcissa said all of this without much emotion, merely stating facts of life as she knew it. Then she allowed Harry and Draco to hug once more, though she eyed it a little cautiously, wondering what had caused that friendship to blossom so quickly.
Draco didn't really mind when Potter wrote. He'd grown used to the idea that Potter was straight and likely never would return his absolutely childish crush. Which was yet another reason that Draco had moved out of the Manor. His father had been livid to learn that his only son was gay and would not be making any kind of, "appropriate pureblood match."
Harry and Draco Malfoy-Potter (they hadn't been able to decide which last name to take, and so hyphenated) were going through their wedding gifts. There were the expected ones, from Draco's parents. After all, Harry had declared his intentions immediately after the war. He'd made sure to keep it private, though. Draco's family wasn't entirely in good graces at that point, after all, and he didn't want to cause them more scandal. Besides, he'd had about enough of being in the paper as they had.
As he listened, questions formed in his mind, questions Draco quickly asked Harry when he paused to switch directions. "Who is Uncle Remus? I take it he isn't related to the Aunt you seem to not like? Well if you are sure you don't mind I would like to stick with you, for as long as I can at least. Eventually Mother will notice my absence. Granted I am sure she will be mad when she does...."  Draco shuddered at the thought before turning to follow Harry.
Draco accepted his gift from Harry, and put it into his pocket before going down the stairs, following Remus. Curious, Draco looked down to see who had come to get him, and he was unsurprised to see his mother waiting. She only looked a little annoyed though, mostly she seemed impatient.
Draco's eyes lit up and he sat up straighter. He wanted to hug his mother, but he knew better so he just tapped his foot happily instead. "That sounds awesome Mother! I am excited to go visit again! Harry is really fun to play with. I will make sure my room is clean tonight so that I can go, okay?"
Draco ran to the grocery store behind Harry, keeping an eye on Ron as well, wanting to make sure that Ron felt included. They got all the groceries they needed in a fun and adventurous way. After paying for the groceries, the boys looked to Harry. "What's the last stop on our adventure Harry? Or was this the last one?" Draco asked curiously, trusting Harry implicitly as always.
There were a few gifts from people that arrived shortly after the quiet little announcement was made. They'd opted not to announce it in the Daily Prophet. The sensationalism that the paper still pursued would have seen them overwhelmed by a combination of well wishes and hate mail. They just weren't interested in all the fuss, so they'd asked Luna if she'd publish their announcement in the Quibbler. Luna had agreed to keep quiet, and she had sent them a lovely (and odd) plant as a gift. A few other writers from her paper (which had picked up in popularity after the articles from Harry and the true facts after the war) had sent a few things too when they heard.
Draco looked around Harry's room, enjoying the color scheme and how it felt roomy. His room was dark and well, made of stone, so the walls didn't really have a color to them. He had more toys in his room but that didn't mean anything, his room felt nothing like Harry's.
Here's another chapter, come and gone. I swear, these will likely get longer as we get past the 'we're setting up story' stages.
Ron gave a joyful cheer. "Yes! I want to, I promise I'll be good, Mum! I'll do my best to learn and do good, I swear." He hugged Draco as they danced. "Can I have formal invitations for my birthday, Mum? Only... Draco wants to come, and I don't think his mum will let him if we don't give formal ones. A-and... I've saved all my allowance, do you think maybe it's enough to have my party at the ice cream place?" He looked up at her hopefully, his eyes shining.
Draco jumped a little at his mother's voice, he hadn't heard her come up the stairs. He looked up at her as he answered. "I am almost done mother, just need to put my name on it." Draco turned back to his parchment, his tongue sticking out a little in concentration as he finished writing his name. "There! I am done! Can I put one of those cool sticker things on it?" Draco asked his mother excitedly.
Draco murmured sleepily and woke up easily, getting out of bed quickly so as to not get yelled at. He knew better than to dawdle when getting out of bed. Draco got dressed hurriedly, full of excitement to be spending the day with Harry, but also to be getting out of the Manor. It was such a lonely place to spend the day by himself. Draco packed his favorite kitty plushie, and a few of his other favorite toys, most of them animals or miniature Quidditch gear toys. Then Draco grabbed the bag and headed downstairs to get to the kitchen. He could smell the bacon and pancakes and his mouth started to water. Dobby placed a plate on the table as Draco sat down and he started to eat.
"So if you are in control of yourself, why is Remus scared you will bite someone? And how do you listen to your wolf? Does it like speak to you? Or is it more of a feeling? Sorry I am just very curious. I am glad you don't have to drink the poison smelling potion though, that doesn't sound good. And I promise I won't tell anyone about Remus's secret, though I am glad you told me. I would hate to think of you alone during such a painful time, I would have to try to sneak away if you were going to be all alone and in pain. And oooh! School together! That sounds fun for sure! Maybe as we get older we could do sleep overs and such and then try on a full moon. I would like to be there to keep you company sometime. You are my best friend Harry, and I want you to feel safe and comfortable whenever possible." Draco took Harry's hand again and gave it a friendly squeeze.
Ron smiled brightly. "I mean, I don't mind learning... Mum just gets so busy about it, and my brothers need help more, 'cause they're going to school sooner. I don't mind waiting while you read. A-and I'd like to get better at writing. Maybe... Maybe I could come learn with you guys? That way Mum won't have to work as hard." He looked hopeful about it. "Only... maybe we could ask together, because Mum is really busy, and sometimes forgets to listen. She doesn't mean to..."
"I am not scared of you Harry, but I am sorry that you have had to go through all this and that people don't always treat you nice because of it. I am not sad for you exactly, but I wish you hadn't been bit because you said it makes others scared of you. But I am not scared and I still want to be your friend. I don't know much about werewolves though, so I am a little curious. But I don't want to make you feel bad either if I ask the wrong question. So how about you can just tell me whatever it is you want about being a werewolf as we get to be better friends? Does that sound like a plan? I am glad that you found Remus though, he seems great and I can tell he really cares about you which is good." Draco finished speaking, pulled away from Harry, and gave him a smile.
Harry frowned, though, when Draco talked about Uncle Remus not wanting to meet him. He wouldn't think Uncle Remus would feel that way.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry watched Draco, noticing in him signs of what he had felt living with the Dursleys. He knew that was wrong, because Remus had shown him better, and he instantly felt like maybe Draco needed to be shown better too. He offered a bright smile, and listened intently while the other boy talked.
"Well thank you Remus, sir, that means a lot to me. I have never been told that before. But I think I would like to come here to visit more often if I could...but that depends on Mother I guess..." Draco finished speaking with a  resigned sigh.
His face lit up a bit, and he held out his hand to shake. Remus did that lots, so it must be the right thing to do. "Hi! My name's Harry. Sorry I ran into you. Are you okay?"
Draco ran and laughed happily and ran as best as he could, making sure he didn't run into anyone in his hurry. Ron was right beside him as he ran, they were both following Harry, who had a good lead on them. "So how much ice cream can we get today Harry?" Draco asked excitedly as they entered the Ice Cream Palace.
Ron stopped and hugged Draco tightly, not liking that he didn't have fun at home. Draco had returned Ron's hug, though he had been taken aback by the suddenness of it. Draco was getting used to hugs still, but he did really enjoy them. "We can have all the fun you want while we're with Harry. Everyone should have fun." Now Ron really didn't care whether or not Draco's family was bad. Draco wasn't bad, and he needed friends. Ron knew how to be a good friend, and he would be Draco's friend along with Harry. "And you can come to my birthday, for sure. I'll throw a tantrum if I have to, so you can come. I promise."
The bloke Harry had bought the new owl from had said the bird was a specimen of
"Good morning Remus, are those the lesson plans?" Narcissa asked, looking at the papers on the desk. "I am well, I hope you both are too. If you don't mind I will take them home to look them over? Especially if you have them for the whole week? That way I can just look them over at the same time. If not that's fine for today. But if possible I would prefer to have the lessons for the week in advance, if that's not too much trouble. I know that Draco is excited for these visits. So other than looking over the lesson plans I think we are good here." Narcissa said quietly. She clearly was out of her comfort zone in this place, but she was also treating Remus as respectfully as she could so it seemed like progress to her.
He waited impatiently for his friend to write, or to hear from Draco's parents. He wanted very badly to be able to spend as much time as possible with his best friend, and hoped that his parents would not be awful about it. Aunt Petunia would have been, but he hoped that maybe they weren't as much like her as Draco's mum had seemed.
Draco blushed slightly at the snake's compliment, not used to receiving them. "Glad I could help you!" Draco said as he continued to scratch the snake's scales, smiling happily. Draco held himself up higher as the snake suggested keeping him, happy to have Harry's pets' approval, he figured it meant a lot to Harry as well. As Harry started to talk again, Draco looked at his friend, listening intently with his eyes shining brightly.
Harry beamed when Draco squeezed his hand, his green eyes sparkling brightly. There were tiny flecks of gold in them that made them seem to glitter more than anyone's eyes had a right to.
Despite all of this, Harry adored Cajetan. When Harry interacted with the bird, he was well behaved. Cajetan would sit for him, permitted Harry to pet his head, and generally showed much more restraint. The bird was a bloody menace to everyone else, though, and didn't seem to care one whit how many times Harry asked him to be nice to others. The only exception to this rule- to everyone's collective surprise- was Draco Malfoy. Cajetan seemed to love Malfoy almost as much as he did love Harry.
Remus gave them time to fix things up a bit. He didn't want to pry into their friendship, and hoped that Harry would tell him about what they'd talked about. He had Draco's gift from Harry in his hands, intent on tucking it into Draco's pocket before the boy left. When he got to the door, Harry had already settled the snake and was hugging Draco. He knocked on the door gently. "Boys... Draco's mother is here to take him home. Harry, you can write to Draco later. I'm sure he'd be happy to get your letters. After all, he is your friend." He made sure his voice was loud enough for Narcissa to hear.
Harry was vibrating slightly with excitement, but otherwise contained it well. He wanted to howl for joy! His best friend, the very first one he'd ever picked for himself, was going to be able to come and visit more!! He blushed faintly at Draco's praise and smiled again, his eyes shining with his joy.
Harry watched his new friend, sad that he was so nervous. He hugged Draco suddenly, not wanting him to be sad any more and knowing that hugs cheered him up.
Draco smiled happily at Harry and Remus, glad to see that they were indeed truthful to their word. They had said to him that he was welcome at any time, and here they were saying the exact same things to his mother. Clearly Remus wasn't super comfortable around the woman, but he was fighting for Draco and Harry to remain friends. This gave Draco hope. He looked up at his mother, happiness radiating from him as well as hope.
Draco made a face at being told he looked like his father. It wasn't a rude face or disrespectful, but clearly the fact that he looked like his father bothered him.
"Umm Remus, did I manage to get clean enough? If my parents see me with a dirty face they won't be happy at all. I am already going to be in trouble for getting lost..." Draco said quietly, looking down at the floor again. He clearly didn't want to go home, but he knew he had to. So he needed to look his best.
Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy Manor and fortune. But is it all it's cracked up to be? Read about his childhood in the manor to find out!
Draco's face lit up at Harry's mention of a book about snakes. "Oooh! That snake book sounds awesome! Though shedding your skin doesn't sound like fun." Draco made a face at that, the idea disconcerted him a little especially the eyes part. "Maybe we could look through your snake book together sometime?" Draco asked hopefully, he liked Harry's snake and was curious to learn more about them in general. Harry smiled faintly, relaxing a little as Draco giggled at his story and asked about reading his book. "Yeah, we can! I like the pictures and learning about snakes."
Also, keep an eye out for satellite stories that will either fill in plot holes or provide some neat background information for events that are mentioned, but don't change the main narrative.
Draco oohed and ahhed at the store's wares, curious as to whether or not they really worked and how funny they were. He kind of wanted to try them out, but he had no money to spend, because he was always told he didn't need any. Even though he spent most of his time alone his parents didn't seem to worry about him getting lost, or really think about him much at all.
Draco slowly reached out to take the boy's offered hand and shook it uncertainly before speaking. "Oh um, hi... My name is Draco. I am pretty sure it was my fault, I wasn't watching where I was going and Mother was dragging me so fast...." Draco broke off and rubbed his wrists which he realized were once again sore from his mother's grip.
"If they yell at you, then I'm going to yell back. Because you didn't get lost on purpose, and they shouldn't yell at you." He nodded, determined. "I wanna do lots of things with you, because you're my friend." He hugged Draco before they started to play.
Remus smiled at Draco. "I had guessed that you might be a Malfoy. You look a bit like your father. I think that it's wonderful that you're Harry's friend, and you most certainly are not a burden. You'll always be welcome in our home, Draco. No matter what." He didn't much care for Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, but their son seemed to just be a lonely little boy who needed a good friend. If Harry had picked him, there was nothing to do but make sure that Draco became part of their circle of friends.
-HPDM-
The snake nodded in its own way in return, accepting his apology. It hissed happily as its scales were scratched, tongue flicking lazily. "That'sss nice. You do it very well. We ssshould keep thisss one, ssspeaker-pup." It preened happily under the attention, enjoying the warmth inside and of the boys' bodies.
Narcissa waited for the ink to dry and then rolled up the parchment, happy with her response. She knew that Draco would be happy as well, and that would reflect better on the family. She had heard whisperings at the latest gathering about her son always seeming sad and alone and she didn't like that kind of talk. This was the Malfoy family and they deserved great respect. Hopefully this new friend of Draco's would help quell that negative talk. Narcissa sent her owl out once more, and headed up to Draco's room.
"You know how to make potions on your own? And one of them tastes like chocolate! That sounds so cool! You can fly on a broom already too? Wow! Maybe sometime you could help me learn?" Draco asked excitedly. "And we could make potions together sometime! I am sure we will have lots of fun together!"
"I always do my best to have lots of fun with Harry because it's nice to be around friends...and honestly other people. I am glad you are here with us today Ron, you are a good friend too, and I think having you here has added to our fun. And I would like to come to your birthday...but I don't know if mother will let me, and well most people don't like my family so your Mum may not want me either...and I don't want to get you in trouble, especially not on your birthday..." Draco finished speaking looking at the ground again. He was rather ashamed of his family, even though he couldn't quite figure out why, except that they weren't really nice or friendly.
Ron grinned brightly at the other boys. "Yeah!" He bounded out of the house with them, laughing as Harry led them helter-skelter to the bookstore, where they had to traverse the Mighty Book Jungle to find the titles that Remus wanted. He liked that he was included in an adventure this time, completely oblivious to the awe of some people as the three of them ran through the streets; a Malfoy, a Potter, and a Weasley, playing together happily.
Harry beamed. "We have..." He counted. "Six gold ones, and ten silver ones, for ice cream." He did a little dance. "A-and... I'll help. I bet if I ask nice, she'll let you go. And sometimes... Mister Florian lets people have parties here, so maybe Ron could do a party here." He danced more. "I'm gonna try the cherry-lime. Cuz I like cherries, and limes."
"Umm. Well, the twins told me about how they turned their brother's hair green on purpose once. That was pretty funny. I guess Percy had been being pretty mean, and so they pranked him with dye in his shampoo, and turned his hair green for three weeks. Harry said answering the question about pranks the twins had played. “Their mum was pretty mad, but it sounds funny to me." He grinned a bit, finding what he'd wanted and buying that too. Remus had taught him all about his Gringotts vault and how Wizard money worked. He didn't usually buy a lot, but it was nice to know he could if he wanted.
Ron broke away to hug Draco when he looked sad. "It's okay. I'm still gonna be your friend. You're nice, and I had fun."
Harry hugged his friend tighter at the confession. "I wish you could live with me and Remus." His words were a soft whisper just for Draco's ears. They held each other, drawing comfort. Remus hugged them both, having heard because of his superior hearing but not letting on.
"Have a good night Ron, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow!" Draco said as happily as he could while still recovering from his crying. Draco waved and watched the Weasleys leave Remus's. As soon as the door shut behind them Draco lost his control, ran to his bag of toys, grabbed his favorite white cat plushie and curled up on the floor, crying into it.
"It's money." Harry looked at Draco, then looked in the box. At the very bottom of it, folded flat, was a piece of parchment. He reached in and fished it out, reading it over. Understanding and mirth flooded over his face as he read it. His shoulders shook as he handed the letter, determined to be safe, over to Draco.
Ron grinned. "Yeah! The best! And you're welcome, Draco." He had had the best day he could remember in a long time, and he was looking forward to spending more days like this. He helped Remus put things away, then sat to eat his ice cream with Harry and Draco, chattering away with them about their adventure.
Draco grinned at his husband, his own silver eyes gleaming now. He could see the humor in it, once he'd gotten over his initial panic and hysteria.
Harry was a royal mess by the time dinner was done, but beaming brightly. He tolerated Remus helping him clean his face and hands, and the adult in the room didn't seem to be upset that he was messy at all. It didn't exactly help that Harry had played with half of the last piece of lasagna instead of eating it, but he was still going through a phase where he was exploring textures that he had missed when he was smaller.
Draco let his head touch Remus's hand in a little hug type thing when Remus squeezed his shoulder. He really wanted to give both Remus and Harry a hug, but he knew that that would annoy his mother. So he just looked at them happily as he waited for her to respond.
"So what is the goal for our adventure today Harry? Where are we going to go first?" Draco asked, grey eyes alight with excitement.
Draco watched Harry curiously, wondering what kind of pet would be hanging out outside a window. Maybe it was a bird?
Ginny didn't want to work through her trauma yet. She wanted to leave it behind. Harry hadn't agreed with that, though he did see that it was her choice. That had been another sticking point between them. Harry wanted to deal with his pain, and learn how to be himself. Ginny wanted him to bask in his fame and run away from the past with her. They just had been fundamentally wrong.
Remus smiled, happy to see Draco relaxing. "You're welcome, Draco." He gave the boys as much of the lasagna as they thought they could eat, not about to be worried about them finishing it or not. He was content to let dinner last as long as possible, to give the two boys as much time together as he could. He had never seen Harry look quite so happy, and wasn't eager to spoil it. He accepted Draco's compliment graciously.
On the same day that Draco Malfoy first saw the Weasley family and envied them for their love and affection, Harry Potter was introduced to them by Remus Lupin. They met Molly Weasley with Fred and George, Ronald, and little Ginny. Harry was fascinated, as he'd never had other kids want to be his friend before. He wasn't sure what to do with Ginny, and noticed that Ronald liked to be the center of attention, but he was quite taken with Fred and George. He had never met twins before, and they seemed to understand that he was out of his element.
Narcissa got the letter as she was getting ready to head for bed. She read through it and decided she would respond in the morning when she dropped off Draco. Lucius came home and agreed that the politics should be left open ended, and threatened to go to Lupin's house if it ever seemed that Draco was being force-fed Lupin's ideas. Narcissa got him to calm down a bit by saying she could get lesson plans to read over beforehand. Lucius deemed this to be enough but also told Narcissa it would be her job to monitor their lessons then. Narcissa agreed without really thinking about it, and then promptly decided a quick lookover would suffice. These lessons didn't need to take over her life too.
Draco returned his attention to his plate and tried his first ever lasagna. It was heavenly. Draco had never had something so good! He quickly complimented Remus and told him it was the best food he had ever had, his voice ringing with the sincerity only a child so young seems to have. Draco loved the food so much that he was soon dancing in his seat, happy and relaxed for a change. He felt...safe here.
Draco took the book from Remus excitedly, hoping that it would be enough to help him keep in touch with Harry, he really didn't want to lose his new friend.
Remus smiled a bit, figuring that either Harry had told Draco, or his parents had in order to make him not want to spend the night. He was glad that Draco seemed accepting of Harry's secret. "Lady Malfoy drops Draco off first thing in the morning, just after breakfast, around six am. If you'd like to avoid her, you can bring Ron any time after that, Molly. We'll talk about sleepovers, boys, alright?"
Draco looked between Remus and Harry, trying to make sure that they were indeed being serious, before speaking.
"I love you, Draco Malfoy-Potter."
Draco's eyes lit up as they played together, and he looked more alive than he had when he had first bumped into Harry. His face had a smile on it and he loved watching how his and Harry's magic intertwined while playing. Neither of them could really control their magic yet but it was fun to see. Draco looked at Harry curiously when he mentioned a pet. He looked at Harry and knew he would never betray his friend especially over something as simple as a pet.
Draco took it hesitantly, and read it over. His eyes widened as he did. A moment later, the short missive fell from his hand as he laughed. Harry laughed with him for several moments. They gathered up the bag, and set it in pride of place over their new mantle. The letter lay forgotten for the moment, as they returned to opening other gifts. It had landed face up on the table, next to the now completely empty box that the galleons had come in.
Draco finished speaking, smiling at Harry a little before burrowing back into Remus's arms.
Realizing he still hadn't finished answering Harry's question, and that he was still holding the boy's hand, Draco dropped his arm suddenly, scared he would seem odd to this boy who seemed to be friendly. Draco had always wanted a real friend and so he didn't want to mess this up. "I am okay, just a little in shock I guess. I didn't pay attention to where we were walking. Are you okay?" Draco asked earnestly, hoping that he hadn't hurt Harry.
Draco looked at Harry wondering what they should do first, but happy to have Harry nearby in case things went south. Draco decided to be as nice as possible, though he was a little scared about Ron finding out who he was. But Draco figured that if he was nice, maybe Ron wouldn't care. So Draco was kind and happy, and did his best to share Harry's attention with Ron, so that he wouldn't make Ron jealous.
"Maybe we could spend time together again soon though? And then the letters won't be so necessary?" Draco looked at Harry, eyes hopeful, and he turned to Remus with that same hope as the man entered Harry's room. Draco looked at Remus and whispered; "What if my parents won't help me write the letters? Will we have to stop being friends?" Draco felt tears in his eyes and so he squeezed them shut tight. His parents hated it when he cried.
"Well thank you Remus! I tried really hard to get it all, I have to always be clean at home. But sometimes I miss spots, so thanks for helping." Draco said with a genuine smile, no longer afraid of Remus, though still a tad tentative.
Draco waited for his mother to leave his room before he celebrated. He jumped up and did a happy dance around the room, hugging some of his favorite toys and dancing with them as he did so. He was excited that Harry had written to him so soon and he hoped that Harry could read his reply.
Lucius arrived home as Draco started on the letter “D”, which he was rather good at already, considering his name started with that letter. But the sound of the door slamming made Draco jump and he remembered his gifts from Harry. Worried his parents might take the gifts away from him if they decided to not let Draco see Harry, Draco jumped up from his desk and ran to find the bag. Once he had it, Draco hid it in a corner of his room where the stones were moveable. Then he returned to his desk, continuing to work on his letters while his parents talked. He couldn't hear exactly what they were saying but he could hear a low hum of talking from his room. Draco knew better than to interrupt their conversation so he stayed in his room, figuring they would tell him what they decided before bed time.
"Well I don't think you are a freak, I think you are the nicest person I've ever met!" Draco exclaimed and then blushed because of his words. His face was pale and the pink really stood out on his cheeks. Draco looked down at his feet as he continued talking.
Harry beamed brightly. "You're welcome, Draco. Thank you for being my friend." He wriggled, and if he had a tail it would have been wagging madly.
"Thank you for the hugs. I am sorry I got so upset..." Draco started speaking uncertainly. "But I just get so tired of being alone all the time, and I feel like it's mostly because my parents aren't nice people. Which makes me sad because I try to be a nice person...Anyways. I am glad that Ron is my friend now, and I hope that we will stay friends. And I really hope that Harry will stay my best friend, because he is the nicest person ever."
Ron danced a little as well, Draco's energy infectious. He had enjoyed passing the list around, and giggled along with Draco. He liked being part of this new group, even if his Mum had told him to be careful of the other boy at Harry's. He didn't see what was so wrong with Draco. He seemed nice, and friendly, and he thought maybe his Mum could be wrong sometimes.
"Yeah, jokes are supposed to be funny. Like... Like..." Harry  had to stop and think of a joke before he could ask it. While he was thinking, he led Draco around the store, showing him all sorts of things that made you float, or smelled bad and made a mess for a while, but were relatively easy to clean up. "I'm not good at jokes... Not yet. I'm still learning. Sorry. I'm having trouble thinking of one."
"Well then I am glad that you both have found each other. I hope that you never have to go back to your Aunt and Uncle's they seem very bad indeed. I am sorry you had to be with them at all. But Remus is very kind and he seems to truly care about you so that makes me happy. And yeah we could have nightly sleepovers at school though if we are in the same House! That would be so cool! But we will always be best friends, I can just tell."
Ron laughed breathlessly, not able to answer Draco until after they'd caught up with Harry, feeling brighter and happier than he had in awhile. "I think Mum still knows how to do formal things. We only stopped 'cause Mum and Dad got busy, I think.  I'll tell her I want formal ones. That way no one is left out." He panted softly, eyes bright. "I bet, if I'm really nice and polite, she'll say yes. I promise I'll be good." He was very determined.
Ron nodded as he thought about what Draco had said. "Don't worry, Mum will cave if I don't back down. And we're supposed to be allowed to have our friends. A-and... maybe we could have the party not at my house, so you can come without being in trouble. Because Harry can't always be at my house, either, and this year he especially can't. Mum says it's not safe." He looked a bit confused about that. "But for Harry, not for me." He took a deep breath. "And friends don't give up on friends."
"Well I am glad you are okay, I would feel awful if I had hurt you... Do you live near here? Is that how you know the place so well? I think I would like to stick with you if you don't mind. But what are pranks?" Draco asked uncertainly, he had never heard the word before.
He hoped that was good enough. Remus came up and read him a story, and then he laid down in his bed and snuggled Wolfy. He was briefly surprised when he fell asleep, but then he was asleep and dreaming of what he and Draco would do next time they were together.
Draco Malfoy sat in his room in a tiny flat off of Diagon Alley. He hadn't been able to stomach staying in the Manor for longer than he had to. It was too full of memories of the Dark Lord and the mistakes and stains on his family name. He wasn't really expecting any mail. Hardly anyone wrote to him. Occasionally Potter would write, checking in on him and his family.
He wanted to think about his reply, and have something new to tell Draco when he sent his next letter, so he didn't have one to send back with Remus's letter to Draco's mother. He was very excited about playing with his best friend, and hoped that he would be over soon, though he imagined it might not be this day.
Draco stared at his friend, trying to show his compassion and caring as he listened. He didn't want to make Harry feel bad at all, but he was curious about what werewolves were exactly. He hadn't really ever heard the term before.
After a little while Draco settled down a bit, the excitement of writing to Harry had passed. Now he realized that he was still in his room in this big empty house alone. He sat on his bed and snuggled his favorite white cat plushie to hold back his tears. His mother would leave soon and maybe then he could cry about being alone. But he didn't dare cry for real with her still in the Manor. If she heard him there was a good chance she would ban him from Harry's place until he got used to being alone. Draco didn't think he could handle that so he squished his kitten plushie hard and stroked its soft fur.
Harry was extremely excited that Draco could come over very often, and was bouncing around as he waited, annoying Remus with all the things that they would do. When the knock finally came, Remus answered quickly. "Good morning, Lady Malfoy, Draco." He invited them in. The apartment was relatively clean, if not the highest quality. It was clear that they cared about how they lived, even if they didn't live in the supposed luxury that Malfoy Manor offered.
Draco stared at Harry in amazement, his grey eyes wide with disbelief. He held onto the bag so that it didn't drop, but kept his hand outstretched, not sure Harry was serious. Draco was rarely given gifts outside of holidays and usually then he was given them as a way to keep up appearances, they never said things like, "I hope this makes you smile."
Harry grinned, keeping an eye on both of his friends. He was glad they were getting along, and hoped it stayed that way. He didn't like it when his friends fought. He had noticed the funny looks and whenever he could looked back until the adult looked away in shame for staring at kids. He took care of his friends. "Umm... We gotta go to the potions shop, so we can have stuff for potions next week. We're gonna make the chocolate potion I told you 'bout, and a new one." He grinned. "To Ingredient Mountain!" He ran for the apothecary.
Harry was happy to play with Draco, making up all the sorts of games an imaginative four year old typically would, except sometimes he could get his magic to work, and so the animals really did fly, or the toys really would move on their own, though none of them were actually enchanted. He did his best to let Draco decide what they were playing at least half the time, because Remus had said that was how friends shared, and he wanted to be Draco's best friend ever.
Harry grinned a bit, extremely happy that Draco had hugged him back. He was sure they were going to be best friends, and that he'd chosen very well. He could tell Draco had liked the hug, and was glad. He would definitely have to give as many of them as he could to the blonde. No one should ever not know how to react to a hug.
Narcissa spent most of her time socializing and playing the dutiful wife about town, while neglecting her motherly duties at home. Lucius, the man Draco knew only as Father, worked long hours all day, and when he came home he was generally grumpy. He yelled often and sometimes took out his frustrations on his family. Though Dobby took the brunt of his anger, Draco's Mother had also been targeted at times. Draco longed for the hugs he saw kids in the streets get from their parents.
Draco, on the other hand, still wasn't sure what he really wanted to do. Besides marrying Harry, that was. He had taken all of his NEWTS, and he still loved potions quite a bit, but he didn't really think he was cut out to be a teacher. He was wavering between getting a Potions Mastery and becoming a Mediwizard. The idea of healing some of the hurts he'd caused in the past was quite appealing. Harry was perfectly content to let him wait and decide. It wasn't as if they couldn't afford for him to take his time, after all.
Harry was surprised by how much he was talking. He'd never talked to anyone quite this much before, but he quite thought he  liked it. It was strange to him, though, that Draco didn't know what a prank or a joke was. He would have to teach the other boy, so they could try to prank Fred and George together. He just knew Draco would get along with Fred and George too. And wouldn't that be neat? All his friends, friends too!
"Um... so. Being a werewolf means that every month on the full moon, I turn into a wolf. But because I'm young, I turn into a baby wolf, not a grown one. Um... books say that werewolves are vicious and will attack anyone when transformed, but I don't think that's right. I think they're scared and confused, because transforming hurts a lot. Um. If I bite you as a wolf, you would become a werewolf on the next full moon. But I promise I won't ever bite you, because you're my best friend."
But Draco was finished with trying to meet his father's expectations. Lucius Malfoy had already ruined the name of his family quite well enough. Draco didn't need to go on following in his footsteps there. He'd ruin the name of Malfoy in his own way, on his own time. He was just grateful that his mother had supported him.
"I am going to do that then. I will make it so that no one will think I am like my parents. I will be the nicest person ever! I can't change the way I look but I can be kind, and hopefully that will be enough." Draco said as he stood up, unable to stay sitting in his excitement. As he finished speaking Draco punched his fist into the air, to show his determination. He would do it, no matter what his parents thought or did, he would be kind and good.
Narcissa nodded at Draco's response to her look, thanked Remus again, and took her leave. "I really must be going now, lots of errands and such to do. Draco you be good and mind Remus okay? Have a good day." And with that Narcissa left Remus's place to go and do, well, anything but be a mother.
Harry squeezed Draco back while they were hugging, and danced with him when they pulled apart. He was happy to hold Draco's hand, his eyes shining. "Yeah. Mister Florian is really, really nice. And he knows lots of things, so I always learn something while I'm there, too." He grinned brightly. "I love cherry ice cream! But you can pick your own favorite."
Eventually Draco felt comforted enough to get off his bed. He went to his toys and grabbed out some of his favorites, hoping to make them tell a story. He had a knight bus toy, a small levitating broomstick and a wizard action figure. He played with them for a while, making the wizard on the broom race the bus, and other fun games. Then he decided to work on his letters some more so he went back to his desk and started at the first blank page. Draco worked on his letters for a while and then picked up his favorite book. He should learn to read better if he wanted to be able to spell better, he thought.
Harry did his best not to be bouncy and to be polite. "Good morning." He chirped happily, his eyes bright with joy.
Draco giggled loudly at Harry's pose but joined him immediately. Harry was always fun to be around, and Draco enjoyed being silly with the other boy. Draco pumped his fist in the air and said, "Yes let's go!" As he practically shook with excitement. Draco loved these adventures and knew this one would be great fun as well. Draco smiled at Harry and Ron and then followed them out of Remus's and into Diagon Alley, towards Flourish and Blotts.
