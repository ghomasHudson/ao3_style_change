When he looks back at Harry, the young wizard is no longer alone. There are three other boys standing near him, all much bigger and tougher looking than him. Remus notices Sirius tense beside him, so he puts a hand on his shoulder, reminding him that their place is merely to observe for now.
Last year, Cedric spent an inordinate amount of time showing Draco his favorite spots on Hogwarts’ grounds. Right after his death, Draco had avoided those places determinately.
everyone is asleep, despite the late hour. Ron is sitting on the couch by the fireplace. His arms are crossed and a sour expression has taken over his normally friendly face.
Harry follows Ron’s fervent pointing to the end of the procession, where Viktor Krum and the man Harry assumes to be Durmstrang’s headmaster stride confidently down the center aisle. The headmaster appears to be a tall, imposing man with eyes that seemed to dig into your soul. The man reminded Harry of Professor Snape, minus the greasy hair and degrading sneer.
She smiles kindly at him. “You are cute, and I appreciate you thinking of me. But I already have a date.”
“—can help those who consume it endure hostile environments, such as extreme heat and cold, as well as adapt to unusual circumstances,” Draco hears Snape finish explaining the use of some potion. And suddenly . . . well, it’s sounding like it could be useful after all. Harry will soon be spending an hour underwater, after all. He’s going to need some kind of assistance doing that successfully without succumbing to the elements. And it’s certainly true that a potion would be longer-lasting and more effective than any spell Draco could think of for enduring the
From the other side of the room, Draco eyes the group. He’s at the Yule Ball dancing with Daphne again. Not that he really cares for her presence; she was just the most convenient choice of a partner. He certainly thinks she’ll enjoy the fun task he’s about to assign her at least. “Daphne, would you like to do something more exciting than standing here pretending to enjoy our seventh dance of the night?”
By the time he finally does get an answer, he’d been about ready to chuck his bloody journal in the fireplace out of frustration. (Sure, it had been less than an hour. But Harry’s never claimed to have the patience of an angel.)
Harry looks a bit disappointed, as though he’d hoped that Draco would address the matter Harry had brought up, but he goes along with Draco’s subject change. “It basically said that I’ll be going somewhere underwater where whoever was singing lives and I’ll have an hour to look for something they took.”
Harry tries to focus on simple tasks like reviewing his Hogwarts supplies list to see what he needs to buy before the summer ends. But he’s never able to reach the end of it before he inevitably reaches for his journal to see if Snape has replied.
The Beauxbatons headmaster, Olympe Maxime remarks, “He is not even seventeen years old. This boy is a child who does not want to compete. People have died in this bloody tournament. I do not think it is right to force him to put his life at risk.”
Draco feels his pulse leap into his throat when the Dark Lord finally makes his appearance. But he’s determined not to let his fear control his reaction.
Perhaps he’s simply discovered the concept of vengeance. Of course, this situation is such a serious one to walk into for such a short-sighted reason that Severus is tempted to drag the boy away by the ear right now. It could save a young life, even if it would doom his own. Voldemort would surely kill Draco if he discovered the boy to be plotting against him. Like Severus already is.
Draco sighs internally and imagines rolling his eyes all the way back into his head. He wants to have this conversation
Harry had been planning on asking Hermione to the Yule Ball, but that idea quickly dissipates as he, Hermione, and Ron walk into the library for an evening study session about a week before the Yule Ball.
“I’m a Slytherin,” Draco remarks somewhat haughtily, “thinking about things cleverly is what I do best.”
By now, the Horntail has noticed his presence and spreads its wings out, casting a shadow over Harry.
The blue-eyed girl smirks at him, clearly intrigued by his proposal already. “What did you have in mind?”
Draco clenches his fists. He’s at least going to do this one last thing, though he can’t explain even to himself why he’s so determined about the matter.
Within a brief moment, Severus simultaneously silences the music and crosses the room to stand directly in front of the aforementioned offenders.
Draco’s hidden under Harry’s invisibility cloak, guarding the Room of Requirement. They haven’t had any issues so far beyond the occasional Slytherin wandering dangerously close when the group’s meetings were either beginning or ending.
Harry grins and accepts it. Draco twirls him around, and Harry allows his mind to focus on nothing but this moment. The music, the laughter, the light in Draco’s eyes that he’s never seen before. . . .
The lights of the tunnel flicker. The air gets colder. And then Remus notices what Harry hasn’t yet perceived:
confronting him about it. I find it hard to believe that the sympathetic boy we’ve come to know could possible be the spoiled brat Potter.
Harry takes Parvati Patil with him to meet the other Champions, who are lining up with their chosen partners outside the ballroom. Ron goes inside the ballroom with Padma. Neither Harry nor Ron is thrilled about their choice of partner, as they hardly know the Patils. But Parvati, at least, seems proud to be accompanying a Champion to the ball. He has a sinking feeling, though, that he’s not the right person to live up to her expectations.
Though he’s inwardly much more thrilled that his guess has turned out to be accurate, Draco keeps his face controlled. He merely raises an eyebrow and smirks. “Are you surprised?” he asks.
He is then abruptly dragged back to reality when a sharp paper airplane jabs him in the head. Harry starts to unfold the paper, but then Snape swoops in and snatches it from his hands. “Passing notes, Potter? Let’s share this with the whole class then, shall we?” He pauses dramatically and clears his throat before reading the note aloud. “Once upon a time, there lived a child named Potter. His parents despised him so much that they begged for death and happily took advantage of the opportunity when it arrived. There is also a poorly-drawn picture of two smiling dead people.” The note bursts into flames in Snape’s hand as Snape looks around the room with a sneer. “Desperate for attention, are we, Potter?”
Harry gives her a smile that he hopes is reassuring. “I think he forgot something in the Common Room.”
The adults quiet for a moment. They all nod resignedly and mumble their consent to allowing Harry to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. If Fleur hadn’t chosen that moment to squeeze Harry’s hand gently, he thinks he might’ve either passed out or fled from the room.
he didn’t use the spell. Dracoe raised his eyebrows in disbelief as Potter apparently gave up fighting the dragon and just ran to the mother’s nest while she was merely momentarily distracted by the Patronus Potter had cast.
It doesn’t surprise him when Harry nods at Lupin, sending the man sulking away to keep an eye on them from a further distance. Sometimes asking nicely really is the best way to get what you want, he’s found.
This time when he goes to sleep, he imagines entering the dungeon of his fortress, where Voldemort awaits, locked in a cell he can’t escape from. He’s in Harry’s territory, under his control. There’s nothing to fear from tonight’s dream.
And then Viktor walks out from behind the bookshelf where he’d probably been waiting and watching Hermione’s reaction.“Miss Granger, will you give me the honor of accompanying me to the Yule Ball?” he asks while smiling at her.
Hermione takes advantage of Ron’s pause to smack his head and reprimand him by saying, “Ron, that’s disgusting. I know your mother didn’t raise a pig.” She picks up her journal and shows Harry the rules on the back. “Basically, when you open this book, you can ask a question. Someone in this room will answer it. The book won’t let them write anything besides the truth, so you can trust everything they say to be true, at least from their perspective,” Hermione pauses to take a breath and then quickly continues, “They will then ask you a question that you must answer. You will also be compelled to tell the truth. This goes back and forth until one of you can guess the other’s identity. Whoever guesses correctly moves on in the competition and is paired with another person, until there is either one winner or the Triwizard Tournament ends,” Harry picks up his journal curiously and pulls out his quill, but before he can even open the book, Hermione slams her hand over it hastily. “I almost forget to mention it, but you can only ask a particular question one time, even if you talk to multiple people. So don’t waste all the good questions right away. Also, you can’t just ask for their name. The book won’t tolerate any questions it seems to be too much of an obvious cheat.”
He finds himself pulling out the piece of parchment on which he’d written the Draco Malfoy Pros and Cons List. In the pros section, he adds “He can make me unbelievably happy with just a few words.”
Glaring at Harry, the boy agrees. It isn’t until they’ve all walked out of sight that Remus sees Harry let out a deep breath.
Glancing down at his journal, Harry decides to open it and see if anything new awaits him. And indeed, his partner had managed to reply to his last message.
The day after the Yule Ball, Harry finds himself beginning to panic about the second task. He still hasn’t figured out what it is, and if Draco’s idea about trying to open the egg underwater doesn’t work, then Harry doesn’t know
He feels his chest tighten, and he doesn’t know what to say. It’s true that he’s taunted and tormented Harry and his friends for years. But recently . . . well, he’s rather enjoyed pretending like that hasn’t been the case.
The boy pulls his wand out, clearly ready to conjure a Patronus. And while Remus knows that the boy is perfectly capable of doing it, he also knows that he’d get in trouble for using underage magic, possibly even if it was self-defense.
“Draco!”. Pansy leaps up to drag the blonde down to sit next to her and Harry trying to subtly lean across the table to catch a glimpse of Malfoy.
“I didn’t drink anything”, he whispers across the table at Hermione, who groans and slumps onto the table, face-down.
Draco turns his head around and kisses Harry deeply as Harry pushes inside his tight heat, groaning into the blonde’s mouth at the feeling. He tears his mouth away, attaching it to Draco’s shoulder as he fights the urge to move. Draco, seemingly sensing his thoughts reaches a hand back to fist in Harry’s hair and whisper brokenly into his ear.
Thanks for reading Absent of Cause! Sorry for the late updates, I will try to update one-shots from now on, so you don't have to wait as long! Any requests?
He doesn’t miss the evil grin that splits her face in half, he mind clearly not addled enough to hinder her sharp wit. He slams his hand onto the table.
Taking a larger gulp of his drink, he searches the room for a figure that he hasn't seen in days, finally spotting Malfoy walking next to Pansy towards the centre of the room, swaying slightly on his feet and staring down at the floor as he carefully puts one foot in front of the other, blonde hair ruffled and falling in front of his eyes. Harry is not nearly sober enough to think properly about the weird feeling that is left in his stomach when he lets his eyes follow Malfoy across the room to the dance floor, at the drunkest Harry has ever seen him, swaying lightly to the song as he drinks deeply from a bottle of mead at the same time.
Harry reads it on his way out of the common room, looking through the gaps between the heads of many other students to read the message. Pansy certainly knows how to sell a party. Running a hand through his hair, he tucks his Transfiguration textbook underneath his arm and joins Ron and Hermione outside of the common room, all three heading up to the classroom.
No, there haven’t been parties for several years at Hogwarts. He expects that last night was the first proper one, now with Snape gone and the castle mostly repaired from the battle – the scars erased from the stony landscape that Harry called home for so many years.
“Potter!”, Pansy shouts gleefully, clapping her hands together. "Now, unless Hermione has a good one, does anyone have any recommendations?" Hermione shakes her head and gestures around the circle.
The half-giant eyes him guiltily, grinning. 'Mead', he mouths, tipping the flask at Harry in a salute.
As he pulls it away from his mouth he glances quickly over the rim of the bottle to take a breath, his eyes meet Harry’s, his gaze hooded and eyes hazy. Smirking slightly, he brings the bottle back to his lips and starts to move his hips from side to side, bringing one hand to his hair to run it through the silken locks, the other letting the bottle fall to the side of his body, swinging gently.
The eighth years share a common room and dorms, the sleeping areas instead now separated by gender only. The boys and girls both have two dorms, each connected by a bathroom. Harry has been roomed with some boys that he barely knows, as well as Blaise, Ron, Dean, Theo and Malfoy. Malfoy’s face when McGonagall had read out the new sleeping arrangements had been priceless. His already pointed face had become increasingly more pinched, resembling a lemon. His whispered words to the headmistress had not gone unnoticed by Harry, who had laughed. '
Harry’s head spins as he smells a familiar smell of pine and aftershave, Malfoy’s breath hot on the back of his neck.
Harry slowly draws out and thrusts back into Draco, who lets out a loud moan, encouraging Harry to increase his pace. Before long, he’s thrusting into Draco without abandon, both letting out loud groans that thankfully cannot be heard by passing people due to the quick Muffliato Harry had cast before walking into here. He’d anticipated some event of the sort to occur.
The song morphs into a Chase Atlantic number, not helping Harry’s state of arousal in the slightest, as the boy behind him leans his head into the crook of Harry’s neck.
„I wouldn‘t expect anything else from you. Bloody Gryffindors,“ Draco sighed disgruntedly. „I‘m going to make breakfast, I'm starving. You stay here and think about the disaster you are so undauntedly planning,“ he extracted himself from the tangle of Harry‘s limbs. He crossed the room to the wardrobe and pulled on a pair of grey silk pajama bottoms, knowing Harry was observing his every move. His prick was still hard and tented the cloth invitingly. He stretched luxuriously and ran both his hands through his hair to fix his bed head. He knew the play of his back muscles and biceps would drive Harry crazy. Draco started for the kitchen, a self-satisfied smirk tugging at the corners of his lips. He stopped in the doorway and turned around to peek at Harry.
"I will not have him end up like Neville's parents," Harry choked back the angry tears that were welling in his eyes.
Harry smiled crookedly at Draco, trying to convey that everything was going to be alright. He wasn‘t sure he succeeded as Draco only stared at him blankly.
Hearing the mocking tone come out of Harry's mouth at such a moment oddly increased Draco's arousal even more. He obediently pulled his legs to his chest and waited for Harry to slick his fingers and push them up Draco's hole. However, Harry seemed to have a different idea. He placed the bottle of lube onto the sheets and lowered his mouth to Draco's arse instead. Without preamble, he sucked at Draco's puckered hole. Draco's whole body nearly came off the bed at the sensation. Harry's tongue circled his entrance, first maddeningly slow, then fast and hard. Draco thought he could come just from the feel of Harry's tongue there. Harry thrust his tongue inside Draco's arse.
Draco must have been able to read Harry's expression, at least partially, because all of a sudden, there was a comforting hand resting on his bicep. Harry leaned into the touch inadvertently, soaking up the warmth radiating from Draco, the spicy scent of his cologne wafting into his nostrils.
"I wish you would," Potter mumbled under his breath so quietly, Draco thought he must have imagined it. Out loud Potter said, "sorry, force of habit."
„Draco blocked me from his Floo?“ Harry whispered uncomprehendingly. He tumbled backward and stumbled over a leg of the glass coffee table situated in front of the sofa. It overturned and shattered on the floor. Harry barely noticed. He knew that just as in Grimmauld Place, Draco‘s Anti-Apparition wards were directly linked with the Floo. If Harry was locked out of Draco‘s Floo, he wouldn‘t be able to Apparate into Draco‘s flat either.
„Draco, where are you,“ Harry called out. He frantically ran through the hallway into Draco‘s bedroom but it was empty and untouched. Harry turned around on his heel and called again. „Where are you? I love you, I‘m so sorry, just please be alright.“
„It‘s Draco Malfoy. And I‘ve been forgetful,“ Draco hissed when Harry slowly lowered him onto the pre-prepared emergency bed, as indicated by the medi-witch.
"I didn't…" Harry trailed off, unsure how to continue. "Look, we're partners, whether you like it or not. I'm here if you need someone to talk to. I'm sure we can manage to hold a civil conversation for once."
Draco's wand lands in Harry's hand and he presses it into Draco's palm. Harry knows Draco understands now. He trusts him. That's when the streak of green light hits him in the back and Harry crumbles to the floor, unseeing, lifeless.
They move together gently as if swaying in the wind for what feels like an eternity until Draco comes on his stomach on Harry's prick alone and Harry spills himself inside Draco.
"Do I get my own rapier?" Potter positively jumped up and down, reminding Draco of a ball of lightning.
„Yes, Draco is currently standing in my library,“ Harry nodded helpfully, hiding his smile. „And later on he will be lying in my bed while I fuck him senseless,“ he muttered to himself quietly.
Draco and Potter fell in formation. They always argued in the office but once in the field, they were formidable. They worked together as one, always knowing where the other was. There didn't have to communicate with words any longer, they were able to read each other's movements and expressions as if they were using Legilimency.
Draco took a sip of his warm beer. He hated beer. He would never understand why people willingly drank it. However, tonight he didn't have any other choice as he didn't want to risk ordering wine in such a piss-poor establishment such as the one he was currently at. Even more, he hated Pansy's today's choice of a Muggle karaoke bar for their Friday pub crawl night. What he hated the most, were the sleazy men staring in his direction, whom he tried to ignore profoundly. Their gang met up every two weeks, ever since they finished their eighth year at Hogwarts, where he, Pansy, Blaise, and Theo struck a surprising friendship with the Gryffindors. It had all started when the eighth-year students were assigned a separate Common Room and dorms. Draco had been forced to share a room with Weasley of all people. Yet somehow, after numerous hexing and shouting matches, they became friends. A year later, their whole Slytherin-Gryffindor group was inseparable.
"The dining room is this way then," Narcissa led them over to a newly reconstructed part of the Manor. Harry knew all the rooms were stripped bare after Narcissa and Draco had returned to the Manor after the Trials. He knew they wanted to erase all the bad memories connected with their home due to the unwanted stay of Voldemort in it and all the horrors that happened under its roof.
"Do I? It must be true then," Draco tried to quirk an eyebrow, even though his face was still contorted in a mask of pleasure.
Suddenly, he was wrapped in a warm embrace. He inhaled deeply and the heady smell of Draco's perfume and his skin underneath wafted into Harry's nostrils.
"But why Malfoy? Alright, he might be the best but why couldn't you have made an appointment at the second-best agency?" Harry threw his arms into the air. "Why couldn't you have made an appointment with anyone else?"
They explored the remainder of the first floor as quickly yet efficiently as possible. The master bedroom was clear with its eighteen degrees, as well as the guest bedroom with seventeen. The only room that was left to check was the bedroom where Mrs. Emsworth's mother used to sleep.
"Really, Potter?" Malfoy's voice turned icy all of a sudden. His eyes narrowed and his whole body stiffened.
„I understand if you‘re not ready! I get it, I do. I mean… I get that you‘re scared,“ Harry stuttered in one breath.
As soon as the bell rang, Malfoy stepped in front of the desk where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting.
Draco rolled again, aiming his wand at the second wizard. The robber was faster than Draco had counted on. He swung around the moment he heard Draco's shout and fired a well-aimed Diffindo at Draco's stomach. The roll Draco had executed should have moved him out of harm's way but he felt the spell hit him in the shoulder. Hot blood spilled out of the wound over his chest. Draco fell on one knee which saved his life as another Severing Charm narrowly missed his head.
"I… I don't think…," Harry trails off. He feels sick when he imagines doing that to Draco after what he had been forced to go through.
"Anyway," Draco returned back to their training, ignoring Potter's grinning face. "Another Type Two would be a Dark Spectre. You already had the pleasure to meet one as well. They manifest as a moving patch of darkness. They are able to shrink to the size of a pulsing heart or expand at speed to engulf a whole room. Dark Specters are one of my least favourite types, to be honest. They are really difficult to fight against, as you saw."
Potter barked out a surprised laugh. "I can assure you, us working together will be a delight," his eyes sparkled with merriment and he bit his lip as if trying to stop himself from saying more.
Harry must have blacked out because when he regained his consciousness, Draco was lying on top of him, gasping for air, his come leaking out of Harry's arse. Harry groaned and Draco rolled off of him. Harry winced and hissed as Draco's softening cock slipped out of his hole. Harry felt limp, boneless, almost as if his body was not his own. He rolled to his side and whimpered. His arsehole was sore and even the tiniest movement hurt.
„Clean up later?“ Harry broke the kiss and tipped up his head to look at Draco. He smiled deviously, biting his lip.
"That is amazing, Hermione! You really are the smartest person I know," Harry beamed at her proudly. "I can't wait to tell Draco."
"Yes," Pansy answered. He'd sent a Patronus to her two hours ago, instructing her to pack their kits and re-stock Draco's ghost-hunting bag. They were to head out as soon as Draco found out the location of the sanatorium and Apparate from there. Draco didn't like dragging Pansy onto missions with him but with Theo visiting his parents, he didn't have a choice. They'd established rules of ghost-hunting a year ago. Draco, Blaise, Theo, and Pansy.
Draco lay silently without moving. He would not cry over Harry Potter. That would be pathetic. Draco was many things but pathetic was not one of them. Mostly. A tear escaped a corner of his eye and he wiped it away angrily.
"I admit it might sound a bit crazy. OK, it definitely sounds crazy but that's what happened, you have to believe me," Harry insisted.
"OK, Potty, time for you to show me what you've learned," Draco patted Harry's shoulder and transformed his smile into a mock proud expression. "I feel like a father sending his son off to Hogwarts for the first time. I've taught you everything I know, I formed you, seen you take your first baby steps in the world of ghost-hunting, and showed you how to protect yourself."
„You did?“ Harry exclaimed. „Well I guess I had a crush on you too, I just didn‘t know it,“ he grumbled to himself.
"Maybe, Harry, because Malfoy's agency is not only the best in Britain. It's the only one. There's no one else who can help us," Hermione seemed clearly frustrated. "Please tell me you didn't end up fighting. Please tell me, you didn't shut the only door leading to the solution I could come up with."
"It's not my fault the floor here is practically a battlefield. You try walking across it without making a noise, moron," Harry shot back.
Harry pushed the door open and winced when the hinges creaked. The sound echoed in the empty, suffocating stillness of the house. He peeked inside, his eyes were immediately drawn to the two dust-free human-sized shapes on the floor, where Montague and McLaggen had lain. Harry's mind supplied two bodies, sprawled on the floor, unmoving, their faces pale, lips blue and cold. He blinked to clear the image from his mind. He started systematically searching the room, presuming the Source of the ghost that had killed Alpha must be hidden somewhere in the same room. He looked into all the drawers in a cupboard to his left, searched under the broken bunk bed, he even tore the mattresses open and searched the inside of the fabric bags they had been made of. He tried tearing out the wooden planks off the floor. Malfoy had said that the Sources were usually bones or items of emotional value, however, he couldn't find anything of importance inside the room. He even, rather desperately in his opinion, tried to
„Remember in our eighth year when you used to snog Hermione all over Hogwarts? That was disgusting,“ Harry deadpanned.
"The fuck you have to," Harry scowled. "Draco has not been involved in any nefarious dealings or whatever you've just suggested."
„Well, I wanted to tell you something but this might not be the best time. And well, I‘m sorry,“ Ginny hugged him tightly.
Ron gaped at him, his eyebrows nearly touching his hairline. Draco looked at him expectantly. Not receiving an answer, he huffed and turned to Harry who was beaming at him.
They entered Harry's bedroom and Harry wandlessly lit a dozen candles that were stationed around the room. There was a large four-poster bed that dominated the room and a long mirror that sat opposite the bed, next to a large wardrobe. The walls were painted white except the one behind the bed, which was decorated with wallpaper of a beautiful design. It looked like a teal-and-gold gemstone. The teal sheets on the bed matched the wallpaper perfectly.
Draco started laughing but stopped almost immediately when he noticed Harry's expression. He was staring at Ron's hands, where they were splayed over Draco's chest. A muscle jumped in his tightly set jaw and his nostrils flared. Draco had no idea what was going on. He hadn't seen Harry this angry at his best mate since the fourth year. At that time, he'd found it delightful. Seeing Harry's expression now made his heart squeeze painfully. Had Harry and Ron been fighting? They didn't seem to be angry at each other earlier, why now then?
"Yes. Yes, I have. The house has been in my family for several generations. It's an old cottage, under Ben Nevis. Me and my wife, Jackie, inherited it after my father died," Mr. Gladstone sighed wistfully, his eyes unfocused. "It's such a beautiful place, I wouldn't trade it for anything. However, recently we've started experiencing… some issues."
“I suppose that does seem unlikely,” Snape says slowly, “but we must proceed with caution. That’s only one piece of circumstantial evidence, far from concrete. We must be much more confident about this idea of yours before I’d even
you,” Draco began, as though he found the words difficult to get out, “for your success today. You got the highest score after using the spell I gave you.”
Why he’d kissed Draco, only Merlin knows. The blonde had just looked so . . .  angelic, with his sharp features so dimly lit. Everything about him is intoxicating when Harry gets this close. That’s partially why he stopped letting himself get so close to him in the first place.
And then he does it. “It” being the unholy act of running his hands through said unruly hair. Harry doesn’t stop him, though his eyebrows furrow together in a way that makes Draco want to use his lips to smooth out the wrinkle that’s formed between them.
“Kind of . . . exactly that!” Ron answers. “I’ll see you later then, Harry!” he pats Harry’s shoulder and runs off.
And with that, he snatches Lucius’ arm, pulls his sleeve back to reveal his Dark Mark, and presses a finger firmly against it. Within moments, black whorls appear all over the room, morphing into Death Eaters. Draco and Voldemort remain in the center of it all. His father had taken advantage of the chaos to abandon Draco and join the mask of currently anonymous Death Eaters.
“This should work,” he tells Harry. But then he thinks of another problem. “Though, I'm not sure where we’ll get it.”
After another hour of research in the library (which Harry spent looking so morose that Draco wondered how the boy had passed all of his classes so far if he really hates spending time in the library this much), Draco had figured out all of the ingredients they’d need, minus one. He just couldn’t figure out what would allow the cold-resistant aspect of the potion to also serve as something that would allow Harry to breathe underwater and swim more efficiently.
Draco releases Harry. “I just wanted you to know that I don’t owe you anything now. You were kind to me after the
Instead of waiting around and doing nothing until his partner responds, Harry decides to go the library. Now that he has an idea of what the second task will be, he can finally start researching and preparing for it.
Shopping for school supplies used to be one of Draco’s favorite activities. And if he’s being completely honest with himself, he has to admit that it still appeals to his vanity to buy all of the newest and most stylish robes, potions equipment, broomsticks, and whatever other lavish things catch his eye.
Hermione nods emphatically in agreement with Ron and hesitates for a moment, before embracing Harry and almost knocking him off his feet with the force of it.
Harry finds himself in the Champions’ Tent once more, this time with a golden egg clutched close to his chest. He’s not in nearly as bad shape as the others, and for that, he’s grateful.
“Okay.” Draco nods and leaves Snape to his thoughts, which turn over and over again focused only on the question of whether Dumbledore could possibly have allowed his golden boy to endure years of abuse from his muggle relatives.
But now Draco is crying, and Harry’s heart hurts. It had only been earlier this year, in the spring, when Cedric died. Before that, the Hufflepuff had spent months falling in love with Draco. It had been plain to see from how happy both of them were together.
Draco shivers a bit at hearing Harry say his first name. It’s not a surprise to him anymore, but it’s . . . oddly
the potions professor, that he had overlooked the fact that Snape and Harry were supposed to be on opposite sides. For as much as Draco had forgotten, however, it seemed that Snape had not.
Thoughts of platinum blond hair and piercing grey eyes are the solace he turns to when he’s in the midst of trying to fall asleep while his body aches from the bruises recently inflicted on it. He feasts on those thoughts when he’s forced to go several days without any real sustenance. Every kind word Draco’s ever said to him, he drinks like honey when water is denied to him.
When he answered the Dark Lord’s call, Severus didn’t anticipate that Draco Malfoy would be involved in any way. As much as everyone at Hogwarts seemed to suspect that all Slytherin students were mini Death Eaters, most of the real Death Eaters wisely kept their children away from Voldemort. Severus certainly would’ve thought that Lucius of all people would wish to keep his only child out of sight. And Draco had never seemed to truly wish to be involved in any of this wickedness.
would work. Yes, I have great respect for my competitors,” and so forth), he notices Ron and Hermione peeking into the tent from just outside. And he thinks he sees platinum blond hair somewhere further away.
Harry lies in his bed that evening after the feast. His journal is sitting in his lap, still unopened. He takes a deep breath and tentatively opens it.
Hermione plasters a smile on her face as she turns to face him. Inwardly, she vows to investigate Malfoy and figure out what’s going on. Harry might not trust her, but he certainly shouldn’t be trusting that
A few moments later, the lights brighten, the air gets warmer, and Sirius is already sprinting over to Harry. Remus feels a wave of protectiveness surge over him as he watches the two embrace. He cares deeply for both of them, and after what he has seen today . . . he just can’t bring himself to turn Sirius’ earlier request down now.
By the time he gets in bed that night, the books Kreacher found for him have Harry convinced that he and Voldemort must be somehow connected in a game of occlumency and legilimency. The only problem is that Harry’s not quite sure what the rules of the game have been so far. Why would Voldemort knowingly invite Harry into his mind to see his Death Eater meetings and give away the true loyalties of Draco and Snape?
But he bitterly remembers that Ron and Hermione haven’t answered any of his letters all summer, and there’s no one waiting for them at Grimmauld Place except Kreacher, who’s hardly an enthusiastic welcomer.
She looks down and bites her lip. “He’s being stubborn, Harry. He misses you, but he doesn’t want to admit he’s wrong. And I miss you, too.”
Harry forces himself to pay attention as Dumbledore picks names from the Goblet. Fleur from Beauxbatons. Ron claps profoundly for her, and Harry tries to join him, though he does so half-heartedly. Viktor from Durmstrang. Both Ron and Hermione cheer. Harry barely maintains a smile. Cedric the Hufflepuff from Hogwarts. Harry hardly hears the name. But then… the Goblet flashes blue again and sends out another name. Harry’s daze is shattered when Dumbledore calls out, “Harry Potter!”
By the time class ends twenty minutes later, Harry looks for Malfoy frantically, but the blonde is nowhere to be seen.
His notebook mimics what Hermione’s had done minutes earlier: it flashes blue and the pages flip frantically until they settle on a blank one.
Suddenly, without warning, Voldemort reaches for Draco’s left arm and presses his wand to the sensitive skin there. Whatever spell he uses to create the Dark Marks is incredibly painful. Draco feels like his whole arm is
Perhaps that’s not it at all. The books made it sound like the case between the two of them is highly irregular, as it always describes people being near each other physically when legilimency and occlumency are used. Maybe their connection is more accidental and Voldemort has as little control over it as Harry? (Well, Voldemort probably has more control than
Harry chuckles at how basic smalltalk has suddenly become so useful, and then he pauses for a moment.
Ron suddenly lets loose a dark laugh that startles Harry. It fills him with a sense of dread. The Ron he knows would never react to Harry’s heartfelt words that way. But this Ron just did. Harry suddenly feels scared—no, more like
Hermione’s eyes light up thoughtfully as she contemplates the idea. “I can test that theory.” She quickly scribbles a response and question in her journal and then intently gazes at Luna, who is eating her own breakfast not far away at the Ravenclaw table. Luna glances down at her book and writes something. Exactly when she stops writing, Hermione glances down at her own book, where Harry sees that a response has appeared. “It’s definitely her!” Harry watches her carefully write
"Don't forget, we need to see them cast at least one spell against Mr. Malfoy. We needed it as proof that the person we hopefully catch today is the one who tortured him. You know it has to be done that way as you refused to report this case officially," Robards eyed him disapprovingly. "We need to have a reason for the bust if the evidence is to stand before the Wizengamot."
A sudden flare of unfounded jealousy ran through Harry's body as he remembered Ms. Huntley's flirting with Draco a week ago. Harry fought down the urge to slam Draco against the door of his office and take him right there. He wanted to bruise Draco's lips with his own, mark his pale throat with purple hickeys, fuck him possessively for everyone to see. Instead, he gripped Draco's hand tighter and made sure Ms. Huntley noticed their intertwined hands.
"I'm fine with anything that doesn't involve roaming through haunted mansions, trying to save Potter's arse," Pansy sniffed.
„Shut up, Potter,“ Draco growled and kissed Harry hard on the mouth. Harry‘s mouth was unmoving under Draco‘s lips. He nipped and softly bit Harry‘s lower lip, then licked it in apology with his tongue. Draco could feel Harry relax almost imperceptibly under his ministrations. Suddenly Harry tensed again and pushed Draco away.
„In a way, it‘s always been me and Malfoy, hasn‘t it? We‘ve been circling each other for years,“ Harry replied pensively. „I know he was a right git and a bully at school but he‘s different now. He's such an amazing, caring person, once you get to really know him. You‘ll see if you just give him a chance.“
Harry released his breath with a shudder. "Draco, I'm already using all of my remaining self-control not to pounce at you right here."
Harry closed the bathroom door shut behind him and leaned heavily against it. He breathed out. He knew Draco was supposed to rest so it wasn't fair that he tried to coerce Harry into having sex with him. Especially when all Harry wanted was to nuzzle, kiss, and lick every bit of Draco's skin he could possibly reach. His prick was hard and straining against his jeans. Harry didn't know how he was going to survive the rest of the weekend without pouncing on Draco now that he got him back. Harry thought he'd lost him forever and therefore was ecstatic (and hard) ever since Draco let him cuddle him in the hospital bed.
Harry winced. He had a blast during his stay in Chicago for the internship in the branch of MACUSA Robards had arranged for him but he missed Britain and he missed his Auror partner, Draco Malfoy, even more. Not only because after the nine months since they'd been partnered they were on the verge of becoming friends, but also because worked damn well as a team. Another reason, infinitely small one, was that Harry had sort of a crush on Malfoy. Teensy-weensy crush… of epic proportions. It wasn't Harry's fault, not really. It was not his fault Malfoy was gorgeous, all pale and blond and piercing grey eyes. And it was definitely not Harry's fault he sometimes sneaked a peek at Malfoy's work-of-art arse in the showers after a grueling case.
„Of course it bothered me! No one ignores a Malfoy!“ Draco shouted. „And I thought you didn‘t want me anymore,“ he pouted.
"I wish you could, though," Malfoy whispers, and the pain in his voice is back. He lifts his head slightly and Harry sees rivulets of tears falling out of Malfoy's eyes, streaking down his cheeks, running down his neck, drying in long lines on his grubby skin.
Harry eyed him wearily, then sighed and trained his eyes firmly on a spot above Draco's shoulder. "My first sex with a man. He was a Muggle and it was just a one-off. Anyway, he got overly enthusiastic while I was giving him a blow job and he thrust his hips too deep all of a sudden and…"
An oppressive silence enveloped the table. Harry felt sick again. He got up from the chair, nearly toppling it over. "Excuse me for a minute," he swallowed hard and ran out of the room.
Draco chose to ignore him. A pint and a glass of Firewhiskey landed in front of him. Finnigan winked at him and plopped down next to she-Weasley.
That was all it took. Draco's knees buckled under the assault to his senses as he was hit by his orgasm. It was so intense his knees nearly gave out as he quivered, holding for dear life onto Harry's shoulders.
"But that means…" Harry trailed off. Another lightning flashed in the sky, illuminating his face for a second. He looked lost. "The ghost will be drawn to our magic. Is there even enough time to cast it before the ghost is upon us?"
"Oh, that is understandable. I heard Mr. Potter was ill too and wasn't coming back to work until further notice. Hopefully, it's nothing serious, but then I'm sure you would be much more distressed if it was. You seemed so happy together the other day. Well, get better soon, Mr. Malfoy, I will not delay you any longer," she chatted happily as she wished him goodbye.
He whirls around so quickly that he feels his grip on his school letter loosen enough for the paper to fly away from him and straight into the fire. Leaping to rescue it with a yelp, Harry grits out, “Please get me any books you can find on occlumency.”
At one point, he runs into Hermione in the hall outside Snape’s potions classroom. He guesses she was waiting for him. “Harry, I just wanted to say that Ron—”
Draco looks down at the book laid in front of him. “Gillyweed” is described as a plant that provides humans with gills and webbed feet and hands so that they can swim underwater easily. It seems like it can also be added to their cold-resistance potion to allow Harry to stay underwater during the second task without being hindered by the cold water.
The young couple dances with the precision that comes from years of practice. Severus notes that while their dance is beautiful, it seems cold, as if there is a certain distance that must be kept between the partners. He supposed that such careful distances are habitual amongst Slytherins.
The library is empty, which suits Harry just fine. He steps inside tepidly and sits down by a huge window, The views of Hogwarts’ breathtaking grounds help to take his mind off of recent events. As he looks outside, he thinks about all the times he’s done homework while resting against huge tree trunks. He looks at the soft grass that has tickled him gently while he laid on it and stared up at the sky. He thinks about the gorgeous castle itself has been his magical shelter these past few years. He thinks about how the beauty of Hogwarts has survived no matter what horrific events have taken place inside its walls.
as Draco likes to think of her. He’d whisper it to Harry sometimes, and the other boy would laugh breathily), even joining her Inquisitorial Squad. For all appearances, Draco Malfoy had no reason to protect Harry Potter and his gang of friends. (In reality, Draco and Harry carefully arranged when and how Draco would “catch” one of them performing the occasional misdemeanor so that no one would suspect him.)
Harry breathes out a sigh of relief as he feels his heart lighten slightly. He takes a bite of the apple he’d brought from the Great Hall and looks at the journal he’d forgotten he had had in his hands since he’d left the Gryffindor Common Room this morning.
For a while, they don’t speak. They just sit on the little hill where Draco used to sit with Cedric. The vibrant hues of orange clash, fade into, and reflect over the lake. Draco watches them battle for so long that he’s almost forgotten he’s not alone this evening.
Hermione hesitated and then slid the book over to him. Her look of triumph has faded. She doesn’t meet his eyes, and just whispers “Gillyweed.” Then she abruptly turns back to her boyfriend and walks off with him.
Harry tries to reassure himself. The bad news is much more obvious. Little droplets of blood seep from his eye, which is so swollen and red that Harry fears it might burst if he so much as touches it.
The first major incident of the summer occurred when Petunia noticed that Harry hadn’t started doing the dusting since he got back. It wasn’t even that he’d purposefully chosen not to do it. He’d simply forgotten that the Dursleys expected it of him. After all, no one does dusting by hand at Hogwarts.
Dumbledore seems content to do nothing about this dreadful situation, which is how Harry finds himself in an empty classroom whispering with Draco Malfoy and Luna Lovegood.
Will Harry ever talk to Snape in the journal again? Will Snape ever find out that he's been talking to Harry this whole time? What will develop between Harry and Draco? Find out next time in Chapter Six: Dance with Me.
Eventually, Harry answers her. “Erm, yeah, actually. We’re trying to find an ingredient that would allow cold-resistance and water-resistance ingredients to combine and work together. Did I explain that right? That is what we’re trying to do, isn’t it?” He looks to Draco for confirmation, which he gives with an incline of his head.
“I just don’t understand,” Harry gasps out in between waves of nausea. Throughout the course of the past year, his once unwavering faith in Dumbledore has grown more and more difficult to maintain, but he’d still never expected this kind of betrayal, this outright disregard for his safety. Harry’s always known that Dumbledore prioritizes the “greater good” over any individual, but he still never expected to be so clearly treated as no less expendable than a pawn in a game of chess.
Or at least, he pretends to. In reality, he apparates to a nearby room in the house, where he casts eavesdropping and disillusionment charms. Luckily, Voldemort doesn’t stick around much longer either, so in only a few minutes, he catches Draco’s uninjured arm and apparates with him to Severus’ own home, which he always keeps carefully warded against eavesdropping.
He doesn’t get very far. Mad-Eye Moody snatches the back of his collar before he could even reach the end of the Gryffindor table. Moody drags Harry to stand in front of Dumbledore and the Goblet of Fire. The Headmaster shows Harry the slightly burnt piece of parchment in his hand. It reads “Harry Potter.” Harry’s face pales further.
Whenever Harry’s this close and the conversation this heated, Draco’s shields against whatever magnetism draws him to Harry are the least effective. He finds himself purposefully inhaling his sandalwood scent, listening more to the tones of his voice than the exact words he’s saying, wondering what he might taste like, staring at his unruly black hair, desperately wishing he could—
He looks at the nest only a few meters away from him. Another swipe from the tail misses him by an inch, and in that moment he decides to just make a run for it.
Over the next few days, it takes all of Harry’s mental strength to survive the constant whispering, rumors, and taunts that he encounters on a daily basis. He stops going to the Great Hall for food and eats by himself in the kitchens just to get away from the glares. His teachers are the only ones who speak civilly to him, and even they don’t seem particularly interested in his well-being. He misses his friends constantly, especially Ron.
“Hey, Draco, it’s okay,” Harry murmurs softly. He hugs him then, gently, rubbing circles into his back. “Cedric loved you. He would want you to be happy. Wouldn’t you have wanted him to be happy if it had been the other way around, if you had been the one to die? Being with me, or anyone else, won’t diminish the love you two shared. Still, you can take your time. I won’t pressure you to do anything.”
And now Harry had idiotically gone and kissed the boy who was still mourning his dead . . . lover? Boyfriend? Harry didn’t know what they called each other, but that didn’t matter really.
Ron and Hermione leave, and Harry tells them he’ll catch up soon. First, he suspects he needs to talk to a certain Slytherin.
Ron and Fleur sit next to him. They’re both so idealistic and innocent that Harry thinks they could truly trust each other and neither would ever betray that trust. They gaze at each other as if the other person is a revelation. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen two people so lost in each other. Sometimes, Ron leans over to Harry and whispers a quick comment about Fleur in his ear, like “She has a bunch of siblings too, could you imagine if both our families were in one place
He puts the journal on the table in front of him. The pages flip open and land on a page where a question awaits him:
Hi! I'm really sorry it took me sooo much longer than I thought it would to get this chapter up. I started college, and it's been crazy. But I promise I"m not abandoning this story.
Draco had been watching Potter attempt to fight the Hungarian Horntail, and his expression could not be called anything short of
Instead, he and Draco have been chasing their tails playing detective looking for him. A monumental waste of time.
A few seconds pass, before an answer in practically illegible handwriting appears below his question.
Luckily, he’d enchanted his footsteps to be silenced when he arrived here to be the lookout, so it’s all too easy for him to sneak up on Harry now. He leaps at him suddenly, eliciting a yelp from his unsuspecting victim.
He sits in the Champions’ tent while the others face their dragons. Fleur, Cedric, and Viktor leave him one by one. He hears the crowd roar in support for each of them until there’s only Harry left to walk out. Screams from the crowds are the only things he hears as he waits.
While Draco was distracted by his paralyzing thoughts, Harry had taken the initiative to further things along. Suddenly, he’s brought Draco’s lips to meet his, and they’re
Dumbledore turns to the many students gathered, and the room slowly grows quiet. “This year...Hogwarts is hosting the Triwizard Tournament!” The Great Hall erupts in cheers. “We are happy to welcome the students of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang here. Please, treat Hogwarts as your home during your stay. I ask that you all find seats amongst the Hogwarts students already seated.”
spell . . . and, unbeknownst to you or anyone else, I cast a spell lending you some of my magical strength before the task started today.”
The feast dies down, but before anyone can leave, Dumbledore stands up once again. “Some final pieces of information about the Triwizard Tournament: due to some fatalities in the past, only witches and wizards who are of-age may enter this year. You will have until tomorrow’s feast to enter your names in the Goblet of Fire.”
That’s who Draco is kissing. That’s whose wrists Draco is clutching like a lifeline. That’s who is making Draco weak enough to betray the love Cedric had given him.
He bolts up in the middle of the night, sweaty, panting. He’s about to resign himself to spending the rest of the night struggling to sleep without slipping back into the dream when he remembers what worked last time. The meditation.
As Harry starts to leave the Great Hall with his friends, he’s stopped by a hand on his shoulder. “Harry,” says Dumbledore gently.
But just as he reaches the middle of the nest, and as he was about to bend down and snatch the golden egg, he feels a strange warmth on the back of his neck. He whirls around just in time to see a huge, searing column of flames pouring out of the dragon’s mouth straight towards him.
His face hurts badly enough that he decides to use one of the healing potions he’d managed to smuggle out of Hogwarts when the summer rolled around. So Harry locates a potion that takes the form of a pale blue cream and rubs it gently into the left side of his face, where Vernon had hit him. To distract himself, he remembered the odd story of how he’d ended up with such high-quality healing potions:
—that he’s lost Ron, and probably Hermione too, for good. And because of something that isn’t even his fault. Maybe competing in the risky Triwizard Tournament shouldn’t be such a big deal to him. After all, if he doesn’t have friendship keeping him sane anymore, he has nothing else to lose.
of your presence tonight?” The tone to his words gives Draco the impression that his pre-prepared answer is, in fact, the
So he calls out, “No, Harry! Let us!” and then immediately waves his own wand and calls out “Expecto Patronum!” But of course, Harry had already begun casting the spell as well. So both Remus’ and Harry’s Patronuses, a wolf and a stag, run straight for the dementor, forcing it to flee.
How will the relationship between Harry and Ron and Hermione develop? How will Cedric and Draco's new relationship progress, and what impacts will that have on our other characters? Will Snape follow through with his decision to tell Dumbledore about the mysterious, abused student? Who will Harry talk to next in his journal? Find out next time in Chapter Ten: Everything is Fine.
“Good luck, Harry,” Ron suddenly says. Harry looks up at him sharply, hopefully. But then: “I hope the fame is worth it to you. I don’t think we should talk for a while. You need to focus on the Triwizard Tournament that you apparently care so much about.” He stands up, and next thing Harry knows, he’s left sitting alone by the fire. Harry had hoped to be alone when he first walked into the Common Room. But now, he wishes he could feel anything but the emptiness of being truly, completely
But of course, the mere thought of the Gryffindor seems to have summoned him. Draco’s torn between turning around and running straight up to him when he notices who’s with Harry.
With that, the young Malfoy offers a hand to Daphne Greengrass. The brunette daintily accepts and follows him towards the center of the room. Severus snaps his fingers, and a traditional waltz melody begins to play.
support the idea of letting him compete,” adds Igor Karkaroff, Durmstrang’s headmaster, insistently.
Let me know your thoughts in the comments! This was a pretty huge chapter, and I love reading through your comments!
The numbness Harry had been feeling earlier returns, stronger than ever. He worries that he might forget how to breathe as the numbness seeps into his throat and slowly chokes him.
As they’re watching, Viktor and one of the others stand up and place their names in the Goblet of Fire. Harry looks at Ron. “I think I just found my next question.” He returns to his journal.
Ron makes what Harry assumes to be a noise of agreement, though it’s hard to tell when the redhead has a mouthful of bacon.
But then it’s over. Draco glances down to see a skull with a snake protruding out of its mouth staring back at him. “Welcome, Draco Malfoy, to our ranks!” Voldemort proclaims, holding out the freshly inked arm for everyone to see. The sudden movement aches, but Draco knows better than to resist.
But he doesn’t know what to do about the dreams he’s been having. When he took his little midnight venture to Snape’s storeroom, he didn’t take any dreamless sleep draughts or ingredients that could be used to make even one. So unfortunately, Harry’s left with nightmares almost every night. And they’ve been getting worse.
Harry makes a plate of fruit and eggs for himself as he remarks, “That sounds like Luna Lovegood to me.”
Harry doesn’t let himself think about it; he just flings himself at Draco, wrapping himself around the other boy with a frantic energy. Then he feels it drain, as if Draco was a stress ball for his entire body. As quickly as he started it, Harry ends the hug. With a last glance at Draco, he follows Luna into the Room of Requirement.
Their usual table is covered with rose petals, violins and harps float in the air nearby and play beautiful melodies, and a quill writes in the air with big red letters,
Ever since then, Severus hasn’t been able to resist asking questions that are of a more personal nature. While he might have a surly exterior, he
For a brief moment, Harry feels his heart drop. Though he’s not sure why Draco’s words disappoint him so immensely, he can’t help but feel . . . let down, in some way.
The three headmasters, plus the Minister for Magic, then stride into the room mid-argument. “Dumbledore, this simply isn’t possible! You can’t let him compete!” hisses Fudge.
Harry wishes he could disappear through a hole in the floor rather than listen to these adults talk about him as if he isn’t there. He notices Fleur glancing at him almost apologetically from the corner of his eye and feels even more pathetic.
His uncle’s large frame quickly appears beside Petunia’s in Harry’s room. “What is it, darling?” he asks her gruffly.
The rock that he is hiding behind grows hot as fire surrounds him on all sides. As quick as it came, it was gone. But then her tail slams into the rock, and it starts to crumble. Harry dashes behind another rock, holding his shoulder in place as warm blood covers his hand.
“Well, I have arrived to rescue you from your boredom,” Draco drawls as he takes a seat next to Harry. “So when did Granger and Krum become a thing?” he asks, gesturing to the couple talking animatedly nearby.
He had clearly been waiting for her last name, so Hermione had stammered out, “Granger!” Hopefully she sounded smoother than she suspected she did…
Hermione looks at him quizzically, probably wondering why he’s not more concerned about his friend’s whereabouts. “Alright then.”
Last time: It was decided that Harry will be forced to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, his friends abandoned him because they think he planned it, and Harry started talking to Snape in his journal without realizing it.
Harry glances away from Snape angrily while he fights to keep his eyes from filling with tears. For a brief moment, Harry’s eyes meet Malfoy’s. The Slytherin has a smirk plastered on his faces and gives Harry a wink. Harry face gets hot with anger and his blood boils. He slowly  points to himself, then at Malfoy, and mouths,
Dumbledore calls for silence. The chatter in the Great Hall quiets. Harry’s self-deprecating thoughts do not.
Once again, I apologize for the long wait! But thank you so so much to everyone who's been sticking with this story! I'll keep writing it, however long it takes me.
He still remembers the first time he ever saw Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, just right over there at Madam Malkins, getting fitted for robes. He’s not sure whether he’s hoping to see Harry now or not. He feels as drawn to him as he always has, but after the love he experienced from Cedric, it hurts him to think of moving on from such a love, let alone being rejected by the one person he might consider wanting. As if that might ruin the validity of every loving word Cedric ever told him.
Harry stumbles forward but he can’t seem to remember any of the spells he had planned on using. He knows there were some important things about these dragons that he’d found during his research. He knows that he had a plan for how to accomplish this task, but his mind is blank. He knows so many things, but he can’t seem to recall exactly what those things are. At that moment, all he knows and all he can focus on is the horrific fact that there is a living, breathing (
Harry smiles to himself as he watches both of his friends with their partners. Hermione and Viktor, sitting across from him, are having a heated discussion about the value of the Dark Arts in wizarding education. Occasionally, one of them turns to him to get another opinion about one of their points, and he gives his insight. They both give each other just the right amount of respect and challenge, which makes Harry incredibly happy for Hermione.
Disappointment churns in Harry’s stomach. And rage, so much rage that Harry shakes from it. He can’t quite bring himself to direct it at Snape when he knows it’s not the man’s fault, but all this rage has to go somewhere or it will consume him in a deadly blaze.
Harry starts walking out of the tent when he’s suddenly being shoved against the nearby wall of the spectator seating area. He grins up at Draco Malfoy and smirks. “Getting a little handsy, Draco?”
Despite knowing that the room is supposed to do this, it always amazes Harry just how perfectly the room changes itself to meet whatever needs are placed before it. Now, the room is mostly empty space, but the walls are lined with mannequins, presumably for practicing curses against.
“Go inside and get set up,” interrupts an all-too-familiar voice. Luna steps aside, and Draco places himself neatly in front of Harry, taking up his whole field of vision. “You’ll be safe in there while I’m out here. And you’re amazing at defense. You’re the best teacher they could hope to have right now.”
Malfoy and Daphne eagerly choose partners from amongst the inexperienced students, who are mostly muggleborns and the rare halfblood. The other Purebloods soon follow their example. Severus crosses his arm and turns the music back on to watch proudly as his Slytherins perfect the art of dancing.
And that’s how Harry finds himself, a few minutes later, sitting on his bed with the lights off. Imagining his mind as a fortress where he is the sole ruler. Every thought that makes him who he is, he imagines solidifying into stone, the very stone from which he painstakingly creates his fortress. He imagines nightmares as enemies trying to pound down the castle gates. And as the almighty ruler of his mental realm, all he has to do is will the enemies to turn to dust. A golden dust that cannot hurt him and instead is only blown away into the wind.
Remus rolls his eyes and then further explains, “he probably found out about whatever happened to your eye because he suddenly wanted us to keep an eye out for you. I don’t suppose he would have disapproved of our decision to save you from the dementors, but . . . well, he certainly won’t be pleased to learn we’ve taken you from the Dursleys without asking him.”
Harry’s always the last one to leave the Room of Requirement when the meetings are over. Feeling anxious after that close call with Snape, Draco decides to have a little fun using that random observation of his.
Harry feels multiple pairs of eyes on himself as he stands in the middle of the room, staring blankly at the portrait hole where Draco had disappeared through only seconds ago. Why had he run like that? It was only a kiss.
“It doesn’t look too different”. Ron and Hermione share a look, but nothing more is said, and as the trolley witch’s smiling face appears at the door of the compartment, Harry forgets all about their strange actions as he hands over a multitude of galleons in exchange for as many sweets as he can carry.
Malfoy pauses for a second to stare, but before Harry can remark on his focus, he wraps his fingers around the base and kisses the tip. “
After what seems like hours later, the feast arrives and everyone tucks in eagerly, Ron promptly resuming his old habits as he grabs multiple servings of every possible food and loads his plate until Harry isn’t sure he could be able to discern the plate beneath the mountain of food anymore. The whole table laughs when Hermione sniffs angrily, her normal-sized portion of food proportionately smaller than Ron’s. The latter doesn’t seem to mind at all, instead grinning at her through a mouthful of food. She looks positively scandalised.
Harry groans onto Malfoy’s mouth as he instantly loses control and all semblances of heterosexuality at the taste of the alcohol that has brought about this peculiar situation, pushing one hand into Malfoy’s hair and the other gripping his arse, Malfoy gripping Harry’s face with both hands as he pushes his tongue into Harry’s mouth. Harry’s small sound of surprise at the speed of the kiss is muffled by Malfoy’s mouth, his tongue sweeping the roof of Harry’s mouth as he moans, Harry pulling Malfoy’s bottom lip between his teeth and groaning deeply. He gently brings his hand up to the other’s face, caressing his jaw gently. Neither seem to want to stop as they stand there in the middle of the room, hands around each other and lips moving, but eventually, Harry pulls away, gasping for air, pushing Malfoy away from him. He covers his mouth with a hand. People are staring, barking laughs surrounding them as Malfoy breaths heavily, still staring at Harry, pupils blown wide still. Apparently coming to another decision, he grabs Harry’s hand and leads him towards the door, away from the prying eyes, walking swiftly, ignoring Harry’s gentle tugs at the long fingers that hold him captive.
But, Harry thinks, Malfoy’s reaction had connoted something entirely different. He had felt emotion behind that kiss, behind the dig of his fingers into Harry’s scalp and the sweep of his tongue against Harry’s bottom lip.
McGonagall looks up as the three enter, dotting the last ‘I’ on her parchment and flourishing her wand at it, the class watching mesmerised as it rolls up perfectly and seals itself seamlessly.
“Ah, Potter, Weasley, Granger, how lovely to see you on time to a class. I must admit, I had hoped to see better timing from you two this year”, she says, looking pointedly at Harry and Ron before continuing, “but I believe that this is the first time you have been punctual to my class this year, am I correct?”.
Harry shudders at the memory of the bat-like professor swooping into the common room in the middle of the night, face alight with fury, several students screaming louder than necessary at the sight of him.
“Eighth years!”. The shrill voice rings out through the common room later that evening, and Harry quickly goes downstairs to see what all of the fuss was about. He’s met with a multitude of other confused students. Pansy Parkinson is standing on one of the couches, legs planted apart and hands on her hips, looking determined. “I have decided that we all need to forget our pasts and remember that we are all Hogwarts students who made it past the Battle!”. Her statement is met with several raised eyebrows, and Harry notices several students try and make their way back stealthily towards their dormitories.
His face is drawn and paler than usual, although his mouth is still in the same downturned sneer that never seems to leave, hair ruffled slightly and eyes ringed with dark circles. He looks like he hasn't slept at all. Some small part of Harry thinks smugly of the fact that he is responsible for this lack of shut-eye, but as he feels a smirk start to grow on his face, he quickly throws the thoughts back to the dark recess of his mind they came from and stands up, wiping his mouth with a napkin.
The bright coloured strobe lights that Hermione’s conjured flit around the room, casting the students into neon shadow as they dance around on the hard floor in the middle of the common room, holding bottles of alcohol and singing at the top of their lungs.
“I’m not sure what you’ve heard, and I’m flattered that you like me and that you think it meant something”, Harry breaks off wheezing with laughter as Malfoy grows even more infuriated.
Parvati pats her reassuringly on the back, and the two quickly strike up a hearty conversation, Harry left to discuss the mechanics of the sword of Gryffindor with a greatly-changed Neville. He’s finally home. After so long, after enduring so much, he had returned to the school that made him feel more at home that Privet Drive had ever done. Smiling, he tucks into his food and listens happily to Neville.
“Let’s go”. Sighing resolutely, he stands up and walks over to the blonde, pulling him up by the arm. “Let’s get this over and done with”. Malfoy’s face is already far too close, but Harry makes himself go closer. Taking a deep breath, he closes his eyes and angles his face, lips gently brushing Malfoy’s. An electric rush runs through him, and Malfoy jolts, pulling away immediately. His pupils are blown wide, and unless Harry’s muggle knowledge has served him wrongly—is Malfoy turned on? Gently curling a hand around the nape of Malfoy’s neck, Harry captures his lips in another kiss, this time parting his lips gently, flicking his tongue against Malfoy’s bottom lip. The blonde groans almost inaudibly in response, and draws Harry closer, opening his mouth fully as his hand sinks into his dark curls, pulling slightly on the hair. Harry feels Malfoy’s tongue against his, sweeping through his mouth, against his own tongue, as they both breathe heavily. Harry’s head is swimming. It feels so good, but with this many people watching? No, if he’s kissing Malfoy, he wants him by himself. Pulling away, with a final nip to Malfoy’s bottom lip, Harry’s hand contracts slightly on Malfoy’s neck, noses brushing as they stare into each other’s eyes. The room is silent, until Blaise wolf whistles.
The music pounds through his head and Malfoy’s hands tighten on his hips, swaying Harry along in time to the music, pulling him in to the his chest, lining them up from legs to shoulders. Harry’s mind is in overdrive, spinning with the alcohol and the feeling of a warm hard chest at his back, shifting behind him with the music.
His mind is snapped back to reality when Malfoy suddenly sinks to his knees, staring up at Harry through dark eyelashes as he unbuttons his pants. “Malfoy, are you sure about this? You don’t have to-“, he’s quickly interrupted as Malfoy pulls his pants down to his knees, snarling in response: “Potter, shut up for a second, will you?”. Nodding quickly, Harry is unable to stop himself from reaching down and carding a hand through Malfoy’s thick, soft hair. He’s not sure he’s going to be able to prepare himself for what comes next, to be honest. Seconds later, he’s proved correct as Malfoy slides a hand to the bulge in his boxers and palms him through them, following with his mouth a second later.
“I’m sure you can deal with Potter for this year Malfoy, you are, in fact, adults now”. Her knowing look had confused Harry, but as Malfoy turned around and fixed Harry with a glare of absolute and unfaltering hatred, he felt his heart sink. Back to their usual antics it seemed. As he tugs his trunk to the foot of his bed, already bedecked with Gryffindor banners, he stares for a moment at the Slytherin ones next to his and sighs. Somehow, he isn’t at all surprised that Malfoy has turned out to be the same person that he had left behind the previous year. But still, there had been a small glimmer of hope that maybe it would be different this time.
He’s wanted Malfoy for a very long time, perhaps even subconsciously, but he’s never let himself think about the boy now panting into his neck for long enough to answer his question. So, hands drifting down Malfoy’s back to gently rest on his hips, he leans into Malfoy’s ear and whispers, “surprise me?”.
“I’m going to bed”, he announces, ignoring the outraged squawks of his classmates and shutting the door of his room quietly and leaning against the solid wood, closing his eyes, trying to focus on the feeling of the carved ridges of wood against his shoulder blades.
“We’re both drunk. You’re going to regret this”. Malfoy shakes his head, removing Harry’s hand from his chest and breathing out the next sentence quickly. “There’s nothing I’ve ever done when drunk that I wouldn't have done sober, had I had the confidence”.
The rain doesn’t seem to be easing as Draco Malfoy stares up into the overcast sky outside King’s Cross station. Grey clouds roll across the heavens and Muggles trot dutifully through the rain, umbrellas bent double against the harsh wind. Clearing his throat and shaking his sleeve back, he peers down into the uniformly ticking hands of his watch. He has ten minutes before the train leaves with all of the new hopefuls, witches and wizards that will likely all end up behind cluttered desks at the ministry, their initial excitement crushed when they finally realised that the Wizarding World isn’t all that it is cracked up to be. What a beautiful day to begin his eighth year at Hogwarts.
All the while, Harry moans above him, hand tightening in Malfoy’s hair at the base of his neck. Below him, the blonde lets out a soft moan as he sinks down to the hilt, a slight tremor in his throat the only sign of discomfort. Harry moans as Malfoy swallows around his cock, the wave of his orgasm fast approaching. He won’t last long like this.
With one last shake of her head, McGonagall returns to her kippers and conjures a newspaper to hover in front of her face, blocking the insulting view of the clearly hungover eighth-years. The other teachers, not nearly so observant or well-known of the grade that has caused many an issue within the school, chatter merrily with each other, Harry eyeing Hagrid as he sips from a metal flask, reminiscent of Moody’s in the fourth year.
It’s always been so, so easy to reel Malfoy in with some well-timed taunt and then slap him within something completely untrue but irritating. Shaking his head, he puts his hands into his pockets and pulls open the Marauder’s Map, scanning it quickly for a name.
There is hardly any doubt in Harry’s mind that he wants this, so, so badly, but how is another question to ponder entirely. To be honest, he has no idea.
“Fine. But I’m not making out with him”. Pansy shakes her head, smiling far too much. “The dare is the dare Potter. The whole shabang, or whatever you call it”. She crooks a finger at Harry, gesturing to where Malfoy scowls at her side.
She shakes her head, placing a single slice of sausage onto her tongue and chewing mournfully. “I don’t know Harry. Your tongues seemed to tell a different story”. His gasp of outrage is drowned out by a squeal.
Taking another breath, Harry comes to a decision, tucking his bottle into Hermione’s arms for safekeeping and walking in to join the throng of students dancing to Labrinth’s, Formula. He closes his eyes for a brief second, Pansy appearing in front of him when he opens them. He grins at her, as she winks and pulls a passing Ginny in from the sides of the dance floor, the latter not objecting as Pansy puts her arms around her shoulders and grins at her, both mouthing the words to each other, clearly far deeper into the alcohol stores than himself. Shaking his head, he dances on his own for a couple of seconds, forgetting about the reason he walked onto the dance floor in the first place, before he feels a pair of hands lightly grab his waist, holding him still and stopping him from spinning around.
There isn’t another party until several weeks later, again held in the eighth year dorm, Pansy enthusiastically pinning up a notice on the cork-board next to the portrait hole, delivering exciting news about alcoholic prospects.
He’s never felt anything for any other boy in his life. He pushes away the red hair and sharp earring of Bill Weasley that swim to the front of his mind and straightens his back, trying to reach Malfoy’s height as the other glares down at him.
Turning to face Harry, Draco grins slightly, pulling Harry in for a kiss before her pulls away again. “I think we need to talk about this”. Nodding resignedly, Harry pulls his boxers back up his legs and raises his head to look at Draco.
“I never said that! Shut up for once in your life, you fuckwit and stop thinking about yourself all the time!”. With that, Malfoy turns and slams out of the cupboard, leaving Harry to laugh quietly to himself.
Harry lets his head fall back against the wall with a groan as Malfoy continues to lathe his tongue over the small marks he’s leaving with gentle nips of his teeth.
Warm, nimble fingers snake underneath his shirt, undoing the buttons until the fabric is hanging loosely from his shoulders, belt buckle somehow undone without Harry noticing. But, he supposes, it is hard to notice anything when you’re being kissed like no one has ever kissed you before.
”, Harry groans, unprepared for the feeling that a simple kiss leaves pooling in his groin. Malfoy closes his mouth around Harry’s cock, swirling his tongue around him and taking him halfway down, hollowing out his cheeks.
“You two. Snog. I’ve always wanted to see some enemies-to-lovers shit between you two, but since it’s not going to happen naturally you clearly need a bit of a push”. Malfoy has gone pale and is sneering at Harry. “Never. I’m not kissing that”. “Making out with that, actually”, Blaise corrects, chuckling evilly. Harry shakes his head.
Harry’s mind is wiped blank when Malfoy’s mouth drifts down to his peaked nipple, sucking gently on it before he moves his hand down to Harry’s belt, pulling it out of his pants and throwing it onto the floor beside them without breaking away from Harry’s chest, which he is now trailing kisses across.
Briefly registering the use of his first name, Harry pulls Malfoy’s pants down the full way, spinning him around and pulling his back flush to Harry’s chest. Conjuring a small bottle of luve, Harry coats his fingers in it before snicking the bottle shut and throwing it to the ground on top of their clothes. Malfoy lets his head fall back against Harry’s shoulder as Harry brushes one finger against his entrance, gently pushing the digit inside as Malfoy hisses through his teeth. Harry leaves a gentle kiss against his neck, stroking his other hand down Malfoy’s arm soothingly. “Sorry Draco. Do you want me to stop?”. Draco shakes his head quickly, letting out a loud gasp as Harry’s finger brushes against a sensitive spot.
His legs feel slightly jittery and perhaps it's just the aftermath of the kiss, but he finds his mind drifting back to Malfoy and the blonde’s pale eyes widening in shock as they pulled away from their embrace.
He has to admit, Hermione’s magic prowess has saved many a party, Harry thinks as he sips at his firewhiskey, relishing the burn as it goes down his throat, leaving a trail of heat through his body, the music pumping through the room and surrounding him with noise.
“Attention, everyone!” Dumbledore calls out as he stands before the assembled students of all three magical schools. The chatter in the Great Hall quickly dies down to an expectant silence. “As you may recall, one of our favored traditions during the years of Triwizard Tournaments is the Yule Ball. This year, that tradition will continue! Hogwarts students, you will all recieve dancing instructions from your heads of houses. Champions, be sure that you select appropriate companions to accompany you. The Yule Ball shall be a celebration that we all enjoy together as we put aside our competitions for the night!”
Hermione nods. “But they’ll figure out who you are if you give away too many details about yourself.”
“Thanks for the warning earlier,” Harry pants out. Draco can feel his heart racing from where his hands are wrapped around the other boy’s wrists, fingers against his pulse points.
Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor all look grim as they gather around Barty Crouch Sr., who holds a small pouch in his hands. It’s the day of the first task, and everyone seems to have figured out that they’ll be fighting dragons. At least, Harry assumes they have, since none of his fellow Champions seemed shocked to hear one of the judges, Ludo Bagman, announce what the first task entails.
. She moves her body to further block her precious eggs from his sight and snarls at him warningly as she makes eye contact with him.
He’s confused at first, but only for a moment. The events of yesterday pour over him, drowning him in their miserable torrents.
That evening, the Great Hall buzzed in anticipation of the announcement of the Triwizard Tournament Champions. Harry, however, was not as excited for the event as he had been that morning. News of Malfoy’s note had spread around the school like wildfire, and everyone seemed to believe Snape’s accusation that Harry had written it himself. Everyone shook their heads pityingly and whispered to each other when they saw him. Whispered had followed Harry ever since he first stepped foot inside Hogwarts, but these felt different. These whispers seemed to crawl under his skin and take residence inside him, multiplying beyond measure until the only thoughts he had left were just as pathetic as everyone thought he was.
He shouldn’t be surprised that it ends up being Granger who provides them with that last ingredient. She and Krum were strolling past their table in the library, when Harry’s exclamation of “There’s got to be
The Dursleys’ house has never been Harry’s home. After all, homes are supposed to make people feel safe and relaxed. It might be accurate to call Hogwarts Harry’s home. But certainly not Number Four, Privet Drive. There, Harry has only ever experienced discomfort at best and torment at worst.
His eye is then caught by a few younger students snickering, presumably because they assume he can’t see them.
Remus Lupin and Sirius Black had not argued with Dumbledore when he instructed them, as members of the Order of the Phoenix, to discreetly keep an eye on Number 4 Privet Drive and its residents. In fact, they had not even questioned him, though both men were quite curious as to what Dumbledore thought warranted such close monitoring there.
But then Harry’s mind lands upon a thought that he can’t get rid of, so he decides to verbalize it.. “Draco, I have to ask. You helped me with the first task. Do you have any ideas about what the golden egg could be telling me about the next task? When I open it, it just makes screeching sounds.”
So Harry’s been left to mull over how Dumbledore of all people could knowingly leave him trapped in this situation. He knows he’s been spending way too much time dwelling on negativity, but he can’t seem to avoid it lately.
She wrote that down as “The Boy-Who-Lived Overcomes Forgetfulness Curse to Defeat Terrifying Beast.”
Sirius hadn’t been paying attention as he pled with Remus, so Remus was the only one watching Harry as he stood up and walked towards the tunnel. With a quick “Shhh” to Sirius, he grabs the man by the arm and tugs him to follow after Harry.
A few days later and after many frantic exchanges with Snape, the infection has died down enough for Harry to stop shaking in fear and pain every time he has to check on his eye. But that doesn’t mean his problems are all over.
When Harry wakes up the next day, he automatically reaches up to rub the sleep out of his eyes, like he always does. But this time, searing pain causes him to jerk his hand away from his left eye immediately upon contact.
“Good,” he says slowly, while backing away from them. “I shall see you in detention if you change your minds.” Severus then makes it clear that he’s addressing the entire group now by sweeping out an arm to gesture to everyone. “Now, I would like to see those of you who are experienced dancers pair up with those who are not. Ballroom dancing is a
He notices the shock and distrust in Lupin’s expression, but he pays the former professor no mind, instead focusing on Harry. Letting him know that this is his choice, one that Draco will respect.
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic arrives much more gracefully, with the doors gently swinging open. The students glide down the aisle, wearing baby blue dresses, shawls, and hats. Harry watches with mild disinterest, but he notices that Ron’s attention is completely overtaken by a particularly beautiful blond young woman. Harry elbows Hermione, and they both roll their eyes as Ron practically drools over her.
Harry always hates asking for favors from Dobby, since it seems like taking advantage of someone’s good nature, but he asks anyway. “There’s an ingredient that I need for a potion. I’m not sure where it would be, exactly, but it’s important that I find it soon.”
—” Harry feels his voice break, whether with anger or sadness or frustration or something else entirely, he can’t tell— “and you haven’t been there. And
sloppily taped to his face. And And the boy had been walking so slowly, as if every step perhaps hurt a little. Remus looks back at Sirius and nods sadly.
Draco is also laughing, and he offers a hand to Harry. He mockingly bows and asks, “Will you dance with me?”
"Come on," he snorted, trying to salvage the situation. "I'm just pulling your leg. It's indescribably better than the warm piss I'd been drinking before." He elbowed Harry's ribs for a good measure.
"Yes, well… we don't know what Ron would have wanted, do we?" tears welled up in Hermione's eyes. "I can't have this baby alone, Harry. I can't do this without him."
"We keep checking the temperature all the way up the stairs. According to Pansy's research and Mrs. Emsworth's statement, her mother committed suicide in the attic. We can presume that the manifestation point is therefore going to be the attic, however, we should keep our eyes open in case the object, the Source, that keeps the ghost tied to this place is hidden elsewhere in the house," Harry said.
„Well then, Kreacher can go sulk back to his hole or wherever he lives,“ Harry grumbled and stalked to the library.
Potter blushed. "Right. And what's that for?" Potter pointed at a thermometer in an effort to salvage the situation. Realizing he'd just inadvertently provided Draco with more evidence of his own stupidity, he hid his face in his palms instead and sighed in resignation.
Draco stiffened. Why did everyone have to remind him of his perfect relationship with Harry when he couldn't remember a bloody second of it? Why couldn't everyone leave him alone?
"I don't know, it seems awfully tailored to me, don't you think?" Harry quipped. "All those snide remarks and one picture even represents me running away from the ghosts back in the mansion."
Another thing she would never admit out loud was that she was grateful to Potter for joining their agency, even temporarily. It meant she could stay at home instead of going out at night with Draco. Draco, who acted like a bloody Gryffindor these days, with his heroic deeds like throwing himself into danger or more recently saving Scarheads from some of the most haunted mansions they'd ever encountered. She understood why Draco changed, what events had lead to him becoming the person he was now. However, that didn't mean she wanted to change too. She was satisfied being cowardly, sequestered in the safety of her iron-and-lavender-protected flat.
"I'm a bloody healer, I know what's good for my baby and what's not, Harry! I'm going to push myself as hard as I see fit," Hermione glared at him pointedly and jabbed her index finger into the middle of Harry's chest.
Draco squirmed and realized somewhere along the way, that Harry had slipped three fingers inside him and he was still pushing them inside Draco ever so gently. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's hips and pulled him into an embrace.
It was just after six in the afternoon when Harry heard the tell-tale whoosh of the Floo from the living room.
A bottle of lube landed in Potter's hand who opened it and passed it to Draco wordlessly. Draco dipped his fingers in the oily substance and smeared a generous amount around Potter's puckered hole. Potter hissed at the sensation and shoved his arse against Draco's fingers, silently begging for more.
Draco whimpered and scrambled up to the podium. He knocked the microphone out of the way and claimed Harry's lips in a desperate kiss. He tried to convey with every swipe of his tongue how sorry he was for not doing it much, much sooner.
"Now, I don't mean to force you out of your own home, Mrs. Emsworth," Draco's voice dripped with fake politeness. "However, it's getting late and I would like to get a feel of the house before it gets dark."
Harry stumbled through the Floo into Hermione's living room. It was past midnight and the flat was dark and silent. Harry turned on the lights immediately, hating the darkness after the events in the cellar of the mansion. He ran his hands across his face tiredly and sighed. He'd showered at home, changed into his pajamas, and then went straight here. He needed the comfort of another living person. Harry always slept on the sofa when he stayed over but this time he couldn't bear the thought of being alone. He crossed the living room and the corridor and quietly opened the door to Hermione's bedroom. Harry turned on the lamp that stood on the bedside table and slid under the covers as gently as he could. His careful movements woke Hermione up anyway.
“Sure, I’ll be here to save your pretty little arse if you mess up,” Draco’s hot breath tickled Harry’s ear.
A furiously blushing Harry stumbled into Draco's vision, obscuring his view of the podium. He shot a glare to his right. Draco turned to see where he was looking. Blaise was standing close by, grinning from ear to ear. Something seemed to pass between him and Harry. Blaise lifted his eyebrows and motioned with his head toward Draco. Harry blushed even more.
The air between them felt charged again all of a sudden and Draco couldn't tear his eyes from Potter's full, red lips, stretched in a mischievous grin.
Meanwhile, Harry managed to almost work himself up to a panic attack. Draco‘s heart couldn‘t take it anymore, seeing him so vulnerable and hurt. So he did the only thing he knew would assuredly distract Harry.
"Yes, Sir?" Harry wanted nothing more than to run out of the door and follow Draco. He forced himself to stay calm and composed.
Draco looked at him and narrowed his eyes. Goldstein's dirty blonde hair was styled impeccably, in contrast to Potter's unruly nest of black hair. His eyes were all wrong. Blue, not like the vivid emerald green of Potter's eyes. Goldstein never argued with him, never laughed at his jokes, and was generally the most boring bloke Draco'd ever met. Goldstein plopped onto Potter's-no-more chair and started unpacking his sandwich. Draco didn't even have to look and knew it was a ham and cheese sandwich. Cheddar cheese to be precise.
Harry wheeled around, his eyes desperately seeking Montague and McLaggen. A medi-wizard was placing white linen over their bodies. Harry tore his arm out of Robards's grasp and ran toward the medi-wizard.
"I…," Granger trailed off. She paced around her office where they'd returned after their trip to one of the Spell Damage rooms. She shuffled some papers around her desk distractedly. "I'm trying to think like him but I can't. I just don't know what he's going to do! What if he dies? What am I going to do without him? I can't lose Harry too!" she dropped into her chair heavily and hid her face in her palms.
„Your wish is my command,“ Draco moved lower and scraped his teeth across Harry‘s collarbone. He let his tongue follow the bone up to Harry‘s shoulder, then trailed feather-light kisses down his pectorals. His hands caressed Harry‘s ribs up and down. He took a nipple in his mouth and sucked at it, traced it with his tongue, then pulled back and blew air over it. It earned him a loud gasp and he felt Harry‘s spine bow under him. How he loved Harry‘s gasps and the soft shuddering sighs he made when aroused. Draco focused again and kissed along Harry‘s flank, replacing his hand with his mouth. He came to a halt at the secret spot he had discovered on Harry‘s body, just under his right hipbone, where it almost met the thigh. He licked the skin there in a single, long line, repeating the movement several times. His cock jumped when Harry moaned out loud and his hand sneaked its way into Draco‘s hair.
"Thank you, I'm alright, really," Harry said. His voice sounded steady but hollow in his ears, devoid of all emotion. He was not alright but he had to pretend for his own sake.
"Don't tell me you never wanked at work. I find it quite liberating," Harry looked at him innocently. "Maybe you should give it a go."
"There aren't many options for a gay man who happens to be a former Death Eater, are there? The disgusted looks I get, the insults thrown my way, it kind of makes it hard to find someone who would want me. And those who wanted to take me to bed were all perverts, seeking the thrill of fucking a Death Eater. You have no idea what filth some people are able to let out of their mouths. And I would never pay for sex, ever," Draco shook his head and Harry marveled at how his hair reflected the light.
The key shot from under the bed so fast Harry didn‘t have time to catch it and it slammed into his belly. He picked up the key from the floor where it had fallen again and Apparated to the corridor of Draco's apartment building. He had to try three times to fit the key inside the lock as his hands were trembling vigorously.
"You're doing really well, Hermione. I just wish you tried to rest a bit more, it can't be good for the baby…" Harry trailed off.
Maybe something good could come out of this alliance. If Draco was perfectly honest with himself, his life had been peaceful recently, despite all the ghost-hunting business and saving lives. He missed the kind of strange warmth of excitement he only ever got from nagging and irritating Potter. Working together meant he could start making fun of him again, watch those green eyes narrow dangerously, watch Potter's hands pull at his hair in anger, making the bird's nest on his head even more atrocious than before. He especially enjoyed watching Potter flush when Draco said something witty and Potter couldn't come up with a retort fast enough.
There was a plush, beige carpet on the floor and a flower-patterned wallpaper decorated the walls of the corridor. Other than that, it was empty, bare, void of furniture. Several paintings hung from the walls to each side. There were two doors on the right and two on the left.
"Oh, he told me. And you know what? It's a mad idea, it's not safe to use magic around ghosts. It's like a magnet to them. If you cast a spell in their vicinity, they will trail you until sunrise or until you get far enough from their Source. I watched too many people lose their lives and I will not watch another one die just to test some stupid theory," Draco sneered.
When Malfoy didn't say a word for a while, Harry looked up. Malfoy was staring at him, his mouth agape, eyes wide.
"I heard the stories about the Ministry myself. They are in denial. It was one of the reasons I founded the agency, actually," Draco nodded.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the window. A barn owl was impatiently waiting there, tapping the glass with her beak. Draco crossed the room and took the letter. He offered the owl a treat who took it gratefully and flew off.
Draco gaped at him. "It's a slow song, Harry. It's really hard to dance to a slow song and not look like a couple."
„Like this?“ Draco asked as he shoved his dick inside Harry‘s arse, just like Harry had begged him to. He didn‘t let Harry accommodate to the intrusion and started mercilessly pounding the hot, tight flesh surrounding him. Normally he would take his time entering Harry carefully so as not to hurt him but they‘d had sex in the afternoon and Harry was still a bit loose from it.
He turned around to see Ron who had apparently finished his awful performance, managed to disentangle himself from his partner in crime, and joined them. Seamus was nowhere to be seen.
Harry's knees were shaking with the need to come all over Draco. He regretfully pulled away, leaving Draco blinking dazedly at him.
"You wish I could what?" Harry asks. He feels a sudden urge to hug Malfoy, to wipe away the hurt, the fear, the helplessness.
However, Draco was sure being seen with Harry in public was a bad idea. He had a feeling as if the whole world would suddenly explode, upturning and possibly destroying the cozy life they had built together. At the same time, he had wished many times not to have to hide from Harry‘s friends who regularly popped into Grimmauld Place unannounced. Draco hated he had to lie to Pansy and come up with excuses why he couldn‘t meet up with her and Blaise as often as he used to (headaches, stomach aches, and other aches were such common excuses for him that Pansy taunted him in every conversation he should get checked in St Mungo‘s).
"Desperate times call for desperate measures," Draco paused dramatically. "We're hitting the room with magnesium flares."
"You think asking me about my sexual failures is going to make me happy?" Harry asked him incredulously.
"Took you long enough. What were you doing there, Potter? Wanking?" Malfoy smirked at him from his seat behind the desk.
„Now, now, Potter,“ Draco dragged out Harry‘s name like he used to at school. The tone always drove Harry mental. Nowadays, however, it was a different sort of mental than back at Hogwarts. „I will fuck you, I will shove my prick inside your arse so hard you won‘t be able to breathe.“
Harry smiled at him gratefully and stroke his cheek with his thumb in a familiar gesture. "That's not the whole truth," Harry sighed. "Before Draco got home, my ex-girlfriend, Ginny Weasley stopped by. She told me she saw Draco cheating on me three weeks prior. I honestly lost it, I trashed the whole place, I went mad for a bit there. Draco got home around eleven. I was already calmer by then but then when Draco said he was too tired to talk to me and he didn't even know it was so late… well, I thought he was lying to me and I exploded."
"This is ridiculous, I'm out of here," Potter turned around and pointed his wand at the front door. Draco lurched and grabbed the wand, plucking it from his grasp. Potter gaped at him as if he couldn't comprehend how Draco managed to steal his wand.
The Floo in the library chimed and Harry nearly broke his neck on the stairs as he ran up from the kitchen, hoping it was Draco, finally ready to talk. Harry had spent the last few days holed up in his flat, bawling his eyes out. He missed Draco so fucking much. He missed his laughter, his secret smiles, his touches, the stupid jokes he always made. Harry missed the teasing and constant complaints about the state of Harry's hair and wardrobe. Harry wanted nothing more than to wrap Draco in his arms. He couldn't breathe without Draco, he couldn't…
"I might or might not have visited her yesterday when you weren't there," Harry blushed slightly. "Do you still love me then?"
"It's going to be bad," Draco sounded tired. There was an underlying emotion in his voice Pansy couldn't identify. It worried her, she knew him almost as well as she knew herself. Not being able to tell what Draco was thinking scared her a bit. "It's going to be really bad, Pansy."
"The fuck it was," Harry fumed. "Either treat Draco with respect he deserves as the victim he is or this interview is over."
Draco turned his head towards Potter. "Please, Harry, this agency is everything I have," he looked at him beseechingly and squeezed his thigh under the table for emphasis.
During their briefing earlier that day, they had memorized the blueprints of the mansion. The house was built in the 1850s as a residence of a wealthy lord. Later on, when the noble died with no heir, the mansion was auctioned and sold off. It changed its owner many times until it last served as a sanatorium for mentally ill patients during World War II. Since then it had been left to lie idle.
"My love for the Cannons cannot be deterred by such a trifle as team colours. Whom should I support to satisfy your pure-blooded aesthetics?" Ron snickered.
Harry slowly opened his eyes and blinked languidly in the soft morning light shining through the windows of his bedroom. He had always loved waking up on Saturday mornings, especially mornings like these – azure blue spring sky, crispy air that he could almost feel on his skin even through the closed windows, rays of sun caressing his skin. As he sighed contentedly, he felt a questing hand slide slowly across his flank. Harry grinned and turned to lie on his back, stretching his arms and legs in the process. His gaze slid to the sculpted planes of his boyfriend‘s chest, then higher over his collarbone, neck, pointed chin, finally losing himself in those amazing grey eyes. He gently stroked the beautiful face hovering above him.
Instead of replying, Draco tore at the zipper of Potter's trousers and sneaked his hand inside. He grabbed Potter's cock in his hand and slid his thumb inside the slit. Potter's whole body jerked and a loud moan erupted from his throat.
"Pans, chuck some salt bombs at the Spectres, then we're out of here," Draco clapped her shoulder quickly and they both joined Potter in the circle. Draco immediately left it again and headed toward the front door, which was closed shut. Draco remembered leaving it open and a shiver ran through him. He felt as if the mansion around him gathered a second breath. The air was heavy with it. Draco couldn't describe it in any other way.
"They are dead anyway," Robards shook Harry's arm forcefully. "Do you hear me? They are dead and you could have died too! It was all for nothing!"
"Come on, no time to soothe your virginal ego," Harry chuckled. No matter what, he always enjoyed riling Draco up. He always flushed such a pretty shade of pink. "We've got to move, there's a robbery in progress at Gringott's."
"I am being reasonable!" Harry shouted. "For fuck's sake, someone tortured him! Someone used the Cruciatus curse on him. He's lucky there is no permanent damage. And I shouldn't forget to mention that someone Obliviated the shit out of him!"
"Draco," Potter sounded exasperated but held Draco tight in his arms. "Stop fighting me! I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing because we are both idiots!"
„Shit, I don‘t have time for this,“ Harry muttered under his breath. „Accio Draco‘s house key!“ he shouted.
Harry jumped out of his (not his anymore, was it?) seat and shouted, feeling hurt and betrayed. "You finally found an excuse to get rid of me, didn't you?"
The second his feet touched the cobbled stones of Diagon Alley, Harry aimed straight for Robards, knowing Draco would follow him.
"You're worse than my eighty-year-old grandmother. She knows how to have fun. You're actually worse than a blushing virgin," Smith taunted Draco, a sneer plastered to his face.
"Of course not, don't be absurd. I just thought you missed me a little bit more, that's all," Harry said sullenly.
He gently bit Draco‘s arse while quickly rubbing some lube on his cock and positioning himself at Draco‘s opening.
„Mr. Malfoy, not only were you Obliviated but your body was repeatedly subjected to a Cruciatus curse. That is why you experienced the pain, vomiting, and blacking out. Your muscles contracted to the point where the fibers broke from the strain of suffering under the curse. It is similar to working out regularly, the fibers in the muscles break and one feels sharp pain over the course of time when the muscles heal,“ the medi-wizard explained gently.
With that, he disappeared back through the door. Draco waited until the door clicked shut behind him. After the noise of the club, the toilet felt oddly quiet, even though Draco could still faintly hear the music and feel the beat juddering under his feet.
"Wait, are you saying?" Draco turned around sharply to look at Potter's face. "Are you saying what I think you're saying?"
It was. The ghost appeared before them, riding on a wave of rage. This time, the apparition didn't repeat its endless death loop, it aimed directly for them. It stopped so close to the circle, its nose was almost touching it. Pale other-light radiated from the ghost as if it was phosphorescent. A cold wind blew from its direction, striking the invisible ward surrounding them. Draco could feel a wave of fear wash over them. Next to him, Harry was staring at the ghost in panic.
Hermione sighed. She sat down next to Ron and took his hands in hers gently. "Neither did I. I wish she came to us for help."
Harry slowly crossed the space and opened the door on the left gingerly, revealing a children’s bedroom. Nineteen degrees, he noted with relief. Dark shapes littered the polished wooden floor that gleamed in the dim moonlight coming in through the window. The room was darker than the corridor, meaning it was likely situated toward the back garden. Harry discerned the shapes on the floor as toys, books, and clothing. Two beds with patchwork bedding were placed in each corner of the room. A desk was situated under the window opposite the doorway he was standing in. An armoire occupied the space to his right. Harry inhaled the scent of baby powder mixed with fresh laundry and what he could only describe as happy childhood. As he moved inside to investigate the bedroom closer, he stumbled on a box he didn't notice lying on the floor. It toppled over and several round objects rolled out of it. The sound was too loud in the silence of the house. It reverberated through the room, the rumble of rolling balls echoing in Harry's ears. His heart was hammering against his ribs and he could almost taste his pulse in his throat.
Draco's eyebrows shot up before he could stop himself. He growled when the realization hit him. "I didn't agree to anything. What did Potter tell you?"
"Really?" Harry's head snapped up. His whole face lit up with the force of his smile. Harry's eyes shone from under the long black eyelashes, stronger than a thousand suns.
Tears prickled the back of Draco's throat as he tried to swallow them. He cuddled Harry closer to him and kissed away the tears that had spilled out of Harry's eyes. "I'm yours, Harry. Forever and ever," he whispered, ignoring the fact they'd both turned into the biggest of Hufflepuffs.
Draco ignored him and continued his rant. "Now, my dearest baby boy, tell me what you're going to do first. I'll let you lead but I'll stop you before you manage to fuck up the case entirely."
Draco had to admit Luna had a stunning, soft, almost whimsical singing voice. It suited the song beautifully.
Harry didn't want to have sex with Draco, not like this, but he nodded anyway. He would go with Draco only to tell him he wanted a relationship with him and would wait until Draco was ready.
"I recall you demanding rather loudly to be, and I quote, rid of the menace that calls itself Potter permanently," Robards glared at Malfoy rather smugly in Harry's opinion.
"Haha, very funny," Harry made a face at him, then beamed again. "I can't believe I have my own rapier now."
"Go on, have a laugh! I'm twenty-eight and still a fucking virgin." Draco growled. Why did he have to babble like that? He wished the ground would swallow him on the spot.
Harry followed him warily. Malfoy's office looked just as cliché as the reception area. Malfoy sat down behind his desk and motioned Harry to sit opposite to him in one of the two guest chairs. To Harry's left, there was an ugly khaki-coloured sofa. To his right, the wall was lined with the same metal filing cabinets Harry had noticed in Parkinson's lair. Malfoy sat with his back to a window. Rays of sunshine flitted in through the half-drawn blinds, making his pale hair sparkle in the light. Harry realized, utterly horrified at his own thoughts, that Malfoy looked stunning.
