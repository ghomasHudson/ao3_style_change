“You do something like that,” Dean tipped his tongue out quickly and rolled it on his lower lip, bringing this latter with his tongue towards the inside of his mouth. Then he scraped his teeth against the same lip and released it slowly until it was back to being full again.”
“You already ate?” Blaise’s tone claimed to be nonchalant, but Fulvia wasn’t fooled.  She knew he was worried about her and looked out for her; still, she tried to control her furrowed brows.
appear on her screen and she interrupted both her thoughts and her walk to unlock and read the text. Surely, it would be about their fight the other day, he still felt guilty and maybe wanted to tell her how sorry he was. Right?!
It’s okay Mari, I love you. Don’t worry. I’ll talk to him. I’m so sorry you had to be put in such a position. I’m so sorry you had to learn it this way, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I’m alright. You shouldn’t have been caught in between, and I’m the one who fucked up big time here. Don’t worry please. Try not to think about it. We’ll continue this conversation another time, I’m sorry and can’t give you answers right now. don’t worry about Remus, I’ll handle him
She tried to be as gentle as she could bring herself to be, a busted lip was always a pain in the arse until it healed, for each single everyday thing would be painful. No more speaking, nor eating, nor sleeping, nor showering or else normally until the scar would disappear.
Evident, after all, there would be no way for Zabini, Parkinson and Nott to follow another skinny legend.
She only laughed at the remark and began to place her back against the wall to keep him company, “Does Dean know you squeak like a mouse?” she tried to stop laughing, but every time she calmed down, she remembered his shocked face as he had turned. Imagine a 187 centimetres tall sandy haired block getting all tense and losing control of his voice, what a thing to cherish forever.
“Yeah that was pretty much the big idea, as Ron already left with Hermione for another duty – he should be glad she’s patient enough to keep him company and follow him around, Jimmy has taken my place and Ginny has Luna and Nevs keeping her company. That makes me think, where is Thomas? I couldn’t find him all night long, and I pretty much physically roamed the room.”
“I’m so sorry you had to do all of this for me.” She cupped her nose and mouth in her hands and tried to frown her emotions away. Blaise, who had expected her to say this and knew her words didn’t apply only for the hard work they had invested these past days, grabbed her wrists and lowered them down her laps, forcing her to cross his gaze. He took a deep but gentle voice.
Suddenly, the global hubbub began to tune down and there was only whispers, gasps and questions rising from tables to tables. The first years looked lost and searched around for answers as if they would float in the air, not understanding the sudden commotion.
She’d state some person in her life genuinely cared about her but it didn’t mean she understood some of them were willing to physically carry out to actively improve her life.
“Hiya, honey! How are you doing! It’s been a while! I have so much to tell you, but you seem to have a lot to tell me as well, haha.” Her voice changed from enthusiastic to mischievous which had Fulvia lost for a minute.
, some sort of clubs’ presentations would take place, introducing clubs to be part of once the classes ended.
The two girls separated awkwardly and seemed both perplexed by the new voice joining them, dropping their heated argument. They identified the voice owner and grunted in harmony – Cormac and his lot.
“You’ll die not knowing what a dick look like. A shame for your dear father and his empire, your name’s ending with you.” She kept aiming at Malfoy’s face, as hard as she could even though a protection of arms block its access, “Or maybe I’m wrong, maybe he prefers them young and with a pure blood, way to keep it familial at home, am I right? You might enjoy yourself a lot with your daddy, huh?”
“Yeah, because it’s totally credible he took a hospital room for somebody else, for about two-three weeks, knowing he’s a cancer veteran, and as his charity never ends, he totally kept the bill for himself and didn’t tell us about financially sheltering a poor soul that might have to go through what he went through because he’s just like that. You’re right, that’s an acceptable answer, my bad.”
Fulvia's situation will be unpacked as well, i just want to be patient and not rushing it. Also this chapter was supposed to end later than that but I was hitting the 10k so I cut it.
The burning was only superficial but still, “I’m sorry Mari...” he said after a moment of silence as they both tried to recover from their burst of emotions, “I didn’t mean that, I-I never thought that you were the reason behind Sirius’s illness, I shouldn’t have-“
Her best friends had not missed her eyes unwillingly searching for someone in the course of the past few days.
They were out for the Hogsmeade weekly and official outing and wandered between the old shops and bookstores. They had split their usual group in two. Dean, Seamus, Neville, Luna and Ginny were helping the latter to finalise their “party” purchases while Hermione, Ron and Marigold were off to wonder aimlessly in old bookshops.
She couldn’t help the small feeling of awe for the... boldness and nerve of her sworn enemy who had just practiced the most badass parkour escape from a stage to a 13ft opened window in the wall, only leaning on few old stones.
Of course their almost certain victory was contested with people saying they regrouped more competences and, that some other clubs, more specific ones held fewer chances to win. But, hey, it was the game. She ignored the nasty comments and wandered with her friends among the presentations left once they were finished with rearranging their corridor part, carrying the last boxes.
“Ugh.” he ignored her and turn towards the rest of their group indicating with his eyes the exit, so they would leave without dwelling on Marigold’s heart break for too long in this place as she would rather feel better in their common room at least where she would be able to think out loud.
Also, Blaise is the only one allowed to tease Fulvia, like he can make her live hell if he wants but the minute someone else just even tries to annoy her, it's the end of the ride.
“Hm, I mean, yeah why not it’s not like they get any wiser when they age.” She caught a glimpse of Malfoy body shivering violently for one second.
“Well, on a worth scale, actually, yes,” answered Marigold with a bright and wry smile, turning toward the longer haired girl at her right, adding on a peace sign “I have self-esteem issues.”
“I’m sorry; it’s just that you’re a little gloomy since yesterday evening, for somebody who had a conversation with her godfather’s love muffin, I mean.”
“Yeah, of course. You don’t even have to ask, and you know it. Are you sure everything is alright?” her breathing sped up, her mind re-enacted all the things she’s done since he was there in the room with her. Maybe he had seen her arm, maybe there was blood on the bed sheets and she hadn’t noticed?
Some of the students tried to imitate the hot moves the duo had pulled out with the help of Marigold showing them.
“Yay, that’s great and all but what about my passions, my grades? Even my dorm?! Where will I sleep?? Do I have to agree on everything and letting my mouth shut?!” she was talking with more emotions that she ever shown in front of the head master, she began to stand on her right foot – saving her left one – putting her hands flat against the desk with a wild energy she couldn’t master anymore, “How can I accept to be treated as a beast, a plagued person?!
Feeling the warmth of it flood around her ankle that gradually rose as she’d put her other foot and leg before sitting entirely in was a relief she waited for days. She’d always make a little prayer to any goodness listening about her friends then would never forget to thank them for their help and kindness.
“Ron, do you ever listen?! I do not miss her!” she said abruptly, “I was just wondering what in the name of Dio Brando could have happen to her for not being at Hogwarts and show to everybody her stupid superiority,” she blurted out, “Plus I’m worrying because she didn’t post anything on her instagram page since the beginning of august. And-”
“None taken,” Marigold sheepishly answered with a bitter taste in her mouth, the coffee having nothing to do with it “come on, don’t stall, tell me what this meeting is really about, Moony.”
Hermione was a bit sceptical about their “peculiar” method to attract the attention of everybody in the hallways.
The duvet was back above her head but she felt a fresh breeze sliding around her feet. She flinched. A warm hand gently curled around her – good – ankle, tracing soothing circles on her malleolus. The circles were following a rhythm, somewhere in the distance she could hear a repetition a words going round and round again.
“She forgot her phone on her tray, again, so she’s looking for it.” Theodore answered, his eyes focused on his phone, one earphone in.
Her heart stopped on the spot. Her breath stopped as well. She could almost swear time stopped as well.
They had gotten tattooed on her fifteen birthday. It was easy to hide. She thought about the marks on the very same arm but higher,
Fulvia settled herself to get her breathing back to normal, her hand swiping away the sweat on her face. It didn’t feel like sweat on her hand, she knew this sensation too well. Her eyes stopped on her bloody fingers, she was trying to listen to her body and understand where it was coming from. Her body answered to her back and brought a sudden ringing pain on her eyebrow and in her nose. Her bad ankle made her wince as well, she might have had twisted it again somehow even though the ankle support was still there.
“Are you mental?! That’s it, fuck, you’ve gone mad!” she dangerously bent over the girl, now fully facing her “Yeah you’re wrong, fucking wrong. You’re not my friend, hell you’re no one! No need to fucking analyse me, I dress and cut my hair the way I want, I owe you nothing. There’s no need to associate me to a category or to put me in a box the simple second I walk away from the ‘perfect-princess’ path I’m supposed to take, okay?” her voice had now dropped to a dangerous, cool tone, the talk had unlashed most of her insecurities without the shorter girl knowing, “I’m avoiding you because you’re ruining the air I’m supposed to breath in, okay?” she pointed an accusatory finger to Marigold’s chest, “Last year proved that nothing good comes when one stays too close – even in the role of a girl your boyfriend tries to hit on or whatever – to you.”
It rang once, twice. She took several puffs of her cig. It rang again and again. She hung up. Tried again. Lit up another cigarette. Hung up again. On the fourth try she finally reached the other end of the line.
She scrolled through some other social networks, mindlessly liking a bunch of pictures when she fell across one that belonged to a certain model agency.
How could she even allow something to make her feel this way, wasn’t she master of her body and mind after all?
“MISS POTTER!!!” It was Flitwick who appeared to hoot the name of the girl for the last five minutes already.
Then she changed the subject. She didn’t feel like going on on this path without shattering in front of another person, it was the last thing she needed.
She had stayed in the water, apathetic, letting it cool down until freezing, repressing shivers, letting her fingertips to wrinkle, her mind blank.
She let one arms slip out of the cocoon of her duvet, feeling around to find something to soothe her anger and to lash out once and for all without hurting anyone.
A veil of sadness lodged in her heart, Mrs. Zabini knew the girl for a long time – she used to often shelter her – and was desolated by the fact no one deserved anything of what was happening to her at all.
The old man stayed still as his jaw clenched a little. He felt his heart sink in with compassion for the poor girl in front of him but tried to not express any of that because he knew better than to pity her; the young person was as always the embodiment of pride, even in this situation. He knew her pride was a protecting shield from the rest of the world but unfortunately only a thin layer remained now.
When she had finally gone out, she mechanically wrapped her body in a towel and attempted to swab the water away, rubbing her skin red.
“Ugh, stop smiling like that it’s creepy. Whatever.” She closed the door for good, discarded her clothes to enter the shower/bath and turned on the water valve to ‘hellish-very-hot-almost-scalding-skin-i-am-sure-we-can-blaunch-vegetables-at-this-point’ warmth.
She waited for the young girl to lock her pale grey eyes, redden by the crying, in hers and added, “You know, I could stay here with you tonight-”
“Hey guys, what’s up? Who made a really bad pun?!” taking his professional voice and a serious look Neville added “With the look on your face Mari, I can tell it’s at least a six out of eight on the bad-meme-lord-pun scale. And more importantly who’s the terrorist?”
She waited for everybody in the audience to picture her words before breaking the enticing landscape, “but then, out of nowhere, a mugger comes and tries to steal my things.”
She’d reached the half of it when she heard the footsteps, but had only turned her head from the window at the exasperated sound escaping from the incoming person.
“What?! Are you for real now? Mate, I was telling you. I found it in a pile of clothes, I had no idea. What it is to you, you’re probably even the one to have forget it there. You don’t understand how fast I rushed down here not to miss lunch. There was no point looking for my own clothes??”
Facing the main door, a large window with a seat took almost the entire last wall. Apart from some empty shelves, library and other pieces of furniture, the space constituted Fulvia’s new bedroom, and it was by far one of the largest room she’d ever seen in the castle for a single individual.
Fortunately, the head master chose this moment to make a public announcement, giving Fulvia enough to pull her act together and, once everything in her vision was steady again, she plainly fled from the room without being followed by Blaise, Pansy or Theo. She needed some alone-time; they were kind and respectful enough to understand that.
“Yes exactly, I’ve seen you, I watched you – gosh that’s creepy sorry” Fulvia only snorted “– anyway my point is I also noticed a change in your behaviour, not specifically towards me, but in general. It’s like you’ve shut yourself in or, I don’t know how to say it properly but you get what I mean. And I was wondering if it was because you experienced some inconvenience with your... body?”
The look on the taller girl’s face seemed unimpressed by her soliloquy so she pursued, “Look, it won’t be long, I promise. I just- ughh, it just occurred to me – well,” she clicked her tongue, her hands messing up her hair “I couldn’t help but notice you had been through some... changes of appearance per say.”
She went to the castle’s entrance, took a taxi to Hogsmeade’s station, then the train back to the King’s cross’s one and, several hours later, reached the car of Blaise’s mother who was waiting for her to come back home. All of that while her brain was processing the shitty day she just had, listening to music her earphones deep down in her hears.
Fights between their own friends group and Potter’s one were really a weekly event since their very first year attending this school, from just loud words to throwing hands in the middle of the corridors. Generally it happened between periods and on a basis of 1v1 but it also happened by the past, when it involved Cormac, Potter and Fulvia for example, that more people found themselves in the middle of a fight.
Some Gryffindors joined their spot, including Luna, glued to Ginny as always, so they changed the subject, knowing the disapproval of this latter.
She felt numb, letting herself get lulled by the new serenity in her mind and fell asleep ignoring the ringing stinging on her arm.
“No, no I swear it’s like, cute on you, like maybe there’s less tongue or less teeth, or both, but it’s cute, really. Just well, it gives you away easily,” He was piling up all the things that he had taken out of the chest and once gathered he put everything back in the piece of furniture, “anyway, they started to talk to the ballet teacher and tried to find out why Malfoy was no longer signed up in the list club, they really pretended to care and to be deeply affected, those fake bastards.” He laughed at the memory.
“You sure have analysed her,” Blaise scoffed, glad to know that the Potter-topic was still something that gave life to his best friend, “that’s surprising for somebody who despise her so much as you do, huh.”
“No, it’s perfect. Thanks again! I need to unpack for good. Let me treat you for something next time in Hogsmeade. That would be the least I could do.”
“J’en ai marre que l’on me mette tous les malheurs du monde sur le dos ! Je ne demande pas la lune, je veux juste pouvoir vivre une vie d’adolescente normale sans avoir à vous gérer émotionnellement, vous êtes sensé être les adultes dans cette situation, mais là, je ne vois qu’un peureux qui préfère rabattre ses frustrations et la raison de la maladie de Sirius sur moi et un autre individu incapable d’affronter une horrible vérité de plus. C’est vous les adultes, putain, gérez-vous pas pitié ! ”
Marigold didn’t acknowledge them and turned back to a Dean struggling with belts, mesh tops and harnesses, “Girl, that’s a mess, I can’t find anything, why is everything mixed together like that?” he seemed distraught and in a rush.
Blaise scoffed while Fulvia eyeballed him, visibly disconcerted. Pansy’s eyes left the screen of her phone for a hot second, “You follow her?
“Will- err, will you join us tonight for dinner?” she had turned around, knowing how of an over thinker Marigold could be
Then, she had let her manager down. So, what. She had done worse in the past few months. He would find something to make it work, she knew it. He always did. Else he could just break her contract and end everything, saying goodbye to her last steady financial support as a minor.
As for Marigold, her work shifts didn’t bother school schedule at all for it was essentially night shifts and she was pretty well paid – and her school fees were handled by her godfather.
gently, she would convince her brain to just, turn off or something, so she wouldn’t have to witness the shitty mess that was her life anymore.
After that, she would take her time removing the water from her body with a towel; softly brushing her skin with it, almost becoming caresses, fondles – way to pamper herself.
McLaggen let her get to the center of the stage, his eyes shamelessly glued on her arse. Fulvia rolled her eyes; she didn’t know which one was the most ridiculous between the two of them.
“One minute you’re destroying your ex-girlfriend and the very next you’re hitting on me! And so you know, just because she won’t cover her face under I don’t know how many layer of concealer or something else, doesn’t mean you can act like she’s trash. At least, pretend to have a bit of respect for a fellow woman when you talk to one. That’s the basic decency of humanity.”
“Are you kidding?!” Pansy erupted in the exchange, after taking a small drag she kept going with a nasal voice, “Don’t thank us, we looked so fucking cool, we were like the fucking Matrix cast!” she released the smoke by her nostrils.
“I know you fancy me. I’ve been noticing your glances all that time back when I was with Mari. And tonight you even came for me. Now I’m free, we’ve I broke up remember – I always suspected that it was what stopped you. I took care of it because I even have the kindness to play by your rules. Just so you know; I could have handled you both at the same time.”
She took back her purse, slipped her feet in some sneaker her friends had threw besides her, passed the strap on her shoulder and turned towards the crow, “See you on Monday practice!”
At that, all the heads but Marigold’s turned to Dean, intrigued by what the dark skinned boy had just said. She just laughed at the nick name that brought back memories. The boy explained to the other Gryffindors present on the couches and armchairs that the name was an invention from both Marigold’s and his during their work time, outside school.
Said girl was now nowhere to be seen, and the student that had helped with the demonstration was now doing push-ups from his former position as to show a method of exercising, clenching the fabric of the dress and sponged himself with it as he would with a towel.
Crabbe stepped forwards but Goyle caught his arm, holding both of them now, and glared at her, “That would give her too much satisfaction...”
Those very eyes were now focused, analysing something – Fulvia’s hair for sure – squinting behind round thin glasses.
Unfortunately, the past few weeks had showed her how miserable she could bring herself to be. She accounted all the people that had helped her, the list was dreadfully long. So, still in Hydra Lucy “Fulvia” Malfoy’s perspective, being defended by the golden girl, on top of all of it, was kinda the most effective thing to happen if she needed her day – even her week – ruined.
Theodore Nott was another matter, he was more of a true-lone-wolf and he usually came and went with the three Slytherins, not that she cared.
“Don’t say that. I told you plenty of times; you never overreact, it’s just you gotta work on the communication skills afterwards reacting to the situation. I’m sorry and messed up and stressed you out, it’s just that right now, I’m... I don’t know. It’s hard.”
An uncomfortable silence followed. Dumbledore had an impish expression, implying he yet waited for Fulvia to carry on, except she didn’t know what it was about. The feeling of awkwardness grew more and more.
“You know what, ladies? If Seamus or Neville or even Dean were here, they would agree with me. It’s just so unfair I’m the only man here and-” he caught three pairs of eyes glaring at him, only Luna was too busy arranging and picking at her food.
“Yeah, bullshitting award goes to him without any doubt. But anyway, we were both equally fooled by his act this summer. I mean, the fact he was away for work didn’t help but, hey.”
“Oh, okay thanks, I did too much, then, I think. Never mind,” she checked her texts on her phone, she lifted her head and smiled at Hermione, “Sure, I’ll just go and get my business done with Patil and Brown. You can leave it on my bed or my bed side table; I’ll read it before sleeping.”
One boy advanced towards her, balancing himself by putting his elbow on McLaggen’s shoulder, a threateningly dirty expression covering his face, “That’s not what we said, and know it’s not the first time people refer to you this way. Better get used pretty quickly because loads of people won’t consider not hurting your feeling anymore. Also I can try and convert you to the right path” He hinted her lower body and winked.
“Ow come on, I’m talking in your place because it also infuriates me when she’s showing her angel side when half the castle knows she also can be such a dick.”
“Well, if you were my friend as much as you say, you’d trust me for my actions and beliefs, I don’t ask for a lot but really, I’m telling you this one last time, if you want what’s good for you, ditch her or you’ll regret it sooner or later.”
Here are the statements she could make: said club was the athletics, regrouping the ‘Slug Club’ track team as she recognised its members; there wasn’t any professor as supervisor/chaperon which was weird after attracting so much students and being far from the other clubs.
He described how all the students were expected to be in the hallways, where booths/sites showing would take place, and chose a new school option for the year. The presentation took ten solid minutes, which was a torture for the bespectacled girl who wanted so badly to explain herself to a certain white-blonde haired girl. The old professor sure took his time and when he was done, there wasn’t any track of a wild Malfoy in sight. She looked everywhere in vain; the white-blond girl was gone.
“-and I tell you, I’d never seen Blaise run so fast in my life.” Justin could barely get the sentence out without howling with laughter.
“You offered to buy me lunch last night, somewhere in the middle of you fawning over Anthony Goldstein and embarrassing yourself in front of Harry Potter.”
The Auror’s thin-lipped smile did not budge, “I understand. It’s a bigger project than you were expecting, I’m sure. How about you come in on Monday to tell me your decision. Is that enough time for you?”
The fact of the matter was that he had sworn to himself, many years ago, that had he ever come across Harry again, he would look the other way. It had been too long, too
“Good afternoon.” Draco entered, wielding a wary glance as he realized that behind Robards’ office door, revealed a red-faced Weasley conversing with the Head Auror about some private matter, “I apologize for my unannounced visit.”
Hi friends! I've been through the ringer these last few months, struggling with health concerns and financial issues but since this COVID-19 business is still running rampant where I live, I have plenty more time to write than ever before. I will be trying to update semi-regularly, though I ask you all to be patient with me since life always has a way of messing things up. I hope you're all staying safe and healthy! Xoxo
“It’s not spying,” he whispered to himself, burying his face into the Guiness that sat on the bar in front of him, “it’s mere curiosity.”
After that, a moment of silence ensued where neither one of them knew what to say next. It lasted for nearly a minute until Pansy hesitantly took her leave, with a promise at her lips to meet up again soon. He hoped she meant it.
As Draco entered the Manor once more, he hesitated to tell his mother the truth behind his departure.
“Thank you for the wand,” Draco’s eyes were downcast, as he shoved the wand into his back pocket, “but I must be going.”
“Well, Crabbe is dead, Goyle has fallen off the face of the Earth, Blaise is always busy with work, Millicent barely talks to anybody, and I haven’t kept in contact with Theodore much.”
One particular painting caught Draco’s eye, though he couldn’t read Dutch so the title of it was lost upon him, “I suspect he’s trying to throw us off of his trail.”
Narcissa blinked, face unchanging, “My dear, we’ve plenty of money. You’re still the sole Malfoy heir, whether you marry or not.”
“Pansy was just telling me about your job. You work for the Ministry? I’m surprised we hadn’t run into each other sooner.” Draco was too drunk to tell, but it almost looked like he shifted his chair closer, while Pansy turned around to chat with Millicent.
Robards shook his head, “As you heard from Auror Weasley earlier today, the trail went cold. We’re looking for new leads currently.”
Robards gave a short, half-suppressed laugh at Draco’s fascination, “Interested, are you? That is the Candle of Reflection. It mimics whoever stares into the flame’s emotions. Some reports say it gives insight into the future, but...well, most who’ve come into contact with it burn to death instantly, so it’s unconfirmed.”
Narcissa waited for him to continue, but when he did not, she realized it was of a serious nature, “Come. Join me in the parlour.”
“Not to play devil’s advocate,” Weasley started, “but I’d say he certainly is different from how he was in school. He may still be a bit of a prat, but he seems more disciplined now.”
She snickered as he felt a small thump on the bed and turned minutely to see a small vial had been thrown on his pillow.
His vision had begun to get blurry as they filled with tears. He’d never seen such vibrant, green eyes before. Draco thought he could get lost in them, forever basking in that endless pool of emerald.
To his right, he could hear Blaise giggling to himself through the tunnels until they eventually found sunlight once more. Even after, Draco could hear Blaise mutter the word under his breath every so often before dissolving into a fit of laughter. Already, Draco dreaded coming along.
Walking back to his flat, he enjoyed the pleasant summer weather, and even smiled at his neighbors who passed him, walking their dogs, or going for a jog. He had been in such a good mood, he almost started humming. That is, of course, until he reached his door to find a letter stuck underneath.
“The perimeter is secured, there’s no sign of him anywhere.” Potter huffed under his breath, looking dangerously tired due to the large bags under his eyes.
He expected this question. While he wanted to be as honest with Robards as he could, he couldn’t possibly tell him everything, “No, not for a while now. My mother is the only one who receives word from him, but he never mentions his location.”
“The night is young, Zabini, it might not be the last time you’re in there,” Pansy shouted before flinging the door open and throwing herself into the much taller man’s arms.
“You should’ve seen what I was like in sixth year,” Draco realized he was falling out of his chair, and leaned on Anthony for support, “especially in the Slytherin dormitories.”
This chapter took me a super long time to write because I ended up changing a bunch of things. I mentioned this before, but this story is a slow burn!!! There will be a happy ending (eventually), but i've barely scratched the surface of what this story is about, so please bear with me. I'm thankful to all those who've sent me nice messages about the story, and I promise I will continue updating this and my other story (Dandelion Prophet), as much as possible. With the holidays coming up, I have some days off so I will spend those days writing as much as I can. Have a great rest of your week, everyone!!!!
His bedroom door slammed open and he could hear Mittens’ bell jingling like mad as he ran as far away from the insane woman in Draco’s doorway.
Draco found himself zoning out of their conversation. Blaise was many things – arrogant at times, a bit selfish, and often quite pompous, but he was never a Death Eater, nor was anyone in his family, which is likely the reason he had decided to undergo Auror training after the war had ended. Despite him being enthusiastic, and pretty damn good at his job, the fact that he was a Slytherin and hadn’t fought on either side during the war meant his training was prolonged, unlike certain Gryffindors who were practically handed job offers.
The group roared with laughter – even Draco couldn’t help the thundering laughter that crawled out of him. Millicent, despite looking mildly offended, giggled at the memory.
He looked around the room, watching as those around him wielded the same expression of mixed surprise and playfulness. All except for Harry, whose eyes stayed trained on his drink. To his right, he felt Pansy pour him another shot of Firewhiskey, before bringing it to his lips, yet his eyes never left Harry, who refused to look at him. Even Neville and Justin, who he hadn't had much chance to talk to yet, smiled at him as if it had just been announced he and Anthony were newly engaged. Draco didn’t know what to make of it.
They talked for more or less half an hour, mostly about Pansy’s journeys and casual chatter about how much has changed for the both of them. One thing they didn’t talk about was the war. It was a delicate subject for both, for obvious reasons, but he could tell that for Pansy, being back in London was making her antsy. He noticed how every time the tiny bell on the door chimed, she would turn her head minutely, as if he would not notice.
Draco felt sick to his stomach. He couldn’t bear to listen to anymore. He got up to leave when he heard Potter speak.
He hated remembering. Yet, every time he tried to forget, he relived it in his dreams. As time passed and the weeks turned into months, Draco realized he couldn’t live without his mother in his life, and so he did his best to visit every so often. Not soon after his departure from the Manor, Lucius left on his own as well to “save their family”, never staying in one place for too long before moving to some other location, likely staying at one of their many estates abroad.
Anthony, who Draco had noticed hadn’t removed his arm from his shoulder, moved a bit closer, as if he was trying to hold himself up, despite sitting on a stool. Anthony really
“Just in here,” Harry propped the door open, before rushing ahead into some hidden room down a hallway.
he was. It was the first time in a long time that he allowed these thoughts to creep in - when days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, and he lived alone, unfeeling and uncaring about the world. Despite the fact that he was in a room filled with people, he felt the loneliness seep into him until he forced the drink in his hand to drown out the thoughts.
“Nice robes,” Draco commented, briefly looking at his new colleague before turning his attention back to the Time-Turner.
“How did you know where I lived?” Draco asked, afraid of the possible answer burning in his mind. The blurry memory of being tucked into his silk sheets by an unknown, warm body terrified him.
“Shh!” Draco hissed at him, noticing how quiet their footsteps were as they entered the cavern - as if they were the only ones there.
The length of the legs gave it away the most, Marigold knew few to one person only on earth with such long limbs, and the fair-ivory skin also was a good hint. But what could have been odd then for Marigold to not recognise Malfoy at first glance?
“I’m gonna get better, I promise. I’ll take an appointment soon don’t worry,” she pulled at his hand and brought him in a strong embrace, “I know you’re here for as long as I need and the same goes for me. I’m here for you when you need me and as long as you want,” she whispered, “We’re immortal together.” She was facing the entangled snake on her arm and thought about his very own; their link through life and death, linked to their souls, their Ouroboros.
Potter was not the only one who had noticed how Fulvia avoided confrontations since her return. Not that it was bad, per se, just weird, uncanny.
“No- that’s not what I meant...” Marigtold took a deep breath before stuttering and blurting out her thoughts, her hands still in her hair, “what I meant is – don’t get me wrong, usually I don’t listen to student’s gossip that much but there was a lot of hearsays about you – y-your new haircut, your new ‘even-colder-than-before’ attitude, the way you behave once out of the gates of the castle, the- the way you dress outside school even. And you smoke now?” She was referring to this later afternoon, when she had saw her wearing the unusual casual outfit, “The fact you stopped taking ballet classes, your late arrival to school, your ankle, and the way you got skinnier... People talk. I- I couldn’t help but wonder what could have happen to you and one thing leading to another I came to the conclusion – correct me if I’m wrong – that you might have experienced some sort of discomfort, disphoria with your body and that – maybe – you were... gosh okay... transitioning. And the reason you acted different towards me, I mean the way you didn’t provoked me anymore, or didn’t started arguments and all was that you were afraid for me to find out, which I still pretty much did by the way, and then I could use it against you when we’d fight? But I want you to know that I would never do anything like that. What you’re going through is valid, you are valid and I would never even think about using it as an argument against you, ever. So I just wanted to tell you that, yeah.” She ended her speech with a timid and hopeful satisfied smile on her lips thinking how she finally had the guts to say what had been on her mind for the past hours.
Two things happened at that given moment as both Ron and she saw who was in front of them, but with a different quality of sight and interest, and thus saying that it hit them both differently was a euphemism.
“Sevs, I’m alright, there’s no need to-” she tried to escape from the affectionate grip and he hesitantly let go. She tried a confident smile but his brows were still knotted in a frown as he inspected her, his lips forming a thin line.
Her aunt remained silent until now, she cut Fulvia’s sentence with a cuss as she took in all the information.
But this time, words had failed him. Now he was just repeating a litany of “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.”
The temporary disabled girl had tried to avoid meeting other human beings all morning long, now she had to bump into one and it had to be fucking Potter.
“Yeah, yeah mate all of that is him, no need to waste time reciting his biography. So you see him too? That’s reassuring. I was so sure I dreamt him as I never saw him around after our first encounter. I’m so relived now, OMG you can’t even imagine how happy I am right now.”
“You’re at it again uh? Talking about how she stole ‘your man’ and how it is unfair for your poor little existence.” Ginny had no mercy on the girl when it came to the so called ‘Fulviarigold’ subject.
Fuck. She needed the money. Fuck. She needed to find a lawyer. Fuck. She needed to call her aunt. Fuck. She needed to get out of her life.
Anyway today wasn’t a good day to take pictures, nor was it a good day at all, nor a good week. Getting ignored by Malfoy was surprisingly more tiresome that she’d ever have imagined, even if it was only for a day. The sudden change in interest the other girl lack to give her was wrecking the cogwheels in her brain.
“Oh, because I’m still wanted there? I thought I wasn’t good enough for you and couldn’t bother to show my face sorry, champ’”
Once she felt better she removed her duvet for good and met the worried face of her best friend, “Hey, good to have you back.” He smiled.
Looking a bit to the left of the room, she noticed that Ginny and Luna were also here with the two of them, sitting on Hermione’s bed. Luna braiding Ginny’s hair while this latter looked at her phone, expressionless but for a slight reddish coloration around her cheeks.
“I know, and I knew why you were acting like that. But I was expecting more from you, out of all people, to have the maturity to come talk to me instead of literally barking at me for two weeks straight!”
“Hi, sweetheart, it’s been a while and you’ve been hard to get. How are you? How’s the house, are you back to school, how was your summer? Fuck, where’s that contract again?” some papers flew off his desk, “Anyway, I just wanted to call you because we’ve been contacted by this very brand of- OH MY FUCKING SWEET GOOD LORD WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!”
He kept bothering her with filthy mental images, clamming it was pure revenge for all the times she tried to mind both the boys’ business as she desperately tried to cover her ears, giggling. But eventually, one student broke a glass as a sudden agitation was heard and there were a lot of shatters on the floor.
To this day, she’d never understood the white-blond girl’s reaction to this incident and didn’t try to look to deep into it.
He had watched her being tormented by her thoughts and that’s why he had said, “Don’t you worry about their opinions and make sure to always keep your head
“See, Goyle, I’d love to exchange with you about the relativity of time because I’m sure I bumped into you few days ago, but unfortunately I have places to be. So, if you’ll excuse me...” she tried a polite smile.
A fifth year was assuring Malfoy had left Hogwarts for good, whereas a sixth year swore she could sense Malfoy’s ghost every night in their common room hunting down the ones who didn’t behave properly and shamed the name of the Slytherin house. But what struck the brunette the most was what a boy had said – he should know, his father work at the Foreign Office with Malfoy’s father – something about Malfoy losing some of her hair and that he didn’t know the reason of it. She imagined for a second the untouchable white-blonde girl finally reaching the human level of stress and losing hair from it.
Not hesitating more, Marigold violently spun her body toward the Slytherins’ side of the room and couldn’t help but being shocked by the sight.
In the first one, she stood up, Sirius holding her hands, facing each other, looking up to him and him facing down with some strand of hair falling in his face from his messy bun. Both of them looked very pleased with the other. He seemed so young.
“So now Malfoy is dead and in front of us was either a cousin of her that weirdly looks like her or she has been replaced by someone else, thus, in this case, she automatically joins Avril Lavigne in the stars’ cryptid team doubled by clones.” She blurted in an emotionless voice, interrupting the conversation.
Somehow, it suited her, well more than would a bob cut have but, anyway, that wasn’t the point and she didn’t bother acknowledging this thoughts of hers.
Just like with Fulvia, Theo was the one who could handle her furry just fine, “What happened, princess?” the nickname was originally ironic but stayed as the years passed.
Marigold settled for shoving her earbuds further down her ears, hiding a smile as she tried to concentrate her attention back on her paper. Ginny gasped, falsely offended, “Hermione, you’re my last hope, please slap him for me, I’m too far and can’t even reach his spaghetti legs!”
She false-innocently answered, “Oh, so if I go to McGonagall’s office, like right now, and complain about the sexual harassment some of the girl students were subjected to, you’ll see no problem against that, right?!”
hand tried to grab one of her wrists; she did her best to attempt and repress a shriek. She wouldn’t give
She’d never asked for it – to be heartless – and she didn’t want to put all the blame on her education because she knew one could change but she’d never intended to, too much effort for nothing really satisfying enough at the end of the day. And it had been enough until now, not caring about other people and their feelings.
“HAH!! I knew it!” Marigold pointed at Ron who was purposely escaping from Hermione’s rebuking gaze while reluctantly giving a purple note to his best friend.
“So you see her too, right?” her tone was flat, “My eyes aren’t messing about with my brain? It’s not a bloody joke from fate isn’t it? Ron punch me please, I wanna be sure.” She turned towards him, a desperate grimace showing on her face.
Unfortunately for her recent blood thirst, the allusion to Remus flew over Marigold’s head, she focused on the other part of the accusation instead, “Pshhhht it’s not even- ha! I don’t even know what you’re- how could you- YOU are making nonsense!” she tried to point at the white-blonde with an accusatory finger in turn but couldn’t seem to aim at her. Maybe her vision WAS a little blurrier than usually.
She’d chuckled at this and it had the effect to definitely chase the tears menacing to appear. Once they’d broken apart from their warm reunion Blaise had taken Fulvia’s bags and had put them in the boot while she’d installed to the passenger seat and had waited for Blaise to turn on the engine.
“Oh please, choke on your own dick Weasley! My head still hurts so if you could shut it for like, the rest of my life that would mean a lot to me. Thanks sweetheart.”
“Oh come on Mari, an entire year of school without the Fulviarigold drama would have killed you out of boredom, admit it.”
She got out of the comfy warmth of her bed and squatted down around the pile of mess Dean had made, “I’m not cleaning that up when we’re done.”
In retrospect, it had never been like that when she still was with Cormac, nor even near this state of smug happiness.
Marigold didn’t want to admit the fact she was now more than interested in the rest of the story, but with Dean’s last remark she was too prideful to sound eager for the next part of his gossips. But as soon as he talked, she regretted not saying anything.
On the same wall the entrance was in, there were a massive angle desk and then a library closing the space in a U shape extending one of the alcove walls and shielding the bed space from the entrance point of view. Again, reassuring and comforting enough in a way.
Marigold scoffed despite her best efforts, “No, excuse me. You’re right, go on.” Her smile wasn’t very enthusiast and encouraging.
Oh, she remembered now, “Also, if you need me to repay you for any fees for the room or/and the pieces of furniture I ca-”
She silenced her phone by putting the ‘do not disturb’ mode after her last text, laid down her phone on the nightstand and adjusted her body in the no longer cool sheets.
But unfortunately, she couldn’t risk breaking her mask. Breaking down and let out all her bottled up emotions would associate her as a hysterical human being and she wouldn’t – she couldn’t – allow that.
The look in Seamus’s eyes was sheer admiration, adoration even, he looked so proud. And Dean. Dean looked so loved, in love, happy and complete, right now in his boyfriend’s arms. They looked so whole and alive even they moved to a slow pace.
That’s when she caught the sight of a dark isolated dot clashing with the white wall. Her feet simply and automatically took the lead, judging it was distraction enough, and she just had the time to wipe the threatening tears away and smudging her make up before finding herself at the side of Malfoy that was scornfully eying the crowd, her back leaning against the immaculate white wall.
This first Friday night – Saturday morning in fact – of school was the beginning of a promising yet completely altered year, but she did not know that as she was dreaming of her dark-and-not-so-polite-mysterious-lover.
“So we can say that you fell... for them...” said Seamus with a wide smug smile while he was putting Marigold’s glasses on his nose, Ron and Dean imitated a rock band scream
“No, thank you.” She got up as graciously as she could, adjusting and brushing her clothes off. She saw Potter in the corner of her eyes picking up both her glasses and her phone before attempting to untangle her fur of a hair where the flowers had fallen. She couldn’t put her glasses back for now, the bridge of her nose was still bleeding.
confessed to me and as I know you’re in communication with a lot of lawyers, I wondered if you knew someone to help us, him, out for this situation? What are the steps and the means needed?”
As she’d checked her phone she’d got rid of her ankle support and opened her legs so the blood could rush back in them.
Still in the nest of her warm blankets, she checked her phone, thinking of the delicious cappuccino she would drink for breakfast with something to fill up her hurting tummy.
She emitted a silent snort, “Breaking news, my hairstyle doesn’t speak for my sexual orientation, welcome to the twenty first century guys.”
She was free to come and go but remained extremely careful not being seen when she had to leave the school because of the prefects, but their guard duties ended before her return anyway.
There will be in few chapter, I think, an explanatory of Marigold's youth and education, to show how were Remus and Sirius around and her and other people too!
Maybe she could hire someone on the dark web to shoot her, or just drown in the Great Lake, hoping they wouldn’t find her corpse before ages.
Her ankle throbbed, her chest tightened, her look was distraught, she couldn’t see nor feel clearly what was happening around her.
She stayed silent after that for a while, looking at her plate, waiting for the murmurs to fill back the hall.
Said useless brain started on its own a top 10 of the happiest moments she had lived with Cormac as she walked errand in the room, quickly followed with the worst ones. She forgot how it was to be sad-drunk. She desperately needed a distraction; else the pearls that peacefully hung at the edge of her eyes for now would dramatically fall down her cheeks for hours.
“Fuck, you totally met someone!” exclaimed the dark skinned boy, rising from his seat in excitement. Now, everybody around the table was focused on the next word the jet-black haired girl would pronounce.
He sat next to Marigold, also taking a plate of food. “I was in the greenhouses... taking care of the plants... kinda...” he smiled awkwardly at Marigold, her eyes dripping pure malice at the information.
“Yesss, thanks, babe. And like, I don’t know, even the bitchy girls from year 5 were not has bitchy. It’s frightening how much a single person can hold- ah thanks –the pressure in a room. I swear- oh do you have the same ones in purple and gold please? –I even heard some people laughing. Well, not laughing but- ah perfect, you’re a life saver, love –I’m sure they were chuckling at least, and I’ve never ever heard anybody chuckle in the studio.”
“Uh?” Marigold was taken aback by the turn of the conversation, but quickly followed, “First of all, you witness a lot of my glorious moments for someone who tries to avoid me at any cost, and FYI, I radiate self-confidence every step that I take okay?!”
Marigold was head of the track team. Ron and Ginny were part of said team while Seamus was in another athletic field. They saw each other very often.
The very first one, on the other hand, represented a family tradition, her mother. It used to carry love and tenderness. But she would always remember the look of terror, the lack of understanding, the pity in her mother eyes when she had said her name for the very last time two years ago.
The boy was no longer sitting down nor was he no longer smoking. He had tossed his cigarette butt away and he was now agitatedly chatting with his friend that had just came out from the little shop and that was none other than Zabini.
“As you could have done something more once being aware of the situation! And I remind you that we don’t know if the room was for him-“she began to rant.
She’d tried to discipline her hair. With the new haircut she couldn’t do much; it was longer on the top and bend to one side and this very side began to curl into thin waves. She would have to find a way to tame it once at Hogwarts. She would look it up later, something like how to have a professional undercut look... or something.
Anyway, the students around them had already formed a sort of circle, both dancing and watching from afar what the duo could offer with all the perfect and synchronised spins and the hips swings they performed, the public gave loud cheering and appreciation of what they were witnessing.
It was no emotion at all in fact; she could give an identity to what she felt, as a person, as an entity; a shadow lurking, hovering at all time over her frame.
Blaise winced at that and threw him a death glare, silently writing his friend’s eulogy in his head.
like maybe you didn’t told me because of idk, things but like at least you would have told him you know because he’s your lover and you’re both adults and he was with you all this time when it happened before
The annoying taping sound of the antic computer keyboard somewhere around the register was growing louder and louder on Marigold. Ron wouldn’t stop asking questions about Remus’s discussion with her, which she didn’t intend to share. Said discussion also had contributed to nourish her anger since the previous evening, making her more and more irascible as hours passed.
She lost track of time and space. How long had she been doing this for? She didn’t know, she didn’t care.
The following week went by and Marigold didn’t rest at all, still her schedule was balanced. It was like 14% of track practice, 7% organising the next week soon-to-be-party – aka when her team would defo win – with buying all for the virgin cocktails and decorations and managing playlists, 13% procrastinating on her homework, 8% failing her chemistry class, 10% nailing her French and optional French classes, 6% following her general classes, 9% arguing more or less loudly with Ron and Seamus about some dumb memes in Hermione’s opinion, and of course, 33% deafening 24/7 her friends talking about her new crush and looking for him in the Great Hall or in the corridors.
Malfoy, who had been taken aback until now in front of such a disproportionate reaction to their casual bumping into each other, leaned in and twisted her face into a threatening smile, “Or what, what you gonna do? Nothing, you’re too afraid your little favourite professor Lupin will tell you off. What a pair of lunatics you both are, just need to see who he’s married to, to understand something is clearly wrong with him and then you came along and they had to raise you. Poor all of you, that’s why, personally, I don’t blame you too hard for your foul words; you’re just coming from the wrong side of the Black family. Sorry we don’t share the good things with the plebe.”
He still hadn’t responded after the threat. She’d shrugged it off and went for preparing herself before the daily RE at 11:30am.
The new boy might have wanted Zabini to pass him something, but anyway, the Slytherin dark-skinned boy had say it, and Marigold never hopped in her life for somebody to be more wrong.
“Sorry, didn’t mean it,” she impishly answered to which the professor deeply sighed in disapprobation.
There was a narrow path between two full bookshelves with a narrower staircase, turning few times before the last steps stopped to a dark wooden door.
Contrary to what she had expected for being near the Slytherin’s CR, the room was very luminous. Actually it was all about white, but not hospital-white-like, it was warm and reassuring thanks to the large window were she could see the sun rising and the light drowning the room, just above the lake, the only Slytherin place above the lake to be exact.
“Yeah, on my way back from Dumbledore I grabbed a sandwich in Sevs’s rooms. He wasn’t there though; but I left a note.”
Blaise was discreetly trying to slide a plate under her nose; she discreetly tried to stop him. She’d nonchalantly put down her hands in front of her so no room was left for him to place anything. But somehow, with one hand, he discreetly pinched at her ribcage and she was forced to give away, and with his other hand, he casually put down food on the now free space. They were stealthy enough nobody noticed what was going on.
“Again, the extra room was integrally paid by Mr. Malfoy, along the school fees. And this, for the whole year, there is nothing like ‘refund’ possible on this part. So, whatever needs to be done,” his tone grew warmer, reaching to take the young girl’s hand lying on the desk, “you’ll always have a shelter here, for this year at least, until it is time to figure future out. That is why I think it wise to act as soon as you’re ready. Dumbledore told me you wanted to emancipate your bank account. Sounds to me like he won’t be able to impact on this side after doing that.”
“Ha ha, I’m so dead right now,” she responded, deadpan “no, more seriously, my ego is still there but I had to negotiate with her for that.”
The others had just watched in silence, letting the two get their usually heated argument of the day, but it was dangerously drifting towards a more serious tone.
She rolled her eyes and hardened her tone, “Fear not,” she smiled falsely warmly, “you can also go fuck yourself McLaggen. Mind your own shit, I’m not missing any sort of your fragile masculinity, try somewhere else.”
She proceeded to clean the small wound pretty gently but had to step closer has she still hadn’t put her glasses back on. Fulvia tensed as she could feel Potter’s breath on her face. She then wiped off the smeared blood coming from Fulvia’s nose, “There! Perfect enough to do the Vogue cover, princess,” she grabbed Fulvia’s hands to clean the bloody knuckles next.
After a long week of boring classes and hard homework, it was all she could dream of. She would lay down a bit, letting the foam covering her up to her chin, the liquid diffusing heat as she let herself dive gently in a slow process that helped relax her muscles.
but more srsly whats his fucking prblm w/ you like dude chill this perfect girl is your only child. i can’t believe he’s acting like that towards you. i always had kinda respect for him like the strict minimum required because he made gold-and-pure-creature aka you, but you’re right fuck him. how come he can even ask that ?! don’t tell me Gandalf approved!!!
“I- You know it’s something I’m working on! Listen, I’m sorry, I was scared fir myself and I overreacted.”
The old man she faced wasn’t disturbed by the severe tone the young woman just used on him, or at least didn’t act like it. At the contrary he felt sorry for her.
Cormac had humiliated Marigold as he had tried to cheat on her with a lot of girls. Back then some of them went to tell her but she simply wouldn’t even listen to them, she was in denial, he couldn’t be doing that to her. Of course she saw he wasn’t caring about her as much as she cared about him, but they had been together during the end of the fifth year and the whole sixth year – seventh year for him.
Fulvia never ever complained before of the attention she could be given, at the contrary she even craved for it somehow.
The other picture must have been taken shortly after, both of them were on a bed, but there was also Remus in this one. He had one knee on the bed, holding Sirius’s shoulders as this latter held Remus’s head and they shared a tender chaste kiss. Marigold was still in Sirius’s laps and was playing with Remus’s tie, falling down around her face.
“And what if I am, ridiculous I mean, since when do I care about people’s opinions.” She spited, keeping purposely the same low voice her friend had employed.
“Hey, it’s okay, Sevs. I’m not blaming you for anything that happened, and your help is more than welcome and you’ve already done so much. I’m just not ready right now to seriously think about...” she gestured vaguely at her loss of words, “all this.”
“Oh dear lords! Dude, you’re seeing that?! It isn’t my imagination, right? Because I have good reasons to think that he might be my future husband, you know the one I allegedly talk about 24/7.”
She waited to find herself face to face with Seamus to brag about her freedom for he still had service to do.
“It’s okay, I’m waking up anyway, I didn’t hear you. You’re looking for something?” she indicated with her chin the way Dean was awkwardly standing over several piles of clothes and accessories out of Marigold’s chest.
Marigold made a loud noise of exasperation, left the couch, and went in the direction of her dorm. She heard in the background her best friends shouting their love for her and coming after her.
Even though Sirius had reassured her a little, she eventually let the frustration of the day get to her and fell asleep with tears hanging at the corner of her eyes, without really being able to differentiate which tear belonged to which issue.
“It’s fine!” she ignored the long-winded speech about her health, knowing he wouldn’t drop the subject until she resolved herself to see an actual therapist. “Don’t worry. Just because my body had a weird sudden reaction there was no need for all of this...” after a tight blank she added, “I appreciated it though, thank you guys.”
He tried not to be too explicit about the reasons why, as he’d shot down any facial expressions and managed to remain blank.
Now Pansy was with the two latter friends most of the time and the three of them were often joined by Theodore in the last years.
On the morning, she’d vaguely recall waking up in the middle of the night after hearing somebody shriek somewhere, and falling back asleep once again directly after that.
Then Neville followed, speaking softly, “Of course there’re always tiny risks, but we took enough precautions in order to not being caught.”
As he was showing several videos he had saved on his phone to show Fulvia, Blaise’s gaze wandered around the different houses’ tables. Then, he spotted a fulminating Pansy coming back to them.
“I can’t stand her scarred face too! What’s up with that, like how can she be suddenly comfortable about that? You can’t imagine how she always to keep her make-up on at all time to cover it and now it’s just on display also her hair is awful now haha. She’s got ugly, right?! So we’re on the same side you see.”
“Oh thanks my lord! The Messy came to save us! And I swear you don’t want to know. Please let’s talk about anything else; I can literally sense my brain cells fleeing far from this room.” urged Hermione, and then added “so where were you?”
She avoided his eyes but returned his smile, “You can stay here, I’m just gonna shower, you’re right I sweated shit loads, haha.” She awkwardly got out of bed, rearranging her shirt over her frame, ignoring the flaring sensation of the fabric against her arm.
She was only affected by the way the other ballet students side-glanced at her occasionally between classes, but she’d mastered for years the art of wearing cold masks no matter the circumstances and today was no exception.
“Well you know I’m still not positive love will occur once she’ll know who actually this person is. I mean, look for yourself!”
“Oi, not my fault we don’t have the same schedule, okay?! And you’re friends with her now? I wouldn’t trust her with driving; you never know what she’s been do-”
“So? France doesn’t change a thing; it does not make it less illegal.” Marigold had a point and she knew it, “At least here we know how it’s made and all you see?”
She was finally able to show off to a larger public this time, making sure that Cormac was watching her.
“Oh because you’re any different?” his tone was light but he wouldn’t meet her eyes. Marigold knew it was because he had instantly regretted saying those words, knowing Ginny was in the room with them, as a silent spectator. Still, it hurt a bit, just a bit on top of everything else.
She scowled it off and limped her way – too tipsy to mind and control it – through the Requirement room.
She could hear Blaise’s voice on top of her own, helping her with counting the seconds between every deep breath.
“Ashamed?!” The young girl repeated, “Oh, I surely ain’t as I need to keep preciously every single drop of shame for when I have to be around you in public.” She ended her sentence with the sweetest smile she could offer.
She didn’t like that everybody around was suddenly acting so different towards her. She hated that it was because of her. So she cut short to it.
She waited a little then added not resisting at the urge to snipe at her, “It might be hard to be as thirsty as you but stop seeing sex implications everywhere please; I’m eating and I’m hungry, that would be a shame to change that.”
She didn’t know how to bring the right amount of gratefulness to his ears, “Hm, yeah, it was- it’s- hum I have no words. Thanks a ton Sevs, like for everything and all and-”
All summer long, during the part where Marigold’s friends had joined her at least, the goal between Dean and her had been to try to offer the nastiest version of the Cha-Cha Slide dance song.
Then Potter climbed the stage in turn, everybody knew her, or soon would, as the co-captain of the track team with McLaggen. A lot of people knew the tension between them was still present given their
She gracefully sat at the table with them, her anger pouring out of her facial expression. Fulvia really thought a glare could kill and Pansy was the one who had made her believe so years ago.
The four of them would often hang out together since then, but they were not as close with each other as they made the rest of the school believe. Or at least that’s what Fulvia thought.
Years ago, she had found one of Sirius’s old pictures of when he and his friends – whom her father was part of – were hanging out here. Thus, the shop must have been older than the Palaeolithic era.
The other three Slytherins sat down; Nott and Parkinson’s backs in her vision while the stranger would be facing her with Zabini next to her as Marigold was still turned toward their table.
The last sentence sounded like a suggestive request. He was now the one asking for forgiveness by offering all the support she needed. She understood that. She knew he felt responsible and she felt sorry for him, she didn’t want him to blame himself.
Blaise tempted fate, he tried to pass along a glass of water to Fulvia, but this latter knew it was more than just an act of politeness; she knew he kept tabs in his head of what she was getting in her body to know what she was lacking any second of the day.
On this thought, Marigold absently followed her friends out of the Great Hall to their common room and sat on their usual spot, sandwiched between her two best friends. She did not seem to be aware of the arrival of two more of her friends, even if she heard a background of a light chat going on.
“What the hell are you two even rehashing about?!” Marigold proceeded to put her camera down on a little table and traded in it for her glasses, putting them on the tip of her nose.
-” even with his angry tone, she could feel all the affection he poured in this latter word, this name, her name, the name he had gave her years and years ago as he had met his goddaughter for the first time in his life. He looked away, going back to an angry-frown, “I found the room but your father paid for the fees, it was an agreement with Dumbledore. We found the pieces of furniture here and there, it’s nothing much. I hope it’ll be comfortable enough for you. Tell me if you need anything at all.” The pain in his voice was menacing to make her cry once again.
She hadn’t met anybody there in two years and she cherished the idea that this school year wouldn’t be any exception. She even achieved not to come face to face with Filch or his stupid cat.
Marigold tried to shove past Crabbe and Goyle, but their size differences might have been a slight factor on why they wouldn’t budge.
“Monopolizing everybody’s interest I mean. She’s basically the most hetero bitch out there that I know attract so much people. Come on don’t look at me like that,” his voice took a tone of false outrage, “you know exactly what I mean. She only had to jump on the stage without her uniform and what, smile, and all the assembly sighed out of admiration. What is so good about her?” he added with a wink and laugh in his voice.
“You ask me the same thing every time, and yes, they know I’m still in school, well some of them. And, yes, they were also aware about this fact when they hired me three years ago Mione,” she threw the other girl a look over her left shoulder and kept talking, “and they are taking me back early because there’s a lack of employees, that means more money for me. That’s a win-win case scenario.” She said the last words with a big grin across her face.
The ginger boy abruptly backed away, a hand on his heart and a false expression of shock and surprise, gasping really loudly, “Holly fuck! Marigold Jaime Potter, how dare you,” He looked at Dean, next to him and put his hands on the boy’s hears, “and in front of the baby!?! Don’t you have a heart, you git peasant?”
Fulvia was back; even her absence and all the unknown reasons her new appearance held did nothing to impede her studiousness once in the classrooms.
Then she had entered the filled up bathtub, as softly as she could; her brain was disoriented by the crying.
“Thanks Jimmy, I could no longer feel my arm.”  She smiled at him before taking the shot and walking away, trying to keep it steady with the high heels.
As she waited for the professor to enter the room, she lit a cigarette, opening the window, letting the smell and smoke get away.
Then, she eventually took her tray and walked towards the wall, a bit farther and hidden from the tables, where the trays were discarded. She turned to leave once and for all the Great Hall but collided with something, well, someone.
She rushed to knock out her opponent by throwing him over her shoulder. Maybe the rush of the events made her act a bit fiercer that intended seeing of the boy’s face went from surprise to slight discomfort once hitting the ground.
She hurriedly pulled herself from the wall and expended the space separating them. She rolled her eyes for the umpteenth time tonight. He tried to close the void between them and intended to reach up to her but she harshly smacked his hand away as if she had been already burnt in anticipation of the touch.
She knew he sugar-coated what he was saying, after all he was the one that had directly seen what Lucius Malfoy had done to her.
She was about to yell at them something like “HA-H, GAAAAAAAAY” but she noticed something and her legs suddenly felt heavy.
The ivory-skinned girl raised her perfect eyebrows in genuine puzzlement, the previous sentence was longer thing without insults than all the combined exchanges the two girls had ever had since their first encounter, “Yes, indeed, as you can see I’m currently suffering from the unfortunate disease of a sprained ankle-”
“I swear everything is going to be ok from now on, I’m here and you are not going anywhere.” He emphasised his last words with a firmer grip on her wrists.
“Do you want a candy? A mint?” To which she politely declined. “Maybe it’s a bit early for that, or late if you plan to have lunch after this. So, tell me a bit about the
“Hey, did you sleep with your ankle support? The physio told you not too. Ugh,” they separated and Blaise proceeded to remove the semi fabric/plastic/wire that covered her ankle and massage the bruised area for her, “it’s no gonna heal at this rhythm, and that’s a no-no.” He warmly smiled.
“Gosh, have mercy, leave me alone. Please.” She groaned, putting the palms of her hands on her ears.
“Yeah, I see no problem whatsoever to follow you. Taking in account the fact you made sure of knowing that I lost my friends somewhere on the way and that my mind isn’t clear.”
By doing so, she caught sight of her hands. They were shaky, dry and seemed thinner than... few weeks ago by the way the several rings she wore now dangled a little around her fingers. She slept another guilty glance at the wrapped up food; she wasn’t hungry for now.
“NO! Not at all! I just love to rummage randomly into people’s belongings and judge them for their tidying skills because you know I’m that bitch!” he deadpanned.
It wasn’t a nightmare nor was it an accident where she could have confused this person for Malfoy for they both had a slender figure and the same gracious and long face.
“Hello Professor McGonagall, a sweet day for September we’re having, right?” A stern face only received her observations.
In the parking lot of the station, standing by an ordinary old but clean dark car, a man whom the white of his shirt’s collar underlined the deep pigment of his skin, had been waiting for her.
“So what? You want me to pander at her feet just because the Ice Queen is back and throw a Hallelujah? Hell fucking no, no fucking way! She can burn alive for what I care! Gosh you know that I hate her!”
It had started with Potter coming for Fulvia after this latter had let a note in Potter’s locker explaining the disgusting behaviour of her ex-boyfriend, well boyfriend at the time.
“So it’s true? We heard a bunch of students from all houses talking about her return, but I was not buying it. Guess the Ice Queen is back to form the Fucking Bitchy People coalition.”
“Hey, now! We’re not disgusting, and neither is it a contest!” Hermione hoped in the current conversation as she had finished her rummage, “Once you’ll know him personally, it’s possible you’ll both fall in love. But also maybe you won’t like his character so much. But you’ll never know if you don’t actually speak with each other. And by no means should we adopt a defeatist attitude.”
Finally! Somebody was stepping in the parallel alley, getting out of the front door of a shop and allowing Marigold to take her cliché and by doing so her mood would maybe hopefully improve.
After letting the pressure in the room fall back, it was Seamus turn to step in: “We know, Mari, we know since your first meeting you can’t stand her. And your reasons are valid; we just want you to be free from all this hatred you nourish against her, because it’s doing you wrong.” As he was saying those things, he had brought his body closer to the edge of the armchair he sat in, giving Luna an eyeful of his back. This latter, silent until now, chose what she saw as an opportunity to change subject.
“Well, it’s not a proper meeting actually,” she searched her words and added “more of a ‘you’re-in-my-way-move-or-face-the-consequences-of-the-collision-thanks-to-the-gravitation-law’ kind of meeting, so...”
From that moment on, her friends would call her Fulvia to her request. A name somebody she hadn’t disappointed fully yet had given her when she was younger.
Fulvia had dropped her bags just before diving in his opened arms and buried her head in the crooks of his neck.
Marigold, as her other fellow comrades from the athletics club, hosted the party following a precise schedule giving places, functions and hours with names.
“Oh yeah, don’t worry I didn’t miss your attitude towards me since we’re back to school. It would be hard to. It’s warming my heart to know I’ll be able to count on you in the hard moments though, thanks for being another voice of disapprobation in my head, Ginny, it means a lot to me.” She smiled warmly but her eyes remained cold.
Her friends didn’t push by following her as they knew she sometimes needed alone-time, and today more than never. So once Marigold was out of shout-reach she dropped the fake smile she had keep not to worry them and slowed her pace.
At some point, her voice got shakier and hoarser, her cries exhausting her vocal cords. Her breath was shallow and her head hurt even more than before if possible. She released her fist, letting the cutter knife escape on the mattress somewhere. She curled up on herself and concentrated on the burning sensation of her arm freshly butchered against the soft fabric of her tee absorbing the possible blood.
Nevertheless, Marigold’s friends seemed to have locked their eyes on a more precise point than just the Slytherin group, within the walking students more exactly.
“And one last thing;” his voice turned in a threatening tone, now coming clearly to her ears, “McLaggen, noting happened.”
He wasn’t fazed at all by her solemn tone while his was joyful and warm, “Nah, we don’t care. Just let us hang out there from time to time. That would do it.” he added with a wink, raising his eyes for the first time since the beginning of their conversation. He was able to catch a glimpsed of the dark circle under eyes of the girl before coming back to his phone. If Blaise’s personality and love for the girl was shown by worrying in silence and be sure to protect her any instant, Theodore’s affection for her was more blunt, “Nightmares again, huh?”
Ginny considered for few minutes her position, and, with an infernal grin, locking her eyes in her brothers’ sank even further in Dean’s laps.
She collapsed head and stomach first on the bed, kicked her shoes. She struggled to remove her glasses without her hands in a way that she could attempting a reproduction of the nothern elephant seals courtship ritual.
Facing directly the bed space, there was a first door leading to the bathroom. Another door on the same wall, closer to the entrance, opening on the dressing in a way that if said door was open then the main door of the bedroom would be blocked. Details, but it was reassuring and comforting in a way.
Dean raised his hand in victory, “Damn right, I’m baby.” His fluttering eyes mocking his boyfriend, Seamus, across the table.
“No I cannot,” Hermione stiffened her position as she took her serious voice, “I’ve been sent to earth to mentally torture you,  and you know it.” At that, Hermione added a devilishly, cartoonish like laugh.
She walked back to the lockers to change so she’d be able to offer some help for the cleaning of the stage.
“Well, I take pride in being my own strong and responsible female figure!” He added smugly. Fulvia was fully laughing now. Knowing Theo had issues with his family and his mother in particular and making jokes around it was some really common for their group.
“Oh you know how I wouldn’t want to steal that spotlight of the family favourite dramatic child.” Ginny fluttered her eyelashes putting and angelic expression on her face, raising her eyes from her phone screen for the first time since Marigold had woken up. She noticed the tired look on Marigold’s face and changed the subject when after few seconds she understood that Marigold wouldn’t answer her last nasty barb, “You didn’t come at this afternoon practice.”
Followed by her friends as they were heading for their usual spot at the Slytherin table, she tried to ignore the way the voices died dramatically in the room to let place to whispers and murmurs. She felt the weight of the thousand eyes glaring her on their way to sit down.
Unfortunately the skinny boy was sitting while facing down the table with her face, only his perfect light eyebrows and the straight line of a nose showing, a heavily ringed, fair-skinned hand covering/supporting half of his face.
“How are you feeling?” the worry in Blaise’s voice was genuine. She checked on Pansy and Theo, quietly smoking and chatting in the background, politely ignoring the two friends but ready to blend in the conversation if needed.
“I’m glad your brain is still functioning and you can form irony still, that’s very impressive according how you try so hard to destroy it,” the girl wouldn’t back down now, “We’re not in holidays anymore. You can’t just get wasted on every occasions you get, else let me show you one or two dark narrow alleys in Hogsmeade where you could finish your trashy life with your shitty plant and alcohol. Here we have a fucking team counting on you; you’re supposed to take us to finals. But all you ever do is relying on me and your fucking psycho of an ex for taking the lead of our team.”
resounded, awakening Marigold up from her slumber. She blindly looked for her phone with her hand to stop the alarm, somewhere under her pillow and grabbed her glasses before looking at the screen. As she processed her notifications, she heard rummage in the room with her and rose on her elbow to take in the view around her.
As for Marigold, she had taken after her godfather about the particular interest of photography. She liked taking blurry pictures of unknown people the most.
Even if for now Potter had turned the other way around, she wouldn’t risk anything and chose to keep her upper body a little bent over the table, listening to her friends talking about the new school year and what Fulvia had missed, purposely avoiding direct questions about herself at all.
At this moment she realised that the other girl had been awfully quiet for a while now. The white-blond haired girl was lying back against the wall, scrolling on her phone, maybe pretending nothing had happened. Somehow Marigold was glad she acted this way, but reading through the other girl expression, she saw she was about to say something but hesitated. Eventually she spilled it out.
Marigold finally went back to her former position, facing her friends who were expectedly looking at her.
First the pointless accusations, then whatever was the thing involving Malfoy and Cormac. Too much, literally too much for the state Marigold was in. She breathed in, grabbed her tray and before leaving, put it back down so she could carefully take off Luna’s sweater.
“If you say so...” Hermione still had doubts about their plan but never mind; she’d tried to prevent them long enough and it was not her problem anymore after 3 years of long arguments, she wasn’t their mother after all.
She went and sat back at the window seat, sipping from the bottle before dialling her aunt’s number as she lit up a cigarette and cracked the window open.
didn’t have the heart to without you since you’re the one setting the fun. not cool if you ain’t there xxx.
“Well, I’m not going crazy anymore if that’s what you’re asking.” She sheepishly smiled, adverting her eyes.
He had taken the habit to make fun of her and to belittle her as much as he could, minus all the time she had echoes of cheating material. She knew that at that time but had remained with him until it was unbearable.
More than that, she couldn’t find a single word to put on her current state of mind. Maybe disgust or hatred.
Everybody began to clap in sync to the beginning of the lyrics, positioning themselves to dance on the has-been but catchy song.
“Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four. Again, with me. Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four. Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four.”
Her body turned on autopilot and it was the gasp she made out of excitation and joyfulness that brought Ron to give interest on the subject of her focus.
“So what, you suggest we get rid of all men on the planet?” Malfoy’s tone was half mocking half serious.
“Did I fucking stutter?” She was being extremely serious judging by her iron glare. “It’s not yours, so take it off.”
She marked a dramatic pause in her speech that reluctantly made Fulvia’s hair rise and only made her hate more Potter for that. Once again everybody was listening carefully to what the latter girl was saying.
“No! Err no, it’s okay; I was in my head that’s why I- Well never mind. No I changed my shifts, I no longer work on the Sunday nights.” Marigold stepped out of her bed to look for her phone that had been catapulted somewhere in the room, so she would have to do something and not stare at Hermione with awkwardness.
She looked at Hermione and said above the ginger boy’s noises of protestation, “You know what, maybe it’s not only for the model company, but don’t they say, stay closer to your enemies or something?”
Even if human evolution had done a lot since its first discoveries – s/o to Darwin – they didn’t have invented yet a language to describe the way she felt at that very moment.
stuff, you know. Like an organised mess,” she knew he knew she was okay with him going through her things, but complaining about another person’s organisation was something else, “Are you late or something?”
She posted two videos that were in her draft on her social platform but turned off the notifications.
“They sure know how to rule a business; I mean it’s pretty early in the year. Do they know you just came back to school?! Well do they know you’re still in school?”
Only few knew the self-care routine Marigold had for her person. Not that it was something important or substantial to know. This knowledge just implied to be also aware of what made her take this special time. Indeed, apart from a closed group of individuals – in other word her friends – nobody knew about her side life.
They locked eyes; Malfoy’s being all shades of storm clouds, making Marigold shiver in turn, then, the girl was gone with a dismissive slur.
It was also the first time for Fulvia to hear such a cold voice from her Latin Professor who was usually more eager to smile and comfort his students with gentle speeches. She saw that Potter didn’t put up a fight and went to wash her hands, so Fulvia did the same.
Before Marigold could answer anything, Hermione was joining their childish argument with a shouting-whispering annoyed tone, “Gosh, please stop being so loud,” Exasperation left her mouth, “Are you two?!”
“Still a prick after waking up I see, nice to know nothing will ever change. Somebody didn’t quite sleep well.” Ginny was poking at the food on her plate.
She obviously very much regretted it as soon as she was aware of why her friends had complained earlier.
All of them seemed peaceful and happy. All of the shit that would happen later was nowhere in sight of course, still she felt more than sad but couldn’t describe it.
Hermione – the only person mildly concerned about that comment – was rolling her eyes, again, saying nothing.
Her sobs were now howl-like desperate wails escaping from under the covers, echoing between the blank walls of her dark room.
In her first class, she gave back her paper before anyone as she mentally thanked Blaise for the homework he had sent her, in her third one, which was AP chemistry, she precisely followed all the precise instructions of the protocol, unbothered by Theodore’s subtle looks of interrogation and the non-so-discreet ones Pansy threw her.
She caught sight of Dean and Seamus slowly waltzing in a less crowded spot. They’d stop the choreography and their choice of atmosphere detonated with the music.
There, she joined back the small group of seven years Slytherins wandering off between several showings, and Blaise threw casually his arm around her shoulders as if she was among them since the beginning of the event, as he used to do so.
The cup of pure black coffee was pretty small but she still held it with both of her hands, so her mind projected a feeling of usefulness and her anxiety would leave her alone for a bit.
Making a pass through the crowd – well, letting her friends move forward in the hustle and bustle – she finally settled in front of a low budget thrust stage, among other students in the way she wasn’t in the first row.
Until Thursday night in the Hogwarts Express, where all the anxiety she’d effortlessly buried under her non-mental presence had finally shown up, keeping her company on her way to Hogsmeade’s station just like a dear friend would. She’d switched non-stop between social medias trying to distract herself in vain.
The girl told herself that he might has come back in his dormitory from the pub they usually went on some Friday nights. She lurked in the blankets and took her phone.
The other girl seemed lost among mortals as her complexion was ironically almost matching the wall but at the same time she couldn’t blend in it at all.
) on her way out of the Great Hall, and she ignored them as much as they ignored her except for the female weasel who chose to indecently glare at her. Fulvia could see the girl’s head turning, following her motion as she went her way out of the room, until... “Ginny!”, a shouted whisper.
She fondly patted her back whispering calm and reassuring words and let the girl take refuge in her arms.
“Bring it, Crabbe, we both know I’m asking for it, come on! Hit me! Next thing you know, imma help you to get all the intricate details of the mosaic on the floor.”
She then lay on her back; her arms stretched and tried to think of what happened at lunch without crying. She knew her friends were angry at her for messing with her own health, she knew they were just worried about her well being and her capacity to treat herself right. Her poor choice of decisions could totally explain the worry they had. From her last boyfriend – anyway she wasn’t thinking about Cormac right now; fuck him – and her secret side job, and a bunch of other things she was supposed to be underage for.
The young people were either having the time of their lives laughing, or were too ashamed to even move a muscle.
“Yes, do you wanna come with me, Luna?” Marigold gave a safe glance to Ginny, checking her reaction after hearing the proposition, waiting to see what kind of mood she would be in.
Her other hand tucked deep in the pocket of her leather jacket. Some strands of white-blond hair had fell in front of her eyes from her hood.
Before the cornered girl could answer, Ron followed, “Wait-wait-wait, you follow her on instagram?! Like with your main account and all?!”
She’d go to excuse herself to the team tomorrow for living this early and not being able to properly help.
Last year, she had held her ground against false accusations, against low blows and public settling of scores. She couldn’t bring herself to do the same things all over again; the two months separating the two school years had been awfully eventful and had changed her in a way she wouldn’t stand for any of her past words even though it was the honest truth.
Once Hermione’s brown eyes came back to meet Marigold’s green ones, there was a sort of unspoken plea coming from her telling her friend not to look back and not taking any interest of whatever was happening just behind her back.
Most of the modified steps didn’t really require any specific skills but being quite flexible and having a good balance.
They swung between small talks and deeper ones and she didn’t forget to grandly thank him again and again for the time he had invested to help her.
Even with the glasses help, it was hard to make out who was that person; there wasn’t so much hair and it was easy to establish his body shape.
“When she’s not a dick 99% of the time you mean. What did she ever do for being this popular anyway? Get into fights and being most of the professors’ pet peeve.” She corrected herself after Blaise sceptically glanced at her, “okay, all the professors besides Sevs adore her even Flitwick, but there’s really nothing appreciating, she talks back, returns late her papers and she isn’t even prefect!”
The ivory-skinned girl had been perplexed as she understood they were going to their CR. She had interrogated him with a curve of her eyebrow once they had stopped behind the entrance of the room.
She knew that, she even knew he was by far the person who had the most concern about her life; her proper father figure. The efforts he may have been through to get her a new room was only one of the numerous proofs for it. And in retrospect, it always had been her godfather that got her presents, interests and attentions with real sentimental value.
Potter had nearly burnt herself with Fulvia’s cigarette when she had yanked the girl’s button shirt, bringing their faces close to spit something at Fulvia’s face.
He turned towards her with a sad smile, “Yeah, you’re right sorry I understand you have other things to do and- it’s just- well you don’t want to be part of an old quarrel between Sirius and I. It’s just- you, better than anybody else, know how secretive he can be sometimes and mostly when it’s about himself and about not being a burden for others and all that drama queen discourse shit.” he dropped once and for all the formal approach. They both had an awkward muffed laugh at that.
“What? You didn’t tell him? Haven’t you, like, kept in touch with him this summer?” Pansy was truly puzzled.
Fulvia progressed towards her usual spot, in the narrowest space between the stone walls framing the small stained glass window, just behind the desk.
“So, what’s this luxurious carriage is all about?” she’d sarcastically added, smiling fondly for she knew it was a favour from a certain professor.
“You stupid skank ass bitch, take that back right now!” Marigold tried slamming her in the nearest wall. Unfortunately for her, they were pretty close to this very wall in the first place so the impact was nothing as brutal as she had expected. On the other hand, Malfoy took the situation to her advantage and inversed their position with all the might she could with her bad ankle and a loud thud reasoned in the empty corridor as Marigold’s skull connected with the stone wall.
First, she would cross the school fence by the east side when she was back from work, hiding from dorms’ windows, and she’d open the kitchen offices’ door with her card and sneak in.
,” he took a deep breath, not sure if he would step over the boundaries the girl established, “but you are in position to do something, if you want.
In spite of the fact that her brain refused to acknowledge it, the organ sent a normal body response to shame and anger. All her blood flooded to her cheeks and she was now unable to express to smallest sound. She remained calm and composed.
Hermione couldn’t help but having this ‘I-told-you-so’ expression Marigold knew she tried to hide and repress as much as possible. She knew full well Hermione’s aim wasn’t to hurt her in the first place and she also knew the girl had difficulties not taking her victories, even when they were about bad statements.
Something about an ego problem she was often told, but really, it was most likely to be a lack of self-worthiness (thanks Blaise’s therapist). But no one would bother to grab a metaphorical shovel and try to dig up to find the truth, to everyone’s sake she often thought.
“I- I don’t know anymore. Listen, I really need you not to tell anything at all. Please, promise me that. Swear it. I can only tell you if you swear.”
“Oh, well, if that’s the case then, suits yourself, hon.” Marigold motioned to wrap herself back up into her duvet.
Their break-up had been quite fussy, between her friends trying to talk her into it for months on end, repeating her it was becoming more than really toxic for her, the other sixth year boys’ comments about her – Cormac had also took for habit to tell lies about their intimacy to load of his friends – he happened to be violent towards her and finally even Malfoy had been involved.
Potter’s jet black hair was surprisingly shorter yet messier than ever, letting the sun-kissed skin of her nape show. When this latter turned around, the contrast between the rich dark pigmentation of her hair and her olive skin with the green of her eyes was stronger than ever after this summer break; no doubt at least one of them had enjoyed the sun.
Once alone, she looked at her hand, the one that had gripped Malfoy’s fingers on their own, and thought that the contact had been warmer than she would have thought – disturbing and totally unexpected even if she was the one who’d done it but warm still. Maybe her return to Hogwarts wasn’t that bad after all.
The party wasn’t especially themed but songs where all from the 90’s to 2000 or so, and from time to time some current ones would pass.
This time Fulvia took care of not knocking anybody down, choosing a slower pace and avoiding once again her limping. She crossed the way of many students but ignored their glances. She finally settled near a window, hidden in a forgotten part of the East aisle and lit a cigarette.
She was closing the door of her locker, sighting from exhaustion, and in the reflexion of the mirror, she saw the usually vivid and glimmering green of her eyes tarnished by the effort. Her dark wavy hair was as messy as she’d just walked straight out of a storm. The practice had been pretty tough, and as it was a “back-to-training-after-3-months-of-being-a-lazy-moist-bun-of-bread” kind of training, she would probably pass out soon, every muscle of her body aching like crazy.
In front of the closed expression of the other girl’s face, Fulvia couldn’t help but have a flash-back/memory of the very last year ending, the arguments and dramas she had been involved into by force more than by will; which added to the complexity of the situation and gave some more reasons as why she didn’t felt like confronting Potter this year and would do everything possible to avoid her.
It was a weird feeling, Malfoy was finally back at her, in her past “normal” self, she had not seen her this alive since last year, so in a way she felt a reassuring feeling pass through her body that she urged away to focus on the cold words she had to hear.
Nevertheless, he took advantage of the fact Hermione was bent toward her notes to discretely shake Marigold’s hand while whispering to her, “That’s on.” adding a wink.
She didn’t bother with mascara and grabbed her glasses and her phone before rushing out of the dorms/common room/never ending stairs – why ô why did the Gryffindor tower was raised so high and so far from the Great hall? Must the ancient gods hate on her this hard?
Ginny is feral, and I'm not sorry for it. I would be too, feral, if I were the youngest sibling, only girl of her family. She knows how to fight and have some character. She doesn't like her friends messing themselves up.
“I would recommend a course where you can sit or at least not moving around too frequently, given your current state.” His look slipped down, and even if his office’s desk blocked the view, she understood the old man was referring to her legs.
“It was different back then!” she looked offended and ashamed, “It was summer time, and your uncle lives in France. Not in this very castle that represent education and law.”
Fulvia was too exhausted and disoriented to notice that Potter had froze on the spot, not putting a fight to break free.
It was skinny – Marigold bet it was even skinnier without the uniform on, judging by the way the boy seemed to swim in his jumper worn over a button shirt, falling over the uniform trousers, a black robe flying behind from time to time.
“I- I don’t know what else to tell you for you to get how serious this is and how bad you’re getting. I mean, you’re not like three years ago, but still. You’ve been weird all summer. And now that we’re back to school, I don’t know. I thought you would, like, go back to be the old captain of the track team and show example to the new years and, yeah...”
Marigold couldn’t tear her eyes away from that face, from that timid expression originally intended for his friend’s eyes only, from what appeared to be a silent laugh of small joy and pure amusement, oblivious to the rest of the world.
“Do you know anything about a potential new student at Hogwarts?” she asked innocently, playing with the food in front of her.
“He didn’t betray you, per se, I was the one engaging. I couldn’t let you alone. I wanted to know if he knew about what had happened to you.”
She’d finally decided to wear a cap backward, not convinced by the look of the greatest fuckboy to ever exist. Some strands of hair falling out on her forehead escaping the cap hole added to her forever careless and casual dressing style; large shirts with other comfortable layers on top and a pair of black skinny jeans with big chunky boots.
She admitted she was far from being an angel or even a good soul or any other silly things like that, but she surely didn’t deserve that. Or at least wasn’t yet aware of the reasons why.
She would put on what stood of PJ clothes – comfy booty shorts and a large T-shirt – then would pack up her things back in her bag, and would leave the room as quick as she’d came.
“Then why didn’t you tell me about it back then?! I know I was at a training programme here, but still.” his tone resonated like reproach in Marigold’s hears.
Ginny and Dean had dated during few months, years from now; it had not worked out well despite the great affection for each other, so they ended breaking up.  After that Dean somehow figured out his attraction for Seamus and it was toward his ex girlfriend he had seek for help to understand and manage his feelings. Since then the duo was closer than ever, and the couple would always be thankful to her. So her proximity with Dean had become a fond habit.
“Do you think I am this shallow? Common mate, I’m a little disappointed in you.” She looked up to him, her blind eyes leaving the charming boy on the other side of the street, “I mean, of course I’m not sure about what will his face look like, but I’m sure I’ll be able to love him no matter what, and he’ll will so much fall in love with me. We’ll beat Hermione and you in a disgusting affection showing contest!”
“Sounds good, thank you Marigold,” Luna was back at arranging her food, “If you want, you can give your wildflowers to Lavender, she’ll know how dry them properly.”
Hermione opened her mouth and closed it several times, looking for something to say before leaving her friend on her own, with her thoughts, alone, after a quite big argument. Perfect.
“Are you for real?!” now Ron was snickering, “I only told you this one time and never used it since! I saw it in a ‘how to call French people for fun article’??? I was 12?! Will this grudge take you hostage of any common sense?!?”
“Ew, don’t you refer to Moony like that! And stop talking at all; you’re ruining my chances of having any inspiration today.”
That was basically how she had spent the following days, dissociating and letting her occupations control her day-life like a routine.
TW/ Fatphobia, homophobia, implication of past abuse, unsolicited sexual comments, eating disorder, anxiety/panic attack.
After a blank of assimilation she sort of nervously chuckled and ignored the last remark, “He threatened you?! Like for real?”
“Where is she?!” Flitwick looked everywhere, fulminating, “When she told me there were stairs on fire somewhere in the castle, I should have known something was coming!”
“It seems wise indeed.” She dryly answered while arching one of her perfect drawn eyebrow, but curbed the movement once realising she had to stop acting like a mighty cold bitch, in other words, like her father.
And yet, they did and she couldn’t properly return the intentions. She wasn’t worth the efforts. Those people knew they wouldn’t get anything in exchange, and yet, they’d gladly put themselves under trials as to please a fucking insatiable and ungreatful cold-hearted queen.
Draco turned back to the painting then, understanding the look of terror on the man’s face. Just below the portrait, on the title and description that was written in Dutch, Draco spotted something below it, something written in magical ink. It was invisible to the naked eye unless you were a wizard, of course. It was easy enough to detect, Draco had seen invisible ink like this before when working on other dark artefacts.
As Draco stood up to leave, Robards halted as he said, “I have to say, you’re not at all what I expected.”
“Should we knock?” Blaise asked, causing both Potter and Draco to give him a dirty look, “What? It’s better than blasting the door down, we have no idea who could be inside!”
“Oh,” Draco’s stomach dipped at the memory and the mention of his name, “Well, considering I was inebriated throughout the entirety of it, I can’t say it went as well as it could have.”
“No,” Potter replied, wielding a rather frustrated expression, “I just don’t understand the point of this.”
He stared at it in awe. Draco hadn’t really decorated his home with more than the essentials. It was his first flat in the city and in his first few months, he could barely afford to furnish it properly until he began taking jobs for the Ministry. Besides his bedroom, at least. In it were displays of dark artefacts he’d collected over the years, stationed next to his working desk. On the brick side of the wall held shelves of potions, books, and other memorabilia collected from his years at Hogwarts. He had a potted wormwood plant on the side of his nightstand and next to it, a picture of his mother and him as a baby. His sheets were silk - one of the few things he’d remembered to bring from the Manor upon leaving home for the first time, and a Slytherin blanket he’d had since his first year in school.
Draco sat down on the stool next to Pansy, leaving her in the middle of the two, “Potter. Funny seeing you here.”
“I found this last week while cleaning the attic,” Harry placed the frame back on the cabinet, staring at a prepubescent Sirius, who looked like he wanted nothing more than to break from his mother’s grasp and leave to do whatever young boys do, “This was the only picture of him I could find. Walburga burned him off the tapestry.”
Draco thought. Normally when he received his summons to the Ministry, they typically left a name. This time, the anonymous contractor offered little to no information about why he was there, other than to say that Draco’s work was needed. He was never one to turn down work – especially now that he needed the money to support himself, even if it meant working with Aurors. Still, the times he had worked with the Ministry, it wasn’t nearly as ceremonious as this. Whatever job they had for him this time, he thought, must be big.
He slid across his desk a binder the size of a dictionary, chock full of documents with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s logo engraved in the front of it. Draco already dreaded the idea of having to scour through all of those pages.
Draco tried not to snicker. He highly doubted working with the Auror department was going to do anything but worsen his mental health, but she was right. He had no idea when another opportunity like this would happen again.
Draco realized as he stood abruptly that his appearance looked quite disheveled, not to mention the fact he was mid-panic when Blaise discovered him. He must have been quite a sight to look at. “Official Ministry business. You know I work here, on occasion.”
He had hardly noticed his mother’s presence whenever he was in the Manor. His mind was always a million miles away, reminiscing on some of the darkest moments of his life - all taking place here. A deep bitterness had set in his heart and he’d come to despise his childhood home, but his mother was still there. Regardless of her misdeeds, he couldn’t bring himself to hating her like he hated his father. She had birthed him, she had loved him when no one else did.
The man had a surly expression as he eyed Draco up and down before leading him down the hallway. He looked unfamiliar to Draco, but from his attire, Draco could tell he was an Auror, or at least a lackey for the Aurors, since he didn’t hold that same holier-than-thou attitude that most had – though it wasn’t for a lack of effort. As the lackey, whom Draco secretly nicknamed in his head, led him through a series of doorways, he eventually led him to an office of some sorts – one he had not been in before.
He must have heard Draco’s question, but did not answer as the two caravanned towards the door.  It wasn’t hot out, though Harry’s face was flushed, likely from the Apparation. Tiny beads of sweat dotted Harry’s forehead as he walked towards the building, threatening to fall with every step he took.
“Luxembourg now, is it?” Draco muttered, feeling his tone grow increasingly bitter, “Will my father take us on a trip through all of Europe then? To do what exactly? More sight-seeing?”
Blaise and Potter watched in awe as the rocks crumbled and exposed the floor beneath the well. That, they were not expecting.
Robards motioned towards the evidence room, to which Draco followed him in. There wasn’t a single light on in the room, save for a candle placed directly in the center. As they both entered through Draco’s side door, Robards switched on the light to reveal dozens, if not hundreds, of magical items enclosed in boxes on the mile-long stacks of shelves. Draco couldn’t decide if this was a dream come true or a nightmare, as he realized that some of the more dangerous dark artefacts remained enclosed in this room as well. The candle that flickered in the center of the room, at first glance, looked as if it was about to go out. Draco turned his attention towards it, making it flicker into a huge flame that would have engulfed the room if it wasn’t kept in a magically sealed case.
“Draco dear, shut the door, would you?” His mother had failed to look up from whatever it was she was reading.
The words rang through his ears, eerily reminding him of his conversation with his mother. They both bore the same surprisingly affectionate glance and frankly, it worried him. Whatever was to happen, Draco decided, would surely be the end of him.
