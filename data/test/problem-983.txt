“That’s called a relationship.”
“Well, they’ve got beer, at least.”
He snorted. “Rebuilding his life? Why the fuck does he get to do that, Hermione? After everything he did, after everything he did to you – “
“You, on the other hand – well, it’s nice to raise the tone of the conversation, if you know what I mean. And I hear we have something in common now. Ah, thank you monseuir,” he said, as a ratty looking bottle and three glasses appeared on the table. He set about filling the glasses – only two. “Corner, a toast. To life, love and the pursuit of better things!”
“How is working here?” said Harry, as they carried the drinks outside.
“Please. Longbottom’s fit as fuck now. Once I’m done with Harry, I’m jumping him first.”
“I’m guessing I… shouldn’t have? I’m sorry. But Ron gave me one of the promotional leaflets, so it looks like it will be classy rather than tacky. And I’ve never been clubbing before, I think it could be really exciting. So say you’ll come? Please?”
“So you were trying to be nice?” said Morag. “You should tell her that. Immediately following a heavy and grovelling apology, of course.”
“Such a shame,” said Blaise. “Well, Corner, if you promise me that you’ll disappear I suppose I’ll have to take your word as a gentleman.”
“The terrible secret that you can’t tell us?” said Pansy. She was painting her nails, the harridan.
“Yes, I’m sure he said whatever he could to get a reaction from you,” said Blaise, rolling his eyes. “God love him, he is very predictable. No, you were right about why they cut him off, Harry. He cut himself off, rather. Decided that the Malfoy money was tainted with blood and he couldn’t stand to be around his father anymore.”
“Nah,” said Harry. “I imagine the Slytherin common room was just like this all the time. Everyone being cryptic and repressed until you’re not even sure what you’re fighting about.”
“So I found out why Malfoy’s parents cut him off,” he said without preamble, interrupting another of Blaise’s stories.
There was a small snuffling sound, and it took her a second to place it. Harry was crying. He wiped his eyes, looking sheepish.
“Parkinson’s my partner,” said Ron, and even with his face made out of coals and flickers it was impossible to miss the abject expression of misery.
“Harry was, I think.”
“They were shits,” said Harry. “Shitty, shitty shits.” He drank again. “And they didn’t even get what they deserved. The war ended, everyone got what they deserved, except for the people who tortured me the hardest and for the longest. You know why they didn’t die? Because I protected them. Because I found them a safe place and told them to stay away. What did I get for that? Fuck all. I don’t think they even know that I survived. They certainly haven’t asked.”
After midnight, after Parvati had kissed her breathless as the fireworks burst around her and above her and inside her, Hermione tapped Harry and Ron on the shoulders and led them outside to the balcony.
“What, the well behaved women one?”
“Um, Draco? Theo? Even Greg’s in there.”
my blessing in some way. I just want to avoid an uncomfortable situation.”
And with that, he was gone. Harry was alone. The snow was still falling.
“Dean,” said Seamus, latching onto him from behind. “My friend. Me old mucker. Me best mate.”
It was his turn to finger-jab her. “Your room is number five. That’s number six.”
“I propose a wager,” said Pansy. Her eyes were glistening dangerously. “It’s nearly Halloween. Draco and Potter, drink off, and the person who wins gets to choose the other’s Halloween costume.”
“What are you talking about?” said Susan, who was now approaching purple.
“Hullo, Harry,” said Ron, appearing out a side door. “Malfoy, you’re here at last. Pansy sent me to fetch you through the back entrance – said something about how you didn’t like the press. Nott and Zabini too, if you want to.”
“Are you sure this is a hypothetical?” said Ron.
“Don’t.” That came hissed through his teeth with venom. “Here’s what’s going to happen, ok? You and I are going to get through tomorrow, and then you’ll go home for the winter break. When you come back, we’ll have spent three weeks apart and this – this – momentary madness will have been forgotten. You and I will go back to the way we were before, and you will never, ever, EVER bring up this moment again.”
“I honestly care zero percent whether Draco Malfoy lives or dies,” she’d said, “but I’d do what Hermione wants before she has an opportunity to shout at you more. Your girl’s fucking scary.”
Harry hated house parties.
“Gross,” said Harry, pulling on a robe. He found Morag, Anthony and Nott in the kitchen, arguing over some obscure point of magic.
“Oi, Chosen One,” yelled someone from the back of the line. “Can you get a bloody move-on?”
Draco sniffed imperiously. “I may be the world’s worst Malfoy, but I’m not
“Come here,” said Harry, and Dean hugged him, burying his face in his shoulder. “You’re going to be all right, you know?”
“It was good sex,” said Harry.
“Yes,” said Hermione. “I sound terrible and I look terrible and I’m all-over just a mess. That’s just me, Parvati. That’s just who I am. It may be hysterical to you that I actually go out looking like this, but maybe I’m just hoping to meet someone who likes a girl with a mind rather than five pounds of make-up.”
There's also a scene of violence, and Seamus is still not being his best self.
“It… It…” It just felt important, somehow. There was some alchemy there, in Malfoy’s change and his big expressive eyes and the way Harry had felt as they debated. “It means I don’t have to worry about him doing something evil this year.”
“Hermione, it changes everything.”
Harry shrugged. “Dunno.”
“Ok,” he said carefully. An anxious Ron was a little like a Hippogriff - best to approach with extreme caution. “What’s it about?”
“Chill out,” said Parvati fondly. “Uni really is a time for trying new things for you, isn’t it?”
“Harry,” she said, her voice dangerous calm, “why did you tell Ron that Malfoy fancies me when we both know perfectly well that he’s gay?”
“What? No. No, Seamus was being a right cock. Who cares if Malfoy is gay? Or Zabini, for that matter?”
There was a long silence, in which Pansy stood in the rain, a sodden stick figure in black. And then Seamus sneezed.
“That’s beautiful. Got any more?”
“Does it matter?”
“Who do you actually feel like yourself with?”
“Um,” said Ron. “Who’s this about?”
“Fuck you,” said Dean. “Harry’s just a friend and yeah, I snogged him, but maybe that was because my best friend was disgusted with me and I was hurting and lonely and Harry was actually understanding and kind. And how dare you, how dare you talk to me about kissing Harry when you got drunk and made a pass on half the girls we know, and then actually shagged Hannah. So what, you get to go around shagging any girl you like but if I kiss a bloke then suddenly there’s something wrong with me? That Irish Catholicism really did a number on you, mate.”
“Don’t,” said Harry. “I’m having flashbacks. I lived through an actual war, and
“Draco – what? – I – “
“Uni is a time for trying new things,” he said, plating their sandwiches. “So, who was it? Boot? Corner? Ugh, not Nott, was it?”
Harry grinned. “What’s the matter, Draco, scared of a little competition?”
getting comfy with his flatmates. They all barely tolerated him, anyway. Probably they had only been showing him kindness because Potter seemed to favour him. Probably they were all out there in the kitchen right now, laughing at him for thinking that anyone would ever look at him and
“At the moment, I’m just waiting for someone,” said Parvati, staring into the hall as Hermione’s hand-gestures got ever more frantic.
“Oh.” She blinked. “But – Blaise?”
“I’m in love with someone!” Ron yelled. “I’m in love with someone, and I wanted to talk to you before anything happened because I didn’t want you to be hurt, and also because I’m worried about you, but now – “
Hermione opened her mouth and shut it. Opened it again. Possibly had a stroke.
“You are evil,” he said to Parkinson. “Pure pure evil.”
“Potter,” said Malfoy. “What are you doing.”
“Is this ok?” he whispered, and Draco pushed back.
went the klaxons in his brain. “Look, I’m sure Ron would be up for it. I mean, you know each other so well!” Intensified sobbing. “I always thought you were meant to be, you know.” An actual anguished moan at that one. “And you go so well together!”
“I did not –  Are Terry and Anthony -?”
She fixed Dean with a look that was dangerously close to a glare. “We parted on good terms.”
She waved a hand. “No, nothing like that. Casual sex only. I said as much, and he said as much, and it was all very nice and friendly.”
“He spent Christmas cooking for the homeless,” said Pansy. “Or possibly just cooking the homeless. The homeless were involved somehow. He’s very committed.”
“I’m not trying to be funny – “
“Wait.” A terrible, terrible idea was gathering in her mind, but it was one that would have no consequences.
“Then show her in your own way. Do something that you do well, for her. Just let her know that it’s all for her.”
“Did Hannah say something about fifth year? Because that was a dare –“
“Don’t worry – “
“You’re a lesbian?” said Harry. Morag raised an eyebrow and gestured at herself, from the half-shaved head to the combat boots.
“There was a vat of brains in the Ministry with tentacles, and – “ He was cut off by the noise of Seamus entering the pub with a bang, and then storming out of the front doors. He sighed. “Fuck. Sorry. I should – “
“I kissed her.”
“Didn’t she say that when Ginny punched that Keeper?”
“Malfoy!” Hermione was reaching fever pitch. “Oh for god’s sake, Harry was lying to you about Malfoy. And a nice job you did there too, now Harry’s convinced that you’ll never accept him.”
Harry grimaced. “Ok, yeah, but… I don’t know that… I mean, it’s uni, isn’t it? Everyone tries something new at uni.”
“Hey, Morag.”
People were rapidly careening towards that kind of too-fierce drunkenness, propelled by social awkwardness, that could only possibly end in sex or a fight. This was not a place for making friends. This was a meat market, and Harry didn’t want any meat. Well, maybe the nice tasty bacon of a date, but not the whole sausage – and now he was getting off track with his metaphors.
“Blaise is having fun,” said Hermione redundantly. Blaise Zabini could have looked like he was having fun in a hole in the ground. He certainly looked so now, surrounded by a group of people who were bellowing laughter at his stories. They were probably all fake, thought Harry bitterly. Maybe he was just too old for this kind of thing. Maybe he’d missed his chance to be the kind of person who liked getting drunk and snogging strangers. The thought was depressing, and he decided he couldn’t get through this sober.
“Why don’t you want her to – “
“You’re magnificent,” said Blaise, knocking his drink against hers. “And the cut! I mean, high-low hemlines are fine, but you need a good sweep between them. The sudden drop makes her look like a Lego figure.”
“Of course. Sorry, it’s on me for assuming.” She bit her lip. “Can I ask a question?”
“We were drunk,” said Hermione. “When I snogged Malfoy. And then he told me he was gay. And I was crying when I snogged Harry. And then I told him I was gay.”
Malfoy’s brow creased, but he just shrugged and let Harry follow him into the bar. The silence between them was harder than Hagrid’s rock cake.
The bar was violently pink, hideously crowded and swelteringly hot in its single underground room. They were currently sharing a table with eight other people. There was a sign by the staircase that read WELL BEHAVED WOMEN DON’T MAKE HISTORY in neon letters, constantly surrounded by girls squatting for pictures in front of it.
“We should probably check he’s still breathing,” said Harry.
That earned him a smile. “Literally nothing surprises me about you anymore. You are the strangest man I have ever met.”
“Hi,” said Draco, because he was apparently just as stupid as him. “I’m meant to be avoiding you. I’m – angry. Yeah. Angry and stuff. You know.”
“I guess?” said Harry, as Michael sulkily muttered “Sure.”
“You think about me?”
He pulled away to take in Draco, flushed and damp. “You love me,” he said, thick with the wonder of it all. Draco’s eyes widened, and –
“Good. She’s too good for him anyway.”
“Christ, Hermione, poor you. Living with him and studying with him?”
it was all those things and so much more. It was her teeth growing over her chin and children in the playground yanking on her curls and saying
And he kissed him.
Their block didn’t have a garden, obviously, but it did have a small tarmacked square that was accessible only through the ground floor of their building, hemmed in on two sides by them and two sides by the science block. When the pub had kicked them out last night they’d all ended up in Hermione’s flat, and Parvati had gone out there to smoke, Harry going with her.
Malfoy pulled his arm back, and Harry wondered for a wonderful second if he was actually going to punch him in the face. But instead Malfoy swung his hand down, his finger landing on top of Harry’s reading, a triumphant smile on his face.
“I can get you different flowers!”
“POTTER!” Draco shoved him away, and Harry landed against the broom shed with a gasp.
“That’s terrible,” said Hermione. “Draco, you don’t – “
“Draco,” said Blaise, his smile apparently unmoveable. “I don’t suppose you’d join us for a drink?”
She straightened up, tried to radiate calm and self-respect and the general aura that she was only asking this as an intellectual exercise. “Am I attractive?”
“Just say fat,” said Susan. “It’s less annoying.”
“Fuck,” said Harry. The Royal College was extremely strict on the fact that no press were allowed on their grounds, so Harry had largely been left alone. That hadn’t changed the fact that he was hideously famous. Right now a crowd of photographers were encamped outside, and at one point Ron had stopped mid-sentence, leant over and grabbed the notebook out of the hands of the man at the next table. It had been full of quotes from their conversation. Ron had kept it, and Harry had stuck up a thick muffling charm. “Wait, George is opening a nightclub? Really?”
“I’m sorry, Harry. Fuck, I’m so sorry, you just wanted – “
“I fucking tried, didn’t I!” yelled Malfoy. He was gripping his water glass so hard it looked like it might shatter. “I went to find you first, actually, and what did I get? You took one look at me and told me to fuck off. So sorry if I didn’t fancy round two of that. Pity that I’m getting it anyway. And I don’t apologise to homophobes, not for my existence, not for
“That’s the problem with virtue ethics. Goodness and bravery are all very well, but who decided those were the virtues that you should measure yourself up against? Dumbledore? The Weasley’s? That bloody hat?”
“It’s so good to see you guys,” said Ron, slapping Seamus on the shoulder and grinning up at Dean. “These tossers have been listing Gryffindor faults for the last hour. I reckon it’s time to turn the tables.”
“You are smart, Ron,” said Harry. “And I’m sure she’s great. So what’s the problem?”
“Eight,” said Harry, keeping his wand trained on Michael.
“She’s a challenge,” said Blaise, apparently deciding to open up. “A puzzle. A conundrum. Normally I could have a girl like her falling at my feet by now, but she seems utterly determined not to take me as anything but a joke.”
“Nope,” said Harry, trying to focus on his breathing. Draco was rubbing teasing patterns across his arse. “You seem to like it.”
“Absolutely nothing surprises me about that man.”
“Catch up,” said Draco. “Sounds fun.”
“You’re not following, Greg – “
“Mate,” he said, interrupting another future catastrophe that Ron was painting in exquisite detail, “if you were shagging someone, and then they stopped because they were pissed off at you, and then you made up, could you start shagging them again? Hypothetically?”
“Oi,” said Harry. When the two of them started, they could go on for a while. “Hermione, bastion of knowledge and best friend in the world, you wouldn’t happen to know who’s in our flat, do you?”
“It’s Blaise,” said Draco, dropping to his knees and fiddling with Harry’s fly. “He once told me that monogamy was the only STD he’d never caught.”
“Just follow my lead, all right?”
“Harry,” said Blaise, evenly, “are you asking why I wasn’t on the other side of the war?”
“Seamus seems in a bit of a grump, doesn’t he?” Harry turned. He hadn’t realised that Draco was watching them too.
No one makes jokes about me eating stuff that looks like pussy. Does any food look like pussy?”
was it?
“He’s just hear for his course, Harry,” she said. “Don’t – “
“Blaise,” muttered Draco. “Said something about a threesome. I’d gird your loins now.”
“Excuse you, I’m an
“I don’t have to explain myself to you,” said Pansy. “I don’t have to explain myself to anyone.”
“Fine Art,” said Dean. “I can’t believe Hog – uh, school never taught us much about it. I mean, I always knew how to draw in the
why she slapped me. I normally understand. Because I’ve kissed their sister or declined to get engaged or not succeeded in adequately shocking their parents. I’m not grabby, you understand. I’m a horrific arse, but not that kind of arse. We were slow-dancing, I moved in slowly, she had plenty of time to just say ‘thanks, Blaise, but I’m not really in the mood.’ This wasn’t a rejection this was – fuck, I don’t know. A histrionic attack.” He took his whiskey, drained the glass. “I’ll try her again later. Apologise. You’re a good man, Thomas. Go back to Seamus. It looked like something fun was happening.”
Hermione grinned and twirled. She was wearing a dress of deep red with a neckline that plunged down to her navel. It clung tightly to her hips and thighs, flaring just above her knees and giving her the kind of silhouette that Harry associated with Marilyn Monroe. Her lips were an even darker red, bright against her dark skin, with a pale gold shimmer on her eyes and cheekbones. Around her neck she wore loops and loops of filigree cold chains so delicate that Harry worried they would be pulled apart with one touch. Her hair had began to grow out from it’s close crop into the close corkscrews that he associated with her, and he was glad she’d decided to forego Sleakeazy’s.
“Cool,” said Greg. “That means I win, right?”
Blaise laughed. “Duly noted. I just – I couldn’t have done it alone, Harry. Thank you. I’ve never been brave. Never. I don’t even know how I got the courage to do that back there. It’s just – Susan.”
“You all right, Nott?” said Harry, in an effort to clear the air.
She tilted her head. “What do you think it would have been like if we hadn’t had to do all that?”
“Why not?”
Two weeks into his slow descent into insanity, Draco sat up in bed in the middle of the night from a dream where Potter had sliced off his left arm and thought
“Right. Interesting face. Got it.”
“What do you mean by – “
“Shut up – surely, surely I can’t have that much appeal. So what is it? What, Blaise, because I don’t know what to do with you. Some days you’re my best friend and you’re making me laugh and we’re cracking up at the world together, and it seems like you really respect me, and then suddenly you turn around and you’re mock-flirting with me. It’s giving me emotional whiplash, and I’m through with it. If you can’t respect me – “
“It’s fine,” said Harry, grabbing Malfoy’s shoulder. “Cheers, mate. Ring up the shots on a separate tab, yeah? With the staff discount. He’s paying for that.”
“Yes, sorry. And with Terry I get to be this flirty, witty creature that’s always teasing.”
I’d forgotten that we were actually friends. I wouldn’t have treated Hermione like that, and I guess I got so distracted by the extras that I forgot to treat you as a person first. So I’m sorry. I don’t know if you managed to find anyone else to hang out with, but I know with Blaise distracted with Susan and Pansy drinking with Ron it must have been a bit shit on your own. Thought Nott was there – what
fucking count.”
“I saw the two of you coming back from the pub last night. Don’t worry, Theo’s the only other person and he doesn’t care enough about you to tell anyone. I had to stage a blazing row with him to stall Blaise, otherwise he’d be presenting you with a rainbow-splattered condom and lube welcome basket right now.”
“I mean – “ She desperately wanted to leave. She could
as he tugged on his balls. He’d go out with Blaise and start chatting to some extremely handsome stranger, and suddenly they’d tug on their hair and he’d think
to his reputation. He’d been easily distracted, and had allowed that distraction to blind him to some harsh realities. Of course Potter hadn’t asked him on a date. They were – they
“Um,” said Harry, as Susan walked away. “Not to sound stupid, but what does bisexual mean?” There hadn’t been much sex ed at Hogwarts, and the Dursley’s had treated anything other than being straight as if it was some kind of unmentionable disease. He really hoped it wasn’t another kink thing – he was still trying to bleach his brain after Blaise had explained what a “golden shower” was.
at his chest, Potter touching him in the hallways of the Manor while Draco tried to warn him about Nagini but he couldn’t speak, he couldn’t. Potter pressing kisses to his neck, Potter falling into Feindfyre beneath him. The days were better, but not by much – Draco would be innocently trying to eat a salad and suddenly there would be Potter in his head, whispering
The Sunday before lectures started, Harry finally got around to going up to London and meeting with Ron. They went to a Muggle pub, because Harry was famous in an itchy, unpleasant way now, and Ron was not without his own fans.
Not very Gryffindor at all.
“It was fine,” said Blaise firmly. “Susan was just – “
“Yeah? Sorry, were we loud? I’m not – um, I didn’t realise.”
“You have a Ravenclaw harem.”
“Greengrass – “
Blaise leaned back on his chair. “So “they” is actually “us.””
Draco rolled his eyes. “You insufferable Gryffindors. Fine. One kiss.”
“A Curriculum Vitae. It’s Latin for – oh, don’t worry. It means that he’s trying to get a job.”
Pansy and Greengrass whooped and cheered. Theo groaned and put his head in his hands. Fuck it, Harry thought, and joined in on the cheering.
“I’m not trying to catch you out,” said Parvati. “I’m trying to understand.”
“But Draco, how does that make me better than you? Wait, I mean, not that – “
“Don’t,” she said. “Parvati says it’s brilliant. She’s been really good to me, considering how much of a bitch I was to her in week one. She’s been helping me do my make-up – I did my own contour tonight, and she’s really proud of me. Do I look good, Harry?”
They curled up on the bed together as Parvati poured the drinks with a generous hand.
“Ahhh, fuck,” whispered Seamus.
“Yeah. Well, I should – go and drink a hangover potion. Or two.”
Harry scowled. “So you’re trying to use her.”
“Stupid name. They will live terrible, boring lives. And we will be glorious, and brilliant and great.” He grabbed the bottle, drank from it and lifted it to Harry. “A toast to us. Bisexual and biracial and undesirable and alive.”
and swiping at Hermione’s face.
“I’m down. What time is it? I probably won’t have worked off this hangover by then, so who cares if I get a new one?”
like they were waltzing, but that simply couldn’t be the case.
“Um.”
“Fine. Why does Malfoy even need a fucking job, anyway? He’s got his manor and his trust fund and – “
“Great!” said Blaise, bounding away. Last night he’d had to be carried in by two strangers, neither of who knew his name and one who didn’t speak English. Harry was pretty sure he’d slept on the kitchen table. The man was a marvel.
“Good. Sea!”
“Isn’t that what all the girls here are doing? Fitting the female mold?”
“We’ll only be a minute,” said Blaise, as he steered Michael towards the back exit. “Potter, hold the table for us.” He bent low, dropping to a whisper. “Meet me outside in ten minutes.”
“Looking like a new-born giraffe,” said Seamus.
said a small voice in Harry’s mind, but he ignored it.
“Self-acceptance. Things get better.”
“So she says,” muttered Draco. “Well, the lest said about that the better. Your cock is poking me in the back, Potter.”
There was something gluing Hermione to the spot. It was rage. White hot molten fury that welded her feet to the floor in Michael’s path.
Blaise pinched his nose. “Harry. They are dates. Your friend is dating three boys at the same time, all of whom are friends, and sooner or later it’s going to devolve into an ugly fist fight. Do you not think you should be, maybe, talking to her about this?”
Except now he could, because this party was laid out for him too. He brushed his fingers against Draco’s.
“Luna’s my girlfriend,” she said. “Hermione mentioned something about you thinking it hysterical that all the women the Golden Trio had dated turned lesbo the second they broke up.”
“Fucking Finnegan. I mean fucking as in the adjective, not the verb. Don’t fuck Finnegan.”
“It’s eight forty-five, you fucking liar,” said Hermione. “Come in, then. Oh, wait, don’t. I need to throw up. I’ll be right back.”
“Fuck,” said Draco. He scrubbed his face. “It was really, really good sex. Fantastic. Glad we got that out of our system. Now, you have twenty seconds to give me any thoughts you might have on the matter, and then we’re going to leave this bed and never ever talk about it again.”
“I think Blaise is coming back,” said Dean, clearly a lie. “Maybe you should go. You’re pretty pissed right now, Seamus. You might end up getting buggered in the hedge.”
“He did his NEWTS under house arrest,” said Hermione in the clipped tones she used for shutting down conversations. “And I hear he’s studying Law too.”
when they fucked him in that sneering tone of voice that sent sparks right down his cock. Somebody else who sucked him harder when her curled his hands in their hair and called them
fun,” said Harry, “but it’s bedtime, so – “
“Yep.”
Draco laughed, low and rueful. “I think all of us, with the exception of Blaise who was always a supernaturally lucky sod, are pretty traumatised. Maybe not Hermione. She doesn’t seem like the type who’d have time for flashbacks.” He pointed at Ron’s arms. “Can I ask how Weasley got those scars?”
the Royal College. Personally, I’m a big fan of overseas study. Broadens the mind.”
“Nope,” said Susan. “They need to have this conversation. I can’t stand this much teenage angst any longer. Also shh now, I’m snooping.”
They were all right, the Slytherins, Harry realised. Odd, sure, and compulsively mean to each other, but there was a certain softness underneath the meanness that shone through. Maybe if they’d been born a generation earlier, or a generation later, they’d all have gotten on at school. Or maybe adulthood had just blunted the sharp edges of their personalities, made it possible for Ron to be calm and Blaise to be bearable and Draco to be – well, Draco was still pretty similar, actually, but he wasn’t a terrorist anymore.
“And then there’s our glorious saviour,” said Blaise, and Harry shrank into his chair. He really, really didn’t want to be snogged by Blaise Zabini. For one thing, Ron, and for another thing, Draco. “So dashing, so handsome. Who wouldn’t want to swoon in his arms? And Weasley, of course – another hero, and with the biceps to match. Pans – “
“We can only have two non-student guests per person,” said Harry.
“Right,” said Pansy, and the atmosphere dropped around five thousand degrees. “That’s quite a change for you, isn’t it?”
She stroked his back fondly. “Let me tell you something, Finnegan, something I worked out when I was sixteen and I had to start living at Hogwarts full time because my mother wouldn’t let me come back home. You can survive just fine if the whole world hates you, but you can’t live at odds with yourself. Don’t waste any time trying.”
“I might now,” said Greg, looking at her as if he’d found religion. Ginny and Harry shared hysterical looks. Draco came to settle at Harry’s shoulders, pulling him tight aggressively. It wasn’t as if the Weaslette was likely to want him back, but there was no harm reminding her that she couldn’t.
Draco laughed bitterly. “Yes, it was.”
“I’m not sitting down there,” said Draco, standing opposite Harry, “because this cupboard is filthy, and I’ve already ruined one pair of trousers. So you’ll have to stand.”
She laughed. “Oh, I had a fair few nights of those.”
“Maybe I do.” Seamus’s eyes were fierce. “Maybe I fucking do, maybe I don’t care how wrong it is – “
“Riiiiight,” said Parvati. “Well, I’m not sure where you got the idea that Morag’s celibate from. She’s almost as bad as Blaise.”
“Er, sorry,” said Harry. “I should – oh, Dean, please don’t cry.”
And she stormed away, leaving Blaise still clutching a tea cup and staring after her.
“A degree in not being Snape,” said Seamus, and Harry forced his mind back to the sunny train compartment. “Will wonders never cease. Hey, you don’t happen to know who else is in our flat, do you?”
Draco laughed and shifted. Harry was leaning back against the wall now, with Draco’s head pillowed on his shoulder. He ran his hands soothingly up and down Draco’s back.
“Um,” said Harry. Perhaps now his brilliant lying powers would show up. “I had to convince him that – that – uh – that he couldn’t win you back?”
“Not the way I care about you. And oh, have I
Harry leant over and traced the long slashes of Sectumsempra across his chest. There was another one, high on his bicep, which he guessed was from Buckbeak. “And the body they’re on. Does this one still hurt?”
Doomed. They were all so very doomed.
can be the one to get out.”
Harry interrupted his mental calculation by brushing his thumb over Draco’s pinky. God,
“You know what?” Seamus stood up, pushing himself into Dean’s space. “Maybe I should. There’s lots of things I don’t need to see.”
“Yeah,” said Ron, smiling softly. “She’s funny, isn’t she? Anyway, I can’t blame her if she goes for Malfoy. He’s rich, he’s tall, he’s probably got all the same posh-bitch mates as her. Plus he’s got a title.”
“Homework and tears.”
“How come we didn’t get that speech?” said Dean.
“Abominable. Disastrous. Shit. I can’t believe I’m arranging a party in honour of Susan Bones. Blaise keeps on trying to get me to go on these secret missions to find out what her favourite colour is, or what kind of tinsel she likes best. Like somehow me asking it will be more discreet.”
“Oi, Finnegan.” There was Draco, with a bottle of wine in his hand. “Come drink with me.”
“Anything else to say? Any thoughts on that?”
Well. There was symmetry in the world.
“This is fun!” said Hermione, clutching her drink closer. She’d bought her own bottle of wine, and was keeping it in her handbag. “Isn’t this fun, Harry?”
“I could tell.”
about you. Obsessing over you at school, getting more and more frantic with every scrap of attention you poured away from me and towards the war. Doing my NEWTS at the manor and cutting out each press clipping, burning inside and wondering if you were thinking about me at all, or if you were too busy enjoying your victory. And then this year you had the audacity to actually – to look at me –“
“I don’t dance,” said Hermione, and Parvati got a wicked look and said “Is that so?”
There was a peeling green door in one of the science building walls, half hanging off its hinges, and when he and Parvati had kicked it open last night they’d found a deep cupboard, completely bare and surprisingly spider free, where they’d chain-smoked in comfort when a late-September mizzle started as Harry bitched about Malfoy.
They arrived at a dingy street corner, disturbing a couple who were very clearly about five seconds away from shagging. They scattered after a harsh look from Blaise. Harry thought about asking questions, but Blaise was tugging him along, through the alleyways and into a dark doorway that turned out to be the back entrance of a bar. A really, really dodgy bar. Not that Harry had much basis for comparison, but a place this grimy and miserable only attracted customers who valued discretion on the part of the staff above clean tables and nice beer.
“Nothing!” he yelled, and then he’d remembered. The joy of pulling a patronus out of someone who’d sworn up and down they couldn’t do it, the thrill of refereeing a duel. “Well. Dumbledore’s Army. That was all me. But I don’t think we really need any adolescent militias anymore, do we?”
“Yeah,” said Draco. “Fuck.”
“Of course,” she said, “and you too.” She was still smiling as she closed the door behind her and threw herself into her books.
“Hey guys,” said Morag, poking her head out of the kitchen door. “I’ve got some great gossip. Did you know Ginny’s dating Luna?”
“That’s not true.”
Harry smiled back, but the truth was he only really knew Weatherspoons as the place that Dudley and his mates went out to underage drink.
“For fuck’s sake, Greg.” He put his head in his hands. His friends were awful. “No, not since third year, that was back when I still hated him. Since – since – “ When had it been since? He couldn’t really pinpoint a start date. “Since two weeks ago, probably. And what did you mean, you thought you told me?”
Harry had shot him a look over Granger’s head, fond and amused, and Draco had smiled back as if they were the kind of people who did that, stood together and laughed at the rest of the world.
Ron and Harry both made a chocked noise.
“He really does look like you,” Harry whispered in his ear.
“Maybe you should do something like that,” said Harry. “I mean, maybe something less violent. And don’t hurt any dragons.”
“Hey, Hermione. Hey, Harry. How’s things?”
She took the next day off to study, and then met up with Terry after lectures for a coffee to politely end things with him.
“Why’s that?”
Halfway through
“And on Wednesday she had lunch with Michael Corner and then drinks with Anthony, again.”
“I’m number six. Try not to keep me up all night with your wild Gryffindor parties.” His smile was slow and teasing.
“Merlin no, I’ve learnt my lesson there. After about five times. And a sixth that he lied to me about. I just feel fantastic this morning. I feel – “ He stopped for a moment. “I feel like everything is finally going my way. Like just this once I might get what I want.”
The Last-Hurrah-of-Gryffindor was in a small muggle pub called The London Stone, which Dean had picked at random and which turned out to be a total shithole. Seamus spent over thirty minutes choosing a drink, and probably longer painstakingly counting out the Muggle money for his pint. He paid at least half of it in coppers. The stone-faced Northerner behind the bar looked like he was ready to commit murder.
“He’d probably look like he did when I told him that Malfoy fancies you – “
“What?” said Ron.
Blaise scoffed. “I’m as serious about her as a man of my calibre can be. Oh come, let us not talk of serious things. A club opening, you say? Run by a Weasley? This will be a riot.”
She shrugged. “I’m being philosophical about it. Which means that I don’t want to hear about it, and neither do Seamus and Dean.”
“Anything.”
She’d broken up with Ron to have sex.
“Nah. Did it myself, back in forth year. Me, Rivers and Lovegood were very briefly in a band, and I thought it might add to our edgy image.”
“We’re on a stake-out tonight, Harry. A four-hour stakeout.”
“- and the fact that their ancestral forest homes are being turned into summer houses for rich pure-blood wizards is disgusting, Zabini.”
“It’s always a pleasure to be beaten by an accomplished opponent.” He smiled, and shifted her books. “Sorry, I should let you get on with studying. Knock on my door if you want to grab a drink, yeah?”
“Yes. Next time I have feelings, I will definitely tell you all about them.” God, when had he become such a horrible liar?
“Fuck off.”
“Sure you were. I’m sure that I absolutely destroyed your night. Those three dances you had with Gabrielle Delacour were probably just balm for your aching soul.”
“Give it a rest, Parkinson. It was a polite question, and Harry’s not used to you. Maybe go easy, yeah?”
“Thank you.”
Harry nodded, hoping to keep attention off him, and thankfully it turned away. Pansy dared Daphne to lick the table, which after much gagging and mocking she finally did, and Dean laughingly confessed to having released all the animals he caught in traps during his year on the run because he felt bad for them, and a red-faced Theo had admitted to being the actual mastermind behind the slogan “Potter Stinks” – “because Draco was going on and on about finding the perfect thing that would emotionally crucify you, and I just couldn’t take it anymore.”
He smiled. “And your friends. I want us both to be in there, with our friends.” He took a sip of his own drink – some disgusting lager. “What’s up?”
“It’s not,” said Harry. “I know it’s not. I’m sorry you felt like that. And I’m sorry that I’ve made you feel so humiliated. I’m sorry that I’ve sometimes enjoyed you feeling like that, over the years. It’s not something I’m proud of, I promise you. And – And I’m really sorry about Crabbe. Vincent. He didn’t deserve that.”
“I was so afraid you’d say that. Well, that leaves us with option two. In this, you stay at the Royal College for a few more weeks with everyone absolutely loathing you. Over the Christmas holidays I will go and visit my mother in Italy. While there, we’ll stop off at a lovely little place we know in Venice. It’s one of her favourite shops. And when I come back, you will have a cup of tea or a pint of beer or a plate of toast, something you’ve prepared yourself, something you’re sure no one could have tampered with. And then you will tragically drop dead of a heart attack. It’s such a tragedy when these things happen to the young. Don’t you agree, Potter?”
“I bet Ron’s just wearing a Weasley jumper,” said Harry. “At least I’ll look better than him.”
“No. But if you want to – “
Michael’s stuff disappeared from his dorm-room one night, along with Michael. Harry found Susan leaning against the doorway one day, looking into the empty room.
“No,” he said. “Oh, no. Absolutely not. I refuse.
“You…were?” She tried to keep her cool. These days, seeing him didn’t bring back any memories of his hideous house, or of mad cackling laughter. She’d done a good job of telling herself that he’d suffered too, they all had under the Dark Lord, it was time to move on. It was telling that she always got stuck on the fact that he’d
“Never say never, Draco. I’ll find a way.”
“Maybe he just felt guilty,” he said.
“Because he’ll – you know. He’ll get us drunk and try and have his way with us.”
“Ah hah!” Ron pointed a finger at him. “So she could end up seeing Malfoy as well! The slimy cock. I bet he’s got loads of plans to find her at a vulnerable moment and strike. You know him. I bet he goes all smooth when he’s got his eye on someone.”
“You can’t!” His voice cracked. He stared at Harry with boiling anguish. “Please, Harry. This friendship with you – it's one of – I wake up in the mornings and I roll out of bed and see the face of a horrible rotten bastard in the mirror, and I want to die. But then I think
“If it helps, I told the guy behind the counter that I made it all up.” He had, actually. That had been a horrifically awkward conversation, and only Hermione’s frosty glare from their table had made him go through with it. He thought that might help but Malfoy just rolled his eyes and groaned.
“I promise,” said Michael. “Please, I promise - “
“Imagine,” said Dean, with a theatrical flourish, “imagine if someone had, I don’t know, asked me to draw a portrait of you – “
“I’d make a fantastic match-maker,” she said to Blaise, when they were waiting for a pint at the next pub night.
“You and Blaise are together?” said Dean. “That’s great.”
“Tastiest dig I’ve ever had.”
“I do,” she whispered, and let herself sink into the unique torment of Parvati’s embrace.
“Huh? No. I think you’ll always be Potter to me, though. Don’t expect that to change.”
“I get it,” said Parvati, nodding. “Things can only be casual for so long. I reckon Michael was going to ask you to pick him soon.”
“Oh Jesus,” said Draco. “He’s not going to propose, is he? I understand he’s in love, but really, it’s a little early.”
“The Ravenclaw?” Ron bit his lip. “Well. It’s good that she ended up with someone as smart as she is.”
“Who are we looking for?” he whispered.
“Fine.” He tried not to obviously panic. They weren’t obvious, were they? Sure, there had been that time the whole block had gone to the pub and he and Draco had ended up in the loos trading hand-jobs, but he thought they’d pulled it together convincingly afterwards. “How are you and Seamus?”
“We’ve got to give Potter all his awkward first weed experiences,” said Morag. She was smiling in a way that promised terrifying things.
“Jesus wept,” said Blaise. “Come on, Seamus. Coffee run.”
Draco made a sound that might have been
“You really should apologise to her, you know.”
“Want to take bets on what tomorrow’s Prophet headline will be?”
He showered quickly, dressed himself in a nice pair of robes. It was only Sunday, but he’d been allowing his standards to slip. Padding round the flat in just his pyjamas, thinking of it all as his
“Because telling people how you feel is important, Ron! Take this as a piece of advice for the next poor girl you date – you need to just – just – “
“Why do you always have to make things so difficult?” Harry shouted, and Draco cackled with his head thrown back.
“You’re amazing,” he whispered, thrusting faster, unable to stop himself. “You’re so amazing.”
“Rest in piss,” said Blaise, crossing himself.
“Oi,” said Harry. “I’m sure Parvati’s not oblivious.”
Pansy Parkinson stood behind them, tapping her blood red nails on a champagne flute.
“Of course you are! I think you have a lot of expertise.”
“Sorry, sorry. Wow, hangovers really do away with my normal tact. Harry, it’s good Malfoy’s changed, but was this really worth getting me up so early for?”
“And how many have died under mysterious circumstances?”
“There, there.” Ron patted his shoulder, his fingers tangling with Hermione’s curls in the process. “Don’t worry, I’m sure life will still be terrible in small ways. I mean, your boyfriend is a raving lunatic who’s currently arguing with Padma over colour palettes, and Hermione’s girlfriend has an evil twin, and Pansy is – “
“It’s going to be spectacular!” said Blaise, who grabbed Harry outside his last lecture. “The stage is set. My outfit is picked. I’ve adjusted the lights so they’ll show off my complexion at its most delectable. The music will be soft and low and romantic. I have everything – fuck, I’ve forgotten something.”
“I think it might be a bit complicated for him.”
Draco slammed his book shut. “For god’s sake, Blaise, have you really not learnt your lesson about saying the first thing that comes to mind?”
Blaise snorted. “And with such a heartfelt and assured declaration, how could we doubt? All right, Potter, it’s your turn. Pick your victim.”
Had he seen, long before Harry, just how much this was beginning to matter? Had he tried to warn him?
“Nah, I get it.” Seamus kicked the bed idly. “I was coming here to apologise, you know? But I guess this is how it’s gonna be now. Is this what turned you bi, Dean? Seven years touching your prick after lights out, waiting for Harry to notice you? Thank god I fucked off earlier so you could make your move.”
“You look fit, Hermione,” Seamus said, slurring over her. Half his beer was seeping into his shirt. “You know, it’s kind of funny remembering I used to have a crush on you.”
“Right,” said Theo. “Blaise, it’s your turn to be humiliated.”
It didn’t matter, really, that Anthony had called her beautiful. It wouldn’t have mattered if everyone at this party had gotten down on bended knee and sung praises to her radiance, because Parvati didn’t want her. She’d known this, but now she
“Why would I be hurt?” Hermione yelled. “I mean, I’m happy for you – “
“You ask far too many questions. Are you sure you didn’t miss your calling as an auror? Anyway, enough about me. What about you, Harry? Planning anything romantic for Saturday?”
“Well, I mean – his dad was – he was part of the Inquisitorial Squad!”
“Fair enough. Seamus, you really do have the most lovely colouring. But I think there’s only one person here who really combined grace, class and a fabulous ass.” He stopped. “Dean, would you do me the honour of making me the happiest man in this pub?”
“I gotta go,” said Ron, breaking Harry’s miserable reverie. “I’ve got an essay to write for Friday. A bloody essay, Harry, in auror training. Bet George wouldn’t have made me write essays if I went to the shop.”
Blaise was settling next to Michael on the bench, throwing one arm round his shoulders and Harry, who privately thought he might have been having a stroke, took the chair opposite.
“I don’t know,” said Harry. “I might – whoops, there’s a branch – I might have to. I’m not sure. I got a boner while talking to Draco. Is that good?”
“We didn’t really have those,” said Harry. “Anytime any of us suggested breaking the rules, Neville got all twitchy.”
“Oh.” Draco coughed. “Good for her. She can do better than you.”
“If you’re sure you’re all right,” said Dean, but Blaise just waved him off. He made his way back to the dancefloor. He couldn’t see Seamus, but that was all right. He’d promised. He wouldn’t go back on that. He wasn’t in the part of the dancefloor he’d left him in, but maybe he’d just got pushed around by the dancers. He would be here. He had to be.
“Let’s talk about quidditch!” said Dean, overly cheerful. “Or, uh, football. Fuck!”
evil.”
“Ahh.” Blaise’s smile was sickening. “But you can crawl.”
“Corner! Come to lick your wounds? Thought you might want some company.”
Hermione lost her composure then, and had to quickly turn her giggle into a cough when the three girls turned round and stared at her, but Harry couldn’t find it funny. He wondered if there would ever be a time when a mention of a black dog – not even a man turning into one, just
“Which explains
“What Pansy here is trying to say,” said Draco, grinding his teeth, “is that everyone my mother has picked out for me to marry is my cousin, to some degree.”
Malfoy bared his teeth. “Because you would never,
“Unacceptable. You, Susan Bones, deserve to be frolicked to the point of collapse.”
“Merlin’s beard, Susan.” Blaise’s grip on the top of the chair was tight. “It was just a kiss. I’m not sure what you’re so upset about.”
“It was weird,” she said. “But we’re over that now. You should come visit us at uni more often.”
The first thought Draco had when he woke up in the morning was that he needed to take stock of his life.
“Uh, truth,” said Harry, because he fancied he knew Blaise quite well by now, and he didn’t feel like getting arrested this evening.
“Hey, ‘Mione. Hi, Draco, you look – “
“I don’t know,” said Blaise. “I mean, he’s my friend and I live here. But I imagine after tonight he’ll ask me to go over to theirs instead.”
“Hermione says feelings are good.”
“You ok?” said Lee, but Harry didn’t hear him. Couldn’t, over the rising drum-beat in his head.
“Nope!” said Harry cheerfully, and resolved not to think about
“Right.”
“Can’t we just have a conversation like normal people?” said Draco. His eyes slid over to Harry, and somehow that warmed him inside, the two of them despairing over their friends like this.
“Zabini I will murder you and leave your body for the crows –“
TRIGGER WARNING
“If we went by her count the family reputation would have more lives than a kneazle. It’s kind of nice to be the son that isn’t fucking up for once. Anyway – George, nightclub. Will you come? It would mean a lot to him.”
“Oh, I wish I could. I’d love to be difficult. But as it turns out, I’m very easy when it comes to you. So I’ll ask again – on my knees, or up against the wall?”
“Great,” said Malfoy, frosty again. “You’re digging into my personal life. Well, turnabouts fair play, Potter. Why did you break up with the she-weasel? Finally realised you have about as much chemistry with her as you do with a chopped flobberworm? She get bored of two round of lights-off missionary position a month? Or did she just finally realise you’re an insufferable priss?”
She blinked. “If I wanted to talk about Harry, I’d talk to Harry.” This was, of course, a bald-faced lie. If she wanted to talk about Draco in excruciating detail, she would go to Harry. She imagined the same was true in reverse. She was proved right, of course. In a sense. Draco spent the entire coffee date talking about how he was
“I’m sure you’d look devastating in yellow, Bones. Anyway, you can’t denounce a dress based just on the colour. Look at the girl leaning against the sound system. What a bloody mess. Oh, colour-wise it’s fine – “
“No resolutions for me, I think,” he said. “I’m just going to keep doing what I’m doing.”
“I think about you too,” he said. “All the time. What do I do in your head?”
“It’s a Sunday,” said Harry, but he was ignored.
“Why would I need to accept Malfoy?” said Ron, sounding pained. Hermione stuttered and turned red.
“She is?”
“It probably wouldn’t be very romantic to make a move on her in the kitchen.”
“Jesus,” said Parvati, wrinkling her nose. “Have you built a nest? Is that –  you have seven cups of tea balanced on stacks of books. Are any of them hot?”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
And there had been Seamus with Hannah, but he wasn’t thinking about that.
“Come onnnnnnn. It will be just like Eclectic, remember? Wasn’t that fun? We looked good together.”
Draco grinned. “I thought we were the evil house.”
“Well,” said Daphne. “I’m not sure any dare can beat the drama of that. Shall we play Kings?”
“Draco – “
She smiled and ground out her cigarette. “They’re little death sticks anyway.”
“Wait,” said Harry. “You snogged Malfoy?”
“Do you want to go out for breakfast?”
“It’s a hypothetical,” said Harry. “Just thinking. Throwing out some theories.”
“Good.” Blaise stood. “Glad we had this little talk.”
“What, cause I’m so thick?” said Harry. “Says something about you that you were beaten by me, doesn’t it?”
“She’s not receptive, then?”
“I’m guessing a lot?”
“I’ve got some stuff to apologise for as well, I reckon.”
“Oh god,” he whispered. “You did it. You did fuck my brains out.”
“Oh, I just popped by to invite you to George’s club opening,” said Harry. He expected a bigger reaction from Blaise – it was a night of dancing, drink and wasted young women after all – but all he got was a muttered “Fabulous.”
Ron shrugged. “Oh, she’s still a bitch, but it’s muted. I’m actually a bit worried about her.”
They bought a bottle of vodka and a bottle of coke, mixing them in the bottle and sharing it in long swigs. Harry bought a packet of cigarettes too – he’d quite liked smoking while drunk, which seemed a little dangerous, but they felt thematically appropriate. The walk home was about an hour, but it took them through some of the prettiest parts of Windsor Great Park, and it gave Dean time to get a proper buzz.
“You’re not supposed to know about that. And I’m just a fuck, didn’t you know? Harry’s just working out his sexuality. I’m not bitter.” He cracked his can and pushed himself upwards to drink. “I don’t want anything else either. I wanted a friendship, and now I have sex, which I also want. So really, my cup overfloweth.”
“The answer, from the bottom of my heart, is both.”
“You heard?”
“Oi,” said Seamus. “We’re men now.”
“No.” Draco’s eyes were impossibly lovely and sad. “When you did it – I felt relieved. That’s a horribly fucked up thing to say, isn’t it?”
“I told him I was bi, you know. You probably guessed. And he said
“Just because we spent years as best friends doesn’t mean you know everything about me.  There are many things you don‘t, and many of them will surprise you, because I have hidden depths. And number two, I hate the way you act like every conversation we have about our feelings is some awful torture that I’m forcing upon you, rather than a necessary part of any friendship, or relationship for that matter.”
“Hey,” said Parvati, grabbing her hand. She was swaying slightly. “Come dance with me.”
“I mean, I’m planning to break it to them gently,” she said. “I was just so worried about this talk, you know?”
“Hello, Harry,” said Nott. “Say, is Malfoy over? I thought I heard him.”
“I’m not doing so great either, you know. And I don’t know if you saw that in there, but he doesn’t want to talk to me.”
“But she’s right,” said Hannah. “I know you go full throttle at anything Hermione, but he didn’t commit a crime. There’s nothing we can do.”
“Hey,” said Draco and Blaise as one.
“I’m sorry, ‘Mione, but we really need to talk about it, ok?”
“Are these flowers ugly?” said Blaise, shoving a bouquet into Harry’s face.
He couldn’t move. He couldn’t move, and clearly Draco couldn’t move either. It was kind of like that Muggle movie, with the T-Rex – they can’t see you if you’re not moving. Or maybe that was Velociraptors. Draco was more like a Velociraptor anyway. He should learn more about dinosaurs.
“Pansy suggested it, really, so you should listen to her – “
“Sounds great,” said Harry. “Hey, so I thought I was wrong about Malfoy, but - ”
“Sure,” said Dean.
and you decide that that’s your standard, and you hold up every single action to it.”
“I only smoke Cubans, Harry, and I’m not wasting them on your baby smoking habit.” He strode off, and Harry waited outside for a little bit, wondering when he’d become such an irredeemable bore, before following.
The last time they’d gone dancing, Hermione had trodden on his toes eight times and broken another dancer’s nose.
Michael was realising the extent of his mistake now. He glanced between Anthony and Nott, face pleading. “Oh come on, seriously? You’re going to act like I’m some kind of monster just because I –“
Seamus had been able to say those things. Dean had always been so careful.
“No one’s saying Voldemort wasn’t smart, for fuck’s sake.”
They were so, so close now. Malfoy’s eyes were the only thing he could see.
Let it go.”
There was a moment where the library seemed to hold its breath, where their back and forth reached its natural point, and Harry was seized with the sudden urge to – to take Malfoy’s hand, to smile, to laugh, something that would mark this moment and keep it. He leant forward again, and Malfoy jerked a bit, his astonishing eyes going through ten different changes as he moved forward, then quickly away.
as much as you do. Feeling you get off, the sounds you make.”
“But, you know, we’re not – “ said Harry, only to be totally ignored.
“Sod romance,” said Blaise. “In your pants, Harry. Everyone else is using uni as a way of expanding their sexual horizons, and you’re – “
“Draco, hey, I tried to find you – “
“Honestly?”
Parvati snorted. “Oh come on, just one of you I could understand, but all three? Look, she’s lovely, but she’s not exactly a stunner.”
“That’s terrifying,” said Harry. “I thought you were thinking all kinds of clever stuff, and it was just me thinking ‘fuck’.”
He’d almost decided not to go to university. He’d almost decided not to do anything, or rather decided not to make a decision. Ron had been going into auror training, and Harry had gone to one taster day and then gone back to Hogwarts shaking and thrown up a bit in the loo. Hermione had been ploughing through prospectus after prospectus in a way that seemed designed to stop her thinking about her new single life. Harry had spent most of his time lying on his back in front of the lake, basking in the May sunshine and hoping that McGonagall wouldn’t find him.
“What.”
he can’t do that. All he’ll do is hang around the edges being a sad sack, and that will probably help cheer you up.”
“You snogged Potter?” said Malfoy, head swivelling between them.
But Draco was already striding towards the door. He paused. “I know you’re bad at respecting boundaries, Potter, but you need to respect this one. Else I promise you, I’ll just disappear.”
but I never knew how to make my paintings more cinematic, if you catch my drift.”
“It’s going to be hysterical,” said Morag when Harry found her smoking outside the front gate, and refused to elaborate further.
“Sure, no problem,” said Harry, not looking up as he began to frantically scribble his essay plan.
Finally, this chapter might be a little shorter than the others, and the next one will be too. They were initially one super chapter, but it got so long that I felt they needed to be split up.
Except Malfoy apparently preferred to bankrupt himself rather than admit defeat, because he just lifted his chin and started taking orders, and then announced that a round of shots for everyone seemed to be quite within the spirit of the night to general cheers and Hermione’s protests. He headed off to the bar, his face grim, and Harry couldn’t help himself. Bloody saviour complex.
“I wouldn’t be seen dead with any of you tossers,” said Morag, shoving her hands in her pockets and strolling off up the red carpet of doom, pausing only to flip off Rita Skeeter.
“We thought you were the heir of Slytherin. Sorry about that too, I guess.”
“Draco Malfoy was evil,” said Hermione. “Blaise was just vaguely smarmy sometimes.”
“Would it have made a difference, Potter? You’ve already decided what to think of me. You’ve had eight years of choosing what to think of me. I was eleven years old the first time you decided I was scum, I hadn’t even done anything yet. You didn’t even know me. I was being nice. What is the point of grovelling, Potter? What is the point of humiliating myself even further? You’re never going to change your opinion.”
You won, and you’re still fucked off at me, and I don’t care to find out why.”
“She pulled,” said Hannah. Despite the fact that she was more stable than Seamus, she was clearly only very slightly more sober. “Copping off with some American.”
“That’s me,” said Daphne, with an enchanting giggle. She leant forward, a cloud of perfume and silk and breasts. Morag focused heavily on her breathing. “Draco says you’re a lesbian. That must be terribly exciting.”
“Really? We actually ended it mutually.”
“What?”
Malfoy made an even smaller sound that was probably a yes.
Hermione couldn’t help herself. Later, she’d barely be able to remember why she did it. It was the alcohol and the poison inside her mingling and pushing out of her mouth to say –
“Pub lunch. This is going to be great, I promise you. All right, I’ll leave you to Pansy.”
“No,” said Harry, “but I won’t push you. Not if you don’t want me to. And – for what it’s worth, every day I get to see you is a good one, too. I wish we’d stop being so fucking polite to each other, but that’s just the way it goes, I guess.”
“Oh no, I’m not falling for that.”
Hermione shivered, and the two of them closed around her, wrapping her in their warmth.
“Ugliest dress,” said Blaise.
The man curled his lip at Harry in a way that suggested he hoped the pub would go up in flames. Malfoy was biting his lip and suppressing his laughter.
“Accio beer,” he said, and the whole case came flying into his hands. “Well. That quickens things. I’m sorry about Pansy.”
“Yeah. In a nice way, mostly. You ever just scream?”
“Yes,” sighed Draco, “but what a way to go.”
“Potter!” said Blaise, pushing apart the tree they were in. “Are you – oh, no. Absolutely not. Pansy, seriously? Tonight is too important to mess up, so if you two must have life ruining sex – “
“Yeah.”
“You’re so lucky you found love young, like us,” she’d said, dreamily. “I’ve only ever been with one man, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. You never have to worry about all that dating or messing around or settling down. You two know exactly what you want.”
“Little bit. I know what you mean, though. About being the nice one. Always having to look out for people’s feelings around you. It doesn’t leave any room for your own.”
“I’m gay,” said Draco. “When you asked me why I would never date you, that first day. I’m gay.”
“I don’t fucking want to be together. I want to punch someone in the face. Seamus!”
There was Malfoy, standing in the doorway, looking very small and very pale. Harry felt a swoop of fear, then a surge of anger. What had he fucking expected, after pushing Harry away? How dare he stand there, shaking like the first day he’d seen him? How dare he look so broken? It wasn’t Harry’s fault. None of this was his fault.
“She’s dancing with Weasley.”
Blaise and Susan looked around, panicked.
“How dare he. How fucking dare he, Dean. He doesn’t have the right – “
“So I fucked things up for you again.”
“Malfoy.”
Harry Potter,” just to have something to aim all his anger at.
Sea had said.
“IfIcouldinviteMalfoy,” said Harry, all in a rush. “Seeing as we’re inviting the whole flat. It just feels a bit unfair to leave him out. And Blaise and Nott. I mean, it’s cool if not. Totally cool.”
thing she’d done was jump out of a third-floor window to catch a perp, and he now thought she was brilliant. He supposed it was nice that Pansy appeared to be making up for her actions, but most of Ron’s stories seemed to revolve around her being a menace to society.
“Fuck you,” said Michael, and Blaise stamped on his leg hard. Something cracked, and Michael howled.
“It wasn’t a date.”
One night, eighth year, both the only ones in bed with a bottle of vodka between them.
“Sure,” said Neville. “I could dance.”
Pansy Parkinson stood alone in the rain, her hair slicked to her face like a skull cap, shivering in her inappropriate clothes. Her face was a terrible blank.
“Courtyard, now!” said a voice from inside.
“Yeah, ‘tis the season,” said Hannah. “Let’s see some love.”
Blaise turned and sputtered at him. Terry looked like he was choking on his coffee and Morag, the cow, was laughing at him. “I’m sorry. What?”
“Aren’t you going to ask why I love you?”
“You could make a move this Saturday.”
“I want the nicest one,” he said, and she plonked two shots of something black that smelt like coffee in front of him. He raised a toast to Draco and then tossed it back without waiting. Draco, looking irritated, did the same. It did not taste like coffee. It tasted a lot like petrol.
That one sent Dean off the log, and they were laughing and stumbling across the path, shouting fruit based innuendos at each other.
“Did you always know he wasn’t your dad?”
“You did?” said Harry, looking delightedly at Draco. “Have you told Ron?”
“I did, didn’t I. And you know what I got? I got Ron screaming at me and lots of articles written about how pretty I was that night, all with a nasty undertone of
“And…?”
“Seamus, don’t,” said Harry, but Dean held him back.
“All right. In that case, I definitely pulled you here so that I could have my wicked way with you.” That got him a watery laugh and a middle finger. “Look, Pansy. I’ll try and talk to Draco tonight, all right? But – I cannot stress this enough – he will likely tell me to fuck off and die. So no promises.”
“Blowback,” snickered Morag. “I blame you for that one, Parvati. After you introduced it to Padma, everyone in Ravenclaw turned into proper pot-heads in sixth year just for an excuse to nearly make out.”
this. It doesn’t matter how strong we are. It’s not about that.”
“Mary Oliver.” She leant into Hermione, her beautiful hair brushing across their shoulders. “That one reminds me of you, you know. The ‘you do not have to be good,’ part. You push yourself so hard. Always having to know the right answer.”
“The very one. Well done on nearly sealing the deal, old boy. She does make things hard, doesn’t she? I suppose you heard about her little fit of dramatics at Eclectic. What’s the world coming to, when a man can’t make a simple pass without being treated like a monster?”
“Right,” sighed Theo. “Of course, because we’re all taking advice from the Gryffindor’s now. Why wouldn’t we? They’re our new best friends, fuck everything that happened, fuck the past – “
“Oi,” said Blaise.
And then the table descended into awkward silence until Dean, hero that he was, pulled out a pack of playing cards and asked everyone if they wanted to see the brill drinking game that Blaise had taught them last night.
“Oh how funny you know that. Is this what all those Draco Malfoy fact-finding missions were about? You creating the perfect atmosphere for me to be overwhelmed by gratitude to you for saving me so I could fall into your bed?”
Harry grinned. “Thought you’d never ask, Malfoy.”
“Nature calling.”
“Why would it be humiliating? Was it humiliating with Hermione?”
“I dunno. I might be a better student, I suppose.” He scoured a line into the tabletop with his fingernail. “I like to think we wouldn’t have hated each other as much. Gryffindor and Slytherin. I mean yeah, you were pretty shitty pre-teens. But I bet you were a cool seventeen year old aside from the blood prejudice. Some of the stories Blaise tells are pretty funny. Sometimes I wish - “ He stopped.
am I not used to being lonely?”
“No?” You absolutely could, her eyes were still red around the edges, but he needed to talk to Draco, he needed to –
He reached for Draco as Draco reached for him, and they collided in a mess of teeth and lips and rain. And possibly tears – Draco was snuffling against his mouth. His fingers were clawing raggedly at Harry’s sides. It was so much worse than their kiss before, and so much better. Harry felt rabid, unhinged. Draco bucked like a wild thing beneath his hands.
Draco muttered something about “fucking Gryffindors.” “Well, Potter, I can’t imagine kissing me is high on your Christmas list –“
keen on embarrassing my forefathers. If I wore something like that, I’d probably get haunted.”
He walked off back in the direction they’d come.
Draco was still not looking at him, but he was looking nearer him, and that was a start. “Go on.”
“Not about Draco?”
“Well,” said Harry. “I told him that Malfoy fancied you. I didn’t say – “
“I rather fit the stereotype.”
“I don’t.”
“I thought we were mad at Seamus?”
“It’s
“Shh-shh -ok.” He wiped the tears from his eyes. “Ok, look – I need a shower, and you probably need a shower, but do you want to come over after and I’ll pop on some bacon and we can – I don’t know.”
“I’ll help you out tomorrow, if I’m not too hungover.”
“Do you think Blaise is serious about Susan?” Harry asked Draco that evening, in between kisses.
“Hermione says I should apologise,” he’d said eventually, and Parvati had shrugged.
Hermione roared like a werewolf and lunged across the table. Harry grabbed at her as Draco grabbed at Pansy – who was actually
“You’re a Ravenclaw,” said Theo. “You should have a better vocabulary than that.”
about the sex, it’s not that,” said Pansy. “Is this because your date went badly?”
Stop and I’ll kill you.”
“Do you have the Morton book?” said Draco.
“You’re right,” said Seamus. “That Catholic upbringing really did a number on me.”
It was Blaise, dressed in all black and his face murderously blank. “Get your coat, Potter, you’re coming with me.”
“Can’t believe you’d give all that up.”
“Hi,” said Hermione, skidding to a stop in front of them. “Is everything all right?”
“So –please don’t take it the wrong way, I’m just asking because – well – I just – “
Malfoy waved a hand. “No, no. He called me about an hour ago asking if I wanted a trial shift later today. I’ll have plenty of time to prove my dubious morality to him in person. But thank you, I suppose. For the apology and for the reputation boost.”
“Why’d you love me?”
And then suddenly it dropped on him like an anvil. “Dean, when you were talking about straight boys, were you – “
“I don’t care,” she said. “Fuck him, Blaise. I’m just so glad you’re here.”
“It’s not much,” said Draco hurriedly, glancing at Harry sideways. “It’s just a few old charms, I kind of cobbled it together.”
“Right. But who’s in it?”
Harry looked around and agreed. The flat was lovely, with a wide open-plan space that would make a perfect dancefloor and a beautiful glass wall with a view of the river, but sitting around like this with all the food and drinks laid out untouched made him feel a bit like walking through the house right before Petunia had a dinner party, with all the nice things he wasn’t allowed to touch.
Or at least it did, until he actually reached the courtyard and Malfoy caught sight of him. The long drag he took of his cigarette looked like it was meant to fortify him, and the long sigh afterwards suggested that it didn’t help. Harry wrapped his arms around himself and belatedly remembered that he was still wearing his pyjamas, and that he was possibly too hungover to tell what was real and what was not. Well. No backing out now.
Michael made an aborted lunge for her, but Anthony stopped him with a hand. “Go to bed, Corner.”
“We’ll see who gets a talking to,” she said, voice like thunder. “
“I do respect you – “
“I didn’t fall for him!” Draco yelled at her retreating back. “I’m just – he’s always there!”
“Poor Neville, living in a dorm with you. Did you really petrify him in first year?”
“Not good,” said Dean, leaning heavily on Harry’s shoulder. “Cause of the Malfoy bit, not the boner for boys bit. Rock on, Harry. Wait, while talking?”
He looked sleep-rumpled and hungover and pitiful. Eyes that green should be illegal.
“Isn’t she just,” said Parvati, wrapping her hand around Hermione’s waist. She was looking no-less heart-stopping, and seeing as she wasn’t Hermione and therefore practically his sister, it was causing a bit of a reaction in him. She wore a tiny dress of gold mesh that seemed to barely hang on by a thin strap round her neck, hanging low and loose around her chest. There was almost no back, and she seemed to have about eight miles of legs. Her hair was in a long, sleek ponytail with red flowers wrapped around the base.
They pushed through the door of Dean’s dorm, still kissing. Harry peeled him out of his shirt. He had gorgeous abs. Maybe he should drop to his knees, suck him off. He’d never done it before, but how hard could it be?
Pansy dropped her teaspoon.
The door burst open. There was Blaise, looking desperate, wrecked. “Susan, I – Are you – Oh, love.”
“You just like watching him fail, don’t you?”
“You do.” Foreheads pressed against each other. “Do you like it?”
“Don’t you care?”
“Tomato gin for you,” said Parvati. “It’s fitting, because tomatoes are exactly what your babies with Weasley would look like. Anyway, if none of the three tickle your fancy, there’s a whole world out there of other men.”
Before he really knew what he was doing, Harry was out of his seat and storming over. He was half considering punching him, but then Malfoy turned and saw him and his expression was so cold that Harry immediately changed tack.
“Ah. So “they” singular.”
“What, when I was talking about how desperately I was in love with you?”
“Sensible nation, the Scottish,” said Dean. “What are you going to do about Susan?”
just mean Potter’s persistent stalking, which he’d apparently gotten better at since Sixth Year. It also meant in Draco’s mind. His dreams were uncomfortable prickly things, Potter sitting on his cock and whispering
All the Muggles here are on it. It makes them near unbearable. Somebody offered it to me in the loo when I went to clear them out at the end of the night.”
“Good.” Draco shoved the bottle in his direction. “Have some gin.”
“Fan-fucking-tastic. Only you, Potter. Only you could make sex a life ruining act.”
“I said Harry was. Then he left to go have sex with Draco Malfoy, who I’m pretty sure is now his boyfriend.”
He even sent a Patronus up to him the night of Halloween, asking Draco what his costume should be, and Draco couldn’t even bloody send one back. He had to stick his head out the door and ask Granger to tell Potter he could wear
“I knew that was you,” said Malfoy.
She followed his line of sight to wear Susan was talking to Michael. “Oh, Blaise. I’m sorry.”
That stopped Harry short. “Yeah, I mean. We did agree.”
“I was gay long before Potter,” he sniffed. “And I’ll still be gay long after this temporary insanity has ended.”
“I – “ said Harry, but Blaise held up his hand imperiously.
Draco laughed, and then he leant forward and kissed him softly on the side of the mouth.
“I am?”
“Well,” said Padma, giving Parvati a sly look, “I reckon you’re going to have a gooood year.” And then she giggled.
“What private thing? I have no secrets, I’m an open book. Let’s all sit down and have a drink.”
Hermione shrieked and hugged her again. “You’re a lifesaver! I don’t know who I would have gone with otherwise.”
“God, like I’m some kind of object to be won again – and like I’ve just been sitting around, waiting for him to sweep in and rescue me from my lonely existence – “
Parvati choked. “Sorry, what?”
Pansy was not moving. “And you want to go back to that?”
“I didn’t – “
After his second orgasm of the morning – the first one had been a bit of frantic rutting against each other, the second a wickedly long blow-job that had Harry screaming – they settled back into their original positions, sides swapped.
“You do?” She wondered whether to be pissed off at his use of sweetheart. Eh. There were bigger battles.
“So. Virtue ethics. You pick something to venerate – bravery, intelligence, patience and loyalty – and you decide whether an action is right or wrong based on how well it measures up to those virtues.”
“Oh well, if
“Oh, relax. I’m not that kind of monster.” He was staring into space, musing idly as the tip of his boot traced Michael’s spine. “No, I think I’m just going to Crucio you instead.”
“You mad bastard, you can’t think I - “ He was cut off by a scream, as Blaise pressed his foot back down on his broken knee.
Susan was gaping. Her hair was plastered to her head, and her dress shirt was sticking to her skin, and even if Harry didn’t like women that much, he could appreciate that she was beautiful.
Blaise shrugged. “He was bemoaning you and Dean with Seamus last time I checked. I know I’m supposed to be on his side, but you and Thomas would look lovely together. Do let me know if you’d like a third.”
“Exactly,” said Draco. “It was foul. Anyway, it was – I can’t sleep, Blaise. I can’t eat. I can’t listen to music anymore. I keep on trying to go to bars and find someone else, but it’s like all men are ruined for me now.”
Dean shrugged and hopped up onto the trunk of a fallen tree along the path. “Define
“I’m bisexual,” said Blaise. “In case any of the ladies present want to make use of me.”
Dean’s hands were hot under his shirt. Harry was half-hard in his jeans, and he could feel Dean pushing back, hard as well. God, he wanted to – he wanted to peel Dean out of these clothes, push him up against a wall, rut into him until they were just a mess.
She found him the next evening, smoking on the patch of grass outside their dorms with Theo. The sun was setting, and the weather chilly, but they’d created a bubble of warming charms around the two of them that had her tugging at her cardigan.
“Are you saying your love for me is a terrible pain?”
Draco laughed, and passed the bottle back to Harry. “How did you do on that essay, by the way?”
“Well, unlike certain nouveau riche horrors I could name we haven’t had to marry into half a dozen families just to gain a bit of legitimacy.”
“I did.” He stood up quickly – not angrily, but with finality. “The problem is that you and Granger have completely different studying styles.”
There he was, running his hands through Potter’s hair as he laughingly told him the full story of the Polyjuice incident.
“You’re getting back together with Hermione?” said a small voice from the back.
“Oh yeah?” said Dean. “Did they get sick of his moping?”
“What ethical system would you say Hermione lives by?”
“How the fuck can you tell if a black dog is actually your school’s founder?” said another.
He walked out of the room still smiling to himself, and ran straight into Hermione coming out of the room opposite.
“Uni is a time for trying new things.”
That way lay madness.
“Well, fuck,” said Draco.
and pool and beer suddenly lost their appeal.
“Probably? Not to mention it dramatically increases the potential for miscommunication, which is – “
“Oh fuck,” said Harry. “Also, Ron should never find out about this. Not the – not the bi thing. I meant – “
“Yeah,” said Blaise. “The other day I was daydreaming. You know what I normally daydream about? Filthy, terrible things. Sometimes even filthy things involving you. But on this occasion I started day dreaming about our wedding, Susan. Our wedding. I’ve planned the colour scheme. It’s going to be beautiful and you’re only allowed to plan the seating chart because you’re good at politics but your aesthetic sense is terrible.”
“I’m into women,” said Hermione. “Specifically, Parvati.”
“Please, please don’t - “
“I hate it, Blaise,” said Draco, after yet another embarrassing failure to pull. “I can’t – I can’t stop thinking about him. It’s like I’m bloody Greengrass or something, mooning over my crush.”
“Who’s jumping me?” said Neville from behind him, and Draco went bright red. Harry was laughing so hard it must have hurt.
“I haven’t got the heart to tell him. I just feel like I’m different people with all of them. I’m trying stuff out, you know? With Michael I get to be this pretentious arty intellectual, and with Anthony I get to be academic and sexy and political – we’re going to a protest for Centaur Rights, which – “
“That was definitely your worst year,” said Harry, nodding vigorously. “After eighth year. And maybe seventh year.”
Anthony was all right in Harry’s book, because he took one look at Hermione once they’d all left Susan to sleep and said “I’ll put the kettle on. Harry, you make sure Hermione’s all right.”
“Awful. Have you heard of something called
He had gone to university with three clear goals. Firstly, to piss off his father by proving that he didn’t need the Malfoy money to succeed. Secondly, to dazzle his instructors with his legal prowess enough that they might agree to help him find a job once university was other, thus allowing him to live on his own and therefore piss off his father. Thirdly, to actually attempt to redeem himself and start a new life, pissing off his father in the process.
“Sounds great,” slurred Corner. “I’ll just - “ He tried to step out from the bench, and nearly tripped over, steadied only by Blaise’s hand on his back.
Dean’s eyes were open. He looked like he was seeing his death.
“Uh.” The menacing eyes of twenty yellow chrysanthemums stared back at him. “No?”
“Not about Draco.”
Hermione slipped away while Draco was pouring them both a glass of wine, and made her way to the kitchen. She could see the back of Anthony’s head. She opened the door and was about to step out when she heard –
“I’m going because it will be a boost to my reputation. And because…” He trailed off. Why was he going? He’d been very clear with Harry – just sex and friendship. Well, he’d been clear on the sex front, the friendship was more implied. It was nice to have Potter looking up at him so eagerly. For so long, there’d been Potter’s face in his head, turning away as Draco offered him his hand. Now, whenever the bad nights came and he could feel Nagini’s breath on him as real as life, there was another memory – Potter underneath him, shaking like the world was ending as Draco fucked into him – that he could pull around himself like a golden blanket to ward off the dark.
“No, darling, you’re not following.” Pansy jabbed a finger at him. “You’ve been in love with Harry Potter for years. You just noticed it two weeks ago. May I ask what bought this sudden realisation on?”
“Right,” said Parvati. “Um – probably not for a while. I’ll go grab us some coffees.”
“Being in a stable relationship,” said Hermione, “with someone who can actually talk about feelings.”
“Sorry, sorry,” said Draco, wiping his eyes. “Ok, so you and Parvati. Were you copping off?”
That was fine. On cue, Parvati appeared on the other side of Hermione with metaphorical precision, and Hermione turned towards her, face lighting up.
“Usually they mean kickboxing or recreational drug use, not having sex with men.”
Oh, fuck.
“I’m trying to help!”
He pecked her on the lips, because he was a nice guy, and dashed after Draco without a thought.
“Well, that is my type,” he said. “Look, you just looked like you were going to cry, all right? I thought you’d prefer if people didn’t see that.”
He held his breath. Whatever the answer was, he wouldn’t let it get him down. They’d only been officially dating for two weeks anyway. It was crazy to ask someone to move in with you that early. And if Draco said now, there’d still be time for them to build a home together after uni. One where Draco left his expensive shirts lying around because he wasn’t used to life without a house elf, and Harry cooked and Draco critiqued every forkful while gobbling it up. Where their friends would drop in and out every day through a door that was always open to them, laughing and telling stories and growing old and dull. There might be children running up and down the stairs where Sirius had been so miserable, and a fresh coat of paint in Buckbeak’s bedroom. One day Harry would take their hands and lead them to Godric’s Hollow and tell them about a war that wouldn’t matter to them, that they’d never be able to understand. He’d show them a picture of a handsome man with a cocky smile and a woman with firebright hair and tell them that they would have loved each of them very much. And he’d smile at Draco through the tears and know that they would have loved Draco too. It didn’t have to happen now, but it would, one day. He could feel it, the gravity of the future tugging at him.
“Nope.”
“Please go to therapy,” said Hermione.
whiskey,” said Draco. Pansy gestured to two in the middle. The smell of it made Harry’s stomach want to rebel, but he was
“What, The Prophet?” He’d been carefully not looking at the front of any newspapers he saw, and trying to chalk any pointing and whispering he heard up to his imagination.
“Intelligence can be used to do bad things to,” said Harry, feeling bizarrely like he might be having
“And what?”
“Less,” said Seamus. “This is Hannah, she has nice hair.”
“I figured. Everyone in there won’t stop looking at me like I’m about to fall to my knees and wail ‘oh god why’.”
“But everything it represents, I still am. Proud. Mean. Arrogant.”
“Teaching,” he said, smiling. “It’s a new one. It turns out that Muggles actually make you get a degree in how to get children to learn stuff, rather than finding someone who knows a lot about a school subject and just hoping that they can get teenagers to learn. So you don’t end up with someone truly horrible who’s just mean to the kids that don’t understand.”
Blaise grinned. “The most attractive person. What a Gordian knot you have put me in – pun not intended. All of my friends are just so beautiful.” He stood up, and began to move slowly round the table. “There’s you, of course – yes, you’re a stringy bean, but you’ve got wonderful cheekbones and those slate grey eyes, that ash-blonde hair – damn. Draco, who might even come in as the next hottest Slytherin. After me. Greg – well. You’ve got nice shoulders.”
“She’s fine,” said Malfoy. “Apparently she recently did something semi-heroic, and Weasley is championing her to all and sundry. Thanks for thinking of it, though.”
“Ron?”
“Shockingly, no, I have not told Weasley. I don’t want to disappear.”
“Hear about what? I’m not going to see him. What do you mean, hear about it?”
“I think I’m bisexual, actually,” said Harry. “And, um, I think you’re bisexual too?”
“You don’t have to buy friendship. No one’s been a prick to you tonight, have they? Anyway, in case you missed it – I won’t tell them.”
“I admire her,” said Draco, lying supine after Harry had given him a blowjob worth “five stars,” apparently. “She’s a brilliant witch, and she should know how many options she had. Thank god she didn’t settle down with the weasel and sink into domestic stupefaction.”
“I need to get laid,” he said to his little room, dick out and dirty tissue in hand. It was one of the lower moments of his life. He tried to compare it to the time he’d had to sneak off into the forest to wank on their year on the run, and concluded that no, this was worse.
They settled into the kitchen, Blaise uncorking the champagne and pouring them glasses and keeping up a steady stream of patter that almost disguised the awkward silence coming from all three of them. Eventually there was an awkward pause, and Harry realised, seeing as everyone was staring at him, that Blaise had probably just asked him a question.
“I’ll win them back,” said Blaise, who was already double-fisting bottles of champagne. “Are we ready for the countdown? Got any new year’s resolutions, lads and ladettes?”
“I got this,” said Draco. “Good luck with Corner. Don’t let him read you his poetry. Oh, and thank you for the help, I suppose.”
“Malfoy?” said Ron. “The same Malfoy who you wanted to punch in the face the last time we met up?”
Draco was laughing so hard he had actual tears in his eyes. “First Ginny, and now this. Are – are you telling me that the only women that the men of the Golden Trio dated immediately came out as lesbians after this – “
“A lot indeed. Seven, to be exact. And how many years has my mother spent in prison? You can chime in too if you know the answer, Corner.”
“Ouch,” said Ron. “Is that in revenge for the Christmas fiasco?”
“The Dursley’s.”
“Still,” said Dean, quietly insistent. “I’m sorry. I found the same thing when I went looking for my dad. It hurt.”
“We’ll go upstaors to mine,” said Harry, grabbing her hand. Malfoy was here, and who knew how thin the walls were? “I’ve got bacon. And tea.”
“I don’t know what else to win you through, Bones, this is me throwing absolutely everything at you – “
“You have my deepest sympathies,” said Blaise. “What happened, if I might ask? I’ve only heard one side of the story, and I can’t imagine it’s accurate. Have some more wine!”
Draco squeaked.
“You’re a pretty solid bloke, considering you did that.”
“Does this sudden flush of love mean you’re going to start talking to him again instead of generally running around like a lunatic?” said Blaise, examining himself in the mirror. “Also, does anyone think my hairlines beginning to recede?”
“Don’t. I don’t think this will take long. Nice and friendly, right?” he said, and his voice was so warm and open and honest she could have wept. “We’ll still be friends.”
“Who decided the values you live by?”
“Look, I know you told me not to. But I need to. I have to push.”
“Hullo, Malfoy,” said Ginny. She was looking at him with a sharp expression, and he abruptly remembered that her brother had died in the war, and another one had been turned, and maybe he shouldn’t be sitting so close to her just because he had Harry’s protection.
“Absolutely bloody not.”
“Well, he knows he can’t now!” said Harry, brightly as possible. Hermione stomped her foot.
“Guys like me? You have never met a guy like me. Not to sound my own horn, but I’m a bloody catch.”
“Really. You all just ended up in this cupboard by accident, then?”
Just as she stood there, frozen at the cusp of decision, she caught a pale flash from the corner of her eye. There was Ron watching her, mouth open. His hands were clenching limply by his sides. Ron, who she’d abandoned because she needed to find herself, who hadn’t deserved any of her tangled mess. She couldn’t do this to him, or herself. What had she thought, that going to university would un-Granger her? She would always be better at books than people, and everyone who wanted her now just wanted a phase she was going through.
Draco stilled even more, if that was possible. “Potter. What the fuck is a dinosaur.”
“I know for a fact that your family tree is a straight line.”
“We haven’t actually left this bed yet, though,” said Harry. “So, technically, never doing it again hasn’t started yet.”
It was a fine night, the very last traces of September warmth making it just possible for them all to sit outside. Blaise was complaining at length at the indignities of having to go to lectures –
“Oof – Hey, ‘Mione. I’ve been looking for you.”
Parvati smiled into her drink. It was a reflex smile – the kind you did so that your face didn’t do anything else. “Well. We were probably more like – I don’t know.”
“Oh my god,” said Parvati, struggling to get herself under control. “Ok. Wow. Yeah. So you’re little speech earlier, about how boys just don’t like you because you’re such a special snowflake? Not so much, babe.”
And then she did something inexplicable. She turned and kissed him.
“Especially then,” he said. Hermione laughed, and then tore herself away to look back at Harry.
“That’s rather the point of university, Blaise,” said Hermione.
It wasn’t hard to figure out what was causing it. It was hard to figure out what wasn’t, actually. All the people in his life who he loved where so very fucked. Well, Hagrid was probably fine. Though come to think of it, Harry hadn’t heard from him in a while. God, maybe the curse had got him too.
She raised Hermione’s abandoned drinks. “To our golden childhood. Long may we repress our traumas. Did you know Amycus Carrow once told me he’d relax the uniform rules around skirt lengths just for me? And then followed me back to the common room to make sure I ‘got safely to bed.’”
“You played dead,” said Malfoy, his eyes glittering. His lips were curved in something dangerously like a smile. “Pretty cunning of you.”
“Just awful,” said Harry. “We’ll miss you.”
“I am so done with you!” Dean’s voice came from nearby. “Get in here, we’re talking about this.”
“So – “ Hermione was looking between the two of them. “So – “
“See if I don’t hex you right now, you – “
But Draco was just shrugging his words off. “I’m not talking about the homophobia, though I’m sure there’s a fair bit of that mixed in. I just mean that they were pretty symbiotic, weren’t they? And now with everything changing, I can see why Seamus might be feeling pretty insecure.” He sipped his pint. “We’ve all been through a lot, and most of it was only a year ago. None of us are going to be our best selves right now.”
“Fuck,” said Draco, breaking for air. “Ok, look, I’d feel terrible if your first big gay adventure didn’t teach you some of the basics. Grab that bottle of lube over there.”
“Great,” said Harry, and kissed him, laughing against his lips when Draco batted him away.
Draco raised his bleary head from the pillow. “It’s not happening again, Potter.”
“Draco, could we talk?”
“I’m so sorry,” said Hermione. She was pretty sure she was near crying, but in a nice way, a cathartic way that came from just loving everyone so much. “You’re so nice, and so brave, and I was really mean about all the things you believed.”
“Fair. Are you all right?”
“Generally a nightmare,” said Hermione. “I mean, she’s nice to me now she knows I’m not trying to steal you, but she did once try and murder me in public.”
“No, I mean, yes, I mean I’m sure she has. I’m sorry.” He raises his hands placatingly. “Remember how you’re doing that new thing where you use your words instead of bottling up your emotions forever and releasing them in a storm of rage?”
“No we’re not,” said Dean. “And you’re definitely not, five-foot-five.”
“Yeah,” he said, smiling to himself. “Yeah, it’s going to happen again.”
Draco’s face was pained. “Because if you do that, I’m going to come.”
She had, unfortunately, entered with Draco. Harry pushed through the mingled people towards them, desperate to avoid more Ronologuing. Hermione was looking gorgeous in a backless black velvet dress, her hair piled up on her head with a golden pin. Draco looked – his mind briefly turned to static. He bumped into Hannah Abbot.
He’d done two rounds of the dancefloor and another two of the whole club before he acknowledged, like a hole to the heart, that Seamus was gone.
“I’m applying for a job,” said Malfoy between gritted teeth, and Harry stretched his grin wider and made sure his voice carried.
“I’m irresistible to English girls because of my atmosphere of European sophistication. Scottish girls just think I sound like a twat.”
Malfoy scoffed. “Yes, Potter. I could figure that out myself. Why on earth did you do that?”
“She keeps insisting that there’s nothing he could do. I don’t want to say it, but I think she might be right. It’s not like it will last forever, anyway. She’s going to be a good auror, you can tell. Eventually she’ll prove herself. I thought she might go a bit Malfoy, you know,
“Hmm. I’m not sure I believe you. Do you believe him, Potter?”
Hermione, queen that she was, had managed not to fall into a confusing friends-with-benefits situation with Anthony after sleeping with him one time. They were still flirting and going out for coffee, but so were she and Terry Boot and she and Michael.
“I assumed as such,” said Michael.
“Boys!” Blaise burst into the room. “And Granger. Hallo, did you know that I’m Harry approved and definitely non-evil now?”
“What?”
She looked up at Parvati and had about ten different realisations at once. She could kiss her, right now, and it would be wonderful. Parvati’s lips would taste of bubblegum and smell of cherries, and her breath would be sweet from cocktails and bitter from vodka. Her hands – those careful, delicate hands that smoothed Hermione’s hair and brushed colour across her eyelids – would wrap themselves around her. They’d feel so good inside her. Parvati might put her mouth between her legs and smear that purple lipstick across her cunt. She wanted it, just as fiercely as she’d wanted Anthony and Ron. Wanted it more. Except –
“Well,” said Dean. “I guess we’re even now, Harry.”
“You know,” said Harry, as the afterglow faded. “I haven’t actually kissed you yet. Sober, I mean.”
he said, punctuating that with a vicious thrust that sent Draco sprawling.
“So did I. But no, I’m a full lesbian. You’re all right, aren’t you?”
“That one, yes. Look, this will come as a shock to you. It came as a shock to me. It’s pretty much – well, a complete reversal of everything I’ve ever – “
“Fuck them,” said Dean, grabbing Harry’s shoulders. “Fuck them, Harry. Fuck everyone who said we shouldn’t be here. We are alive. That means we win. We’ve won, and they’ve lost, and they’ll be shitty and bitter about it for the rest of their lives. Those people, your family – “
“I will never – “
“Ah,” said Draco, twirling his wand. “But wait till I do –
“When we’re out of here, you’re Harry. When we’re fucking, you’re Potter. Best that way. Lines don’t get blurred.”
“Yeah.” She took a sip of her drink. The overpowering sweetness did nothing to mask the taste of vodka. “God. I’m sorry I took this all out on you. I wasn’t even mad at you. I guess in my head I’ll always be fifteen and mad at – “ She stopped, realising she’d trod on a land mine.
“Yes, I remember. I burned my Inquisitorial Squad badge in a tasteful ceremony in the Manor gardens shortly before I left the house forever. Umbridge was only headmaster for, what, six months? And in that time she had to make about six hundred rules just to cover every single situation, because you sneaky bastards kept on finding a way to get around them.”
I think it is worth noting that in the original word document, this chapter started on page 69.
said the helpful Harry voice in her head. Typical of him to show up five minutes late.
“We weren’t having drama,” said Ron. “We were having a mature, adult conversation. Right, Hermione?”
She’d slammed the book shut. “Harry James Potter. You’re acting like a great big lump. Yes, you had to do a lot of awful things, but it wasn’t all you being pushed around. You’re a big boy – what did you choose to do?”
“You all right?” said Harry. “That was – intense. Sorry I didn’t step in.”
“Sorry, worried about Parkinson?”
“This is going to end in tears,” muttered Morag, and Harry grabbed the joint out of Dean’s hand and took a toke like a normal person, thank you very much.
The room had darkened considerably by the time the next knock on her door came. Probably Harry –
but the point still stood. And Harry had offered, hadn’t he? Draco knew where to come if he changed his mind. He would have put money that Draco would show up again that night.
“Oi,” said Ron. “Your two best friends here of seven years, went through hell for you, love you to bits?”
“I said not now, Potter, what part of my little speech yesterday was unclear?”
“Too scared of the dirt I have on you?” Ron grinned. “Don’t worry. I can pick on Harry as well.”
“It was an honour, my dear,” he said, bowing dramatically. She rolled her eyes, and swept out of the room. The second she was out the door, all Blaise’s gallantry melted away.
“She was brave, facing down a werewolf like that. She sorted well.”
“He is a drip.”
“It’s fine,” said Ron.
“I would?”
wanted to talk to me!”
“I kind of hate you,” said Theo. “But I’ve had many years to come to terms with it.”
“Diplomacy,” said Harry.
“Can I have more whiskey?”
“Draco Malfoy.”
“Probably up to something,” said Ron, trying to keep a straight face. “Better make a magic map of Royal College and track him on it.”
“No,” said Parvati, kneeling down and pushing her way through the books. “Are you going to hurt me if I disturb your nest? You just look like you really need a hug.”
“Not do that,” said Theo.
No really. Fuck this.
“What the fuck,” said Theo. “What the fuck are you doing here.”
amount of in love with you, ok? Very normal. Completely fine –  ow, Padma, did you fucking bite me?”
“Please, don’t let me get in the way,” said Seamus. “Have all the fun you want together. Why should you care about how I feel, right? I’m only your best friend who you apparently miss, so fuck me if I don’t like this.”
“Dean.” Blaise grabbed him. Dean pulled away, but he held tight. “Stop it. Pull yourself together.”
on Potter. Who had he become?
“Blaise said that we were a shitshow? Wait, how does he even know -?”
“Oh,” said Harry. “Yeah. No, he’s pretty gone for her.”
“Yeah,” he breathed, and then they were.
“Mate,” said Ron, “I wouldn’t – “
“I think he’s into Hermione?”
“It’s all right,” said Terry, standing and taking her arm. “I’ll walk you to her room.” He guided her out gently. He was all right, Terry. Strange and old-fashioned, but with that came ideas about being a gentleman. It would be quite nice is Hermione picked him.
“Because he thinks I’m dating Malfoy, not because he actually respects my humanity and personhood!” She slammed her hand on her desk. “Don’t tell me – he’s going to have a long talk with me at Christmas, and he’s going to try and convince me that all that arguing was just a sign we’re meant to be together, except now it will come with a side-dish of patronising concern because you told him I fancied Malfoy!”
“I’m not ready to be out,” he said, his breath tickling Harry’s ear. “I mean – out-out, to the world. I know it’s kind of an open secret, but I need a little more time. Can you live with a little bit of cowardice from me?”
Unfortunately, always there
“You’ll go crawling back to your parents eventually.”
“Have you ever cast an Unforgivable?” He held up a hand at Harry’s splutter. “For fuck’s sake, I’m not going to
Harry stared at him. Ron stared back.
“Then let me explain some things to you,” said Theo. “Maybe he gets on with you now. Hell, Potter and Malfoy get on, stranger things have happened. Maybe he’d even like to fuck you, Pansy. But you do not get the boy. You do not get this happy ending that you seem to have constructed in your head. He will use you for sex and chuck you over for a lark and laugh it up with his Gryffindor mates about the time he actually got under the skin of the ice bitch of Slytherin.”
“Do try, Potter.”
“That’s all right,” said Luna. She still sounded kind of airy, but mostly she just sounded drunk. “You should go and dance! You’re free now, Hermione. Everyone free should dance.”
Harry rushed through his shower and then set about the kitchen, still whistling. Hermione pottered in a few moments later, hair still wet.
“You know I’ve spent most of this year just as closeted and confused as Seamus is, right?”
“Sorry, Harry,” he said, probably legillimensing him. “I’ve got to meet Pansy, so it’s your right hand today.”
“Yes, little miss Internalised Misogyny, I am aware.”
“I’m sorry about Lavender,” said Hermione, softly. “I can’t imagine if – if I’d lost Ron or Harry.”
Harry’s heart hurt. He didn’t want it to, didn’t want to bleed any more emotions over Draco Malfoy, but he couldn’t not imagine it. Malfoy waking up from nightmares, Harry’s voice coming back to him in the night.
“Look,” he said, as soon as Harry opened the door. “If we’re doing this, it’s going to be a secret. I won’t have my good name sullied by having sex with the likes of you.”
Parvati’s legs were against hers. There was a warm thrum in her stomach, the same as when Anthony had – oh.
“Yeah.” He pulled out gently, rubbing Draco’s hole with his thumb just to feel it flutter again. “You’re – you’re so brilliant. I’ve never had sex – “
The night was raucous and Seamus’s CD collection large, which was why no one herd the door opening. Harry only realised when Blaise went rigid, and he turned and felt a bit like he’d been runover by the Hogwarts Express.
Morag raised an eyebrow. “You’re definitely tools.”
“At my attentions? Darling, anyone would be.”
“So how did breaking up your Ravenclaw harem go for you?” said Draco.
Susan flushed bright red. “You want me to stay? Hermione – “
There was a beat, and then the corner of Draco’s mouth wobbled. He started giggling, trying to push it down with a hand over his mouth, and Harry laughed far too loudly for a library.
“Bet he shagged a chimera,” said Goyle. “I knew a bloke who did that once.”
“What the fuck,” said Parvati. “What the actual fuck, Hermione. I mean, I always knew you thought like that, don’t get me wrong. It’s not like you were subtle. But what have I ever,
“You good?” whispered Dean.
“It’s fine. And for one thing, you said a few shitty comments, you didn’t try and aid a genocidal maniac into taking over the world.”
Theo snorted. “All right. Blaise, I dare you to snog the most attractive person at this table.”
“She’s fine,” said Harry. “She’s – you know, she’s Hermione. She’s thrown herself into her books.”
hug her and tell her that of course she was pretty, there were loads of blokes out there who would be lucky to have her. And he’d be biased because he had to say that, and she would know that, but it would probably still cheer her up a bit. She picked up her coat and opened the door, determined to make the best of today, and found Draco Malfoy out there, standing stiff as a board.
Seamus’s hands undoing his fly, the pale curve of his cock. It had taken a long time, the alcohol turning it into a desperate slow crawl to orgasm. Some of Seamus’s come had landed on his hand and he’d licked it off, unseen.
“Uh huh.”
“I was half-cut, who fucking knows?”
“My siblings are white. Kind of hard to miss. When I was little, I thought I might be adopted, but mum was pretty clear with me. So yeah, I’m the black, queer kid in a white straight family.”
“I understand.”
Hermione blinked. “Why – why would I want you to leave?”
“Wow,” said Draco. “Well, ok then. I really do see what you mean about love being unexpected.” His grin turned wicked. “So, want to get out of here, Potter?”
She seemed to waver a moment, her eyes glittering with tears. Harry wondered what that was about, and then decided he didn’t much care.
Pansy threw a straw at him. “I’m a new woman now. All about being in touch with my feelings and stuff of that ilk.”
“Never have I ever turned my hair green in the middle of a raid,” said Ron.
Blaise blinked. “Well, I haven’t been proven
“Because of your family,” she said softly.
“We need to talk,” he said, pulling him away from conversation with Pansy.
Ron wasn’t looking at him. Harry leant over and patted his arm. “Yeah, her too. Have you spoken at all?”
“This is a fucking train wreck,” muttered Malfoy, which Harry thought was a bit rich considering these were his friends.
“Sometimes they put on plays,” said Harry.
“Right,” said Harry. God, seven years of rivalry with Draco Malfoy, and he needed to comb through them all and pick out every little thing that really, truly was his fault. He supposed he should start with the obvious. “I’m sorry about sectum – “
It was just a bit lonely, she thought as she watched Draco dance with Harry, when you were the only one standing there.
“Well,” said Harry. “Glad we definitely made sure we’d gotten that out of our systems.”
“I do every day,” he said, winking at her. She blew him a kiss. “All right, you horrific harridan. Which one’s whiskey?”
“I don’t want to leave my bed, Harry. Let’s eat in the kitchen.”
“Get out,” he said, snarling.
Harry had sent a Patronus up to her, but she’d sent one back down announcing that she was very busy setting up her room, and could they maybe turn the music down?  “Nah, she’s busy. She was talking earlier about optimising the space in her room for learning.”
Ron turned purple. “Really? Thank god, I was worried – “
coursing through his veins. But overall, he wanted less Potter in his life, and therefore wasn’t talking about him.
“I don’t need you to say anything. You’ve clearly got life sorted, all right? You don’t need me anymore, do you?”
“Of course.”
Except it wasn’t, because nothing was safe with these Slytherins, so Pansy smiled a vicious smile and said “What, Potter, surprised that they let the likes of me in?”
“It is, isn’t it? ‘Harder times.’ Oh, you mean two years ago? Yes, it was a bit challenging then, wasn’t it?”
“All right.”
“What’s being Scottish got to do with it?” said Terry.
“I don’t – “
Blaise pursed his lips. “I just – I don’t
thought Harry, then
“He most certainly does
to shouting at Harry in the courtyard. Ron listened attentively – more than could be said for Hermione, who’d just said “Honestly, Harry, what did you expect?” – and suggested some fantastic modifications to the kitchen that he was reasonably sure could be tweaked to only spray Malfoy.
“What’s this?” said Harry, holding up the glass.
And then he pulled Blaise down into a huge, noisy snog.
“What’s up?” said Parvati. “We’re out of Chardonnay, or any white, or any wine really, so I’ve stolen a bottle of apple sours. Dean will be too embarrassed about owning it to ask who took it.”
“Oh good. What are you going to do?”
“I was thinking more for as long as you want. I mean, you’re a Black. It is kind of your house too.”
“Oh,” he said. “I’m glowing. Potter just asked me on a date.”
“And Granger’s intelligence didn’t help at all.”
Harry laughed too, and kissed him under his ear. “You’re brilliant.”
Dean relaxed. “No, I – I needed to say that to him myself. I didn’t know he thought like that, you know? Especially since – “ He stopped. “Do you think like that, Harry? It’s not actually Malfoy being gay that’s bothering you, is it?”
“All right,” said Harry, and later he did so as fucked Draco’s mouth, threading his fingers through that gorgeous, unnatural shock of hair.
“Yeah. I know. I’m sorry anyway.”
“Don’t like my dress?” she said, breasting at him.
Harry threw up his hands. “Fine! Fuck both of you. I’m going to go and try to get my shitshow back on the road. Blaise, good luck with your weird romantic plans. Pansy, try talking to people without veiled threats, it might get you somewhere.”
Realising her feelings for Parvati also meant that she needed to break it off with the Ravenclaw har- the three nice young men she’d been dating, who she
Draco shivered and buried his head in his chest. “God. This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. I’m having feelings, Potter. Like some sort of first year.”
“Still on a first name basis, I see.”
“You don’t have to, you know. Lots of men don’t.”
“It’s that fucking Granger,” spat Michael, and Harry would have leapt up if it hadn’t been for the warning press of Blaise’s foot against his leg. “Treats everything like a moral crusade.” He downed another glass of wine when Blaise handed it to him with considerably more ease. “All those bitches, twittering together about how awful I am. And Anthony letting Granger ride rough-shod over him, because he’s too cunt-struck to think for himself.”
“You! You – you hypocrite! You’re a sex-haver too!”
“Merlin, fine. Yes, I’m lonely. You’re lonely.” He was looking at her closely now. “We’re both very lonely.”
“Barely,” said Draco, appearing at the door. He looked –
She curled her lip. “Really? I knew I should have taken this skirt up another inch.”
There he was on his knees, Potter fucking into his mouth.
Ron nodded weakly, as if Draco had said something terribly interesting. “It’s a nice cupboard to be bisexual in, I guess. As cupboards go.”
“This one’s going to hurt, but there’s no wrong answer. If you love him, is losing him going to be any less painful than losing your family?”
“I’ve been thinking of dating Susan Bones, actually.”
“Um.”
“It’s like, what, I’m not allowed to mention it?” he said over drinks at the London Stone. Everyone was there except Draco (ignoring Harry), Seamus (shunned forever) and Theo (responded to all invitations with a blank look until the inviting party left). “Sure, get mad at everyone who ever mentions your past. Let’s see how well that goes for you in life.”
and his mind went blank.
“We thought you’d had a moment of self-actualisation,” piped in Pansy. “We were all very excited. And anyway, Greg’s wrong, not since third year.”
“I’ll always need you,” said Dean, his voice broken. “Wait, that came out wrong – “
“Potter,” hissed Malfoy, but Harry was in his element.
“That’s nice. Yeah, it’s really nice, seeing you getting a job on the right side of the law. I guess a job like this – well, it might help with those people problems, yeah? Not that you’ve ever had any work experience really, I guess.” He swung to face the barman. “You’re gonna have a job and a half with this one. I don’t think he’s ever really worked a day in his life.”
“Why?”
But I would like to point out that I was not on Voldemort’s side, my mother was not on Voldemort’s side and I actually left the country in seventh year because I was so very much not on Voldemort’s side. Now we’ve done the obligatory “which side where you on” dance, would you care to come and get pissed?”
Parvati. That was Parvati’s voice.
There was a long, awkward pause, and then thankfully Hannah came into the kitchen.
“You seemed to like my fumbling about earlier,” said Harry, lining up his cock, and Draco moaned and shifted, glaring at Harry with irritation and fondness and naked, breath-taking want.
Harry was so engrossed in the mystery of Malfoy and the ball-point that he watched him make notes for a good twenty minutes, until he remembered that if people were making notes it probably meant the lecture had started. Ah, well. He’d conquered the mysteries of some of the most complex transfigurations, and he’d managed to get his Animagus form in three months. He could definitely follow along with simple right and wrong.
She sniffed and stuck her middle finger up. “Oi, I can say it. You’re meant to say ‘no, Pansy, with your genes of course they’d be beautiful.’”
“Michael,” she said, in tones that she hoped came across as adult and mature. She had cornered him on a pub night. “I know that we’ve been – seeing each other.”
“Pink. And, um. Frilly. And now you’re – “ He gestured vaguely at the collection of spikes adorning her tits. “It’s, er. A departure.”
“Never Have I Ever,” said Blaise, and everyone groaned. “What? It’s a classic for a reason.”
“I’m perceptive. I’ve noticed that you’ve grown your hair out. It looks nice.”
want at him. “Pansy, please put on a jacket, you’re going to take someone’s eye out.”
“My boyfriend should call me by my first name.”
Maybe he could still marry Astoria Greengrass. He could picture Potter naked in exquisite detail if he was required to seal the deal. He was penniless, true, but she hated her sister
“Because a chain of dominoes falling is an orderly event, Blaise,” she would say with an air of infinite weariness. “And it doesn’t even
“Potter, I will murder you, and as they drag me to Azka – to jail my only regret will be that I didn’t tell you to fuck off more.”
“I looked at the university code of conduct. The regulations around – this kind of thing are vaguely worded enough that we could –“
“Don’t be such a bloody Hufflepuff, Pans. I’m not going because I like him.”
haven’t said anything,” said Pansy. “What about you, Potter? Anything over here you want to comment on? Any extremely abnormal behaviour you’d like to ask a
“Sometimes you wish you’d been there,” said Pansy.
“New Year,” said Harry. “New century. New millennium. Time for a change, don’t you think? Try some new things.”
“Fine!” said Draco. He tugged at his hair. Better out than in. “I have – I have fallen in love with Harry Potter.”
“Isn’t patience?”
She pointed at him, laughing nastily. “You’ve got a crush on Draco Malfoy!”
“Nott, if
“Mess up my hair and I’ll kill you,” she said.
“I’ll go first,” said Blaise. “Potter, Truth or Dare?”
She sniffled. “Oh fuck you. I will cry if you say things like that.”
Draco rolled over so he was on his front, looking down at her. “Granger. I wasn’t lying that day. You are beautiful. You just got a gay man to kiss you, come on.”
“Never change,” said Parvati fondly. “Anyway, would we know if Nott was seeing someone? He could get up to any amount of deviant shit on the side. And Dean and Seamus are locked in some sort of hideous battle of wills that’s going to end in a murder-suicide.”
“Oh god,” said Harry.
“To be fair, I wanted to kill Ron for most of the last seven years.” It was only a half-truth, but it was worth it for the way Parvati laughed. They fell silent for a few minutes, and then Hermione looped her fingers around Parvati’s wrist.
“What?” demanded Harry.
She laughed. “Of course. Just a kiss. Just a pass. What’s wrong with that? You just wanted to see if you could have a go. After all, the night was half-over and you couldn’t go home alone. But here’s Susan, right? I know all about guys like you.”
“It looks like he’s handing in a CV.”
“Oh god,” said Hermione. “I think Anthony Goldstein might have hit on me today.”
“Is that what you want, Bones?” Theo’s voice was calm and soothing. “I think that sounds nice, don’t you?”
“Can you – can you imagine his face – “
“What?”
He came again, and Harry couldn’t help it  - he had to touch himself, had to, and Draco was crooning sweet things and running his hands up and down Harry’s thighs and then he was coming onto Draco’s chest. Harry kissed him again, because he just couldn’t help it.
“Look,” said Blaise. “I understand I’ve been a cock to you in the past, both deliberately and without realising it. But Susan, I am standing here in the rain with a bundle of horrifically tacky flowers that I had to buy at a Muggle supermarket. Does that not suggest, in any way, that I might be sincere? Reject me because I’m a terrible person, reject me because you don’t trust me, reject me because you don’t fancy me. But please, god, at least reject me. I am…” He screwed his face up, “ – I am confessing. Which I have never done before. This is not me attempting to net you for some game. This is me saying that you, Susan Bones, are full-blown fucking astonishing, and none of the things I used to do for fun are fun anymore because of you, they just feel like some sort of consolation prize because I can’t have you, and if I can’t then that’s fine, that’s your choice, but I’d really like to know because the uncertainty of hope is ripping me open.”
“Jesus Christ,” said Malfoy, turning his face into the pillow. “I knew I was good in the sack, but I had no idea that I would literally fuck your brains out.”
You didn’t notice Dean was handsome until you did. He had these gorgeous soft eyes, and dimples so perfect that Harry couldn’t quite believe they were real.
Draco was, however, finding plenty of time to talk to Seamus. Harry had seen the two of them studying in the library, or eating a picnic lunch in the sunshine. Draco’s eyes always slid off him. Apparently
“I didn’t expect you to be a defender of women who did what they were supposed to,” said Parvati.
Hermione smacked her on the arm. “Hey, I haven’t snogged Pansy.”
“Teach Blaise appropriate manners and get a first in all my essays,” said Susan.
“It’s nine,” said Harry. “Hermione, I think I’ve had a revelation.”
“Right, well,” said Harry, a little awkwardly. “I’ll just – um – good luck with the job  hunt then, mate.” He flipped two hasty thumbs-up, and then rushed back over to his seat, feeling curiously hot.
“Oh no, Harry, that’s too bad. I thought for sure when he apologised to me – “ She covered her mouth. “Whoops. Oh no. I wasn’t meant to say that.”
like you’re trying to win me through interior décor – “
“That was too many feelings in far too short a time,” said Draco.
Something flickered across Parvati’s face. “Convincing.”
“Um, well – “
“Not you, apparently,” he said.
“Then what am I meant to do?” he yelled. “Please tell me, Morag, what I am meant to do. Because the fact that you can name all that doesn’t make it less of a problem, all right? You’re right, I hurt him by pushing him away, and my motivations don’t matter – you’re right. But I cannot. Be. Near. Him. I am working so bloody hard at this, and I can’t – I can’t – “
December had leeched the world of colour, the trees arterial against the pearly sky. The sky which also matched the colours of Draco’s eyes. It was as if the world was teaming up to bully Harry. Which, come to think of it, would explain his entire life.
“Ok, still confused. So virtue ethics is my weak one. Go on with the others.”
he thought wildly, and then –
“How?”
“Lavender,” said Parvati quietly.
Malfoy’s lips curled. “I wasn’t planning to. If I
“You’re not the boss of me,” she said, swallowing her drink. “And I kind of want to see you fail.”
“No offence, but I have never and will never trust someone who grew up rich as you to cook or clean. Only one condition on our glorious future together.”
“I’ll show you delicious,” muttered Theo, blushing.
Overall, October was one of nicest periods of Harry’s life. Blinding orgasms every night, love in the air for all his friends, horizons expanding – what could go wrong?
“Have you seen it yet?”
“Oh Hermione,” said Susan. “I’m so sorry.”
“I thought you were bi.”
Of course, the person coming out just as he went in was Malfoy. Who Harry hadn’t seen in the queue, which meant that he’d pushed his way in, the arse.
“Not fearing for our lives all the time,” said Ron.
“What happened?”
“Harry,” said Draco. “Harry.
“I don’t – “
“Is the penalty having to drink an appletini like we’re divorced suburbanites in the nineteen-eighties?”
“No, you don’t. But you’ve got tension. Ohhh, it was sexual tension. It was sexual tension all along.”
“ – But I haven’t been sitting under a stasis charm, just waiting for you – “
“Ahhhhhh, fuck,” said Padma. “Hey, Hermione, did you overhear the words ‘not exactly a stunner’?”
Harry considered the situation. Reconsidered it. Watched as Blaise shifted his shoulders like he was carrying the heaviest of burdens. “I thought you weren’t serious about Susan.”
“And you said yes?”
“Ugh.” She released Parvati and flopped back onto the bed. “You know how I don’t know how to do girl things?”
“Yes, I should think so,” said Malfoy. “Well, this has been fun, Potter. I forgive you your sins. I really do have to run now – “
Blaise looked apologetically at Harry. “I’ll get him to bed. You go calm down Hannah. The girl’s had quite a fright.”
“I don’t think I can,” said Dean, his voice hollow. “I think I may be finally, officially out of tears. Hooray for me, right?”
“Don’t let it get you down,” said Ron, elbowing him. “Anyway, now that Ginny’s off the table, is there anyone there who catches your fancy? I know Susan’s not exactly wank bank material, but Hannah’s quite fit, and Parvati – well.”
“Speaking of Slytherins,” said Draco smoothly, “where are Blaise and Susan? And, well, everyone else? I do love your London flat, Parvati, but we’re going to need more than the six of us to fill it.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure I’ll figure it out,” he said bravely, and Hermione rolled her eyes and kissed the top of his head.
“And meanwhile, we’re here!” Dean spread his arms and indicated their dingy surroundings. “They’ve got a pinball machine and…. And beer!”
“Yeah, she’s great isn’t she?” said Ron, misty-eyed. Hermione whacked him.
“You could help him,” said Harry to Dean, who was watching Seamus with barely concealed hilarity.
She leaned up and whisper-yelled into Parvati’s ear. “I think you’re my best friend.”
“Can I have a cigarette?”
“He took advantage of you,” she said, pressing forward. Parvati’s hand was tight on hers, the other resting on the small of her back. “He made you vulnerable.”
It was all “Could you pass this book, please,” and “do you understand – oh,  you don’t? Me neither. Thanks anyway.” Blaise sighed every time he turned a page. Seamus had retreated deep into his anger and would huff every time Blaise sighed. The whole thing was a feedback loop of misery. And in the middle of all of this was Draco and him, trying to catch each other’s eye and then looking away.
“Shut up,” hissed Pansy, releasing him as they rounded the corner into the corridor. “All you men, why can’t you just – shut up!”
“A what?” said Parvati. Bloody posh people.
“I’m a sad lonely bastard too.”
“Nightcap?” said Blaise, and “Please,” said Harry. Blaise was mixing the drinks, so at least he’d be drunk enough to go to sleep.
That got him spluttering. “I’m – I’m not – “
Harry nudged Draco. “Maybe you should start doing that. Then no one would want to marry you ever.”
“I want you not to be here.”
Well, they were doing something confusing. They were either flirting or fighting or bitching about every other person in the room.
“Oh,” said Blaise, grinning like a shark. “Both of you?”
Ron started after her, and then stopped. “Hermione, I – “
“That cowardly little cur,” he said into her hair. “That - that – we'll destroy him, Bones. I promise.”
As they worked their way through Harry’s attempt at a fry-up – it was passable, even if it had nothing on Molly Weasley’s – he talked through his theory, going into great detail about their conversation last night. Hermione, true to her word, kept up a steady stream of encouraging monosyllables. At last Harry ran out of steam, and looked at her expectantly.
“Yeah, Hermione.”
“I like it when you do it with your fingers. Why not your cock?”
Susan was wobbling as she walked. No – not walked. She was being dragged by Michael, and that arm around her was looking more like a choke hold.
“We were? I’m mad at both of them. Who are you mad at?”
“I might like it if you call me Malfoy when you fuck me. Don’t ask me why.”
Draco shrugged. “Tell your girl Granger, not me. Anyway, I think it will do him some good.”
Malfoy looked a bit surprised, and then shrugged. “It seems easy enough. Plus it’s mostly in the evenings, so I can retain my night-owl lifestyle.”
“Blaise isn’t coming,” said Pansy. “He’s got something special planned with Susan.”
“I’m just bekow you,” she said, opening her book again. Which was – odd. Because that was not an answer.
“Really? Bloody hell, Hermione.”
about this. I just want to know why you don’t want me to.”
was more traumatic than all of that put together.”
It should have been a nice kiss. It really should have. But her lips were wet, and it reminded him of unpleasantly of Cho Chang, and it felt weirdly medicinal. He gently pushed her off.
She was, he realised, expecting him to ask about the whole giving-him-over-to-Voldemort thing. Even worse, he realised that he had actually been about to ask her that, and had been apparently perfectly prepared to ruin the whole evening just to watch Pansy squirm. “Why did you decide to be an Auror?” he said, instead. That seemed safe.
“You’re struggling to think of cons - ? Potter, I realise this is territory I’ve already used for a joke, but
He’d have to go the roundabout route.
“We’re going to be all right, Dean. You and me, we’re going to be all right.”
“You might have to share with them!” he yelled over the music, while he was shimmying with Hannah.
“Hello,” said the exquisitely pretty blonde from the Slytherin set, appearing next to Morag. “You’re Morag MacDougal, aren’t you?”
He got dressed quickly, and hurried down to Hermione’s flat. Each flat technically had a password, the same as Hogwarts, but everyone had known everyone else’s by the end of the first day. He made his way to Hermione’s room and rapped lightly with his fist.
He just missed Draco so much, which didn’t make sense. He was right
Like, no, Seamus, I’ve spent the last six years constantly worrying about my parent’s reactions and putting up with their shit when I did come out just on a whim.”
“And she’s really mean, but it’s funny.”
“I can tell.”
“Hey, Harry,” she said. Anthony abandoned the traffic cone and leaned into her, his arm coming up around her shoulders. “House parties are fun, right? Anthony’s been telling me about one in America where he had to escape the Muggle police.”
Harry’s face crumpled. “I don’t know. What if he wants to talk about how it’s all been a horrible mistake? What if he starts talking about dating someone else?”
“Well, I just – I’d had my fun, you know? I think I’m ready to settle down into something more serious now.”
“And she does so much to shock people, you know?” Ron was saying. “And she used to do it to me, too – I mean, she still does, kind of – but now when she wears microskirts and see through tops or makes a joke about the Dark Lord or whatever, she’ll give me this look like she knows I’m in on it. It makes me feel – I dunno. Like I’m smarter than I am or something.”
They sat in silence for a few seconds, and then Hermione started laughing.
They sat in silence for a while, passing the cigarette back and forth.
And then disaster struck, in the form of Eclectic.
“This is going terribly,” muttered Draco. “Also, why is this the most dramatic courtyard in the world?”
They crouched in and pulled the door to, just as Theo and Pansy came tumbling into the courtyard.
“Thank you,” whispered Susan. She was still staring at her hands.
“They don’t want me,” said Harry. He drank again. “Apparently I’m boring.”
“Right,” said Ron. “Well, I’m, uh. Very supportive of that too. Just not in Hermione’s direction. Not that I own her, but – “
There on Dean’s bed, with the undeniability of the apocalypse, was Seamus.
There was silence for a long time. Harry watched Malfoy carefully. Watched him bring his arms in to wrap around himself and shudder, just for a second. His eyes were so lonely. Then he drew himself upright and smirked at Harry.
“It not like I wanted to shag you,” said Seamus. “I just thought you were sick, you know?”
He found Hermione leaning against the bar, ordering something called a “Screaming Orgasm.” Harry shot her a concerned look.
it. And you may call me Draco, if you say wish, as long as you don’t abuse the privilege.”
“Why would she?” said Seamus, at the same time as Hermione said “Yes.” She grinned at his shocked expression. “I’ve been knowing things that Harry needs to know for him for years. You’re with Susan Bones, Terry Boot, Morag Macdougal and Blaise Zabini.”
“Absolutely.”
Draco shot to his feet. “Well this has been fun, but we better go – “
“That’s not what this is about.”
Draco flung up his arms. “Could we please focus on my secret?”
“It was true though, wasn’t it? I was a Death Eater. Am. I mean, was. I don’t know. Can you ever stop being yourself?”
“Find a squidmaid,” said Luna, “and see if they can teach me their dances.”
“Potter, the choice of drink was a dig at your obvious unsophistication, stop enjoying it. Pansy – “
“That’s a quibble, Harry, and you know it. I’m going to have a nice, stern talk back at him. Honestly, who does he think he is? He needs to move on, Harry, else he’ll be there mooning around looking gloomy at my wedding. God, what if he objects?”
Susan raised an eyebrow. “No. I’m going to take a piss. Do try and contain your disappointment, Blaise.”
“Ok, Pans.”
“I don’t want to fight with you,” said Harry, even though he really, really did. Eighth year had felt too much and not enough at once, too close and far away, and sometimes Harry would have killed to hear that silky-smooth voice hissing “
“I think it sounds great.”
love what it loves.
“So you heard, then,” he said.
“Continuing,” said Draco, “we each get a second. You get three vetoes, and your second can take your shot for you in that case.”
“It is when it’s the only thing you ever had to make people like you.”
“So you know the club opening,” said Parvati, leaning against the door to Hermione’s room.
“There’s a girl in the class above me in training who keeps on coming to ‘spot me’ when I’m working out,” Ron said. “She feels up my shoulders something awful. I’ve got Parkinson to come with me the last few times I go just to scare the buggers away.”
“Just in case I have to fight a dragon again and you lot need to cheer on a Hufflepuff?”
Harry should have had a family waiting for him on the other side of all this. He should have had Sirius, and Remus, and a house they would have cleared of ghosts together.
“Don’t lie. I would have been terribly helpful. I’m only a bitch because it helps gets everyone’s emotions out into the open.”
“Sorry, gotta run.” He pushed past him, trying to make it look like he was in a hurry rather than fleeing. “Lectures, you know?”
Malfoy’s smirk got wider. “Buckbeak.”
“Can you do something for me though?”
“Hi,” said Hermione, staring at Pansy.
“It’s only just gone seven, Draco,” said Hermione. “Chill out.”
“I think he knows.”
“You do? Oh good – “
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” said Lee. “You got something to say, you can say it to my fist.”
He peeled a strip from the label of his bottle, examining it in the reflected light. “I’m considering it. Might give them something else to talk about.”
Anthony looked up and followed her eyes. “Is that Susan? She looks wasted.”
Susan sniffed. “What, think a big girl like me can’t get it, Potter?”
“What?”
“Won,” said Hermione bitterly. “Well, I broke up with Ron, so I guess no one wins this round.” Parvati was looking away into the distance, her eyes glimmering.
“He’s – no.” Hermione was squinting at the bar. “It can’t be.”
“Yeah, sorry,” he said, patting her vaguely in the shoulder area. Draco was wearing a three-piece suit. Oh god, Harry was just wearing a blazer again. Couldn’t he have used his sort-of fame to rustle up some nice clothes? Why was he so useless?
“Definitely no Malfoy.”
She took his hand and walked back into the warmth.
“Seamus – “
They all looked at each other.
“Hermione!” There was Parvati Patil, waving to her with her twin sister just outside the door to the flat. “It’s good to see you.  How was your summer?”
“But – your mother – “
“And second,” said Draco, refusing to be put off by Theo’s face, “secondly – yeah, fuck everything that happened. It was awful, Theo, but it wasn’t their fault – and it wasn’t ours, either. Not much, anyway. Definitely not yours.” He drank. “Maybe a bit mine. But we can let that be the rest of our lives, and hold those memories sacred, and just live out the remaining century or so we’ve got clinging to a few things that happened in our late teens – or we could live. And drink. And have fun at this party. And you don’t have to do the first thing – I can’t force you – but you do have to do the second and third.”
Blaise shrugged. “Mother was enough for me.”
“Mate,” said Ron, through the floo in Harry’s new room, “mate, Harry, mate. I’m having a crisis. I’m having a terrible crisis.”
which continued to print the occasional photo of him on a night out lending Hannah his arm, or twirling Morag around the dance floor. Actual people who he cared about.
“You’re a terrible pain,” muttered Harry. “Look, what I feel for you is – confusing and scary. But it’s also fucking brilliant. You are fucking brilliant. And – I think you figured this all out before I did, so I’m sorry it took me so long.”
“Sorry, what?”
“Well, I suppose I can always just set myself on fire,” he said, and strode away from the bar, leaving her to pay for his hideously expensive whiskey.
Harry drifted away. He considered going back to the group, but Dean was happily schooling Morag at pinball (the machine now fixed) and everyone else was getting up to dance. He didn’t really want to dance. He wanted Ron, who would have happily listened to him bitching about Malfoy and suggested a few of George’s finest to use on him. Maybe he should go home and firecall him. That sounded like a good idea.
“Absolutely.”
“Oh,” said Seamus. “Well. Right.”
When he was gone, they all stood in a circle around Susan. Hermione felt whited out, blank. Depleted of everything except her anger.
“I do love to be treated poorly.”
“What?”
“Ding ding ding! He really is smarter than he looks, Corner. And much handier with a wand. After all, he killed Voldemort. I can’t imagine he would have much difficulty killing you.”
Harry blinked. “Yeah, Hermione’s great. I’m glad people like her.”
She wasn’t exactly friends with either Susan or Blaise. Still, Susan had joined her and Parvati on many a study session, and Hermione felt it was important to pre-empt any awkwardness.
Later, she could never say who kissed who first. There was a lot of teeth, and a lot of tongue, and it was yearning and desperate and overall completely terrible. They pulled back, and Hermione held her breath.
Parvati laced her hand through Hermione’s. She gripped it and kept her mouth shut.
“If you were in my position?”
Parvati looked like a slapped snake.
“We were talking,” said Draco. He was standing ramrod stiff, his expression somewhere between furious and scared. “In a heterosexual fashion. Because I’m not gay. Or bisexual.”
“Are you drinking alone?”
“They sound like shits,” said Dean.
The party had finally died out around five in the morning. The sky was blood-red at the edges of the east, and Draco was kicking his heels against the kitchen cabinet and drinking a cup of tea.
“What do I do in your head?”
“What? Oh, your explanation, not Pansy’s reasoning. Sorry, that’s still bullshit. Two-hundred-and-eighty-people for one – fine, I get that. I was ready to make the same bargain, ok? But she wasn’t just for giving me up, she was ready to surrender to Voldemort and let him win. How many creatures are there in the magical world, Malfoy? More or less than two-hundred and eighty? Kind of throws Pansy’s calculations off a bit, doesn’t it? What about the Muggles? There’s eight billion of them in the world, apparently. When would Voldemort have stopped?”
“Yes.” She was wary. Padma looked far too excited for someone who wouldn’t be there.
care so much.”
“Guess you’ll keep me then, huh?”
“I know it’s silly,” she said. “But I just wanted – “
“Well, she shot him down in flames,” he said. “So I imagine she’s looking for a better calibre of person.”
Harry’s mouth felt a bit dry.
“Don’t be clever when you’re drunk, Granger, it’s unfair to the rest of us.”
“What the fuck,” said Harry, all thoughts deserted.
“Oi, why is it me that’s going to fuck up?”
“Yes, though I like – “ He coloured.
They ended back up at the London Stone, because Dean insisted it was hilarious. They caught the Muggle bus over there, because Hermione said it wasn’t appropriate to apparate into a Muggle area when some of them didn’t have the best grip on landing where they were supposed to,
“Fine,” she said, firmly. It was absolutely not fine.
Draco was going an alarming shade of red and making slight choking sounds.
“Who’s that?”
“I’m thinking about dinosaurs,” said Harry, because he was too hungover to lie.
Or tried to, anyway.
“I take full credit,” said Pansy. “Do you know how hard it is to get this one to dress properly? He has a hideous collection of Muggle t-shirts that I blame you entirely for, Potter.”
“Oh my god, seriously?” She practically jumped Parvati, throwing her arms around her. “Wait – I can’t do that, I can’t get something for free from Padma, I know she works so hard – “
“Blaise sprinted?” said Harry.
“You went to the funeral of a giant spider at the tender age of twelve!”
“Because honestly? You probably could. I’m fucking needy. I’m a mess. I can’t survive dating. I should have done what Molly said and settled down. I would only be a tiny bit unhappy.”
a nice place for a summer home,” he said, topping up her champagne. “No neighbours around for miles. Isn’t it worth knocking over a few giants for the sake of a weekend of true debauchery?”
“Sure,” said Harry. “I’ll invite the uni lot.”
Harry toasted her. “The maddest bastard I’ve ever met.”
Hermione backed away from the door, her heart hammering in her throat. It was
Draco raised an eyebrow at him when Harry stared at him in mute horror. “What? Oh god, are you pissed off about what happened in the kitchen? Should have known the she-weasel leaving would make you a homophobe.”
“But that’s my primary trait.”
“I wake up screaming half the nights and call my sister at three am, and I miss my best friend so hard that sometimes I can’t breathe, and my parents treat the whole war like it can’t be mentioned and just want me to hurry up and settle down. I’m studying law because they told me to when I really wanted to study Divination – don’t laugh. I practise by myself sometimes, but I can’t get the clarity to see the future, and I think it’s because I don’t really want to. Because I think it might be ordinary.”
“Dean, could I have a word with you outside?”
“Being brave is the right thing to do,” said Harry, leaning forward again. He wondered if they were going to fight again. It didn’t feel like they were going to, but there was a humming in his blood. When he moved, Draco moved closer too.
Seamus slowly untensed under her hands.
“Get in,” said Draco. “We were all doing what you were doing, and then we all heard what you heard, and then we all did what you did. And now we’re all in here.”
“It was what?”
He did have Ron next to him, however, which came with a constant stream of noise.
“I’m not saying I particularly want to be around Sea right now. But doing this is just going to hurt him. What’s he going to do, mope at the side lines until he finally gives in and apologises? That’s pretty cruel.”
“Argh, but – they are in the same flat, right?” Ron was tugging his hair now, bent low over the table. “What if -  I don’t know, they end up drunk and she’s just feeling a bit sad and he’s there and – no. No.” He made to stand up, and then sat down heavily. “Ok, I’ll see her at Christmas, right? I’ll have a good long talk with her. Ask her what the bloody hell she thinks she’s up to.”
But he didn’t want to be easy with Draco. You had to be brave, and a little bit stupid, when you were in love.
“Now that you’re parents have cut you off, you mean,” said Harry, and then resisted the urge to stomp on his own foot. So much for roundabout.
Hermione stopped laughing.
“It seems appropriate,” said Dean. “I’m miserable. It’s raining. Time to smoke. How did your thing with Draco go?”
“Prick,” said Harry, jostling him and getting a middle finger in response.
“I don’t understand.”
“What?”
Harry fucked Draco for the first time on the last day of September.
“Don’t tell Granger,” said Theo, his eyes darting quick and scared across her.
“Because it will be interesting,” he said, as Pansy scoffed. “Anyway, I want to see what a Weasley club is like. I promise to send you all the dirty details.”
“Well, from what I remember, that can’t have been too bad. Hey, do you remember the day you duelled me in the DA? You were terrifying. I think you were still sore from beating Ron earlier.”
Potter.”
“That’s funny. I don’t really remember us being friends. I don’t think I like you very much, actually.”
under his breath.
“Gracefully, or -?” said Draco.
“In your romantic life, Harry,” said Susan.
“Ta very much, Granger, have fun tonight!” He was always running away from people these days, it seemed. He had been invited to the Halloween party upstairs, which surprised him, but he knew Potter would be there being drunk and open and fuckable. He kept being invited to pub nights too, which surprised him. What surprised him more was how much he wanted to go. It wasn’t even about Potter. He’d just become – surprisingly – used to people.
He hummed noncommittally. “Forgive me, Granger, but I find myself tired of talk of love these days.”
“Is everything all right, Harry?”
“What are you trying, then? Another notch on the Zabini bedpost? Surely after all those European princesses and pureblooded high-born bitches – “
“Maybe I don’t,” said Theo, his voice kind. “But am I wrong?”
The day of Blaise’s party, the last day of term, Harry awoke with a feeling of doom.
“Draco. Darling. When you first began this absolute skull-fuckery, you promised me that it was just sex.”
“The daze of loneliness.”
Harry considered asking questions, but decided against it. For one, Blaise looked terrifying, and for another, leaping before he looked was kind of his thing, and following very angry people who woke him up late at night for secret missions had always turned out roughly ok for him. He followed Blaise, a few steps behind him, as they stalked silently through campus and then out of the university grounds.
“It’s just – he kept on buying the drinks. And when I said I didn’t want one, he’d tell me I was a pretty poor date if I would make him drink alone. But he was having beer and I was having cocktails so – I shouldn’t have gotten that drunk, that’s all.”
“Nice?” said Anthony.
“Decided to wear most of my drink as decoration, I see.”
“Why not?”
would make it the third time.
“I’m not copping off with anyone.”
to turn up to university, he should at very least have had the decency to live on the side lines.
Michael looked at him, then Hermione, lip curling back. “What a waste,” he muttered.
“I’m glad one of you has a normal name,” said the barkeep, coming over with their change. Draco gave him a look of poorly concealed-contempt.
Brilliant flowers of ice exploded across the walls. They grew vines that raced across each other, frost-roses and verglass leaves threaded with delicate hoary veins, each bloom glimmering with a deep-blue light from within. Within seconds, the house was hidden behind a fairy-tale wall of shimmering loveliness. The last flower exploded high in the air above them, and the sky over the house was full of softly falling snow.
Blaise shut his eyes and swooned backwards dramatically. “She makes me want to do incredible things, you know. Fight a war. Slay a dragon. Punch a bad guy in the face.”
“I wasn’t mad that you were copping off with a bloke. I was mad because I thought that was the reason you split with your parents. I’d begun to think well of you, you know that? I got all excited, thinking you might have actually changed, and then you told me you hadn’t, it was just your sexuality.” He took a deep breath. “And then
Draco was still shaking, still looking at Harry directly. The tremors had spread to his whole body now. “You suppose right,” he said. “I – I’ll go.” And he ran – literally ran – out of the room.
“Yeah. Does that sound stupid?”
“I have to go,” he said, fleeing this bathroom. He looked like a lunatic. He probably was a lunatic, running after Draco again, Draco who didn’t want him. Just like sixth year, except this time he was even more lost.
“Oh, is that what you and Draco are now?” she said slyly. “Friendly?”
Draco laughed. “I think that’s the title of your autobiography.”
Neville handed him one and came to rest next to him. “You all right?”
Hermione flushed. “I suppose not.”
“Of course she does,” Michael snapped. “We’re just going back to her room for a nightcap. Why don’t you stay out here and suck on your sour grapes, Granger.”
The truth was, it had become unexpectedly hard to spend time with Parvati after realising that she was possibly, maybe, a little bit into her. It wasn’t like Hermione had just suddenly noticed she was gorgeous. It was just that previously, when she’d plastered herself to Parvati’s side and told her that her hair smelt good, it had the safe cover of female friendship. Oh god, she’d probably been really annoying, hadn’t she? Practically following her around, worshipping her wherever she went, gushing over every book she recommended –
A shorter chapter than the last monster. Originally, I wanted to break chapter 1 into two chapters and make it a bit more even, but I couldn't work out where to put the break. This one does feature more Slytherins, and also Draco's point of view (and Dean's! Poor Dean.)
“She’s not my – oh,
Hannah was folded around Susan, stroking her hair. Morag was facing the door, twirling her wand as if expecting someone to come through it any minute.
Come on. He was the Boy-Who-Lived, he could think of a great lie. Sure, he’d had a bad run recently, but he could do it now. The trick was just to act natural.
“And then – I don’t know. Maybe – “ her tongue stumbled over the word – “fuck Terry? I mean, he’s handsome, and charming, and really sweet and funny. But then he’d also probably slide into the ‘marry’ category. And Anthony – I mean, he’s just so fascinating, you know? We can go into long talks for hours and hours. And it’s not just academically fascinating – he really thinks deeply about everything.”
“Mum and Dad definitely know you’re a lesbian now,” said Padma. “It was all ‘oh, Hermione had such interesting things to say about the inherent Christianity of the Hogwarts curriculum’ or ‘oh, Hermione taught me this really neat charm – “
She needed to find another drink.
“I asked you not to push.” His voice cracked into a whisper. “Why did you have to push?”
“Call me Harry.”
“Then what do you want?”
“I’m sorry,” she said once she had finished, but he shook his head and smiled gamely.
“You are always attractive, Hermione,” said Anthony, grinning at her. “Even when you’re spilling secrets.”
“I don’t think Gryffindor were the wild party house. I think we were all – Quidditch and glory.”
“Yep. Sorry.”
“With pleasure,” said Harry, not taking his eyes off Malfoy. He slammed the door behind him, and brooded furiously while he pissed.
“Oh god,” said Theo. “Are you two bonding? Please do not bond. I absolutely forbid it.”
“We can talk to the uni,” said Hermione. “Get him kicked out.”
“As long as you lot stop Morag from smoking that stuff quite so obviously in front of me.”
“Are you asking me to marry you?”
“What about your flat, Hermione?” said Harry.
“What? Is he?”
“Parvati! I was just telling Harry about the reading I’ve been doing. I finished
“I don’t care,” she said. “Whatever it is. I don’t. We’re through. I’m sorry, but we’re through.”
“Ostracized,” said Draco. “He’s the only person I can talk to who isn’t going to involve talking to you. Of course, it means I have to talk about Thomas. Bloody Thomas.”
“I don’t. I was disapproving. But you’re all right now. I missed you. You’re – “ He waved his hands around, trying to encompass the whole university. “You’re part of this. What did you mean,
If she were a better, stronger person she would have pulled away. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. The dancefloor was shitty and tiny and far too light for her to feel comfortable dancing, but she did it anyway. Let herself be wrapped up in Parvati, hands skimming each other’s hips. Let their legs tangle together. When she looked up, Anthony’s eyes were on her.
They made out in the bathroom, leaning against the sinks. Someone shouted something rude and Jordan hexed them without taking his mouth away from Harry’s neck. Everything was warm and nice and blurry. At one point he thought Blaise was talking to him, but he didn’t pay much attention. Maybe he should take Lee home, let him fuck him. Maybe –
“Is that why your parents cut you off, Malfoy?” said Harry, unable to keep the anger out of his voice.
“She didn’t like it.”
“Hermione? No, why? Not that she’s not lovely, mind.”
“You think this is making history?” Parvati raised an eyebrow, and Hermione sighed. “Yeah, yeah. You got me. I’m sorry.”
“Fine,” said Draco, before bellowing “Morag! Seamus!” into the crowd.
She sniffed. “Yeah. I definitely lean one way, though. And I think you do too.”
“Really?” said Dean. “Because we could hear the arguments from our floor.”
“I don’t. It hurt so much. Sometimes it still does. That’s me. A collection of scars.”
“What is the point?”
A week later, Draco still wasn’t talking to him and Harry was still mad about it.
“What?”
“Susan would murder you,” said Hermione.
“We were headed somewhere. I think.” She stirred her cocktail absently. “Nothing happened. A couple of ‘let’s learn how to kiss’ kisses, a few things we didn’t talk about. You know I wanted to kill Ron Weasley for the whole of fifth year? I could never work out why he annoyed me so much.”
Harry leant forward and stroked it, the long smooth line of the skull, the delicate fractures around the sockets. “Do you ever think you might get it covered up?”
Hermione had hmm’d and left him to it, and then a day later there was a prospectus on his bed open on a page about a new, experimental degree in Teaching Magic, and there was a recommended reading list, and a week later Harry had a future.
“Go to bed, Harry,” muttered Draco, and he did.
“What if he starts on the both of them? I mean, Pansy’s not at uni. He could conceivably have them both on the go. I should have listened to you in sixth year, Harry. He’s Malfoy. He could be up to anything.”
said Pansy, and then went bright red.
Draco slung an arm around his shoulders. “We’re in the same boat, you and me. Horrible fuckers, both of them. We’re better than that.”
“What the fuck was that,” he said. “Seriously, Zabini, that was insane. You’re insane.”
“Hermione, you’re not – “ He broke off. “Oh, shit.”
“I’m all right,” said Harry, thinking of Draco’s smile and his looks. “I think they’re all checking that Ron’s a good enough partner for Pansy. Let me just go say bye.”
“Sure,” said Harry. He leaned into kiss him one more time, but Draco turned his face away, and Harry tried to ignore how that made him feel. He leapt off the bed and started flinging his clothes on, trying to ignore the fact that he was going to have to wash them thoroughly to make sure they didn’t stink of cum forever. Or possibly burn them. What did cum smell like when it burned? Would everyone in the flat know what he was doing?
Sometimes, thought Morag, being the voice of lesbian reason was a thankless fucking job. She knew this, because everyone else was back at the flat celebrating their big romcom ending, and she was off to sacrifice a bottle of her best whiskey in the name of gay solidarity.
“Merlin, Potter, yes.”
“Potter,” Malfoy hissed again, and then – “Please.”
Blaise looked poleaxed. Then he turned around kissed her. It was a filthy kiss, but astonishingly the filthiness was coming from Susan, not Blaise. He looked – reverent.
“I was worried that no one would ever really, really want me.”
“Don’t start.”
Thankfully, there was the bang of the kitchen door flying open, and then –
“But I don’t really smoke – “ It had no effect. Blaise dragged them out to the beer garden – empty, predictably, on a Tuesday night – and almost threw Harry at a bench, before sitting down heavily opposite him.
“I love you,” he said, knowing the music was too loud for him to ever be heard.
He let himself be pulled through the crowd to a dark corner, let himself move as Seamus shuffled un-coordinated against him. Tried to let the music distract him from the way he was getting harder. The lights turned Seamus’s eyes alien, iridescent. The first thing he’d ever wanted to paint at Hogwarts was those eyes.
“No. Sorry.”
“Not nervous this time, then?”
“Don’t be a berk, it’s not silly,” said Ron. “Seems like yonks ago it was just us three vs the world, doesn’t it?”
“Because I was so worried about doing the
He pictured just grabbing Draco’s face and saying
“I bet,” he said, grinning. He really was ridiculously good looking, with a chiselled face and delicate green eyes. “So how was eighth year at Hogwarts? Did a DADA teacher finally turn out to be useful and non-evil?”
The gin was neat. It burnt on the way down, and Harry sat down heavily on the bench, coughing.
“Harry – “
“OMG Hermione, no way. You’re not in this flat too, are you?”
“Yeah,” said Ron, tearing his gaze away from Pansy. “That’s my question too.”
“Really? I’m the strangest man you’ve ever met? What about you?”
“Tell her how I feel?”
“An inspiration to us all,” said Malfoy. “Oi, barkeep, where’s my staff discount on this round?”
“Bones.” There was Blaise. “How about we forget about that and focus on the flowers and the sprig of mistletoe – “
“Yes, and? You like men! And I think it’s strange that we’re still called girls when you’re all men now – Draco, why are you laughing?”
“That’s not why people liked you,” said Harry. “Blaise still likes you now, doesn’t he? And Theo. And Pansy is still your friend, presumably.”
“But you’re going to watch and laugh, right?” said Harry.
“Great,” said Hermione, opening the door. “You’ve had a revelation. I’m so hungover that I’d willingly welcome death right now, so I’ll probably just be making “uh-huh” noises a lot while you talk. Maybe sprinkle in a few “yeah, sures” for variety.”
“You should call me Harry, you know.”
“Oh.”
“Can you tell I’ve been crying?” said Hermione, grabbing his arm.
“Parvati!”
“I mostly just stood there looking impressive while he did the work.”
Blaise waved a hand. “Oh no no, inner circle only. But it’s going to be dazzling! I’ll decorate, and expand the kitchen, and we can have a proper bartender – and a band, Harry, let’s have a band! Dancing is the most romantic thing in the world. It is lovemaking in clothes, as my mother always used to say.”
She sniffed. “Cedric wouldn’t want me pouring peach puree over a surface in his memory. We must honour his wishes.”
“Is he still talking about this?” said Morag. Parvati mimed shooting herself.
The door opened, just a crack. Harry saw a small, white face, and then it slammed shut again. Dean made another lunge for the door as it closed, but Blaise had him tight. They struggled together for a while, and then Dean just collapsed, shaking into Blaise’s arms.
There was a frantic hammering on the door. Harry looked at his watch. It was one in the morning, which meant that this was either Hermione coming to have another mental breakdown, or Draco – no. He clamped down on that hard. It wouldn’t be Draco.
“It’s fine, Theo,” said Malfoy. “Potter and I were just clearing the air. Carry on.”
“Well,” said Harry, “that was – “
“Beat that bitch from the Falcons to the snitch,” said Ginny.
“Because you were a – “
“You also told me I was gay at the same time,” said Harry.
“Well, not everyone. I imagine Anthony and Terry will be a little disappointed to find out.”
“Is it murder?” said Pansy. “Because you know I’d cover that up for you, love.”
“There are three,” said Pansy.
“Don’t encourage him,” said Dean.
“Greengrass had a crush on you.”
“Listen, Ron,” said Hermione, just as Susan yelled “Just stop it!” and they all crowded towards the door to peek through the slats.
“Have you tried talking to them about it?”
“Seamus – “
“I can see that now,” Ron yelled back. “I mean, five seconds of seeing you with Malfoy – “
struggling to think of
By the time she was on her seventh cocktail – this one called a
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Might go and sit in my room and emotionally numb myself again. You?”
He gripped Draco by the small of his back, dragging him foreword. He used every inch of his height, tilting Draco back. One of his hands stroked Draco’s throat, tugging on the short licks of hair at the nape of his neck. He felt the moment Draco broke and started kissing him back, earnest and messy and desperate. And in his head, he was already doing the calculations – could he get Draco up on the kitchen table? How quickly could he drag them back to his rooms and get him out of those robes?
Draco sighed. “So much for that iron Celtic constitution. Where’s Morag when you need her?”
Or rather, just in time to make the hurt irreversible. Maybe the fact that he’d paused would give Draco a reason to think he didn’t mean it. Maybe he could play it off as something else.
Draco laughed. “And the great Harry Potter always gets what he wants, of course.”
“Is that right?” said Seamus, pushing a small heap of coins across at him.
“You’re not those things anymore.”
“What the fuck was that?” Seamus exploded, as soon as Blaise was out of earshot. “Just as soon as I’m beginning to think he’s all right, he goes and carries on like that in front of us.”
Nott did come, which slightly freaked Harry out, thinking about what he might have seen last Sunday morning. Not that there had been anything to see, because nothing had happened.
She threw a pillow and Parvati caught it, laughing. “What I’m trying to say is – can I talk to you about this? Ron and Harry weren’t great at talking about guys.”
November was a time of stress and deadlines and throwing herself back into all the extra-curriculars that Hermione hadn’t had time for what with the boys and the Parvati of it all. Not that she wasn’t still finding time for her friends. Probably.
She did, actually, her cheekbones magnified. “Yeah. You look great. I’m glad you’ve got a girl friend.”
“Does it involve nudity?” said Harry, who had heard a great many Blaise stories on the champagne night.
Parvati laughed. “Don’t let Harry hear you say that.”
“If you try and snog me, Potter, I will murder you.”
It was
He popped in, hugged Ron and gave him a whispered explanation, getting a thumbs up in return. He waved at the Slytherin’s, breezily ignoring their wails to stay and Draco’s knowing look. When he came outside, Dean was rubbing his thumb across the chalk of the specials board.
“Hmm.” Draco sat down in the chair opposite Harry and tapped his nails thoughtfully against the desk. “Yes, ok. Casting an Unforgivable is wrong, right?”
They made their way to the back, Hermione and Parvati close behind, to find Ron waiting at a table behind a rope with Pansy Parkinson who was – well. She was wearing what looked like a lacy bra, and a skirt so short that Harry had to do a double take, with a leather jacket over it that could give Morag’s closet a run for it’s money in terms of projecting “don’t fucking talk to me.” She caught sight of them arm in arm, looked censoriously at Draco, and finished her drink.
Very quickly - this chapter contains a reference to hair-related racism that Hermione has experience, and includes a character openly describing a lot of internalised homophobia.
done to deserve you being this rude to my face?”
“A what?”
He fled upstairs, looking ruffled (ruffled for him just meant that his walk was 10% less smooth, of course). Morag raised her eyebrows.
“What’s - happening,” Michael chocked.
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying and failing not to think about how it would be different. He felt a small ache for the comforting presence of Ron. The thing about Dean and Seamus was that they were a set, and it wasn’t one that you could break into. It had been ok when it was him and Ron, but now – well. He mentally apologised to Neville, always the one without a best friend.
“Ugh.” Hermione took a deep drink. “Kill Michael. He’s smart, but he’s just so immature. And I get the sense that he likes that I’m smart, but would prefer it if I was just smart enough to follow what he’s saying but not smart enough to sometimes disagree, you know? You know Ginny broke up with him because Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw?”
“Hatesex,” said Hermione, knowingly. “Parvati says that that’s amazing.”
“Don’t worry, Potter, there’s no need for murder today. This is just a friendly chat about Michael’s future at university, right?” He kicked Michael onto his side. “You have two options, Michael. Option one, you are going to tell the university that you have come down with Dragon Pox, and immediately leave to stay with your family while they nurse your back to health. While you’re there, you’ll have a sudden realisation about your future and put every possible second of your time into transferring somewhere that is
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
“Fine! But then I get to decide if I hate him too.”
“Hermione has dumped Michael Corner,” said Susan, still bright red. “We’re avoiding an awkward situation.”
“But you,” said Blaise, stepping forward. “You are real. I tried to hide from it for so long. I wrapped it up in jokes and tried to sell you my cheap charm. And you wouldn’t take it. You made it clear that nothing except the entirety of myself would be enough. And I still tried to cheat you, tonight. I hoped that wish a little glitz and glamour and flowers I could sway you. I should have known.”
“George is opening a nightclub,” said Ron. They’d managed to meet up on a Saturday, Ron’s auror training finally giving him a bit of room to breathe, and were camped out in The Leaky. Harry had spent so long in Muggle pubs that seeing drinks bobbing through the air had taken on a bit of novelty again. “He’s inviting most of our year to the opening, I think. Wants to make it a paparazzi event.”
“No.”
“Um.”
“Apart from that brief interlude where you dated the most famous quidditch player in the world,” said Harry.
Harry smiled. “I’m sorry about all the times I was blatantly Dumbledore’s favourite. I know that must have pissed you off, trying so hard to win the house cup. God, it seems like forever ago that that actually mattered, right? I’m sorry about that time in the Forbidden Forest, in first year. I’m not sure
“I don’t know, mate.” Seamus threw up his hands. “It’s not like we asked him.”
She apparated.
and he still missed him. Not even the sex – well, no, he missed the sex but that wasn’t it. He missed Draco’s mean comments about his hair. He missed Draco’s histrionics, the way he turned his feelings into an unbelievable drama to try and undercut their sincerity. He missed laughing with him about something, and then turning his face towards Draco’s and catching them with the same look in their eyes –
Ron deflated. “Sorry Harry. It’s just, I really like her face, you know?” Harry had to physically restrain himself from saying the word ‘Pugface’, but Ron must have seen it. “I know she’s not, like, ‘pretty’ or whatever, but she’s better than that. It’s an interesting face.”
He really, really hated house parties.
“It was a pretty good club,” said Blaise. “Weasley might really have something there. My night was – fine.”
“What?”
“Draco –“
by having a civil conversation.
Susan, Morag and Terry were eventually pulled out of their rooms by the music and the promise of alcohol. Morag was no less scary and cool than she’d been in the DA, with a thick Scottish accent and a shaved head. She also had a hole in her ear, about the width of Harry’s little finger, through which she wore a thick black spiral.
It did indeed. “Look, Hermione’s a big girl. And she’s seeing Anthony Goldstein, anyway.”
“Good rule.”
She barrelled through the crowd without looking, ignoring Terry as he called after her. She barely noticed when she ran smack dab into a familiar, welcoming chest.
is a fan.”
“No, like. I really don’t understand.”
“I’d be enjoying this. I’d love getting to see me humiliated.”
“What? Potter, don’t tell me I missed something out.”
“Steady on. Look, you were pretty good to me when I was ostracized, and you had no bloody reason to, so I’m going to give you advice even though I think you’re being a wanker again. You should just talk to Harry. You miss him, you miss everyone, just say whatever will get you through this weirdness and go back to being everyone’s friend.”
“I don’t know what right and wrong is anymore,” he said an hour and a half later, pouring over the notes he’d managed to take in the lecture (mostly question marks and the occasional name). “I knew, Hermione. I knew and then that man broke me.”
Harry stared at her. “What?”
There was something very important in that sentence that Harry was missing, he knew it. “No straight boys. Got it. And maybe no Malfoy.”
“Hermione…”
Malfoy get a job in a muggle pub? For some reason, the thought filled Harry with rage. Malfoy had just – he’d stood in a tower with a wand raised at Dumbledore unable to fire, and then he’d barely spoken at his trial and disappeared for eighth year, and now he was here at uni, trying to get a job in a pub as if he was some sort of normal bloke instead of – instead of Malfoy.
“Right,” he said, removing his hand from her cheek. “Yes. So much more.”
“Are you?”
They sat down. There was a leaden silence. And then Draco said “Oh, I suppose I need a drink, don’t I?” and Hermione said “Yes, I’ll help,” and then there was just Harry and Pansy Parkinson.
“Who’s they?”
As far as Harry could tell, he was the only one who was
But Draco was puffing himself up and gesturing threateningly at Harry with his drink. “Let’s lay down some ground rules. Shots only, Malfoy’s do not ‘chug’. We each take it in turns picking the spirit. You vomit, you’re out. You pass out, you’re out. You leave this table for any reason and you’re out, Potter, so take your loo break now.”
“Harry,” said Hermione. “You really shouldn’t.”
“Fine! Just do it, then –“ But Harry had started moving on fine, and he cut Draco off with his lips.
“Best to make sure,” said Harry, and Blaise finally drew his wand and threw a stinging jinx across Michael’s back.
“Ron is Pansy’s partner? In auror training?”
Hermione leant forward, and rested her head against her friends shoulder. “You won’t ever be ordinary, Parvati. You’re astonishing. You’re so many things, all at once.”
“You win?”
“Ok, it’s just – I thought I knew what love looked like. And in my head, it looked like Ron and Hermione. It was familiar, and comforting, and safe. And you – you are none of those things. I guess I thought they would always get back together, because that’s what love is, right? But today – not just Ron and Hermione, all of them. Love isn’t safe. Love is reckless and terrifying and comes at you with no warning. Love is Blaise Zabini braving a Muggle supermarket because he’s out of ideas, and love is Pansy refusing to be beaten down by Theo, and hell, maybe sometimes love is actual, terrible pain.”
“And I couldn’t look away,” said Harry. “I think about you every second, do you understand? Even before we were shagging, I couldn’t stop thinking –“
“Now there’s a twist I didn’t see coming,” said Blaise. Next to him, Ron had switched from red to white.
Dean laughed, but it didn’t quite meet his eyes. “Yeah, I suppose. Where’s Hermione, by the way?”
Ron turned ghost white, and Harry and Hermione clutched each other and howled.
“How?”
“For the holidays?”
“Potter,” said Malfoy, his voice a low growl. “Please stop staring at me in shock and tell me what you’re thinking right now.”
“You’re over-exaggerating,” said Hermione.
She huddled closer to him. One of his hands settled on her head, and began to softly stroke.
Harry privately thought that another inch would have made it a belt, but he decided not to say that. Which left them all standing around in silence, until Ron elbowed Pansy, who elbowed him back. The two had a very intense conversation that seemed to involve mostly eyebrows, winks (Ron’s) and scowls (all Pansy’s) until finally she sighed.
“Don’t,” she said.
“Cocky tosser.”
Seamus looked at Dean, then at Harry, who kept his eyes firmly downward. “I’m just saying, we won’t be able to have any more drinks with him.”
“I know,” said Harry. “I mean – it just seems wrong that I haven’t kissed you yet.”
There’d been a day at the Burrow, with Molly making teasing comments about when Ron was going to ask Arthur for one of his grandmother’s rings. Arthur had leant over and clasped his wife’s hand, and Molly had leant into his touch, looking at him like he made the sun rise.
“What?” said Hermione, her voice barely above a shriek.
“Probably,” said Harry. Except that Malfoy had been hanging around like a sad-sack, that day in the kitchen, and it had made Harry feel worse. He’d been shaking. And even if he wasn’t up to no good, there were still questions floating around him. Why had his parents dropped him? Why had he lowered himself to working in a Muggle pub? For seven years, Harry had thought he knew pretty much everything that Malfoy was thinking, and now he didn’t have a bloody clue.
She dipped her fingers in her glass and flicked champagne at him.
“I’m probably over-reacting,” Susan said, lying on her bed. “I mean, it’s kind of my fault.”
“Most of the time, no. But you were just then. I have it!”
“Oh fuck, you did? Really?”
loneliness.”
“Why not?” Dean’s tone was a marvel. He had drawn himself up to his full height – not inconsiderable – and was staring Seamus straight down. He looked polite, questioning, a little confused, as if someone had just presented him with the wrong dish at a restaurant. Only his eyes and his voice were hard as ice. Harry uncomfortably remembered that Dean had spent most of the war living underground, on the run from the government, and was perhaps not quite the affable chap that Harry remembered.
She was staring at the ground. He stepped forward, gentle.
“Pity Ron’s in auror training – ow!” Dean had elbowed Seamus in the side, and was looking at Hermione in a way that was meant to be stealthy. Seamus, never one for subtlety, elbowed him back. “What was that for?”
“Your artform?”
“Hello, Pansy,” said Harry. “You look – dressed.”
He went to Hermione next, because she was usually more coherent than Ron. He took her out to a nice place just off Diagon two days before Blaise’s party, and was about to raise the problem of Draco sodding Malfoy when Hermione looked up and gasped.
