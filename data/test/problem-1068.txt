They both looked unhappy at that.
Harry stood up. "Thanks, Ron. That's been really helpful. I need to talk to Snape."
Harry could see benefits to that. Pansy needed to remember that he wasn't
Creevy grinned. "I have a keyhole periscope, sir. Very hard to see in shadow. But I've been looking through Thornton's things, and I made a discovery."
"All right in there?" Blaise called.
Draco sunk back, clutching his side of the ring.  "Yes. Trust you to notice."
After dinner, the Gryffindors returned en masse to their common room. Harry spent a while with Ron and Hermione, chatted for a few minutes with Seamus and Parvati, said hello to Rob, Sammy, and Yolanda, and then headed up to his room. Neville was there, but studying quietly on his bed. After greeting him, Harry collected parchment and ink, and settled at the desk.
I'm not going to know what any of his expressions
"Er..." Neville straightened. "I suppose it depends," he said, with more composure than Harry would have expected. "I'll tell you at the end of the evening, shall I?" With that, he turned fractionally towards Linnet, the room's only other occupant, and Harry had to move quickly to introduce them. By that time, the Ravenclaws were in the room, and Sophia was presenting a wide-eyed blond girl with a placid smile as Luna Lovegood.
"Lubricant," Harry said fiercely. "And let us go!"  He wrenched a shoulder forward to no avail.
As the two gathered crackers and cheese and spoonfuls of preserves, Draco turned to survey the room. "I believe everyone has arrived. Considering the new attendees, should we start with introductions?"
“Not yet.”  He looked up. “It won’t do any good until the curse is lifted.”
Harry shrugged. "You know I will."
"Oh. Well, exaggerated." Harry shrugged. "Though we did overdo it sometimes. Especially me, I suppose."
After the door closed behind them, Snape shook his hair back, shoulders settling, and set off at a brisk walk. Harry had to jog to catch up.
"I don't even know what it means!" Susan complained.
"Professor Sprout called me in on Monday," Susan offered. "'Now, dear, I'm sure it's nothing, but you understand I must ask...'"
"Nothing. They're brilliant. And I have to try to appreciate them and not be jealous."
Snape frowned at him. Draco cleared his throat. "Well, yes," he said, "but you mostly just fight. Or rather, you fight, and then one of you sulks, and then you send him a conciliatory letter or he sends you an expensive present, and then you maintain strained civility until the next fight. He's not at all happy about you being in Slytherin, and his attitude toward Professor Snape is execrable."
As soon as he started for the sideboard, Professor Snape was in his path. "Here," he said, shoving a heavy goblet into Harry's hands. "I won't have you downing a quart of Narcissa's brew and falling in the fountain."
Ron rolled his eyes. “
"What are you talking about?" asked Susan. "Stealing things?"
Draco shot him a challenging look, but didn't argue.  Fifteen minutes later, they were outside the wall of the rose garden, too close to it to be seen from the castle windows, spreading out the loot from an over-laden basket. Harry wasn't surprised at the first word out of Draco's mouth.
"That takes some doing!" Draco exclaimed. "Still, he's mostly thought of as a misplaced Hufflepuff."
the sort of thing that has Remus worried."
Potter made another attempt to shake the hair back from his eyes. Draco leaned forward and pushed it to the side for him. Potter's eyes were very close, and very green.
"Combined transfiguration, Ron, remember?"
"How did he react?" Harry asked, worried.
"Still owed?"
George snorted. "Think much of yourself?"
Dean's brow furrowed.
he thought, but he caught the words before they came out. Answers like that were fine when he didn't care (or was trying not to care) what people thought, but hadn't he and Draco decided that they not only should care, but should make an effort to sway others?
"I see." Snape looked curiously at him. "How
"Oh. Sorry."
--" the girl began, but then the boy took off again. "Not
"What?" Finding Draco still steadfastly looking away, Harry bumped against him. "Yeah, I told you what you had wrong. And from a few words of information, you
"Education," Harry said firmly. "If you are going to attempt to change my personality, you should at least learn what it is."
Sirius shrugged. "Preservative spells, sometimes, but not on this, because we get it fresh each morning.  Muggles
"Eh." Draco shrugged. "That's what you're here for, right? And I'm not wrong. I was worried about Harry;
"Oh, you
By the time Defense Against the Dark Arts was over, Harry was thinking more clearly. During the free period that should have been Potions, he sent Hedwig off to Remus and then let Draco distract him with tutoring in the Cypher charm. At lunch, Professor McGonagall and Flitwick had returned, but Snape was still absent, and during Charms, Draco passed on a message to Harry from the Slytherin hearth box.
"Gryffindor colors for battle or danger?" Linnet suggested.
harm a witch unnecessarily." He looked significantly over to the side. "Your wand, on the other hand.... I don't think you deserve that."
He led Draco to the bed as if they were walking on eggshells. Draco sat down and tugged his hand, so Harry sat, half-facing him.  For a long moment, they just stared at each other, and then both of them laughed tensely.
"Remus!"
Harry groaned. "Give me at least a week or two."
"With my brother?"
"Of course you
"-- to a Slytherin."
"I expect I do."
"So you're totally gay."
She shuddered. "Yes. It was so strange, touching you and having your face be in the wrong place. My fingertips looked like they were
"So it's Dark Arts as well?" Harry returned, amused.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Only to Lavender; you know how she can be.”
Harry thought the question too sharp, but Draco did not seem to mind. He rolled his eyes. "As I haven't looked at it, I cannot say. Given a
Harry smiled, even as he prepared himself to argue. "So your point is that I should accept that I don't get a list of names?"
"I am terribly sorry to disappoint you, but I do not see sufficient gain, in this case."
"Oh!" Her eyes widened. "Right. Which is why there were some mild effects at the beginning too. If they were people he liked or didn't know...."
Harry felt his face heating.
"Mm. You were holding me in silent comfort while I gathered my composure, and the firm warmth of my body against yours overwhelmed your senses and eroded your self control...."
“True.” Remus slid his arm through Sirius’s. “He was supposed to stay out of sight at Hagrid’s while I found you.” He gave Harry a little bow. “So. You and your friends are invited to dine with us tonight – sadly, not in public, due to security considerations, but up at the castle. Headmaster Dumbledore has promised a private room for our use.”
"So, why might the Quieting Charm be beneath it?" Hecksban prompted.
"Do you mind if we stay, Harry?"
"I don't want you as Dark Lord, Harry."
"It wasn't that much either."
"I don't recall that you enjoyed it with Fenrir."
common scrying liquids are often ruined by the addition of blood. For
She frowned. "In what way 'less'?"
Harry shrugged. He wasn't sure Zabini qualified. "Wait then. I'll stay in sight."
Harry nodded and took a shaky breath.  Malfoy's beauty was a bit more intimidating when it was too far away to seize.  "I think you must be the most gorgeous person I've ever seen. Sexier than any natural girl."
He had nearly finished the answers that were due the next morning in Potions -- which were not entirely untouched earlier, despite what he had told Ron and Hermione -- when the door opened. Seymour, his shoulders set back as firmly as a warrior's, led in a reluctant-looking Ruthven. Harry wanted to help, but thought he might be a hindrance.
She looked anxiously back at Ron. "You're certain he's not in danger?"
"Umbridge?" Snape asked in surprise. "Deputy Minister of the Office of Bureaucratic Oversight? She generally levies fees, in this world."
The Gryffindors, despite the warning, had a harder time tracking a team in all different colors, and the Slytherins quickly racked up forty points. When Gryffindor adjusted and started to score again, Malfoy raised his arm and shouted. On the ground, Pansy Parkinson released the tarp.
"Slytherin Common Room?" Harry asked blandly.
"I have not embedded a guard in her house against her will. I still hope to persuade her to accept one. For now, someone is staying near enough to respond to an attack."
There were three of them. Harry recognized Kingsley Shacklebolt immediately. It would have been reassuring that someone in Dumbledore's confidence was there, if it hadn't been for the other two -- Special Inquisitor Valerian Cabot, and Auror Mason, who had come to Hogwarts with Tonks weeks ago. Harry looked nervously at Tonks.
"Well, that's the thing," Harry said. "I usually don't. I usually
Harry snorted. "No. There's a lot more to it than that, but I can't talk about it."
"You're not a substitute, okay?"
than mine, as far as I can tell. I mean, not as people," he added hastily, at her frown. "But they don't have many mixed bloods, and no Muggleborns, as far as I can tell, and the mixed-bloods hide it, so they don't know what we don't know." That was a complete jumble. He didn't think he was doing a good job of this. After breakfast, he might have been clearer.
"And so much for our--" Past the thought of their enhanced Bludger, Harry suddenly imagined trying to play against a team that was wearing what would look like different uniforms. "Oh, that will be chaos!" he exclaimed. "I don't suppose the password is in there?"
Draco stepped towards him. "And we might, you realize, find reasonable compromises to all those things, even were they all true."
“But the curse is gone, right?” Ron pressed, looking to Hecksban. The professor nodded.
Harry shrugged. "Sure. I have to bring these berries down the dungeons, though."
"The literal animal was specified, Weasley," Draco answered, rolling his eyes. "And we're getting distracted. What if I make this set cylindrical?
Harry mimicked Draco's eye roll. "Then
"Well, we're all here talking to each other, aren't we? So he has more information, and more people he can ask if he needs something."
"Do you know about imitative construction in glamours?" Hermione asked him eagerly. "I had the idea that one should start first with a subtle element, but Harry says you should start with the basic changes."
"Honestly, would you talk to her, please? I've told her what I know, but that's not much."
interested in emulating your bad language."
"He's a logical choice, really."
someone on the other side," Severus hissed.  "A source--"
Measuring glances shot across the rough circle like a rain of darts.
"Oh."
"Mm."
Ron shuddered. "Well, with any luck, we won't need to go that far, and if we do, it should be enough."
He had been afraid that his memory of Millicent would show some flaw in her glamour. It did not. However, he had forgotten how Draco had been holding Hugh Cecilius back, and he had not consciously noticed how Hugh looked contemptuous, and Draco rather fondly tolerant, as he berated Mill. Until, that was, his final proclamation hit home.  Cecilius, derailed by confusion, ceased to strain forward, but Draco winced before a frown of calculation tightened his face. He was, no doubt, considering what protection Harry might be offering his larger and less threatened classmate.
Seamus whooped. "Not so hopeless, I think."
Once they had settled who was bringing what, they left the Uncommon Room. At the stairs, Ron and Hermione headed up, presumably to Gryffindor, and Harry and Draco accompanied Millicent and Blaise down, but only to the second floor, where they turned into the corridor.
, Harry," Draco said. "This supports our goal for the year, does it not? To be seen as a preferable alternative to the Dark Lord, you must first be
"Because you can't marry until the hedge re-grows?"
Breakfast was a far more informal affair than dinner, in an airy conservatory with potted orange and lemon trees, some in bloom and some in fruit. Before one of the tall windows, a flowering tree behind her, Narcissa sat at a small wrought iron table. Her empty dish and cutlery were pushed to one side, and she sipped from a tea cup as she studied a letter in her hand, and then put it on a small stack of others.  Draco picked two oranges in passing, handing one to Harry as they reached the table. From there, Harry could just see Snape seated at the far end of the room, half obscured by dark leaves and bent over a thick book.
Harry nodded. "My aunt and uncle claimed they did, though they knew perfectly well, so I got in trouble anyway."
know, it's from Camellia Cornwithel's
"What makes that the curse?"
Harry squeezed his eyes shut to swallow. Draco watched lines in his skin soften as the muscles relaxed, though his eyes stayed closed. His shoulders, with a slight roll, settled. He exhaled. Finally, his eyes opened.
"Such wonderful music. Do you suppose
"Great!" Harry said, at Millicent's eighth attempt.
"Exactly."
"Perhaps one of those girls was a witch," Malfoy said. "Do you remember the girls? Saturday night?"
"Where were you?"
Harry tried to glare, but his scowl failed with a laugh. "You know I have. Git."
"She says 'Papa,' actually, but you are right about the sentiment. I found her crying in the Common Room an hour after lights out, last night."
Harry wondered if he should move off of Draco and lie down where they could see each other's faces. Draco, though, might just keep his face hidden in the sheets.
Snape rolled his eyes.  "What do you expect? You gave me a potion, if you recall."
"I invoke your reputation more readily than you do, that's all."  Draco made a face. "
"I don't think you see at all," Draco said, his head haughtily high.
"We left rather a mess, didn't we?"
"Mm." Remus folded his hands on the tabletop in front of him. "And what if something happens to you? Will anyone know to raise the alarm?"
"Why not?" Draco said coldly. "I would be useless to her. Or no." He gestured dismissal, perhaps to some wayward idea. "No, it would be easily fixed by
"Maybe." Draco's brow crinkled as he looked at Harry. "What does it matter to you?"
"Someone must have spoken while you were in the butcher's shop."

people were just shocked."
"Has it been bad? I watched you read the
"Harry?" Hermione said quietly. "Would you go, please?"
"Oh!" Hermione exclaimed.
Millicent nodded. Harry studied her for a moment. "I'd love to end it first," he said, "but we still don't have photographs."
"Dean Thomas," Seamus said.
"Nott escaped!" Harry retorted, shoving the paper at him.
"Perhaps, but I have far more experience in evaluating and mitigating risk. I had hoped that you would trust that."
Harry blew out a breath as if they were truly running. "Yeah.  Well, at least I'll be showing up sober."
"What is that like?"  Draco asked, as they left Snape's rooms the next week. Snape had just worked with Harry on energy manipulation for a second time. In between had been a more standard lesson in wandless magic.
Coming through the portrait hole, Ron lost his balance and staggered.
"I'll bring my invisibility cloak. You have the right to be there."
"-- for a Malfoy."
"I would hope so," Draco said, "It's rather more complicated, and we have two matters of inquiry." He looked to the side. "Harry, perhaps you should go first."
There was no way to see Snape tonight, but the Slytherin Quidditch team had another practice scheduled for tomorrow, right before dinner. That would keep Draco from interfering.
"You're not my mum, Hermione!"
But then, the post owls arrived. Cornelia sat back, probably to wait out the chaos and resume, but a long-eared owl among the crowd swooped down to Harry.
Ron's face was burning by now. "We never did that much," he claimed.
--" Blaise let out a sharp breath. "Yeah. I have barely enough left for NEWTs... so, yeah."
How are things at the Burrow?
"No more than an hour or two." Shacklebolt stood back. "Let's try a test. Tell me your name is Terrence Blurt, and you're an internationally famous Quodpot star."
"You're --" Harry bit his lip. "You're really going to let me do this, aren't you?"
"Are you here?"
"The conniving bastard. 'Delusions of persecution' indeed!" He raised his head to look at Harry. "I can't believe he had the gall to try to cast
Ron's eyes widened. "Oh," he said, and then, stumbling, "I suppose ... s'pose I can understand that. Maybe." He managed a lopsided smile. "If he wasn't Malfoy."
Tuesday, when Harry's NEWT Potions lesson went until lunch, Professor Snape had him stay after. The look he got from Hermione was more warning than sympathy; Draco, his lips tight, tucked her arm in his to lead her politely away. Courtly attention from Draco, Harry mused as they departed, still tended to disarm her.
"So," Draco said. "I am informed that your contribution to the party was the only liquid you had after the match."
"None of that, mate," he said to Harry. "If I can put up with you kissing Malfoy, who's not just a man, but a git who's gone after me again and again, you can't frown about me and a girl you like."
After practice, Ginny started to ask him about something, but then, catching herself, turned to Cornelia instead. With a nod for them both, Harry left the pitch and cut across the brown grass toward Greenhouse Four.
had done too, Harry," Sirius said firmly, taking the pan off the heat and stepping over to lay a strong hand on Harry's shoulder. "We were all involved. We got caught up in it, you know, and it seemed like such a clever idea.
, of course."
"It wasn't a threat! It was a snippet of information. I'm not responsible if they draw the wrong conclusions!"
how well we research together."
Nodding agreement, Harry took a sip and looked down to watch his body change. It was really rather disturbing, but he still thought he had nice breasts. Admiringly, he scooped his hand under one and ran his thumb in to the nipple.
I understand why Draco invited me."
"Practically glowing," Ginny agreed. "In a not-pleasant sort of way. And would someone--"
"What?"
"Voldemort
Harry laughed. "None, really. Well, maybe fit, but not my thing. One of the Slytherins."
"Well?" Draco demanded.
Amused at being the expert on something so unimportant, Harry leaned back in his chair. "Has multiple tails, usually flat -- the whole thing is milder than a whip, on average, but they vary a lot based on the weight and width and number of the tails. Oh, and the length of them. And material -- all of mine are some sort of leather."
," he said.
The afternoon was beautiful -- fresh and sunny and just warm enough, and the Gryffindor Common Room was almost empty when Harry went up to his dormitory to fetch his invisibility cloak. Rolled up tightly, it made only a small bulge in his frock coat, and it left him a discreet means of retreating if the Maypole excursion was tedious, or worse. He walked down the hill, vaguely near other stragglers, but not
"As long as he didn't get to talking about the war," Draco said. "That could be trouble all around."
"Millicent will have wine," Draco countered.  Harry shrugged.
"Oh really, Harry!" Sirius waved the matter away.
Draco nodded. "True. He's a Gryffindor -- emotional and impetuous. Pansy's response is more deliberate; rather than complete silence, I find myself at a measured distance, intended to express disapproval, softening when she perceives a potential break between us."
at all, much less that sort. Pansy does."
He shuddered, imaging how that would look to the school. “For how long?”
Her head came up with a choking cough. "I'm sorry -- Did you just refer to the Head of the Pernicious Activities Division as 'Kingsley'?"
"Mrs. Weasley is in the area, you know. She worked at Beatrice's Bits and Bobs during the school year, and Beatrice wanted some extra help this week. She was hoping to speak to you."
"Okay."
Harry was too disturbed at the thought of channeling Voldemort's power to speculate. Numbly, he shook his head.
"In silver, yes. I trust there is some reason for that bizarre request?" As he spoke, Snape removed a small pouch from each of his side pockets. From the way they pulled down on their strings, they were heavy, and Harry was not surprised when Severus tapped the first one with his wand and it quadrupled in size. He did the same with the second.
"Understood," Snape answered. "Do you wish to learn the spell?"
all that, weren't you? Getting your lies in place--"
"If it was that, I wouldn't have to leave."
"But portkeys--"
"Is there room?" Draco looked doubtfully around the bed.
"Diagnostically," Draco shot back, and with the eye away from Snape, winked at Harry. Harry grinned back and stepped readily into a kiss.
"Safe?"
"Gryffindor," Draco sniffed.
, Potter, not be blinded by your expectations."
"I supplied the money to buy the place, partially in exchange for the right to stay there. We drew up a contract and everything.  Draco insisted on that, so he could put in a secrecy clause that would keep them from telling anyone."
"No. This is how we started talking this summer. We ran into each other -- literally -- in the bookshop, when I was invisible, and I was helping her pick up her books, and saw
to me as a friend yesterday."
Harry had planned to look for Draco after his conference, but there was no need. When he stepped out of McGonagall's office, Draco pushed off from the opposite wall of the corridor. "Shall we walk?" he said, by way of greeting.
"I saw a flutter. I think he's coming to." A small hand pressed along Harry's cheek. "Are you there, Harry? You're in St. Mungo's."
Blaise looked amused. "And you'll still have trouble. True. Do you care what sort of wine?"
He and Ron both sniggered and Harry made his voice go girlish. "But my robes were splashed in Herbology! You can't expect me to attend class in
There was a moment in which everyone sat frozen by his words. "Parvati should, I think," Padma said finally. Harry wasn't sure if it was sisterly loyalty, or that Parvati was sitting to her left. No one objected though, and Harry raised his glass in an approving salute, and Parvati started.
"Um..." Harry looked between them, searching for any sign that this was an elaborate joke. "That was real, too?"
Draco sounded a little surprised. He would ask later, Harry decided -- for now, he needed to move. He kept the first push slow, Draco's tight grip a torturous delight.
"You IDIOT!"
"Curious?"
"Merlin!" Malfoy exclaimed. "We should talk to your father-- No, wait." For a moment, he just stood, bending back his fingers as he thought, while Harry wondered frantically who Malfoy meant.
"This particular one is to our mothers' maternal line," Draco answered. "If the woman has any children at all, she always has three daughters -- the oldest dark, the youngest fair, the middle one in-between."
both of your parents were magical. You're a
Harry recalled the Potential Harassment by Department form he had been working on that morning. "Yeah, but I think I can't finish it -- my objectivity is shot. Would you review the folder and add your observations?"
"Come through," he commanded, stepping back. Draco, who had been reaching for the flasks, stepped back also.
"I had to pack!"
“Again, Mr. Potter.”  He was swallowing something comfortingly vile. He had done this before. Bit by bit, he became aware of the people around him. Hermione, Draco, Ron, and others further back.
"Do I look like a man?"
"Yeah," Creevy agreed cheerfully. "So ... what do we do back?"
"Didn't think I was," Harry confessed.
"Harry." Her voice wavered, but didn't ring with the fury she was entitled to. "You know, defiance isn't always the best way to manage your conflicts with people."
"Yes, but it's Ron," Harry explained. "Doing our divination, I mean. And since Scabbers was his rat -- well, sometimes things with us end up in there too."
all of that. The question is still -- do I go? Draco, do you
"Mm," Malfoy said. Harry froze. The position had brought his erection against Malfoy's arse. He thought he should be jerking back, but it felt too good. Then Malfoy rocked his hips back and forth, and it felt better. Harry ground down, pressing his clothed shaft into Malfoy's crack.
"I did!" Draco countered, grinning. "But you're right -- an external threat is different. This wasn't one, though. It was a player appearing to lose control."
"I have it," Draco said. "I think we do need some minor truth magic, now that it's been explicitly pointed out that lying is possible, but in counter to that, we also need a secrecy charm."
"Mr. Potter was assisting me in gathering raw materials," Snape said. "An educational expedition to potentially boost his Potions marks."
"Good, good," Dumbledore said cheerily. "Poppy, if you might leave us for a short while?"
"And fifth years... it makes sense, sort of, but I like that we can be racy," Sophia said.
"What -- who?"
"We did. But when we came out of the tunnel, Remus turned into a werewolf, and he tried to attack us, because he had missed his medicine, and while Sirius was drawing him off, the rat escaped."
"Oh, my! You have not been oversold, have you?"
Parvati's breath caught. "I'm
"Oh, he and I agreed we'd talk later," Harry explained hastily. "And Mill's probably still with Hagrid."
"No. You lied to me and tried to drug me with potentially harmful substances rather than asking for an explanation."
she answered simply. Her scarlet tongue flickered out.
"Just in case." He held to the cup carefully to the side while they leaned together. Harry's lips were soft, and his cheek slightly rough. His tongue played along Draco's, promising more. When they parted, they were breathless.
Ron bit his lip for a moment, and then sighed. "All right. I promise."
"Hermione doesn't. It's too bad." Ron sighed.  "I can't explain what she's missing, because she doesn't." He looked down at the empty bowl and ran a finger along it in the crossing loops of a figure eight.
"Draco has been a bit under the weather, but he will be fine. He eventually found urination painful enough to consult Madam Pomfrey."
"Nice to know it's mutual," Draco said cheerily. "You wouldn't believe how I've missed you! I've been protected into utter boredom at Hogwarts --"
Smiling, Harry moved out of the flow of students, waiting for Ron and Hermione to join him.
Harry shrugged, but relaxed enough to sit down. "Even if that's true, I don't believe you're surprised."
She reached over to lay a hand on his knee. "Ron told me enough about what he said that I think I understand why you're angry."
The soft voice was close, and familiar. Only two outsiders could get into Harry's house without his explicit consent. Without opening his eyes, he reached to the side and settled his hand in bushy hair. "Mm?"
When they were safely out of trafficked areas, he stopped. "All right," he said, "I want to take you somewhere to talk. It's a secret, though; you need to promise you won't tell."
Carefully, he slid his wand in above her, as far as he safely could, and then cast a mild, focused Lumos. Her tail-tip flicked.
"You are my student and my spellson. I am well aware that I mean nothing to you. You are not the one who chooses to be here, as you have repeatedly made clear. That does not change this."
"Slowly."
Clarke's eyebrows rose. "And yet you managed to get mixed-house social space available at Hogwarts for the first time in three centuries?"
"Hi," Harry said. "Are you speaking to me yet?"
"Still carrying this little bauble, are you?"  Draco said airily. "Shall I keep the snake motif?"
"Narcissa changed it around," Harry said.  "It threw Draco, too. But apparently the white and gold was Lucius Malfoy's choice, not hers."
Don't give him a title."
"Friend, enemy, or just fit?"
"That's what she said. But Barty Crouch Jr. kidnapped me at the end of fourth year, and Wormtail -- Peter Pettigrew -- made Voldemort a new body from my blood and some other disgusting things."
"Yeah," Harry agreed.  "He seems like a real person."
Harry sunk back. "Twisted my ankle."
Snape shot him an amiably contemptuous glance. "You are not a Slytherin, so I have no reason to care.  Furthermore, you are a Gryffindor, so I doubt I am distracting from anything but creative procrastination."
Ron rolled his eyes.  "Sorry. Hermione, will you come home for Christmas with me?"
“Yes.”
"All right," Harry said. "Who would be
"Ginny Weasley," she answered, and he looked unreasonably shocked. "Well, in the current situation it's sort of on hiatus...."
"Hi."
"Want me to get dressed and come out and show you?" he offered, even while he stroked down the firm curve of one cheek.  Draco demonstrated his enjoyment by rocking against the mattress, and Harry found himself up on his knees over him, Draco's moving arse in a two-hand hold.  He squeezed the cheeks together and then let them part, stroking his thumbs down between them. Draco writhed under his thighs.
"But you had him until you were fifteen." Harry lifted his hands in apology. "It's not fair of me. It was horrible for you. I
He choked down an indignant denial. Wasn't that what he had been saying? Hadn't he spent the last three months trying to connect to people who didn't agree with him? But going to Snape had been half defiance, just the same.
Harry didn't think he would have stood for that himself, but perhaps Draco would. He seemed to be wavering. Behind him, the fire flared.
"You're volunteering to risk Filch?"
, but they're
She grinned. "No big reason. Don't read too much into it,
"It wasn't Snape, was it?"
Millicent grimaced. "I hate pictures."
"More than you can imagine."
," he whispered fiercely. "
" Harry managed to pull himself back down from a shout at the thought that they were in a public place. He didn't want to look around to see who was staring.  Auror Tonks, certainly. "I have Remus Lupin," he said fiercely, wishing he could say who else he had. "But even if I didn't, I'm
It clearly wasn't a real detention, once the door had shut behind him. Snape rose from his chair, but rather than looming, came around his desk and leaned back against it. He still crossed his arms over his chest, bringing his robes tight around his tall frame, but there was curiosity behind his sneer. "Well, Potter?" he asked dryly. "What do you want?"
Ginny snorted. "Not if the Ministry is hiding it."
She frowned. "Is there a reason you didn't want to stop and say hello?"
Draco walked about incinerating bits of paper, and Harry collected empty bottles -- one cognac, a large number of butterbeer, and to his surprise, one of orange fizz.
The last bit didn't seem to take this Harry by surprise. He nodded. "How did your Sirius die?"
"You're not being sick!"
After two dances, Linnet laughed that they would cause gossip if they shared a third so soon, and Harry found himself looking for another partner. Now that he was thinking of it, he could see how certain girls passed near him and lingered, swaying slightly while they smiled on the dancers, and it took little more than a cough to turn their eyes to him. Draco left the room with a girl and her parents, and Harry ignored it with a foxtrot.  He couldn't do all the flourishes of the people around him, but he didn't step on the girl's feet, and she looked happy when he finished. After bows and thank yous, he looked around for something to quench his thirst.
"I apologize," he said stiffly.
"What do you mean by
"I... That feels too weird to even think about. And rough on the kids, don't you think?"
Harry had to puzzle that out for a moment -- the passage to Honeydukes. "Good idea," he answered.
"Good luck with that," Ron said. "Though yeah. She might listen to you."
"Why not?"
"It's not fair. I didn't even do anything; I just wasn't angry at you enough for him. And what is the point of that? Not talking to someone doesn't help anything."
"So you stopped listening and saved the cat," Ginny guessed.
"Oh!" she exclaimed in dismay. "You have your clothes on!"
"Hm. Perhaps we should ask her advice on projects.  It might kill two birds with one stone. "
"Do you want me?"
"No." Harry bit his lip. "Do we often?"
Ron's eyes narrowed without changing focus. "Because I
It was slipped in quite casually. Harry smirked. "Let's just say I'm making progress on that project we discussed."
"Do not trust the safety of your father's house."

"Maybe this would work better with you behind your desk."
Harry dug his fingers into his arm. The use of force, and the pain from it, was enough to keep him from shouting at them to shut up. They needed to have this fight. He had
Or maybe not. He scanned through the comments, but didn't see any place where it was actively withdrawn. Now, at least, that would get a large stamp at the bottom of the last page and another across the front.
Harry raked a hand through his hair, trying to imagine returning to Draco when he was in his late twenties. "I just don't see -- I couldn't promise that."
"Thank you," Harry answered, grinning with relief.  "Are we okay, then?"
He led Draco into the living room, and Draco gave a little sigh of relief when he crossed onto the first carpet. Harry made a note to himself to check Draco's knees when they were done with this.
Snape's testimony went on until the lunchtime recess, when Tonks once again escorted them -- or Draco, really, Harry reminded himself -- from the courtroom. Before they made it through the doors, a spectator -- not in somber Wizengamot garb, but in elegant robes of soft cream that were both feminine and modest in cut -- moved down the seats to intercept them.
Draco stepped forward. "My father had a Pensieve."
"What, Hogwarts?" Harry asked, startled.
He didn't really agree, but if he refused, he was sure she would think he was afraid. "Okay," he said, and, her arm still curled under his, she guided him from the dance floor.  The music softened to a pleasant background level as they stepped off the polished wood.
“You’ll have very little time at the rate she will bleed.”
"Point," Ron contributed cheerfully. "It could be one of my brothers."
"For one night! And I'm not a prefect."
"That would need to be with Dean, not instead," Seamus objected. "Otherwise, you're taking another friend of his away."
"I didn't
"You want someone who doesn't care about anything?"
"Yes." Draco drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair. Harry was just close enough to hear the muted strike of fingertips against taut upholstery. "Points against?"
"We wanted to do that anyway."
Sammy shook his head. "Not that I know of," Sammy said. "When I did accidental magic, my parents thought I was lying."
They flooed away, and Madame Pomfrey began her own examination. It was at least ten minutes later that Harry finally got to set out in search of Draco.
"Potter." The name puffed against his ear.  "Harry." Unexpected and softer. "I know how we can do it."
“No, we can go back,” Harry said. “It is cold.”
"Very well. I agree, if I don't object to the message. What is it?"
“Is this seat free, Susan?” Justin had stopped on the other side of her. His look was piercing, and Harry thought he and Susan might have seemed unusually intimate, in that moment. He leaned back.
better, really."
he asked.
"What?" The panic returned, churning in his stomach. "Was it someone I knew?"
Without preliminaries, he dropped to his knees and rubbed his face against Harry's bare cock, streaking his cheek with glistening liquid.
"Gryffindor," Harry said hotly. "I'm a Gryffindor."
Harry hadn't thought about that before. "I'd imagine some," he said. "A lot, if he goes looking for you, or for a Malfoy. You'd all turn me over to
At the reminder that he could be seen, Draco's stance changed entirely, his back straightening as his head came up. He lifted a hand like a pointer's paw, and he stepped out after Harry.
They ended up going to dinner together, with Ron and Hermione joining them. It had felt odd, having something hanging around his wrist, but Harry wasn't sure that anyone else noticed the beads under his cuffs. It wasn't until dessert, when he reached for a tart, that Hermione commented.
will still need to deal with McGonagall, and with anxious Gryffindor prefects."
"The salad tongs," Harry said, and Draco laughed. With some irritation, Harry realized that he had lost the element of mystery. "You know," he declared, "I'm not interested in experimenting today."  He undid his belt, knowing that Draco would recognize the clack of the buckle and the soft shushing of the leather being pulled through his belt loops. Draco moaned.
“Susan might be right about a hand,” Justin said. “A wand, even.”
"Pardon?"
"Tell me what you're thinking of," he whispered, as if they weren't surrounded by his housemates, and Harry had a sudden feeling of dark weight, as if a storm had settled over them. His answer, he knew, would be terribly important.
Myrtle giggled. "Well...." she said suggestively, and Harry tried not to shudder. "Harry!" she said sweetly. "You know I hear
“Across houses. Non-Ravenclaws are for hiring to do tedious or dangerous things.”
"Testing me?" Harry still wasn't sure of Draco's mother.
"I saw Hermione in the corridor," Ginny challenged.

"Well, they are an excellent thickener, and not at all toxic, if properly kept."
"We'll call you. Stay put."
he hissed, as quietly as possible.
"As far as you know."
"That he doesn't know my abilities as well as he thinks he does." Harry looked over at Hermione. She was curled sulkily back from her notes, quill tapping on her robes. The black would hide any dots of ink. "What do you think, Hermione?" he asked.
"It does not suit your complexion, sir," Gilbert said, flicking the hair to one side. Cheefi froze, and for a moment, Harry thought he had objected to the touch. Then they heard a warning knock at the door -- not the dungeon door, as Harry had expected, but the one to the second floor. Harry wondered if Draco was keeping the dungeon entrance a secret.
"Oh." Harry glanced at Linnet, who had the grace to look abashed. He supposed that explained the woman who had defended her, as well.
"How's it cast?" Seymour asked. Harry got to see Draco's hand snap out, Seeker-fast, and cover his mouth.
Snape's expression did not soften, but he inclined his head a fraction. "Why does this suddenly concern you?" he demanded. "Explain.  Did you know Auror Peggleton?"
Snape's eyebrows rose. "He was not destroyed in his attack on you and your parents?"
against her parents' wishes--"
"Harry, what on earth are you talking about?"
“It’s gone – I lifted it from the Muggle aunt, and Madam Pomfrey pulled out the contaminants from the potion that had been applied to her. The issue now is from the muscles having cramped so abruptly and from tensing repeatedly against the pain. The best cure is moderate walking, stopping now and then to stretch.” He nodded at Harry. “Your body is confused now. You need to show it that the pain is gone, and that those muscles can relax.”
"Good. We should be able to reach Slytherin before them.  Discussion that they should be exposed to can be in front of them without appearing planned; after that, we'll go to my room."
"Very well. Be it on your head, then."
Draco laughed.
"Eh. It makes more sense the longer I think about it. The turd left his mother, you said?"
"Not to mention a nuisance. It takes half an hour to get there."
With a long, dark sigh, Harry settled back against a table. "He could just

"Yeah, but he's a
Harry bit his lip hard.
"Think about it!" Harry insisted, looking between them. "There are two sides to a conflict that you haven't made up your mind about. One side talks to you, and the other one doesn't. Which way will you drift?"
That was a horrifying idea, Harry thought, recalling the swell of his blood.
Dobby's grin stretched to his ears, which twitched as if he was laughing too. "Dobby will be happy to take Harry Potter to Potions.  Dobby will not even tell House Master Albus Dumbledore. Harry Potter must go up stairs on his own, though!"
.  "Another kind."
"We just wanted to talk to you."
"Oh, right! Well, that part worked, but not the way we had hoped. It sent me on, but...."
impartial when it comes to the Dark Lord."
“They’re fine.”
in a heartbeat."
"I know." He gestured at the comfy sofa.  "Let's sit down."
Draco laughed nervously.  "Oh, of course."
"You wouldn't get away with that without a crisis. Entering, I mean, not the Quiris."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Try harder."
Justin barked out a laugh, quickly covering his mouth and looking apologetic. Draco, quite unexpectedly, sent him a wry smile.
"Eugene, listen! I'm
"I can apparate."
Harry took a breath. "His father used it. Often. For bribery. That's why he knew it's more effective if the subject wants to believe you."
if you bound me -- to put me in your father's position for balance, you understand -- except I'll never be able to take that.
"You haven't?" Frieda challenged.
"I've only done this once," Draco said. "And that was a while ago. I haven't even been playing with myself, you know, between sanitation concerns and lack of privacy....."
Malfoy let out a harsh breath. "Fuck, Potter, how would I know?"
"Where have you been?"
"The game. They lost both Seekers, both Contrivances, and both captains. Do you think they've called a break until we're back?"
Malfoy gave a ragged laugh. "And you're just obliging, Potter? How considerate of you."
, for one thing. I think she heard that he had 'said' something to me, but not that it was in a letter."
"I'd be delighted."
"Actually, I think it meets our criteria for fairness," Sophia opined. "It clearly
"Well?" she insisted.
Draco nodded. "You have that, I believe. I'm not sure she'd take a curse for you, but she'd certainly be willing to throw them.  She defends you in Slytherin to the very limit of sense." He sighed. "That is part of why she reacted badly to you saying you had helped her in front of the team."
"He's different?"
"Alcohol dissolves the protective coating around the doxy eggs."
(delicately!) with how rare such a skill is, and how impressed you
even as dangerous as he is, and I'm probably more dangerous than you are."
Draco smiled in relief.
"Good catch, though," Harry said, sitting in the narrow space left.
Remus cleared his throat.  "You sound quite protective."
For a moment, Dumbledore was silent. When he spoke, his voice was querulous, as if he were puzzling over the matter. "You have never expressed any affection for your mother's relatives."
didn't even find out until ... less than a year ago. I figured out that some people who ought to have sense thought I was the one who would defeat him, and I confronted Dumbledore, who explained why, and I got more from Remus and Sirius later." He paused.
"I don't see that she's changed any! She's a Beater!"
" The spell was a dueling standard and came easily to Harry's tongue. The ropes fell from Draco. As they did, however, something else came from above, landing heavily behind Harry. He whipped around and found himself facing someone masked and cloaked as a Death Eater.
Fred, who had just taken a sip, coughed.
"Because you don't trust me."
He woke next to a hand stroking his hair. Draco. He turned into the touch.
Harry eyed him uneasily. "Yes?"
"I don't have any! I just don't want to be the cause of any more deaths, even if they aren't really my fault. And you probably would have had me go to the Burrow next, and then the Weasleys wouldn't have been safe."
"The problem is...."  Seamus said. He stopped. "I mean, the problem is
"We can't stay?"
"Just manners," he lied, aware of other housemates looking on. "She has to invite me, but I'm not expected to accept or anything."
Harry muffled the end of the request with his mouth, and that quick tongue switched to greeting his own. Against his chest, Draco's body relaxed, and Harry leaned back. Soon they were stretched out on the couch, Draco lying half on top of him, canted just enough to the side for Harry to fumble at his buttons with some hope of success. He was derailed by a warm hand suddenly gripping his cock through his jeans.
"Harry," Draco said, from beside him. Harry hadn't seen him approach, but Draco got the

"And I could refuse if I wanted to."
"Harry," Hermione said warningly.
Parvati giggled. "I expect it was beautiful, though."
"Great," Ron said. "We'll send
Fanciful".
Innocently, Harry nodded.
Draco couldn't have said that the aphrodisiac had worn off, but now that both of them had climaxed, the effect seemed to have mellowed to a need to
"Mr. Harry Potter, sir!" he said delightedly. "You is wanting Dobby?"
His warning was too late.  She'd hurled the rock neatly into the rubble, where it hit with a thunderous crash, knocking loose several other stones which rumbled down to the floor.
"-- but he handled it badly."
The stag's hooves, unlike the horse's, clattered against the floor, but the window stayed whole as he leapt through it and vanished into the night.
"But first
"Besides," Harry said with a grin, "I'm pretty sure my Firebolt was from him, and that hasn't killed me either, right?"
"I'm not sure tha--"
"Fred and George!  I'm telling them I'm starting a dueling club!"
"Not exactly." Harry looked around at their housemates. Dean and Seamus were animatedly arguing about the value of Muggle sport, while Parvati rolled her eyes. Neville was trying to look interested in that, but Harry suspected that he had heard Hermione's question. Any mention of Snape tended to get Neville's attention. He nudged Hermione under the table. "I'll tell you later. Where's Ron?"
Green and black swirled around them and drained away, leaving the bright colors of the headmaster's office.
"Absolutely no sooner than next weekend," Hermione said. Draco looked at Harry, who shrugged. He certainly wouldn't know if Draco didn't.
is good too. Dobby is very fortunate House Elf to have both freedom and someone to help."
know what Horcruxes were -- not that it helped
Harry went alone to the mixed-house space. Gilbert was there, at least, sitting with Gloria, and he beckoned for Harry to join them.
"Dare?" Harry repeated incredulously, but Draco, Millicent, and Blaise were sniggering, as were several people he didn't know.
Ron's eyebrows scrunched down. "And you had a worse one? Mate, doesn't that strike you as a bit suspicious?"
"Stand down!" he commanded imperiously. Nothing changed.
"Dark blue, as I recall."
"Now, wait a minute!" Draco said over his shoulder.
Harry smiled. He could feel that it looked a little hesitant. Zabini was a real person to him -- more than Bulstrode had been when she had run into him -- and he felt shyer with him. "I want a parley. Meet me in five minutes, in the alley behind Flourish & Blotts?"
out of school, are we not?"
"Not Draco first?"
"I was advised to find someone who knew me well," Harry said. "And he came out with a couple of unexpectedly accurate things during carelessly done Divination assignments, last year."
He wasn't expecting Malfoy's hollow laugh. "What?" he demanded.
"I see," Draco said coolly. "Do I have extra duties to stay out of prison?"
"No -- good, really."
She was a very good dancer.  Harry concentrated on that and hoped she didn't find him too boring. He only knew how to lead a few moves. However, he certainly knew enough not to step on her feet, and he could recognize the slow crescendo that meant music drawing to a close. He took that cue to turn her again and again, like a toy ballerina, so she was laughing when it ended and nearly fell against him.
"You look quite presentable. I would applaud your taste, but I suspect it was actually my spellson's."
"Good."
"Because he
"Hush. That was tea. And it was only once."
"Lie down, Harry," Malfoy said softly. Even through his enhanced lust, Harry was surprised to hear his name.
"He has the name, but--"
"A few hours before you found me hurling in the loo."
blood, and since the target is Theodore's uncle, you cannot restrict it too closely. What if this 'bad luck' caused his young cousin -- she is five years old, I believe -- to fall out of a tree and break her neck?"
"You've said no, right?" Ron pleaded.
"I'd think he'd send Thornton, since it might be dangerous."
"Just ...." Ginny bit her lip. "You don't generally care who likes you, Harry -- at least that I've been able to tell.  And this year, you seemed to want people you wouldn't usually
smoke." He looked off into the distance, his expression somber. "I don't suppose..." He shot her a quick, guilty look. "Um, that Ron stayed in this one?"
"Now, Harry," Remus chided. "I don't like him -- and I'm not convinced that you should trust him -- but there's no need to be offensive."
me," he said. Some lower-year Slytherins were approaching, which reminded him of Draco's analysis of how their houses determined who was in charge. "
"He didn't say no when his turn started either," Blaise objected.
"Go home, Snuffles," Remus said firmly.  "Now. Quickly."
"Too bad we need to wait for spring," Ron said.
"Yes," Snape said, with a sharp nod. He opened a drawer in the nearby table and dropped the marble into it, just as a House Elf appeared with a tea service. The elf looked at the parchment-strewn surfaces around it, and then at its tray. Moving the tray to one hand, he snapped his fingers, summoning a table just large enough for the tray and a few well-positioned saucers. With a bow and a squeaked 'your tea, sirs!" he vanished, leaving the tea service behind.
“Please go inside,” Harry said. “We’ll meet you tonight; just send word.”
Although rolling her eyes, she smiled. "How very like you." She hesitated. "I should be researching."
from the tree that had sent Harry away, not what was left.
"Oh." Harry and Draco looked at each other. "Well," Harry said, accepting a warm butterbeer from Rosmerta, "diligent, for one."
"Thankfully, yes. Just one of the many reasons that I love you."
"Millicent?"
Narcissa turned her head coyly. "Yet you are sitting there."
"I don't want to repeat myself," Harry said grimly.
Harry was going to take that one to Hermione. This had happened before? And she hadn't quoted
"Hi," he said.
"Remember Professor Lupin?"
"Tell you what?"
"Harry!" Draco yelped, but his mother merely chuckled.
Harry grimaced. "Damn."
agreeable." Draco frowned. "If we're going to discuss this, might we get out of bed?"
"But you won't recuse yourself."
with me when I was wearing my Invisibility Cloak. No, I stayed with the twins."
I thought it was just a polite goodbye." Harry shrugged. "She's not much for talking."
tell?" Ron said, sounding relieved. "That will make Mum feel better."
Harry nodded guiltily. Casting around for something else to think about, he saw the edge of a large envelope protruding from Draco's bag.
"As you like."
It took Harry a moment to place the word 'cat'.
"Sirius Black? Because he was your godfather?"
"All right."
"Three Slytherins. So Padma's the only one who can feel outnumbered."
Ron stepped back a pace, arms protectively around his daughter. Harry met his eyes and smiled.
"Oh!" Harry blushed. He had a brief impulse to protest that he was bi, but if thinking he was gay would stop Myrtle from throwing herself at him, he could live with it. "I don't think I've ever heard, um, that one. Maybe Muggles don't use it now."
Harry sighed. "Draco, I'm a Gryffindor. I wouldn't come up with some insanely elaborate excuse to ask you to bed."
so the more supplies that I can get in advance, the better.
, Harry reflected, was Ron's word of the evening.
Trying to pretend he didn't notice Seamus's intent study, Harry focused on Ron and shrugged. "Well, you know. Like Neville, I think I may need it."
"Very well. How long does that usually take?"
"And if I don't?" Severus snapped. The acid bite of his question suffered from a catch in his breath as the plug slid further in, stretching him wider.
"The load-bearing capacity of jelly?"
With a discouragingly compassionate look, Dumbledore met his eyes. "I know how much you wish it, Harry, but it is unlikely."
"Intended to make me set off the next one, as I nearly did," Draco snapped, as the vines about him dissolved. He stood, rubbing his arms. "Yes, understood."
"So, we don't actually know if I know this, because casting it at the wall doesn't do anything." Harry was sure of that. He didn't feel any different.
"You didn't play Parcheesi?"
"Probably more Harry than a defect in the charm," Draco said to Blaise. "Luna, did you answer for two beads?"
"Shh." She was holding both his hands now, so he leaned in and kissed her forehead.
Harry didn't consider himself paranoid, exactly -- more alert to his surroundings. While packing up his Potions equipment after the first lesson of the term, he saw someone moving unnecessarily close to the table he had shared with Draco, and he directed enough attention towards that motion to see Pansy drop something flat in his bag. A note, he assumed. When Hermione approached, he paid less attention.
schedule, now?"
"And for me?"
They cast dusting spells on every section of the entry and meeting space, and sent the dust deep into the piled rocks that filled the passageway beyond. Afterwards, Harry tried conjured water and a scrubbing spell on an area of the wall.
“Firstly, I am Alpha, and the leader of this pack. You will call me Skotadi – Darkness. I am giving you one warning and one warning only – My Pack is my family. Harm or threaten one of them and I will kill you, easy as that. I am godson to Nona,” Narcissa stood tall on the Dias. “Nonos,” Severus moved to stand beside her. “Anadochos,” Lucius stepped forward and nodded once. “And Lykos,” Remus moved from the shadows behind the Dark Lord’s chair to the gasps of the Death Eaters.
Tobias walked to his bed and sorted out what he needed for a day’s work. On his way to the door, he placed a gentle kiss to Draco’s temple. “You will, Drakontas – just not before I remove any and all dangers and make it worthy of a human’s presence. We don’t want for you to have to walk on rat skeletons now, do we?”
Tobias blushed. “I forgot that you would be able to understand me,” he admitted.
Severus paled drastically. “What time?”
Punishments and embarrassment abounds
“I said it still smells of my Drakontas.”
Tobias smiled at Draco with no mask covering his emotions. Draco felt his breath leave him at the love and devotion he saw in his husband’s eyes. The sound off a throat being cleared tore his eyes from the wonderful being before him.
A man that he didn’t know approached him. “I believe that is a question to ask the Headmaster, since it is his job to report those matters.”
“What most people here in Hogwarts don’t know is that A-Aunt Bellatrix isn’t scared of Tobias – She’s terrified of him. For two weeks Tobias used her as a guinea pig to test out all his favourite curses on – not including the amount of crucio’s he sent at her just for fun. When the Dark Lord told him to stop before he killed her prematurely, Tobias locked her in an empty room with no light and, using a projection spell, forced her to endure a week of non-stop Bambi. It just played over and over and over without stopping. Mother was sent to retrieve her at the end of the week. She was pale and jittery. When she saw the Dark Lord, she bowed to him, shaking slightly. When she saw Bi, she flinched back, curled up in a ball shaking whimpering, ‘please, no more. I’ll be good, I promise’.”
Voldemort laughed loudly. “Of course, Gios. I guess that means that it will be none of the Weasley children then?” Tobias shuddered as his father laughed; delighted with the joke he’d just played on his son.
Draco bounced in his seat, laughing uncontrollably.
Both girls’ heads shot up and Draco quickly sent a few charms at Luna to remove the evidence of her tears.
“Now that you are my son, we need to start looking for a partner for you. After we find one suitable for you, we will need to start with the negotiations for a betrothal contract. I’m sorry son, but … are you more inclined towards males or females?”
Minerva sobbed softly, fighting back her tears. “When I asked what the bands looked like, she described them for me.” She lost the fight to keep the tears inside, but she kept talking. “They put Hell-Pit Bands on him.”
“Don’t worry about it, Ray. I can always buy another one.”
“Dobby,” Tobias muttered quietly as their waiter walked away after placing their plates down,” remind me to ask Miss Perks to tea in the next few days for a proper chat.”
Lucius nodded and clicked his fingers.
Minerva and Filius exchanged amused looks, the same thought going through their minds.
The class was dumbfounded at the smooth, rich sound of their Professor’s laugh. When the irritated peacock started to stamp a foot on the ground in a demanding manner, he laughed harder.
A meeting of twins and Draco gets revenge even though Luna knows she could do better
Sev nodded and went back to his thoughts.
“Thank you, and it’s Mr Malfoy-Jones, not Potter.” Tobias stood and made his way to where his husband was to watch the rest of the proceedings.
“We thought you knew,” Neville replied from his seat on the ground where a plant had entangled him in its stems. “We got a message via Thanatos and came straight here. Draco got flamed here before we found out.”
“How are you feeling today? I know you occasionally get bad morning sickness and I thought I’d ask,” she explained seeing their quizzical looks. “My older sister is pregnant with her third and she’s going through the same thing. She said that if you had any questions about the pregnancy experience that you didn’t feel you could ask anyone around you, then you can ask her. You don’t have to but she wanted to offer anyway.”
Looking at the time, the happy family left the hall and headed to the Dungeons, leaving a still shocked hall behind them.
“Of course I can do that Neogennito.”
“It sounded like he was really trying to tear strips out of your hide Lucius,” Remus stated, looking shaken.
“Don’t you dare take that tone of voice with us Harry!” For being the smartest witch in the year, Hermione didn’t notice the winces that appeared on Ginny, the twins and Bill’s faces, nor the look of pure contempt on Tobias’. “What could you possibly have to talk to Ginny, Fred, George, Charlie or Bill about? There is nothing you could want to talk about without us in here with you.”
Tobias bowed to him from his seat. “Thank you for your kind words, Ruen. May I enquire about the drink we have tonight? It has the most exquisite taste.”
“And when you are in need of a break from them, I was kind of hoping you would teach me to cook something so I could surprise Narcissa on Valentine’s Day.”
Tobias has some fun before the day even starts.
Ronald jolted awake, panic bubbling up his throat from his chest. Shaking, he ran his hand over his forearm, searching for the wound he knew was there. When he found none, he tried to look and feel his back, knowing that it was going to prove that he wasn’t slowly going insane. Once again there was nothing wrong.
Tobias looked at the questioner and raised an eyebrow in question, wanting to get this over with.
Harry awoke the next morning to the tapping of an owl at his window.  Stretching as he went to open it, he was surprised to see several owls waiting for him.  After he removed the letters, all the owls flew off. He looked at his watch and walked down to the kitchen for a glass of pumpkin juice and a bowl of something that looked expensive.
“You can’t expect anything to go to plan when we are involved.”
“What would I do though?” Tobias asked. “I like doing my assignments with The Pack, same with homework. I have no books I’m willing to read because they’re all boring and Pateras won’t send me any more due to him not wanting  me to over work,” Tobias pouted while Draco drew him into his side, chuckling softly.
Draco sent him a cocky smirk as he sauntered over to their bed for the night and sat down in a relaxed position, wondering at what was going to occur.
“Mr Black – or should I say Master Riddle? A pleasure to see you once again.” Mrs Longbottom turned to her grandson. “Neville, are you well?”
Severus stretched with a half-smile as the area behind his ear gave a small throb, reminding him of what had occurred earlier that day. He frowned, however, when he hand encountered nothing beside him. Sitting up, he blinked at the sight of the parchment on Remus’ pillow. Hesitantly, he opened it to reveal a short note that had him shaking his head with a smile on his face.
Tobias opened his eyes with a smirk only those beside him could see. “Showtime,” he muttered just as one of the other patrons of the café they were at ran back into the shop yelling about Death Eaters.
“But don’t worry,” Luna continued, pulling a lollypop out of her mouth, “once you tell him what is happening, he will find security.”
Chapter 11
Pansy Parkinson – Arketa [Pretty] – Draco’s Second
Severus looked up suddenly, making Amelia jolt slightly in her seat. He smiled genuinely, eyes misted with remembrance.
More than half of the students were exceedingly happy that the black-haired teen had been asleep when the twins revealed what the vile woman had planned on doing and those who weren’t were entertaining themselves with imagining what the pregnant teen would have done to her.
Two hours later, a pair of soft lips brushing against his woke Draco up. Smirking internally, Draco pretended to still be asleep, wanting to see what happened. The shy lips touched his once more and Draco heard a soft whimper come from Tobias’ throat. Waiting for Tobias’ lips to touch his once more, Draco pounced, grinning at the small squeak that escaped Tobias’ lips, before cutting it off with a gentle – but insistent – kiss.
Before he fell back into sleep, Tobias looked over at the still form of his former friend and grinned. Life was GOOD!
He growled in annoyance as Dobby – the fanatical house elf that would never do anything to harm the dark-haired teen appeared with the young man’s food and potions. There went his plan of ordering the House-elf that prepared the annoyance’s food to lace it with something. He really regretted allowing that creature to remain free when he started working at the school. Who could have known that the annoying creature would survive what was normally a death’s sentence to a normal house-elf? He sighed. What plans had he left?
“Sorry,” they mumbled before separating.
“What makes you think the seventh years won’t give us much trouble?” Xing Wu asked suspiciously.
During this part of the meal, the two of them spoke of their pasts – family life, previous partners and if they slept with them. Draco had been surprised to discover that he was Tobias’ first relationship and if it hadn’t have been for his Uncle he would be pure. Discovering this, Draco hurried to reassure his intended.
“Wood and clay will wash away,
Hermione froze, finding it hard to breath.
He smirked when the other members appeared, only to be attacked by a hyperactive raven-haired teen with glowing green-silver eyes.
The man’s shoulders tensed up.
“I will never doubt Luna again,” Neville murmured as he gathered his own toiletries for his own shower. “At least, not in this area.”
Tobias woke early the next day wrapped in his husband’s arms. He turned and nuzzled into the porcelain chest, licking the skin and moaning softly in delight at the slightly sweet-salty taste.
The Slytherins all shook off their shock. “Really, Potter? Want some eggs?” Vincent Crabbe thrust a plate of runny scrambled eggs under Harry’s nose. No one had ever seen anyone change colour from red to green so fast. Harry ran from the Hall, hands covering his mouth.
I should also probably mention that I don't own anything that is recognisable and as for the rest ... well ... it is under a thing called 'imagination' I love fooling with things that I shouldn't (can you tell I'm a little bit of a fire bug? hehe)
Lucius lost his control and laughed along with Tom.
“Okay Neogennito,” Severus soothed. “You just keep a hold of Kyria and I’ll be back soon.”
“Of course it doesn’t!” Tom exclaimed, shocking Tobias into looking up at him. “I refuse to hold you prisoner in your own house because of that old bastard!”
“You say ‘the Light’ like you aren’t in it, Minerva,” Amelia stated. “Is there something you would like to tell us?”
“Are you sure this is what you want?” Draco asked. “Think of what it means. You will never be able to marry or bond to anyone or anything else ever. You will be able to father children, if you so wish, but they will either stay with the mother or belong to The Pack. You will never be able to become the Lord you are meant to become.”
Hermione paled. “M-Master?”
Severus smiled as Tobias made his way to Narcissa, bowed and kissed her hand before kneeling and hiding his face on her lap as she gently ran fingers through his hair.
The elf squeaked in answer and left as quickly as it could, much to Tobias’ amusement.
“Sh’up,” Tobias murmured. “Yer fawlt.”
“The followers you no longer want nor need,” Tobias replied, “And a bit of your hair,” Seeing the looks being sent his way, he sighed and told the two men his plan and was rewarded by two astounded faces.
“What is it?” Neville asked as he stepped to the front, followed by Pansy
Tobias curled around his stomach, gasping in an attempt to stop the pain while still listening closely to the old man’s footsteps as he got closer.
Chapter 53
Tobias glared at Tom then Sev. “I don’t see that it is any of your business.”
“Pateras,” he bowed. Tom pulled him into a hug.
Severus nodded. “So that’s what has had you acting the way you have been today. You’ve realised …” He stopped at Draco’s shaking head. “Then why?”
He moved to before Draco’s head and sat in the chair, watching his facial expressions as the potions mixed, mingled and were absorbed. After twenty minutes, Harry removed the gag from Draco’s mouth, allowing him to gulp much needed air. He stood and positioned his cock in front of Draco’s mouth.
“I know, I know,” Draco sighed tiredly. “I look like shit, you can say it,” he chuckled dryly.
He grinned as the door opened and all noise disappeared instantly. The class silently entered the room while Severus glared at them. “Notes are on the board. They should keep you out of trouble until I get back.” He closed the door and stood beside his godson.
“I’m very happy to say that both babe and carrier are doing just fine. I do however, wish for you to rest a bit more. I said rest,” Algernon continued when Tobias opened his mouth to protest, “not sleep. You can spend all day going through whatever you do during the day, but you must rest. No sitting on the benches in the Great Hall and in the classrooms. You also need to invest in a chair you can lay down in for your study. That way, you can have naps and work in the same place.”
Thank you everyone for reading :3
Smoke all night, smoke all night.
Amelia smiled widely. “Thank you for explaining it to me, Severus. I have only one more thing to say before you can go. Mr Longbottom wishes for you to read this before you leave the room.” She handed the still sealed letter to the man and looked away politely while he read its content.
With a sharp nod, Draco ran to get Severus, leaving his husband to sleep on the lounge under the eyes of the School’s Founders.
Tobias stretched before freezing. The last thing he remembered was being in a bath with Draco. He was now lying in a bed … alone ….
“I was driven to join the Dark Lord a few months after my sixteenth birthday by three seventh years who eventually became Head Auror, one of the highest non-Political Ministry workers and a Healer specialising in pregnancy care. It didn’t matter that they had almost killed the youngest daughter of an old pure-blood family or that they did kill the unborn heiress of another. Not one of the members of the Dark Army joined for the Hell of it. Not even the Dark Lord himself has no reason for what he became.”
Deloris shrieked again when what Lucius was saying registered in her mind.
“Draco …”
Lucius held up the fang for her to see as if it were a sacrifice to a sacred deity. “This fang fit into its mouth, along with a lot of others,” he explained, fingering the snapped end. “There is about one of my hand’s lengths still embedded in the creature’s skull – and this was the smallest fang the animal had.”
With one last shallow bow, Millicent calmly strode to the curt-mannered man on the other side of the hall.
“Good hunting,” Vincent said as he closed the door behind the two.
Shaking slightly in rage, Severus turned his attention to healing his patient to the best of his ability.  For every mark he healed, there were two he couldn’t. The worst of these, to Severus’ mind, were the multiple cuts to Harry’s lower arms and thighs.  They indicated to him that the treatment he had witnessed in that room had occurred before.  Why hadn’t anyone noticed?
“I have also spoken to the Founders about the wards they had on the school and grounds and what they have told me has me worried when I compare my years in Hogwarts’ halls against what the wards should do. This is the main – but not only – reason I asked to talk to you today. I would like to hire a team of Gringotts ward-masters to come to the school and inspect the wards. They will be given access to my private rooms, where they will be able to consult the Founder’s Portraits about how they should look compared to how they do look. If need be, they will remove all wards and replace them so they are just as good as they were originally, if not better or they will strengthen the wards if that is all they require.”
“Our silent partner,” George stated with a half-smile.
“Will do,” Pansy grinned before following the younger girls from the room.
~End Flashback~
Remus coughed to cover his laughter. He had never known that the evil Dark Lord was a master of understatement.
Two hours later, Voldemort knocked on his son’s bedroom door. Not getting an answer, he opened the door to see Tobias seated cross-legged on the ground in front of a makeshift altar. He sat on the desk chair present to watch as his son was meditating. Just as he was thinking of interrupting him, Tobias burst into flame and slowly opened his eyes.
“No Father,” he turned to the man who spoke his name. “I know that you will see this as me betraying my family and I say go ahead – disown me. I’m not scared of it like I was when I was a child.”
“Tobias – Explain what just happened to me, because I have no idea.”
Severus shook his head ruefully. “I told Minerva that I was keeping you here for the rest of today because you were feeling over whelmed due to not having a decent rest for a person of your condition. Poppy said – albeit reluctantly - that even if you are only in your first month then you should get a decent amount of rest so it makes the later months easier on the carrier as well as the child. I’m going to suggest you have a rest now and join Minerva and myself for a mid-morning snack and you can start again after half an hour.”
With another grin, Draco ordered the house-elf to serve.
“I accept, Severus. I have something I wish to discuss with the Malfoys, yourself and your wolf.”
Minerva nodded and walked out of the room, head held high and her heart lighter than she thought possible.
“I have two of my Pack intending to start going through the rooms of Hogwarts from top to bottom as soon as I give the go ahead. It is vital that no magic is used in the gathering and transporting of the rooms content. That is when I will need the two manual workers: one to aid my Pack members and one to transport the content filled boxes to me from the room the boxes will be stored in.”
Draco walked into the Founder’s Rooms with a very sleepy Tobias beside him.
“MERLIN Alpha! What the Hell happened?”
Luna glided silently through the halls, deep in thought. She had communicated with Kitten – the sentient mind of Hogwarts – and had succeeded in convincing her to allow access to the Room of Requirement through the room in which Ronald Weasley was sleeping. Stepping into the Gryffindor common room, she sent a silent thank you to Kitten who had overridden the need for a password. She smiled slightly as a small movement caught her eye.
Fred and George exchanged identical smirks over the piece of parchment in their hands. On the table between them lay the letter their youngest brother had written. They knew that if their mother received it, then Ginny would be in trouble – if only because she had sided with Tobias rather than Dumbledore.
“Those who have only a few more moments to go until your potions are complete, finish them off, bottle and label them. Those who aren’t add the next ingredient or group of ingredients and someone competent in stasis charms will be around to freeze it for you for Monday night. As you have guessed, you will be back here then to complete the practical lesson. If you have completed it already, you do not need to attend. After this has been done, you are free to leave.”
“Vicious beasts, aren’t they?”
The residents of Hogsmeade smiled as they watched the large group walk through the street. Every now and then a few members of the group would split off and enter a store before re-joining the group and splitting the purchases between them all. As the day progressed, they witnessed them sitting together around a large feast and eating in a comfortable silence many would have argued against teenagers of any age possessing.
“The courting contract is a maximum of three months after being worked out so a maximum of six months before being forced to bond. The swapping has no limit until the youngest member is out of school, then it is three years.”
“At first, I think the findings will be few and far between,” Tobias admitted. “The rooms that will be first are unused rooms in the dungeons before moving through to the top. We do have an advantage though.”
Build it up with wood and clay,
“I’d like one or two one day - Just don’t ask me to baby sit.
“Hey Seamus? What worksheets is she talking about?”
With a snarl of frustration, Harry watched the last of the liquid drip out, leaving his blonde-haired Pet visibly itching and vibrating with pleasure as the small metal balls stated to release the lubricant that was spreading the electric current out from its housing.
“See you in the morning Nonos,” Tobias smiled at the thankful look Severus sent him and the nervous gulps of the two Aurors. He watched them leave with a serious look on his face.
The Pack smirked as the door opened quickly to reveal two blondes, a sandy-haired brunette and a man with red-streaked black hair, a pair of rose-tinted glasses and a muggle suit. Tobias and Draco stood slowly.
Remus tightened his grip around the boy and looked up at Lucius and Narcissa in shock. All three of them turned their heads to look at Severus. Looking back at them tiredly, he responded to their unasked questions.
Over this ensemble was a cloak like no other in the wizarding world. It consisted of a cowl that hid their faces better than any mask could and the cloak itself, which only covered their back and sides. It had one tiny silver clasp – designed for quick and easy release – hidden at the throat. This cloak was where the difference lay. Tobias and Draco’s cloaks were a deep mahogany edged with silver, gold, copper and bronze thread designed into small, but complicated, Celtic knots.
Blaise’s jaw dropped and the common room was filled with snickering.
Iron and steel will bend and bow,
Minerva cornered the twins before they could follow their Pack members out of the Hall after the meal had finished. “We want to talk to the two of you in my office, she said calmly. “Don’t worry, they will be returned to you for the night,” she added with a roll of her eyes to the pouting black-haired teen that had just flamed next to her.
Finally – after nearly two hours of waiting, the doors opened to reveal the one person she had been waiting for. She ignored the people who were already in the almost full room as she raised her wand and aimed it, not noticing that the spell she had used to conceal herself had vanished.
To begin with, most of The Pack had been against the idea of holding a Winter Olympic Games – it was a muggle orientated thing after all – but when Ginny had explained that Alpha would be included by being the person who decided who won instead of being left to sit and watch while everyone else had fun, they had conceded. It had been Alpha who had pointed out that they would only be copying the muggles so far as holding a competition between teams comprised of a variety of smaller competitions.
“And when he wants a break from that, I’ll take over with getting him to teach me how to cook.” Severus and Tom looked at Lucius in disbelief. “What? I must admit that it never occurred to me to learn how to cook, but Tobias makes it look quite enjoyable and I want to give 'Cissa something special for Valentine’s Day this year.”
Hogwarts herself shivered in disgust. In the Founder’s rooms, a trill and a flash of black flame signalled the departure of Thanatos.
With no difficulty at all, Neville found Luna softly humming as she inspected a glass jar.
Draco shut the door of their suite of rooms with a solid THUNK on the exceedingly pale face of his father and the reddening faces of the other.
The door opened and everyone gaped. Severus Snape stood to one side with a sulking Tobias held bridal style in his arms. On the other side of the doorway stood a man that none of the students had seen before. It was the three in the middle, however, that caught everyone’s attention. Luna Lovegood was standing – albeit shakily- -  with an arm around the shoulders of a very familiar pair of twins. Twins that were wearing pin-striped suits, shoes and hats that wouldn’t look out of place on the set of a music video for ‘Smooth Criminal’ or ‘Bad Bad Leroy Brown’.
“Not a problem,” the twins chorused with a wide grin before leaving the room.
Ginny and Gregory had birthed only the one cub that, to the regret of many, formed a close bond with his identical twin uncles and kept all his adopted family on their toes with his pranks and rambunctious attitude.
Tobias nuzzled into an immobile Draco’s side, whining softly when he didn’t react to his attempts at snuggling. He pouted a little before a spark of mischief appeared in his eye.
“She’s beautiful,” Draco murmured as he ran the tip of one finger across the soft cheek in front of him. “Just like her amazing mother.” He planted a sweet, loving kiss on Tobias’ flushed cheek.
Draco smiled warmly at his betrothed, notifying all who could see him that he believed he had someone special. Severus secretly had to agree. Maybe it was time for him to seek courtship of a certain wolf.
“It comes as no surprise to me that Luna and Pansy won today,” Blaise said, shaking his head with a defeated smile. “Both are beautiful, intelligent women with a very sadistic outlook that seems to complement and build between them.”
“I’ve always said that children are a nuisance,” the man on his right added with a snort.
Tobias smiled happily at the two of them. “That is wonderful to hear! Are you staying for the Evening meal?”
Something has occurred here at Hogwarts that will make our overall plan go much smoother and faster. I believe that Hogwarts is really and truly ours. The only problem we have is Dumbledore. All the teachers bar him have sworn loyalty to me and me only. Every … single … one … of … them. I was wondering if they could come by during the winter holidays to meet the family before the bonding ceremony. Christmas is two weeks away now, and I can’t wait to see everyone again.
“Draco knows.”
A soft ‘hem hem’ entered the conversation. “If your son got another student pregnant, then both of them should be expelled for improper conduct in a school.”
“And can we have a name?” Amelia asked, struggling to contain her laughter. It was clear to anyone who bothered to take note of the name of their silent partner.
The two teens smiled slightly and walked into the Hall.
Wu opened his mouth angrily and Amelia raised one hand with a finger fully extended in the traditional ‘wait’ sign as the other lifted a mug of sweet-scented tea to her lips. When the mug had been lowered to around chest height, Amelia looked at the man with an eyebrow raised.
Chapter 56
“It settles into the brain of whatever picks it up and stays there until the person who infused them with magic wakes up the magic once again. It is how I keep my plants from being damaged by pests. I have a section set aside for insect use so I imprint it on the bacteria using my magic so only that area is damaged while everywhere else gets the benefit of insects like butterflies without the damage that is done by their young.”
Tobias nodded; absorbing everything he was being told.
“How utterly Slytherin of you Ginevra. There is hope for the Weasley clan yet.”
I know you give me sanctuary
Tom dropped the mix of herbs in alarm as Draco leapt to Tobias’ side and began attempting to calm him. After ten minutes, Tobias had calmed enough to start giving orders.
Ginny laughed and transfigured a sweets wrapper into a piece of parchment. She pulled a self-inking pen from behind Luna’s ear and wrote a short reply. “Give this to one of them, Lycia.” The owl bobbed her head several times and took off, leaving both girls to watch her vanish from sight.
Lucius sighed as he stood to get his next victe … erm … student. He had been, thankfully, lucky so far with those he had been assigned to sort out. As he had been the only person who had no fifth years to see, he had been the one to get the Patil twins. He was very thankful that their father had been present to glare them into submission – well, one of them at any rate. He entered the room with the second last student and closed his eyes, hoping he was seeing things. Opening them, he turned around and walked out of the tent and yelled out his frustrations. Something out there hated him; he was sure of it. He had been landed with the red-headed twat.
Tobias looked at his father, and then at Draco, his cheeks flushed with embarrassment. Draco chuckled as his husband hid his face in his shirtfront.
“I have arithmancy and ancient runes,” Draco answered after thinking for a moment.
London Bridge is falling down,
“Milord, I have something I must tell you, Remus, Lucius and Narcissa. It is concerning your heirs,” the man whispered.
Tobias bowed slightly. “Yes, Gran’mere Rowan. I am the only heir of all four of you. My mother was descended from Gran’ther Godric and Gran’ther Sal. My father from yourself and Gran’mere Helga. There is only one other heir at the moment, and he is my adopted father, Tom Riddle. Both my parents were killed when it was discovered they were spies of the dark.”
“I have lost everything,” she stated loudly, making all eyes turn to her. “I lost my friends. I lost my grades. The respect I had from my peers is gone.”
Tom watched Tobias closely. “Do you know what was written in the letter I received from Mr Zabini?”
“Tomorrow I am going to be starting to clean a new location for myself. I am going to be safer – and more at home – in the Chamber than I am here. When I have made myself at home, I will collect my pack and bind them to the Chamber’s magic so they can use Hogwarts to get to me. The rest of you will be getting two passwords. I will explain them to you when the time comes for you to get them. One more thing before you all head off to bed.” He waited for the shuffling to settle down.
The questioner gaped at Harry in shock. It was evident that he hadn’t expected anyone to know about that rule with the exception of the person who told him to ignore it.
Algernon nodded and shot spells at the now straightened patient and smiled in relief.
“We are away?”
Looking up, he found perfectly polished cut stone. Glancing at the ground, he stopped abruptly causing those behind him to stop also.
Draco moved away chuckling, watching as Algernon started casting spell after spell on the now dozing teen. Once the examination was complete, Draco gently shook Tobias awake.
“Let’s gather in the dining room, it is almost time for supper. Remus? Could you stay and show Harry the way?”
“You know me far too well. Now, the second and more important, reason I am here is … I would like to hire one of your curse breakers and maybe two of your staff who deal in heavy lifting.”
“Suck,” he ordered, “it’s the only lubricant you’ll get.” He purposely neglected to say that the yellow vial also had an extra benefit of coating it’s ‘hosts’ – for lack of a better term – interior lubricated so the electrical current could travel.
“I – I want you to, Draco,” Tobias whimpered, “But – but can I – I do something first? Then you can claim me however you wish.”
Tobias paled. “I want to do the week without the potion please Sev. All The Pack are essentially ready for their N.E.W.Ts and putting off our plans for one week won’t hurt them too much. I could stay here, or with Pateras, or Lykos, or even Nona and Anadochos, but please don’t make me take the potion!”
With a wave of her wand, a series of silencing charms were activated. With another wave a metal table steaming with cold rose from the floor to stop five inches below Ronald’s prone form while another four blade positioned themselves two inches above each of his hips and each of his shoulders.
Chapter 42
“Madam Greengrass,” Pansy also bowed to the formidable lady.
“History of Magic, both transfiguration exams and DADA theory. You?”
“If we took a potion without knowing, they would still be visible because our magic would be fighting it, not accepting it,” George continued, treating the Healer as though she was an infant.
“How do you use it?” Theo asked, intrigued.
“What’s wrong Kyria?” Tobias asked as Vincent transformed back to human from his wolf form and pulled his chosen mate close.
“Milord, supper is almost ready. We would be most honoured if you were to join us.”
“These are for you,” Neville explained when he caught the question in Amelia’s eye. “The top sheet is a map of where we will be in the event that one – or more – of us are needed. The sheet under that is a list of who is in the group, followed by a rough schedule. The last sheet is to go to Professor Snape after his physical is over. It’s just a note telling him where he can find his godsons since they won’t be in their room, in his office or in Professor McGonagall’s office. He’ll panic if he doesn’t know where they are – not that I blame him, what with what has been happening lately.”
“Beautiful,” he whispered, running a fingertip over Draco’s cheek. “You, Drakontas, are perfection personified.” Tobias bowed over the hand in his and planted a soft kiss on the fingers. “May I escort you to our table?”
Deloris gulped and struggled to her feet. “You can’t …”
“Karma.”
Tom glared at the grinning devils before him with as much heat as he could muster. He sighed in resignation when he realised they weren’t affected by it.
Tobias nodded and tightened his hold on one of his most loyal friends, not reaching when the girl woke at his movement and started to run her fingers in gentle strokes through his hair and down the sides of his face. When Severus returned with the potion, it was Luna who got him to drink it, making Severus and Minerva chuckled slightly when she insisted on cleaning the small amounts of spillage and residue with her tongue, her mind still slightly more wolf then human if the growls, whines and whimpers she was releasing were any indication.
Sorry for missing last week, I was visiting family and couldn't take my writing with me. This chapter has a warning!
Then the memories of Ron came and they almost broke her heart. She honestly loved the red-head and being forced to stay away from him was agonizing. If it had just been her parents who had forbidden her access to him, she would have stayed with him, despite her parent’s wishes, but her Father had sent a letter to her Head of House telling her about the conversation and the punishment they had installed while asked for her help to keep Hermione separated from the hot-headed red-head. It stung when McGonagall had replied to her parents stating that she had already placed a restriction on both her wayward students and the castle’s magic would aid in their separation.
Tobias laughed softly. “I don’t have an animagus form, Lykos.”
Tobias was shaking his head. Severus raised an eyebrow.
The wolves smoothly transformed back into their human forms and silently they turned and walked towards their audience. The gathered crowd separated and watched as the fifteen youngsters who ended the second war against Voldemort walked through them to the café they were originally at. No one said anything as five distinctive adults joined them.
Tom nodded in thanks “We only have Nona, Anadochos and Nonos to go before your Pack can give their reports. I’m thinking of dealing with that wayward Healer of mine before you start though. I may even be able to obtain a new healer for you – one that is better suited to your condition.”
Will not stay, will not stay.
Ginny giggled slightly. “Here is the letter they wrote me.” She handed the letter to Tobias and moved back to her place, only to be replaced by Luna.
“Yes, you were so difficult to place, and it was such a disappointment to not be able to put you in the right house. Well, that is to be expected, with you being the Founder’s Heir and all.”
Harry yipped and started to drag the carcass towards Voldemort. Remus laughed.
A nod from the fashionable lady beside Amelia was more than anyone expected.
With a nod of respect and acknowledgement, Tobias stood as the goblins filed out before turning to the group with him
The portrait moved and the three of them stepped into the rooms.
Draco almost jumped when one of the lights glided over to him. He giggled when he realised that it was a fire-fairy. He looked at Tobias in awe when beautiful otherworldly voices started to sing. Tobias smiled at him; his eyes softer than Draco had ever seen them.
Someone in the congregation sniggered. “That’s telling him.” The man yelped when a stinging hex hit him.
Ronald Bilious Weasley – second youngest child of Molly and Arthur Weasley – was snuggly wrapped in spider silk and was being rocked like a babe by a large accumentula. Ron’s brain snapped.
Draco growled and hissed at the dark-skinned male, causing him to chuckle. “Alright, youngster. Let’s get you to your mate. He is waiting for you.”
“Your father was sorry that he could not be here to tell you himself, but as you know it is not safe for him to be seen just yet. Due to this, he wishes for you to choose the name you wish to complete your studies under, since it is not safe for either of you for you to go under your legal name. This will be the name in all your records until neither of you are in danger from a certain psychopath.”
Bricks and Mortar will not stay,
Derrin eyed Deloris’ form with a critical eye. He may have been a squib from an old and ancient house, but he was no idiot. He knew EXACTLY who she was. He fought the sadistic grin that wanted to show. He turned and nodded his understanding.
Salazar nodded. “Yes, I believe it is, not could be. He is showing the same symptoms in the same time period as I did. There is only one way to be sure and that is to get a healer you trust to confirm it.”
Tobias smiled and hugged the blonde youth. “It is my first courting gift to you Drakontas. I know we are betrothed – and by contract no less – but I wish to woo you as if the contract had never been created.” Keeping his eyes locked on his Dragon’s mercury ones, he placed a gentle, chaste kiss on the back of his fingers.
Chapter 46
Tobias and Draco stood and walked to the portrait. “Good morrow, Sir. We have much to discuss. May I request the company of your three companions to be present for this discussion?”
“But you see,” he continued through the loud yelp that came from the boned, “I don’t. It is a nice feeling, to sink into such lovely heated water – but your arse has stretched so much that I cannot get any friction. We can’t have that now, can we?”
Tobias nodded. “You’re hired. You are also to try and keep the incompetent imbeciles away from me. Also, talk to Winky for me. Tell her that there is a family that wants a nursery elf in the future and they will be wanting a good elf for that job. Tell her that you are sure that she will get the position, but she needs to stop drinking, clean her act up and show that she is a willing house-elf that will do as she is told. Do not tell her who the family is.”
“Pateras wants us to go home tonight. Seems like one of his spy’s found something and he wants us there for discussions,” Tobias muttered sleepily.
Tobias moaned in delight as he sank into the warm depths of the bath. The water’s surface had been liberally coated in rose petals and with one inhale it was evident that a pregnancy-friendly cleaning potion had been added to the water. The entire room was dancing in the light of a thousand and one lit candles and the normally green, black and white room had the added mystery of shadow and harmless sweet-scented smoke.
Waking up, she noticed the faint sounds of an argument coming from down stairs. The scene in the sitting room was enough to make her choke with anger – ‘Harry’, as Tobias was still playing, was being alternately lectured and yelled at for getting up at three in the morning to go to the loo without waking either Ron or Hermione before doing so.
I am also the son and heir of Pateras,” the congregation paled when a smirking Voldemort rose from his seat. Tobias’ cowl flew back off his head, revealing his face.
Slowly, Draco started to knead the almost golden globes, causing Tobias to moan, and him to smirk. Gradually, Draco progressed from kneading to rubbing; his thumbs inching towards the creases that held his prize. He almost grinned triumphantly when Tobias gasped in pleasure when his cheeks were opened softly. Smirking with the thought of his husband’s reaction to what he was going to do, he slowly ran the tip of his tongue from the base of Tobias’ ball sac to the base of his spine.
“And here we thought she couldn’t get worse looking then she was originally,” Fred stated seriously to his nodding twin.
Tobias grinned. “Predator; Now, let’s do as much of this weekend’s work as we can. I intend to dislodge a know-it-all beaver from the top student position and I don’t intend to loose time with Pateras to do so. Kitten? Can you deliver any books we may need directly to us when we ask for them please?”
Tobias smirked. “Yes, he did go back to sleep. All I had to do was mention that there would be rats down there and he decided that it would be best for him to wait till it had been cleaned.”
Arketa – Pretty
Pavarti mumbled something softly, going slightly darker with both shame and embarrassment.
Albus Dumbledore glared at the dark-haired boy who was responsible for all his problems as the group of Slytherins handed over multiple scrolls of paper to him. He didn’t worry about what was on the scrolls as he had been told by Severus that the lad read over all of their Defence work and he had seen and heard the evidence with his own eyes and ears. Oh if only something he planned would work!
Tom grinned. “I like him. Do you want a job?”
Tobias giggled. “No, I just told him that I’m going to be a Mama. I’m pregnant!” Once more, he mentally counted to three and watched as the second daemon fainted. He started to laugh without stopping. Draco, after hearing the commotion appeared two minutes later with his wand drawn. After being told what had happened, he also stated laughing uncontrollably. It was the funniest thing he had ever heard.
Tobias nodded. “Three of my Pack are unable to be here tonight, so I will take over their reports tonight.” He sighed. “I’m so looking forward to when I can come home. I need to be in a less stressful environment.”
The Healer smiled gently. “Then I will leave their removal to whomever is doing it.”
Watching in amusement as Tobias disappeared into the hole, Draco smiled. He was finally going to see the infamous Chamber! After a few minutes Draco lowered himself to the entrance and followed his betrothed, laughing at the feeling of freedom the journey gave him. He laughed in surprise when a pair of strong arms caught him.
“WHAAAAAT!” everyone shrieked before quickly putting everything in a pile on the tables before them and running for the door. There was a new Pack member on the way and they had to be there to welcome them.
Tobias smiled. “You all should start to prepare for the day. Breakfast is in an hour.”
“As Patriarch of the British branch of the Patil line, I accept the transfer on behalf of my youngest daughter and give my blessing to this union.”
“Sir please! You know it isn’t safe …”
Harry smirked and gripped Draco’s dick firmly before lowering his head and softly tonguing the now extremely tight star.
Despite his ever darkening thoughts, Harry smiled at them. “If you don’t mind, I will not be answering any questions until I get back from my holidays. My Deputy Minister, Ms Amelia Bones, will be answering any and all questions for a week from tomorrow. It has been a very long, stressful day and I would like to go home and start my leave by relaxing before the boredom kicks in.”
Draco barely managed to stop himself from laughing at his husband. “You missed breakfast, picked at lunch and refused afternoon tea Bi,” he pointed out once he got himself under control. “You have to have something to eat now or our cub is going to be not happy with you.”
Voldemort stood as Tobias got up off the floor and walked to him, stretching the aches out of his muscles. Hugging him, Tobias squeezed gently.
“I’ll do it Pans, don’t worry,” he reassured her. “Alpha won’t hold it against any of you. He more than any of us would insist of you going back.”
Laugher rippled through the group. “What else does he know – or heard – about this mystery man?” Neville asked, draped in one of the leather armchairs as if he belonged there.
“What can Liccy do for Mr Snape, Sir?”
“Feel up to a bath?” Draco asked with a soft smile.
“Here are the notes I’ve taken on the reports from the battle baits so far. There isn’t much because they had nothing much of interest to say.”
Two hours later, three owls arrived at their destinations. It was amazing that no one heard the commotion going on in Riddle House that night.
It was lunchtime before the two boys decided to reunite with The Pack and their family. Walking into the quiet and depressed room, they glanced at each other.
“I forgive you ‘Bi,” Draco muttered. “Let’s get you to bed. You might not have class tomorrow, but I do.”
I don't know whether to be happy to be finished this story or to be depressed that it is over. This was the very first story that I posted and the first one that I planned. There have been times that I have wanted to sit in a corner and weep while writing this, just as there have been times that I have wanted to throw the computer and the books I've been writing in into the corner and forget about it, but I've persevered and now ... Now I am going to find myself a corner, curl up into a little ball and bawl my eyes out because it is the end of my very first chaptered story. *sniffles* My baby has grown up and is leaving home. :'(
Bill Weasley – Katara [Curse] – Dark Mage
“I do,” Lucius grit out, making everyone who knew him to wince. “The reason for this inquest is to determine the suitability of the present Headmaster to remain in this position. To do this, we will have to talk to several students from each house whose parents have been worried enough about what their children have been writing home that they have bought it to the attention of either the Board of Governors or one of the high-ups in the Ministry. I have a list of names and the parent’s concerns on me, however I believe that many more of the students may be noticing odd things and either not telling anyone or they have but it has been brushed aside as ridiculous.”
Remus, the Weasleys and Draco laughed as Tobias’ face darkened slightly.
It wasn’t long before Severus broached the subject they were there to discuss.
Draco glanced over at his partner and winked at him with a roguish grin. “It’s wonderful for all of us Bi,” he said, reaching for Tobias’ hand. “Nothing in this world could make me happier than I am right now – except maybe having our cub here with us.”
Bouno - Mountain
“Both COMC, both transfiguration,” Greg and Vince chorused.
Tobias was seated at the Gryffindor table, once more wedged between Ron and Hermione. He smirked inwardly when Hogwarts registered Lucius’ arrival. It was almost time … and …
A beam of light shot towards Tobias as he removed the Sorting Hat. When it hit him, he let out an ear-splitting scream of pain as he burst into white-edged blue and green flames. Phoenix song filled the hall moments before Thanatos flamed to his master’s side. Without hesitation, the flame-bird wrapped his wings around the boy and, once more, triggered his burning reflex.
Everyone who was left in the room laughed or chuckled as Minerva growled and slammed her head into the desk in front of her.
“Yeah,” Blaise added with a laugh, “the last thing anyone will need in your shop is a cheering charm.”
Draco handed a scroll to the older man, who swore. The note was short.
Within moments, Tobias had been reduced to a quivering pile of goo once more. If you were to ask him later how he still managed to thrust in time with Draco, he wouldn’t have been able to answer.
“Enter!”
“Why the Hell do we need to listen to him? He’s a damn well pansy!” a loud voice stated.
Draco sighed in resignation. “I’ll try it with you Bi. Just let me get a fork.”
Mischief Managed.
Can you see me
Severus arrived several moments later to find a silent common room. He smiled to himself when he saw his godsons asleep in each other’s arms. He had a suspicion that neither had gotten much sleep while they were away. He cleared his throat softly so he didn’t disturb the two sleeping students.
Draco stopped abruptly. “Each pregnancy? As in more than one?”
The two girls nodded.
“Following orders, milord,” they answered.
Draco nodded and led the way.
~End flashback~
You understand me like nobody can
He smirked internally as the girl paled. “As I suggested, it would be in your best interest to stay away from him, he is nothing but trouble – If you don’t believe me you can ask your Head of House, but for now, you should get to bed – I believe you have me first thing in the morning?”
Remus nodded distractedly. “Thank you Luna … um … where did you get the lolly pop?”
“Yeah, Gran had a couple of them at home. I used to sneak in and play with them when I was younger. One day they disappeared and I never found out where they went,” Neville said with a half-sad smile.
“I also hear that someone has the Were-Laws up for review sometime this week? Wonder who would have the audacity to do that? Oh, and Miss Umbridge? My name is Mr Black, not Mr Potter and as you can see,” he held out both hands to reveal the backs of them, “I have no blood quill taint on my body. Have a good day, Miss.” He bowed mockingly and walked into the building, followed by two grinning men.
Ron jolted awake for the third time since he had left the common room. He was cursing the traitors’ name. He had sent a letter to his parents telling them about Ginny’s betrayal and was hopeful of seeing her punishment the following day. With these happy thoughts, he fell asleep.
This made all of the men smile. Sev stood and hugged the youth. Reaching into his pocket, he removed and enlarged a small package. “From Draco,” he whispered.
“I’ll be alright,” he said. “I’ll just take a nap now, deal with those two meetings and then go straight to bed. Wake me when the food vanishes?”
“This means Draco and I can’t go to lunch in four days, doesn’t it?” Tobias asked, resigned. He and Draco had decided to take Melody to the Ministry to introduce her to Cornelius, Amelia and Achalendra. The man was going to be back in England for only the one day to talk to the Minister about his transfer to the Indian Ministry for a year and to catch up with his daughter and her intended.
Tobias chuckled and left with his and Neville’s ingredients, growling a warning at Lavender on the way. Tobias didn’t see Lavender smirk at him as he settled next to Neville, but Draco, Blaise and Severus did. Sev hoped that he had enough of his strongest calming draft left to douse Tobias if the stupid idiot of a female tried anything.
Algernon smirked. “Yes. I do believe I would like a job. Would you mind if I started now with a physical check-up?”
“Why would I bother doing either when I would be getting rid of the dratted thing I was getting out in the first place?” she sneered.
Draco snarled and sent a very nasty hex towards his Father, who only just managed to move out of the way of it.
Severus, Lucius, Remus and Narcissa hid their grins at the lecture, having been through one before, but not even they could hide their astonishment when their Lord bowed his head in shame and whispered, “Yes Alpha.”
“You said ‘bands’ – as in more than one. How many were placed on him?” Pomona asked.
Seeing the agreement in Tobias’ eyes, Draco rose from his position on his partner and watched him turn before heading towards something that had caught his eye.
“I am removing you from my son’s prenatal care as soon as I can find a new healer specialising in male pregnancy.”
Chapter 52
“RANDAL!”
Ron screamed louder still as the metal bridge stared to bend and warp into odd shapes. He choked on his own breathe when the bending metal started to wrap itself cage-like around him. With a loud snap, the last piece of un-warped metal snapped, sending the ensnared boy tumbling into the web and spider infested depths.
Draco smirked and stretched out on his side as he watched his husband disappear. He jumped when ice-cold water hit his chest. Listening to his husband’s laughter, he knew where it came from. “Tobias!” he growled. Tobias just laughed and sent another double-handful of water at him. “That’s it!” Draco hissed, as he leapt after Tobias.
Standing here where I've always been
*gasp* another two chapters! well ... it is the season for miracles
Tobias turned to the founders. “Is there a way to see what happened that day?”
Neville laughed at the pale faces of the five adults. “I think you gave them too much information for their comfort.”
Draco nodded. “What subjects have you done?” he asked as they sat the other six pack members.
Breathing deeply, Harry followed the chain with his fingers until his suspicions were proven to be correct – the chain was attached to something that filled his Pet’s anal passage. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Harry pushed Draco back up the pole so he could get a closer look at what was under the skirt. What he found almost made him cum without any external stimulation. The devise Draco was wearing was something of Harry’s own design and was only bought out when Draco was being punished or when Draco wanted to be completely dominated.
“Forgive me Madam, I am Tobias’ personal healer. He mentioned that he requested my presence for the medical examinations of himself and his family, did he not?”
“Firstly, both boys are perfectly fine heath wise. Mr Gryffindor was correct in saying it was just magical drainage.”
Thank Merlin and the Mother for Tobias.
“Sorry about that,” he said, grinning as the spells on the room changed his voice to be slighter higher pitched than normal. “I forgot that you were tied up at this point in time.”
Mimpsie arrived, trembling in fear as it stood before a hormonally charge Tobias.
“What was that Skoteinos?’ Luna asked, looking intently at the dozing teen.
Lucius nodded, thoughtfully. “I will tell them, son.”
“EEEE!” Tobias squealed happily, his mind now completely on Vince’s news. “What did you get her? It had better be match what she gave to you!”
“Mmm,” a voice hummed as the person nuzzled into his neck. “I love the way you smell, Drakontas.”
“It looks as if we are having venison sometime this week for supper.”
Tobias raised an eyebrow at the bushy-haired Gryffindor. “And this concerns us how exactly?”
“What respect?” Neville murmured only just loud enough for Millicent, Pansy and Blaise to hear, causing them to snigger slightly.
It wasn’t fair to the female sex, Amelia could agree with that, but in a world where corrupt men held the power and were long lived, there wasn’t much of a choice. At times, Amelia found herself thinking about what would change if You-Know-Who was in a position of power before she shook herself out of her thoughts. Still … the way that both Severus and Lucius spoke of the man before insanity overtook his mind caught and held her attention and nothing she did would allow it to loosen its hold on her mind.
“Well, Young Lady?”
Amelia covered her laughter with a cough. She and her brother were born into one of the top ten richest families in magical Europe and they had been taught to take care of themselves as soon as they had been old enough. Sure they had house-elves, but they had set chores that were theirs and the house-elves had been forbidden to do and once they were at a certain age, they had spent their summer holidays in a house where there were no house-elves so they could learn how to look after themselves without magic. She was doing the exact same thing with her niece, who was taking to the lessons like a duck to water.
Tobias’ muffled voice came from his neck, causing him to chuckle.
Imposter Draco smirked. “It doesn’t matter. As far as these people around us know, your
As everyone who had orders carried them out, Draco pulled the still trembling form of his husband onto his lap and stroked soothing circles from the base of his neck to the top of his arse. The two of them jumped with a start when a shriek sounded.
Tobias continued writing, a small smile appearing on his face as he reached for a small stack of parchment at the top of the desk. “I like to think that is more me becoming more attuned to being a house-wife, if you will. I’m going to be staying home with the children and I will teach them all they need to know. As such I will need something to do as work. I have already agreed to sort out Anadochos’ library at the Manor as I have offered to do his and Pateras’ paperwork – as long as they set it aside in a room for me to do one day a week. They can obviously either do the things that need immediate attention themselves or send it to me via Thanis. I will also be discussing the school curriculum with the founders, sorting out the rooms of the castle and their contents and starting on plans for a sister-school to Hogwarts that will be home to first years as they learn the basics. I may even open it as a part-time school or camp for muggle-born and half-blood students so they can lean to traditions of the wizarding world without having the pure-bloods always over them making them feel worst then they already do ...”
Sally-Anne laughed softly and shook her head. “Not all the time. What do you have there Tobias?”
“Then how about thinking about what other names I can use!” Tobias snapped.
When the Slytherins entered the Great Hall several people called out greetings. Tobias smirked to himself. This bit of his plan is working perfectly. In the ruckus going on around him, Tobias dropped four origami animals that ran to four people. On opening them, they all read the same:
“So that’s why you don’t want us to do anything alone or with magic,” Pansy observed.
Harry sighed and his eyes glazed over. “After Sirius died, I was a wreck. Dumbledore took me back to his office and I raged. I’d had enough. First the dementor attack, then no one telling me anything – well, no one but Siri.  Then a hearing in front of the full wizengamet, meeting that toad, Umbridge – only to discover she was to be our DADA Professor.” He looked up at Severus. “We were all led to believe she was forced onto Dumbledore by Fudge, but I discovered that she was asked for by name for the position – I’ll talk about that later.”
Tobias almost growled in irritation. He couldn’t wait for the Sorting to be over with so he could wash his hands of his so-called friends. He was dreaming of the looks of outrage on their faces when Lucius walks into the room, when the door to his compartment opened. Before anyone else noticed that the door was open, Tobias mouthed, “Help me.”
“We’ll also not forget the fact you spent nearly three of every five nights in detention with her for anything up to five hours,” Neville stated dryly.
Draco groaned. “Not more paperwork!”
Hogwarts herself laughed joyfully, startling the students once more. “Oh, come now, dear Hat. Is that any way to talk to the Heir?” She asked listening to the retorts the Hat was now aiming at the boy whose head he was on.
Draco sighed in relief. It had taken him, Severus and Thanatos the entire breakfast time to calm Tobias down. At the moment the two of them were in Severus’ private lab, where they were checking the potions ingredients and noting which ones needed to be restocked. He was interrupted from his thoughts by a nervous cough.
“Have you got the papers?” Draco asked as he retrieved the wooden peg he had thrown at the unconscious female.
“Harry, just go to the normal bed you are put in. Draco, you go to the bed that is as far away from him as it is possible to be. I’m disappointed in the both of you.”
Severus nodded. “What is your guardian tonight?”
“You are most welcome. I’m assuming you do not require me to tell you to keep your eyes closed for a few more minutes while the Healing stabilizes.”
“Me either,” George grinned. “And with this, ‘Bi will have no more trouble with our family and have a spy there so we can focus on others.”
“Not just us either,” George stated with a grin.
“Now, no lasting damage and no letting on of who you are until you can guarantee that you will not be discovered.” Tobias smirked. “Your reward is Granger. She’s yours to do what you will until it is time for me to fulfil my vow.” He made a face. “Just do not rape her, it is beneath you as a pure-blood and a member of this pack.”
Chapter 49
With one last wave, he used one of the privileges of being Minister of Magic and apparated out of the building to his own house’s front yard. Blinking to clear his vision of the little white spots that had appeared in his travels, he waved and smiled sheepishly in the direction of his neighbour’s voice and almost skipped with happiness to his door, where Tiddles – his house elf and the son of Kretcher – was waiting with a pot of tea and a plate of food that was both good for him and tastier than what most wizards ate.
Tobias smiled at Draco as the blonde played with their daughter while they waited on their meals. Dobby was seated under their table and invisible to all eyes, keeping his magic confined but ready to act should he be provoked into defending his master’s family.
Tobias looked him over, taking in the slight flush, the new clothes and the blonde hair, which had been tied back with a slightly sparkling green-grey ribbon.
“Can you read over that for me please Madam Bones?” Tobias asked. “I trust Grapplefang and would have read it myself, but I kinda can’t see straight.”
No one in the Hall took any notice of the Slytherin’s after they had entered as their attention was on something … or someone … else. Their attention was caught up in the person seated between the Headmaster and the Transfiguration Professor.
Everyone in the Hall stared in shock at the prone form of Luna Lovegood as invisible knives sliced into every bit of skin they could see and a large pool of blood quickly formed around her.
Once again all eyes turned to the bonded couple, where Tobias had wrapped his arms around Draco’s hips, his head on the blonde’s stomach, fast asleep. The men and women who didn’t know the couple well quietly left the room, followed by Lucius, who was to tell the rest of The Pack that they could enter. He knew it would be useless to tell them to leave. He smirked to himself when all the members of The Pack, including the two fifth years, were standing at the entrance.
“He would Crucio them, young Lord,” the answer, barely a whisper, betrayed the man’s fear of the youth before him – as did his shivering.
“Calm down, Harry! You need to calm down. If you don’t you will do irreparable damage.” Harry continued to hyperventilate. “Draco, if we don’t get him to calm down he’ll never forgive himself.”
“You mean …” Luna asked with eyes wide.
“That’s it?” Bill asked in disbelief.
She turned her attention back to the goblin, ignoring the amused chuckles that came from his companions. “I thank you for your answering my query.”
“You mean you don’t mind that I was weak last night?” he asked in a small voice.
He heard a soft crinkling sound coming from his shirt pocket and smirked.
Amelia sighed in exasperation as she turned away yet another student who wanted to be excused from the medical check-up. She looked up when a throat was softly cleared close to her.
After plunging the slick muscle into his husband’s depths several more times, Draco removed it and slithered up the tanned body until he reached his husband’s ear. “Did you like that? Did you like the feeling of my tongue pushing into you?” he whispered heatedly.
“These four are charged with the teaching of my son, should anything prevent me from being there. Do you accept?”
As soon as Draco heard that Tobias was calling for him, he jumped up and ran from the room and into the form of the Dark Lord. Bowing and making an apology, Draco took off again to get to his intended’s side. The Dark Lord remained where he was on the floor, blinking in surprise after him.
Draco started to giggle, causing everyone bar Tobias – who just grinned at him – and Severus, who was now looking like he was going to faint, to look at him in worry.
“Hello, my Lord,” he whispered back, eyes sparkling in mischief.
“Are we sure that’s You-Know-Who?” one of the Aurors who had followed her asked suspiciously.
“Shh, Harry. Shh. It’s all right. You’re safe here. You’re with me at Snape Manor.  You are in one of my guest rooms. You have nothing but your owl here, which is why you are not dressed under the covers.  I’m sorry, but I had to undress you to clean and tend to your wounds.  I healed what I could, but there is a lot I cannot heal without time and proper nutrition.  I can remover the bands ay your throat, wrists and ankles, but not until your body is well enough to handle the return of your magic, and not by myself.  Do you understand?”
“I see congratulations are in order,” she grinned as she spied the now sleeping bundle in Draco’s arms. “She’s beautiful.”
“Thank you my Dear,” Cornelius smiled. Standing, he indicated for the two men to follow him.
“The Patil family and Alpha of young Mister Weasley than the Goblin Nation for their generous offer and accept,” Tobias replied, much to the shock of those around him.
Cornelius raised his eyebrows. “Why haven’t I been told about this before now?”
Before too long, Harry found himself reclining in the large leather arm chair in his secret room in the dungeon, waiting to see what treat his Pet had for him tonight. He gasped loudly as the tiny fairy lights and the single spotlight in the room turned on and focused on the tall pole that resided in the room he was in and the one above it. He felt his dick give an interested twitch as he noted the change that had been made in the usually plain silver piece of metal.
Remus smiled. “Good to see you back to normal, Neogennito. I think you’ve shocked a few people though.”
“That it has,” Tobias agreed with a smile as he slowly led his beloved to the bed they had shared since their bonding so many years ago. With one last kiss for the day, both men fell into dreams where all their loved ones still lived.
“Potions, charms, Herbology.”
Tobias nodded and settled down at the transfigured table with his year mates to do his subject work.
“I got this for you,” Draco murmured so not to interrupt the bumbling idiot before them. In his hand was a glass of the drink the centaurs had introduced him to.
Remus swallowed hard then looked up into Severus’ shocked, wet eyes. “I am in no way ending our relationship, Severus. I am not rejecting you, or your proposal. I just wish to put our engagement on hold until such a time as I feel I have proven just how much I love you.”
“I sense traitors,” the man said, revealing a smooth, sibilant voice. His eyes landed on Tobias’ group and an evil sneer graced his lips. “You!” he hissed.
“It smells so good,” the blonde murmured, blushing a delicate pink.
Amelia grinned slightly in the direction of a chuckling Minerva. It was so funny seeing the usually stoic Malfoy Lord act like such a prude when it was rumoured that he was quite the play-boy in his school years.
Four hours after he left the school, Severus was leaving the Headmaster’s office after ‘reporting’ on the meeting. All he wanted to do was fall into his bed and sleep the week away, but he couldn’t. He needed to meet his Lord and his Lord’s healer in his rooms so he could take them to the young Lord.
Severus waited until Ronald Weasley had processed what he had seen and heard and had raised his wand in retaliation [a solid ten minutes after the fact mind you] before slamming the door closed and stalking to his usual position.
As Severus and his father rested before removing the last band, he heard himself ask, “Who made them, Sev? Do you know? And if you do, are they going to be punished?” ‘And can I help?’ he added silently.
“I don’t know,” Tom replied softly, “But whatever it is has to be more than great. Severus deserves nothing less.”
Tobias grinned and rushed to his trunk to find a shirt. Severus sighed in relief. He had not known if his gamble would have paid off. He knew that his new godson only ate small amounts, but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t to eat regularly! Shaking his head at these thoughts, he decided that he was wrong to have pulled the boy off the blood nutrient potion. He’d make sure that he got put back on it right away … after breakfast. He cringed at the thought of Remus’ laughing voice echoing ‘I told you so’ throughout his head.
“Randal isn’t going to like this,” Lucius stated after a moment of silence. “He was against Tobias returning after Severus contacted us for help in healing the boy.”
Severus and Minerva smiled at the teen and nodded at him. “You should get to class,” Severus stated, mock sternly. “I hear the Professor is a mean bastard to students who are late.”
He sighed in annoyance as he thought about Tobias. He had been taken away from school by the Toad-faced bitch working for the Minister straight after classes. Tobias hadn’t wanted to go with her at first and once he’d discovered that he’d had no choice, he had done what his father would have done.
Luna noted Neville coming through the door alone and winked at him as he made his way over to them.
Tom smiled and left the room, only just hearing the soft, “I forgive you,” that followed him through the door.
“Itchy?” Luna supplied. “I understand. None of us like being away from our Pack mates. Just remember that they will signal us when they are on their way up from Hogsmeade.”
Concentrating on the movement of his hands, Tobias didn’t notice as the magic in the room increased. After a few moments a delicate flame appeared along the seam of his joint hands. Releasing the flame, it split into three and one of the flame balls flew to each adult to surround them. When the flames disappeared so too did the built up magic. Draco gazed in amazement at his now perfectly presentable parents. When the adults glared at him, Tobias snorted in amusement.
George turned pale green as he realised something. “I’m going to need to eat like him!”
“Let us complete this assignment.”
The entire goblin horde turned to look at the three Patils that were in the room.
“Thank you, Lucius. You may rise.” Lucius stood, bowed and returned to his place at his Lord’s side. Once Lucius was in his rightfully place, The Pack of fifteen stepped forward and bowed as one. Tobias smirked internally. His pack had been trained well by the dream drifters.
Amelia sighed and rested her head on her folded arms in exhaustion. It was the morning of the second day after the death of Miss Granger and already it had been a long day and it was about to get longer still.
Minerva nodded her head once and strode to the entrance of the sectioned off space she was in.
“Come now my young Lords,” he said cheerfully, “We have a new life to welcome into the world!”
“I am NOT going to Pomphrey!” Tobias yelled at that pronouncement. “I do not like, nor trust her.”
Draco smirked and removed his shaft from the tight canal, leaving only the head inside the ring of muscle. Moving his hands to his husband’s shoulders, he thrust back into the warm, welcoming depths. He pulled out and had almost completed his second re-entry by the time Tobias screamed with the pulse of pleasure he had received when his prostate was hit head on with the force of a battering ram.
“Aunt Edith would have been happy, had she lived,” Amelia managed to say.
“You aren’t wearing the ring I bought you.”
Tobias broke down, crying harder than he’d ever done in his life. “I tried everything to get them to stop, even going as far as promising to take his place and do so without any trouble or freakishness if they stop and leave him alone, but they just laugh and hurt him more. I can’t stop them from hurting him and it keeps on going until one night on of Vernon’s customers pulls a knife out and starts blood games. H-He cuts in t-too deep and I watch him bleed to death, on my bed while someone who doesn’t love him fucks him.”
“That,” Severus said with a smirk, “Is why I’ve had Argus and the House elves transfer his oldest three double filing cabinets to the spare room attached to my office and Minerva has several decades’ worth of Journals in her office for him to go through for useful spells, potions, runic and arith manic equations and rituals.”
Tobias opened his eyes with a pained groan. “Can you call me something other than that please? My name is Tobias. If you cannot handle that, Neogennito, Skotadi or Alpha will be acceptable. What can I call you? ‘Hogwarts’ seems so … plebeian.” Draco snorted.
Looking up, Severus saw his godson, Draco, blinking at him in poorly contained surprise.
Achalendra – The immovable, the Himalayas
Luna watched in fascination as the flesh on Ron’s back froze to the cold metal before being ruthlessly torn away from it due to Ronald’s wild thrashing. “I really must experiment more with this ‘dry ice’ substance,” she purred gleefully as Ron fainted for the overload of pain.
“He, Beta and Professor Snape are in a separate room as none of them wish to talk to anyone here,” Pansy stated boredly. “We are here representing them until such time they desire to see or talk to you.”
“There now, Nonos. That wasn’t so bad now, was it?” Severus just growled at him and left the room, highly embarrassed.
The twins nodded and the five Weasleys who had been named stood and floo’d to the shop. Severus said his farewells, his amusement poorly contained to those who knew him, and left. Before he stepped into the fireplace Harry turned to look at the dumbstruck order.
“We would never keep Padma from you, Lord Patil,” Tobias stated firmly. “You are her family and it is not our place to disturb that bond, but some things are important enough to keep from even family. I do not expect either Padma or George to tell us Patil family secrets so I expect the same level of discretion on her part when it comes to ours.”
“WHAT IN BLAZES IS HE DOING HERE!” he yelled, before collapsing.
“That about sums it up yes,” Algernon said. “Now, other cravings may form. These are things like a particular sound, feel, smell or environment. There may also be times where he craves company and times he craves solitude. If he has a solitary moment, the only person who will be able to get close to him without him blowing up is Draco. I also suggest watching him for feline and canine traits as the pregnancy progresses – and I think we should get the two of them to school before that progresses too far.”
“I apologise for the journey Amelia,” Lucius stated as he looked around as though searching for something. “Normally Tobias would be with Minerva or Severus in their rooms, however he decided to hold this meeting down in his territory.” A soft ‘Ah’ of discovery made her jump and Lucius to chuckle. “I apologise for not taking you to them the usual way since it is Pack only, so this is the only way to them at this point in time.” He looked at the small snake that was etched into the stone before him and grimaced.
Algie’s smile broadened. “A very strong bonding indeed. After that week, the carrier’s body must change in order for it to support another life. Unlike the potion pregnancies, natural male pregnancies do not have the added benefit of time to prepare for the burden it contains so the body reacts violently. The carrier’s hormones go into overdrive and he gets mood swings from the first month. At the same time his insides are moving around to make room for his newest organs. All that extra movement in there would be uncomfortable for anyone and, while a carrier cannot feel it as a were-creature would on a full moon, the sensation is enough to turn his stomach – hence the sickness.
Everyone in the hall inhaled sharply when a ball of green flame flew at the person at the front of the small group, only to land on her shoulder. “This lovely creature bought us here youngsters,” she said, running her fingers softly over the fire-bird’s breast feathers. “I think he wished for us to be here for something.”
Tobias smiled at the girl. “Thank you for explaining it to me Arketa.”
Something flew past him to land on Harry’s chest. Severus swore when he noticed that it was the headmaster’s phoenix, Fawkes.  As the next wave of magic engulfed Harry, Fawkes absorbed it, triggering his burn mechanism. Before anyone could react, both the phoenix and Harry disappeared in flame.
Tobias yawned in boredom as he made notes on the reports his Father’s followers were making. It was times like this he pitied his father. He didn’t know how he would survive being surrounded by idiots all the time. He jumped slightly at the hand on his shoulder and blinked up at his husband.
Watching the couple, Minerva was astounded by the connection the two boys had formed just by locking eyes, but if she was fully honest with herself, she shouldn’t have been. They’d always had a strong reaction to the other since they’d been at school, and now, she couldn’t wait to see what these two could do now that they were together.
“Think of making a sweet,”
“Master Tobias can have this today instead of food,” the elf squeaked, ‘but you must eat what you get for dinner.”
Draco took two steps and gathered the tear teen in his arms. “No Sweetheart no. Don’t every think that,” he whispered. “I will give you as many pups as you want. I just thought that you would have the same outlook as most other pure-bloods have on children. I didn’t dare hope that you would want more than one.”
He turned to Severus. “Did it ever occur to you that I didn’t know how to close my mind? Hell! At this point in time I would have turned my wand on my own parents if I could.  If it had been any other time during my life I would have been able to keep you out, but the old man just HAD to wait until my defences were already at an all-time low.”
“Goodnight Tobias.”
“She made them think that she was courting him.”
“Agreed,” everyone chorused, watching in silence as Blaise repeated the same process as Luna to obtain the two rolls of parchment.
Once more Tobias and Draco exchanged looks. “If you wish to bond to The Pack in the event of your disownment then we will respect your decision.”
Tobias’ eyes lit up with excitement. “We’re going shopping in India? Great!”
“Draco here has explained what he wants me to do, so now you’re awake, we can begin.”
Severus laughed. “I have the first thru third year tests here, if you’d like to start on them.”
“And how can I help you Miss …?”
Mr Patterson shifted nervously from one foot to the other. “Do you trust the accused, even though it is rumoured he is a Deatheater?”
Blaise stood and confidently walked to his Alpha. “Yes Alpha?”
~FLASHBACK~
“The only male who has ever treated me better is Father,” she admitted. She looked up and saw a waiter walking towards the table she was standing at. “We’ll talk to you another time,” she said, grabbing Tobias’ unknown female. “It was lovely seeing you so happy Tobias.”
Tobias nodded and sat in a seat that was nearby. He waited till his pack were comfortable then started his explanations.
Tobias smiled and curled gracefully next to his husband, nuzzling into him. “Love you Drakontas.”
“That is what he said, amongst other things,” Neville stated with a polite smile, trying not to laugh. He had found that he had quite the sadistic sense of humour since starting his sibling ship with Luna.
“Do you mind an extra mouth or two?” Minerva asked. “It would be lovely to go to the village and not need to supervise.”
Breakfast in the Great Hall was underway when the seven officials walked into the room, bringing instant silence with them. Every eye in the room watched them as they made their way to the teacher’s Dias and turned. The lady in the centre moved forward a step and addressed the student body, making sure to remember to look at all four tables at various times while talking.
Everyone waiting outside the room winced when yet another scream tore through the air. It had been nearly two hours since they had received word of their Alpha’s labour and not one of them had moved from the area outside the infirmary room where Tobias was being kept. It surprised no-one when, an hour in, Draco had been forced from the room.
“WHAT! I thought we agreed not to tell him!”
I know you don’t like me, and have no reason to trust or believe me, but I have some things I need to tell you and I can’t risk writing them down.  I also need you to GET ME OUT OF HERE or there will be three muggles dead by my hand, and I will make Voldemort look like a schoolyard bully in comparison.
Draco caught Severus’ eye and performed a reverse legilimens, putting the memory of that morning into his mind. When it got to when Draco opened his eyes to see the rose, Severus’ eyes widened. At Draco’s slow nod, Severus fainted. Draco cast an enervate on his professor just as someone knocked on the door. Draco opened it while Severus shakily stood. Both their jaws dropped at the sight before them.
Remus walked back into the room with a set of wizarding robes, shirt, pants and boxers for Harry.
“And how does the wizarding world’s hero-turned-minister plan on spending his holiday?” one reporter asked.
“What’s up love?”” Draco asked softly.
Severus paled as Remus walked into the room after Draco.
Both girls had blossomed into wonderful women, and he had noticed that both of them had caught the attention of a young male of The Pack. He smirked internally as he mentally planned out a letter and report to his father. If he had his way, his four females would be married and mated by this time next year – and the remaining males well on the way to obtaining a match.
Tobias nodded. “Um … Sev? Would it be okay if I had that yoghurt stuff for breakfast today? Please?”
“Pissed off at the amount of work Albus has left for him to clean up,” he answered, covering a yawn, “And tired.”
Luna smiled widely when a sparkle on his wrist caught her eye.
Everyone in the Pack froze when the first of their members was called to the front. With the assurance that every eye from The Pack was encouraging her, Millicent confidently strode to the dais, ignoring all the gaging and bad mouthing that was going on behind her about her muscular physique.
“Professor Snape, can we talk in your chambers?” he asked as politely as he could through clenched teeth.
“What did he say?”
The three elves blushed and vanished with a click of their fingers, vanishing the empty mugs at the same time.
Neville looked up from the person he was talking to and locked his eyes on the Minister and smirked.
“Just … well … take this time to be you. Surround yourself with female things: Experiment with hair styles and makeup; Giggle about the stupidity of us males; Tell stories, sing loudly, pig out on pastries and dips and biscuits and chocolate and …” Tobias looked down at his stomach as it rumbled and blinked, making everyone around him laugh. He coughed, more than a little embarrassed, and looked to one side.
Draco smiled ruefully at Harry. “I also apologise for how I treated you over the past few years. Friends?” He held out his hand. Harry grasped it firmly.
“Why do you want Algie here for lunch?” Tobias asked.
Severus gave a tired grin. “I lost count after the three hundred and ninety-fifth time and I’m not entirely sure that number was entirely correct to begin with. It is surprisingly difficult to keep track of numbers while in pain.”
The room was silent bar the sound of quill on parchment and the shuffling and murmuring of their professor. After listening to Severus complain under his breath, Tobias raised an arm, as if wishing to ask a question. The professor heaved an internal sigh of relief. He needed to stay busy so he didn’t get so impatient. Walking towards his two godsons, he fingered the box he had hidden in his pocket.
Remus blinked as the blonde walked off, muttering about idiot wolves that refused to be dominant. “I’d better go talk to Sev …” he trailed off and ran after the young Malfoy heir.
“Sorry Bi, he just makes it so easy!” Draco replied in the same humorous tone, “but you are right, my Dear, this is more important.”
Everyone in the Hall either laughed or awed when Draco removed the bundle of papers from Tobias and ordered him to sit and finish eating before taking his double load from the Hall.
Severus sat at the head table with a sigh. Not only had he needed to deal with the school’s medi-witch, but also the fact that Tobias had run to throw up as soon as he’d smelt the nurse’s breakfast.
Remus Lupin – Lykos [Wolf]
Narcissa laughed and kissed her husband hungrily, forcing his mind to other – more enjoyable – things. After all, if a mystery is solved, it is no longer a mystery, and Narcissa felt that the mystery that was her soon to be son-in-law shouldn’t be unravelled by any bar her son. She also knew that Draco wouldn’t let on that secret, even if he were asked directly while under Veritaserum.
“Oh stop being such a baby about it, Drakontas,” Tobias laughed. “I happen to like paperwork. It’s the best thing to do when you want information. No one expects the Clerk or Secretary to know, see or understand anything that’s going on and they don’t expect for you to be able to listen and write at the same time.”
Tobias pouted. “But what if I want something different?”
The longer Tobias spoke, the more relaxed the man became.
Hermione is a bad little Gixie. She needs to be punished
***End Flashback***
Hermione sat at her desk, looking at the book before her while trying to keep her hands from shaking. All throughout the day her memories would surface. First it had been just the memories of talks with the Headmaster which she learned to accept or ignore, but then the memories started to alternate between the pride her parents had of her, followed by their disappointment in her actions and their last words to her before she left after Christmas.
Tobias inhaled sharply and held it. All that his short-circuited mind could process were the words, “OH Gods’ that were playing over and over in his mind, and the sensation caused when his husband’s tongue swiped across his flesh – but not yet penetrating. Gasping slightly, Tobias tried to move onto the inviting tongue, only to whimper as his plan failed.
Ginny laughed at the shocked faces of her four family members she was proud of. All four of them looked as if they’d walked through a long line of ghosts.
Neville, Ginny and Blaise stretched. “The three of us have Herbology and I have arithmancy,” Blaise answered.
“I was with them because they still don’t trust me in their store alone,” Padma said with a wry grin. “It wasn’t my fault that neither of them told me not to use a cheering charm in the store.”
Draco blinked stupidly at the redhead, so it was his father who answered.
“SILENCE!” a male voice boomed, making everyone freeze in place before they turned their attention to the group of Ministry Officials that had congregated before them.
“I present to you Messer’s Fred, George, Bill, Charlie and Miss Ginevra Weasley.” As each of their names was called, they bowed or curtseyed to the man seated before them. “Friends, this is my adopted father, Tom Marvolo Riddle. I am no longer Harry James Potter. On September the first, I am legally going to be Tobias Regulas Riddle. I shall be going under the name of Black while I still attend Hogwarts or until Dumbledore, Granger and Weaselby are destroyed – whichever comes first.”
Both men were aware that they had the full attention of the class on them. Fighting the urge to drown himself in the potion, Tobias raised the goblet to his lips. Once the taste of it hit his tongue, Tobias lost all control and guzzled it down, red streaks of liquid running out the sides of his mouth and down his throat. This is what he needed more than anything.
“Harry James Potter! Where do you think you are going! You sit yourself back on that seat right now or else!”
Tobias stepped back and rubbed his whole body across Draco’s front, instantly calming the blonde who immediately wrapped his arms protectively around his husband’s waist, hands flared across the slight bulge that could be felt but not seen.
“Have you come to an agreement?” the oldest goblin asked.
Later that night the adults were all awakened by a large pulse of magic tearing through the house, followed closely by a scream of pain.
Blaise turned a brilliant red colour, blushing through his olive skin. He bowed stiffly. “Forgive me, Alpha.”
“Suppose the man should fall asleep,
“I want to know several things, and I want to know them NOW! Firstly – am I going to be told what the fires in hell is going on, or am I going to be left in the dark still?” he waited.
“I will be honoured to prepare the room for tonight Sister dear. Do you have any special requirements?”
Minerva frowned at the normally intelligent girl. “It seems your Master wishes for you to report on Albus to get him out of the school.”
“Please,” Draco begged as he gently rocked in place, his voice sounding brittle and desperate from all the sounds he had been making all night. “Please, please, please.”
“An election, just.”
“I love you too, Tobias.”
Tom sighed. “Lupin. I do not know if they are alright or not, but I do know that they will come to no lasting harm where they are. No mortal knows what they will have to go through tonight, so we do not know whether it will hurt them or not. There is nothing we can do if they aren’t, so we have to put our faith in the boys.”
“Father. If no one can find Tobias or I tomorrow, would you be able to tell them that we are alright? We are going for a picnic in the gardens.”
Seeing their Alpha sleeping peacefully, Pansy and Vince half snuggled into him protectively as Theodore covered him with a light blanket. All around them the inhabitants for the common room quietened so as to not wake the young Lord.
Ginny nodded with a grin. Rather than feel left out by having nothing she was in charge of, she was ecstatic. She was the only drifter in the group – a Jack-of-all-trades, if you will – and that made her a very important member of The Pack. Taking her parchment, she giggled giddily before twirling back into her place beside a swaying Luna. Everyone in the group smiled indulgently at the two of them.
“Support if Romania is ever in the same position as Britain is and a handful of Dementors for their worst prion.”
“Well that isn’t really our fault,” Fred pointed out as he threw his arm over his brother’s shoulders. “It was either a centaur or a Hag and we couldn’t do that to the poor Hags, not after they were so helpful this past week.”
Severus stepped out of the floo and into his sitting room, where he collapsed with his head in his hands.
~Flashback~
Tobias kissed the top of his head, whispering, “thank you dikos mou Drakontas. I needed that. What was the school’s reaction to your new look?” He asked, indicating the red and gold silk he was resting his cheek on.
“Yes Alpha,” everyone chorused in amusement before obediently settling down once again.
The first of September found a concerned bunch of Slytherins waiting on Platform 9 ¾. An anxious Narcissa waited nearby. Thirty minutes before the train was due to depart, a red tide seemed to appear out of nowhere. Draco heaved an internal sigh of relief at the spot of black he spotted amongst them.
Tobias laughed, “No I don’t think you are fluent in that yet. What I meant was ‘it makes me happy when I see my family in relationships that make them as happy as I am with Draco.”
Tom nodded in acceptance. “I’m going to go talk to Fudge about getting The Pack to sit their N.E.W.Ts. I am also going to head off any snooping the old Fool will most assuredly do when my son re-joins the world.” He smirked. “Let’s see him try and get rid of THIS child before anyone but the parents know of it.”
“Both sides are decided on starting from scratch,” Tobias answered. He held out a scroll that the elderly goblin retrieved. “All bar the last point have been agreed upon.”
“You have been judged and found to be unworthy,” she began in her oddly hypnotic voice. “The one to decide your fate has called for your life – and we of The Pack agree with his choice – but we want to take our payment from your hide. Rest assured, Ronald Bilius Weasley, Your final days are upon us – and what a glorious celebration your death will cause.”
“For an intelligent bloke you are incredibly stupid,” they said together.
She had also made a necklace, earrings and two watches in the same pattern. If her chosen mate agreed to her courting request, then he would be obtaining the masculine watch as well. If not, then the cufflinks would return to her.
“Give them to me.”
“Alright there Kyria?” he asked, stopping beside her.
“That’s it,” Charlie said.
The man then left. Lucius rose to leave as well.
Severus caught Remus’ eye and smirked. The group looked around in wonder at the room, all feeling more comfortable here than anywhere else in the castle.
They were interrupted by a loud crack and the appearance of a large table full of scones, sandwiches and pots of tea. In one spot sat the drink Tobias had requested and a bowl of steamed fish, rice and vegetables. Tobias’ face lit up when he saw a plate that contained a small pile of pickled ginger, a small amount of chilli paste and – to the disgust of many – a red and brown mix with small green bits in it.
“How is he?” Filius asked as he sat and started to fill his plate.
“Remember, we aren’t expected to have the worksheets completed,” Draco stated as he watched Tobias closely. “I think as long as the Professors see that we made an attempt, that they will be happy.”
The Pack exchanged grins, knowing that all of them - aside from Tobias – had already started on a worksheet of their choice. Today they were planning on working on more of the worksheets while Tobias did whatever it was that he wanted. The coughed to hide their laughter when a familiar voice was heard to say:
She turned to the Pack and in a clear voice announced, “Members of The Pack it is time to celebrate! Your newest member, a cub, has been born and named. Welcome Melody Rue Malfoy-Riddle to your ranks.”
“Just what is the meaning of this Minerva? We have a staff meeting in two hours, so what is so important it couldn’t wait till then? And where is Albus?”
Tobias shook his head slightly to clear it of its lustful fog. “S-sitting on the moss.”
Deloris let out a scream of pain when a long and very sharp piece of wood embedded itself into the fleshy part of her shoulder and spines appeared on it.
“London Bridge is falling down,
Draco neatly folded his napkin and placed it on his plate. Standing, he offered his arm to his husband. Guiding him to a clear section of the room, he drew the dark-haired man into his arms just as soft instrumental music began.
Hermione raised tear-heavy eyes to her Head of House. “I can’t read it, Professor,” she sobbed. “I can see the words on the page but when I touch the book, the writing vanishes.”
“You’ll see my dear, you’ll see. Now, let’s all go back to sleep,” he yawned, “I have a big day tomorrow, as do some of you.”
“That would be me,” a voice called from the doorway.
At his father’s nod of permission, the newly named boy disappeared in a blue flame. One of the Slytherins whimpered.
Helga bounced on the spot. She approved of this polite young man and the loyalty he had in the group surrounding him. It would be so good to have youngsters in their rooms once more. If anything they would be an interesting bunch to talk to.
“I believe you mean Misters Malfoy-Black and Mr Longbottom,” she reminded him with a raised eyebrow like she always did when he refused to honour the boy’s bonding. “And I really must get my memory checked if I’m forgetting about students wagging school. I’ll tell them about their detention before I eat.”
Lucius and Severus were seated in Lucius’ study nursing a glass of scotch each, both deep in thought.
Next announcement was from Remus and Severus who had decided that a full bonding was unnecessary and so had done the were-version of eloping. As neither man was young nor healthy, they provided no cubs for The Pack’s continuation, but they doted on each and every little miracle that came along.
Tobias kissed Draco’s fingers once more before smiling at him so sweetly it made Severus’ teeth ache. “The gods and I agree that you are worthy.” Tobias stepped forwards and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead. “I hope the gift is to your satisfaction, beloved.”
“The boy’s room is this way. If they are asleep then it might be best to do it without waking them.” The three adults stopped at a large set of open doors. Before them, curled together in a way only comfortable for couples who adore each other, were the two boys. Mrs Greengrass smiled softly on the scene before raising her wand and casting several spells on both boys. When she had finished, she indicated for the two men to go back to the main room. They didn’t notice that Salazar followed them out.
The assignments are then given to Tobias, who files them away. The original goes to the teacher. When it is marked, the assignment goes back to Tobias who files it with the unmarked copy for easy access on the weekends, where they are gone through and discussed while they are re-written, with the Professor’s comments taken into account. This happens with every assignment – whether they do the subject or not – as well as every homework item set. All of them do better on the seventh year potion’s syllabus them my seventh years. I talked the others into testing them, and all of them passed higher – on average – then the seventh years who did it at the end of last year.”
As the ceremony faded, Harry stepped forward and laid a hand on Remus’ shoulder. When he pulled it away, he sucked the blood off one of his fingers. His eyebrows rose.
“Congratulations,” the man smiled. “You are one of our youngest graduates. You passed everything you sat. A copy of your results and your certificate will be posted to you.”
“How dare you,” Tobias spat as he flicked his wand enraged, ignoring how his Pack fell into formation around him. The figure moved and Tobias threw the flame at the man, not reacting as it stretched and solidified into a whip of shadow and flame that the man had to dodge.
Tobias was sitting on the windowsill at the top of the owlery with Hedwig on his knee, talking softly to her when he felt a presence around him. Looking around, he found a group of students from mixed houses and years had surrounded him. His magical guardian instantly took an interest in proceedings.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed, rolling over to snuggle into his husband’s back, “what has you up at this ungodly hour of.” He flicked his wand and squinted at the glowing numbers floating above their heads, “six fifteen in the morning?”
“I will be submitting my memories of that day,” Lucius stated, “as are Randal, Remus Lupin and my wife. I have no doubt that Severus will as well.”
“Calling a phoenix ‘death’. Seems like a vast play on words – a pun, I believe the muggle term is.”
Gaia sent Draco a half-smile, revealing that she knew what he was thinking. Nodding once, she turned and walked away from the eating area, knowing the two boys would follow her.
Dobby looked at Tobias with large eyes. “Sir wants Dobby as his elf?”
“Now that we have your blood and a few other things from you, we can get to registering you within our Department of the Regulation of Magical Creatures. Name: Deloris,” Lucius stated, filling out an official looking form. “Species: Centaur. Sex: Female?” he looked questioningly towards his son who nodded as he retrieved something.
“You are dismissed,” Amelia said to the Healer. “Tell your boss to come see me immediately. If you do not, I will have you up on negligence charges before you can apparate. Do I make myself clear?
Tobias’ eyes changed to chips of emerald. “And I cannot believe that the head of Slytherin house acts more like a Gryffindor first year.
“We’re ready for it, Bi. We’ve studied with all of you really hard this year and we have done our best. We should probably get all of our stuff ready for tomorrow – as well as an early night so that we are ready for the day ahead,” Luna offered.
My Fair Lady.”
The door opened to reveal a slightly nervous Severus, who bowed slightly.
“How dare …”
“Okay Pack, you heard the man- into Alpha and Beta’s rooms!” Neville called and all members of The Pack left the ballroom, followed closely by Remus, Severus, Narcissa, Lucius, Minerva and Madam Longbottom.
-Timey Whimey stuffs-
“Well,” Rowena smiled. “You could always ask kitten – she is still here, remember.”
For the first time in his life, Godric thought before he responded. Looking into the youth’s eyes, he saw intelligence and power. He also knew that the only way Raithia would let anyone in was through a willingly given sacrifice of their own blood. He would have to answer all their questions, but he had a feeling that he would have no problem in giving his approval to the youngster.
Greg stepped forward and picked Tobias up. Draco bid everyone goodnight and followed his friend for the room. Severus smiled slightly from his corner in the Slytherin Common room. Slowly he walked from the room and into the floo. He had gotten a slight problem when Tobias had initiated that kiss with Draco – Now he hoped that he could find his wolf to help him with said problem. It didn’t help that he hadn’t seen him since their return just over a week ago.
Draco nodded and pat Tobias’ shoulder in understanding before he left. Tobias sighed and relaxed, letting the potion do its work before he left to return to his belongings.
* * *
“They did do the work. I’m just collating the information so it is easier for everyone to read and report. I can’t expect Neville – who is reporting on the students in the school – to be able to report on his topic when he has the information on Gryffindor, Ginny has the information on Hufflepuff, Luna for Ravenclaw and Theo for Slytherin. I’m just putting all the stuff for each individual report together. It will also make it easier for Pateras to read after the meeting.”
Stepping inside, he allowed the branches to close behind him. Looking around, he eyes fell on his husband and he fought to breath. He walked, mesmerized, as the Adonis before him opened his eyes and his lips parted slightly.
“Homework due next lesson, I want the first two chapters read and summarised. I also want a two and a half foot essay on nutrient potions and why they are not studied before this year, even though they are easy enough for a competent fourth year to make. Now get to your next class!”
It was time. This weekend his pack would be taking their rightful place in the Death Eater circle.
Tobias slowly put a hand on Draco’s hair, running his fingers through it. “Calm down, Drakontas. It isn’t your fault. None of this is your fault. Anyone would fight me doing this and of all the people I did this with, you fought me the least. I love you so much Draco. Please look at me.”
“Draco?” he heard called through the bathroom door.
“If either of you wish my life, you can have it,” he said, sapphire flames linking the three of them in an unbreakable.
Ron was ashamed to admit that he was screaming like a baby. Not only did he have spiders all over him, but he was bruised and battered and absolutely terrified. He was convinced that the voices were out to kill him. “Stop!” he wept. “Please stop, I can’t take much more.”
Draco sighed, and then decided against restraining the two girls. How he had managed to stand and leave the Snake Pit with no one the wiser, he had no idea – but he was thankful for small miracles.
“Bi, please calm down. Think of the baby – our baby,” Draco pleaded.
“That’s an understatement,” a shaky voice stated.
“But …”
Tom, Lucius and Severus seated themselves with Tobias curled into a ball at Tom’s side. “You seem to be doing a really good job of everything here, so I was hoping that you will be able to help me with some of my grading. I have to have the surprise tests marked and the assignments I requested for before the holidays marked and graded for the first day back. I was hoping you’d do the marking of the tests and the first, and maybe second year assignments.”
“Oh yes,” Luna said happily. “I was just making new friends.” The younger girl smiled up at Neville and put the jar into her bag. “Do you mind preparing the Room for me while I go get someone else who I think would love to help with tonight?”
With that, both Daemon left, leaving two quiet boys. Silently they set up their belongings the way they desired them then they collapsed – gracefully – onto the armchairs before the fire grate.
Ron sat on his bed and fumed. Not only had he had to put up with his ex-best friend for the past three months, but the girl he wanted to marry refused to see him over the holidays. It’s a pity that the Headmaster wouldn’t let him use the potion on her yet. He had to wait for after graduation to administer it to her. Oh well, he’d get her in the end he just wanted her NOW!
“What are you doing up Love?” Draco asked softly as he moved to stand so the obviously exhausted teen could lean on him.
The next morning the students and teachers of Hogwarts were greeted by the sight of an exhausted Tobias and Draco. Severus smirked knowingly at the two of them causing them to flush slightly. Breakfast was going smoothly until the doors of the Great Hall opened to reveal two hard-faced Aurors.
Theo and Pansy exchanged amused looks before moving until they were at a respectful distance from the loved-up couple.
“Hi,” Tobias whispered back, holding out a shaky hand.
“Which contract?” he asked.
Salazar smiled. “You’ve got a lot on your mind – so don’t worry about it. Kitten , show them that day, please.”
Severus glared at his godson. “To say that I am disappointed in you, Draco is an understatement. You wanting to cheapen the relationship you have with Tobias with a quick tumble before being bonded to him is something I thought was beneath you. To put his life in danger because of it is pathetic. You are lucky Neogennito loves you more than life, because if he didn’t, I would kill you now just to get him out of the contract binding him to you. So help me Merlin if I lie.” Sev looked down his nose scornfully at Draco.
“Did you think to take into consideration the jealousy that that boy has shown on several occasions towards the poor boy?” Hermione bowed her head in shame. Her mother steepled her fingers and pressed them against her lips in thought. “There is only one thing for you to do about this, Hermione,” she said after a few moments. “When it comes to your punishment, you will not argue and you will undergo it without a sound – even if your punishment is your death.”
“I’ll stay with him while you return to the meeting. Someone needs to be there to put forward what the two of you wish for.”
“IT’S ALL YOUR FALULT!” she screamed. “I apologised, so why didn’t you forgive me? You’ve turned my life into a mockery!”
“Two hours,” Severus smiled. “He convinced me to read Remus’ letter, then finished going through the file he was working on. He finished it fifteen minutes ago and decided to catch a nap before going out to spend time with you all.”
“There is something wrong with that elf,” Lucius muttered a look of disturbia on his face.
“Just the letter from Remus,” he sighed, running his hand gently through the hair of the teen whose head was on his lap. “He’s apologised for his treatment of the past three weeks towards me. He doesn’t want me to reply to the letter due to something he wants to talk about face to face. The only thing I’m sure of is that our relationship has changed and I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not.”
“Shh, Bi. Tell me about these dreams and I’ll see if I can help with them. It might help to just talk about them.”
“You are lucky, Rodent. You are so lucky Pateras has my sworn word that I will not harm you without permission from him. If he did not, you would be so dead right now.”
“Neogennito. It has been requested that in a quarter mark of the candle for you and young Mister Malfoy to join us in the family room. That is also when everyone else – bare the Weasleys – will be returning to their homes with their families. The Weasleys are welcome to spend the weekend with us. Please enjoy the time you have left. A house-elf will be here to show you the way when your time is up.
“Good. If you don’t rest your bones now, then they will be under more stress later in the pregnancy, there is even the possibility that they could break or fracture.”
Luna just shrugged with everyone else as she wrote the last two words on her note to the twins before sealing and sending it.
Arketa - pretty
Tobias hugged the man as best he could without disturbing his daughter. “Love you Pateras,” he whispered. “I’ll talk to Dobby about coming with us.”
“Katara and Hemerotes, I must say that it is good to see the two of you here.”
Remus whined.
“We haven’t finished here,” the Healer snapped once she had shaken off her shock. “The results were only for one of you.”
Tobias thought for a moment before answering. “Sometimes I can. It depends on what the reason is.”
“How’d she do that?” Millicent asked
Severus and Filius winced. “What was he thinking? Why did they call Minerva?”
Harry beamed. “The Dursleys?” At Remus’ nod, Harry crowed with delight. “I never have to be forced there again!” A thought hit him and he looked at Remus. “Why? It isn’t like you to lose your temper that badly.”
“Sev! It worked! He’s still asleep. Isn’t that wonderful?”
Tobias half-smiled and he changed into his wolf. Sev Smirked. “Do you think you will be able to keep the wolf as your guardian until your bonding day?”
“Plimpy, smoked oyster and mustard leaf soup,” The Pack chorused.
“Is it harmful?”
Tobias melted into Draco’s arms, hiding his face in the crook of his neck. The Professors and The Pack smiled at the counter. It was evident – to all who wished to look – that they adored each other. The watched as the two conversed in whispers and soft touches, before Draco gently guided his husband to the Slytherin Table.
“I believe milord will be interested in starting this meeting. I suggest that everyone should get to their places,” Lucius said calmly, not allowing his anger at the idiot in their midst show itself.
husband decided to do a runner with your child.” A flash of blue appeared in the Imposter’s eye, causing an idea to form.
Luna looked at Blaise with her head tilted to the right, innocence plastered all over her face. “What innocent look?”
Tom smirked. “Of course you wouldn’t have. My personal healer has been attending him. Well, since I am here I may as well make an announcement. Anyone who threatens my son will be on the receiving end of my wand. It has been confirmed that he is with child. I’M GOING TO BE A GRANDPAPPY!”
It wasn’t until the white wolf began to change that Amelia began to move as fast as she could, somehow knowing instinctually that this would be the end, one way or another.
Harry rose slowly and caught Draco’s eye. He was standing to one side with the other Deatheater children. Harry smirked, making Draco smirk in reply.  Slowly Harry raised his arms and, bowing his head with one last smirk, he removed the hood. Just as slowly as he raised his arms, he re-lowered them and raised his head. He locked eyes with Bellatrix.
Neville had finally gathered his courage and asked for Millicent’s hand in bonded bliss five years after graduating. The robustly-built female had blinked at the younger man the shy Gryffindor had become and nodded after several moments. It had seemed that Millicent had come to terms with the fact that no-one would be interested in her at a young age and the thought that an attractive young man would voluntarily ask for her to spend the rest of her life with him had caused her to momentarily panic once her shock had passed and had resulted in Neville spending the first hour of their relationship in Algernon’s care as the older Longbottom tired containing his laughter long enough to fix his nephew’s broken jaw.
Blaise opened his eyes and looked into the tear-filled ones below him. “This is goodbye,” he said with a large grin. “Believe me when I say you will not be missed.”
“We had a broken loyalty spell on us,” Fred hurriedly explained when he saw Tobias’ eyes narrow in warning. “We also had an unknown potion in our system.”
“What happened to make you choose this, Minerva?”
He gave a tiny half-smile. “I’ve even had a large black dog and various were-creatures. In fact, I think the only creature I haven’t yet had as a guardian is a lion. “When I suppress my need to do magic, or when I don’t use magic for a long time, I start to act like any one of the guardians.”
Blaise nodded and moved smoothly into the outer circle as Ginny moved to their Alpha’s side.
“How did the two of you get the information about Deloris?” Minerva asked straight out.
Vincent and Luna had, in the end, given The Pack two cubs: a set of twins who had their mother’s mind, their father’s dependability and both of their loyalty.
Tobias was seated on the floor in the Slytherin common room with Draco running his fingers through his hair. Tobias almost purred in ecstasy.
“It was a load of crock!” He looked at Voldemort. “You did the old fucker’s work for him, in killing my parents. He wanted the two of them dead, so he planted everything.” Harry took a deep breath. “He then sent me off to bed and arranged a meeting with Ron and Hermione.  He told them both that I was unsafe to be around people – magical and otherwise – without some kind of control device, so they helped him create the manacles I was wearing at throat, wrist and ankle.  He then had Pomfrey douse me with Dreamless Sleep and put them on me while I was under.”
“Only what Gran’ther Sal, Gran’ther Ric, Gram’mere Helga and Gran’mere Ro have told us,” Tobias and Draco responded.
“Come LunaLove,” a voice echoed around a suddenly silent Great Hall.
“We shall forgive you on one condition,” Ginny stated.
“Nothing much,” most of them stated.
Tobias ignored him, focusing on attacking and defending himself as his Pack protected him and themselves from the present Death Eaters.
Tobias stretched; smiling at the slight twinge of muscles that hadn’t been used in a while gave after being put through a thorough and intense work out. ‘And what a workout it was,’ he thought with a grin, remembering his and Draco’s activities from the previous night.
Chapter 26
Amelia hummed in agreement as she slowly opened her eyes. She started in shock at the man standing before her with a grin on his face.
Suns of Death and Darkness
“What’s wrong Hunny?” he asked softly, turning Tobias’ head to look at him.
“And the good thing about having Dobby speak properly is that I don’t look like an idiot trying to prove that he is smart by surrounding himself with people stupider than he is.” With a slight bow to his Father and godparents and a nod at Neville, Tobias left the room.
“We have,” Tobias answered without hesitation, “The only problems that have come up will be handled in the new contract, but I am confident that it can be discussed and sorted in a way that both families and the couple are happy with.”
Tobias chuckled softly. “Ah, Booph, is that a blush?”
Tobias sneered at the ridiculous creature. “You are a magical creature and can travel to other areas with the same amount of effort as one would roll out of bed in the morning. Did it not occur to you to go to another country ... Fuck this, DOBBY!”
A black hand on his shoulder made him jump and tare his eyes from his beloveds behind.
Draco collapsed on the sofa, exhausted. For the past two hours he had slaved away in his and Tobias’ room. He had put silk sheets the colour of flax on the bed with a black and cream blanket over it. Everything in the room had been changed, the ceiling to a clear night sky – with Kitten’s permission, or course. He had everything planned – now all he had to do was hope Severus had completed his bit – and that Tobias liked what he had planned.
