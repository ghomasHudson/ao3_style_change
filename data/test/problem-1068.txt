“Nothing,” Harry grits out, watching Malfoy carefully for any signs. There should be something, an indicator that Harry’s instincts are not mistaken, but Malfoy looks perfectly at ease with a raised eyebrow, elegantly spread in his chair.
an Arse Man, when all is said and done,” she says, thoughtful, as she sits curled up in Blaise’s large, velvet armchair. They’re both nursing a glass of wine each and Draco has just finished telling her about the Department of Mysteries’ latest employee acquisition. Or rather, an impressive
“We can’t, Draco,” Harry says tiredly, speaking, even though his arm feels like it's about to fall off. “Can you Apparate us? At least a hundred miles, for now,” he asks, letting himself lean on the firm muscle of Draco’s shoulder. He doesn’t want to let him know that his warmth is welcome for some reason, he doesn’t want to huddle closer or face him, but Harry does it anyway and notices there’s a trickle of blood on Draco’s forehead. He fights the urge to wipe it off with his thumb.
“What the—” Harry starts, but sees Draco beckon him towards the large notice board by the reception desk. There’s a variety of small announcements and notices, reminders, and lost and found memos, some clearly from years ago, still stuck to the board with a Permanent Sticking Charm, the use of which is now prohibited by a metal plaque at the very top. A large notice is pinned over all the papers and parchments saying that the Ministry will be closed today, due to an unexpected malfunction of the Concealment Charms on several levels that need immediate maintenance under the risk of breaking the Statute of Secrecy.
. A week later, he had three interviews to conduct and no idea how to go about the whole business. Being a true Gryffindor at heart, Harry was nothing if not good at diving headfirst into things—he invited the candidates in, asked seemingly clever questions and watched how they interacted with the potions lab. The first one, a girl roughly his age, almost fell face-down over the threshold as soon as she saw him—and that was fair, Harry thought, wondering if he was being too lenient, or maybe too firm?—and it only got worse. After the poor woman broke the fourth beaker in ten minutes while trying to choke out the answers to his questions, Harry didn’t have the heart to keep her there any longer. An almost funny image of Neville in their Potions classes at Hogwarts flashed before his eyes as the girl stuttered her
“Yours,” Harry gasped, his whole body arching into the touch. He felt drunk, on pleasure, on love, on Draco.
His hand moves down and he hisses, dragging his palm down his shaft and cupping his balls, massaging them lightly until his cock bobs fully hard and flushed red. It’s been a while since he’s done this, and since Harry’s already crossed the ethical Rubicon of wanking over his charge, he intends to savour it. Just as he slowly, deliberately wraps his fingers around his cock, his thumb and index finger barely meeting, he hears a gasp. And then, another one, and another one, and more that follow, turning into a cascade of soft, rhythmic exhales that catch on Draco’s vocal cords like a false note on the finest violin.
Just as Harry thinks it can’t get any better, as he pushes eagerly into the wet heat, Draco opens his mouth around his hole and sucks, and then Harry’s vision goes black around the edges as he feels the tip of Draco’s tongue slip inside him. He bucks his hips, a broken sob escaping his mouth, and squeezes his eyes shut pushing back even harder. Draco eats him relentlessly, with a visceral hunger in every hot stab of tongue breaching the ring of muscle, panting and groaning, blunt fingernails digging into Harry’s arse. Draco’s virtually fucking him with his tongue and Harry takes it like he was made for it, begs for more with his hand clutched in Draco’s hair guiding him as deep as he can go, sobbing in ecstasy as his hole stretches around that impossible heat.
“I— I’m not sure, it just works for me,” Harry admits, feeling uneasy. He’s never done it to someone else, only himself, and hopes he won’t make it any worse.
Malfoy’s lips curve in satisfaction as Harry removes the wards with a tired sigh. It shouldn’t be surprising the slimy bastard is proficient in all things shady. Harry only wonders how much of the show they’re putting on is necessary and how much Malfoy is just enjoying himself. As Harry makes quick work of the spells, Malfoy keeps talking. “Honestly, I’d like to know at which point Starsky and Hutch over there got so confused? I thought I spoke my mind very clearly since you’re here. By the way, your security here is atrocious. I could be a maniac, looking to dismember their precious Saviour and they, quite literally, brought you to me. And left! Because I asked! Should have—”
!” Harry cries out as Draco wraps his lips around his nipple, teases it with quick, hard flicks of his tongue and Harry’s insides contract with the pleasure of it, the sensation going straight to his cock, now fully hard again.
They get a room—it’s nothing special but still looks nicer compared to the first hotel. Two beds, a clean ensuite bathroom, and the hotel even offers breakfasts which Draco immediately insists they pay extra for. Harry’s too tired to argue about public money with him right now so he also throws in a ridiculously overpriced bottle of whiskey, reasoning they might both need it. They stumble inside their room and Draco deposits him on the bed that’s furthest from the entrance, despite Harry’s weak protests, barking that it’s closer to the bathroom and adding that he’s not waking up to the sun in his eyes after the night he’s had.
“It’s the outskirts.” Draco shrugs. “I’m guessing years ago Muggles prefered to be discreet as well, yes?”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, reaching out, but stopping his hand in mid-air. “Turn around. It’s just me.”
He stomps over to the bar and in the corner of his eye, sees the bartender frown as the empty glasses lined up on a nearby shelf rattle, an ominous foretoken of the extent of his rage. Draco spots him when he’s halfway there and something flashes across his face, something bright and terrified as he places his palm flat against the man’s chest and gently pushes him away, maintaining a smooth, porcelain smile.
Draco looks defeated, miserable. When he finally speaks, he’s not looking at Harry but at his own hands fidgeting nervously in his lap. “Like leather,” he whispers croakily. “And broom polish, and ozone, and there’s a hint of cloves, and—” his voice hitches and he closes his eyes as if it would make him disappear.
There’s a challenge in his voice that Draco immediately picks up on, like a cat arching its back in warning, seconds before attacking with a vicious hiss. “I wonder,” he says in a low voice. “What is your goal here? What does the great Harry Potter, protector of the little ones, the saviour of all that is holy, get out of this?” he asks and takes another step so they’re face-to-face, speaking in a soft, breathy voice. “Well, Potter? What is it in the end? Sex or power?”
Harry stares. He never expected Malfoy to sacrifice his own skin and agree to once again get entangled in the gold-spun spiderwebs of the corrupt underbelly of the wizarding society. There’s also something in Mafoy’s face, or maybe his voice, a sliver of defeat cutting through the firm, clipped syllables and a determination that makes him look just a little more human than what he projected until now.
“Shit,” Harry breathes. “I know, yeah? Just one or two more and the first rib’s done,” he says quietly, and he doesn’t really know why he’s comforting Malfoy, but he’s resolved to see this through the end without making things worse.
The next morning, Harry’s sitting in that very same chair, looking a little pathetic according to at least two Healers who both begged him to go home and promised to give him a call. Throughout the night, he managed to find out that Draco’s stable, but on a fuck-ton of Blood-Replenishing Potions, slowly getting better. While he can understand small victories and all, Harry still isn’t allowed to see him, which has put a significant damper on his mood.
was good, but Harry was good at being told that he was and maybe he was getting a little desperate to actually act on it instead of settling on a flimsy ideal of what he could be. Draco wasn’t just playing hard to get, he was the hardest fucking person Harry had ever met while simultaneously thinking he didn’t deserve good things. Being next to Draco sometimes felt like being too close to the sun, like arguing with the wind, and Harry felt like a madman, trying to explain to the moon how its magnetism was keeping his tides alive.
Harry feels he’s getting closer with each lick, his cock wet, and red, and begging to be touched. He immediately whimpers at the loss of pressure when Draco leans back for a moment and hears a whispered spell. And then, there’s a lubed finger rubbing a slow, gentle circle over his hole. When Draco slips it in to the first knuckle, Harry lets out a hoarse moan, his legs going weak at the incredible burning pleasure, feeling himself stretch and adjust to the intrusion.
put your cock where it shouldn’t go.” She uncorks the wine and puts her wand aside. “You’re going to get yourself fired.”
They lay on top of the sheets, cooling down as the sweat of their fucking dried off their flushed skin, with Draco breathing in the smell of sandalwood, tender fingers gently probing and massaging at Harry’s fucked-out hole.
Harry watches Teddy rub up against Draco and whimper softly. It’s hard not to squeeze himself through his boxers as the boy eagerly rides his husband’s hand, moaning along to his movements, looking so sweet, and ruined, and so desperate to please.
“It?” Potter finally asked, watching Draco over a thirty-five piece Chamberlains Worcester tea set (hand-painted porcelain, 1790, a gorgeous piece Draco was more than a little nostalgic to part with), originally bought by Draco’s great-great-great-grandfather and charmed to keep the tea hot indefinitely. Now, however, the results… varied, to say the least, if the slight crease between Potter’s eyebrows was anything to go by. He sat at the other desk, the heavy, polished oak cluttered with an advanced reagent set to test whether the pot or the cups were the culprit; numerous Detection and Analysis Spells quietly chimed and glimmered around his head while he worked, unaware what a distraction he was being.
After the fifth time he had to help Freddie calm down and try and put him back to sleep, Harry thought he might burst out crying himself and lay down with the kid in a bout of solidarity. As if that wasn’t enough, Maggie seemed completely oblivious to the fact that it was her fault, trying to suggest Harry let the baby cry itself out and fall asleep, or check its nappy. But his nephew’s reaction was just a confirmation of the impression Harry already had—Maggie’s voice was too grating to keep the night going and Harry was racking his brain for a solution to the pickle he had found himself in. Finally, the opportunity presented itself, a wondrous gift, perhaps from Karma herself; his companion scrolled through her phone and, apologising profusely, informed him there was a family emergency and she needed to go see her grandmother right away.
Malfoy chuckles softly. “Auror Potter. Always asking the right questions. Getting to the bottom of things.”
The only sounds in the room are their mingled gasps and whimpers, and the filthy slap of flesh against flesh as Harry drives his hips forward in savage, unyielding thrusts. He holds Draco by the shoulders and fucks into him, watching, transfixed, as his cock disappears inside him, watches the lube and precome gathering around Draco’s hole, dripping down his balls and thighs. He’s a fucking force of nature, arching into Harry’s touch with his head thrown back, moaning with every ruthless push, his back damp with sweat, hands still clenched around the polished wood.
Draco chuckles. “I’m sure you’ll… find a way.” He adjusts them into a more comfortable position, wrapping himself around Harry’s back and kissing the back of his neck. “Now, get some sleep, all right?”
Draco throws his head back, letting out a low laugh. He playfully hooks his finger in the man’s belt loop, looking him up and down.
” Somewhere next to him, Draco chuckles under his breath, trying to cover it by taking another sip of water. “Let’s unpack that, shall we?” Harry says, his voice an octave too high. “Luna!”
Harry himself… has no such prospects in the near (or any) future. After the mayhem of the War and the aftermath died down, the moment he had dreaded the most was a long-overdue talk with Ginny whom he had avoided like the plague for that very reason. Harry’s not proud of it—although his saving grace at the time was having just killed a homicidal maniac and, in consequence, liberating all Wizardkind from a lifetime of death and misery, it was apparently nowhere near as scary as facing his sort-of-almost-girlfriend after a year of wandering the British wilderness. As it turned out, he could only fake so many illnesses (both magical and muggle), broken limbs, and Ministry meetings until Ginny had enough. She had nearly kicked down the door of Grimmauld Place, marched straight into his bedroom and cast a full Body Bind on Harry before he could say, “I’m sorry”.
Well, at least he doesn’t sound like the Hogwarts Express, he thinks, knowing it’s mean and uncalled for.
There’s also a part of Harry that’s angry, almost jealous of the clear purpose Malfoy seems to have—carved into the backs of his hands, driving him steadily way back in France, and then to England, right into Harry’s life. It’s a clarity he’s been chasing for years, a sense of self-security he has watched slip through his fingers time and again, like a child that’s caught a ladybug, having it fly away before he can count the spots.
“You better be,” Granger says but it doesn’t sound ominous. She pinches the bridge of her nose and lets out a deep sigh. “Meeting over, boys.”
The stranger looks up as the morning sunlight reveals a pair of cold, piercing grey eyes, without a single twitch across his brow despite the harsh light. His pale face stands out in the room like a perfectly chiselled stone mask when he speaks.
“No, no!” Draco rushed to reassure him. “It’s my fault. Shit. I’m sorry, I’ve never— I can’t control it as well as I thought,” Draco breathed. “We need to stop,” he added, “it was selfish of me to ask, I shouldn’t have—”
“Hello, anyone here?” A disembodied voice muffled by magic echoes across the lab. The Unspeakable’s footsteps are getting closer and Potter pinches Draco’s nipple with his free hand, the absolute prat, and moves his fingers so Draco can breathe through his mouth, more quietly.
“I wonder,” Harry says, propping himself up on one arm. He messily traces the outlines of Draco’s muscles, with his index finger. “If things will be any different than they were back on the road.”
Draco cries out, a strangled moan escaping him as his head lolls backwards, breath speeding up. “Harry, oh my
Harry stops in his tracks and looks at Draco. Just like with the flat, he feels like he’s getting to really
“Ones that cure lycanthropy?” Draco lets out a long exhale. “No, unfortunately not. We’re not even close to finding a proper cure,” he says gravely.
“Look at you,” Draco whispered, dipping down to kiss his calves, the insides of his knees, going lower to the soft flesh of his thighs. “It’s like you were made to be splayed across expensive things,” he murmured, brushing his hands all over the taut muscles, smiling against the hot skin as Harry gasped and arched under the attention. “And kissed,” he whispered, kissing over his sternum, “and licked,” he added, sucking a nipple between his teeth, “and worshipped.” They both gasped as Draco leaned over to kiss him and their cocks slid together, almost painfully hard at this point.
“Am I—” Draco swallows thickly and exhales. “Am I the first person to ever see them? To ever see you like this?”
“I—” Draco’s eyes are dark with blown pupils, his hair is a mess and he’s looking at Harry with something that could only be described as barely restrained hunger. “I don’t want to make you do anything—”
“Draco,” Harry breathed, forcing his voice into calmness, wishing away the audible tremble he couldn’t quite shake. This was no time to collapse. He needed to be strong—for Draco, for himself—it was Harry’s turn to be the rock. He put his hands on Draco’s shoulders, shaking him a little but Draco stood still, in a statuesque trance, shock and fear marring his handsome features. “Draco, please,” he choked out, “Draco. Hey, I’m here.”
A week passed, another started and Potter kept working, meticulously going over the provided list of Draco’s possessions. It turned out Draco was more than helpful—Draco was
Draco slowly turned his head and just stared, his eyes jumping across Harry’s features as if he was in a rush to commit them to memory and Harry maybe wanted to scream, to cry at him so he would stop, it wasn’t like there was no time left, they had all the time in the world just five minutes ago.
In the corner of his eye, Harry sees Malfoy turn so he busies himself with throwing everything he’s bought onto the other bed.
At that moment, Harry realises he doesn’t want to hurt Draco just as much as Draco doesn’t want to be hurt. And that, in turn, makes Harry want him like never before.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just looks at him like Harry’s the only person in the world. It makes him shudder with need so he pulls Draco back by the neck, anxious to keep kissing him, to make up for the time when he was too stupid to notice his own feelings—and what a frustrating thought, to know they could have been doing
They settle in the living room and Draco instinctively finds the remote and starts flipping through the channels, finally choosing some game show so it acts as background noise more than any actual entertainment. Harry watches his profile and shakes his head quickly. “Ew, no, don’t ever grow a moustache.”
“I suppose,” she says, still displeased with her master plan not working—it happens very rarely and is always met with a briefing that, more often than not, includes graphs and flipcharts to figure out what exactly went wrong. Harry hysterically thinks about the visuals Hermione would prepare for a presentation about his sex life and imagines a cartoon-y chart with a thick, red line spiking down and Hermione with an angry expression, holding a pointer and hitting the chart with it. He tries very hard not to laugh.
“I suppose you could call it that,” Draco muses, still strangely quiet. “Visions, not real ones, obviously, just— manifestations of sorts, a reflection of what could be. My research indicates that there’s an association with the smell, too.”
He tiptoes around the topic for the next few days but doesn’t get any closer to finding a solution; the thing is, Draco still has his wand which Harry gave to him himself and now doesn’t know how to get back without making it seem like he doesn’t trust him. It’s not that he does, Harry thinks; it would be foolish to put his trust in the criminal-turned-witness he’s supposed to protect, even if Harry—unprofessionally, tragically—finds him really bloody fit. So even if they fought side by side, even if Draco tended to his wounds, and brought him breakfast the next morning, Harry needs to stick to the rules. Like his personal stone tablets, those rules keep him sane, keep his confused desires in check, and even though Harry’s track record of defying authority might speak against him, he desperately craves something stable to hold on to at the moment.
Draco’s eerily quiet as they arrive at the end of the short queue. He takes a tentative step back and looks all the way up, craning his neck. His Adam’s apple bobs at the column of his throat as he swallows thickly, and Harry follows the movement, missing the privacy of their hotel room.
“I need to—” Harry groans as Draco bites at his neck and sucks hard kisses into his skin, his stubble leaving it reddened and sensitive. He’s going to have bruises and the mere thought of being marked makes his cock drool in his trousers. The lovebites aren’t even visible yet and Harry’s already half-aware he won’t be healing them—there’s something thrilling in the idea of him looking in the mirror tomorrow and seeing Draco’s marks, being claimed with those lips and teeth for everyone to see, for Draco to know, and for Harry to feel—a tender, physical reminder of their activities. The thought turns up the heat growing at the base of his spine, making Harry bare his neck in a silent plea for more.
Like a slow song starting to accelerate, they fell into a delicious rhythm and Harry’s legs spread wider and wider for Draco to slot in between, to be closer, to build up to the one thing Harry wanted even more than what they were already doing. He crossed his ankles at the small of Draco’s back, his body riding out the waves of pleasure, and tensing to keep them there despite all the slickness covering their skin.
Harry tilts his head. “I feel I should be asking that question. And for your information, I’m calling the Minister today and we’re finding out what happens next. Aren’t you excited?”
“Tell me,” says Harry, “Is it the magic?” He sends a gentle Stinger at Draco’s thigh with just one finger, feeling it dash up his body like lightning and elicit a delicious moan.
“Your question brings me to three: apparently, Muggles do not feel that threatened by—and I am quoting—
Harry’s voice was low when he found his next words. “I couldn’t stop thinking about it. The whole two weeks, I thought about us— And—” he swallowed. “And before that, too.”
When Draco saw Potter slip out to the terrace, his need to get some air felt somewhat justified, seeing that even the Saviour himself decided to ditch his table.
Harry kisses him with all the anger and desperation that have been festering inside him for the last four weeks, bites Draco’s lower lip with all the built-up despair from thinking he'd never again feel it give under his teeth, slips his tongue inside his mouth to claim him like he’s never been gone in the first place. Draco melts against the wall, arching into his touch, and letting out a soft whimper as he opens up and lets Harry devour him.
if he couldn’t do his job anymore. And, Merlin forbid, he used that gold for something else.” He speaks fast, piecemeal, as if hoping Harry won’t notice or remember that Draco Malfoy’s capable of empathy.
“I—” Draco choked out between coughs, “It was just some mist, I,” he said, rubbing at his eyes. He didn’t feel any different and reckoned it might have been some long-withered beauty spell but Harry gently moved his hands away from his face and watched him for too long, his eyes lingering on Draco’s lips of all places.
Harry starts to better understand Malfoy’s moods and motivations, knows when to keep pushing and when to back down. He knows to keep asking to check his injuries and witness them fade over the next few days. He knows to press the issue of clothes until Malfoy finally caves, agreeing to borrow some of the spares Harry has brought, even if he asks Harry to shrink and Transfigure them black beforehand.
He takes a step back, and another one, and Draco follows, until Harry’s legs are flush against the washing machine that’s now running at full speed. “Come on,” Draco murmurs and nudges his nose against Harry’s. He inhales, hard, and places his palm flat in the middle of Harry’s chest, right over his Avada scar. His heart is pounding so fast, Draco must surely feel it through the thin cotton of his top but all Harry can focus on are pale eyelashes, how light they are against Draco’s skin, and how the sight of them slowly disappears under the weight of Harry’s own eyelids. His breath speeds up as Draco rubs his nose, and cheek, and lips against his face, searching, wanting, his exhales hot against Harry’s burning skin.
Harry nods once. “Muggle credit cards, basic healing stuff, the Invisibility Cloak, spare clothes… my phone,” he lists in a hushed tone, refusing to accept what Kingsley is about to say.
“Beautiful,” Draco whispers as he kisses down Harry’s back. He dips his tongue in each dimple below, eliciting a gasp from Harry. He can already feel his cock hard and leaking, tucked between his hip and the pillow and whimpers, trying to find some friction against the impossibly smooth sheets. “Shh,” Draco gently admonishes, “let me take care of you.”
this. He didn’t believe in soulmates but this foolish, hopeless, consuming love could have easily been the thing that might kill Harry one day, if there was ever someone else. It made him sick.
“You were scared people would find out?” Harry asks, a little puzzled—Draco never hid his preferences as an adult and thinking of him hiding in the closet didn’t sit well with Harry for several vague reasons.
“There’s the Gryffindor we all know and love,” Draco says with a smirk. Harry wants to wipe it off with his mouth.
Harry says nothing, biting the inside of his lip. There’s sweat under his collar and he’s getting dangerously close to letting go, letting himself think about it, about having them
Harry brushes his hand up and down his toned stomach, slightly grazing the tip of his cock on every downstroke. “You feel so good, Draco, oh my god, so—tight—” He kisses all over his shoulders, the knobs of his spine, noses at the wet hairs sticking to his neck, muttering nonsense against flushed skin.
him, filled Draco with the strangest mix of dread and exhilaration, made his cock leak and his heart flutter. And it wasn’t Potter anymore, was it? It was Harry; Harry’s lips wrapped around him, Harry’s hands roaming over Draco's skin, Harry’s fingers in Draco's mouth. Under him, around him, inside him. Harry, Harry,
When he’s back, Malfoy finds his now lukewarm tea on the counter and raises an eyebrow—he must notice the faintly purple tinge of the Dreamless Sleep. He nods curtly at Harry and downs the whole cup.
and backed out of the lab, catching her belt loop on the door handle, a grand finale to that disaster of an interview.
One afternoon, Draco enters the room with a sour face, trying to adjust his collar and sleeves, scratching and picking at his shirt.
Something strange twists in Draco’s stomach, sets him on fire with some kind of stupid hope, a fleeting fantasy rearing its head as his breath speeds up.
Draco kisses him all over—back, shoulder blades, each rib marked with a touch of lips, he traces Harry’s spine with his tongue, making him shake and moan, his hands brush every inch of skin and knead the flesh of his arse. Anticipation slowly builds under Harry’s skin, arousal simmers low in his belly, and he sighs in pleasure, relaxing into the touch of Draco’s skilled hands. His whole world is reduced to that unbearably good feeling, to Draco’s lips and tongue on his body, to his hands and fingers that dip a little further between his cheeks with each brush, easing Harry into the touch.
They’re both getting close and Harry’s movements become stuttered as he drapes himself over Draco’s back, breathing harshly into his ear, his hand moving to wrap around his cock. The orgasm Harry feels coming is slowly mounting at a low simmer at the base of his spine, deep in his muscles that keep pumping ahead in time with Draco’s broken cries. Harry wanks him in time with his thrusts and Draco goes wild in the bracket of his shoulders, twisting his neck to catch Harry’s lips.
Harry stares. Just when he thought his sex life could not get any more depressing, he finds out the 129-year-old man
Ron is, apparently, not getting on with the program just yet as he squints at Draco. “Since when does Malfoy babysit for my brother?
Harry devoured Draco’s mouth with a particular kind of desperation and his hands couldn’t keep away from his belt, and the keening sounds hidden just behind Draco’s lips urged him on further. He pulled Draco off the counter and squeezed his arse, felt their erections pressed together as they gasped into the other’s mouth.
Dean watches him with the intent and wobbly focus of a very determined drunk. He squints at Harry for an uncomfortable amount of time before he asks: “Not even a handjob? Blowjobs?”
Harry suppressed a shiver at the thought, brushing off the images already forming at the forefront of his mind. Thoughts like that never helped—it was just a sure way to a dull, aching feeling in his chest and, sometimes, a painful erection if Harry entertained them for too long. He busied himself with another folder from the pile on his desk, knowing full-well Draco would notice Harry hadn’t done any work while he was absent.
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose. “I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that.” If Malfoy was here to kill him, he would have attempted it already, seeing that his chances of getting out of here are slim no matter if they’re surveilled or not. Harry sits back and gives him a pointed look; he feels a lot of Malfoy’s bravado is based in his sharp tongue so Harry tries to kick it from under him, going for the silent, broody interrogator role. It’s an interesting exercise in restraint, seeing as Draco Malfoy has always awoken a side of him Harry has almost forgotten he possessed. And that part of him is anything but restrained.
“How do you… know all these things?” Draco glances at him with barely restrained suspicion, as if Harry secretly owned a daycare service and trained himself in baby-whispering on unsuspecting strangers’ kids while fighting crime at night.
“Fine,” he sighs. “If I’m not here when you come back, check the DMLE detention room, or, I don’t know, the Muggle police stations.”
“Do not patronise me,” he says, his resolve breaking a little, piece by piece, as Harry sees a tiny smile starting to spread.
Draco makes a strangled sound and Potter, the bastard, grins and catches Draco’s lower lip between those perfect teeth. “Gods, you’re hard. Come on, give it to me.”
The door slowly opens and a nameless Unspeakable ducks his Glamoured head inside, looking around the empty lab.
but something that feels so good, they just can’t resist the temptation. Potter’s fingers pump in and out of his mouth and Draco has to stifle a needy whimper each time Potter’s hips stutter ever so slightly. The bloody maniac isn’t
“No, really, Harry, literally everybody loves a strong man taking care of a child,” Hermione says seriously, and Harry’s memory supplies him with freeze frames from Muggle movies with that specific trope, groaning internally at Hermione always being right. “Even if they don’t want kids themselves.”
He kicks a small piece of rubble onto the road and it’s only slightly funny, to see the Malfoy Harry remembers so well come up to the surface—a petulant, spoiled child in the body of a grown man. His hair is in complete disarray from where he ran his hands through it—it makes him look softer and maybe a little lost and Harry isn’t yet sure how to approach that version of him.
A pause, and the moment’s passed. “Yes, what unbelievable luck has come upon me. The stars must have truly worked for this one,” Malfoy deadpans, examining the country floral bedspread before tentatively sitting down. He groans, stretching his long legs, the sound almost pornographic. Knowing Malfoy, it was probably supposed to be. “I find it hard to imagine our beloved government would keep their employees in a human equivalent of a dog cage.”
Draco treats him with a deadpan look as they arrive at their destination. Harry smiles, looking up at the large banner hanging above them:
“No thanks, I’m kind of full,” he says. “Consider it a bonus, for what a sweetheart you are,” Harry adds without thinking and sees a faint, pink tinge bloom on Draco’s face. He’s pretty sure his own doesn’t look any better. He rushes to change the topic. “And, for your information,
There’s a long pause; Malfoy quietly watches cars pass by on the motorway they can see from the roof. “I’m sure there are, Potter,” he says blankly.
Draco sniffs. “Ah yes, lately I do sort of feel like a can of red spray paint, you shake me up a little and off I go!”
They’re in bed again after two days of undisturbed bliss, full of just touching, kissing, fucking, and re-learning one another’s bodies after a long month apart. Draco’s draped over Harry like a mischievous cat, his platinum hair bathed gold in the sun rays spilling into the bedroom. Harry wonders if he’ll ever get tired of this—touching him like no-one else is allowed to, getting to see the side of Draco he doesn’t show to many, and being the reason for the way he’s smiling down at him.
“Mate, you have no idea,” Ron says excitedly. “When everybody found out, people started coming forward with all kinds of shit they knew about. Kingsley got so angry we almost ran out of Veritaserum.”
“No, Potter,” he says, throwing Harry his wand. He catches it easily, earning himself an impressed glimmer in Draco’s eyes. “What I see is that you have a pathological need to comfort, to avoid stepping on any toes. You want everyone to be happy,” he explains. “I think it’s because you couldn’t stand the guilt. What
Draco flashes him a wry smile. “Intent and intentions are two very different things. We… don’t know what the potion responds to. Your brain, your magical core, both in some capacity?”
“Really? What was it like?” she asks, now positively vibrating in her seat, but trying so hard to remain nonchalant. Harry’s so preoccupied with listening in on their conversation that an older man nudges him lightly so he doesn’t block the line. He nods in apology, still listening.
“‘Mione, love,” he says quietly. “We’re Unspeakables. We keep secrets for a living. What’s one more secret, yeah?”
They move together in a devastating rhythm, bodies slick with their mingled sweat. Harry never expected that sex with someone could feel like this—it’s like crashing with an entire galaxy with Draco in its centre. He’s the single brightest star, his every move and gasp blinding and brilliant, his every kiss like liquid electricity, pouring over Harry’s skin as they take each other apart into atoms. And Harry just lets him, with a terrifying certainty that once his nerves are reduced to a puff of stardust, Draco will gather every single bright shard and put him back together with his eyes closed, mending the edges with the tips of his fingers.
Malfoy gathers his wits, quick as a whip. He raises an eyebrow, and they’re now darker than they used to be, Harry notices absently. “I see the accommodations are still abhorrent.” He takes a theatrical look around. “No wonder suicide rates are higher in law enforcement.”
arsehole people warn their friends about. He emerges from the green thicket of leaves and the smell seems to follow him for a few steps before dissipating and giving way to all the scents mingling in the busy street—the heavy odour of burned oil from the chippy across the street, the stench of fumes from the passing cars and buses, and a delicate aroma of coffee coming from a little french bakery on the corner. That reminds him—Harry goes inside and buys two chocolate brioches from the cheerful cashier.
“I didn’t mean—” Harry suddenly feels hot, hesitant to articulate what he really wants to ask. “I mean—”
Harry lets go to come up for air, his jaw getting a little sore. There’s a string of saliva stretching out between his lower lip and the tip of Draco's cock and Draco watches as it breaks and his cock slaps wetly against his abdomen.
“Would you rather stop?” Harry asks, running his hand up and down Draco’s chest. His hands are big, warm, and rough, and Draco hums quietly.
“Fine!” Malfoy cuts him off. “If there’s a chance you’ll stop butchering me with that wand, then be my guest,” he says petulantly as if
in their plummy voices, going as far as to claim they were not in the country at all during the events. Some even took a disgusting advantage of Hermione’s House-Elf Free Will Act and had the terrified creatures dragged to the stand to confirm everything their masters said.
It’s not romance, it’s nurture. They take care of each other, they call him the sweetest names, and they make sure he knows
Draco to learn them. Draco has been hopelessly lacking in ideas as to what to do with all that information so he just collects it, snapshots of different Potters already lined up in his memories. There’s first-year Potter and Triwizard Potter (the fact that the bloody dragon task was his sexual awakening is a piece of information Draco intends to take to his grave); Saviour Potter, post-war trials Potter and mystery missing Potter for the last few years.
His mouth goes dry. “I… I don’t— It can change, right?” Harry remembers the last time he smelled any at all—it was back at Hogwarts, in Slughorn’s Potions class. Back then, he could still smell Ginny but that ship had sailed a long time ago and even though there’s something melancholic about it, a fond warmth comes along with the thought and it settles Harry’s nerves a little, knowing that the right thing happened.
Their breakfast passes without any interruptions, in a silence that Harry’s mortified to call somewhat companionable. He watches Malfoy immediately snatch the muffin, not even asking before claiming it as his. He sighs happily at the first sip of his too-sweet coffee, quiet enough for Harry to pretend he didn’t hear it, and Harry tries not to laugh at the fact that taming Draco Malfoy apparently goes down to stuffing his face shut with sweets.
There wasn’t a part of Draco he didn’t want. There wasn’t a part of Draco that wasn’t stunning. It made him doomed and blessed all at the same time, it sent a hot, stabbing jolt of possessiveness through Harry’s stomach, when he imagined anyone else seeing this.
It’s dangerous and intoxicating, to think about all the things he wants to do to Draco, and also the things Harry wants done to him, over and over again, right now, right here on this couch. But not until he says what he came here to say.
The launderette is an old-fashioned one, with scrubbed tile floors, fluorescent lights and mint-green vintage machines that take up most of the space, lined up along the walls and around an island in the middle, next to two rows of plastic waiting room chairs lined back-to-back. The whole place smells like laundry detergent, squeaky clean in a clinical way, and Harry can hear the faint buzz of the lamps; it feels like he’s at a crime scene.
. He smells incredible, even amongst the thick steam and clouds of fumes coming out of the cauldrons lined up on the workbench. Draco wonders if today is a day they go to his place right after work and do it against a wall. His cock gives a faint twitch at the prospect.
Draco has become an integral part of their little family—broken and whole at the same time. A family of young adults who had to grow up when they were still children; who had to make adult decisions before they fully understood the weight of their choices. And it wasn’t just a nice sentiment or a pretty metaphorical bow placed on the top of their tragic stories—together they had created a new life of rebuilding, reconnecting, and starting over, and Harry can only smile at the thought they finally have the time to be young.
“Is that… a bad thing?” He asks, watching Draco’s expression. He seems as nervous as Harry probably should be and all he wants is to kiss—and bite, and lick— it all away.
“Please escort mister Malfoy to a holding cell,” Harry tells the Aurors. “Standard Safety Charms, his wand was already taken. He can keep the rest of his possessions.”
“He has to say the incantation,” Malfoy says darkly, wand ready. “With a little intent, that’s all it takes. It’s an old spell.”
Potter sighs again and comes closer—under copious layers of horror Draco is begrudgingly impressed with the man’s cheek. He puts a calming hand on their boss’ shoulder.
Next to him, Malfoy lets out a sultry laugh as he watches Harry with curious, glimmering eyes. “Auror Potter, such dirty thoughts,” he clicks his tongue. “Good grief, what would the Minister say?” He shakes his head at Harry’s death glare. “I didn’t
“Try again,” Harry says coldly, setting aside all the thoughts racing around in his head, his mind clearing like the surface of a lake after someone throws a stone in it. Cool resolve slowly settles into his bones as he regards his boss—well, ex-boss, now that Harry thinks about it—and prepares for the final showdown.
There’s a long, awkward pause. Harry flops down onto the desk and hides his face in his crossed arms. Finally, Ginny speaks. “Oh, babe.”
“I—” Draco stammers, probably meaning to say something comforting. He thinks better of it, though, and just nods. “Yeah. All right.”
“I’ll just Apparate to Grimmauld to change, and I’ll see you there,” Harry says as he kisses Draco for the hundredth time that morning and smiles at his grumpy face.
Ron waves his hand in dismissal. “Sure they are, you know them. As long as the kid is with friends. I did give George a call to let him know, though.”
, oh my fucking—” He gasps and drags Harry up by the hair until they’re face to face and kisses him, completely unbothered by where Harry’s mouth has just been. A spark of arousal goes down his body as Draco groans into his mouth, probably feeling his own taste on Harry’s tongue, as he keeps a possessive hand tangled in the hair at the back of Harry’s neck.
The Vault people came about a year and a half after they had settled down. Draco wasn’t officially on the lease—it would have raised too many eyebrows, two bachelors owning a house together brought too much attention. If anyone asked, Draco was a friend and a housemate, living in the spare guest bedroom that they never actually set their foot in. Their bedroom was upstairs, a private, intimate space where all secrets were left by the door, where they could unabashedly be themselves, where no prying eyes stripped them of what they had. Initially, it didn’t matter Harry was the only official resident—Muggle law didn’t really apply to them, not when they had their wands and Privacy and Memory Charms at hand, if anything were to go awry, if they had to adjust the reality a little bit to stop it from bursting their safe bubble.
has turned into a non-stop buzz of pleasant anticipation. The knowledge that they have time, that there’s no rush to fall into bed together once again is far more intoxicating than some looming fear that their first time could be the last one. The urgency will be back—every night, every time they kiss and touch, every day counting from today. Harry wonders if that’s what security feels like.
The group stays quiet for a bit, weighing her words. Harry supposes there’s some truth to them—they should have been partying and shagging in their early twenties, not going to funerals and memorials, rebuilding their school, or mending fences with their supposed enemies. He darts a look at Draco’s pointy profile. At least something good came out of it.
“One more,” Draco murmurs and kisses him again, desperately, like he’s making sure Harry’s there, real and alive, and not imagined.
,” he says, weighing his options as if it was buying groceries. Harry feels a flush creep up his neck. “So, in both cases, I’d prefer for said outcome to occur sooner rather than later. Short version, please.”
“Scratch that, I can absolutely believe it, actually,” his friend adds, picking a stray piece of lettuce off his uniform. “Fucking Malfoy. Of course, the tosser couldn’t stop himself from going evil
-borough!” he finishes lamely, spreading his arms. Malfoy rolls his eyes. “The home of mud fields and… not much else, apparently. Let’s Side-Along a little closer to the town and go from there. Find a hotel, or—”
“I want you,” Harry whispers, his heart hammering in his chest with the implication of what he’s about to ask.
Draco just gasped and pushed back, forcing his finger deeper inside and Harry let him take over, let him take as much as Draco wanted and at that point, it wasn’t just about fingers, or kisses, or cock. It was a bit of Harry as well and he wondered what pieces would be missing when they left this bathroom and if there were places where Draco would choose to keep them.
Draco chuckles, quickly regaining some of his usual self. “Yes, Auror Potter, I find sleeping in grimy, bloodied clothes highly unsanitary,” he says, “and I’m afraid that sleeping in the nude, while decidedly being my favourite option, might hurt your fragile sensibilities. The usual, please.”
Potter that night, as one year ago, Potter had done the unexpected (to the public; Draco had always felt it was long overdue)—he had quit the Aurors and joined Bill Weasley’s Curse-Breaking company, seemingly on a whim, but not to anyone who had looked close enough.
Harry unties it and manages to Summon all the little jars and vials as Malfoy examines the labels with surgical scrutiny, opening a few and giving them a tentative sniff. “They craved power and all it took to feel it was to break a few ribs. And sex… well. I told you about my work for the Family, didn’t I?” he says quietly, busying himself with the washcloth, carefully dabbing it around Harry’s wound to remove the worse of the sand and dirt.
“Oh, come here, love,” Ron pulls her into his arms and kisses the top of her head. “We’ll find the perfect cake, I promise.”
there is, why do you think I’m stuck with Potter watching me in my sleep?!” he hisses through clenched teeth and realisation dawns on Zabini’s face. “And fuck no, I don’t trust them,” Malfoy says in a low voice. “Don’t contact them, one can’t be sure which ones are corrupt and which ones are just cruel… Some would fit with our little Family like peas in a pod.”
Draco lifts his hands and draws invisible lines in the air, his slim fingers casting shadows in the dim room. “Every action creates a reaction. Energy flows, matter circulates, and magic… is. Studies show that even when we Summon something, seemingly from the Aether, it has to come from somewhere. If it didn’t, every Conjuration Spell could tear the very fabric of what we know as
echoing in his mind as dull anticipation curled its fist around his racing heart, until something cold slid around his numb finger.
“It’s protocol,” he explains tiredly. “You’re a potential witness and we have reason to believe your life was in danger. You’re now under my protection and tomorrow, we’ll find out what happens next. Until then”—Harry shrugs, mouth curved into a sour line—“we wait.”
Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. “Your hair is in a permanent state of disarray, you’re fine. I couldn’t mess it up more if I wanted to.”
He ran his thumb over the gorgeous, pink splotches of pleasure all over Draco’s cheeks. “See? Nothing,” Harry said and kissed his pointy cheekbone, “beats that. Fuck, you look—”
It took a few gentle rubs, and Harry slid a finger in between them, unable to see what he was doing. He slowly moved it up and down, feeling more oil seep onto his fingers, and then, Draco was coming. He shook violently, pounding against Harry’s prostate, and Harry followed seconds later with Draco’s fingers squeezing around the head of his cock.
“You have a bed for the night,” Harry grits out and points to the ensuite, and then to the TV. “There’s a bathroom with a shower, and there’s an old telly. Knock yourself out.” With that, he Summons the remote and throws it at Malfoy who swiftly catches it—not without a smirk—and Harry’s heart skips a single beat at the simple, ages-old thrill that goes up his spine. As much Harry hates to admit it, Malfoy’s still got it—the Seeker reflexes, the spoiled, entitled attitude and the uncanny, undeniable ability to drive Harry insane.
“They wanted to use her,” Malfoy continues, “to try and make me do… things. Things I didn’t feel comfortable doing,” he adds before Harry has the chance to ask.
Harry was losing his mind above him, his hands clutching the wooden handles so hard, they would have broken if it weren’t for the Protective and Strengthening Charms Draco carefully laced into every single one of his treasures. He groaned, and keened, and Draco ate him ardently, slowly adding one, and then two fingers alongside his tongue.
Malfoy deflates with a sigh, dropping the theatrics. “I was hoping we would avoid that awkward little part where I remind you I will only speak with
“Friends?” Harry asks, starting to slowly circle the stop Robards is standing. “That’s what we call them now?”
He looks at the bottle of liquor and suddenly wants to down it all in one go, duty, consequences, and mobsters be damned. There are over three weeks left and both Harry and Draco are teetering on the brink of sanity, which can only end in them imploding or, more probably, doing something irrevocably, abysmally reckless.
“He was suspicious, okay? I was—” Draco huffs, running his hand through his hair. “I saw him watching us, and I just. Well. Old habits die hard, yes?”
“I’d invite him to lunch because he must be hungry and feeling sick,” Harry responds automatically, his Auror instincts kicking in. Judging by the indignant huff that escapes Draco, Harry already knows what he’s going to say.
’t miss his friends’ constant nagging about him getting his head blown off one day. He chuckles at the image of the headlines if that were to happen:
He pulls out a bit, and slowly slides back into that impossible tightness, throbbing and burning around him, afraid he might split Draco in half if he’s not careful enough. The sounds Draco’s making, though, aren’t ones of pain—he lets out a string of soft, mewling gasps as Harry sets a slow pace, only picking it up the slightest bit when he feels Draco finally adjust to his girth.
“Do I get a question for agreeing to board the death machine?” Draco asks casually, with a soft note lacing his voice.
Harry forces his eyes to adjust to the strange lighting—it bears a reddish tinge due to all the surveillance spells hanging heavy in the air, their soft crackle so subtle, it’s only audible if one knows to look for it. It’s not quite like a darkroom, but close enough to throw Harry off. He can make out a silhouette of a man sitting in one of the metal chairs on the opposite side of the rusty table. The shackles screwed to its top are open, the old magic that once commanded them long withered—only the chains dangling to the sides and pooling around the legs still have enough juice to clatter obediently at the presence of an enlisted Auror.
Another blush, this time more prominent, mottled Draco’s face and its shade was close to that of his lips. “Potter.” Harry’s last name sounded like Draco melted it on his tongue for a bit before letting it drop from his mouth. “Stop looking at me like that.”
Something wild and uncontrolled flashes across Malfoy’s face and Harry savours the challenge; a thrill of excitement goes up Harry’s spine at discovering he still remembers this years-old dance. Malfoy has just swallowed the bait and if the little twitch in his jaw is anything to go on, the conversation they’re about to have will be all kinds of interesting. Harry doesn’t waste time wondering when he last felt this kind of anticipation.
!” Draco moans, thrusting up into his mouth as he grabs him by the hair and lifts his head back at the same time. It’s somewhat endearing, how Draco tries not to hurt him in any way, so Harry pins him down to the bed by the hips, revelling in the shiver it elicits. He’s not at all experienced in sucking cock but tries to do things he imagines he’d find pleasurable. Circling his tongue around the head, Harry tries to pull more of its length into his mouth, as far as it can go without him choking. He goes back up and repeats it, again, and again, and again, until he hears Draco’s loud, ragged breaths and moans, until his fingers are knitted in Harry’s hair so tight, it sends sparks down his neck. He picks up a rhythm fairly quickly, bobbing his head up and down, and wraps his fingers around the base where it doesn’t fit into his mouth, twisting his wrist on every upstroke, making Draco whimper. Harry looks up at him through the curtain of his eyelashes—there’s a beautiful pink flush spreading over his chest, his mouth open in a breathless moan and it makes Harry’s heart leap, to know that
Even though Harry could see several feathers had lost their shine, some sticking out in irregular angles, he was speechless nonetheless.
“I do like a strong, silent Slavic man,” he says dreamily and Harry rolls his eyes. “They’re much more straightforward over there, mind you, and
,” he deadpans. “I only ever used it for persuasion, don’t worry. And apparently, it also carries a certain amount of sex-appeal, which never hurts.”
They’re all chatting and having some light snacks Luna and Ginny have brought, each with a bottle of beer in hand, with the exception of Draco and his usual glass of wine. Harry thinks about the days to come and Draco’s reaction to the news that he has chugged the House of Black’s wine cellar dry at some point in the future. He laughs at the image, his shoulders shaking, earning himself a disgruntled noise from Draco, who’s back is currently propped against his side, legs outstretched and hanging over the elbow rest.
Harry opened his mouth, not quite processing what Draco just said. “You… what?” He croaked, all air punched out of his lungs.
“I wonder how you have any friends if you do the same,” Harry grins as Draco shakes his head with a cheeky smile.
“Well, since he doesn’t remember he had a date in the first place, I’d wager there’s no harm done,” Draco replies, snatching the last biscuit from the box.
Draco can feel the moment Harry replaces his tongue with his finger. Teddy’s head drops down, the tips of his hair tickling Draco’s face as Teddy lets out a low, shattering moan.
.” There’s something strange about the way he says it but Harry’s too inebriated to care and too distracted with the shirt to give it any serious thought.
It caught Harry by surprise, the wondrous realisation that he had, in fact, become close friends with Draco. It was a fragile thing, carefully woven with stories of their lives after the War, reinforced with long-overdue apologies, and burnished with all the small things they learned about each other. It was surprisingly easy to open himself up to Draco Malfoy, of all people, and it even though it should have been shocking—how eerily similar they actually were, how well they fit together in the strangest scenarios, how the most peculiar things left his mouth when there were just the two of them, sharing pints and talking the night away—somehow it just worked. Harry’s other friends took a little longer to adapt, but then, there was the time Draco brewed a Migraine Potion for Hermione to help her get through a particularly rough case, or the time he brought a Muscle Relaxant for Ginny after hearing about her post-practice cramps. The first get-togethers which Harry insisted Draco came to were a little stilted, maybe even uncomfortable, but time worked in their favour; as did Draco’s signature Hangover Potion, which became a quick and sure way to make everyone see he meant no harm. After that, even Ron allowed himself to let out an occasional grumble that maybe Malfoy isn’t as much of an evil prat as he used to be anymore.
“It’s about my wings,” Draco blurted and stared at Harry with a mix of dread and embarrassment. “I… understand if you want to leave at any point but—” he sighed. “You’re the only person I can trust with this and,” he shrugged helplessly. “Salazar, what was I thinking?”
—” He grabs a glass from the table and hurls it at the wall. The rain of glass shards stops under Harry’s magic and disintegrates into dust that falls to the floor in a glittery mist.
He stands there, staring at the Portkey, feeling his magic vibrate inside him with a raw need to get into action, to help, and to do something.
“Bloody hell, I’m going to need to get this cleaned. Harry?” He stops and turns around to see Harry standing and staring. “All right there, mate?”
Malfoy wraps his arms around himself and takes a long, steadying breath. “They have a spell on me,” he sniffs. “To make sure I… obey. If I Apparate, they’ll know our location.”
Draco was back over him, gently nudging his hand away, whispering praise against his mouth, swallowing all the sounds Harry made. The tip of a single finger slowly pressed against his hole, and breached him, sliding inside easily, the magic-infused oil setting his nerves on fire.
“Gods, look at you,” Draco murmured, withdrawing his fingers. He watched as Harry lay there, painfully hard, covered in a thin film of sweat, his hole loose and ready. He took himself in his hand and spread some more of the oil over his cock, and Harry reached out to tug him back, to be closer. “I’ve got you,” Draco said, and captured Harry's mouth, slowly pressing inside while they kissed, and kissed, and kissed.
nonetheless—he kisses Draco’s abdomen, traces the wiry hairs with his tongue and goes lower, burying his nose in Draco’s pubic hair. It smells surprisingly good—it’s a heady, musky scent mingling with the smell of sweat and something that’s distinctly Draco. Swiping his thumb over the slit of Draco’s cock, Harry looks up to see his stunned expression, spit-slick lips and hooded eyelids. Not taking his eyes off Draco’s, Harry swipes his tongue over the slickened head.
him; maybe he’s trusted Harry every single day, bit by bit, with his life, his safety, his body. He trusts Harry to take care of him even though Draco himself has always been the only person to do that until now. He trusts Harry to see the side of him he’s sworn to bury and keep hidden for as long as he’s able.
“He’s not crazy, for one. We have reason to believe he has something worthwhile to say,” says Kingsley, his jaw clenched. Hary wonders what went down in the interrogation room that got him so tense. “But he will only say it to you for reasons he chose to obscure. So get moving.”
They’re standing in front of a small holding cell, very similar to the one Harry broke Draco out of at the very beginning of their journey. It’s full circle—they’re back where they started, only richer in a few significant developments, most of which make Harry’s heart stutter like a wild butterfly. The cell doesn’t look any different from all the other cells at the Ministry, but there are a select few that Harry knows about, including the one they’re standing in front of right now, that have a special trait Harry needs at the moment.
“How do you know?” she asks, craning her tiny body forward to look him in the eyes. Harry briefly thinks the kid is adorable, squirming in her seat, and so clearly fascinated with the tall, broody man who’s indulging her in a serious, adult conversation.
Draco doesn’t say anything but he turns around and points to a shelf in the far corner of the room, where a neat row of labelled vials was placed, presumably by Draco himself. Harry recognizes the labels—it’s the kind the DMLE uses to file evidence.
He must feel the sudden shift in the air and lets out a quiet laugh, and Harry glances up from his desk to see Draco watch him with amusement.
orning, shit!”  He groans as Draco finds the spot and angles the plug just so, nudging Harry’s prostate on every stuttered move. “Pull it out, fuck, pull it out, I want your cock, please—”
His warm breath washing against Harry’s skin makes him suppress a shiver and Harry’s momentarily grateful he’s in too much pain to think about Malfoy’s lips and teeth and all the places where he could put them to use. “I can take care of myself—”
It’s hard to imagine a person who would deserve his friend though, someone who could treat Draco how he should be treated, and Harry doesn’t know where all that protectiveness is coming from but he’s long abandoned his pursuit for a reason behind all the complicated feelings he has in regard to one Draco Malfoy.
Draco, in all his messy, complicated glory is the antithesis of stability. He’s still spoiled like a Siamese cat, debauched like a Dionysian procession, and remorseless in his many particularities. He teases Harry mercilessly and rolls in his victory as if it were the finest silk sheets every time he manages to get Harry worked up. He’s honest to a fault, infuriatingly clever, and witty to the point Harry has to stifle his laughs not to encourage him.
And it’s Draco. Half-hard against the just of Harry’s hip, breathing harshly into his mouth, pushing him questioningly, urgently, asking permission to cross the last bridge with trembling fingers and wet, soft lips.
Harry shifts under him and manages to wrap his legs around Draco’s waist. “Fuck me,” he mouths right against Draco’s lips, “I can come again, I want to see you,” he pleads and twitches his hips to make good on his promise, his cock already starting to fill again.
Slowly, Draco worked him open adding another, and then a third finger, only stopping to gather more oil to slick him up more. It was downright filthy, wet and messy, and Harry could feel that tingling of his skin in the most intimate places, imagining how completely ruined he must look with oil dripping down his thighs and arse. Draco was hard as a rock against his hip, their sweat mingling with his precome and neither of them seemed to mind the wet spot on the bed forming around them and never actually getting the chance to cool.
, and one raised with house-elves, for that matter, so you can imagine that particular skill was considered redundant,” he sniffs.
something so small and vulnerable, that made Harry’s eyes immediately fall shut. There was a rustle of fabric and then a fluttering sound, the softest gust of wind, and Harry actually felt warm, fragrant air shift against his face.
Harry pauses, his brain scrambling to process the implications of that statement. “Wait, she’s coming anyway?”
Harry squinted around the dimly lit pub as soon as the oak door closed behind him, cutting off all brightness from the fading sunset. He took one look around and immediately pinned down Malfoy, sitting at the bar and nursing a half-full pint, looking rather annoyed. Every few seconds, he scowled at Cormac McLaggen who was sitting at a booth in the corner, accompanied by a small blonde woman and two other men who looked generic and similar enough that Harry forgot their faces as soon as he turned his attention back to Draco.
Just when he thinks this blasted day cannot get any worse—sending a quick prayer to whatever Forces That Be are listening, pointing out that this is
The lunch with the gang is at two and Harry realizes he doesn’t have a change of clothes around midday. It takes him almost an hour to disentangle himself from a very naked, very sulky Draco who tries to keep him in bed using the dirtiest tricks in his Slytherin arsenal.
Harry folds one arm under his head, the injured one hanging piteously from the bed. “We can’t stay here too long.”
“I’m a freak, aren’t I? A— A creature,” Draco said helplessly, side-eyeing the wing in his peripheral vision.
Harry sat back in his desk chair, casting a heavy look at the door for what had to be the twentieth time today.
, trying not to get distracted by Malfoy’s graceful, catlike movements as he fires off spells with a sure hand and a murderous glare. They move around each other with surprising coordination, never even brushing shoulders despite being just inches away from each other. Malfoy takes a light step forward and casts a roaring Stunner, while Harry dashes around him and deflects a Disemboweling Curse charging their way. One of the Family’s men is still down and the remaining three try to flank them, shooting off curses Harry has never even heard of, though the incantations give him an idea what they do. He notices there’s barely any green lights coming out of their wands—there must be some orders to keep them alive and Harry wonders about the reason for that.
“Sandra from Gringotts,” he announced. They sat in grim silence as if the woman was lost at sea and they, two sailors, sat reminiscing about the leviathan that had claimed her. The bartender, Muggle as he was, empathically refilled their glasses and Harry let the spicy-smoke burn linger as he smeared the glass’ condensation ring over the bar counter. “I wonder if she pegs him.”
“What do you say, Freddie,” he smiles at the little boy, “is Uncle Harry going to get his arse kicked? Yes, he is? Yes, he is!” Harry blows raspberries on the baby’s tummy and laughs as Freddie squeals with delight, swinging his pudgy baby fists in the air, almost knocking off Harry’s glasses in the process.
Harry nods and follows, shooting a sympathetic smile to Swan on the way, as the boy scrubs some beakers in the sink—Draco doesn’t let them Scourgify the equipment, claiming it’s not as thorough as hand-cleaning which also
Draco turned his head around as Harry used the rest of the lube and lined himself up. He moved forward and moaned into Draco’s hot, open mouth and around his tongue and they kissed, breathless, as Harry pushed inside and started to move. His mind was as fogged as the mirror in front of them, thinking about this intimate, one-on-one spitroast with Harry all up and inside him, mouth, arse, possibly other places but Harry didn’t like to dwell on hopes.
Malfoy hums. “Among other things. They also renewed their interest in Mother, seeing as the business was thriving under the Aurors’ noses.”
Harry deflates a little at that, his heart going soft. Damn lovely Luna and her pure intentions. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Yes, Luna, I appreciate it, I really do, but I was thinking of a companion I could… I don’t know, potentially think about spending the rest of my life with?” He can feel Draco’s gaze boring into him so he decides to keep his focus on Luna. “Not—the rest of
Draco feels more than sees that he’s being watched. He huffs a quiet laugh and lifts himself off the counter.
Afterwards, they lie in bed, and the setting sun swiftly turns an after-work fuck into yet another sleepover, with Potter draped over him like he might vanish at any second, and with Draco’s thoughts still somewhat scrambled.
“I—” He gulps. “I’ll be leaving the office for lunch today,” Harry says. “Let me know if someone comes by?”
She sighs. “Fine, we’ll leave you to…” she looks between Harry and Draco with a strange expression, something Harry can’t quite put his finger on. “Whatever’s going on here.”
; somewhere in the fray, the top two buttons of his shirt have come undone and the scars peeking out of his collar only add to the bad boy fantasy on—long, muscular, unacceptable—legs, and his wicked eyes are alive with victory.
“You’re Ron’s best man so you need someone with you for the official part,” Hermione says, raising a hand as soon as Harry opens his mouth. “I’ll explain everything later. So. Since you’re not dating anyone, we could set you up with someone.”
“Quite the contrary,” Draco purrs, squeezing him, and then huffs in amusement. “Handsome, rich, famous
Ginny looks slightly offended as she crosses her arms. “Aren’t government employees supposed to be accessible to the public?” She asks wryly.
“Just the shirt,” Draco says in a bored tone just as Harry digs deeper for some pyjama bottoms. Seeing the question in Harry’s face, he shrugs. “You started it.”
Harry stops what he’s doing, clenching a fist over the edge of the counter. “Don’t— Don’t fucking turn this into a joke. That doesn’t make it okay.”
,” Harry mutters, seeing the growing concern on Draco’s face, feeling his own panic rise at the back of his throat.
Harry thought, but didn’t say it. Instead, he cupped Draco’s face in his hand, brushing a thumb over his sharp cheekbone. “Love,” he whispered. “Nothing is going to happen. People are scared, they’re always scared of something, and it’s always been used to sell them things. Those few measly spots were given away so others could see it and start buying them out and then,
Harry’s stomach sinks. “No. It can’t—” If it weren’t for the baby, he would probably take off his glasses so he doesn’t have to look at his friends. “Did you even tell her I’ll be here?!”
, Potter, you… You came to work like this?” He asks dazedly, fingers gently nudging the plug. He moves it around a bit, as much as he can at that angle, and Harry moans, his hand speeding up around their cocks. Draco arches into the touch, feeling his arousal slowly build, and absently thinks Harry needs to slow the fuck down if he wants that plug replaced with something larger, and much more appropriate at that.
In all honesty, Harry thinks a little alone time would solve a few of his problems, at least the ones of the physical nature. He remembers that first night in the shower and takes a deep breath to calm himself—there’s no use in going down that road. He’s an Auror and he will be on duty non-stop for the next eight weeks—he can’t let himself loosen at the seams, can’t sacrifice even an ounce of his usual vigilance to entertain any needs that don’t lead him towards the goal. From the outside, it would seem spartan, if not plain eccentric, but Harry tends to hyperfocus and at the moment, all his focus is sharp as a razor and aimed at keeping a witness alive so the bad guys live out their days in Azkaban. He still has to breach the subject of rules with Malfoy, to keep that uninhibited temperament in check, and to keep some small part of himself locked away, too. He and Malfoy are always nothing if not volatile and in their case, Harry suspects any rule-bending would end up shattering them completely, leaving the two of them rolling in the debris in a masochistic act of defiance.
Harry just stares, not willing to risk his voice coming out weird, and lifts the paper bag so that Draco can see the bakery’s logo.
“And,” Harry gulps, already regretting what’s about to come out of his mouth, “is there a potion that…” He trails off, deciding against it.
“Because if we keep this up, I… I’m going to want to—” he exhales, bumping his nose against Harry’s, “—do things to you.”
The laboured breathing, the pink tips of his ears. And a slight tremble to his muscles, a little tremor in his wings that tried to reach out and curl back, nerve endings screaming to be grounded, to be held. Harry recognised that particular movement.
“I’m. I’m sorry,” he says. There’s something in his voice, some strange sorrow-wonder in his tone that makes Harry’s heart too heavy for his chest as that gorgeous, scared boy still refuses to look them in the eyes. “I’ll just… go,” he states, and Harry wonders if there’s a question in there.
He snorts softly, feeling his smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “Hey, I had a pack of vending machine crisps yesterday.”
“God, no,” Harry interrupted, “he’s a wanker. Only wanted me for the media attention. Get this, he thinks he should be a model. Heavily hinted I could ‘ask around’,” he said, air quoting the last bit.
“Hi,” he says, a little breathless. His cheeks are flushed from the wind, his hair is in complete disarray, and Draco wants to Apparate them straight back to his flat, preferably right onto the bed. His mind is immediately assaulted with images from last night, of those very locks tangled between his fingers, of spit-slick lips and intricate tattoos, of breathy moans and whispered promises.
Harry knows that Draco knows. It’s clear as day. It was clear the second he left the bathroom that night, feeling the room fill with electric, guilty, silence as Draco pretended to be asleep, buried under his duvet. Harry could hear the slow, too-natural breaths coming from the bed, and his bones felt liquid when he lay down and wondered if Draco’s muscles still quivered in the aftershocks of his orgasm, just like his.
Harry’s good mood evaporates as soon as he steps into the office—it’s like a Tripwire Curse was triggered, making everything go wrong in the craziest possible ways. He gets distracted and spills a little coffee from his paper cup straight onto Claire’s desk, earning himself a murderous glare and a straight-up refusal to remind him about an important meeting on Monday. He gets a scolding from Robards for nothing in particular which most likely means Kingsley found out about some paperwork discrepancies and requested Robards take care of them personally. Then, an overeager Auror newbie sees him in person for the first time and loses his cool so badly that the poor boy ends up tripping and dropping his salad all over Harry’s front. Harry doesn’t know what’s more annoying at this point—the guy’s profound apologies, his clear infatuation, manifesting in the form of a furious flush across his face, or the fact that despite a few heavy-duty Scourgifies, his uniform still bears the faintest smell of French dressing.
secret. Harry’s not one to shy away from self-irony and it is indeed laughable—he remembers countless
It couldn’t be true. Harry curled himself into a ball against the damp wall and turned his head to stare at the red light reflecting off the hastily painted vault number.
The presenter’s hand was shaking so much, he placed it flat on the table and Harry heard Draco make a choked sound at the back of his throat. It can’t be. There’s no confirmation. It’s not happening, it’s not, they’ll say it was a false alarm, it’s something else, maybe there’s a fire, maybe—
Draco starts fucking him, hard and fast, already feeling his thighs are going to hurt like a motherfucker tomorrow morning. He’s pushing Harry down onto his cock just the way he loves it and with the Silencing Spell in place, Harry doesn’t have to hold back anymore—he moans and shouts, and lets out a series of sounds that will fuel Draco’s inappropriately-timed daydreams, possibly for years to come.
“Jean from Muggle Affairs, funny Thomas, Wizengamot James,” Ron starts listing, craning his neck to look straight at Harry while he does.
. You’re good, Potter. You’re selfless to a fault, you care about people, you’re… not terrible looking, either.”
He propped himself up on his elbows and watched Draco take off the rest of his own clothes in one smooth pull, his cock finally bobbing free. Flushed and thick, it was surrounded by neatly trimmed dark hair narrowing into a path that went up to Draco’s navel, a path Harry’d eat off of.
They sit down and Harry immediately places his hand on Draco’s thigh—it’s surprisingly grounding and sends a wave of comforting warmth all over his body. Everyone is still watching them like a hive mind that has collectively decided to let either Harry or Draco speak first. Waiting.
He was being nice about it, too, knowing full well Draco was naked under that robe, settling his hands on Draco’s arse and kneading the flesh in lazy circles, each roll bringing them closer together. The top two buttons of that cursed jacked came undone and Draco pulled it back, laving Harry's collarbone with slow licks that then turned into hungry sucking, and Harry shook against him with his fingers twisted in Draco’s hair.
“Of course you can,” Ginny says and climbs on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek. “Make sure he drinks water! A normal person shouldn’t just run on coffee like a maniac.”
Next to him, Draco chokes on his drink, and Ron barks out a loud laugh. Harry brings his hands up to massage his temples. “If you ever call it
“It’s not my first time on the run,” Harry shrugs. “Too many Cleaning Charms will do that—the fabric can only take so much, it gets stiffer when hit with too many Scourgifies.”
Over the course of a mere two months, they fall into a strange sort of relationship where they amp up the tension at work, so high Draco can almost taste it at the back of his tongue, and then do hot and sinful things to one another afterwards. But it doesn’t always end in sex, and its occassional lack is far more concerning—going home together every other day veers dangerously close to being a couple and the only couple they are is a couple of horny, insatiable fools who will one day get caught or do something unbelievably, abysmally stupid.
? Wait, but didn’t she have a choice?” He finds it hard to believe someone would just tell Narcissa Malfoy to marry some faceless man and have her comply, just like that.
Harry rolls his eyes with a smile, bouncing Freddie a little. “You would be correct. And he’s staying with Uncle Harry today, isn’t he?” He asks the little boy and is rewarded with a happy gurgle. Harry turns him to face Draco and points a finger at him. “And look, Uncle Draco’s here, too!”
There’s a dangerous, playful glimmer in Draco’s eyes as he looks up for a split second and before Harry’s lust-fogged brain catches up, Draco repositions them so they’re both on their backs, Harry lying on top of Draco with his legs spread and placed on each side of Draco’s thighs.
It’s insane, and so, so arousing, to have him completely nude, gorgeous, and wanting in his lap, Draco reckons he might as well lose his mind. Potter is all bronze, toned, and so utterly delicious, Draco throws the measly remnants of his self-control out of the proverbial window and starts responding in earnest.
On the other side of the table, Luna is peacefully reading the latest Quibbler, completely out of the conversation and in her own world. Dean and Seamus raise their glasses at Ron, both wearing amused expressions, and Hermione looks at her fiance as if she is questioning her general life choices. All of them are nursing various drinks and nobody seems to care that it’s a Sunday afternoon—if they can’t day drink while they’re still young, those lunches wouldn’t be any different from ordering a pizza at home.
Draco would like to know, too, but he remains silent and tries to school his expression into something casual without looking constipated.
“I might have thought about, oh, I don’t know, every single thing you will latch yourself onto in order to say no, as you do,” he says, examining his nails for dramatic effect.
The thing is, Harry has never considered himself a judgemental person. He’s more of an easy-going type of bloke—he helps people for a living, he recycles, he donates to charities without batting an eyelash. Additionally, he’s friends with Draco Malfoy, who, honestly, sometimes seems to be the most high-maintenance, dramatic person in the United Kingdom. Harry doesn’t judge. But he stares at his supposed
. “Excuse me?” He crosses the room, walks around Harry like a predator circling a prey that’s a match for him, calculating the odds with an amused arch of his brow.
Harry brings his other hand up and cards it through Draco’s hair and it’s so soft he does it a few more times, brushing it out of Draco’s eyes and smiling into the kiss. It’s nothing more than a press of lips but his heart is already leaping out of control, and it doesn’t matter that his glasses are in the way or that the angle is awkward, all that matters is Draco, his lips, his soft exhalations, and his hands cupping Harry’s face. He feels light-headed, transported, and he’s pretty sure he sees stars when Draco makes a small sound at the back of his throat. The initial sweetness begins to give way to a visceral hunger, something he’s been only half-aware of even possessing, and Harry sighs, and holds Draco a little closer.
Harry bites his lip. He wasn’t expecting that, but all the things Draco is telling him are filling him with a strange sort of joy as Harry slowly starts to understand what Draco is trying to say. “Yeah, I get it, Draco.”
“Oh, pft, it was hardly torture,” Malfoys scoffs, standing in front of the mirror, shirt in hand, examining Harry’s handiwork. “The big manly brutes had their fun. I’ve had worse.”
They’re mulling about the laboratory on a boring Wednesday afternoon, with Draco feeling restless and generally distracted, and Potter doing… Potter things. He walks around with a pout Draco wants to bite down on, frowns and squints at the equipment, and sucks on his quill entirely too vigorously over his paperwork, in the maladroit way Potter sometimes just
They finally leave and Harry throws Draco’s jacket at him when they step through the door. “Try not to fuck anyone on the way,” he snarls and starts walking, hoping the cold, night air will sharpen his senses.
“God, Draco. Oh my god,” Harry whispers and runs his hands through his hair so they would stop shaking.
Ron clears his throat. “So. Apparently, people use it to shag in. Can you believe it?” he asks incredulously, as if he was more offended at the fact
Harry puts away his bottle and wraps his jacket a little tighter around his middle—it’s getting cold but he’s reluctant to burst the little bubble they’ve found themselves in, especially if Malfoy’s feeling chatty.
Their fall into each other feels like collapsing a stack of dominoes—one small nudge and the whole carefully-built structure crumbles before either of them can stop and think about the consequences.
At one point Harry starts to shudder and limply falls forward, biting down on Draco’s clothed shoulder. “M’close,” he whimpers, head bouncing against Draco’s neck. “I’m close, so close, don’t stop—”
Draco shrugs. “The same way I’ll know you are—you won’t. I’m not so keen on taking a shot of Veritaserum every time I ask you to open a bloody window— By the way, I’m the only person I know that can brew it without that god-awful aftertaste, honestly, can you taste it too? It’s what I imagine a dragon pox-ridden cock would taste like—”
Draco uses all his well-mannered sensibilities to choke on his wine as discreetly as possible. Ron spills his beer, Dean and Seamus grin like madmen. The girls giggle, hiding their faces behind their hands.
“I still can’t believe it’s Malfoy, of all people,” Ron says, shaking his head. Harry hums in response around his half-eaten sandwich.
“Having a blast, are we?” he growls, not caring he’s holding Draco by the front of his shirt, snarling at him like a rabid dog.
“What does your Amortentia smell like?” He blurts out, turning his head just in time to watch concern give way to complete mortification on Draco’s face.
“They’ll stop, you know. If you ask?” Draco says quietly. “They mean well but they’ll stop pestering you if that’s your wish.”
He tries to side-step him but Harry’s quicker, blocking his way while maintaining a distance—any touch would just cause him more pain. “The Aurors did it,” Harry more states than asks.
Draco, as if reading Harry’s thoughts, chuckles lightly from the bathroom where he’s filling the bowl with warm water.
He heard another choked sound and whirled around to Draco who was breathing harder and faster with every second. Harry crossed the room in two swift strides and wrapped his lover up in his arms.
Harry rolls the magazine and glances at him with a knowing smirk. “You’re scratching. Your clothes are getting uncomfortable.”
He comes out and mutters weakly that the bathroom is free, rushing to his bed and finding it as good as new. All the potions Draco took out are gone, presumably back in the Mokeskin pouch, save for two—Dittany and a Painkiller Potion. Draco’s leaning against the table, nursing a cup of tea and staring at Harry with wide, shining eyes, stark and bright under his general mask of indifference.
Potter crosses the lab and stands way too close for it to be interpreted as required professional proximity between Unspeakables
Draco glares at him with a raised brow, lazily swirling his wine glass in deft fingers. “Finnigan, Finnigan, Finnigan,” he clicks his tongue theatrically and slowly shakes his head. “I refuse to conform to your skewed image of gay men’s sexual roles perpetuated by societal stereotypes—”
“Wait! Wait—” Draco waves his hand, seeing Harry’s exasperated face. “Apologies, the Saviour had me all… loose. Also, ah,” he stumbles, his cheeks taking on a faint pink flush. “There are also
Harry doesn’t believe a word he’s saying but it’s not his job to check if anything in Malfoy’s file was worth the time. He deflates a little, rubbing tiredly at his eyes. “You said things went south.”
He’s magnificent—already lubed up and ready, cock wet and flushed a pretty red, and Draco groans, thinking how easily he’ll slip inside when Harry mounts him. Draco circles his hole and easily slips two fingers inside, shallowly pumping them in and out.
Draco, naturally, turns more than a few heads as they enter but walks straight for the bar, not paying any mind to the curious glances he earns, only smiling with predatory satisfaction. Harry can hear a whistle or two sent after them and he clenches his jaw, walking forward with stiff shoulders and an indifferent expression. While he’s slightly uncomfortable with the staring, Draco seems to revel in it, to come alive under the awestruck scrutiny of some of the younger men and Harry, begrudgingly, can’t really blame them. Draco looks positively
“I’m going to cast a few spells,” he whispers into Harry’s ear, sending sparks down his back. “Protection, cleansing, lubrication,” he says, “is that all right?”
Draco turned to reach the nightstand where he, presumably, kept his lube, and a thought crossed Harry’s mind, a thought that nearly made him come on the spot, his cock filling even more at the very idea.
Expensive dress shoes clack sharply on polished stone as a slim, tall man strides across the Ministry Atrium.
“Harry where’s Maggie?” Hermione asks and sits down on the sofa, putting her feet up on the coffee table—a clear sign she’s had a very long day.
And Harry does, devotedly and desperately, he unbuckles Draco’s belt, makes quick work of his trousers and then, his fingers wrap around Draco’s cock. He thumbs at the slit, spreading precome around the head, and swallows the sounds Draco makes as he slowly brings him to full hardness.
“Long time no see, Dmitri,” Malfoy rasps right next to him, as he tightens the garrote around his neck. “I was starting to wonder whether I’d ever see your repulsive face again.”
“Do you have a smell you hate?” Harry asks abruptly, thinking back to the disastrous date. Well, not exactly disastrous—still, somewhere oh his way back, Harry decided he’s not going to pursue anything with Amy.
at the large chandelier right above Harry’s head. He ducks at the last second, jumping off to the side as it crashes down on the marble floor in a rain of metal shards and broken glass.
Draco laughed. “No, I have never used it for its intended purpose,” Draco said, deliberately hinting there was a
wasn’t directly responsible for that, do you see?” Draco says, a strange wonder lacing his voice. He shrugs. “Not all of it, at least. So I came back for me, too, Harry. After the trial, I was finally my own person and it made me realise that there’s a chance for me, still. So I also left to have some space to think. About if I should... take that chance.”
“Fuck! Yes, right there,” Harry gasped, swallowing air in large gulps, still clutching Draco’s neck. “How do you do that—” he moaned, clenching around him, “every fucking time,” and Draco let out a strained laugh and canted his hips back, and forwards again, setting a lazy, dragging rhythm, leaning over Harry to catch his lips.
,” Draco said darkly and paused. “Didn’t peg you for someone who’d worry about upholstery, of all things,” he said and Harry chuckled.
but didn’t touch me, they just wanted to feel the power every bully feels when they’re humiliating someone,” Malfoy explains. “And believe me, I should know,” he adds with a wink. “Mind if comb through your potion stash?” he asks, pointing a finger at Harry’s pouch.
“Love, look at me,” he whispered croakily. “Hey, Draco, love, please. Please,” he begged, feeling his voice was about to break.
Harry wants to touch the bruises. To help somehow, to mend what he can; and while he’s not the one who did it, inexplicably, he feels responsible, hating the instinct at the same time. He wants to trace a finger along the Sectumsempra scars, too, to feel the sinewy ripple of evidence of the darkness inside him that perhaps only Malfoy knows how to ignite. “Why didn’t you say anything?” he asks abruptly, his mouth dry.
Slowly, Harry brushes the tips of his fingers at the edges of Malfoy’s ribs and Malfoy jumps with a hiss.
… Please, fuck, please, Draco,” Harry gasps, his hands shaking violently as he forces his core to channel all the damn magic that inhabits him. “
Harry gives Draco’s cock a few experimental strokes, feeling his mouth water. He has no idea how to go about what he wants to do but wants to try, to
Harry carefully took a long firearm out of its case (XVIII Century British Commercial Musket, with a nice mottled patina on the barrel) and stared at Draco with raised eyebrows, clearly having trouble with imagining Lucius ever wielding such a weapon. Draco, splayed in his favourite chaise lounge in the drawing room, looked up from a court order he was going over and chuckled, feeling strangely giddy with the way Harry’s face scrunched. He explained how some wizards simply appreciated the aesthetic and knew that, in times of need, objects like that would sell quick and easy as opposed to large, impractical furniture and art, or outlandishly expensive and suspicious diamonds. His father was, indeed, a proper wanker, but the man had always known his way around money—he would go on about diversifying assets, investments, and stocks, and while Draco didn’t remember much of it anymore, he knew there were certain
They walk around for a bit and Harry can see Draco slowly relax, the tension in his shoulders and the mistrustful expression he only wears in the presence of Muggles in large numbers, slowly dissipating to be replaced with a child-like curiosity that he immediately masks when he notices Harry is looking. Still, Draco eyes the mouthwatering foods the sellers are offering, traces the rows of colourful bunting hanging off poles decorated with fairy lights, and scrunches his nose at the mingled smell of popcorn, mulled wine, and candy floss permeating the air. Harry feels his own stomach grumble so he nudges Draco and jerks his head in the direction of the food stands.
Harry turned to look at Draco with a smile. Shifting on the couch, he patted the spot in the vee of his legs. Draco shook his head fondly, white-blond hair falling attractively to the side of his face. Taking two deliberate steps, he lowered himself next to Harry, sighing contentedly as he slid in the crook between his thighs. Even though it was only spring, Draco was warm like a summer field, pale gold and rosy pink in the late sunset light spilling over him in a radiant glow. Harry kissed the back of his head, the tip of his ear, that bluish vein going down his neck and Draco squirmed with a laugh, trapped in the brackets of Harry’s strong arms.
When the Family first made itself known about two years after the war, it was clear they were in it for the long run. Throughout the trials that were still ongoing at the time, Harry watched, helpless and furious, as low-rank Death Eaters were let off the hook, one by one, hearing after hearing. The bigger fish, the ones who Harry had seen kill and maim with his own eyes, didn’t manage to slip through the cracks and he had personally lent his testimony to ensure that. And yet, so many of them had slipped from Wizengamot’s seemingly iron grip. Doped up on illegal Veritaserum suppressants, claiming they were kept under
There had been six instances Draco had deemed close ones, where Potter had the audacity to take workplace teasing to an unacceptably high level. The man’s libido seems to be more of a steady thrum of lust reverberating along his body rather than a vessel that eventually would run empty. The ‘no sex at work’ rule is more of a given than something Draco would think needed to be carved in stone and, perhaps, that’s an error in his logic alone. Gryffindors in general, and Potter specifically, apparently do not distinguish between ‘allowed’ and ‘not explicitly forbidden’.
“Harry, you’re hurt, I’m Apparating us to Mungo’s, all right?” Hermione asks and, without waiting for an answer, takes his hand and then, they’re both swallowed into the aether.
Besides, there’s no way this ridiculous attraction is mutual—Malfoy is all talk, always eager to mess with him, and some things just never change. The only thing Harry can do is suck it up and maybe get it out of his system as soon as his right hand heals. Setting his priorities in this clusterfuck of a mission is the only way for him to focus on the goal, get it done, and move on with his life. He washes himself, and does his best to forget Draco’s strange behaviour, his voice, and the unbearable tenderness that came out in a moment just as inconvenient as Harry’s own reaction.
Lazy, late summer days spent with Draco were his favourite. Those were the days they didn’t go outside at all, with the usual Privacy Charms firmly in place and Cooling Charms blasting throughout the house. The air outside was heavy, sticky with heat, and the sun rays spilling into the living room bathed the space in a dreamlike golden glow, with specks of dust floating across the sharp light. Sometimes, they would cook or bake together and Harry fondly remembered the one time when instead of brownies, he ended up with a lapful of chocolate-covered Draco. He kissed and licked the warm sweetness off his lover’s damp skin, and they made love in the kitchen, and then in their bedroom, and they laughed and kissed so much, Harry felt his heart was about to burst. Sometimes, they would take a cool shower together and it always ended up longer and hotter than planned—those were the times they stayed in bed after, and took each other apart in slow, deliberate sessions, one fading into the next, like a blurred photograph film, until they both collapsed from exertion, wet, flushed, and completely worn-out.
—it’s a kind of charming obliviousness and series of moments where it takes him a second to catch Draco’s convoluted meanings (and Draco doesn’t really blame the man, seeing as he’s a wizard not only with his wand, but also his cock
“What? Who?” Harry asks, already getting out of his chair and putting on his uniform jacket. Ron looks at them, blinking confusedly.
He flops down onto the closed toilet seat and lets out a breath he’s been keeping ever since he overheard Malfoy and Zabini talk. It’s absurd, to agonise over spilt milk like that, over an incident that probably is not even an isolated case, Harry thinks—and it's not about Malfoy, he tells himself, it’s not. But it’s not spilt milk either, it’s blood, on Harry’s case, and hands, and conscience, and besides the constant guilt he carries with him like a medal of honour, poking him in the chest with its rusty needle, an ineffable sense of shame tucks itself right next to it. He tries to search his memory for a bad feeling, for the instinctual feeling of
his words) and that’s apparently good enough for Draco to now be conditioned to get a semi when Potter asks ‘so, your place?’.
“Ah, ah, I know what you’re thinking, Auror Potter,” he says playfully, “and we both know you can’t take it.”
The weather is nice enough that they take a little stroll by some unspoken agreement—Malfoy is back to watching Muggles with barely contained fascination, and Harry just tries to enjoy the little pocket of peace for all that it’s worth, thinking about how perfect today would be for flying and how much better he would feel after a quick spin on his broom.
As he was leaving he watched as Granger spoke to Harry and he actually faced her and nodded before saying something in return.
He startled awake, the remnants of an all too familiar nightmare racing through his body, chasing away sleep with a rush of adrenaline. He had fallen asleep again. When he looked around the room, he guessed not much time had passed, no more than an hour since the last time he looked around the empty room.
Draco's breath hitched, but he didn't freak out like he thought he would if Harry said those words to him. "Love you. Sleep well." He kissed Harry's forehead and fell asleep and dreamed of a cottage with a garden surrounded by fields.
Since every eighth year got their own room, they no longer had those forsaken four poster beds. He looked back to Harry to see that he was watching Draco with a thin layer of curiosity to cover the after affects of his panic attack. Draco smiled, no more than a small quirk of his lips, before he turned off the lights, leaving the candles lit.
Draco laughed and eventually pulled away, the cool air pushing through their clothes and doing its best to ruin the warmth that they were creating. They stood and packed everything up, riding back to the castle well past whatever curfew existed now. The two of them snuck back into the tower and back into Draco's room, giggling like the teenagers they weren't allowed to be.
"You shouldn't need to be saved, but I'll always help you." Harry mumbled. He shifted again, getting comfortable before letting sleep take him. "Love you."
Draco ran his hands through his hair and smiled. It was even and probably easy to tell, but it was finally the length he wanted it to be. Whenever Pansy would do this for him, she would be so afraid that she'd cut it too short. He smiled and turned to Harry who looked a little nervous about the job he had done. When he saw Draco's smile though he relaxed.
Hermione stopped too. "I apologized and he said thank you." A trouble looked crossed her face. "He looked scared when he opened the door, like he was expecting someone else."
He could hear the whispers, feel the stares that followed him when he left the room and made his way back to the shared common room for everyone who had returned to their eighth year. He was used to it, of course. Being the son of one of the highest ranking Death Eaters and being branded as one, as well as being saved so publicly by the Chosen One painted him in a light that was too close to the spotlight for his liking.
Eventually his ears stopped ringing enough to hear a calming voice talking against his neck. Words of encouragement and...praise. Why was Harry saying he was amazing? He wasn't. He was weak and a coward and didn't stand up for himself because it would show everyone and remind himself that he was alone.
Draco let Harry hand him his plate and waited until Harry had his own plate in hand before starting to eat.
Tuesdays were his favorite days because no crumpled papers flew at him, no hateful words appeared on his desk or across his notes. He didn't need to look at the ground to avoid being poked at or to the ceiling to hold the tears that threatened to fall at words spat in his face. All because there was only one person in attendance who no one wanted to see angry.
Harry flew back to the castle and went to grab Draco from his room. Hermione was coming down the stairs, on her way to Hogsmeade with Ron. "How did it go?" Harry asked, pausing on his way up.
It took longer than it should have to untangle himself from the quilt, he was still so tired and his limbs didn't want to do what he wanted them to do. He was uncoordinated and clumsy. The first time this had happened, Draco nearly fell into the fire when he tried to escape the confines of the heavy fabric. To avoid making his headache worse, he just assumed it was one of the house elves, who he had seen on more than one occasion coming in and tidying the room while presumably everybody slept.
He was as shocked as they were, not that he showed it. He heard everyone whispering, saying that maybe it was from when he was little, before school, his mother was probably the center of that memory but they were so far off the mark. But he didn't correct them, or even acknowledge that they were even speaking about him. He just focused on maintaining the spell until their professor said "that's enough."
"Draco, that's enough." Pansy said after sitting silently beside him for the better part of an hour. Neither of them had said a thing to the other. But after being his friend for so long, Draco shouldn't have been so surprised that she could read him so easily. "You are your own person now. You don't have to live up to anyone's expectations anymore. Especially not
"This couldn't have happened with just one trip." Harry muttered as his fingers ghosted over the damage. Draco turned his face away from Harry as he tucked his thumb and pinky. "Three times! Draco, why do you let them just do whatever they want?"
He felt something warm cover him, then a solid presence curl around him. Draco focused on those feelings, on the weight of an arm over his middle, of a hand gently pressing him back against that warmth. He focused on the even breaths of the body behind him, the steady rhythm of the heart beating and tried to get his body to mimic it.
"Hermione used to cut our hair when we were...running. Ron tried to return the favor once, but it looked worse than when it started. I evened it out for her. I used to cut my own hair, it's so much easier to do it when I  can actually see what I'm doing." Harry explained when he ran his finger through the now short hair. He brushed off all the hair that clung to Draco's night shirt then spelled the mess away.
to. The memory itself isn't happy, but when I realized that, it made me happy. To know that we might not be friends, and you might never want to be my friend, but you'd still put yourself in front of me. Just because you want to."
