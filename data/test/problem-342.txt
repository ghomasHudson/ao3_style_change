The kiss turns heated, filled with a new sense of urgency and desperation that he didn't know could come from Malfoy. Malfoy's hand slides into Harry's T-shirt, fingertips tracing small circles on Harry's lower back. Harry lets niggling thoughts about everything else float away — their messy history, his painting deadlines, his longing for everyone back home, and his denial about his departure from New York. The only thing he cares about is this rare and delicate romance unfolding between them, so special and precious, that he would give anything to explore it fully.
Draco is sleeping on a bed that is too big for one person, and he's still sleeping on his side of the bed. There are four things on the bedside dresser: his wand, a half-completed Potions manuscript, a glass of water and a polished Galleon.
Harry doesn’t think about Malfoy for the rest of the day. He enjoys the sunshine and the company of his two best friends, just like old times.
“I would appreciate that,” she says, flashing Harry a watery smile. She goes to Draco, and after murmuring a grateful thank you to him, eases a sniffling Rose from his arms. She kisses Rose on the head, pulls on a Weasley jumper and a thick coat for her and puts her into her stroller.
Unperturbed, Harry scoots closer, wraps the duvet snugly around them and folds Draco up in his arms, dropping an affectionate kiss on the crown of his head. He clasps Draco's hands between his own and presses kisses on his wrists.
of pale skin interrupted only by Malfoy's Dark Mark, Azkaban serial numbers and a network of healed-over scars on his abdomen — a twinge of guilt slashes through Harry — but Malfoy wears all of these blemishes like a king wearing a jewelled crown.
it, but instead, he pushes away the table of photographs beside him. It’s almost two in the morning.
Even though it is Harry's own monotonous voice echoing in the classroom, it doesn't feel as if it's coming from him. He hangs his head in resignation, dull eyes trained on Malfoy's shoes. It’s easier to say this when he’s not looking at his face. He feels numb, as if he’s lost control of everything.
Draco's throat closes up; it's suddenly difficult to speak over the lump in his throat. He recalls something that Potter told him. "They're always with us, loving us from afar, looking out for us. Like that night in the Forest, when you met your parents, Sirius Black and Lupin."
he adds inwardly. "Although I haven't worked with dough before, I'm sure I can handle it. Besides, I’ve seen you in the kitchen," he says. He hesitates for a moment before dunking a fist into the jar and sprinkling flour over the counter in what he hoped was an artistic flair.
Harry gets into a similar position opposite Draco, facing him. With a wide Cheshire grin on his face, Harry hooks a leg around Draco's hips, lifting his own hips up for the right angle before reaching down for Draco's cock with his hand. Biting his lower lip, Harry guides Draco in, letting out a loud exhale when Draco slides in smoothly.
Well, that might have been George's doing, because he might have accidentally on purpose elbowed the Weasley's Wet Weather into Harry's Quidditch training bag during his last visit to Malfoy's lab.
," Draco begs, running his hands all over Potter's shoulders and arms. And it's absolute heaven when Potter fucks him all over again, but it's different this time — Draco notices through the sex-saturated swirl of his brain — gently, slowly,
"Potter, I don't understand..." Draco starts, but stops when he sees how Potter's looking at him. He's been like this, distracted and jittery, sneaking secret glances at Draco all evening.
Draco’s body sags briefly, but he quickly wanks as Potter catches his breath. Why did he finish so quickly? His stamina is usually amazing, so why—
With each thrust, he can feel his muscles relaxing, his body adapting with each stroke paving the way for him to take it deeper, harder,
friends. I didn't expect you to be so worked-up over my absence. I had no plans to be gone for so long; I ended up meeting old friends when I was in Paris-"
"Why are you having a meltdown with a plate of chips outside my room?" Potter asks. He’s a muddy, shivering mess — still in his Quidditch leathers, tracking wet footprints behind him. His hair is windswept with one leaf nestled within, and Merlin, he looks knackered, grass stains on his cheeks, dull eyes and lips not curved in their usual grin.
Sweet Salazar, Harry’s going to propose. Knowing the great big sap that he is, he's probably going to do it around Christmas time.
Harry stops in front of a bleak, black-and-white painting consisting of a bloke sitting on the pavement outside a hotel, his head in his hands and his luggage beside him. The real hotel — quirky and flashy — does exist in New York, but when he painted this, he wasn’t in the mood to create something happy and colourful.
When Draco holds her and kisses the top of her head, whispering apology after heartfelt apology, she cries even harder. He offers a small smile to Blaise and Greg. Blaise nods at him, and then turns to Harry.
Draco shrieks Harry's name as his hips jerk and he comes, shooting his load all over the sheets. "Oh, God yes." He makes a sound — a cross between a sigh and a sob.
"Don't stop don't stop don't stop!" Draco demands. "Fuck me while I come!" He reaches back for Harry, and Harry laces his fingers through Draco's. He quickly picks up the pace and pounds harder into Draco, gasping when Draco chants his name as he comes. With every wild thrust, Harry's closer to his own orgasm, and it's gonna be so damn good — he can feel it in his bones — 'cos he's finally with Draco.
"Because you..." Draco wrinkles his nose and pauses, looking for the right words. "You feel more... real tonight. Strange, isn't it? When I know that this isn't real and I'll wake up alone tomorrow?" His smile fades. "But it's alright, because I have you when I'm sleeping, and that makes some of the pain go away. Just for a while, but it's something," he adds, looking at their joined hands.
Something big is going to happen this year, Draco can feel it. He’s heard Father’s furtive whispers to Mother all throughout summer holidays, accompanied with a flash of his Dark Mark which has been steadily solidifying in outline. Along with the fiasco at the Quidditch World Cup…
An excruciatingly long silence ensues. Potter opens and closes his mouth like a fish, grasping at words and looking increasingly perplexed. Finally, he stammers, "I don't wanna be a... a
Flustered, Malfoy lunges forward and shuts him up with a kiss so intense that Harry forgets his sentence. When they pull apart, Malfoy's eyes glimmer with intent, his control clicking back into place. He drapes himself on top of Harry and shoots him a coquettish wink. Renewed lust fires in Harry's system, and he gazes at Malfoy, his chest heaving and lips parted in anticipation.
"We need to close the case officially first. And that includes paperwork," Harry says, wincing when he thinks of the mountain of paperwork a big case like this would involve.
"Let's make things interesting, shall we?" Draco says. He regards the other man with a sly look and says, “Let me guess what you plan on ordering. If I get it wrong, I'll pay for dinner."
Harry goes to the Headmaster’s Tower, relishing the peace before the students arrive. He provides the password to the gargoyle and mounts the steps to Minerva’s office. At the door, he raises his hand to knock, but she calls to him to enter. He finds her seated behind her desk, frowning at a sheet of parchment while Dumbledore looks at it from his portrait behind her. They appear to be discussing something intently. He glances at Snape’s portrait, which is empty (good, as he has no idea how Snape would react to this particular conversation).
That single word emerges as a sound between a sigh and a sob, and Harry's composure, crumbling ever since Draco sang their song tonight, finally snaps. He lunges forward, holds Draco's face between his palms — like how he gathered their cherished memories and kept them safe in his cupped hands and his gallery — and captures Draco's lips in a messy and desperate kiss.
Draco nods, recounting their conversations about the war, for how could they have developed a friendship without addressing it? It had hung between them, wedged like a third shadow. Hedwig had been rather sickly during their eighth year, much to Harry's dismay. She had protected him on multiple occasions, almost dying during the Battle of the Seven Potters, so it was no surprise that that could have taken a toll on her health.
Malfoy stiffens, but relaxes and reciprocates, although it lacks the intensity of their previous kisses. "Potter," he mumbles.
Malfoy manages a dry laugh. “Now you know. The first person who knows the full story, and it’s Harry Potter. Harry sodding Potter at Times Square, Muggle New York.” He shakes his head in disbelief, his lips twisted in a ragged smile, as their gaze snags and hangs in the air. “Who would’ve thought?”
Harry's eyes widen as he absorbs the scene, his mouth turning up into a slow and delighted grin. A potpourri of gardens — lush with woodland trees, shrubs and ferns — greets him. There are pockets of flowers in blooming splashes of rich, stunning colour — purple, yellow, blue and pink. Bees thread through the flowers, and a bird lands on the nearest bench, pecking on some discarded bread. The shrubs rustle in the gentle breeze, and Harry moves closer to the scene, stepping onto the wooden boardwalk. He breathes in, his shoulders relaxing at the refreshing woodsy scent of plants and fresh aroma of flowers.
Hermione is about to say something, but the waiter interrupts her to clear their empty plates. She sighs, and then dredges up a bright smile. "How was your consulting session this morning? Was it with the Arthurs? Muggle, if I recall correctly?"
It's almost closing time, and Harry has not sold a single chocolate dessert today. There's absolutely nothing wrong with his treats — they were selling perfectly well before...
Draco laughs, his giddy laugh turning into the sort of laughter that makes you bend over with your hands on your knees, wheezing.
Draco winces at his imperious tone. Is that really what he sounds like when he's sleepy? And he's twenty-years-old and still using the word
Harry throws his head back, his stomach and arms clenching, the tendons on his neck tensing as he shouts Malfoy's name, his voice strained as Malfoy clenches hard around him, pulling him over the edge. Ecstasy, so potent that it feels like an apocalyptic magic thrumming in every cell, bursts like fireworks as he comes so hard inside Malfoy.
And then Malfoy asks a question, the exact question that Harry so desperately wanted him to, all those years ago in the Room of Requirement when Harry had his hand on the doorknob with his heart breaking and Malfoy looking so lost, that question that Harry thought he'd never have the privilege to answer—
fluttering on the ground. “And where are Weasley and Granger? Thought you’d…” He stops in his tracks. His face pales, his eyes glaze over, as if he’s imagining something. Malfoy’s right hand rises, as if out of its own accord, to grip the spot on his left forearm where his Dark Mark would be.
Malfoy beckons Harry to follow him to the kitchen. Although the door to the bedroom is closed, Harry can't stop the whirlwind of memories — of Malfoy in bed working himself to thoughts of Harry — Harry drops his gaze to the spot on the floor where he had come that night-
Kingsley avoids the question and provides today's date instead. "May I have your full name, Auror identification number, rank, and also the last memory you recall?"
Draco wishes at once that he could take it back. His arms feel empty without Potter, and panic seizes him when Potter storms to the teachers' table where their clothes are. "No, Harry, wait!" Draco hurries after him, ignoring the soreness in his arse.
"Is that... is that treacle tart?" He says in a hushed voice. Malfoy nods, levitates the tart onto a cooling rack, bends down till he's eye level with the rack and spins it. It's a gorgeous tart — Harry's practised eye notices the perfectly turned-out and lightly browned crust just on the right side of crumbly and glistening with egg-wash; the thick, sugary, mouth-watering layer of treacle and... Malfoy's long fingers twirling the rack; the concentration in his grey eyes and slight frown as he studies the dessert.
Potter accepts the proffered items, and then looks at him. “Since you’re here, I guess I should go for a shower,” he says, but an envious glance at the tub tells Draco what he’s really keen on. It’s the height of Quidditch season, and Potter looks absolutely knackered this Friday night. Draco knows first-hand the restoring and rejuvenating wonders the bath can do for aching muscles, sore joints brought on by vigorous exercise and made worse by cold, biting winds and persistent drizzles.
Unable to bear the stifling silence and Potter's stony gaze, Draco escapes to the bathroom. There's his pyjamas and a toothbrush. He knows he's being cautious —
"I want things to go back to how they used to be!" Draco demands. "I want us to talk at night, I want you to tell me jokes and funny things and make me laugh. I hate it when things are awkward between us, I want—"
Harry lifts a hand to gesture between them. "I…" He frowns and drops his hand, looking disappointed in himself.
Harry cranes his neck to steal a glance at Malfoy, who is moving around behind the serving line. "Prize?" he says distractedly. He had started things with just a plain desire for treacle tart, but now, he has so much more.
Before they’re due to leave, the three of them sit outside, on the steps of the closed gallery. Harry gazes at the sky, disappointment weighing heavily in his chest despite telling himself to expect nothing.
Draco pauses in his work to give Harry his full attention as he talks at length about what he had learnt. He loves watching Harry when he's this excited — the bright, wide smile stretching his mouth, the animated hand gestures and the visible energy thrumming throughout his body.
“Fuck that,” Harry says, interrupting Malfoy before he can apologise. “That’s so hot.” The thought of Malfoy, so prim and proper, wanking to him (in public, no less!) is such a turn-on. Harry drops the roses on the ground and pulls Malfoy into his arms.
He withdraws the photograph of a sleeping Draco on their last morning together. Despite the hollowness echoing within him, a small, fond smile lifts the corners of his mouth.
“Have you eaten?” he asks with his back towards Harry. “I’ve just finished my lunch, but I could make something for you if you’d like.”
He had meant for it to be a light-hearted comment, but something closes up in Potter's face and Draco wishes at once he could take it back. Curious, Draco wants to know more, but Potter catches it and says brusquely, "Not now."
Draco briefly closes his eyes and exhales. "No, you didn't. Just give me some time to clean up." As he packs his ingredients and Vanishes the mess in his cauldron, he comes to an unsettling realisation: instead of being furious at Potter, he's actually pleased at seeing him after so long. He's vaguely annoyed at Potter for not knocking before entering, but Merlin, how could he be angry at someone wearing a tight white shirt that hugs all of his Quidditch-toned shoulders and muscles in just the right way? Or how his sparkling green eyes peer out from that messy tousle of black hair, tempting Draco to run his fingers through it?
His words spiral up into a soft cry when Malfoy wraps a hand around his shaft, stroking him slow and sweet. He circles a thumb around Harry's slit, spreading pre-come over the head. He rests his left cheek on Harry's right thigh as he fondles him, alternating between hard strokes and gentle, barely-there grazes with the back of his fingers, his lips so close that Harry can feel his rapid, warm breaths ghosting over his prick. Malfoy winks at him and nuzzles his cock, his closed mouth skimming his balls and sliding up and down his shaft.
Draco whimpers and gets on his hands and knees in bed. He trails his right hand down his body, grasping the base of his cock while his other arm stays braced on the bed. He thumps his forehead down on his left arm as he starts to thrust into his hand.
He can't remember how long it has been since the Aurors turned up on his doorstep. It doesn't matter, he thinks, as the days bleed into weeks and inside him the red seeps through the white of the bandages that he papers over the cracks of his heart.
Draco nods. "I'll leave you to it then," he says, his heart dipping at the thought of leaving Harry so soon. But he's got this playing-things-cool skill down to an art, and besides, Harry will be catering to a party soon. Draco makes to exit the booth, but he's halted when the other man moves to sit beside him.
The other teachers, except Potter and Draco, mutter amongst themselves and pull out their own money. Both men share a look, although Potter's confused expression clears up rather quickly.
“Music helps me to escape from… everything. Like how your art helps you to deal with things, I assume,” Malfoy says, voice wavering.
Draco folds his arms across his chest and shoots Potter a withering look. "We wouldn't have to go through all of this if you had kept your hands to yourself! Now please leave, I've got work to do!"
"Just leave me alone, please," Draco mutters, his good mood rapidly dissipating. He makes to push past Potter, but the other man catches his elbow and yanks him closer.
Harry remembers the moment he heard about the attacks, and he probably always would. He tells Draco so.
Draco ignores Potter and goes to the living room, sitting in his usual position on the floor. Instead of launching into an explanation, he takes a leaf out of Potter's book and acts. In his mind's eye, he conjures snapshots of Potter's sentimental items — those that have come up in conversations with Hermione and Potter, along with those that he has seen in Grimmauld Place. He casts a summoning spell.
"Ahh, hang on." Harry reaches over to the other side of the bed and lobs his shirt towards Draco. While he cleans up, Harry shrugs his Auror robe off. He kicks the covers away and pulls Draco to bed.
"I don't care. I've thought about it and I don't care," Potter declares over a mouthful of tender kisses that melt into Draco's skin.
Those words are on the tip of Draco's tongue, but he swallows them. Instead, he makes a non-committal sound.
A pair of loud hoots break the silence. Hedwig and Humphrey glide towards them, returning to their respective owners. Humphrey looks at their joined hands and puffs his chest out with pride. He spies a bowl of owl treats and hops over to it, dunking his beak into the bowl and looking extremely pleased with himself.
Harry thinks of Malfoy eating dinner alone after Harry's held his hand and tasted the desserts that he's named after his parents. He imagines Malfoy living in Muggle France — incongruous images of Malfoy using a toaster, typing away on a laptop and sitting in the Metro — he can't help but crack a grin.
So, Malfoy is straight? He certainly wasn't three years ago, when he was begging for Harry to go deeper and faster. Harry snarls, teeth sinking into his lower lip at the recollection of Malfoy beneath him. If that's the case, then Harry was nothing more than a convenient plaything in Malfoy’s rebellious phase. Or is he gay, but denying himself to obey his parents and play happy families?
—" Potter chokes out after pulling off when Draco nudges a second finger in him. "Christ, this is— oh
"Kingsley, the bloody Ministry, and you can piss right off!" Harry says. With a yell and his blood thundering in his veins, he twists his upper body and rams his shoulder into Ron's chest with all of his might, pushing him down on the ground.
Startled, Draco blinks. "A no to what?" The minute the words come out, he gets it, a second too late.
"Sounds like you've got it all planned out," Draco croaks. Potter's answer is a coy smirk. Draco watches as Potter snaps open drawer after drawer on the bedside dresser until he pulls out a tube of lube. He squirts some on his palm and rubs his hands together. When Potter wraps both palms around his cock and starts to lube him up, Draco moans and thrusts his hips.
Hermione nods. She passes Rose to Ron. He cradles her in his arms, and when Rose gazes at him with her bright blue eyes and wraps a small hand around his index finger, Ron chokes back a sob.
Harry frowns at the familiarity of the voice. How did he not notice this earlier? This discovery only spurs him on, and he leaves his flat. He hesitates in front of his neighbour’s door, suddenly feeling rather shy. Before he loses his nerve, he knocks, heart thudding with anticipation and a welcoming smile on his lips.
Malfoy makes a restrained sound under his breath, and looks away from Harry’s searching gaze. “We’re here. The High Line,” he declares, gesturing to the setting with an outstretched arm.
. A shiver rackets up Potter’s spine, and he gasps out Draco's name, a string of vulgarities, and finally, a long, drawn-out moan until he breaks off into a sharp, choked cry.
Hermione clears her throat and puts her half-eaten brownie down. "It's been a month since they've opened, and you've never really visited them."
Potter takes a moment to respond. "Yeah." He wriggles his hips, and Draco hisses when another inch of his cock sinks in. "More, give me more, I want it all."
"Yeah. It's been a long time since you were with another bloke.” Harry coats his fingers and drops the lube on the other side of the bed. He shuffles forward, capturing Malfoy's lips in a chaste kiss. He pets Malfoy’s rim, circling it.
"Fine. I'll cash in that fuck when you're done then. Come back when you're ready," Malfoy huffs in frustration and takes a step towards the door.
A blush suffuses his cheeks when Harry slides the ring on his finger. Draco is wearing a smile wide with happiness. They've been together for three and a half years. They've enjoyed blissful times and weathered through the thistles and thorns of their rough patches.
"How much for another night?" Draco blurts out, his hands bunching into fists underneath the covers.
A part of him feels that there should be more words, perhaps a heartfelt speech to accompany this exchanging of rings, but how can he translate the beats of his heart and the spirit of his soul into words that perfectly capture his all-consuming love for Harry?
Draco had spent too much time at Hogwarts observing Potter to miss that. His smirk still in place, he rests his right palm on the table, slides his left hand into his pocket and crosses his legs at the ankles. He's envisioned this scenario so many times in his head, aiming for the epitome of cool and collected, suave and smooth, although the pounding of his heart indicates the opposite.
,” he says around a moan, biting his lower lip as his hungry gaze follows the circuit of his hands; he skims his palms across Potter’s shoulders, the slopes of his chest, the pebbled nipples below a tight white T-shirt, finally down to the tense muscles of his abdomen. He brings his hands up to frame the sides of Potter’s jaw, before abruptly removing his glasses.
Malfoy finally breaks the silence by pointing at a quieter and shaded spot looking west towards the Hudson River. "I often write my songs there."
He throws his hands up in the air, roars and storms out of Sugarcoated. He dimly notices Hermione passing a handful of coins to Ron, but he's already out the door. With his head full of steam, Harry barges into Sin and barks, "Where's Malfoy? Where the hell is he?"
Harry frowns at the non-sequitur. Shrugging, Malfoy plucks a cherry from his drink, holds it between his teeth and moves closer to Harry. His heart thudding hard and fast in his chest, Harry leans in and bites on half of the cherry. They both chew and swallow, their lips grazing against each other, but before Harry can move away, Malfoy's got his hand around the back of Harry's neck and he's
Harry indicates it with a thumb. "Ten minutes, yeah? Any longer I'm gonna come out and drag you to my bed, I swear." He reluctantly leaves Malfoy to it and retreats to his bedroom. He's hard and ready to go, but Malfoy's being such a fucking tease. Harry strips and steps into the shower, turning the water to the coldest that he can handle. That should take care of his erection, but Harry can't resist it; he stands with his eyes closed and forehead resting against his forearm braced against cool tiles, water sloshing down his back while his hand strokes himself between his legs... he knows he should stop because the object of his fantasies is so near, but fuck, it feels so damn good...
"Getting weak in your old age, Potter?" Draco quips, but his smirk melts into an expression of pleasure when Potter slicks his cock with a single stroke of his tongue.
properly. He had no references, and he was particularly good with snakes, as if he could talk to them.
Instead of answering, Malfoy chuckles dryly and Summons a bottle of wine and a glass. He settles on the couch and makes a good show of pouring the wine out. Swirling his glass slowly, Malfoy places his chin in his palm and rakes his eyes all over Harry, as if he's seeing Harry for the first time.
"Yes. Figured you had enough of hunting Dark wizards for the rest of your life," Malfoy replies, and there it is again, that small smile gracing his lips.
With every passing day, Draco’s reliance on Dreamless Sleep dwindles. His blond roots grow out, and the blackness of his hair lightens to a chestnut brown. The effect looks rather bizarre, but Harry is pleased because of its significance.
But Malfoy certainly isn't complaining. He closes his eyes and throws his head back, exposing his gulping throat as he rocks back and forth on his knees, moving on top of Harry in perfect rhythm. "Harry. Fuck, thought about this so much…"
Harry listens, amazed, as Malfoy flies into a jealous snit, picking apart a few of his exes — flings or proper relationships — that the media probably mentioned. He follows up each name with a reason as to why they never worked out or outright insults (some of which were quite witty, in fact, he said Oliver Rivers, a Ravenclaw they knew at the Academy, had the manners of a Flobberworm and the face of a Grindylow when he was angry, which honestly wasn't that far off).
"Come on, then." Draco kisses the top of his head. He lets Draco drag him into the shower. They make it quick, and it's not long before they're back in bed again.
"I was trying to excuse us politely! Did I actually do anything to encourage him, you hopeless git? And you're one to talk. If you'd care to remember, I've only got two more ex-boyfriends than you," Draco shot back with an eyebrow arched in challenge. "And you know I've only got eyes for you, you idiot!"
"Unhand me, you ruffian!" Malfoy demands. He's trying to push Harry away, but Harry's not having any of it.
Draco’s sessions with Alicia are scheduled for Monday afternoons and Friday mornings, and Harry keeps himself free for a while after those sessions, just in case Draco doesn’t want to be alone. When some nights are particularly bad, Harry talks to him on the phone, even though his own eyes are closing and his voice has tapered off into sleepy mumbles.
He grins at the glazed-over look in Potter’s eyes — no doubt he’s imagining that very scene. He slides off Potter’s legs, and they scramble up from the floor, stumbling through tables until they reach their destination. Potter loses his shirt on the way, adding on to the snaking trail of clothes left in their wake.
“No,” Potter insists. “Need to lay you out, have a good look. I can go again soon, I know.” He picks up his shirt, wipes Draco’s back, and leads him to the Slytherin table, which is nearest to the windows and sconces. Potter motions for him to sit on the edge of the table. He steps into the space between Draco’s thighs and kisses him. After a moment, he pulls away, looking more composed. “It’s been so long since we’ve shagged, that’s why it was quick.” He kisses Draco’s forehead. “But it’s your birthday, I wanna make it really good for you. I can go again soon, just wait for a bit.”
"Hey, it's not so bad. I got a dinner date with the bloke of my dreams, so..." Potter says breezily, grinning at Draco.
“Draco, there’s no need to be so cautious. Harry’s a good bloke, although he can be too impulsive. Come to think about it, you two balance each other out rather well,” Charlie says, with a patient smile. “Sometimes, you just have to close your eyes, let go and… fall.”
She waits ten minutes before packing her textbooks away and stepping out of Sugarcoated. Across the road, Parkinson is waving a customer out, and when the door opens, Hermione locks eyes with Parkinson, holds her gaze, jerks her head meaningfully towards Sugarcoated and re-enters the bakery without sticking around for Parkinson's answer.
Potter laughs. "Where’s the fun in that?" He mounts the bike, holding Draco’s gaze as he puts on his helmet. "Coming, old man? If not, I’ll wait for you there while you take a leisurely stroll. D’you need a walking cane?"
Potter's full-lashed lids dip downwards, and he smacks his lips, his tongue darting out to catch a drop of pre-come. Finally, he lifts his gaze to meet Draco's, his thumbs smoothing over the vee of Draco's thighs.
Harry knows he fucking nailed it, and this is proven when Malfoy and Matt enter the room a mere fifteen minutes later.
A noxious cocktail of jealousy, resentment and disappointment flares in Draco at the memory of opening the paper and seeing details of Potter’s love and sex life splashed on the gossip pages. Whenever he saw it, he would storm into his room for an angry wank.
Time passes by while they both catch their breath. Harry faintly registers the clatter of a wand and Malfoy's magic washing over him, cleaning him up. He tangles his legs with Malfoy's and pulls him in, their kisses unfurling and melting in his mouth like powdered sugar, warming his body as though he's sipping on sunshine.
When the wisp of silvery light loses shape and fades, Draco summons it again, excitement thrumming in his veins. He breaks into a thrilled grin when his semi-corporeal Patronus appears. He can't discern the exact animal, as it dissipates as quickly as it emerges, but from what he can see, his Patronus isn't a large one, probably about the length of his forearm. The glowing light bobs briefly in the air, flapping a wing.
Malfoy dissolves into an incoherent mess, the tendons on his neck standing out like cords as Harry pounds into him. He lowers his head, burying his face into the crook of Harry’s shoulder, his chest heaving and body jerking forward with each slam of Harry’s cock.
"I could. For you, I could," Draco says, happiness playing a symphony in his heart when a smile, as bright and hopeful as summer, settles on Potter’s face.
Harry can't go back to that anymore, because now he wants more, so much more. He laughs, a cold and hard sound of pain masked as anger. "I just want to be with you. Why is that so difficult?"
"Good. I can assure you of one thing: the others — Matthew, Alex, Jacob — have nothing to do with this."
Grunting, Potter rolls over on top of Draco and promptly covers Draco's mouth with his own. The weight of Potter's build — solid and comforting — is perfect for grounding Draco down to earth after that amazing orgasm. Draco sighs happily and wraps his arms around Potter's shoulders, returning the kisses with gusto.
, he loves how Potter’s legs fall apart, leaving enough space for him to step in between them. He dips his fingers into the cream and lifts them to Potter's mouth. Potter's half-lidded eyes peer up at him through his tousled fringe, holding Draco's gaze as he laps the cream up. Draco licks his lips at the delectable sight, and then breaks off a chunk of tart and feeds that to Potter too.
"I finished my final year after the War and left Hogwarts a year ago," Harry doesn't miss how Malfoy's left arm tenses when he mentions the War, and quickly steers the conversation back to Quidditch.
Harry leans forward to peck Draco on the lips before withdrawing, and Draco smiles when he sees that Harry’s face is engulfed in a lovely pink glow of a blush.
"Fuck, Draco." Desire and lust floods Harry’s system, so powerful and strong that his heart clenches. He rolls them over until he’s on top. He drives himself into Malfoy, fucking him hard until Malfoy's chanting his name like a prayer, his neck and chest engulfed in a deep blush as he wanks. And when Harry hits that spot one last time, Malfoy shouts wordlessly, punching the bed and spurting all over his stomach.
Thanks to Hermione, Draco knows Potter is home. He remembers her frown when she mentioned how reticent Potter has been for the past week, after their disastrous last session.
Malfoy flutters his lashes, smouldering up at him, and Harry's heart does a silly little somersault. He wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, pulling him forward until his elbows land on the bed. Malfoy whispers into his ear, his voice as intimate and promising as the rustling bedsheets. "Fuck me until I can still feel you in me tomorrow morning."
Despite himself, Draco smiles. He stiffens when Potter moves behind him to wrap his arms around his waist. He inches up on his toes to nip at Draco’s earlobe.
Harry glances at the visitors of the park again. It's not a new sensation — feeling alone in a crowd of people, on the outside looking in. The sharp sting of loneliness is familiar, intensified by the nature of his work. Once again, he finds his gaze gravitating towards Malfoy, who is sitting a short distance away. He appears to be writing a song — tinkering with a few chords and humming as he studies a piece of paper with scribbled words. He picks up a pencil, writes something down, and whispers something under his breath repeatedly. Annoyed, he purses his lips and crosses the lyrics out, before strumming a string of chords. He tucks a lock of black hair behind his ear; his earrings are different today, two small silver hoops instead of the studs.
"Yes, you're a Malfoy, and you were a Death Eater. I'm not gonna ignore that, because I will never deny your past." He takes Draco's hands into his own. "But you're also a survivor, a musician, a performer. And you…” Harry’s heart is pounding hard in his chest with every confession. “You’re the blond in my paintings, my inspiration, my muse. I meant what I said that day, when we had that row in your New York flat. I'd need time, but I'll take all of you, I'd take all of your past and your mistakes and I could love you. In fact, I think I'm almost there." He swallows the lump in his throat, his insides feeling rather raw. "You're the Draco that I've fallen in… in love with." Warmth floods Harry's cheeks when Draco's eyes widen.
"What's the matter with you? It's a simple question," Draco says, his brows drawn together as he joins Theo at the coffee table, sitting cross-legged on the floor beside him. Theo lifts his head, closes his book and accepts Draco's offer of post-dinner beverage — a glass of red wine.
word. It's just a matter of helping each other out. Without me, you would have taken ages more to solve your case."
"This bike rides like a charm." Potter glances back, his eyes sparkling with a playful glint. "Speaking of charms, Arthur Weasley modified the bike. Improved invisibility and flying charms, that kinda thing." He pauses. "D'you wanna see the dragonfire shooting out from the exhaust?"
Harry had repaid Ron by feeding him his body weight in pies and tarts and cakes, something that he's
Draco stays completely still; he doesn't push any further, but neither does he pull out. Instead, he hushes Potter with soft kisses and murmured words of comfort. When Potter's body relaxes, Draco continues that sweet, steady thrust until he's almost all in.
"We'll have to be careful because it's headquarters, so you're posted undercover this time round," Kingsley says, and once again Harry spots that smirk twitching on his lips.
Harry lifts a hand, wanting to say something and do anything to close the gaping distance between them. He opens his mouth, but his voice wilts and shrivels away when he realises he can’t find the words to erase the disbelief scrawled over Draco’s features.
Pansy... well... she had thoroughly enjoyed herself. "Yeah, Potter, do it like that. That's how he likes it," she had growled under her breath as she watched Potter reach with both hands to grab Draco's arse.
Potter asked, eyes wide in mock innocence. Draco got so hard; he loves it whenever Potter goes all student-teacher on him.
“Mmm.” Draco pouts. “You don’t seem to want it enough.” He curves his lips into a coquettish grin, lifts the glasses up, and then slowly licks along the length of the arm. He laughs, low and gravelly, when Potter presses the heel of his palm against his own cock.
George inches away from Harry (the drizzle falling on Harry is getting heavier) and clears his throat.
"The things I do for you…" Draco says, releasing a dramatic, long-suffering sigh. Harry beams, his gaze falling to Draco’s lips. Grey eyes dart around them—Draco's usually wary of kissing in public—but it's fairly quiet, except for a few other couples and a family in the distance.
Frank's voice cuts sharply through the heated air of moans and pants, and their bubble of lust pops.
“That’s from a fifth-year Ravenclaw,” Harry explains. “She strolled into class wearing only that and the shortest shorts you’ve ever seen.” Malfoy darts an embarrassed glance at him, before returning his attention to the clothes.
"You're taking this awfully calm.” Harry frowns suspiciously at Ron. "According to you, I just flirted with Malfoy, and you're saying that he's alright with that."
"Yeah." Harry nods. "But it's worth it. For you.” Malfoy looks down, trying to hide the smile spreading across his face, and Harry continues. “Plus you’ve had to sacrifice too," he says, thinking of Lucius Malfoy's fury and the scandal splashed over the papers. "I love travelling, exploring new places and cultures. But it'd mean so much more if you’re with me. We could do it for leisure. I could show you the world. Places like Hawaii, Malta, New Zealand," he says hopefully.
"Have you tried this position before?" Harry asks, his breath leaving him in short gasps as he bounces on Draco's cock. Draco grunts — he can barely talk — and shakes his head, snaking an arm around Harry's waist. His other hand stays firmly on the bed for support.
while he does his homework in the Slytherin dorms; no longer in the Great Hall or in the library because those are places where he risks running into Potter. He tries to forget Potter and the love bites strewn all over his tanned skin, but he can’t, because whenever Draco looks into the mirror, he remembers Potter’s own love bites all over his pale skin like scattershot lipstick marks.
After all, Draco would never invest so much time and energy into something that wouldn't directly benefit him.
Draco lifts a shoulder in a half-shrug. He reaches over his side of the couch and retrieves Harry's Christmas present.
There’s warm hands rubbing his shoulders in circles, lips pressing soft kisses on the back of his neck in between snatches of what Draco dimly registers is French.
"If I told you I've been wanking myself raw to the thought of you fucking me, you still won't top?" He feathers kisses along Potter's jawline. "Imagine this, you on top of me, panting and thrusting so hard, so
Someone else calls Liam's name. The older man waves at his friend, and then turns back to Harry. "It's great to see you again, but I have to take my leave. All the best in Singapore, and I will see you again when you visit Switzerland," he says, clapping Harry on the shoulder.
Draco’s cock throbs. He aches to cover the distance between them, climb into Potter’s lap and grind into him while snogging the living daylights out of him. Worse still, he has a feeling that Potter absolutely wouldn’t mind.
Draco looks up when Potter approaches, his tray of inks floating in the air behind him. He sits down on a wheelie chair and arranges his tattooing paraphernalia—tattoo machines, alcohol wipes, ointments, plastic wrap and other inks—on the table. He pulls on surgical gloves and asks Draco, "How are you feeling?"
Sighing, Harry holds Draco by the wrists and pries his hands away from his face. Draco finally looks up at him, his eyes midnight with sadness.
Malfoy stares at him for a long moment, his head shaking in disbelief and his mouth opening and closing, at an utter loss of what to say. He eventually lets out a cold, hard laugh that curls viciously at the corners, and Harry glares at him. It’s clear that Malfoy is controlling his temper — the ramrod tightness of his body, paired with his flinty stare. "Not everything revolves around you, Potter. I shall escort you to your quarters and we will never speak of this again."
Draco freezes for a split second and pulls away, his heart flipping right over and dropping like a boulder. Potter looks utterly stricken, as if he’s said something that he’s kept inside for a long time but still wishes he could take it back the minute it’s out. Salazar, Potter looks utterly gorgeous, his lips a lush red from all the kissing, inky scrawls of black hair all over the place and dazed eyes blinking behind smudged glasses.
Harry casts a privacy charm, aware of the cubicles around them. Theo raises his eyebrows at the spell, but says nothing. Harry chooses his next words carefully. "If one were to... get on his good side, what does one have to do?"
It wasn't there earlier today — Draco must've taken it out while Harry had left the house for his run. When he returned, Draco had unpacked some of his old things — his clothes were in the wardrobe, his books and magazines were unloaded, while his iPod was charging at its usual place — and placed some new things such as a fresh set of towels and toiletries. After this discovery, Harry hovered around the closed door of the study, wanting to knock and say something, but gave up eventually.
"I am familiar with those terms, and I am aware of their convenience, but I'd rather stick to owls," Draco says, sniffing.
"So big, so hard for you, Potter. I've never been this big for anyone before. It's all because of you. Feel that?"
Draco looks at the lightning-bolt scar on Potter’s forehead, the mark that has defined his life's trajectory. Draco turns his arm, revealing his faded Dark Mark. "I've made many mistakes. Mistakes that filled me with regret and guilt, but they're my mistakes. They shaped me, moulded me into who I am today." Draco traces a fingertip over the slithering snake of his Mark. "My mother couldn't stop crying on the night I took my Mark."
“I sure hope not, because your glasses were in fashion sometime in the last century,” Draco says. “Are you alright?” He bends down in front of Potter and returns his glasses. Potter shrugs and puts them on, and then as quick as a whip, there are hands pulling at Draco’s shirt, tugging it up over his head and then flinging it away. He’s now half-naked — he shivers as green eyes caress his bare chest and stomach — and straddling Potter, his knees on either side of Potter’s hips.
They peer through the kitchen window just in time to see Harry toss his head back and let out a frustrated roar.
He turns his attention to Malfoy, who looks away at once, as if caught staring. "I'll talk to her later, figure out what's going on. She might be lonely, but she shouldn’t be harassing students." A twinge of guilt rises in Harry — maybe it’s his fault, he has been busy recently.
He casts an Impervius charm to chase away dew and leftover rain, and spreads a thick blanket on the ground, settling down. The only thing that’s missing is a piping hot cup of tea, but he’ll have that for breakfast later. The long branches of the tree form a protective arch above him, and the rustling leaves cast shifting patterns of light over green grass.
Weasley had been an absolute mess, hunched over his table and sobbing in the dark. Upon Draco’s arrival, he had looked up and wiped his eyes and nose hurriedly. He gestured to the cake in front of him, explaining in halting words and stilted breaths.
Draco stretches up and drags his tongue across Harry's bottom lip before pulling away and shaking his head. "I know you like it like this."
s. "There's even a photo." He shows Draco half of a photo. It's a picture of a burbling Potter gleefully zooming along on a toy broomstick, narrowly missing a vase while an older man, the spitting image of Potter, chases him with frantic, outstretched arms.
The air is musty and still, the atmosphere grim and quiet, and the colours of the room are in dull tones of brown, grey and green. It feels like this place doesn't see the light of day.
Draco regains his composure and throws the shirt behind him. The enchanted bag jumps up, catching the discarded item.
Potter chuckles. "Sounds about right." He pauses. "She told me you're leaving London for work soon. Are you coming back?"
That's why the place is called Sin, Hermione realises as she licks at the chocolate, because their treats are rich, decadent, extravagant and entirely sinful.
"Then don't go. Stay in bed with me today and we can do it all over again," Draco pleads when Potter reaches round to grab at his arse. "When can I see you again?"
As the music starts to wind down, Malfoy slides two fingers in his mouth and gives them a brief suck as his hips grind hard on Harry's cock. With his palms braced on the floor, Malfoy swings back up smoothly and hops off Harry's lap with a flourish, drawing a disappointed groan from the club. In response, Malfoy throws them a wink and a pout. He bends down to grip the back of Harry's chair and motions for Harry to get up.
Grey eyes darken with intent. "Look at me. You always come so hard when you're looking at me." He resumes sucking Harry with renewed vigour, his tongue painting broad, slick stripes up and down his cock. Harry gulps as he sears this image into his memory—Malfoy's hollowed-out cheeks, messy hair, eyes hooded with lust and fluttering lashes, his plump lips wrapped around his cock and tongue peeking out as he swirls it along Harry’s cock.
This will be his last night here, in Serpentes. Harry absorbs the atmosphere — the bright lights, loud music, the intoxicating sense of liberation that this place has offered... He feels the texture of the smooth wooden bar counter under his fingertips and closes his eyes, imprinting this exact moment in his mind. He flexes his muscles — this would be the last time he'll be in Dan's body. It's been rather nice having a body like this, but Harry can't wait to get back into his own body permanently.
His heart sinks all the way down to his shoes as he plods back to the bench. Who was he kidding? It couldn't have been Harry.
"Live a little, Draco!" Harry says, throwing his head back and cheering. He faces the front and cavorts onwards, doing a little jig.
“It’s beautiful,” Marjorie remarks, her eyes widening and her words tinged with awe. “Wow. He looks so happy, so… wow.”
Malfoy gapes at Harry, flustered. "You mean… Like a date? But all that stuff you said about your work..."
"Wait, Weasley.” Malfoy snaps his fingers at the chip tray, and a handful of chips jump onto Ron's plate. He blinks at the addition, while Malfoy raises a shoulder in a lazy shrug. "Fresh out of the fryer."
Draco looks at a name on the parchment — Ellie Barker. He can't help the small beam of pride tugging on his lips as he remembers Ellie, a shy, petite Slytherin (one of his own!) —
Bacon flicks his tongue at the other room. "But we can work on this. Once you become a stripper, you'll have a lot more access to the back areas. We might find other useful clues then."
“No,” he says, his voice hard and authoritative. He’s using his teacher voice on Harry, and that’s mad sexy. Malfoy leisurely unloops his tie from his collar, trailing the silky material over Harry’s throbbing cock, triggering an excited gasp from Harry. “You do not touch yourself when I’m with you.” He unbuttons his shirt, his demeanour calm, but the trembling of his fingers reveals his nervousness and eagerness.
Harry nudges his glasses up his nose. "Hey," he says, leaning over, the distance between them roughly three arms' lengths. "How long have you been watching me for?" he teases, his smile spreading when Malfoy’s cheeks flush.
Instead of looking surprised, like what Draco expected, Potter looks rather pleased with himself. "Didn't know you've been watching me like this.”
He's been too distracted today to turn out his usual number of desserts. The only thing he's managed is Harry's treacle tart. It had been wonderful, watching Harry eat his treacle tart for the first time — he had taken one bite, moaned in sheer joy and cradled the plate of treacle tart lovingly in his hands with a dreamy expression on his face.
"You suggest adding treacle tart to our menu, and then Potter comes over and practically drools at it. It can't be a coincidence. If you two are planning something again, I swear-"
The moment Draco withdraws from Pansy's arms, Harry engulfs him in an embrace so strong that he staggers back. Draco laughs and noses into Harry’s neck, inhaling his vanilla scent and discreetly pinching himself to ensure that this isn’t a dream. Harry's lips graze his jawline, ending in a kiss. "You're finally home," he whispers before releasing him.
"Thank you for loving me," Harry murmurs. He wraps his arms around Draco and pulls him close. He smells Draco's familiar vanilla scent, and his heart clenches.
He could've phrased things more delicately, but he's terrible with words. Hermione would do a much better job, and in that moment, he feels a sharp pang of longing for her ever-practical advice and Ron's supportive presence. If only he could talk to them about Draco.
“Yes. But it’s…” Something softens in Malfoy’s eyes, and his next words send Harry’s heart beating faster. “It’s different when there’s someone to enjoy the sights with you.”
Whatever remnants of Draco's control that has been cracking at the seams throughout the night shatters just like the lamp, and Draco goes to fucking
Harry apologises to his customers. "Would you like to try our newest treat?" He offers, shooting a winning smile at them as he gestures to the chewy fudge chocolate brownies. The mother pauses, but her daughter tugs her sleeve and shakes her head, making her blonde pigtails bounce from side to side.
"You've learnt some new moves," Malfoy remarks. His chest and neck still bear the remnants of his full-blown body blush, and Harry knows it’ll take some time for it to fade.
Potter moves as if to shift the table, but Draco sits down on the sofa and places his briefcase nearby. He pats the space beside him. Potter furrows his eyebrows in question, but plops down beside Draco.
"Thanks for today. It was fun," he says, before adding, with a hopeful smile on his face, "Maybe… maybe we could go to Shake Shack soon?"
"Porks." Harry sighs. "C'mon, Porks. Don't be like this. You know I hate it when we fight." He sits beside her and runs a hand down the top of her head, before stroking the base of her belly — she loves it when he pets her like this. Her tongue flicks out at the reconciliatory gesture, and her eyes flutter closed. After a while of petting, she butts her head against his arm affectionately (albeit a bit harder than usual). He heaves her up in his arms, and then carries her to the bed, where they lay in repose for a moment.
cherries... I'll worship you anytime, any day," Harry snarls, grinning against Malfoy's skin when his hips speed up jerkily at Harry's words. "I'll worship you when I'm down on my knees."
,” Potter growls, his voice low and guttural as he picks up the punishing pace. "Look at you take it. You're made for this, made to take this big cock—"
he'll be dancing for the crowd!" Jacob exclaims, looking surprised. "Draco and Matt," — he indicates the man with red hair talking to Malfoy — "will be the judges. We're all
Harry's fidgeting — his fingers lacing and unlacing, while his right foot is tapping out a rhythm on the wooden floor. Although Draco is looking straight ahead, he can see Harry shooting him glances in his peripheral vision. Draco's about to ask him about it when Harry blurts out, "I wanted to kiss you that day. In Paris. In the rain." His grin softens into a dreamy smile. "I loved seeing you like that."
"Yeah." Harry summons a box of photographs of his previous works, pulling out a stack of pictures — highlights of his final year exhibition, the one that he had to pass to leave art school. "The Slytherins came too.”
But Harry's not scared. He knows, with all the certainty in the world, that they will find their way back to each other.
"Looks like someone likes it messy," Draco manages through a shaky breath. He exhales heavily and lines his cock up with Potter's entrance. Knowing that he'll be in Potter in seconds... Draco almost comes right then and there. He starts to push in, slow and gentle. The head of his cock slips in easily enough. It's snug, but Draco's prepared him well enough.
He releases a short bark of laughter. Malfoy is still as prim and proper as ever, and his current hairstyle reminds Harry of their sixth year, loose, not slicked back like at the Academy. He’s put on a bit of weight too, no doubt due to the lavish meals at Hogwarts, but he wears it well. Harry likes how he looks now, more approachable and less pointy. It’s clear that teaching suits Malfoy; he looks so at ease in Hogwarts.
As the weeks pass, Potter showers Draco with thoughtful gifts such as a box of his favourite tea, quills with special ink-erasing feathers and his favourite caramel nougats from Honeydukes. The small presents matched none of the showiness of the roses that started it all, except for…
“Turns you on, doesn’t it? Doing it here?” Draco whispers when Potter hoists himself up to sit on the table. “In twelve hours, this place will be full with your colleagues and friends for lunch, but now it’s just two of us here, on a Sunday night, where I’m gonna blow you—“
snake is." She pauses, lifting her tail and tapping its tip onto her head as if she's thinking. "Do you think he sounds like a dying Hippogriff, like you, when you're touching your
With that desire lodged in his mind, Draco closes his eyes, opens his mouth wide, ignores his  aching jaw and pushes in just a bit more. His tongue swirls around the girth as his throat works to swallow Potter down, and it's so overwhelming, having Potter’s entire length in his mouth as he sucks and sucks and
"You like it, Harry? Like how I'm giving it to you, my tongue going in circles at the tip before I take you deeper, my tongue spiralling down to the base of your cock before I suck you properly?" The words spill out in an unhurried drawl, and Harry can't wait—
"I don't care,” Harry snarls, spinning around to face him. "I don't care, because I can't stay. I've had enough, I'm done, done with… with…" He punches the wall in frustration. “I'm gonna spend the night at Hogsmeade and then talk to Kingsley at the Ministry first thing tomorrow morning."
"Then I must be selfish too, because I want you all to myself. What if you don't return to Hogwarts next year? What if you find someone out there, in the city who is more interesting than me?"
Potter laughs, and Draco is instantly transported to that pub night with their fellow Auror trainees in the Leaky — Potter pushing him up against the wall of the loo, arms snaking their way around Draco's waist, hands going down to squeeze his arse as he swept him into a kiss so intense that Draco's toes curled in his boots. Shock and disbelief pounding through him that it was Potter kissing him like this, holding him like this, Draco's hands trailing up Potter's abdomen, gasping at his taut stomach and warm skin. The taste of alcohol on Potter’s breath, but the lucidity in green eyes told Draco that they were both sober enough, what this meant—
Potter leads the way, and they walk along a bustling street, passing by Muggle clothing stores and coffee shops, before they stop in front of a pub called
When he was a young boy, he would greet every Christmas present, birthday present and sweets from home with greedy eyes and eager hands that tore at wrapping and bows. He'd descend into temper tantrums — complete with balled-up fists and foot-stamping — when told to wait.
He thrusts the letter into Harry's hands. Although he hopes he looks composed, the ramping up of his heartbeat and the inability to meet Harry's gaze head-on might indicate the opposite. He takes the chance to check Harry out while he's reading the letter: same untamed mop of black hair, same glasses and dress sense — jeans ripped at the knees and a faded
"You still need to eat, yeah?" Potter cajoles. “Plus, I’ve got your favourite chocolate croissants from Magnolia. I passed by the shop this morning.”
"Yeah. Don't you see it?" Harry says, his words increasing in volume and vehemence. "It was a stroke of luck that we survived the war even though we were on opposing sides. Why did McGonagall decide for all eighth years to stay together, which made us closer? Why did Seamus skip that detention, which led to our first kiss?" He chucks Minnie Mouse to the other side of the sofa and moves closer to Malfoy. "I visited so many countries, met so many people, but I didn’t find anyone that felt right.
Draco clears his throat, looking away. "I believe the shower is there," he says, indicating the en-suite. Potter nods and hurries away.
Draco’s mouth waters, the sight of Potter indulging in a slow wank triggering a hot sear of arousal deep in his belly.
Speaking of tattoos, he saw Potter's last tattoo on his left thigh. It was of four animals—a large stag with impressive antlers, a black dog, a phoenix with a vibrant plumage and a snowy owl with stretched wings and a penetrating gaze. Draco knew they were Hedwig and Fawkes, Dumbledore's pet, and Potter told him that the stag and the dog represented his father and godfather.
Malfoy gets into bed, leaning back on the large pillows. He grins, pulls Harry down on top of him and draws him into a kiss, his breath smelling like mint.
All the Frenchmen he's dated... they’ve all looked like Potter: messy, scruffy black hair; eyes framed with glasses (he's never found anyone with Potter's combination of black hair and forest green eyes); crooked smile and tanned skin matched with fiery tempers.
“How do you always know where I am?” Draco asks, his pulse racing at the sight of the other boy. That’s something he’s always wondered about ever since their… arrangement, which consisted of Draco waiting in an empty classroom at night and Potter turning up unerringly in said classroom.
"You told me about this song and hummed it a few times before, while I held you after your nightmares. Last month after the funerals, when we went to the Manor, I found a book of French lullabies containing the lyrics. I learnt it from there." Harry uses the hem of his shirt to wipe away the sweat on the sides of Draco's face. "Did my singing make you feel better? Well, I wouldn't really call that singing, but..." Harry chuckles.
and that knowledge is enough to make Draco come all over Potter's hand, but this time, he doesn't come screaming Potter's name, partly because he's gone half-hoarse, so Draco whispers
"Nothing wrong with that, yeah?" Harry runs his lips down the side of Malfoy's waist. "Wanna please you."
Seconds tick by as they sit there on a park bench in a dark and snowy night, their tongues tied and their faces glowing with pink blushes.
Self-conscious, Draco clears his throat and looks down, relaxing his clenched fists and planting his palms on the edge of the bench. He uncrosses his ankles. “My apologies. Was I ranting? I didn’t mean to bore you.”
"Yes," Potter chokes out that single word, his grip tightening on Draco's fingers as he lifts his head off the pillow. He's so damn beautiful with those gorgeous green eyes brimming with lust, the blush on his cheeks, and the small shy smile on his thin lips. His heart expanding, Draco brushes the sweat off the sides of Potter's face.
Draco leans back on his chair, spreads his thighs and palms his erection through his trousers. Hunger zings up and down his spine, and he gasps when his knuckles brush the sensitive underside of his cock. Licking his lips, Draco glances at the clock, his cock stiffening further when it's just two minutes to eleven. Two more minutes until he hears the voice of his sex dreams. He's spent the entire day waiting for eleven pm.
Humphrey must've salvaged that from the waste-paper bin. As if on cue, there's a flutter of wings, and the owl himself soars into the house. Humphrey looks back and forth between them.
He could say no, but he’s not going to do that. It would break Harry’s heart, and that choice doesn’t make sense because at some point in time, he would very much like to get married to Harry. He could say yes, but it just feels so…
Back at Grimmauld, more of Draco’s things appear — a toothbrush, an extra set of clothes, his favourite chocolates and ice-cream, his song-writing notebook and one of his guitars. Harry paints in his studio, while Draco writes his songs in the gallery beside him. When Harry asks him why he likes writing there, Draco looks up from his guitar, smiles and gestures to the artwork around him, saying that Harry’s paintings give him inspiration for his songs.
“It will. It has to,” Harry says desperately, opening his legs to grant Malfoy more space to kneel between them. This isn’t a dream. It’s really happening, right here, right now. He’s seconds away from having his cock sucked by Malfoy. “Please. Don’t make me wait. Been so long.”
“You know him, don’t you?” Marjorie perks up. “Are you an ex? He’s so mysterious about everything, as if he has some scandalous past.” She laughs, and then regards Harry with renewed interest. “I saw how he looked at you, and you could barely take your eyes off him. Are you his ex?”
"Would you like to see what I'm working on?" Malfoy offers rather shyly. Harry knows that it's not an offer to be taken lightly — when he's working on something new, he refuses to show it to anyone, even Ron and Hermione, before it's perfect.
"Would you like me to sneak into his room, see what he's doing, what he's wearing when he's alone?" Pork Chop offers with a cunning smile. "Perhaps he's touching himself right now, like how you do so often, and I could tell you how big
," Potter slurs, threading a shaky hand through his hair. Seconds tick by, and Draco waits for the other man to catch his breath, more than pleased with his own performance. He stands up, his palms sliding along the tops of Potter's thighs. Potter smiles and thumbs away the tears at the corners of Draco's eyes — that's how wide he had to open his mouth. Potter then engulfs him in a kiss that leaves Draco rather breathless himself, and this time, it's his turn to moan when warm, capable hands free his cock from his pants.
He grabs a book, and strolls towards the shores of the lake, trekking a familiar path leading to a secluded area under his favourite tree. He inhales and smiles at the fresh, earthy scent of the outdoors and the faint tang of last night’s short drizzle. He shields his eyes with a hand as he gazes at the sunlight glimmering off the surface of the lake. Ever since he was a student, this is his favourite place outdoors to read and enjoy his solitude, with a great view of the lake. Most of the students don’t wander out this far, too.
“Oh! I almost forgot about them,” Harry exclaims. He beckons for the other owls to join them, and within seconds, five owls of varying species and sizes surround Draco. Humphrey huddles close to Draco’s right shoulder. He nips Draco affectionately on the finger, puffs his chest out and flaps a wing towards Draco (nearly whacking him across the face), as if to tell the other owls,
Draco readjusts the napkin on his lap, his eye catching on the twinkling flowers beside him. He is reminded that this isn't just an ordinary Hogsmeade weekend; this is a date, a date with Harry Potter, the bloke that he's fancied for months.
It's almost second nature to Harry's body now — the bright glaring lights, the thumping bassline of the music guiding his dancing, the sensation of pure, unadulterated
Malfoy gathers his crumbs on the table and drops them on his empty plate, hesitating before he answers. “It would be quite hypocritical if I did, seeing that I prefer men, too.”
"That's alright. I have nothing to hide. I just have one last request of you," Malfoy says, his smirk fading as he looks down and fiddles with the corners of a cushion. "You've sent Aurors after me. Not to arrest me, but to watch over me, haven't you? You didn't have to do that, but I... appreciate it. I also know names involved in the trafficking ring, more names that I'm sure would have escaped your notice. Grant my mother and I further protection, and I will give you information. Can you promise me that?"
Thank you for reading, and I hope that you felt for Harry and Draco as much as I did while I was writing this <3
“Shall we go to the park?” Draco suggests. Harry agrees. When Rose lets out a soft cry, Harry bends down to hush her, while Draco fishes about in the bag, retrieving a soft toy in the shape of a whale. He passes it to Harry, who places it into Rose’s hands. She gurgles in happiness and settles down, poking the whale with a pudgy finger and hugging it to her chest.
Seconds pass, and doubt overcomes his enthusiasm. Harry presses his ear to the door; the only thing greeting him is a stony, eerie silence.
There was once when Alex had let slip, with downcast eyes and an air of embarrassment, that he was having difficulties paying rent and his mother's medical bills because he was the sole breadwinner of his family, including his little sister who had just started Hogwarts.
Potter scoots backwards and plops down on the bed, his face falling. He opens his mouth, probably to apologise — such a silly,
Frowning, Draco turns a dial on his Omnioculars to slow down the replay of last weekend’s Quidditch match between the Montrose Magpies and Puddlemere United. He locates Angus Campbell, twists another knob to zoom in on the Magpies Chaser and catches the stiff set of Campbell's shoulders and the grimace twisting his lips when he executes a sharp turn on his broomstick.
Feeling especially cheeky, Harry winks at Malfoy and drags his tongue slowly across the bottom of his upper lip, all the while locking eyes with Malfoy. Harry feels a hot surge of annoyance as Malfoy's face doesn't change. Snarling under his breath, Harry strides across the stage, his steps matching the rhythm of the song. The music's picking up now, both in volume and speed, and Harry syncs himself to the change — head thrown back and nodding to the beat, eyes closed, fingers buried in his messy hair, bottom lip popping out between teeth in a playful pout, wandering palms pressed against hips moving with increased urgency, almost of their own accord —
Malfoy sits down a few stools away. At a loss, Harry clears his throat and stares at the beads of condensation trickling down his glass. He rubs a fingertip on the well-worn grain of the table, and then darts a look at Malfoy, who glances at him at the same time. Malfoy frowns, a steely challenge sparking in his eyes. Harry lifts his chin and meets his gaze head-on, that familiar combative heat surging in him. If Malfoy wants him to leave, he’s going to be sorely disappointed.
“Fuck, Draco!” he shouts and releases a resigned sob, throwing his head back as his orgasm seizes him, so fucking intense. Starbursts of pleasure burst across his skin as he pulses deep into Malfoy, his hands fisted into the sheets as he continues to thrust weakly inside him. He moves one hand to the base of his cock, squeezing, intent on slicking Malfoy thoroughly with his come, Merlin, just the thought of that…
For the next two years, Draco would appraise the students, noticing their technique, leadership skills and character, along with their ability to handle pressure and conflict. After their final exams, he would send Robards a list of names that he recommends, along with reference letters for students that requested it from him.
He could Apparate to Portkey Central, but instead, he chooses to walk the few blocks there, soaking in the atmosphere of New York for one last time.
could understand. Harry had just as well admitted point-blank his true identity to Malfoy; and Malfoy clearly knows it, judging by the triumphant sparkle in grey eyes and his widening grin.
Swirls of black seep from the edges of the potion, and Draco groans in distress. Now, that is definitely not salvageable. His experiment with Canary Creams will just have to wait.
"I need... Need to fuck you now so bad, need to... I'd give anything, anything to come in you, need to come in you right now, fuck, take you on all on fours, I'd come so hard in you, fuck you so hard you'd feel me the morning after,
“I took over the Head of Slytherin position from Horace in my second year,” Draco says. “It was clear that Slytherins were still being discriminated against, which comes as no surprise after the War. It was horrid, seeing terrified first-years being sorted into Slytherin and most of the student population booing them. A bit like how it was when we were students,” he says, arching a brow at Potter.
He pulls the prototype towards him and continues from where he had left off, although he's still mulling over the sort of relationship Harry and Malfoy will have.
"Harry," Draco says out loud, the name echoing in the empty kitchen. It sounds strange, saying it when he isn't lost in the throes of sexual abandon.
messed me up." Her eyes dim in sadness, and Harry makes a soothing noise, refusing to let her wallow in the misery of her past life, before she entered the care of Charlie, and subsequently, Harry.
I’m very grateful to my beta, Mollie, for her invaluable advice and her contribution — the difficult conversation at Brooklyn Bridge — to the fic. I’m not American, but I spent two weeks in New York for a holiday in 2017, and that sparked my own inspiration for this story.
Draco tries to forget about Potter and his snow-lit Christmas kisses even though he can feel Potter’s heated gaze skewering the back of his neck in classes. He tries to forget about Potter and his forest-green eyes held wide and hopeful when he murmured
That night, neither of them slept well, tossing and turning, too aware of each other's proximity in the shared bed, lost in the thistles of their own thoughts, suppressed desires and mismatched expectations.
'cos you're the first one that he's approved. Everyone else that I take home, he just... er... chases them away."
"S'okay," Malfoy mumbles. "I was gonna come soon. Too good." He tugs Harry down, drawing him into a giddy kiss. Before he knows it, Malfoy rolls them around and pushes him onto the bed. He grins and climbs on top of Harry, straddling him just like that night at the common room.
Draco sinks to the bed, his heart falling all the way to his feet. He presses the heels of his hands on his closed eyes, exhaling heavily.
“No, not at all! It’s brilliant hearing this from you. That’s what I feel too, although I probably can’t express it as eloquently,” Potter says, and his earnest tone makes Draco look up.
to Potter when Patil's back was turned. She had glimpsed Potter's expression and sighed, "I know you've got issues, Harry, but we're not in school anymore. You've got to get over it."
Well, Malfoy does have lovely eyes, all grey, dangerous and fiery. Harry pushes down the sudden surge of jealousy at
Harry quickly pulls himself together and Vanishes the mess on the floor. He peers in the bedroom. Malfoy's lying on his back, fast asleep. He's still sprawled diagonally in bed, his head hanging off the edge, exposing his pale throat. Harry considers placing the water and Potion on his bedside table, but Harry really,
"And then I'd reward you by fucking you. Fucked you on this sofa that one night. You rode me and I watched that fantastic view of you fucking yourself on my cock, goddamn fuck yes! Touch yourself, yeah, just like what I'm doing..."
It's a cruel twist of fate to stumble on each other like this, three years later. To see his own desire and longing reflected in Malfoy, only for them to be yanked apart by reality and its expectations again. With vacant eyes, Harry gazes at the twinkling stars and the dark clouds, high up in the heavens that sold wishes.
Once again, he edges a discreet gaze towards his left, relishing the sight of Potter leaning forward in anticipation, looking at the Quidditch pitch with wide eyes. His body is as tense as a coiled spring; back hunched, elbows on his knees and hands curled into fists as the bob of his head follows the flight of the Seekers. When his hand clenches anxiously, his biceps flex, and Draco can’t help but bite his lower lip. His plain black T-shirt (Draco has no idea what the words
"I think we've waited long enough, haven't we?" Potter whispers against Draco's skin, his voice low and rough, eyes half-lidded and teeth nipping at Draco's neck. His tongue held between his teeth, Potter's lips tug up into a smirk, lazy and infuriatingly confident. He uses his other hand to pull off his glasses, tossing them down onto the coffee table with a flourish.
Draco wishes he could skip this last stage, collect his fee and call it a day. Maybe he'd wait for a few days before asking Potter out. But he knows, deep down, that he has to see this through.
They finally break apart when Potter straightens up, grabs Draco's right leg and bends it over Potter's shoulder. Draco's other leg automatically falls to the side, opening himself even wider to Potter. Potter's eyes are dark with desire as he trails a hot-blooded gaze all over Draco's body, hissing in approval when he sees how spread-open Draco is for him. Potter reaches out, his fingers ghosting over Draco's scars held sharp and shocking against the pale backdrop of his skin — his Azkaban serial number, down to the Dark Mark and the Sectumsempra marks.
" Bacon drawls. "Was that supposed to be a pointless rhetorical question? Because we both know that you totally want to fuck him!"
Quidditch players that Harry didn't even know were gay; and some businessmen that Harry knew by face but not by name. Harry looks towards the stage and squints at the snakes wrapped around the strippers. He recognises all three snakes, according to Bacon's descriptions and what the Aurors have seen during their previous raids.
They rear back from each other, startled. Harry blinks rapidly, his senses and surroundings clicking back into focus, as if released from a spell. Disappointed, he glares at her, who is busy elbowing Malfoy away for a good photo-taking spot.
As if privy to his thoughts, Potter pushes Draco away to bend down and remove his sneakers and socks before pulling off his jeans. He's about to lean back on Draco's chest, but appears to think twice. He instead plops down on the sofa and reaches over to grab Draco's arse to pull him closer. Potter blinks up at him, green eyes wide and slightly unfocused.
“I don’t know,” Harry says in a small voice. “But what I do know is that I love you too much to let you go.” He encircles Draco in a full-bodied hug, and right now, Draco knows that this is where he belongs forever, right here in Harry’s arms.
They trade longing sighs. Draco smiles when he considers what finally brought them together — a school year filled with midnight conversations, thoughtful gifts, a meddling castle and matchmaking faculty, a fire-breathing dragon and a cheeky Ashwinder.
A steaming mug of Earl Grey is on the table. Draco vaguely remembers finishing it — Harry must've topped it up while he was sleeping. There's a song playing on the wireless, and he’s drawn to Harry working in the kitchen. Draco discreetly re-arranges the blanket and rests his head on his arm to make it seem like he's sleeping, although he's actually admiring Harry in secret.
Harry grins. "I'll make it back. Don't worry. If it means seeing you again." He thinks of something and frowns, kicking himself for choosing the furthest and longest mission. "Two months is pretty long. What if things change?" he asks, thinking of Astoria Greengrass and Malfoy's parents.
A sharp click, a cold gust of wind gliding across his body, sending goosebumps erupting on his skin—
Draco spotted Hermione sneaking glances at the aquamarine ring on her finger for the rest of the night.
Harry raises an eyebrow and grins at the view. “Hey. Bloody amazing, coming home to this every night." He shrugs off his red Auror robes and strips down to his underwear, yawning all the while. “I’m absolutely knackered,” he complains and stretches his arms high above his head, wincing at the creaks of his spine.
"You talk as if we're done for the night," Potter says, pulling Draco closer and pressing his hand on his erection.
"Sorry," Harry says. He looks down at his cupped hand, at the small puddle of lube gathered in the centre of his palm. "Um." He looks at the nightstand, his cheeks warm with embarrassment. He’s tempted to wipe his hand on the sheets, but Malfoy might find that too graceless. "D'you think there'd be tissues there?"
Potter reaches behind him and taps on the forest tattoo. "The Forbidden Forest, where I died." He gestures to the Hogwarts tattoo with another hand. "Hogwarts, where I felt the most alive." He indicates the footprints. "And the two people that stayed with me, no matter what. They spent the earlier part of their lives saving mine." He chuckles. "Hermione cried when I showed her this tattoo, and even Ron got a little choked up."
Using his thumbs, Draco draws circles on Potter's hips, his teasing fingers ghosting past the bulge in Potter's trousers.
He despised the impression that he had left Potter with then: thin, filthy Azkaban rags draped over his gaunt body, greasy and tangled hair hanging limply down to his shoulders, chapped lips and eyes gone dull with defeat. That's why he had taken pains tonight with his appearance — he's kitted out in a bespoke, classic black three-piece suit. The jacket, with one button fastened around his waist, makes his shoulders seem broader than they actually are. A white silk pocket square is tucked on the chest of the jacket. He's wearing a white shirt and a checkered red tie under his waistcoat, and his black trousers are just the right cut to emphasise his height.
"I know," Harry says, gently pushing Malfoy’s hand away. "I'll go slow. Make you feel good real soon, hit that spot you like so much." He lines his prick up again and applies the same strategy that he did with his fingers; pushing in and out, before plunging deeper and easing out again, until he's entirely engulfed, his throbbing cock deep in Malfoy. It's fucking brilliant, with Malfoy feeling like the most luxurious, sensual silk wrapped around his cock. “Let go,” Harry says, gesturing to Malfoy’s arms. “Want your legs. Around me.”
The city lights of downtown London blaze in the far distance, set against the backdrop of deepening dusk that envelops the last few streaks of orange rays shining on the rooftop. The wood-panelled rooftop is cosy: to the side sits a coffee table littered with magazines and flanked by beanbag chairs and large cushions, perfect for an intimate get-together with friends. There's also a small reading nook facing the skyline of London — Draco sees a half-finished cup of coffee and a fluffy blanket tossed beside a pile of books. He catches a whiff of fresh herbs, and he turns to look at the small and well-tended garden blooming with herbs and flowers — most notably lilies.
They exit the restaurant, stepping out to the cool and crisp night air. Draco lets Potter lead the way.
"No, he's not seeing anyone. As for the second question, we both know Draco shows his feelings through actions, not words. Think, Harry, think. What has he done since you've been back?" Hermione explains with the patience of a saint.
As for the other qualities... a challenge, huh? Well, he can bloody well hold his ground with Malfoy, judging by their history. He puffs his chest out, before deflating at Theo's earlier words. "Hang on. I've got black hair," he says, patting his head as if to verify that. Theo laughs at the action. "And I'm shorter and rather scruffy too," he continues, running a hand along his jaw and the top of his throat, where a beard is beginning to form.
It’s clear that Potter’s anger is escalating, his eyes sharpening in combat, and scorn quivering in his voice. "Fuck you, Malfoy. You're gonna throw this back in my face? I'm still waiting for you to tell me why you fucking left the Academy!"
"Nooo," she whines, that single word emerging in a long, desperate hiss. "Don't take my pork chops away."
He just needs one desperate, wild night with Potter to get this... decade-long obsession out of his system. He had been content to live with it, to push it away into the trapdoor in his mind that guards all his dirty little secrets, but that was before the arrival of the invitation. Once so faraway and elusive, Potter is now here with Draco in the priciest Muggle hotel in London, the stage for one of the most exhilarating nights that Draco will ever experience.
"One day, I would like to return to the Manor," Draco mumbles after a long time, turning his face away to wipe his nose. A loud, quivering sigh, giving way to a voice brittle and rough around the edges. "To see their… their graves. I know you don't have pleasant memories of my ancestral home, but would you come with me, please?"
As the last car speeds away from the stretch of road separating them, Draco readies himself yet again for battle. Grey eyes lock onto green as he yells, "I am literally shouting to you from the other side of the street, Potter! How far more do you want me to '
"I don't visit Paris often, but when I do, I always come here. My first visit was with Ron and Hermione. It's one of my favourite places of the city." Harry smiles at the sight of a girl shouting and chasing after a dog off its leash. "I like the anonymity, the peace. It's quiet, but not secluded. I like to bring along my notes and iPod, park myself here for the afternoon and think of new recipes."
No. No, this doesn't make sense, this isn't logical, Potter has never backed down from a fight before.
I’ve tried my best to keep things as accurate as possible — smartphones weren’t common in 2002, and modern apps didn’t exist then (so Harry couldn’t have taken photos with his phone or used Whatsapp). However, the High Line was fully open only in 2014, but I couldn’t remove it as it was a crucial setting to the story, so I’m afraid I did take some artistic licence with this location.
“You like how I handle the meat?” Malfoy says with a smirk, lifting his eyes up to Harry, who blinks at the double entendre. Malfoy puts the fish away and washes his hands. “Perhaps you’ve got some meat that needs handling?”
Draco breaks into a run, returning the way he came from, dashing up the stairs leading to the Astronomy Tower. Relief overwhelms him when he sees Potter sitting on the stargazing steps, sandwiched between two telescopes. His shoulders are slumped and his head is in his hands, glasses tossed to the side, cutting a pitiful, dejected figure. When Draco approaches, he looks up, blinks, and then puts his glasses on.
Three days have passed, and Harry’s hope that Malfoy would open his door dwindles with each day. In fact, he’s so surprised when Malfoy’s door swings open that he simply stands there, his fist still in the air in mid-knock, wide eyes taking in Malfoy’s resigned expression and crossed arms. Grey eyes flicker to something behind Harry, as if he’s imagining something else, before settling on him.
And then he had stormed off, leaving a shell-shocked Harry in his wake. Eventually, Harry came to his senses and fled to Gryffindor Tower to wash his face, hoping that that would erase everything.
Harry nods and ducks his head shyly. Although he went to art school and has held two exhibitions, he still can’t shake off his self-consciousness when someone is looking at his work in front of him. He’s hardly as good as Dean, or his other classmates and mentors. Plus, he specialises in landscape paintings; his experience with portrait drawings extends only to a few modules in school.
Harry resists the urge to trace Draco's delicate features with a fingertip, wary about waking him. He looks wonderfully at ease and unguarded, every bit of anxiety and sadness swept away from his face. Harry takes in the inky blackness of his hair and eyebrows, counts the handful of faint freckles on the bridge of his nose, and admires the cupid's bow curve of his lush lips.
"No, I really gotta-" Harry's pushing away from the counter, the stool scraping against the floor. He stands, and he's not exactly sure why he's feeling faint; is it because he drank on a half-empty stomach, or is it because in less than four days, he's supposed to go up on
"Where were we?" Malfoy whispers, his voice low and seductive, but draws away when he sees Harry’s look of disbelief. When Malfoy speaks, his voice is flat and devoid of any trace of sexiness. "You're thinking now. Which means that you didn't think before you barged in here and mashed your lips onto mine. Which means that you regret what just happened."
Malfoy retrieves a jar of lube, and returns to Harry. Harry stares at the lube, and then at Malfoy, his heart pounding and his prick stiffening at the implication. “Go slow. It’s been some time,” Malfoy murmurs, his eyelashes fluttering when he presses the jar into Harry’s hands.
“Yeah. I'm so glad that today’s my last day in the office for a while,” Harry mutters and steps into the shower.
on Harry's prostate. He's only brushed it previously, not wanting to desensitise it too much, but this is the time to hammer it, fuck Harry's brains out and show him that no other man could ever give it to him as good as Draco can. This could be the last time he’ll have the chance to do this, and Draco is gonna make it as unforgettable as it can be for the both of them.
with Potter started, he's only ever thought of the other man in a sexual context, but could he dismiss this as a fuck-and-run? Draco's never really sat down and had a proper think about this. He imagines having dinner with Potter, Granger and Weasley. He can't — there's just something wrong with that picture, but if he wants to be a constant in Potter's life, that's something he'll have to deal with, isn't it, because the three of them practically came in a package deal.
Harry closes his eyes, yanks off his glasses and rubs the bridge of his nose. "We are not having this conversation in the middle of my office."
Draco wants nothing more than to lay down on the table and wait for his heartbeat to slow down, but he's got to take care of Harry. He hops down from the table and settles on Harry's lap. He bats away Harry's hand and takes over, his strokes firm and with the right amount of pressure he knows Harry likes.
He lets Potter kiss him roughly, all teeth and tongue. Draco lets him yank out the ends of his shirt and skim his palms on Draco's chest. He lets Potter leave love bites all over his neck and run his fingers through blond hair until Draco is sure his hair is as rumpled as Potter's. The kiss is all jagged breaths, small nips and wandering hands, and it’s all that Draco’s ever dreamt of.
It's not gonna last long for either of them; Draco's been hard since Potter's blowjob, and he knows how much Potter enjoyed their 69 on the kitchen island.
Draco tears his admiring gaze from Potter’s cock to look at his face. “Sorry,” he says, not sounding sorry at all. “Why would you be self-conscious about this?”
His friends shared a look, and Hermione replied him in the negative even though Ron's face scrunched up in that tell-tale manner, looking very much as if he wanted to tell Harry something.
"Bloody hell, Malfoy, what are you playing at? I wanna fuck, not bake a cake! I wanna have sex with you! Shag! Whatever the fuck you wanna call it! And I know you want me too, so get naked now, you stubborn arse-"
They lean back against the wall and sit in silence, the glittering moonlight highlighting their interlaced hands, and the sifting shadows of twilight cloaking the pain in their eyes.
, so good." It's Draco's turn to babble now, and he's certain he would be embarrassed at the sounds he’s making, but his world has narrowed down to sex with Potter: his low moans, the searing-hot sight of his cock fucking into him, the exquisite heat and pressure engulfing him. "Potter, oh fuck, Potter..."
“Did Snape really call Slughorn a walrus-shaped dunderhead?” he says, his shoulders shaking with laughter.
if Draco swans over to Sugarcoated with no reason whatsoever. He spies his bowl of golden syrup treacle, oh no, not just any store-bought treacle — this is Draco's own blend with a dash of rich chocolate added to it — catered specially to Harry's taste buds (Draco likes to call it Potter bait). He grabs it, empties the contents into a fancy royal green jar and loops a ribbon around it.
Draco hesitates for a second, and before he knows it, he's nodding. Once again, he cannot believe that this is happening. He hugs his gear to his chest and stares at the number
“Time for your dessert.” Draco leans in, capturing Potter’s lips in a brief, but scorching-hot and desperate kiss. He pulls away, satisfied at the frustration scrawled all over Potter’s features. “Think about this: treacle tart and clotted cream on your lips, and your come on mine.”
His world narrows to Potter's weaving and diving figure, glowing with the orange of the flames as he dodges another plume of fire. Draco scampers around the area, throwing up defence charms and fire-resisting shields around Potter and his snake. The heat and adrenaline surging through Draco makes him sweat as he keeps his eyes fixed on Potter's dance with the dragon. Potter now has the dragon's full attention, and it snarls, its jaws snapping as it spars with the pesky figure floating near her head, her large paws jabbing at Potter like how one would bat away a fly.
Time floats by in bouts of alternate fucking and kissing, and Draco had been sorely mistaken when he said that the sex on the table had been the best he'd ever had, because
The foggy muddle in Harry’s head about his upcoming exhibition clears, leaving behind a certainty about the centrepiece of his show so strong that he feels it in the marrow of his bones.
He grabs a bottle, his suspicion confirmed at the remains of the dark purple potion and the smell of lavender and valerian.
Potter puts on his clothes. "I have another one on my thigh. I don't mind showing it to you, but I… er… don’t want to strip in public." He eyes Draco up and mutters, "Wouldn't mind stripping for you in private though."
After a few more minutes of conversation, Draco calls for the bill (shooting the waitress a dark look after he caught her winking at Potter) and pays for dinner, waving away Potter's protests.
It’s rather strange how the fire in the sconces flare once, before dimming slightly, lending a soft, cosy atmosphere. The reflection of firelight dances on Potter’s glasses and earrings.
Draco strides towards them, tuning out the usual organised chaos of bustling Portkey Central and narrowly dodging a child chasing after a bouncing ball. He greets Pansy with a hug. According to her, after he got together with Harry, he's become more physically affectionate, a change that Harry found highly amusing.
"That was fantastic, you were fantastic," Harry mumbles. In response, Malfoy smiles up at him and twines their fingers together, fingertips stroking Harry's knuckles. They stay there, basking for a while.
Consumed with the need to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry tears a page from his sketchbook and begins to write a letter:
A nearby clang distracts Harry, and they both turn towards the kitchen, which is bustling with the lunch rush. The roaring stoves and the instructions hollered back-and-forth between the workers seem to have shaken Malfoy back into his senses.
If only Harry suggested 8 pm instead, if only Lucius Malfoy didn't have his heart attack back in Wiltshire in the early hours of this morning, if only the nurses didn't take one look at his Dark Mark and purposely schedule him for a later slot for his surgery, if only Draco's Portkey from London arrived earlier, if only he had run faster—
"Yes." Draco takes Harry's hand and kisses each knuckle. "When I saw you and the paintings, I knew I had to come back, no matter how long it would take."
He isn't sure how Potter would react, knowing that there're probably lots of people vying for his attention on his birthday. Even though Potter has visited France before, it was only for Quidditch matches, shuttling between the pitch, his hotel, meet-the-fans locations, and the odd club and party. A thought flits across Draco's mind — bringing Potter home to Pansy and Mother, but no, it's definitely too early for that.
Draco's love, however, is different. It's a little insecure, sometimes even shy and brittle around the edges. Yet it is a love of ever-lasting patience: a small smile and
"You've done a lot with the place," Malfoy remarks. "When I visited as a child, everything was so dark and dreary." Grey eyes scan the room, and Malfoy steps away from the sunlight streaming through the white curtains.
They snog and grope their way up to the teachers’ table, leaving a trail of discarded clothes behind them. Draco flashes a predatory grin when he roughly pushes Potter into Minerva’s chair. He climbs into Potter’s lap and straddles him, his hands holding the back of the chair and his hips making slow, rolling motions as he rubs their pricks together. Potter moans into Draco’s neck, his hands kneading Draco’s arse. They grind against each other, hot, hard and heavy, the slick slide of their bodies driving their lust to new heights.
"I was drunk! Don't you say weird shit when you're drunk too, Malfoy?" Potter throws his hands up in frustration. "I can't believe you've got it wrong all this time! I'm not chasing you for the sex. Yeah, sure, I wanna shag you, you're fit like hell, I'm not gonna deny that, but has it ever crossed your mind that I might want other things besides sex?"
Harry frowns, looking mulish. "I know. From here," he insists, pressing the heel of his palm on his chest.
“Hard, horny and desperate. Please suck me, please…” Harry begs. Unable to bear it any longer, he fists his prick, releasing a moan of satisfaction, which breaks off into a frustrated grunt when Malfoy bats his hand away.
Draco wraps his cloak tighter around his shoulders when a sudden wind gusts through the pitch. One of the first-years yelps when his broom lurches, and Potter quickly waves his wand in his direction to stabilise him.
Swearing under his breath, he pushes his book off his lap, and with wary eyes trained on Potter, who seems to be content simply sunbathing, he quickly packs his things. When Potter sits up, Draco scuttles behind the trunk, counts to five, and then slowly pokes his head out from the safety of the tree, peering.
She sniffles into the ends of the sleeves of her jumper at first, discreetly dashing away the tears from the corners of her eyes. When he reaches the chorus, she’s openly crying, her shoulders shaking, mascara running, heart-breaking sobs cupped in her palms. After the song, Draco quickly turns around to grab his glass of wine sitting on a tall stool behind him, but Harry catches him wiping his eyes too.
Harry scrambles up too, ignoring the twinge of pain when his potions tube dislodges from his skin. Shock sparks through his system, and his voice spirals upwards in panic. "I'm sure Draco and Hermione can keep a secret, we have to tell them we're not dead, they have to know—"
It takes a moment for Harry to respond. He can't believe that Malfoy is here, minutes before Xu Jian will ring him to provide details of the Portkey. "Shanghai. Two months."
"Fuck, Draco," Harry mutters, dropping his forehead into the crook between Malfoy's neck and shoulder. He picks up the pace again, stroking Malfoy's entrance. "Fuck," he says, with feeling. “Gonna be so tight for me.”
"I don't know what you've got against Ron, still. I thought you had worked it out," Harry mumbles. Bacon doesn't reply and only tugs the duvet even higher, and it's not long before Harry falls into a deep sleep, with Bacon coiled up by his side.
Malfoy rests his elbows on the banister, looking out at the city. Harry drinks in the sight of his side profile, eyes roaming from his jawline as sharp as his cutting remarks, the bare piercings on his earlobe, to the wayward lock of hair falling over his eye. Harry's fingers twitch, the desire to touch him overwhelming.
Malfoy pulls out at once and presses a necklace of kisses at the base of Harry's throat, although his finger continues to slide up and down his arse. Harry relaxes when Malfoy starts to kiss him again, and it's not as jarring when Malfoy pushes in this time.
Harry frowns when the other man's face barely flickers, although grey eyes tail Harry's every movement. Harry hooks his thumbs on the waistband of his thong, looks towards his left shoulder and rotates it, letting the left side of his shirt fall down to his elbow, exposing tan skin and muscular arms. Harry does the same on the other side, turns his wrists behind his back to break free of the shirt, twirls it hard over his head and...
"Is there a particular reason that the Draco doll is practically naked?" Draco asks, arching an eyebrow at the doll's tiny Gryffindor-red briefs — the only thing it's wearing.
He was twenty years old, hormonal and lust-filled. Seven years have passed, and he would like to think he's above that now.
The students shuffle out of the courtyard after thanking them, amidst excited chatters about the duel.
"Have you been listening? I've spent the past ten minutes telling you how we came this close to having a shouting match the first time we’d spoken in years."
"I shall see you this time next year, then," Draco says. This is their first meeting at Draco's office in Hogwarts, just before the start-of-term feast.
Harry provides the required details and explains this memory haltingly, his voice rusty and hoarse from disuse and his breath tasting like stale medicine. He looks at Ron, who nods and presses a hand on the bandage wound around his stomach.
“Can’t stop thinking about it,” Malfoy whispers, taking the lid and placing it on the nightstand. “Want you.”
Ron's gaze lingers on Harry's love bites. They fall silent, a long and loaded moment pulsing between them. Harry doesn't know what to say if Ron asks him about Malfoy. He's tired of forming excuses, of hiding his love bites and his feelings.
Malfoy pushes a chunk of banana around his plate, glances up at Harry before returning to his waffle. “My family had a small vault squirrelled away here, so I was able to eke out a living at the start. Any work that required Muggle identification was not possible. Things were... bad for a while. The only marketable skill I had was music. I was taught classical piano and singing since young, but I quickly learned that the guitar was a more practical option. With practise, busking, and my connections with musicians working in music shops, I taught myself the guitar. I got my first gig, and improved my stage presence and skills. I teach guitar too, at the same music shops. What I earn from gigs and teaching supports my day-to-day, and I’m lucky that most of the pubs I work at provides me with a free meal.” Something fierce and indomitable hardens his features. “It took me a long time to get back on my feet, but I did." He continues, softer this time. "And music helps me to…”
"I assume you have no need for clothes that don't belong to you," Draco says. At Potter's nod, Draco opens his briefcase and withdraws a few large bags — embellished with Draco’s initials — with extension charms stitched into them. He tosses said clothes into two bags, spells them closed and vanishes them.
"I'm sorry, I know I gotta foreplay more, but I can't wait, I can't..." Potter babbles and steadies Draco's left hip. He slowly slides a finger in him, all the way up to the knuckle.
"May I assume that you approve of the lodgings?" Draco bites out, irritated. He glares at the back of Potter's head.
"Wha-" Harry dropped the box and stared, stunned, at the item in his hand. It was medium-sized, running the length from Harry's wrist to elbow. It had Harry's jet-black hair, although it was much neater than the real Harry's usual riotous hair; it wasn't bespectacled, and the green of its wide eyes was a lighter shade than Harry's forest-green eyes. But there was one thing about the doll that was accurate — the lightning bolt-shaped scar on its forehead. It was rather ratty and old — small patches of cotton stuffing were leaking out from its seams and its red robes had faded to pink from sun exposure.
Draco beams with affection at the memory and returns his attention to the recorder. Harry is such a sappy git; no doubt it's filled with the sweet nothings he loves to say and Draco pretends to dislike. Still smiling, Draco dims the lights, fluffs up his pillows and tucks himself in bed, his chest against the sheets and left cheek pressed on his pillow. He presses the play button, rests the recorder on the pillow and closes his eyes.
Draco didn’t expect to feel so much when he glared at the photograph of Potter and Wood splashed in the gossip pages, complete with the headline screaming out at him —
," Potter begs. Draco lubes up — fuck, he's never been this hard for anyone before — and lines himself at his entrance, the head of his cock catching on Potter's slick rim.
Draco scowls and crosses his arms. “If he wants to be in the Lake so badly, I could always get Vince and Greg to chuck him in there tomorrow night.” Upon seeing the glare Potter sends his way, Draco unfolds his arms and raises his hands in surrender. “Alright, alright. I won’t ask them to do that.” He lowers his voice. “You should go back and talk to him.”
Harry casts his mind to Ron and Hermione. He's never really thought about it, but Ron always knows what to order for Hermione—regardless of her cravings and mood—if she's nipped off to the loo when the waiter arrives. Similarly, Hermione knows what to say to calm Ron down, and Ron knows what to buy for her at the florist, while Harry doesn't even know about Malfoy's favourite flower—
Draco tries another tactic when Potter refuses to budge. "Your old brooms would make some children very happy."
Draco carries the breakfast things to the sink. Sunshine streams through the windows, sparkling with hope and promise. Outside, puffball clouds scud their merry way across the cornflower blue sky. Draco flicks his wand to wash the dishes — here he is, washing plates in Potter's kitchen after he's cooked him breakfast and had amazing sex after they've been...
"I can't do this, Malfoy. I bloody can’t," Potter chokes out abruptly, slanting his body away from his mementoes. "How can I choose what to keep and throw, when everything is so precious? They left me behind, and I'll never hear their voice, see their smiles, feel their touch—"
“Yeah. Really,” he says, nodding seriously. He ought to know if there are precautions or things he shouldn’t do when chasing a fellow teacher.
Harry slicks every inch, letting his wrist go limp and lube drip off his fingertips onto his prick. He whispers Malfoy's name as he touches himself, his left hand grazing the underside of his cock. A trickle of lube drips from the tip of his cock down to the bed, and he catches it on his fingers, smoothing it along his shaft. He forms a circle with his right hand and slides his cock inside, pumping his hips back and forth as he fucks his fist.
Grey eyes flash in annoyance, that familiar undercurrent of heat and anger suddenly crackling into life between them. Malfoy's jaw hardens. He bites out through clenched teeth, "She understands me. She's good for me—"
Harry knows he's supposed to reply with some smart-arse comment, but Malfoy's arranged himself so artfully in his bed that Harry's brain has short-circuited somewhere along the way. Malfoy's lying on his side, left palm pressed against left temple, left elbow propping his upper body up and his right hand working its way down his black collared shirt, thumb popping buttons open along the way. Without breaking eye contact with Harry, Malfoy's fingers reach his jeans — jeans that make his legs look even longer and arse even higher — he slips open the button and pulls down the zipper, revealing a hint of black underwear.
He crosses the room towards his bag and gathers his scattered things, keeping his back turned to Harry.
The discomfort is more apparent now, stinging occasionally, but Draco can handle it. However, when Potter tattoos over the top of the skull, he winces in pain, squeezing an eye shut. This sensation reminds him of his Dark Mark ceremony.
"No, I’m waiting for the Ministry-sanctioned Portkey to be owled over, since the Portkey would send me directly to the sanctuary, and not to London, nor the wizarding Romania Ministry. Should take about another thirty minutes or so." Charlie puts down the letter and tightens his lips in worry, his normally cheerful blue eyes midnight with sadness.
He's in mid-conversation with Jerome Dupont, Head of Muggle Affairs in the French Ministry, when he spots Malfoy hovering a distance away behind Jerome. Malfoy skewers him with a gaze so intense that Harry breaks off in mid-sentence. Malfoy disappears into a balcony, and Harry hesitates.
Malfoy blinks rapidly. "You… you paint? As in, you're a real painter, with the..." He raises a hand, pretending to hold a brush and sketching patterns in the air. "With the brushes and canvas and all?"
"Get ready to move," the other man brusquely cuts Malfoy off in mid-sentence. "The minute we get news, we run. In the meantime, up security, sweep the other rooms and destroy whatever you can, especially whatever's in
"Don't look so bloody pleased with yourself!" Draco snapped and bounced the plushie off Harry's head again for good measure. "Yes, for some absurd reason I took a liking to it when it went on sale after your one-year-old defeat of Voldemort. Father hadn't been best pleased about that, but Mother got it for me in the end. According to Mother, I carried it everywhere when I was a child. When I got older, I had other things instead, such as books, but I've always... I..." He plopped down on the couch and twirled a finger around the plushie's small scarf.
He's just about finished with the chapter when the doorbell rings. He glances at the clock — it's eleven on a Monday night. It can't be Pansy, Blaise or someone close from work; they'd arrive by the Floo. It can’t be his parents either, because they'd write first before visiting, unless...
Harry steps off the tiny, winding staircase to the small viewing area after squeezing in the Santa Justa lift. He inhales the fresh air, invigorating after queueing for close to ninety minutes. He finds a quiet corner, away from the small knots of families, couples and tourists, ducking to avoid a selfie stick to his face.
Harry shrugs, stepping behind Malfoy and resting his hands on his hips. He presses forward, making his erection known. Malfoy arches his back, pushing his arse on Harry's prick. "You're more than enough," Harry murmurs, undoing Malfoy's belt buckle and slowly sliding it through his belt loops. "I don't need anything else, although I definitely wouldn't mind being… disciplined," he says, practically purring the last word.
"Draco. Tell me if you don't want me to go." Harry plucks the sponge from Draco's hands and throws it in the sink.
"In a messy mood today, aren't we?" Draco mutters, his breathing still uneven. He dislodges his hand from Harry's. Harry grunts in return, left palm pressed on the base of Draco's spine and right hand still on his cock, stroking it as he coaxes the last of his orgasm over Draco's skin.
"Er, I really didn’t wish for only one bed," Potter says rather weakly. His eyes dart towards Draco before returning to the bed.
His heart all the way down to his shoes, he whirls around and wrenches the door open, slamming it closed behind him, the sound ringing with a sad finality.
Although they dutifully shuffle back to their classrooms, Draco can still hear them whispering about the fight as Potter and him, with their heads bowed and shoulders slumped, trudge behind Minerva. The shame swirling in his belly magnifies at the thought of the entire school gossiping about this at lunch, and Draco glances at Potter. Potter is as dishevelled as him, hair sticking up at all ends, one arm of his glasses bent and his Quidditch leathers askew. There’s a bruise forming around his right eye. Draco’s jaw throbs with pain, his tongue feeling particularly heavy inside his mouth.
"Hey, the match ended later than expected; it’s almost six," Potter says, checking his watch. He looks at Draco, his lips curving up into an inviting smile. "I could do with an early dinner."
"You planned this," Harry said in disbelief and arousal, to which Draco nodded, promptly dropped his jeans and pants and draped himself over a park bench partly hidden behind the overarching branches of a large tree. Draco took as good as he gave; Harry had to cover Draco's mouth with a hand to muffle his cries of pleasure as he fucked him hard and fast.
Harry hears Malfoy's gasp, he must've realised how they look like — Malfoy's wearing nothing but a black thong, arse cheeks bared to the audience, Harry's on his knees in front of him, Malfoy's crotch at eye-level, and Malfoy's hips are suddenly thrusting up, his fingers buried in messy black hair, and it's so tempting for Harry to take off his thong too, to fit Malfoy completely and fully in his mouth, but not here-
Draco folds his arms and leans against the doorjamb of the kitchen in Grimmauld Place, drinking in the sight of Potter, his hair still damp from his shower. He’s hunched over the counter and scribbling on some parchment.
"I knew you returned for Granger's wedding last year," Malfoy says. "Pansy met you at the Leaky, and I knew you'd be there. I didn't go, couldn't go because if I looked at you, I'd throw away all of the photographs that Mother sent me. Photographs of prospective wives. Of…" He absently twists his family ring. "Of Astoria."
They’re now flying together shoulder-to-shoulder in a sky full of stars, and Draco feels more alive than he’s ever been. It’s completely different — flying alone versus flying with Potter — to feel Potter’s intense beam of focus on him and only on him, the way it has always been, the way it will always be, the way it
. Malfoy lets out another breathy gasp and bucks his hips up. He keeps his thighs clenched hard around Harry as, with his face upturned, he slowly curves his upper body down to the ground while his hands trail even further down Harry's chest. Meanwhile, the black mamba travels the length of Malfoy's torso again, pushing its own upper body high up in the air.
"Of course I am, silly goose," Harry says. He bends down to ruffle her hair affectionately. The nickname elicits a giggle from Marjorie, and she skips towards the door, dragging Harry behind her.
They walk in strained silence, and when they turn down another corridor, Harry recognises the furnishings of the area. He knows his way back, but he keeps quiet, wanting this private moment with Malfoy. The question, bubbling and simmering inside him for years, is poised at the tip of his tongue. He knows it's way too early for this landmine of a conversation, but he can't bear it anymore.
Potter continues, "After those two years, I returned to the magical world, but only to visit the Weasleys and friends, while I trained at Muggle tattoo places." He pulls a face. "Hated the media attention, but I made sure to do nothing remarkable." His smirk widens into a full-blown grin. "Nothing scandalous when I'm just buying milk at the shops or lazing about Grimmauld, especially when I didn’t meet everyone’s expectations by joining the Aurors. Think I’ve done enough fighting to last a lifetime."
He nabs a champagne from a passing waiter and downs it in one gulp, slamming the empty glass on a nearby table. He rubs his face with his hand and unbuttons the first two buttons of his uniform. Determined to put Malfoy out of his mind, yet unwilling to leave the ballroom, he circulates the room, striking up conversations with various people.
“I’ve been thinking about that too.” Potter shifts his chair forward and rests his elbows on the edge of Draco’s bed. “Just think, Malfoy. If you suddenly vanished from my life, wouldn’t I… miss you?” His face goes pink. “You were the first person of my age that I spoke to when I first entered the wizarding world. You were my first enemy. You fight me, annoy me, challenge me every day, and now, you’re my… er…” He makes a vague gesture between them.
"I didn't ask for all of that," Malfoy insists, his gaze lowering to Harry’s shoes and his voice becoming smaller. “I mean, sometimes I do think about using that on you, especially when you get bloody annoying, but…”
Draco bites back a growl of frustration. Fuck, they're so close to fulfilling his all-time favourite fantasy of sex in the Ministry canteen. "I want to shag here, tonight," he insists.
Potter hurries to his side at once, his jaw set in determination and his words steady and sure. "You've changed. When Pansy and I started working together, she told me things about you that I didn’t believe. Holding down a proper job, working your way up the paper's ranks, going Muggle." He gestures to Draco’s laptop. "The Draco Malfoy I knew was a snotty, spoilt bully that hated everything Muggle." Something softens in his eyes. "I read your articles, and when you returned to London months ago and I met you again, it was just…" He trails off and rubs the back of his neck. "You’re different now. Not completely different, but I really want to know you better." Potter shrugs and raises his arms, his palms facing Draco. "There’s lots of history to deal with, and it won't be easy, being apart, but I want to try," he says, hope gleaming in his wide eyes and a soft smile playing on his lips.
They'd lunged at each other, fists at the ready, arms flying and swear words snarled under their breaths. Harry got a split lip, while Malfoy got a punch to the gut, and that's when it happened — Malfoy stared at the blood seeping onto his lower lip...
Startled, Harry quickly turns away. He counts ten seconds before looking back, only to find Malfoy gone. The lights are still on, which means he’s still around. Besides, Malfoy usually leaves work around nine in the evening and always comes in at nine sharp in the morning.
The oven chimes, making the both of them jump. Malfoy pulls open the oven door, and Harry cranes his neck to sneak a peek, sniffing at the air.
"What the hell is your problem, Malfoy? I've done nothing to deserve this shit attitude from you." A familiar fiery gleam enters narrowed green eyes, and Draco's heartbeat ramps up.
In twenty minutes or so, Malfoy will sneak back into the dorms. He'll go to his own bed, which isn't right, because he should be in Harry's arms instead. Harry looks around him, at the portraits who are stirring awake because of his
"Let me get that," Jacob reaches over, wipes the mahogany counter down and grins at Harry. "Hey, you're new! What can I get for you tonight?"
"Absolutely not! You started it when you... forced your chocolate chip cookies into my establishment, and you didn't even thank me or tell me your thoughts about my chocolate! You've always been the one implying that I'm not good enough, never good enough for you!"
"Really? I don't think I’m wasting anything," Draco said, licking his lips when he broke the kiss. He picked up Potter's chocolate-smeared fingers, and when he began to suck, Blaise fled.
"Sorry. It's a Decoy Detonator that isn't working right. One of Fred's." Potter picks it up, training an unfocused gaze on it. "One of the things that reminds me of him." He looks up at Draco, the terse set of his lips broken with a quick smile that doesn't meet his eyes. He returns it to the box and fusses about in the box even though there's no need for that. "I went to his grave last week with George,” he remarks casually.
His nostrils flaring and his eyebrows knitted in annoyance, he strode over to Harry, yanked the doll out of his hands and promptly whacked him over the head with the Harry plushie.
As the sound of a guitar comes through the wall of his flat in Muggle New York City, Harry looks up from the photographs spread out on his coffee table. Smiling, he returns to his photos of the city, although his attention is already drifting away to the faint music coming from next door. As usual, his neighbour is kicking things off with warm-ups, comprising of repetitive scales and chords.
“Not half, not two-thirds. Every single inch of that big, hard, thick cock all in me, yes?” Draco says, punctuating each word with a sharp roll of his hips, rubbing said cock along his cleft.
With a flare of hope blooming in his chest, Harry advances forward, his arms rising, but stalls when Draco retreats. Harry’s smile fades and he shuffles back when Draco shakes his head and mumbles something to himself.
Harry chuckles and reaches under the covers to pat Draco's soft cock. "Yeah, I know what you mean. It's three-thirty in the morning, we've been going at it for like what, four hours? You're not only hung like a Hippogriff, you've got the stamina of one, too."
or anything like that. I just... I just want a neat house," he says rather hopelessly. "That's honestly all that I want."
He might have noticed the hush of the crowd, and the clearing of a throat, magnified by the microphone.
"I navigate by sight and scent. Each part of the castle smells different." She fixes Harry with a beady look. "So what are you going to do about your biped?"
And then he's transported to the Malfoy family crypt, alone and curled up in a corner of the dusty and musty room, sobbing after burying his parents. He’ll never forget the horrible abandonment, his hands covering his face as he weeps, slow pressing despair surrounding him like a storm.
He perches on a rickety chair at Potter's kitchen counter, nursing a cup of chamomile tea. Grey eyes track Potter as he finishes up the kitchen by checking expiry dates.
He stares, his eyes turning blank, a slow and pressing despair swamping his mind as he’s sucked into that hateful vortex of memories during his worst year at Hogwarts. There is a reason why he has avoided this place. This is the vilest ghost he has yet to exorcise upon his return as a teacher, the events of this very night influencing his decision to teach Defence. Right there on the floorboards was where he raised his wand to Dumbledore and showed him his Dark Mark, where he confessed his wrongdoings, his murderous plot, inadvertently hurting others, including Potter’s best friend—
Harry inwardly flinches, the sting of rejection and rain-drenched skin from two days ago still fresh in his mind. With leftover hurt and disappointment piercing through him, he nods at Malfoy harshly. “Yeah?”
It's almost midnight in London on a Friday night, and Potter could be home, or out with his friends, or maybe even with another bloke—
For some reason, the other teachers seem rather keen on helping Harry — they told him about Malfoy’s favourite things and secretly changed the roster for Hogsmeade chaperoning, night patrols and detention duties to create more chances for them to spend time alone. Once, Filius said he was down with a “rather vicious strain of the flu, sorry about that”, so he requested Harry to take his place, pairing him with Malfoy during patrol. However, Harry saw Filius laughing at Horace’s jokes in the staffroom afterwards, flu-free. When he saw Harry staring at his speedy recovery, Filius simply squeaked out a coughing fit into his handkerchief.
"Need me to look over your Potions essay again? Honestly, Potter, you've got to start listening during Slughorn's classes. I hardly think I'll be able to sit beside you for N.E.W.Ts to guide you every step of the way," Draco says, tossing everything back into the kit.
"Really? That's brilliant!" Harry exclaims in delight. Last year, he'd managed to rope Oliver in to coach the older kids in between seasons of professional coaching with Puddlemere United, with Harry taking back the reins when Oliver returned to Puddlemere.
"You were saying something about food earlier?" Harry asks, stowing his wand away. "We could go to a bistro or pop into a supermarket and get something to go. The view along the River Seine is brilliant."
“From my training with the Magpies. A few of us wanted to do something different, so we went to Seamus and Dean’s Muggle sports complex — I don’t know if you’ve been there before — and tried out loads of things. I’m not an expert on everything, of course.”
"I mean, if you'd like somewhere quiet. It's rather late, and I don't know many places that're open now. If you're not keen on that, we could go to a... park, or something."
Draco licks his lips in anticipation. Oh, Potter's going to come so hard at this. Draco whispers, "Imagine how good it'll feel when you fuck my arse like this, how good it'll feel when you
the snake, and that's exactly what we're looking for." Matt glances briefly at Harry's body. "That's some pretty decent dancing for your first try, but you'll need to be better. That won't be a problem, we'll sort you out. Right, follow me, and we're going to settle the paperwork — non-disclosure things, payment and the such."
