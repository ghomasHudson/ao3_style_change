Harry grumbled but got up to be met with a cup of tea from Ron with a smile. "Thanks," He mumbled out with a sip.
Harry turned his attention back to Malfoy whose face had relaxed now, his eyes batting around the disheveled room they were about to spend the next few hours in. The blonde ran his fingers through his hair now catching Harry staring at him for more than a second. Harry half expected Malfoy to spit something else out to get onto his nerves, but nothing ever left the blonde's lips.
"Hello," The stranger mumbled from the mounds of cloth almost covering their face.
"Listen Harry, I knew you were obsessed with Malfoy but I didn't think you could actually stand to sleep in the same room as him, you're insane." He wiped the tears from his eyes.
Harry didn't mind who'd he have to sleep with. McGonagall mentioned something about the smaller rooms that would have to be shared duoly since they were adults now who needed
"Something is on your mind?" Draco looked up to meet Harry's worn eyes.
Potter! Stop entering the room like a beast," Draco jumped in his seat.
Malfoy hadn't changed much since Harry had seen him, same platinum blonde hair, same cold eyes, rough cheekbones. His whole face looked like it could cut you, but there was a subtle softness to it all.
"Nevermind -- thought I heard something," Malfoy mumbled to his friends who paid no attention to his pause.
"Of course I do Potter," He frowned at the obnoxious question and let his eyes wander back onto the page, "Of course I don't suppose you would feel the same about your parents-"
Harry hummed happily while letting his fingers stroke up and down the small of Draco's back, slipping under his sweater to feel his hot pulsing skin. The blonde purred into Harry's ear seductively at the touch.
Harry let out a long breath and fit himself in the only spot he couldn't be found.
Harry got up as well, neither Ron or Pansy questioned it, too deep into their conversation.
A while later, Harry had returned finding that Draco was asleep again.
"I think shes a Constance, Mum always said if she had another daughter that's what she'd name it." He let his fingers past the cage holes to stroke the gentle owl.
Harry subconsciously searched for Malfoy who he'd finally spot sitting beside Pansy and her friends. Draco was slouching over the table and looked awfully tired, with dark circles around his eyes.
Harry seemed proud of how he could get Draco to make these faces for him.
He hadn't even brought his own books Harry realized after it was too late.
Harry thought Draco had ignored his statement when he had only continued to flick his quill around on his desk.
Curiosity got the best of Harry as he quickly took it, shoving it in the pockets of his robes, reminding himself to take it out later.
if he and Draco wanted to further continue things like such.
Harry revealed the bouquet of roses in front of him, closing his eyes tight he cleared his throat before speaking.
"Bloody hell Harry I've been looking for you, Pansy won't leave me alone and Hermoine has been sick to her stomach, sent her down to the hospital wing." He sighed.
Harry fumbled with his glasses and rolled his shoulders back to relax.
Ron huffed, "Why has Draco been acting so...odd..." He thought aloud. Harry thought to himself possible reasons, surely it had to have been partly because he'd basically lost his father figure, his family's manor, and how traumatic becoming a death eater had been. Harry had almost missed Draco's name-calling and their occasional duels now, but he also enjoyed being able to breathe in the same air as Draco without any problems.
"Its fine Potter," he sighed, "My mother has been ill, I send her what little money I have left but I can't bear to face her."
"Come on, up we go," Harry hoisted the blonde up, arm still draped over Harry to lean most of his heavy feeling body onto the other.
Ron was peacefully knocked out, shades closed to avoid the sun from waking him up.
"More more more more mo-re ah-haah, Harry-" He dug his nails into Harry's shoulders as the pleasure flooded his insides, building up a pool in his stomach.
He shouldn't be nervous, he was the guest after all... Maybe Malfoy was just as nervous as he was.
"I know Potter, I'm messing with you," He huffed and stretched his body out.
The room still dark, he could hear muffled cries much like the ones in his dream, he got up carefully. He approached Draco's bed and pulled back a curtain to reveal a balled-up, sleeping Draco.
"No, I remembered," He coughed, pulling out his own book with no bookmark in it, thinking that he would have been better off leaving his book at home purposely so he could use one of Malfoy's again.
She grinned softly at the two, "Well thank you, I've been doing much better in case if you're wondering Draco, I didn't mean to leave your letters hanging," She admitted, "I read them every day and every day I feel better, only I kept hoping you'd come to see me." Draco's face fell with shame.
Luckily Luna had gotten Harry an owl as birthday present despite his protests. The owl she had gotten him wasn't at all like Hedwig but a male, mottled gray-brown with a reddish-brown face. It's big orange jeweled eyes always had Harry admiring then from his desk but he didn't try to have any sort of connection to him.
but they both knew
Now with the room more lit up than before, Harry could see what Hermoine had described.
They had taken a break after finishing the 3rd chapter and used it to talk about their lives after the war and why Santiago was the favorite of literally anyone who read Coeurs Dansent for every reason possible.
"That's quite strange," The trio had turned towards the delicate voice behind them.
"H-harry.." He muttered out again, his breath increasing as he stroked faster.
By the time the train had reached its destination, Malfoy had returned, carefully grabbing his luggage and trailing behind his friends while Harry followed behind slowly.
"They think it's so funny don't they..." Ron mumbled under his breath.
Harry nodded and scanned over the first paragraph, "She hadn't but one lace left in her dress, a disheveled mess she was — Where was her boy? 'Santiago?' She called out under a whisper." Harry paused to sip his tea. Reading Malfoys writing in front of him made him a little shy.
"Gives them no right to do this to you," He peered over Draco's shoulder.
Harry, you look a mess," Hermione scoffed playfully.
As he approached the end of the train's hall he spotted a few Slytherins sitting together. "Malfoy..." Harry whispered to himself again, now habit. As if the blonde could hear him, he turned towards Harry. Harry wasn't even sure if he had put his cloak on until Malfoy turned back to Blaise to resume the conversation.
He got up and quickly closed the shades to relieve Draco of any future headache and further groaning.
Malfoy's free hand traveled up his shirt and gripped onto a sensitive bud to twist and pull on, only wishing it was Harry's hot mouth suckling on it.
Harry thanked her and she soon left, Harry forgetting to ask why she had even stopped by besides letting him know she'd seen his owl fly out as normal.
Harry turned to find his usual seat, a quiet place in the corner of the building with a large window to look out into the busy street with.
Malfoy quickly returned with a tray of two cups of tea, the smell of cinnamon makes Harry's nose tickle but he gladly accepted the tea and sipped at it.
Draco opened his mouth as if to say something but retraced his thought and left the air dry of conversation.
A rush of excitement tickled his nerves as he realized what he'd done. He was definitely going to get a fussy Ron for the next week from this.
He could almost feel Harry push through his guts and push into his stomach with how large and full he was.
The stranger held a freshly poured cup of tea up to Harry, Harry unable to get a clear look at his face, he accepted the cup and took a quick sip.
The footsteps stopped and swiftly before Malfoy's eyes, a grinning Golden Boy removed his cloak in a swift motion to reveal himself.
It didn't help him, his friends, and Draco would all be together in the pub. Probably be filling the air with some sort of awkward tension.
He watched closely as Draco's slender fingers pressed firmly against his quill, writing a lot more fast-paced than he usually did. He seemed stressed and tense, possibly from Harry's dumb comment.
Harry slapped his hand away.
Harry was deathly afraid to say anything more and only looked down at the floor between them, Draco's movements froze and he felt a cold sweat cover him.
"I suppose we should go back to finish the room of requirement, Pansy will be an arse about it later if we don't by the time she's back," Harry agreed, making sure to dump off his tea on the way back to the castle.
The room of requirement had spent them the entire day to clean up, plus they'd have to come back tomorrow to get the door and the magic in it replaced for it to actually be able to function correctly.
Harry grinned slightly, "Nothing weird has happened yet, but I'll let you know if something does."
"I don't mind at all," He glanced at her outfit which was always a work of art, very odd but very pleasant choice in fashion. Reminded him of Malfoy and his choice in clothing.
"What's so funny? I didn't see you getting down to help me," Ron glared.
Draco's soft whine followed from the loss of touch but Harry cautiously positioned himself at Draco's entrance, shooting Draco a concerned look.
He looked up, layed back on his bed, he realized he'd woken up.
They had settled that tomorrow they would take off to visit the Malfoy Manor and possibly stay the week there if his mother would allow it. Merlin knows Draco's father would be having a meltdown if he'd knew Harry Potter would be staying at
Harry was startled. At first, he thought about remaining hidden and making Malfoy think to himself that Harry was in fact not still with him, alone, on the train.
"Malfoy.." Harry muttered subconsciously. Malfoy had dragged his fingertips over the cabinet like it was his lover, it mesmerized Harry, to say the least. Gentle but so intrigued by the object he seemed so very interested in. No way was he just window shopping, Malfoy was being obviously odd. Something his friends, however, did not see.
Harry felt relieved and cast his own cleaning spell before covering himself again and feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over him.
Everything from last night had come back to Harry in an instant and he instinctively looked over towards Malfoy's bed, he wasn't there.
Harry nodded, unapologetically staring down Malfoy's adorable vulnerable state. Harry lightly wondered if he had always had a sort of attraction to the Slytherin but pushed the thought down when he returned to the drawing-room to floo back home.
Harry was losing his mind.
Harry let out a snort.
His feathered kisses had trailed up from Draco's wrist to his dark mark, which Draco had instinctively pulled away from. "Sorry," He mumbled. He left lingering kisses all around and eventually on top of the mark. So many beautiful places on Draco that he had yet to really explore.
Harry awoke to a rather warm feeling stirring in his stomach. Almost as if it was burning him he cocked his eyes open to see only darkness.
While it wasn't anywhere near the Great Hall he'd seen it as the only thing left on a checklist someone made of rooms in need of restoration.
The bright and warming sun had shone through the window to rest on Draco, awakening him before Harry. He got up quickly and covered himself with the clothes he could find; attempting to clean up the wine mess at that, he heard Harry groan and toss himself over to blink his eyes open.
He thought, throwing the paper to the floor in an instant.
She flinched but turned towards the two, a grin emerging on her lips.
He leaned back into the great sofa which had almost eaten him up, letting him sink deep into its cushions. His back felt relieved of all tension and he let out a soft laugh.
is what," Pansy tucked her lips in as if to think on that.
Surely he didn't
"Maybe they're off helping with other things, we should go look after I change," Harry suggested and walked into his own room.
Harry had begun to feel sick at the many thoughts but everything had begun to make too much sense if his theory was correct. Should he confront Draco later at the pub? Or perhaps when they're alone?
Draco shook his head with a sulkened expression, "I don't really have anyone that would want to even come over."
Draco widened the door with a sigh and let Harry in.
It couldn't be possible though . . . Harry had always thought La Gaudière was a female from how feminine everything she — he wrote, portrayed, and presented to Harry and his audience.
Harry looked over to Snape who seemed to be eyeing him sickly.
smut chapter, for not posting yesterday I made it longer :)
"Malfoy, you know that's not how I felt," Harry carefully made his way over to the sink.
"How come you can call me Potter and I have to call you Draco now? Doesn't seem very fair," Harry hadn't even noticed that Draco had moved closer to him as they walked.
"I've already finished it," Luna said thoughtfully, stuffing loose quills into a pouch.
"Well, the room is in here, please watch your head," The blonde pulled out a book from a shelf and suddenly the whole room had flipped open to reveal a dark hallway.
Harry was unsure if Drack was on good terms with what was left of his family. Curious, Harry would ask him about it when he got to his room.
"You don't have to — it is fine, my mistake after all," The stranger shook his head.
"A letter from Hogwarts? Isn't it too early.." Ron wondered with food in his mouth before ripping it open.
Ron quickly left with his stuff and owl in hand to really get a good look at her.
The morning came quicker than Harry had wanted it to, even with how nervously excited he was.
"Ah did she? I suppose maybe later then," Hagrid shut the door on the three, all just as confused as the other.
"I wouldn't see why not," He wondered if only a certain portion of students had been selected for their house or year. That could explain why Ginny didn't get a letter.
He hadn't even asked Malfoy if it was alright to come over so early after work but was met with an answer.
"With that being said, starting tomorrow, each house of students will go out to Diagon Alley to assemble their school supplies." Parts of the room let out a soft applause and shortly were released for the night.
Draco had slid it right out of the cover to place atop of the inside squared box and pressed a needle thing down.
Last thing he remembers, was feeling Draco run his slender and soft fingers through his messed hair before drifting to a comfortable sleep.
"Muggle technology, brilliant isn't it?" Draco offered a hand towards Harry to get up into the open space with him.
Stirring in his sleep Malfoy kept quiet as much as he could.
The expressions Draco gave reminded him of the ones he gave Harry in his dreams, beautiful and broken. Saliva had still glossed over Draco's swollen and red mouth, the sight made Harry release a low groan and motivated him to thrust harder and faster.
Harry had finished scribbling down the large list of questions when he had finally shut off his light, forcing himself to get some rest.
"Oh~ Draco~! Draco!" He imitated poorly.
Draco looks amazing.
Harry's first reaction was confusion but he proceeded to reread it over and over and over to fully understand what it was.
"A-ah," Draco cried out, fists clenched harder into Harry's flesh as he continued to push in until he felt his balls rest at Draco's swollen entrance.
"Yes!" He blurted out a little too loud.
He shuffled back over to Potter who gave Narcissa a gentle wave.
"Harry please, please.. I need you inside me.." He flushed at his own words and how disgusting he was to be begging for Harry to make love with him.
"You love me Malfoy," Harry leaned down, breath hovering over the body of Draco's that was soon stripped open like a book. He looked a beautiful mess, exchanging hot and heavy breaths, Harry had undone his buckle to reveal a perky bulge, restrained under clothing.
"Bloody floor still looks like it's covered in urine," Ron huffed as he continued to scrub the same spot over and over with both a sponge and whatever cleaning spell he could test on it.
"Hey, it's alright," The stranger rested a hand on Harry's knee, "If it bothers you so much you could take my copy, clean as a newborn's arse it is." Harry paused his movement and looked up.
"I just want to really appreciate what I'm looking at," Harry kissed down on the sensitive skin now exposed from the briefs. He'd feel Draco's tighs up and down, soft as he'd imagine them to be, but they shook with every gentle touch.
"Pleasure doin' business with you," The man dragged the cage over to hand to Harry who thanked him, eager to rush back to his friends.
"Sod off Potter," Malfoy tucked the books deeper in the pit of his arm when suddenly Harry snatched something from his hand.
The footsteps crossed the common room, with a paling face Draco cleared his throat.
"Of course not but yes--I need to go you know otherwise I'll-"
"Potter, I must tell you that when anyone but the author reads from here..." He muttered, "The things written in here can bend into reality, please be careful." He handed the book back over to Harry who almost felt unsure if he should even read it at all thinking back to when he got the bite.
"No no no no, Harry.." He looked up to meet Draco's squinted ones, "I want to feel you inside me." He breathed out nervously. This had felt familiar as if they'd actually fucked for ages before this. He obeyed Draco and got up to stroke his own hardened cock while leaning over Draco.
"I saw Albus fly out and gave him a treat if you don't mind," She examined Harry's room and then his unkempt desk and smiled.
"You'd be surprised," Harry rolled his eyes over at Ron.
Closing the curtains on his large bed he kept a slit open so he could watch Draco peacefully fall asleep over a book.
Ron caught his eye and smirked, "Remember, your little boyfriend went to Diagon Alley for the day?" Ron teased sitting down at Harry's unused desk. He hadn't needed to really use it anyway since school hadn't started yet, but he did keep his quills and a few favorite books stashed away inside.
"No Malfo—"
"Back already Potter? My my, let me help you with those," Draco was quick to welcome Harry back and grab onto the books Harry struggled to caress in his arms.
Why had Malfoy even invited Harry to his Manor anyways? How could he even trust Harry with his identity? Questions continued to flood his mind as he quickly grabbed a sheet of parchment to scribble down on.
Hermione sighed, "Perhaps we should report this to Dumbledore, I've never seen anything like this."
"What are you doing here in the middle of the night of all times Potter?"
He paused to set the tea away, realizing he had spilled some of the tea onto his book.
"Hermoine, how are you feeling?" He smiled while taking a seat beside her bed.
It had to have been the most pleasure he'd ever felt, or so he thought for now.
Harry wasn't sure if anyone here would be able to lift them up and out but figured he'd deal with it later.
"Don't touch things that aren't yours, Potter! Give it back you git," Harry had thought for a moment at the almost reverse in roles before flipping through the first few pages of the mysterious book.
Harry hummed, "Alright I'll get changed and meet you out in the common room," Ron nodded and left swiftly.
Harry had an idea.
“It seems as though the Gryffindor common room has disappeared,” Harry interrupted, quick to make the conversation haste.
"Malfoy-"
"Hhh..." Harry perked up at the scene layed out before him.
"Violet is a lot like your parents," Harry noted aloud.
Harry got up from his bed and stalked his way over to Malfoy, bending down over Malfoy's shoulder, his breath was hot and sent a shiver down the blonde's spine.
"I'm starting to think you're not actually that bad Weasley," She looked back at Harry realizing he felt out of place.
Their erections pressed firmly together, only separated by their clothing, their bodies begged to feel skin on skin.
"Sounds very Malfoyish if you ask me," He paused to consider his choice in words, "It's actually my favorite but I'm starting to really like this one," He pointed to the cover of the book they were reading.
The steps up to Dumbledore’s office were rather large and waxed, the air between the friends was tainted with a thick shared silence. The sounds of their shoes clamping against the waxed steps echoed through the walk-up.
Draco's brow fell and he brushed off Harry's question with a change of topic.
Even at the trials when Harry had spoken for Draco, he'd been too afraid to even look at him for the whole of it.
Malfoy surprisingly was there at his desk, writing away again as he had been.
"Ooh, he retaliates," Pansy chuckled and bent down to where Ron had been scrubbing and with a wave of her wand, the floor was cleaned in an instant.
Thankfully it didn't take Draco long to reach his climax after Harry did and spilled into Harry's warm hand, going limp as well under Harry.
After it had been getting late, McGonagall had gathered everyone to the Great Hall for a celebration dinner.
Lazily lit candles were sprinkled across the room, creating a dewy mood.
"Just a certain someone I was in a duel with, things got quite messy," He kicked softly at Draco's foot under the table which made him jump.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco huffed out, a wariness to his tone set the mood, "' Mother I am here, do you not see me?' His mother shook her head as she clawed at her eyebags. Her vision had completely vanished by now." He hummed happily. They took turns reading one paragraph after another. Sometimes Harry would get too into it and forget to let Malfoy have a turn at it.
"Have fun with Malfoy last night?" Seamus piped in.
Harry's hot and wet tongue hadn't hesitated and licked around the tip of the blonde's sensitive cock, catching Draco off-guard as he sucked in a quick breath. Draco had continued to mumble out curse words towards Harry while grabbing and gripping at his hair, eager to plunge him down and face fuck him balls deep already.
"It's so nice to see you young boy, waiting for your book?" He pulled the book out from under the counter to Harry's relief.
Pulling his watch out he almost choked realizing it was ten till 7.
He held two fingers up to Draco's mouth, seeing as they hadn't any lube around and he would definitely have to look into lubing charms later.
Harry had even gone as far as to twirl Malfoy around after the blonde had shown him how to. He softly let himself dip Malfoy in and out, every so often until he let Draco sit, half dipped, in his arms.
"He wouldn't do that for me, he'd probably be embarrassed to be seen aiding me," Draco wished this conversation to be over with, any talk about Harry Potter or the Death Eaters made him feel simply ill.
Harry thought about waiting to see if Malfoy would reveal it for him later.
"Tonight for me?" Harry held a hand upon Draco's shoulder. Harry's patience was running out and he was too curious as to how Draco even obtained such a book.
"It's a long story, I don't know any covering spells and the only person I know who does is ignoring me," He admitted. It was nice out actually, even with it being how late it was. Hermoine had let them know she was running late and would later join them.
"Anyways, I gave him a look up and down and he seemed almost sickly... His hair was in a mess and he had a swollen eye,"
Harry's whole body was on top of Malfoy, pinning him down, his face was red with what Malfoy couldn't tell was anger or breathing problems.
He'd throat down Draco's cock suddenly, pulling back with a pop sound that had Draco's body shudder against him.
"You're saying it like you've got food in your mouth Draco," a mumbled conversation startled Ron and Harry when they stepped into the room of requirement with two extra unexpected guests.
"Your eyes are pretty Potter," He lulled while rummaging through a box on a shelf.
Harry examined it closer up, it had been left several pages into the book so he assumed it was charmed to remain hidden.
His room was a mess Harry had never expected from such a properly dressed prat, nonetheless, Harry carefully carried Malfoy over to his bed and layed him down to sink into his covers.
"Finally, you both took forever," A familiar voice made Ron and Harry turn to be met with a dramatic Hermoine.
"What do you want Draco?" He hummed sweetly.
Draco laughed and moved on to read the paragraph they had left off on.
"Potter..." Harry looked at him alarmed he'd woken up.
"Hold on you're going to make a mess if you drag it off," Harry offered his assistance while Draco struggled to hold the large piece of wood on his own.
Even the media had thought La Gaudière to be a girl. Harry laughed lightly to himself now remembering how La Gaudière had told him he wanted his identity to remain a secret.
"You're not selfish, I may not completely understand your reasoning but you're concerned for your mother which is what a good son does," he laid a hand over Draco's, "What if you went to go see her now with someone? Would that make you feel better?"
"Ron is so fussy," Draco admitted while stuffing a sandwich he'd gotten with Harry into his mouth.
After trailing his eyes over Malfoy's sleeping figure he looked over to his desk. A large book was left open which seemed to be blank.
"Oh look at the time! Well, you all better be off for now, I've got some things I need to do," The trio frowned while being led out the door.
"Draco," he reminded him.
The two had passed out on the sofa, the wine had been spilled and they were both still half-naked with their clothes thrown across the floor.
Draco pulled away, alarming Harry for a moment. "I need my wine," Draco mumbled to himself while pulling out a large unopened bottle of wine from the cabinet; he poured the liquid into a fancy glass he had used yesterday and swung back over to Harry.
"Draco," Harry paused, "I want to explore that with you." Harry realized how bold he was being but this is what he wanted. He wouldn't have thought he could get this far just a few months ago and was grateful for every moment they shared together.
Harry might've stayed there next to him for hours, or maybe just minutes. But he felt a sense of comfort between them there and watched in awe as Draco slept calmly after that.
Malfoy got up, breaking the long stare-down and laughed lightly to himself.
Draco grinned softly, "What are you doing up? What time is it?" He slurred out, fumbling for his pocket watch.
The rocking of their hips together was sending Harry over edge but he didn't want to let go yet.
"I didn't intend for it to end like this," He let go of Potter to get up and over to the sink, letting the water fill the cup in his hands so he could wash his face off.
"I've been needing me a new pet," Ron said softly in remembrance to his Scabbers. Even if Scabbers wasn't exactly the pet of his dreams, at least Ron could move on.
Handing it swiftly over to Harry he got up with his book and waved off.
"You're so pretty like this," Harry mumbled, swiftly unbuttoning Draco's top before tossing it to the side.
Upon entering the Three Broomsticks, Harry's eyes had spotted Draco's blonde hair in an instant, giving him a long stare to let the other know he wasn't going to play nice tonight.
"Thank you," He mumbled out before releasing his grip from Potter.
Ron grinned as he gave Hermoine a long hug and a peck on the lips before Hermoine turned to greet Harry with a friendly hug.
Harry longed to be the one Draco would lean into and shook that thought from his head when Ron tapped his arm for his attention.
, don't ignore me," Draco spat at him with a quick glance. Harry turned away, afraid of letting Draco know he'd gotten into his bloody bin and uncovered what felt like a shared dirty secret between them.
"You love Toucher Le Ciel, don't you? It seems very Potterish after all I suppose. . ."
He frantically searched around but Malfoy must have left the Great Hall altogether.
Slowly, however, Harry uncovered and wrapped the cloak up in his hand. His cheeks flushed with the embarrassment of being caught by Malfoy of all people. Harry thought about starting a fight with Malfoy, telling him about what he had seen earlier and what he suspected of the potential death eater.
"You're disgustingly lazy with your words, please elaborate," Harry smirked into another quick kiss.
With access to the new house room, everyone stepped inside anxiously. It was very bare but layed out very differently than any other house common room Harry had ever seen.
"Bloody hell Harry- Can't you let a man get his beauty sleep..?" Ron Mumbled before reaching for his covers.
Harry continued to aggressively slam into his prostate and hungrily captured Draco's wet, soft lips into a deep kiss. The warm hums and tears from Malfoy dripped onto Harry lovingly.
Hermoine petted his arm with a thoughtful grin.
"Harry," Hermoine held out her arms for an embrace.
"What's that supposed to mean Malfoy?"
"I haven't spoken to my mother since the trials."
, he told himself sternly. He needed to actually be working and wait just another 10 minutes before he could have his free-time.
"So beautiful underneath me like this, you're gorgeous Draco," He repeated praises to Draco which made the smaller's face heat up and turn red. He tried to hide the side of his face in the pillow under him but Harry only continued to embarrass the blonde.
Draco assumed this was because he'd been saved by Potter from being sent to Azkaban but didn't really know for sure.
Harry couldn't wait till he returned to the Malfoy Manor later, all morning till afternoon he counted down the hours to minutes, to seconds.
Like an excited dog, Harry seated himself on Draco's bed and waited for Draco to bring the book over.
"Alright Potter if you came to ask if someone has moved their stuff into here, no one has wanted to room with me-"
"Merlin Malfoy, your eye-" He instinctively moved closer to get a better look at it.
Harry shrugged, he hadn't really thought if she had.
Draco whined out as Harry trailed his kisses up to the base of Draco's hardened cock. Running his tongue up and down the shaft, he dipped into the slit when he felt Draco lightly buck up. He didn't know how experienced Draco really was and wasn't sure if the dreams had really counted.
"Shit — what time is it?" He heard Harry mumble to himself while checking his watch. Harry sighed in relief when he realized it was too early to be attending to his Auror duties just yet.
Harry could see Draco's soul, deep in his eyes, luna had once told him that the eyes show the strength of someone's soul. He'd definitely tried to read people's eyes before but Malfoy's were really something. One eye screamed hurt, confused, and emotional. The other was a mask much like the one he showed as a kid, rude, blunt and self-centered.
"Your mother wants you to get up, food is ready anyways,"
He paused to think about it, "I should mention that Malfoy has been acting odd," Harry mentioned while watching his two friends ahead of them bicker over something pointless.
Hot breaths exchanged as Draco had a moment to process what he'd seen covering Harry's neck.
"Thank you.." Harry mumbled out still thinking of how to approach Dravo without setting him off.
Sitting back up, he looked at Harry with a thought, "You can take your shoes off too, get comfortable," He got up towards a nearby sink and ran his hands under the water for a moment.
"Damned
Draco was so tight, even with the bit of lube he'd use to prep him, he squeezed tightly around Harry's shaft.
"Harry your desk is a mess again," She began to pick up papers off his desk and collect them into piles for Harry to put away.
Harry shrugged and sat down beside Neville who seemed to be studying his wand as if he'd never seen it before. Harry would have to remember later to cast a
Malfoy whispered menacingly into Harry's ear, his hot breath tickling Harry's hair, sending a shiver down his ribs and into the pit of his stomach.
“Cast the bonding spell, the spell I cast when I cursed the lake.” Harry thought about the ball of fire he had been pulled into.
He stood in the silence waiting. The tear tracks from his eyes were tingling slightly and that was all Draco could feel of his body. Everything else was numb. A pointless body in a pointless house.
Malfoy.
Malfoy scanned Harry’s face up and down, and let go of his shirt.
Harry stared up at Hagrid, in disbelief.
“No! Mother- Mum!” Draco said, losing his composure, and the vice like grip of the Auror's hand was suddenly around his bruised arm again, tugging him away. He watched, breathless and with the pain of a dagger stabbing his chest as his mother shrank before him, his neck twisting unnaturally over his shoulder to see her for as long as he could. He blinked, feeling tears rolling down his cheeks and off his chin. Before they hit the floor there was a loud crack, vanishing Draco and the Auror from sight, leaving behind 2 dark teardrop stains on the stone floor.
“My life, for yours.” Narcissa smiled again. A small smile fully of love and hope.
He looked at Draco, furiously, through sweaty strands of hair. Bastard.
“Mother.” Draco clenched his jaw. She looked up at him, eyes glimmering.
He flicked through the paper absently. The news had been very quiet over Christmas, so he wasn't expecting anything interesting. He turned the pages, until a photograph of a familiar blonde boy made his heart race and his temperature rise.
“THAT. IS. ENOUGH!” Headmistress McGonagall rushed out through the swinging front doors into the courtyard, cloak billowing heavily behind her. She looked furious. She rushed towards them and spelled them unforgivingly apart, sending the two flying in opposite directions across the courtyard, both skidding harshly to a stop.
They stood in a barren hall, a sort of ante-chamber; old, crumbling concrete boxing them in. In front of him he saw a gate that stretched the length of the room, with a small corridor-like space behind it. the metal bars occasionally curled into strange words Draco couldn't make sense of. A cold feeling trickled down his spine as he saw two more Aurors standing on the other side of the gate. Where were they? Draco had thought he was to be taken back to the Manor for the Christmas holidays. Draco looked around, trying to discern his location from the room. He looked up, and his stomach dropped. a blue glow stretched above them, and behind it, black robed figures floated ominously. Draco swallowed and returned his gaze to the gate. A horrible realisation had sunk through him. He knew where he was.
Harry pointed Draco’s wand at the boy, and sent a revival spell at him. Draco jolted and his eyes opened blearily. Harry noticed the piercing blue was back.
“Tea, Potter?” Harry tore his eyes from the painting of Dumbledore and looked at McGonagall. She was sitting at her polished desk, dressed in black robes and a witches’ hat, with her arm gesturing towards a pair of china cups on the desk. To Harry’s relief, she was smiling.
“‘Arry I couldn't tell ye. He just was floatin’ there on the surface. Very sad, they reckon he was here since the founders built the place. Its not just that though, It's very strange actually. The Mer-people’ve been tellin’ me some of their lot bin goin’ missin’, even now. But I’ve not found nothin’ yet that explains it. I offered to ‘ave the Mer-people moved to a lake nearby, and tha’ we could protect it for ‘em, but they’re havin’ none of it. Stubborn beings, ‘Arry. Course, you’d know all abou’ that.”
“I don't know what you're laughing about, Ginny, you have the same homework as I do.”
“You’re going to pay for that one, Potter.” Malfoy said in a familiar drawl, which made Harry’s heart skip a beat, and adrenaline run through his body. Malfoy started to undress quickly, and Harry deciding this was a good time for a head start, swam in the opposite direction. He heard a huge splash, and the wave engulfed him from behind. A second later, he felt two arms wrap around his shoulders and pull him under the water. Water filled his ears, and air escaped his lips, the sound of the underwater wrestling match making a strange distorted bubble of noise. His feet touched the base of the pool, and he pushed up, forcing them both through the water and above the surface, he took a deep breath and pulled Malfoy in front of him, and they both burst into fits of laughter, their hair wet and tangled and covered in bubbles.
“That doesn’t mean to say this year will be easy. NEWT’s are still extremely difficult qualifications, and will require your full attention and effort.” Harry smiled. If there was anyone who could make Harry feel like an ordinary student, it was McGonagall.
“The Burrow!” Before stepping into the tingling flames and vanishing in a flash of light.
“Of course I haven't forgotten, Potter. I think it’s just a bit… broken after what happened last year.” Harry remembered the Fiendfyre, and felt disappointed in himself for not considering what kind of damage that had likely done to the Room. Harry didn't falter though. He took a couple of steps towards Malfoy, eyeing him up. He could see Malfoy better now. His white hair was glowing amber slightly, and his eyes flickered with the reflection of the fire next to him. He was wearing his usual white shirt with the sleeves rolled up over his elbows, half tucked into tight black trousers. He could see he was a little flustered, and his lips were parted. Harry smiled darkly. Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
Harry looked at the parchment in his hands. This letter that came every year for him had miraculously appeared for him again for the eighth year. Of course he was going back. He’d had countless offers of jobs from all over the Ministry, the Aurors, Curse Breakers, even the Department of Mysteries had owl’d him. But none of that seemed even remotely appealing to Harry anymore.
And so, with a huge smile and a wave of his giant hand, which sent a gust that lifted Harry's hair and stung his eyes, Hagrid turned and walked out of the paved courtyard, and down towards his hut on the side of the sparkling, still lake.
“Potter.” Harry paused at hearing his name escape Malfoy’s lips, and turned to face him. He’d stepped into the room, just slightly, one foot inside the threshold.
“As much as I enjoyed this little play fight Potter, I must now insist you stay the fuck away from me. Unless of course, you decide to do what is right and return to me what’s mine.” Draco's expression settled into a dark, warning look, and he disappeared behind the wall. Harry heard him opening his door and almost immediately heard it slam shut again.
Harry considered this. He remembered how dark and murky it was in the Lake, and how inconceivably massive it was under the surface. He personally thought it would be pretty easy to go missing down there, but if this was unusual for the Mer-people, then maybe something really wasn't right.
Harry looked intently at his Headmistress, dubious at the serious inflection of her voice.
Harry’s hands were getting so sore with paper cuts that he promised himself that the next time he saw Malfoy, he was going to pay for it. But Malfoy had seen him first, sending a tripping spell his way in the corridors, resulting in Harry flying into a group of second years, who had screamed as Harry's now broad, 18 year old form knocked a good 4 of them over. Harry had lost it at that point, and turned to find Malfoy doubled over with laughter, which quickly changed to a nasty grin as he saw Harry get up off the floor and pull out his wand. A few spells later, they were battling fiercely.
“Yea me too.”
One afternoon, Harry was sat alone in the library struggling to write his potions essay. It was spring, and extremely hot for so early in the season, the sun beating down on Harry through the tall glass windows between the bookcases. Harry’s foot tapped irritably, and he turned his quill in the hand that wasn't holding the weight of his head in its palm. It was too hot. Harry's clothes were clinging to his body, even wearing just a thin shirt, he could feel his sweat making the too-tight material stick to his skin. His glasses slipped down his quickly moistening face, and he pushed them back up with the end of his feathered quill. He read over the sentence he’d written, and after reading it over and over again without taking in any of the meaning, he slammed his quill down on the wooden desk and leaned back in his chair, the hand he was leaning on reaching up and tangling in his damp hair. He felt a bead of sweat roll down the underside of his chin and down his neck as he stretched his head back, before the sound of clattering dropped books made him tilt his head towards the noise. He blinked.
“What kind of duelling space do you call this Malfoy? Forget how to use the Room of Requirement?” Harry mocked. Malfoy sneered and gripped his want tighter.
“Merlin- Harry what in the world…” But Harry cut him off with a crushing kiss. Only for a moment did Malfoy resist, but Harry felt his shoulders soften under his arms, and he reciprocated the kiss, bringing his own arms around Harry. Harry pulled away and gave Malfoy a small smile. He looked up at the embracing couple.
“They'll do a great job.” Harry looked at the reflection of the fire on the side of his teacup and thought about Ginny. They had called off their relationship when Harry had told her he felt her more as a sister than a lover. She had taken it extremely well, which made Harry think maybe she was having the same feelings too, but had been too afraid to voice them after all Harry had been through. He still loved her very much, and couldn't wait to see her face when she found out she had been chosen for Head Girl.
“Will you shut up!” He shouted. “Stop laughing Potter!” Malfoy demanded petulantly. Harry's laughter trailed off, so that he was reduced to giggling, and he leaned back against the wall with his legs bent and wide apart, looking up at Malfoy through strands of black hair, raising an amused eyebrow. He loved seeing Malfoy wound up like this, and now he knew precisely why.
Fighting with Draco never had never ended so well, and breaking the rules had never felt so good.
They finally reached the Hogwarts grounds, Harry a little out of breath and a lot warmer from the exercise. They crossed the lawn and walked along the edge of the Forbidden Forest until they saw the Lake and Hagrid’s Hut come into view. Harry had felt a little guilty for not having gone to visit Hagrid over the last 2 months, only seeing him in passing at meals and in the corridors- he’d been incredibly busy with studying, so felt much better now that he had a reason to pay him a visit. Hagrid would be really happy to see him, and with the added bonus of Ron too, he knew Hagrid would be thrilled.
“Do what?”
“What?”
“Also, do you think I’d be dumb enough to leave it at Hogwarts over the Holidays?” Harry said, knowing full well the wand wasn't here at all. His statement made Malfoy's eyes dart around the room once more. But then his gaze settled on Harry's broad, imposing figure, considered him for a moment, and then frowned.
He looked up at Ron grinning, but his smile faltered when he saw the twisted expression on Ron's face.
“Got it.” Harry said.
“I think I’ve transferred it to you.”
Narcissa stepped closer and wrapped her hands around the bars between them, leaning close.
Hermione had demanded at breakfast one morning. Harry had just sent a first years’ quill and parchment flying across the Great Hall ‘by accident’ when he’d asked for his autograph. Harry looked incredulously at her, her bushy hair bristling with accusations, before sighing and looking dejectedly into his cereal. If he told her exactly how he was feeling she’d think he was going mad. How could he say he missed fighting with Malfoy without sounding like a masochistic maniac?
Harry noticed an orange glow emitting from the fireplace, and saw, between hectic kisses and desperate hands reaching for forbidden places, the fire had re-lit itself in the hearth. It was like the Room of Requirement approved, and Harry buzzed with pleasure and contentment. The room knew, before either of them, this was exactly what it was needed for.
“I don’t have it.” Harry strained to speak.
“It must be a side effect of the curse. We have to endure each others pain while we are alive.” Harry thought about this, but couldn't quite determine how he felt about it. On one hand, he felt bad for having to share his own pain with Malfoy, but at the same time he was glad that he could help Malfoy bear the burden of his own. He let go of Draco’s hand and reached up to his face, running it along the soft cheek down to the crook of his neck. He smiled.
“Oh, I can't believe it Harry. Mums going to be so pleased!” Ginny threw herself into Harrys’ chest, winding him, and he embraced the Weasley, struggling to breathe. Over her shoulder he saw McGonagall give a little smirk, then drink from her goblet. Harry grinned and pulled away from Ginny and instinctively looked across the table at Neville, who also clutched a piece of parchment in his hands. However, his face was contorted with confusion rather than joy.
McGonagall bellowed in her thick Scottish accent. Harry shot a glance at Draco, who was on his side leaning on one arm, breathing heavily, completely soaked with water and Harry's blood. His wet hair fell over his eyes, and he sneered up at McGonagall. Harry grimaced seeing his own blood smeared across Draco’s face. Draco ran his tongue over his bottom lip and retracted it, tasting Harry’s blood. He looked at Harry, and shot him a dangerous smirk through tendrils of wet hair. Harry felt a weight in his stomach and spat out some of the blood that had pooled around his own mouth, maintaining eye contact with Draco.
Harry exhaled sharply in annoyance.
“I don’t know, I just… I think I felt what you were feeling for a moment. When you were looking at the glass.” Malfoy blinked, and unconsciously reached up to his chest.
Harry frowned and pushed back his dark hair. After a few moments, he leaned back into the chair and sighed, thinking about the picture of the Malfoy’s he had seen in the prophet a few days ago. Draco did look dejected, and miserable, and without his wand Harry didn't really think he was much of a threat to the students of Hogwarts anymore. Plus, coming back to Hogwarts would mean there were plenty of eyes on him to keep him in shape if he ever did step out of line. McGonagall cleared her throat.
Harry considered Neville’s words. He was right, getting involved with the Ministry would cause a lot of unwanted attention from the public, and as Neville had pointed out, the wand was now technically his if he’d won it from Malfoy. The Ministry couldn’t argue with that. He wasn’t withholding evidence if it was his wand now, right? Also Harry thought about Ron, who knew about this wand situation, but evidently hadn’t told his higher-ups about its true whereabouts, so Harry felt a little more at ease knowing Ron didn’t think it was necessary for Harry to be outed as the true owner, either.
Harry thought back to him trying to sneak a wand into Hogwarts. There must be something more to that right? Why would he do something like that? He must be up to something, he must have something he was meaning to do.
“If I was you Harry I’d stay out of all this. You won it, you say? It works for you?”
Harry faltered when he saw the look on Malfoy’s face. He looked defeated.
“I saw the papers. Your mother...” Harry paused, and swallowed the dry lump in his throat he had procured as he watched a crease in Draco’s eyebrows form.
“Kreacher, can you fetch it please?” Harry said, expression painfully set in a forced smile. Without another word, Kreacher bowed, and disappeared with a crack, reappearing seconds later with a long black wand clutched between his two small fists. Harry leaned down and took the wand, and held it up in his right hand, examining it in the sunlight from the window. It was shinier than he remembered it. Cleaner. He imagined Kreacher had probably restored and polished the thing.
“You’re too late. We defeated them, there’s no danger. And will you please not point your wand at Draco, he’s the one who broke the curse.” Harry aimed his last statement at the bald wizard. The Auror did not move. Ron, having recovered his breath, stood back up, and looked incredulously at the blonde.
Malfoy quickly recovered though, faster than Harry had anticipated and sent a spell flying towards him, a hex he didn't recognise. Harry managed to cast Protego just in time, which made the unknown spell ricochet into the fountain, causing a large gush of water to spray onto the crowd of people standing nearby with a loud splash. Harry hated to admit it but he was enjoying this. He’d not had a proper fight in ages, and Malfoy, the bloody git, had been winding him up all week with a new charm he had invented, which when cast upon parchment, made the edges razor sharp, cutting Harry’s fingertips whenever he picked up any of his papers. Impressive magic, Harry had admitted, but with utterly infuriating and painful results.
Draco stood as still as a statue in the entrance. He was on his own. The Aurors had seen him inside, and then disappeared. He couldn’t feel his legs, so he couldn't walk, not that he wanted to. This place meant nothing to him without his mother here. There was no point in it.
He stepped forward cautiously, avoiding the mess left on the floor.
Harry got the last button open, revealing Draco’s pale chest. He ran his hands over it, toying with Draco’s raised nipples, making the other arch his back into his touch.
“Alright Potter, Merlin, this is such a mess.” Malfoy shook his head and squeezed his eyes closed. Harry waited.
Draco pushed his arms forward into a breaststroke and kicked off, swimming into the lake further. He swam gracefully, appearing unconcerned with the freezing temperature, and eventually stopped, treading water about 10 metres from the shore. Harry saw Draco, his hair damp at the base of his neck and the collar of his submerged shirt poking above the surface, turn over, his chest rising above the water, and his pale face staring up to the moon. His eyes fluttered closed, and he floated on the surface, his arms spread like an offering, illuminated by the silvery glow. Harry watched, entranced, staring at the boy in the lake. He saw how the muscles of Malfoy’s chest were exposed through the wet shirt stuck against it, and his angular face highlighted by the glittering rays of moonlight. Harry slowly took his seat again, eyes transfixed on the floating boy below him. Harry felt a concerned confusion rush through him as he watched Malfoy. For one, it was incredibly cold, it couldn’t be far from freezing, and second, there was the issue of the lake, and whatever was happening within its depths. Malfoy would have no idea of its dangers. Harrys fist gripped at the armchair, short nails digging into the material, feelings conflicting in his mind. What the hell was Malfoy playing at? Going for a swim in the lake late at night? And with no magic? Did he have a death wish? Harry thought about his odd behaviour over the last few weeks and gulped. He had been so unconcerned, emphatic and just… so alone. Harry hadn’t seen him talking to anyone. Actually, he was pretty sure the only person Malfoy had actually communicated with since returning was himself. And he hadn’t seemed bothered by it. He’d given up.
“You're going to have to use me as bait if you want to stand a chance.” Draco said. He looked confused but let Harry lead the way. Harry didn't like this idea at all but it made sense to draw them out, get them out in the open.
“I think you're going to be the best Head Boy and Girl Hogwarts has ever seen.” Harry said simply. Like McGonagall had said, Neville and Ginny had done an outstanding job of protecting Hogwarts whilst under the rule of the Carrow's, and Harry thought this was the perfect way to recognise all they did for the school during its darkest days. Neville's face relaxed, and he allowed himself a grin.
“I’ll be back in a few days!” Harry called, and went to the fireplace, shoving his hand into a vase, taking a big handful of green powder. He threw it into the fireplace, emerald flames engulfing the dark chasm, and said,
“So, What brings me the pleasure of this visit? I ‘bin expecting to see you soon Harry, but Ron?” Hagrid sat down with his own mug and sipped at it, looking with raised eyebrows at Ron.
Filled with a renewed energy from spending time with Ron and Hagrid, Harry returned to his dorm happily, and checked the clock on his wall. He would keep his word to Ron, and stay up late tonight, just in case the cloak figure returned to the lake. After today's inconclusive detective session however, Harry doubted very much they were connected to the mystery of the lake. Even so, Harry was wide awake, and didn’t really mind spending his evening looking out over the stunning grounds from his warm bedroom.
“We will hold them off until then, Malfoy lets go!” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and strode towards the lake.
Harry yelled suddenly, pulling out his wand and sending the spell hurling towards Malfoy, who expertly blocked it, and almost instantly countered it with a wordless spell of a huge jet of yellow sparks. Harry dived out of the way, sending a wordless spell of his own back at Draco on his way down, which caught his shoulder and sent him staggering sideways. Harry yelled in triumph and got back to his feet, steadying himself against the back of a nearby sofa. Wordless magic from Malfoy? He was impressed. Nothing he couldn't handle though. He sent a hex speeding at Draco, who was also firing a spell, and the two jets of magic collided with a bang, sending red hot sparks showering across the room. Harry yelled a shout of excited glee and sent another spell whizzing towards Draco. Spell after spell, hex after hex zipped maniacally through the room, destroying the peaceful environment, turning it into the battlefield they had so desired. The two boys danced around each other, testing each others abilities, occasionally landing a spell which would send the other skidding across the wooden floor, earning the other a moment to take a breath, or laugh with victorious derision. Harry had started to sweat, and could feel a few parts of his body getting sore, and his jeans start to stick uncomfortably, but he kept going. This was exactly what he needed, and when he could make out Malfoy through the sparks and smoke of the battle, he saw him mirrored with the same flushed grin and tangled hair as himself. Panting heavily, Harry sent some more jinxes ringing, a few catching ornaments around the cosy room, obliterating them into pieces, sending bits of glass, pottery and wood slashing like razors through the air.
“We have to get help.” He said, looking seriously at Malfoy. “It’s the only hope we have. We need to lure them all out, and just completely obliterate the whole lot. We can round them up, I'll call the ministry, we can do this...”
Harry turned and walked back into the library to find Draco running his hands over the ancient leather books on the shelves of the library. Harry halted, and watched his slender fingers gently caress the leathery spines. He didn't say anything, appreciating seeing Malfoy with his guard down again, unaware of Harry's presence behind him. This vulnerable side of Malfoy that Harry had grown to care for. Harry coughed, alerting Malfoy to his presence, and the other looked over his shoulder, his hand stopping on a book when he saw his wand clutched in Harry's palm. He turned around and crossed his arms, looking back up at Harry.
“What? The Squid? That thing was huge, how on earth-”
A huge pulse of energy rippled outwards from Malfoy, the water forming in waves emitting from his body. There was a deep, bass-y thud, and a wall of heat hit Harry, making his eyes water. Harry’s grip tightened on the boulder. A few moments later, all was still again. Harry stared, waiting. What had Malfoy done? He was still stood in the lake, still as always. Harry didn't move.
A figure, cloaked and unrecognisable, slipped into Harry’s vision, emerging into the window frame from the bottom right corner, evidently having come from the castle. Harry started, and leaned closer to the window, his heart beat quickening. No way. He watched as the figure repeated the journey they had made the last time Harry had seen them, and sat back down on the same boulder as before. Harry looked up into the sky, the clear night showing off the beautiful constellations of the stars up above. Harry looked back down. It wouldn’t rain this time. Maybe he’d get more time to watch the figure and work out what on earth he was doing, or even who it was.
Harry didn't have to wait long before he got an explanation for Malfoy’s absence. It came in the form of his Daily Prophet, which was dropped in his cereal the next morning by a ruffled looking post-owl. Harry saw the article as he browsed the paper, and his pulse quickened when he saw the photograph of Malfoy being escorted from Malfoy Manor beside the title of the article. He skimmed through the piece until he found what he was looking for.
Harry received an owl at breakfast one morning in November. It dropped a letter onto his toast, and Harry sleepily picked up the grease-stained letter and turned it over. His heart skipped with joy when he recognised the untidy scrawl of Ron's handwriting. Harry tore the letter open, unfolded the parchment and began reading eagerly, hearing Ron’s voice through his choice of words and expressive handwriting.
“How long?” Draco croaked. Narcissa blinked and her forced smile faltered.
“No, sir. I… I’ll be going now.”
Draco sunk to his knees before the hearth. He closed his eyes, and his mind slowly resurfaced. And there, he saw Potter. Trapped beneath him with Draco’s dagger pressing a divot in the dark skin of his pulsing neck. Draco replayed the memory in his mind, only slightly aware of the burning sensation melting his icy demeanour. Harry's heavy breaths had lifted Draco’s body slightly as Harry had panted that the wand wasn't in Hogwarts. Then a painful memory of the head butt - Draco rubbed the site on his head, the lump that had grown there still slightly present under his fingertips. And then the weight of Harry above him made Malfoy breathless once more. It had unsettled him at the time. He’d had no physical contact with anyone like that. Draco felt his heart hammer against his chest at the memory. He’d looked up into Potter’s face, all red and full of life. It hurt to think about how very different they were. Harry was red, and he was green. Warm vs Cold. Happiness vs Misery. The weight of Harry had been real in that moment. Everything Draco had felt of him came to the surface, looking up at the boy who’d informed his entire life, pressing down on him, commanding him once again. Draco thought he’d never get free from that. A part of him didn't want to. It was easy there. Safe, almost. Draco felt himself go hot and forced himself to not linger on that moment. He had got away after all. He still wasn’t sure how; Potter had the upper hand. Draco remembered Harry’s face after he’d mocked him about binding him up and a knot tightened itself in his stomach. No, Harry’ d lost control because it was unexpected, nothing else. If anything he’d probably been disgusted. That must have been it. The weirdness of their position probably made him recoil. Draco had spat something at him, and rounded the corner, entering his own room and collapsing on his bed, with his heart pounding. He’d gripped his dagger painfully tight in his hand, the events of a few seconds prior burning itself into his memory.
“I need it.” He said, a little louder. His chin was raised, and he looked at Harry with a meaningful glare. Harry's pulse quickened a little. This was the most fight he'd seen from Malfoy all year. If only he could make it last longer, get the real Malfoy to emerge through this strange veiled version of himself.
The days went by quickly. The lessons flew by uneventfully, and Harry tried his very best to concentrate on taking it all in. He shared all of them with Ginny, so made the most of her help, as Hermione wasn’t around to copy from or explain things to him. Ginny, luckily, was also very clever, and they helped each other with classwork. He missed Ron desperately, and Hogwarts really wasn’t the same without him, but Harry just tried to remember how happy Ron was being part of the Auror's, and that made him feel a little better.
“Are you listening to me?”
“Hello Mate!
Harry’s pulse quickened as he watched. He’d been right. Malfoy was up to something. Of course he was. Harry internally shook himself for ever doubting his instincts.
He looked up momentarily as something moved in the corner of his vision. One of the many portraits in their fancy frames had shifted, it’s eyes trained on the boy below him. Draco looked up and met the gaze of one of his ancestors. It was a fierce looking man in Edwardian fashion, that sat in front of the very same fireplace Draco was standing beside, but this version glimmered with orange flames. They held each other's gaze for a moment, before the portrait pulled out his wand from beneath his robe and ceased the roaring fire behind him, the warm colours of the painting shifting to match the monochrome pallet of the real world. Draco nodded, appreciating the gesture. But his eyes lingered on the wand the man held in his hand and something inside of him lurched with sudden urgency. His wand. He could finally get his wand back. And once he was reunited with it he could finally finish what he'd been trying to do all year.
“I don’t! I mean, I do, but not here- It’s not here.”  Harry said, desperately. Malfoy froze, a flash of panic in his eyes.
Harry pushed the letter back into the envelope and tossed it into the trunk. His eyes wandered over the messy contents, illuminated by the orange light, and then followed it through the window, looking out at the glorious view of the cold winter evening outside. The lake shimmered golden, the frozen patches mirroring the warm light back into the sky, and a question dawned over him. Malfoy. Where would he go during Christmas? Would he remain here? Harry turned back towards his desk, fumbling with the papers on the surface to find the most recent copy of the Prophet, which he picked up and rifled through, eyes skimming its pages to find the name “Malfoy” anywhere in its articles. After flicking through the whole thing and finding no mention of the family, Harry frowned and rubbed his eyes. What if Malfoy was staying at Hogwarts? What if he went into the lake while Harry wasn’t here and something happened to him? He should tell someone what he’d seen. But then… if he did that, Malfoy would be in all sorts of trouble. He didn’t want to destroy whatever solace Malfoy had from going down to the lake at night, however bizarre Harry thought it was. Harry's brain whirred, before he came to a conclusion. He’d stay here, at Hogwarts just for one night extra, just in case. If he saw Malfoy going down to the lake again, he'd have to tell someone. If he didn’t go down then he must have gone home, or somewhere else for Christmas at least.
“What is it master is looking for? Perhaps Kreacher can be of assistance.” Kreacher said, blinking up at Harry. Harry strongly doubted this, Kreacher didn't really do much housekeeping in his old age, but Harry decided to indulge him anyway.
“You have no idea what you’ve just done.”
“Never mind. Kreacher, just… Find Hagrid. I think he's away for the holidays but you’re good at finding people- find him just like you found Mundungus. Tell him to go to Hogwarts, and tell him Harry says the lake is more dangerous than we thought. Go! Now!” Harry gestured Kreacher away with his hands. Kreacher blinked, the old house elf looked confused, but he eventually bowed, and vanished once more.
“Somebody had to win.” Harry retorted, spluttering slightly, realising his mouth was starting to taste of blood again. Malfoy pulled his head back slowly and looked intensely at Harry, and Harry at him. He noticed Malfoy had a pretty deep cut severing his eyebrow that was oozing dark red blood into his hair, which was dishevelled and curling, sticking to his brow where the blood soaked it, and his face, neck and top of his exposed chest were gleaming with sweat. Malfoy was pressing hard on Harry's body still, and grinned, maintaining his eye contact with Harry.
“Ron, you never told me the dark detector sent signals to the ministry.” Harry said. Ron looked slightly sheepish.
Neville stared at him.
“I don't want a job in the Ministry. I don't want a job anywhere. I just...”
“This is bad. Really bad. You know how Inferi works, don’ ya Harry?” Hagrid looked in disgust down at Malfoy. “There’s gotta be a host.” He said in a loud whisper.
“Well, If anyone can think of no other reason for us to stay, I think our work here is, well, done.” the Aurors looked at one another, and made small noises of agreement. Harry couldn't help but to find it slightly amusing at the disappointment in some of their faces, they had expected a huge fight from the dark detectors signals.
“Didn’t bloody send me a letter though, charming! When is he coming? How did he manage to get permission?”
“Well… yea. I didn't tell you that on purpose. Didn't want you to be put off using it. You've always been bloody useless at asking for help, mate.” Harry laughed, and Ron grinned guiltily. Harry’s laughter died down, and he stepped towards Ron, putting a hand on his arm.
Harry kicked around in the water, and resurfaced, opening his eyes and taking in the grey cold scene before him.
McGonagall looked at him, eyes wide and face serious. He nodded, and looked over at Malfoy instinctively, before something stung him, like a slap in the face, and made his head whip back towards McGonagall, who’s wand was pointed directly at him. Harry’s lifted his arm, hand cupping his stung cheek, and hissed in pain. He heard Malfoy laugh cruelly, but another resonating spark of magic echoed around the yard, and he was silenced, evidently struck with the same stinging jinx.
“Do me a favour then Harry, I know it's probably nothing, just a rogue curfew-breaking student probably, but just keep an eye out? Even if it's just for the next few days, and let me know if you see anything suspicious.”
Harry nodded, looking at the floor. He assumed Malfoy had nodded too, because the last thing the professor said before angrily striding back into the castle was,
Suddenly Malfoy was pressing his hips forward, making a small moan escape Harry, quickly cut of by Draco's lips crashing hard into his. Harry's brain exploded with heat and a buzzing noise filled his ears, as he moved his mouth against the blonde’s, kissing him so desperately that all logical reason completely vanished. Draco's fists moved from Harry's shirt to his dark hair, grabbing handfuls of it painfully.
“All this business with trying to sneak a wand in too, that’s been blown way out of proportion. Gosh, I’d know I’d try and get one if I couldn’t have mine, imagine being here without a wand!” Neville gestured at the room with an incredulous look.
How have you been? Hope Hogwarts isn't too boring without me. That’s why I’m writing to you actually. It's about Hogwarts, Hagrid sent me an owl not too long ago asking how I was, and he said something funny was going on with the Lake, Mer-people gone missing or something, and the Giant Squid carked it? I was gutted about that, remember when Seamus fell in and the Squid rescued him? Anyway, I thought that was a good enough excuse to come and visit! I know it's probably nothing that Hagrid can’t handle himself, but I’ve convinced Shacklebolt to let me go just in case it's caused by something dark leftover from the Battle. I’m coming this Saturday at 1, Flooing into Hogsmeade, fancy coming to meet me at the Hog’s Head?
“Oh.” Neville frowned.
“Cedric told me about it during the Triwizard Tournament. This is where I discovered the clue about the lake. The golden eggs, remember?” Malfoy nodded, entranced. He approached the edge of the bath, and he squatted down and touched one of the taps, a green jewel adorning the top. Malfoy turned the handle, and a bubbling green stream of water came pouring out of it, and a minty smell filled the air. Draco smiled up at Harry, eyes glimmering with wonder, reminding Harry of a small child. It made his heart ache. Steam started to fog the room, dulling the bright colours of the stained glass. Harry felt a strange twist of sadness looking at the mermaids in the glass. He didn't know where this guilt was coming from and a crease formed in his brow. He looked at Malfoy, who too was looking at the mermaids. He looked pale, and Harry approached him and took his hand. The feeling of guilt washed away when Malfoy looked into his eyes. Harry couldn't help the chuckle that escaped him.
After the sorting ceremony and the always incredible feast, (Harry hadn't realised how much he'd missed treacle tart, and proceeded to have 4 helpings.) Harry and the other 8th years went to their new common room. He beamed as he watched his friends take in the new scenery, all oohing and ahhing at the incredible collection of history the room was museum to. Here and there he heard comparisons to the old dormitories (“well the library isn't exactly as vast as the one in Ravenclaw tower…” “he fireplace in Gryffindor was double the size of this one!”) but on the whole it seemed everyone was satisfied with the new living arrangements, especially with the addition of the new private bedrooms. Harry quickly learned that his guess about the door handles was correct, when a screech of pain was heard from the boys landing. The other boys ran up the stairs and found Seamus on his knees in front of one of the doors, one hand wrapped around the other.
“He misses you.” Ginny muttered, gesturing lazily at the letter in Harry’s hand. Harry just smirked, and carried on eating his breakfast, the exciting prospect of seeing his best friend again in two days giving him the motivation to get through the rest of the week.
Harry appeared with a pop at the top of Hogsmeade, only slightly losing his balance on the steep incline. He had decided against taking the Hogwarts Express to school now that he was a fully legal wizard, and could apparate close enough to the school. It also meant he wouldn’t have to deal with the crowds of people clamouring over him like every other time he stepped out into the public wizarding community.
Harry sat up. He’d definitely not expected that answer.
“You are fucking infuriating Potter.” He breathed through strands of white hair.
“Well then, Mr Malfoy. I expect to see you back here in January for the beginning of term. I expect you’ll be returning in the same manner?” McGonagall aimed her last statement at the two Aurors. Malfoy just remained still, eyes now downcast.
A torn piece of paper floated underneath Harry's nose, making him jump. It landed gently on top of his essay, and Harry looked up to try and identify the sender. His eyes scanned the book cases, but no one was there. He blinked back down at the blank parchment and reached to turn it over.
‘S’fine. It was a rubbish report anyway, can't do anything the morning after a raid. What did you need my stationary for?”
“As such, may I ask for your opinion on whom I should instead bestow this privilege?”
“I did want that, Professor, until I actually spent months chasing and fighting dark wizards. I think I've had enough of that, at least for the time being.” Harry paused, and bit on his custard cream. He didn't know what else to say. He didn't really want to tell her all the reasons, like the fear, the self doubt, the need for feeling like he belonged. However, looking up at McGonagall and seeing her serious face soften, he got the feeling she knew what he meant.
“Shhh Ginny, you’ll scare the first years.” Harry grinned as he watched her freckled face fill with pure joy. They were sat at the Gryffindor table, the evening sun bathing the Great Hall in an orange glow, waiting for the first years to arrive for the sorting ceremony. The sun trickled in through the windows, the last warm light of the day, and shone onto Ginny’s body, setting her orange hair aflame.
They climbed the steep path back up to the castle side by side, while Ron filled Harry in on everything he’d been up to since Harry’ d left for Hogwarts 2 months ago. Harry listened as Ron explained enthusiastically about tracking down Death Eaters, undoing curses and confiscating dark objects from questionable wizards. Harry was seriously impressed. Ron sounded like he’d really come along, he’d obviously learned so much from the other Auror's and Shacklebolt - He was on almost every single raid they’d been on, and even taken down a couple of Death Eaters himself.
Harry got to his feet instantly. Malfoy had been released? Dread filled his chest as he realised what that meant. He looked around desperately, trying to find a quill and ink, but there was nothing, so he hurriedly transfigured a nearby bread knife into a muggle pen and grabbed the Daily Prophet, rifling through it to find the emptiest space. He scrawled a note for the Weasley’s thanking them and apologising for not saying goodbye, and tore it from the paper, slapping it down in the centre of the table. He chucked the coffee-soaked towel into the sink, and hurried into the living room where his case and rucksack stood in front of the huge fireplace. Harry grabbed a handful of green powder from the flower pot, said “12 Grimmauld Place”, and threw the powder into the hearth. He grabbed his things, and without even a backwards glance, stepped into the roaring green flames.
“Look at this. They're asking for evidence against the Malfoy’s. I wanted to write a letter to the department of Magical Law Enforcement.”
The three of them stood in a line, facing the still lake at its shore. There was a cold breeze, making the edge of the water lap at the pebbles and dirt that bordered the body of water, but the surface remained still like glass. Harry stared out into the vastness and felt a bit stupid. How were they going to find out if there was any dark magic in the lake? He glanced over his shoulder at Ron, who was rummaging in his coat pockets, eventually pulling out his wand, and a small object Harry didn’t recognise. Ron noticed Harry’s intrigue and held it up for him to see clearly. It looked a bit like a snitch, but it was silver, and had a flatter body and dragonfly-like wings.
A clanging sound emitted from the other side of the gate, and a metal door swung open from the right hand wall. An Auror stepped through, leading a blonde figure behind him, who Draco recognised immediately.
“Quick, turn off the taps!” They both scrambled around the bath, hurriedly turning taps and laughing as the water flooded the room. Once they were all off, Harry stood still and looked at Draco from over the bubbles. He grinned. Malfoy’s cheeks went a little pink. Without a word Harry grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled the damp thing over his head, and chucked it aside. He watched Malfoy watching him. Malfoy folded his arms and raised his brow. Harry’s grin widened and he undid his jeans, pulling the wet denim down and kicking them off. Malfoy didn't move.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Malfoy demanded, his chest heaving, red faced and bloody lipped. Harrys blood.
“You can see the lake from your window you say?” Ron asked.
Harry blinked, and smiled gratefully through watering eyes.
Feeling a little more satisfied, Harry finished packing, but left out one more day's worth of clothes and essentials. He’d owl Ron, telling him he would be arriving on Saturday instead, Mrs Weasley surely wouldn’t mind. And tonight he would watch the lake once more, dutifully, to make sure Malfoy was safe.
“Well its probably a good thing its not dark magic. But it’s not helped us get any closer to an answer. Thanks for tryin’ though Ron, I really do appreciate you comin’ ‘ere.” Hagrid patted Ron with a large hand on the shoulder, making Ron’s knees buckle under the weight of it. He grinned up at Hagrid.
Harry loosened his grip around his wand. Seeing Draco like this made some part of his annoying brain a bit slow. Was he actually feeling sorry for Draco Malfoy? He sighed, and took a step towards Malfoy, taking his hands out of his pockets, and rubbed his eyes.
Harry and Draco walked through the grand entrance doors and into the cold, quiet castle. Harry would usually feel slightly uneasy walking through this place when it was so empty like this, but today it just felt peaceful. The warm feeling of having been bonded to Draco lingered over him, for the first time in a long time, he felt truly safe.
Ron gave a last wave to Harry, before hurrying after the Aurors back up the hill towards the exit of the Hogwarts grounds. Hagrid was deep in conversation with a couple of mer-people, and Harry knew he wouldn't mind if he and Draco slipped away too.
The thought of Malfoy only slightly ruined the festive spirit for Harry. Now that he had the wand safe in his possession, he could relax. There was no way he could get it. The small possibility that his home may be being broken into at any given time still lingered, but Harry tried to ignore the concern that rose in his chest when he thought about it. The memory of Malfoy pinning him down on his bed would occasionally seep into Harry's thoughts too, particularly after a few wines, which Harry didn't appreciate.
Harry felt himself about to disagree with Neville, but stopped, considering his words. This wasn't the first time he'd heard someone defend Malfoy, and Harry had started to feel more sympathetic towards the boy, to his own utter surprise.
After muttering the password (still ‘Dumbledore’) and ascending up the revolving staircase, Harry knocked lightly on the door of the Headmistress’s office. He swallowed, feeling slightly nervous. Maybe he was being a bit presumptuous, coming up here uninvited all of a sudden.
The sun had set and Harry’s room was dark, so he decided to take a nice long shower, and forget about everything entirely. There was no point. He may as well focus on his studying, try to forget about Malfoy and keep his promise to McGonagall. “Like a good little Gryffindor.” Sirius’s mocking voice chimed in the back of his mind, but he shook his head and pushed the thought aside. Being reckless wasn’t necessary anymore. There were no more secrets. He had won. There was nothing left to defeat. Now all he had to do was live alongside those he had defeated.
“Harry grinned at his best friend, and allowed himself to feel the elation he’d had when he read his letter. He was going back to Hogwarts.
“Calm down, calm down. I think from Malfoy's explanation he was indeed forced to perform this curse. I would say, after all he has been through, he needs no more punishment.” Replied Kingsley, and Harry stared at him. His dark eyes glistened, and he nodded once at Harry.
“It sounds like the bond between Malfoy and the Inferi has been transferred to you, Harry.” Ron said, sounding like someone giving bad news to a family about a loved one. Harry and Malfoy looked at each other, victorious smiles reflecting between them. This was the confirmation they’d been waiting for. The warmth of magic between them swelled. Ron stared at Harry, as if he had gone mad.
On Christmas morning gifts were exchanged excitedly, and after Harry had opened his usual collection of knitted garments and baked goods, Ron passed him a small box with a red ribbon adorning it. Harry looked up at him quizzically.
Startled, he whipped his head towards the voice, which was emitting from a confused looking Neville, standing beside him. Harry ran his hand through his hair and blinked up at the other boy. Neville looked at Harry, then his eyes darted over to Malfoy, then back again. Harry cleared his throat.
“Make me.”
“I can smell burning.”  Mrs Pince whispered sharply. Harry raised his eyebrows and shrugged, although he couldn't help a small smile curling on his lips. He felt slightly ecstatic at the idea of a midnight duel with Malfoy, especially in the Room of Requirement, where they could go for hours and no one would hear them. He was going to get out all this pent up rage and anger, and Harry couldn't feel more darkly excited. Mrs Pince’s eyebrows creased. Harry knew he'd been caught.
Harry pulled his knitted scarf up over his chin and nuzzled his face into it. It was bloody freezing for November. Hogsmeade was topped with a thin layer of white frost, which even by lunch time, was still present over every surface. It was beautiful, Harry admitted, but the only redeeming factor of the biting cold he was currently enduring. He raised his arm, shaking his sleeve back to reveal the face of his gold watch. The hands read 1.15pm. Late. Harry rolled his eyes and re-enveloped his cold hand back into his sleeve by shaking the cuff over his wrist and crossing his arms tightly. Of course Ron was late. Harry stood waiting outside the Hogs Head, watching as the many witches, wizards and Hogwarts students bustled up and down the street. Eventually he heard a CRACK in the distance, and glanced up the street, seeing his best friend emerge from behind a group of students.
Bloody hell. He’d barely slept. Harry glanced back into his dark room, and knowing that he would never get back to sleep now and wake up in time for classes, closed its door and followed Seamus down into the common room for a very early cup of tea, attempting to leave all thoughts of Malfoy and the Lake on the dormitory landing.
Harry proceeded to set up a cosy little cove in front of the window - he transfigured his hard desk chair into a comfy, chintzy one, complete with blankets and extra puffy feather pillows, then went downstairs and made himself a rich, steaming hot chocolate, another plate of custard creams appearing alongside it. He grabbed a book, and then reluctantly some homework from his desk. He may as well try and get some of that done while he was sitting there. Once he had everything set up nicely, he made himself comfortable in his chair, making sure he had the clearest possible view from his position, and looked out over the lake. The wintery weather made the surface look even more glassy, and the occasional ripples hinted at the life that thrived below. The windows of Hagrid's hut were still glowing with lights, the yellow gleam of them stretching along the lawn, before fading into greyish darkness. Harry could see the frost on the grass sparkling sharply, the blades of grass around it resembling glinting needles in the moonlight. Harry looked up and saw that it was once again a full moon, meaning a whole month had passed since he last saw the figure. Speculative, Harry looked at his watch, its glass face glinting in the candlelight that doused Harry’s room in dim, warm light. The contrast between inside of Harry’s room and out there in the cold silver night was palpable. His watch read 9.34pm. It would be another half an hour before his past self had seen the figure previously, so Harry busied himself with some transfiguration homework.
“Neville, hey, everything good?” Harry asked, forcing a smile at him. Neville reached for the seat next to Harry and sat down in it. Harry kept his eyes on Neville, urging himself to focus on him, rather than the image of Malfoy and the quill now scorched into his mind. Harry straightened up, willing his body temperature to return to normal.
She nodded. “Would you like to?”
Harry chuckled against his neck. “Oh, I don’t know. I wouldn’t say a
“Sure. I’ll… uh, see you later then.”
“I recognize the name…” Harry said, after some thought.
“That’s good to hear. The safety of my students is my primary concern. I knew about the Howlers, of course, but I wish I had known he was receiving letters with curses as well.” She gave Harry an admonishing look, and he felt a small stirring of shame.
“All right, all right,” said Harry, an attractive blush stealing across his cheeks. “You’ve both made your point.”
But if the choice he was making for himself was making him miserable, what was the point? Did he really want to do this to himself, just on the principle that he should get to live where he wanted?
“Then yes. You simply have to live here. Over time you will begin to feel a shift in the energy. And certain aspects of the house, like this family tree, will begin to heal themselves. The house will sense your desire for it and restore the images.”
He barely noticed the stirring behind him, was not fully conscious of it until he felt the presence of a warm body at his back and an arm snaking around his waist.
“And he shouldn’t want to hurt you either, if he loves you,” Pansy pointed out. “But right now he
“Because it’s a lot more fun to watch you,” said Fischer.
They finished their lunch with more pleasant small talk, until eventually it was time for Vesper to get ready for the afternoon portion of the day. She changed in the women’s locker room into her usual workout clothes: tight fitting lycra pants, a sports bra, and a matching top. It was what she always wore in the days of her training as a professional duelist, because it allowed her coach to see every aspect of her form and make corrections. Yes, in competitions she did duel in robes, like everyone else, but she didn’t rest on her laurels, and the way such clothing could hide poor technique. She strove for perfection, always.
“I have control. I knew what I was doing.”
He wondered what had woken him so early on a Sunday morning, and then he heard it, a rustling of fabric and the creak of a chair, and he turned his head to see Ginny sitting against the far wall, watching him. He felt a spike of adrenaline, remembering their painful conversation the night before, how she had left, tears still clinging to her cheeks.
“What do you think, Scorp?” Hugo asked. “You think the teachers will confiscate it all? Have your dads said anything?”
Kyle gasped and Draco kept going, tonguing the slit and enjoying the light salt of precum. He wrapped his lips around the head to take more of it in, groaning as he did. Kyle was trembling under him, breathing heavily. Draco bobbed his head once, taking Kyle about halfway in, and the brunet’s groaned echoed erotically through the otherwise empty sitting room. Draco did it again, going farther this time, and Kyle moaned in approval. A hand came up to grip Draco’s hair, but Kyle didn’t overdo it to the point of pain or try to control Draco’s movements. He was showing a tremendous amount of restraint, especially when Draco managed to fully relax his throat and take him nearly all the way inside.
“Actually, I’d rather like to learn how to make spaghetti Bolognese, if you don’t mind showing me.”
Draco shrugged. “I did it for you, and for Blaise.”
“I worry that you’re dehydrated.”
“Well, anyone in their right mind would turn away Zacharias bloody
Draco shrugged. “I suppose they really like it there.”
year that night. Anthony must have especially taken a liking to her.
“I think it’s time you and Longbottom had a fight. A real one,” Pansy said.
enjoy it was high.
Harry shook his head. “Just trying to figure out what I’m going to do about Kemp. His apprentice sent me a letter telling me that she’d kept my spot on the schedule if I want it. I don’t know if I should go.”
entering into this decision lightly, and were certainly doing so without pressure or coercion. The decision was born completely of love, and also with the understanding that this
what this is about? The Gauguin thing? Seriously? That was so, like, not a big deal,” Evan said.
“Isn’t he the reason you married Astoria in the first place?”
Mila nodded with unexpected vigor. “I understand.”
“Hey,” Harry said, aware of the obvious misery in his tone.
“So… what does that mean? I’m… trying to understand.”
“We’ll have to keep decoration simple, I’m afraid. Unless you have some exceptional piping skills I don’t know about. Molly always makes the most elaborate designs for her cakes: flowers and animals and things. My birthday cake has been a perfectly rendered giant Snitch more than once. But I’ve never got the hang of it. I’m just not very artistic, I suppose,” he finished with a heavy sigh.
Harry sighed. Of course, he knew which part Ron would fixate on. “It was something I realized that same weekend I broke up with Ginny. You haven’t exactly been talking to me for the past couple of weeks. When would I have had a chance to tell you?”
She knew that most, if not all, of the other trainees were gathering in the designated rec room for lunch, where there were tables set up, encouraging them to get to know each other. Vesper didn’t feel much like heading there, though. Instead, she thought she’d track down Ron.
“It just seems like this… arrangement has run its course. I mean, we’ve done so much… You’ve taught me so much and… last night really just felt like the final lesson I needed, you know? So I think it’s best if we leave it here.”
Draco nodded. “Or Sirius?” he asked tentatively.
“That I’d better be good to you or she’ll hex my bollocks off and keep them in a jar under her sink.”
manage everything else is too much. A house elf can take care of a lot of that. You could have so much more free time.”
“How shall we begin?” Kemp said finally.
“And we can always spend the occasional weekend at Grimmauld, if we want to get away. I can live with that. I can-“
“Saint Potter, bestowing his loving mercy upon the undeserving masses.” A familiar and disturbing sneer was twisting Draco’s face. “Well let me ask you this, if you can forgive your shitty, whingey bastard of a best mate and your snobby, bigoted bastard of a
“Nonsense,” said Harry. “All work and no play makes Draco a dull boy.”
Teddy simply nodded, still clutching against his cousin. Draco put a hand on his small blond head.
“Chemistry?” Draco asked. “What in Merlin’s name is chemistry?”
“I’m sure you are.”
“But Harry just got home,” Teddy said.
Without giving it another thought he found himself waving his wand, casting a
“I know.”
Harry hadn’t even properly invited him this time. It was just understood that they would spend it together.
Harry brushed over Draco’s prostate once, then twice, and Draco moaned loudly. “Keep doing that and I’ll come,” he said.
“Come on,” she said. “Let’s have some cake.”
wasn’t going to make me feel better.”
Harry blinked, forcing his runaway brain back to the present and trying to process what Draco had just said. “What?”
Vesper shook her head, as though this was unfathomable. “Poor Ron.”
Draco watched him a moment, trying to determine if Harry had any sense that the conversation in question had actually been about him. But Harry’s eyes were simply warm and perhaps a bit eager as he looked at Draco.
… fuck!” His containment of the curse had worked, but he couldn’t get the curse to dissolve completely. “Draco, look at me.”
After about an hour they finally made their way towards the tables, where Kyle could sit down and take a sip or two of the drink he’d barely touched. They were joined by a lesbian couple Kyle had met at a party with Max previously, and it was nice to be around people he at least knew somewhat. He’d just been introduced to more people than he’d really ever cared to know in his life, and they were all starting to blur together.
“I’ve been spending a lot of my time out of the house, and that helps.”
“Yes, that too. With any luck, that unlikely combination will narrow our field of suspects quite a bit. We’ll get them in the end, you mark my words.”
“You’d rather just help the disabled walk again.”
“Paul,” Potter said simply. The man kissed Potter full on the mouth, though it seemed to Draco friendly rather than sexual. This was further confirmed when Potter asked, “Where’s Colin? I thought you two were joined at the hip these days.”
It was not so difficult to find the path, really. Samara seemed to know her way there and, even if she hadn’t been there, Scorpius had a good sense of direction and felt confident he would have found his way. They hadn’t wandered too far, in fact.
Draco was thrown by the forcefulness of Potter’s words as he tried to reconcile them with what had just happened.
“You know what I mean,” Paul addressed Draco. “He really believes everyone is special and wonderful in their own way. He’s not faking it. That’s part of his charm. But a bloke also can’t let himself…” The redhead sighed. “Harry’s good for the ego, and he’s good for a raging libido, but a bloke can’t expect him to stick around. Those that do always wind up disappointed. But it’s their own bloody fault because Harry always makes it clear he’s not intending to stick around. He never
Draco stared down at his liberated erection, gasping at how red and hard it really was.
. Just fuck me.”
Harry wondered idly, as Tizzy prepared their tea, what it would be like to move into Malfoy Manor permanently. He had certainly gotten quite familiar with it over the years, and any bad memories from the war had been comprehensively replaced by all the good memories that came later, including their first holiday spent here. In fact, when they stayed at the manor Draco and Harry still slept in the bed in which Harry had taken Draco’s virginity almost five years ago.
Adulthood – and motherhood as well, it seemed – suited her nicely.
Draco stared at him, his face tight and wary. “It’s not the same thing.”
“Can we get you all anything else?” she asked as she took the baby from her friend and gave the girl a kiss on the cheek. “More wine, coffee?”
“It’s beautiful,” he said, wondering what it was for.
“Great. That’s fine, you know. Bi is fine.” He gave Paul a warning look. “Go on. I want to hear the rest of the story.”
Harry?
“The same things? Monogamy you mean? Commitment?”
, but he did.”
“Do you need a potion, or maybe a mild healing charm?”
, he reminded himself.
“That would be great, Headmistress,” he said.
Draco watched her a moment. “Meaning?” he asked, though he already knew the answer.
Harry’s face reddened further. “I’ve… had them for a while, actually. I ordered them back in March.”
“I know,” Harry said, which made the man laugh.
“All right, you two, that’s enough lovey dovey for one evening,” Dean said. “More than I have the stomach for, at any rate.”
“True,” Draco agreed. “But my mother might drive me barmy, by the end. Or she’ll drive Harry barmy, which he’ll pass along to me.”
“No. Angry is good. Angry is…” He thought a moment. “Angry is better than a lot of other things.”
He kept the gift simple, not wanting to overthink it. He went to a bakery in Diagon Alley and picked out a selection of Harry’s favorites, asking them to arrange it nicely in a box with the treacle tart as the centerpiece. They did up elegantly with a large blue bow and Draco was satisfied with the result.
,” he corrected. “Not nice. Remember?”
Normally she would let this run its course, as it always did. She would come; that was inevitable. It was simply too good, and she could already feel it on its way. But there was an emptiness in her, a sharp need that could only be filled by Ron’s sizeable cock. And she wanted it – now.
“Sure. I’ll see you in there.”
“It’s all right. Let me have a look.”
She looked over her shoulder and gave him a look that was half embarrassed, half amused. “Yes, sir. I will.” Perhaps Draco was imagining it, but he almost thought she sounded a bit pleased.
“It has to settle,” she said, waving her wand and muttering the spell to extinguish the flame underneath. “We should be able to test it in about twenty minutes.
me. You’ve watched this whole process and you know everything I’ve been through. The panel, on the other hand, will be a bunch of strangers whose sole job is to determine the merits of my work based on the results alone. And if they don’t like them, then that’s it. I must start completely over, mustn’t I?”
“Well… It’s him. He’s quite fit, you know, actually. Sort of charming in a bumbling, self-conscious kind of way. And a great conversationalist. Very stimulating. Anyway, not sure what’s going to happen tonight but with any luck we’ll be blowing each other by the end of the week. All right, well, cheerio then, love. See you later.” He attempted a hasty kiss to her cheek, but she grabbed him to stop him.
“Love you too, little man,” Draco replied, chuckling.
“Do something, Kemp,” she heard Ron say from the sidelines. “Remember what you’ve learned.”
to see you thrive, and we hate to see you carry all those burdens on your own.”
He paused there, letting Harry absorb that.
, but way better than what I had been doing. And after that something clicked, and my shield got stronger and stronger. But I had to really be able to feel my magic first.”
” replied Ron. “I’ve never been before.”
It looked like the sort of sitting room Muggles might have, essentially.
“How is Mr. Malfoy’s hand?”
“That’s ok,” Harry said quickly. “I just wasn’t sure… I’m not really… well, you know I’m not experienced-“
She walked into her kitchen, seeing Blaise’s letter on the table where she had left it. She picked it up, looking at it without reading it. She already had it memorized by now anyway.
“Because he might use it. Yeah, maybe not in competition, but, if he’s ever attacked-“
“That’s not what I meant. I just… the way you said it…” Draco hesitated, wondering how to phrase it in a diplomatic way. “I mean, Voldemort hated you so much that he wanted you dead. He wanted to
One of them was Harry Potter.
“Dudley asked me to,” Harry said. “And I thought… Well, it seemed like the right thing.”
“Harry is in one of the healthiest and most enviable relationships I have ever seen,” Vesper went on. “He’d obviously doing something right.”
“It is a shame,” she said, “because I’ve always wanted to see Hogwarts. It’s arguably
“Of course,” Draco said. He picked up a slim parcel wrapped expertly in gold paper (undoubtedly by one of the elves; Narcissa Malfoy didn’t do
“I was going to tell you, once I’d gotten it all sorted. There are still some things I’m working through and I just wasn’t… I was going to tell you once I’d worked it out. I swear.”
She turned her head, smiling when she saw him. “Hey, Scorpius.”
How nice it was to have a floo. And an enthusiastic kiss goodbye. He could certainly get used to it.
“No, that’s not it,” Draco reassured him. “It’s just interesting, because I was quite literally just thinking, while I was sitting alone out here, about my ex-wife and the fact that we never fought when we were married and how she never really asked anything of me at all. It’s like I had the exact opposite problem you had. She went along with everything I said, and was basically completely…
“Come over here and show me,” she said.
Draco felt he could readily assume that Kyle was gay. Or at least very into men. He was getting better at spotting such things, and he really didn’t think the look Kyle was giving him now could be mistaken, though the brunet was clearly trying to hide it.
Draco lavished attention on the other nipple for a bit, getting a similar reaction and more encouragement, then started working his way down Kyle’s abdomen, feeling the hard breastbone under his lips before it opened at the ribs and dipped inwards. Kyle’s skin was soft and nearly hairless. There was only a small dusting on his chest and then a sparse trail from his belly button down to the edge of his jeans. Draco tongued his navel and followed the trail with his lips while his hands slid up to undo the buttons on his fly.
Harry complied immediately.
The man ordered, smiling, then turned back to Draco. “I’m Rick.”
“If I’d told you it was going to be the whole group, would you have thought about coming?”
They were quiet again, but only for a moment. They knew their guests’ patience was wearing thin.
Harry nodded. “And most of my friends have been supportive. The decision did sort of lead to me breaking up with Ginny, though.”
He supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised. She was an extroverted person, the kind who seemed to get on with just about everybody. It helped that she was dressed in stylish Muggle clothes that hugged her toned figure and showed quite a bit more skin than usual. She had also done something with makeup that made her skin look smooth and her eyes dark and smoldering.
Hannah nodded. “That must have been hard.”
“I’m only saying, I thought I was a given as well.”
“And what is the best woman’s job?” came another voice. Pansy stuck her head in a moment later, appearing right below Ron’s in the gap between the door and the frame.
to believe it, and it might very well break his heart all over again to learn it wasn’t true.
Draco exchanged a longer look with Harry, unsure how to answer that.
“So much self control,” Hermione said with a sweet little smile. She fanned herself suggestively. “That's really hot, you know."
“You can’t force him,” Paul said. “You’re right about that.” David nodded.
Teddy ran a small finger along the handle of his cup. “How do you know?”
“How can a man who’s been cooking since he was a child not have any intuition for Potions?” Draco countered.
When he arrived home by floo he was immediately hit with a wonderfully savory aroma, and his stomach grumbled. He made his way towards the kitchen, knowing what he would find there.
Harry eyed him, almost admonishing, then turned to Francesca to find her expression avid as well. “Bloody gossips,” he said, shaking his head.
“Am I keeping you from something important?” Vesper asked anxiously. When she’d requested this meeting with Draco to review the details of this serial murder case, she had assumed he would be honest about whether or not he could manage it.
Hermione hesitated, then replied, “No, I suppose I don’t. But… if you two… did, you know… other things, then… was he… I mean, did he…”
Draco closed his eyes. “I know.”
“That’s good to hear.”
“Not that dinner with you is a waste, that’s not what I-“
“When I asked him, he said that I should ask you. Which, in my opinion, is his way of saying he would like it, but he doesn’t want to force you into something you don’t want to do.”
Draco went still in the middle of straightening his collar, giving Harry a sharp look. “It will be our
It was immediately apparent they had come to the right place when they both spotted Dudley Dursley standing in a hallway next to a woman with long, straight, sandy blond hair. The man looked up when he saw them.
mean them the way I thought, that maybe now he’s changed his mind.”
He felt Harry shrug. "I don't know. I suppose I thought, you know, two is better than one?"
“Draco,” Hermione said in surprise as he came into the room. “Are you on Ron’s case?”
Pansy delicately brushed a lock of dark hair from her forehead and tilted her head demurely. “Well, if you’re going to insist on it, I certainly won’t stop you.”
Boys didn’t want to kiss their sisters, after all.
“That’s right, Teddy. I love you. Unconditionally. Do you know what that means? Unconditionally?”
“No one is simply one thing all the time, you know, Han,” said Draco. “Just selfish or just selfless. We’re all selfish sometimes. We couldn’t live our lives without a certain amount of selfishness.”
There were just a few more buttons, and some finagling to get the sleeves down his arms, and Harry was completely naked.
Draco nodded and pulled out slowly. Then he pushed back in, and they both moaned. Draco did it again, and then again, and then again, keeping it achingly slow, loving the pull in his cock as he moved in and out, the way the burn in his gut intensified degree by degree, the way Harry arched, and trembled, and whispered his name. His lips played along Harry’s neck and shoulder as he worked, whispering back to him words of love and admiration.
“Why don’t you go first, love?” she said. She was excited for him to open it, though it was only an envelope.
“I didn’t realize that. About Transfiguration Development. I mean, I know we share storage with them…”
When Draco knocked on Harry’s door the following evening, his insides were still squirming with nerves, but this was of a different sort. He wanted this night to be perfect. This starting over business was a good idea in theory, but Draco was realizing that it was a lot of pressure. He wanted to say and do the right things; he wanted Harry to feel cared about.
“You were
,” Angelina said, curling up to his side. “Cute. You’re cute. You have a good face.” She poked him on either cheek. “Symmetrical.”
That really did him in, and he could hold back a small sob. It was everything he had wanted without knowing it. Trust, pure and unrestrained. It was everything he wanted to give Draco in return, without knowing how to. “Fuck. This is so… I don’t even have words for what this means to me.” He paused, trying to get his breathing under control, so that he could say what he needed to say. “I
“No, I suppose not. But I’ve had other things on my mind. Like killing a madman who was trying to take over the world, for instance.”
didn’t like the idea that Clint felt sorry for him. That was the last thing he needed.
“All right,” said Harry. “Well, I’ll relay that to Draco. That, and the fact that Blaise should obviously make a move before you get snapped up by someone else, if he’s really and truly interested.”
year in the school, the day before. Draco had been surprised by the news, since in his eyes McNeal was far too young and small to start
“So when they see what it’s really like, they bail?”
Draco found himself fighting a smile of his own. “There are a lot of reasons.”
wouldn’t
Draco was moving into Grimmauld with him the very next day. He couldn’t be happier.
“Because there are things that happened before you were born, that were still happening when you were born, that made it…” Draco ran a hand through his hair. “It was a very difficult, very scary time to be a witch or wizard. A lot of bad things were happening. A lot of people got hurt. And it’s not something that we ever want you to go through. We’re trying to make a world where that will never happen again. We want our children to be able to live without those kinds of memories. But it’s hard sometimes, because so many of the people in your life went through all that and sometimes we need to talk about it with each other. But I would rather you not have to hear about it. I don’t want you to hear things that will upset you.”
Harry closed the distance between them in one swift motion, and Draco met him there, their mouths colliding with need and passion. They kissed intensely, bruisingly, before their lips opened and it became softer, the meeting of tongues and the sharing of breath. They snogged and snogged, gripping each other’s hair like they never wanted to let go.
“It looked like an intense discussion. I didn’t want to intrude, though I thought about it.”
But there were a handful of holdouts, purebloods mostly, who believed encouraging such socialization was dangerous and hoped to thwart Harry and Naomi’s endeavors. Though they were mostly talk, and not particularly respected in the current political climate, they were still a nuisance. And, being the boss, Naomi often cheerfully left Harry with the privilege of putting them in their place. How very nice of her.
“I think that’s probably the case,” his apprentice agreed.
Kyle hadn’t, but it wasn’t like he was bothered by that. He had a very promising opportunity in Max, one he was intending to follow through on as soon as he had time to draft the wizard a quick letter to make plans. Until then, though, he could regale Angelina with the small dramas of his family and the juicy details of Lindsey’s latest relationship.
“What is most versatile, do you think? I want him to be able to wear these whenever he wants.”
“I’m sure you’ll think of something,” Harry said, giving her an affectionate smile. He was sure his anger at Skeeter would return in good time, but at the moment it was trumped by all that had just transpired with Draco.
“Done,” said Harry.
So they went back in. This time, they agreed to both keep a watchful eye on Eloise. She seemed genuinely scared, although Vesper couldn’t help but note how quickly she reacted to the initial crash, almost like she had been expecting it. Still, Vesper couldn’t see anything amiss in her behavior as they made their way downstairs. She stuck close to her husband, looking around with wide, wary eyes. Her wand hand, Vesper noticed, was quite steady, though.
“Clever,” said Harry.
But it was. It simply was.
He smirked. “Can I stay and watch?”
“Perhaps.”
“But you will be,” said Angelina. “I know it.”
Draco grimaced. “You’re right. I was minimizing Weasley’s pain because… well, honestly, I have no real desire to walk in his shoes, or feel empathy for him. Part of me hoped he would just accept it and make things easier for Granger and Blaise, which, now that I say it aloud, is quite stupid.”
“Oooohhhh,
Harry turned to his Beaters, who were, frankly, the only members of the team pulling their weight at the moment. “Nice work guys. Just keep doing what you’re doing.”
Sure enough, as Draco kept bobbing his head and sucking hard, occasionally pausing to take that long cock in deeper, Kyle started to say his name more and more desperately, finally gripping Draco’s hair tightly and crying out. Draco took it all, careful not to spill a drop.
They both nodded.
She didn’t reply for a few seconds. “I love him,” she said.
“I appreciate that, but we do have to think about discretion. It would be easier for me to leave at night, when being out in the castle wouldn’t seem suspicious. If I leave in the morning, it might draw attention.”
“I’m proud of you.” Her voice was shaky as she clutched at him. “I love you.”
“That’s what most fantasies are. The best fantasies, anyway. You build them around something or someone unattainable, so that when the fantasy never comes true, you’re not disappointed. Anything too attainable, then you almost start to expect it. Or, even worse, you do get it, and it doesn’t nearly live up to what you had built up in your head.”
“Oh, good,” said Harry. “I’m glad.” He yawned, and Draco chuckled.
By the end of practice, Harry was exhausted. The only thing he wanted was to fall into bed and stop thinking for a few hours. But he couldn’t, because he still had a Charms essay to finish, which was due first thing in the morning.
The toddler was crouched at the very edge of the lake, digging for something with his hands. But upon hearing Harry’s voice he looked up with wide eyes.
“Mione…”
“Well, your mother’s a peach,” Tracey said to Greg, echoing Draco’s own thoughts. “Nothing like Marianna. Honestly, what was Astoria thinking, getting involved with Blaise? She should have seen this consequence coming.” Her eyes flicked to Draco again, her expression unreadable. He saw both Greg and Millicent nod in agreement and suppressed a sigh.
“At least for now,” Hermione said. “You know how easily distracted they are. Undoubtedly the next time you two go out in public, you’ll be swarmed by reporters who will then write about you and print pictures of you, and then people will remember and it will start all over again.”
“A gross oversight on her part, but no one’s perfect,” Draco grumbled under his breath.
It was clear, though, by the warm smile she gave Harry as she spotted them, that she had been anticipating their arrival. She squeezed the shoulder of the woman she was talking to, excusing herself, and made her way over to them.
Percy waved to both of them, and Harry turned immediately back to Kingsley, only to have the next words he was going to say preemptively cut off by the Minister.
“About what?”
Harry did not disappoint him either, his eyes roving over Draco as his lips parted, as if in awe. Their eyes met, and they exchanged small smiles of mutual appreciation before Harry said, his voice more hoarse now, “Come here.”
“Madam Pomfrey said-“
“Of course you did,” said Pansy as she did her mascara. “We all know, whatever confidence Harry exudes, there is always a small part of him who doubts that he’s loved.”
“She had to have seen him that second time.”
“You’ve already done so much for me, Draco,” Harry said, though his voice was a bit breathy as Draco’s lips skimmed the sensitive skin at the edge of his trousers. “Let me do something for you.”
“I’m so close, Harry,” Draco said. “Please, I just need… just a little more.”
“I’ve heard worse,” Draco said wryly. “It wasn’t the fact that she felt that way that was a concern to me. It was the way she chose to express her feelings.”
Draco nodded. He wished, for her sake, that she was choosing differently, but he also refused to push her. That wasn’t his job. His job was to give her the facts, then give her best care he possibly could once she had made her decision. “All right,” he said. “Then we need a very clear plan going forward. You should be prepared to see me quite a bit for the next seven or eight months. I want to see you once a month, to start, to check on the progress of the pregnancy and to check on your health as well. I’m going to adjust your potion regimen to manage this malnutrition issue, and you must – I cannot stress this enough – you
“Oh.” That made a bit more sense.
Giddy, lightheaded, warm all through her insides. She still had feelings for Blaise, that much was clear.
“You don’t floo in?”
“If you’re not sure you want the apprenticeship to be done for good, then don’t you owe it to yourself to go and find out either way?”
“Let me,” Kyle said, correctly guessing the question. An elegant, long-fingered hand reached toward Draco’s groin.
“Yeah. Thanks, Ron.”
“You will,” Harry said confidently. “As long as you’re polite to him, you’ll see what I see, eventually.”
Eamon was calling after her now and jinxes were flying, but Vesper’s brain was already whirring into high gear, putting the pieces together.
“It’s not easily quantifiable, and it doesn’t always make sense. You just have to feel it.”
Harry nodded and followed Kemp out of the room and down the stairs.
Harry chuckled at that and dipped closer to nibble on Draco’s earlobe. “My pleasure,” he said teasingly. “Yours too, hopefully.”
Draco reached into the back pocket of his trousers and pulled out a folded up copy of the
Draco gave him a wry smirk. “It… went.”
him, by law, to have certain wards in place if he was running that business in a mostly Muggle neighborhood.
Her voice was almost normal. She almost seemed completely unfazed. To the untrained observer, she would be. But Harry knew better. For all her talk of wanting to be transparent and honest in most situations, Vesper had a particular aversion to appearing vulnerable in any way. Harry and Draco both had a tendency to cover their more uncomfortable feelings at times, but they had nothing on her. Vesper was the queen of the brave face, using jokes and a smile as misdirection so you wouldn’t be able to see what was underneath.
“All right,” Harry said simply, not giving him a clue either way how he felt about that.
“Draco? What is it?”
“Yes, I knew,” Hermione replied, sitting up a little straighter, a clear indication she was prepared for an argument. “And while I did have some concerns, I also wanted to support Harry.”
“Yes,” he agreed. “All right.”
The three of them chatted away while Harry cooked and Pansy sketched. They talked a little bit about Harry’s third floor renovation project, but mostly about other things: how Theo and Gideon were getting on, Harry and Draco’s impending return to Hogwarts, and the fact that they finally had a dinner plan scheduled with Harry’s two best friends the following evening.
there, from now on – if and when it all fell apart.
“Harry,” he moaned. “Please. I want you inside me. Now.” A part of him couldn’t believe he was uttering these words, words he’d heard women say to him in some form or another, words he always welcomed hearing but would never let himself speak.
Draco pinched him in the side, making him yelp. “Git,” he said.
“I’d never thought I’d see you spend good money on a Potions book voluntarily,” she said, giving him a knowing raise of the eyebrows.
“I’m just not sure he’s my type.”
Honestly, he didn’t even know where to begin.
“It’s probably the third option,” Harry said.
He glanced over towards the shower stalls as he prepared to take off his cloak when he recognized the blond head of one Draco Malfoy, and he paused in his movements, momentarily frozen.
“That is our thinking as well, yes,” she said gently. “But it’s not something anyone could have foreseen, including you. You cannot blame yourself for this.”
Harry felt his temper coming to the surface at Kemp’s stubborn dismissal of the issue. “If you were just going to teach from the sidelines, sir, why bother pretending to let me take the lead at all?”
“Worth the wait?” he asked, giving Harry a soft kiss.
“Fucking hell,” Harry said, rubbing a hand through his hair enough that they looked like the unruly locks of yesteryear. “
The moment his bloody finger touched the ring there was a spark, and then thin coils of magic began to twine themselves around the band. Narcissa’s fingers held it steady; apparently the magic didn’t affect her at all, only the ring, which emitted one final white glow before settling.
As she went through the routine of drying her hair, picking out her outfit, and putting on a touch of makeup, visions of her relationship with Blaise continued to course through her, blending together but still punctuated with brief little snapshots in which she remembered just about every detail: seeking out Blaise’s face in the audience after her first major victory in the British National Dueling Competition, taking him to the movies for the first time, cooking with him in his kitchen while they listened to Frank Sinatra and drank marsala wine right out of the bottle, salsa dancing at a Muggle club until sweat dripped down their backs and their feet ached, and the first time they slept together. That night also happened to be the first time she’d truly made him laugh. Not just a soft chuckle or a single, dry bark, but a real laugh, rolling and delighted that came all the way from his gut. She’d never heard a more enchanting sound in her life, and only half an hour later had invited him into her bed.
“Yeah?” Draco asked, unfolding the letter and looking over it again.
Pansy watched him a moment, seeming almost bewildered. “Has it ever occurred to you that I might want to
“Well, consider me a complete novice. Assume I know nothing.”
Hermione tried to take this in, but there was a strange buzzing in her ears that she figured could only be shock. She blinked at Bulstrode, forcing herself to find her voice. “And…” She gripped the armrests of her chair, hard, so hard it hurt, and the pain grounded her a little. “And my father?”
“Potter,” Draco replied. “What brings you here? Come to drag me along for more drinks so you can talk my ear off about the Harpies again? Still think you can sway my loyalties?”
“And you have a Gryffindor side, apparently,” Harry teased. “Showing up at my door my a box of my favorite sweets to declare your love for me? I don’t think it gets much more Gryffindor than that.”
It took quite a bit of effort to find all of his clothes. They’d both undressed in a passionate flurry the night before, and the various garments were scattered all over the floor, his tangled up with Harry’s. He tiptoed naked about the room, at least until he found his underwear, which Harry had managed to fling to the other side of the room and which had hid themselves partially under the large oak dresser. He scrambled to put those on, then set about detangling his button-down shirt from his jumper. It was ridiculously wrinkled but he put it on anyway, having no other choice. At least with the jumper pulled on over it again it didn’t so obviously look like he was wearing yesterday’s clothes.
Clint removed his coat as well, showing off his broad shoulders in the dark, tight button down he wore. They settled in, side by side as Kyle had hoped, and Kyle decided to ask Clint about work, what with it being the topic the man was most comfortable with.
“Hey, it’s no big deal. At least you got two out of three.” He was smiling at her, and she couldn’t help smiling back. “I’m Declan, by the way. Declan Ross.” He held out a hand.
Draco laughed sardonically. “I don’t know. It didn’t matter. Seeing her again only confirmed just how thoroughly I had moved on. I was able to say what I wanted to say, and then I forgave her. There were no hard feelings when we parted.”
“Healer Goddard,” she said. “Good morning.”
Draco hesitated. He knew what he wanted, but he wasn’t sure he was capable of asking for it aloud. Harry waited, his breath a light, warm pulse on his covered bollocks.
When dinner was done the family settled around the table, and conversation jumped from one topic to another, driven very frequently by Lily. Sometimes it was as though the youngest Potter-Malfoy had bottled up everything she’d wanted to say for a whole month, and now that she had her older siblings back she was trying to get it out all at once. Harry and Draco did manage to get around to asking Marissa, when Lily paused to take a breath, what she wanted to do for her birthday that was coming up in a couple of weeks. She was going to be fourteen, something Scorpius found very hard to believe. True to form, Marissa said she didn’t want much fuss, maybe just for Dad-Harry to bake a cake.
"It also guarantees you to a small consultant's stipend, for you trouble," she added with a hopeful smile.
“Do you mean to tell me that you and Longbottom have been together for four years now and you’ve never had a proper fight?” Pansy asked, aghast.
Harry squeezed Draco’s knee in thanks. He knew he would probably never take Draco up on the offer. But sometimes simply knowing the offer was there was enough.
“Swirl around the head with your tongue,” he practically begged, “then take me deeper, as deep as you can.”
He watched the two of them all the way up to the castle, hoping to see more signs of something unfolding between them, but not getting much more than some mild flirtation. They parted ways in the entrance hall with no more than a wave and a “See you tomorrow,” and Ginny headed in the direction of the Gryffindor dormitories while Dean headed towards the 8
He was unconscious, probably dosed with a sleeping draught. His left arm was in a sling, but the rest of him looked fine. Other than the arm, and that he was a little pale, he looked healthy and intact.
“Divide and conquer, I guess?” Kyle suggested. “I’ll get the champagne I need, and you look for that wine your friend makes.”
“I’m just glad it’s over,” he said, a bit louder. He turned to his friends, keeping an arm wrapped around Draco’s waist.
One of his hands came to rest on her waist as she tilted upwards, nuzzling into his neck, up under his jaw. The other had wound its way into her hair, pulling a little in a silent plea for more.
Then again, Draco rather liked it at Hogwarts, and didn’t want Potter fucking things up for him either.
Blaise’s smile was small but smug. “She’s your best friend. Why don’t you ask her yourself?”
Who else could it be? It was unlikely that he would be approached by another staff member about an emergency in the middle of the night. He wasn’t a head of house or a member of the Healing staff.
“Draco…”
And I’ve never felt like that, honestly. Like someone wanted to see all of me rather than just the pieces that they liked, the pieces that were pretty.”
And so they danced.
“Like I said, I had to ask. I’m glad that doesn’t seem to be the case.”
“I do,” Draco said cheerfully, ignoring the way his father scowled behind his wine. “My NEWT students are fantastic, and I even have a 4th year who I’ve sort of taken under my wing. She’s really gifted; has the best intuition for Potions I’ve ever seen for someone her age.”
“What are you saying?”
“I was looking forward to it. I honestly was.”
“When you return, I’ll show you what dueling with finesse looks like,” Kemp said. “For now, though, I have a floo call to make, so I will have to end this here.”
“Yes,” said Goddard. “We are both in agreement that it would be.”
Harry snorted. “Undoubtedly within the next five years there will be plenty of Weasley grandchildren for him to play with.” The way things were going, what with Percy and Audrey, George and Angelina, and Ron and Hermione all appearing well-settled, he was sure he would be receiving plenty of wedding invitations and birth announcements in the upcoming years.
Vesper shook her head. “No, he was reasonable. If the conversation with you didn’t go well, I might have gotten it worse, but as it is it’s just some extra chores.”
He was finished. The school year was over.
“You want to remake my wardrobe.”
, and even laughed, and talked about himself, and listened to Potter talk about himself… and remained genuinely interested throughout the whole endeavor.
Draco swallowed. “Go on,” he said again. “Do it all, then. Anything you want.”
She turned, walked to the door with purpose, and opened it.
“What? Do you think I’m going to do something to her?”
He could hear Draco’s answering grin rather than see it. “And I like them darker, as you know. The rugged, adventurous types.”
When Hermione arrived at home Harry and Teddy were still there, which hardly surprised her. She walked into the kitchen to find the five-year-old at the table with his coloring book while Harry and Ron were chatting and cooking together simultaneously.
“I trust you, Harry. And I wanted you to know just how much. I know you’ll keep it safe.”
“You look tired.”
“And in this metaphor, Blaise is also an anchor?” Harry asked. “Meaning he weighs you down, to some extent?”
“It was all right, actually. I was all right. It was good for me. We talked. She told me that the reason she was unfaithful to me was because she was already in love with Blaise when we got married, but her father wouldn’t let her marry Blaise. He essentially forced her to marry me, the way she tells it. But then she said she fell in love with me anyway. She tried to tell me she
“Well, Picard’s a shameless gossip,” she said, a little sharply. Blaise merely raised an eyebrow. “It wasn’t even just me and Declan anyway. There were others from our class there too. I mean, it was originally just going to be us and the others tagged along… not that it matters.” She was babbling now, because she was uncomfortable, and he was still watching her with that blank stare she wished she could smack right off him.
Still, her mind was definitely spending a bit
Harry leaned in closer. “Not for me.”
“Had,” said David, his voice suddenly flat.
Draco felt himself go still, briefly, managing his reaction. It was the second time in as many days that Harry had talked about the possibility of children, and it made Draco’s heart stutter. Had they been alone, he might have turned to Harry and asked him exactly how serious he was, exactly how sure. But it was not a conversation to have in a social setting. And he was also afraid to latch onto something said so casually, and always in response to someone else’s prompting. He was still afraid to read too much into it, even now.
She had been hoping to finish her report before this department meeting with Robards. She had reason to believe that it was related to the Green Adders, the largest open case the Corps had at the moment. She wanted to be fully focused, rather than have part of her mind still lingering on outstanding paperwork.
It seemed to Draco he could
“Something scary,” Draco said, which didn’t surprise Harry in the slightest. “With lots of action.”
“And no one else.”
She looked at him, surprised. “I’ve never thought about it like that before.”
“Like, twice as many.”
Aria didn’t say anything, only nodded, seeming lost in thought.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Are you doing that on purpose to wind me up, or can you just not help yourself?”
“Your theory matches very closely the ones the Aurors on the case had, and they followed many of these lines of inquiry,” he replied, indicating the parchment. “But no, it turned out that she did not have a lover. It was her brother who helped her, along with two old friends of theirs from childhood, who were… not exactly law-abiding citizens, we could say. Either way, by digging deeper into Eloise Parrish’s personal life, they discovered the one she kept hidden, found where she as secretly meeting her brother to plan the abduction, and used that to track down her and the brother. I imagine if you were on the case, you would have gotten similar results.”
And if he could choose to see his breakup with Evan that way, then he could also choose to see his breakup with Draco in a different way, in a way that helped him.
“Yes, quite the tyrant am I.”
“Now we’ll just see how people react,” Draco said, taking the paper from Harry.
The minutes went by painfully slowly, but Harry persevered. He could hear a vague chatter and laughter emitting from the common room below him, but he remained dutifully watching the lake, despite the tempting activity. After a while it died down, and Harry began hearing people returning to rooms and the sounds of farewells and doors opening and closing on the landing. Harry appreciated the new silence which eventually settled in the dorm, and found himself concentrating a bit more on the scene below him. Thankfully, the scenery wasn't completely still for the entire duration of his watch. He’d seen a lone deer emerge from the forest momentarily, grazing on the frosty grass, before slipping back into the shadows of the trees. A little later on he saw a creature, presumably a mer - person, break the surface of the lake, a small dark head poking just above the water, then re-submerge moments later. Harry also witnessed a couple of rabbits hopping around Hagrid's pumpkin patch, scavenging for food in the quiet darkness.
Harry pulled on Malfoy’s wrist a little and turned it towards the lamplight, while his other hand gently tapped out a few drops of dittany from the vial. He watched as the potion instantly got to work, the magic liquid quickly finding the wound and absorbing itself into Draco's skin. He heard Malfoy hiss quietly under his breath, and his arm tense slightly under Harry's grip. After a couple of seconds the orange glow faded, leaving the wound as just a red scorch on Draco's hand. Harry tilted his head, admiring his handiwork, and raised the vial to the cork between his teeth, depositing the cork in the hole and pushing it in with his thumb.
“You watched me go in?” Malfoy said in a small voice.
“This room works just fine.” Harry breathed, popping several buttons open. “You just didn't know that what you actually wanted from me wasn't a duel.”
Harry frowned as he watched the boy go deeper into the lake until it reached his armpits, with only his wand hand held above the rippling surface. He stopped, and looked around him, his head turned from side to side, up and down the shore. As he rotated himself around to look behind him, Harry shrunk further into the shadows of the boulder, heart pounding. He was sure Draco had seen him for a second there. He grimaced, and looked slowly back to the lake, but Draco once again had his back to him. He gripped his wand, and Harry watched as he lowered it until the tip just grazed the water. A few moments of stillness, and then-
"What's it to you, Potter?" She cocked a brow.
When he had turned the corner behind a shelf he had fixed his eyes on a strange sight.
He'd hope to see Draco in his dreams again.
"I-I uh-h-" Harry fidgeted with the hem of his robes.
Harry shook his head, trying to focus on McGonagall's quick tour until they'd reach the old dorms which were still perfectly intact as before.
Harry shook his head, a little buzzed but enough to make sense of everything.
“Strange,” He turned swiftly around in a serious manner.
Harry lowly groaned and moved his heavy arms.
They both panted heavily and collapsed onto one another.
smut warning
if they'd like to go to Hogsmeade with us later," Pansy smirked, now taking all of Draco's books in her hands.
"Malfoy," Harry tapped his shoulder. Draco choked a sob and latched onto his arm, pulling Harry closer to him.
You'd think he was researching something important or studying up on something to help with his cases, but that would not be the case.
"Shh, Draco dear, it's alright," She whispered to the blonde who seemed to calm his emotions, letting go.
Soft snickers were shared between the two who shared quick kisses that got deeper and longer with every one they exchanged.
Draco's hot tongue, swiveling around Harry's fingers felt heavenly. Such a pretty sight it was to Harry, he'd almost finger fuck him orally if his cock wasn't so hard now.
"That was... brilliant Potter," Draco huffed out after a while of catching his breath.
He examined the beautiful pale torso that belonged to Malfoy and the pink, soft and sensitive nipples that protruded, smiling back at Harry.
I was sposed to end this 2 chapters ago but I suppose we can call these "extra" if this ends up a bit dry,, oops
The minutes passed by painfully slow and the scratching of the quill to parchment rung in his ears. But alas, when he'd glance at his pocket watch he had realized that he could resume himself in the novel.
Harry felt much better knowing he wouldn't just be working today and could go see Hagrid, it had been a while since they'd last seen each other anyway and Harry needed to get out of this stuffy room.
"Harry...?" Draco murmured in his sleep, barely awake enough to open his eyes.
"Potter, may I ask you why you've been following me?"
Draco's eyebrows furrowed as he shifted in his sleep.
Giving Draco one last look, Draco nodded before clenching his eyes tightly, waiting for Harry to split him open.
. Harry always admired the handwriting. Name always punctuated with a curly and very distinct heart shape that Harry deeply found charming.
"He knew it was me . . he knew it was me and he said nothing . . ." Harry sat down on his bed and cupped his face.
Harry cleared his throat.
Harry followed with a soft chuckle and wrapped an arm around Draco's body, snuggling close to smell the cologne Draco had still faintly on. "Talk later Draco, I need to enjoy this while I can," Draco huffed in response and adjusted himself more comfortably.
"No no no no —
came with me." Harry smiled and layed down now on the comfy bed, taking in all of the Slytherin's scent which was now bleeded into the sheets.
Harry tried to think back to earlier when he'd seen Malfoy.
"Did she mention what house will go out tomorrow?" Ron fumbled out of his seat while Harry shrugged.
"Excuse me," Draco had finally excused himself to the restroom, in need of some air.
"I'm done for mate..." Ron came over and sat beside Harry, shooting Draco a nasty look on his way.
The bookshop was sparse with its people, as usual, no one visibly ordering from the newest arrivals to Harry's luck and surprise.
With only a handful of them, a few from each of the original houses, they'd have to work together to not only clean but not be constantly at each others throats.
Harry cocked his eyebrow and pulled back to give Draco space to breathe.
"He looks sick,"
Draco frowned.
"What the-?" He got up and a sudden mirror had appeared in front of him thanks to the room.
Harry rolled his eyes, "Honestly Ron, when are you going to stop teasing me about this?" He set his cup of tea down, taking in the blued sky out the window.
"Do you like it? It's my sort of happy place I like to call it," Malfoy almost giggled as he flung himself onto the large sofa, letting a moan of relief escape his lips.
"Perhaps he is lonely," she twirled a piece of her hair, "Lonely people tend to act quite odd if you haven't noticed."
The first song had ended but Malfoy had leaned back into Harry's ear to whisper softly, "Keep dancing, the next one is even better." Draco hadn't been lying when the music had started again, this time with a more upbeat song that made them both smile to each other for no reason other than the feeling it gave them.

Harry groaned deeply into Draco's sensitive ear, hoping to find that bundle of nerves to hit roughly into again.
"I tried to call out for Malfoy but soon I felt my body start to burn and... There were these younger years who thought it'd be funny to pick on a mudblood."
Harry quickly got up and left the room in a hurry. Turning around next to the door he picked up a quill and wrote off his name next to Draco's on the piece of parchment.
His eyes were adjusting to the dark however and realized Malfoy had been laying on top of him.
"Dear god, Harry you are an eager one." Draco continued to mumble non-sense while Harry carried the smaller over to the bed the room had presented to them.
"Yes, Draco I came to room with you."
A friendship.
"I hope the trip wasn't rough, its really been a pain in the arse trying to reopen the floo network to here," He opened a hand to take Harry's coat.
He approached the old muggle man who offered Harry a warm smile.
“Pretty sure that was more than just 5 minutes,” Hermione’s attention was paused when she caught sight of the staircase. "That's odd," Hermione approached where their once common room was. "Did we take a wrong turn?" Ron mumbled, just as confused as Hermione.
His lips drooled of pleasure and bliss. Images of Harry pooled around in his mind. He couldn't help but let a soft moan escape him when he envisioned Harry's hand instead of his. Pumping his dick with his beastly hands, whispering sweet nothings into his ear and driving him mad.
Draco let out a choked sob as he gripped onto his mother who only ran a soothing hand down his back to calm him.
"Have too, get dressed we're going to visit Hagrid with Hermoine in a bit," Harry's eyes lit up at the mention of Hagrid.
