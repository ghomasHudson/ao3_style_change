Malfoy was glaring at the macaroons.
Who talks like that?”
the Malfoy’s and he had no earthly reason to keep coming back. Except, he could smell the scent of the flowers from the Malfoy’s garden even through the wall, the sweet scents mingling with something heavier, muskier, and he was at least not lying on his back, replaying an argument he could not change or months spent living in a tent, afraid of his life. He wasn’t lying in bed and remembering how it had felt to die.
Harry squeezed his hand. “Do you think you’re losing your life?” he repeated, gentle.
“How?” Draco threw open the doors of the shed. “That doesn’t even make sense.”
“He should not make that choice for me.” Narcissa’s jaw was set. “I’m his mother and it’s up to me to protect him.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Then you can shower. Except I think you’re going to angrily try to kick the shower first and I’m just here to protect my possessions.”
“It’s not smart to ask me.” Malfoy started to play a half-tune. Harry sat completely still, shoulders tense, biting on his bottom lip. He waited a moment and then he stood up abruptly. Malfoy immediately stopped playing, turning to him and gaping. He’d pushed the piano stool back.
“Well, why don’t you tell me what the other stuff is?” Harry hated that Malfoy sounded calm and reasonable, things he frankly didn’t associate with him. He also hated that he felt so out of sorts that this seemed like a normal thing to be asked, to share his vague thoughts on his future with someone who had once broken his nose on a train just for the fun of it.
Blighter nodded and then said, “The family room tonight.” He disappeared immediately with a loud crack.
Harry’s mouth felt dry. “Okay.”
“Because you’re having some kind of crisis, clearly.” Malfoy said it as plainly as he would have told Harry the time. Harry hated that. He hated that Malfoy could spit out words that held such heft and it didn’t seem to shake him or take a piece of him at all. He hated that Malfoy seemed to have somehow resigned himself to his own seismic shift and therefore gave little consideration to Harry’s. He hated that he even thought like that, like a part of him wanted Malfoy to be more concerned about
here forever. Even when I’m not going to be stuck here, this is all there is, Potter. A bunch of Death Eaters, imprisoned.”
When he found himself crashing into bed more than a week after he’d sneaked out of Malfoy’s, Harry thought:
Ron was just declaring his third “Well, I never!” when the court hushed and Malfoy was led in. He still looked too pale, too thin, too tall. He looked nervous too, biting hard on his lip as he was led to the defendant’s box and the guard cast the spell to keep him there. Harry watched Malfoy’s eyes travel everywhere, almost seeming to swivel in opposite directions at once. He looked restless, like he was dying to fidget and couldn’t. Harry felt anxious just looking at him.
Even though he didn’t walk too fast, he still arrived for his interview too early. He loitered outside and considered walking to one of the muggle coffee shops and buying a coffee. Then he thought about how rude it would seem when he appeared clutching one and decided against it. He walked up and down the street seven times and then took a deep breath and went in.
Harry hummed. “Yeah, we were. It was pretty great, to be honest. We went to a museum and an art gallery too, although I don’t know how much I learnt.”
He did not like Narcissa Malfoy. It wasn’t as if they were friends. Sometimes, Harry still looked at her and felt cold and alone, remembering the shock of air when he woke up from King’s Cross. He usually left after, feeling shaky and walked around the estate before he let himself back into Hermione’s house. Sometimes, he barely talked to Narcissa, sitting in near silence as they drank tea, exchanged mild pleasantries and, on one occasion, let Narcissa read aloud from the book she had been reading. It had been about the DMLE, an account from an infamous Auror who worked in the department from the 1870s to the early 1930s, pioneering structural change.
“I hate you so much.”
Laughter burst out of Malfoy; it did not look particularly glad. In fact, it looked like it hurt, like the sound was wrenched out of Malfoy’s gut, leaving him breathless and wounded. Harry felt his heart surge and he bit down on his lip. He took another step forward.
Harry wanted to hug them and he could, so he did.
Harry shrugged. “I guess I have great staying power.”
Harry thought about staring at the sky still, a spike of fear lancing through him. He couldn’t though. That was cowardly. He squeezed Draco’s fingers tighter and turned his head to look into Draco’s face. He looked worried, his eyes suddenly tight and distant. His face was still red from the flying and there was sweat gathering in the dip of his throat. Harry looked at it for a moment and then back at Draco’s face. He nodded.
Malfoy’s face fell, twisting into something as hard as stone. He looked away from Harry, scowling into the back of his armchair. “Of course I’m going to see him again; that’s not the issue. The issue is I’m always just going to be
“You can call me Harry.”
Other times, George seemed to be pretending to be fine. He was making an effort to say Fred’s name as often as possible, face twisting with anger if anyone dared to tell him not to. Harry thought this was good — he’d tried to discuss it with Hermione once, but she’d looked helplessly around and it hadn’t been that fruitful. No one quite knew what to do. Ginny had told him that, over and over, whispered into his ear, scrawled into a letter when they hadn’t seen each other in over a week, said to him matter-of-factly whenever they met for a drink or a sandwich or to press themselves together, Harry holding her while she cried.
Malfoy frowned at him. “You don’t know who Maleficent Mongoose is?”
“They call it hump day, I heard,” Ginny said grandly. “It’s just to help us get over that.”
The door shut with a bang.
Harry did not particularly like to be called kind. He didn’t know why, just that it left him feeling almost like his insides had become momentarily mush and that made him feel awkward and embarrassed. Feeling his own face heat, he shrugged again and coughed in embarrassment. It made him lean to grab the backpack as he unzipped it. “I have things for you.”
Harry shifted in his seat, suddenly uncomfortable. He was keenly aware of how much Narcissa loved her son and, as he stared into the surface of his tea, he realised ‘I decided to do it to wind your son up’ wasn’t going to go over too well with her. Glancing up, he cleared his throat. “I thought it would be nice.”
Malfoy blinked at him. “Well done. Of course it is. Why else would the door be charmed only to appear for me?”
“Are you quite finished with whatever it is you’re doing?”
Harry swallowed. “Yeah,” he said, looking down the corridor. There were plenty of people still milling about but in this setting, on this day, they seemed to have decided to leave them alone. “I think it’s to try and get them away in one fell swoop.”
It sounded ridiculous, even in his own head. Harry did not understand it. He stared at the blades of grass, squinting at them to make every one stand out in his vision, and then lifted his head. “I think the fact she said you aren’t getting on is what makes her sad.”
“I mustn’t admit anything,” Harry interrupted. A ripple started to go through the crowd. “I think you’re trying to get me to say that I would only be here if, somehow, someone had forced me into it and that’s not the case. I didn’t like Malf – Draco Malfoy. That doesn’t mean that I think that he was running happily through fields of murder. I think he had a terrible choice and he chose wrongly, but I don’t know that there were a lot of options left. I wouldn’t call him brave, but he refused to identify me when we were captured and standing in front of Voldemort, which does require a great deal of bravery. There have been better men that have crumbled in similar situations and it could have backfired on him pretty badly, to be honest. I do not think that he’s a saint and I’m not blinkered or under any kind of spell. I’m telling you what happened. You can choose to interpret that how you want, I suppose, but it’s my understanding of events which is what you’ve asked for.”
Catching up to Draco, Harry fell into step beside him and said, “Please don’t tell me more about how you’re gonna wank over me when you’re like a hundred. It’s making me a bit ill, you creepy old perv.”
Ron shook his head. “Shut up, Harmond. You’re ruining this for me.”
.” Harry had just decided to pay him no mind when he heard Malfoy’s voice, sweeping down from the top of the stairs.
“Well. November is pretty early,” Harry said kindly. Ron blew out a breath and stared morosely at the display again. It twinkled back at them, seemingly even more festive in the face of Ron’s consternation. Harry had met Ron in front of the Ministry after work and they’d wandered into Diagon, in search of Ron’s elusive first Christmas present.  A Christmas shop had popped up, taking over a disused shop, a huge sign out the front declaring
“I’m just not feeling that great. It’s nothing. Probably getting a cold, it’s starting to cool down outside.” He sat up and then stood. Hermione still looked worried. He knew she would;  it wasn’t in her nature to let things go. So, Harry tried on a reassuring grin which clearly wasn’t that reassuring if the look Hermione gave him was anything to go by. “I’m fine, Hermione, honestly.”
Harry reeled back, grabbing his hand and scooting across the floor. His knees hurt from the wooden floor suddenly and he couldn’t stay on them anymore. He pushed himself to his feet, brow furrowed, and stared down at Ginny. His lungs were burning. When he spoke, it hurt. “I have a life! I’m not visiting the Malfoy’s every other day — it’s just a laugh, it’s just to wind him up, it’s nothing.”
in the morning. Harry bloody hated Draco.
“It isn’t different at all.” Harry opened the shower door. “Look, you really should leave now unless you’re planning on watching and then just stay but you know. You made it clear you weren’t.”
His first hint was, admittedly, huge. Harry stood at the front gates for nearly fifteen minutes before they opened and after his trudge up the lane, his heart thudding with a sadness Harry was ashamed of for not seeing Malfoy there, he was met by Blighter at the front door.
“Come on, Potter,” he said, lazily. “I’ve not got all day for you.”
Draco flushed. “I’m sleeping.”
“I can tell that you’re making fun of me and I don’t mind. I’m trying to say that I messed up and it’s because I don’t like people knowing me. It’s weird to me that you do.”
and he didn’t think they needed to kiss to do that. It was just an added bonus.
Malfoy laughed and Harry realised that he didn’t believe him. While the other boy had sounded furious and angry moments before, he sounded sad now, weary, like the anger had drained his energy. He looked smaller too, which was ridiculous because he was taller than Harry. Shoving his hands into his pockets, Harry rocked back and forth for a moment and then came to a decision. A few quick steps and he was beside Malfoy, waiting for a moment to see how he reacted before he dropped down beside him. Malfoy sat, tense and unmoving. He did not shift his gaze to look at Harry. Harry decided he was fine with that.
“I don’t need thanks.” Harry wondered what he usually did with his body when he sat down. Did he cross his legs? Did he cross his arms?  Did he slouch? He couldn’t remember and, instead, he decided to do nothing but keep very, very still. “I wasn’t doing it for that.”
Malfoy shrugged, the picture of nonchalance. “It wasn’t binding.”
Harry thought about Draco leaning over cauldrons and worrying himself sick and how he paced sometimes, relentlessly. He pictured the nightmares he’d been told about and the way that Draco shook occasionally, trembling throughout the day. Harry pictured the boy he had known and the almost-man that he knew now. He remembered Draco’s soft voice telling him secrets and asking him not to repeat them.
Reassuring Hermione took some time, but Harry did it and then left them, slipping upstairs to get dressed and stare at himself in the mirror. His concentration on his own image was absolute: Harry looked at who he was now and tried to remember who he had been.
Harry laughed again, though this time it was softer and more into himself. He curled his shoulders over the cup of tea in front of him and stared down at it. “That’s the single most boring thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“Of course, I’ll need to get started right away. I have rather put it off, at this point, and I would like some of the flowers to have bloomed before summer. Thankfully, we have some bulbs in the greenhouses that I can just replant but it will not be nearly enough.” Narcissa ran a hand over her hair, smoothing it down.
“Okay, you’re right, I was upset and I’m admitting it. It was very nice of you and I won’t do something like that again.”
He thought about it the next morning and the next day and the day after. He went with Ron into the Ministry and peeled off to try and talk to some of the people in the Department for Regulation and Control, just in case.
“Of course it’s not,” Malfoy said. “You’ve saved the whole world again, everything else must pale in comparison.”
Harry grinned and headbutted him gently. “Go talk to your mum, you idiot.”
because we’re under house arrest. My mother can go in a few months at least, which is great for her, but I can’t go until
“Can I tell you about my week?” Harry asked. “I’m gainfully employed now. I’m a member of the working force. A proper adult.”
“Whatever it is!” Harry repeated, voice creeping louder. “If you’re just happy to be a
“You’re such a —”
Harry shrugged, then nodded, then trailed after Malfoy. They didn’t speak as they walked up the lane although Malfoy looked like he wanted to a couple of times, opening his mouth and then letting his words turn into a heavy breath that he expelled. It was cold enough that the unspoken words formed a cloud in front of them; Harry relished walking through it.
“You know, they say curiosity killed the cat. And they also say Narcissa Malfoy is an annoying, uptight arse who did one good thing in her life and they would be right!” Ginny sat her glass down on the table, precisely, gently. She looked fierce, even though she was avoiding eye contact with Harry, and he could see her mostly in profile. Her jaw was set.
Finally, he cleared his throat. “Are you going to say something or are you really into staring now?”
“Narcissa Malfoy.” Harry heard the disgusted noise that Ginny made, although he barely registered it outside of noise as he looked down at the paper. It wasn’t a long letter — in fact, he wasn’t sure it could even be called a letter.
Several days passed and Harry mostly ignored the papers. There was a steady stream of visitors, no matter where he was: Ron was a constant at Hermione’s house, the three of them sitting in the kitchen until Ron and Hermione would disappear upstairs and Harry would camp out in front of the TV, flicking through channels or trying to lose himself in some of the books around the house. The Weasley’s home was always bustling, too, but Harry found it odd being there and feeling their grief. It sat heavy on each member of the family and Fred’s hand on the clock had moved to
He had to cover his mouth to stop his braying laughter when Malfoy sent back a letter which,  upon opening, turned into a large, origami middle finger and then exploded into glitter.
Narcissa frowned and then said, “We’ll see.” She didn’t really sound like she believed him. In fact, her shoulders looked straight and determined and she was clearly thinking deeply about something. Harry had never had a mother, so he wasn’t sure what she was thinking but he had the distinct feeling that there was no way on earth that Narcissa was ever going to think she didn’t need to protect Draco. That wasn’t something she was prepared to accept.
“One of us has to. You rarely talk about anything of interest.”
Obediently, Harry reached out and took a macaroon. Narcissa watched him eat it and neither of them spoke. It was intensely uncomfortable.
“No, of course not. I was a Slytherin.” Malfoy straightened himself, tugging at the collar of his shirt and then, clearly deciding not to bother pretending he hadn’t been eavesdropping said, “I heard your girlfriend dumped you.”
“She loves you,” Harry said again.
Malfoy’s gaze swept over him and then down to the dog, dispassionately. “I don’t need a pet.”
“I’m tired,” he said.
“No problem.” Harry pressed the pads of his fingers more firmly against Draco’s back. “You need to take care of yourself, you idiot.”
“It didn’t backfire. I appreciated it.” Harry traced Malfoy’s profile with his eyes. He reminded himself of how he’d felt after he’d ran out on Malfoy and thrown himself into everyday minutiae. He thought about how his stomach had twisted every time he thought about Malfoy waking up alone, about Narcissa telling him how Harry had left, the shame that had crept in every time Harry dwelled too long on it. Maybe he didn’t know what they were doing, but he knew he should be better than that. “I’m not very good at talking to people about things. I’m not very good at talking to
“I would thank you, young sir, to not suppose what I can and cannot bear!” the portrait shouted.
Harry blinked again and then frowned deeply, his nose wrinkling. “I don’t think that’s why.”
“That’s not fair. A couple weeks ago it hadn’t even been Hallowe’en yet, so my grumbling was entirely justified.”
Draco was the one who broke it, one moment a solid presence in front of Harry, and the next pushing him gently away. His mouth was red and ruined. His hair looked even worse than it had before. His eyes were shining bright.
At that moment, Ron walked into the kitchen, yawning and stretching, scratching his stomach. “The old project was killing You Know Who, mate.”
Blighter said “I would not call it that exactly, Mr Potter” and then immediately disappeared. Harry frowned at the air where the house elf had been but, frankly, he refused to check the box somewhere where Malfoy could feasibly see him. Throwing his shoulders back, he strolled down the lane and took his time with the walk, apparating once he got past the gates.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I wouldn’t take your advice.”
August had nearly melted away by the time Harry found himself alone with Ginny again. The Weasley household had been a constant grounding for the whole family for all their lives; with Fred’s death, it became more so. Bill and Fleur had been there practically every day, sometimes staying over whenever they seemed to deem it necessary. Charlie had apparently taken a leave of absence from work, although nearly every time Harry spoke to him he seemed jumpy, restless, always staring out of windows with a wistful expression on his face. Harry didn’t know how long he was going to stay.
“Harry, while that’s a very admirable sentiment, I think we can both agree that I hardly did much to help.” Narcissa looked slightly pinched, her mouth slanting upwards, her eyes bright. Harry wondered how genuine it was and then pushed the thought away.
When he kept mostly quiet throughout, Harry decided not to press it. He finished one cup of tea and took another, mostly to be polite. Harry ate one of the gratitude cupcakes and thought Ron would like them enough that he asked if he could take one home. Although Malfoy stared at him, he still didn’t say much of anything, just watching as Narcissa nodded and Blighter appeared to put them in a box for him.
He didn’t leave that night until very late, curling up in his bed at home with a smile on his face.
It wasn’t just the open house of possible career ideas for Harry. For the next fortnight, Ron kept arranging things for Harry to do, with or without him. He visited some training grounds and different shops — apothecaries were added to the list but when the two of them stood out the front Ron turned to him and said, “Look, I think I might have gone a bit mad here, wanna grab a pint instead?” After they grabbed a pint, Harry led them to a park, a couple of tins purchased from the nearest off licence swinging from a bag. Time had somehow lurched past them and it was mid-October now: Harry loved the splendor it brought to the park. The trees curled above them, creating a colourful tapestry of bright oranges and reds tangling together over their heads. A steady, cool wind had whipped through and shaken a sheet of leaves free. Harry and Ron trampled through them as they walked, the plastic bag swinging from Ron’s hand. Their feet crunched on the leaves and Harry smiled at the sound.
Harry blinked at him. “What?”
Malfoy stared at him, a hard, searching look. It seemed to go on for a long time. Finally, he said, “It’s Hallowe’en.”
Harry thought about it so much he ended up writing to Lavender Brown, the only person he knew who had seriously expressed a desire to work with animals. It struck him as he sent the letter that he hadn’t really seen her since the incident, as people called it. When she wrote back, she invited him for lunch and Harry went, nervous and hating that he was.
The sunroom was empty. The study and the second study and the small study were all empty too. Harry hated how many rooms the Malfoy house had.
He thought it went well.
“No. But I wanted you to know that I would never, ever expect that from you. I don’t want it. And nothing I’ve to say is based on you doing that.” Harry stepped even further forward. Draco’s breath hitched and Harry cupped his face, his fingers moving back into Draco’s hair and tugging him forward so he could rest his forehead against Draco’s. “What do you mean by probably you?”
“I’m not worried,” Harry said automatically, despite the fact that anxiety had bloomed in his chest.
Harry sighed again and put his head in his hands. He thought about not doing it for a brief second, aware that it was dramatic, but it was half past eight, he had been up forever, his girlfriend had broken up with him, he had no idea what he was doing and his sleep had been punctuated with nightmares so bad he’d woken with a scream lodged in his throat. He felt entitled to a moment of drama.
,” Harry snapped, tugging a hand through his hair and then: “
“Wasn’t this meant to start twenty minutes ago?” Ron asked finally, rocking back onto his heels. “I told George I’d be home to help him by half four.”
Harry looked at him and then swallowed. He put his hands in his pockets to try and stop himself fidgeting, ducking his chin into his chest to stare at the ground and then looked back at Malfoy again. “If you want me to go, I mean, really, truly want me to go then I will. But you look — upset.”
Harry was thrown enough that he didn’t respond for a second. Then, he shrugged again. “Maybe. I don’t know. I didn’t really want to do any of the things we saw but it was nice to rule it out. Is sitting around in your manor and scribbling away helpful?”
“I do, sometimes,” Harry admitted. He still refused to move. The doorframe was his new home, it was where he stood and let himself be propped up. “But Ron and Hermione are my best friends and I
“She meant those things. What she said. She meant that people let the desire for power consume them and it obliterates everything else.” Draco glared at him and added, “But that doesn’t mean it’s always bad.”
“Well!” Ron looked flustered. “Well, it was for you, you know? I’d do anything for you.”
Malfoy’s chin was sharp and pointed at him. “Then tell me which bits are yes and which are no.”
Harry found himself laughing, head tilted down so the laughter hit the earth. He raised his shoulders almost to his ears, hands sunk deep in his pockets and thought about agreeing. It would be so easy. He didn’t even
Laughter escaped Draco’s mouth and it sounded more like a gurgle. He pulled his hair. “I’m losing my mind!”
Malfoy coughed and, looking surly, said, “Yes, Potter, I know. I didn’t realise that we were going to walk while you told me stuff I already knew.”
“That’s fair. I suppose I can’t even promise I won’t do it, but I can try to be better.” Harry tipped his chin up towards Malfoy’s face and then, when he noticed the other boy wasn’t looking at him, he lifted a hand, pressing his fingers coaxingly at the hinge of Malfoy’s jaw. Malfoy started but turned his head to look at Harry. His eyes were wide and grey, tentative but unflinching. Harry stroked the tips of his fingers along Malfoy’s jawline, ending under his chin. He smiled at him, uncertain and unsure. “I’m going to try not to be a gigantic arse.”
seemed so lost and now look at you! You’ve got plans! You know what you might want to do!” Hermione started to cry and then she flung herself out of her chair, wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck and pulling him into a hug that was made slightly awkward by the fact he was still sitting and still holding his bowl of cereal.
Harry tried not to say he had noticed. “I noticed that.”
“Lovely,” Harry said, stiffly.
, too. You really can’t hack it, can you, Potter?”
The thought warmed him as he walked into the Manor. Blighter eyed him for a moment and then said, “Happy Christmas, Mr Potter.”
“I know you’re fine. It’s just I want you to be more than fine. I want you to feel like me and Hermione do.” Ron opened his own drink, leaning back to recline against a park bench as best he could.
. Harry rarely got to see Draco’s face, slack with sleep, body completely without any tension. He used the pads of his fingertips to trace Draco’s face and found himself grinning as he smoothed a thumb over his eyebrows.
“It means I don’t have to cut them later, Mum,” Harry murmured back.
” She sobbed again, huge sobs which wracked her whole body. Harry dropped the letter and folded Hermione close into him, running a hand up and down her back. He muttered words to her, words of comfort and love and reassurance and Hermione cried onto his shoulder.
Harry looked down at his watch and wished he’d brought the invitation. But he didn’t
“Can we talk?” she asked, tilting her head up to look at Harry. Harry blinked down and then nodded, following Ginny as she walked out the back door.
Malfoy opened his mouth then shut it. He repeated this several times and then scowled at Harry, as if angry that he would dare say that. He didn’t speak though, so Harry felt emboldened to carry on. “I think your dad sucked, but it’s okay to be upset that you don’t get to see someone you cared about. I’m not gonna tell you that you shouldn’t. Probably.”
“No!” Hermione said, somehow sharp despite the fact that her eyes looked a little wet now. “It’s just — we were so worried about you because
“Oh, I don’t know,” Ginny said, breezily. “I’ve known you to like it a time or two.” Then, she winked; Harry felt the back of his neck heat up again.
“I’ve told you already I wasn’t brooding.”
“You got your answer,” Malfoy growled, “so can you just leave now?”
“There’s ghosts everywhere, Potter.” Malfoy looked at him like he thought he was daft. “I’ll have to be careful you don’t sneak up on me talking to one.”
“I really wish you wouldn’t.”
“What was that for?”
“What stuff?”
“No,” Harry said finally. “He doesn’t bother me. I mean, he bothers me all the time but not like that. I think I know what I’m doing.”
The weirdest part of the afternoon was how quiet Malfoy was. His presence made Harry feel like he had to keep his posture as stiff and straight as possible. He wanted Malfoy to say something but, then again, for most of his life Harry had hated nearly every single word that came out of Malfoy’s mouth. Sitting in his mother’s study in his own house, though, Harry expected Malfoy to say something.
“I know who Maleficent is!” Harry said. “I just didn’t know she played piano here. I thought she was too busy poisoning Sleeping Beauty.”
The three owls practically pushed each other over to get into Hermione’s kitchen, depositing their post and taking flight almost immediately. Harry was too relieved to realise no one expected an immediate reply to feel overly concerned about any of the owls, trying to ignore the way his stomach knotted once he recognised Ginny’s handwriting.
“I’m saying something.” Harry closed his eyes for a moment and then, “What do you think this is? Today is?”
Harry could tell from the moment he saw Malfoy, three weeks into September, that he did not want to see Harry.
Draco made a deeply affronted noise and dropped Harry’s hand, shoving him away from him. Harry laughed and toppled onto his side and then reached out to pull Draco down with him. They wrestled, tussling with one another, and when the wrestling turned into writhing on the floor, Harry gave himself over with abandon.
Draco opened his mouth to speak and then sighed. He dragged his tongue across his lips, nervously wetting the lower one and Harry watched it. He wanted to kiss him but his ears were ringing and his heart was pounding and he needed to hear it. Draco breathed out again and it was practically into Harry’s mouth. He tightened his fingers in his hair.
, Harry, honestly.” Draco opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, his expression sharpening in that particular way it did when he wanted to be mean. Harry lifted their joined hands and clamped it over Draco’s mouth.
“Harry,” Harry interrupted. It was the third time. “Please don’t call me Mr Potter. I really mean it; I’m not just saying it to be polite or anything.”
Ron reached over and clapped him on the shoulder. “Me either, mate. You’re wrecking my head.”
Narcissa tugged on a lock of hair.
Malfoy swallowed. Harry could almost feel his throat bobbing against the side of his hand. Malfoy’s tongue darted out and he licked along his bottom lip. It was the only part of him that moved. The two of them stood completely still as Malfoy searched Harry’s face and then gave a small nod. Harry got the feeling that it was so he didn’t move his fingers. “Being better than everyone is kind of your thing.”
Ron looked at Harry, askance. “I’m not admitting that at all.” He turned back to the display and sighed. “I should be happy they’re all out now. I told Hermione I wasn’t going to leave everything to the last minute this year.”
Harry had nodded, muttering “Of course, mate,” and Ron had made a choked sound and dragged George into a hug. Harry had stepped back to let them cry in peace.
“I would want,” Ron said, just as solemn and serious. “You’re a good mate that way. Anticipating my needs.”
“You don’t look busy,” he said, accusingly. “And I only wanted to make sure that nothing was wrong.”
Malfoy was breathing hard, lingering close enough to the rest of the candlesticks that Harry suspected they could become a missive again. He didn’t appear to have noticed them however, instead staring straight ahead, looking at Harry with a hunted expression. Harry lifted his hands, palms out, and walked closer.
“I hate this,” he murmured and then, voice stronger, Draco continued. “I don’t know if I do. I’m not telling you that I do. I just think that...I could. I feel like I could. I feel like it’s you.”
“It’s very kind of you, Harry,” Narcissa said, like a mediator, giving her son a sharp look. Draco undoubtedly could not see it from where he was sitting but it was evidently not an unknown tone of voice. He looked slightly abashed and then nodded, a silent agreement with his mother.
Harry rolled his eyes. “We haven’t really been around the potions lately.”
He decided Malfoy needed to know that. “Malfoy,” Harry said, slowly and clearly, waiting until the other boy looked at him before he continued to speak. “If you’ve brought me here to show me your award winning horses, I’ll throw up all over your shoes and then into every single one of those rose bushes. You shouldn’t test me either because I ate my body weight in macaroons like ten minutes ago.”
He bent his head and placed his mouth on Draco’s pale skin and showed him how hungry his desire was.
For a moment, Harry involved himself in the inertia of the routine. Kettle on, cereal today, bowl out, milk in. He made his tea, trying to keep humming, snippets of a song that had been on the radio as he had showered. With breakfast ready, he grabbed it and set himself down at the table.
Christmas was fast approaching, time suddenly hurtling forward with a speed that robbed Harry of his breath. Of course, that could have just been the frosty chill that had settled over everything. When Harry took the dogs out now he had to bundle up warm, pulling a hat down low over his ears, making sure he had gloves shoved into his pockets just in case. It was midway through December, late in the evening, when Harry left his last dog back with its rightful owner, waved off the offer of a cup of tea and wandered home.
, as you know,
“You told us the other day,” Draco said, like a sensible person.
Harry nodded and Malfoy drew back, patting the back of Harry’s hand. “Wonderful. I’m glad we’re getting to a place of understanding. It gives me hope.”
He even went back to Grimmauld Place, trying to ignore the clenching of his stomach every time. If it hurt, it hurt but that didn’t mean it wasn’t necessary. Harry had stood in the doorway of the house every time, told himself that it was going to be worth it and then entered. Kreacher was always delighted, Walburga was always less so, and bit by bit Harry was trying to make the house less stomach-churningly depressing. Sometimes, someone else would help him.
Harry frowned. He had turned away from Malfoy, pulling the dirty t-shirt over his head and dropping it onto the floor but he turned back slowly. Malfoy’s gaze flickered to Harry’s chest for a moment and then back up to his face. He steadfastly refused to look down again, his jaw set in a determined line. Eventually, he lifted his chin and pointed it to the ceiling. Harry shook his head.
Malfoy patted the bed. “You can sit here. I don’t want you standing around, that’s too odd.”
“Who do you think you are?” Draco asked, but there was no bite to the question. It just was.
“Nice?” Narcissa repeated, an eyebrow raising. She moved a hand to nudge away the teacup which had started to gently come closer. “Mr Potter, I would ask you not to insult either of us.”
weak then. She thinks my dad was weak and pathetic and she thinks I’m just like him.”
Draco hovered in the doorway. He was wearing dark navy pyjamas with gold around the lapel and small gold buttons. They looked soft and comfortable and his hair looked like he had been pulling his hands through it, rumpling it until it stuck up. Harry caught his eye and stared. Draco looked away, nervously.
Blinking at her, Harry looked at the letter and then tentatively held his hand out. “What does it say?” he asked, even as Hermione gave it to him.
Malfoy was quiet, adding ingredients slowly to the potion he was working on. “That sounds very nice,” he said. It felt like a whole minute had elapsed.
Harry stared down at it in surprise and then laughed for so long that there were tears in his eyes and Ron emerged from his depression nap to see what was going on. They demolished the cupcake together after rustling up a camera and taking a photograph.
Harry thought maybe he was in love.
“Yes,” Hermione snapped and then looked abashed. “Sorry. I’m just – do you think that something’s wrong?”
Hermione came home just before Christmas. Ron had known about it apparently, although he didn’t know the exact date. When she arrived, hair tied back into a severe bun, tiredness painted in purple under her eyes, Ron launched himself forwards, throwing his body at hers and gathering her close, breathing deeply. Harry watched his friends greet each other from the top of the stairs, the fervent kisses, the way that Ron kept looking at Hermione like she lit up his world just by being there.
Malfoy sighed audibly and followed him. Harry elected to ignore him but it was difficult when the room wasn’t huge and he usually would have shucked his clothes off by now. It felt different to do that in front of someone he’d been trying to kiss moments before. Still, Harry spun round, hands on the bottom of his t-shirt and glared at Malfoy.
“Oh Blighter, I told you. He’s unbearably stubborn and devoted to making a complete arse of himself.”
Once a time limit was imposed, Harry floundered for something to say. He slipped his hand through the handle of the mug, lifting it, and looked at Malfoy for a long moment. “I just don’t know what to do, I guess,” he said. He didn’t look at the countdown. The numbers sliding down made him nervous. “That’s what it boils down to. I don’t want to do something and then regret it.”
Malfoy smiled. He looked over at Harry, the dance of the flames in the grate reflected in his face. Harry watched the warmth of it light Malfoy up. “That’s a bizarre reason to not like someone.”
Narcissa sighed. “Yes. Not my idea, of course.” She chose not to elaborate and Harry felt he couldn’t push. She lifted her wand and although Harry tracked the movement with his eyes she simply waved it and then set it back down again. To his curious look, she said, “I’m summoning both tea and my son. Nothing to worry about.”
“Hermione, I’ve not a clue who that is,” Ron said finally, after her weighted pause went on a beat too long.
gives
Harry, suddenly unsure of himself, grinned and sunk his hands back into his pockets. They stood together without saying another word for a long time. Harry didn’t leave for another fifteen minutes.
It was on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say not yet but he couldn’t bring himself to. Instead, he just pulled a face and said, “Ron, if I have to talk to you, I promise I will.”
Harry squinted at Malfoy, wondering how he had possibly forgotten how loud he could get. Malfoy had been barely a part of his last year and, before that, sixth year had marked such a change in the other boy. He supposed it had been a while since he had had to listen to a Malfoy tirade and he’d somehow forgotten how chaotically bizarre he could be. Harry raised a hand to massage his temples; Malfoy looked extremely affronted.
It was too late. Ginny had already started into explosive laughter, throwing her head back so forcefully that the hair on top of her head wobbled. Harry groaned and covered his face with his hands, shaking his head forcefully.
Ginny looked at Harry and smiled and Harry looked at her and grinned and they were normal and happy and healthy. They talked and tried to push away awkwardness. Harry still tried to hang back and it was fairly late on before Ginny cornered him as he made his way back from the bathroom.
The look Malfoy gave him was scathing and embarrassed, which made it even more scathing. Harry delightedly swung his legs back and forth on the kitchen counter. “Not everyone cares about
“After the after?” Harry laughed, shoving Ron out of the way to check the vegetables roasting in the oven. “That doesn’t make sense.”
“No, I know.” Malfoy sounded uncertain for a moment, words coming out slowly as if he was giving them some consideration. “It’s just, Potter, you must admit that it’s a little foolish to think I wouldn’t know why you were upset. And,” here Malfoy started talking quicker, as if worried Harry would jump in, “if you dare deny that you were upset, then I’ll have to leave immediately. I have eyes, so I could tell.”
“Probably not.” Harry popped some of the cupcake into his mouth. “They still had a house elf. I reckon he probably does most of it.” He couldn’t stop himself from remembering the gloom over the house, the thick vegetation and overgrowth in the garden. The curtains he had noticed from the lane. “I guess it’s probably a bit much for him. The place didn’t look well looked after.”
Harry nodded. “So that’s what it was?”
“Maybe that’s what Molly says, but we know better.” Harry flashed Ron a grin, shoulder checking him as Ron pretended to be more put out than he was.
Malfoy Manor was large and looked gloomy still. There were many windows and about half of them were dark, as if there were heavy curtains drawn throughout. The garden around him looked as if the gardener had rebelled, handing in their notice months before and only a cursory effort had been made since to keep it neat. There were rose bushes gone thick, something practically wood-like with heavy thorns curling up the path. Parts of the grass looked like they’d been cut and others Harry was pretty sure would come up to his hip. He took it all in as he walked. The last time he had been here his stomach had been tighter with dread and anticipation; he’d practically ignored his surroundings, unable to notice anything but the swirling mass of emotions inside of him.
Perpetua made a low humming noise. “Yes, Mr Potter, of course. I suppose — well, I suppose we call forward Harry Potter then.”
Standing back, Harry looked at him for a long moment and then moved forward. He undid Draco’s trousers and didn’t have to endure any innuendo. He maneuvered Draco under the covers and pulled the curtains and watched him. Harry smoothed Draco’s hair and answered the ridiculous questions he kept asking, which ran the gamut from Harry’s favourite colour to whether Harry was really going to go back and try to help with his potions.
“I’m coming in?” Harry wasn’t sure why it was a question.
Harry just about muffled his laughter, pressing the sleeve of his shirt against his mouth to hide the sound behind. “Discrimination?” he asked, voice sounding strained.
“Ginny, I’m not asking to be your friend or for you to wait or—”
Harry pressed himself against Malfoy, holding tight onto him, and tried to kiss him back harder.
He fell asleep lying on his side, staring at the note.
Harry laughed as Draco fled the room, trying to stifle it behind his hand and failing miserably.
“Well,” Harry said, kindly. “At least you don’t need a lot of help with that.”
“How? I’m stuck here.”
Harry stared at Malfoy, who in turn was staring out across the fields. His eyes looked unfocused and, despite what he was actually saying, Malfoy looked sad. It was in his eyes, how shuttered they looked, and the way his mouth pulled itself down, and the heavy lines which had appeared across his forehead. Malfoy wasn’t looking at anything in particular, instead looking into the distance, with the fierce look of someone who wanted to run towards it.
Harry stared at it and sighed. “I don’t feel any more sorted.”
“Well, stop staring then.” Malfoy didn’t stop but he slowed slightly. “I’m not swanning.”
Harry curled his hand protectively around the box and glanced around the hallway as if Malfoy was going to be lurking behind a small table or emerge from behind the curtains. He did not. Blighter looked at him with a blank expression.
Harry tilted his head and stared at Draco for a moment. Draco pulled away from the attention, scowling at Harry, wrapping his arms around himself as he turned away to look outside of the greenhouse. While he studied the landscape, Harry studied Draco and tried to think of how best to get through to him. He wished he was Hermione, who was clever, or Ron, who had a tendency to be insightful and sometimes knew exactly what to say.
, Harry thought, and calm. He was tall, easily six foot four, and slender, with rugby player shoulders. He wore a shirt which was rolled up and there were scars across his hands and his arms. When Harry looked at them, Patrick smiled and explained that he used to work with very dangerous creatures and that those creatures were not the sort that Harry would be dealing with.
“Master Malfoy is in the gardens, by the fourth greenhouse,” Blighter said and then disappeared with a crack.
Harry loved Ron so much it made him feel a bit ill. He leaned in to him and let that be his response.
Harry shook his head. “No, honestly. But thanks. I appreciate it.”
“I’m thinking of having two breakfasts.” Harry pointed at the fridge. “There’s bacon in there. It’s calling my name.”
Malfoy stared at him and then laughed, a gentle exhale of air. He turned and started to walk. Harry had no idea why he followed. “Potter, in case you haven’t noticed, or in case my mother failed to share it with you, we don’t actually have visitors falling out of the sky. People do not want to come here. I have exactly zero interest in becoming your confidante but for the love of Merlin you could at least provide a prisoner with some kind of conversation. You grunted at me last week. Grunted! It was an affront to all of society.” Malfoy’s words got faster as he walked and he matched his pace to his conversation. Harry determinedly kept up, following down a corridor he had never seen before. They reached a door, large and heavy, a gleaming dark walnut. Malfoy flung it open and they were in a garden.
“He’ll be okay,” Harry said, pulling more weeds. Narcissa nodded and they worked together quietly for a bit before Harry realised that he hadn’t yet seen Draco. A niggling voice in his head asked him if he was putting it off. Glancing over his shoulder, he looked back at the house. When he turned back to the garden, Narcissa pretended that she hadn’t been looking at him.
Draco scrunched up his nose and pulled a face. “Sounds horrific.”
Draco screwed his face up and looked furious. “Oh yeah,
Malfoy laughed. “Yes, I suppose you would.” He stood up suddenly, pushing himself up from the table and beckoning for Harry to follow as he walked towards the door that led to the gardens. “I’m going outside, Potter. Come along, will you?”
Suddenly Harry felt as if he had to defend himself. Malfoy didn’t know the half of it. He didn’t know about Harry’s life, or what his friends were doing, or how he was coping. He didn’t know that the last few years had felt like hurtling forward at breakneck speed, barely hanging on, barely getting time to breathe and Harry wanted to enjoy the now but wasn’t sure how. He didn’t know anything at all.
Hermione looked between them and threw her hands in the air.
Harry hesitated for only a second and then went the fuck away.
Malfoy looked away and then started to walk, picking up his pace. His legs were longer than Harry’s but Harry had been friends with Ron for long enough that he caught up fairly quickly. “We have visitors coming out of our ears. Stop talking to me now. I liked you better when you were brooding.”
“And then they moved the date,” Harry told Narcissa, spreading jam on another scone. It was his third. He shouldn’t have been eating it but he was anyway. The day had been long and miserable, the December cold biting into his bones. Harry hadn’t minded it so much because it gave him an excuse to run with the contingent of dogs he had amassed. Word had got out that “the nice Potter boy” would take any dog out for a walk and Harry had started to almost draft a rota for himself of Hermione’s neighbourhood dogs that would fall into his care for a couple of hours every day. He thought it was good for him: he would run and run, letting the dogs chase him, chasing the dogs, letting himself be lost in the motions and blending into the landscape wherever he took them. It calmed him, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t sometimes freezing. He enjoyed leaving them home and arriving at the Malfoy’s, red in the face from the winter wind, shivering slightly, knowing there were scones and tea awaiting him. Narcissa very rarely disappointed.
Harry blinked at her and said, “I — I um — I’m —”
“Why do you care?”
When Harry wandered into Hermione’s kitchen that night after his run, it was to find her carefully filling a pencil case with stationary. He greeted her before downing two glasses of water and then turned to her, a considering light in his eyes.
“Oh, well,” Harry said, leaning back into the armchair, letting it swallow him. “If you wanted that, you should have just said. I could start with a lot of things. You know, how much it sucked he kept trying to kill me, actually. I really hated that. It turns me right off a person when they keep trying to murder me.”
“I could hold out,” Ron said, before he wrinkled his nose and shook his head at his own foolishness. They both knew he was dying to tell Harry and there was barely the space of a breath before he launched into his story. “Actually, I definitely couldn’t. Harry, it was bloody brilliant — they took us out to this forest to test how we’ve been doing. And I mean, it was hard and some of them were absolutely beat — you should have seen Terry Boot! — but my team did
“Oh is that a new hobby of ours?” Harry asked, tilting his head towards her. Hermione glared at him. “No, seriously. Are we going to be like the Non-Judging Breakfast Club?”
Harry frowned, pulled a face. “Why would I be sleeping? I’m there in the middle of the day.”
Lavender’s house was in Cornwall and Harry had to stand at the bottom of the garden path, staring up at it for a moment. It was extremely picturesque, all shining white walls and a roof that looked thatched. The garden was barely growing, which made sense because it
Now that Harry had told the Malfoy’s he was not going to keep coming back purely to annoy Malfoy, it left him at something of a loss. It seemed even weirder now to send an owl and request tea. Every time Harry found himself about to do it he promptly found something else to do. Hermione’s list meant that he had, in fact, too much to consider.
“You’re chipper this morning,” Hermione said.
“I’ll drink to that.” Ron grinned and lifted his glass, tapping it against Hermione’s, then doing the same with Harry’s.
“Maybe I’m not a decent sort,” Harry said. He pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s cheekbone and Malfoy’s eyelashes fluttered closed for a moment. Harry had the fleeting thought that he looked innocent, which was quickly chased away by how hard and greedy Malfoy’s hands were, pressing harshly on Harry’s hips, disappearing into his t-shirt, encouraging Harry to
Draco’s reply came back that night, a short response that his owl did not wait for.
“It’s not ridiculous. People talk about stuff that upsets them all the time.”
He shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t think —”
“Well,” said Harry, awkwardly, “you know what they say about hindsight.”
“I did think it would be easier. I wanted to talk to you.” Hermione reached out to grab his hand again. Harry let her. “We want you to be happy and healthy. Malfoy is — and was — a difficult choice. You know that, right?”
“Just you.” Draco’s wandering, tracing fingertips swept down Harry’s jaw, traced the shell of his ear. Harry stared at Draco, unsure of what to say. He wanted Draco too, of course he did, but the tone of Draco’s voice was different than usual — he sounded reverent and pained, hopeful and helpless at the same time. He sounded like he couldn’t believe he was saying it and like he meant it.
“I’m not
Narcissa nodded. “Of course. Forgive me.” She set her book onto the table gingerly and then looked at Malfoy. The two of them seemed to have a private conversation conducted entirely by looking at each other. Harry watched Malfoy’s face tighten with displeasure and then Narcissa nodded. “Draco is going to let us have a moment and then we’ll take tea together.”
on sale.”
“Draco is,” Malfoy said, still sounding incredibly sour. It was mingled with disbelief, as if he couldn’t quite grasp that this was his life as he headed towards the door. Harry watched his back again, struck once more by how thin he was and how weird it was to see Malfoy barefoot, sauntering around in a shirt so large it kind of made him look like a pirate.
“I’m here because of your letter and it’s delusional if you think it wasn’t an invitation.” Harry enjoyed the glare Malfoy shot him. “And I’m here because, like I said, I’m contemplating my future and it’s actually not that fun.”
“Don’t be,” Ron said, wrapping an arm around her. “Hope all you can, Hermione. It’ll be worth it.”
“I didn’t say I was.” Harry shrugged. “I thought I’d come say it in person.”
“They all are.”
Harry blinked in surprise. “I can start?”
“I’m not gonna get her a tea towel! I just — what if Mum wanted this one?” Ron reached out and lifted one of the towels. There was a trim of holly around the outside and the fabric was charmed to show a snowy winter scene, children pushing a sled down a hill and then trekking to the top, over and over. It was very festive and the children were redheads.
feel bad. That seems much more like her.”
The sun was so bright that Harry didn’t see when Malfoy started to move. One moment his hand was still dipped in the water and the next he was in front of Harry, looking down at him, the sun on his face. Harry felt Malfoy’s hand settle on the side of his jaw, thumb brushing up against his earlobe. Malfoy’s hand was wet and drops of water rolled down Harry’s neck and under the collar of his t-shirt. Around them, the garden was quiet.
Harry took a second to ponder every last life choice which had led him to this moment. “You are,” he said loudly, “the absolute bane of my existence.”
“If you talked to her again in a couple of days, she might change her mind,” Ron said. “We always used to say that about her. She’s always thought she knew what was right straight away.”
That night when Harry got home the house was quiet. There was a note stuck on the cupboard where the teabags were kept that read
Because he couldn’t think of anything to say to that, Harry just stared at her. There were many questions that rushed through him at once — was that a joke? Was Blighter a house elf? Surely, they were but then why that name? Who had named a house elf
Ron was true to his word and gathered information from Oblivaitors, hunting them down and flashing them smiles. Harry considered doing it too, leaning on his name and his history. He thought about walking into the office and saying, “My name is Harry Potter, I saved the world, I need your help.” The thought of it made his insides shift with unease but the idea of seeing Hermione looking like she had forever made him feel worse. He wanted to help. He
Malfoy was waiting at the door.
The owl had been severe, patient but firm, delivering the letter and waiting for the reply even when Harry tried to shoo it. He hadn’t been sure, staring at the short note, whether he wanted to go. The idea of it was so strange and foreign: if someone had told him a meeting with Narcissa Malfoy at
Hesitating for a moment outside the door, Harry stood with his hand on the doorknob and tried to think about what he was going to say. He didn’t know. Had he been supposed to write back?
than try that again but I have to make them or it’s for nothing, isn’t it? This is for nothing. Me nearly losing my mind studying all these stupid books is for nothing.” Draco’s eyes were a wild, tumultuous storm, thundercloud grey. He lifted his hands and dragged them through his hair, making it stick out ridiculously. His face was pale and strained and pleading as he stared at Harry.
“Malfoy, I can assure you I never once have acted thinking ‘boy I can’t wait for Malfoy to congratulate me.’”
The easiest thing on it to do was get a haircut, so he did, and then he made himself visit Gringotts. It was exactly as painful a visit as he had hoped but once he had exited the bank at least it was
Eventually, Narcissa said, “If you wish, Draco.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t be a baby. We’ll find something.”
“You can shove your amusement up your arse.” Malfoy’s face flushed. “Maybe it is! I’ve read a lot about it.”
Malfoy sighed and shrugged. He looked unhappy. “Even if I told you yes, why would you believe me? I wouldn’t believe me, in your place. You’re practically the only person I see. I would tell you ‘yes’ just to make sure I’m not completely alone, wouldn’t I?”
I just wish I knew more about it. I wish I was better.”
Harry shoved Ron into a puddle deliberately.
“Indubitably,” Ron said and Hermione wrinkled her nose. “He seems to have developed a glow as well, but for the love of God nor money, we mustn’t ask. The Harrificus Potterus animal can be both quite private and prone to oversharing.”
He kept visiting the Malfoy’s.
“I know, but it was still bloody weird.”
“It’s more than he can.” Harry deposited the weeds he had pulled into a pile.
Harry nodded at him, stepping up onto the platform and hesitating only briefly before he sat beside him on the piano stool. Malfoy watched him carefully, a flint in the back of his grey eyes. “Everybody changes,” Harry said, his knee pressing against Malfoy’s. “Or everybody should change. I think — I mean, you know that I feel like the world has needed to change for a long time, but I reckon one of the ways we have to do that is by looking at ourselves first. I’m not the same person I was two years ago or a year ago. I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing all the time but if we’re going to ask other people to do it, we have to do it too.”
“Mate,” Ron said, “it’s the best thing I’ve got to do so far.” He looked slightly abashed as he added, “Course, it would be even better with you there.”
“Curious, because I would not consider us friends.” Narcissa smiled, as if to soften the blow of sharp words said in a sharp tone. “I understand why you accepted the first invitation and why you came back, but why do you keep requesting tea?”
“Well. It’s like the saying goes. Every little helps.”
He couldn’t hear her. Harry could hear only his frenzied heartbeat in his ears and the voice in his head that told him where to check for injuries. His wand was out and his blood was pounding, rushing through him, urging him on. He was casting diagnostic spells quickly and then Hermione said his name loud enough to break through the fog that had come over him.
Malfoy looked over at him desperately and shrugged. “How am I meant to know, Potter? I’m no Seer. It just seems it.”
“What, can I ask, are you searching for?”
“You’re not,” Hermione said, still righteously indignant. “Not while Ron and I are around anyway. As if I’d ever let you be stuck.” She snorted. From his vantage point, Harry could see the depth of affection in the look Ron gave her. Ron didn’t even try to mask it, letting it shine through everything. Harry looked away and tried not to want that.
“You were being extremely formal. I just continued it.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You really can’t help yourself,” he said. “It’s ridiculous. You’re ridiculous.”
“Gin — “
? It’s not like you were having the time of your life.” Malfoy looked very pleased with himself, underneath his layer of irritation.
“I didn’t say a word.” Malfoy looked pleased with himself, a small smile tucked away in the corner of his mouth. If Harry hadn’t been looking so closely, he doubted he would have seen it. He needed to look away.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face and sighed. “Fine. I don’t know whether to accept the Auror offer or not.”
“You’re nearly finished.”
,” a voice thundered from inside and the door was wrenched open a few seconds later.
Draco let out a huge sigh. His spine curled as he bent forward and then he lifted a hand to tug at Harry’s curls. Harry knew he was holding them straight, watching them spring back into shape. He let him. “It’s a terrible telling off. I don’t feel cowed at all.”
“It doesn’t?” Harry kissed the skin under the other ear.
, Harry, I’d rather
Ron sighed, heavy enough that it was a surprise the flames didn’t waver. “Shit, mate. What are we gonna do?”
“And you’re not sleeping with him?”
“Are you going to run away?”
The sound that left Malfoy’s mouth was torn and broken, almost a sob. He looked swiftly away, staring fixedly into the fire. Harry pressed his elbows down firmly into his thighs to try to dissuade himself from standing, moving over to Malfoy and — and he didn’t know what. Reaching out and touching him.
Malfoy looked at Harry pityingly. “Potter, we talk about things all the time.”
, Potter, you ask for so much.” Malfoy slammed the lid closed on the piano. Then he opened it and slammed it again. “Stop making me
“Ginny and I decided to call it quits,” Harry said. He hadn’t meant to use that phrase but it was out of his mouth before he had considered it too deeply. He looked up from tracing around his glass to the matching expressions on his friend’s faces: surprise, concern, affection. It made his throat feel like it was closing over. “You don’t have to look so concerned.”
Harry nearly choked on his tongue. “Ron, I don’t know if that’s true.”
Harry pushed his hand into Yolanda’s fur for comfort and raised his hand in a wave. Malfoy stared back, his arms folded over his chest. Harry thought he must have been cold. The air had a very pronounced chill and the grass around them still had morning frost clinging to it. Harry could feel the ice in the air even through his thick Weasley jumper and all Malfoy had on him was a shirt and a pair of wool trousers. He stood still, looking as pale and remote as an ice statue. Harry looked for any thawing as he got closer.
“I know.” Harry morosely eyeballed his cupcake and then he lifted the best bit, the bit with the icing, up to his mouth. He always saved it for last. “You should’ve seen his face, though. It’s gonna be worth it.”
He suddenly sprung up from his seat, spine as straight as a ruler. “I have to go.”
“No. We’re not
Ron’s face was red and he shuffled his feet, looking into the corner of the kitchen and setting his jaw before he looked back again. “I’m your friend, Harry,” he said, reaching out and patting Harry’s arm. “I’m your friend and I’m happy if you’re happy, but I don’t want to know about —”
“Idiot.”
“I thought it’d be nice. They really did get me loads, which is great, but even when I go to the Weasley’s, they just — you probably don’t know this but Mrs Weasley always has the biggest spread and there’s so much food. If I brought everything, I’d probably end up charged with attempted murder.” Harry stopped. “I mean, food coma murder. That’s a new law. They’ve just introduced it. They’re calling it the Christmas law.”
Screw it, Harry thought, and stood up then. Malfoy watched him warily as he walked over to him, never taking his eyes off Harry for a moment. Harry held out his hand and Malfoy stared at it, unmoving. Eventually, Harry had to reach out and gentle prise his fingers away from the whiskey glass. Malfoy’s eyes were huge and hot on him: Harry told himself it was the reflection of the flames.
I don’t know how many invitations you receive that usually do that, Potter, but I would hope you had enough sense to refuse them.”
Harry sighed and then started to eat his breakfast properly, aware there was no use prolonging the inevitable. Hermione pottered about, making herself some tea, refreshing his, murmuring to Ron by the sink as he finished making his bacon. Once Harry felt that he couldn’t put her off anymore, he said, “Right. Let’s go. Where are we starting?”
“I was just wondering if all you did these days was drink.” Malfoy’s eyes were gleaming. “With me, with your friends. I saw the picture in the paper.”
Malfoy didn’t look like he admired Harry’s restraint. At the moment, he didn't look like he admired Harry’s anything. He still looked ill and sick and sharp and furious, blotches of colour high up on his cheeks as he breathed savagely and looked at Harry. “You’re
She started to cry again, but she was smiling and she launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck. “They said they want me to come visit. They said they’re starting to remember. They said they want to
Finally, she broke the silence. “I think I know what I’m doing this year.”
“But you’re
Making quick work of wrapping the scones in napkins, Harry slipped them into his jacket pockets and then stood up. He didn’t know where to go. It bothered him, the idea of leaving both of the Malfoy’s like this. It bothered him, thinking of the expression on Draco’s face and how quickly he had left.
they did whatever you wanted.”
Blighter stepped back and disappeared before Harry could say anything at all. He didn’t want to touch any of the food suddenly, but Narcissa didn’t seem to notice. She lifted a cup of tea and placed a bun onto a plate, which she set to levitate by her elbow. When Harry looked up, he couldn’t help but look at Malfoy too.
Harry bounded down the stairs, humming to himself as he nearly skipped into the kitchen. It was early but the whole house was awake: Ron because he had to be for Auror training and Hermione because she ‘liked the routine’ and ‘preferred to get her work started in the morning.’ Harry said his good mornings as he walked past the kitchen table where Ron was shoving bacon into his mouth and Hermione already had her books spread around her. There was an open notepad at her elbow and a pen but she was sipping on her tea and talking with Ron.
His hair hadn’t changed much, though the length had — it was still black and thick and irrepressible, always deciding what it wanted to do and just going for it. There was no real hope in taming it but Hermione had gently told him a few things he probably needed to do with his hair because “you’re just going to ruin it, if you carry on like that.” His hair curled more now and it was longer than he’d worn it when he was younger — and it was in significantly better shape than it had been last year. His eyes were still his mother’s, green and bright. Harry thought they looked sadder than they used to but they no longer looked as haunted. He no longer looked at his face and saw the nights of interrupted sleep or the days spent walking around like he was a shadow of himself. His skin wasn’t as pale, the bags under his eyes weren’t as noticeable. He could look at his reflection and see someone who could survive this.
and that group, we wouldn't even be here.”
“Potter, if you are going to embarrass me, I would really rather you left and did it in a letter. I don’t want to — I’d rather not look you in the face.” Malfoy was clearly very serious about it. He hadn’t looked at Harry and was instead staring straight ahead. There was colour high on his cheeks and the back of his neck was red. Harry watched it avidly and then he reached out, gently touching Malfoy’s shoulder. He started and then looked at Harry. His eyes were huge.
“Don’t be smart. It’s a metaphor. We are going to be metaphorically imprisoned.” Malfoy evidently saw Harry’s blank look because he continued, “By the chains of our past.”
Harry did not want anything but he said yes to water, to have something to hold as he sat there and waited and tried not to worry. When the animal Healer, a man called Patrick Jones, came out to get him Harry’s heart stuttered.
“I get it,” Harry said, soft. “Or  I don’t. I don’t get it, but I can imagine and I’m sorry, Malfoy. I’m sorry you don’t get to see your dad on his birthday.”
Scowling darkly at Malfoy, Harry nonetheless stepped forward. The gates barely waited for him to pass before they slammed closed, coming so close to his arm it felt like a reprimand. Harry looked at Malfoy for a moment and then started to walk up the lane. Malfoy wavered behind him for a moment before catching up, matching his steps to Harry’s.
For Hermione’s birthday, they went to a museum. Harry and Ron arranged for a bottomless brunch before the visit and they were quite thoroughly drunk by the time they reached the museum, all three of them clinging to each other and laughing. Every time Ron saw anything remotely funny, he tried to tell them in a level tone of voice and completely failed. Harry was left almost breathless with laughter as he stage-whispered, “Why does that portrait have that tiny man with such a massive bulge?” and an elderly couple breathed in sharply with displeasure before hurrying off.
“Sod appropriate. I’m here. If you want me to be or whatever.”
Hermione tried to be stern but it was hard to be stern when she wobbled as she walked and her eyes were bright with alcohol.
“Yes!” Ron looked like he was gearing up to get on a roll. “Based on not living here! It’s not my fault I don’t live here. I try and I try, but I can’t say no to my mum. You’ve all had her roast beef! It’s got its hooks into me and now I feel like I’m being punished for liking food.”
Harry blinked at Malfoy several times, thoughts clambering over each other, every nasty one digging in deeper. He took a breath. He took another breath. “I need you to be honest with me,” he said, instead of shouting. His voice was loud, though. He knew he sort of sounded like he was shouting. Harry couldn’t help it. “That’s what I’m asking you for.”
“The fourth time I knocked!”
found himself staring at Malfoy, his mouth open in surprise.
Harry took a breath. “You’ve said that before. I still think it’s not smart to tell people that”
Sick with his own worry, Harry waited until Hermione was probably asleep before he crept into her room, hoping to find Ron still awake. There was a moment he was afraid that they were both asleep and he was just going to be the massive creeper standing over their bed but Ron turned as the door opened, lifting his head. He nodded at Harry and a second later was standing in the hallway, looking down at him intently.
Harry shook his head. “Not happening. You know Hermione. She’ll move mountains to help them.”
“Merlin,” Ron groaned, shovelling steak and ale pie into his mouth. “This is your best birthday ever, Hermione.”
Harry picked his head up from Draco’s shoulder and turned to look in his face, frowning, knowing he looked open and far too earnest. His eyes were shining. “I’m not trying to cow you, Draco,” he said seriously. “I’m not trying to guilt you either, not really. I’m just telling you that making yourself feel physically bad isn’t going to actually help you feel any better.”
“Of course you can.” Harry looped an arm around Draco’s waist as they walked, a shuffling walk. “People the world over constantly sleep.”
“Maybe. I don’t know — I read they froze their assets, of course.”
. Harry tried to be as reassuring and resolute as possible, because he knew that was the best way and because anyone who had spent more than ten minutes in Hermione’s company knew she was a worrier. Ron, meanwhile, just nodded and said, “All right, mate,” and left it at that.
“What’re you doing here?” he demanded.
The words hit like a brick, huge and heavy. Harry’s mouth turned to ash and something ugly twisted in the pit of his stomach. He swallowed, his throat bobbing, but Malfoy looked supremely unconcerned and when Harry opened his mouth to speak he literally waved him away. “Don’t go on, I don’t want to hear it.” His eyes were bright as he said, “I want to hear all about your little break up.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, glumly. “That’s what Malfoy said too.”
Harry sighed and then shrugged, carelessly. “Then you’re losing your mind. It’s temporary. You’ll get it back.”
Harry swallowed. “I don’t think you’re about to explode. And I don’t — I  don’t want to tell you what to do. I want you to pick what you want. So you can be happy.” To him, it sounded like the right thing to do. Judging by Ginny’s face, she had slightly different ideas.
“It was Hermione’s birthday. We went out.” Harry started to chop the coriander. He was completely unsure if it was for the potion or for Malfoy’s dinner. “People tend to drink on other people’s birthdays, as you know.”
“I’m a shocking kind of person,” Malfoy said grandly. They lapsed into silence when Malfoy finally broke when he said, looking at Harry now, “All right, Potter.”
“I’d be delighted to join you, Malfoy,” Harry said softly. Draco smiled, his eyes bright even though his mouth looked like an unsteady line. They collected the brooms and returned them, shoving at each other in the shed, pushing each other out of the way as they tramped into the kitchen. Blighter appeared immediately to dissuade them from cooking and took an order for dinner before ushering them away.
“I can do it,” Harry said instantly, so fast that it surprised both of them. Ron blinked at him and Harry smiled. “I like dogs. I’ll do it. You’re busier than I am, anyway.”
When the music ended, Harry almost wasn’t ready. It startled him and he blinked several times. There was suddenly tension in Draco’s body that he couldn’t hide: there wasn’t a hope of it when Harry was leaning so close to him and breathing the same air. Harry lifted his hand and placed his palm, spread, on the small of Draco’s back.
“Is that part of your year of growth?” Harry asked.
When Lavender came back into the room, he reached for the books and leaned forward and peppered her with questions. She answered them all gladly and, when they parted, Harry promised to come back for lunch the next week.
Harry reached out automatically, grabbing for Ginny’s hands. She let him fold their fingers together. “That’s not true, Gin,” he said softly. “Nobody thinks that.”
“So you liked me earlier?”
Smiling softly, Harry turned and cupped Draco’s face in his hands. “I know. But if you want to talk, I’m here.”
“You’re so uncultured,” Draco said, digging his fingernails in more.  “I wish I could tell you that it makes me sick.”
“Oh.” Harry could feel himself blush. He cleared his throat and said, “Right. Let’s crack on, then, shall we?”
There was barely a delay in response. It made him think that Lavender must have been waiting for him because the door sprang open, even though she didn’t step forwards. “Why were you hesitating?” she asked, sharp and immediate.
Harry nodded and dropped his hand, stepping back. Draco took a deep breath and his chest rose and fell with it. He stared at Harry looking furious, but Harry decided not to take it too personally.
“I think we should eat maybe,” he said, running his thumb over her pulse point. He felt it jump and smiled. “If we keep this up, we’re going to be smashed before lunch time.”
Another two minutes passed.
He had not seen any of the bedrooms. He had not expected to. Stepping into the room, Harry didn’t realise what it
Hermione held up a hand. “Harry, be serious.”
“That can be arranged,” Draco said, shoving at Harry. “My mother’s not coming back soon.”
“You said you had something important to speak to me about,” Draco reminded him, after silence that stretched for long moments.
The sound that escaped Malfoy was somewhere between a laugh and a sob. He looked disgusted for a moment as he pressed a hand over his mouth, fingers clawed as if he could force the noise back inside his body. “You’re a genius. Harry Potter, world renowned scholar.”
“I’m going to tell you about my job now,” Harry announced. “You’re going to be blown away by how clever I am.”
Malfoy startled and looked round, abashed. “Potter!” He looked accusingly at Harry. “You were visiting my mother.”
“All right, Potter. Then, yeah, let’s say I’ve changed. Let’s say I’m different and somehow better. Are you happy?” There was something gleaming in Malfoy’s eyes that made Harry feel dangerous.
“Yes, well.” Malfoy shrugged, crossing to the desk. He moved some paper and unearthed glasses, which he poured the whiskey into. “You followed me as I was departing to drink myself into a stupor, you see. It’s not my fault you’re a stalker.”
obliterated or whatever. Of course you’re not.”
“For fun?”
When they asked Malfoy to confirm his name, if he understood why he was there, if he intended to be truthful, he spoke in short, clipped sentences. His voice sounded different to Harry and it made him look round at his friends, catching each of their eyes. Hermione was frowning deeply enough it cut a new line in between her eyebrows and Ron had her hand in his as he stared straight ahead. He turned to look at Harry and his face looked grim and set.
He wouldn’t have but Harry couldn’t believe how strange this situation was. He frowned and said, “I was looking at the sea.”
“And Narcissa Malfoy asked you to,” Ron added.
“You seem upset.” Malfoy spoke haltingly. “When I was — upset that time. With my father’s birthday. I was very grateful to you afterward, because you were there and you did the right thing and you didn’t seem to think twice about it. You just knew what to say and you did it. You were just there. I regret getting absolutely blottered and throwing up everywhere, but I don’t regret spending the time with you and I think that maybe you would regret it if I — if
“Please don’t say you’re enjoying what you have now, mate. It’s just you and us and then you visiting the Malfoys and then you disappearing sometimes into Grimmauld.” Ron looked serious. “You don’t even do anything there, Harry.”
“Harry,” he said and then, turning red, “Happy Christmas.” Draco smiled, looking shy, and then something settled onto his face. He peered at Harry accusingly. “I didn’t know you were coming.”
They turned towards him as one, a complete unit and Harry beamed at them. Hermione beamed back, her eyes wet and her voice hoarse as she said, “Hi, Harry.” She opened her arms and Harry hesitated for a moment and then he picked himself up, flying down the stairs and wrapping his arms around her. He pressed his face into her hair and felt his chest expand with how glad he was to see her back again, whole and here, if not completely joyful. Behind him, he heard a telltale sniff and then Ron was hugging both of them.
That made Draco smile. “That’s better. I don’t like it when you’re too nice to me.”
“Of course.” Narcissa clutched her hands tightly in her lap and then sighed. She looked down at the scones in front of her and picked one up. Harry watched her carefully and methodically pick the blueberries out of the top. “I am not feeling particularly hungry. You can have these for your friend. Pass on my well wishes, of course.”
“But I wouldn’t be mildly miserable if you were happy,” Harry protested.
Harry kept studying Draco, noting the flare of a sneer, the harsh amusement on his face. He recognised the signs of the boy he had known for so many years, the visage of the bully who had been determined to make other people’s lives hell. He recognised it but now it seemed like a facade, a mask that Draco was pulling on to hide the lost look in his eyes. Harry reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear; Draco stared at him in open-mouthed wonder.
Harry flushed thinking about it for weeks afterwards.
She disappeared quickly, her sharp steps ringing out and Harry looked from her back to Ron. “You going to come in with us?” he asked.
Malfoy took a deep, audibly shuddering breath and stared at Harry. He looked wretched and young, his mouth twisted into a deep frown. In the dim firelight, he looked almost vampiric. Harry wished he had taken off the severe suit. “You’re such a fool, Potter,”  he said, softly.
“I’m not a perv. You’re really picking this up wrong.” Draco shoved Harry back out of the shed into the day. “I’m going to keep the picture to gloat over.”
Hermione laughed, nose scrunching up as she watched Ron eat. “That’s what you say to everything that involves food.”
“Well, Mr – Harry,” Narcissa said, her eyes bright and cold at the same time, “it’s about my son.”
.” Harry raised his voice and it bounced against the tiles. One of the portraits frowned at him and he muttered an apology. “I do! I’m debating my future at this very moment.”
“Of course she’s not right!” Hermione interrupted. She glanced between Ron and Harry, pulling away one of her hands from clasping Harry’s to gesture. “You told me that you were excited to get back together!”
If he had thought about this ever happening, in a dream, Harry had expected it to feel like fireworks. He had expected the riotous explosion in his chest, the wave of emotion that would overtake him and make him feel like he was drowning. In his dreams, he would have expected it to feel like a bludger to the chest. It didn’t.
“I understand English,” Harry said, ascending another few steps. Malfoy became visibly tenser with every movement. “I’m asking what’s wrong, that’s all.” Harry stopped on the stair in front of Malfoy, tilting his head up. Malfoy looked down at him and, for a moment, his gaze was wild, unruly, unsure. He looked torn and terrified, yearning and angry. The expression was there for long enough for Harry to memorise it before Malfoy seemed to catch himself and turned his head away.
After a good twenty seconds of silence, Harry said, “I don’t really like this routine we’ve got. You, swanning ahead. Me, staring at your back.”
Malfoy lifted his hands and cupped his own face, fingers clawing at the tops of his cheekbones. He still looked wild and desperate, but the cruelty had leached from his face slightly. “Put your hands down, you look ridiculous,” he snapped. “I can’t bear you.”
“I can be astute,” Harry said, face warm. “I’m not daft or anything.”
“Hi,” he said. Draco jumped and spun. Water sprayed out, splashing Harry’s chest, before Draco ended the spell. He looked flustered and surprised, pink faintly rising up his neck.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Not in a bad way.”
Malfoy coloured instantly. Harry had noticed that he seemed to do that easily, his skin so pale that all of his emotions seemed to affect it. Harry watched the blush springing up, his eyes following Malfoy as he leaned against the bathroom sink. He crossed his arms over his chest and sighed, looking mulish and uncertain. “No,” Malfoy snapped. “Don’t be so crass. I’m here to tell you I don’t want you to take what I’m saying in the wrong way.”
Harry squinted at him. “You want me to go to a jobs fair?”
Because Harry didn’t know what to say to that or where to look, he ended up looking at Yolanda. She stared back up at him, tongue lolling out of her mouth as she shifted so she was panting against the side of his leg. She lifted her paw and pressed it to Harry’s knee. He smiled at her and rubbed a hand over her head, scratching between her ears.
“You’re right,” Harry said seriously, trying not to show how relieved he was as they walked in together. “I can feel it crumbling as we speak.”
He didn’t wait for either of the Malfoy’s to acknowledge what he was doing or chime in. He didn’t really allow them a chance to speak either. He hadn’t considered that it might be weird, turning up to the grandest house he had ever been in and presenting the poshest people he had ever known with a handful of neighbourhood presents. The thought had simply not entered his head until he was placing stuff on the coffee table, glancing at the muggle labels. At least, he thought, some of it was from Marks & Spencer. Not that the Malfoy’s would even know the difference. Not that Harry really cared, except it was so utterly absurd that he almost laughed.
Blighter had mellowed slightly as Malfoy had, evidently deciding if his master was going to spend time with Harry then he would have to thaw. As he opened the door to Harry, he did not look thawed. He looked just as stiff and unfriendly, a vague look of disdain on his face. “Mr Potter has not chosen a good time,” he said. His tone was bland but somehow it made him sound even more disdainful.
He blinked to try to dispel it, frowning deeply at the coffee table. He could hear Ron talking in a low voice and he tried to listen to it, tried to pull himself away from a swirling vortex of thoughts he didn’t want to go down. He couldn’t go down. This wasn’t about him; this was about Hermione, who was literally halfway around the world and trying desperately to try to right something she felt she might have done wrong. Shaking himself back to alertness, he stared into the fire, waited for Ron to finish his assurances and then heard him ask, “How is it going? With your parents?”
“Not really.” Harry couldn’t remember what the point had been, other than they could go anywhere they wanted now and Hermione had been pretending not to cry all that morning as she looked at pictures of her parents. Harry had suggested Oxford, but it was only because they had been on University Challenge the night before. “The eavesdropping mostly happened by accident.”
“You’re such a whinge, Malfoy.” Harry laughed as he stood and then helped Draco up. His cheeks were bright. He wanted to kiss Draco again but Narcissa was nearby and Harry had decided that he was going to be a gentleman. He wanted Draco to not be
When he pulled back, Draco pressed a kiss to the tip of Harry’s nose and then his forehead. “You are intolerable, Potter,” he said and it sounded like something else.
The look that Narcissa gave him was both sly with amusement and long-suffering. “I can’t say that that surprises me,” she said, drily. She took a step forward, crouching down by some roses and started to pull out weeds. As she did, she said, “I would like to talk about Draco. Momentarily. There’s no need to worry.”
Dinner was good, steaks cooked rare and garlic drenched potatoes. Lavender served them and said, “If I have to be a werewolf, I’m going to at least scare the vampires away.” Harry laughed so hard he nearly choked and when he went home, he was half-drunk and completely full. It was barely past nine and Ron and Hermione were nowhere to be seen. Harry made sure to walk quickly past their bedroom door just in case.
Hermione sniffled again and then she was crying, grabbing for Harry’s hand and then Ron’s. “I’m just so scared of hoping too much,” she whispered.
“Honestly, Ron.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “He wrote each of us a letter to apologise for things in the war. He asked us not to tell you. It wasn’t long after you first went to visit, I think. I wrote back, but Ron didn’t.”
“Don’t you think that we’re getting a bit too old for this ‘saviour’ nonsense?” Harry demanded.
“Oi no, it’s got my name on it,” Ron said. He stood quickly, making his way over to the fridge. He was extravagantly careful with the appliances still, touching the fridge as if it could choose to attack at any moment. Harry and Hermione had once sworn they heard him ask it not to give him an electricity shock. He was slightly better now, but even through the sleep clinging to him Ron was tentative with the fridge. He was far less tentative with the frying pan, which he slammed down on the hob, eagerly slathering it in oil. Harry grinned at his back.
He was never allowed to stay in the corner for very long. There was always someone tugging him forward, including him in conversation, asking his opinions, or trying to force food down him. Molly Weasley plied everybody with food and Bill and Fleur had apparently liberated a whole vineyard considering the amount of wine they brought with them. There were Irish coffees and brandies and port. There were presents exchanged and hushed remembrances of Fred and, shortly after, not so hushed remembrances. Hermione and Ron were caught kissing under mistletoe and Molly cried, while Arthur patted her back. Charlie kept talking about his partner in increasingly bizarre and outlandish stories that made Harry laugh so hard he hurt, before he eventually admitted that he meant his favourite dragon. It was wonderful.
Draco made a noise like a wounded animal and lifted his hands, digging the heels of his palms into his eyes. His chin dropped to his chest and he held himself so stiffly. Harry moved forward and wrapped his fingers around Draco’s wrist, tugging his hands away.
Harry squeezed Hermione’s hand and loved her ferociously. “Honestly, Hermione. It’s fine. I think your parents need a bit of normality.”
“I know.” Malfoy smiled, a bitter looking twist to his mouth. They had been wandering down corridors for what felt like forever but he stopped now, leaning against a heavy door and letting Harry in first. Harry was surprised to find he’d been led to the kitchen but he didn’t say anything about it.
Malfoy sighed and gestured to the gates. “They’ve been open for about ten minutes. We’ve been notified. Are you finished with your brooding?”
Harry was cut short by Malfoy stopping abruptly and throwing open a door. It was too dramatic an entrance and Harry cringed away, even as Malfoy strode into the room. Compared to the rest of the manor, the room seemed practically pleasant. It was clearly a study of some kind and it gave the impression of caging them in with books. The bookcases were mammoth, stretching from ceiling to floor, and crowded. There were not only books on them, but decorations – a huge globe, several jewellery boxes, and candlesticks interspersed the collection. There were portraits at the head of the room and a large desk in one corner whose surface was covered in neat piles of books and papers. The middle of the room was dominated by something Harry
Something twisted, sharp and biting, in Harry’s chest. He leaned forward, elbows on his thighs, eyes bright and earnest as he said, “Malfoy, if you tell me something and I think it sounds believable, I’ll probably believe it.”
Narcissa looked at him for a second and then nodded. “Of course. Harry.” She paused for a brief second, as if mulling over how odd she found it. Or Harry hoped that was why, anyway. He wanted to ask, to check if he was alone in it, but was fairly sure he shouldn’t be seeking comfort from Narcissa Malfoy.
“Well. Yeah. If you want to give me it. I wouldn’t — I guess I should have asked if you wanted to, first.”
Draco stared at him for a moment, quiet. Their breath mingled together and Harry looked up, counting Draco’s eyelashes so he wouldn’t talk. He could tell that Draco didn’t want him to talk. The silence felt restful and necessary as Draco looked and looked at him and then his fingers were in Harry’s hair and he was tugging at it, urging Harry up to capture his mouth in a kiss which felt like comfort. Harry could feel Draco seeking and yearning, and he gave and he gave and he gave, kissing him back like he was drowning.
The warmth had thoroughly disappeared now.
Harry winced. “Um.”
Once out of the shower, Harry moved automatically. He dressed haphazardly, ridiculously, barely paying attention to the clothes he pulled onto his body. His feet did not even make the smallest effort to carry him to the kitchen. Instead, they took him to his wand and then he was outside and then he was on the lane at Malfoy Manor and his heart was in his throat.
“I heard it.”
Sometimes, Harry loved Ron so much he wasn’t sure how to handle it. He wasn’t sure what he had done to make Ron love him either. Harry wasn’t sure what it was that made his friend love
Malfoy pressed his nose into Harry’s chest and sighed. “I’m going to hate me so much again in the morning,” he breathed out. Harry’s breath caught in his chest and then he lifted a hand to stroke through Malfoy’s hair. The other boy made a noise, a sharp inhale, and then he sagged against Harry.
“Ron…I couldn’t tell you.”
him he could stay there; the Weasley’s had opened their arms to him. He had Grimmauld Place and he had a vault and he could
that you even manage to dress yourself in the mornings.”
“Yes I did,” Draco said. “You just didn’t listen to me.”
When they separated, they were both panting. Harry’s mouth was kiss-slick and Draco’s hair had been ruined. He stared at him and then said, “Your mother is literally in her rose garden around the corner.”
Suddenly, Draco looked shifty. It was amazing how quickly that happened, how quickly his expression shifted from prim and proper to sly and shifty. Barely anything changed but Harry saw it nonetheless. “Yes.”
Pulling a face, Malfoy said, “As if I would, Potter. You can’t catch me out with contracts; I’m a dab hand with them.”
“I dunno,” Ron said after a moment, with a long, slow shrug. “I wouldn’t mind getting the opportunity to kick some of them in the family jewels.”
Lavender scoffed and then studied him, bathed in shadows. Even from the relative safety of her dark hallway, he could see that she had changed. There was a scarf wrapped around half of her face. He thought it looked like a dark, gauzy material and she had twisted it around her in some kind of elegant pattern. He could tell she had a scar over one eye, bisecting her left eyebrow. His fingers twitched in sympathy and his stomach rolled (how could he have been so selfish not to check in, how could he have only cared about himself and very few people, how could  she look at him now) but Lavender just kept looking at him until she finally nodded.
“That is not as comforting as people think it is.”
Hermione laughed. “You’re just trying to make me sound bad. You know exactly what I mean.”
Nodding, Narcissa said, “I understand. It’s dreadful to be unable to do anything.”
“You sound like Granger.”
Harry felt annoyance spike his pulse. “I was not late! I was on time! No one answered the door.”
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” Narcissa said, coming back to herself and gesturing him forward.
“I am.” Hermione shot him a watery smile and then held up what was in her hands, a letter that looked crumpled. “My parents sent me a letter.”
Pulling himself together, he ran a comb through his hair and then pulled on an outfit that seemed very appropriate before leaving the house. It was a late February morning and the month was dying off. It brought with it a shift in the air, a brightness to the sun. As Harry walked past gardens he could see them trying to repair themselves after the winter. The breeze brushed against the trees, ruffling the leaves. It felt like they were whispering at him.
Harry had considered it. He was ashamed to say that he had, the thought flickering in and out of his mind like a flame. At first, he had tried to deny it to himself: it was just another day, he was just restless and bored and frustrated with the tedium which threatened to creep into his life. He wasn’t upset about anything in particular, he was just aware that there were many upsetting things happening. He knew it had been daft; it hadn’t stopped him. Nothing had stopped him until Malfoy had calmly stroked his hand over the skin at Harry’s hipbone and Harry had crawled into his bed, listened to his soft voice talk. But even that had only lasted until Harry destroyed it.
“You have poor eyesight, so no one can trust your judgement,” Malfoy said, grandly. He lapsed into silence almost immediately, twisting in the armchair so he was studying Harry. Harry tried not to flinch away from it, willing himself not to shift under Malfoy’s stare. “What makes you think I’ve changed?”
Harry shoved him with his elbow and Malfoy laughed softly, his head tipping forward so his chin nearly hit his chest. Harry grinned at the side of his face. “I don’t think that’s on the cards for me. I just meant we, as in everyone. It’s everybody’s duty.”
“If you’re not, you certainly don’t have to go to the Malfoy’s again. No one is going to think less of you for dropping whatever it is you’re doing now.”
Malfoy stared at him. “I see.” It was clear from his voice that he did not see but was choosing not to ask any further questions.
“Not really,” Harry said, making his voice deliberately as calm as possible, “but it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. And she asked me, Malfoy. I said yes. That’s it.”
“Look at me, Draco,” Harry said but he didn’t leave it to chance, or Draco’s bravery, or any hope that may have been fluttering in his heart. He reached out and placed two fingers gently under Draco’s pointed chin, turning his head to him. When they made eye contact, Harry could see that Draco’s eyes were wild, dark grey and roiling. His shoulders were tense and his eyes caught Harry’s then slid away. Harry stood and stared at him and said, “Please.”
“I guess so. Malfoy said I did not have the gift of a prose writer. He’s not very nice, but I think he’s funny sometimes.”
when he became excited. He learned, too, the way Malfoy looked when he was tired, when he was laughing, when he didn’t want Harry to be there.
Harry pressed his hand against the side of the shower, his breath hitching as he bent under its spray. He had been told he was his father’s son, that he would have delighted his mother. He knew he had his mother’s eyes and his father’s skin. He knew that his dad’s family had been Indian and Harry felt his knees waver as he wondered if he’d know
Harry shrugged and said, “I meant what I said. I don’t need it all.”
Harry sighed. “My jokes are wasted on you. It’s a Muggle thing.”
Late that night, Herbert, the Malfoy’s owl, appeared at Harry’s bedroom window, pecking gently to be let in. Harry started and then pulled himself out of bed, easing the window open. Herbert dropped the letter onto Harry’s bed and then flew around, perching on the window sill and hooting lowly. Harry grinned at him and went to pick up the letter.
This time, Malfoy’s laugh was less bitter, instead skirting towards resignation. “That’s wonderful for me, then.” It made Harry frown and he was just about to ask what he meant when Malfoy straightened up and walked to a door not far from them. Harry had missed it. He could not understand why because the minute Malfoy touched the wall the door was there, gleaming wood, welcoming them. Malfoy pushed it open and said, “Come along, Potter.”
Once Ron finished the story, Harry grinned at him. “You’re enjoying it then?”
also, thank you to everybody who read and liked this and commented so far! i really appreciate it!!! i've been putting off reading the last part because vague wave but i'll prob post it in the next few days.
“Mate, this is so good,” Ron moaned, through a mouthful of cupcake. He wiped crumbs off of his chin and looked over at the two of them. “I can’t believe you didn’t get more of them!”
It made Harry feel unmoored to watch him.
? (Who had named an owl Herbert?) Hadn’t the Malfoy’s had a significant number of assets stripped in the form of reparations? It seemed impossible to pick one and Harry didn’t consciously try, just letting the words slip out. “Blighter?” he heard himself ask, voice weak.
“That wasn’t a question, it was a statement. Ask away.” Harry reached for some coriander.
“Oh.” Harry tensed and Malfoy lifted his hand, drawing it back to his chest. He looked confused and then he took a step back, withdrawing into the corridor. He did not look back and did not tell Harry not to follow him as he power-walked down it, so Harry took that as an invitation. Harry had not taken his shoes off and his footsteps echoed; he saw Malfoy notice, but he did not slow down.
Moving out of Hermione’s house didn’t mean she didn’t want him there. Moving out of the temporary stopping place that had been his home didn’t negate that he had lived there and been loved there and tried to repair himself there.
“I’m a bizarre person.” Harry toed off his trainers and pulled his feet up onto the armchair. Malfoy watched him carefully as Harry moved; it made Harry ensure to take great care not to spill the whiskey in his glass. “Malfoy, you know you’re going to see your dad again.”
Harry blinked at her. He thought about being smart and telling Narcissa he hadn’t heard a question in anything she said and then thought better of it. He was trying to be polite. “Curious how?”
“Stop looming. Tell me why you’re here.”
Draco froze for a moment, his expression slate-clean and then it lit up. Harry watched him and he could see the sunrise inside him, the light from the knowledge of love illuminating him. He wondered if he’d looked like this but decided there was no way. Draco looked magnificent, resplendent and Harry grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him in to kiss him.
“Not a lot,” Ron said, pulling a face. “Sometimes he asks questions and I answer them.”
Laughing, Harry said, “What? Ruining what? Making up names.”
“Good morning, Potter,” he said pleasantly. There was something like relief on his face.
Malfoy blinked at him. “I beg your pardon?”
“Anyway, I wanted to say thank you. I don’t want you to think I don’t know that you didn’t have to do it. And I don’t care why you did it, and I don’t want to get into some huge moral argument or to hear your morally amazing and righteous justifications for it, I just wanted to say thank you so I could do it once and get it off my chest and never have to say it again, ever.” Malfoy said everything in a rush, as if he really was dying to say it and never have to repeat it. It was almost impressive. Harry had heard a lot of rushed talking, but never in the kind of cut glass voice which meant every syllable was still clearly uttered. Perhaps it was a skill they only taught properly posh people.
, not when you had power over them, right?”
“Shoes off!” Ron imitated, but he was still grinning as he flopped into a chair and pulled his boots off. “Shoes off! As if you’re not dying for me to tell you what I did today.”
a headache,” he said maturely. Malfoy just nodded, as if he had fully expected that.
Harry’s smile was quicksilver and he jumped onto the broom. “No you don’t,” he said and then they were kicking off, heading higher, brooms pointed almost straight up. Harry’s heart surged and his chest expanded. There was a huge amount of space in his lungs and the air swept in, filling him up, making him bigger than he had been. The wind rushed by his ears and Harry could do nothing but shout with it, looping delightedly back until he was staring at Draco.
“Ron,” he said finally. “What does this mean?”
“Mr Potter, thank you very much for coming. I apologise if Draco kept you waiting.”
Ron broke the silence, although he did not think to stop eating as he talked. “So how was it? Dad always says they’re a nightmare.”
Harry liked that. He liked the atmosphere. He didn’t like how several of the other employees blinked in shock and surprise when they saw him but he was trying to get more used to it and he supposed it wasn’t fair to completely write them off because of it.
Hermione started to cry again and Harry found himself blinking harshly, trying not to.
Harry sighed back, half an imitation, half genuine. He took his own sip, tasting the wine and then another. The wine was a new thing, something that came about as a means to feeling more in control. “Let’s be proper grown ups,” they had all said, clustered around the breakfast bar after dinner, leaning into each other and enjoying the silence. That had meant dinner and dessert and wine and an attempt at talking about culture, which usually quickly descended as they all got merrier and bored with pretending. Still, a new thing or not, the wine was sticking around, fashioning itself into a new routine. Harry liked it. He wanted to be able to develop his own routines.
“Harry, I should like to propose something. It’s quite simple, so there’s no need to look so alarmed.” Harry immediately tried to look nonchalant, reclining in his seat, dropping his shoulders. “I propose that if you are here to find something to do, then we can find something to do. If you are here to annoy Draco, I ask that you do so far away from me.” She took another sip of tea. “We are not getting on at the moment.”
?” Malfoy screeched again. He looked as if he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. “
Even then, there had been a niggling doubt. He loved his friends and it was more than he had ever hoped for or imagined. Nine year old Harry Potter, shoved into a cupboard under the stairs and staring at spiders, could not have comprehended the depth of love his friend’s had for him. Nineteen year old Harry Potter, lying on his own bed in his own house, still approached it with awe. He could accept that, could even understand it but this — he knew this was different.
“Of course. Now, I suppose I should ask: what have you been doing with yourself, Harry?”
Patrick grinned. “Yes, of course. I’d be happy to have you with us.”
“A ghost, apparently.”
“You’re a motivational speaker,” Malfoy said quietly. He moved his hands so they were lightly resting on the piano keys, fingertips barely brushing against them. Harry watched Malfoy’s hands dance up and down them, occasionally pressing a key in. The other boy hummed a disjointed melody but otherwise they sat in silence. Harry wasn’t sure what the strange atmosphere in the air was but he felt like it was almost close enough to touch.
“Potter, you do make me laugh.”
Hermione left for Australia a week before Hallowe’en, trying not to cry, looking pinched and pale. Harry and Ron saw her off, both of them grinning at her, deliberately cheerful in a concentrated way designed to take her mind off her own anxieties. Once the portkey that started her journey activated and Harry and Ron were alone they let their smiles disappear.
Malfoy — Draco —- did. Harry felt it on his hand and laughed, his forehead against Malfoy’s, delight radiating through him. His hand was covered in Malfoy’s come and after barely a second of thought, he reached into his own trousers, pushing open his jeans and pressing them down to grab himself. Harry watched his own hand grab his cock, watched as he started to work himself, heard his voice murmur things to Malfoy that he barely comprehended. He heard Malfoy murmur something back, a lot of things which sounded like endearments even as he said, “You’re an idiot, Potter.”
to smile and refused to temper the impulse. “Not the polka dot one though, right? That’s just for us.”
Harry could feel his whole body flushing. Embarrassment swept through him, hot and rich, and he moved away from the oven and from Ron. Maybe the sources of heat were making it worse. Maybe he just needed to get away. Laughing a little wildly, he went to stand by the sink and the open window over it. “Ron, I really don’t want to talk about it.”
“Draco, you know that’s not true.”
“No,” Harry said firmly. “Get your own eggs.”
“I haven’t really minded having you over, Harry.” Even though he watched her closely, Harry could not tell if Narcissa was lying. “However, please do not feel like you have to sit here and be polite and quiet. It will do neither of us any good and I find that house arrest is quite dull enough without having a near stranger sitting across from me.”
Harry laughed.
“Oh do I?” Malfoy sneered. He looked cruel and violent as death, an imposing figure against the looming shadows of the Manor. Harry wanted to touch him somehow, to calm him, to pull the Malfoy he had started to get to know out of the shadows and replace the one standing in front of him. “I couldn’t imagine why. My father should be here but he’s in jail. That could be something to do with it. My mother and I should be allowed to visit him but we
“I don’t want you to go anywhere.”
The greenhouse came into view. Draco’s spine was still straight, somehow, even though he was carefully watering the plants inside. His shoulders were high and tense and Harry stood and stared at him for a moment before he walked forwards.
“I said it. You don’t know — you don’t know what every night was like for me right after everything. And you don’t know what it’s always like now. I’m better, Draco, but I’m not stupid enough to think it can’t come back. Hermione used to tell us that it was important to feel it and to know that it was temporary.” Harry could still picture her and her soft, hushed voice as she said it to him and to herself too, how they had pressed against each other on sofas and in the corners of rooms and how they had slept curled around each other sometimes because it helped. He remembered the comfort of it, when he had felt like he was falling apart. “You’ve not absolutely lost it yet, Malfoy, and I’m really proud of you. I just asked you a question about your potions. I don’t think you want to kill people.”
Draco stared at him and then laughed. “Harry, don’t be stupid. Of course I am.”
Blighter frowned. “It is just a bad time.”
“Yeah. Yeah okay.”
for the moment) bedroom. Harry had agreed to mind Hermione’s owl, which he felt was an important step forward. He still didn’t want his own owl, a part of him pulling away from the thought, his heart twisting when he thought about Hedwig.
Malfoy’s eyes were brighter again. He laughed. Harry hated it and he took a step back because he had a feeling he shouldn’t slam his hand down on top of the piano and he really, really wanted to. “Potter,” Malfoy said, sitting back, his hands bundled in his lap. “Is that what you want? For me to be extremely contrite? For me to prostate myself in front of you and beg for forgiveness? For me to change who I am entirely?”
, half-wild, half-tamed, stretching everywhere around the estate. As autumn swept in, they had become brighter; the cool, sharp winds rustling the trees and shrubbery, gracing the land with its own quilt of brightly coloured leaves. Several of the plants had died and Harry had noticed that greenhouses had sprang up, carefully reinforced with charms. Malfoy’s sentence, Harry had learned, meant that he was allowed to do very little magic and that every time he used it his wand logged a spell with his probation officer. Malfoy, who had admitted that it rankled, therefore did as few spells as he could manage to. Harry knew that he must have thought the gardens worth it.
Twelve hours would put them at three o’clock in the morning. It struck Harry how stupid potion making was, how thoroughly Draco had probably ruined his sleeping schedule. He didn’t know how much of it was on purpose and how much had been an accident but considering that Draco clearly wasn’t at his best Harry did the decent thing and decided not to ask. Instead, he ran a hand through Draco’s hair again. “Bastard,” he said fondly. “Go to sleep.”
“Yeah! Exactly!” Ron’s voice had climbed louder with excitement. “I’m saving the two of you from having a really shit club.”
There was quiet for a moment, a quiet that was only broken by the ticking of the clock that sat on top of the piano. Lavender studied him and then said, lifting one shoulder in a shrug, “Okay. I can help you. I have a lot of books about it, though, so I hope you like to read.” She stood up and started to walk. Harry noticed that she favoured her right side, putting less pressure on her left leg and then tried not to notice it as she turned and looked at him. There was a wicked gleam in her eye as she said, “Who am I kidding? I remember you. You don’t like to read.”
“Yeah. Yeah okay.” Ron didn’t move though, so neither did Harry. Instead he pressed his leg against Ron’s and sat there, staring into the fire, trying to comfort and be comforted, trying to hold onto the flicker of hope. Hermione had found her parents and was with them. There were just more steps in the process. They could do this, like they’d done everything before, like they’d always managed to. They could do this because they had always done things that seemed impossible.
Sitting at the kitchen table, Harry flipped through the first book. He didn’t understand a word. He reached for the second. He didn’t understand it at all. He reached for the third.
Harry really hated Malfoy.
“About me?”
“Sure, of course not,” Malfoy said, softly. “I don’t really — maybe you’re not wrong.” He looked sheepish as he said it, like he hated admitting Harry was right. “I can’t think of any way I could have been clearer and you weren’t getting it.”
Malfoy pulled a face. “Don’t be so disgusting, Potter,” he drawled. “I told you. I’m here because talking to you gives me a headache and I thought that, if we were outside in the fresh air, it might combat some of your natural headacheness.”
“There’s not really many here though, is there?” Harry said, hanging his coat over the back of one of the kitchen chairs. “And I don’t know if it would be dragons. I just think — like I love all those dogs. I want to spend time with them. I think I could do that.”
“That’s your problem. You’re not making your mind up.” Ron leaned over, shoulder against Harry’s, a warm weight. He was looking at him with huge eyes, a steady, weighted gaze. “You’re not an indecisive person.  I dunno why you’re doing it.”
Instead, he cheered. He watched Draco loop through the air and twist, his pale hair flying behind him. Harry watched Draco race birds and laugh and then he dropped in and flew along beside him, racing him and copying him and laughing with him. They played a form of broom tag, which left each of them nearly hanging off their brooms at multiple points, reaching for the other. They changed the rules constantly, shifting the goalposts of the game to make it more fun, more thrilling,
Draco always followed him.
“Oh,” said Harry, quiet as a mouse. He looked up at Ron. “Oh,” he said again and Ron’s face cracked, falling into pieces at whatever he saw on Harry’s face. Harry wasn’t even sure what it was — he couldn’t think, he was too full, too shocked at the weight of the idea that him not being happy would break someone else’s heart. He was revelling in it, turning it over in his head, as Ron wrapped him in a hug, huge and bear like, bringing Harry in and almost crushing him. Harry gasped and then hugged him back.
He wished he was someone who knew what to say to chase away Draco’s doubts.
“Well, Ron’s eating the bacon now, so that means we can talk about our list.” Hermione sat straight in the chair and folded her hands together, watching him. “Once you’ve finished.”
Narcissa frowned but appeared to decide not to take the opportunity to let him know how much she hated that greeting. Instead she looked at the ground in front of her, the still-green rose bushes and the leaves which curled up the side of a shed. “I’m trying to think of whether I want to incorporate some lilies into my rose garden,” she told him.
Ron transferred his gaze to Hermione who rolled her eyes, snorted, and then stared at Harry.
Harry scowled. “Shove it, Malfoy. You made your choices.”
“Let’s go,” he said. Ron and Hermione followed right behind him as they left.
Apparating into Hermione’s kitchen, Harry was not in the least surprised to see Ron sitting there waiting. His eyes fell on the boxes in Harry’s hands and he punched the air.
“You’re the one who can’t see anything,” Malfoy said sharply. “Only one of us is a speccy git.”
Because he didn’t know what else to say Harry said, “I was invited.”
“I think you’re right,” Narcissa said, nodding her head in agreement. She shifted slightly and Harry thought it was to look more comfortable. “We can put some of it to rest then. Though I’m afraid I did instruct Blighter to prepare the gratitude cupcakes.”
but Harry found he was reluctant to say anything. He knew it would sound too sharp and the thought of a proper argument made him feel weary. Instead, he looked around the kitchen a little more: the large fire at one end, over which something was roasting, but which seemed to have contained its heat to its hearth. Everything was gleaming and clean; this room had obviously been taken care of before any other, more care poured into it than several of the Manor’s other rooms.
“You are here for me,” Harry said, smiling at him. “I know you are. But Malfoy’s not — he’s not drugging me. I just genuinely don’t think he would do that — now.”
“So do I.” Narcissa walked with him to the door of the study. “Please feel free to call at any time for tea.”
Nostrils flaring, Draco turned on his heel and started to stomp across the grass towards the shed where the brooms were kept. Harry laughed at his back.
“Are you finished?” he asked his mother, barely sparing Harry a glance. Narcissa nodded and gestured at her son and Malfoy came to her side slowly, hesitating before he sat. He was still not looking at Harry.
Draco’s eyes were bright. “That shows how little you know me, Potter,” he said, his voice a murmur. “I don’t want that at all.”
Ron beamed at Hermione and Harry, soft and fond, his smile bright and affectionate. It made Harry feel lighter just to look at him. Ron was easily the most effusive of them all with his affection; the Weasley family was large and boisterous and loving and Ron seemed to find it normal to tell them he loved them when the feeling struck. Hermione was more precise and Harry himself far more reticent, but in the middle of a pub in London, all of their edges blurred by alcohol and laughter, they listed the ways in which they loved each other and stumbled home through the Floo in the Leaky, ignoring the photographer in the corner.
As it turned out, there were terrible consequences to keeping up too. Harry was evidently slightly better at holding his drink: broader than Malfoy, with more mass, and probably having eaten a proper meal in the last few days, the whiskey didn’t hit him like it hit Malfoy. He drank like he was chasing oblivion, pining for the sweet decimation of misery in every glass of whiskey he threw back. Harry fed Malfoy water and tried to coax him into eating anything Blighter brought to them. In a fit of melodramatic pique, Malfoy grabbed one of the sandwiches, yelled “I didn’t know you were a
Draco spoke to his mother in a low voice. As Harry approached the door, he could see that he was sitting on the ground at Narcissa’s feet. She had chosen the armchair closest to the fire and every now and again she ran a hand through her son’s hair. They were lit up by the glow of the fire and Harry stood for a moment, watching them and thinking how picturesque they looked. He could scarcely believe that he could see this now, that things had changed so much in a few months that this brought him joy but it did. He looked for the people who he had once known and he knew they were: brash or harsh, snotty and rude, bigots who clung to an ideal until it nearly destroyed them. He could see them, but over everything he could see the people he had begun to know.
“It’s going to be okay,” he said and he believed it. Sitting back, he placed his hands on her shoulders and said, “They’re remembering. We’re gonna get you there. You’re going to be just fine and so are they.”
“Of course it makes sense. You just don’t want to admit you’re a perv.” Harry folded his arms and leaned against the doorframe as Draco surveyed the inside of the shed. He could tell that it had once been bigger, better, filled with more brooms. They had sold many of them off, or the Death Eaters had taken them and never returned them. There was still a small collection and Draco clearly decided on two, handing one to Harry and keeping the other for himself.
“I’ll call Blighter to —”
“Yeah. Yolanda’s great, I mean you can see that, and maybe then it gets you out of the house a bit. I know it’s not a lot but,” Harry trailed off, shrugging. “If you wanted.”
Malfoy tilted his face back towards Harry, staring down at him with a deep wrinkle on his forehead. His eyes were huge, warm as steel melted down, and he reached out. Malfoy looked as shocked as Harry was when his fingers settled on Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned his head to look at it; Malfoy hesitated and then his hand smoothed over the shoulder over Harry’s t-shirt. He patted Harry’s shoulder and then said, “It’s my father’s birthday.”
“This is your bedroom!” he said, almost accusingly.
“Shut up about that, Malfoy,” Harry said sharply, waving a dismissive hand. “I don’t care about that. We’re not talking about me. Yeah, she meant them but you’re an idiot if you think she meant
It was only when he stopped that he realised Draco was smiling at him.
Flexing his toes slightly so Hermione would roll her eyes at him, Harry smiled and said, “Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be?”
Harry pushed a smile onto his face and nodded and left. He found Draco in a long portrait gallery, which was currently completely empty of any portraits. Draco was sitting in the corner, on the ground, a book propped against one knee and the other drew up. He looked up when Harry entered.
“I wish.” He sounded grim about it, stalking over to the door of the study. Harry flexed his fingers around the box filled with cupcakes in his hand, gave Narcissa a bewildered look and a muttered goodbye, before he turned and followed Malfoy.
Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco. “I didn’t say that.”
“Yes, I suppose it is,” Narcissa said, after a moment. She finally paid attention to the teacup and took a sip before replacing it. None of her movements were dainty but they were all elegant, a lifetime of aristocratic manners apparent in every one of them. A part of Harry envied it, even though he thought it was ridiculous at the same time. He recalled with some horror his third visit when he set the cup down too forcefully and it had shattered.
“Draco,” Harry said, reaching for his hand. “I mean it. I’d not say if I didn’t.”
about anything.”
Then, he tuned back in as he saw her expression grow tighter. “Mr Potter – “
“You want to testify for Narcissa Malfoy?” Perpetua Crank asked, the large floppy hat on her head moving with every word. Harry glanced at it and thought back to what Hermione had told him about her during her long treatise on every Wizengamot member he would need to know.
Harry did not keep going back to the trials. It seemed unnecessary after he testified and if he wanted to learn anything else, all he had to do was read a paper. The coverage was relentless, if tucked behind a few human interest stories — Neville took a trip to buy some new gloves and the paper talked about the size of his hands for a frankly ridiculous amount of time. Seamus had insisted everyone meet at the pub and read the article aloud, swooning and carrying on, pretending to fall at Neville’s feet until he’d turned red as a tomato.
Malfoy’s face still looked pinched but he met Harry’s eye. “Ignore is a strong word.”
Harry had guessed as much but he decided against telling Draco that. Instead, he hummed encouragingly and kept them walking through the manor, towards Draco’s bedroom. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Blighter at one point and raised a hand in a half-wave. Blighter nodded in acknowledgement, keeping a close eye on their movements. Draco’s feet were trailing.
“Ronald, you aren’t helping,” Hermione hissed.
Harry thought it was rich for someone who was probably over six foot to tell
“No.” Malfoy drew himself up to his full height. “You may think that everyone’s going to just fall at your feet — Saviour Potter, back at it again! — but I won’t. I won’t just let you come in here and upset
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “It doesn’t mean anything other than you sound like Granger. Rushing into things is what you do best, Potter, anyway. Everyone knows that.”
It was too late now. He was here now. Gathering his courage, Harry pushed open the door.
“I think it’s been hard for him,” he said carefully, hunkering down. He started to pull up weeds beside Narcissa. “Obviously it’s been hard for him but now that you can go out, too, I think it’s harder. I think he feels stuck.”
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione cried, flinging out her hand to reach for his. Harry let her pull it towards him. “Oh, I’m so sorry.”
Harry found himself lifting his hand, in an almost wave. Malfoy furrowed his brow and he could feel Ron beside him turning to look at him.
His legs didn’t feel like they were working. Harry lowered himself and stared into Hermione’s face. “But you’re crying.”
“I’m going to sit,” Harry announced, still staring at Malfoy, and then he nearly tripped over his own laces as he plonked himself down onto the wall around the not-quite-pond. He looked at Malfoy.
like that’s the case, Potter, when you keep doing it. I loathe this conversation. I loathe everything you’re saying.”
“I got your letter,” Harry said, coming to a stop right in front of him.
Ron nodded, looking thoughtful. “Can I say ‘I am the great Ronald Weasley and I command you move this date?’”
“You’re not being punished for liking food, Ronald,” Hermione said. She was much better at not laughing than Harry. “We also don’t have a breakfast club.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s fine, honestly. I mostly just want to be as happy as you looked talking about it, you know? I don’t think I’d be that happy where you are, so it’s best for both of us.”
Everything Harry could think of to say sounded stupid even within the confines of his head (“I didn’t know you had a bedroom”) so he chose, instead, to reach for the glass in Malfoy’s hand and take it, throwing back the whiskey. When he tilted his chin down again, Malfoy was watching him with glittering eyes.
For a moment, he couldn’t speak. He knew the Malfoy’s had been obscenely wealthy. He knew that they were
Harry didn’t particularly like buying them, mostly because he didn’t know what they did, but when he asked Draco about it he started spinning out. He flew around the kitchen like a frightened bird, his limbs flapping everywhere like wings. His eyes were huge and his voice high as he recited all the potions to Harry that he needed to make, needed to get evaluated, needed to be
“It’s only a kitchen,” Malfoy said, gruffly. He folded his hands around one of the mugs of tea. “Blighter will get you tea if you want.” Harry didn’t have time to answer: Blighter simply appeared once Malfoy spoke his name and began preparing the tea. Harry decided that telling him not to could be seen as an insult.
“Next week, maybe?” Patrick’s eyes are dancing and Harry smiles back and nods. He could do next week. He could do whenever.
but always sitting there, looking at me like a time turner about to explode?” Her voice had increased in volume, getting more and more high pitched.
“No,” Harry said, after a beat. “You can, though. If you want.”
“Don’t patronise me,” Malfoy spat. “I don’t believe you for a second.”
“You’ll definitely wanna when you’re in bed, though.” Harry curled an arm around Malfoy. “Trust me, okay? We’ll get you to bed and I’ll tell Blighter to make sure you’ve got everything you need waiting on your bedside table for your hangover tomorrow.”
He did, though. He couldn’t help himself. He watched Malfoy’s face split up, delight, relief, and
Harry grinned. “I usually do, but I was feeling adventurous today.”
Draco laughed and said, “I’m always blown away by you.” He instantly blushed and added, “Not by your cleverness, as you really are daft.”
Before Harry could say anything she had disappeared, her laughter trailing down the hallway back to him. Harry sat back in the armchair and looked around Lavender’s crowded living room, waiting for her to come back with a lot of books that he would read and felt a spark in his chest which felt like contentment. He imagined getting his questions answered, imagined finding a purpose. He pictured himself going home and telling Ron and Hermione and he thought about their faces and how happy they would be if he knew what he wanted. He thought about telling Draco as Draco added drops to one of his potions, imagined the quirk of his eyebrow and how he would roll his eyes just before he smiled. It made him feel happy.
Harry blinked at Malfoy who had ceased playing when they walked into the room. The piano he sat at was huge. Harry had heard of grand pianos before, although he had never seen one. He certainly had never seen one as ornate as the instrument before him, polished until it gleamed, shining with a gold floral design that twisted up its legs, around its edges, spilling over the top. The piano was just off the centre of the room on a large podium, surrounded by vases. It was the most ostentatious thing that Harry had possibly ever seen.
“Tell the truth. I dare you.”
Ron was half-asleep on the sofa later that night, a half-drunk cup of hot chocolate on the coffee table, his socked feet propped up near it. Harry watched him for a long time, thoughts going everywhere, firing at everything and nothing, everything he wanted to talk about slipping through his fingers until he cleared his throat. Ron lifted his head just slightly, blinking at Harry.
He eased himself down to sit, not watching but not looking away. He tuned out their whispered murmurs, he unfocused his eyes and looked at the ceiling, and then when the greeting was done he said, “Welcome home, Hermione.”
“Of course, Mr Potter, but you must admit —”
Draco’s nostrils flared and his body shuddered. Harry could see the movement through his pyjamas. “Is that it?”
When the response came, it was early the next morning. Harry had fallen asleep in a curled up ball in the middle of the bed with the window open and the curtains not fully closed. Sunlight slithered in, cut-glass and bright, but it wouldn’t have woken him up yet if it wasn’t for Herbert. Harry blinked into wakefulness and grabbed for his glasses, staring at the owl in front of him.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded, bit his bottom lip, and then shrugged. “But is it hard?”
Ron shook his head. “Yeah and that’s it, isn’t it? You wouldn’t make me, but I know I should. It’s just — Mum got a bit. And you know what she’s like, but I don’t think she’s wrong, but I don’t know if she’s right either.”
,” Malfoy stood, raising a hand to tug at his hair. It looked like a painful motion; it looked like he wanted to pull the hair out at the root. Harry resisted the urge to go to him. “You should know this, Potter. You said — I
Hermione gave up on trying not to laugh and leaned fully against the counter, burying her face in her hands for a moment. Her freshly-braided hair even shook with the force of it. “You’re a saint, Ron.”
It was strange, Harry thought, how much the war changed people. He remembered Lavender differently — he remembered her as being high strung, fanciful, doting. He could easily picture her, still, wrapped around Ron, calling him pet names and beaming girlishly and giddily at everything. He hadn’t been in school for the last year and he wondered how much she had changed or if this person had always been there. The thought occurred to him that maybe Lavender had always been blunt and to the point and he had just brushed it aside because it didn’t fit with how he thought of her. It shamed him and Harry looked at her for a long moment.
Shrugging, Ron said, “Sort of. You’ll see.”
Harry stared at Ron and then he laughed. “Mate, you bandied your names about?”
“It’s not nothing.” Ginny was on her feet now too, staring up at him with her jaw set. “It’s the only thing you’re doing. And I’m not going to just sit around and let that happen to me too. I’ve got stuff I want to do and stuff I need to do and if you want to stay stuck then that’s your prerogative but I won’t be doing it with you.”
