“Do I?” Draco was smirking, which meant nothing good was going to happen. “I can dirty talk in French if you want.”
“For sure.” He smiled at him, a genuine smile Harry had never seen before, at least not directed at him. “I was asked to bring you to the headmistress’ office, if you’d like to follow me.”
“Not yet." He turned slightly to hide his face against his neck, and he threw an arm over his chest to hold him close.
“How is he doing?” Harry jumped at Hagrid’s voice. He must have been really out of it not to notice him.
“Oh please, call me Draco. The last thing I want is to be treated like my dad.” He visibly shivered at that, and Harry barely held back a laugh.
“We don’t know for sure. What we do know is that the forest is more dangerous than ever, and kids still manage to go there. We were hoping you could scare them a bit and then teach them something if they still decide to break the rules. There is only so much we can do to stop them.”
“I just wanted to see, in case I need to do it for the missing part,” he lied, although now that he thought about it that might have been a possibility.
“Shit.” Harry was coming in seconds, thrusting his hips against Draco’s hand and holding on to his shoulders.
“Okay then.” Malfoy took his place on the chair next to Harry’s and folded his hands on his lap, looking quite nervous.
“Oh," was all he managed to say. He leaned back against the headboard, looking over Draco's shoulder because he was too afraid to look him in the eyes. He was one hundred percent sure that he would have been able to see his panic.
“Alright. I just have to get used to the idea that no one will ever replace Hedwig, you know? I might never have that same connection, but I like the company of a pet, I like taking care of it.”
“You can start wearing them again after our one-year anniversary, when the flame is gone and we are just settling down.”
“Okay.” He didn't sound convinced at all, but that would have to do for the time being. “Can we go to bed?”
“Lucky you.” He kissed his should and rubbed his nose against it. “I know we wanted to spend the night together, but I'm about to fall asleep.”
“I just want to be left alone for at least another ten years. I lived and risked my life enough times, now I want to enjoy the small things. I want to enjoy my friends, my family, and my relationship. I have time to live, I just want to find the right person to do it with.”
They approached the door and someone immediately opened it for them. They thanked them man, Harry a bit lost and awkward and Draco clearly in his element.
“I do.” He stared at him for a couple of seconds, then he sat up. “Wait here, I’ll go call Madame Pomfrey.” He got up quickly and left to find the school matron. He found her in her office, reading an old book. “Draco woke up,” he said as soon as he had her attention.
“Mmh, I’ll ask Hermione.” He took out a cell phone from his jeans, and Harry almost started choking. “She insisted on me having this, especially if we have a kid. I still don’t get how it works. These tiny buttons are horrible.” He flipped the phone open and started pressing buttons as if it were a writing machine.
“This is already my best Christmas ever,” he said, bringing a hand down on Harry’s head and the other behind his own neck.
“I really wish I could leave the castle more often.” His expression softened, and Harry reached over to touch his arm lightly.
“How come?” They reached a corridor and Malfoy started walking next to him. He looked kind of imposing, what with being so tall and his face so serious.
“I’m glad. I won’t lie and say I’m not finding it incredibly amusing how uncomfortable he is, but he is alright.”
“I know, but their intentions are different, and they still respect and follow their owners. If this thing is out of control, we might be able to detect its intentions, desires, all that stuff that makes us more human.”
“Did I miss something?” Ron asked after a couple of seconds of incredibly tense and awkward silence.
“I will.” Whether he wanted to or not, he knew he was going to think about it anyway. What if Ron was right? What if Malfoy liked him? He had the feeling he would have to be the one to bring it up if that was the case, because it seemed that Malfoy still felt unworthy of love.
Draco just turned around and stared into his eyes for the longest moment. “Will you ever start doing something for yourself?”
“If you are talking about me, I’m going to puke,” Draco said, entering the room with his father right by his side.
“Then good, nothing would make me happier.” He hugged him, careful not to squeeze Theo, and he just stayed there a moment, enjoying it all: Draco’s body against his, his perfume, Theo still asleep between them, and the whole Weasley family happily chatting all around them.
“Hermione loves you, she knows and trusts you, if she says she wants a kid with you, it's because she knows you can do it. You grew up with so many siblings and an amazing father, there is no way you can fuck this up. Besides, if you give your kids love that’s really all that matters, and I know you will love and support them with everything you have.”
“Oh, but of course. Let me see what me have here.” He opened a box over his desk and showed him its content. There were at least fifty necklaces, around twenty rings and a couple of bracelets. “We also have perfumes.”
Harry laughed at that, so incredibly happy about what was going on between them. “I was also thinking about going on a date this Saturday. Would you like that?”
“You like Christmas?” For some reason, that idea was incredibly funny to him. Draco, pureblood, raised to hate muggles, loved Christmas. “Is it to piss of your father?”
“Well I just wanted to remind you that I don’t hate any of you. You weren’t even here when it happened, you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Your house is a strong one, and yes, a lot of dark wizards came from here, but also many great ones. And I want you to be the next good ones. Do you want to know a secret?”
“Draco, I legit just told you that I love you. I don’t want to leave you, I want this to work, and I will do whatever I can to make it last, okay? kDo you not trust me or is there more?”
“I forgot where I was going with that," he lied, trying to keep busy with cleaning his hands and his coat, turning around so that Harry could not see him.
“It’s okay.” He started playing with his shirt, and he cursed loudly when he noticed the big hole in the middle of it. “Fucking hell, why do they keep this damn forest. And near the kids. I’ll never understand their logic.”
“It’s fine, I really do understand you. The people I grew up with were horrible, I don’t really consider them as family, but yeah, I know what that’s like.”
He woke up with Draco still in his arms. He looked so much smaller than usual, and even though he was slightly taller than him, they just fit perfectly. He kissed his head, and rolled away from him to write to McGonagall and get started on breakfast.
“Thanks, I needed this.” He relaxed against his chair and took a sip of coffee. “I'm just scared to fuck up, and that Hermione will get pissed at me and my kid won’t take me seriously or something.”
“Really?” He looked so scared Harry almost got up to hug him, instead he settled on reaching out and putting his hand on his arm in a reassuring way.
“Then perhaps you can tell Robards you’re working on our case. Listen, Harry, I wouldn’t trust anyone else. Not only are you the best choice to teach the kids, but you know the forbidden forest and its creatures way more than you should. Hagrid said he'll come with you when you start exploring, and he'll show you where they found the killed animals.”
“Look at you.” He pinched his cheek and retracted his hand before Harry could slap him. “Do you think he’d like to come have dinner at our house? Just so we can get to know him better and he can get to know us.”
“Are you fine with apparating to Hogwarts? Or I could go there and open my Floo network for you, I’m sure you can find a place in Diagon Alley that will let you use theirs.”
“You did? And how did it go?” He sounded curious, but not in a nosy way, which was something Harry really appreciated in that moment.
“Of course it is, love.” He shimmied down to be able to rest his head on his shoulder. “And thank you for staying with me the whole time.”
“I can't believe it's really happening,” Draco said, and his smile was so big Harry was mentally comparing him to the brightest things he had seen in his life.
“Let me know how it goes.” He finished his coffee in one go and relaxed against his chair. Bad move.
“Okay, fine. God, you sound like Molly.” He finally got up and stated getting dressed, while Draco seemed intent on not moving at all. “Love, you will be late.”
“Sounds good.” He moved a bit until they were resting on the same pillow and he kissed him slowly, enjoying the moment and Draco's desperate noises, how he clutched to him and held on tight. “Good night, love.”
“We are more mature now.” At that she lifted an eyebrow and looked at him sceptically. “Okay, maybe not mature. But a lot of things have changed. Malfoy has changed. He is a completely different person now, he dropped the attitude and snarky remarks, and kept his brilliant mind and impeccable manners. And the fact that he opened up, with me of all people, it made me feel like he really wants this change. I’m really glad you took him in when he needed it most, thank you.”
“Okay first of all, you don’t apologise for your feelings. Second of all, it's fine, I don’t care. As long as you are happy, I can live without you ever telling me you love me. It's all in the little things, isn’t it?"
“It looks fancy.” He looked excited, like it was a place he actually wanted to be in, so Harry counted that as a small win. He knew Draco wasn’t the same boy he had been in school, but he was still posh and spoilt and so picky, he really did not want to mess it up. “Good choice.”
“So,” Hermione started, “I had someone analyse what you sent me. Nothing wrong on the fur of the unicorn, no traces of weird substances, but it reacted for a high level of dark magic. Like incredibly high.”
“This place meant a lot to all of us, a war is not going to erase the fact that this was our home for seven years. Sometimes it's hard, I’m not going to lie. I find that my nightmares are worse here than they are when I’m home, there are days when I see a burnt spot and everything comes crashing back, and other days when I see a special spot and just remember all the nice things that happened.”
Since he always spent most of his holidays with the Weasleys, he put up a tree but never bothered to decorate it too much. He liked doing it, but he wasn’t the best at it and he had always found Christmas balls too boring and pain.
They reached the door in silence, and started walking on the wet grass, when something caught Harry’s attention. “Stop," he whispered, and stopped in his track. “There is something moving in the forest," he said, noticing Malfoy’s confused face. “Wait here.” He started walking, and rolled his eyes as soon as he heard Malfoy's steps behind him. “Go back.”
“I just thought you'd appreciate it.” He shrugged, making it seem like it was no big deal, when in reality it had almost driven him crazy. How was he supposed to know that there were so many different pyjamas in the world? He just wanted silk, that’s all he knew, why bother him with patterns and colours and this and that. In the end he had spent way too much money, but he had found the perfect one. Dark green, with silver threads and incredibly smooth. “Open it.” He waited, not exactly patiently, for Draco to open it.
“His life.” Suddenly his mouth was on Draco's neck, and he was screaming so loud that some animals ran away.
“Good to know. Next time I’ll come out naked.” He winked and left him there with his mouth half open and his mind imagining Draco's naked body. The fucker.
McGonagall had insisted to go with them, so now they were in seven. Draco was shaking next to him, and he looked pale, but every time Harry looked at him, he just nodded and straightened his back.
“He’s here as moral support,” he protested, sitting on his chair next to Draco. “So, what did they say?”
Draco rolled his eyes, but still placed his own hand over hers. “Don't worry, I just wanted to make sure Harry wasn’t going to get himself killed. As long as he is safe, I won't do anything stupid.”
“I like this job, though. I can, you know, redeem myself. Teach kids it's okay to be different, to be yourself and not follow others, that everyone is deserving of our love and acceptance.”
“Ron usually calls me around eight, what do you want to do in the meantime?” he asked once they were in the safety of his room. He sat down and brought Draco with him, immediately putting his arm over his shoulders to keep him close.
“Maybe.” Hagrid laughed, but became serious immediately after. “So, are you here for a visit in the forest?”
He stayed there for a couple more minutes, just looking at the birds and touching the ones who would let him, then he finally left and went back to his room to prepare their next lesson.
“But she was raised just like you were. That’s what she was taught, what your grandparents wanted for her.”
They parted, slightly breathless, with Draco's hair all over the place and Harry’s shirt half off his shoulder.
“If I know where you are going with this, and I’m pretty sure I do, I beg you not to say anything.” His annoyed expression lasted only a couple of seconds, and he was forced to hide his grin by eating again.
“I’ll ignore the lack of privacy just for the sake of this, but even if it can be modified, do you think it would show this creature?”
They were interrupted just as Harry was pushing Draco on the counter. “Harry? Can we come in?” Ron shouted from the front door. Damn past Harry for giving them a key.
“This better not leave this room, Potter,” he said, because while he was working on it, sometimes he still had a hard time accepting all the love Harry wanted to pour on him. He had started feeling more worthy, he knew he deserved it, but his cheeks still went red any time Harry went over the top with his declarations and he went back to being sarcastic so that he didn’t have to answer.
“So. This must be really weird for you,” Narcissa Malfoy started, leading him into the dining room. The table was right in the middle of the room, with only four places all very far away from each other. It was simply stunning, all white with crystal glasses and beautiful flowers in two twin vases.
“Of course.” He smiled at him and opened the door to his hut. “Good night, Harry, it’s good to have you back.”
“Can I blow you?” he asked, as if he was asking about the weather. Draco had not been joking when he had told him about liking to please and give up control, and while he had told him he was okay with Harry waking him up by touching him, he always wanted to make sure Draco was in the right mood.
They started walking, again, and Harry kept thinking about what Draco had just told him. Having all that power on someone, in such a vulnerable moment. Just the idea was giving him a rush. And to know that Draco actually trusted him enough to let him do it. He really shouldn’t have worried.
“I really want this to work." He cuddled closer to him, and Harry felt his heart missing a couple of beats.
“I’m glad.” He kissed him quickly after making sure Lucius wasn’t looking. “Another ten years and we will have dinner with the Weasleys too.”
“See you.” Draco walked past him, leaving behind a trail of perfume, something like the breeze of the sea, Harry thought distractedly, and he started walking toward the gates, half naked. He was already regretting this.
“I’m gonna ask McGonagall if we can use the pensive tomorrow, I’ll let you know in the morning,” Malfoy told him as soon as they stepped inside the castle.
“You don’t know how to say I love you, but you telling me I’m your family is okay? How do you even work.” And if he hugged him to hide the fact that he was close to tears, well he didn’t have to know. “Whatever happens, I’ll be there,” he whispered. “You can confirm for dinner, but you should know that there is no way we can skip Christmas with the Weasleys, so you better make sure we will be home in time.”
Malfoy was going absolutely crazy, he had been pacing up and down his room for five minutes with his hands in his hair when Harry decided that enough was enough.
“I wasn’t sure myself,” he said, going back to business. He reached her and shook her hand. “But I was curious to hear this proposition you have.” She motioned to the chair and he sat down, trying to relax.
“I don’t know if I can do it. Harry, I’m not good with kids, kids hate me,” he said, looking very much desperate and on the verge of a breakdown.
Draco's mother opened the door, and before they even had the time to put some space between them, she was already hugging her son. “Draco, love, how are you?” she asked, holding his face and checking him.
Draco tensed a little at that, immediately sitting up straighter and trying to look more awake. “Hello, Weasley,” he said, in his usual posh voice that became more intense whenever he was trying to be polite and was really uncomfortable.
“I’m sure you do. But you are quite a famous guest, so,” he said, clearly trying to bite his tongue from making some nasty remarks. Some things never changed. He started walking, and Harry had to take a breath before setting foot inside the castle. “Are you alright?” Malfoy stopped and looked at him, not really worried, maybe more sympathetic. “I know the feeling of coming back for the first time.”
Harry squeezed his leg once, meaning yes, and in less than five seconds Draco was coming inside his mouth, shouting his name and pulling on his hair, harder than Harry would have liked, but he wasn’t going to complain when he boyfriend looked so good.
“That’s exactly why I’m like this, ‘cause I didn’t have it either. I don’t want to leave you wondering how I’m feeling, I will always tell you whatever is going on in my mind.”
“Just because it's you and you were nice tonight, I won't make you carry me to the castle. You’re welcome.”
“Yeah, I always do when I sleep with you.” He had discovered pretty soon that not only was Draco Malfoy a cuddly person, he was also a huge sap first thing in the morning.
“I'd like that.” He smiled at him, his heart still beating way too fast. “And I’d especially like it with you. No Max or Toby, though.”
“Fine. But come back here, I need cuddles and I’m cold. Your bloody dungeons just had to be so cold and humid.”
“I actually came here today to find a place. He said he doesn’t need anything fancy, but I just, I wanna make him feel special, I guess? He’s never had a proper boyfriend before, I want to give him the full experience.”
“God, you are annoying.” She pushed him slightly, and then her eyes settled on Malfoy. He knew she was going to be the hardest one to convince. After they had lost Fred, she had not been able to move on at all, and seeing Malfoy in her home must have been very hard for her. He had thought about warning her, but he wasn’t sure she would have agreed to it. He was going to make it up to her one way or the other. “Hi,” she said, clearly tense.
He had told Draco as much when he had talked shit about his Christmas tree, and the other man had not insisted, but apparently he hadn’t forgotten about that.
“I’m sorry, I’m being very invasive.” He just wanted to know if he had a chance, sue him. The fact that Malfoy was having a breakdown because people were hinting at them being together was telling enough, but he was nothing if not resilient.
“That's okay, this isn’t your job after all.” He tried to sound gentle and calm, he didn’t want to make him feel bad about it, or like he was judging him.
“Of course.” He watched them leave, then he collapsed on his chair and hid his face behind his hands.
“You have all my discretion. I will ask Ron to pick up whatever it is I need to get checked and he will talk about it with Hermione.”
Everyone seemed pretty relaxed, yet very curious. He remembered what it felt like being a student, how scary and intimidating it was, how many times he was made to feel stupid, mainly by Snape, but these students seemed happy to be there. He wouldn’t have minded having a teacher who looked like Draco, that he was sure of.
Draco looked simply beautiful behind his desk, with his platinum hair in a messy bun, the glasses that he only used to read perched on his nose and his black robe that contrasted perfectly with his skin. God, he really wanted to kiss him.
Harry didn’t even notice the time passing, too lost admiring Draco and studying him. He really was amazing with the kids.
“Listen.” He forced him to sit on the counter and he made his way between his legs, leaving his hands on his thighs. “I can’t promise you they will like you, but they know how important you are to me, and they approve of our relationship. They won't mock you, or bring up things from the past. I know you will probably never go book shopping with Hermione or to a bar with Ron, but I have zero doubt you can all be friendly and mature about this. I love all three of you, and I will make sure you all enjoy this dinner. Understood?”
“I know my letter wasn’t very detailed Harry, so I’ll give you some more information. There have been some weird reports coming from the centaurs and Hagrid himself, of animals and other creatures killed in the forbidden forest. We don’t know who it is, surely not a student, so we would like you to give some special lessons on Defence Against the Dark Arts, with the help of professor Malfoy.”
“There you go.” Draco settled the plates on the counter and held one up for Harry to fill with the risotto. It was all so domestic, Harry felt like screaming.
They went back to Draco, who had sat up and had managed to put the carrier on his bed to play with Theodore.
“They like you, you know? I had a dream of my mum hugging you, and my dad smiling, I think that’s a good sign.” He was looking straight ahead, smiling absentmindedly.
The next morning he got the okay from Malfoy, and in the afternoon they decided to meet up and just do it.
“You can tell Harry didn’t set this up,” Hermione said, clearly impressed. “Last time we ate on plastic plates and had paper towels as napkins.”
Just like the night before, the forest felt like a totally different place, except it was even more silent that it used to be. Not even during the war, when Harry was walking to his death, had it felt so silent and creepy. It seemed as if the whole forest was still and quiet, not one single animal was moving, they didn’t dare to.
That must have been the second most embarrassing conversation of his life, the first being telling Mr and Mrs Weasley that Ginny and him had broken up and then them finding out he was bisexual.
He left quickly to go tell Draco what had just happened, but when he arrived in the room, he forgot about everything. Draco was on the sofa, in front of the fireplace, and he was reading a story to Theo, who was sleeping on his lap.
“It's a bit of a mess, to be honest. We’ve heard of a guy who has a pet dragon, but no one seems to be able to find him, which is just ridiculous considering you can’t really miss a dragon flying over your head. We also have another wizard selling potions to muggles, but that happens at least once a month.”
“Everyone. Every time you see a kid looking at you, you look more scared than you did during the war.”
“Okay, good.” He got up from his bed to sit next to him. “So, are we trading secrets? Wanna tell me who your first boyfriend was? Or do you currently have one?”
“Okay, time to go. My baby needs some food.” He basically threw his bag at Harry, and hold the carrier close to his chest. “This is going to be uncomfortable, sweetheart, but we will be home soon.” Harry was doomed. How was he supposed to resist Draco talking to his cat?
“I know.” He sighed and picked at his food. “I was thinking ... I usually give a speech for the Christmas party at the Ministry, would you like to come with me? I want to bring this up, and who better to do it than a teacher?”
“You were.” He didn’t try to hide his smile. “But I know you apologised to Hermione and a lot of other people, it’s enough.”
“Okay I hate to use my famous card, but people listen to me, they trust me, and I trust you. If you tell them what’s going on here, and you show them how deeply you care and that people can change, maybe some of them will go home and tell their kids that not all Slytherins are bad.”
Less than an hour later, Draco was sleeping on his shoulder and his fireplace was coming alive with Ron’s face.
“I wouldn't have asked for your help if I thought you were.” He stopped, close to the forest but still at a safe distance to see anything coming their way. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," he said while pointing his wand at the map. Red lines started forming, and in a couple of seconds the whole Hogwarts was in from of them.
“I didn’t know that. I knew he had apologised to Hermione and other people.” He waited for Hagrid to be distracted and put a biscuit inside the pocket of his hoodie. An old habit of his. He had never managed to eat Hagrid's biscuits, but the last thing he wanted to do was hurt his feelings by not eating anything.
“Kids are like animals: they can smell your fear.” Draco stopped next to him in front of the door. “You don’t need to worry, they are already hanging from your lips.”
“Isn’t it obvious? We don't exactly have a great history with your boyfriend, she was scared something was going to happen and that you’d never come visit again.”
“Malfoy,” he said, remembering where they were. He lowered his wand, and Malfoy did the same. They both turned to look at the students, who were openly gaping at them, and started clapping as soon as they realised it was over. “Ehm, I think we got a bit carried away.” He awkwardly touched his beard, trying to find something to do with his hands.
“Then I’d love to try,” he said, and he was blushing. He looked so pretty like this, with his cheeks red and his hair a bit wild, just like he had looked in school after two hours spent over a cauldron preparing a potion.
“I’ll come," Draco said, sounding very resolute. Harry did not like it, not one bit. “Don’t look at me like that. If you don’t think it's dangerous enough to ask for help then I can come too.”
As soon as they were all seated, a house elf appeared in the room and silently started serving them.
“Hey, there” Harry said, leaning down to kiss his forehead. “Ron’s here, we were talking about having dinner together.”
It still sent a shiver down his spine whenever Draco called him ‘dear’, it made him feel special, loved. He was always so soft and nice when he was talking to him. He obeyed immediately and slowly moved his hand. When he saw that the owl was not opposed to it, he put his hand on his head and slowly petted it, while Draco kept feeding him. “Hello, Max.” The name felt funny in his mouth, but somehow it fit. It was just so ridiculously perfect.
“Okay, now the bad part.” He tried to smile encouragingly at him, knowing very well that at times it took Ron a little push to open up.
“Why does it bother you so much?” he pressed, getting up and putting both hands on his shoulders to stop him. “You said you are out to your parents and friends, right?
“It is, " he agreed. Which, wow. Hermione would have been proud of him. Never in a million years would he have thought to agree on something with Malfoy.
“We will make this work,” he promised, resting his lips against his head and just breathing in the perfume of apples.
“You will not go alone. Do it and I’ll fucking hex you into next year.” Harry really wanted to kiss him and just hold him close, to reassure him that it was going to be fine, that he was trained, but he refrained from doing so in front of his friends.
If it wasn’t that he had been trained to keep calm and collected, he would have jumped at the sudden intrusion.
“You don’t say.” Malfoy got closer and raised his hand. Immediately the hall fell silent. “Alright, pair up and then we will give you some basic instructions,” he said, and Harry could not deny how powerful he looked. He had always known that Malfoy was born to boss people around.
He quickly made some pancakes, trying to make their breakfast as light as possible because he knew Molly was not going to be happy unless everyone had had at least two servings of everything, and then he put them under a charm as to not let them go cold. He then went outside to pick some flowers – it turned out that Draco was, in fact, great with plants – and he set them on the tray.
“Stop it, of course it is..” He stepped back and helped him wear his coat again, then he put on his own and draped a scarf around his neck. “Ready.” He took his hand and squeezed it. “Ready?” he asked softly.
“Do you need help?” he asked, unable to contain his laughter. There was something so incredibly hilarious about wizards using muggle things, especially technology.
He took advantage of that and got closer to Draco to hold his hand. He was still very pale, but his breathing and his pulse were back to normal and his face seemed peaceful, not screwed up in pain like it had been before. The marks on his neck were also disappearing quickly, which Harry hoped was a good sign.
“Yeah? Okay, then.” He turned his head slightly and accioed a book from the table, trying his best not to move Draco too much.
When they arrived at the Great Hall, Harry excused himself, and under Draco's confused gaze he went to the Slytherin table. He immediately recognised the boys from that morning, and he smiled at them. “Can I sit with you for a moment?” he asked, pointing at the empty space in front of them. He could feel a lot of people staring at him, but he didn’t particularly care.
He apparated them in a street close to the restaurant but not as trafficked, and they immediately started walking, hand in hand, for the first time without worrying of who could see them.
“Would you like to come say hi to my parents? I always go on Christmas.” He felt Draco stiffen up behind him, and then he start caressing his stomach again.
“Professor?” one of them asked. He was the shortest one, very small and fragile looking, but he was keeping his head up.
“I feel safe with you, probably more than I ever have in my whole life. Which is quite pathetic now that I think about it, but oh well.”
Suddenly it was nine thirty, and they were still in their little bubble, too wrapped up in each other to care about anything else, so they decided to take a walk. The city was still alive, and it was so weird for both of them, considering all the time they spent in the castle making sure kids were in bed early, but it gave them both a rush. They were no one there, just to people on a date, two adults with no responsibilities for the night. They could be whoever they wanted to be, and no one even cared or noticed them. It was liberating.
“We are working on that, yes. We, well, we kissed yesterday.” He blushed even more at the thought of their first kiss.
“This is nice, we can do this,” he said, and from his voice Harry could tell how tired he was. He had been working so hard on the Map, and on top of that he had to grade papers and work on their lessons together and he always made it his priority to find time for Harry.
They stayed like that for a while, until Harry realised Draco was drifting off so he made them lie down and just hugged him from behind.
“Go with them, I got this,” Ron told him, not that he really needed his authorisation considering he had already decided he was not going to leave Draco's side until he was fine.
The shop only had a couple of costumers inside, it wasn’t exactly the time of the year to get pets, but there were so many of them looking at him. Harry wanted them all. Yes, he was aware that it was a big contradiction to what he had said before, but he liked animals, okay?
“No problem.” She smiled knowingly at him, then lowered he gaze on her cup of tea. “So, I was wondering. Would you be interested in coming here once a week and teach the Duelling club with Draco? You two work really well together, and the students listen to you. Besides, I think you deserve to come and see your cat more often than once a week."
The mere idea of seeing Lucius Malfoy after all those years was rather unpleasant, the fact that he was his boyfriend's father was straight up terrifying. He had tried to convince himself that it was impossible to impress them and get close to them, that all he had to do was be civil and educated, but he was dreading it so much.
“I hate you." He turned around to give him his back, and Draco immediately pressed himself against him. “Please tell me it wasn’t talking about the Weasleys that got you so worked up.”
“I’m sorry, I’m reading too much into this.” He let himself fall dramatically on his sofa and he closed his eyes. “No one would believe there is something going on between us anyway."
Just as Madame Pomfrey was coming back, two healers entered the infirmary, and before he could use his famous card, he found himself in the hallway.
“Hello, there.” Draco smiled at him as soon as the door opened. “How was your day?” he asked, taking his hand and pulling him inside. He sat back on the sofa and picked up a cup of tea, pointing to another one in offering
Harry obeyed immediately, just like he had been taught. Don't wait to see if your partner is right, if they tell you to move, you move. “What did you see?”
“I was at his trial, six years ago. I might have seen him at some party, some funeral, but that’s it.”
“Okay you are going a bit too far, mate. I might find him attractive but that doesn’t mean I wanna marry him. He is hot sure, and we get along, but that's it. Besides, I don’t think he likes me.”
“We were on different sides, that's all. You know, my muggle... relatives, let's call them that, they were racists, homophobes, basically the pure blood of their society with a lot less money. I saw how they shaped their son, how they turned their noses up at classmates they didn't like or talked shit about some of the neighbours, and he grew up to be the same, because that was all he knew. The only reason I didn't turn up that way, is because they hated me more than anyone else. I was different, a freak, I had no family. And yet, at times I still believed them, I still thought ‘oh, maybe I’m better than that person because I have this and they don’t’ and it took time, and a lot of growing, before I realised how stupid it was.”
“It's actually pretty selfish if you think about it. I just really need you and I want you to be safe.”
“Uh, as Mal- Professor Malfoy was saying, these lessons are just a precaution, but you really shouldn’t have to use any of these spells if you are smart enough to stay away from the forest. What we are gonna do is show you a normal and simple duel, then we want you to get into pairs or groups of three and work on disarming each other. Everything's clear?” No one answered, so Harry took it as a yes and turned to Malfoy. “Ready?” he asked.
“Ssh, go back to sleep,” he said, embarrassed. Draco was never going to let him get away with this one. He knew Draco wasn’t the type of person for pet names, but it had just slipped out.
“Oh, c’mon, Potter, keep up.” He smiled at him, always so smug but also with something that looked a lot like fond in his eyes. He had noticed it lately, the way Draco looked at him, like he really, really liked him. He was pretty sure his face was even worse considering he had a harder time hiding his feelings.
“Just because of breakfast? You are going to make my life really easy.” He leaned down to kiss his forehead. “C’mon, before it gets cold.” He climbed over him, careful not to spill their coffees or drop the pancakes, and he sat down with their shoulders pressed together. “Did you sleep well?” he asked, setting the tray on Draco’s legs and keeping the plate for himself.
They kept bickering throughout their whole meal, barely noticing the waiters bringing them food – a tarte tatin with roasted vegetables for Draco and stone bass and pastilla for Harry as their main course, and an apricot and Cointreau for both of them as dessert – and wine.
“Oh. I didn't know that was a problem. We can use mine then, no big deal," she said, smiling gently at Malfoy.
“It's more for the school than for you, Merlin knows I can’t stand a whole year of Draco complaining about missing you.”
Harry wanted to bang his head against the wall. Six years since the battle and this shit was still going on.
“I just- it felt right. I want you to know, just like I want you to know everything about me. You are part of my family now, and I hope one day I can give you what you’ve been missing your whole life.”
“I don't know, it’s just not something I talk about? Nothing personal, I don’t mind telling you, I just never felt the need to? I told Ron and Hermione only because I wanted to explain to them one of the many reasons me and Ginny didn’t work out. I wanted to experiment, to discover this new side of me and just finally be able to settle down with someone I loved.”
“I really think the war changed you for the better. You might not like what you’ve done, but guilt and regret mean you’ve changed, grown. I think you are a good person now, and you deserve to forgive yourself for things you had no control over. Our side killed people too.”
“Of course. We are going to do things properly, I really think we can make this work. Despite our past and what happened between us, I truly believe in us.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, staring at a point over his shoulder as to not meet his eyes. “What else did she say?” he asked, clearly scared she might have revealed too much.
“Please tell me you are joking. He is an Autor and an impulsive person, you are going to get hurt if you have to make sure he is always safe.”
“I really want to kiss you,” he said, and it pained him how much he meant it. Draco just overwhelmed him at times, and the only way to get over it was to kiss him and feel closer to him. Yeah, he was in too deep already.
“I’d love to.” He lifted his head to look at him. “No need for anything fancy, we don’t even need to eat out, maybe just a walk around muggle London?”
“Thank you, and thank you for her,” he said, still looking at the owl. He reached out to touch Theo, and he smiled when he felt him stretch.
“Well, we should probably go see this unicorn, better move it before word reaches the students.” He got up and fixed his robe. “I'll let you know as soon as we find something.”
“Very weird period. But we like it that way.” He shrugged, and when he looked up at Draco he was staring at him with wide eyes and a pained expression. “Excuse me, I better go save my boyfriend.”
He decided to wander around the castle for a bit before going to his room, something he had never really done before after curfew without fearing for his life in case Snape had found him.
“You look cute tonight,” he said, not able to control himself. He just wanted to make him smile, to make him feel appreciated.
“He won't hurt you anymore, I promise you.” He got closer and put his hand on his back. “We don’t have to. I can do this alone to freshen up my memory and then I can finish the Map with Hagrid.”
“I’m not sure, " he lied, because he was there to give them a pep talk, not to let them know he had been so scared of their house that he had begged the hat to not put him in Slytherin. “But it would have been an amazing house. Your own transfiguration teacher was one of you, and he is pretty amazing.” He quickly chanced a glance at Draco, and he gave him a shy smile when he found him already looking.
The weeks went on like this and suddenly it was already November. They worked on the Map together, drank together on Friday nights, prepared their lessons together and delivered said lessons. He had never seen so much of Malfoy in his life, and yet it seemed natural. They were always talking about something, and the best thing was that they were both so open and honest. Malfoy had opened up about his father, what it had been like growing up with him and how scared he had been of disappointing him – while now it seemed like it was his life mission to piss him off -, and Harry told him all about the Dursleys, how they had treated him, what he had had to do and how his cousin had bullied him his whole life. They were so close now he thought not even Ron and Hermione knew all those things about his childhood. And it was weird, so incredibly weird, that Malfoy knew those things about him, but at the same time it had felt natural at the time. He had wanted to tell him, and he had wanted to listen to what Malfoy wanted to share with him.
“Love,” he said, sitting down next to him and touching his long hair. “Wake up, I made you breakfast.”
“Then I don’t have a place there either. Listen, I'm really serious about us, whether we go there as a couple or not, I will support you.”
“Hello, how are you doing?” Hermione asked gently, but her eyes immediately went to Theodore sleeping on his chest. “Who is that?”
Just like that the owl took off, screeching happily and showing off, then he was out and in the sky.
“Is he ok?” Harry asked immediately, ignoring his own nausea. The cat was sleeping, cuddled up on himself, with a cute stuffed animal next to him. “I think I’m in love,” he said, not tearing his eyes away from him.
“Very well, thank you Harry. And you too, Draco. I have to say I’m surprised you two are working so well together, we should have paired you up a lot sooner.”
“I'm spiralling,” he told Draco. Their therapist – yes it was the same after all, they had talked about her – would have been so proud to know he was opening up and sharing his discomfort instead of hiding it.
“I'm glad you like it. I was a bit scared when you said you wanted to take me to a fancy restaurant, because I know that sometimes they have questionable choices, and you really aren’t a posh person.”
“Thank you.” In the corner of his eyes he saw Malfoy relax his shoulders. “So, how’s the Weasley girl?” he asked after a while, and Harry knew it had taken him a lot to ask it, so he decided not to make fun of him. For the time being.
“Oh, shut up, you stalked Malfoy for an entire year. I always wondered how long it was going to take you to realise you fancied him.”
“Harry please, all these compliments in one night are going to my head.” He didn’t sound annoyed, but he did look a bit uncertain, clearly all of Harry's doubts were starting to get to him.
“I am, yes. Malfoy and I went in yesterday evening ‘cause I saw something moving, but we didn’t find anything.”
“Okay, as adorable as this is, I need you to get up.” He sat down next to them and started petting both of their heads. What was his life, honestly.
“It’s okay, really, it’s just because we’ve just finished dinner.” He cuddled closer to him and closed his eyes. He didn’t even care about the view on the Thames and the whole city below them, he just wanted to enjoy Draco’s company.
They separated right as the shop assistant came back with a carrier for the cat, bowls, brushes, food, a litter box and sand to put inside. “This should be it,” he said, looking very happy.
“No, but I know you.” He sat up as well, bringing Theodore with him and holding him in his arms. “And I know how you show people you care.”
“Granger,” he replied. He was trying his best, he really was, but his shoulder had tensed up and he looked more serious than he had a couple of minutes before.
“Here.” He sat down and moved the chair next to his for Malfoy, who sat down quickly and moved even closer.
“It could be if you are up for it. Listen, I think I made it pretty clear, I want stability, I’m in this for the long run, so either you run away now, or I’ll try and keep you for as long as possible.”
“Professor.” He sat down and took the cup she offered him. “Thank you.” For some reason, she always had tea ready. Didn’t matter the temperature or the time of the day, if you went to her office you were going to drink tea.
“Image wise, maybe, but not for my personal needs. I wanted to settle down, to feel at peace for once in my life and get the family I always wanted and needed, Ginny wanted to explore, try new things, live at the fullest.”
“In the forest. We were thinking about putting together our memories to form a complete map,” Hermione said immediately. Harry knew she didn’t like lying to Ron, but he was very grateful she had done it just this time.
Harry’s eyes were so wide it must have been painful. “You said it.” He was staring at him, his lips parted.
“You got a cat?” Ron looked shocked, as if that was the most absurd thing in the world. Maybe it was.
“Well that ended pretty well, didn’t it?” He smiled at him and put a lock of his hair behind his ear. “I like you. I don’t know where this will take us, but no one is stopping us from just trying.”
“I'll be careful,” he said, for the first time ever using a very gentle and careful tone with him. “Shall we see what we can find?”
“Well this is useless. Mischief managed.” He closed the map and started walking closer to the forest, scanning it, looking for the white eyes of the other night. “Have you ever seen or heard anything suspicious before?”
They walked for over fifteen minutes, then they stopped to check the Map. Rowle’s dot had moved slightly, getting closer to them. They couldn’t be more than ten minutes away from him. He turned quickly to check on Draco, then he started walking again.
Draco just smiled at that, and leaned closer to kiss his cheek. “Thank you, you are not too bad either.”
“Babe,” he said, giving in once again. Fuck Draco Malfoy, honestly. What was he doing to him? He reached out again to touch his cheek. “You and your cat look really cute together,” he simply said, moving his hand from him to the furry ball in his hands. The cat seemed very peaceful, not the beast the guy had made him out to be. And he knew cats were little shits who tricked you, but he had no doubt that Draco was going to give this little cat all his love anyway. “Should we go back to the castle straight away? So he can settle in?”
“Oh Merlin, I don’t even know where to start.” Had he not been in a fancy place, he would have dramatically rested his head on the table.
“Of course, we will talk more next week.” He smiled happily at them and left, joining his wife on the sofa.
“It does” he said, disappointed “I can't even see us. But look, a couple of students are in the kitchens.”
“When are you leaving?” Draco asked after a couple of minutes of silence, broken only by their cat purring loudly.
“Well that must have been quite the scene to walk into,” Harry said to break the silence while they were walking to Malfoy’s study.
“I already told you why. You are a loving and nice human being, who is patient and lovely to his students, who got a cat just to help me overcome my stupid fears, who came in the forest even though you were scared just to make sure I wasn’t going to get myself killed. You are a good person, Draco, and you deserve love. Mine, Theodore's, whoever you want. And if you don’t want to believe me, I will just try my best every day to make you feel loved, sounds good? Are you ready for some of the sappiest letters ever written?”
“What a stupid fucking question,” he muttered, reaching out to touch his cheek. “Kiss first,” he demanded, puckering his lips.
“You are here despite the fact that you are clearly uncomfortable, it means a lot.” He finally turned his head to look at him, still smiling softly.
“As long as you are happy and he is not a dickhead. I haven’t seen you like this... never, really. Maybe it was because there was a lot going on, but you never looked this happy with Ginny. You looked in love, maybe, but not like this. It's like you are always giddy and finally ready to live life at the fullest. You know what I mean?”
“Okay then.” He put his memory in the pensive, and just before his face hit the surface, he felt Malfoy's hand slipping into his.
“Thanks for telling me.” He smiled at him and quickly leaned forward to kiss him. “I won’t let you run away, don’t worry about that.”
“I’ve never had this before. I’m almost excited to experience a big Christmas dinner with people who actually enjoy celebrating and are happy to just be together.”
“Not really, no. I’ve felt... as if someone was watching me though, when I go to Hagrid's. I could feel something lurking, but I always thought it was some of the usual animals.”
Harry took off the cloak and got closer to the desk. “I didn’t want to listen to that, I just couldn’t leave.”
“What?” He looked at him for a second, then lowered his gaze on his arm. “Oh.” He immediately stopped stroking his arm, and let it fall to his side. “It used to, at the beginning, but after
Harry looked one last time at the forest, then he caught up with Malfoy. “Are you okay? What happened?” he asked.
Harry could see from his shoulders how tense Malfoy was. He looked a bit pale, and very nervous, but he was nothing if not determined.
“Oh, please.” He took his hand, and really, how was Harry supposed to deny him anything when he was looking at him like that and touching him.
“Can we not?” he asked in a whisper. He looked pale again, and he couldn’t lift his head to meet Harry's eyes.
“We are.” He made a disgusted face, but Harry didn’t buy it for even a second. “Okay, second one." He unwrapped the second gift, a slightly bigger box, still in the same paper and box. “Harry,” he said, his voice going higher and his cheeks going red. They had briefly talked about sex toys, and they had taken into consideration the idea to visit a shop in muggle London, but they had never been able to find the time, so Harry had channelled his inner Gryffindor and he had gone alone just to buy him some nipple clamps connected by a chain.
“I’m worried you won't enjoy it,” he said, not able to take his eyes away from Draco buttoning up his cuffs for him. That was so domestic and exactly what he wanted.
“Don’t say that, they are your family.” He took the hand that was on his chest and kissed it lightly. His stupid obsession with his hands was going out of control.
“Eh? Oh, right.” He quickly changed to muggle clothes, and together they left the shop to wander around and look for a coffee shop.
“No, apparently Draco’s had a crush on me for quite a long time, he was never really interested in Blaise.” He tried to ignore the fact that he could feel his cheeks heating up.
“And you are wrong. Everyone thinks we are good together. You know who made me realise you might have liked me? Ginny, my ex, and all of her family agreed. Hermione likes you, McGonagall basically told me you were pining after me. All of those people think you are good for me, and most importantly I think you are good for me.”
“I know. I hate that we are still living in a world were people hate on a specific category. Muggles, half bloods, now a house. It's so stupid.”
“Sit down, Harry, I don’t need you to pass out as well.” With a flick of her wand a chair came straight from her office to him, and he sat down obediently. “I’m going to give him a general antidote just in case, but I will consult with the other healers as soon as they get here.”
“Go fuck yourself, Potter.” He lost all of his venom one second after, when he leaned in to kiss him.
“Thank you.” He waited for her to separate them from the rest of the room, then he left Theodore's carrier on the chair and he settled down next to Draco, who stirred in his sleep to hold him but didn’t wake up. As soon as his head hit the pillow, he was asleep as well.
“Draco, calm down.” He got closer, and when he realised that Malfoy was not going to hex him for even thinking about doing it, he hugged him. Malfoy was taller than him, but he felt incredibly small in his arms. He was shaking and struggling to breathe, his hands were clenched in Harry’s robe and his head hidden against his neck. “He won’t hurt you, he’s not here anymore. And even if he was, I’d protect you.” He started rubbing his back. He was doing so well, up until the moment Voldemort had failed once again to kill him, he was clearly nervous but nothing major.
“They don’t want to believe us, they are too scared it might actually be something bad,” Malfoy answered before Harry got the chance to. “We wrote several letters, McGonagall even had a couple of fire calls with the Aurors, but they say it’s probably just a wild animal gone mad and that he will be dead in no time.”
“Well this might take a while, I’ll show you the papers Robards gave me for you,” Ron said, interrupting his thoughts.
“It's good to be back.” He was surprised by how much he meant it. Just the day before he was panicking while standing in front of the gates, but he had soon realised that nothing could ruin this place for him. Sure, he still had traumas that were never going to leave him and some days were going to be worse than others, but at the end of the day not one single place was like Hogwarts. Going around the school, eating good food, spending time with Hagrid, he had so many good memories about all of these things.
He looked at his boyfriend to make sure it was okay to talk about it, and when he got his aapproval, he went back to facing his parents. “Well, there really isn’t much to say. We managed to find the witch who had turned Rowle into an inferius, she told us she simply wanted to try, but she probably turned him too quickly after his death or messed something up, so he managed to save a bit of his conscience and after a while he stopped obeying her. When he got dangerous she somehow managed to bring him into the forest and just left him there, where he started killing animals to try and come back to life, I guess? It would never have worked, he just had this notion that unicorn blood helps, and so he tried.”
“Deep breaths, slow and steady.” He reached out again, and because neither of them were part of the memory, he actually managed to touch him and grab his hand. “Come.”
“It smells amazing in here.” Draco came up behind him and wrapped him in his arms, resting his chin on his shoulder. “We need to do this more often.”
“There is nothing going on between us. We are just... friends? Maybe not even that. We talk a lot, though, we’ve been through similar things, we understand each other.”
“I mean, uh, date? For now? Like momentarily, until we make things official. If you want to, of course.”
“Yes, sir,” one of them said. Ron loved new Aurors so much, it was his favourite time of the year when they came out of training and started working with them.
After another check-up, and a long scolding about keeping an animal loose in the infirmary, they finally managed to go back to Draco's room and spend their last hours together.
“Yeah, he’s great at that." He smiled looking down at his hands, sure that he was probably looking like a fool with a crush. “He just gets me in a way no one ever has. I know everyone lost friends and family, but with the war he lost himself too, just like I did. He wasn’t Draco Malfoy anymore, he was Draco Malfoy the Death Eater, just like I was some sort of hero. And before that, we both had to live up to impossible standards, we were indoctrinated and made to believe things that weren’t true.”
“Last time we saw him his dot was here,” Draco said, pointing almost in the middle of the forest, or well, the forest they knew. It went so much farther than that, but hopefully whatever they were looking for never went too far. “We noticed it because it kept going back and forth. There must be some sort of path there.”
They tried to change subject after that, and started talking about Ginny’s practice and their various job, until the last plate was empty and everyone had had at least two servings of cake.
“In the kitchen,” he shouted back, moving away from his boyfriend as to not be tempted to send his friends away and spend the night snogging him senseless. That was a really good idea, actually. No, he was mature and a good host.
“That would he brilliant. I think the best thing to do is put first and second years together, ‘cause they are still very inexperienced. Third and fourth years together and then fifth, sixth and seventh. What do you think?”
“They are my family.” He smiled at Draco, happy that he had said yes. “Thank you, it really means a lot.”
The students immediately started practicing, and both him and Malfoy left their little stage to check on the them. Harry could feel their eyes on his back, but so far no one had dared stopping him. Malfoy, on the other hand, had been stopped a couple times, and something in the way he talked to the kids, how he looked so calm and patient compared to the Malfoy he used to know, made him feel... almost happy. It was a weird feeling, but he was happy for him, almost proud. He knew that after the trial things had been hard for the Malfoy family, and a weird, troubled part of his brain had been worried for him, but now that he knew he was doing well, he felt better.
“Practically married then.” He got closer just to kiss his cheek. “In all seriousness, you don’t need to worry. Hermione is rather diplomatic, and I’ve already talked about you with Ron, he knows I really like you.”
“Okay, she was married and she wants you to settle down, what else?” He asked, taking another bite of his meal. He was eating so much slower than he usually would, but he was scared of looking like an idiot and he actually wanted to enjoy it. Especially considering how much it was going to cost him.
“I had a talk with McGonagall,” he started, nervous all of a sudden. “Fuck, not here.” He took his hand and started dragging him toward the greenhouses.
“Well, I had a part of Voldemort inside of me, when I died and that part disappeared, I lost the ability to talk with snakes.” He noticed Malfoy shuddering at the mention of Voldemort, but he didn't point it out. He knew Malfoy had done what he had to in order to protect his family, he remembered very vividly what he had looked like in sixth year, how scared he was, how much weight he had lost and how little sleep he was getting. Sure, Malfoy wasn't the best person in the world, he had done some very horrible things even before that, but Harry knew that what he had done in sixth year wasn’t his doing.
Draco just looked at him with a weird expression, which he managed to wipe away with a quick kiss. “I’m sorry, I’m just really happy about this dinner.”
“Okay, whatever you want.” He kissed the top of his head and rested his own against him. “It’s beautiful up here,” he said in a whisper after a couple of minutes spent in silence.
He woke up earlier than usual, and managed to sneak out of the bed and away from Draco’s tight embrace. He quickly wore his dressing gown – despite himself, he had to admit that Draco was right and it was very useful –, and made his way downstairs. They were not expected at the Weasleys’ at least until midday, which gave him enough time to make Draco breakfast, hopefully wake him up with a blowjob, and then exchange some gifts. He had gotten him five, because Draco had threatened to cut his dick if he even dared to buy him something else, so he had decided to only take three with them at the Burrow and leave the more special ones at home.
“That must have been fun.” He sounded almost chocked up, as if talking about Voldemort was still too much after six years.
“More than okayq.” He smiled to himself, feeling so incredibly happy and warm inside. He knew it was not like saying they were together, but knowing that Draco was at least willing to be seen with him made him feel really hopeful for their future.
“Of course,” he said, and his inner eleven-year-old started freaking out immediately. God, he hated that feeling.
“Of course.” He looked at him quickly, to make sure he was ok. “Your mum was there as well, do you think that’s going to help?”
“As you said, he does have a brilliant mind. I was scared at first, not only because I didn’t know his intentions, but also of the reaction of some parents, but the kids just like him so much. Have you ever been to one of his lessons?”
He was getting more nervous as the time went by, but for the first time he wasn’t scared about himself. What if the guy wasn’t a ghost? What if he was going to recognise Draco and attack him? Harry had no idea what he would have done at that point. He didn’t want to screw up, but he was ready to if it meant saving him. And that’s why they tell you to never mix work and feelings.
“Why don’t you tell me?” He moved away from behind the desk and recovered a bottle of perfume. “Smell it, tell me what it reminds you of.”
It wasn’t until dessert – a panna cotta with wild berries – that Ron remembered to bring up Harry’s case.
“Now rest, both of you. The headmistress will arrive soon, she wants to talk with you.” She left before they could even answer.
They stayed in silence for another ten minutes, occasionally kissing but overall just enjoying the view and each other’s presence, then they heard the clock signalling ten and they decided to head back to the castle.
“Of course, I want to see you as much as possible, but are you sure you can keep up with everything? I don’t want you to be overworked and that being here is going to be too much and make you hate every minute of it.”
He spent his afternoon going around London, looking at all the restaurants Hermione had recommended, and he eventually settled on
He shook his head, for some reason endeared by their banter. He never thought he would see the day in which their bickering was just that, no hard feelings, or at least not explicit ones. He didn’t really hold any grudge against him, he had despised him for so long in school, that once it was all over, he had no strength to keep it up. Draco had fucked up, but so had so many other people, not even Dumbledore had been the person he always thought he was, but that didn’t make him love and admire him any less. He didn’t see the point in arguing with Malfoy when they could be at least friendly.
“Sounds like a plan.” He opened his arms, and Draco immediately fell into him. “I’m proud of you,” he said softly, his mouth almost pressed against Draco’s soft hair.
Ron and Hermione entered the room quickly, smiling brightly as always. “Hello,” Hermione said. She quickly reached Harry to give him a hug, then turned to Draco to shake his hand politely. “Malfoy,” she said, still sounding friendly.
“I’m taking you out more often,” he said after he had swallowed his first bite. He had manners, thank you very much.
Malfoy literally chocked on his own spit, and Harry was forced to pat him on the back. “What the fuck,” he said, now rubbing his back.
“Next time I’ll wake you up,” he promised, not falling for Draco’s attempt at changing the subject. “Anything else I should know about you? I want to help you, not out of pity or because I have a hero complex, I just really care about you, and I want you to feel safe, around me and even when I’m not there.”
“I do. A lot actually, so if you could please just-" For probably the first time in his life, Draco actually listened to him. He closed the distance between them and held on tight to his sweater, while Harry brought his hands up to his neck and toyed with the strands of hair that had escaped his bun. Their first kiss was pretty innocent, no tongue or uncomfortable scraping of teeth, but it still left Harry feeling breathless. It felt like it had been a long time coming, and they both were desperate to keep it going as long as possible and just stay in the moment forever.
“Right, you have a point.” He closed his eyes and reclined his head. He had never met the parents of anyone before. He had known the Weasleys for years before being introduced as Ginny's boyfriend, and it had all been so easy.
“Perfect, port key to Italy next week, I’ll use my Auror card just for you, don’t even argue with me.”
A couple of hands raised, and when Harry looked at Malfoy, he picked a girl who was closest to them.
“Alright then. Be more carful next time, I’m sure Harry can handle it alone, you don’t have to go back to those things.”
“Okay, just a tiny bit then.” He relaxed his grip just enough to let him move, but even then, Malfoy stayed with his head hidden against his neck. “There you go.” Without thinking about where they were and who was watching, he turned his head to bury his nose in Malfoy’s hair. Fucking hell, he just had to smell like apples didn’t he. Great.
“I don’t care, I’m just so happy right now.” He let go once again, and Draco was relieved to see how big he was smiling now.
“Are you jealous?” He couldn’t even contain his smile at that. He looked like a kid at Christmas, or even better, the whole fucking tree lit up.
“We should go back inside, your nose is getting red.” He bopped his nose and immediately felt how cold it was. “Let’s go, I have some cuddling to do."
“Glad to hear that since I’ll have to work with him. Hope we won't be at each other's throat too much," he said, scared of what could happen once they were alone.
“Of course.” He smiled softly at him, and they quickly made their way downstairs, leaving a very disgruntled kitten on their bed.
“Don't lose your mind over this. Mine was just an idea, nothing more. It's completely up to you,” he said, noticing how Draco had tensed up at the idea. He really wasn’t good at hiding his bad feelings. Smiles and being happy? He was great at not showing that, but when he was upset it was written all over his face and Harry really couldn’t stand to see him like that.
“That’s why story repeats itself, though. People need to know, they need to know what happens when they trust someone like him, don't you think?”
“I’ve never seen Hagrid so scared, it's not like him to forbid Fang from coming with us. I would ask another professor, but since you are already here... it won't take long.”
had its hand wrapped around Draco's neck. It was hard to see, but it looked very thin and all white and slimy, with those empty eyes he had seen from the grounds. And then it clicked.
“That sounds good.” He smiled at her, really happy about the turn that had taken. “Thank you, really.”
They started following young Harry, and had it not been that he was so worried about Malfoy, he knew he would have lost his mind the second he had stepped foot inside that memory. “This is gonna take a while, I didn’t really know what path I was taking.”
“It does, it’s more you.” He rested his chin in his shoulder, and Harry brought his hands up to cover Draco’s.
“Of course. I begged Lucius to be polite tonight, I really hope you won’t hate it too much.”  She pointed at the chair in the middle, and he immediately sat down, glad he was going to have Draco sitting right in front of him.
“This is the worst thing you’ve ever done,” he said, not able to stay serious. “Also, dad Harry doesn’t work, what about papa?”
“Do you really want to talk about these things with me?” he asked, surprised, unable to make sense of what was happening.
“This is where I found the unicorn," Hagrid said after ten minutes, stopping in a clear spot between the trees.
“Well yes, but also I can’t imagine he would want to see his father again if he treats you poorly. You should see what he writes about you in his letters. I really want to thank you for being so nice to him.” He never would have expected to see Narcissa Malfoy smile like that at him, it was almost unsettling.
Ever since he had started celebrating it with Ron and his family, Christmas had quickly become his favourite holiday. It was always filled with so much happiness and quality time with his loved ones, and he enjoyed spoiling his friends more than anything in the world.
“Stop it, you are a good person.” He scratched lightly behind his ear, and Draco immediately started rubbing his head against him. “And also a very cuddly one.”
“To where? I would have died and killed for my family, and you would have done the same. We are not so different.”
“I really don't care about what we are doing, I just want to be alone with you and be able to hold your hand in public. Besides, the fact that you are taking me to a place with a dressing code is already promising. And French food is always appreciated.”
The next day Harry was bored. Not just bored, he was lonely. He had spent the evening before with Draco cuddled up against his side, his head resting against his shoulder and his whole body melted against his. They had cuddled until midnight, then Harry had decided to go back to his room, where he had regretted his decision because he was cold and he missed him already. Okay maybe he was a sap, so what.
“I see," he said, trying to sound as understanding as possible, because he did, he understood. “You know, it took me some time as well when I started working. Sometimes you see dead people, it's part of the job, and the first couple times I just had to leave.”
“I'll fire-call you tonight, okay?” Harry promised, holding both of his hands. “And we will see each other Saturday morning.”
“Precisely,” she said, not bothered by Harry sounding on the verge of a breakdown. “You could also just stay here, you know? To investigate in the morning.”
He put the bell peppers on the heated pan and went back to check on his risotto. His roast was cooking in the oven, and his zucchini were almost ready as well.
“Disgusting.” He fake-gagged, because apparently he couldn’t handle serious conversations for more than five minutes without his brain short circuiting.
Harry laughed at that. He could imagine adult Malfoy shaking a little in front of the gargoyle, readying himself to be scolded for something he hadn't even done.
“What do you need to buy?” They were almost there, so they weren’t holding hands anymore, which only made Harry clingier and more annoying because he wanted Draco’s attention and especially because he wanted to distract him.
All the students stopped working and immediately grouped up like they had been instructed to, to go to their dormitories.
The following night was Draco's turn to be a nervous wreck. It wasn’t obvious to anyone else, but Harry could see and sense it. His legs weren’t bouncing up and down, his hands weren’t shaking, but his jaw was clenched and his eyes kept looking for Harry’s while they were cooking. Okay, Harry was cooking, Draco was sipping wine and pretending to cut vegetables. Useless, completely useless, but at least he was pretty to look at, much better than his old house elf. His energy also felt off. He couldn’t explain why, but he always felt a weird buzz under his skin when he was with Draco, and right now his skin felt very itchy.
“And the point is? Do you think I care about their opinion? I spent my whole life trying to please them, doing whatever they wanted because I thought they would love me more, now I just want to do whatever makes me happy. I don’t depend on them anymore, I have a job, my own apartment, I have a cat, they can cut me off whenever they want.”
“Everyone, lunch is ready,” Molly shouted, and all of a sudden people were running from the other rooms and the kitchen was so noisy he could barely hear anything.
“So, what can I do for you?” she asked, her tone always very stern, but her soft smile betraying her.
He stayed there for a while, just enjoying the warmth of Draco cuddling him, then he realised they needed to get up soon if they didn’t want to miss breakfast and Draco’s first class.
“I was cruel,” he said, and it was visible how difficult it was for him to admit it. It looked like he’d rather have jumped down from the stairs than have that conversation with him. He couldn’t agree more.
“Potter, you useless idiot,” he said, clearly too loudly, because some heads turned to stare at them and suddenly a group of girls were giggling. They were fucking giggling because of them bickering. “Fucking hell," Malfoy muttered. “What are we gonna do?”
“Did you have any other choice? Because I know I didn't. It was a war, Malfoy, some fight for what they believe in, others fight to stay alive, and it's valid. You got caught up in the middle of something that was bigger than you.”
He finally made his way upstairs and he was relieved when he found Draco still fast asleep, with his mouth hanging open and his hair in his mouth. He smiled to himself and left the tray on his nightstand, then he sat down on the bed and brought a hand to his face to move the hair away. He took his time just looking at him and gently touching his face, just taking him in and thanking whoever had made it possible for Draco to become his boyfriend.
He sat next to him and warmed his hand with the cup, trying to buy himself some time. Why he was freaking out all of a sudden, he had no idea. “Great, I found the wizard who was selling stuff to muggles, I had coffee with Ron, and I found the perfect place for our date. How was your day?”
“That’s not what I mean. I’m just worried that our personalities won't match in bed.” He got even closer to him to the kiss tip of his nose and he started caressing his neck with his knuckles. “I’m sorry I’m being so paranoid, I don’t know why I'm suddenly scared of having sex with someone.”
“That I am.” He looked down at his phone vibrating. “How has she answered already? Is there a thing that woman can’t do?” He opened the text and showed the names of the various restaurants to Harry. “She says I can send this text to you but I forgot how.”
“No one has been hurt or offended so far, so I guess we could say it's going fine," his father said, leaning back and reaching for a glass of whiskey.
“Here are your menus, if you have any question don’t hesitate to ask.” He bowed slightly and left them alone to decide.
“Nothing to be sorry about, I just want to see you happy and comfortable.” He kissed his forehead and went back to cooking his risotto with mushrooms. “Now please be a dear and slice up my bell peppers. Cut them in half, remove the seeds and the white parts, then slice them.”
“Yeah, maybe I should. I know she would understand, but she was so happy at the idea, I don’t want to let her down.” He started toying with his cup, making Harry flinch every time he held it with one finger. Ron was a real mess when he was nervous, he could have dropped even the stickiest thing in the world.
“I can’t say seeing you two hugging made me feel better about the whole situation.” He smiled sadly at that, almost a bit self-deprecating. “But I know you two will always be friends.”
“It's just over the corner,” the other girl said, “turn right and then go to the end of the street, you can’t miss it.”
“I know, so try not to die and leave me alone with him.” He put his hand over Harry’s and smiled at him.
“They would be proud of them man you’ve become,” he said, unsure if it was something Harry would appreciate hearing.
“I know, but I was so scared. I need to be close to you now. Is it alright?” he asked, already laying down to be more comfortable.
“It’s for the thing I’m doing at Hogwarts. I thought Malfoy could talk about some things with Hermione and since she is always so busy, I invited him. I hope it’s okay.”
“Well yeah, we’ve been a couple for a week.” He pulled away and tried to hide his embarrassment. He really had fallen quite fast for him.
“It's a corrosive plant, it can burn the skin. Let me see if you have any weird bubbles.” He lighted up his wand and brought it closer to Malfoys’ chest. There were no bubbles on his chest, but he noticed white scars, running all over his chest, coming very close to his neck. “Did I-“ He looked up, feeling nauseous, and found Malfoy looking at him with red cheeks and an embarrassed expression. “Did I do this to you?”
“Harry," said Hagrid, clearly excited to see him. It had been almost a month since the last time they had seen each other.
“Draco please, talk to me," he said, circling his shoulder with an arm to stop his shaking. “Love, please.”
“You too.” He pressed a kiss against his cheek, not really caring who was looking at them. “Ready?” He looked behind himself, to check that everyone was where they were supposed to be. Behind him stood one of the new Aurors, Tom, then Draco, McGonagall, the other Auror Mark, and Ron and Hagrid in the back. He started walking, keeping the Map at his side and the wand ready. The forest was thick and dark, but some light still managed to get through, so they had decided to light up their torches only if needed, to draw as little attention as possible.
am adopting a cat. You are just dad’s boyfriend, until you are one hundred percent sure you want a pet, he is mine.” He took the kitten from his hand.
“I can’t believe you just said that,” he said, not able to contain his laughter. “Remember that I can’t speak with snakes anymore, don’t throw one at me.”
As expected Robards wasn’t happy with his decision. He had been screaming at Harry for ten minutes when he decided that enough was enough.
“Okay so, the spell is the Homonculous Charm. The word homunculus refers to a human or humanoid, so I guess you weren’t too far off when you said it probably catches on to free will and stuff like that. Now. It's really hard to see the dots and names in the forbidden forest, mainly because it’s too intricate, but I was able to find something. There are a couple centaurs here and there, and I think I saw an acromantula.”
“And the colour of your mum’s hair. I bet he was a sap like you.” He poked his cheek, just trying to make his presence known however he could.
“No, she gave me a couple of names. We will try them all out, don’t worry,” he added, noticing how he had perked up at the mention of several fancy restaurants.
“You were attacked, you lost consciousness on the way here.” His voice was more flat now, just the thought of what had happened too much to stomach.
And then in a couple of seconds it was over. Voldemort just pointed his wand at him and shouted an Avada Kedavra.
“You tell me. I’ve been working here for two years and I still think she’s gonna put me in detention every time she asks for me.”
“Very funny, Ron,” she said, rolling her eyes. Hermione was brilliant, he would never tire of saying it, but she couldn’t cook to save her life. She tried, she really did, and she was alright at very basic things, but Ron was the cook in their house. Years spent helping Molly in the kitchen really paid off.
“This is so great. Why don’t you go show Hagrid while I tell McGonagall you made some great discoveries?”
Harry looked up at him, and moved one hand to his left nipple, just pinching it and rubbing it between his fingers.
“If you say so.” He finally lifted his head to look him in the eyes. “You look amazing, have I told you already?”
He went straight to Draco’s room, feeling rather nervous for some reason. He knocked, and waited patiently for Draco to let him in.
“We have them all," he said, out of breath, holding his side with one hand and waving the Map with the other.
“Like? Have you thought about this often?” And he was back again to being a little shit and flirting. Good, right headspace Harry. He let his free hand go from Draco's neck to his hip.
“We need to leave, c’mon.” He started walking faster, and stopped only when they reached the grass around the castle, barely lightened by the little sunlight left.
“I think so, yeah. I enjoyed going around with you so much, I just want to be able to do it whenever and wherever we want.”
“Okay, stop it. We are talking about kids being in danger. I’ll go there whether you want it or not. What are you going to do, fire me?” he challenged.
“Do you want it too?” he asked, very careful not to put too much pressure on him. “Because it's fine if you don't, I mean I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to see me, but it’s fine.”
From there their perfect plan went to shit. They had planned every detail of the lesson, but somehow, they found themselves casting spells and shields so fast and at times nonverbally, that none of the student even had the time to understand what was going on. And the worst thing was that it was fun. Malfoy was good, Harry already knew that, but it had been a while since he had had the chance to duel with someone who was on the same level as him and was not scared to use his full powers because he was The Boy Who Lived. Malfoy didn’t care, and perhaps he was the only one. Even his friends had treated him differently at first, Hermione too scared to make him snap by unintentionally mentioning something, Ron was still feeling guilty because of what had happened in the forest, and even Ginny couldn’t help but always worry about him.
“That was my plan, dear.” Yeah so he was failing miserably at the whole pet names thing, but Draco had not complained once.
“Babe, can you pass me the bell peppers?” he asked, and now he was calling Draco ‘babe’ casually, just because he could and because it made him blush slightly. Turns out he wasn’t that against pet names.
“It's okay, it’s in the past. We’ve all done things we regret, haven’t we?” He absentmindedly started to touch his left forearm, right where the mark was.
Malfoy simply rolled his eyes, even though Harry was pretty sure he could see him trying to hold back a smile, while McGonagall simply shook her head, amused.
Harry just laughed at that, endeared by his boy. He sank more into him, enjoying Draco’s warmth and strong grip around his waist.
“Theodore is nice,” Harry said, smiling to himself. Draco and his posh names. Who the fuck calls a cat Theodore?
“Babe?” He sat down next to him, on his side of the bed. Draco was already under the blanket, cuddled on himself. “Draco, I know It's hard, but you have to trust me.” He settled down next to him, hugging him until there was no space between them.
“I think it was probably like having him in your house. Unpredictable, sometimes he showed up and took over all my attention, sometimes he disappeared for days.”
“And you are okay with it?” Hermione asked, very cautiously. She knew how much he had struggled after Hedwig, they all did, and all of them had tried to convince him to get a new pet and not deprive himself of that special bond.
“Yes, I’m sure. Besides, I’m going to be lonely once you leave.” He pouted, a full-on pout on his lips, and he lifted the cat next to his face.
He could feel his own magic getting restless, escaping his control more and more as time went by. It was clear that that wasn’t a normal inferius, otherwise Draco would have been dead already.
“I’m not, I’m just sad, I guess. I can’t even imagine what you went through, I just want to make you happy. You only deserve the best.”
He walked back to infirmary, much slower this time, and he wasn’t surprised at all when Madame Pomfrey threatened to cut his head if he tried to free ‘the beast’ inside her infirmary.
“Hagrid has found another dead animal,” she said, looking very tired and also a bit scared. “Another unicorn, a young one. I asked him to bring the body out of the forest, it's currently in one of the greenhouses, so that the students won’t be able see it.”
They finally reached their table and Harry sat next to Malfoy, at the left edge. He leaned forward to wave at Hagrid, and then sat back to look at the Great Hall. He immediately regretted it when he saw all those eyes on him. It wasn't exactly new, but it didn’t make it any less weird or uncomfortable.
“Alright then. I want you all there at ten on Monday, so the kids are all in class and safe. I’ll let McGonagall know tomorrow morning.”
He simply nodded and walked away, leaving Harry to admire his back and the way his trousers covered his arse. Okay, maybe he liked him a bit, so what? Malfoy was fit, big deal.
“Would anyone like coffee?” Narcissa asked, interrupting them when it looked like her husband was going to explode.
If he wasn’t sure about it before, he sure as hell was now. Malfoy was a completely different person. He truly regretted what he had done, and he was trying to make things better, not just to protect his conscience, but because he knew it was the right thing to do. He was no saint, far from it, and things between them were probably never going to change, but now he knew he could somewhat trust him.
Draco cleared his throat way too loudly and got off his legs and back on the bed. “Do you think we could ask your friends to look after Theo?”
“Everything will be fine, I promise you.” He forced him away from the litter box and helped him stand. “Trust me, okay?” He hugged him, relieved when Draco just went with it and kissed his neck. “I have a kid now, I need to take care of him.”
“No, it's not that, I love teaching with you and I love having you here. I don’t know what I was worrying about, I’m sorry.”
“This is what helped me keep up with you in sixth year. It’s called the Marauder's Map, it was created by my dad and his friends. It allows you to see everyone in the school right now, I was wondering if maybe we could push our luck and see if it can be extended to the forest too.”
“Anything for you.” He pinched his cheek, then he got up before Draco could get his revenge. “What do you say we get out of here and ask the elves to make us something to eat in bed?”
“Fuck, I hate you so much at times.” He covered his face, embarrassed, and Harry took advantage of the fact that he wasn’t looking to take him in his mouth, immediately bobbing his head quickly. “Shit,” Draco almost screamed, his hand tightening in his hair. “Harry,” he moaned, softer that expected given the situation.
“We've all been where?” Ron asked, while he was levitating the small but very heavy pensive inside the room.
“You think they heard a word I said?” Malfoy asked him in a whisper, sounding way less pissed that Harry would have expected.
“About?” Draco stopped and leaned against a tree. He tugged him closer and put his hand on his hips, under his open coat.
“Well you slept with him, you two have a history, I really doubt he’s gonna be my favourite.” He was getting nervous, he could feel his hands shaking a bit and he was now gesticulating wildly with his free hand. He really didn’t want to talk about their ex partners on their first date.
Harry laughed at that. He figured Malfoy was right, seeing someone speaking to a snake is not really a common occurrence, not even in the wizarding world. “Fair.” They walked in silence for a few seconds, and then he couldn’t help himself and added: “I can’t do it anymore.”
“Why didn’t you can the Ministry?” he asked, confused. He had not heard a single word about this at work.
“I've never seen anything like this.” If Hagrid was scared it meant it was really bad. He didn’t know of a single creature Hagrid didn’t like or find adorable.
They were showered and clad in their festive pyjamas – some horrible matching ones with moving reindeers that Draco had bought them. Harry loved them –, sitting on the bed with four gifts between them and Theo cuddled up between Harry’s crossed legs.
“I’ll ask Robards tomorrow. I need to take advantage of the fact that he was wrong and probably feels guilty.”
“Can we go inside?” Draco asked, and Harry knew what he was doing, he really did, but Draco’s cute smile and the fact that he just wanted to see him happy made him agree easily.
“Very fucking relieved if I have to be honest. I want this kid and I want it with her, just not right now. I need to figure out something for my job first of all, I don’t want to be gone for weeks at a time and leave her alone, pregnant or with an infant, I just need time to think things through.”
“I’ll let you two to it, then,” Ron interrupted them, reminding them that he was still listening. “Good night, guys, let me know for dinner and if you need anything for the case.”
Someone took their coats, leaving Harry very confused and frankly feeling out of place, then Antoine, their waiter for the night, appeared behind them, and brought them to their table. The whole room was very red, from the floor to the chairs, everything except the walls which were green, and the thought of Draco surrounded by his colour almost made him laugh. All the tables were covered by a white cloth, and most of them already had people sitting around and eating their very expensive meals.
Harry barely managed to hold back his laugh, instead he got up and went closer to them. “Mr Malfoy, thanks for inviting me.” He reached out, and tried his best not to shiver when their hands made contact. That man had ruined his life so many times, he had almost killed Ginny, he had summoned Voldemort, helped him rise again. And here he was, shaking hands with him, just for Draco.
“Why don't you relax and I order for you? You eat almost everything, right?” Draco offered, reaching out to rest his hand over Harry's.
“Well, first thing first I need someone who’s good at transfiguration and charms, to understand how the map works. I’m not sure how they made this happen.”
“Ssh, papa is sleeping.” He hugged him against his chest and kissed his little head. “What do you want? Food?” He put him in front of his bowls and sat next to him, just looking at him.
“She wanted to follow in Dumbledore’s steps, or so she said.” Malfoy shook his head and started walking up the stairs, and no, Harry wasn’t ogling his ass, but he could appreciate it okay? Malfoy was not the kid he once had been. He was still tall and slim, but his shoulders were slightly broader and his arms more defined under the white shirt he was wearing. His ass had clearly improved and looked quite frankly amazing in the pressed black trousers.
“I won't, promise.” He laughed when Harry lifted both of his eyebrows, clearly not convinced. “This is our first date after all, I do want to impress you and possibly make you stick around for a while.”
He simply nodded and exited the room, followed closely by Malfoy. “You don’t have to see me out, I’m sure you have more important things to do.”
“You told me a couple weeks ago. You said there is this guy you’ve liked for years that you can't get out of your head.”
“Have you been drinking, Potter? It’s only midday.” He took his cup and inspected it, subtly sniffing its content.
“You know I don’t have it in me to wake you up more than twice.” It was true. Just a couple of days earlier they had ended up falling asleep again because Harry felt bad waking him up when he looked so peaceful. “We need to eat breakfast. If you get up now, we could even have some time to play with Theodore.”
His crush had obviously gotten worse. Now that he actually knew Malfoy and the reasons behind a lot of what he had done and what had made him hate the other boy for all those years, he couldn’t help it but like him more and more everyday. Malfoy was still an annoying prat who made fun of him, but now it felt like teasing, maybe flirting at times. He wasn’t annoyed by what he said, he was endeared.
“Have I ever not fixed a patient?” she asked, almost offended. “He will be fine, don’t worry,” she said once she realised how shaken Harry actually was.
“About?” he asked, not even turning around. Why did he have so many pyjamas? Sure, he loved a lazy Sunday at home, but he was an active guy, he had no need for twenty different pyjamas.
“Yes, sorry.” He smiled at him, and almost leaned in for a kiss before remembering they were supposed to be subtle.
And then it stopped, and Draco was on all fours on the ground, coughing blood, while Ron was attacking the creature, whatever it was, with fire from the back. “Boys, get him," he ordered, never stopping the fire.
“Lobster mousse with Aquitaine caviar and champagne butter sauce” he announced, while another waiter started filling their glasses with white wine.
“I guess that too. It’s just really nice to spend time with him, we have fun together but we also have serious moments. Hopefully, now there will be also some cuddles.”
“Okay, fine. I hate you.” Draco finally sat up, looking so cuddly Harry was having a hard time sticking to his plan for the day.
“Max, I want you to meet someone special.” He held his arm in front of the owl and he immediately moved over it, affectionately biting his arm. He got closer to Harry, so that the owl could see him properly. “This is Harry, and I like him, so please behave. Harry, let him see you hand.”
“Headmistress, I didn’t know you were coming," he said, moving his eyes away from Malfoy, who was checking a little girl's wrist.
know that?” Well that was weird. He had never stopped to think about teachers’ lives outside Hogwarts. He had heard some of them mention a spouse, but that was the extent of it.
“I know, I would never take it away from you.  Besides, you can you use it when you sleep here. Don’t think you will get away with checking the corridors just because it's you.”
“I really want him. I’ve been thinking about getting a pet for a while now. I really am lonely when I’m home alone and don’t have kids scream out of my room.”
“Maybe he just uses magic to remove the organs,” Harry suggested. “He seemed conscious enough to do that.”
“Kinda,” he said, and the way he said it and looked away clearly meant that he was done talking about those things.
“You probably do” he agreed. It was true after all. Even with Ron he got bored after a whole day spent together, and yet here he was, spending most of his waking time with Draco and not getting tired for even a second.
“Yes.” He looked happy, something he had seen so rarely in those weeks, and Harry was getting more and more excited as the time went by. The fact that he was the reason of that made him feel special, it gave him a weird rush.
“Oh, did you now?” He didn't even try to hide his grin, he knew it would have been impossible to contain it.
“Doesn’t matter, let’s just start.” He quickly kissed Harry’s cheek, then walked around the table to sit in front of him. They were too far apart to be able to touch each other under the table, but at least Draco’s parents were even further away.
“Can you decide?” he asked, barely a whisper. Which meant he wanted it, he just wanted Harry to reassure him.
And now there he was, standing in front of the door, on the stone stairs, with bloody Draco Malfoy in front of him. It was so unfair how after all those years he still looked the same posh boy, with his stupid platinum hair in a perfect bun, his grey eyes shining with the light of the late afternoon and his pale skin slightly tanner but still looking soft and delicate.
“Because he is cute and lonely and you are too stubborn to get him for yourself so I’ll adopt him and pretend it’s for me and you can come visit him whenever you want.”
“Shut up, you like it when I’m a sap.” He started pushing him, and soon enough they were just play fighting like little kids.
The night ended quickly, after coffee and tea they exchanged gifts – a necklace for Draco's mum and cigars for his father, a very rare book for Draco and some very expensive scarf and hat for Harry – and then they took their port key back to England.
“You are so annoying. C’mon, let’s go home.” He got up and brushed away dead leaves from his clothes, then he offered Draco his hand to help him to his feet.
“You are all going crazy. I’m going to go and get a bit of fresh air.” He got up and left, while almost everyone looked at him knowingly. What the actual fuck. Him and Malfoy? Where did that even come from? He opened the door and immediately smelled cigarette. He looked around and found Malfoy leaning against a tree, with a cigarette between his fingers. “You smoke,” he said, and it wasn’t a question, he was mostly surprised.
“Okay, little secret for you since we are dating now.” He got closer, and his breath against Harry's neck made him shiver. “I get off on pleasing people. Shocking, I know,” he whispered. And how his voice went that deep Harry really didn't know, but it was doing weird things to his body.
“Do you think it could be a sort of ritual?” Malfoy asked McGonagall. He had gone very pale, and it looked like he was sweating more than usual.
The rest of the evening went well, but Draco was not able to relax after their conversation, and Harry just wanted his friends to leave so that he could hold his boyfriend and kiss him to make him forget everything.
“If that’s what you want," he said, not wanting to push him too much, especially not in front of Ron and Hermione.
“Getting a cat.” He started petting his little head, and the cat nuzzled against his hand. Fuck, he was in love already.
“White eyes. It was like... they looked empty, just white.” He held the branch of a tree up and let Malfoy through. “Be careful with this pl-" he didn’t manage to finish his phrase that the plant in question exploded in front of them. “Shit. Take off your shirt.” He started stripping, and was pleased to notice that Malfoy was doing the same. He really didn’t want to argue in that moment.
They did not, in fact, get tired. At all. A week later the News were covered with articles about the two of them and their new friendship. There were no details and only very subtle hints at the possibility of it being more than platonic, but it was clear that the information had come from an internal source.
“We won't see each other often when I’m done with this case, I was wondering if you’d consider sleeping at my house every once in a while? ‘Cause I know I probably won’t be allowed inside anymore once I’m done, but I’d really like to spend time with you.”
“And Ginny is seeing someone else, too. I love her, and I loved what we had, but it ended for a reason, and now I just want to see where this will take us."
He knew he couldn’t get in trouble, and yet he felt his cheeks heat up at that question. “Well, you are not going to like this.” He took the Map from his pocket and opened it in the middle of their circle. “My father and his friends created it, Draco managed to alter it and extend it to the forest.”
“You don’t have to say anything,” he assured him, caressing his cheek. “I just wanted you to know that I’m serious about us. Not seeing each other every day won't change anything, because I really care about you.”
“None of that, I did it because I love you, not because I wanted something from you. If you don’t want to come here, just day so.”
“I was freaking out, as you say, because I was scared you were going to realise that they were right and that I do have feelings for you.”
“I’ve had a crush on you for half of my life, what do you think? I’m just not used to expressing my feelings out loud?”
“Oh, Draco.” He pushed him away just enough to look into his eyes. He wasn’t crying, but his eyes looked very red and puffy. “I’m sorry I couldn’t do that for you.”
“No, I personally asked him not to let you anywhere near this. You are too involved, you’d put yourself in danger,” McGonagall said, and really, he was an adult with a job and a kitten he had adopted with his boyfriend, but he was not going to say no to her.
“Probably around Christmas, so a couple of weeks. I’d need to plan our port keys and it takes time.”
“It's not a problem. Also, I think we should start discussing about these lessons we have to do. Would you like me to collect some information about what they have done so far in each year?”
Harry apparated them once again, because being dragged by someone else was so much worse and feeling Draco's hand in his made him feel more grounded, and they appeared right in front of the gate.
“And you like reading, and teaching. I think you just need a little push. You’ve been sad for so long, you don’t know how to enjoy basic things.”
“Okay then, be careful.” He stepped inside the forest and immediately it felt like another place. It was so much quieter and dark, he could see movements all around them, but nothing that resembled what he thought he had seen.
“It's the memory of me going to him the day of the war. I left out the actual battle, just the interesting parts with the forest. We can go out as soon as we get there and see him, because after that I was basically dead so I don’t have a memory of the forest on the way back.”
“I think they buried the poor creatures after a while, but I'm sure you won't have to wait long for another one.”
“I could never hate spending time with you. The lessons will be around an hour and a half, then we will have all evening to cuddle and talk.”
“Just bad memories,” Harry replied for both of them. “Calm down, Malfoy, I’m not letting go until you start breathing normally.”
“Okay,” he said, looking almost shy. “Here’s your second gift,” he said, trying to gain back his composure, and he extended another package.
“We saw each other two weeks ago," he said, changing back to his normal self. “Did you want to talk about something?”
“You big sap, you scared me for a moment.” He hugged him immediately, hiding his face against his neck and smelling him, his shower gel and just the unmistakable scent of Draco. “We will see each other more often, and yes we will have to say bye twice but the time in between will be so short you won't even notice it.”
“That’s what I was thinking too," he said, trying to ignore Malfoy next to him, who had once again gotten very tense at the mention of Voldemort. “So, what do you think we should do?”
At that Harry felt his heart drop. That was the part he hated most about pet shops, the fact that he knew not all of them were going to get their happy ending.
“I should have known you were the cheesy type.” He let go of his hand, but even if he was trying to look annoyed, there was no way to hide his cute blush or the way his eyes were crinkling.
Draco visibly relaxed at that, and it made him feel sick, the knowledge that Draco was scared for him, and that he was going to be until the day he left his job.
“I’m being serious,” he said, laughing. He reached for the cup and put it back down. “Listen, I know you don’t like Ron and his family, but it would be the most convenient time for everyone. Hermione is so busy and we need to get this done quickly, right?”
“Everyone,” Ron answered, even though it wasn’t a question. “Just wait for your Christmas present, he goes over the top with those.”
“You are so fucked,” Ron said with a smirk. Bastard, he had been supportive of him and Hermione since the beginning, the least he could do was keep his comments to himself. Although Harry did break up with his little sister, that must have meant something.
“That's what a good boyfriend is supposed to do, you don’t need to thank me.” He bopped his nose just because.
“You know I respect both of you and I appreciate both of your work, but don’t think I forgot how things were between you two. I don’t want to see you in that infirmary ever again, not while I’m in this school.”
“We’ve been closer for a while, though.” He forced him to lift his chin so he could look at him. “I like that you are open and honest about your feelings. I’ve never had this before, not even with my parents.”
“Yeah and you are doing better than all of us combined cause they knocked you off with some good stuff. Get up."
“I just... have a hard time with death these days," he said with a bit of difficulty. “Like, grasping the concept and accepting it.”
The stayed like that even when Theodore jumped on the bed and sat between their faces, and didn’t move even when they knew they were both going to be late.
“Alright,” Draco called out “that's all for today. Remember to practice the spells for next week, I'll give each of you a grade so please be prepared,” he said, as birds were flying about the classroom.
“I think I forgot to tell you that we adopted a car,” Draco finally said, taking pity on his mother and his father, who was leaning toward them, clearly curious.
He cleared his throat, trying to get rid of the lump he was feeling. “The snake moves when you unlock the door.”
“I’d really like to stay.” He recovered pretty quickly and straightened his back, trying to look calm and collected when he was probably freaking out on the inside.
“No, you don’t, you wouldn’t be spending all this time with me if that was the case.” He quickly looked around, then he got closer and grabbed his hand. “I really like this. Can’t wait to do this Saturday evening.”
They walked slowly, careful not to wake up the little beast. When they reached the castle, a few students were just walking by, enjoying the chilly air of November. They all said hi, but were too preoccupied noticing the cat to even think about the fact that Harry and Draco were coming home together.
“Shall we go?” he asked while getting up. He checked one last time that Theodore had enough water and food and that all the surfaces were clean in case he wanted to snoop around.
“Guys, c’mon, I’m not that bad,” Hermione complained, but it was clear she didn’t really believe it either.
“This is your first one,” Harry extended a small blue package to Draco, who smiled at him when he noticed how tense Harry looked and made quick work of the wrapping paper. It was a box, small and decorated with hearts.
“We chat a lot. She's been really great these couple of years, she encouraged me on multiple occasions to find a partner.”
“If it has a mind if its own, it probably has figured out the pattern. And right now, you are one of the few people who gets so close to the forest.”
He ran as fast as he could, sure that Malfoy would not have appreciated him being late. He was right. When he finally reached the door, Malfoy was standing there with his arms crossed and his foot tapping the floor. “Sorry, I momentarily forgot how big this place is. I had to jump to get on the stairs, I almost fell down.”
“And here I was, thinking about being sexy for you and make you drool a little.” Draco left the bathroom looking down at himself. “Remind me to buy you new pyjamas, will you? Nice black silk, cute robes.”
“You are probably right.” He laughed, with tears in his eyes. “Do you think they liked pizza?” he suddenly asked, as if that was the most important question of them all.
“Of course it’s okay, dear.” Molly appeared from behind Ron and engulfed him in a hug. “Harry, you’ve finally gained weight I see. I told you that Hogwarts was gonna be wonderful for you.” She let him go and pinched his cheek. “Mr Malfoy,” she said, more formal but still sounding genuine and happy.
“Oh, you poor thing.” He only sounded relatively mocking, betrayed only by his concerned expression.
Then they just walked around, stopping from time to time to look at something in the shop windows but never going inside, not even for the broomsticks. That is, until they saw the pet shop.
“Well, you make a really cute couple.” His mother touched his cheek slightly, then went back on the sofa next to her husband.
“Did you know that McGonagall used to have a cottage near the school where she lived with her husband?”
If the noise of Draco's knife hitting the floor was of any indication, he had understood what he meant with that.
“It's okay, I’m glad you told me. We will work on this, ok? We just need to figure out what we like and go from there. I’m sure we have more in common than you think."
It was weird how right it all felt. Taking Draco on a date, walking hand in hand, talking about stupid things and just spending time together. And yet it was. Everything felt right. For the first time in his life, he wasn’t worried about being killed, about getting detention, about his boss shouting at him, he had Draco to look forward to at the end of a long day. The thought scared the shit out of him, and yet he was ready for their relationship.
"No," Severus answered. "He has never been late for a detention. His classes, yes, but never for a detention."
They got Potter on his feet but he wasn't steady as he swayed there. Draco eyed him off before slipping under his arm and taking some of his weight.
He started when Potter grabbed his wrist, stopping him. His eyes shot up to his green ones. Draco couldn't read the expression on his face.
Potter groaned before blinking his eyes open. There was a glazed look to his eyes and Draco wasn't sure if he was aware of what was going on around him.
Draco frowned at those words, he didn't know much about Potter's home life, beyond what Severus had told him. He was starting to get an inkling that it wasn't a happy one. He must have stood there too long for Potter started to lower the blanket and his eyes became guarded.
"I'm sure that he isn't in the good books with the Dark Lord at the moment," Potter mentioned with a smirk.
"I'm here, because your girlfriend won't help me," Potter spat and Draco paused at the tone of voice.
"He came across me in the bathroom and when McGonagall caught us. He took the blame," Draco admitted. "He even elbowed me when I was going to confess."
Draco looked at Potter but he wasn't looking at him and Draco had no choice but to leave the room. Leave the mess that he'd made for Potter to clean up.
Draco looked at him sharply but Potter had never been stupid and Draco nodded sharply. Potter gave him a glance over before nodding and walking away. Draco didn't follow him, he needed a moment to try and muddle through his own thoughts.
Severus nodded sharply as the pain potion worked and Potter relaxed back into the wall. Draco was sure that if they left him there that Potter would fall asleep that way.
Potter froze as Granger swirled around while Snape looked the scene over. Potter's eyes didn’t leave him as they blazed in rage.
Potter arched his back and Draco could feel how hard he was as he pulled back and looked down. He rolled to the side and Potter quickened his pace on his cock as Draco grabbed his ass and pulled him closer. He bucked into Potter's hand as he got closer and slipped one hand into that shaggy hair. He drew Potter into a kiss just as he tipped over and came with a gasp. Potter tugged him a few more times before stilling, his hand still wrapped around him as Draco panted. He had his head resting against that hard chest as Potter panted.
Weasley stalked away and Potter just watched his friend before with a sigh he went back to the book in front of him. Draco's eyes caught on the bruise on his arm and he shifted to get a better look through the books. The bruise looked fresh and he was sure that it wasn't there yesterday.
Potter wasn't in classes for the next few days and Draco grew concerned but his trust in Severus held. Three days after Draco found Potter in that room, he picked up on the soft sounds of a guitar. He smiled with a skip in his step as he headed towards the classroom. He closed the door softly behind him before turning and taking in the sight of Potter sitting there. He had a book open in front of him as he picked away on his guitar.
"Fourth floor," Draco replied as he took a seat across from Severus. "But I don't think that it works."
"You would have to look through the supplies that he gave me," Lupin replied and looked at Potter. "Are you okay?"
Draco felt his gut clench at that and he thought about how many purebloods were at the school and those empty classrooms.
Potter groaned but didn't look away, Severus pulled back quickly before he slipped his potion pouch from his robes. Potter screwed his eyes shut.
Severus looked more pale than normal and his hair was in a limp tail at the back of his neck. He limped slightly as he walked back to the lounge and slowly eased himself down. Draco looked him over in concern.
"It wasn't just him, Potter." Draco countered. "I saw you after you were attacked in the hospital wing."
Draco woke slowly the next morning to the soft sounds of birds and Potter's arm over him. He shifted back slightly as he glanced over his shoulder but the other boy was still out. Severus had warned him that he would sleep for a while and when he woke that he had to take a potion to flush out the rest of the poison. Draco just took in the feel of the arm over him and the warmth of the body behind him as he relaxed back. He had no idea what his life held now, but he had played his cards. Done what needed to be done and put his trust in Severus.
"Run, Draco." Severus told him as Potter looked up at them in confusion. "For they will be after Potter's blood."
Draco watched as Potter slid down his body then groaned when he went down on him. Taking him into his mouth and Draco had to stop himself from bucking up. Potter grabbed his hip in one hand as the other found his balls. Draco held on as long as he could as Potter swirled his tongue around him and brought him close before pulling back. Draco groaned at the sight and feeling as the pleasure built.
"Not much we can do now," Severus conceded. "Albus has played his hand in this, we have no choice now. Potter will be a witness to his death."
"Good morning, Mr Malfoy." Lupin greeted with a smile. "Severus sent me with some supplies and other things."
"Potter hasn't said," Severus told him. "He won't tell us and we don't think that it was a student staying here."
"She thinks that you are wasting your time," Weasley replied as he stood. "And so do I, he is gone, Harry."
Draco snorted and stepped up to the front door and grabbed the handle. He felt the wards pass over him before the door opened under his hand. He stepped in and could tell that the place hadn't been used for a while by the dust and the musty smell.
"Not yet," Severus answered. "I need you to keep an eye on Potter…not that that will be much of a problem for you."
Potter tightened his hold before he stepped back and Draco reluctantly let him go. Those green eyes looked him over before a mask seemed to fall into place and he nodded.
Draco snorted then felt his gut clench when he realised that Potter wouldn't get the chance to redo his sixth year. The chance that he'll be able to start his seventh was still in doubt. Draco looked at Potter sharply at those thoughts as the other man tapped away on the keys. Was this why he wasn't focusing on his school work? Potter then glanced at him then paused.
"I'm unsure what that memory was," Severus admitted. "However, it was one that he must have had buried very deep."
The other boy slowly removed his hands and squinted up at Draco with red eyes as he rested his head back on the wall behind him. Draco rushed forward as concern bolted through him. Potter was paper white which just made his bloodshot eyes stand out even more. He could tell that it wasn't tears that were making his eyes red as Potter squeezed them closed.
The two boys fell into silence and Draco shifted as he looked around the classroom. It looked like it was being used for storage, much like so many other rooms. A fact that was making his task that much harder.
Draco turned back the piano and started on the song that he'd been learning and Potter added his instrument to the mix. He didn't have the music before him but he proved that he didn't need it as Draco struggled through. He would stop and start as he read the sheet music and Potter would strum along. He found it was easier as Potter played and he picked up the song quickly. They continued on like that for the next hour before Draco stopped.
"Potter mustn't have caught anything," Draco explained. "He always comes back in a mood when he doesn't get anything."
"We'll have a look at it and may have to move it," Severus said softly as he rubbed his face. "I'll talk to Albus tomorrow."
"I don't know," Severus admitted as he sat back on his heels. "The Dark Lord can't be permanently killed while a Horcrux is still intact."
"More like less self-council before he says something," Severus answered. "We need to work out how the Dark Lord is getting through to him without eye contact."
"I am more concerned with how having that Horcrux in his mind could have contaminated him," Severus countered. "You must admit that his behaviour has changed since the Dark Lord tried to take over his mind."
"What's that look for, Malfoy?" Potter asked. "I thought you would be happy that I might fall a year behind."
Severus glared down his nose at the girl and she shrunk back. Interestingly, Potter stepped in front of her and met Severus's glare head on.
Draco smiled as he followed the other boy, Potter had made a little space for himself near one of the windows. He had a blanket and his bag and looked like he was set up for a while. He wasn't sure what had sent Potter to hide but it looked like he'd planned on an extended stay.
"Do I have to find a better classroom to hide in?" Potter asked as his fingers danced over the strings as he moved onto a song he knew. "Learning a new song, never sounds great to others."
Potter turned at the voice and Blaise pulled his wand. Potter turned back just as Blaise flicked his wand. Draco winced as Potter was thrown across the hall by the spell and students scattered. Potter hit the wall hard beside him but quickly jumped to his feet.
Draco stumbled back at that word and felt something cold settle in his stomach. Potter just watched him as he leaned back into the wall behind him. His eyes darted down to the bugle in his pants, he could clearly see that Potter was interested.
Draco was dragging his feet as he made his way down the hallway in Malfoy manor. He wouldn't say he was being childish, even if his father would see it that way, he just didn't want to hurry to where he had to be. He paused outside of his father's office before knocking.
Draco huffed but settled back in, feeling the warmth of the man next to him. Potter wasn't normally the close type but right then Draco got the feeling that he needed the human contact. Draco laid his hand on the other man's thigh and Potter covered it with his own.
Potter shrugged and met his eyes and Draco sucked in a breath. He wasn't being melodramatic, he believed his words. Draco stepped forward and closed the distance between them and Potter frowned.
Draco held still as Potter's eyes slipped out of focus while Severus cast the spell. They held locked in that stare for a while before Potter blinked his eyes. Severus lowered his wand with a frown. Potter pushed his glasses up and rubbed his eyes. Draco stood and filled a glass of water for him. He held it out and Potter took it from his hand with a nod and a soft look.
"Fifty points from Gryffindor for fighting, Mr Weasley." McGonagall stated and Weasley opened his mouth. "And a week of detentions."
Draco felt a bolt go through him at the words and was happy that Potter was on the other side of the cupboard and couldn't see him. Potter looked around the side of the piece of furniture and raised an eyebrow when Draco didn't say anything.
It was late afternoon when Draco came across Potter. He was sitting on a log near where the stream widened into a large lake. Potter looked over at him as Draco stepped closer and patted the log next to him. Draco gave him a sneer before settling down. He started slightly when Potter wrapped his arm around his waist and pulled him close. Draco rested against his side while he took in the sight of the lake.
Draco stormed out of the room, not even glancing back. Draco had cooled down by the time that he arrived outside of Severus's rooms. He knocked on the door loudly before tapping his foot as he waited. Severus opened the door and looked him over before pushing the door further open.
"You decided to take a late-night walk to the stream and something happened," Draco grumbled, still half asleep. "Care to explain what?"
Draco started and almost dropped the book in his hand when a knock sounded at the front door. He grabbed his wand and crept forward.
Potter didn't react and Draco felt for a pulse, it felt rapid and his breathing was a little quick. His skin felt cold as Draco looked around. He would need to use magic to get him back to the cabin. Draco pulled his wand and hesitated before giving it a flick as he cast the floating charm. Potter lifted up in the air limply and Draco quickly led him back to the cabin. He settled him down in front of the fireplace and looked over at the fire that Potter had built up earlier but hadn't lit. He picked up the matches and lit the paper in the middle of the pyramid of wood and it caught quickly.
The other boy froze when he saw him before a hard look came across his face and he continued down the hall.
"If they took away all the half-bloods and muggleborns," Draco said slowly. "It would be about half the students."
"Yes," Potter groaned and leaned back on the wall and Draco let his hand drop. " He's been doing nothing but 'talk' to me…I don't like this."
"I think that I'll just have a shower and head to bed," Potter said without looking at him. "Assuming this place has one."
Draco looked down and frowned at the complex runes on the page. He knew for a fact that Potter didn't take that class. Not to mention the fact that the book looked too advanced even for him and he was in the sixth-year Runes class.
Draco looked out at the rain from the shelter at the front of the tent and sighed. Severus had told him to head north from where the portkey spat them out and they would find a cabin that they could use for a while. With the rain, Draco was reluctant to go anywhere.  Severus had packed a few changes of clothes and food but neither one would last long.
Draco placed the apple in the cupboard and shut the door as Severus cast the spell. He opened the door again to find the apple gone. He stared at the inside of the empty cupboard and wasn't sure what to think. Severus clasped his hand to his shoulder and Draco appreciated the support in that moment. His godfather knew what he needed as he sighed.
"Yes," Severus answered. "He was a Death Eater and it looks like he had second thoughts. He died before the end of the last war. This gives us a clue about where the real Horcrux could be."
"I don't believe that is any of your business," Potter replied mildly as he leaned back in his chair at the table.
Draco nodded and Potter plucked out a couple of notes before moving into a slow song. He didn't sing as he let the notes speak for themselves as his fingers danced along the strings. Draco had been forced to play the piano and knew the kind of skill that Potter was displaying as he took in the look of concentration on his face.
Draco noticed Potter's eyes taking him in as well as he slinked towards him with smooth steps. He felt hunger run through him at that grace as Potter stopped before him. He then reached out and cupped him and Draco tensed.
He was a head taller than Potter as he glared down into those green eyes. He bunched his fists up and before he knew it, he threw a punch at the smaller man. Potter didn't move out of his way, he just turned with the blow. The fight went out of Draco as he stood there, slightly shaking. Potter turned his face back towards him, he'd split his lip and Draco could see a red mark on his cheek.
"Albus left a message," Severus announced, looking pale. "He took Potter somewhere, he left a note to say that they will be back for the plan to go ahead. That Potter will have his cloak and wants him to be at the tower."
Potter quirked a smile but Draco hadn't been lying. The other boy looked pale with dark smudges under his eyes and had a few beads of sweat on his brow. His eyes were dull and Draco knew that he was still a little confused from the lingering effects of the poison, not that Potter would show that weakness.
Draco's shoulders slumped and he walked over to the potion master and out into the hallway. He could feel the rage rolling off the older man and he knew that this wasn't going to go well. Severus held his office door open and Draco slinked past him and into the room.
"When I work it out, Potter." Draco replied as he walked towards the door to the classroom. "I'll let you know."
Draco sighed and made his way over to the sleeping bag and gently nudged Potter over and curled along his back. They only had the one but it was large enough for both of them as he placed an arm over Potter's chest and took in the sounds of his soft breathing. So much had happened so quickly and Draco's mind was still trying to process it as he slipped into exhausted sleep.
"My mother rarely spoke of her sisters," Draco said. "Or anyone on her side of the family. I could never work out why."
That shut Draco up and he nodded sharply. His godfather knew what cards to play to get what he wanted.
Draco slammed open the door to the unused classroom. Potter turned on him with his wand out. Draco then slammed the door behind him before pulling his wand and throwing out a spell. Potter yelped as he dodged to the side.
Draco cringed when Potter threw a punch and hit Blaise straight on and the boy went down. Yelling sounded on the air as Potter stood there as Blaise stared up at him with blood drippling down his face. The boy then yelled and lunched himself at Potter and the Gryffindor slipped to the side easily. Draco smirked at that, as Potter showed talent as he fended off the taller boy.
"Can we make it at seven?" Potter replied as he sat back in his seat. "I have a detention with Snape at six."
Then Potter staggered and Severus quickly grabbed his shoulder. Draco knew that the lesson was over. Potter grabbed his head as he screwed his eyes closed and Severus held him up.
"That doesn't begin to cover it," Potter commented as he ran his hand down the side of the wooden cabinet. "So, what's the deal with this? Is it a doorway to Narnia?"
Draco snorted and looked down at the Gryffindor before him. Potter was bruised and bloody and Draco wondered just how far that fight had gone. He'd washed his face but Draco could see the faint bruising, a cut near his hairline and blood on his uniform as he sat against the wall beside one of the windows in the unused classroom. It was one of Potter's current hiding spots and he noticed that he didn't have his guitar with him this time.
"Thank you," Severus offered and took the cup in his slightly shaking hand. "Take a seat. What's on your mind?"
"Sounds like he doesn't want to be found," Draco remarked, his mind already thinking of the spots Potter like to hide. "What do you need me for?"
Severus cursed and Draco looked at his godfather as he pulled a hand through his hair roughly. He could tell that he was agitated and on edge.
"Don't try to break the whole piece with one blow," Potter intoned as he cut the wood up. "Kindling is more fiddly."
"A lot," Draco replied and Potter's arm shifted slightly but he didn't remove it. "What do you remember?"
The person could carry a tune as he plucked away on the guitar before falling silent as he continued to strum along to a song that Draco didn't know. The person paused slightly before starting another song, showing skill as he made his way through the melody. Draco peered around the door and froze when he spotted Potter sitting there. The other boy was focused on the instrument in his hands as the sound floated on the air.
Draco felt cold as he sat on a large boulder at the edge of the Great Lake. His mother's words running through his head. He was supposed to find that cupboard so that he could let death eaters into the school. He was then supposed to kill Albus Dumbledore and if he failed then Severus Snape would finish the job. He just felt cold at the thought, even with his godfather's support.
"Potter," Filch ordered without looking at the other boy. "Show the prince what he'll be doing. I'll be back in one hour."
"Perhaps a few less hits to the head might help," Draco suggested and Potter quirked a smile. "I'm sure that I could sneak a potion from Severus?"
Draco's eyes caught on Potter and Granger sitting together at the Gryffindor table. Weasley sat further down the table with Thomas and Longbottom between them. Granger had a book out on the table and Potter had an odd look on his face. He frowned slightly at that expression and the way that Granger kept tapping the book.
Draco felt his heart clench at the words and wished that Potter would look up. He let him go at the pace he needed to.
Potter slowly blinked his eyes open and tried to focus on them as Draco stepped forward. He crouched down and Potter didn't react as he grabbed his arm.
Draco picked up the rock and tested the weight as he glanced over at Potter. Severus's orders had been clear but he didn't feel right as he held the rock. Potter was sitting with Granger as they looked at a book in the girl's hand. Weasley was nowhere to be seen and Draco was thankful for that. He nervously fiddled with the rock but he was just delaying. He swallowed back his trepidations and hurled the rock at Gryffindor.
"There's a room down here that Potter can use tonight," Severus said into the silence. "Potter, can you get up?"
"Have you ever wondered why there are so many rooms like this in the castle?" Potter asked into the silence.
Draco hesitated before he opened the door and stepped into the room. There would have been a time when that hesitation wasn't there. That time had passed as he schooled his face carefully. He blanked his thoughts, as his godfather had taught him, and faced his father and his guest.
"Have you seen a piano in your travels through these junk rooms?" Draco questioned when Potter stopped.
"Go," Potter groaned as he grabbed his head in both hands as he slipped further down to the floor. "Oh, god."
"Talk to your mother, Draco." Severus told him after a few minutes of silence. "You know that I will be here to support you."
Draco stood up and Severus embraced him in a hug and held him tight for a second before releasing him. His dark eyes looked him over before giving him a small smile.
Draco didn't stop him this time as he looked down at the blanket that Potter had left behind. He crouched down and noticed a few books and picked them up. Muggle fiction greeted him and he was sure that this was Potter's new hiding spot. He sat down on the blanket and read through the blurbs on the back of the books in interest. It was a good half an hour before he left the classroom and headed down to the dungeons.
"Potter secret," Potter remarked with a wink. "Well, I better pack up. Now that I've been found. I'll have to face the music and the detentions."
"I'm the boy who lived," Potter stated as he gave him a grin and held his hands out. "Cursed more than just by the killing spell."
Draco followed him back and picked up the handles of the wheel burrow this time. Potter gave him a glance as he wheeled it away. The other man didn't follow him and Draco felt his own temper rise before he noticed him picking up smaller pieces of wood. Draco filled up the wheel burrow while Potter neatly stacked the wood by the side of Hagrid's hut.
Draco woke with a start then frowned when he didn't find Potter in the bed. He reached out but the other side was cold and it was still dark out. He pulled himself from the bed and snagged up his coat, the days may be getting warm but the nights were still cool. He walked into the main room then felt fear settle in his stomach when he didn't find Potter there either. Draco checked the bathroom before he headed to the front door. He shivered as he looked out at the dark forest and didn't know where to start.
"How about tomorrow instead?" The Hufflepuff said. "I know that Snape's detentions can go longer than an hour."
"Then you will be kept busy cleaning this mess up." McGonagall stated, tensely. "Without magic, Mr Potter. You are not to leave until you have picked up every piece of glass!"
"I am so sorry, my dragon." Narcissa whispered. "This is not the life that I would have picked for you."
Draco wandered over to the mantle and looked down at the other boy. Potter looked up at him and Draco gave him a smile as he took in his shaggy, mess of hair plastered to his head.
Draco stepped back sharply as he flicked his hand. He hadn't expected the sting of his knuckles. He glared at Potter as his eyes caught on the blood on his lip. Potter just held his hands out to his sides.
"My aunt has been helping her," Blaise said. "It's a good thing that we have a big family. It makes it easier on mum…since dad died."
Potted pulled back before bringing the axe down with the wood still attached to the end onto the stump and it made a loud crack. He lifted the blade with the wood still attached and brought it down again and it split in two.
Potter chuckled and Draco found himself smiling despite the water drippling down his back. They made their way in silence for the next hour until a cabin caught their attention. It sat alone on a slight hill with the trees set further back. The grass and wildflowers surrounded the clearing and Draco was sure that a spell kept them under control. It was made from stone with a chimney and only looked small from the outside. He knew if it was a magical home that it could be deceiving of what was inside.
Draco muttered under his breath as he looked at the book before him and held his wand in his other hand. He glanced up at the open cupboard before him before flicking his wand. Nothing happened and he growled in frustration. Something was wrong with the connection spell between this cupboard and the one that his father had. He just couldn't work out how to fix it, even with Severus and Albus helping him.
"But it is one that my father has," Draco hissed then regretted his words as a tear slipped down his mother's face.
Draco turned on the other man and Potter gave him a smirk before getting to his feet. Draco's eyes took in the sight of him. From his broad shoulders and hard chest. He had the body of a man that worked out, even if he was on the shorter side, with lean legs and a slim waist. His shaggy black hair gave him a rugged look which was offset by the red scar and dried blood. He had a sprinkling of dark hair on his chest and down to his groin and unlike others Draco had been with. He didn't shave around his genitals but did keep it trim.
Potter stepped back sharply as his face drained of colour which just made the blood swiped across his forehead stand out even more. Draco took a step closer and Potter's eyes locked on him.
Draco nodded in agreement and stepped closer. Potter just eyed him off. They hadn't been this close since Draco had kissed him. He settled in front of Potter and felt that urge again. The other boy just watched him in interest, his last move had been met with distain. He let his hand rest on Potter's arm again and when he wasn't shrugged off, he ran his hand down.
Potter laughed at that and started to play. Draco leaned back on a desk behind him and just listened as he took in the image that Potter made. He could tell that the music calmed the other man as he moved from song to song with the odd bit of singing. Draco could feel his own kind of calm come over him. He could tell that Potter didn't want to talk about what had driven him away from everyone as he played.
"There were more," Potter said so softly that Draco had to strain to hear him. "I had problems remembering, I knew that Zabini had something to do with it but there were others."
He staggered back a step and slowly brought his head up and Draco had to give him credit. Potter braced himself while Severus eyed him off.
Hagrid glanced over at Draco before heading back inside to cottage. Draco stepped over to the table and poured water into the two glasses and held one up for Potter, whom just ignored him.
"We can't find Potter," Severus explained, once they are alone. "He hasn't been seen since breakfast yesterday and Weasley said that he didn't use his bed last night. Albus knows that he's still in the castle but every spell that we have used, so far, has failed."
"File into the classroom," Snape ordered, sharply. "Sit at your desks and open your books to page three hundred and five and start reading."
They fell into silence, if the death eaters got the upper hand, everything that Draco knew would end. The fact that Dumbledore knew what was coming gave him some type of hope that he would have plans in place. Draco paused his thoughts and wondered when he'd started to think of it from the other side of the fence. When did, what he'd learned at his father's knee, stop making sense to him. He had a feeling that Potter was to blame for that as well.
Potter laughed and Draco felt himself relaxing as the frustrations of trying to get the cupboard to work, drained away. He looked Potter over as he looked at the rune work above the door of the cupboard and the writing. The other boy was looking better and he didn't see any odd bruises.
"I don't think that has anything to do with you," Potter said coldly and Draco pulled back at those words.
"And present," Draco added. "Severus has always had an interest in the darker side of magic. I believe it had something to do with his childhood."
Severus stood up smoothly and Draco noticed Potter tense. The taller man stepped towards the younger man but he held his ground as he watched him, warily.
Potter was focused on the book in front of him and had a few more around him. He had always thought of Granger as the smart one of that trio and to see Potter bent over a book had him frowning. The other boy had changed since the end of his fifth year and Draco had a feeling that he was dealing with more than what others knew. Draco crept closer along the stacks and tried to see what Potter was looking at but he couldn't see the titles on the books and he gave up.
"Do you want help?" Potter offered and Draco almost tripped. "What's the matter, Malfoy? Too straight forward for you?"
Lupin rose to his feet and Draco expected Potter to give the other man a hug or something but he stayed where he was beside him. Lupin gave them a small smile before leaving. Potter leaned forward on the lounge and cupped the back of his head. Draco didn't know what to do as he sat there. He placed his hand on Potter's back and rubbed it.
Draco blushed deeply and looked at his godfather with large eyes. He hadn't meant to say that as Severus looked at him in shocked silence.
Draco rolled the paper up and slipped out the three potions and handed two to Potter. He looked them over before sighing. He broke the seal on the first one and gulped it down. He grimaced at the taste before throwing back the second one.
"Have you run out of detentions?" Draco remarked as he picked up his dropped book and slipped his wand away.
"You mean they don't have orgies down in the dungeons?" Potter drawled as his hand ran down Draco's back. "Saturday nights in Slytherin common room?"
Draco started awake with a snort with Potter in his arms. He shifted back and Potter glanced over his shoulder at him.
Draco plucked away at a few strings and Potter gave him a smirk. He glanced around at the stuff laid out.
Severus snorted as the front door opened and Potter came in with his arms full of wood. He paused when he saw Severus and his look darkened but so did Severus's. Draco knew that they didn't like the other but they had proved that they could work together.
Draco stepped back into the bedroom and placed his wand back down. He quickly dressed before stepping back out. He walked over to the lounge and sat down next to Potter. Their shoulders brushing each other. Lupin looked them over but Potter just leaned back next to him, without a word.
He grabbed Potter's shoulder and pulled and he rolled limply onto his back. He was cold to the touch and was only wearing his long pants and a shirt. That wasn't the concerning part and what had Draco's heart racing. It was the blood down the side of his face. Draco quickly cupped his cold cheeks before he pulled a cloth from his pocket and dipped it into the stream beside him. He wiped his face down and frowned when he could tell that the blood came from the reddened scar on Potter's brow.
"Thinking of learning?" Draco asked as he perched himself on one of the desks. "I would think improving your marks would be time better spent."
Once he was sure that the fire wasn't going to go out. He rushed to the bedroom and pulled the blankets off the bed. He touched on Potter clothes and noticed that they were wet as well as cold. He paused briefly before stripping him down to his underwear and hung up his clothes. Potter started to shiver as Draco added another log to the fire. He settled the blankets around him but his shaking didn't subside. He looked at the curse scar and could see that it was still bleeding and frowned. Something had happened.
Potter quirked a smile and dropped his arms and stepped forward. Draco was surprised when Potter grabbed him in a tight hug. Draco just wrapped his arms around the shorter man and took in the feel and smell of him. He had no idea where this was going, nor did he care.
"I wouldn't inform Potter of either one of those," Severus drawled and Draco flushed and looked away. "Where is the cupboard?"
Draco found himself watching Potter then getting frustrated at himself. He tried to convice himself it was to know his enemy but he couldn't push away the…interest in the odd bruises on the other boy. The black eye was just the start as the weather turned cooler and he could see the bruises on his arms and the odd one on his face. Potter's friends were no different but Draco noticed that Potter seemed to sit with Ginny Weasley more than her brother and Granger.
Potter's eyes burned into him and Draco felt himself responding to that. He let the other boy see how he felt as he stood there and waited. He felt that this could go either way as his eyes caught on the bruising on the other boy's skin and the blood on his collar. His eyes caught on Potter's other hand when he reached up then touched his hair. Draco held still as those fingers ran through his hair and a smile came to his face.
Draco slumped down to his knees before the other boy at those words. Potter looked him over in amusement.
"Not if you can portkey in and out," Draco reminded him. "Or floo or even apparation. Distance doesn't mean much when you can just appear on the front step."
Potter groaned as they helped him sit up against the cupboard. He tilted his head back as he closed his eyes.
"You have to work with the grain," Potter told him as he picked up the larger piece of wood. "See how the lines run?"
Draco soon learned that Potter could cook and had nightmares at night. Draco didn't ask about what and Potter didn't remark on the fact that they would wake curled up around the other or the fact that Draco would wake up with a hard on. Draco tried not to stare when Potter would chop up the wood for the fire and Potter wouldn't call him out when he caught him at it. They quickly learned which topics to broach and which ones to let go and he was surprised to find how easily they fell into living together.
"Is that so," Severus said with a smirk as he leaned forward in his chair and looked at him. "No other reason?"
Draco looked away and felt sick in the pit of his stomach. Before the school year was out; one of them would be responsible for Albus Dumbledore's death. He selfishly hoped that it wasn't him.
Filch then walked off and Draco watched him in confusion. Filch had never left when he'd had detention with him before. He seemed to take great delight in watching him work on some task that magic would have solved in one flick of a wand. He looked back to Potter and he just shrugged his shoulders and started walking.
"No," Potter stated and stepped forward, glass crunching under his shoes. "Something has upset you."
Draco waited for Potter to explain but he just made his way over to the fireplace. Draco gave a mental shrug as he headed to the bathroom and was happy to find hot water. He washed quickly and dressed in dry clothes from his bag, thankful for the repealing charm on the it. He hung up his clothes from the towel rail and left the bag in the bathroom for Potter. When he walked into the main room, Potter had the fire going. He had to admit that he had skills, since he would have started the fire without magic.
Potter snorted and walked around to the back of the wardrobe and Draco placed his book away in his bag. He would have to talk to Severus about Potter knowing what he was doing.
"Of course," Potter replied. "Dumbledore wants to see me more often and is talking about how Tom Riddle became all powerful. That I am the only one to kill him and…well the list goes on."
"I thought it would help," Potter sighed and turned on the bench seat to look at him head on. "I broke into the restricted area and read through the books there. Snape says that the barrier that I've placed is better but I don't have the mind for that type of magic. That didn't sit right with me."
Severus looked him over for a few long minutes before nodding. He stalked to the door to the room and out into the hallway. They walked in silence to the hospital wing and Severus led Draco to one of the private rooms in the back. He knocked on the door before he entered. Draco stepped in then stopped. Potter lay in the bed with his back to the door but Draco could see the cuts and bruises on his skin.
Draco could feel his face heating as Severus gave him a look that had him blushing. Draco was saved from replying when chopping started up from outside and they looked over that way.
Draco shivered at those words and looked down at Harry Potter before him. It wasn't only Dumbledore they were entwined with. He reached out and touched Potter's face while Severus held his shoulder in support.
Draco snorted at his words and ran his thumb over the back of Potter's hand. The other boy had a frown on his brow and Draco's eyes caught on the blood.
He looked up to see amused green eyes watching him and a smile on Potter's face. The shorter boy stepped closer and held out his hand.
Draco tried to relax as another part of him took notice of the situation while Potter's breathing evened out. He touched on the hand on his stomach and could feel the roughness and the calluses on his knuckles. He grabbed a hold of his reactions as he settled back and closed his eyes and just tried to sleep.
Draco chuckled and looked at him in amusement. Potter laid a hand on his leg and Draco didn't look too far into that. Potter leaned into him and rubbed his eyes with his other hand.
Potter just sneered at him then started walking again. They fell into silence as Potter led them down towards Hagrid's hut. They stopped near a large wood pile and Potter grabbed up a wheel burrow and started to fill it. Draco stood back, unsure if he should help him or not. Potter shrugged out of his robes, until he stood in just his long pants and shirt before going back to the work.
Draco felt cold flood through him as Blaise looked back over at the Gryffindor table. Potter looked up then narrowed his eyes as Blaise smirked then gave him an air kiss. Potter's face tightened as Granger looked up then she said something to him, drawing his attention back. Draco felt that coldness spread as he connected the dots.
Draco nodded, he knew that. He looked back down at Potter and felt rage pulse through him. Someone had tried to kill him, Severus didn't lighten or exaggerate his words. Someone had come into the school and almost killed the man before him. Instead of feeling happy about that; Draco wanted to hunt down that person and return what had been done to Potter.
Draco paused when he heard the soft sounds of a guitar. He was in a part of castle that wasn't used often and there were no classrooms in this wing. He hadn't expected to come across anyone and that's why he was there. He crept closer to the sound and noticed a door open further along the hall and the soft sounds of singing. He knew it was a male by the tone as he settled with his back to the wall beside the open door and listened.
"There were more students when the founders started the school than now," Draco announced and Potter looked up from his book in the library with a frown. "That's why there are so many classrooms filled with furniture."
"There are more rooms like this one in the castle than the rooms we use," Potter pointed out. "Have you ever wondered why?"
Both Slytherins watched as Potter walked out the front door. Draco didn't want him to be alone just then but also knew that he was right. He turned to Severus and took in his expression. His godfather was already thinking of how to get around this problem.
Severus snorted as he poured a glass of juice and pushed it towards Draco before filling another glass.
Draco snarled and pulled Potter forward before slamming him back again. Potter grunted at the impact but didn't fight back. Draco let him go before swinging his fist into Potter's face. The boy went down hard on the ground and Draco stood above him and sneered. He pulled his foot back then stopped. Instead, he crouched down and picked up Potter's glasses. The other boy looked up at him with slightly out of focus eyes.
Draco rushed out of the room and down the hall to Severus's rooms and knocked loudly. Severus appeared quickly and looked at him with a frown.
"She knows that something is going on," Severus replied as he clasped a hand to his shoulder. "She knows that Lucius and the Dark Lord don't have you."
Draco knocked on Severus's door both in excitement and dread. He waited impatiently before he knocked again. He cursed under his breath and looked around the hallway. The door opened and Draco looked back sharply then paused at the look of his godfather.
Draco looked into those dancing green eyes and could feel his chest tighten as his cock strained against his pants. Draco made the first move this time as he ran his hands into that shaggy mess of hair and captured Potter's lips. He deepened the kiss as he pushed into Potter then groaned when a hand found the front of his pants and rubbed him. He hadn't expected this as Potter rubbed him. He rocked his hips forward into the other boy as Potter stepped back into the wall. Draco took over control as one of his hands grabbed Potter's ass as he rubbed himself into him.
"I can see that the Malfoy line in strong," Voldemort remarked. "I hope your son will be just as loyal as you Lucius."
Draco looked around the bare room, there was nothing of Potter's in the room. His friends had brought nothing down to him.
"-too good for us, Harry!" He could hear Ron Weasley yell. "Stuck up now that you been seen with Malfoy!"
"I suppose," Potter said slowly. "There is one piano on the second floor that is probably better than the others."
Draco nodded, he trusted his godfather more than anyone in his life. He just hoped that he would save him from having to kill a man. He looked up into that stern face and those hard black eyes.
Potter finished the song and blinked his eyes open. His left eye was swollen but his green eyes were still sharp.
