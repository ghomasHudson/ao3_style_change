Severus smirked as he looked over Harry proudly.
“We think it’s a trap,” the twins answered together.
Severus nodded as he stood up from the bed and headed towards the bedroom door. He turned and frowned slightly at the pale werewolf, who didn’t hide his look of discomfort in time. “Goodnight, Remus. I’ll come in to check on you first thing in the morning.”
“Yes, of course, but...I....” Draco paled considerably, even with his nearly iridescent skin to begin with. Obviously, something was not right. He turned wide, frightened eyes back to Severus. “What’s happening, Sev?”
Hermione suddenly launched herself at Harry and wrapped her arms tightly around his neck. He could feel her petite frame shaking as she clung to him. “I love you,” she whispered into his ear, giving him one last firm squeeze before pulling away and wiping at her teary eyes.
Harry felt his heart drop, sensing the same panic from Snape beside him. “I...you – you don’t remember?” he asked in a quiet, pain filled voice. He had just talked to Draco when he’d entered his mind, and that Draco had heard everything Harry had poured out to him during the past three months. What went wrong, where did he mess up?
“Here goes nothing!” With a flash of green, the Astronomy Professor was through the floo and into the infirmary, where the real magic would happen.
“Don’t be shocked into ruining your potion, Harry,” the blonde whispered, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.
Severus stood up quickly and pulled his wand out. “That is indeed Malfoy Manor; the library, to be precise. I must go, Harry. From what you have told me, Draco Malfoy may be in great danger,” Severus explained.
“That’s not true! No, you couldn’t repeat the Prophecy word for word to anyone because you learned that from your Occlumency lessons with Potter, but everything that he just explained to you, you could surely run off and tell anyone you wanted. The way you both worded the Oath limits the protection greatly. It is not a matter of trusting you, but of what could be drawn out of you should you end up at the mercy of the Dark Lord or his followers again!” Severus snarled, his temper way beyond out of control now. Once he got started in on his rants, it was hard to stop.
Severus smiled as he felt Remus fish for his hand, holding it tightly in his own as the other man leaned comfortably against him much in the same way that Harry was. He let his head rest gently atop Harry’s, content to have the two people he loved most leaning against him, offering and taking comfort in one. “You’re welcome, Harry.”
maim or kill anyone this morning? No harmful spells means no
Dumbledore.
a right nice kick for me,” Ron said with a firm nod of his head. He scoffed as Hermione smacked him on the back of the head and stood from the table, gathering her books.
“He…er…he called me a poof,” Harry mumbled, feeling his face heat up as he uttered the word. He had never felt so uncomfortable with his sexuality before, especially in front of his father, no matter that the Potions Professor shared the same preferences. He had never felt ashamed of being gay before, and it felt terrible.
“My Lord, it is high time we move on with this plan. Malfoy’s betrayal and the capture of Bellatrix and Greyback are setting us back too much. It can only mean that the Order think they’ve got us right where they want us. We need to show them that
“Of course I’m really Harry – ”
“The Elder wand, or Death Stick, is infamous for its great power and the number of lives it has taken. The thirst for such power was so great that many have killed for a chance to be the master of such a wand. Instead of being passed down through family, it has passed through a line of power hungry, relentless wizards who have, ironically, almost all died by the very wand they possessed for a short time. The last of the wizards to kill for this powerful wand was none other than Grindelwald. When Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, he became the master of the Elder wand.”
Draco let the tears that had been burning at the back of his eyes fall, moving into his father’s arms and hugging him tightly. There was a deafening silence as everyone just looked on, their wands still trained on the elder Malfoy.
“I think that is a wonderful idea, Ms. Granger. Now do you all see the benefit of allowing these young adults to join?” Minerva asked with a pointed look at the few members who had raised concerns about letting the students join the Order.
“Don’t taunt her, Draco. That’s not fair,” Harry whispered as the blonde brought their rolled up tent over to Harry, who was waiting for him at the doors to the Great Hall.
After casting every detection spell they knew, Remus and Severus were about as frustrated as they’d ever been. None of their spells seemed to completely form, dissipating before they could take effect. Remus had even tried to undo whatever wards were obviously in place, but they slipped out of his grip every time he sensed them enough to cancel them.
Severus leaned forward once Remus had had his say and fixed all of the teens with a serious look. “I have always disagreed with Dumbledore’s policy of keeping you all in the dark, especially Harry. Black’s death might have been avoided had you all been included and informed, and though Albus never seemed to learn from his mistakes, the rest of us have. Harry and Draco will be of age within the next two months; that’s good enough for me. Unfortunately, as Remus said, I have no authority over the rest of you, although I will support you in gaining permission to join.”
“Just…just don’t tell anyone, yeah? Er, can you cast a silencing spell? I’m bollocks at them.”
“You’re going to question him?” Harry asked, surprised that Severus and the Headmaster would allow such a thing.
Severus closed his eyes for a second, but nodded slowly. “Yes, it could have been the Legilimency, but there is no way to tell. Do not blame yourself for this, Harry. We knew there were risks involved, and we were willing to take those risks. Draco is alive and conscious, that is what’s important. There is every chance that Draco will get his full memory back, all in due time. Do not beat yourself up over this,” said Severus, his tone stern, even though he completely understood Harry’s guilt; he felt it too.
share the same feelings.
Severus’ brows creased as he tried to figure out how that could be. How on earth could Rookwood have entered into the castle undetected, and where was the
“You’re not going anywhere, Remus. Please, I need you here tonight. There will be plenty of time for you to make your escape in the morning, but I need you right now.” Severus allowed himself to be engulfed in a hug, content to let Remus hold him close.
“I daresay you heard what we were discussing with Ms. Sinistra, Harry?” Remus asked, transferring a few pieces of toast onto a napkin and handing them to his son.
Draco blinked slowly at his godfather, feeling two other sets of eyes staring at him. He gulped down the dryness in his throat, wishing he could crawl under a rock and die, away from the prying eyes. “I’m tired, Severus…” he whispered, his voice hoarse and shaky.
S~S~S~S
“Remus is a bleeding heart. He has compassion for everyone and everything. I’m sure he even feels sorry for the Death Eaters at times. He’s worried and concerned about Tonks, and he wants to do whatever he can to help. Maybe he’s not just doing it for Dumbledore. Maybe he’s doing it for me, or himself, or just for Tonks. Information has been extremely scarce, and I think that leaving any lead unsearched is unwise when it comes to somebody’s life. I know you want him here, safe; so do I, but Remus is not weak, and he’s not stupid. He’ll be alright, just...maybe have more faith in
Harry was now beyond angry, his fists held shaking at his sides so he did not grab for his wand and simply curse Ron. “Professor Snape saved my life, Ron! If he can’t protect me, nobody can! You need to grow the hell up and get over personal grudges! We’re at war here, and we should be focusing all our efforts on fighting Voldemort and his Death Eaters, not each other!” Harry yelled, making a few people gasp or squeak in fright.
“Severus saved Harry’s life. During the summer when Harry was staying with Severus, his cover was blown during an Occlumency lesson, and Severus was almost killed by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. I was Polyjuiced as a Death Eater, spying on the inside, and I managed to get Severus away from them. I moved in a few days after, and Harry and I nursed him back to health and…and Severus and I became quite close. Draco Malfoy was exiled from his home and family after his mother was killed, and lived on the streets for months until he came to stay with Severus, Harry and I. Draco was nearly killed during an attack on Diagon Alley and ended up in a coma for months, which Harry and I awoke him from. He was amnesic and could not remember a thing for months, but Harry helped him to regain his self and memories once more. The two became quite close and have been dating since.” Remus stopped. He wasn’t sure how to go forward. So much had happened; he knew he was paraphrasing and grazing over the details so much that Sirius might not understand.
Harry clutched the resurrection stone in his first, ready to call forth Sirius and get everything in place. If their crazy planned worked, Voldemort would be dead tonight, for good this time. “I don’t think I’ll ever really be ready, Dad, but yeah, let’s get this started.”
“No, listen to me. I was scared, and so disgusted with myself that I thought you would never want to touch me again. How could you, after you saw what those men did to me? But then I realized, or rather Hermione
With that familiar, horrible sensation of being squeezed through a very tight tube, Remus and Harry were standing in the main atrium of St. Mungo’s, which bustled noisily. Remus directed Harry over to the Welcome Witch’s desk.
“What if someone else disarmed Voldemort and became master of the Elder wand, and then allowed Harry to disarm them in order to gain the wand’s allegiance. If Voldemort is unaware of the Elder wand’s loyalty to himself, he’d never know the difference,” Draco suggested to the group, although he could already see a glaring hole in that idea, but he’d wait for someone else to point it out.
Harry’s sluggish mind took a minute to realize Ron was talking about Ginny, and another to realize Ron had used his first name for the first time in weeks. He stood up and grabbed his bag, slinging it over his shoulder; he was too tired to deal with Ron’s crap at the moment. “I didn’t mean to make her cry, Ron, I was just upset with what she had said about Draco. I’m tired, I’m going home,” he said wearily.
“You don’t know what it’ll do to you, Severus. I prefer you live to see our daughter born. If Voldemort hadn’t have killed Dumbledore, the curse from that ring would have.”
“How dare you talk that way about my Master?! He is more of a man than you’ll ever be, bitty baby Potter!” Bellatrix shrieked as she pushed more and more force into her Cruciatus curse. Her eyes were blazing, and her hair practically crackled with the amount of magic she was pouring into her wand.
Remus gripped his husband’s hand tightly, letting out a shaky breath. There was no amount of time that could ever prepare him for this, and as much as he wished to let sleeping men lie, he knew they were out of options. It would be selfish of him to refuse, and there was no way he was going to put his discomfort and grief above Harry’s life, above the entire wizarding world. He took a deep breath and nodded slowly, finally meeting Severus’ eyes. “Ok, I’ll do it.”
told you he only takes an intern every four years. His last intern finished in our first year. They don’t stay the entire term, just long enough to garner Severus’ approval and get their recommendations. Lena Reginald left in November of our first year, and she was never in classes with the lower levels, only advanced potions,” Draco explained, his tone indicating that he thought Harry should know all of this already.
. It was too distinctly
and nodded slowly. “Tell him I need someone here to watch over Harry while I’m gone.” He flicked his wand and watched the silver doe gallop quickly away, making the room darker than before. “Dumbledore will be informed and someone will be here to watch over you soon. Do not attempt to leave for any reason, is that understood, Harry?” Severus asked as he wrapped his cloak around himself, slipping his wand into an inside pocket of his robes.
“Oh, of course! You’re welcome to go wherever you please. If you need anything at all, I’ll be glad to help. My name is Bridgette.”
Remus had been devastated with Black’s death. They had been lovers off and on since their Hogwarts years, and even went as far as a Joining of the Souls bonding ceremony mere months before the Animagus fought his final battle. It was understandable that Remus would be terribly uncomfortable at a funeral, but
S~S~S~S
Harry stopped his pacing and fell back into his seat, frustrated beyond belief now. How
“You know as well as I do that Lucius has been able to skirt questions under Veritaserum before. I don’t think it would be wise to peruse the Pensieve just yet. What I’d like is to speak with the man myself,” Severus said, pausing in his pacing with a look on concentration on his face.
“Hey Hermione. Have I been gone that long? Sorry, I just needed a minute,” Harry said distractedly. In his lap was a very nice black cloak with a filigree clasp. His hands were tangled in the material as he stared at the Black Family tapestry.
S~S~S~S
“What do I tell them?”
Severus let out a quiet growl as he spun around and glared at Remus as if this was all his fault. He was angry and looking for any outlet, apparently. “Fine, he can stay one more week if he wants, but I cannot. I’ll return to Hogwarts early and Lupin can babysit the brat until school starts again.”
“I’m sorry, Draco, I won’t do it anymore. Do...do you remember anything else, has anything come back yet?” Harry asked tentatively, knowing he was playing with fire but too curious not to ask. He was sure Draco had remembered something of their rivalry, and that was why the Slytherin was acting so surly towards him.
Harry shared a look with his friends and knew they all were thinking the same thing; it was time they were included in the Order once and for all, and this time they wouldn’t take no for an answer, no matter how much the adults protested against their involvement.
“I love you,” Severus whispered, leaning up and gently covering Remus’ lips with his own, coaxing him into a deeper kiss, the kind that soothed his soul and made him forget about his problems, if only for a minute.
Harry took a moment to think before holding up seven fingers to count them off. “Interrupted concentration, relapse of memory, foreign emotions, lack of blinking, sense of foreboding, quickly shifting thoughts, and strain on your powers.”
you do such a stupid thing and then expect everything to be ok!
“When will these storm clouds stop following you around, eh?”
The third flame was the brightest yet, entwining with the braided flames, then soaking into the skin of Severus’ and Dumbledore’s hands.
Severus nodded slowly, thinking over a good response to that. “And I apologize for acting the way I did in the first place. I should not have been so hard on Harry. I fear my paranoia from years of espionage will never fade. I should not have said that you couldn’t protect Harry, either – ”
“I saw that you received a letter from the Headmaster. When is the meeting?” Severus asked, only slightly thrown off by the random mix of students currently inhabiting the Gryffindor table, including quite a few of his Slytherins.
“It’s Mss. Smithson-Gray, actually. My husband passed just after my daughter was born, but I usually just stick to my maiden name now. Painful memories, you know. Well, I must be getting on my way. I have rounds in the children’s clinic this evening. I should be back tomorrow to see how the first day is going. Have a good evening, Poppy, and you too, Severus.”
“Do you know what curse it was, Remus?” Hermione asked, of course always the curious one. He admired he thirst for knowledge, and though he wasn’t sure how comfortable Severus would be with this information becoming public, Remus thought he might be able to use her help.
“Well, there is one other person that could help you. Remus has informed me that he’s horrible at Occlumency, so he won’t be able to help, but Draco is a very good Occlumens as well as Legilimens. He was taught from a very young age through a combination of his father’s instruction and my own. If I can persuade him, he would be an excellent replacement for my teaching you,” Severus explained, already dreading the sceptical look that was on Harry’s face.
It was a week until Hogwarts was to start up again, and both Harry and Draco had received their Hogwarts letters the morning before. The four occupants of the Bristol Cottage set off on a mission to Diagon Alley to get their supplies as quickly and inconspicuously as possible.
“What are you two bickering about this early in the morning?” Harry asked incredulously, running a hand through his helplessly rumpled hair. He was amused by their sheepish expressions, but he tried to hide it.
, Harry had felt as though he had damaged his relationship with Snape, and it would never be the same again. The guilt ate at his insides like a violent acid. Harry shuddered as his father fixed him with an intense look.
“I’m ok,” was all Harry said, and it was all they needed to hear. It had been a very long night for them all.
“I can’t find my book bag. I thought I left it against the wall when we moved the desks, but it’s not there.” Harry moved closer to Remus, looking around to make sure everyone else was otherwise occupied. “My cloak was in that bag, Moony,” he whispered with a worried look.
was not above attacking while his opponent’s back was turned.
“Friends?”
“Where are my glasses and wand?”
The Headmaster of Hogwarts raised his head slowly, looking up into blazing red eyes, the last eyes he would ever see, and smiled. “He does...Oh yes, Tom, he does.”
Severus sighed as he leaned back against the couch. He knew what Harry’s reaction would have been, yet he still didn’t have any other solution. Harry had been improving drastically before Severus had been detained by the Dark Lord, but he still wasn’t as good as he could be. He wanted to help Harry, but the boy would need to stop being so stubborn. Suddenly, an idea occurred to Severus that just might solve this problem.
“As you’ve all been informed, Lucius Malfoy has defected to the side of the Light. Dire circumstances, plus a change of heart, have changed his loyalties, and he has made an Unbreakable Vow to me that he will never rejoin Voldemort, he will do everything in his power to help us win this war, and he will give any information he knows about Voldemort’s plans.
Severus’ mind immediately flashed back with stark detail to the moment when he took the Unbreakable Vow five year previous...
“Oh yes, I’m just giddy with pride,” Severus snapped, glaring at Remus as the werewolf tried to hide his laugh with his tea cup. He tried to let his anger radiate, pushing away the melancholy creeping up on him as he thought about Draco’s still and prone form lying in a stark white hospital bed.
“I swear, Headmaster! The portrait was speaking Greek, thoroughly confusing my Prefects and other students when they’d try to get through. Did Severus not report to you the incident in which Mr. Potter nearly plummeted to his death?”
Remus was writing everything down, as well as overlooking a self-recording quill, while Severus and Lucius ran the questioning. Harry was allowed to interject with his own questions at any point if he felt the need to. So far, he felt no need.
you! Remus has done nothing to deserve such, such
Harry finally pulled away and wiped the tears from his cheeks, laughing slightly as Remus did the same. This was proving to be a very emotional Christmas indeed, and he knew it wasn’t going to stop there, either. He reached for another package, feeling his heart beat double time as he handed it to Severus. He was so nervous; he was surprised no one else could hear his heart pounding.
, after all, and most of the population in Hogwarts tended to believe everything printed in the Wizarding paper.
Harry sighed heavily, feeling so relieved that he felt weak from it. He sat down on the sofa, motioning for Remus to join him.
…” An outline of a door glowed around the wall for a few seconds before an actual door appeared and clicked open. Harry was afraid Snape would have heard the click out of paranoia, but the Potions Master did not come out to investigate.
Harry was pouring himself a glass of pumpkin juice and pulling a plate of eggs towards him as he eyed the scroll curiously. “What internship?”
“Are you alright, Draco? Merlin, I thought those chains were going to suffocate you.” Harry quickly turned on Ron, who looked frightened of his own spell work. “What the
Harry watched with his jaw hanging open as his father made his way to the other side of the classroom to check the progress of Ron’s and Hermione’s potions. He was snapped out of it by Draco, who nudged him with his elbow.
“Does it still hurt when Voldemort calls the other Death Eaters to him?” Harry asked, not really thinking before he opened his mouth. He blushed as he realized what a personal and probably upsetting question that had been. “Er...sorry...”
There was a long, not too uncomfortable silence before they all jumped nearly out of their skin as Dobby popped in with trays of food.
“You want to call Sirius back.”
“I’m positive, Remus. I talked to him about the sleeping draughts, and he went to bed around half-nine. I’ve been sitting out there marking papers since then; I would have seen him leave. Something isn’t right, Remus. I can feel it,” Severus said in a pleading tone, trying extremely hard now not to go into a panic.
“Er…” Harry blushed as he let go of Draco and made his way over to the bed they had been sharing. He hadn’t meant to tell his father, it had just slipped out. He wasn’t sure how Draco was going to react.
S~S~S~S
Harry glared at the blonde and directed their trunks to sit off to the side while he began doing his own measuring to help with the altering spells. “I had no idea there was a spell to set up tents, thank you very much. How did
Severus locked the door and silenced the room with his wand, staring at his son, who looked ill and scared. “You knew about this, didn’t you, Harry?” he asked in a carefully controlled, quiet voice.
Severus pulled his hand away from Remus and took out his wand, muttering a counter-charm to the glamour concealing the battered bracelet still hanging unseen from his wrist. He turned the round charm so that the initials ‘L.E.’ could be seen. “Lily wasn’t the only one who never took it off,” Severus whispered as he fingered the charm reverently.
“I’m fine, Hermione. Dumbledore is fairly ancient, and it was bound to happen. The timing is just a little inconvenient. He’s going to start meeting with me nearly every night to share pensieve memories of what he knows. It’s more complicated than just information about him, and that’s why I can’t tell Dad or Remus,” Harry said, his words heavy with meaning.
“The whole thing doesn’t need to go in, Ron, only the scythe. That’s what Professor Dumbledore told Harry.”
“Heir’s Duty? Forgive me, Draco, but you know I am not all too familiar with the pure-blood customs, as I was raised by a Muggle father. Elaborate, if you would?” Severus asked patiently, a little irritated that he didn’t know about a branch of magic. He was very proud of his intelligence when it came to obscure magic, but he apparently missed the lesson on this one.
Snape, and it made Harry feel a bit ill at ease. That last sentence alone was proof enough that, whoever this savior was, there was no way in Merlin’s name it was Severus Snape.
Severus moved forward, a faint smile on his lips. He held out the tea and potion as if it were some sort of peace offering. “I figured you could use some tea and a nice Pepper-Up Potion to start the day,” he said as he passed the two items off.
Remus sighed as he swept a lock of hair out of his eyes. It was clearly obvious that Harry had grown quite attached to the Potions Master. Well, they shared something else in common, then. “He’s in the sitting room filling out the adoption application still.”
Snape is a good teacher when he wants to be.”
Severus scoffed as he gripped the edge of the bathroom counter, trying not to take out his fury and pain on his husband, knowing that the man was feeling the same things he was. “Obviously Harry wanted to die, seeing as how he killed himself,” Severus snapped.
that feeling from the Potions Master to survive. “Thank you, sir. I…You’re right, I don’t want the fame – I never have, and never will. I mean, if it ends up being useful in the war as a sort of propaganda technique, then I guess I’ll use it to my advantage, but other than that, I wish everyone would just let me live my life in peace. Especially Rita Skeeter.”
Harry had just raised his cup of tea to his lips when the flames roared in the fireplace and Snape stepped out, his cloak covered in soot. He looked distressed and just a tad bit more pale than usual, and that was saying something when it came to Snape’s vampire-esque visage. Harry was afraid to say anything, so he stayed quiet and Snape began to pace. He didn’t expect what came next; Snape was actually venting – to Harry.
“We’re going to start with a Potion from your O.W.L.s today just to make sure you’re all awake and up to this classes standards. This will be a solo potion, no helping each other. Whoever completes their potion correctly and hands it in the quickest will win a prize, which you’ll learn of when the winner is determined. Directions are on the board, you have two hours to work.” Severus flicked his wand and the directions to the Draught of Living Death appeared on the board, before sweeping over to his desk and sitting behind it, pulling parchment towards him immediately to fill out a point sheet. The new rules about house points were designed with him in mind, he knew. Even though points would automatically be taken or given when a Professor or Prefect spoke the words, a point sheet had to be filled out with the amount of points, the student who lost or gained the points, and the reasoning for punishment or reward by the separate Heads of House. It was up to the Heads to revoke and reward points when they felt the reasons were not justified enough for them. However, Severus was clever and good with words, so no matter what the reason, he knew his rewarding and revocations would stick.
Dumbledore beamed at the Potions Master and nodded, clapping his hands together once in excitement. “Very well, I will meet with Harry and discuss his moving to the Dungeons with him to set it all in motion.” Dumbledore sobered as he looked fondly at Severus, his eyes becoming watery. “You will never know just how much this means to me, Severus. To know that you and Harry will have each other…it puts this old man’s heart at ease, and it surely gives me hope for the future. You are as good as my own son, and I am proud of you, Severus.”
Not knowing what else to do with so much running through his mind, Harry screamed at the top of his lungs for his father, who he hoped desperately was in their quarters only a few feet away from Draco’s room.
A faint knock on the bedroom door proceeded Harry’s entering, tip-toeing as to not wake the dozing werewolf in case he was asleep. One look from Remus told him that he was fully awake, and not very happy because of it.
Tonks turned quickly as she saw a flash of blue light fly around the corner towards the group of people congregated around the stone gargoyles. Everyone paused as they waited for something – what, Harry wasn’t sure.
Severus closed his book and set it aside, leaning forward with his fingers intertwined in front of him. That disdainful, almost mournful look on Harry’s face hit far too close to home for Severus, who knew exactly the emotions the boy was feeling. He knew it certainly didn’t feel good, either. “Trust me, Harry, I know how that feels.” He paused as he studied the teen’s worried face, which looked much too old to belong to a sixteen year old. “We are far more alike than I think we both realize. Whether or not that is a good thing is yet to be determined, I guess.”
Harry was slightly bemused why Snape would care about Hermione’s outburst, but he decided to humour the man anyways. “Rita Skeeter wrote another stupid article about me, but this time she drug Hermione into again just like in fourth year. We’re all well shot of the annoying woman, but she hit too sensitive a nerve in Hermione, I guess.”
injuring Zabini just then.
“What I want to know is if the whole thing is a Horcrux, or if it’s just the eyes. I guess we should destroy the whole thing, just to be safe, after all. The problem is; how on earth are we to do that?”
“He said to tell you he’ll be a bit late. Zabini and Nott tried to nick my book bag in class, so he’s taking them to Dumbledore for their punishments,” Harry said as he continued to focus on his Transfiguration essay, which was due the next day.
“No, it’s my job to feel that guilt, because it’s my fault,” Severus said quietly, looking away from Remus. It would always come full circle, he knew. He’d never escape what he did, no matter how guilty he felt or what he did to make up for it. Nothing could change the past and he would always be reminded of that.
“Father…
Harry felt himself bristle at Snape’s words, realizing just then that this was still the snarky Potions Master and entertaining the idea that the man had changed was foolish indeed. “You didn’t mind that I was a ‘
“What do you care if I die?” Remus muttered, knowing how awfully dramatic that sounded, but not really caring.
“Why won’t anyone tell me what happened, or where Mother and Father are?” Draco asked in a hoarse whisper. He looked so young and innocent, it was hard to see the real Draco Malfoy in there at all.
Severus swallowed the lump in his throat, his cheeks burning in shame. He wasn’t ashamed of being with Remus, of course not. He was ashamed that he had forced the man out of the picture due to his own fears. Mrs. Luther had been completely right; he had treated Remus like some dirty little secret, and it wasn’t fair.
Draco wasn’t quite convinced, but he let it slide. He had something he wanted to ask Harry anyways. “So, I had this really vivid dream last night, but I don’t know if it was a memory, or really just a dream. I was hoping you’d be able to tell me if it was real or not?”
Harry sighed as he scratched out a sentence on his essay for the third time, highly distracted by the thoughts swirling around in his head. He should have known Hermione would have come to the same conclusion as he did. “You’re forgetting one thing, Hermione; Ron and Ginny hate me. I don’t want to cause more problems in their family by trying to insinuate myself into their lives when, clearly, they want nothing to do with me anymore.”
“I think it’s quite possible. The orphanage was where he grew up, which is definitely significant, and he had a special connection to that blanket. Doesn’t it make sense for him to hide one there, be it the blanket or something else?” Hermione said, sounding far too logical. Her intelligence never ceased to amaze the three boys in the room.
Severus and Harry reluctantly pulled away and moved from the bed so that the matron could do her job, running diagnostics, administering potions and clucking like a mother hen. Remus looked exactly as if he was being fussed over by an overbearing mother, which made sense; Madam Pomfrey had been the one to fetch Remus from the Shrieking Shack all those years and heal the wounds he would inflict on himself.
Severus felt himself relax minutely, not even aware that he had been so stressed by the notion of not being near Draco during the school year. “I would very much appreciate that, Albus. Thank you.”
“I love you too, Draco, and I meant it too. Do you want me to go with you?” Harry asked as he pulled reluctantly away from the embrace. He’d never seen Draco look so strong and determined before, and he knew without a doubt that he would have his way, no matter what.
“The problem is figuring out what and where,” his twin added.
Remus was sitting on a crumbling old stone bench that overlooked a stone fountain that would have been beautiful if it had been taken care of properly. Instead, the stones were covered in moss and wild vines and the cherub at the top of the fountain was weather worn and chipped. Severus’ nose crinkled as he smelt a pungent order as he came up behind his husband, and rolled his eyes as he watched a trail of smoke travel up and into the air.
Severus looked up to meet Remus’ eyes with a questioning expression, his stomach squirming slightly by the gold reflected there. “Yes?”
“Since I’m not of age yet, I’m going to stay sober and make sure none of you drunken hooligans kill yourselves. Your dad also provided us with enough Sobering potions to sober everyone in the room up in less than a minute,” Ginny explained as she gestured to a small potions rack in the corner that held several small vials of violet liquid.
“Draco? What is it?” Severus asked, noticing slightly belatedly that the boy was deathly pale and looked beyond horrified. His bed-head wasn’t that scary, was it?
“I’m going to lie down for a bit; I’m not feeling too good. Wake me if any news comes?” he asked, feeling slightly guilty by the hurt look in Tonks watery eyes.
Severus stood up and shook out his black robes, checking the clock and realizing that they were both soon going to be late. “I’ll get you that sleeping draught tonight, and possibly some Calming draught to take the edge off your insomnia. We’re going to be late, so I suggest you hurry up and get dressed.”
“That’s completely unfair! You’re not single. Why would you lie like that?” Harry asked as he refused to walk any further towards their dungeon quarters. He couldn’t believe Severus would actually lie about his relationship with Remus. He knew Severus was a very personal man, but to be so ashamed as to lie about it on the adoption application? He never knew the shame went so far.
Draco slammed his fork down, upsetting the pitcher of pumpkin juice and sloshing the orange liquid everywhere. “No,
Defense Against The Dark Arts- Outstanding
Remus stopped at the top of the stairs and caught Severus’ around the waist, pulling him close as the others continued down unawares. “Did you say everything you needed to say?”
Severus, Remus, Draco, Hermione, Ron and the rest of Weasleys were the obvious recipients. What about his other dorm mates, or Hagrid and Professor McGonagall? Should he write to his unborn sister? Should he leave a statement to release to the public?
On the complete opposite side of the graveyard, Draco and Lucius were already locked in battle with Mulciber and Avery. Despite charming their hair black, the Malfoys were too recognizable, especially to Death Eaters bent on revenge. The savage pair had gone after Draco and Lucius almost immediately, laughing maniacally as they dueled the elder and younger Malfoys.
Harry could not sleep, no matter how hard he tried. His new room in Snape’s quarters was really nice and fairly large, but it was much too quiet, and always cold. He loved having his own bathroom, and his desk was loaded with whatever supplies he could possibly ask for. So far, his experience with living in the dungeons was going good, and his Occlumency lessons with Snape were starting to improve drastically as they continued.
“Harry Potter,” Peter whispered, his eyes back on Harry, who felt his heart jump into his throat and then plummet down to his toes in less than a second.
,” he grounded out through gritted teeth.
“Remus, may I have a word with you; privately?” Dumbledore asked as he stood from the table and gestured toward the kitchen door. He waited for Remus to pass in front of him before following him out, leaving Harry alone with Tonks.
Remus suddenly let go of Harry and turned his full attention onto the shelf of Hogwarts texts. This was it; Harry was right. The counter curse was probably in plain sight, they’d just been looking too hard. He started grabbing the books that were all fifth year level and above and started a stack, handing books around to each person.
Sirius looked a little hesitant at first, but then shrugged and reached for the cup. His hand closed over the rim of the cup as he lifted it from Severus’ hand, and then twirled it around so he could grasp the handle. There was no fumbling or risk of it falling through; it was as though Sirius were actually there.
“Now, Harry, the first memory I want to show you is my own recollection of the first time I met young Tom Riddle. I hand delivered his letter as the Deputy Headmaster at the time, which used to be quite customary for students who grew up in the Muggle world, unaware of their magical heritage.”
“Will you let me know what that silver lining may be?” Severus asked desperately, finding it extremely hard to meet the Headmaster’s eyes. He didn’t want to see that twinkle, or watch as it slowly burned out into a dull, empty gaze.
Severus gave a small smile in return as he gently grasped Harry’s shoulder before speaking the password to enter their dungeon quarters. He immediately caught Remus’ eye as his lover set his book aside and stood to meet him at the door.
“You know what I mean, Harry,” Draco hissed with narrowed eyes. Severus and Remus had moved on to talk to Kingsley, while Hermione tactfully walked away and pulled Fred and George into a conversation about their improved Day Dream potion formula.
Severus allowed his arms to wrap around his husband, pulling him close into a tight embrace. How had he ever lived without this? Without love? “I’ll never be able to say everything I need to love, but that’s ok. I said what I could for now.”
He was wandless in the middle of a forest with three Death Eaters, given that two of them were indisposed, but that wasn’t the biggest problem. This man was his boyfriend’s father, someone he knew that Draco loved, despite all of the things the man had done. If something were to happen to the older Malfoy, Harry wouldn’t lose any sleep over it, but Draco would be devastated. As little as he wanted to admit it, Harry knew he had to make sure that, whatever happened, Lucius Malfoy would make it out alive.
Harry gasped as Bellatrix’s palm made stark contact with his cheek. The bitingly cold air made the slap sting that much more, but Harry just grit his teeth and turned his face away from the werewolf, who had circled around to face him.
“We need to wake Draco.”
This was it; Harry couldn’t lie to them. “Dumbledore is...ill. He’s not doing too well, and he’s starting to pass all the information he knows to me so that I can take over after he...goes.”
Harry’s eyebrows rose as he cocked his head curiously to the side. Snape had owed his father a Life Debt? That was news to him. “How did my father save your life? That’s the only way to form a Life Debt, right?” Harry asked as he curled his legs up on the bed and made himself a bit more comfortable.
A few days later, another Order meeting had come and gone, without very much productive or helpful information, but a bolstering of spirits as Mad-Eye Moody announced that a couple of unimportant Death Eaters had been caught trying to break-in to the Ministry’s Records Department.
“Guys, I think we’ve been making this more complicated than it has to be,” Harry spoke up across the heated argument around him.
Everyone in the room laughed, and the intensity increased as Severus pulled out a chair for Aurora, and instructed Remus to firecall the infirmary and ensure that poppy was ready for the procedure. Once everything was in order, Severus popped the cork on the vial and held it up, looking to his husband with a gentle smile.
Harry just cried harder, and his father’s grip tightened as he held his son close. Harry was glad that the Potions Professor just let him cry, not trying to tell him that everything would be alright. Empty words were not a comfort to Harry, and somehow, Severus knew that.
“I want the forest searched right away. Harry’s recurring dream took place in the forest. I have a bad feeling that, once again, Harry’s nightmares are coming true,” Severus said, taking as much comfort as he could in Remus’ hand trailing up and down his back.
S~S~S~S
The last thing the Potions Master saw before he lost consciousness was the blonde hair of a sixteen-year-old girl, sprayed with his own blood, her terrified eyes wide in death, and all he could think of was how he could have saved her.
A soft blue glow illuminated Remus’ chest as the spell took effect. He flicked his wand once more, and the blue glow left his wand to linger in the air. With a determined look and a confident tone in his voice, he waved his wand at the glow. “
“We’d love to spread discord,” quipped George.
“No, Harry! Don’t do it,” Remus exclaimed, putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder as if to keep him from moving towards Snape.
me. I’ll try to be quieter,” Draco said in an undertone, his voice a slight bit frostier than he had intended for it to be. He shouldn’t being taking things out on Hermione; none of his problems were her fault.
Severus sniffed irritably as he turned his face away from Remus and Harry both. “Harry, would you make me some tea, please?” he asked, not wanting the Gryffindor to see him so very emotional and vulnerable.
Severus looked up at Remus and purposefully pretended like he couldn’t see Potter hanging around in the background out of the corner of his eye. “I don’t know anything yet. They took him back and told me to stay here. Said they’d send someone out with any new developments,” Severus explained in a strained voice as he ran a hand through his hair for the hundredth time since letting Draco out of his sight.
Was he such a horrible father that his son would willingly suffer alone and take his own life without even trying to go to him to help assuage his fears and worries? Sure, he wasn’t Harry’s biological father, and he hadn’t been a father for very long, but he had thought that Harry would at least speak to him about his depression and thoughts of suicide before taking the ultimate step.
!” Severus shouted as he paced in front of the fireplace. He hadn’t really paid much heed to who he was talking to, he simply just started yelling.
your fault, Harry! We made sure everything was planned precisely and things still went wrong. Someone else is to blame; someone let the plans slip to the Dark Lord or the Death Eaters. You didn’t have a choice; you
“I don’t want that, either. I want everyone protected the same, but I’m going to be Voldemort’s main target. You’d only be in more danger with me. I don’t even want Dad using himself as bait, but I can’t convince him otherwise; trust me, I’ve tried.”
“I did not trust Lucius at all, and was very much against all of it at first. I fought it, hard, but Lucius started telling us about these crazy plans that Voldemort had come up with to essentially round up all the muggle-borns and use a potion to strip them of their magical abilities and use them as an Imperioused army.”
The cake was very detailed, and in acid green letters in read ‘Happy Birthday Professor Snape, sir!’ Harry laughed at the incredulous look on his father’s face, accepting the plates and forks that Dobby had popped back in to deliver.
“The last question I will ask of you, Harry, is how you feel about Severus’ past association with the Dark Arts, and the group of terrorists who are the self-appointed Death Eaters.”
“No, I’d want him to keep it to himself. Actually, I would prefer that Harry had never seen it either. I don’t know how he can even look at me without being completely disgusted. But it’s alright, he won’t have to anymore. I broke up with him this morning,” Draco said, his resolve even more secure as he thought about it all over again. Harry would never have to feel dirty by being with him; he had saved him from that, at least.
Harry had the mother of all headaches. He was half listening to the argument going on between Draco, Moody and Kingsley about finding a way around the twin wand cores, considering the Elder wand would be useless to Harry since Voldemort was its master. They’d come up with any number of plans that had holes, gaping ones that would most likely get multiple killed. Switching wands with others, disarming Voldemort to gain mastery of the Elder wand, using the Elder wand anyways; everything they came up with included a body count.
What woke Severus up was someone coming in through his Floo. Since only certain Order members, himself, and Dumbledore were the only ones keyed into his wards, he had slim pickings to guess who it was. As he sat up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes, he saw the kindly old Headmaster of Hogwarts smiling at him from across the room.
Harry blushed at the implications of viewing his dreams first, but nodded as he took the small orb from his father and examined the glass sphere. It felt surprisingly warm in his hand, and almost seemed like it was pulsing.
“He was there for me when nobody else was. The entire time I was in a coma, Harry was there, talking to me, helping me not go insane. He looked for a way to bring me out of it, and eventually did pull me out of it. He helped me try to regain my memories, and tutored me on everything I had forgotten in school. Harry was a friend when I felt completely alone, especially after losing Mum. Falling in love with him just felt as natural and as essential to me as breathing. It was so easy, it was subconscious, and it was required for me to keep on living. I didn’t really care or pay attention to the fact that he was a boy, or that he was
Harry smiled sadly at the Slytherin as he pulled him into a tight hug, kissing him gently on the lips. “I don’t want you to have to give up so much for me, Draco.”
“You still want to be an Auror, even after all this crap with the Dark Lord and Death Eaters?”
The Potions Master turned sharply to the werewolf and gave him a withering look, one that would certainly never betray that he was actually married to the man. “I understand that, Remus, but I can only reassure him so many times. We are running out of time, and I cannot continue to coddle him if we want this done sometime this century.”
Remus grasped Severus’ hand, pausing the violent rubbing immediately with a disapproving frown. “I told you not to do that anymore. You know it won’t help, nor will it make it disappear. Someday, Sev, someday we’ll find a way to get rid of it.”
Harry was staying quiet, not quite approving or disapproving of the situation so far. Though he agreed that capturing Pettigrew was a good idea, he wasn’t sure if the snivelling man would in fact have anything valuable to reveal. He wasn’t getting his hopes up, just in case Pettigrew was as worthless as Harry suspected.
Harry bit his lip to keep it from trembling as he blinked back the moisture. No one seemed to realize just how much danger he was putting them in. They were all willing to find a way to fix him. He had never felt quite as loved as he did in that moment, and finally slumped sideways into Draco’s arms, sighing in relief as the blonde held him tightly.
“Your spine was
The Gryffindor Head of House nodded briskly, pulling her wand out and holding it concealed at her side. She gave it a small twirl, and five blue shots of light went in five different directions down the corridor and through the walls of the castle. “I’ve sent a message to put the Order on alert. I’ll stay here until you get back with Professor Snape. Come straight back here, Harry, and bring only Severus, and Remus if he is near.”
when Snape did that, which was usually every time he woke up late.
“Severus, I didn’t even know you were awake. I silenced the curtain so that we wouldn’t disturb you. You need to take your potions, love. Harry is fine.”
“But there are wards around the Hogwarts grounds! The Death Eaters can’t get close enough to attack us during a match!” Ron complained loudly, the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team nodding vigorously up and down the table.
“Have a safe trip, Aurora.”
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione in a shaking voice. It was almost as though she already knew, but was afraid to ask for confirmation of her suspicions. Harry wouldn’t doubt it. Smartest witch of her age, indeed.
was calling for a change in power, things were pretty bad. Knowing he’d never be left alone if he kept resolutely refusing, Kingsley finally let out a press release that he was considering the position, should Fudge be impeached. The only reason he was bothering with any of it was because of the bad press that was starting to crop up concerning Harry.
A few other Order members showed up as well, such as Kingsley, Mad-Eye Moody, Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, Percy (which nearly caused Molly to burst into tears once more), and a couple of guests Harry had not been expecting at all.
Remus stood from the settee, the smile infectious as it spread across his face too. “It’s done, the potion’s been perfected?” he asked in an excited voice. Harry was beaming at his parents from his spot on the sofa, feeling no shame in the wetness that sprung to his eyes as the Potions Master nodded. He carefully set the potion aside before being engulfed in a hug by his husband and thoroughly kissed.
Before Harry could express his shock at Hermione’s admission, Remus Lupin entered the classroom, carrying his trusty battered briefcase along with him. The entire classroom broke out into whispered conversations, some students blatantly pointing at the returning Professor.
“The Headmaster is positive that the altered Latin in Zabini’s casting is what allowed the cursed object to enter into the wards without being detected. That, and the way in which the curse affected you did not strike the wards as necessarily harmful. They were essentially dreams. What troubles me the most, however, is that the object was also a portkey. I’ve researched wards that will detect any kind of portkey or other charmed talisman that may put you in danger. I plan to cast them on our quarters straight away when I find the right ones. How are you feeling, Harry?”
magic, Draco let it go, for the most part.
“When I heard what the Dark Lord’s diary did to the young Weasley girl, I was horrified. I had no idea what would happen, and to be honest, I was simply trying to rid myself of it. I cannot say I was thinking correctly in giving young Ms. Weasley the book, but I never anticipated what it would do to her. I promised myself to stay low after that. Much too soon, he was back once more. That night in the graveyard, I think I might have been even more terrified than you were. I had anticipated his return, of course, but I hoped beyond hope that it would never happen. I did what I was commanded to do, however, in order to keep my wife and son safe from retaliation, should I disobey.
“Not being able to cast on the first try is perfectly normal. That you produced that much light vapour on the first go shows that the memory you chose was indeed powerful. Very few people can cast a Patronus, with the exception of a lot of people in this room. Even fully trained adult witches and wizards cannot cast a corporeal Patronus. It takes not only skill, but a certain mindset. In the complicated theory of the spell, your Patronus is supposed to not only symbolize your soul, but who or what you think of as a safe-haven, or gives you protection. Are you sure the memory you chose is your utmost happiest?” Harry asked, smiling as Ginny cast her horse Patronus with her partner beside them. It galloped around Draco’s head for a minute before fading.
“Yes?” Harry answered, sticking his head out the door while Draco quickly pulled his shirt and tie back on out of sight.
Remus quietly exited his shared room and began to tiptoe to the kitchen for a small bite to eat. He hadn’t been sleeping very well again, and his blackened emotions as of late had kept him from joining the others at dinner that night. He turned as he felt someone’s eyes upon him. Harry was blinking at him in the dark, his face expressionless, eerily reminding Remus of the often expressionless face Sirius had acquired after many years of suppressing his emotions in Azkaban. He slowly walked over to the Gryffindor teen’s bed and sat on the edge, peering thoughtfully at him. “Can’t sleep either?”
S~S~S~S~S
“Yes, I do. But that does not make me incapable of loving you too. Sirius was my first love, but he’s gone, and he’s not coming back. I’ve accepted that. But the possibility of his name being cleared is opening up old wounds that I thought had healed. You’re right; I’ve been quick to snap at you and be angry with you, when it’s really myself I’m angry with. I’m sorry, Severus.”
“I am never oblivious to my surroundings, Albus. I am simply too paranoid not to notice if doors started opening and closing seemingly on their own,” Severus snapped, his patience quickly wearing thin. The longer they stood and discussed things, the further away his son could be.
let that happen, but it is too dangerous for you to go with. I will be too distracted to keep an eye out and protect you. I know this is hard, but please be patient and
“Remus?”
He felt bad that he was shirking his duties, so to speak, but he was also glad for the help and support from his friends and family. As much as Harry had wanted to follow Dumbledore’s advice and only tell Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes, that just wasn’t plausible. They didn’t have time to play games and keep secrets, sneaking around and being deceitful. They needed to do whatever they could to get rid of Voldemort quickly, and for that, Harry needed help.
Severus turned back to his calmly waiting

“It wasn’t fast enough, in my opinion. How that man
He tried to imagine his life without the Slytherin, and he felt his heart nearly stop in his chest, panic stricken just at the thought. He was hopelessly attached, smitten to the highest degree. He did love Draco, and he’d been a fool for not realizing it before.
It was during one these brainstorming sessions two days after finding the counter-curse to Sectumsempra that Harry heard a voice he had feared he’d never hear again. It was more beautiful than phoenix song.
Ron’s face was dangerously red, and his blue eyes were blazing in anger as he tried to shake Hermione’s hand off of his arm. “You’ve lost your fucking mind, Potter. I dunno who brain washed you, but somebody obviously did. Have a nice year with the greasy git and the snakes; I’ll have no part in it.” Ron walked away, bumping Harry’s shoulder painfully as he went.
Percy looked up as Molly drew reluctantly away from her third born. He definitely looked quite dreadful. His eyes were blood shot, he had lost too much weight, his skin was very sallow, and his hair seemed to just wither. His expression was deeply sad and pleading as he took a step towards his siblings.
Harry felt a sort of thrill when he realized that Draco remembered this owl, he knew who she was. He was starting to remember more and more, and as much as that scared him, he also wanted Draco to have all of his memories back. He held the scroll close to him as Draco placed the owl back on the armchair, giving her one last pet before moving back towards Harry.
Lucius Malfoy hardly looked like an escaped convict, except perhaps for some weight loss. His robes were still crisp and graceful, and his blonde hair – so like Draco’s that Harry shuddered – was shining and luscious as ever. His piercing gray eyes narrowed as Harry took a step back, but he didn’t make any moves towards him.
“Harry!” Severus shouted as he jumped quickly from his seat and moved around the coffee table. He kneeled down beside the Gryffindor, dropping his wand as he pulled the too-thin teen half into his lap and turned his pale face towards him. “Harry, can you hear me? Open your eyes!”
Draco’s jaw dropped as he knocked over his cup of tea. “What?! That’s so unfair! Why does he always get the magical gifts? He’s a Parselmouth, a natural Legilimens, a bloody brilliant Quidditch player, and he’s the most famous Wizard in Britain – ”
“Yes, sir, though I’m not sure in which adjunct department this is taking place. Unspeakables are not exactly known for their gossiping. I’ll see what I can do about finding out who’s in charge, and also finding out who this French Potions Master fellow is.”
“Look what you’ve done, you’ve frightened him,” said an amused voice from the other side of the bed. Harry looked over. Ah, Remus.
Harry blinked and looked away from Snape, almost feeling like his gaze was a rubber-band being pulled away from something. He blinked a few times before grinning as he looked up at Snape. “You’re lying. Your underpants are black.”
“What in Merlin’s name?” said Severus as he sat up slowly in his bed. There was a faint buzzing noise coming from the general direction of his writing desk in the corner of his quarters at Hogwarts.
The temporary infirmary was not far from where his and Draco’s tent was set up, and it only took a minute or two for Harry to get there. He quietly spoke the password allowing family members in, and slipped into the little curtained off area that housed the Potions Master.
Harry allowed the hug to go on for at least a minute or two, hugging back just as fiercely. He knew they were running out of time, so he pulled away, however reluctantly. “I need you to clear your mind completely except for us. Do you trust me?”
“Alright, I’ll take the Oath,” Draco said breathlessly after Harry pulled out of the kiss. He looked slightly rumpled, and his breathing was uneven. Harry smirked.
There was a tense silence as the four other men in the room shared wary yet excited looks. Were they about to find out what one of the Horcruxes was? Had Voldemort already sacrificed one and destroyed a piece of his own soul?
Draco pouted, but nodded, pulling Harry close for one more kiss before pushing him towards the exit. “Go on, go get pretty for the Weasleys.”
“You should know after six years of being in my House that talking back to your Head is
,” said Severus, though it ended up sounding like a question, even though he had not granted that question permission to leave his lips. Damn that old man and his meddling!
“Harry! Oh, goodness, I’ve been so worried about you! Why haven’t you written back? Have you been in terrible trouble? How is Malfoy, did Snape skin you alive?”
“Then I suppose a trip to Hogwarts is in order,” said Remus.
Harry laughed for the first time in a while, but only because Hermione’s statement was completely true. When would Fate decide that he’d been tortured enough and just let him live his life? He sighed as he realised that that would probably never happen.
Severus snorted mirthlessly as he glared at his godson. “Oh, how noble of you, Draco. You want to take responsibility for it? Fine; you’re both bloody imbeciles!”
Ron was still being as stubborn as ever, and even more so now that Hermione had broken up with him and started giving him the silent treatment. The glares he sent towards Harry and Hermione made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry’s neck, but it also made him extremely sad. Ron had been his very first friend, even apart from Hermione. It was like fourth year all over again, but this time, Harry didn’t have a dragon to battle to prove himself.
Harry chuckled and kissed his step-father gently on the cheek. “Rest well, Moony.” He would go find Draco and apologize for the way he had talked to him the day before. He had been so angry that he’d not been allowed to fight, but that didn’t give him an excuse to take out his ire on his boyfriend.
After lunch, during which Harry stared across the Hall at the Slytherin table, the Gryffindor Trio and Draco made their way to the Defence classroom for a double period. Again, there was taunting from the Slytherins, but Draco ignored it the best he could.
“Are we allowed to ask questions?” Draco asked, shocking both Severus and Remus, and earning a worried look from Harry.
“Well, let’s just say that those of the students who have never been camping before are about to receive a crash course in the activity,” the Headmaster said with a wan smile, his eyes twinkling as the Heads of House shared looks of concern.
Bellatrix’s leer began to turn into a sneer, and she tightened her grip on Harry’s wrist, surely leaving bruises. “Now, now, Harry; there’s no need to be so disrespectful. Your father would be so disappointed to hear how much of a brat you’re being to poor little Bella,” she pouted overdramatically.
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose as he leaned his elbows atop his knees. He had been expecting some sort of similar break down, but it made him weary all the same.
Harry, on the other hand, was having a hard time trying to get Draco to talk about anything, regarding his father or not. He stayed unnervingly quiet the whole time, driving Harry crazy when he just wanted to hear the Slytherin’s voice. “Draco,
Harry still had a skeptical expression on his face as he stopped to think about what Snape had said. He didn’t really think Draco would dig for his secrets and run to Voldemort with them, but the years of ill-will towards each other still made him wary of giving access to his mind. If he really thought hard about it, Harry knew that he could already block his mind enough to keep Draco from seeing anything Harry didn’t want him to. Draco would help him strengthen those shields; he really wouldn’t be entering Harry’s mind at all. That thought brought him little comfort, but comfort at least.
“I don’t even know who you are anymore, Harry,” Ron whispered, finally showing some emotion another than selfish anger. He seemed to deflate after accusing Harry of leading Ginny on, then having it shoved right back in his face.
Severus was sitting on his bed, completely lost in thought as he tried to push his thoughts away from what could have been done to Draco. It was warm in his small room, especially with his old classmate sitting beside him and looking worried.
Severus moved into the room, pulling Remus close to him even as the werewolf tried to insist that he had nothing to apologize for. He pressed his lips firmly to Remus’, loving how this simple act could turn his lover to butter in his arms. He pulled away and stared directly into the werewolf’s eyes.
“Potter isn’t here.”
“Well it’s a good thing you’ve been helping me understand complicated things for years, then,” Ron said with a gentle smile which grew wider as Hermione blushed. He leaned in and kissed her soft lips firmly but lovingly and knew from the look in her eyes as they pulled away that things would be ok.
“What in the hell? He’s gone!” Severus shouted, turning towards his husband, who was staring into the corner at the desk chair Severus used occasionally. Sitting in the chair was Harry, the black sheet draped around him, his skin still deathly pale and his hair caked with dried blood. His eyes, those emerald orbs that glowed like poison…his eyes were open.
“Get ready, Harry. When I spot the Dark Lord, I’m going to let my mask slip so he recognizes me. He’ll more than likely come after me, if he’s not too busy looking for you, and may even surmise you’re with me. You have the Stone ready?”
Harry smelt a familiar scent, something he recognized immediately, but it wasn’t Severus’ usual scent of potions ingredients and freshly laundered robes. A quick look at the bedside table showed that the side Severus was currently laying on was Remus’ side, and the pillow was most definitely the werewolf’s. Harry was smelling Remus’ scent, and it made his heart clench to know that Severus was much more unsettled by the situation than even Harry had thought he was.
Severus looked up at the Gryffindor, his face blank but his eyes full of pain. “There’s no need to call me sir when we’re down here, Harry. Please sit down.” He waited until Harry had retaken his seat on the sofa opposite his armchair before continuing.
“What? He had no reason to treat you the way he has, and I’m disinclined to feel any sympathy for him, aside from losing his father. I know how it feels to lose a parent, and it’s not pleasant, but he’d make things a lot easier on himself if he’d get over his misconceptions about Severus and I.”
! Do you realize that’s like the first time...
Ron turned towards Harry, who was sitting at the other end of the table, on the side across from Ron. “I’m sorry, Harry. I can’t promise I’ll never be an idiot again, but I can promise to try at least. You’re my best mate, and if these people are who you choose as your family, then I support you and your family.”
Harry pulled Draco even closer, so that there was no room between them at all. His hands were on Draco’s hips, underneath his robes, with only the Slytherin’s trousers between them. “Why don’t you surprise me,” Harry drawled, his good mood fuelling his courage.
Briggs curled up into a ball with an ear splitting shriek and fell to the floor, writhing as he screamed in agony. Harry let this go on for nearly ten minutes before lifting the spell with a flick of his wand. He gave the man a few seconds to gather himself so that he could kneel once more, taking pity on him so that he could at least die a dignified death on his knees before his Lord instead of a crumpled mess on the floor. “
“Oh that’s just not fair! None of the other students ever figure that one out! How did you know?”
Dumbledore took a sip of his tea and set his cup down before crossing his fingers in front of him, his gaze far off in thought. “I think, Severus, that that is a wonderful idea, as long as you are healthy enough to do it without causing further damage. It is pertinent that Harry does not continue these visions, or I fear that a repeat of last year’s Ministry fiasco will occur. I wonder, though – why are you suddenly so willing to help Mr. Potter out again? Last year you were hard pressed to teach him, and after only a little while, you refused to teach him all together. I know that you reached a truce with the boy over the summer, but after the Diagon Alley attack, I was sure you’d refuse to associate yourself with Harry again. Something has changed between you and the boy, Severus; or maybe it is just you who has changed.”
“Draco, can you hear me?” Severus asked as he leaned forward over his godson. He wasn’t aware of when he began to smooth Draco’s white-blonde hair down, but he was aware of the hand squeezing his shoulder from behind; Remus.
with his husband. That he would create such a horrible spell to begin with, but then somehow let it leak to the Death Eaters, whether intentional or on accident, made Remus’ blood boil. It was so ironic that the man lay dying because of his own damn spell! He was such a
“I heard this information from behind a closed door; the Dark Lord was alone and does not know I overheard him talking to himself that night. Nagini was the only living creature with him at the time; I know because I was called in soon after by way of menacing hissing from the blasted snake as it curled around my legs. I don’t really understand what the information means, but it sounded important.”
“You’d be surprised how many times that actually has come up in conversation with the Weasleys. It’s not that I’m worried about, though. I haven’t made up my mind still, and I’d hate to get them all worked up about it, then decide not to ask them. I’d feel like I was betraying them, or disappointing them,” Harry explained, running a hand through Draco’s hair slowly. He loved letting his fingers trail through the blonde tresses, especially when Draco leaned into the touch like a cat being pet.
Harry sat down beside his father, his anger over Dumbledore’s Will shrinking away at the possibility of finding another Horcrux. “When Dumbledore showed me the memory of him delivering Tom’s Hogwarts letter, Ms. Brooks practically begged Dumbledore to take him away, and was upset when Dumbledore told her he’d have to return for Summer holiday. She went over his disciplinary file, and he was a hell of a trouble maker even back then. I’m positive Tom hated that woman.”
?” Harry asked earnestly. He had thought the conflict between his parents had been over, but apparently he was mistaken. It seemed as though one wrong word set their fury at each other off again, and it was stressing Harry even further. What if this damn war tore his parents apart? They had a baby on the way, for Merlin’s sake!
Harry threw his covers off and hissed as his feet met the cold wooden floor. He carefully walked over to Draco’s bed and laid a hand on the Slytherin’s shoulder shaking him gently. “Draco, wake up. It’s just a dream...” Harry frowned even as he spoke those words. Snape had given the teen Dreamless Sleep, how on earth was he having a dream? Something boded ill, and it gave him the strong urge to get Snape or Remus, or both. Harry quickly made his way over to the bedroom door, giving it a sharp knock before opening it a crack.

He’s my son too, and I can’t allow you to use dark magic on him. It won’t bring him back, and he’d be so disappointed that you’d try something akin to Voldemort’s desperate measures. Please, Severus. I know this is hard, but think of what Harry would want.”
Remus and Severus were standing around the stone pensieve, watching the swirling silvery substance with looks of great distaste. Neither one of them were eager to view the memory, but neither were they willing to let the other go alone. It was too much for one person to bear, so they would go together and keep each other strong.

“Dumbledore left it to Professor Snape in his Will, Harry. He also left quite a lot of things for you, including the Sword of Gryffindor. The Ministry invoked its right to examine Dumbledore’s bequests, but they sent them about a week ago. Didn’t you know? He left a rather astonishing amount of memories along with it as well,” Hermione said, pointing to an ornate carved wooden box sitting on one of the chairs pulled away from the table.
