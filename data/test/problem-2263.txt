“Okay girls you are up the stairs on the right and boys you are up the stairs on the left. Lets start settling in for the night please!”
“Where you heading?” He said, an innocent look on his face, but Harry had a suspicion that he already knew where he was going.
Rosmerta cackled, startling Draco. “He finally did it did he?” Her eyes are full of delight and Draco can't help but be puzzled.
"Draco, I think it's been ten minutes." I took a deep breath and got up to get the test from the bathroom. I didn't look at it as I grabbed it, I wanted to save my reaction for Hermione, I reentered the living room and sat down on the couch beside her, I flipped the test over and two lines appeared before me. Hermione squealed and hugged me.
“Whats up? You need some help with something?” Draco asked, Mr Smith although a bright and welcoming student wasn't the most capable in potions.
“Argh okay I’m awake, ger’ off me.” Harry groaned, sitting up and finding his glasses on his bedside table.
Remus fell face first onto the bed and Sirius chuckled, shrugging off his clothes and popping on a pair of pyjama pants.
In a year Harry would be turning eleven and Sirius still was not prepared for the day when he would have to wave to Harry as the Hogwarts Express left the station. Sirius sighed and rolled over in the bed, Remus grumbled but did not move and Sirius waited for the mans breathe to become even again.
“Yeah I guess.” Ron sighed. Harry smiled, Ron really like to complain a lot, but Harry couldn’t have asked for a better best friend.
Harry watched as Hermione and Ron finished their game, with Hermione losing, but she didn’t get her arsed kicked as bad as Harry usually did.
"Draco, I think you really need to talk to Harry." Hermione leaned forward across the table and grabbed my hand, I ignored the glare from Ron and squeezed her hand tightly.
Harry sighed with relief and took the hat off his head; he gave it to McGonagall and rushed over to the Gryffindor table which was cheering aggressively. Ron moved over squishing a girl who did not mind and Harry plopped down beside him. There was many claps on his back and people congratulating him, Harry just kept on smiling with utter relief.
so sorry for the wait and how disappointing this wouldve been, it will be made up of with the next chapters i promise!
Soon enough everyone was lined up in a hallway to the side of what Hermione said was called the Great Hall. Quicky everyone shuffled into the Great Hall, there was a little stool with what looked like an ancient well worn pointed hat on it. Harry looked at it sceptically however since he had been separated from Ron and Hermione he couldn’t ask what the hat was for.
“Are you sure I wont get really hurt Ron, what if I accidentally shoot really high into the sky?” Hermione asked nervously, she had her hair in a braid which Harry had never seen it like that before, her face looked a bit different, not being constantly framed by her large bushy hair.
Harry took his hand off the door handle and positioned his body fully facing Draco, Harry being a about half a head taller than Draco had to look slightly down to get a full view of his face, and a view that he never wanted to stop seeing. He couldn't remember the last time he had been this close to Draco. Being this close to Draco who looked scared and timid, was not carrying his usual cold and empty look.
Ron snickered slightly and coughed to cover it up, Malfoy eyed Ron with a nasty look in his eye. His mouth opened and Harry was pretty shocked at what had come out it. “think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford.” Ron looked up at Malfoy, his face going red and his mouth open in shock.
“Draco it’s okay it was stupid of me to act that way just because you dont like me back, I’m perfectly fine with just staying as friends.”
Breakfast and lessons went by quicker than he thought and by the end of the day he was back outside Snapes office, feeling a lot better about it then the day before. He knocked on the door before entering, Snape was once again sitting at his desk scribbling away possibly marking essays.
Ron started a conversation about Quidditch and Harry quicky jumped into the conversation. The day went with it ending with Ron and Harry exhaustedly walking to their dorm room, ready for a good nights sleep. Harry faceplanted into his bed with a groan and shuffled under the covers, he quickly fell asleep. However, it soon turned restless.
“Hey.” Draco nodded back, not looking up at him but continue to eat his food in that graceful manner of his.
“Yes that is true i was in Professor Malfoys room last night, but we only had dinner…” He directed this towards Rebecca, “and after as old people tend to do we fell asleep by the fire.”
“Fine, but I’m telling you that I gave it back to her!” Ron grumbled, Hermione looked to Harry, but said nothing.
“Now remember, no one is to enter the forbidden forest…” He paused and gave a little look to the Weasley Twins, which Harry had heard much of their shenanigans at Hogwarts, “and avoid the third-floor corridor if you could.” He smiled lightly. “Now I think that’s enough from me, lets eat!”
"Doing it now." Harry opened the file and skimmed through. "Are you sure about this?" He looked up to Ron, the flaming red hair matching the flaming red beard that Ron thought made him more mature, which in reality made him look like a redheaded homeless man.
The lesson finally ended and Harry left the classroom as quickly as he could. Ron and Hermione quickly caught up with them and Ron once again bombarded him with questions.
Harry finished an hour before curfew feeling chuffed. Snape wondered over and examined the jars closer than the night before.
Since the war had ended, Draco had worked his arse off to gain the trust and forgiveness of Rosmerta and now he and Rosmerta were on friendly terms with all forgiven.
"We did it." I cried, letting the tears freely fall. Harry didn't say anything but grabbed the back of my neck and crash his lips against mine. The kiss tasted salty from my tears and soon from his.
“Don’t worry Harry, he’s just messing with you, only he was laughing at you.” Hermione reassured him, Harry glared at Ron and instantly got up.
“Run Ron!” Harry yelled and they bolted for the door, the door being old stuck for a horrifying moment but soon Ron managed to yank it open and Harry rushed in after him slamming the door shut just as the one of heads had snapped the air that Harry had occupied a second ago.
Harry and Ron did not say a thing when she left, when the door finally closed and her footsteps no longer could be heard, Ron groaned and slid down his seat.
"Ron!" Harry called. Ron turned to him and a sigh of relief left his lips. "Good your here, read the file yet?"
“He’s got brothers, he can sleep through mostly anything.” Harry chuckled, trying to lighten up the atmosphere in the room.
"What's this for?" Harry asked, actually what even was all this celebration for? Harry scanned the room, a lot of people from his school days had shown up; Neville, George, The Weasleys, Dean and Seamus and surprisingly Ginny.
"Yes surprise." He nodded and continued to search around the study, only making a mess of things. "Okay well can't this surprise wait till tomorrow because I'm tired." Draco yawned. All he wanted to do was to go to bed.
“Remus always told me to be kind to others, and I think he’s just trying to impress me that’s why he was so rude.”
They made it the greenhouses with fifteen minutes to spare, they weren’t the only students that had arrived early and the group mingled with others, introducing each other and just awkwardly holding small talk.
Harry sighed and placed the letter down. He had not expected a letter from Malfoy, and he had no idea how to reply back because quite frankly he did not know what he wanted with Malfoy. Eighth year was definitely a year of growing for both him and Malfoy, they both ended the seven yearlong feud between the two and even over the course of the year opened about things that neither had opened up about before. However, as the year came to an end so did their communication. Harry had no continued to talk to Malfoy after graduation, he saw him once or twice at the Ministry however only nods and a hello was shared. Harry thought and decided that he saw no harm in becoming friends with Malfoy, he no longer blamed Malfoy for the mistakes that he had made in the past, and he didn't resent him as he used too, he saw no point in not becoming friends with him.
Draco sat in the common room by the fire with Blaise and Pansy, Harry and Ron sat playing chess and Hermione had nestled herself in an arm chair, nose buried in a book.
Harry shook off the feeling which he wasn’t familiar with, he took his eyes off Draco and continued to pay attention to Hemione was who talking about curing werewolf bites with a mix of powdered silver and dittany. Harry had read about that this morning, but he nodded along as if he didn’t already know.
Draco chuckled to himself, Harry too absorbed in eating didn't notice. The feast came to an end and Harrys stomach never felt fuller, he even thought about pocketing some of the treacle tarts but thought better of it since now he would be a professor and not a student. Draco had finished his meal as well and a warm glow flushed his face, Harry taking it that Draco too felt contempt.
Feeling exhilarated Harry made way back to the field, his fellow Gryffindors cheering, the Slytherins just frowning, all except Draco who had a neutral expression on his face.
Draco doing this instictly whilst still talking to Professor Flitwick made Harry suddenly realise just how comfortable the two had become with each other and how they knew each other so well that it had become instinctual. Draco finally finishing his conversation between Flitch turned to Harry, a knowledgeable look in his eye. Harry’s mouth fell open.
The tap on his door echoed through Harry’s head, he rushed to the door and quickly unlocked it. Draco stood there dressed down into casual muggle clothes that fitted him all too perfectly. Harry wanted to possesively shove Draco into his room and never let him out, he didn’t want anyone else to look at Draco looking so fucking hot.
"Yeah I got drafted as one of their Chasers!" Her eyes lit up with the same spark that he remembered. The rest of the evening was spent with Harry and Ginny excitedly talking about Quidditch and Harry promising to be present for her first match. The night ended with Harry feeling lighter than he had in a while. His stomach full of sweets and alcohol and his cheeks aching for how long he kept smiling for. Soon everyone started going home with Ron and Hermione the last to remain.
“Poor Neville.” Hermione sighed. Neville was quickly taken to Madam Pomfrey, before she left, she quickly instructed everyone to land and wait on the ground then she hurried off with a whimpering Neville.
Harry sits next to Draco and realises that Draco had already served a plate of his usual breakfast for him, and of course some fruit on the side.
Ron and Harry both looked at Hermione with a slight shocked expression on their face, they both hadn’t quite heard someone speak so much in one go and they were still processing everything that the girl had said.
Draco shook his head, a small smile curling his lips as he walked off, Harry hadn't changed one bit.
“Harry…” A voice spoke to Harry, a voice that Harry didn't want to stop listening to. “Harry please you need to wake up.” The voice spoke again, Harry turned his body towards the voice, begging for it to continue to make him feel like air all over. Something shook Harry and this time it alerted the alarms inside Harry, Harry’s eyes flew open and he quickly sat up, wide awake and prepared for anything.
Draco's stomach convulsed and tightened. He couldn't contain the smile that lifted his lips, that made his usual empty eyes shine so bright. He unravelled his hands from Harrys and flung his arms around his shoulders, pulling him close and smashing a kiss against his lips.
Oh yes Harry had nearly forgotten that he was to meet Hagrid before breakfast began. "You should hurry if you don't want to be late." Minerva noted. Harry nodded his head. He placed the shrunken trunk onto the floor and returned it back to its normal size. Minerva watched and nodded her head before leaving the room to prepare for the upcoming sorting ceremony.
Harry shrugged and made for the exit, he wasn’t one to convince someone of something, if they didn’t like something, they just wouldn’t like it until they tried it.
Soon they had finally made it to the pitch and who Harry remembered to be the captain of the Quidditch team Oliver Wood stood waiting.
“Oh.” Hermione said, blushing lightly and slowing down. Harry not wanting anyone to fight turned to Ron.
Harry with his wand against his chest ready to fire the first spell that would come to his mind peaked around the corner, his breathe stopped, there stomping towards him was a great ugly Troll. The troll sniffed and picked it nose, its great large arms swung the club that dangled from his right hand and fell on its back, the troll was using it as a back scratcher.
I looked to the potion that I finally managed to obtain, this potion was vital to the process of the mating ceremony, the potion would temporarily make a womb inside me to allow the baby grow, and the blue moon provided the needed magic to activate the potion. The crackle from the fire place, and the familiar footsteps told me that Harry had arrived home, I looked to my watch and was surprised to find that he was home on time.
Ron didn’t seem convinced by this but he dropped it, he knew Harry didn’t like talking about his scar.
"We did it!" He cried back, he knelt down to my stomach and kissed it. "We did it." He whispered to it.
Harry took a big sigh, as if whatever he was going to say he would regret. "Draco I have something to admit to you." His green eyes looked to Draco's stormy grey ones, his eyes almost begging him to understand but understand what, Draco did not know.
The lesson ended quickly and then it was time for lunch. Harry was soon getting sore feet from all the walking that Hogwarts entailed. They all slowly made their way back to Gryffindor tower, Ron and Harry trudged up to their dorm and flopped exhaustedly onto their beds.
"Glad to know you still have attraction towards me." He chuckled, but the change in his tone changed my mood.
“Sorry I’m a bit late today class.” Harry huffed, he banged his bag on his deck and unpacked it. The hufflepuff girls in the front row giggled into the text books. Harry stopped and eyed the leader of the pack, Rebecca Lostring
“I hope its as cool on the inside as all the books say it is.” Hermione spoke, her excitement increasing at the talk of books.
Harry nodded and took the potion, he looked at it cautiously but with an encouraging nod from Pomfrey he downed the bottle in one swallow. Harry coughed, the potion was immensely bitter and very thick, he was glad that he had taken it quickly.
I pondered over this, I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world to take a week off, beside Draco and me really needed it, especially if we wanted to make this child thing work. Child. God just the thought of having a child scared the shit out of me. I didn't know how to raise a kid, I didn't know how to be a father! However, the words that Draco had told me the other night replayed in my head. But I know that I'm not my father and you are not your uncle" I smiled lightly, and my thudding heart slowed down to its usual beat. I picked up my quill and quickly began to finish the report after an two hours of non-stop writing, I placed the report by Ron's snoring face along with a thank you letter. I crept out of the office and made way to the fire places to head home.
Sirius walked in and opened the door and breathed a sigh of relief at seeing that Remus was still in bed and had not magically disappeared.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but Draco doesn’t allow him to say anything due to lips being crashed against his own. Their tongues touch fleetingly and their teeth crash against each other before Draco is pulling away, his eyes deepened with lust but also wide with surprise.
With Harrys instincts roaring, he kicked off the ground and shot high into the sky, his broom reacting as fast as it could to his commands. Harry knew that he shouldn’t try and chase after the snitch, that first he should go high and look around for it, so Harry rose high, higher than he typically would go for a game of quidditch.
One of his students was seriously struggling however Harry didn't know how to give him the extra help without looking like he was favouring him. Harry sighed. This is what he needs Draco for.
"I hope you had a good time Harry." Hermione gave him a tight tug, and Ron came up and clapped him on the back.
“It was okay, he just made me clean the jars in the supply cupboard, he said for the rest of the two weeks I’m to help him with cleaning it.”
“I went looking for the troll because I thought I could deal with it on my own – you know, because I’ve read all about them.”
Harrys breathe hitched and his heartbeat quickened. His instincts screamed that whatever was coming towards him was no friend of his. But being the curios and mischievous eleven-year-old he was Harry had to peak around the corner and see who exactly was causing such great trembles through the ground.
The bed newly made from Kreacher welcomed him. He crawled in, placed his wand and glasses on the bed side table and fell into a deep slumber. His dreams no longer haunted him as much as they had when he was a teenager, it seemed he had come to be so numb from emotions that even nightmares of loved one's past and hunting still on the run deatheaters no longer affected him.
“You know when I was little, some kids used to say to me how I could just get away with everything because I was Harry Potter, and I really hated that. I wanted to be like everyone else so badly, I started to really hate my name for a little while. But then my uncles told me its okay to be different as long as you remain as the person you want to be the most then that’s okay.” Harry smiled back at the memories of the constant reassurance that his uncles would give him when he was having a bad day, it suddenly made him miss his uncles all the more.
"How about a cup of tea?" I asked her, she nodded her head and patiently sat down on the couch, I made way to the kitchen and started the kettle, my hands shook as I took two mugs out of the cupboard. Thoughts continued to run through my mind. What if it didn't work? What if… What if… The kettle finished its boil, taking me out of my cage of thoughts. I poured the boiling water into the cups and dunked the tea bags in, plopping in a teaspoon of sugar into each cup. I made way to Hermione and placed a cup in front of her.
“Here we go.” Harry plopped the coffee cup with tea in front of Draco, a bit too roughly allowing for some tea to spill over. “Shit sorry.” Harry hissed and with a swish of his hand the mess was gone.
“Draco you know you can ask me anything, I’m an open book to you.” Harry gave him that adorable lob-sided smile of his and Draco calmed down a bit.
Lavender decided to walk with them, her and Hermione continued on with the subject that they were talking about before, which Harry came to learn was about Gilderoy Lockhart… whoever that was.
Sirius surrendering himself to a night of no sleep slowly slid out of the bed, maybe he would do some work to make the hours go by.
For some reason Harry preferred shopping in Muggle stores, probably due to the fact that he wouldn't be gawked at for buying a carton of eggs and a litre of milk. Harry quickly jot down some of the basic necessities he would be needing for the week into a shopping list and exited the house, making sure the wards were perfectly stable before leaving. He strolled down the streets of London, the streets filled with laughing teenagers eating melting ice-cream and mothers jogging with their baby's in a pram. The office workers ventured out of their small and cold offices to experience some of the nicest weather London would receive for the year. Harry breathed in the fresh breeze and sighed in relief. Today would be an okay day he thought.
“Well thanks for the nice chat Draco, see you in class.” He smiled and left, not letting Draco answer him. He went back to Ron and Hermione who had the most perplexed looks on their faces.
“Yeah but Remus has always been adamant on giving me the most normal life tha the can, and this is really classified as normal.” Harry said now feeling slightly deflated.
I sat down on the couch, a smile creeping onto my lips looking at the two adorable children eating the cookies my mother had sent by owl.
Harry soon looked up from the floor, his fingers slightly raw from how long he had been dragging them against the walls and faced the towering Severus Snape.
“Boys I said hover!” Hooch yelled at them, Harry gave her an apologetic look and lowered closer to the ground.
“Dragons don’t really terrorise people like that, they’re pretty quiet creatures and would prefer to tend to themselves, so I don’t think a dragon could ever do what Smaug did, unless it got really angry, I reckon.” Remus replied to Harrys question.
"Dumbledore?" I stammered. He nodded his head, his eyes even though the eyes of the undead held that same old twinkle.
Draco. Blond hair tickled past Harry’s nose. Those grey eyes looked at him with adoration, those hands that looked so soft and gentle ran down his bare chest, nails just scraping the skin causing goosebumps to follow in its trail.
“Sirius could you get me one of the muggle books please?” Harry spoke, standing patiently by the bookshelf.
“We came on the boat together; we’re friends now so be nice.” Harry said, giving Ron a small glare to make sure that he would be polite.
"Sounds good to me." I kissed his forehead and slowly moved my lips down his face to his neck, I rubbed my tongue around the soft spot on his neck, he moaned and moved his neck to the side to accommodate me. I continued to suck on his neck and biting softly until he was left with a nice red mark I smiled at my work and gave it one last kiss before moving further down his body, my hands ran up his thighs, teasing him slowly.
Harry bustled past students that gawked at him, he tried smiling and looking like he wasn’t about to be late for class, however he knew that he looked impeccably late. His whole class of first years were already lined outside his door, eager to begin their first lesson with The Harry Potter. Harry smiled at them, an eager blonde first girl, wearing Slytherin green blushed as he approached and smiled at her. Harry opened the door and let the students in first, making notes of their faces, knowing deep down inside that he would have a lot of trouble remembering all of their names. Harry made way to his front of the class, feeling all eyes on him. He spelled the chalk to right Professor Potter on the board, still not turning to face the class he placed his things down on the desk and tried to get them in organised order. He now faced the class and clapped his hands once to get their attention.
Then Pansy jumped in, she knew the tension in the air would not be broken if she didn't do so. "Well Draco this is the peeerrrrfect opportunity to get with you know who." She winked at him. He squealed and slapped her arm, the response immediate and the response that made Blaise chuckle. "Pansy shut your hole he is right there." He whispered angrily. The blush blanketing his cheeks, unfortunately Draco did not blush a shy blush, when he blushed his cheeks always turned a noticeable bright red.
“It’s just boring tiss all.” Draco waved his spoon around, and Harry shrugged, he didn’t find Dumbledore boring at all.
Harry thought, “that be nice but even if you don’t apologise to him can you not try to get a rise out of him again please.” Harry said, still with his serious face on.
"It's fine, see Harrys fine!" He moaned back, defending himself. Harry chuckled. "It's okay Hermione I'm fine."
“Wait is that what held you up this morning, you were joining the quidditch team?” Ron asked, finally sitting back down and composing himself.
Harry made his way home, the silver watch on his left wrist telling him it was three in the morning. Harry sighed and tried to rub the tiredness from his eyes. A letter lay on the table, Blue not in his cage presumably out hunting. Harry picked up the letter and this time recognised the hand writing as Malfoys. He opened the letter and skimmed through it however the shock of the contents made him read it more thoroughly a second time.
By the end of the lesson Harry felt that his head was going to explode from the amount of attention that he had to pay to Snape to make sure that he got all the information he needed, Snape apparently only liked to use the chalkboard to write students names on and the assigned homework.
"You never saw us here." I winked at her, using my charms that I only used in emergencies to keep her quiet. She only nodded her head as I handed her some galleons. We left with my hands full of shopping bags.
“Hey Harry made it alive I see!” He said excitedly, not having noticing Hermione yet who was standing awkwardly by Harry.
Harry then realised that after walking out of the castle, that they were heading towards the quidditch field.
Draco slept fitfully, constantly waking up in the middle of the night for reasons that he did not know. Draco woke again with the rising sun, deciding that he was sick of trying to get a rest and kicked off the blanket in a not so elegant way. Draco didn’t know how he was going to face Harry today, he still hadn’t properly figured out how he felt for him. “What am I  going to do?” He groans to himself.
“Is it true? They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So, it’s you, is it?” The boy spoke as if he had just had tea and biscuits with the queen. Ron sniggered at him, finding it amusing but Harry was taught better than to laugh at others.
"You know what I'm just gonna go, I'm sorry I had to tell you, but you know how us Griffindors can be." He smiled sheepishly and made for the door. Draco shot out his arm, stopping Harry. Harry looked to him shocked but wishful.
Harry looked at the silver watch on his wrist and quickly finished the last bites of his toast, if he didn't hurry he was going to be late. He swallowed the last bit of orange juice and hurriedly dressed in his best robes. He rushed to the fireplace and grabbed a handful of floo powder, no matter how many times he flooed he still dreaded it. "The Three Broomsticks!" He almost yelled and threw the floo powder into the fireplace. Harry stumbled out of the fire place into the Three Broomsticks, which was empty besides a few drunkards dreading the coming of day. Harry smiled and waved and quickly made his way out, he strolled up to the back entrance of the school, the wards letting him through. The halls of Hogwarts lay deserted as by this time first lessons of the day had begun.
Harry freezes and Draco’s face flushed red with frustration. “You know Harry I really forgot how much of an air head that you can be!” Draco huffed. Harry still doesn't know how to react. Throughout the year, Harry had not once seen Draco get angry and seeing Draco angry was refreshing.
Hermione just looked at him and made no further comment. The both sat in comfortable silence this time.
“Oh no you didn’t, just surprised me a little that’s all.” Remus chuckled, ruffing up Harrys hair to show him everything was okay. Harry looked up, knowing that it was all okay, his eyes instantly lit up with anticipation.
“Aight First Years, lets line up, Professor McGonagall will be ‘er in a moment to organise the lot of yer!”
Harry laughed and jumped the last two steps, but he stumbled and fell, smacking his face on the ground. Plain exploded from his nose and Harry rolled over hands over his face. His hands instantly became wet and Harry groaned, what a brilliant way to start his day.
Hermione finished her sentence and scanned her watch then looked up apologetically. "Sorry Draco we really need to go, we'll come see you when Harrys got his day off." I smiled gratefully at her as she stood up and scooped Hugo onto her hip, I gave Hugo a tickle goodbye and leant down to gracefully take Rose's hand and kiss the top of it. She giggled and flushed the same colour her father always did when he was embarrassed.
“Come on Professor you should know by now that the whole school is practically begging for you two to hook up already.” Rebecca answered, rolling her eyes as if bored, however they shone with bright excitement.
“Hmm can I get The Hobbit?” Harry asked, plopping himself down on his bean bag, something muggle that Arthur had gifted Harry for his tenth birthday.
Time passed, Harry excelling the best he could in his classes and getting closer to his peers. Then the day finally came when Ron and Harry could explore the third corridor without interruption from Hermione.
The afternoon continued with Hermione and me talking about work, whilst Ron played with Hugo and Rose to keep them entertained. It felt good to be able to talk to them, I decided to take the week off, but Harry hadn't, the days had quickly turned lonely.
Giving any sort of potions to Remus right before the moon was useless typically, his fever always ran too high and his body burnt off the potions almost immediately, meaning no affect could take place. Harry would have to go to the Weasleys tomorrow to stay for the night whilst he helped Remus through his transformation in a forest far enough away from human habitation.
“Did you two fight or something?” Harry asked, his head was feeling a lot clearer now that he had some food and juice in him.
The hat didn’t say anything more, and Harry just kept on murmuring not Slytherin, he wanted to make his uncles proud, his dad proud, he wanted to be with his friends. Eventually the hat called out.
They made their way to the back entrances, "Well here you are Harry, expect to see you back again." He winked and smiled before turning around and nearly tripping on his way back. Harry let out a small chuckle, his heart feeling somewhat lighter than it had at the beginning of the day. As he made it way out of the wards of the castle, Harry decided he didn't feel like flooing and disapparated back home. Harry took a deep breath as he landed back into the living room, Harry hated disapparating long distances, but not as much as flooing. Kreacher stumbled into the living room. "Letter for Master." He handed out the letter to him. "Thanks, Kreacher." Harry took the letters and Kreacher disappeared with a crack. Harry didn't recognise the handwriting that addressed his name nor did he know the symbol on the wax seal, he had no choice but to open it.
“Yeah McGonagall had to beg Dumbledore to let me join the team.” Harry nodded, Ron was still staring at him with his mouth agape.
Harry for a moment forgot that Draco did not grow up muggle. “Sorry muggle thing.” Harry chuckled. Draco shrugged his shoulders and made his way to the door, followed by Harry.
His brows knitted with puzzlement, Blaise being his roommate had no need to knock, maybe it was Pansy coming to say sorry. He shrugged his shoulders and jumped out of the warm covers to open the door. He had to quickly close his mouth to stop the gasp that would've escaped.
“No, I was just thinking back to it fondly.” Remus said, he wanted to move, but Sirius arms were wound so tightly around him that he was incapable of doing so.
Harry moaned deeply into Draco's mouth, he had not kissed someone like this before, not felt the euphoria of emotions in his stomach, the ache of wanting more. He grabbed the back of Draco's neck with one hand and the small of his back with the other and pulled him flush against his body, they pulled apart to breathe for air, Harry laid a kiss on Draco's forehead before laying his own on it.
Half an hour passed by and Draco soon found sleep weighing him down. Finally, he admitted defeat and placed the book he was reading into his draw. However, before he pulled the curtains close a soft knock came from his door.
Harry gasped awake, sweat drenched his shirt and pillow, his breathing sharp and fast. He couldn’t remember exactly what he had been dreaming about, but he knew that it was no good dream. Harrys head felt too clouded for him to think about anything clearly, he reached over popped on his glasses and got out of his bed as quietly as he could.
“A quill?” Hermione looked confused and not very convinced, “why didn’t you just borrow one off me?”
Harry wants to sigh but he holds it in. Looks like his confession did not go down well after all. Feeling down Harry takes a few more bites from his food and excuses himself early, he didn't know how to stop the ache that spread throughout his chest.
My heart pounding nervously against my chest. Tonight, we would talk, I will make sure of it I let the warm tea soothe the ache in my chest, tomorrow was the moon and I still hadn't talked to Harry. Tomorrow was the moon and I still didn't know how Harry felt. I ached to call for Hermione and talk to her, but she was too busy with her kids to visit, I took a deep breath to try and calm myself down more, it barely worked.
Sorry for the long wait to update I know my upload schedule is all over the place but I’m gonna try to fix it, but please be aware I’m going into year twelve end of January so my upload schedule will be slow :)
"Draco have you seen my tie?" Harry scrambled through the mess on the floor, he knew he would get yelled at by Draco later for such a mess, but he was too stressed looking for this stupid tie! Draco stomped into the room, he sighed and made his way for the closet, yanked it out of the rack that he so kindly placed it in and threw it at Harry.
Harry managed to make it to Hagrid's hut with half an hour before the feast would begin. Harry knocked on the door however there was no need to as Fang had already alerted Hagrid of his presence. Hagrid, his steps making the ground shake swung the door open and crushed Harry into a rib breaking hug. "I hav'nt seen ye in ages!" Hagrid sobbed, gigantic tears soaking Harrys robes.
The two sat for a moment longer sipping on their drinks and casually avoiding each other’s eyes. Dracos patience finally began to run thin. “It’s about time don’t you think?”
“Hello Professor Snape.” Harry said, turning around and attempting not to flinch at the sight of Snape.
The shop owner nodded his head. "Interesting name, however, it appears that Snow likes it." Snow hopped onto my shoulder and rubbed his feathers against my cheek affectionately, I chuckled and rubbed his feathers back.
"Ron, the blue moon is tomorrow night! Tomorrow night!" My heart thudded against my chest, Draco said we would speak, but it had been two nights since then and he hadn't mentioned a thing about the moon, every night when I would go to bed, I kept expecting him to say something, but he would simply kiss me on the cheek and turn away to sleep.
Draco stripped himself and put on his pyjamas which generally consisted of one of Harrys lazy shirts and a pair of boxers. Draco flopped onto the bed which caused Sirius to hiss and jump off the bed, Draco smirked, serves him right he thought. The buzz of the night finally began to wear off and the blanket of slumber soon began to weigh him down. But Harry had not yet come into the bedroom and he couldn't sleep without Harry.
“You’re such a child.” Harry huffed but he continued to eat, deliberately ignoring the vegetables in an act of defiance against Draco. Draco noticed this and glared at Harry, Harry glared back.
“Welcome to my class first years, now I know it’s going to be bit hard for you all to treat me like a normal Professor, but please do.” He dropped his smile slightly, his heart pounding against his chest, however Draco’s words quickly popped into his head,
Draco made it back just as breakfast began. His stomach grumbled and Draco made the slow descent throughout the castle to the great hall. His stomach churned as he thought about having to see Harry, maybe he wasn’t so hungry after all. But he was a Malfoy and Malfoys didn’t run away from their problems, they snuck away. Draco made his way through the main entrance, as it was so early, there were few students up at this time. Draco nodded at the students as he walked by the tables, but stopped when one of his students waved him over.
A whistle went off and Harry winced, there was a short yet fierce Professor standing with a broom in her hand and whistle in her mouth.
He sat up from his seat by the fire and knelt by Harry, whose mumbling started to make more sense. "No stop, no please…" Draco's heart squeezed.
“Mr Potter you finally decided to show up.” The Professor dark and as greasy as ever was sitting on his chair by his large dark oak chair like he was a prince.
Harry nodded his head at the second-year girl as she smiled at him and quickly rushed away. Harry started to leave, now his mind pondered about this girl. Why would a Slytherin girl be in the Gryffindor common rooms?
Harry pulled away, leaving a hot imprint of his lips against Dracos. Draco not knowing what came over him grabbed the front of Harry's shirt and pulled him forward to once again put their lips together. This time Draco less stunned began to move his lips against Harry, Harry did the same but to Dracos annoyance did not open them. He growled, which he didn't even know he could do and bit lightly on Harrys bottom lip, this caused the reaction he needed and plunged his tongue into Harrys mouth. Draco's tongue hungrily took in Harrys mouth and explored it with a determination to find every treasure there, Harrys tongue did the same.
They all laughed and Hermione let go of them, the chatter continued mostly talking about Potions, Seamus and Dean also joined in, overall, Harry was high on joy. The five of them laughed as they and chattered as they walked back to their dorms, they had a free afternoon and everyone was excited to laze around, but Harry sighed, he would have to use this time to catch up on homework he was behind in.
“Hey buddy, ready for some breakfast?” Sirius ruffled Harrys hair a habit that Harry was now beginning to get annoyed at. Harry like his father was quite slim and long for his age, Remus had initially been worried that Harry wasn’t gaining weight, but Sirius reassured him that it was just his Potter genes.
“Ye, I al’way want’d to be in Gryffin’or.” He said, spitting food. Hermione cringed a little bit but just shook her head with mild disgust.
Remus opened his eyes, and with a groan of effort sat up, Sirius handed him the cup and watched as he took painful little sips.
I smiled fondly. "Just someone." The rest of the day moved quite fast and soon Draco and I just wanted to go home. We made our way to the exit lugging our bought possessions behind us, Snow still sleeping soundly. I stumbled into the apartment and let the bags of clothes fall to the ground, but I placed Snow gently on the kitchen counter, I would have to buy him an owl post sometime this week.
“Yeah i guess you could say that.” He smiled, hoping that there was no blush colouring his cheeks. Harry smiled back and sat down in an armchair adjacent from Dracos. Draco picked up his legs and curled further into the armchair, somehow wishing that he was curling into something warmer. “Draco i really like it here.” Harry spoke, his voice soft and hesitant.
It did not take too long for Ron and Hermione to show up, Ron grumpily sat and shovelled food onto his plate, Hermione huffed and sat down beside Neville, avoiding looking at Ron.
"What one thing that my father did teach me was that you need to do whatever you can to protect your family, I will say he went about it quite wrong, but he loved us."
“Don’t you like that you can do wandless magic so easily?” Draco asked. If he was one who could do it with such little effort he would barely pick up his wand.
After waiting for what seemed like hours but was only a mere thirty seconds he flung himself off the bed and into the living room. Harry was no-where to be seen. "Harry?" Draco called, panic started to unfurl in his stomach. The ruffling of papers and the thumping of drawers opening and closing rose from the study. Draco now in full blown panic mode accioed his wand to him with wandless magic.
“Shit I’ve gotta run!” Harry turned to Draco in his rush and kissed him on the cheek before running out of the door, leaving it wide open.
Sirius had to return back to the wizarding world fully to ensure that his family would be supported, especially Harry. Returning as the head of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black had not been the easiest for Sirius, but over the years he had developed a simple enjoyment for his job. The work initially was languished and hard, but now his job was easier, and the machines of his ancient role were much more well oiled than before.
Draco took a step back from Harry to give him some space. “Sorry I should of probably woken you up more gently… but you just kept smiling and wouldn’t wake up.”
I turned away from the fire and went to clean the living room, the clanking of the dishes echoing through the empty apartment. I missed Harry, but work had suddenly become extremely busy, Harry had finally managed to catch some runaway death eaters, and quickly found out about their plans of regrouping once again. This news had kept him at work, constantly trying to find more of them, find out their plans, find out where they were hiding.
Draco quickly looked to Ron who was giving him a scowl and his smile dropped, instantly Harry could see that wall rise up and Harry wanted desperately to take it down.
“His name is Professor Flitwick Ron.” Hermione rolled her eyes and linked her arm with Harry. “Come Harry we’ve got to get out books for this morning lesson, and with that she started to drag Harry along, Ron quickly followed pursuit.
“Ron are you not sad about leaving your family?” Harry asked, he had known Ron since he could remember, and he wasn’t embarrassed to ask Ron questions like this.
“Look ill see you tonight and explain okay, just hold out for now okay.” Harry used his puppy eyes on Draco, knowing they were his only weakness. A moment passed and Draco sighed. “Okay but I better see you tonight!”
"I don't know, I'm feeling pretty good at the moment, but I think that's just the treacle tart talking." Harry chuckled and Draco smiled.
“Um I’m not sure, in his dorms maybe.” Hermione said, her tongue sticking out of the corner of her mouth in concentration.
Draco grabbed his knife and fork and quickly dug into his food. "I want to go shopping today then, I've been dying to stock up my potion ingredients." I popped in some more toast into the toaster and watched as Draco ungracefully shoved his face with food. I thought back to the first time that we officially started dating, even though we had established that we liked each other Draco was still very reserved. During classes we had together he would hold himself back, he would simply behave as an acquaintance, even when we would be by ourselves. I had to take baby steps for Draco to be more open, for Draco to trust me, for Draco to be himself around me.
Harry shrugged and started walking to his dorms, “wasn’t so bad, he just made me clean some of the jars from the supply closet.”
Harry gave himself one more look over and accepted that he looked good enough to show his face to Draco. He shoved his bag with some school work that he wanted to ask Draco for advice on after they had finished their meal. Harry made his way to Dracos room and let himself in. Draco was expecting him anyway. Harry poked his head around the door, “knock knock.” He spoke, Draco jumped and turned around. Harry laughed slightly and stepped into the room, the smell of a home-cooked meal evading his senses.
"Harry, I love you. I love you with everything I have. We grew up with horrible influences, we grew up with… questionable family members-" Harry snorted, I glared at him. "But I want to have a family with you, I want to have your children, shit I'm scared too you know!" I catched my breathe, breathing in deeply to try and stop the tears that threatened to fall. Harry leaned forward and took my hands. "But I know that I'm not my father and you are not your uncle."
"Master!" He called louder this time. Harry moaned and tried rolling over, Kreacher once again called. "MASTER!" Harry shot up, his wand instantly in his hand.
The child turns and faces me, his eyes open and I almost gasp, it's as if I'm looking in the eyes of my own. "Daddy!" He coos, his chubby little arms reaching out for me. Suddenly everything washes away and I awaken cuddled against Harrys chest, tears streaming down my eyes. Harry is wide awake and combing his fingers down my hair to calm me down.
Hermione was not the first to come down from the female dorms rather it was a seventh year who looked like she had no sleep at all. Harry gave her a polite smile and went back to his reading, the seventh year sat on a couch and stared at the fire in what seemed like a daze.
“It’s just because the full moon is near that’s all, could you get me some water.” He spoke with a small rasp and Sirius nodded, quickly rushing to the kitchen getting a glass of water, he had forgotten Harry was there and was startled slightly when he spoke.
Harry contemplated, but he would have to think longer to find a way to convince his uncle to let him join the team.
“Oh okay.” Draco stood too, his thoughts confuddling his mind that he didn’t even realise Harry had left until he heard the soft click of the door closing. Draco decided that he needed to somehow clear his mind, and the only way he knew how to do that was by making himself busy.
“Ron!” Hermione called after him, conflicted not knowing whether to stay with Harry or to go with Ron.
“Morning Malfoy.” Harry said, plopping his elbows on the table and leaning his chin on his palm, giving Malfoy an innocent look.
Harry and Hermione held a conversation about the class that they had whilst they made their way back to the tower to pick up their charms books, Harry suddenly realised why some already had their charms books with them at Herbology, it was going to take ages to get back to the Charms class.
“Hope its not too dangerous, you are gonna be much smaller than the other players.” Hermione said worriedly, her bushy eyebrows creasing together.
“Hey, I think I saw that it was on top of a door or something.” Harry said, trying to remember back to that short terrifying moment.
“Its not inedible.” Harry mumbled, he looked away and hid his smile, Sirius chuckled and walked into the kitchen. He could do a simple eggs and bacon easily enough. Sirius had actually expected Remus to awaken at the loud noises he was making in the kitchen, but Remus had not yet appeared from the bedroom.
“Sucks that you have to spend all that time with Professor Snape though.” Hermione clipped in, a deep frown of concentration on her face.
“Well Hermione I guess you’re stuck with weird.” Ron chuckled, getting up from the floor, reaching down and helping Harry up too.
“Harry do you really think my father would let me attend school without having a proper understanding of the most basic of charms?” Draco said looking at him with a are you stupid expression on his face.
“Yeah mate, snoring and everything, it was a right laugh.” Ron snickered, gathering his books and shoving them into his bag.
Harry breathed in a deep breathe to calm him his racing heart, already he feel the broom reacting to him and he desperately tried to focus on the excited feeling of being able to fly again.
"Please we work together now, call me Minerva." She huffed and waved her hand, she turned around and lead the way to where Harrys room would be. "Are you familiar with these walls Harry?" She asked, turning a sharp eye towards Harry. Harry tried to push down the blush rising up his neck. Students weren't really meant to go near the rooms of their teachers, however Harry had used this hallway as a shortcut on his way to many of his mischievous adventures.
The whole class was already there and Harry was surprised to see that they were sharing the lessons with Slytherin, Draco smiled at with a small smile which Harry returned.
Harry suddenly feeling the tiredness leave gathered the discarded paper quill and ink from the kitchen table and sat down to write a return letter to Malfoy.
"Oh, I don't know…" Harry voiced out, since the war ended six years he had done a very good job at avoiding the public eye, however if he were to succeed in getting a job here he would have to get used to it.
“May I ask why you are sneaking around the corridors during class time?” Snape said, one eyebrow lifted.
“Time for Defence.” Hermione sighed. They all sighed, Defence had easily become the most unenjoyable subject at Hogwarts, and that was saying something about History which was taught by a century old ghost. Harry liked reading the textbook it was interesting learning about all those dark creatures out there, but Quirrell had quickly proven himself to be an incapable teacher of Defence, Harry was really starting to question Dumbledores brilliancy as the headmaster of this school.
The way that Harry smiled, how the lines in his face etched by years of stress and anxiety made him look more mature and handsome. The way that Harry’s green eyes easily reflected the way that he was feeling, no matter how much he tried hiding it. How Harry used that stupid Gryfindor bravery to protect those around him.
Harry sighed and placed his drink down. He clasped his hands together and placed them onto his lap as not to fidget.
"Harry mate listen to me, I'm telling you to leave me! if it makes you feel any better, I'll owl you a report everyday so you can keep up to date."
Harry leaned forward, his lips connected to mine. Our lips moved together in a feverish fashion, the slight taste of salt on my lips electrified the kiss, his hands moved from mine to my cheeks, his thumbs rubbing circles sending light shivers down my spine.
I too stuck out my bottom lip, "I missed you too, but we can have fun when I finish the dishes." He pouted for a little while longer before relenting. "Fine I'll wait in the bedroom." He trudged into the bedroom, I chuckled and turned back to the sink, washing the dishes a lot quicker than I was before.
“How the bloody Merlin did he survive?” Moody had only a few times been seen with a shocked expression on his face, he wasn’t one that was to be shocked very easily.
"You don't need to lie to me you know." He softly says, he pressed his lips against the top of my head. I sit up out of his arms and face him.
“You’re not thinking of silly things, are you?” Sirius asked, wrapping his hands around Remus’s waist and kissing the back of his neck, the hair on the back of his neck raised and Remus shivered slightly.
Hermione was next to come down, and she conveniently came down at the same time as Ron. Harry jumped up from the windowsill, he was starting to get hungry now and he wanted to get to breakfast as he could. After quickly going to grab his bag, they all left for breakfast, talking about how excited they were for DADA.
Harry cleared his throat. "I'm okay, tired these days but other than that okay." He smiled back. McGonagall nodded her head then got down to business.
Ron watched the conversation closely, realising that it was coming to an end he took Harry’s attention.
The boys left the dorm and greeted Hermione who was sitting reading her History of Magic textbook by the fire.
“Oh, what do we have here? uh Mr Potter, come come let’s get that bleeding stopped.” Pomfrey ushered Harry to sit on a bed, once he was set, she quickly shooed Hermione off.
“Well I’ll let you get to it, good luck!” Draco teased and he walked back towards the Great Hall with that stiff yet graceful posture of his. Harry sighed and shook his head; he would need to hurry to Snapes before he caught an extra week of detention.
Harry paused to think. “I know the basics I suppose, my uncle took great pains to educate me, but I’ve never performed any before.”
“I already told him we haven’t seen one.” Ron said, not impressed by the interruption, Harry looked over to Ron who had his rat Scabbers out and he seemed he was about to do a spell on him.
“No, I don’t, but I have a lot of older cousins which is close enough.” She said, smiling wistfully.
“Next you are to tell your broom to rise up, you must be able to get the broom into your hand before you can even think about riding it.” Madam Hooch shouted her instruction and then blew her whistle.
He pulled me down and wrapped his arms around my stomach, his face cuddled into the back of my neck.
Harry’s hand slightly shook as he popped the buttons of his off white dress shirt into their designated holes, he tucked his shirt into his jeans, he had pondered for a while whether he should have chosen dress pants, but had decided jeans would be more comfortable and less awkward. Harry still didnt know why he was flustered around Draco when he had never been before when they were teens, but he had come to a conclusion that he had developed an attraction for Draco.
The bed once again calling him, Harry limped to his bed and fell down onto it face first, his glasses squashing against his nose, his wand poking into his stomach. Harry groaned and rolled over, taking off his glasses and placing them on the bedside table along with his wand. The strong wind outside created a symphony of creaking around the house, the echoes soon lulling Harry to sleep.
“Don’t worry Hermione, im only seeker and we don’t really get targeted all that much.” Harry tried to reassure, but he could tell that he hadn’t really helped.
“Yeah maybe a bit too much.” He grumbled. Sirius chuckled again and plopped next to Remus, rubbing his hand into the small of his back.
“Yes sir.” Harry said finally finding his voice. He went to the table and placed the black apron on, he struggled a little to tie it but once he had he went into the supply cupboard and began to take a few jars to take back his desk.
The hole was just big enough for one person to go through at a time. The wait was long but soon enough everyone was in what was called the Common Room.
“No, I’m just still tired I think.” Harry said, he smiled a tired smile to George and Fred and ate his food, they seemed to realise that he wanted some quiet so they left him alone to go annoy their friends.
“Yeah about this essay, im not really sure about this formula…” For the next ten minutes Draco sits next to Louise and helps him with the essay, even though he’s really not meant to, he can't help but help such a nice student. The great hall soon begins filling up and more food makes its way onto the tables. Draco says his goodbyes to Louise and heads to the teacher tables, somewhat relieved to see that Harry isn't there but at the same time confused at where he might be.
Harry didn't know how to reply. "Oh, um sure." He scratched the back of his head and took the number. She giggled and turned away rushing back to the safety of her co-worker. Harry looked down to the note and in a cute scribble she had written.
Draco dragged me through the aisles and seemed to forget who he was, he was completely drowned in the world of babies and shopping for babies. Soon I had a pile of clothes up to my eyes waiting to fall. Draco looked at me and the pile sheepishly.
“What!” Ron shouted out, standing up and disturbing the ink well that Hermione had precariously balanced on a pile of papers.
Harry exits his room and heads to the headmasters office. He knows what she’s going to ask him and he’s not sure how he is going to answer her.
The elf didn’t take long to pop back in front of them, and she had a basket full of what looked like food for a picnic. Harry looked at the food with his mouth wide open, he had expected maybe a few sandwiches, not a basket fit for a romantic picnic at the park.
Even though Snape was still being quite hostile to him, Harry noted that there seemed to be less hatred in his voice when he spoke to Harry. This made Harry feel a bit better and he hoped that just meant he and Snape had started off on the wrong foot. He gave a small timid smile to Snape before quickly shuffling out of the classroom.
"Harry didn't you know?" Hermione almost jumped up and down like she used to in class. "You got accepted for the job!" She burst out, a large smile surfacing onto her face. "Oh." Was all Harry could reply with.
Hermione waited outside the bathroom as I peed on the stick. One good thing about muggles was they had these stick things that told you if you were pregnant or not in like ten minutes. I finished peeing on the stick and lifted my pants back up, I washed my hands and exited the bathroom.
Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly and stood. ‘I think im going to go now, see you tomorrow Draco.”
Harry knew little bits about the war, Remus had allowed him to read small things about the war and once or twice Sirius would tell him a few stories about it. But mostly everyone liked to avoid the topic of the war, it wasn’t a time of great happiness and the war had ended at the sacrifice of his parents and many others.
Harry wandlessly and wordlessly accioed some paper ink and a quill to him and he got up to write his reply at the kitchen table.
“What would the masters be needing?” The elf asked, she seemed slightly annoyed that her work was being interrupted, but she was too polite due to her job to say anything about it.
"Well you never had the best father, he did horrible things to you, and think about Harry and his past. He never knew his father, maybe he's scared about raising a kid when he wasn't raised properly himself." Ron hands moved animatedly as he garbled on, his words however made complete sense and I couldn't help but feel ashamed at myself
“Argh better get started on my essay too.” Harry groaned, he swung his legs and swiftly got off the couch, Hermione didn’t look up once.
Harry may have ridden multiple times in his life and played many backyard games of quidditch, but he had never played with a snitch before, and he was suddenly afraid that he would never be able to catch the impossibly fast little ball.
Harry sighed and collapsed into the cleanest armchair of the living room in 12 Grimmauld place. Today was a day that once again left him feeling physically and mentally exhausted. He sighed and lifted himself with a groan from the chair and staggered to the bathroom to shower the dreads of the day off him. His muscles ached as he scrubbed himself clean, his skin almost gleaming from how raw he had scrubbed himself clean.
Harry half hoped that Draco would be waiting for him again like the night before, but he was not there so Harry walked back to his dorms by himself, occasionally smiling at those that he passed on the way.
I took hold of his hand in reassurance, "Your always safe with me." He took a deep breath and gave a small smile, that was all the encouragement I needed to throw the floo powder and yell Diagon Alley. Diagon Alley instantly smelt of its familiar candy and potion ingredients, children and their parents hurried around, getting to their desired store and waiting in the long lines to buy their products. We passed the good old broomstick store, I took a quick peep at the latest broom and instantly felt the desire to buy it.
“Yeah and so?” Zabini said smirking, Crabbe and Goyle quickly came to his side, Draco too stood closer, looking like he was ready to step in, but Harry could deal with this himself.
hey sorry for the constant changing of persons, im gonna try and fix it for my next chapter and choose which person I want to write in :)
Oliver leant down and clicked open the box, within the box contained two other larger balls, quaffles, but Oliver didn’t unhook these balls from their restraints. He carefully undid the strap that held down the golden snitch and picked it up gently, placing it onto the palm of his hand.
Draco seemed to be thinking about something too and Harry desperately wanted to know what Draco was thinking about, he suddenly wanted to know everything about Draco at that moment, but he knew that Draco would instantly close himself off. Harry had to go slowly.
“Forgot to tell us what?” Hermione asked, looking away from the notes she was scribbling even though it was now end of class time.
“Please sit.” She says as she sits behind her desk. Harry does as he is told, still trying to think of excuses for his behaviour today, because there is no way he can tell her the truth.
I gulped nervously and nodded my head in understanding. The man took a key off his belt and slowly unlocked the key to the cage, he grabbed the owl with his wings pressed against his body to stop him from flying away and gently placed him on my outstretched arm. The bird sat there and looked me directly in the eyes, his dark red eyes swimming in my green ones, for some reason I could not look away. No matter how intimidated I felt, I couldn't look away. I felt his claws slowly dig into my arm, but release. He did this a couple of times, my heart racing, my patience on the edge and my blood pounding to the tips of my fingertips. Then all of a sudden, he gave a soft hoot and rubbed his beak against the side of my cheek, I let out the breath that I was holding and rubbed my cheek against his beak.
Hermione rushed up the stairs and both boys decided to go to bed too, they snuck into their dorms as not to wake up their slumbering dormmates. Harry was pretty tired and it didn’t take him long to go to sleep.
Harry watched on like a puppy waiting for their owner to take them on a walk. Draco rose and so did Harry, his Gryffindor curiosity not allowing him one moment of patient. Harry looked back and waved goodbye to Neville, who returned the wave.
“Oh, well we’re here anyway.” Draco shrugged, he waved a casual goodbye and hurried to his table. Harry watched on, he felt bad but he was too occupied with other things to think too much about it.
Draco stood there in shock. Had Harry just kissed him on the cheek, had his lips touched his cheek? Draco touched the kissed spot with the tips of his fingertips softly and his heart palpated, his stomach clenched. Why was he feeling this way about a simple kiss on the cheek? Its a normal thing for couples to do when they leave the house, but Harry and him aren;t a couple, did Harry perhaps mistake him for Ginny, was his thoughts stuck on Ginny and that’s why he was so lost in his mind?
The silence continued, then Hermione asked the question I dreaded she would. "Draco when are you two going to have kids?" Hermione asked earnestly and innocently. The smile that was ghosting my lips instantly dropped.
“Remember to not get caught Harry, this school really loves to gossip.” Minerva pats him on the back and shows him the door, he steps out and the door slams shut behind him. Harry jumps and eyes the door with malice. She did that on purpose.
“Yep been on the team as the Beaters since second year, theyre really good at it.” Ron beamed proudly.
“Um Madam Pomfrey!” Hermione called out, Madam Pomfrey quickly shuffled out her office, her face set in a frown.
I stood straight and shook Ron's hand. "Goodluck mate." He shook my hand firm, I nodded my head, "thanks I'll need it." I smirked. He shook his head a small smile ghosting his lips. Hermione stepped into the fire with Hugo, and disappeared into flames, next was Ron and Rose, Rose waved goodbye before she too was swallowed in flames.
Harry pouted, this was so unfair, and Harry knew it was more than just lying, Draco tended to get a little bit of extra treatment, even from the Professors, who were wary of his father’s influence.
“You could have woken me up you know.” Harry grumbled; he didn’t like that others were laughing at him.
"To get the potion." I gulped and nodded my head. He left and came back moments later, a vial full of dark blue liquid in his hand.
The nice café worker came over with his coffee and gave him a shy smile. Harry smiled back with a thankyou her responding with a blush that quickly blotched her face. Harry watched her with the peripheral of his eye go and giggle with the other worker she was with. Harry took a sip of his coffee which never faulted to be good and dug himself into the newspaper. After another ten minutes the same lady returned with his ham and cheese toastie. Harry murmured a thank you and his stomach made a pull towards the smell of the toastie. He took one half and took a bite, the melted cheese oozing into his mouth, slightly burning his tongue but he didn't care, merlin it tasted so good.
Lunch ended with the bell and the food vanished from the tables. Harry went to McGonagall, "Well I really must be going now." He smiled.
“Harry?” Draco called out again, Harrys eyes unclouded and Harry faced him this time, soon realisation struck him. “Merline Draco im so sorry ive been horribly rude and ignored you this whole time!”
At first, I was confused, why would he be thinking I was going out today? Then I remembered I hadn't told him the good news. "Oh, Draco did I not tell you?" Draco fixed his eyes on me, he cocked his head to the side in curiosity.
“You would do quite well in Slytherin.” The hat spoke again. Harrys heart dropped. “Not Slytherin!” He whispered.
This was perfect, Harry sighed to himself inwardly, he just hoped that he wouldn’t have to miss the well enjoyed Halloween feast that everyone couldn’t stop talking about. Hermione helped rush Harry all the way to Madam Pomfreys ward.
The interview ended with Harrys throat feeling very dry, the bell rang for the beginning of lunch. Harry sighed, he'd now have to try and avoid the students to make his way out. "Would you like to join us for lunch Harry?" McGonagall asked.
Ginny was sitting in one of the armchairs, a glass of champagne cradled in her hand. He sat down in the chair next to hers. "Hey Ginny, how are you?" He asked, putting a soft smile on his face. "I'm pretty good, and congratulations." She smiled back.
Harry looked down the corridor and saw nothing of the sort that would make the corridor out of bounds, however at end of the corridor there lay another door, Harry hurried towards it. Ron looked around a little anxiously, Harry wasn’t really sure what he could be so afraid of, surely there wasn’t anything that dangerous, this was a school after all.
Herbology wasn’t too overwhelming for Harry, it mostly reminded him of his times helping Remus with the greenhouse that they had in the back garden. Remus used the greenhouse to grow many potion ingredients, most he said he gave to a friend who was an avid potions researcher.
The hallways were empty, emptier than usual he realised, he took a look out a window, from what he could guess it was probably around dinner time. Suddenly his hopes rose, perhaps he would make it in time for some food, suddenly he felt famished.
The rest of the walk was silent, and Draco smiled a goodbye to Harry as he went to go sit at his table, Harry sat next Hermione who was next to Ron, Ron was stuffing his face as usual which was a good sign.
(Sequel to Becoming New) Harry and Draco are now a married happy couple, but one question is left unanswered between the two. Will they have children? Can they put their past behind them and make their own family?
Sirius sighed and got up from the bed, Remus was breathing evenly now which was a good sign that he was sleeping well. The nightmares still plagued the both of them, however having each other made everything easier.
The days ends and Harry goes back to his rooms, he had somehow managed to avoid Draco at dinner by simply not showing up. A patronus made its way through his open window, its Minervas. Harry nods at the patronus with the message being crossed and it dissipates.
“Oh, this is far too much.” Harry laughed awkwardly, the elf frowned and Harry realised he had made a mistake.
"Yeah." He nodded. The phoenix owl hooted softly and rubbed its beak against my cheek to call for my attention.
Neville shuffled into the room and quickly talked to Draco about something that Harry had no interest in. Harry looked around the room, taking in the small parts of the room that made it so Draco like. The tidiness of the room however the slight chaotic order screamed Draco to Harry.
The weeks moved onward and Harry slowly fell back into routine. For some reason his nightmares didn’t attack him as much, each day he felt more rested than the last. His friendship with Draco continued to grow, but for some reason Harry felt as if something was missing with Draco and he wasn’t quite sure what it was. On Hogsmeade weekends if Harry wasn’t listed to monitor the kids, he would disapparate to Hermione and Rons place and share dinner with them.
Draco couldn’t believe it, Harry fancied him, but in what way and to what extent? Draco then thought back to how he felt for Harry and came to the stricken realisation that he perhaps liked Harry too.
“Well I guess we’re friends now anyways so it doesn’t really matter does it.” Harry said, bumping his shoulder against Draco’s in a friendly manner.
Finally, the last day of school arrived and mostly everyone had packed their belongings ready to board the train. Everyone in eighth year except for Draco and Harry.
"Thankyou." He looked away from her piercing chocolate brown eyes and into the champagne that he had barely touched.
Harry changed his direction and started towards the great hall, but when he was about to turn the corridor a great thud vibrated through the floor. Harry stopped. At first, he thought perhaps an earthquake had travelled through the castle, but then the thud happened again and again, this time a lot louder and closer to wear Harry was.
The rest of the night was spent making introductions to the other first years boys. Seamus Finnigan, Neville Longbottom, Dean Tomas. They were all nice and Harry laughed with Neville when he showed him his toad.
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” he waved his hand lazily. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Harry watched Malfoy, confident and arrogant, he hadn’t met anyone like Malfoy before, someone so confident of themselves and yet pretty rude.
“Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.” The girl said, plopping herself down next to Harry. Ron looked at her, slightly taken aback.
Harry makes his way back to his room, his mind running with thoughts about Draco. He really didn't know what he was going to do about the situation. He wasn't sure about Draco's feelings because he hadn’t told him anything. Harry reprimands himself, as it was also Harry’s fault that Draco hadn’t told him anything. Harry had been avoiding him all day.
"Draco what you said to me the other night, you're right." He shrugged and looked away sheepishly. "I'm not my uncle, even though he raised me, I am my father's son and what I know of Dad, he was the most loving person to mum and to me."
“No excuse aye? Just thought that simply being Harry Potter would let you get away with breaking the rules… well unfortunately for you Mr Potter I do not care who you or who your parents are, you are just a snotty little brat to me.” Snape sneered and Harry slightly recoiled. He had never heard anyone hold so much revulsion for him before, it was jarring.
As Draco looked around the room everything screamed Harry to him. To the way that Harry organised his papers, and to the way that his clothes lay about with not a care in the world.
"Just let her enjoy her cookie Hermione." I softly spoke as not to offend her, she sighed and leaned back into the couch. Ron took a cookie from the plate and snapped it in half, giving one half to Hugo and eating the other for himself.
Harry started along to Snapes office when someone pumped shoulders with him, he turned and saw that it was Draco.
I turned to face him, his green eyes deepened with lust, making my heart somehow beat faster. A smirk rose to my face and I flicked water from my hands onto his face. He jerked backwards and wiped his face. "Draco that's gross!" He whined, I giggled and placed my hands on my hips. "Well I told you that I was doing the dishes."
“Probably, and they’ll be even more upset when you make Gryffindor win the Quidditch cup.” Harry didn’t like the maddening glint in McGonagall’s eye, suddenly he knew that he would have no choice but to say yes, he wouldn’t like to be on the bad side of her.
“Hello Weasley.” Draco nodded politely, Harry noticed that there was a lack of hostility in his voice, Harry looked to Ron hoping that Ron would be polite back.
First up was Herbology with Hufflepuff then Charms with Ravenclaw, after lunch they had History of Magic once again with Ravenclaw. Overall Harry thought this was a pretty good schedule for the first day of lessons. Harry looked up to find Ron frowning.
“Of course, I do!” Draco defended, but when he looked to Harry and saw that he meant no harm, he relaxed a little. “Well of course I do… its just home is sometimes very suffocating, trying to be who my parents want me to be and here at Hogwarts I don’t have to try so hard, so it’s nice.”
Harry wandering blinked when he found himself outside a very familiar portrait. “Oh.” Harry spoke aloud. He had somehow numbly walked to the Gryffindor common rooms. The portrait lady slept so she did not notice him, Harry took a step back as the portrait swung open and a second-year girl stepped out. She looked up at Harry and her eyes lit up, “Professor Potter!” She exclaimed, quickly adjusting her robes, by doing this Harry took notice of her robes, and realised the colour of them, his eyebrows raised.
“Are you sure that's a real spell?” The girl said and continued, “well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”
Harry made his way through a back way to get to his seat, as he emerged around the corner he saw a vacant seat next to Draco. Harry sat down next to him, trying to supress the blush rising from his neck. Draco took notice of Harry as he sat down, gracefully eating his shepherds pie. Harry plated himself some food, ignoring the steamed vegetables, Draco noticing out of the corner of his eye casually plated a spoonful of vegetables onto Harrys plate. “Hey!” Harry started, however Draco gave him a slight glare and Harry stopped, feeling like a mother chastising her child. Harry ate his food in silence with Draco but Harry desperately itched to ask what the relationship between Slytherin and Gryffindor had become like. Lunch ended and Draco finished his meal by washing it down with a cup of water.
The boys quickened their paces and made way to the great hall, they still had ten minutes left of lunch, enough time to grab a quick bite and make excuses to Hermione for the absences. They finally made it to the great hall, Harry quickly composed himself and gave a quick nod to Ron to see if he was ready. Both boys made way for Hermione who was animatedly talking to Lavender Brown, her plate half empty.
Draco too scared to use his voice only nodded his head. Harry beamed and stood up, crashing his lips against Dracos. He pulled away and placed the ring on Dracos ring finger, then gently lifted it to his mouth to kiss it.
“Well Malfoy… or can I call you Draco?” Harry asked, a small smile curving his lips. He took Draco’s invitation and began to butter some toast which was somehow still warm.
“Um no.” Harry said, he vaguely remembered Ron speaking to a boy about a toad, but he was nearly asleep by then.
And soon the classroom became an obstacle course, with Harry laughing manically chasing after Ron and Ron laughing at Harry for not being able to catch him, soon Harry managed to catch the end of Ron’s robe and the two boys fell onto the floor in fits of laughter. Hermione came to survey the situation, seeing that no one was hurt she relaxed and a large smile grew on her face.
“About time we go I think.” He said, sending her an apologetic smile. Hermione finally looked relieved with this and she enthusiastically nodded her head.
They stepped outside into the fresh air, Harry breathed in and felt a bit calmer. Draco seemed more refreshed in the fresh air. They then began talking about little things, trying to get to know each other more. In turn doing this they came up with a game. If you avoided answering a question, then the next question asked had to be answered, if you refused to answer still then a serious punishment was administered, they hadn’t come up with the punishment yet though.
"Harry." Draco called, his tone this time awake and serious. "You need to be home by midnight tonight because that's when the moon is going to be in the most powerful position."
“Lost in thought there are we?” Harry chuckled. Draco liked the way Harry chuckled, the way that it made it way from his chest and not his throat made it deep and gruff, awakening every atom in his skin.
Harry had quickly found that he was also attracted to men after his break up with Ginny, yes girls he still found woman sexy and attractive, it’s just that attraction didn’t there. Harry had only been in a few casual relationships with men after his break up with Ginny, he had soon realised the war had almost turned him off emotionally when it came to people that he hadn’t grown up with and obviously this made relationships difficult and trying to find someone that wasn’t trying to date you just because you are famous is hard.
Draco's eyes widened. "You took the week off?" He repeated, his voice risen in shock. "But you're in the middle of a case and you took the week off?!"
The medical wings door was already open and Harry slowly stepped in, there was Neville with a frown on his face and a fixed arm, a petite woman turned around and smiled at Harry.
However, now there was no impending doom, or great expectations upon him, this was his moment to grab love by the balls and take it. Draco than thought that he really didn't mind the idea of a relationship with Harry. Yes their was the public eye that would disagree greatly, and the great clash of their personalities could become something that ruins the relationship.
"Don't be silly I'm sure they will, and Harry don't be afraid to be strict on them, you have to let them understand straightaway that you mean business or they never will." Draco spoke from experience and Harry noted the advice.
Harry thought for a moment and began to describe what he saw outside of the Gryffindor common room. Draco nodded his head as he listened. “Well after the war, Slytherins reputations went down the drain, mainly due to the reason that most Slytherins parents were death eaters and well…” Draco didn’t need to continue, Harry knew what it would have been like for the Slytherins. Draco smiled fondly however. “Minerva though worked really hard to create house unity, houses are still a little bit hostile towards Slytherin but for the most part it’s a lot better than it used to be when we were in school, and after the war.”
Ron called for Harry again, Harry quickly wiped his eyes clean and smiled at the two of them, “see you at Christmas!”
“There we go Mr Potter, now do tell me how you managed come upon a broken nose?” She said as she moved to a cabinet containing many bottles of potions.
"Oh." Was all that managed to leave my mouth. Draco ducked his head at passerby's and made way for the first store, a baby clothing store. "Draco you know we could have done this with muggle shops." I whispered, now suddenly self-consciousness myself. Draco had shopped here once, to get a gift for Hermione's first baby shower, someone from the Daily Prophet had unfortunately seen him and immediately assumed he was shopping for himself, goodness the papers had taken a field trip that day. I still held onto Dracos hand as we stepped into the store.
Harry sat down onto the cleanest armchair (the rest layered with dust as Kreacher didn't bother to clean them and neither did Harry) and opened the letter.
“They’re just teasing you Ron.” Harry said, smiling. He liked the Weasley twins, they were always a good laugh to be around.
"I can't tell you." He mumbled. Not turning around to look at Draco. Draco chuckled, he would still not get used to Drunk Harry. "Why can't you tell me? I can't help you if you don't." Harry now turned to him, his green eyes suddenly clear from the drunkenness.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco's and tangled their hands together, Draco never wanted to move from this position. His heart may have felt like it was going to jump right of his chest, but a smile, wide and painful soon formed on his face. They didn't speak for a long moment, just letting themselves rewind constantly the memory of their first kiss.
McGonagall nodded, seeming to know that he was already punished she let him go to his seat without another word. Ron instantly started to ask questions when Harry sat, but Harry just said he would tell him after class, his heart was still racing too fast after his first meeting with Snape.
"I'm sure you'll feel more comfortable soon enough." Draco voiced, his eyes suddenly seeming distant. "It took me a long time to go up to the astronomy tower." Draco quietly said. Harrys stomach gave a sudden lurch.
Of course it’s not what Harry wants and he hesitates with his answer. “It’s.. yeah it’s what I want.” Harry avoids eye contact with Draco.
“Harry, where were you? Were you with Malfoy the entire time? And what was that about Professor Snape did you get caught or something?”
“Come in.” Harry dramatically extended out his arm to allow Draco passage into his room, Draco gave him a ghost of a smile and stepped in. He seemed nervous.
“Yeah I don’t.” Draco nodded, a small smile ghosting his lips. Harry wanted to see that smile again.
“Hermione you’ll be fine, and anyways magic can fix a mended bone in a second.” Ron reassured, Harry shook his head, that really wasn’t the most reassuring. But Hermione seemed to take it and she looked less nervous once they had finally made it to the Quidditch pitch.
The chatter soon died down in the halls as students were lead off to their house dormitory's, Harry and Draco stayed behind to have a meeting with the other professors about and they too were soon dismissed. Harry and Draco walked next to each other, a comfortable distance between them. They didn't speak as they walked, however the air did not feel strained, the silence was not heavy but light. Draco and Harry both had small smiles ghosting their lips as they walked, a few students that had decided to leave their common rooms passed them and gave Harry (and to Harrys surprise) and Draco large smiles. "I see the students have taken a liking to you?" Harry asked, keeping the tone light.
“Oh well we…” Harry began scratching the back of neck, he had forgotten to think of an excuse to give Hermione.
“Hmmf yeah just… help me to the nurses wing.” Harry groaned, Hermione nodded and helped Harry get up, Harry was suddenly very thankful for magic or he would have no clue how to get the blood off his only pair of robes.
Neville nodded, he closed his eyes and took a deep breathe, he took a moment then when he seemed more relaxed, he extended his hand over the broom and said, “rise up!” The broom slowly yet surely rose and popped into Neville’s hand, Neville opened his eyes in surprise and looked to the broom in his hand. “Merlin, I did it Harry!”
Madam Hooch returned and instructed the class to pack up, so they did and Harry made way to the medical wing to return the ball to Neville. He climbed up the stairs alone feeling exhilarated still from the flying that he had done, he remembered back to the first time that he had flown and the broken arm that had occurred, thankfully by that time Rons mother Mrs Weasley was excellent at healing broken bones and mended his arm within the moment.
“Well if you ever need some Slytherin coldness than you know where to find me.” Draco laughed dryly.
“Oi Zabini that’s not yours!” Harry yelled crossing over to where Zabini was playing catch with the ball.
At that moment, Ron bounded down the stairs still trying to tie his necktie and his hair looking almost like a birds nest but on fire.
Draco drew in a breathe. His heart pounds against his chest, a shiver ran down his spine. “Come.” Is all he said to Harry as he goes back to his room, leaving the door open to allow Harry through. He slowly clicks the door shut, his hand shaking against the door knob in nervousness for what he is about to do.
Draco shuddered, becoming Harry’s boyfriend also meant to be true with Harry. Draco had changed greatly since the war, however, he still kept his old personality quite intact in fact he had been gifted with the generous gift of learning how to hide it nowadays. Draco with two hours to spare until breakfast took a seat at the bar. Madam Rosmerta greeted him with that classic toothy smile of hers.
Draco looked up and spotted Harry sitting down next to Ron, he smiled and got from his seat quickly rushing over to him before Snape noticed.
I sighed at Hermione, one thing I knew after these few years of friendship was that I couldn't hide anything from her. Hermione's eyebrows furrowed as she realised the quick change in atmosphere.
Draco continued in the absence of Harry’s reply. “You don’t give me time to reply you simply just ignore me all day, not coming to breakfast, lunch or dinner, and when i try to see you after you’re lesson you vanished?!” Draco frustratedly brushed his fingers through his white blond hair, making his fringe fall out of place and over his eyes. Draco seems to be finished and realises that he might of said too much.
“So, are you hoping for Gryffindor then?” She wasn’t looking at him now, totally entranced by the castle.
I smiled wide and leaned back in to peck him on the lips. I lingered there for a bit before separating our lips again. I yawned and stretched and reached for my watch on the bedside table. "Its five thirty."
“Oh Ron can you stop looking like a fish out of water, surely you are used to this sort of thing by now.” Hermione waved her hand dismissing Ron.
“Sir I’m all finished.” Harry said, stretching as he spoke. Snape looked up from whatever he was doing and gave Harry an appraising look.
His eyes watered, and his lips met mine, our lips moved with harmony and the passion that I would always feel for him, our tongues danced with a lust so powerful that it could no longer be contained with our mouths. Harrys hands soon roamed down my arm and onto my back, his thin yet calloused fingers slowly running down my spine, shivers running after them. I let the moans travel from the back of my throat into his mouth, soon my shirt was being flung off my back, and so was his. His took his lips off mine and rest his forehead against mine, our chest fell and rose in rapid concessions, "Draco I want to call him James."
“Oh hi.” Harry said, Hermione turned to face Harry, her face too showing a little shock at seeing Harry.
Hermione instantly took out her books and shut out the two boys, she was in what Harry and Ron had dubbed “learning mode” and no one could interrupt Hermione Granger when she turned that mode on. The Professor, who indeed was a ghost, floated around the front of the classroom and began droning on about things that Harry instantly found boring.
“Argh I’m suddenly realising how unfit I am.” Harry grumbled, he didn’t know if he could leave his bed.
Soon more and more people were finishing their food and the tables were becoming emptier. Two students wearing Head Boy and Head Girl badges stood up and got the first years attentions.
Harry was still scribbling away at his Transfiguration essay when Ron came bounding down the stairs in his riding gear.
“Wasn’t half bad actually, we didn’t say a single word to each other after he told me what to do, and before I was finished.”
Draco sighed into his potions homework, the dying fire cracking the only thing breaking the silence, Slughorn had given an essay to write about Veritaserum as they would be making it next class. A loud crash resounded through the common room, and a tall figure stumbled out of the shadows of the dormitory stairs. Draco tensed and flexed his fingers around his wand, however quickly relaxed when a familiar mop of black hair emerged.
"How are you Neville?" He laughed and he gave him a hug with a pat on the back. Neville laughed back.
"No, this one hasn't, he was bred in captivity, but he's a picky one and hasn't chosen an owner in his ten years of life, I recently took him off a friend of mine as they were on the point of giving up and putting him down, but I wouldn't let them do that to such a magnificent bird… so here he is."
Eventually it was just Hermione and Neville that were left with their brooms on the grounds. Hermione had managed to make her broom twitch, but Neville’s had not moved an inch.
Blaise asked the question that Draco anticipated for. "Draco how come you haven't packed any of your stuff?" He asked, almost innocently, but his tone told Draco that he knew the answer.
Yes i am well aware that this is just a shitty chapter about quidditch, but i just wanted to do this quick filler update to say that i havent forgotten about this fanfic and ill still be updating, although quite spontaneously...
How can Draco accept Harry? He’s never really been interested in men before, but then again he’s never really been interested in women either. He has either been far too busy studying to keep up with Hermione and his father’s expectations or in the later years of his teenage hood, trying to meet the expectations of Voldemort.
Dumbledore looked once over the dead body of Lily and his eyes darkened with sorrow, then he looked to Harry, many emotions passed through his eyes, none that Sirius or Remus could identify.
I sighed and gave in. "Thank you very much." I nodded my head in thanks and slowly placed Snow back into his cage. Snow hopped in obediently and soon fell asleep. I left the store with Draco, feeling lighter than I had in a long time.
“See you tomorrow Harry.” Draco smiled sheepishly. Harry taken slightly aback by Draco’s smile didn’t reply away, “Oh yeah okay.” He scratched the back of his neck suddenly feeling very exposed. He made his way to the door and smiled a goodbye to Draco. Draco in return smiled goodbye, but for some reason Harry thought it looked a little pained. He wanted to say something, however Draco had already closed the door.
“She accused me of losing her History of Magic textbook because I borrowed it last, but I swear that I gave it back to her!” Ron angrily spat.
“ARGH!” The troll yelled, it swung its mighty club and Harry narrowly dodged it by throwing himself to the side. The troll now even more angry stomped towards him, Harry somehow managed to roll away, missing his one chance to become Harry mush.
“Has anyone seen a toad? Nevilles lost one.” She said. The girl was slightly huffed with bushy out of place chestnut hair, her face was nice but her teeth seemed to be a bit bucked Harry noticed.
Harry nodded in agreement with McGonagall, he was already pulling so much attention just a few weeks in, he would like to keep extra attention away from his as long as possible.
Harry nodded and made way for the supply cupboard, he quickly got to work, determined this time to finish before curfew, he had a charms essay to start. Harry worked quickly and efficiently, once he nearly dropped a jar of gillyweed and Snape barked at him to be more careful, but other than that there was no communication between the two.
Harry doesn't know why but today is really not his day. He goes to clear his throat trying to bring some sensibility into this conversation. Minerva takes the hint and straightens her back, eyeing him once again with that twinkle in her eye.
“Merlin where should we go to eat, we’ve already wagged* half of third period might as well wag the rest.” Harry said dragging the picnic basket along.
“Still that’s pretty cool that you got to learn about magic whilst growing up.” Hermione said, her eyes alight with happiness. Harry noticed that she really didn’t speak to others, she seemed to really be having trouble making friends with the other first years.
Harry spent the next hour reading his textbook, he was completely absorbed by the new things he was learning, how to cure a werewolf bite, doing a knockback jinx and using them on imps. Harry was suddenly ecstatic to start learning all of these things during DADA.
“Mr Potter, I was sitting in my office two weeks ago, grading some papers, when you came flying towards my window at such a speed that I was sure you would crash straight through it. But before I could even utter a spell to stop you, you did a magnificent spin and caught Mr Longbottom’s Remember ball. Instantly I was reminded of your fathers skill and since our own Seeker has now graduated, I thought that you would be the perfect candidate.”
I nodded my head, Harry had been doing the same. The conversation died, and we continued to sip our teas. Hermione finally spoke.
"I think so, I don't feel anything yet though." Draco went to move but soon convulsed, he doubled over into a crouch position. I shot off the bed and kneeled down to his level.
“See ya Harry.” Draco nodded his goodbye and stepped out of the classroom, his robes flaying out behind him.
He yawned and got out of bed, stretching before he quickly rushed around getting dressed and brushing his teeth, Ron and Hermione were chatting in the common room waiting for him.
Harry thankfully was always good at sneaking around, for he and Sirius had to do lot of sneaking around to escape the constantly chastising Remus. Harry shrugged on his robes and went down to the common room. There was a dull ache beginning to grow behind his eyes, but he ignored it as best as he could as he ducked out.
“I think you should worry about yourself right about now, don’t you have a morning class in about ten minutes?”
“How about you?” Draco asked in return. Harry took a moment to think, and came to the conclusion that he had slept exceptionally as well. There was no nightmare and no horrible darkness that felt like it was swallowing him. He slept almost like he was floating in air.
"Yes love." He stopped sucking on my neck, the tender burning from the hickey he had left travelling down my arm.
“I have no idea.” Harry said, kneeling over hands on his knees. That was one of the most terrifying things he had ever experienced in his eleven years of life, however his curiosity was still greatly peaked.
As soon as Hagrid had said this a door opened and out came an older lady with a tightly pinched face and a bun that looked so tight almost like it was about to tear out her hairline out. Everyone began to stop talking as Professor McGonagall cleared her throat for their attention.
"How you been Hagrid?" Harry beamed, he hadn't realised how much he had missed the great big oaf. The two sat and caught up for the years that had been lost, Hagrid cried again thinking about how he had to carry what he thought was a dead Harry, Harry too let a few tears slip. The bell chimed for the commencement of the sorting ceremony.
The night wasted away with lips feverishly dancing together, and bodies not willing to let go of the warmth that they created. Draco had never remembered a night feeling so content and so happy in a long time.
“Charms is with that little teacher isn’t it?” Ron asked, following Hermione and getting up. Harry shoved the last of his toast in his mouth and got up too.
“Merlin Draco, you really like to appear out of nowhere sometimes don’t you?” Harry rushed, still trying to catch his breathe.
"Please!" She whispered, I let a small chuckle leave my lips and I picked up the plate to extend to her, she picked the biggest cookie and instantly took a bite out of it, crumbs sprinkling her white dress.
Harry tired out flopped onto the couch and picked up the book that Remus was reading, Remus opened his mouth to stop him but stopped himself. The book had nothing that he didn’t want Harry to be exposed to, it was after all just a simple potions book, so he continued on with his cooking.
The sorting ceremony ended, Harrys heart aching with nostalgia. "Gets me all the time." Draco whispered into Harrys ear. Harry nodded and kept smiling, trying to keep the sting of tears at the back of his throat. The feast started with a few words from McGonagall. Harry tucked in, he had forgotten to take breakfast this morning so this would be the first time he would've eaten all day. Draco watched Harry pile his plate with the nearest food he could reach and it suddenly reminded him of days when him and Weasley would pile their plates as high as they could go and Granger would look on with a sophisticated look of disgust on her face.
“Oh shit.” Draco mumbled, Harry wanted to laugh at his use of swearing, but he was too nervous to even make a sound.
“And you two, five points each for even though you were very lucky to have taken down a mountain troll, not many first years could have done so, now off you two go as well.”
“Nah he isn’t, but he used to tutor a lot of kids whilst at Hogwarts, my uncle Sirius reckons he should become a professor here.” Harry laughed lightly, remembering all the teasing Sirius would give Remus about his strong ability to teach.
“What really? I thought you were proud to be in Slytherin.” Harry said, very surprised that Draco was feeling that way.
Harry desperately thought of a way that would help him out of this very tight situation, his only hope now would be to attempt to hold his own against the troll before the professors could find him. He could fell the troll thundering towards him, he could only hope that the troll would be stupid enough to run past him.
Harry and Ron both nodded and hurried after Hermione who was waiting for them at the end of the hall.
Harry sat on the grass picking at grass feeling bored when some giggling caught his attention. Harry looked up and found that Blaise was throwing around a glass ball with Crabbe and Goyle. Harry squinted at the ball, trying to figure out what looked so familiar about the ball, when it clicked, that was Neville’s Remember ball.
“Come Hermione’s probably waiting for us in the common room.” Harry got up and packed his books for their last lesson of the day, which was History of Magic, he didn’t want to have to come back up here after lunch.
Remus rolled his eyes and quickly finished dinner. He didn’t know how he would manage to survive to old age with these two keeping him on his toes.
“Ron!” Hermione squeaked, afraid that the kick might have woken up the troll, but it continued to snore.
“Ron you know you’ll always be my best friend.” Harry said, putting some shepherd’s pie onto his plate.
Harry could feel the drool evade his mouth, “argh I love chicken pot pie, Ginny used to make the meanest pie.” Harry quickly shut his mouth.
He liked the common room he decided. The chairs by the fire were very inviting and the tall large windows had enough room to sit on the ledges which seemed like a perfect spot to curl up with a book. Harry sat down on one of the couches, watching the fire and began thinking of Sirius and Remus, an ache spread through his chest again. He really missed his uncles.
“Is your uncle a teacher?” Hermione asked, now more excited to be on the topic of learning and education.
“Mate if you don’t wake up you’re gonna miss breakfast!” Ron had his toothbrush half hanging out of mouth and he spat a little on Harrys face.
“I’d never say no that.” Harry smiled, Draco then started hurrying towards the stairs, they both scurried downstairs, narrowly missing a Hufflepuff prefect going to class. They both giggled as the prefect walked into her classroom, Harry felt like he was high on sugar.
"Thank you love." He smiled. I popped some toast into the toaster and set my elbows on the kitchen bench, resting my chin in the palms of my hands. I let my eyes rest on Draco's face. Soon a soft blush splotched his cheeks.
“Argh that was horrible.” Ron whined as they walked out of the classroom, Harry just smiled at him but he didn’t agree with him, although the lesson was by far the hardest lesson they had had so far, it wasn’t horrible.
“Hmm hopefully.” She nodded her head. She plopped the books down on a table and sat down next to Harry.
Harry stumbled into his room and fell face forward onto his bed, groaning as his glasses dug into the bridge of his nose. He turned his head to give him relief and with great effort pulled his arm from beneath him to take off his glasses. He placed his glasses onto the bedside table beside the lamp and took the last effort he had to find his wand and place it beside his glasses. Throughout is time looking for the Horcruxes he had developed the habit of placing his wand underneath his pillow, however throughout his Auror training he had that habit quickly trained out of him. Harry sighed and let his eyes close, not bothering with placing the duvet on top of him. Sleep soon found him, sleep that for once did not feel heavy.
“Blimey Harry, you really are something aren’t you?” Ron chuckled, Harry tried to keep the blush at bay.
Harrys ears perked up when he could hear steps thundering towards the carriage, at once the door was thrown open and a sharp blonde boy greeted them with a smirk on his face. The boy who Harry had never seen before surveyed the carriage with his fiery grey eyes, the eyes after evaluating Ron fell on him and Harry watched with a mild perplexed look, as this boys face lit up with realisation.
Soon they came to some steps and climbed up, “This is Gryffindor Tower where you all will be for the next seven years of school.” The Headgirl spoke. They climbed up slowly, there was a lot of people going up the stairs and Harry was instantly afraid of tripping.
Eventually the Great Hall hushed and Harry took that moment to look around it. The hall was large with an immensely high ceiling, the ceiling currently looked like it didn’t exist like he was just looking at the night sky scattered with shimmering stars, but something told Harry that there was a ceiling and he was just looking at an enchantment.
Sirius took this as his time to finally give Remus his water. He walked as fast as he could to the bedroom and softly sat down next to Remus.
“You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” Malfoy said, a magnificent glint in his eyes and his hand extended out. Harry stood up and looked at the hand, he did not shake it yet.
"Just a little bit." He murmured and scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. Minerva didn't reply.
“Hey, don’t look at me like that, that redhead is asking for it half the time!” Blaise put both his hands in the air, feigning innocence.
Draco sighed and stopped rubbing his abdomen. "Yes, I think it's over now." I let out a breath of relief and sat down next to him. I touched Dracos hand and was shocked to find that as soon as I touched him he moaned.
Draco and Harry both chuckled lightly, before they too started walking to the Great Hall in amicable silence.
Harry rolled his eyes, really doubting that this was the real reason for his excitement, but he didn’t push Ron further and just let it go.
Harry sighed in relief to be out of that some what suffocating classroom, he was so relieved by this fact that he hadn’t noticed the smirking blonde boy waiting outside of the classroom.
“Sirius Black!” Remus huffed and he quickly turned around, Sirius lopsided smile broke through his face.
“Harry, we made it!” Hermione said, politely moving someone over so she could sit in front of him. Harry with his mouth full only nodded, he quickly swallowed and smiled at Hermione.
“I…” Draco tried to ask, but he really didn’t know how he could ask Harry without feeling like he was being evasive.
They sighed with relief as they passed untouched by Snape and giggled with each other, high on adrenalin. They continued up the staircase and finally made it to the door, Harry took a big deep breathe in before he turned the handle, slowly and carefully.
Hermione seeming to notice Harrys uncomfortableness and she changed the topic, to Harrys utter gratefulness.
The door clicked open and Harry looked at Ron with a face of astonishment, Harry opened the door further and slipped in, Ron quickly following.
“All ready to go Hermione?” Harry said, crossing the satchel strap across his chest. Hermione looked up and slammed the book shut and quickly shoving it into her satchel.
“Both Gryffindor.” Harry replied, he jostled a bit, the boats had now begun moving towards the castle.
“Harry?” Draco called. Harry shook his head and looked up at Draco, who stood there holding a platter with sandwiches, his eyes swimming with worry and curiosity.
and here is the next chapter, sorry for the long wait as I said before I just started uni and didn't really have the time to write. I think I'm going to only update once a week now. This allows me a longer time to write which means better quality writing and hopefully longer chapters!
“I’ll be right back, just going to go check on Moony.” Sirius spoke lightly, ruffling Harrys hair as he walked past towards the bedroom.
However, Harrys anger flared, how dare someone speak to him in such a way! “I’m sorry sir but I have no respect for an adult who can’t let go of stupid childish feud of the past.” Harry defiantly said keeping eye contact with Snape. Harry knew he was pressing on a sore spot of Snapes and as he said it Snapes nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with anger.
“That’s a good boy, you’ll probably feel a bit sleepy, that potion has a drowsy side effect, I’ll wake up at lunchtime.”
“I wish he was more exciting; I was so excited to learn about DADA.” Hermione sighed, then they all sighed in unison. With the mood so low they kept walking to the Gryffindor tower in a sombre silence. Harry was about to say something when Draco unexpectantly stood in front of him.
“Yeah me too.” Draco sighed softly, he could feel the weight of sleep falling upon him, he was so comfortable that he let all his defenses fall away. Harry felt a change in the magic surrounding him and realised that Draco had released the protecting spells that constantly surrounded him. Harry’s heart pounded rapidly against his chest. He knew Draco constantly kept protective spells around him, even in his sleep they surrounded him. He had once asked Draco why he did this, Hogwarts was after all one of the safest places for witches and wizards. Draco simply said that he was taught never to let his defenses down so that’s what he did. Harry didn’t push the subject any further.
By the end of the day he had all his students papers graded and his room looking cleaner than the day that he arrived. Draco prepared himself for bed, thinking perhaps a shower would help soothe his mind, oh how wrong he was.
I crossed my arms around my chest and huffed. "I'm getting slightly offended now you know, and I take Christmas's off!"
“Good so now time for the details of your punishment, for the next two weeks you’ll be assisting me with the reorganisation of my supply cupboard, I hope you’re not too clumsy with those hands of yours.”
Hermione looked at Harry thankfully and the three made their way back to Gryffindor tower. After sorting out their books, Harry took out the map they were given along with their timetables and tracked the way that they would need to take to get to the greenhouses. Hermione however ended up leading most of the way, she had an excellent memory that applied to much more than reading.
“I had a good childhood I’ll have you know.” Harry said, feeling offended. He had an excellent childhood actually.
Harry took another deep breath and opened the door a little faster this time, this was perhaps the wrong decision to make for the noise of the door squeaking loudly open woke up the frighteningly large three headed dog that Harry and Ron were now frozen in front of.
Harry goes to reply but she stops him. “I know that you are romantically interested in Draco Malfoy.” She says, her eyes twinkling in amusement.
He began to get up, but Malfoys hand shot up and grabbed his sleeve. Harry looked down to the pale hand with surprise, Malfoy quickly retreated it.
All that hard effort finally lead to this life, husband and husband, showing their bad sides to each other. Showing their gross sides with each other, their vulnerable sides, the sides we only had for each other. I smiled fondly and was once again caught by the toaster going off, I took a deep breath to calm my racing heart and I yoinked the toast out of the toaster and threw them ungracefully onto my plate.
This instantly caught Harrys attention, one thing Ron and he definitely had in common was Quidditch. Hermione just listened with mild interest, being a muggle, she knew nothing about Quidditch, but Harry had a suspicion she would go find a book about it as soon as she had a moment too.
He smiled at both the boys and went back down to the common room. Hermione and Harry both worked together quietly, every now and then asking each other questions or reading what they had wrote to each other to fact check. Hermione retired first having finished her easy, Harry said goodnight and continued working on his essay with the warm glow of the fireplace the only thing lighting his paper.
“Well I don’t know; I feel pretty calm.” Harry said, he didn’t realise that’s what he looked to others.
Harry soon found his bed with his trunk at the end of it. With a groan he flopped onto his bed, he had spent too much of the day sitting around.
“Malfoy.” Ron nodded. This was much better than their first meeting Harry decided, the tension was rising however and Snape broke it just at the right time. He cleared his throat gaining the attention of the classroom.
“Alright everyone in the boats!” Hagrid bellowed, soon everyone was clambering into the boats, girls trying their best to stay with their friends and boys just wanting to get into the castle as quick as possible. Ron and Harry somehow got separated and when Harry finally sat down into a boat, he was a bit shocked to find he was sitting next to Hermione.
"Harry." Draco sighed. This year not a lot had returned to Hogwarts, meaning the eight years received their own common rooms and dormitory's instead of their traditional house ones.
"Will you marry me?" Harry opened the box that he was holding and Dracos eyes was met with the most beautiful ring he had ever seen. The band was a simple rose gold band, carved in the band was his birth stone Alexandrite, the smalls gems that was scattered across the band shown light pink. A few of the gems glittered a deep pink almost red. Draco instantly knew what the gems were, and his heart warmed even more.
"Draco." I looked deep into stormy gray eyes, "I will always have an attraction towards you, no one else can compare to you."
I smiled at them with a bright smile and placed the tray onto the foot table, I almost chuckled as I caught Rose looking hungrily at the plate of cookies.
"Because I started to think what my life would be like without you and it made me cry." He shrugged. Draco breathed out a sigh of relief. "Oh, Harry I'm right here you don't have to worry about those things." He brushed the tears away from Harrys cheek with the pad of his thumb. He kissed Harrys salty lips and smiled softly at him.
