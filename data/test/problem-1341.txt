“I don’t know Malfoy!” Harry screams, throwing his hands up. The edges of the silencing charm shake, Draco feels the tremors course through his body. “I don’t bloody know how I could look at someone like you and think–“
Outside, the clouds have parted and the stars have risen– bright, shining points of light. In the haze of agony and despair, the stars and the lights of Camden nightlife blend together into one pulsing, writhing mass of flashing colours, and when Draco buries his face in the pillow and screams, the explosion behind his eyes is riotous.
He tips a blue capped potion into his mouth and presses a hand to his chest. He feels his heart calm under the touch, the erratic beating steadying. He stays that way for a few moments, memorising the beat, the rhythm. It calms his mind, erases Potter’s words for a few moments, making him a blank canvas.
He gestures to them with his hands and grits his teeth, trying to find words for why they’re making him uncomfortable. “I’m not, I’m not some prize Abraxan horse ready to be cut into meat for a Viking feast so what’s with the creepy staring?”
Together is big enough. Together is limitless. Together could mean anything and could mean nothing, could mean the moans that mingle against the bedsheets at night or the innocent handholding in the streets of Florence, or the causal banter they exchange over morning coffee. Together is perfect, twining them both into an embrace and letting them stay there.
It is obvious in the slump of her shoulders and the way she sometimes turns to her side with an excited expression only to find no one there. Weasley has gone directly into Auror training and Potter is… here but not quite.
When he approaches the door and knocks on it, he doesn’t quite know what to expect. He knows Malfoy is going to open it but the thought of snobbish Malfoy doing quotidian things like opening doors makes Harry first pause and then feel uncomfortable. He knows that the world has changed, turned upside down on its head around him but Malfoy doing what a butler should or a house elf probably would in any other situation will make him face truths he wants to hide from. But when the door creaks open finally, jarring him out of his thoughts, Harry’s jaw hangs open in shock.
“Not long enough,” he says with a rueful smile. “Didn’t quite manage to hold back enough to hear anything of worth.”
Closing his eyes and concentrating, he follows the directions from his brain which seems to be running on muscle memory of another body. When he opens his eyes, he is standing in front of an unfamiliar door at the far end of the house.
“Where are the Aurors?” Malfoy asks, focusing somewhere over Harry’s left shoulder, his gaze searching.
And wasn’t that ironic, him hitting the nail on the head with the accuracy of a Ravenclaw prodigy without even knowing.
“Not since before we left during the War. They tried for about a week after coming back but well…” she trails off.
The place, he realises, surveying what appeared to be the drawing room, seems to be a dilapidated dump of ornate furniture, peeling wallpaper and a layer of dust and grime which appears to be permanently attached to the walls and ceiling. Draco wrinkles his nose slightly. His fortunes aren’t quite as extensive as they were prior to the war reparations the Malfoys were made to pay but he has grown up in lavish style and immaculate surroundings. Even now, when by all rights nothing should faze him with regards to poor upkeep, he can’t help but let his Pureblood upbringing come to the fore from where it lies, simmering underneath the surface of his calm acceptance of the less pleasing aspects of Wizarding society.
Contrary to what Draco had feared would happen, they don’t immediately strip each other and proceed to bang it out. He knows he wants to go further, but he isn’t sure he’s quite
Draco winces when he eventually pulls out of him, the sick squelch of lube and come sounding unwelcome to Draco’s straining ears. Harry murmurs a cleaning charm, and the wet feeling is replaced by a tightness that has Draco gritting his teeth.
Of course he knew magic had a smell. How could one not when they spent three nights a week with Harry Potter and his casual displays of wandless, wordless magic that thickened the scent of a crackling fire on a winter evening in the air? The blanket of that magic kept Draco warm when Harry would get up, pull on his robes, spell his messy hair clean and dry after an orgasm and say, “Later, Malfoy,” and leave without looking back.
“Harry, it isn’t Hermione, it’s actually me. Would you please open the door? I don’t want to use magic.”
Ginevra brightens. “Great, now that Ron’s left the Aurors to work with George. He was always so good with strategy– he’s helping out with advertisement and accounting, and George feels steadier, working with a brother again.” She doesn’t mention that last bit with any hint of resentment or bitterness, just a flash of melancholy in her wide brown eyes. “It’s been fun, working with them on the stuff– George’s always been a fucking genius, everyone thought Fred was the crazy one, he was just louder. George was the one who thought up all the stupid pranks which
“What are you– are you a ghost?” Harry asks, shocked. He wouldn’t wish such a fate on anyone. Least of all his vivid, vibrant, beautiful son.
“Is something wrong?” Harry asks, frustrated by the fifth time Malfoy opens his mouth and shuts it again before saying anything. He looks tense, on constant edge and it’s grating on Harry’s nerves.
Harry lifts his hips in response to those words and Draco’s ensuing thrust. Draco screams and Harry pulls him down frantically by the shoulders to kiss him stupid.
“I—” he begins before realising he has nothing to say to her. Her brother is dead, her friends are dead and her boyfriend just killed the man whose Mark Draco bears rather prominently on his arm.
Harry opens his eyes to look a Draco and the confusion he sees in those pools of green light makes Draco break out in a fond smile.
The shame of it! The horror of it, a Malfoy in exile, a Malfoy thinking about work, a Malfoy willingly handing over the contents of half the vaults without a fight. The pressure of generations of Malfoys disapproving of this heir chokes him until he’s gasping, until the hot tears are sliding down his face, obscuring his vision, until the only sound in his ears is the horrible, rasping breaths he’s drawing in, until his nose is filled with the scent of the roses that remind him of his mother’s perfume and her gentle smile and her iron will.
“Something the matter?” He’d asked, when she’d fallen asleep at the counter, head pillowed on her arms, jolting awake when another customer had rung in.
On the days Draco didn’t have a case, they would wake up a little earlier and instead of chucking three slices of bread in the toaster and hoping the egg wasn’t undercooked, they’d cook. Harry would cook shirtless and Draco would be scandalised
Draco and Harry don’t take turns to sit with Scorpius. He knows that’s what Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron do when Hugo’s autoimmune disease plays up. Aunt Hermione takes a couple of days off, then Uncle Ron. They’re divorced, not dysfunctional.
“Other things sound pretty good if we’re being honest,” Harry murmurs, looking up through his eyelashes, hoping against hope the tactic works.
He hates Tuesdays. More than once he’s gotten spectacularly drunk and promised himself he’s never coming back on a Tuesday.
Draco’s episode lasts well into the next day. On the 2nd of September, Draco emerges from his room to rap softly on Harry’s door, clothes dirty, body smelling of sweat and anxiety. Harry runs him a bath and leaves him be, and tries not to be too surprised when Draco comes out of it, towel wrapped around his skinny waist and falls face first into Harry’s bed.
When Draco looks back at him, there’s something so pained in his expression that Harry feels his heart break.
Slowly, gradually, it starts coming back. Hermione saying they would leave for the Weasley’s without him. Panic, pain, rage. Memories of the Forest of Dean, memories of Ron walking out. Memories of wanting to tear apart everything in sight, to damage as much as he was damaged. Memories, memories, memories.
Night falls and Draco teaches Harry to find the constellation he’s named after. Night progresses and they kiss, deeper and deeper until Draco doesn’t know where they both end and begin, an inseparable whole of tangled limbs and sheets and blankets and laughter.
“Morning,” he mumbles thickly through the taste of dust and cobwebs in his mouth. It’s a symptom of the Wasting Curse, the Healers had told him. It won’t allow him to taste food properly.
To realise that he’s in the midst of a panic attack and that Ginevra Weasley’s slim palm over his mouth and her other hand sure and firm on his wrist is all that is grounding him to reality.
“It’s okay,” Hermione says soothingly. “It’s alright, we don’t mind. Deep breaths, Draco, deep breaths.”
Draco learns, with every undone button and short, steady nod when Harry’s eyes flicker to his for affirmation and reaffirmation of his agreement, that there is no ruination in consent.
He skims it, eyes widening with every word, and when he finally reaches the end, where Harry has signed off, his eyes desperately search for the words that would make all the difference in the world.
He thinks, with the sort of warmth that comes from knowing something so deeply that it resonates in your bones, in your very essence that he’s falling in love.
This kiss fulfils some of the promises, eventually evolving into a line of hot, open-mouthed kisses being pressed down the column of Harry’s bared throat and as he closes his eyes and revels in the warm, wet heat of Draco’s mouth teasing at the sensitive skin, Parkinson’s arrival seems like a godsend.
Malfoy waits on the doorstep and Harry wonders why, and when an old, gnarled elf rivalling Kreacher in leathery weariness opens the door to peer up at the visitors, wonders why it hadn’t occurred to him that a prince would have servants.
He leans forward and places a chaste, dry kiss to Harry’s lips. When he pulls away, Harry whines at the dissatisfying loss of contact and Draco huffs an amused laugh.
“How long have I been out?” Harry asks, completely unaware of what time it had been when he had asked Draco to stay and fallen asleep with his thumb tracing patterns on Harry’s wrists. A warm feeling erupts in his chest at the reminder of the last look Draco had given him.
“Don’t get me wrong, being dead at sixteen is a better fate than being a Death Eater at sixteen trying not to fail. Being dead at sixteen is all I hoped for when
“An absolute nightmare,” Harry says, because the mere thought of his first birthday after actually defeating Voldemort being celebrated in Britain hadn’t crossed his mind. Now that it does, he’s exponentially more alarmed by the prospect of having to return.
He talks a lot when it’s just him and Scorpius. Fills the quiet room with his rich baritone, stories of places Scorpius will never see and people he will never meet. Scorpius thinks he should be a little more resentful of Death, but Harry Potter could have been a writer if he wasn’t an Auror, given his uncanny knack for making even the mundane act of walking down a street seem like something out of a fantasy novel. He finds himself unable to resent that which allows him to spend this much time with his father, taking trips down lanes as vivid with brimming life as Scorpius had been even a few vital years ago.
Harry snorts. “Merlin, yes. It’s the war fucking with Ron’s head. Makes him think there’s no time for anything, that he needs to rush it, needs to fill out some checklist by the time he’s twenty-one. ‘Mione’s been trying to get through to him.”
When he’s finally done, his office almost looks empty, his desk’s surface can finally be seen and Jemima looks positively ecstatic at the prospect of handing out files to surly Aurors who want to cast spells and not record their consequences.
“No, I haven’t forgiven you," Granger begins. "Forgiveness won’t come easily. I still hold grudges. I still hate what you stand for. But I’m willing to give you a chance.” She straightens up. “In fact it’s why I wanted to meet you.”
“I love you,” Scorpius hears, a low murmured whisper that feels too private for him to witness. “I’m sorry.” There’s a pause for a few seconds followed by a low humourless laugh.
Before the chairs came, before the bed, before the time Scorpius couldn’t get up without the help of magical levers or canes or stabilising potions, Aunt Hermione had asked him why he wasn’t more bitter. It had been in the hospital, on their third visit to the Healer after his diagnosis, when Harry and Draco weren’t looking at each other in the waiting room. She had given them a look when she had walked in, summoned by Scorpius’ discreet owl– a look so blatantly disgusted that even Draco Malfoy turned away.
“Since your response wasn’t a vehement ‘no, don’t touch me with your filthy mudblood hands’, I’m going to Apparate you,” she says pretty matter of factly. By the time the words sink in, the pull behind his navel is already a disorienting pressure at the back of his brain.
His secretary steps in from time to time, pointing a long, manicured finger at the ‘To be delegated’ pile and says in an imperious tone, ‘That needs to be higher.’
Draco tuts. “No, Potter. You want some sleep and want me around, you’re getting in and taking a damn shower. You reek. Can I trust you to stand up and not fall over for the ten minutes I will be leaving you alone?”
It screams money, but not the gaudy kind, the quiet kind that is made under tables and behind closed doors, the kind that hides in gilt-edged frames of ancestors and is used to pay off wands and mouths alike to do dirty bidding.
Potter rises when he is called upon, and the stifled gasp of half the courtroom is loud and jarring. Potter’s fire-ridden eyes snake their way around the pews and some of the surprised members lean back from the intensity of his gaze.
When long minutes pass and nothing is forthcoming, Draco groans internally. Of course Potter would want to see his face for this. Of course Potter would want to watch him flinch away, want to watch him cower.
But Draco refuses to be beholden to shackles. Refuses to be tied down by a guard who pleasured himself in the dingy cells of Azkaban by beating Draco black and blue once he got hold of the knowledge that Harry Potter would be testifying. Every time Draco closes his eyes, the cruel slant of the guard’s lips come back to him, the impact of each blow, the ache of it afterwards.
‘I might have taken the liberty to send them an owl stating you will be taking a leave of absence for a fortnight.’
So now, to hear Harry throw those words at him with the accuracy of a Bludger hitting its mark, it feels like a plunge into the cold water of the Great Lake.
Malfoy jerks up to look at him with eyes so wide that Harry’s alarmed. “What? Don’t tell me you’re homopho—”
Weasley continues to gape. Then he does the strangest thing and starts laughing. It starts off as a giggle and then it moves on to stifled laughter and then suddenly Weasley is clutching at his side and rolling on the floor hysterically shrieking. Alarmed Draco begins to back away when Weasley stops abruptly. He wipes his eyes, looks at Draco and says in a tone of wonder, “You two are a match made in heaven.”
He comes to this conclusion when he finds himself mentally cataloguing a difficult Arithmancy problem for his next conversation with her and finds himself, shockingly, looking forward to the prospect of it.
Draco inclines his head. His eyelashes flutter shut, and remain that way for a second longer than they should if he were as unaffected as he is trying to be. “Small mercies,” he says, without even a trace of bitter humour.
Harry indulges him, sucking the tip into his mouth, working it with the stiffened peak of his tongue, ruthless and unrelenting and Draco raises his head and crashes it back onto the stiff mattress of his interlocked palms.
“You,” Draco tries to keep his tone as matter-of-fact as possible, “are incapable of behaving like anything remotely resembling a good friend. Is there a reason?”
The urge to roll it, to see his son side by side with his parents was tempting. But it was too dangerous, and it wasn’t a privilege he should enjoy alone. Instead, he wrapped up the two Hallows in the third and with another wave to Neville and a kiss on Minerva’s cheek, he left Hogwarts for the last time as the Master of Death.
Draco laughs self depreciatingly. “If that letter was enough to erase all these years, we ought to be sitting in the Leaky with a pint in our hands. The best of friends.”
It’s from happier times. Scorpius is smiling, a fleck of chocolate on his chin, silver-grey eyes shining with the light of the stars that live on after his death.
For a second, the Wizengamot is silent. Draco feels the weight of it in his bones, the thoughts and biases of every cocked head, every shrewd eye, every analysing gaze that takes him in, from his tattered garb to his bruised arms to the way he cannot meet and hold anyone’s eyes. It doesn’t last—it’s barely a minute before the pews break into a flurry of murmured words, rapid whispering and furious scribbling.
“Do you need me to leave?” Harry asks, and oh, the question hurts because Draco doesn’t really want Harry to leave, but Harry staying is a trigger for the memories of a strange boy with a swollen face sitting in his living room, held at wand-point by Snatchers.
“Shall we enter?” Malfoy asks, turning towards him so suddenly that Harry jumps. Set against the backdrop of the ivy and the pale pillars, he looks less human and more artwork, a watercolour painting of old money and the weight of a name. An artist’s canvas, Harry thinks, experimented on with the shades of dappled summer sunlight and royalty.
startles him worse than he could have imagined it would. He’s worried about this moment many times, alone in bed on cold nights when Harry and him weren’t supposed to meet, but his aching, foolish heart wanted the comfort of those broad hands and strong shoulders and muscled thighs anyway. On those nights, he’d imagined Harry’s hands on Ginevra’s waist, his thighs against hers, his shoulders bracketing her into their bed. On those nights, he’d swallowed against the lump in his throat rising at the manufactured memory of those images, buried his face in pillows and had desperately tried to succumb to the non existent pull of sleep. On those nights he’d wondered what would happen if she were ever to find out.
the one who brought him here. Moreover, you’re the one who spoke for him at the trials. You’re the one who saved him from the Fiendfyre, you’re the one who time and time again ensured the bloke didn’t die! And yet somehow–” she cuts herself off with an incredulous laugh.
That vision shouldn’t be as hot as it turns out to be but Draco can’t bring himself to care as he pulls Harry down, hungrily kissing him, tasting himself inside his mouth. It should be disgusting, but it isn’t.
“Stay,” he whispers, doing his best to not get lost in Potter’s eyes which are still the same iridescent green, even in the darkness.
Draco doesn’t ask when he developed such an acute sixth sense so instead he closes the distance between them, walking over to stand beside him.
He’s making an effort, Harry realises, in a rush. He’s genuinely trying. His reaction to Malfoy’s questions suddenly makes hot guilt pool in the pit of his stomach, a roiling tension that makes him itch and fidget.
Draco snorts again. Takes another swig of whisky. He puts it down and opens the top button of his shirt.
Greg doesn’t write and Draco tries to not take it personally, tries to not let it sting the swollen part of his heart that still mourns Crabbe with every breath. Vince had been stupid, Vince had been destructive and hurtful and pigheaded until the very end, but Draco had loved him, a friend and a brother and when he’d been eaten by Fiendfyre, Draco’s childhood had been buried with him.
“The way it feels around your dick when they clench down and hold you there. It feels the way it does during a blowjob, only tighter, headier, so much better.” His hands have travelled down to the head of Draco’s dick and he swirls his finger around the slit, collecting the gathering precome and sucking it into his mouth. He meets Draco’s eyes, “The way they shout when they come, the way they tighten, almost impossibly, the way it feels like a fucking dream come true.”
Scorpius knows this is where Harry and Draco had gotten married, kissing each other in a public claim in full view of anybody and everybody who had ever mattered to them.
“Because you’re privileged, because you’ve always been privileged, and wanting to die in your secluded Italian villa because half your vaults are empty is an incredibly selfish thing to do when there are people in Britain who want to die because Voldemort decided to systematically go through their entire family for the simple crime of not being a pure-blood.”
When he looks back at Potter, Potter’s smiling. “Something real, then,” he says and the words are drenched in bittersweet surprise.
“Because you may have no sense of decorum, but I do and one does not go to a Ball to stand by the refreshments table and chat with Hermione and her Weasley.”
Draco swallows and nods. “But I… But I…” He doesn’t know how to frame it in a way that doesn’t make him sound either ungrateful or somehow delirious. “I don’t have to go back to Azkaban?”
Draco doesn’t know what he’s thinking when he closes the distance between them, brushing his lips softly across Harry’s in a chaste, tiny kiss that lingers for a split second.
“I didn’t want to push you away.” Draco sounds upset, like he genuinely believes needing a little space to have an episode is pushing Harry away. Something unforgivable.
Inside, Harry laughs. “Hahahaha, Mione. Very funny. Tryin’ tryin’a sound like Mal- Malfa- Malfoy. I’m not opening.”
Death shakes their head. “I am telling you I have been here since he reclaimed mastery. Found the Elder Wand. Found the Stone. Covered them in the Cloak.”
“Because your mother is still alive,” Potter says. His eyes are green, so green, even in the darkness of Draco’s room, even in the white glow of moonlight, a memory of a dead mother shrouding them. “Because you’re still a pure-blood in a society where prejudices exist, because it will take a while for society to be so completely reformed that the Mark on your arm, the one you can cover with long sleeves or another tattoo or makeup will take precedence over something as inane and arbitrary but as relevant as Blood Status.” He takes a sip of wine, and Draco feels shame shoot through him.
At first Draco had thought of telling her he just wasn’t interested in knowing the details of how Longbottom ended up streaking bare arsed through the common room or of how Pride and Prejudice was her favourite Muggle novel (though he had looked it up later, found it, read it and liked it more than he expected to) but something in her tone had stopped him.
“We did,” Harry says. His voice breaks on the syllables. If Draco’s lost himself at sea, Harry is crashing on the jagged rocks.
Instead of letting the secret hurt him further, he lets himself revel, just for a minute, in the moment, in the knowledge that he’s in the arms of the man he loves, being touched and kissed and pulled against a chest broad and firm and strong, beating with a heartbeat Draco hears in his own core.
Somewhere between killing the Dark Lord and ordering beers at the counter of a small but cosy pub in Shoreditch, the open book of his existence has slammed shut. The glimpses Draco catches of the man beneath the veneer of cheerful chivalry seem to be in a different language from the one Draco is fluent in.
. What I’m saying is if you don’t feel like attending the damn classes because the way things are over there is too much for you, you ask someone in the evening for the damned notes. If you don’t want to go through them because that’s too much for you, you put a copying charm and keep the damn copy. If applying the damn charm is too much for you, ask someone to do it for you. If asking someone is too much for you sometimes, tell them during one of your better moments that you need their fucking help.”
Draco isn’t sure Harry knows just how much his world has shifted in those few moments Harry spent telling him why he could stand to touch him. For so long Draco has avoided mirrors, avoided looking at any reflections, afraid of the reminders. But now, Harry’s soft words washing over him, he thinks of those marks the way Harry tells him to. Reminders of survival, not reminders of anyone claiming him.
In the safety of his own room where his expressions aren’t on display, Harry can admit, a little reluctantly to the fact that he’d have preferred the old Malfoy to this Draco. The snarls and the biting insults were well worn and safe territory—Harry knew how to give as good as he got. But this Draco is cool and collected and spares Harry nothing but a token survey every morning before leaving him to his own devices. If Harry packed his bags and left the next morning, he doubts Draco would notice.
“Yes, Sir, quite,” responds Granger. Her voice comes out weary but with an undercurrent of fondness that Draco thinks is directed at him, because he knows exactly what Granger thinks of Slughorn.
Draco feels the beginnings of horror creeping in. He had expected a somewhat inebriated Harry but this, this sounds like someone who has only been drinking for three days straight. He knocks again.
“Who?” he asks, wincing at the naked hope colouring his voice. This is what the darkness feeds on. He can feel it immediately, crowding in on him—hungry, yawning mouths eager to suck the faint glimmers of it from his soul.
“I didn’t go by tradition when naming my son. When we knew we would be having him, I went back to the Black library, where the journals were kept. Rooted around for weeks. Tried to find the perfect ancestor to name him after– someone honourable. Someone good. Harry wanted Sirius, but I wouldn’t have it. And then I read this story, and instead of trying to find someone with a history to saddle my son with, I chose a name that would be his and his family’s simultaneously. He was to be born a Scorpio, and it seemed to fit.”
Draco nods. The embarrassment is settling in, the utter shame of losing his composure this spectacularly in front of
“You got Pansy’s men all mixed up, I’m afraid,” Malfoy says and bites into his pizza. Harry picks at his olives.
He feels, rather than hears Draco rise from the chair. His hand is let go of, and Draco comes to stand beside him. He’s too tall– he always has been– towering over Scorpius’ low bed like a giant. But when Scorpius hooks a finger closer, the edges of his lips briefly lift before he drops to his knees.
“Gianni is believing his eyes! And Gianni is asking Master to put him down right this minute,” the elf croaks, tiny hands coming up to press against his ears.
He pauses briefly before opening the door, the stray thought that Potter of all people should never see him like this–
He nods. She moves to leave, standing by the fireplace, a pinch of powder in her hand. He looks down at the carpet and adds, almost as an afterthought, “Ms. Richards?”
“Do you want to spend a few hours in the library today in the evening?” She asks, eventually. “I have all these notes to go over for next week’s homework for both Transfiguration and Advanced Runes and I think we could study together.”
“I can,” says Draco, enunciating very clearly, his accent sharpening with every syllable, “do whatever I please. And I have
The last bit of hope that Draco was holding on to, that Harry might still be alright, that Harry is better off without hearing from him fades away, leaving Draco feeling like scum at the bottom of a shoe. Repeatedly slamming his head against the wall, he tries to feel like less of a bastard but all his efforts go to waste. He feels like even more of one instead.
It tastes like treason, and for Draco, who has been drinking the poison of it for the last few years of his life, it tastes like his father’s curt reprimands and his mother’s coaxing caresses and Pansy’s pride.
If this is what created Bellatrix and the Snatchers, despite himself, Draco understands. Somewhat. Even his father’s smooth edges came back ruffled and haunted after his brief stay.
It’s a feeling he hasn’t felt in a long time which is why it takes so long to place it but Harry has a feeling that he’s floating. That he’s weightless in time and floating and doesn’t need anything more to be added to his life for him to die happy.
Draco stops laughing. “And I you,” he says quietly. He looks to be verging on another apology and Harry is sick of it.
But he understands that. He understands not talking to the Death Eater, the bloke who stood by while the Carrows spewed Unforgivables, the snob who made almost everyone’s life a living hell from First Year itself. If he’d been in their shoes, he’d probably have cast a few unnoticed jinxes and hexes by now. They’re being merciful, really.
Harry stands in the middle of the room, swaying on his feet. He inhales sharply, a ragged gasp of air and falls to the floor in a spectacular heap of black robes and sallow skin.
“No. I thought I would go back to Hogwarts to repeat seventh year but I didn’t think I would be welcome.”
Had they looked away from each other when caught staring across the table? Had Harry fiddled with his ring? Had Draco aborted an attempt to reach for Harry when he’d seen the dead look in Harry’s eyes?
Draco isn’t certain when it happened, but by the evening of Harry’s birthday, Pansy and Harry aren’t friends, but the ice between them has thawed just enough for the day to have been enjoyable despite the awkwardness. They’d gone out for breakfast which had been derailed enough by a brief bout of rain to become brunch. Pansy had regaled Draco with stories of Blaise’s letters from the USA and Daphne’s attempts to find a job, both of which were sad if you let yourself dwell on reality. Draco finds out Astoria is doing quite well in school and that Pansy’s elder sister is engaged to be married.
Draco is startled into a bitter laugh. “Are you serious?” he asks, when Potter simply stares. "That was… that wasn’t even a sliver of what I deserve.”
Thinking of all the side-eyes he’d received from curious fellow customers and wary shopkeepers when he’d stepped in without bothering with Glamours, Harry sighs. The idea of having to repeat the process from start to finish is repulsively unappealing. While what he bought at Knockturn was technically legal but unsavoury enough for Diagon to not provide for, there are definitely things on the dusty shelves of the secluded shops that Harry would rather go the rest of his life without encountering again. He bends to salvage what he can, wand sparking with an eagerness to fix the broken glass when Malfoy’s voice tears him out of his thoughts.
“I am hoping I might be more than just this by then,” Draco says, the honesty burning its way through his system. It’s a direction he has forced himself to take, even when his honed instincts scream at him to toss enough Galleons in the right direction and make all of this nasty stuff go away. He won’t be his father.
Malfoy’s mouth is open in wonder. It is a strange expression on the face Harry is used to seeing smirking or talking or frowning angrily but in a way it is rather endearing. He appears… almost innocent. Then he almost slaps himself in the face for thinking about Malfoy as endearing. The prat repeatedly tried to kill him.
The scar goes right across his torso, a careless slash of angry magic. It stretches from above his right nipple and ends somewhere close to his hip. It is a thin but prominent line, a reminder of his sixth year, his failures and shortcomings and his supposed victories which were again, failures. Perhaps greater ones because betrayal is the greatest failure of them all.
“Feels the same when it’s inside. I know from experience,” Harry says, the matter of fact tone still there.
Seeming to sense Draco is serious this time, Harry immediately leans up, looming over Draco. There’s a reassuring look in his eyes that puts Draco’s heart at greater ease than his words, “I do. I wouldn’t hurt you, ever.”
. This is pain drawn into a grotesque figure, despair turned into a dark ocean with sinister shapes lurking behind the curved angle of each wave.
“Alohomora,” he whispers at the lock, wary of touching anything with his hand. The heavy bolt on the inside slides aside soundlessly and the gate swings open with a slight creaking noise. Wand held at the ready, he steps in through the gate and surveys the area. There are no house elves, Harry knows. All of them have been seized by the Ministry and employed in the Ministry of Magic itself. Narcissa Malfoy had left for France after being acquitted of all War crimes and Lucius Malfoy was rotting in Azkaban with a life-imprisonment sentence with no possibility of parole. And so, Harry thinks, the knowledge making him slightly uneasy, Malfoy should be here, completely alone. The Manor is a tall imposing tower of stone and for one moment, sympathy courses through him. Grimmauld is smaller than the Manor and even then, when neither Hermione nor Ron are in, Harry feels alone in a space too big to be safe, to be comfortable. To be alone in what used to be Voldemort’s… house, it can’t be easy.
He smiles at her. “I’ll do my best. And if I can’t,” he stops, resting his chin on his palm, pretending to think, “I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I don’t exist.” He laughs a little to himself and at Hermione’s confused, blank look, says, “Inside joke.”
Draco hesitates but Harry doesn’t. His hands reach up to cradle Draco’s face and he barely has a split second to appreciate how large Harry’s hands really are before he’s being tugged forward, meeting Harry’s lips in a searing kiss.
what he’s doing. All those damn smirks and the revelations and the rubbish stories that he apparently didn’t give a damn about up until tonight.”
He knows from the get-go that it’s bad. He wakes up, too hot and restless, but limbs too heavy to move. Harry’s head is pillowed on his chest, a delicate weight on most days. Today it feels stifling in the way a lover’s touch should not.
“There’s an easier solution for this,” Parkinson points out. “You both could share in Potter’s and I’ll just stay in yours.”
, he notices she looks sleepless, the bruises under her eyes deep and dark. Her hair is longer than it was at Hogwarts, but it’s the awkward length of terrible upkeep that Harry knows all too well and her skin is pale and sallow.
“And then…” Harry continues, and his voice sounds choked, sounds broken. “And then, when I stay the morning after, we’ll wake up to each other and you can say it then. And I will either start laughing or start crying and whatever I do, you will kiss me through it. And we’ll go out for breakfast.”
Malfoy keeps his eyes on his pizza. “In fifth year, Pansy started dating Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he says.
He startles at the use of his name. In the strangeness of the situation, it barely makes a difference and she has been using it periodically all day but it still seems foreign coming from her. “I say I’m going to hear you out,” he replies when he has gained his bearings. He has no idea what else to say.
The house can’t have more than two floors, but it makes up for it in the sprawling decadence of its setting, stretching on both sides with the careless grace of an aristocrat’s brainchild. Upon closer inspection, the carvings appear to be of floral motifs and delicately chiselled leaves. The magic of it blooms under Harry’s questing palm, a closed stone rosebud blossoming against the white wall.
“I thought I asked you to shut up,” Harry whispers, and then his hot, slightly chapped, perfect mouth is settling onto Draco’s and swallowing his tiny, involuntary gasp.
Harry returns home late on Saturday evening, his Auror uniform sticking to his body like a second skin that is both uncomfortable and undesirable, to find Draco fast asleep on the couch in front of the fireplace, a book on his chest.
It really isn’t. Uncontrollable depression isn’t something one wishes to be Potion induced. He stares at her before nodding slowly.
‘How is that safe?’ Draco asks, alarmed. ‘How do you know there isn’t any of those lying around  that you missed?’
Harry finds Parvati sitting on the steps to the Divination Tower, Lavender’s curly head cradled in her lap.
“I want to see David,” Potter says and for a split second Draco is surprised he even knows what David is. His ever traitorous mind superimposes Potter’s face, sculpted like a dark god’s onto the fine boned grace of David’s musculature. Potter’s curling hair, his white streak of the magnificent scar, his eyes emotive and expressive behind the glasses. Draco imagines it all set in stone for the world to see and for the first time mourns his lack of artistic skill.
If you have the time, I would love to go over the PMC project with you and some preliminary outlines for our proposal to the Wizengamot. The quicker we start, the more hope we have of a sympathetic Council. I would suggest meeting at Grimmauld Place but after last time, you might be averse to it. If you’re available, please do suggest a viable location and we can meet.
Malfoy’s possible reaction to that comment perches on the edge of his consciousness. Harry imagines him saying in that haughty accent, “You didn’t find Potter intellectually disadvantaged? Some Mind Healer.”
Now, in the darkness, fingers tracing absent patterns onto each other’s skin, thoughts racing and catching up, and tangling, perhaps, there is peace.
The warm, wet heat moves further down, to his thighs and Draco knows how much Harry likes being bitten and touched there, but now it only serves to amp up Harry’s painful arousal even higher as Draco sinks his teeth gently into the soft skin of Harry’s inner thigh. He pulls off and soothes it with his tongue and if Harry had his hands free, he would have probably strangled Draco by now for doing this to him, but fucking Salazar, it feels so good.
Harry’s hands come to grip Draco’s shoulders, and his hips buck in a harsh motion, bringing Harry’s pelvis flush against Draco’s arse as he bottoms out. His cock nails Draco’s prostate dead on and the stimulation is enough for Draco to gasp and cry out. “Yes, just like that,” he says, trying to keep his eyes from rolling back into his head. “Just luck that, Harry, please.”
, Harry had murmured half asleep and half delirious to Scorpius’ picture, unaware that the real Scorpius was sitting and listening to him with a dead heart plummeting lower and lower.
Harry simply sighs and casts a wandless Tempus. The clock says it’s 9:14 pm. “We started at six fifteen,” Harry says by way of explanation.
Draco places his knees on either side of Harry’s hips, effectively holding him down without touching him.
The words catch him off guard. Blaise’s almost mocking mistress and definitely mocking gay lover echo in his head. Ironic, that Ginevra should be offering him more dignity than even his best friend did.
He collapses on the bed, exhausted, his wrists hurting from all the tugging and pulling he’s done, his toes cramping from the clench they had been forced into, his body aching from the continuous exhausting movement.
rings like a gong through the fog of his brain. The buzz of chatter and the footsteps of people, the crush of tourists and locals fade into background noise. Behind the sunglasses, Malfoy’s eyes are wide.
He gropes on the bedside table, cruelly rejoicing when his fingers close around the glass that had been his only companion the previous night. With every ounce of strength he can muster in his groggy, sleep mussed condition, he flings it backwards, hoping it hits the floor or the wall instead of his bare legs on the bed. He is in no mood to pick out glass shards from his calves or wipe whisky dregs from his sheets.
When they go back to Grimmauld, Weasley leans into Hermione’s ear and says something which Draco wishes he had overheard because the result is Hermione’s cheeks reddening obviously. She looks towards Harry and Draco briefly, saying, “Boys, don’t burn the house down!” And then with an obviously suggestive look in Weasley’s direction saunters up the stairs.
He drinks half the cup standing there and pondering, before abruptly choosing to pay Harry a visit in his room.
There’s a hand on the back of his neck and it’s the anchor he’d been looking for—not overwhelming or claustrophobic, but something steady to keep him grounded.
Harry slumps, exhausted on Draco’s chest and stays there for a while, unmoving, a breathing weight on Draco’s chest that is oddly comforting.
“I’ll open the dor justa prove ya wrong,” Harry says gleefully. A few seconds and some crashes later, the door creaks open. Harry blearily blinks into the light and rubs his eyes vigorously. “An’ now I’m seein’ things,” he says mournfully. He sways and instinctively Draco reaches out to support him. With his hand around his waist, Draco takes in the sight of Harry. A three-day diet of alcohol has darkened the hollows under his eyes and his skin is pallid. He looks awful and reeks of whisky and yet the confused, bewildered man in his arms is the most beautiful sight Draco has ever witnessed.
He keeps repeating the same words, that she’s safe, that the War is over, that her friends are alright. That the War is over. He keeps at it till her breathing calms, till she stops struggling. Tentatively he removes the hand from her mouth and she takes in two deep gulps of air with her eyes closed.
“Prize pet you got there,” Malfoy snorts. Hermione shoots him a warning glare and Harry clenches his fist to keep from throwing the notepad at Malfoy’s blond head.
house where you’ve kindly let us stay.” Her anger isn’t misplaced but Harry wants to set the kitchen on fire at the unfairness of her words. When he doesn’t say anything, she shakes her head and says, “Honestly, Harry, that’s a low blow.”
“Not just the fact that you want Pureblood and Muggle cultural exchanges. The fact that you thought Malfoy would be a good candidate, that’s brilliant too. I mean, I wouldn’t have thought that prick would agree but if he does, he is a rather perfect candidate.”
It’s always been that way, since childhood, when all three of them would sleep in the same king sized bed in the upstairs master bedroom, cuddled up together. Scorpius would have his head buried in Harry’s chest as Harry stroked his hair, singing him lullabies when he would be on sugar highs, unable to sleep. Draco’s arm would be curled around his middle, tapping a soothing rhythm against Scorpius’ knuckles, drawing gentle patterns against his palm.
“No, listen, Granger, being friends with me, it can’t be advantageous to you! You have to think before you make grandiose statements like that!”
It has been going much the same way for the last half an hour. Kingsley has presented the budgetary requirements and the legal changes to be made while Hermione has expounded on the necessity of the project. Most of the heads are nodding along in deep appreciation while a few remain obviously sceptical. Draco is sure that they will get a two-thirds majority when one old witch in plum robes with a silver S.P. embroidered on, asks in the ensuing silence of Hermione’s closing statement, “But what about Draco Malfoy?”
“You’re gone on him, aren’t you,” Pansy whispers as they walk back towards the hotel. “You’ve gone all daft, staring and blushing and looking away.”
He lets his shoulders slump. “I don’t know where else to go,” he says instead because Slytherins keep secrets when there is a price to be paid for their revelations. Draco is worthless now. “I told you, I don’t know what to do.”
They remain in blissful silence for some more time, simply enjoying each other’s warmth, each other’s comfort. Draco has memorised Harry’s breathing pattern. Eventually he asks, “If we were to you know, do that, what would you um, I mean, how would you like to, Merlin, I mean–”
Draco doesn’t know what to say to that admission of forgiveness so he attempts to lighten the mood by saying, “Enough for today. What have you got for lunch today?”
He stops himself before he can go further down the road. In, one, two three, out. In, one, two, three, out. In, one, two, three, out.
Harry’s mouth is dry. He doesn’t understand why but the set of Malfoy’s shoulders, his fists clenched by his side, his mouth curving around the words, is heavier than it should be. Something about the moment is meaningful in a way Malfoy isn’t otherwise.
Ron pops his head back in and utters a weary, “Really, ‘Mione? And here I was looking forward to dinner.” Then on second thought he adds, “Harry, mate, can you let go of your arse-cheeks now?”
He remembers digging his fingernails into his palms to keep from running to Harry’s door and ask him why they could not all lie down together sometime like they used to a couple nights a week.
“Tell me about you,” Pansy eventually says, when she’s spoken long enough for her voice to go a little hoarse. Dessert arrives on delicate plates, and Draco watches Harry perk up a little. He digs into the treacle tart, licking icing sugar off his lips with a blissed-out look on his face and by the time Draco can steel himself enough to look away, Pansy’s picked up on the little exchange with a slowly growing smirk.
“Harry,” Draco gasps when Harry’s fingers start on his trousers’ buttons. “You wanted to take this slow and I’m not sure if you should be doing that if you– oh, Merlin, oh yes!– want to– fuck, fuck– keep it, uh, slow–”
His wand’s in his hand, placed at Malfoy’s bobbing Adam’s apple. He knows he should let it go, but he
But now, as he watches Draco cling to the ring on his finger like a child and Harry’s desperate attempts to sort out the unravelling threads of his life, he wonders whether he was ever correct in those assumptions.
Except it’s not. Later at night, Hermione and Ron are lying on either side of him in the tiny bedroom all three of them are holed up in.
He’s been watching Harry fall out of love with him for years now. Pulling away, drawing up his walls and throwing himself into work to the point of self-destructive hours spent cooped up in his office is the only solution he’s found.
Draco stumbles. Harry reaches out to catch him and in the process, they’re pulled towards each other, Harry’s hand on Draco’s wrist and Draco’s hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“Give it back,” he says, and is mortified by the hoarseness in his voice. Or he would be if he cared.
He blinks once more, and the undefinable face of what he called Death is back, swirling and indeterminate.
When Harry pulls away, he hates himself more for wanting him to do it again, for having the plea so ready on his lips that one wrong word and he would be begging for it.
Draco was so broken before he met Harry. Not Harry Potter, but this Harry who cracks terrible jokes across diner tables and talks him down from his anxious highs, Harry who chews his bottom lip when he writes his friends letters, Harry who sleeps curled into the space between his shoulder and his throat every night. Dating doesn’t seem a big enough word to hold what they are together. Dating bursts at its seams when Draco tries to imagine shoving themselves into its constraints, like an overstuffed pillow groaning under the weight of too much cotton and belligerence.
In another couple of minutes, his ankles are bound to handles at the foot of the bed that Draco must have conjured because Harry’s fairly sure they weren’t there before. He’s spread eagled and vulnerable on the bed with barely any capability to move.
“Should I wake him up?” Scorpius asks, unsure what to make of that last statement. “I’d really rather not, I don’t think he’s getting much sleep these days.”
When he steps out of the Floo, he spends a second looking down at himself and dusting the ash off his robes. When he looks back up, he does a double take and blinks a couple of times to be sure he isn’t seeing things.
She shrugs again. “We’ve been together since Hogwarts, Draco. He’s always been something of an explorer. Hoping he’d be satisfied to simply settle with me would be naive, and growing up with six brothers breaks you out of naivety by the time you’re three and sitting in the tool shed with a broken broom.”
The only person he bothered to tell was his mother, when she was lying in bed, some ‘mystery illness’ a flinty eyed Healer had told him that was wrecking her body. He’d told her in the quiet calm of twilight descending in Wiltshire, the windows darkening with every passing moment. The confession had twisted like a knife, but it had set him free from the haunting secrecy he forced himself to maintain.
He turns towards where Draco is still lying gasping on Harry’s body, fingers digging into a pulse point that stopped pulsing a long while ago and says, “We’re family. We wait.”
Sometimes they happen in places like his tongue, or his heart, or his nail beds– nothing helps then, but they try anyway.
The other voices are fading from his brain, and part of him, the most treacherous, dangerous, self-destructive part wants to hold tightly on to the comfort of his mother’s voice, wants to reach it, reach her. But mostly, they’re all being drowned out by the numbers and the calm chant of them, and when his lungs fill with burning air, he almost collapses with relief.
Not that they don’t already, but as a free man, Harry would feel no guilt when meeting those yearning gazes. A crowded bar with a pretty bird on a barstool waiting for a drink to be bought, a Ministry event with some bloke in a Muggle three-piece entertaining Harry with tales of Quidditch matches during the boring speeches Harry fidgets through. An old friend in a coffee shop, them finding out they have more shared experiences and commonalities than they’d ever thought to explore in Hogwarts.
Harry looks away and then murmurs in a shaky voice, ‘It was a while ago, really. Nothing to worry about now.’
Through it all, neither Draco nor Harry issued any statements. Draco did not confirm what Selwyn had told him. Harry did not relay what had led him to arrest Selwyn under those charges in the first place.
The corners of her lips are twitching as though she is trying to hold back a smile and Draco can’t help it but he bursts out laughing.
“I assure you, Potter’s sex life is no business of mine,” he manages thickly, the words tasting like dirt in his mouth. “I would rather not be put off my coffee.”
In these years, Draco has learned Harry’s body like an instrument; he knows exactly how to play every nerve like a chord and every sensitive spot like a harmony. But never, in six years of their relationship has Harry relinquished his control to this extent.
“Sometimes you’re right,” he says, trailing a finger along the glass. “Sometimes, I wish you weren’t.”
“It’s my birthday in five days,” Malfoy says. They’re drinking wine, sitting in the drawing room which is a cosily minimalistic affair done in cream and gold. Malfoy has loosened the top two buttons of the shirt he wears underneath his robes which he lost sometime earlier in the afternoon. He’s not drunk, not even tipsy, but his tongue has loosened somewhat.
leaves its scars in the trembles between Draco’s toes, the nerves in his calves that will never heal quite right.
There was a war and Draco fell and Harry died. The war ended and Draco dragged himself back up on his feet, mother’s son, father’s disappointment and Harry rose from the dead, mother’s son, father’s joy, the world’s saviour.
“Got held up at the office,” Harry murmurs back, stopping about a foot from Draco. He’s close enough for Draco to smell the peppermint on his breath, but still much too far away for his body yearning to touch and kiss and feel.
Luna is sitting in a chair by the bed, wearing warm yellow robes. Her earrings, Harry thinks has moth wings on them. The serene smile on her face is contagious and before he knows it, he’s shooting her a weary smile and saying, “It’s good to see you.”
Draco barely has time to process Harry’s words before he’s lying on the bed on his stomach, gripping at the sheets as Harry presses quick kisses along his spine, to his tailbone, lower, lower, lower.
“Then you’re here for me?” Scorpius asks. It seems right somehow. Fitting. He doesn’t know why the stranger’s presence slots into that possibility so well, but it seems to align with cosmic certainty.
Draco shakes his head and swallows before looking away. ‘I just thought…’ he mutters quietly, ‘that this year you wouldn’t remember.’
“Doing well,” he says, grateful for the distraction. “We just got our new shipment of Moleskine journals.”
“Shut the fuck up, Pans,” Draco hisses and Harry wants to be amused but all he feels is a sick lurch in the pit of his stomach.
“You’re angry,” he murmurs, wondering if this is typical Tuesday evening crisis rage or if something has gone wrong at the office.
Malfoy dutifully puts the elf down after a moment and the disoriented creature blinks twice before bowing deep enough to touch his nose to the ground.
But Granger’s idea didn’t stop there, he soon found out. She’d turned around to look at Draco, determination flickering across her features, spatula in hand and said, “But I have a plan for the Purebloods too.” Draco had merely raised an eyebrow, resting his cheek on his palm, letting his expression convey his skepticism. She had sighed and said that Pureblood children, even ones as accepting and open to change as the Weasleys were sheltered and hidden entirely from the Muggle world. They had no idea of its machinations, its developments, the way it worked. The magical community had in its efforts to stay hidden entirely isolated itself and Purebloods had borne the unfortunate brunt of this sheltered upbringing. “Telephones, Draco,” she had exclaimed when he had shrugged his shoulders. Completely unaware of what that was, he had shot Granger a blank look. She had thrown up her hands and said, “Exactly my point!”
“Your trauma is not something you can schedule into a planner, Draco. These things happen. I get nightmares and I wake up paralysed. I get panic attacks and I forget where I am. Some mornings are not made to be mornings on which we can move. There are weights even we can’t bear.”
“Probably two. We were doing the final review of the Project proposal and everything is all set. He came up here a while ago to check on you and well, I guess that happened.”
Harry doesn’t know what he’s talking about until he remembers. Malfoy’s letter to him after his testimony. A stiff thank you, a formal apology, a promise to make himself scarce from Harry’s life. He hadn’t been in the most stable frame of mind and the letter is a pile of flaky ashes now. He knows Ron and Hermione received letters too but he has no idea what they had done with them. Whether they had forgiven Malfoy or not.
“What?” Draco asks, looking up from the newspaper he had been peering at. It’s local, and obviously in Italian. Draco’s Italian is rusty but he’s trying to pick it back up. He looks adorable now, hair mussed and mind barely present in the conversation.
The elf tilts his head to one side. The innocently large blue eyes do absolutely nothing to conceal a strange mirth bubbling in them.
Harry swirls his tongue around the head, and this time Draco sobs, a wanton, keening sound and with the last remaining shreds of coherency, manages a strangled, “
Harry surreptitiously makes a few extra buds bloom for Draco’s amusement. Draco Conjures likenesses of pixies that dart among the flowers for Harry to smile at.
He’s sitting on the sofa by the time Potter nears it, his heavy gait giving away his pent up frustration. Potter moves light as a cat until he’s angry, when every aspect of him seems to radiate
Harry can’t stop his own grin from widening when the tips of Draco’s hair gently brush the bridge of his nose. “Marginally.”
“Snape was in time to save my life, not to make me look pretty,” Draco says, sharper than intended. He’s had that comment flung his way before as though being scarred is something to be ridiculed.Then knowing Harry didn’t mean it quite like that, he softens and says, “I didn’t want you to react like this. It’s alright.”
Draco Malfoy is a coward. He’s a liar at the best of times and pathetic at his worst. But in some moments, when Harry questions every moral he has ever been proud of having, Draco hits him with a bout of such painfully clear honesty that Harry is forced to reevaluate his understanding of the man entirely.
“No, I’m not calling you one, of course I’m not. Without you, we’d likely all be dead. If you’re a Muggleborn and you still managed what you did, we should
Draco promises himself that when he wakes up, he will Pensieve this dream. Harry’s lips under his are warm and a little dry but the heat of their mouths moving together makes up for it. It’s smooth and Draco gasps a little when Harry teases his lower lip with the point of his tongue. Harry smiles against his mouth and Draco wonders how his imagination came up with something so wonderfully perfect.
In the darkness of the night with Potter’s green eyes appearing a dark blue, with Draco’s heart beating in his throat, his ears, his mouth, with a wand between them that they’re both holding, the admission feels like something more.
He lifts his hand and places it over the raised marks of the scar. “It feels dirty,” he admits finally. “So dirty. The Mark was my choice, no matter how pressured I was into it. The one on my chest is understandable. The others… well, they’re there. Horrible memories attached to them, would prefer it if I woke up one morning and saw them gone but this… this is the one I hate the most. This is the one that reminds me how little control I had. And I feel dirty. So filthy, so tainted and so fucking dirty.”
And here he is, staring at Harry Potter cutting an imposing figure in the small doorway of a Camden motel, looking into the depth of nervousness and guilt in those verdant eyes and telling himself he’s here for the sex.
“Aunt Petunia wanted to, I think. She was bringing some ointment when Uncle Vernon asked her what she was doing. And when she told him, he laughed and called for Dudley to tell him he was proud of the fine son he was bringing up. He didn’t let Petunia bring in the ointment.”
He keeps his eyes on Potter’s face as his shaking hand unclenches and comes up to touch the smooth wood he has not felt against his palms in what feels like decades. The Unicorn hair core thrums with magic and the sweat on his palms dries up, as though the wand has taken that decision for him.
“What’s happened to him?” Draco finally has the courage to ask. Granger hesitates for a moment before saying, “He dissociates.”
. But he sorts through them just enough to comprehensively say, “Your hands. Your mouth. Whatever you’re willing to give.”
Draco’s eyes fly open and he looks at Harry with a sort of desperate longing as he says, ‘I know. I know. I’m so close, Harry, please.’
Draco nods. He doesn’t think he can explain to Potter that the only reason his words stung is because Draco wholeheartedly agrees. His presence anywhere is pointless, as are his efforts, as are his actions. He’s ensured that effectively during the War.
He gets up, groaning when the motion causes the world to tilt dangerously, black spots appearing before his eyes. He blinks a few times, adjusting to reality separate from the darkness beneath his covers, and takes in the sight of his bedroom. There’s broken glass everywhere (thankfully not on the bed). He summons his bedroom slippers with a lazy flick, certain that he’ll shred his soles to pieces if he tries to navigate the mess in his current hungover and distinctly discombobulated state.
He turns to face Potter for the first time since he left their hotel room in Camden, and his breath nearly punches out of him.
Harry smiles, because he’d hoped it would have that reaction. “Kiss me,” he says. Draco obliges willingly, dipping his head and pulling Harry into another kiss that has Harry weak and trembling at the knees. He tucks an errant lock of hair behind Draco’s air and revels in the little surprised hitch of his breath. Draco is always taken aback by gentleness—a hand curving around his waist, fingers filling the space between his, a soft kiss pressed to his sharp cheek—but his reactions make it worth it.
“Are you even in charge?” Scorpius asks, annoyed. He’s met with an infuriating smile that seems to permeate the dark effortlessly.
Scorpius breathes out. It strikes him that breathing isn’t something he needs to do, or even something that functions for him anymore. It’s just a familiar motion he is repeating in the strangeness that is… whatever the bloody hell this is. Which brings him to–
“Well he is!” Hermione says, throwing her hands up and knocking Harry’s glasses off his face. “Sorry Harry—but he talks more! And he doesn’t just talk about being whatever he was to the Minister’s Undersecretary—”
Harry turns on his side to look at him, eyes darkening slightly. “What other things?” He asks, voice low.
There’s a knock and he looks up, startled. “Come in,” he calls, certain it’s Potter because the elves are not in the habit of knocking.
He means it when he says that there is no place for shame in the life of a Potter-Malfoy scion– if he’d been able to remember the slightest hints of buried love that folded itself in overshadowed by the looming demon of pride, he’d have pushed his fathers with bald comments towards each other. Set them up on blind dates, locked them in a room together, that sort of thing. And if those didn’t work, he’d have sat them down and told them plain as day that they should at least talk.
“You came up with the idea and it is a good idea so Draco and I can hash out what we want and you can write down. Maybe even, I don’t know, throw around a few ideas of your own.” Malfoy rolls his eyes at that.
and Harry digs his fingers into Draco’s shoulders to stave off the whine that threatens to erupt from his throat.
“I shower after work,” Harry had told him once, when Draco had asked what cologne had such longevity as to be effective after a full day of gruelling Auror work.
He knows that the second Draco touches his dick, he’s going to explode and maybe that’s why Draco completely ignores it in favour of moving down his abdomen, lower and lower, until he reaches Harry’s bollocks, heavy and swollen.
“When I came here,” Malfoy says and Harry is jerked rudely out of his reverie, “Father told me Firenze wasn’t done justice to by the Muggles.”
The sated, sleepy smile Harry gives him soothes the ache in Draco’s heart that hasn’t gone away for a long, long time.
The cold in his insides at knowing he had cocked up a good thing right in front of him without even trying. Without doing anything but kissing the man he wanted, he man he dreamed of, back.
He doesn’t take very long to pick up on something and once he does, he doesn’t forget. In three days he knows how not to pulverise Draco’s toes, in six he knows how to follow fairly well.
“Teach me,” he says and the words are so unexpected that Harry is left reeling from the force of them.
Harry makes Draco feel like an unstable firework shaking and quivering. An explosive Draco is an unpredictable Draco. Dangerous. But falling apart? Draco has done that a thousand and one times and if there’s anything he knows, deep and certain, it is how to fall apart with a smile and a wink.
“Where to?” He asks bewildered and wary. He’s somewhat sure she will not lead him to a slaughterhouse, even if she does appear to be slightly unhinged with these cryptic requests and questions but in the post-war climate, one can never be completely sure.
Sometimes she asks him about his life and at first Draco wanted to remain cold and aloof, share no details and remain in the shadows. Over time, he realises he doesn’t really have anything to say about anything because his existence now is a summary of
on unsuspecting children. I have firsthand knowledge of this. It led to great disappointment from all his family members except Narcissa Malfoy. At the very worst, he was a schoolyard bully but”—Potter braces himself visibly for what he’s about to say—“so were arguably my father and Sirius Black, my godfather, two of the men hailed today as war heroes and martyrs of the resistance. They were both given a chance to redeem themselves, and they did, despite Sirius’ unfortunate and unfair stint in Azkaban. How fair would this trial be if a seventeen-year-old boy isn’t offered the same chance?”
Impatiently, Harry shakes his head. “We got off on the wrong foot and remained that way for seven years. It’s time to wipe that slate clean, it’s been too long. And I’ve save your life too many times for us to not be on better terms. So hey, I’m Harry Potter.”
There’s a sound, an awful, violent, earth-shattering sound shaking the core of Harry’s soul, rocking the foundations of the stones he’s kneeling on. There’s a sound and it’s gathering, there’s a sound and it’s shattering, there’s a sound and Harry feels the vibrations of it in his chest, in his magic, in every isolated cell of himself.
Draco’s sitting at the breakfast table, legs propped up on it, the newspaper clutched in his white-knuckled grip. He’s not reading it, Harry can tell, just staring. Giving himself a purpose till he can leave for work and throw himself into whatever cases he’s allowed to pile up during his leave of absence.
He looks up, and he glares with a darkness so deep that the woman flinches slightly. “But my son is dead. And he will continue to remain so.”
Draco doesn’t think he can watch Harry walk away right now. Not the first time he’s seen him since the realisation that despite everything, he’s in love with the man.
His cock is hard and leaking precome on his stomach as he arches slightly, trying to relieve the unbearable pressure building up within him.
At the grand old age of sixteen, when Draco is a comforting presence near his hip in the mornings and Harry reminds him of days gone by long ago when they would sit in bed together and read from picture books at night, these questions are a waste of precious time. He relegates only the time he is already wasting to them, especially since he’s unlikely to come up with any answers. It puts him in an adequately pensive mood, and though they stopped wearing matching outfits around the time Scorpius was six years old, ten years later it’s transformed to a matching state of mind in the moments spent together.
Harry thrusts his finger in shallow, gentle movements, pushing in and pulling out until only the skin above his nails remains pressed to Draco’s hole.
The shifting, watery features are suddenly solid, as though they’d been that way all along, and Scorpius gasps. Dominique Weasley is sitting in front of him, auburn hair done up in two French plaits. She looks just as he remembers her– full of youthful beauty, a smattering of freckles on her nose. He remembers her lying pale and still in the coffin, Fleur’s wrecked sobs and Bill’s trembling hands as they lowered her into the soil– Molly’s screams that she was only twelve.
Draco’s eyes widen, he’d thought Harry had wanted him to be loud, to make no secret of his pleasure, to not shield his feelings.
“No, I know. I just… there’s really nothing tying you to me anymore. So if you want to leave… which you obviously do, because you’ve bought a flat and everything… you can do it for good.”
Kingsley and Hermione present it together– a deadly alliance of politically lucrative words and sheer force of will uniting in purpose. Draco is seated in the gallery with Harry on one side and Weasley to Harry’s other side, holding hands in a chain, waiting and watching with bated breath.
Malfoy pauses, his fork halfway to his mouth. He puts it down, swallows a couple times before saying, “Nothing much. I’m trying to fix the Manor the best I can.” He eats a bite and apparently thinking his answer was insufficient, goes on to add, “Well, you know, I do write to my mother, fix up the garden, things, things like that.”
Muggle advancements, Granger said, would help the Wizarding World. Telephones, medicine, university, social education, all of it. So for the two years of their lives that Muggleborns were to spend learning about magic, Purebloods would learn about everything that… wasn’t magic. Draco had wanted to laugh. He had wanted to point at Granger and exclaim, “You think Muggles can help us?”
Draco nods. His anxiety is trying to come back, trying to make his brain spin right out of control. Talk about inopportune moments.
“I missed my mother,” Malfoy says, and it’s Harry’s turn to drop his fork. “We were sitting outside, and there were roses. She loves roses, her perfume always smells of them. And she—she tends the Manor’s rose gardens by herself. They’re probably falling to ruins now.”
But then he’d gone to Hogwarts and met the Patil twins who wore their bangles with pride and unabashedly perused brochures for lehengas and saris, who had asked him if he’d ever been to India and which part of it his father’s family had been from and had rushed to pacify him when he’d stuttered over the shame of not knowing the answers.
Draco wants to get up. Wants to fight and rage and slam Harry back against a wall and fuck him until all thoughts of Ginevra are obliterated from Harry’s mind. Draco wants to do quite a lot of things, he realises, lying upon the bed, watching tears spring to Harry’s eyes, but he doesn’t have the willpower or the energy to go through with any of them.
So he lets her talk and the first time he asks her for a Muggle book recommendation, her eyes light up and he ends up with a list longer than his Potions homework assignment.
his brain chimes in unhelpfully, and he pulls her into another embrace hoping fervently she understands. When she grips his shoulders tightly, he knows she does.
‘Harry!’ comes the voice from the next room a couple of days later and Harry jumps out of bed at the shrill note he hears in Draco’s tone, fearing the worst.
He’s in his parent’s old bedroom, aiming spells at the ivy that has grown over the windows when there’s a tapping on it. It’s another owl, one so small that it is probably an owlet. He lets it in and it flies around the room, moving around extremely fast before it settles on his shoulder and nips his ear playfully. Confused, he unties the letter attached to its leg and discovers another letter from Granger.
“Here’s what I didn’t tell you,” Harry says, pulling away. “Before any of those other things, I’m going to rim you till you cry.”
The two armchairs on opposite sides of the bed are ever so slightly misplaced– sitting diagonally across from each other, as though the two people who sit in them can’t bear to look the other in the eye. Scorpius has seen the way Aunt Hermione’s eyes linger on the placement when she comes to visit.
She fills the workspace with inane chatter in a low voice while they chop and grind and stir. She talks about the things that happen in the Gryffindor common room, things that are apparently happening in Auror training that Weasley writes to her about, the last interesting book she found in the library.
“I lost my box of bangles,” she tells Harry when he comes close enough. “My grandmother sent it to me from Gujarat. Ma’s going to kill me.”
Draco takes two deep gulps of whisky and tries to take a third, only to discover he’s drained the glass. He sets it down on the table and steeples his fingers. She meets his eyes.
He had expected Granger to be there with Potter hiding away somewhere pretending Draco wasn’t sullying the house he lived in and Weasley would be wherever he had been the last time.
“You didn’t deserve it,” she says. Her voice doesn’t waver, but it’s different from the one he’s accustomed to hearing from her when they brush hostile shoulders in the corridors. The sound of wind chimes and forest fires has been replaced by an intensity—dark and bloodthirsty and angry.
Harry’s jaw clenches. He looks away and runs his fingers through his hair. “Not anymore,” he says. “She isn’t my girlfriend anymore.”
He looks at her, imagines her fiery hair against the brown, scarred skin of Harry’s chest, and something twinges deep behind the walls he’s built to keep himself safe from Potter and the baggage he brings.
“Why here?” Potter asks. It doesn’t seem redundant the way Theo’s questions often were if Draco went off on a tangent about his slight history obsession. The words, guileless and curious, are filled with Potter’s brand of earnest genuineness that sets Draco’s teeth on edge and his soul at rest.
They barely talk when it isn’t about Potions or Transfiguration or Defence. But sometimes Potter brings up Hermione and sometimes Draco asks after Weasley and Ginevra and it’s not a friendship but it’s… something. And that something makes him want Potter more than he did.
Harry flushes. Hermione giggles and pats him on the head before murmuring, “One day, Harry, I have hope you’ll grow up.”
Malfoy taps his chin. “Something like familial consent should be necessary instead of the way Hogwarts just drags everyone into it. If a half blood child needs exposure to either world, their parents can sign them up for it. If this works, we just approach everyone.”
“I know that now,” Malfoy snaps. “But when I was six and my father was looking at a clothesline where there should have been a plaque, it seemed… real.”
“If I wanted to divorce you, Harry, I would have done it a long time ago, not waited for our son’s death.”
He grips the sides of Harry’s face and turns the trembling chin up and says fiercely, “It’s done, alright? It’s the past. It’s irrelevant now, just a scar in my collection of them.”
On Christmas Eve, when the streets are bedecked with Christmas ornaments and lights, the tree in the Square an attraction to which the children of the neighbourhood flock to, Harry presses his nose against the cold glass, holding Draco’s hand.
He knows– because yes, he does have peripheral vision, one does not simply go through a war without learning when there are eyes watching, tracking, observing– that Potter has been watching him since they saw each other during the Sorting for the first time since Draco’s trials in July. Draco has felt those eyes, vibrant and vivid on his back, on his sides, upon his bent head all through the evening like pointed laser beams burning holes through the thick robes that have all of a sudden begun to feel too warm.
I love you, Draco wants to say. Except, if he admits to that in the throes of an orgasm and later pretends as though he didn’t fucking say it, he will have set the scene for his heart to slowly be ripped to shreds with a rusted kitchen knife.
That is a minefield of a discovery in itself, realising in a bustling Florentine street that he came here to… ask Malfoy the questions he needs to be asked to become who he should be. He still doesn’t know the why or the how, but he has some answers and it is more than Harry has had in a while.
Draco reaches out to grip the collar of Harry’s shirt before letting himself fall and they end up on the bed together, Harry landing on Draco with a surprised huff.
Harry’s lips are soft, slightly bitten and slightly swollen but so beautifully perfect that Draco knows he can stay caught in this moment forever. If lightning was to strike him down right at this second, he would die the happiest man on earth. He nips slightly at Harry’s full lower lip and drinks in his startled gasp. He tastes like pancakes and it is everything Draco has been dreaming of.
“I know what I said, Draco,” she says with the patience of someone who is used to dealing with eighteen year olds behaving like they’re five.
“Don’t you miss the Weaslett—Ginevra?” Malfoy asks. They’re at a pizza parlour, a dimly lit room with a sign outside which claims in broken English that they have the best pizza in San Gimignano.
Outside the sun is up, and Draco, a little discomfited in his Muggle attire, holds his hand up to shield his eyes from the glaring light that seems to scorch the pavements and rational thought from Draco’s brain.
And ignoring Draco’s surprised cry, he ducks down, pushes Draco’s legs up from the thighs until they’re in the air and licks a hot, wet stripe down his arse crack.
He has a barely healed claw mark on his shoulder where Greyback had angrily swiped at him once. It doesn’t hurt but Draco doesn’t like looking at it or touching it. When his fingers accidentally brush against it, he has conditioned himself to jerk them away. It reminds him of too many nights spent in fear, trembling alone in a room in the darkness, afraid to sleep because he might wake up to the rank smell of rotting flesh standing atop him. There’s a scar on the back of his calf from where Bella had electrocuted him in a fit of rage at her husband. Only Draco had been available to bear the brunt of her wand.
‘Yes, yes of course. If you need to put them to sleep, there’s a room down the hall. This… this is Harry’s room.”
“You don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for,” Draco says and Harry blushes a little. It isn’t meant to sound like a reference to the fact that Harry has been holding off a little adamantly on penetrative sex, waiting for something he doesn’t quite know the details of yet. Draco says the same thing when he loses his mind over it, apologising to Draco profusely for making him wait, asking him if he’s okay with it over and over,
“It’ll be her first Christmas alone,” he breathes out and Harry’s hand sifts through his hair. It’s comfort and it’s a touch of regret and Draco leans into it and lets himself feel a little terrible. It’s an indulgence he allows himself only today.
“Stop,” Harry says. “Stop… Just, hold me accountable. Tell me I fucked up. Let me make it up to you. You didn’t deserve that. You didn’t deserve any of it.”
Draco stares after him open-mouthed and furious, unsure why he picked this fight in the first place, fuming that he lost it, disappointed that he had the last word and still Potter retained the dignity.
Potter’s expression clears. “Touch it, Malfoy," he says, quietly. "You don’t have to take it back. Just reach out and touch it.”
“I was hoping it wasn’t to start a fight.” She has a smirk on her face but there’s an undercurrent of concern.
“And after that… he came back. He started cooking again, started sleeping in our room when he wasn’t feeling too great, started talking to us. He made amends with you and I thought, I thought he was… okay! But… but…” Her speech is so garbled at this point that Draco has to strain to make out what he is saying.
On Wednesday, he thought that maybe he needed more time to himself and couldn’t face Draco just yet but when he misses Friday as well, Draco knows Harry is avoiding him purposefully. Slightly hurt and not entirely sure what to do about it, he firecalls Hermione and asks if Harry is in. She says no loudly but nods her head yes to indicate that Harry can hear the question and doesn’t want her to tell Draco.
Now Draco understands what it must have been like, being so close to something so despicable, something that wanted only to kill, to destroy, to scar and cause harm.
He remembers the way Malfoy had resigned himself to thinking Harry had brought the Aurors. The way he seemed too tired to put up a fight. I’ll go willingly, he had said, looking for all the world like a battered prisoner on the run, too tired to do it anymore. It isn’t something Harry can even imagine Draco Malfoy saying under normal circumstances. The fight has gone out of him and Harry doesn’t understand why he feels so dismayed by it. Common decency, he tells himself. Common decency that dictates when you see someone look as helpless as Malfoy did today, you feel bad about it.
“I didn’t mean to do what I did,” Harry says. Draco’s finger still on his cheekbone. “I didn’t mean to say those things in Camden. Do what I did to you.”
“Draco,” Granger cuts him off. “You don’t need to explain. For what it’s worth, Harry probably knows how you take your tea as well. And you are right, he does take two sugars. I keep forgetting because he’s–” She hesitates before fixing him with a charming smile and says, “Never mind. Come along now.”
It’s criminally impressive and Harry can’t quite decide whether he hates it or loves it, so he settles on a combination of both.
The mention of Granger seems to shake Potter up a bit. He seems to remember something, probably why he’s here at all.
“You’re always loud,” Harry says. “Every time we fuck, Draco, you make it so good for me, Merlin, the
The cabin is a small wooden structure in the midst of a forest and surprisingly unostentatious given that it is Black family property.
He raises the sleeve of his robes to reveal an expanse of plain skin. It takes Harry a moment to register that it is his left arm where he should have the Dark Mark. He doesn’t. Instead, he seems to be intently focusing on it with the tip of his wand pressed to it and suddenly, the skin trembles and the black lines of the mark rise to the surface, the gruesome symbol becoming prominent.
Draco makes a vague hand gesture. Harry grows a tad exasperated, mouth pinching. “Why are you apologising?”
“That’s good to know then,” Harry says with a bashful expression that Draco wants to kiss right off his stupidly handsome face. So he does.
Perhaps it is a trick of the light and the dancing flames, but her pupils seem to dilate slightly. Draco’s smirk broadens.
“Pansy has something to say, don’t you?” Draco asks pointedly. Parkinson scowls at the floor. “Pansy.”
“I don’t need an apology, Harry,” a low musical voice tells him gently. “I arrived only an hour ago.”
She looks so excited at the prospect of Potter even talking to her that Draco’s spirits lift. He’s as sincere as he could possibly ever be when he tells her, “I’m glad to hear it, Granger.”
“If I’d have known she was coming…” Draco says and trails off when he realises there is no way he could end that statement without offending one or the other of them. “She’s not here for long, right?”
Draco nods. He understands, and he wonders when he lost the ability to stay angry with Harry. “It’s fine,” he says, and Harry flinches at the rough quality of his tone. Being choked by tendrils of wild magic will do that to a man, Draco does not add.
Draco hasn’t said anything since the rather spectacular blowjob and Harry can’t say he’s complaining. His last memory of Draco’s voice is it screaming itself hoarse, calling out his name. Not an unpleasant last memory, if he’s being honest.
of her Apparating in and prepares himself for her to tear him a new one for being a greater git than usual but it doesn’t come. He can see her legs as she moves over to the sink to wash away the burnt remains of whatever she had been cooking - they’re probably going to order in again.
“This is good, you know?” Harry says, gesturing between them without meeting Draco’s eyes. “This… us. Whatever. It’s… I didn’t expect it, but you’re—good. Yeah.”
. The paranoid, anxious part of him laughs bitterly, already believing he’s been tricked. “And I am here to confirm the allegations that many have that he is what he has been charged to be—a willing Death Eater, the brand of it present for the world to see on his left arm. I have to add to it that he is a bully, a bigot and a privileged child, none of which I have been spared the negative aftereffects of.”
When it comes to India, it’s just as complicated as sex. In fact, the situation is ridiculously similar. He’s waiting for something, some sign or symbol or signal that he should plunge headfirst into something he had not even contemplated for the first seventeen years of his life. The Gryffindor in him is roaring with frustration and the cautious boy is reigning the lion in with wary questions and an unwillingness to take a step forward into the unknown without adequately safeguarding his heart.
“You think I don’t understand depression, Potter?” Draco questions, lightly slapping the desk. Madame Pince shoots him a disapproving look which he ignores. “The War? What it can do to you? Trauma? You think I don’t understand? That Granger doesn’t, Weasley doesn’t, Ginevra doesn’t? Longbottom? Finnegan? Thomas? Patil? Fucking Pansy? Even…” he trails off.
“It is not my job to keep up with the tabloids, Draco,” she says. A.twist of the fingers. “It is my job to help you
He shies away from her piercing, perceptive gaze and grimaces. Malfoy. As usual, making him more uncomfortable than he already is at the worst of times. “That miserable twat doesn’t deserve it.”
“Granger,” he manages, though somehow he makes it sound like the alien utterance of a cat being strangled slowly to death, the syllables unfamiliar on his tongue.
And in that courtroom with stern witches and wizards staring down at them while the Chief Warlock declares their petition passed, Harry only has eyes for Draco who looks radiant in his navy robes. He’s smiling at Hermione while Ron slaps him on the back but he’s looking at Harry with that smile that makes Harry weak at the knees.
“You lived in the Gryffindor dorms for years,” he’d reminded her, “Figured you’d be used to a little discomfort.”
“Oh come on,” Hermione says. “What are you, busy? Have other plans? With the ghosts in your Manor perhaps? Maybe the doxies in the attic?”
“Why not? That was a pretty awful panic attack and if your attitude right now is anything to go by, it happens often. Probably on a larger scale. You’ve got to go see someone! They’ll keep getting worse and–”
Blaise shrugs an elegant shoulder. “The fact that all your friends are settling down and you’re watching them and panicking? Of me being able to do everything you were supposed to do? Of her because she married me? Take your pick, Draco, you’ll be right.”
When the Floo in his office turns green,he steps into the flames that will take him home, thinking only of Draco.
They lapse into steady silence after that. The effects of the Draught are already wearing off, the slight fog lifting gradually. He looks at Potter out of the corner of his eye, half expecting him to become wispy and fade away but he remains right there, in Draco’s view. Not a hallucination, Draco thinks. Then with horror he thinks again, not a hallucination. Potter is in his kitchen. And Draco has been pouring out his heart to him. He clutches at his wrist with as much force as possible, his knuckles stark against his skin, trying to calm himself down.
“The taste,” Healer Brocklehurst had said hesitantly, when Scorpius had complained, “has been described by many in the same position as the taste of Death.” Harry had grown pale hearing the words, his tongue darting out to smooth over his chapped bottom lip. Scorpius remembers Draco’s fingers twitching against his arm. As a fifteen year old who had once been an open mouthed child exploring the hallways of a dusty Manor house filled to the brim with insect life not merely limited to small spiders, Scorpius chooses to characterise the unpleasant taste in a less melodramatic fashion.
When Draco hears the knock on his door, he buries his face in his pillow. He’s not in the mood to deal with more of Potter’s rage.
He’s pale where Harry’s dark, his skin almost translucent. There’s a vein pulsing in the curve of his wrist and his fingers are so long that they completely encircle Harry. There are many inappropriate thoughts to be had about the circumstance but Harry pushes them away. Instead he stares down at where Draco is tightening his hold, almost cutting off Harry’s circulation.
“At this stage it’s more brainstorming than it is setting anything in stone. My vote is to write down anything that comes to anyone’s mind, regardless of whether it is an outline for the steps we will take or details of the proposal. Just, everything anyone comes up with, put it down somewhere. We can figure out where to go with it once we actually have some material.”
“Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater only in name. He was unable to bring himself to torture Muggles or kill Muggle-borns or half-bloods or cast
“Because you’re a stupid git who’s had too much money his whole life and not enough people telling him no. But you can still learn. And because whatever you saw with Voldemort, in your house, with your Father, has made you a better man than you were a boy.” He looks around, at the curtains, at the open door, at the bed, and then looks back to Draco, a little smirk pulling on the corner of his lips. “And the Italian villa sounded positively splendid when you spoke about it so mournfully into your whisky and I wanted to see it.”
“Will you sleep with me?” Draco asks at long last, when he peruses his mind of appropriate conversation starters and comes up empty.
Potter screams, and sometimes Draco wants to scream with him, and sometimes he wants to slap his hand over Potter’s mouth and leave him silenced forever.
“And how’s Harry?” She asks Ginevra, and Draco’s grateful their attention is directed towards each other, thankfully missing his flinch.
She nods. “Harry is sleeping well. I can’t quite catch a wink so I thought I’d pay you a visit. I had a feeling you would be awake.”
“That was rude, Potter. If you find it ridiculous, you should just say so– umph!” He shuts up abruptly when Harry almost pounces on him, kissing him breathless. When he pulls away, Harry says softly, “It’s not ridiculous. If I’m being honest, it’s hot. So,” he kisses Draco again, “wonderfully,” again, “hot.”
Ron had been standing at the foot of the bed, wand limp in his hand, murmuring, “Harry’s going to wake up, it’s a trick, he’s going to wake up, kill You-Know-Who, he will wake up, he’s not actually dead, not actually dead.”
“Tell me why I should be grateful,” Draco says. The alternate implications of his words hang in the air,
“Anything else, Potter?” He asks, proud that his voice isn’t breaking. Potter looks at him and appears totally lost for a moment before he comprehends what Draco is saying. He shakes his head.
‘Merlin, Potter, that’s a bit much, don’t you think?’ Draco asks, the dry amusement in his voice warming Harry’s heart. ‘I have a better plan.’
Eventually he’d given in, the image of his mother’s perfect chignon torn askew by stray hexes, the bruise on her throat purple and painful flashing behind his eyes. If for nothing else, for her sake he needs to try to come out of this dark hole he and his father have dug themselves into. For her sake he needs to try to ensure this hole is not his grave.
the jaws of a few onlookers drop. The public surprise isn’t unexpected, nor is the fact that every witch or wizard in the vicinity is watching the proceedings with covert interest (a few daring enough to not be quite as covert). Granger is, after all, a war hero- a respectable, reputable witch, lined up to receive an Order of Merlin, First Class, alongside Weasley and Potter. Privately, Draco thinks Granger should be the
They pull away after what feels like hours and seconds all at once and Draco stares at Harry, at the green of those eyes, blown a little dark by his dilated pupils, at the kiss swollen curve of his lower lip. His spectacles are a little skewed on his nose and Draco absently fixes the angle of them and only realises what he’s done when Harry’s eyes flutter a little and his expression flickers to one of pleased surprise.
Draco snorts, Hermione groans and Slughorn enters right at that moment, bustling around in his robes that are better suited as a nightgown.
As a child, Draco had wrapped himself up in those curtains, pretending they were draperies. Sitting on the floor, the soft fabric of legends told in art caressing him, Italian sunlight bathing his surroundings in golden light, Draco had thought he’d found heaven. He’d woven countless stories, adventures and tales about the people he saw in them, knights and statues and long-haired women and creatures that looked like woodland nymphs. He’d been the hero in all of them, and now, in the idyllic room left to him by fanciful ancestors, Draco knows why it had been so easy.
There will be a vote passed tomorrow for which the presence of all involved parties is required and Draco groans at the realisation that he needs to be there, being criticised and judged by some of the most powerful witches and wizards.
He can feel Granger’s eyes on the side of his neck. “Sometimes I think talking to you would be good for him. But he’s too stubborn and you’re too… volatile.”
But Malfoy does exactly that, leaving Harry open-mouthed and dumbfounded on the armchair before the fireplace, wondering in what world Malfoy does not pick fights with him even when he throws the avenue wide open, reeling with the shame of the unnecessary taunt and the guilt of dredging up that expression on Malfoy’s relaxed face.
He wonders if exile is always like this for everyone before Potter’s exasperated lectures about privilege kick in and he realises that he’s a rich boy in a white world and he’s allowed to luxuriate in exile while many people in his position with less of Daddy’s money saved up in vaults and expensive villas would probably be forced to become anonymous starving artists in dusty, forgotten attics.
She laughs, loud and clear. Draco has heard that laughter from across the hall, around Potter and the Weasel, in class when they're sharing some joke. He has never had cause to hear it up close.
Hermione keeps staring so Harry says quietly, “He looked like he hadn’t eaten anything in a month. And he’s been taking Calming Draughts too often, he finishes a third of a bottle per day, ‘Mione, per day.”
There’s a trembling to Harry’s fingers that no Auror worth his salt should have. It’s an erratic, arrhythmic jerk that patters Harry’s fingers almost involuntarily against the firm leather. There’s a glint in his eyes that sends a phantom chill racing down Scorpius’ spine.
It’s a brown ensemble that he’s pairing with a pale green shirt and a dark green tie. He isn’t wearing it but the very thought of Harry in those clothes makes Draco a little dizzy.
“How are you even here?” Malfoy asks, brows furrowing as though Harry is a complicated puzzle he can’t quite figure out.
Scorpius startles. He hadn’t even thought to do that since he got his bearings. He was caught up in… other things. Like having a corporeal form despite being dead, whatever that means. Like greeting Death the way his father had once told him to when he’d been drunk and vulnerable by his bedside.
Draco turns on Granger immediately, ignoring Potter’s half hearted apology attempts. “He’s part of it?”
“Oh. Oh yes, of course,” Hermione says immediately. “Do you want anything else at all? Something to drink or eat or something? Anything?”
“Let’s go,” he says, tugging on Draco’s arm. “Get dressed, we’ll go out to eat.” He remembers and hastily adds, “Only if you want to, of course. If you’re not feeling up to it—”
They look at each other for a few more seconds before Weasley clears his throat, gesturing to the doors of the Hall. “Shall we?”
“Uh,” Draco begins, feeling slightly incredulous, “Invading his personal space without permission? Kissing him without permission? Continuing it without checking to see if he’s alright? Having no regard whatsoever for consent?”
“Harry, say something!” Hermione urges, looking at him, frustrated energy shining through in her eyes.
Draco nods in response as though he hadn’t told her during Arithmancy that he understood that desire to do absolutely nothing, feel the pointlessness of existence creep right into his bones.
He thinks of his mother. Thinks of her in her French villa, creating tapestries and tending to the rose garden. When she had told him she was leaving, her hand clutching at the delicate pearls set against her delicate throat, he hadn’t even put up token resistance. He loved her but she needed more than an empty house with too many memories. Draco knows she wants him to live with her, wants him to move to France and do his Potions mastery there. A fresh start.
He’s hungry, actually ravenous from having exerted himself and his magic to the fullest yesterday. It is not ideal but hunger is something Harry hasn’t felt in so long that the accompanying sense of misplaced elation gives him a rush that makes him bound down the stairs into the living room when he remembers– he had totally trashed this place yesterday. But the he looks around, everything seems to be alright, just a few pictures out of place here and there.
She takes a moment but eventually nods. “It’s just,” she points vaguely at the two of them in the bed, “you look so happy and you’ve sorted it all out and Harry, I, all I even want to see anymore–” she takes a deep breath, “All I even want for you anymore is hope this lasts while you sort out the other things.”
“Would you like to talk about it?” Her eyes briefly flicker to the whisky glass, and the calm mask turns disdainful for a moment before settling. “About your son?”
There’s a buzzing in his head as he meets Harry’s hesitant eyes again. “What?” He asks. It comes out in a whisper.
“Then I understand,” she says, and he looks up at her through blurry eyes to see the shaky smile still in place.
It was a Saturday. Saturday meant Malfoy was supposed to come over for dinner. And he had. And he had taken Harry down.
“Just tell me something?” Draco pleads, unsure what he’s even asking for. But whatever Harry sees in his face is enough.
But Harry opens up a whole new arena of problems because when Draco has a hand wrapped around his dick in bed, thinking of Potter with his green eyes and smooth, dark skin, of his lips stretched around his dick, of his fingers in his arse, it is one thing. Meaningless, just something to get him off.
Potter shoots the receptionist a media-perfect smile, grabs Draco’s arm and leads them into the lift which Draco comes to realise moves quite differently from the one in the Ministry. For one it’s smoother, for another it only moves vertically and for another, there are mirrors inside which Draco appreciates both because he enjoys looking at himself and because seeing two of Potter doesn’t seem quite as bad a circumstance now as it would have once when he was in third year and Potter was charmingly tossing snowballs into his face from under his infernal Invisibility Cloak.
“I can’t sleep in a bed that isn’t this one,” Harry had admitted to Draco many long nights ago. “I miss you too much.”
Draco isn’t sure if it’s anger with him or with the world, but from the way his jaw is clenched and his knuckles are white against the edge of his seat, Draco figures it might be a combination of both.
What he doesn’t understand is that when he looks at the Gryffindor table, Granger is talking to Ginevra, Finnegan and Thomas are throwing purple sparks at Longbottom who’s laughing and dodging, and Lovegood appears to be… weaving.
Potter still wears glasses—Draco wouldn’t know what to do if he stopped wearing glasses—and the eyes behind them are just as intense as they’ve ever been throughout the years in Hogwarts. But every time Draco catches Potter off guard as he looks off to the side, or forgets that he’s in company, something simmers beneath that carefully curated persona. Draco has to hold himself back from shaking him by the shoulders until whatever is out of place snicks back into the familiar order of Potter.
Protest drying on his lips, Harry swallows and shakily nods again. His memory is blurry at best but even of what he remembers, he knows not much of it is great.
“Oh!” Hermione’s hands fly up to her mouth and when she brings them away, there’s a wide, bright smile there. “Oh! Finally!” Then the situation catches up to her, Draco running away, Harry on the floor and her eyes widen. “Didn’t you want him to?!”
“I just…” Granger had turned, and the wistful air about her had sent a pang of guilt through Draco. “I just missed stationery shops a lot, when I was young. Hogwarts didn’t… accept work written in pen, Flitwick sent back more than one essay… but now–“
This kiss isn’t rough, but it’s a little biting, filled with the promise of more. Pressed against the closed door to his own room, Harry wonders what fourteen-year-old Harry would think, knowing he would one day kiss and be kissed by Draco Malfoy and enjoy it. Nothing good, but it’s an interesting idea.
“So the villa has been yours since the 1800s?” Potter asks. Potter’s naïveté regarding historical facts is surprisingly charming. He doesn’t know much—Draco can’t fault him, as when one’s only exposure to the subject is Binns, the expectations run so low they might as well be underground—but he’s ceaselessly curious. Draco doesn’t know if that’s Granger’s influence or his innate nature—either way, it’s endearing.
He does, and closes his eyes in tightening shame when he notices Gianni has splashed in a couple drops of Calming Draught.
“What should we talk about then?” Draco asks with a small smile of his own as Harry moves closer. There’s a breath of space between them and Harry’s hips are pressing against his own.
The sunlight finds Potter, as light almost always seems to, and weaves itself in a delightful frolic through his messy hair, twisting into his appearance like a halo. The light bounces off his spectacles, obscuring the green of his eyes. The line of his shoulders appears starker here, set against the background of Draco’s open door and the sliver of the wooden walls of the corridor visible outside.
Draco holds his hand here more, clings to his side, pulls him this way and that, reads every word on the plaques of every building, catalogues them away in that wondrous brain of his. Not for the first time, Harry thinks how well Hermione and Draco would get along if they got to know each other. He mentions it to Draco and Draco’s ears turn a little pink and he mumbles something abstract and uncatchable about how he hopes to do better by her later and Harry understands what he means when Hermione’s next letter comes.
“You could love again,” she’d said, her thin hand coming up to brush a lock of hair out of his eyes. “This doesn’t have to be the end.”
“That’s the benefit of the current political climate!” Malfoy says, sounding more excited. “If they sign up for it, the family looks better. Tells the world they aren’t Voldemort supporters, they have nothing against Muggles!”
He chooses to focus on Granger’s hair, trying to count the curls on it, to have something to do that grounds him. Numbers always ground him.
Harry is looking up at him, green, beautiful eyes full of worry asking him Are you alright? Did I do something wrong?
Now, his lips quirk just a little, crinkles appearing around the corners of his mouth. Draco’s heart aches something fierce.
Granger takes him out to Muggle things, Potter comes over and feeds him lunch that Weasley cooks for him. Draco doesn’t know what to think of any of those occurrences but he does know that the outings with Granger are a welcome reprieve from the Wizarding World and its oppressive expectations, that Potter’s company is tolerable (he refuses to think of it as nice, even if it is, even if it makes Draco feel less lonely in the confines of his own head) and that Weasley’s cooking is somehow phenomenal and if he drops everything he is doing and opens a bakery, he will have a thriving business.
He hesitates before he removes the Glamour that covers the scars too– the Dark Mark, the Sectumsempra, the slashes on his back from one of Fenrir’s enraged moments. He looks himself in the mirror, runs his hands through his hair one more time and steps through the Floo into Grimmauld.
When they land, he doesn’t know how to feel. Impressed by her nerve, bewildered by her willingness to disappear with him pretty much in public, indignant because she did bring him somewhere completely unknown or terrified for his- frankly worthless- life. He settles on a stony glare, hoping it conveys all of those emotions, crosses his arms and waits.
He peers at Granger through his lashes, expected a reprimand or a glare but instead, she barely looks up from her list of ingredients that she’s printing on a fresh sheet of parchment. For a moment Draco thinks she hasn’t heard.
At Malfoy’s blank look, he raises his eyebrows and says, “Neither of you leave the house. Harry looks so dreadful these days I’ve forgotten how he used to look before and under that Glamour you’ve got, I’m sure you look like those Muggle whiteboard thingies Dad brought in from the office.”
“Parvati,” Harry says, kneeling down to her eye level. Her hands are tangled in Lavender’s collar, obscured by the unnatural slant of Lavender’s back. Parvati stares at him, face blank. “We need to take Lavender to the Hall, now.”
“You know,” he says conversationally, voluntarily speaking for the first time this evening, “my son was the one to first suggest I do this.” He gestures between them, and the woman’s eyebrows shoot so far into her hairline, they run the risk of disappearing.
“I kissed him back,” Harry says and a ghost of a smile flits across his lips. “Oh, I kissed him back.”
Potter sighs, an exasperated exhalation of air. “What do I do to tell you I’m not a figment of your imagination, Malfoy?”
From the iteration of the event in the papers and his relentless interrogation of Hermione and Blaise on his bad days, he knows the facts of the case just fine, but he wishes he could remember how Harry and Draco had acted around each other in those months of silence during the trial.
“You said… Master?” Scorpius questions, swallowing around the syllables of the last word. He’s never been particularly comfortable with that title. Ever since Skeeter did her investigative piece on Harry Potter being the Master of Death, it’s been a regular headline for his dad in the papers.
“I don’t know what to do,” Draco blurts before his pride or his insecurities can kick in. Once the words are out, they hang heavy in the fraught air between them, a quiet admission of weakness that’s both unexpected and unknown. Draco has been weak in front of Potter before. Sixth year is a battleground of tense memories—Potter seeing him cry, Potter watching horrified as Draco spurted blood from the sliced gash across his abdomen, lying helpless and weak on the floor, Potter watching him lower his shaking wand on the tower. But these intrusions have never been of Draco’s own volition.
Instead of saying anything at all, Harry pulls his partner against his chest. The angle is awkward because it isn’t exactly a hug and Draco is taller than Harry is, but then Draco shifts slightly to rest his forehead on Harry’s shoulder. They stay like that for a while, revelling in a rare moment of proximity and intimacy.
“Maybe I do understand his circumstances better,” Death says. Scorpius might be imagining it, but the ever-changing eyes seem to have gone a bit wide. “Or rather, what he meant by an open, honest relationship with his son who suggested inappropriate relations.”
He blinks. Her face is twisted with anger, her hands are clenched in barely repressed violence. But she seems to be—
The wand used to kill the Dark Lord. The wand that brought the final end. Draco’s fucking wand. Potter holds it out but Draco can’t bring his hands up to grasp it. He knows they’re clammy where he’s kept them clenched against his thighs.
Draco looks him in the eye, takes a deep breath and says, “I have anxiety.” Harry gapes at him, the surprise of the unexpected words knocking the wind out of him even though he’s lying down. The candour with which Draco admits to it after so many weeks of avoiding calling his panic attacks panic attacks, avoiding admitting he needs to see someone, avoiding every hard thing that can be avoided when it comes to himself, is startling. He’s about to open his mouth and respond to that but Draco soldiers on, giving him no time to pause and formulate a reply. “I have anxiety, I get frequent panic attacks, I get triggered by small, inconsequential things and I need help. I need help. It is bad, it can get to the point where I black out, it can get to the point where I might start screaming nonsense, it already has gotten to the point where I am Calming Draught dependent. It isn’t an addiction but without it, I have no control over the anxiety. At all. And if we go anywhere with this, you need to be prepared for all that.” He takes a deep breath, exhales slowly and avoids Harry’s eyes pointedly.
‘This,’ says Draco, letting one end of the coil drop from his hand so the whole thing unravels across the floor, ‘is a lot of fucking rope.’
“Okay,” Draco says, leaning over to press a softly sweet kiss to his cheek. It’s vulnerability leaches through Harry’s fogged over and lust hazy brain and he smiles, a little drunk and more than a little ecstatic.
and when Scorpius would wake up, he would giggle at the way Draco kept muttering and wiping away the licks of flour on Harry’s abs or the traces of oil on his sternum.
“Draco this isn’t about what you mean to me. You know what you mean to me. You always have. Either spill or I go to Pansy.”
“It’s alright, Potter,” he manages. “And if you’re actually interested in giving the damn wand back, we can meet near the Lake after dinner.”
The door opens and a dishevelled, rumpled Harry steps out with a disgruntled expression, “I told you, ‘Mione I’m not going to go, he doesn’t want to see– oh! Draco!”
He says as much. “You didn’t,” he concludes when Draco doesn’t say anything. “You told me what you needed and I gave it to you.”
He would have known for sure if he had the energy to turn his head to his right and strain his eyes against the darkness of the room, but his body feels boneless. His muscles are aching, a low, dull throb that Scorpius has grown somewhat accustomed to. But in this moment, he is conscious of all his weaknesses, of every line of frailty in his form. Finding out who is sitting in his room doesn’t seem worth the effort it will take to move.
The woman raises her eyebrows pointedly. Draco smirks. “It is rather hot,” he says, gesturing to the fire.
Determination seizes him. It isn’t fair. Harry has been shutting Draco out for a week without justifying it and Draco wants his friend back. He has been raised as the Malfoy scion, the only child of a wealthy, pureblood family. So when he wants something, he hasn’t been taught to be refused.
“We try to keep ourselves busy, Malfoy. All of us. But at the end of the day, everything that has been our reality for the last few years is gone. I try to not have time but when I really think about it, I’m drifting. And I’m not willing to sit down and accept it. So will you put aside the last seven years of schooling and hatred for now and just work with me?”
He pulls Draco down again, into a messy, filthy kiss that has Draco moaning at the taste of himself in Harry’s mouth. His hands come up to the sweaty dark hair and soon enough he’s tugging at the strands which makes Harry arch his back slightly, causing his dick to shift inside Draco. They both cry out at the feeling into each other’s mouths, swallowing the sounds hungrily.
“I,” he begins hesitantly, “I owe you an apology, Malfoy.” When Draco says nothing in response, he seems to stumble over his words, “That day, I was just so angry, I didn’t expect you to be there, I just thought that, that you shouldn’t be. I’ve been so angry these past few days, I said some things…” He pauses here and then finishes, “that I had no right to say.”
He takes a minute to remember the first few blurry weeks after the War. Going to see a Mind Healer for at least a week was Ministry mandated. He remembers the pale lilac robes of the Healer he had gone to, the soft voice and probing questions. The tumultuous rage at being asked to talk about things he only wanted to forget.
When Harry sat up, groggy and disoriented, Ron had entreated him to go and kill ‘that noseless bastard once and for all’ and no matter what Harry said, Ron continued to pleadingly beg him to kill Voldemort as though he had no consciousness of where he was. When he went to fetch Hermione after sitting Ron down and telling him he was going to go and get him a glass of water, he found her hyperventilating in the kitchen.
“Oh, thank Merlin!” She says before turning back to Weasley and pulling him to her chest. He is completely unresponsive but Draco thinks it is more for her own benefit than Weasley’s.
Potter gets up off the floor and stands there beside him for a beat. When Draco doesn’t say anything more, he turns and walks away without another word.
If Draco is a sinner, Potter is salvation. If Draco is a wound, gaping and raw, Potter is a balm. Draco’s soul has been corrupted, he knows it, remembers it weighing heavy in his nightmares and his memories, in his instincts and his inhibitions. Perhaps it is the simple physics of magnetism that draws him—the blackened, corrupted corpse of him—like a moth to the flame of Potter’s purity.
There is an altar, and Draco, who has never seen the point of religion, finally understands the merit of worship.
But now, none of that comes up. When finally Draco puts his quill down saying he can’t possibly write a word more that makes even a modicum of sense, Granger puts her own quill down and yawns.
At the time, Draco hadn’t known why Granger’s disappointment twisted something inside his core, but he’d called out, quietly to her, stopping her in her tracks.
“Harry Potter isn’t keeping me busy—” Draco sputters and Harry wants to correct him, wants to point out that the week they spent, doing nothing but necking in their beds and occasionally emerging to eat, is keeping busy but Draco didn’t even tell Parkinson he was here. Of all the things Draco wants Parkinson to know, this one cannot be on the list.
Potter looks a little rueful. “You’re not even wrong,” he says, taking another sip of beer. “‘But I’m not interested in anything of the sort.”
I could call the Aurors right now and have them drag you out of here by the scruff of your neck, shredding those fancy robes for trespassing in my house and you’ll be taken straight to Daddy Malfoy.” Malfoy’s eyes have widened comically. “Should have let you rot in Azkaban,” he says. “Or better, in the damn Fiendfyre.”
He turns uncomfortably at Weasley and Potter, both of whom are staring at him wordlessly and shakes his head. Awkwardly and without looking him in his fire-bright eyes, he tells Potter, “Thank you for letting me into your home.”
“When did you even– How did you have the time?” Draco blurts out and immediately looks mortified. “Shit, I’m an idiot, oh Merlin, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean–”
He’d withdrawn the Hallow dispassionately from the tangled, skeletal remains of the Headmaster, sealed the tomb back up and had stared at the Elder Wand with a sort of fascinated horror. He’d tucked it into his pocket after a while, sat there a little longer for appearance’s sake and had then left, bidding the headmistress goodbye.
“Harry’s having a crisis,” Ginny says with a shrug. “I’m just wondering if he needs something to help him through it.”
“So,” Scorpius says slowly, not allowing the hysteria to set in, “even if you wanted, you couldn’t transform into me right now? No matter what you do?”
was sixteen. But Scorpius was my son, the boy I wanted to protect from the person I had become when I was sixteen. He was a Ravenclaw, and multiple times Flitwick told me he would be some sort of miracle inventor because he devised a charm at twelve that poured his Potions ingredients into the cauldron for him.
“I said I would plead guilty,” Draco croaks at him. The man’s been badgering him about pleading guilty and making his job easier for days. Initially, Draco hadn’t refused, but he hadn’t agreed either, aware that things in the wizarding world aren’t as certain as the Muggle one. There’s no definitive assurance that if he pleads guilty he will get a shorter sentence or a gentler one.
The door creaks open the moment he pushes and when he looks around, nausea hits him hard in the gut. These rooms are intimately familiar though he has never been here. These rooms are there in his memories, he knows where he is. He has seen this place in his nightmares.
He’s looking up at Draco, frightened, as though he expects a slap to the face. Which is why he lets out a gasp when Draco only pulls him closer and kisses his forehead gently.
“I fear something terrible might happen if he goes untreated for much longer. It has reached a point where if he comes in now, he will be put on medication for depression, anxiety and anger issues. If he comes in later or doesn’t at all… there’s a chance it will spiral further out of control than it already has.”
“Because you keep staring at his arse and I think you’ll find that it looks great in that Muggle suit he bought a couple of days ago.”
She frowns. There’s a smear of chocolate sauce or what appears to be chocolate sauce on her cheek. She swipes at it absently. “They aren’t staring at you because they would like to eat you alive or whatever it is. Maybe Ron is. No, I’m sure Ron is, just to mess with you a bit. But Harry, Harry is probably staring because he can sense the Glamour charm.”
Granger heaves a deep sigh. “Boys. If I can’t get you to behave when you’re in a room together, this project isn’t going anywhere.”
They head down and over Cleaning Charms and Sewing Spells and Air-Clearing Charms, they begin to talk. They talk about things Draco hasn’t been allowed to speak about this freely ever, about his childhood, vacations in France, his mother, his love of the Slytherin Common Room, his secret love for Charms which seems to delight Lovegood to no end. She talks about her father and how they started the Quibbler and some very strange animals Draco has never heard of.
It isn’t long before Draco is tipped over the razor sharp knife edge he has been traversing, screaming Harry’s name and the desire for more, voice going hoarse with every shout.
He thinks back to the Kitchen Debacle (though he doesn’t know if he should still call it that after what he saw in Malfoy’s kitchen today, if anything, a greater debacle by any measuring standards). The memory is unclear, all he recalls is a haze of uncertain emotions roiling within him and Malfoy’s pale, terrified face when he had jabbed the wand right in it. But he tries his hardest to look beyond all of that to remember if Malfoy had looked quite so awful then. No, he thinks. Malfoy had definitely been thinner but the spent creature Harry had just met was not what he had seen in his kitchen. A twinge of guilt shoots down his spine and pools in his gut. Did his outburst do that to Malfoy? Did his outburst push Malfoy into drinking one third of a bottle of Calming Draught per day? No, he tells himself. That sort of deterioration isn’t possible in three days. So how had Malfoy looked the way he had when he was at Grimmauld?
Harry shakes his head to clear it. There’s a fog over his thoughts, a veil that isn’t letting him process everything that just happened. The fact that Draco gave him the kiss of his life and then ran away from him, apologising, swearing and saying it had been a mistake. Harry knows he should feel something but all he can feel is the reminder of Draco’s warm, chapped lips moving against his and the pressure of his spine against Harry’s fingertips. His emotions are all hidden behind that veil and for some reason, it won’t budge.
“You go on, Mione. I’ll eat something tomorrow morning.” He notes the way the hope melts away from Granger’s face to be replaced by something so resigned that it causes his heart to clench. “You coming, Draco?” She asks, hoisting her satchel onto her shoulder.
“I leave tomorrow too,” Harry says before he realises that he’s talking. “Hence all the…” He gestures towards the jumbled mess of broken things between them. “Don’t worry about the expenses, I was being rather careless. You could have been anyone.”
“Fucking on the side?” She asks, drily, and he doesn’t have enough self control to hide the wince. “I have some idea.”
They coexist in silence for a few beats, Draco on his back, staring down at his hand splayed against the red sheets, Harry on the edge of the bed, as far away from Draco as he can get without physically leaving. It feels stifling despite the distance.
“You didn’t ask me! You didn’t bother to tell me when I wake up and come in to the kitchen, I’m going to be greeted by a Death Eater at my place at the table! What on earth is Ron going to think?” Out of the corner of his eye he notices Malfoy has shrunk in on himself. There's a vicious satisfaction he feels in that, knowing that Malfoy is cowering in fear.
The thought makes him sit bolt upright in bed. That’s it, isn’t it? His foot taps to the rhythm of his erratic heartbeat and his brain whirls through Draco’s reactions and behaviours the entirety of the past week. The unhappy slant of his lips, the fervent desire obvious in his eyes to be as far away from Harry as possible, the maddening indifference. Draco wants him gone, but he’s a coward, so he won’t say it to Harry’s face. He’s going to make Harry lose it and then pin it on him when he is forced to leave.
It is polite, simple, to the point. He snorts inelegantly at the bit where Potter and Weasley send regards, obvious sarcasm on Granger’s part. A bit demanding overall, but he has known the woman for a while and she is nothing if not demanding. He pens a quick reply,
With shaking fingers, he lifts it, expecting divorce papers, or a deed to another house (unnecessary given that Draco has another house for himself which he’s waiting– stalling– to move into).
Harry smiles and lets go of Draco’s cock, only to swirl his finger around the slit that is now leaking precome on Harry’s stomach. Harry thrusts up again and Draco cries out, driving his nails into Harry’s hips.
“So, what?” Potter asks mockingly. “I ought to go to classes just because everyone who is going has also gone through the War? I should go to dinner because everyone else eating has also known what its like to not have an appetite?”
He looks at the way Potter’s shoulders fill out his shirts now, so vastly different from the oversized, ugly clothes of his younger years. He finds himself staring at the way Potter grips his wand when he’s casting, looking away only when he sees Potter shooting him strange looks. He knows that Potter’s collarbones sometimes peek out when he’s roaming around in Muggle t-shirts without his robes and he’s grown resigned to the fact that when that happens, his eyes have a hard time looking at anything else.
fault that Minerva McGonagall’s understanding of Transfiguration is not the same as his, therefore ensuring a solid A instead of the O he expected.
none of which is particularly interesting. When he methodically works through the list of recommendations, they talk about Frankenstein and about Rebecca and during one particularly scarring conversation, Lolita.
Harry breathes like a broken dream, all shattered edges as he devastates Draco with the push and pull of his whole being and Draco clings to him, the tidal surge of want crashing over them like an ocean.
“Not quite,” Death says. Their face is an indeterminable kaleidoscope. Sometimes he thinks it looks like someone he knows, and sometimes it could be any innocuous stranger on the street. “It isn’t exactly punishme–”
“I don’t want to be an Auror,” Harry blurts out at the dinner table. Everyone stops talking. Percy, carrying most of the conversation with a surprisingly interesting retelling of some secretary’s complete incompetence has adopted a patently wounded expression. Ron’s fork is poised near his mouth but his eyes are fixed on Harry. Hermione doesn’t look surprised, but she does look resigned. Molly, who had been serving Ginny, looks concerned.
His whole body feels heavy and weighted, like a drowning body with stones tied to the legs. His brain is still undecided between overwrought with worry and completely blank, a strange flickering juxtaposition that leaves him overwhelmed as he lies on the bed, blinking up at the white ceiling, trying not to choke on the overwhelming sweetness of Harry’s shampoo.
—waiting for Draco’s face to fall or his words to grow colder. But with growth seems to have come a certain degree of acceptance and Draco doesn’t necessarily like his year of forced holiday, but he’s come to understand that if he must live through it, not shutting down every time its mentioned would be a good place to start with getting used to his circumstances.
“Some Muggle-born’s father sent it to me right after the War. I kept them under the bed and sort of forgot but well…” he smiles up at Draco sheepishly. Draco’s unreadable expression doesn’t shift at all even though his eyes flicker with something.
He remembers the day it had been clicked a little too well– both him and Draco home from work without much to do save watch their son play and poke fun at each other while stealing kisses. He’d been figuring out how to work a Muggle camera back then, fiddling with the controls, trying out different versions and modes in an attempt to click something that wasn’t either unfocused or overexposed.
He stops and then with a wince, adds hurriedly, “And I would like to extend another branch of my gratitude to the Minister who has ensured that I, despite not… despite not entirely being… deserving of this fair trial have received it. I… yes, thank you.”
Harry opens his eyes to bright light and a sense of unfamiliar emptiness, instinctively aware that he isn’t alive.
All of a sudden Harry understands the flush. The stammering. He thinks he might mirror it if he doesn’t get a hold of himself. For once, his colouring will do him some favours, hiding the ferocity of it were it to happen.
“Indeed,” Blaise says, raising those perfectly arched eyebrows. No straight man has eyebrows that perfect. Figures that Blaise is not a straight man, but then, Draco wonders with no small amount of disappointment,
So even when he hates Malfoy, a little part of him grudgingly admits that perhaps his presence that day had been necessary, perhaps the outburst in the kitchen had set Harry’s life to rights. And for that, he has to thank Malfoy. Even if the thanks in this case may only be delivered as an apology. So today when Hermione looked at him expectantly, he nodded and she looked so pleased that before leaving, he had kissed her fondly on the cheek. It isn’t often one finds a friend whose expectations you meet and exceed with gestures as simple as… apologising. Even if it is to Malfoy, for everything Hermione and Ron have done for Harry for the past seven years of his life, it is an insignificant price to pay.
It’s just as well that everyone has maintained a considerable distance, choosing to leave Draco to his own devices. Merlin knows what he would have done if someone had made an attempt at either confrontation or conversation (neither of which Draco knows he can avoid forever) because anytime he even contemplates opening his mouth to speak, his tongue seems to shrivel in on itself.
They run into each other in Knockturn of all places because Harry’s luck is nothing if not antagonistically fickle.
Harry has his own legacy, a vault full of money, a face he cannot claim to have worn first for its striking resemblance to a man he never knew, eyes that give him away as his mother’s son. But it’s one of bravery and love, of sacrifice so great that Harry resents it just as deeply as he is grateful to it. It’s a legacy of blood and death and ferocity, Gryffindor to its core.
It is a problem, Draco realises with dawning horror when he walks up to Granger in the library and notices for the first time the mop of black, messy hair that could belong to only one person.
“I’m certain you know the way to the Floo?” he asks, gesturing to the fireplace beside them. “I trust you can see yourself out?”
“Not quite. It didn’t progress too far, ever. But it was… definitely there. Definitely always, always there, in the rooms, in the walls, in my head. In his smile. All those terrible, rotten, stinking teeth, smiling at me across a room…” he can’t hold in his revulsed shudder.
“‘Mione, please don’t cry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” He continues to whisper apologies to her and rocks her slightly like he used to when Ron had left them in the Forest of Dean, the memories assaulting him, vivid and fresh, bringing on a fresh onslaught of tears. When she stops crying and pulls away, the way her face has crumpled makes his heart ache with regret.
“And you broke the Fidelius Charm for that? I don’t even know what it is!” Harry asks, incredulous and enraged. Something rattles in the background and Harry feels his magic surge dangerously in his veins.
It had led to one of those rare moments he had opened his arms up for a hug, and Harry had stepped into it with a surprised huff, and held on longer than he usually did.
Dinner is a formal affair, Harry sitting at one end of the table, Malfoy at the other. Harry notices the elf Malfoy shouted at—Gianni—isn’t the one serving them. From Malfoy’s stricken expression, he notices it too.
“What?” Harry asks, surprised and a little hurt. “Why’d you suggest it if you didn’t want me to come along?”
s aimed at his legs, of pain and of humiliation, of the naked desperation of being a boy in a house full of rabid dogs. He blinks and the white walls of the motel room fade until he’s a ghost in the Manor, locked in a mindscape of memories.
A hand on his shoulder startles him terribly. He looks around to see Ron standing behind him, a patented glare fixed on his face. He lowers his eyes to the ground, hoping Ron doesn’t shout at him here because that would wake up the two of them on his couch but also expecting a dressing down, a reprimand, a falling out with his best friend.
“I don’t understand it,” Potter says, and he sounds so lost, that if it were another man, or if Draco himself were another man, he’d have reached out to touch him. “I don’t know why I came here, I don’t know why I spoke for you. I don’t even really know why I went back for you. In the fire.”
“What do you mean?” Something in the tone of her voice betrays that she is repeating herself. That he didn’t hear her the first time because he was too caught up in his own head.
Harry buries his face in his hands. He looks up only when he feels a light touch on his shoulder and finds himself staring into concerned and slightly amused grey eyes.
Potter looks down. Then back up. Only those who had made it a mealtime obsession to carefully catalogue each and every one of Potter’s expressions would recognise the slight falter.
When they’re alone with their plates, Harry’s anger spills. “Satisfied?” he asks, gesturing in the direction the elves seem to materialise from. “You don’t need to put on a show for me, you know.”
“I’m gay,” Draco had blurted out immediately, horrified at both himself and the situation. Granger hadn’t bothered to comment on it, raising a sceptical eyebrow instead.
“Goes back to the Medieval times,” Draco says, gesturing towards the archways. “The Muggle parts attract tourists from all over. The wizarding part is smaller, more reserved. The Malfoy villa is there.”
Which is why he doesn’t pay attention to when their conversation goes from Abraxan horses that his grandfather had specially made stables for in the barn to Harry’s hands on his buttons and his lips on his earlobe. He only realises that Harry is no longer touching him, no longer kissing down his sensitive, tingly ear when a draught passing through the windows touches on the exposed trails on his skin, cooling them in  fashion he isn’t particularly fond of.
“If Potter’s okay with it, who am I to object?” His voice comes out even and some of the tension dissipates from the lines of Granger’s face.
“I’m not anymore,” Harry points out. Draco looks up at him, and it’s unfair really, how the sight of those wide grey-blue eyes undoes the tightly done up clasps of Harry’s anger and resentment, melting it away into a pool of hurt and resignation.
“The more I hear about the Dursleys, the more I want to show up wherever they’re holed up and experiment with some of the more creative spells I’ve come across,” Hermione says, matter-of-factly. Ron snorts in agreement. “But anyway, you could go somewhere—anywhere. By yourself. Remake your memories of travelling.”
Anything he thinks now, says now, he can blame on his sex addled, overworking, excited brain. Anything he says now will be disregarded. It’s simultaneously liberating and gut-wrenching.
There is guilt, when Potter frames it like that, a bald truth that had been drowned out by the tinkling laughter of his mother’s guests and the booming declarations of his father’s business associates. It had been a tune secreted away in his mother’s eyes when she misspoke and mentioned her forgotten sister, a pride etched into the elegant head of his father’s cane.
Sometimes they don’t talk with words. Sometimes, their bodies do all the talking, and it’s a glorious, sweat-slicked mess of muttered curses and endearments and Draco’s hands in his hair, on his biceps, on his lower back, Draco’s eyes fluttering shut with every push of Harry’s hips into his body, and the salty sweetness of his skin filling Harry’s mouth with a taste he can’t forget even when he jerks awake.
Scorpius shrugs, and chokes out a laugh. “Son of the most famous couple in Wizarding Britain, probably one of the richest blokes– I was supposed to inherit the Potter, Malfoy
“I will have the Blue Room made up for the young masters,” the elf says, bowing again, nose scraping the ground.
The shock of seeing Malfoy actually opening the door is completely masked by the shock of taking in his appearance. Harry has no other word for it- all he can think of is that Malfoy appears
“What?” Draco responds, flabbergasted. Last he remembers, he had no War injuries on his face. Then suddenly he remembers the sharp pain that had not only required a few Healing Charms but also Murtlap and Dittany and lets out a burst of laughter. “That’s where Archimedes bit me yesterday.”
There is no wall. There is grey, and there is the delicate sweep of blond eyelashes around them, the arched brows of an aristocratic face, the highs of pink tinged cheekbones. There is no wall, but there is Draco Malfoy and he looks terrified.
Harry has died once and if he must do it again so soon, for the last time, he wants to do it better.
He crouches next to her and peers into her tear streaked, scrunched up face. He tries to catch her attention without touching her but when nothing seems to work, he clamps his hand over her mouth.
But the poison Harry has worked into his system has done its job, and there is no part of Harry left to listen to him.
Her world famous Saviour husband rising in the Auror ranks, being groomed for either Minister or Head Auror.
“I’ve never spent Christmas outside of Britain,” Harry offers. It’s not the same, but it’s something and Draco realises that they’re both still unsure of how and what to do and that all of it doesn’t have to always make sense.
It’s Harry’s turn to groan and Weasley slaps him on the back with a grin. “Go up there and look like the Saviour mate. They’ll all say yes in sheer gratefulness.”
“Mate,” Ron says, quiet and a little hesitant. “We’ll support you even if you decide to become a rat breeder in the French Alps. You don’t have to worry ‘bout that.”
He tries to vocalise it, “I wish I could but—it’s just—with the Forest and everything else—I don’t—”
Granger frowns before her expression clears. “No, I mean yes, but they are a separate department. They’re set up in Hogsmeade. And they don’t really care who you are.”
“Opened that one the day before yesterday,” he says without opening his eyes which have fallen shut again. He isn’t sleepy but the light hurts.
A tremulous smile makes its way onto Gianni’s face and he bobs his head a little, taking the glass back from Draco. “Young master is calling when he is needing something,” he says and Draco sighs in relief. When he opens his eyes, the elf is gone.
Most importantly, the diligent Auror who never asked for personal leave except when Kingsley thrust it on him has been staying home three days a week (four, if one includes Sundays), asking his PA to take over paperwork and his best friend (and Deputy) to take over the more challenging field work.
At some point during that admission, a no doubt painful, wringing, heart wrenching admission, Harry had grasped onto Draco’s clenched hand beneath the covers, gently pried apart the fingers and twined them together. Now Harry brings their conjoined hands out and kisses Draco’s fingers where they contrast beautifully against his own skin.
Brushing relegated to the least of his priorities, Harry rushes down, wand in hand with the intention of throwing the bastard out of Sirius’ house when the scene that greets him in the kitchen glues his feet to the floor.
“Specially designed, yet again,” says the elf who is still standing there. Harry looks towards him and wonders if all Italian elves have salacious smiles when they are enjoying some private jokes at their guest’s expense. “For unmarried couples.”
That’s when Harry notices. The more worked up Malfoy gets, the more the Glamour stabilises. In fact, at this point had he not been able to sense its presence being in such close proximity, he would say it wasn’t there. His magic seems to be… feeding off his nervousness, his excitement.
When he wakes up again, Draco is sitting where he should be, both his hands holding Scorpius’. There are hands in his hair too, blunt fingers scratching soothing patterns across his scalp. This time, the other visitor in the room is most definitely Harry.
Breathless with laughter, Draco snorts inelegantly. “Sure know how to make a man feel special, eh, Potter?”
She looks the way Harry remembers from the battle, but as his eyes catalogue the differences in the time it takes his brain to process the fact that for some reason, Parkinson is
Harry comes back up. “Hey,” he whispers. There’s a small smile on his face. “If you’re having second thoughts, we can do this later.”
Draco reels a little with surprise. He knows Harry isn’t the type, but part of him had expected to be the filthy little secret. A hidden away toy, a written off friendship. But Harry told… told… the other two thirds of the Golden Trio about it and it sparks something in his heart that spirals from a match into a wildfire.
Hermione’s laughing now, and Harry can’t hold his own laughter back and after a beat, Ron’s joining in.
Harry gets angry sometimes. They pick fights over small things and end them over larger declarations of vulnerability and hurt. Draco goes blank sometimes, the cynicism he inculcated as a survival tactic resurfacing to rip his progress to shreds. Harry doesn’t allow it, stitching his reformation back with quips and cutting comments and patience flavoured with gentleness. Draco learns to seek him out when the precipice feels too close and Harry learns the best ways to walk them both backwards.
“She’s at Durmstrang. Getting her NEWTS. She left after Fred’s funeral. We never, we didn’t…” he trails off, looking slightly lost.
Draco’s balls ache, he’s much too close already, and he doesn’t want to come like this, in his pants, like a teenager rutting against another against the stone walls of Hogwarts.
Harry shakes his head. He’s too far gone to know what he wants or care what Draco gives, as long as it relieves some of the pressure that’s pressing against his abdomen, threatening to explode.
He wants to touch Harry, bury his fingers into the curling hair resting against his navel, tickling him ever so slightly, but Harry asked him to keep his hands out of the way, so he keeps them itching and uneasy, tucked under his head. It doesn’t stop him from arching into the sensation of Harry’s mouth and the wonderful, delicious suction it provides and Harry eventually has to hold his hips down with both hands.
So instead of letting Draco go and get his lunch or whatever, Harry reaches out and almost childishly grips at his wrist and mumbles, “Stay,” hoping Draco listens. “At least till I fall asleep.” As an afterthought he adds, “Please?”
“The quiet terrifies me,” Draco admits. “After, after the Manor. The quiet can have anything in it.”
Harry nods, circling his rim with one finger, and Draco gasps softly at the slight pressure and the teasing pleasure of the movement. “Inside me,” he manages through clenched teeth.
Malfoy strides forward, purposeful and poised, feet striking the marble heel first. It makes a soft thudding sound that Harry focuses on to keep himself steady.
“Where do you want to go?” Draco counters because he doesn’t like to dwell on his decisions. Potter shrugs.
That makes it sound worse than it really is—admittedly, vaguely cannibalistic and definitely violent—but Harry really, really wants to taste the sharp jut of Malfoy’s collarbone, run his hands down Malfoy’s side, grope his arse a little, slide his palms up the jut of his scapulas.
It’s… not that he doesn’t want to. Merlin knows he does. He wants Draco in his bed and from the way Draco’s eyes fill with fraught longing every evening before he leaves, Harry suspects Draco wants that too. But Harry’s Gryffindor courage has deserted him the entirety of the past week and Draco hasn’t brought it up, so they’ve skirted the issue with the sort of ignorant smoothness that can only be achieved by two people trying to avoid the same discussion.
‘How could I forget?’ Harry asks, looking into Draco’s eyes, which flutter shut when Harry’s breath ghosts over his mouth.
Draco’s sure his mouth is open. He stares at her, at a complete loss because of all the things he expected, this isn’t it.
Draco’s never had any religion, none Wizarding, despite the fanatical cult he joined and none Muggle for obvious reasons. But as Harry’s tongue presses against his teeth and swipes across his bottom lip, and the lips pressing against his own bloom in a smile that tastes of forbidden hope and peppermint, he wonders if this is what faith feels like.
He wonders when his self preservation deserted him, but he finds that he doesn’t mind if Harry keeps kissing him like he’s the centre of a universe Harry has created for himself. There are words locked away in the crevices of Draco’s mouth and words more dangerous kept kicking and screaming in the darkest cells of Draco’s heart. But he’s grateful that this moment seems too big for words or sound or anything except this spellbound eye-contact because Draco doesn’t think self control can be expected of him today.
“Reminds me too much of PIvet Drive,” he’d muttered into the crook of Draco’s neck one night. “I want to know the whole space is ours, that there are no limits to where I can and can’t be.”
The elf stares up at them, eyes wide and ears perked and says in a tremulous voice, thick with an Italian accent, “Is Master Malfoy truly being here or is Gianni being seeing things in his old age?”
“That’s because you came with me,” Draco says, haughtily. He pairs it with a smile to let Harry know he’s joking but Harry’s expression turns oddly serious.
Hermione tenses beside him but Harry doesn’t want to argue. “Britain is my country,” he reminds Ron.
“You must be starving,” Harry says, because he’s pretty sure Draco hasn’t eaten anything since Harry woke up, plastered to his sweaty chest, seeing his eyes open and unseeing, frozen in a limbo Harry couldn’t drag him out of.
The familiar feeling of the guard’s fingers pressing into the bruises on his shoulders drags Draco out of his reverie, then the chair, then the courtroom.
“It’s still you,” he says. “Still you, still your skin, still something you own. Something you survived. He hasn’t claimed that part of you, Draco. The skin on your shoulders doesn’t belong to Greyback. If it did, I wouldn’t go near it, but it doesn’t. It belongs to you. It’s still yours, Draco,” he enunciates, carefully, slowly, making sure every word hits home. “Still yours.”
“I didn’t fight for this,” he says, voice coming out hoarse and heavy with suppressed tears. “I didn’t fight for everyone involved to just keep living with the aftereffects and the shocks and horrors.” He stares bleakly at her, feeling exhausted and weak. “What was the point in getting rid of him if he keeps living on in our minds? I was supposed to save the world, Mione but all I did was, was…” he can’t go on, voice breaking into sobs. Hermione pulls him to her, close and safe. She smells of dust and old books and the familiar tightness of her arms allows Harry to let go.
When he approaches, he sees out of the corner of his eye the way Harry looks him up and down, focusing instead on Hermione who’s grinning at him. “You clean up well, Malfoy,” she tells him. Weasley nods behind her. “You too,” he tells her, taking in her black, embroidered robes and leaning down to kiss her knuckles. “Good to see you Weasley,” he says, politely and is surprised to find he actually means it. Weasley nods, if a bit awkwardly but its more than Draco expected anyway.
She disappears and Draco takes stock of his surroundings, convinced at this point that all this is an elaborate hallucination. Someone in Diagon Alley must have thrown a curse at him and he’s standing in the middle of the road at this moment, making a spectacle of himself. When a sharp pinch to his thigh does not change his surroundings, he shrugs. If it is a hallucination, he might as well see what he can come up with.
He doesn’t tell any of them this. He pretends to be bored when Granger suggests a new place, scowls at Potter and insults him whenever he’s there and tells Weasley his tarts need work even if he did spend the previous afternoon polishing them off in three seconds each and wishing for more. But he suspects they know anyway because Granger takes him to more astronomical observatories after she finds out he liked the first one, remembers his coffee order when he can’t wrap his head around the weird names. Because Potter turns up every Wednesday and Friday without fail no matter how many times Draco makes him wait on the porch and jabbers about Quidditch scores and Weasley just smiles and piles more potatoes on his plate.
It’s not vicious and violent the way Harry had fantasised. It’s not as passionate as he’d probably like in bed. But in the quiet embrace in the middle of his room with Draco holding him up and him holding Draco up, it’s perfect in the way only unpredictability can be.
Draco raises his own hands tentatively, unsure how his touch will be perceived, whether his questing fingers will be the pin that pricks this bubble of paradise.
He’d smiled. The words he’d carefully tried to secret away in the darker corners of his heart spilled from his lips when he made no attempt to push them back down into their casket, “Why stay with father though he led you into the trap of a genocidal maniac, mother?”
“My other father,” Scorpius says, feeling gently perplexed. Merlin, they must be from somewhere else. “Harry Potter. For Merlin’s sake, don’t you know
Draco nods. Nothing seems adequate in response. Nothing seems appropriate. Nothing he can offer, and nothing Harry could take from him with a clear conscience.
“He’s having an affair,” she blurts out, a few uncomfortable moments into the quietness. “I’m sure of it.”
(That’s something Aunt Hermione has brought up more than once with both Harry and Draco, looking down pointedly at their still gleaming wedding rings.)
Harry’s eyes close as the words seemingly strike against some unknown part of him. When he opens them again, something in them makes Draco uneasy. It’s different from the looks Harry has been giving him all evening and Draco’s stomach twists in fear.
“You’re spectacular,” Harry says, raising a hand to cup Draco’s cheek, post-orgasmic lassitude loosening his tongue. “That was bloody brilliant.”
After a few moments, she removes herself and wipes her face on the back of her hand. “Thank you,” she whispers, voice hoarse and barely audible from all the shouting. “Do you have some Calming Draught? I think I ran out.” Draco nods and reaches into his pocket where he keeps his supply of the Draught. He hands it to her and she measures it out drop my drop onto her tongue. After she swallows, she casts a throat clearing charm and says, “If you want to leave, you can. I can handle this by myself.”
“Don’t deny it,” Harry says, because right now, he doesn’t think he can handle Draco’s affinity to cart his mistakes off on the shoulders of everyone but himself. Right now, he needs honesty. “Don’t deny what I saw and what I felt. I’m too much sometimes, I know. You don’t have to explain.”
They stand there, watching the empty bed. Scorpius wishes he could scream to some avail. He wishes he could cry into Aunt Hermione’s lap. This hurts more than knowing Death was coming ever did.
Death has its symphony, Harry has come to realise. In the rhythm of blood and the crescendo of screams, in the drumbeat of bodies falling, in the thundering of a heart.
Neither of them say anything for a while. The silence isn’t tense but it isn’t comfortable. Something’s unsettled in the air.
“Would anyone care to tell me what a Death Eater is doing in my kitchen?” He keeps his tone deceptively casual, as though he’s asking what Hermione’s cooking for lunch.
The forced laughter issuing from the Gryffindor posse grates on Draco’s ears. Watching Weasley, Granger and Potter during meals was Draco’s forte- so much so that he learnt to keep track of all their conversations from the movement of their lips and the subtle shifts in body language.
Draco’s breath has long deserted him. Hs entire world has narrowed down to the feeling of Harry’s hands on his cock and Harry’s mouth whispering dirty things into his ears. With those words, if he has a choice, he can’t be the one to choose. To put Harry in that position, make him fall apart and put him back together? Or to be that vulnerable, to be that open and allow himself to be taken apart?
Something had cleared in Narcissa’s eyes. Even on her deathbed, she’d arched eyebrows with the grace of a queen bestowing her gaze upon an errant subject.
Harry’s brows draw down in confusion but Draco is already backing away repeating, “Fuck, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, that was a mistake. We’re just idiots, I’m going to leave.”
Parkinson snarls like a wild animal caught in a trap. “You don’t have to pity me!” she says, jabbing a finger in Harry’s face. “Our holy Saviour, taking pity on the little Hogwarts whore—”
As Harry rose in the ranks of the Auror Corps, he could gradually dedicate less time to the informal investigation. His relationship with Draco was in its flourishing stages and he could only focus on an obsessive hunch for so long. But he never let it go, and more importantly, never explained what had encouraged the hunch in the first place.
He can’t explain the precise reason why his breath skitters when he takes in the picture Malfoy makes, sinful and a little mischievous when the grey eyes open and the finger slides out of his mouth, spit slick and dark with lingering chocolate.
Malfoy squeezes his eyes shut. He drops his fork, nods and after clenching and unclenching his hands a few times begins, “Right then. Thank you for the meal–”
Draco buries his face in his hands. “I don’t know,” he says, and wonders if he sounds as woefully inadequate to Potter as he does to himself. “I don’t know, but I’m assuming something and I shouldn’t. I don’t know what it is, yet.”
First Draco thinks of simply not answering. Or perhaps lying and saying he dropped the rest of it. But then he remembers that this is Potter and more likely than not, he’s sitting on the precariously brittle fence that stops Potter from calling the Aurors on him. Maybe they’re waiting outside the gates for a signal from Potter. Maybe Potter’s here to dismantle whatever protective spells keep them from entering. Maybe, maybe… his thought trail off. This is the effect of having panic attacks on the Draught. His thoughts go haywire with or without the damn thing but on the potion, his heart rate refuses to pick up, his mouth doesn’t go dry. He remembers some of Potions theory, knows that the Potion’s affects all the vital organs except the brain. Snape had been trying to work on a variation affecting the brain too before… Before.
“I don’t have comfort to offer here, Harry. I’m telling you, you need help. You had to be sedated with Dreamless Sleep after the Stunner wore off. The dosage was so strong that it gave you the headache.”
A fair, indisputable point. Draco can’t argue it so he chooses to settle back against the couch. But just because he has to accept it doesn’t mean he has to be happy about it or anything.
When they enter Harry’s room, still kissing, moaning gently against each other’s lips, Harry’s shirt buttons are undone and Draco’s lost his somewhere along the way. Impatiently, Draco pushes the material off Harry’s shoulders and it falls to the floor. Moving backwards, he trips over it and stumbles surprised straight onto the bed on his back, pulling Draco down on top of him.
Draco would be inelegantly shovelling food into his mouth, the green case files signifying a pro-bono open in front of him.
Draco’s heart wants to burst right out of his chest and flutter into the charged air surrounding them.
They’re pooling around his ankles by the time Harry’s done with them and his dick is pressing hot, heavy and hard against his navel. The arousal is so strong that it aches– there is a physical pain almost in his heavily hanging balls and bobbing dick but when he reaches out a hand to relieve some of the pressure, it is immediately swatted away.
“Will you be handing me the papers then?” Draco asks, breaking the hush. It’s sudden. Harry startles.
He’s gasping, he can tell, but there’s the voice again, eerily similar to Draco’s, telling him to breathe, and Harry doesn’t feel quite as cynical about breathing anymore, especially not when the voice gives him a template of exaggerated breaths to copy.
When Harry’s fingers start to feel numb from the rapid writing and the chicken scratch on the paper appears to barely be legible, he casts a glance at Malfoy and Hermione still passionately discussing the merits of history lessons on the medieval age in both Muggle and Wizarding culture and decides he has had enough for the day.
“Might as well,” he mutters in his posh accent, flicking his gaze back down towards where Harry’s shattered purchases are still rolling on the ground.
Harry doesn’t. But he can make sense of the string of words in context and he doesn’t want to dwell on them. Uncomfortable truths. Too many uncomfortable truths.
It is Potter. He enters, looking entirely unsure of himself, hands shoved into the pockets of the Muggle trousers he insists on wearing, boots scuffing the floor.
“Don’t think I haven’t thought about that enough myself. But I don’t want their blood on my hands. And I don’t want them on yours.”
Harry has never been more confused in his life. “What the bloody hell are you saying?” He peers into Malfoy’s eyes, trying to discern if the pupils are blown. “Have you been drinking?”
In a way, he supposes it does. Blaise had weathered Draco through his obsessive periods when hearing Potter’s name would rile him up, seeing him in the hallways would make his accidental magic run wild. Blaise remembers the Draco from Hogwarts who had spent six years vying for attention he claimed not to want but exulted in when provided, however negative.
Harry’s trembling from it, shaking on the bed and when he squints to look at Draco, Draco’s expression is tight with arousal and wonder.
By the time they make it to the bed, they’re so tangled up in each other that Harry can’t tell where he begins and Draco ends. He knows that his lips are kiss-swollen and heavy, he knows that his soul has been set on fire, he knows that Draco’s mouth is far too skilled for life to be fair.
He hadn’t appreciated Malfoy’s retracted claws up until the moment he’s been faced with them out again, a defensive layer of protection Malfoy is drawing on.
Once he’d heard Neville’s footsteps fade into the forest, he’d dropped to his knees and sought the Stone out with the Wand.
They both seem to have expected this, because neither of them look shocked or even surprised. When Harry opens his eyes, his glasses are fogged over, and Draco’s tears flow freer than before. Their fingers tighten on his arms.
They sit like that for a minute until they hear heels clicking on the staircase. Healer Choudhury steps in, assesses the wreckage that used to be a room and clicks her tongue. “Draco, why don’t you take Hermione and go downstairs while I see to Ron?”
Malfoy looks embarrassed again. “It’s my birthday, Potter,” he scowls, struggling to keep it from morphing into mortification and not quite succeeding. “Be nice.”
In the absence of Potter’s weirdly steadying company, the bone deep ache of his mother’s absence, the weight of his friends not talking to him, the circumstances where the only person willing to put up with him is his childhood enemy—
The sharks of the gossip columns have learnt all too well what sort of eye it takes to find the chinks in ironclad armour. How to taste vulnerability in the air.
Draco wasn’t much of a cook, but he hung around chatting about Scorpius’ latest antics and Blaise’s latest conquests and his latest client wanting to feel him up despite him being happily married and that being a pretty regular fact in the papers.
Draco’s hands immediately trace across the outside of his thigh, a reassuring gentle touch and the immediate flush of exposure fades into the warm embrace of safety. Harry never thought his first time doing this would be with Draco Malfoy, but now that he has it, he wouldn’t trade it for the world.
He whistles for Archimedes who comes sweeping in within a few seconds. He must have been out hunting in the backyard. He ties the letter to his leg and sends him off before returning to his task of cleaning out the East Wing bedrooms.
When they break away from each other, Harry’s eyes are shining and his lips are kiss-swollen. In that moment, Draco knows Harry has never looked more beautiful.
“No,” Draco says, to Harry’s unsurprised resignation. “We’ll get caught up in, in other things and we need to say these things. We need to talk.”
Potter glares at him for a few more seconds before the fight seems to completely leave his body. “She doesn’t need to hang around me more than she has to. I’m… not who I used to be.”
They share a melancholy look of mirrored sadness and keep talking till dawn arrives with its new light and chirping birds in the garden at the back. Then they fall onto the repaired couch and with a satisfied sigh, look at the fixed furniture, the restored picture frames, the repaired mantel and fall asleep side by side, Draco feeling lighter than he has in what seems to be an eternity.
“And if you don’t do something with this grotesque, undeserved, pathetic life of yours, I’m going to end it with my bare hands.”
Scorpius isn’t alive anymore, but in dreams, he smiles– Harry’s little boy, his sweet child– like he never acquired that Wasting Curse from ‘genetic predisposition’ and Harry can touch him and kiss him and lull him to sleep without keeping one eye open for atrophy cramps.
He’s a ticking bomb. Ready to blast his surroundings to pieces. Not quite himself anymore, not Harry anymore. He hasn’t felt like himself since he took a killing curse directly to the chest.
Harry knows this. Sees the way Hermione stands apart from him and Ron when they talk to Molly, eyes distant and sad. Sees the way she can’t seem to stop crying some nights. Sees the way Ron pulls her close and mutters reassurances into her hair.
“No, no, I didn’t do anything… it just, it sort of didn’t go quite as well as I had hoped,” he tells her, unsure how to convey that today’s visit has unsettled him to the very core.
“For now. When those situation come up, when you’re triggered, when you’re upset and you’re spiralling, I’ll say more. And after, you’ll tell me what happened so I know how to avoid it or deal with it the next time. And you’re going to get help and you’re going to learn how to be better and everything,” he says, trying to push his conviction into his voice, “will be alright.”
Harry giggles. “You already know you can’t open it with magic. You tried, re-re-remember?” He hiccups loudly. “Do ya know what hap, happened the last time Malboi came, came, knock knock? He kisssssed me. All sweet an’ gentle an’ soft. An’ I thought,” he breaks into a fit of hiccups, “thought my dreams, thy were comin’ true! An’ I kissed ‘im back. An’ kissed an’ kissed.” Here he pauses and starts sobbing, “‘An he left me! Like erryone else! Ran away!”
Harry pushes in, and he’s so careful, so tender and gentle, one hand reaching up to brush Draco’s sweaty hair away from his forehead.
To be honest, Draco has no idea how they are holding off for so long but every minute seems to be building up, seems to be setting into motion the grander scheme of things. Draco might be impatient but he knows that whatever is coming is definitely worth the wait.
They’re standing now—for the Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt in all his authoritative glory stalking in with files under his burly arms, sharp eyes surveying the crowd of people in the circular pews before settling with unerring accuracy on Draco.
Harry’s ears tint a little pink. “Ron and ‘Mione know the… gist of it. They don’t get it, not really and I understand that, but they know and they love me so they won’t… make a deal of it right now.”
“Yes,” Draco replies, weary. He can’t defend his decisions to Potter now. Calming Draught is legal, if frowned upon by Healers when taken in incorrect dosages. Potter is no Healer, the last time Draco checked.
“Don’t.” Draco can’t handle Pansy. Pansy with her biting words and sharp fury and intense hatred of Draco’s ‘stupid’ decisions and her miserable fucking sympathy– he loves her, but he can’t– he doesn’t know– oh fuck it all, not
“It’s easy,” Harry had said. “It’s easy when you greet Death like an old friend. There’s no point in resistance. There’s no point in argument. There’s no point fighting when you already know you’ve lost. Best not make enemies with the inevitable.” At the time, Scorpius hadn’t known if Harry was really talking about Death itself or the death of something else entirely, like Harry’s ability to meet Draco’s eyes.
Harry’s heart clenches at the realisation that he has ruined what was Hermione’s first effort in weeks to cook something herself. He doesn’t know why.
Scorpius now knows that whatever he had seen at the time had started a deep burning suspicion in Harry’s gut that led him to almost obsessively trail Selwyn’s activities when his sentence of house arrest ended. He’d been convinced that Selwyn was up to something nefarious, though none of the higher ups ever signed off on opening an investigation.
He tries to pull Harry off, not wanting it to finish so fast but Harry grips tightly on to hips with almost bruising force, continuing the suction around his cock.
What Harry doesn’t understand is how the man maintains that level of strong magic at all times. The Malfoy he saw a couple days ago looked too weak to even cast a Levitation Charm but here he is, holding up a Glamour so powerful that it would have anybody fooled. Except him, but he has always been the exception when it comes to seeing through Malfoy’s facades.
