“And I wish our families’ fates had never crossed. Maybe things could have been different for us, but fate is hardly ever
Harry shuffled the notes on his desk to the side, running a hand through his hair. “Of course, bring them in, Jack.”
The boy whimpered, pressing his hips back as Harry delved his tongue inside of his hole.
He had to
. You’re respected in the Wizarding community and you have a good career at the Ministry. You don’t want some unmated eighteen-year-old dropout with a pup messing things up. You don’t
Draco had turned away from the mirror, unable to look at his reflection anymore.
She let out a strained hiccup, her fingers tightening in his shirt.
Draco winced, rubbing his hand over his stomach when he felt his pup nudge from within. “Theo was always the one who set them,” he said softly. “I was never very good at it.”
The look in Harry’s eyes was enough to make his tears finally fall. They slid down his cheeks in warm rivulets, dripping to Scorpius’ small cheek as he sleepily nursed.
Harry looked as if he wanted to
Harry knew he should leave the bedroom. A sexual relationship between a carnivore and an herbivore was strictly forbidden. He was putting himself and the boy at risk if he gave in.
Magical pregnancy was only possible for an Omega witch or wizard. Even then, it was extremely high risk. The precautions that had to be taken after an Omega witch or wizard was impregnated were endless. They had to be carefully observed and rarely left alone.
Alphas naturally produced powerful healing enzymes that were released through their saliva. The enzymes served the purpose of healing their Omega before and after childbirth. Any difficulties that would arise from pregnancy, birth, or postpartum care was the sole responsibility of the Alpha who had gotten the Omega pregnant.
Harry snorted, dropping the sheet. “This is my home; you are
“Sweetheart, no,” Harry chided.
Harry grinned and waved at the adorable pup. “Goodbye, Scorpius. I hope to see you again, little one.”
Harry reached down, burrowing his fingers into Draco’s hair, gripping tight. He knelt, putting himself at eye-level with Draco.
There it was.
Draco remained silent, his eyes downcast. He was trembling, the truth bubbling up in his throat and threatening to spill over as the man bore a hole into him with his eyes from above.
Draco felt a tendril of warmth form inside of his chest for the kind man. At least Pansy was in love with someone who was so kind.
Harry swallowed it all, his green eyes never leaving Draco’s as he came down, his chest rising and falling in quick, shallow pants.
Harry dropped Draco and he fell to the floor, a sobbing crumple of pale limbs and hair.
His face wasn’t visible from where Draco laid on the bed, swathed in shadows in the darkened room. His long legs were spread in front of him, his palms laid flat atop his thighs.
Scorpius’ nursery had been designed by his mother, her refined taste obvious in every piece of posh furniture in the room. She had chosen to decorate in shades of light gray and black. They had just transitioned Scorpius’ crib into a toddler bed, but most nights his pup still slept with him since he still breastfed.
The memory chapter is done, I just have to edit it. I didn’t want to combine it with this one because I want it to be on its own. I’ll upload it soon! Thank you for reading my story and I’m trying to reply to comments as quick as I can!
room.
“Would you like me to hold him while you eat?” Harry offered.
-girlfriend.
Harry brushed past him, leaving Draco alone in the drawing room.
The oils were to be taken orally at least once a week. It helped in suppressing his scent as an omega and made his heats less intense when they came each month. His heats were especially unbearable, so his mother had made the oils to lessen his misery during his estrus.
The Alpha within him bristled, wanting to show the little Omega just how
. I work with your master at the Ministry. Perhaps he could loan you out to me during one of your heats.”
Harry waited until Draco was inches away from his face before grabbing his head in both of his large hands and yanking his mouth down against his own in a punishing kiss.

The sight that met Draco upon entering the kitchen made him halt in his tracks.
curled sourly within Draco thinking of Harry with some faceless omega.
And the many more children he would make Draco beget in the near future.
His appearance had…startled him.
“I think it’s best if I leave now.”
“What?” Harry asked, smirking. “Did you think I spent my free time like Vlad the Impaler, staking the heads of petulant Omegas in the ground in front of my home?”
“What will become of him?” Hermione blurted, her eyes connecting with Kingsley’s.
. Draco tried to keep up, his teeth clumsily clacking against Harry’s as he tried to pour his own repressed desires into the messily perfect kiss.
Draco swallowed thickly, crumpling Harry’s shirt in his trembling hands. “I was just scared, Harry. I know there’s no excuse that I can give that will make up for my actions, but you have to know I was just—”
Draco gave a strained chuckle, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “This must be so off-putting…I’m sorry, Harry.”
Time passed.
Draco sat, bristling at being ordered around like a dog. He kept his eyes on Harry as he walked over and disappeared into a room at the back of the kitchen.
His best friend and co-worker at St. Mungo’s Hospital, Pansy Parkinson, sat at his kitchen table giving him a speculative look. Her raven hair was neatly plaited, her dark eyes narrowed. She had stopped by to check up on him and had been doing it more and more the past few months.
toy!”
"She won't be angry with you, Draco,” Harry said firmly. “Narcissa will understand why you chose not to tell her the truth. And keep in mind that I'm here with you. I'd never let anyone hurt you, not even your own family."
“I-I didn’t!” he spluttered. “You never told me I couldn’t go outside!”

Harry stood on his side of the bed, glaring down at him, his chest rising and falling with harsh breaths. “You can’t hide from me, pet. I can
There was a infinitesimal flicker of
“I’ll be in contact with you in the next few days. You may not want me in your life, Draco, but I
Harry reminded himself that he needed to take things
Harry nodded slowly. “I know, but ever since I met you and Scorpius, there’s been an undeniable pull, Draco. I want to be with you—I want to be with you
Draco shook his head, gathering up the remnants of crumbled eggs from his tiled kitchen floor. “They’re basically forcing it on me. I can understand their concern, but I really don’t think it’s necessary.”
His gaze shot up, finally meeting those unnerving emerald eyes.
What are you doing, Harry?
Thinking about the rabbit being harmed in anyway roused the protective predator within him. He felt like growling and baring his teeth, but he knew that would only frighten the rabbit further.
He couldn’t do anything to bring back Sirius, but he
Narcissa shook her head, her perfectly groomed hair not moving an inch with the motion. “No, no. He’s overly careful. He thinks it will mess with his breast milk supply. If you ask me, Scorpius needs to be weaned. He’s much too old to still be nursing.”
“I-It’s too much,” Draco stammered.
Draco came with a shuddering cry, ropes of semen shooting up, splattering against his swollen chest and Harry’s shirt.
Harry didn't even spare her a second glance as she left, having eyes only for Scorpius and Draco.
Their bond flared to life between them, like an electrical current. It was as natural as breathing and Draco regretted fighting his instinctual impulses when it came to Harry for so long.
(Jellybean is just her nickname. Name reveal in later chapters.)
His prick had been hard since his heat had started. The amount of pre-cum that had leaked from his slit and covered his cock had pooled at the base of his shaft, sliding down his bollocks and mixing with the warm slick coating his hole and inner thighs.
Draco opened his eyes, a slight tremble to his full lips as they parted. “I-It hurts,” he said softly.
Harry leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to Draco’s lips, pulling back to teasingly let his lips slide over Draco’s in a soft caress that had him taking a sharp inhale.
”Does that make it easier for you?” Harry asked coldly.
Harry paused.
Draco pulled against his restraints, pressing his chest upwards.
He wanted
“I’m glad, but your werewolf needs more kisses,” Harry mock growled, pressing playful kisses all over Scorpius’ cheeks and nose.
”No comment? Hmm.”
The moving photograph pinched between Draco’s fingers struck him mute.
“Thank you for having me, Narcissa,” Harry said, rubbing soothing circles onto Scorpius’ back. “They’re going as well as they can be. There’s a been an uptick in my caseload, but that’s to be expected. It’s the warmer months now, and we see an influx of magic misuse the most during that time.”
The insinuation was clear in Harry’s tone and Draco’s heart tripped, heat suffusing his cheeks as Harry pressed a quick kiss to his scent gland.
“So, they’re assigning someone to...look after you?”
,” he moaned.
Draco hugged himself. “Sorry, I’m just nervous. I’ve never…brought home a man before. Especially someone so…renowned.”
Harry Potter followed behind his best friend, Ron Weasley, down Knockturn Alley.
The sight of Draco’s small, pink hole had made Harry’s cock swiftly fill with blood, naturally reacting and readying to plunge into the Omega’s tight heat.
There would be plenty of times for the games Harry wanted to play when the boy was more coherent.
“Mum?”
“What is it, sweetheart?” he asked, lightly rubbing his lips against Draco’s and smiling when his Omega moaned softly.
Well, at least he didn’t have to worry about the Ministry’s backwards dealings anymore.
Harry’s gaze slid lower.
Harry nuzzled his nose against Draco’s, still rubbing teasing circles into the skin of his hips with his thumbs. “I want it too, Draco, but not like this. Not while you’re drunk.”
”I’m aware you’re not a horse, boy. One of my thoroughbreds would be much more behaved than you. And of a much better pedigree.”
Harry’s nostrils flared, a muscle jumping in his jaw. “Come now, pet. After you eat, you’re to go back to bed until your next heat.”
Draco knew his mother’s pregnancy with him had only worked because she had left his father late in the pregnancy. Potions containing his father’s own unique magic essence had attributed to his fetal growth in his mother’s last month of being pregnant with him. She had told him that there were many times she was scared she would lose him, but by some miracle he had survived.
Ron crossed his arms over his chest. “She had been living in a seaside town in France.
“Thank you,” Harry said gruffly.
It took a skilled witch or wizard to use
He took his slowly softening cock in his hand and aimed it down, releasing a torrent of his own piss. He sprayed a circle around the boy, wetting the sheets and blankets of his makeshift nest.
Dread curled his stomach, denial at the forefront of his mind.
Draco awoke with a heavy arm draped over him, his legs entangled with someone else’s under the sheets. He turned his head, his lips parting on a small, surprised exhale.
“Are you worried?” he asked, pressing his lips to Draco’s warm ear.
,” his prey whispered, his dulcet voice catching on the last word.
When Harry had seen the glistening slick coating Draco’s arse and inner thighs, he had released a low groan, his cock unbearably hard beneath his trousers.
Eat out his hole, lick up all of that sugary slick and then sink his aching cock into that delectable fluttering hole.
Draco had just stepped down from the carriage that had taken them through the moors.
It was of Draco.
Draco swallowed thickly, his inner Omega wailing with want at the sight of his Alpha’s cock, hard and ready for him.
Harry turned with Scorpius and grinned. “Good morning, sweetheart. We were just about done making breakfast for you.”
Draco visibly swallowed. “M-Mum is, Harry,” he stuttered.
“Oh, my birthday, of course. It must have slipped my mind. The further along I am, the more forgetful I am. I’m sorry, Hermione.”
—I can’t handle you pushing me away again. I can’t handle not seeing Scorpius or being with you both. It drove me mad not being able to be with you both these past few months and I need it to be
Arlen, the Healer who’d been assigned to monitor his pregnancy, stood behind him on the sidewalk.
Harry could hear his heartbeat in his own ears.
Draco jerked out of his arms, turning to glare up at him, unshed tears blurring his vision. “Just stay

Without taking another look back, he let out a deep sigh and followed McGonagall up the rest of the steps to the manor.
Draco pulled back to look up at him, startled.
Ron led Harry down to the bowels of the Ministry, to Level Ten beneath the Wizengamot Court Chambers.
He couldn’t be possibly deriving
His rabbit’s shoulders stiffened and he turned away, yanking down the hem of the overly large shirt over the top of his pale thighs.
Harry smirked, watching as a group of young witches and wizards stood in front of the booth, their youthful faces focused as one boy held his wand above the water, poised to shoot.
Had he ever smiled for Harry like that? He couldn’t remember. All of the sudden, he
And if he had gone out, the
He pulled back and smiled, seeing that Draco was smirking up at him. His mate looked sated, and it made possessive pride swell within Harry’s chest, knowing
They were wet, the pale swells sheening with breast milk. His pink nipples looked painfully engorged, steadily dripping milk. The droplets slid down Draco’s flat stomach before being absorbed by the waistband of his pyjama pants.
Draco choked when his cock hit the back of his throat, spittle escaping the sides of mouth and sluicing down the veins of Harry’s throbbing shaft.
He didn’t care if Draco cried, begged, or…
Draco looked up, blushing when he found Harry looking down at him intently.
“Scorpius is making a mess of your eggs,” Harry drawled, still not breaking their eye contact.
When he’d first entered the garden at Malfoy Manor, he hadn’t meant to sneak up on the boy.
Harry spilled the memory into the basin, Draco’s silvery siphoned memory mixing with the smoky clouds within the basin. Gritting his teeth, he plunged his head into the basin.
Draco’s breath hitched, squeezing Scorpius to his chest.
Draco felt an overwhelming need to go upstairs and get somewhere warm. Somewhere soft and

It was a total shock to him, and he had never been more turned on in his life by such a simple word coming from the lips of the person he wanted most.
without Harry to help him through his nightmares, or rub his belly until he fell asleep—
“Let him go, or I’ll call out for Mr. Potter.”

“Not my Alpha by
He wanted to establish trust with the little one and the only way to do that was to ease into things.
Potter chuckled darkly, but his eyes remained hard.
Draco hunched his shoulders defensively. “They say at my appointments that the baby is measuring okay…”
Sirius stopped talking for a moment, pinning Draco with his otherworldly, unnerving gaze.
“Um, if you’ll excuse me, Roland. My pup is becoming impatient.” He gave the man a sheepish smile and pointed to his stomach. “Be right back.”
Harry just stared down at him, his eyes becoming shuttered of all emotion. “Would it have been so bad to tell me the truth? To tell me that I was Scorpius’ father?”
“When I went to the manor, I found you inside and you were in the throes of your heat. I stayed with you until morning.”
They were left alone in Harry’s office. Draco was the first to break the silence.
Harry wanted to take everything, even if it meant there would be
”You’re in my home, well,
Kingsley and Ron were silent, confusion and surprise evident on their faces.
She was two years old, but didn’t speak. After his husband’s disappearance, she had stopped speaking completely.
“Will you at least come sit with me for a while? I can at least try to take your mind off of it.”
Draco tucked in, not caring if the eggs were overdone. In that moment, he felt nothing but happiness. For once in his life, he felt sure of his decision and of himself.
Hermione was not easily dissuaded and her current presence in front of him was evidence of that.
“I-I don’t know if we should do this,” he whispered, tilting his head to give Harry better access and belying his own words.

He was embarrassed to admit that the tiny swell of Draco’s lactating breast had made his cock stiffen.
The Ministry is doing everything in their power to find him and shirking their protection order is just immature.”
he was.
In truth, he pitied the person that would become the master’s mate.
He knew that if he fully gave in, Harry would give them the world. He would be a good Alpha, a good mate, a wonderful
“Do you need me to suck them?” he rasped, gently circling his sensitive breast with his long fingers and applying light pressure.
When Potter suddenly ripped down his trousers, exposing his backside to the cool air in the stable, his lips parted in shock.
His mother’s greeting made Draco tense and quickly pull away from Harry. He even scooted over, making sure their thighs weren’t touching.
Draco’s soft sighs and tiny moans seemed to plague him during his ruts, craving the sweet tang of the boy’s breast milk when he would wank himself.
. You just blink your pretty eyes and people trip over themselves to please you.”
Harry reached up with one hand and pinched Draco’s chin between his fingers, turning his head to face him. “Kiss me.
He dropped to his hands and knees before the boy’s spread thighs, laving Draco’s pink hole with his eager tongue.
The rabbit’s large eyes slid shut, purring contentedly as Harry continued to simultaneously scratch and lick.
The damage stretched from his hairline and down, disappearing into the collar of his black button-down. The right side of his lips were uneven, making him appear as if he were wearing a permanent scowl.
He had stayed up most of the night reading it, dread curling in his stomach the more he read.
They lapsed into silence, Harry averting Jack’s gaze to stare down at the envelope in his hand.
“Well,” Draco said, beginning to pull away from him, “you can tell Minister Shacklebolt that while I appreciate the gesture, I won’t be needing your services.”
“Cute. How old is he?”
, but all he felt in that moment was...
”Who is the boy’s father, Draco?”
Draco looked away, to the the grandfather clock whose face held a moving picture of him and Theo on their wedding day.
While taking Draco to the different shops, the boy had picked up a stuffed wolf from one of the display shelves. It had been a child’s toy, but it had obviously excited him.
Pansy stood and walked over to toss the eggs into the bin and went over to the basin to wash her hands. “Have you given any thought to the Alpha Interim Program?”
The female’s eyes narrowed to slits. “What? You can’t talk? Did they take your tongue?”
Even though they had their own lives with their own problems, they didn’t have to carry the burden that had stayed with him for the past eight years.
“Right,” Harry said dryly, pulling back slightly. “I know disgust when I see it, Draco. I’ve become quite familiar with looks of pity and horror, but above all,
Harry smiled, feeling possessive satisfaction that
“I’m his father.”
When he entered the kitchen, he halted.
me you would be good, but it seems like I made a mistake in trusting you enough to remove your collar.”
Harry pressed his cheek to the boy’s damp blond hair, caressing his rabbit’s arm with his claws and smiling when he shivered in response.
Draco shook his head again, pushing at Harry’s bare chest with one hand, his other arm still clutching his stuffed wolf.
“An old friend?” she asked, looking up at him.
He entered his bedroom, spotting his rabbit changing into one of his old t-shirts for bedtime.
Draco shivered when Harry guided one of his trembling hands between his thighs. Harry’s hand engulfed the boy’s small, slender fingers.
”Sorry, didn’t mean to frighten you.”
If Harry knotted him during his heat, he could get him
Draco gave a weak whimper, unable to repress it. “Listen—”
Hermione let out an unsteady chuckle, a soft, insistent ringing noise within her ears. “Y-you’re wrong, Ron. You’re talking about

Draco met Harry’s gaze, his tongue flicking out to lick his lower lip. “They don’t hurt anymore, but…”
be in my son’s.”
Harry wasn’t looking at him, but at his stomach. His jaw was clenched tightly beneath his skin. He was watching Arlen’s wand with an intense look in his green eyes. Almost as if…
They had sex too many times for Draco to count that night. Harry took him from the front each time, kissing him and kneading his breasts, making everything so tenderly—
He trusted her and had never been the jealous type in a relationship. Since Ginny was a Beta, they’d never be able to have children and that also didn’t bother Harry.
Draco was terribly aroused and terribly

bundle of blankets and sheets.
She sighed loudly. “Yes, but Rowan’s mum said we have to stop fighting with each other or we won’t be allowed to hang out anymore.”
Draco nodded, standing up. ”I promise I’ll be quick.”
He wished he could turn back time. He would tell her so many things he’d left unsaid, ask her the questions he would never be able to now.
As Harry carried him, he could feel his magic gathering inside of him, like a brewing storm because of his growing fear. He quickly tamped it back down, his jellybean’s continued kicks against his stomach reminding him of
Potter stepped forward and grabbed one of his hands, inspecting it with an indifferent expression.
The intimate act made Draco’s knees weak, his pup kicking a fluttering limbo within his belly that matched his heartbeat.
“Good,” he mumbled between kisses. “I
He had considered sending the boy flowers like some lovesick fool but had decided against it. He didn’t want to come off like some old creep, pining for the beautiful teenager who had spurned him.
Draco spread his legs wider with a whimper, Harry’s tongue slipping past the tight ring of muscles.
“Don’t worry about it, Roland. I’ll just run to the loo to clean up. My daughter spills things all the time, so I’m used to it.” Draco chuckled. “She managed to knock over an entire pitcher of lemonade to the floor the other day.”
Narcissa sighed again. “Hmm? Oh, yes. Draco is fine. His heat is upon him and we decided to give him some space until it’s over, so I took Scorpius for a few days.”
Even though Harry could resist Draco’s Omega pheromones, it didn’t lessen the violent yearning that snapped at his subconscious with a serrated maw and a tenacity that would almost bring him to his knees at times.
Draco averted the tall Alpha’s seeking eyes. “You don’t have to promise anything to me, Harry. You don’t owe anything to me. You can date whomever you want. I don’t care.”
Without another word, Harry pivoted on his heel and left the office, leaving a quietly sobbing Draco alone on the sofa.

Once he would realize that he was still being held captive, the weight of the collar around his neck would suddenly seem unbearable. It rested against his skin, making his flesh feel hot and itchy.
”I’m in no mood to argue, boy.”

He laid there alone on the bed; the room unbearably silent around him.
“Oh?” Harry sat at the kitchen table, unfolding the latest copy of the Prophet to peruse. “Well, that sounds lovely, Gin. How long will you be gone?”

“We’re doing perfectly fine by ourselves, Potter. I don’t need the Ministry to swoop in and play white knight and I certainly don’t need
you where you belong.”
He didn’t know the reason for his mother’s sudden insistence to send him away, but he knew he had to trust her.
“I-I want to, Harry. I’m just scared. I don’t know what their reaction will be and I’m afraid my father won’t take the news very well.”
Draco’s face felt hot, wondering which time that had been. Harry didn’t like when his family slept away from Grimmauld Place, but sometimes they needed to if Harry would be at the Ministry all day and night, working.
Lifting one of his hands, he let his fingers brush over the teeth marks on his neck, grinning.
Harry brought a glass of water, setting it down next to Draco’s plate. “Should I get juice for Scorpius?”
“Believe me, he’ll live,” he said dryly. “So, what did you bring me?” he asked, steering Draco towards the small sofa in his office.
With a muttered curse, Potter released him and stepped back.
“So, you use your
It seemed as if it rained all the time in the moors.
“I’m...focused on Scorpius right now,” he said softly, going back to packing his things.
Harry quickly crossed the room, pressing his nose to the nape of his rabbit’s neck and inhaling.
Draco was in heat. Draco was in heat and
,” Harry panted, giving a harsh thrust on the last word that had Draco crying out.
Without a word, Draco had abruptly left the table. Harry hadn’t tried to stop him, wanting to give him his space. The boy had been basically sold into slavery for carnivores and it was a fact that Harry had become uncomfortable with. His friends and co-workers showed disdain for herbivores and if they knew of Harry’s intimate interactions with his rabbit, they’d surely be disgusted.
Arlen shook his head, his eyes filled with remorse. “No. They transferred me to another floor after…well, you know.”
He fucked him at a languid pace, the head of his cock
Draco could only lay there limply with his legs spread as Harry brutally fucked into him.
Draco clenched his free hand into a fist at this side. “I can’t.”
A wolf’s ears were sensitive and they didn’t often allow bed partners to touch them.
Draco was silent for several moments before slowly nodding.
”Where did you find her?” Harry asked through gritted teeth.
Harry smirked, looking down at him. “Do you think if you say that word, I’ll concede to anything?”
”What is it?” Draco snapped, feeling self conscious again under Potter’s seeming scrutiny. “You act as if it’s the most bizarre thing you’ve ever seen, my stomach. Surprised someone wanted pups with the Malfoy brat?”
Oh, Salazar.
Draco ignored him, walking over to sit on the edge of the bed. “Just go away, Harry. I’m not in the mood for your capricious moods. I don’t feel well.”
She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest. “That was, like,
They lapsed into an awkward silence, staring at each other.
The words that had shamelessly poured from his lips in the memory seemed to blare, forbidden and excruciatingly erotic:
“May I ask why you applied for the AIP, Roland?” Draco pressed. “An alpha with a pedigree like yours, you probably have omegas banging down your door.”
Harry scoffed, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’re still the same. You haven’t changed at all. Still under Daddy’s thumb. Born into money and
A feeling of trickling despair was slowly settling in his stomach at the thought of this being his new…
Ron laughed and it echoed off the cobblestone streets and shops surrounding them.
Draco quickly got to his feet and tried to leave the room, but was stopped when Harry grabbed his upper arm, pulling him back against his hard chest.
Before Harry pulled back, he traced the seam of Draco’s lips with his tongue, collecting their shared saliva from their wet kiss.
He ran one hand over his bump, mulling over Pansy’s words.
His pheromones enveloped Draco, making his lids grow heavy. The tension he hadn’t known he’d been carrying began spilling from his body in relieving waves.
Draco twisted around on his haunches and looked up.
He had never touched one Galleon of it.
“But you wanted me to treat you as a lover, Draco. Who am I to deny my pregnant mate?”
It was utterly indecent for a man of his age and Draco was becoming achingly aware that his own white shirt was damp from the rain, the outline of his hard nipples visible beneath the thin fabric.
Soft and fragile, effeminate in appearance.
Omega.
Harry slowed, bending down to nuzzle at one of Draco’s nipples with his lips. “Missed your tits so much, baby. Missed
Harry’s gaze hardened before he ripped Draco’s arm away from his chest and held his wrist to the side, baring him.
But Harry’s eyes became suddenly devoid of all emotion, that indifferent mask slipping back into place.
It seemed like a lifetime ago…
“Oh, that must be an interesting job. Does she have much time off?”
Draco averted his gaze, staring at the floor instead. “It’s not like that, Harry, I just...we need to have set boundaries if we’re going to be...friends.”
Harry nodded solemnly. “The one and only. Someone had broken into their home but hadn’t taken anything.”
Harry’s mouth flooded with saliva, his fangs feeling tight against his gums in his mouth.
Harry made his way back to his office, entering it and closing the door behind him. He sat behind his desk, pulling a case file from the stack of unreviewed files on his desk. He got out a pen from his drawer, intending to start taking notes.
Harry felt sick. He wanted to vomit.
Looking at him now, Draco realized why.
Draco somehow instinctively knew what Harry was actually asking, the fucked up bond that had been forced upon him making the sinuous words whisper across his mind.
He knew they were past that now, but it still stung to think of the way he had treated Harry leading up to that pivotal moment.
“Mummy, up,
Once he hastily wrapped his scarf around his neck, he turned to give one last look at Harry. He was still sleeping, his hand pressed against the spot where Draco had been laying.
Draco’s ears burned with embarrassment, but he looked up, meeting Harry’s eyes. “I-I’ve been using your clothes, the ones I borrowed. They…smell like you, so I keep them with me during my heats.”
His callous words made Draco’s smile falter, his hands clenching into fists at his sides.
Draco planned to politely decline the Ministry’s security services and be on his way. He didn’t need a babysitter and he had too much on his plate right now to worry about someone constantly following him around.
They were both busy with their respective careers and weren’t in a rush to make things permanent yet, though.
Draco leaned forward and lightly pressed his lips to Harry’s jaw, his lids drifting closed and a soft sigh escaping him.

The Healer from St Mungo’s was a young man named Arlen. He had dark hair and warm brown eyes. Draco felt an intense urge to break down and tell the nice man everything Harry had been subjecting him to.
Harry looked
All he wanted was…
”Dada, Dada,
The sight of his claw-tipped hand against the boy’s porcelain skin made his stomach curl with pleasure, the predator within him urging him to take action.
Kingsley smiled. “I’m so happy to hear that, Harry. Good luck to you.”
“H-Harry,

, Harry, you’re not being fair…”
“Enough, pet.” Harry rammed his cock into Draco’s wet entrance, groaning.
“Well,” his mum finally said, “I deduced that you two were getting serious when you kept disappearing for days on end. Not to mention, the day Harry suddenly showed up at the manor out of the blue. I knew something was going on then.”
The little rabbit’s chest was rising and falling in quick pants, it’s lovely gray eyes not leaving Harry’s.
”Ah, ah,” Harry said, shaking his head. “No fingers, pet. It’s either me or the
”I’m quite sane, I assure you. Now, do as I say.”
Harry turned off the oven and began rummaging around one of the kitchen cabinets. “She’s a sports editor for the Daily Prophet.”
Slowly, the rabbit’s breathing calmed to a normal rhythm, his head still buried in Harry’s elbow.
, a person who was wholly innocent in all of this would be caught in the middle of some scandal because he wasn’t strong enough to set boundaries when it came to Harry Potter.
Please forgive me for taking
“Okay,” Draco said softly, tightening his fingers around the material of his jumper to hide their trembling.
Draco opened his eyes, sitting up on the sofa and turning to look at Harry.
Harry was sitting on his sofa, bent over reading something in his lap.
There was no doubt to who his Alpha was.
Before Harry could finish his question, Draco was already pulling him towards the stairs.
He would tell Narcissa about everything he had made Draco suffer through, and then to really lay the killing blow, he would show her pictures of her grandchild. He would delight in telling the wretch how he was the father and
Potter brought the riding crop up to his gloved hand, letting the flat leather tip slide through his fingers with an indolent air that had Draco swallowing nervously.
It was like a slap to his pride.
,” he whispered. “I’ll go with you.”
For a carnivore to commit sexual acts with an herbivore was forbidden. Taboo. Not only that, if a carnivore and herbivore were to procreate, it would surely end in demise.
He made sure to give the same attention to the other nipple, hollowing his cheeks and giving it a harsh suck before pulling back slightly.
Draco clumsily clambered onto Harry’s lap, straddling him.
He regretted his words as soon as they left his lips, seeing the way something shattered in Harry’s green eyes. He composed his face before Draco could apologize, a barrier seeming to slide down between them.
They had come to meet with his mother and finally tell her the truth.
”Dada, no,” the boy said weakly, his body belying his words as slick poured from the boy’s hole. It dribbled down the back of Draco’s thighs and the front of Harry’s, making their connecting skin tacky.
boy. He’s never hurt anyone. If you must kill me, so be it, but don’t take out your anger on Draco. He’s done nothing to deserve it. Please don’t hurt…my grandchild.”
He realized it was his
He suddenly didn’t give a fuck if anyone walked in on them. There was no turning back for him now. All he wanted was his Omega. All he wanted was
She scoffed. “Whatever. My name is
Draco smiled and looked at the sliding glass door leading outside, at the clear blue sky and his potted fern still sitting on the balcony.
Draco flushed, his eyes appearing glassy as he gazed at his reflection.
Harry’s head snapped to the side, his gaze furious. “I said,” he bit out, “do
“Running away again?”
Draco giggled softly, clutching his pup tighter.
Scorpius slapped one pudgy hand against Draco’s chest, nuzzling into his scent gland on his throat. “Mummy, milk?”
Draco’s father had been disappointed that he had presented as an omega at an early age. He knew his father had wanted an alpha son to carry on their family name and his mother’s inability to give Lucius what he wanted had resulted in their slowly deteriorating marriage.
Draco had pointed to it and then to Harry, his white ears twitching excitedly. In the end, Harry had been unable to deny him. He had bought it for his rabbit and had allowed the boy to pick out his preferred foods from the herbivore market.
Draco was used to the finer things in life. His father’s amassed fortune had earned them a comfortable life in Wiltshire, and he was quickly beginning to realize that his posh lifestyle would be a thing of the past while under employment at Potter Manor.
The alpha was much stronger than Draco and he couldn’t hold back a soft whimper as Potter squeezed him in warning.
attitude. She didn’t like when things didn’t go her way and was often stubborn if she thought she was right about something.
The boy shook his head, hugging himself.
Harry nodded, giving her a small smile in return. “I won’t. Thank you, Hermione.”
Alpha who always tried to keep Draco happy.
Before he could even react, Potter had stormed across the dirt floor of the stables and had Draco’s upper arm in his punishing gloved grasp.
Draco furrowed his brows.
Jack grinned, a playful glint in his eyes when he looked at Harry. “That would be lovely, Draco. You know, I prefer chocolate chip cookies, so if you could—”
When he’d given birth at St Mungo’s in secret, all of the Healers had never ceased complimenting what a beautiful baby he was.
His rabbit mewled softly, his long ears splayed out.
Harry sunk his finger deeper, his heart tightening when his sweetheart cried out in pain.
“It’s none of your business,” he replied weakly. “Just go back to whatever else you were doing before being assigned as my devoted stalker.”
Harry ripped himself from Draco’s spilled memory, stumbling backwards, his breath sawing from his lungs.

”Feels s-so good,” Draco moaned softly, out of his mind with his heat and Harry’s cum filling his arse and womb.
Sentenced.
He adjusted his hold on the Daily Prophet, narrowing his eyes at the headline.
“I love you.”
Every time he was cruel to Draco, it was going against his nature as an Alpha. He was meant to protect and adore his Omega, not abuse and berate him. The only times he could get his mind to quiet was when he was
After about ten minutes, a knock on his office door had him glancing up.
They probably looked mental, dopily grinning at each other in that moment. Scorpius was playing in his overdone eggs with his hands, blissfully unaware that his parents were hopelessly in love with each other.
“What are you doing?” she asked, eyeing him from above.
Some of the doors on his floor were locked, but some weren’t. One bedroom had coverings over all of the furniture, even on the lone portrait in the room. He uncovered some of the furniture, quickly realizing that the room must have belonged to a child or young adult, evidenced by some the more juvenile toys and magical baubles hidden within the dresser drawers.
For his baby.
She worried her lower lip between her teeth in an uncharacteristic show of unease before saying, “We have to tell your father.”
He glanced up at the Healer, who was smiling warmly at them.
“I’m sure Harry’s excited about the arrival of your pup, too. Before Rose was born, Ron was so anxious. He didn’t think he would be a good father. Of course, we never thought we would have a child before I became pregnant. We tried for so many years and it never happened. Ron was becoming distant and I felt inadequate as an Omega. Ron didn’t blame me of course, but it was just something we wanted so badly that it began to cloud our minds with negativity when it didn’t happen right away.”
Harry didn’t really have any urgency to reproduce or find a mate. He was perfectly content with the way things were and preferred for life to be calm rather than chaotic.
“Have you been stressed recently, Draco?” Arlen asked.
Draco’s mouth with his own. Their combined pheromones saturated the air around them, making Draco begin to dazedly rock his hips against Harry’s erection, seeking friction.
Tears pricked her eyes, a shuddering breath escaping her.
He realized that Harry hadn’t knotted him. He was glad because he didn’t know if he could stand to be connected to him longer than necessary. Reality suddenly came crashing down with that thought, Harry’s cum slowly leaking out of Draco, mixing with his slick and coating the sheets beneath his hips.
Draco, for some inane reason, blushed. “I-I need an alpha, Potter.” He let out a tired sigh. “It’s getting harder the bigger my pup grows.”
again.” Harry pinched the boy’s chin between his fingers, angling his head up to look him in the eyes. “Do you hear me, sweetheart?”
She had lost her best friend, just as Draco had lost his innocence.
Draco’s scent during his heat was almost cloyingly intoxicating.
Harry was an enigma to Draco.
During the trial, the media had been a nightmare for Draco.
Draco quickly wiped at some of the errant tears that had slid down his cheeks, sniffling softly.
“Do you fantasize about your imaginary man like this, fucking you slowly?”
, wet hole.
Due to Voldemort’s influence, herbivores had began being treated like...well,
Harry reached forward and grabbed his wrist, yanking him down. Draco fell unceremoniously atop his lap, his breath hitching when Harry slid his hand up the back of his navy jumper.
Harry carried the boy to his adjoining bathroom. He gently set the boy on his feet and began preparing the tub. Once the large porcelain tub had filled halfway with warm water, he stripped out of his formal clothes.
”You can change back whenever you feel comfortable enough to do so, sweetheart. Dada won’t hurt you.”
His own need for revenge had held him back.

?” Draco pressed.
Draco gave him a lopsided smile, pressing closer to him. “Is it working?”
Hermione nodded solemnly, pain mirroring Draco’s own within the depths of her umber eyes. It was a different kind of pain, but pain, nonetheless. Hermione had never gotten over what her old friend had done to him.
Draco nodded while adjusting Scorpius on his lap. “Yes, he prefers breast milk, but now that he’s getting older, I thought it would be best to try to wean. I don’t
Harry smiled fondly at the pup. “Thank you for the advice,” he whispered wryly.
Harry swallowed thickly at the sight before him.
A dribble of milk fell from Scorpius’ parted lips before he began mouthing unconsciously at Draco’s nipple again, seeking comfort.
Draco shook his head, averting Harry’s gaze. “It’s all right. I’m trying to wean him and he just feeds for comfort rather than hunger. It’s hard on both of us...” he trailed off, realizing that he was babbling.
The phial that had held Draco’s memory was still clutched in his other hand.
He angled his thrusts, knowing when he was hitting the boy’s prostate by how loudly he began to moan and writhe beneath him.
He looked like he was on his way to work, a messenger bag slung haphazardly over his shoulder. He hadn’t changed much in the intervening years. His brown eyes were still warm, albeit his hair was now shorter, like his own.
And into Draco’s memory.
Arlen nodded, putting his wand back in his bag. “That’s a common early pregnancy symptom. I recommend you spend time with your Alpha for the next few weeks. Physical contact with your Alpha can strengthen your pup in the womb.”
Unlike Draco’s.
“What’s wrong? You look…troubled.”
Harry suddenly stood, making Draco sit forward in surprise.
Harry let out an involuntary growl, the fingers of his free hand clenching into a fist atop his thigh.
would turn out.
Unbidden, a low growl emanated from the back of his throat.
“Let me hear you, Draco,” Harry rasped between thrusts, “tell me how much you
Harry made his way to his bedroom, stopping at the closed bedroom door. He paused, perking up his ears in attempt to listen. The sound of Draco’s panting breaths met his ears, making him throw open the door.
Draco could smell his Alpha pheromones, musky and strong in the air around them even though they were outdoors.
She parted some of the fern’s leaves with her hands, her heart-shaped face framed by green. It made the flecks of gold in her emerald eyes more apparent, the sunlight gleaming off of her long raven hair. The faint freckles that dotted her nose and cheeks were also made more discernible by the sunlight, like scattered constellations on her olive skin.
Ever since Kingsley had abolished Dementors from guarding Azkaban, the Aurors he’d assigned for watch duty at prison were specially chosen based upon their experience and skills. The decision had been voted on in the Wizengamot, but several people
Draco’s face suffused with heat, mortified when his prick began hardening beneath his trousers.
He felt Harry spear him with his tongue, lapping up their combined juices and pulling back to press sweet kisses to his inner thighs.
Harry watched him, his brows drawing together as the silence stretched.
Harry had just been barely able to stop himself from lapping at the boy’s reddened wrists, getting a hold of himself just before his tongue could touch the irritated skin.
Arlen nodded distractedly, rolling up Draco’s shirt to press a hand against his lower stomach. “You could say that. People who aligned with the wrong beliefs, lost souls, what have you.”
The room went silent, the sound of Scorpius’ soft snoring the only sound to be heard.
The mating mark on the graceful column of his throat stood out, Harry’s teeth marks silvered against his fair skin. He could remember when he had made that mark, how Draco had begged him to
When his lips brushed against the side of Harry’s throat, a soft whine escaped Draco. It was pure instincts controlling him now. He wanted to be held and cared for as an Omega should be by his Alpha.
“Oh, we found him. He made a trip to Azkaban yesterday,” Kingsley said.
Harry let out an amused huff of air. “So responsive. I haven’t even touched you yet and your body already knows who the one in control is.”
Harry shook away the strange direction of his thoughts, focusing on the now.

He pulled the envelope from his pocket and slid it across the table until it rested in front of Hermione.
But he had to
He jumped when he heard a pained roar behind the door, something crashing against the closed door from the other side.
Alpha fucking someone else—
Harry winced inwardly.
anytime you want, I’d never stop you, so why are so insistent that I don’t touch
Harry only stared at him with that infuriating indifferent expression.
Harry swallowed thickly, his eyes hungrily taking in Draco’s nude form.
When he’d emptied himself of his mate, he gently pulled out. Draco was panting beneath him, covered in his own cum. He watched, transfixed as his own cum slowly leaked out of Draco’s hole along with the boy’s clear slick.
With Draco’s abuse publicized along with his mother’s escape from Azkaban, he’d been hounded by reporters day and night. It had all been too much for him at the time. He’d been a new mother with a newborn, but that hadn’t deterred people from trying to snap a photo of him whenever he was outside.
“Oh, hello again, Mr. Potter,” she greeted stiffly.
Draco had begun having nightmares. He knew it was due to his captivity and concern over his growing pup.
The boy grabbed the hem of his shirt, twisting it in his small hands nervously, shaking his head. His face was flushed, his ears totally flat against the back of his head.

Harry only smiled, his gaze patient. “I’m head of the Auror Department at the Ministry. When we were made aware of Malfoy Manor being broken into, I volunteered to come out and have a look myself. Your father is a bit of a celebrity himself, Draco.”

love him. He’s been spoiled since the day he was born. I know that doesn’t make up for anything, but it’s true. He’s always been loved by us—even by my father.”
“Harry, Omegas are in short supply right now. While any information pertaining to Narcissa’s past or current involvement as a Death Eater is important to the Ministry, a healthy Omega of breeding age is considered
Harry slowly made his way around the bed, his gait predatory.
He studied the ornery little thing, wondering when he would be comfortable enough to change back to his half-human form.
Draco’s cheeks heated as he bounced a giggling Scorpius on his leg.
“You smell like that dolt out there,” he said gruffly. “Why didn’t you tell me you were experiencing discomfort?”
Harry placed both of large hands on the boy’s narrow hips, sinking his claws into the soft, pale skin.
He pulled back, instant regret washing over him.
She gave him a one-armed hug, pressing a chaste kiss to cheek.
“We should go to the kitchen. I need to get things ready,” he said gruffly, not looking at Draco anymore.
He climbed over Draco on the bed, placing both his hands on either side of his head, bracketing him. Harry’s heavy erection bobbed between his legs, sliding against Draco’s inner thigh and smearing his pre-cum along his skin.
“April ninth.”
“Please, Draco. Call me Harry. I’d say we’re on a first-name basis now, aren’t we? I mean, I’ve pretended to be a werewolf for your son, so that makes us basically family now.” Harry paused, acting as if he were deep in thought. “Or would that make us
Draco hugged himself, his heart feeling as it were caving in on itself. “Loved? Past tense?” he asked hoarsely.
Narcissa had stopped pacing and was staring down at them both with warm eyes.
Draco threw his arms around Harry’s neck and pressed his mouth to his, moaning.
His room back at Wiltshire had been decorated with his own art and he loved painting floral pieces and serene depictions of nature. The bare white walls in his room now only served as a reminder of what he was homesick for.
Though Draco had been bringing Scorpius over every night, Harry wanted them to
“I’ve never seen him so angry,” Pansy whispered, her fingers tightening around Draco’s shoulders.
When this was all over, he would go see a mind healer. He could—

“Well, I’ll need to stop by the manor to get Scorpius’ clothes and some extra nappies…I feel like I’m being such a nuisance already.”
, isn’t it, my little love?”
, pet. Now fuck yourself with it.”
And for the first time in eight months, he let loose a scream that he felt he’d been holding in since his capture.
Draco’s smile faltered. “I’ll—I’ll clean it up.”
Draco pursed his lips, glaring at him.
Draco wilted inside. Had he already been found out?
and mortification. If Harry had taken advantage of him in such a state…
Tears slipped down Narcissa’s dirt-smudged cheeks, her manacled hands shaking. “Then look into my memories. You will see that you are

It was quiet for a moment behind him before he heard his door shut.
A muscle jumped in the man’s jaw. “Do you make a habit of questioning your employers when they give you a direct order?”

“Your next heat, I’m stuffing your hole full of my knot. Coming in you until you’re
“I won’t fuck you yet, baby, but I
me, Harry,” Draco said shakily.
In the beginning, part of him had wanted to travel to Gringotts and set fire to the vault, but what would that help in the grand scheme of things?
And he looked…
Draco abruptly pulled away, protectively hugging himself. “Like I said before, I won’t be needing the Ministry’s services,” he said stiltedly. “You can go tell Kingsley that, Potter.”
Draco’s heart felt full, knowing that Harry would always put them first.
“Haven’t you ever scrubbed a floor before?”
He closed the distance between them and stuck out his hand in offering.
, love. You don’t send a torrent of water shooting down on a helpless Muggle boy.”
when he’d tried to kiss his one of his long ears.
”Tomorrow,” Harry promised.
“What is it, sweetheart?” Harry rasped, unwinding Draco’s scarf from his neck and pressing open-mouthed kisses to his ear and throat.
”Stop being a caterwauling brat and

“I-I have to sit down, Ron,” she whispered hollowly, swaying on her feet.
Draco quickly began cutting up Scorpius’ pancakes, averting Harry’s gaze. “S-sorry, Harry, it just slipped out. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable—”
“Well, I
He cupped the boy under his armpits, dragging him up his chest.
His stomach rebelled at the sudden motion and he was already regretting his choice to drink the night before. He absentmindedly reached for Scorpius to nurse him, like they usually did in their morning ritual. When his hand met an empty space on the sheets, he sat up.
Draco chuckled softly. “You’re right. I’m sorry, Blaise. Want me to get us something hot to drink?”
—he knew what he had already chosen.
There was a slight tremble to her bound hands that laid in her lap.
Oh, if only he knew the truth.
His belt buckle was also slapping against the pale curve of one of Draco’s cheeks and Harry knew it would probably leave welts with how hard he was fucking him, but he couldn’t stop.
The office was covered in Harry’s scent, and Draco found himself drawn to it.
It all felt so…
He could imagine Draco, alone and writhing in pain. He would need an Alpha to alleviate his heat pains, he would need—
Draco was in desperate need of a shower, his long, sweat-dampened hair consistently falling into his eyes. He wondered if the bastard would be kind enough to give him a hair tie, but Harry would probably think he’d use it asphyxiate him somehow.

Harry lowered his hand from his cheek and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling it up to press it against his own stubbled cheek. “It doesn’t have to be hard, sweetheart. You can touch
, Draco. My cock reacted to your desperate little Omega pheromones. I’ve been fucking hard all day, wanting to sink my prick into that wet, sugary smelling hole.”
With that, Harry waved a hand and snuffed out all light from the room. He turned and strode from the bedroom, slamming the door behind him and leaving Draco quietly sobbing in the pitch black.
That was why he had to do this.
Harry repeated the same process for Draco’s other leaking nipple, taking more time than necessary coating the swollen bud.
He felt achingly
“Come now, sweetheart. Let’s get you something to eat and find you some clothes.”
Their faces were mere centimeters apart. He glared up at him, pure hatred burning in his chest for the man looming over him.
Draco held his breath and slowly lowered his head towards Harry’s, making sure his lips were sealed shut.
Harry reached under his shirt, cupping his swollen chest. “I can worship your body, Draco…”
His Omega was in
The boy nodded and pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s hand. “I want more...” he sighed.

Draco lobbed the candleholder at Harry and sprinted towards the door.
“Thank you, Sirius,” he whispered, the room once again achingly quiet.
His eyes flickered down to where Draco was clutching his belly with his left hand, his attention on the wedding band that still encircled his finger. His features tightened.

Draco startled, hiding a small bouquet of red carnations behind his back as if they didn’t exist.

Separate was better, for
His parents would approve.
Draco gritted his teeth and threw his head back against the mattress, trying to adjust to Harry’s huge cock inside of him.
The taste of his Alpha’s fluids made desire unfurl low in stomach, his prick hardening between his legs.
Harry leaned against the wall next to the cell door, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ve come with the intent of relaying good news.”
“I’ll just be another minute, love,” Draco reassured softly, adjusting Scorpius in his arms.
“Well, it’s a bit of a sore spot for Harry, but—”
Draco nervously cleared his throat and walked into the room, stopping just in front of the desk and imposing man.
He knew that his parents were only worried about his wellbeing, but he wasn’t one to lie down and admit defeat.
“I just want to get through this ridiculous meeting, Pansy. I’ll worry about my other problems tomorrow.”
“It will be all right, baby,” Harry reassured. “I’ll be there with you when we tell him. I’d never let him hurt you.”
Harry didn’t hesitate.
He looked like an angel.
Draco wished Harry had been ugly.
“Erm, I guess we can work on names later,” Harry said dryly, clutching Scorpius closer.
It was a picture of his parents.
“I’m sorry, but when did you become my
“Harry, you’ve been chain smoking and I’m pretty sure you’ve been wearing the same shirt for the past week. You’re my best friend and I can tell when something is troubling you.”

Harry allowed their visits, checking in on them every so often when she did come to visit. He kept his collar hidden from view with collared shirts per Harry's instruction. Draco knew that he wasn’t supposed to talk about their relationship or how Harry

All the while, Harry watched him with those cold, detached emerald eyes.

His mother had let him know as much. His mother had also told him that Omegas were rare, a gift to be treasured by the wizarding community. She had told him that many would vie for his affections, but only a worthy Alpha would be able to persuade him to mate for life.
“So that leaves only two viable possibilities: you’re lying to me about who you really are, or you’re lying about what profession you held before this one.”
Draco gritted his teeth and turned his head, sinking his teeth into the fleshy part of his outstretched bicep. The needed pain made the heat momentarily abate and Draco whimpered with temporary relief, digging his heels into the bed.
”There will be no others but
“Do you miss it?” Ginny asked, stepping closer to him as they walked.
And who was still
He squeezed Scorpius against his chest, breathing in the smell of pancake batter and Harry’s own unique scent from his hair. “I don’t want to interfere with your job, Harry…”
Draco raised his hands, wrapping his fingers around Harry’s wrists. “Please, Harry, I didn’t—"

The rabbit’s cheeks were crimson, his shoulders hunched defensively. He shook his head again.
about what happened, if anything.”
He sped up his thrusts, slamming into the boy’s wet hole with feral urgency. While he fucked, he lapped at the boy’s ear, his eyes rolling back at the taste of his rabbit’s delectable blood.
After much trepidation, he had first tested his metaphorical leash by exploring the floor his bedroom was on.
Hermione eyed him curiously. “You’ve always been good with children. Patient, I mean. That’s usually a skill acquired
Harry leaned forward, brushing his parted lips against his ear. “You would beg for it, Draco. I took you for hours sometimes, until we were both covered in your slick and my cum. You weren’t satisfied unless your hole was dripping, filled to the brim with
Draco flushed and gave him a shy smile back. “It’s all right, Mr. Potter. Please don’t think you have to accommodate because of us. We’re already putting you out as it is.”
pets you own. The rarer, the better.”
Harry was dressed in all black, looking stark against the pristine white backdrop of the large bathroom.
“That won’t do,” Harry mumbled.
Maybe he would always feel owned by him. Maybe something inside of him had been irrevocably bound to Harry, indelibly branded on his very soul.
“S-sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going—”
He watched as Harry’s gaze darkened, a promise of what was to come.
Now that he was standing in front of him, the scent of whiskey and alpha pheromones entered his nostrils, muddling his sense of awareness and making his body feel...
He shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers, not trusting himself enough to not run over to them and gather them both into his arms, unwilling to let them go.
Draco placed his hand over Harry’s, stilling it. “It’s wrong, Harry, we shouldn’t…”
Harry straightened from his relaxed posture against the wall. He walked over to Narcissa and got to his haunches in front of her.
“Fine,” Harry said stiffly, pulling out of Draco. “Stay on the edge for the rest of the night. You need to come, lest you harm our pup with your stress. I won’t fuck you tonight and I won’t transfer my magic as a punishment. Perhaps your imaginary Alpha can keep you company during your nightmares tonight.”

Harry narrowed his eyes. “An Alpha who loves you, is that it?” he asked wryly. “What, fucking you on your hands and knees each night isn’t enough? You want
His magic flared because of his fear and arousal, making the collar around his throat almost unbearably hot against his skin.
The years had been kind to her. When she smiled back, the skin next to her eyes creased, but her heart-shaped face looked unchanged from when they had first met. The warm sunlight highlighted one or two threads of silver in her chestnut curls, her brown eyes lightened to an almost whiskey color.
He wanted to give the boy some space, but he worried about him and his pup day and night.
“I understand, Kingsley. Draco will be
Without putting anymore thought into the matter, he stuck out his elongated tongue and started to lick behind the rabbit’s ears.
It often bothered him, what was happening between them.
"Child of..." Harry cast him a dubious look. "Narcissa had no children when she fled after the war. At least not any documented. I would know."
to be honest, Harry! I just was afraid of your reaction and I wanted to be strong enough to do things on my own.”
The head of Draco’s prick glistened with pre-cum, the sparse blond curls that encircled the base of his shaft, damp.
“L-like you’re even capable of love. I want to get
“What do
.” Harry released one of his wrists and flicked his fingers, the envelope he had given Hermione appearing between them.
To his left, a chestnut-colored mare was poking her head over the edge of her stall. He set the wrapped lunch on a nearby bale of hay and cautiously approached the mare, giving her a small smile.
“Ow,” Harry groused in mock pain. “You’re hurting the werewolf, sweetie,” Harry said, chuckling softly when Scorpius immediately released his hair.

e’ had Draco flushing, his lips quirking up into a helpless smile.
Draco grinned, placing his hand overtop Arlen’s on his stomach. “That’s funny. They usually only do that when Harry is touching my stomach. Must be restless today.”
He shook off his morose thoughts, returning to the present.
He was just so bloody…
“Do you want me to suck on them, baby?” Harry asked in a gravelly whisper, his voice unrecognizable to even him.

taller than him even eleven years later. The top of Draco’s head only reached his broad chest.
“Won’t you talk to Dada? I acted out of line. I assumed when I should have talked to you first. Won’t you look at me, baby? Won’t you look at Dada?”
Draco flushed, trying to squirm away. “I-I guess. It’s better than being naked,” he murmured.
He knew he had to have an Alpha around the farther along he became in pregnancy, but it felt like a betrayal to Theo.
Thump, thump,
Draco nodded mutely, holding Scorpius tight. “I-I know what I did was wrong, Harry, but you have to understand
“I am excited. I can’t wait to see…my baby,” he said softly, a warm feeling unfurling inside of him at the thought of his jellybean in his arms.
“Curious little thing, aren’t you?” The person whispered into one of his ears.
Draco looked up at him, a blush covering his nose and cheeks. “
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Joke about it all you like, but your husband is still missing if you’ve forgotten
It had been three days since the Healer had visited and Harry had kept to his promise.
Draco shook his head, pursing his lips until Harry took it away. “N-no! No potions, no
As soon as Harry entered, he could
Unable to stop himself, Harry leaned down and pressed his nose to Draco’s soft hair, deeply inhaling. When that wasn’t enough, Harry lowered his head and stuck out his tongue, flattening it against Draco’s scent gland on his neck.
It was too much.
“Yes, sweetheart?” he murmured, nuzzling his nose against the boy’s soft ears, playfully nipping at them. “Tell dada, tell me.”
Scorpius let out a tiny growl, an adorable furrow appearing between his blond brows.
”Wait—
. If you weren’t so short, sweetheart, I could—"
Harry paused, arching a brow. “That’s awfully young to begin getting your heat.”
, let’s talk about this.”
“Can’t you talk, little one?” Harry asked, pulling him closer.
The cold realization made him inwardly flinch.
Scorpius had been born with hair like his, so blond it was almost white. That was where the similarities ended, however. His skin was an olive tone and his eyes a bright green color, like freshly dewed moss in the early morning.
“Sure, let me just…” Draco shifted, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed.
have sex. Your breasts were so swollen, and you refused to take any potions or suppressants. I couldn’t stand to see you in such pain.”
Draco swallowed nervously, holding the carnations to his chest. “Fifth floor.”
One night, after they were lying in the bed in silence after having sex, Draco had scooted closer to him. He didn’t know what had possessed him in that moment, but he had just felt the overwhelming need to
”I don’t belong to anyone,” Draco said softly, his lids lowering as Potter’s pheromones overtook him again in those thickening waves.
!” Draco cried out, trying to adjust to the sudden intrusion.
“I was thinking that after we eat with Ron and Hermione and the kids, we could go back to your place. We could pick up a bottle of wine and just…talk. Nothing serious.”
He smiled down at his pup, gently pulling him back.
But it would never be. Draco didn’t
that sent the gravel beneath his feet flying in different directions.
No but for real, thank you for all your feedback. Love hearing your thoughts. 🖤
“But for a person to
The rabbit had begun shrilly squeaking and wildly writhing in his arms when Harry had tried lowering him into the tepid bath water.
“Your eggs!” Draco shouted, pointing to the now burning eggs on the skillet.
Harry sighed, straightening his black jumper.
for Harry.
Maybe that had been too direct of a question. Perhaps Draco and his Alpha were going through a rough patch.
Draco dropped his head forward, pressing his clammy forehead to the prickly hay.
Angrily flipping back the covers, he swung his legs over the side of the bed. When he stood, he noticed that he was wearing an overly large dress shirt and nothing else. He reached under the collar, gingerly prodding his small breasts with his fingers.
...” Harry said hoarsely.
At almost six months pregnant, Draco could
“I’m not ashamed of how I look, Draco. What you see is what you get. If someone can’t accept my scars, they aren’t worth my time.”
Harry couldn’t help grinning. “You brought me
“It wasn’t deception!” he hissed. “I just—I couldn’t tell you the truth. Things became…
Draco’s sore breasts were rubbing against the edge of seat cushion between Harry’s legs, colostrum leaking from the tips due to Harry’s rough stimulation of them in the bathroom.
with his seed, ensuring pregnancy.
It was worse than anything Harry could physically torture him with and that’s when Draco snapped, his instincts screaming with rejection from his Alpha.
Draco shot her a grateful smile, feeling thankfulness warm his chest when she returned it.
Draco knew that he had stolen time from Harry and Scorpius to bond as father and son, and he felt awful about it.
She was a Beta.
Harry dug the short nail of his index finger into the arm of his chair, twisting it until it dented the wood, forming a crescent-shaped laceration.
Ron had known the chances of conception and hadn’t wanted to take any risks. Hermione had ended up carrying Rose to full term, but the nine months she’d been pregnant had been stressful on her, mentally and physically.
“Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s rude to scent someone without their permission?”
When the boy’s gaze connected with Harry’s, he gave him a coy smile. “
Draco intentionally raised his hand and scratched his neck, dangerously close to his hidden collar.
“You learn fast,” Master Potter said wryly. “
Could he ever forgive her for being so naïve, so trusting, so
Draco sat up, pulling his legs up and wrapping his arms around his knees protectively. “W-what do you want? It’s the middle of the night.”
He quietly observed his surroundings from under his lashes, mapping out any escape routes if the chance was provided to him.
What would happen if he did? Would the Healer report Harry to the Ministry? Would he be able to go back to Collioure?
in this fic. Hehe.
Harry was
Draco felt sick, the jabbing pain in his back coming back with a vengeance. His knees gave out, falling to them before Harry. He reached up, grabbing two fistfuls of his shirt.
”Harry,” Draco whispered, reaching up and cupping his jaw. His let his thumb linger against the curve of Harry’s lips, watching him visibly swallow. “What are you trying to tell—“
”Just standard procedure. Your mother informed us that the wards were taken down. It would take quite a skilled witch or wizard to do that. Your mother also told us that the wards your father put in place should have been basically impenetrable.”
While his mind was set on revenge, his heart was a different thing entirely.
“Ah, here it is. Sorry for the wait. Can you lift up your jumper for me, Draco?”
Guilt suddenly curled his stomach, making him clench his hands into fists at his sides.
“It’s charming in its own way,” Draco croaked.
”I’m waiting, Draco.”
Harry to stay. When you were left with nothing but silence and your own thoughts, you began to crave any kind of human interaction. Even if that human interaction was with someone you loathed.
Draco cringed inwardly.
As he grew bigger, he resembled Harry more and more.
Hope.
anything for my baby!”
When his tongue met the boy’s wet hole, he couldn’t stop. He raised one hand to spread the boy’s cleft, almost shifting at the sight of his cute, pink hole as it contracted before his rapt gaze.
The beast inside of him howled with despair at the thought of only taking Draco
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, leaning into his touch. Pain was etched across his handsome features, his jaw clenched tight.
The rabbit dug his paws into his bedspread, stubbornly clinging on.
“So sweet for Dada, my
”We—we
Kreacher nodded solemnly. “As you wish, Master Harry.” The house-elf disappeared.
“Don’t you recognize me, baby? You’ve been sleeping with me for the past two weeks. Dada would never hurt you; I promise.”
Harry’s cock twitched in his trousers.
Harry silently followed him back downstairs. As soon as they entered his father’s study, Harry whirled on him. He backed Draco up against the closed door, slamming a hand next to his head and leaning down.

“Oh, baby, so
“Don’t worry, I don’t bite, Draco,” Harry teased, giving him another cheeky wink.
Harry brushed his lips against Draco’s nape. “Tell me again in the morning. Tell me you want me, that you want

Harry snapped his fingers and pointed to the dildo. “Stop staring. This is what you wanted, remember? Show me how you used to use one when you were in heat. I’m curious now, Draco.”
“Well,” he said coldly. “If everything that’s happened between us has been nothing but a

It had to
Draco glared down at him. Harry was staring at Scorpius, a furrow between his dark brows. It looked as if he was trying to work something out in his head.
Draco had acted like he was sleeping. Harry had stood at the foot of the bed, silently watching him. He had felt Harry’s eyes boring into him from above, his skin prickling with awareness.
, he—”
Draco smiled and carried Scorpius to the kitchen table, sitting down and placing Scorpius on his lap.
“I know, Dad, but Harry is only doing his job. No one is, ugh,
Draco shook his head. “
Fuck, how he
Yes, it all sounded perfectly reasonable and sane when he thought of it that way.
“Every time I fuck you, you beg and plead for me to stop, but raise your hips in the air for more after each thrust. Is that how you’re able to live with yourself, Draco? By acting like you hate it?”
Draco turned and spotted a carrier of an eclectic mix of spices on the counter behind him. He grabbed them and scurried over to the girl’s side, setting them on the marble countertop next to her.
fault, Draco. It was my instincts. Seeing you in pain, I couldn’t help it. I know it’s not an excuse for my behavior, but please, consider staying here. You and Scorpius will be safe here.”
His mother scoffed. “Well, forgive me for being so blunt, Harry, but I’m not going to just leave you alone with my son until I know what’s going on.”
. Tell me, Draco. Promise me.”
His friends always reminded him that he was growing older. They wanted Harry to have pups of his own and some sweet Omega at home, waiting to suck his cock and take his knot.
It surprised him how much it...
They both reluctantly separated, desire evident in Harry’s smoldering gaze. “He wants your milk,” Harry rasped, slowly licking his lower lip with his tongue as if to chase the taste of him.
Arlen was seated next to him, writing notes. “I never took Harry as an Alpha that liked surprises. He doesn’t say much during your checkups. Silent, brooding type, I think they call them.”
The first time it had happened, Draco’s breath had hitched, craning his neck to gauge Harry’s reaction. Harry’s hand had been firmly pressed to his stomach, his cum still leaking out of Draco after they had just sex.
He wanted him harder, faster,
Draco wailed shrilly, coming suddenly from Harry’s cruel words. His cum coated both of their stomachs, the sticky liquid tacky between them as Harry continued brutalizing his hole at an unrelenting pace.
Enjoy!🖤
The kiss was clumsy and wet, Draco barely opening his mouth as Harry stroked his tongue against the boy’s. Before long they stopped, Draco’s little moans and tiny wails filling the room as Harry took him.
A copious amount of slick was gushing from his hole now, covering Harry’s mouth and chin with sugary sweetness that only made his cock pulse with need.
Lucius huffed and his gray eyes flicked over to Draco, giving him a questioning look. “Never thought I’d see the day where Harry Potter waltzes into my home with my son in tow.”
Draco timidly lifted his jumper, exposing his stomach for the Healer. He had never before had to share so much of himself with other people—
Draco beamed at his mother, tightening his fingers in Harry’s. “Thank you, Mum.”
“Are you quite done, Blaise?” he asked dryly, smirking up at him. He attempted to snatch the hat back from his hand where he dangled it teasingly.
His Omega pheromones hung thick and heavy in the air, making Harry’s cock almost instantaneously harden in response.
His husband, Theodore Nott, had disappeared while on the job over four months ago. He was an Auror for the Ministry and had been collaborating with the Department of Mysteries on an open case.
The rabbit would sleep tucked into his side or curled up on his chest, contentedly purring.
The taste of his Alpha sent a bolt of desire straight to his own cock.
“Mum!” a melodious voice called out from inside his apartment.
Though lust was on the forefront of his mind, he was surprised to feel...jealous.
Harry shuddered again.
Harry blew an irritated wisp of smoke into the air in front him, unable to quell his Alpha instincts when it came to Draco.
. I didn’t want Draco to live with the same regrets!”
Just before he had shot his load, he’d sunk his teeth into the wrist of his hand holding the thin fabric, imagining it was the pale column of Draco’s throat. When his own blood had welled, he’d eagerly lapped it up as if he were fucking starving for the taste of the boy.
“Stop it,” he whispered to himself, bending over to scoop up some of the spilt food from under Juni’s high chair.
He looked up at Draco, seeking permission.
could provide...
Draco covered his face with his hands, unable to watch. “I-I’m not, Harry.”
Draco pressed a soft kiss on his pup’s forehead and straightened. He turned, noticing that Harry was staring at the slowly deflating balloons floating the corner of Scorpius’ bedroom.
Harry liked him for the way that he was, he wasn’t like his father, always finding something to critique or some imperfection that needed to be rectified.
They had barely spoken to each other on the ride through the moors and Draco was quickly realizing she was a no-nonsense type of person, but he supposed she had to be in order to care for such a vast estate and keep things in order.
Draco blinked, warmth blanketing his chest and smothering the nervousness he had been carrying since he had decided to tell his parents the truth.
Draco could keep his secrets and he could keep whatever contents were in the bloody envelope.
He took out his wand and aimed it at himself, letting the tip hover over his throat and then down to his feet, casting a scent erasing spell. Hopefully the keen witch wouldn’t be able to smell any traces of Draco’s distress upon him.

“Mark me, Harry,” Draco begged hoarsely. “
Draco pursed his lips, feeling a flare of anger at Harry’s condescending words. “I suppose they won’t have any plaques made for you. Not with looking the way you do.”
They weren’t friends, lovers, or
“He’s so cute!”
He never wanted to wake up without Draco laying next to him again, or live without Scorpius’ infectious smiles.
As soon as the door closed behind them, Harry slammed his mouth onto Draco’s.
Kreacher had finally found him one evening and had ushered him out.
Harry’s gaze hardened. “I’ll tell you what happened. Your bloody
Maybe he had been wrong.
Harry nearly snarled when Draco pulled his nipple from his mouth, leaning forward to chase after it.
home now, too.”
Jack shrugged. “It was good seeing you again, Draco. I hope you can bring the pup by sometime to see us.”
Draco smiled at Hermione, who was currently holding Scorpius. His pup had been yanking on her unruly curls almost the whole night, but Hermione hadn’t seemed to mind.
And if one day, their bond did completely vanish, would Draco be able to cope with that and move on with his own life?
Maybe that was for the best. After all, that was what they had most in common.
Harry carefully pulled out of him, staring down at Draco with an unreadable expression. It was like he was trying to tell him something with his eyes again, attempting to convey something through their bond.
He lowered his head and shoved his tongue into Draco’s wet hole, licking and sucking at his stretched opening. The Alpha in him bayed with discontent, trying to heal any hurt that the dildo had caused to his Omega’s delicate, furled opening.
He knew that Harry had probably picked the clothes out. Even though he knew they had come from
a fool,
The pitying look in Ron’s dark eyes made Hermione feel sick, an unpleasant twinge in her stomach.
The papers Harry held had been in a folder on the kitchen counter. The papers were the profiles for potential alphas who could assist him during his pregnancy. If chosen, the alpha would essentially be loaning his pheromones and magic to Draco to help his pregnancy progress normally.
He chanced a glance at Hermione who was giving him a doleful look. “You’re not yourself, Harry.”
The lift halted, the doors opening. They were both silent, Draco refusing to look up from the flowers he held.
Harry took pity on him, angling his hips so that each of his thrusts rammed the head of his cock against his prostate.
Draco didn’t want to admit it, but he would soothe himself to sleep by nuzzling against the sheets of the bed, seeking out the remnants of the Alpha’s musky scent. Though the scent was scant now, Draco’s anxiety would lessen enough to allow him to close his eyes for short amounts of time.
There was an awkward beat of silence before Ender scooped his wand up and straightened, facing Harry.
Draco felt a pant in his heart, his thoughts immediately going to Theo.
”I didn’t ask to be rescued, Potter. I can take care of myself and Theo
Draco gave him another smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I should go now. Scorpius will want to nurse again soon.”
“Harry?”
we’ll be back in the same place we were before the start of the war.” Draco recognized Hermione’s no-nonsense voice.
“Mmm, even werewolf tails?” Harry turned and playfully bared his teeth at Scorpius who giggled in delight and enthusiastically pointed at Harry.
A large dark mahogany sleigh bed sat in the center of the bedroom and in the middle of it, laid a curled up Draco.
“I wanted to let you sleep. You seemed like you needed it after last night.”
Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth for a moment before answering. “P-Pansy,” he croaked, the name sounding foreign on his tongue.
His blond hair was spread around his head on the sheets, like a halo. His full lips were chapped, a faint flush visible across his small nose and cheeks.
As he watched Draco desperately wank himself, he knew his mate was close. His moans were growing louder, his eyes now closed and his mouth open in a look of pure ecstasy.
Harry stepped closer and leaned down, his chest brushing against Draco’s sensitive nipples, making him shiver.
He nearly jolted at the sight that greeted him.
he’d been at the festival with? Maybe he wanted an Alpha who—
It was almost as if he wanted to scream, but he didn’t know why. A feeling like he wanted to expel something from his very soul.
Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth, glancing down at his one-year-old son who was clumsily pawing at the neckline of his jumper and softly whining.
Harry’s crude words made Draco’s face suffuse with heat, unused to someone talking so crassly in front of him. He was even more mortified when a fresh gush of slick seeped from his hole, wetting the crotch of his pyjama pants.
“Mmm,” Harry hummed low in his throat, kneeling further over Draco and aligning his prick with his wet hole. “Let’s hear it, then. Scream about how much you despise me while I make
Harry’s throat suddenly felt tight.
Harry floated the stack of unreviewed case file notes over his desk, letting them drop directly in front of him.  He tugged one from the middle and opened it in front of him, losing himself in the hastily scribbled notes by one his Aurors.
Blaise put his hands on his hips, casting him a tired look. “You know he’s safe at home with Narcissa, Draco. I wanted to take you to the festival for you to have fun, not worry about Scorpius who is currently being spoiled
Draco flinched, his fingers tightening around Harry’s bicep. “Will you please just listen to me—”
, his Draco, his—
“We don’t have to talk about that, Arlen. It wasn’t your fault. It was a long time ago.”
Upon entering his living area, he almost groaned.
Harry punctuated his statement with a slam of his hips, making Draco whine low in his throat.

He supposed he could have thrown them in the bin on the way here, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.
Craving it.
Draco let out a strangled sob, feeling desperately
Draco cracked open his eyes to glare at him, but was met with a torturous sight.
—you’ll be indelibly tied to me for the rest of your miserable days.”
Unbidden, a small whimper escaped him.
”Hermione...”
Harry pulled back, his gaze dark with desire.
His skin felt too tight over his muscles, the cloying scent of the boy wafting to Harry's nostrils and setting his teeth on edge. The smell seemed to permeate the air around him, closing in from all sides in the enclosed space.
Harry cleared his throat.
Draco wasn’t talking anymore, just emitting tiny needful moans and high-pitched mewls that went straight to Harry’s cock.
“So pink and eager,” Harry cooed, shallowly pumping the tips of his fingers in and out at an agonizingly slow pace that had Draco softly mewling. “So wet for me.”
”What do you mean, Ron?”
“Anyway, I think he takes after Harry the most,” Draco murmured, wringing his hands in his lap.
Harry was quiet for a long moment before he reached down and let one of his fingers softly brush against Scorpius’ cheek, against where Draco’s tears had fallen.
Letting out a frustrated huff of air, he slid his palm beneath his pyjama bottoms, finally pressing between his legs.
Harry’s deliberate cruelty made his heart clench, hatred seething deep within him for the terrible man.
”Dada?”
Draco smiled, snuggling closer to Harry as he wrapped one of his strong arms around them both.
Harry gently pulled the pup’s fingers away and smiled. “It’s quite all right, Draco. I must look like a werewolf to him.”
Being inexplicably horny at the most random times was something he found he

His sweetheart’s heat was far from over and Harry planned to be there for his rabbit for every agonizingly desperate moment over the next few days.
A painful vise seemed to compress his heart, his eyesight blurring with angry tears.

His revenge had come to fruition, but it tasted bitter on his tongue. Like a foul tasting potion that he had to choke down in order to achieve the desired effect.

in London.”
Harry’s cruel words were like a slap to the face, shame overtaking his post-orgasm bliss. He turned away, not even bothering to clean himself up. He curled into a ball on the bed, wrapping his arms around his stomach.
Draco tried to slap his hands away, heat creeping up his neck. “It’s just the hormones. Get off me, Potter. I don’t need to be coddled—”
Harry laid on his bed, watching the boy. He smiled at the boy’s obvious innocence. In his rabbit form, his sweetheart had loved to hop around his room for hours on end, content to keep going until Harry scooped him up for bath time.
Alpha.
“But…I want you to stay,” Draco said softly, stepping forward until they were only centimeters apart.
Their wedding picture seemed to taunt him from his peripheral, making his guilt even worse.
The fine, blond hairs on Draco’s arm were soft beneath his touch and he couldn’t help but yearn for their skin to touch again in other places.
Harry smirked, his eyes still glued to whatever he was reading. “Your wards are laughable, Malfoy. You haven’t gotten any better at protective enchantments since we were back at school.”
All of these textbooks were familiar to him.
Reluctantly, he raised both his hands in front of him and turned them over, showing his blistered palms.
“Minister Shacklebolt requested it. He thought that because we went to school together, it would be more
”Okay! Can I go say hi to Kreacher, Mummy?”
looks people had cast him...
Harry smirked and stood, his prick still painfully hard because of the cloying scent of Draco’s slick on his fingers and the floor.
Harry clenched his jaw and inhaled slowly through his nostrils in an attempt to quell the incessant questions that seemed to be stuck on a loop within his mind.
gland on his throat. “Just cutting me out my son’s life without even giving me a chance?” he murmured.
. My mother was not afforded the same luxury, Narcissa.”
A collar of burnished copper circled her throat, looking similar to his own collar. He wondered if it, too, repressed her magic. He glanced up at her torn ear and then back down to her black scut that poked out from the back of her threadbare trousers.
Harry stood, yanking Draco up with him by his wrist. He grabbed his other wrist, pulling him close until his belly was pressed uncomfortably tight between them.
“You’re welcome, Draco. Happy birthday,” she said softly, tightening her arms around him.
Strong arms caught him from the front mid-fall, pulling him upright. On reflex, he wrapped both of his hands around the man’s arms, steadying himself.
“Oh, I intend to, little one.” Harry paused for a moment, the silence hanging heavy in the air between them. “Kreacher tells me that you’re refusing to eat. How do you expect to carry my child if you do not nourish your own body?”
When he pressed one of his leather-clad fingertips into a blister, Draco yelped and jerked his hand back.
He climbed into bed behind Draco and helped him out of his clothes, grateful for his help due to the alcohol still making his movements clumsy and stilted. When they were both down to just their underwear, Harry spooned Draco from behind. He pulled the covers over all three of them, making Draco release a soft sigh.
Harry idly wondered what they would look like engorged and dripping milk. If Draco became pregnant, Harry knew they would become swollen and sensitive.
Harry ripped off Draco’s pyjama bottoms, tossing them to the side. He also pulled off his own underwear, carelessly tossing them to the side too.
The pure-blooded bitch was finally getting what she deserved. Harry already had plans in place for when Draco became pregnant with his child. He planned to Apparate to Azkaban and pay a visit to the future grandmother of his child.
Too bad he didn’t
The boy nodded and whimpered when Harry began massaging the edges of his long ears. He pressed his clawed thumbs into the delicate cartilage, mimicking what the boy had done to

Harry kissed the boy’s burgeoning prick, letting one of his fangs softly scrape down the side of his shaft. “Tell Dada,” he said throatily. “Tell me.”
Harry shook his head and picked up the papers he was reading. “You’re joining the Alpha Interim Program?”

Today, he was going to introduce Scorpius to Harry’s close friends.
”Easy, love. It’s not going anywhere.”
Harry saw that the rabbit had left his food untouched, but the fur around his pink nose had been damp. At least he knew he had drank some water.
