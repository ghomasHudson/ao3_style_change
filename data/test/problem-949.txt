“I had to do something! She was going to be taken away!”
“—It was my fault,” he equivocated, sticking his hand under the tap while Harry used a towel to mop up the mess. The other man went to ask him something, undoubtedly personal, when he quickly cut in, shutting off the tap and shaking the water from his hand, “Who was on the floo?”
.” Draco was almost shocked at the venom in his voice, the cooled heat and
“I don’t have a martyr complex,” he crossed his arms as well, “I’m trying to do the right thing—”
All there was was silence. He watched the blood drip onto the floor while Lacey tried to see. He couldn’t let her. He turned back out, and nearly ran into the tall auror again.
“I should be getting back to work...” Harry shook his head slightly.
Also also, apologies to any folks who work in grocery stores/convenience stores as Harry most definitely left the bread in the tea aisle and for that I am sorry.
Here he was, floating along peacefully, following the march of time and along came Potter and his laundry list of issues and memories that Draco didn’t want. He’s put so much of it behind him, so much of it dead and buried that to resurrect it was truly a violation of the natural order of things. He didn’t want it and Potter had no business doing it.
Cynthia Wallis is based, in name, on Wallis Simpson, who caused an abdication on the British throne and then Tommy is just your standard, scruffy Buddy Holly looking second generation Polish American from Chicago who hates New York style pizza with a passion. I think I’ve met like 40 guys like Tommy since moving to Chicago myself, so it was the perfect thing to toss in as her assistant on this case.
“Not a fan of love songs?” Draco nearly jumped but not out of being startled. More that he couldn’t believe, though that was his own doing, that Harry Potter had found him again. It seemed that he was going to have to abandon this store.
“Hey Hermione,” Harry said cheerfully. Draco shot him a look. Clearly drinking made the chosen one even more stupidly suicidal. Weasley simply just raised his hands higher.
“I don’t want them to be gone!” She wailed, “We were supposed to go to church and then back to Gran’s!”
“It’s a bit of Sisyphean task, in a sense, the second we start to get caught up, there’s more to add—but that’s why I try and focus on more concrete projects that have more reasonable goals.”
The boards began to fill up as the sun continued its arc across the sky, shifting the light until they needed the artificial ones. Cynthia used an odd pen to jot down notes on the white board, asking questions like ‘MCPA precedent?’ and ‘HP/DM score?’ and ‘Copy of ‘constitution’?’ Her handwriting was full of loops, old fashioned and rather beautiful, starkly different from the blocky, architectural script of her compatriot. The pen was in bright blue on white.
“So to confirm, since I didn’t before, this means we’re dating?”
“I was so scared of losing you—“
Hardy stared at him, and with how close they were, it was easy to see the flecks of warm, golden hazel hidden in the green of his eyes.
“Do you?” Harry watched him as closely as he was watching him. Who would blink first?
day, it felt like. Then there was the stressful visions when he slept—never quite a nightmare and never quite a dream. Just the same feeling compounded in the dark. Alone, only seeing flashes of other people, other moments, other feelings before the dark loneliness was back.
There was a desk and chair in the center, a stack of case files in the inbox, more pens and desk ornaments that were clearly made by kids. And the shelves— they were new, with more files, and books and even more nicknacks and photos. Some of them even had frames.  But more importantly, there was a clear love in this room, a clear love for the people gone and the people who remained.  After all of the hate and pain, some love was good.
“Cynthia Wallis of Mage-USA, you must be Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy,” she said with a crisp, northeastern and undeniably American accent and a broad, friendly smile. Harry smiled back but Draco was demure, giving a somewhat friendly nod. They weren’t chums, as Blaise would say, so there was no reason to greet one another as if they were. She shook both of their hands before inclining her head back in a short nod, “And this is my assistant, Thomas Gabryszak.”
After they’d spent what felt like all day talking and playing with Rebecca, they would return back to the Auror offices and Harry would try to track down her family. There wasn’t much left that hadn’t gotten caught in the blast and like Rebecca had said, her dad’s side of the family, the few that were left, weren’t so keen to open letters from the Ministry. Draco has gone through a few books in his time waiting (and becoming
“Always a good strategy,” John added, and to Harry he said “We’ll have the interview room on three ready when you are.” They both left, chatting about some muggle movie they’d both seen, something about spies who’d lost their memory and had gotten revenge. It didn’t sound familiar to him but they seemed to be friends outside of work as well. He was getting ready to follow suit when Harry stopped him, shutting the door.
“Right,
“Harry slow down—“ Harry ignored him, walking at a steady clip. “Harry—“ Nothing. “Potter
“And the city of braggarts as well,” Cynthia interjected as they stepped out into the light of dusk. It had cooled off a bit from earlier in the day but was still fairly warm for the summer. Thomas laughed shaking his head. “Well, lay on MacDuff. Lead us to food.” Harry even laughed at that and Draco smiled at him.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Harry shift before coming closer, standing only a half meter away.
have to stay on brand.” Harry just laughed more, his voice ringing out, catching up to him and walking close enough their shoulders brushed as they navigated the slush and snow drifts. They walk in content silence and Draco will allow himself this crystalline moment. Real or not real, he’d earned this slice of happiness.
This was when the first figure out of the smoke appeared, long black robe shimmering with green, dark tendrils of magic, but the mask.
Behind her was an even taller, broader man, with two days of facial hair, square, thick black glasses and wearing a dark gray suit with a thin tie. It seemed that while she was stretched tall, he was tall proportionally and regarded them all with a brief but matching smile before falling into a more blank expression. He also had a pin on his lapel but also seemed to be in charge of carrying their bags, and her briefcase. He nodded once at the introduction before reaching out a firm hand to shake each of theirs once. Draco’s hand ached a bit from all the glad-handing they’d been doing over the week, between this and looking for a new place that could hold three people instead of two. Another change from the past.
“I know,” he told her in the same soothing voice, “I know you were.” Rebecca kept crying.
But...
“—Oh come off it—“
They made the rest of the way to the ministry in silence.
By the time he’d gotten there and assessed the scene, dour aurors hanging all around him in the heavy sun shower around him, eyeing his investigative measures with suspicion, there was little he could do. The sun and rain combination was the smallest irony of the day. Draco ducked inside the house, the preliminary look at the house had revealed nothing more than what had already happened. It was the stuff of nightmares. He pulled back out to talk to the head auror, a tall man with a permanent scowl and half an ear.
“ he said sharply. “You’re scaring Rebecca.”
He looked to Liza and John but they both seemed fine with that line of questioning. Draco had a small epiphany then that while they both were friends with Harry, that congenial behavior didn’t necessarily extend to him and that perhaps he had misjudged the protections that the infamous Harry Potter held.
“I was wrong before,” he said, “You’re a
“You reckon we can get to the front?”
“My father was involved in a separatist group that contributed to the rise of a dark wizard and believed in magical purity for wizardkind,” he could hear his own tone, cool and detached, as easily as slipping on a mask, while his heart raced and he hated, hated his past self with a vehemence he kept for himself, “I was raised that way and kept those values until I was old enough to start baring the consequences for participating in the war and then I started to question things. I was fully free of the ideology by the time my sentence was over. I don’t believe those sorts of things any more.” He knew it
So anyway, one boy is in love and one is a disaster but he’s
“I suppose, it is
But it would be okay. They just had to get through this and it would settle back into normalcy.
But it kept happening. He felt like he was being stalked by Harry and that he was stalking Harry in turn, nothing like their sixth year but everything like it, the intensity of the emotions. It wasn’t
Maybe it’s Gryffindor optimism rubbing off on him or Slytherin pride telling him that he’s earned this, but whenever Draco will look back on this, he’s going say it was worth it.
“C’mon,” Harry tugged his hand, spying a chair and a half in the corner, “No sense shouting through this.”
“If that
“He didn’t mean it—Ron tell him.”
“Into danger or away from you?”
“Piss off. Then I thought about it and I realized I never really liked potions, learning about them, I was just good at them. But I did really like Transfiguration— the idea of knowing something well enough to make it into something else.”
She nodded, “Specifically, the Magical Child Protection Act of 1987. It’s dense but it essentially created three rules: one, that children have as much rights to be safe, treated fairly and cared for by adults of sound mind and reasoning. Two, that schooling must be adequate in all things necessary for adulthood, now including things like taking care of yourself, filing taxes, that sort. Three, it is the duty of the Department of Magical Child Services to determine if these needs are being met and if not, to place children in schools and homes that fill these needs. The actual text is far denser but that’s the premise.” Harry nodded slowly.
They stared at each other, while the woman kept singing around them, “
“Fuck

“Out of sorts. Are you sure you’re alright?”
“Tommy,” the man corrected goodnaturedly, adjusting his glasses with a free hand before gesturing with his empty fork, “And technically I work for FMI, Federal Magical Investigations. It’s basically the FBI but for Enchanted.” Thomas grinned.
“Pansy once told me this thing about people,” he told Harry as they took the less busy streets, already filled with mother’s and children doing the shopping, “About how they find each other?”
He turned to face Luna Lovegood, her hair in a complex set of twists and tumbles where bright red chopsticks stuck out of it, in a soft peach sundress with grey woolen tights and snow boots and white fingerless gloves bedecked with pearls and her, now famous, radish earrings swinging as she fixed him with a tilted-headed look, “I’m sorry—”
“Well, it’s a pleasant subject, Flitwick never tried to kill me and I think it was the only class where no one expected anything of me and I was decent at it. What about you?” Distracted, he thought on this as he watched Harry take a bite of cold Mars Bar.
a child versus adopting one but I assume that would be the same issue even if you weren’t wizards. There’s a whole slew of paperwork that will need to be done.”
He didn’t even remember going into the bathroom. He’s not even sure what happened.
It was only his own thoughts that were adding color to it, imagining the feel of the hands that held the ‘biro,’ the brow that had crinkled as he thought on what to write. If he had thought his imagination was awful prior to last night, he was so incomprehensibly wrong.
He had to focus on this curse though, ignoring the bile rising in his throat and the panic cresting in him. The curse, the curse and
This was one of the hardest chapters for me to write, a lot of it being me suffering from some writer’s block and some backsliding in my own personal headspace. Writing this helps though, so here’s an extra large chapter to make up for it.
you to say anything. You don’t know how to tell him it’ll be okay because you don’t know what to do. And you still don’t know what to do when the resignation papers come in so you burn them, worried that if Harry loses this, he’ll be gone for good.
“I know.” Harry licked his lips, they were red in the chill air. “Draco… I’m sorry about your father. I don’t think you’re like him at all and I definitely
I wasn’t okay. I’d won after all. I’d killed or destroyed all of them, including Voldemort and I’d put away the rest. So why wasn’t I fine? Why wasn’t I happy with her? Why why why?” He went to hit the wall for effect, in his pacing, but all the fight went out of him in the same breath.
“Mother,” he said sharply, reminding himself of his father and the words felt like a knife wound. Her jaw clicked shut behind silent lips and they stared again at one another. She had often remarked how much he looked like his father, prior to the war. He wondered if she regretted the comparison now.
“I can’t promise I’m worth your time—” Draco admits.
“It’s not your fault, obviously,” he hastily added, “Bloody machines.” This seemed to be a good catchall for the mechanical maladies that happened in the non-magic world and most Muggles seemed to agree with it. She nodded in response, her shivering name tag said Matilda, and she wiped her eyes prematurely, which only served to make her seem even younger. She seemed eager to try and save the sale by starting to ramp up into a conversation about how much the machine’s fault it was.
, walking almost faster than the rest of them, Thomas only a half step behind her.
He’d never lost time in Pimlico. But he couldn’t stall any longer.
“Right, during detention,” Draco responded, he’d heard the story in bits and pieces over the year, the first small connection to his deceased family.
It really was a simple question, to Draco at least: “How far are you going to go with this, Harry?”
, the intoxicating feel of trust, barely earned but returned in spades, and it hit him with the strength of the ocean cresting a violent wave that stole his breath and his feet out from under him. But the thought itself, the secret confession, was quiet under the sounds of Harry.
Draco’s heart felt like it was stuck in a compact box that was only getting smaller and he wasn’t sure yet why. But Rebecca’s new story about her friend Clarence’s dog was helping.
“What?” It takes him a moment and the stares of half the other people in chairs to calm down enough to answer but eventually he straighten a up with a pop of his spine.
“And stuff...” Draco repeated, still staring at him. Matilda seemed to look between the two, sliding over some silver and copper coins across the counter slowly, unwillingly to break apart their staring.
, there’s so much more.” He rested his head against the wall, a dark, somber mass against all the white.
The person Cynthia is referring to is 104 year old Frances Hasselbein, who fell into managing the Girl Scouts of America and sort of popularized a form of management called Circular Management, which is exactly as Cynthia describes. Frances basically only took the jobs she took because people asked and really needed her and sort of fell into an amazing career. Fascinating stuff and fascinating life for a woman who by her own admission never intended to do much more than raise a family and never went to college but now has 23 honorary degrees and an even more fascinating life story.
He almost laughed at himself. The words were always there. He was just too cowardly to use them.
He’d attempted to extrapolate this to Harry once but couldn’t really articulate it in a way that made sense.
And he very resolutely, very assuredly, very distinctly was
“Perish the thought,” he drawled in return, “Then you’d only be with my memory insulting you for company.” But he walked closer, until their arms were nearly flush as they walked, “In all seriousness, that’s good. Let me... Let me know if you need an opinion. Or an ear,” And he had zero idea how to be supportive, particularly while drunk, so he floundered on the next part, “Or something.” How did one accurately describe the delicacy that was being wanted, specifically by the one you cared about. The one you would go to awkward outings to pubs with and share maudlin memories with. Harry gave him all of that and more, only asking his opinion in return when Draco would find a way to give him the sun and stars if he could. How inarticulate words were when love was involved.
No wonder they joined forces; some of the
“Yellow would be ghastly,” Draco seemed to be agreeing, going along with this bizarre conversation as if he weren’t sitting here talking with his former mortal enemy and instead just chatting with a stranger about rug colors of all things, “Go with gray. Or taupe. Safe and neutral.”
And now, Draco ‘entirely-too-trusting-when-it-comes-Harry-Fucking-Potter’ Malfoy was enjoying the pitying stares from the muggles in the restaurant and the waitress coming by, yet again, to ask him if he’d like to order anything.
It had also been almost three years since the

“Both,” he amended, “Either.” Harry laughed, draining the rest of the wine glass as the placed the half unwrapped sweets on the porcelain plate. He filled another glass before walking back over with all three somehow balanced with that seeker’s sense of grace he seemed to retain.

“I stopped.”
Things would be all right.
“Yeah, they’re stories, you know, long running cast, unnecessary drama, been on since the dawn of time for housewives to watch after the kids are in bed.”
“Unfortunately, yes,” Draco could catch just part of their conversation, as Rebecca was busily telling him all about her bike.
“Stairs could use a looking over,” Cathleen broke him out of his thoughts, watching the stout woman test the second to last step.
would never so choose. “He was a half blood man who thought he could outsmart death and get rid of muggles all in one go. Non-magical people,” he added, seeing their blank looks. “He ended up taking over the government after his return and went on a reign of terror for a year or so, killing tens of thousands, both muggle and wizard, along with his followers, until he was killed at the Battle of Hogwarts in ‘98.”
“It’s less quiet here and no one seems to know who I am, so I am free to wander aisles of rugs and teacups to my hearts content. Were you reading?” Potter motioned with a flippant hand towards the book under Draco’s arm. He felt like a child with his hand in the sweets jar.
“I think you’ve picked an odd day to hide away in your office and snog, Harry,” he said, deflecting so he could snort and call him some sort of teasing name and they could go up to be torn to shreds. Well, he would. Harry would likely walk away with a glowing review.
His father had never changed. In a large part, reading and his small interactions changed how he thought of them and maybe that had led them here, to this exact spot.
fucking hours for him to show up. Two hours. And he couldn’t even come here and grovel on his own—”
“No. I mean, yes. Yes.”
much different on this case, being that they were involved. “And you can’t have me check over your work, so please verify,” and he looked at Liza with that as she playfully stuck her tongue out at him, “with each other to make sure you don’t leave anything out. No sugarcoating, no omissions, no white lies. This is by the book through and through.”
After that, over a few months, it became an ad hoc routine of theirs. One of them would owl the other. Or send a message via floo. Or they’d catch each other’s eyes after long hard cases, somehow finding each other in the same circles of houses. Or Harry would end up in the spices section of the Tescos or Harry would find him standing in front of the bargain teas and with a jut of the chin they’d head to the pub. Sometimes they would talk, usually only about trivial, annoying stuff, pressed close enough together at the bar that that when Harry would laugh as Draco gestured, he could feel it along his left arm.
Was it worth it?
He missed those simple days in Belfast, at times. Learning about Bex’s life—her love of cats, her desire to be a quidditch player and a teacher
“Really?”
There was silence as Draco stared down at the words swimming in the book.
“Second issue, and this is a very old law from 800 years ago that was modified 150 years ago, that says that family is in charge of deciding on schooling and Irish families have precedent for removing their children from British schools—however, it’s got a secondary ruling that British families are given no acceptance into Irish wizarding schools. Essentially, because Rebecca is Irish, she’s not allowed to be taught at Hogwarts if her family says so, however, if she is adopted by a Brit, she wouldn’t be allowed at any Irish schools, a ridiculous notion but one which has, as a result, complicated the adoption bid. Placement starts as soon as they turn 10 and Rebecca is 9, hence the reason why there’s all these extra hoops to jump through.”
(See the end of the chapter for

Luckily the waiter came by dropping off plates of steaming pasta, interrupting that depressing train of thought. There was a general murmuring of tastes and reactions to the food. Draco polished off another glass of wine, glad to have a distraction. They’d hardly ever had pasta at the manor and his mother had always preferred buttery or dry white wines, so it was easy to push all of that away, let it drift back under the endless churning ocean in his mind.
“But everyone starts off learning the same things.”
“Yes, I need their names because there is a terrified mother and child in there who just watched their family die and panicking is only going to make it worse.” Even though he was a foot shorter, the auror recoiled at the icy heat in his voice.
“Well, the closet we get is that our version of the GED—a high school or primary education diploma—has a different name for each of the three countries. We have the BEEVD, the Basic Enchanted Education Evaluation Diploma, then in Canada there’s the MGED, Magie et Générale Examen Diplôme, and in Mexico they have the MTC or the Magia Títlo Calificado. However, most of the students call it the BEEV or the Beaver, now that the internet is quite popular.”

“So it’s a fairly standard case, in so much that we’re following the same procedure we always do.”

“Is it a woman?”
Almost instantly, the father was eviscerated, his innards strewn about the kitchen in a macabre display once he had tripped the trap. His oldest son was next, who in his haste had trigged the jellying curse, which turned his bones to acid and ate its way through his soft flesh. Then the next brother, terrified, had simply been vaporized by a series of heated curses. The mother was currently stuck under an enchanted weight, designed to slowly crush, while the youngest daughter, trapped and wounded from the fringes in the doorway sat, frightened and crying and in view of the whole thing.
But here they were now, Draco sat next to Harry and adjacent to Weasley at one of the high topped tables, all facing the bar and the shut off 'Telly', waiting for Ron to return the double of whiskey and...red wine. And since when has their usual order become a pattern? Since when had he come to expect and look forward to the whiskey and lager and the low, subtle mood in the pub? Even the bartender eyed them with their new additions warily. When did
“Harry—”
“Slept through the whole thing,” Thomas added in a deep voice with an even broader accent than hers. Near them a ‘plane’ went roaring over them. He winced at the sound. No one else seemed to have any reaction.
“Which are?”
“An orphan, like you... are...” she looks at both of them with a dazed look, “Is everyone really dead?”
Draco only murmured a few agreements in response, quickly getting changed and into bed so he could rest his head. Harry followed suit, talking to him still through the ensuite.
“Now now,” Butterman said with a grimace, “Why don’t we go talk this out in private?”
Finally after the forth returned letter (returned by Howler no less) the Head Auror—a tall rangy fellow by the name of Butterman— decided to just show up on their doorstep.
He felt the room grow very small and he could already see the pained and upset expression on Harry’s face as he realized that he had lost them their chance. He didn’t dare look at Liza or John, knowing they wouldn’t help him there.
was terrifying) that was coming through. But looking at this young girl, with her impossibly large eyes and dirty blonde-red hair and skinned knee that still had a ‘Mickey Mouse’ plaster on it, he felt a torrent of emotions rise up and replace the doubts. He wanted to protect this girl from the world if he could. It broke his heart just as badly that he couldn’t.
He pushed him off, “You—what—how—”
“God, two miserable sights in the same restaurant.” And his smile turns a little sadder at him. “It was another rough case today—I couldn’t leave him alone. And,” he swallowed, and Draco realized in that moment that he was just as scared of this thing between them as he was, “I can’t promise I won’t do the same thing again, Draco.” It sounded like a promise; a promise to try because this was worth it. A promise to trust without looking to see if this were the light at the end of the tunnel or an incoming train, because they’d be walking together, facing outward.
“You’re far from poor...”
He dropped his voice down to a hoarse whisper, it was still a bit chilly out to be standing even in warm rain and he never yelled much as it was, but this would be more threatening, “And you better do a good job of it or else.”
Harry nodded and turned away, understanding those words, and already marching up the street leaving Draco to bid their adieu— “Thank you Auror Daniels.”—before also turning and catching up to him.
“I remember,” and Draco was barely keeping the frustration from leaking into his voice. He very dearly wanted to pick a fight, but knew that people were waiting on them. At least Harry would go first, that way he hoped they would be a bit more lenient on his crimes.
and Draco was almost certain he’d seen the littlest Weasley nearly spit out her beer and turn green, making her look unfortunately Christmas-y.
“I’m Harry Potter, and this is my partner, Draco Malfoy,” Draco gave her a smile, which he hoped properly conveyed ‘concerned but trustworthy adult,’ “And it’s nice to meet you. Do you remember what happened?”
He told him an abridged version, starting at the very beginning with the first encounter in Patel’s, skirting any discussion of Harry’s past out of respect and ending with their heated confession and plans for the day that would include Draco cutting this off before it ended poorly. To his credit, the other man didn’t react much, except to clarify the timeline and to occasionally shake his head or nod. By the end of it, he was exhausted, despite it only having been 20 minutes, the events having taken, he now realized, over the better part of a year.

“What’s
“You just said it,” he said, holding out a cold sweet for Draco to bite off, “It’s all about knowing something well enough you can change it— that’s cursebreaking, knowing a curse well enough and inside and out you can break it. It’s a lot of research and discovery and then you finally test it.”
to be better for you, mostly so you’d stop finding creative ways to remind me of how sad I was.”
After the first 15 minutes of waiting, he’d just assumed that Harry was running late due to his chronic inability to judge times. It was endearing, at times. At 30 minutes, Draco made internal excuses that Harry was likely tidying up something at work or had run into one of the many aurors who seemed to always want to pick his brain. He ordered a sparkling water, a delightful thing he’d discovered they would serve here and practiced what teasing remark he would make when Harry finally rushed in. At 55 minutes late, Draco almost left, but instead, switched to the other chair so he could watch the door and wait for him to walk in. He ordered another water, forgoing the lemon this time. At an hour and five minutes past, someone asked to borrow the chair across from him, as the crowd was picking up, but he declined their request, stating that he was waiting for someone. The waitress stopped over a few more times. And now he was here, nearing an hour and 45 minutes late and looking down at his empty place setting and wishing he could break the secrecy law to disappear without having to get up and walk out of the restaurant in shame.
, now?”
It was cases like these he hated.
¹ = Harry has a very basic knowledge of muggle politics, so in 2005 he’s finally stared picking up papers and understanding about this newfangled (to him, it started in 1992) EU thing people keep talking about, and why Pansy kept complaining about Euros over Francs. If you’re wondering, he reads
“—You make me
“Well,” Harry pauses, placing his other hand on top of hers, where her freckled pale skin is tightly gripping his far darker wrist, “I’m not sure what you mean... can you tell me?”
“We’d like to bid for custody of Rebecca!”
He was beyond mad, so mad, that he was calm and, if memory served him, absolutely terrifying when he wore the right expression. And, just like he remembered, Ronald grew even more pale than usual. “Uh, Malfoy—”
“Is that a program?” Draco answered finally looking at the glowing box by the bar, leaning towards Harry, he could hear his hesitance in naming it.
Harry stopped and looked at him, bright streetlight above them as they locked eyes.
And even knowing that, he
Realistically, he and Lacey were both very lucky that day.
“Mummy!” She sobbed, paying no attention to Draco, instead reaching out for her mother who struggled more in reaction to her daughters cries, he yanked her back, holding the struggling girl as her mother kept reaching, the mirrors pulling her hair back. He couldn’t wave his wand and do much while still holding the daughter.
just behind Harry while he and Ronald shared a laugh with Granger. He could see Finnegan off by the bar, getting another round staring at him and could only imagine how completely off-putting and potentially insane he looked. He tried a short nod, one he’d seen Harry use at all sorts of aurors and it made Finnegan only do a double take.
—over a lightly patterned bedspread in soft cream, the pillows strewn across it in matching colors and patterns. The walls were bare, but a stack of prints with a note in the distinctive cursive of Editor in Chief Lovegood lent against the wall. There was a dresser, older, but in good quality and the clothes neatly within. Sensing that Harry wouldn't stop him, he peeked inside. He recognized the sweatshirts that Harry favored in a tidy stack, running his fingers along the fabric. Similarly, the closet was open but organized, the shoes ranging from ratty trainers to nicer brown dress shoes with a faint shine in a slightly lopsided row. The light was soft, coming from the fan in the ceiling and the large moon outside and there, under the slightly raised mattress, sat the grey rug from the first night. Draco was right, something neutral worked very well there.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “As long as it’s a good explanation, as promised, I think sitting my be a better option.”
So when the “work trip” had come up, to clear a series of properties in Northern Ireland that needed Draco (currently the best dark magic curse breaker of the firm and therefore the country by process of elimination and disregard for Gringrotts, as Bill Weasley liked to remind him at Sunday dinner) to take care of clearing these places, where there was a wide variety of foods to try and less people that cared who he was, there wasn’t much he to do to convince Harry otherwise. They were going to Northern Ireland.
What was wrong with him?
“And Rebecca’s birthday is?”
She watched him very carefully, “I thought we agreed not to lie to one another.”
“I’m not much of a wordsmith, as you can probably tell from my rambling stories,” Harry replied, with a chuckle tucked into the warm fondness in his voice, “But hopefully you’ll find it in yourself, your real self, to forgive me, and,”
Draco thinks as he waves Harry goodbye that the steps to his admittedly posh flat,

“I was sleeping in one of the sleeping bags we used on the run, angry at myself, unable to handle the inactivity, hating everything. I knew I needed to buy things— furniture, food, so on but some— some small part of me is still that boy in the cupboard, watching the rest of the world through the slats on the door and wishing. I couldn’t bring myself to take up space. All I kept doing was watching the sun go past and thinking about, well, everything. And at some point, I thought of you.” Draco inhaled sharply.
“It’s very true, a lot of Americans, magical
He paused again, remembering a few months ago when he was at a similar crossroads, and decided what to say.
Harry didn’t even notice that Draco was already asleep.
“Far better,” Draco agreed after too long of a pause.
“I won’t lie and say it’s easy, but I couldn’t possible see myself doing anything else,” he said, a soft smile on his face. Absently, as he traced the tines of his unused salad fork, he wondered if he himself was happy at work. He supposed so. No where near as happy as Harry, but that was his lot in life.
“Hm,” she made a note, “Are you planning on telling the child in question about your past?” The question grazed him as a fast as any spell could, sending him into a spin.
Matilda looked at the candies and the crisps and looked back at him, smile breaking out. This was also a common occurrence, apparently something about Harry would just cause members of both sexes to break into smiles (something Draco would deny but secretly made him pleased and vain that Harry was all for him). Draco posited once, perhaps while intoxicated on some extremely good scotch that they were drinking because they ran out of wine and had to break into the ‘Chosen One Liquor Gifts,’ that his messy hair reminded people of a lost puppy with floppy ears hence their kind words and smiles. This of course prompted his response, “So does that include you?” accompanied by this half-lechorous-half-endearing grin. And Draco could barely save face, feeling his skin flush outside of the alcohol, as he responded, “Well, obviously but that doesn’t mean you can skirt the dishes every time you throw bedroom eyes at me—“ and after that there wasn’t much else they spoke of on the subject that night. At least not with words. And the dishes still weren’t done.
Draco eyed the whiskey and followed suit. It was a lot smoother than fire whiskey.
“Hey,” he said quietly and just for him, “It’s going to be okay.”
“Likewise, Weasley.”
Draco shivered involuntarily.
“No.”

“I need to show you something, to show you why...” They didn’t break eye contact. “Come to my place, please?” He sounded desperate, as if Draco wasn’t already far too involved in this, as if it were even an option.

It had finally stopped raining.

“Weasley, you wouldn’t know style if it showed up on your front step in a golden crown, with loud fanfare and calling itself the Queen,” and Draco instantly clammed up. The wine had clearly gone to his head and
“You know,” Ronald says, as they wait for the elevator to take them down to the second level, “When you’re not trying to be a terrible arse, you’re kind of funny.” He’s about to retort when he catches up to the words.

Then they (Draco and Harry, never Ronald) started having lunch every now and then, even on days when there were no cases to be had. And owling when they could, starting with short notes and progressing to letters. It was nice, being friends with Harry, who would write medium length letters in cramped print handwriting, compared to Draco’s looping cursive, formed with years of practice. But they never ran out of things to say, surprisingly. And he found the time passing faster.
Because the goblins are essentially pocketing the profits—a single galleon converted to GBP is about 10GBP at Gringrott’s whereas if you convert it from “pure gold” to GBP it’s worth 72-145GBP, at today’s prices. Wild. Even more wild? Harry’s minimum net worth in today’s prices would be anywhere from 3.2M-6.5M GBP, not counting the other stacks of coins in his bank, interest rates, the value of his holdings OR the residuals (potentially) of the Potter name.

The higher the population, the more likely you are to find Jewish magic schools, Polish, Irish— if there was an ethnic group that moved to the US, the likelihood that you would also find a magical school to serve that population was high.”
, but surprising
“Cheers mate,” Harry held up his whiskey once before knocking it back in a smooth motion.
“Hey, there were extremely— externally—“
Once he’d gone home, he eagerly set about putting this odd occurrence behind him, Draco had returned to his normal routine. He avoided the rugs permanently— that seemed the safest way. Surely Potter, the rich victor that will be remembered in history, was looking for many rugs to furnish the many rooms of his home. And he wasn’t jealous, the Manor had been tarnished beyond all belief and his mother and he had both agreed that selling everything and keeping the place empty was the best option, in terms of the reparations and the legal fees and the funeral and their costs, but it still stung. That losing was so costly and winning so princely a reward.
“To be stuck in an endless perfect circle with you?” Draco looked at him, the perpetual thinness of his face, the crackling silvered scar against his warm sepia skin, the dark hair in a haphazard, the kindness of his smile, the brilliant and emotive green of his eyes. He wondered what Harry saw in him, if he saw Draco in the same way, with his pale skin and flushed cheeks, almost always a certainty when Harry was around, the cool grey of his eyes and the more delicate arch of his brows, the slant of his nose, with just the faintest bump that said it had been broken, the ashy blond color of his hair, and how it would get more yellow in the summer sun. “I think I could handle that.”
“Well, I have certainly seen worse rooms,” John states, making his notes. Draco watches him measure out the space just to check that it’s an appropriate size. Liza peeks in the empty closet and seeing nothing, jots the bare minimum on her paperwork.
It was time to lay it all bare. Fighting wasn’t worth the cost, especially the cost of Harry.
on the bloody street.”
“I suppose you need me to give you an account of what happened,” he finally said. Harry looked up.
Once they’d looked one another over, afraid to speak but entirely concerned, Draco had started undoing some of the more embedded curses poking out of the stone buildings, needing something for the adrenaline, while Harry talked with the aurors, detailing what had happened, how many their were, etc; a few who recognized him were able to smooth over and vouch for the extremely powerful wizard standing before them (wearing of all things: ripped slim fit jeans, a stolen red flannel from Ronald from ages ago and a shirt that was advertising something called ‘Spice World’) and, as a result, his curse breaking boyfriend (dressed
“I’m glad you understand that.” Cathleen smiled. She had looked so average before. He remembered what Harry had told him about Umbridge, how she’d used blood quills and built up a kind, if a bit florid, exterior so her actions would slide below the surface like a riptide. “Well, I think that’s all the questions I had. Anyone else?”

“Stop lying!” They were in each other’s faces now and he felt 16 again and out of control of his emotions. He could smell stagnant water and hear dripping even though they were in the drawing room. But at least he felt alive. No longer a ghost, a poltergeist.
“Occupied,” he croaked in response, before the fist scoffed, muttered ‘pussy’ and left off to find another open bathroom in the Ministry.
Thank you everyone has read and kudosed and commented so far! I very much appreciate it :)
And so they spent the next hour sitting, drinking lager, and commenting on
where he could shove his report. You should have seen the look on his face!” He crowed, finishing off his glass as well and setting it next to Draco’s for whoever was in charge for the next round. Likely Harry as it was his turn again.

“It’s been fairly hot compared to past summers,” Draco said, hand sliding into Harry’s for comfort in this sort of small talk, as Harry added, “Yeah, we’ve been getting a lot worse summers, to the point where we’re thinking about getting a cooling unit.”
It was...
“Are you more upset that someone tried to take her away from

He got up with a sigh, heading to the kitchen to get some tea when there was a sharp banging at the door. And then shouting. And then the hinges gave a great creak and—
And then of course, because the universe was consistently conspiring against him, came the inevitable hangover the next day as reality set in.
“That all makes sense but why would he risk the secrecy of the magical community? Being that public of a figure?”
Draco thought, miserable at his desk, watching his tea cool and staring at the letter that had just been dropped off from one of the Ministry owls.
Draco Malfoy looked at him, heard how desperate his please had sounded, and stopped struggling entirely.
“Which is why you call it Project Circumference?” Harry posited, stealing one of Draco’s gnocchi. It was a common occurrence so he didn’t even blink, but the throbbing in his head made it so he didn’t give him a half-hearted glare as he usually would. Harry didn’t notice the lack of response.
“No trouble at all,” Harry answers for them, stepping closer to Draco to fill the gap left by Weasley, “It was a rough day and I invited him so only fair we help him home.” She nods, with a hum, watching the two of them, seeming to analyze their very nature. He stood a little taller.
First order of business was to get the girl out, since she seemed to only suffer a few abrasions and perhaps a broken wrist. Better to get her secure where she wouldn’t see the rest of the damage.
Even if you drop the rate to 5% it’s still logical, which is what I went with for this series.
come with me to Harry’s office, I’ll help Harry clear this all up.” And at that, he gave a tiny smile, a hopeful one and an honest one. It wasn’t endearing, not like Harry’s were, but it was so...out of place to be directed at him that he knew that he had to see what this was, what was so important that it had made even Ronald Weasley treat Draco Malfoy with a semblance of dignity and respect.
, Draco looked up with the thought, a little startled by the green eyes staring back at him, “I hope you’ll stick around for more than just interior design.”
Weasley laughed again, loud and relaxed. How strange things were.
moment of
“And when,” he said in a slightly strangled tone, “Did we start dating?”
Draco was right. The surprise coupled with the sharp heels of his stilettos proves to be very effective. He proceeds to beat the shit out of the rapist, taking pleasure in the sickening crunch of his heel breaking as he kicks it into the side of his face. He knows that will definitely leave a nasty mark.
Harry laughs, the sound of it swallowed up by the music, but his partner sees it and returns a bright smile. Harry’s eyes sweep over him. He is attractive; young, slim build, green eyes, blonde hair, and he is dressed in tight skinny jeans with an open, button-up cotton shirt. His tanned abdominal muscles glint with sweat as he shakes his hips. Harry thinks he’s in love. They continue like this, grinding and dancing together for some time, in which Harry is just happy to be alive. It all comes to a grinding, sudden halt when Harry glimpses a flash of light brown hair in the crowd, with a facial structure that looks much too familiar. Harry feels the panic rise like bile in his throat, and he pushes at his dance partner, bends over to take deep, gulping breaths.
Nothing to do but wait now.
We are all running in a daze, trying to get a grip so that we can disapparate but we need to get ahead by at least a few seconds so we can concentrate. I'm looking back at a teammate, the one in charge, as he orders us to spread out and find safety so that we can get the hell out of dodge, when I run into something solid. I bounce back from the collision, wand bared, but quickly realize it's Potter staring up at me.
I see the shadows of someone's footsteps approaching. My body freezes, ice cold as none other than Ronald Weasley saunters into the room, a prideful look on his face. The other boy is tall and lanky, freckles dusted across his pale face in a haphazard manner. It looks as if someone tripped over with a bucket of paint and little droplets landed on his face carelessly. His red hair is pulled back into a tight bun. In another life, I might have thought he was attractive.
"Promise me that, if it comes down to it, you'll do what is necessary to end this war." The look on his face confirms that I have, indeed, ruined this moment.
His wand lights up, signaling that the incantation has worked and they have about 30 seconds before being transported to the killer's exact location. If Harry succeeded in casting correctly, the bastard shouldn't see them coming and none of his wards should stand a chance. Harry's insides are burning with anticipation. He feels the familiar tug behind his belly button and then...
“Well you know I’m still taking notes and investigating…” He trails off, smiling back at him.
“Even when he did those horrible things, I kept think- thinking of you…” His voice cracks at that statement, and for a moment he looks embarrassed at his admission.
. He was fighting against his own instincts, suffering the pain and consequences of choosing not to act on his urges,
“Ha, of course you haven’t,” Draco replies, smiling from ear to ear, looking at Harry as if he knows him better than Harry knows himself. Harry melts underneath that gaze. And as much as he is loath to admit, it’s more than likely true.
To those who have waited patiently for me to continue this story, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. This story felt like it needed a seventh chapter, so there will be one more after this one. I hope you all enjoy and thank you again for your comments and kudos!
A lump forms in my throat, preventing me from speaking any of these thoughts. Potter is rutting more recklessly now, faster and harder and with no real rhythm.
Later on, when he disapparates before my very eyes, my heart stings with the pain of it.
“Come on Harry, I know you too well for this shit. You’re going to tell me eventually. Why not now? Now seems like as good a time as any.” But damnit, Harry forgot just how convincing the fair haired man could be. Still though, the prospect of telling him about Ginny is just so unpleasant. He takes in a deep breath and shoots a pleading look at the other man.
“Come on come on
“I know, I’m sorry about that,” she starts, looks back to Draco, “You look well, Draco, I’ve heard you’re healing quite nicely.” Draco nods dumbly and takes a sip of his tea. He quickly composes himself though and addresses her directly, an air of aristocracy that only he would be able to pull off in the face of such a tense situation.
"No way!" Ron says eagerly, "let him go Gin, we need this... Alright, mate. If you get this right, tomorrow is the day!" She has no choice but to nod, fighting back the tears Harry knows she will cry later this evening. But it still won't stop her from coming to him for the sex neither of them enjoys, to chase the dream of the baby neither of them can conceive.
He finishes his chores mechanically. Laundry, dishes, bathroom tub. Then he grabs his coat and braves the cold as he walks to the nearest grocery store. He buys eggs, milk, bread, meat, and frozen vegetables. He grabs a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of rum, and, almost an afterthought, a gallon of water. The cashier rings him up with no issue. If she’s noticed that Harry buys alcohol almost daily, she doesn’t comment. Harry likes it that way. No one recognizes him here. No one cares. No one is judging, at least not outwardly, and that’s more than enough for him. He takes the brown paper bags holding his groceries and walks back to his apartment complex. The sky is grey and a cold drizzle of rain alternately falls and dissipates. Harry concentrates on his footsteps, the sounds of children playing in the nearby park, the engines of cars as they pass him on the road. It’s a short walk, and he soon finds himself at his doorstep.
Malfoy doesn’t say a word when they arrive to Harry’s apartment complex, simply follows along quietly as they make their way into his efficiency. “It’s not much, but it’s more than enough for me.” Harry says rather stiffly, opening the door and allowing Malfoy to enter first. Malfoy gives the place a cursory glance before nodding in acknowledgment at Harry. Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise, he was expecting at least some kind of derogatory remark. Malfoy works his jaw tightly, it seems he is holding something back. “I’ll just be a moment.” Harry gathers some clothing for the overnight, hoping beyond all hope that Malfoy hasn’t seen the bottles of alcohol laid out along the kitchen counter but knowing that he most likely has. There isn’t much else to look at. Thankfully, the space is at least mostly tidy. Harry thanks his regimented lifestyle for that.
Ah. So that makes sense. Of course there were no Wizarding children missing because Dresden didn’t go after them. He was taking Muggles. Which only serves to confuse Harry even more, if that’s even possible. Why did Dresden need a Wizard for one part of the ritual but then Muggle children for another?
"It's 2:00am, mate..." Harry looks up to see Ron standing in front of him. He looks just as tired as Harry feels. He hands Harry a cup of coffee and takes the seat next to him. Harry takes a sip. It's cold, but it will do.
Harry receives a message from St. Mungo’s as promised, letting him know that he can officially visit Draco. When he arrives, the Mediwitch updates him on his progress and answers his questions calmly. “Yes, Draco did well during the procedure,” and, “no he isn’t awake yet, he is under a medically induced coma due to the pain,” and, “we can’t say for certain, but his vitals do look promising,” and finally, “The last time Mungo’s ever treated a patient for this type of ritual was almost 100 years ago, and although they didn’t survive, medicinal magic has really come a long way since then. We were able to modify the procedure and increase chances of survival.” To which, Harry nods clinically. He thinks back to a little over a month ago, the hope and excitement he had felt in this very same wing of the hospital, the happiness at being able to take Draco out on a ‘sort of date.’ He swallows back the lump in his throat and thanks the Mediwitch before entering Draco’s room, closing the door behind him with a soft click.
“That explains a lot. How long have you known?”
He cuts her off then, much too angry. "You know that isn't true. I finally have a lead-"
“Oh uh…yes, for now.” Harry says awkwardly.
The sound of someone entering the room snaps me out of my desperation. I brace myself for whatever will happen next. It's him. The relief hits me like a crashing wave.
"Okay, then you'll be fine without a drink for the next 24 hours, right? I'll tell you what, if you can go for that amount of time without a drink or a pill, which you'll be hard pressed to find here anyway, you're free to go."
"She came to our aide in the final battle. She blamed V-V- the dark lord for your death....she wanted revenge. But it's enough for her to possibly be pardoned as well."
"Yeah." Malfoy says, and he looks tired to Harry, a man who is worried and dare he think it, afraid. But none of this is making sense.
“Harry.” Harry awakes in a tangled knot of sweat soaked limbs and blanket. He gasps for air, unceremoniously untangling himself before searching around for his glasses. His heart is pounding in his ears so loudly that he barely registers the voice of the person sitting next to him.
“I watched myself
"I would really like that...
Harry says, bouncing from one foot to the other, as Draco rummages through his expanded wardrobe of clothes to find something to wear. Narcissa had brought it to him. It was charmed to shrink or expand as needed. He scoffs at Harry, but it’s halfhearted, followed by a genuine smile, one that melts Harry’s heart once again.  He finally decides on a set of light blue robes, gives Harry an odd look until Harry turns away from him so he could change.
“Okay, then kindly do move out of the way. I want to see my son.” She tells him. There is a glint in her eyes that makes him think maybe she is joking, but the way the mediwitch is glancing at them nervously makes him think she isn’t.
“I’m glad you like it,” Harry answers, and then returns to his silent fidgeting for a few more minutes.
“It felt like hours before he finally came barreling through the front door. And he- he had a child with him.” Draco looks away, blinking back tears. He begins to shake. Harry is unsure how to proceed. He doesn’t know what Draco needs. He used to know, but now he can’t be sure anymore. He doesn’t think he should try touching him again, not while he is remembering that. He doesn’t struggle for too long though, as after a moment, Draco steels himself and begins talking again.
Draco lets him this time.
“Thank you for not judging me on this,” Draco tells him sincerely, “Or thinking any less of me.” Harry says nothing, overtaken by the emotion of it all, and Draco continues, “I know it’s not right to want to sleep the way he made me sleep for so long against my will, but I just don’t feel okay otherwise. Tilda says it has something to do with what’s called ‘survivor’s guilt,’ meaning some part of me feels I don’t deserve to sleep on a bed when all those kids can never sleep on a bed again. And as I’ve had some time to really process things, I’m beginning to learn that she is absolutely right.”
“Why?” The words leave Harry’s lips before he has the chance to consider whether he really wants to know the answer.
"Potter!" I hiss, "They’ll see you, please!" My eyes plead with him. He just needs to attack, it can be the stupidest spell and I won't dodge it. I'll take one for the team but he needs to just fucking
"Yeah," Ron begins, "he doesn't seem to care about the specifics of how and why....he's just happy to have one of his best Aurors found alive. We're being heralded as heroes, Harry. It's bloody fantastic, isn't it?"
He knows what he needs to do.
"Draco Malfoy, you are under arrest by order of the Ministry..." Someone is saying in the background.
“He aimed his wand at me and I felt this pain in my arm, and that’s when I saw that I was bleeding. He collected my blood in a cup and then healed me. The child – he was a little boy, and I remember his face so clearly. He must have been 8 or 9 – he was so scared. He just kept looking at me with this fear in his eyes and then-“ Draco shuts his eyes, breathes in deep, places his hands over his face in despair.
“It was the curse.” Harry answers, “And I’m glad you’ve come to your senses.” He smiles earnestly before planting a kiss on Draco’s forehead. Draco tucks his head into the crook of Harry’s shoulder and neck, breathes him in, and speaks, his lips and eyelashes touching skin ever so slightly.
, sitting on the floor, chained to a tiny corner of the living room. He is emaciated, with dark circles under his eyes, and long blonde hair that reaches down past his shoulders, but he is
His teeth sink into my collar bone and I can't help the moan that rips out of me. My wrists are pinned above my head by his hands, and his body is pressed flush against mine. He bucks into me, groaning as his tongue licks the bite wound he has just created. I am drunk with his scent and his warmth and his taught hardness against me. I live for these moments. This is what helps me get by on the days where it gets to be too much.
With a pop, the world swirls with color and sound as we disapparate- together- for the very first time.
“It didn’t start out as something I wanted,” Kingsley begins, “Dresden was an old family friend. I knew him when I was a child. He saved my life when I was still in diapers. I owed him. So when he approached me, even though he was long vanished from the Wizarding world, I had no choice, the oath magic ran deep within me.” Kingsley’s eyes seek connection with Harry’s but he doesn’t grant the man so much as a glance in his direction. Shacklebolt plunges onward, as if this is a story he had been wanting to tell, as if a weight is being lifted from his shoulders.
When it’s over, and Harry stands to follow his best friend out of the holding cell, Shacklebolt says his name in a low and treacherous tone. Harry turns stonily to look down at the man, eyes glaring absolute daggers at him, and waits for him to say whatever it is he has left to say.
“Draco,” Harry says calmly, choosing not to jump to any conclusions and allow the other man to explain, “What exactly is going on here?” Draco chooses this exact moment to fall apart. He crumples to the ground, fists pressed up against his eyes as he cries openly.
“Ron helped so much with finding Dresden…with saving you, you know that, right?” Harry says to him, suddenly feeling like maybe he needed to discuss some things with his best friend. It’s possible that Harry is in over his head, at this point.
Our first kiss is fierce and passionate and everything that I have ever imagined it would be. We moan and pant into each other’s mouths, hands touching whatever skin we can reach. Minutes go by before he breaks the kiss, a wild look in his eyes.
He is not in the kitchen, the drawing room, nor the guest bathroom. So that only leaves the bedroom. Why would Draco go to the bedroom without Harry? He buries that thought, gaining confidence as he walks over to the bedroom door and grasps the handle. It isn’t locked, and it opens with a soft ‘click’ as Harry peers into the darkness. He just barely makes out the outline of Draco sleeping on the ground in the corner of his room, covered loosely by a blanket, head resting on a large, fluffy pillow. Harry swallows back the acid in his throat and shuts the door quietly. He fumbles his way back to the couch and falls back into a restless sleep.
, someone does come for me, my heart sinks. It’s an Auror, and not Potter. I notice it's the same female one that initially interrogated me. She looks a little sad, which frightens me, but smiles softly when she enters my cell.
“Da-da! Da-wakey!” Albus bursts through the door of the house, stumble-running in the way that only a toddler ever could. He barrels into Harry’s arms with a dramatic “umph!” Harry can’t help but laugh as he picks his son up and spins him around in the air. Ginny is not too far behind, dusting snow from her coat before stepping into the house. She is smiling as she watches the exchange.
"Well Potter, now you know everything. Hence," I wave my arms around as if introducing myself to him for the very first time, "monster." I finish lamely. I try to play it off but deep down I'm terrified that he will decide I'm too fucked up, I've done too many horrible things for him to possibly still love me.
she gave me when I was confused, the way she placed her hand on her belly with pity… And then…all I get is this letter? With a few words on it?” She shows him the crumpled paper, holds it like it is the most offensive thing in the world.
"Harry...I know he was your partner, and I know you want justice for him. But do you think he would have wanted to see you like this? Beating yourself up, obsessing over this case, having nightmares almost every night....Do you think he would have wanted you to be in this much pain for this long?"
He opens his wardrobe and grabs a pair of jeans and black t-shirt, dresses himself quickly. Harry grabs his coat and makes his way out, without even a glance at the mirror. His hair will do what it pleases, no sense in bothering. The sun is already setting, the sky partially illuminated with swirls of soft pinks and oranges mixed in with the grey. It’s freezing, so Harry wraps his coat around himself tightly. It’s fully dark before he reaches his destination, most of the streets and sidewalk are empty until he hits the main road he searches for. The artificial lights of streetlamps shine much too bright as Harry walks, head bowed, focusing only on his feet as they shuffle on the sidewalk.
She smiles, almost apologetically. Her eyes flicker to his forehead, where his scar lies hidden underneath his fringe.
“Yes but if I had known that you didn’t have a choice-“
"Harry?" I nod. "Well he...that is to say..." Oh no. I can't bear this. Why is she hesitating?
"She does now, yes."
Unfortunately, he has reached a bunch of dead ends in this case so far. No one else knows anything about Dresden, or they remain tight lipped, and although Arthur at one point did know of him, he never actually knew him personally outside of those times when he tried to reach out to see Annie as a baby. It’s frustrating and confusing, and Harry is tired of lying to Ron every time he comes round asking for updates. And although Arthur promised not to tell Ginny about her connection to Dresden, Harry is not sure that he can realistically keep that promise much longer. He knows he needs to bite the bullet but the entire thing is just so unpleasant. They’ve spoken maybe ten words total to each other this past week, and Harry has been resigned to the couch becoming his new permanent bed.
“I’m not asking you for anything, Harry, I just want you to know that we can’t continue our relationship this way. I think you should really take some time to think about whether or not you’re happy with your life as it stands. Make a decision that isn’t just because you feel like I’m forcing you to, but a decision that is for yourself more so than for us.”
"Fuck's sake!" He yells, grabbing a towel and opening the blasted machine. He pulls the now overly burnt toast out and slams the oven door shut, then unplugs it from the wall. He grabs a knife and starts scraping the burnt part from the toast. A ring on his cell phone draws his attention away from his futile attempts at rescuing breakfast. "Shit." He says again, answers the phone, "Hi Darlene! Oh yes, I was going to call, I've had a family emergency and won't be able to come in today. So sorry, yes I know it's last minute. Yes, Yes, I appreciate it. Thank you, really." He hangs the phone up and turns back to the catastrophe of a meal he has tried to prepare before groaning in frustration.
I am flabbergasted. So many emotions are exploding within me at once. I open my mouth to speak, shut it, and open it again only to leave my jaw hanging there in complete shock. It is all suddenly becoming clear to me. Potter risked everything for me. Even after finding out the truth about what I've done, he felt I was worthy of saving. Even though it meant compromising his own safety and the possibility of finally defeating Voldemort, he wanted to make sure I would be okay no matter what.
"Does she know I'm alive?"
wasn’t sure what I was going to Apparate into,” he breathes, inhaling the scent of sandalwood and sweat on Draco’s skin, “this is definitely much better than what I had imagined. You certainly can hold your own. Now where is he?” Draco sags into him, squeezing his back with his hands and holding on tightly. He kisses the juncture at Harry’s neck and shoulder gently before pulling away. He hands Harry his wand demurely. Harry takes it from him, holding back a chuckle. It would be really inappropriate to chuckle, although completely justifiable given how adorable Draco is being in this moment.
"Okay, I'll walk you out." His blonde acquaintance replies. Harry opens his mouth to protest but finds it hard to form any words. He tries to shake his head instead, but it feels too heavy, so he moves to stand. He finds himself swaying, and alarm bells are now beginning to sound off in his mind. This isn't right.
“I need more,” Harry gasps, pushing Draco down onto his back and sliding down his body, kissing the trail of hair there before taking Draco into his mouth in one fluid motion. Draco cries out in surprise, hands tangling shakily into Harry’s hair as Harry sucks him down as far as his throat allows. His own cock is thick with arousal, and Harry quells the urge to touch himself, choosing instead to thrust against Draco’s leg fervently. Draco is making the most erotic sounds as he bucks wildly into Harry’s mouth, and it’s almost too much for Harry to take. He feels Draco’s hands pushing at his shoulders until Harry relents and slides his mouth off of Draco with a delicate ‘pop.’
"You..." An animalistic cry escapes my mouth before I have the chance to stop it. "How could you?!" I am furious. My body begins to shake with rage as angry tears threaten to spill over.
This is not good. I recognize the insignia on this hut wall all too well. My legs are completely asleep and I struggle for a few seconds to breathe. Sheer panic. That is the only way to describe what I am feeling in this moment.
When Harry wakes up again, he is alone on the couch. He feels clean and dry, and he is covered by a thick, warm blanket. He is wearing a pair of boxers that he recognizes as Draco’s. His glasses are lying on the coffee table next to him, along with a glass of water. He gulps the water down gratefully and looks around, trying hard not to feel completely bereft at Draco’s absence. Deciding that this is not the time for subtlety, Harry gets to his feet and pads softly around the flat, looking for the man in question.
“Why didn’t you tell me, Harry?” Ginny is crying so hard that she has to blow her nose on the napkin that Harry had laid out for her earlier.
The only thing that will put Harry’s mind at ease now is solving the case once and for all. So he decides to make that his main priority, despite the fact that he has exhausted all avenues of investigation and has no idea where to go from here. He knows he is probably too close to this, and he should just divulge all of his research to another Auror. But his gut is telling him that he is the one who needs to finish this. He trusts Draco so much, despite his strange behaviors and coping mechanisms, no matter how alarming they are. The part of him that is an Auror has made Draco a prime suspect, which pains Harry down to his very core. He vows to investigate and find out the truth, regardless of how painful that truth might be. The only thing Harry can think to do is to go back to the cottage where he and Ron found Draco. Aurors already investigated for evidence, but maybe there will be something that was missed, or at the very least, some source of inspiration.
His cock, thick and hard, presses harshly into my own but it isn't enough. Potter senses this and begins to undo my trousers. I undo his and his prick pops free. He wraps his hands around both of our man hoods before thrusting again. I see stars as the pleasure rakes through me. I can barely stand the sight of him, pupils blown wide in arousal and face twisted in pleasure so strong he almost looks pained.
“I’ve already scoured every piece of literature I could get my hands on. I can’t find anything either.”
“You’re stalling.” Draco points out determinedly. Well yeah, that’s true, Harry thinks, and he can go with that. As long as Draco doesn’t realize the reason behind the stalling, it should be fine. “Harry, I know it’s difficult with the er…conflict of interest and all. I’d understand if you want to leave out this lead in your notes.” Draco is pulling away from him, turning away and walking back to the loveseat, all stiff muscles and tightened jawbones. Harry doesn’t like the look of it, and he feels unexpectedly bereft and cold at Draco’s absence.
"I saw what happened. I know you want to join our side." Potter finishes taking off his cloak and stands tall in front of me. His eyes are piercing and his hair tangles wildly around his ears. He is all toned muscles and tanned skin. He looks beautiful. I swallow at the intruding thought before blinking away from him.
Friday night is pub night. He and Ron and a few of their other guy friends meet up to drink and talk about nonsense. His mind wanders the entire time, but he still manages to smile and nod and laugh at the appropriate times. He has it down to a science, and really, only those closest to him would be able to tell that he is still hurting, that he hasn’t moved on. He comes home too late and much too drunk, which causes a fight between him and Ginny when his dick doesn’t manage to get hard enough for them to have sex. They fight about the same things; Harry’s inability to move on, his flaws, all the things he does wrong. She looks at him with so much hurt, casts a sobering charm on him, and fucks him mechanically without a word. He barely looks at her, keeps his eyes closed and focuses on what it feels like so he doesn’t disappoint her
"Avada Kedavra!" He watches the life drain from Augustus's shocked face. His veins are thrumming with energy as he slowly comes down from his high. Yes, this feels just as good as he has dreamt for so long. This is perfect, this very moment right here-
"Umm....sir?" He tries again, feels like an idiot for using the word "sir," and then decides to shake him rather violently. If this guy has been drugged, it's going to take a bit of work to bring him back to consciousness. The lightning bolt scar revealed under heavy fringe is like a jolt of electricity to his nerve endings, and he jerks back, hitting his head against the window of the driver's seat.
“Just spit it out, Potter.” Draco tells him, rubbing at his temples. He looks tired and worn down again suddenly.
"Draco," he gasps, "fuck, I'm gonna cum..." I feel the hot spurts of liquid as his cock twitches in my fist. A few more thrusts and I fall apart on top of him.
“Smells good, Draco!” Ron says, patting his belly with anticipation.
"Okay," I say, "I want to join your side." I raise the sleeve on my left arm and show him my dark mark. I let out a sound that is not quite a sob but something close to it. He doesn't look surprised or bothered or even slightly upset.
“You knew all this time, Mione? And you didn’t say anything to me?” Ron bellows from behind them, the first words he has spoken since he arrived.
But it’s not that simple, is it? Harry risks losing everything the moment he decides to leave Ginny. He loses his best friends, the family of redheads that have adopted him into their hearts and home, and the wife that he still loves in his own way, even if that love stopped being romantic a long time ago. So Harry simply says nothing, and both men sit in tense silence for a little while.
who takes their tea that way. And he is filled with shame as he vanishes the cup to the sink. He fills another cup with the hot liquid and adds a splash of milk.
“Amazing,” he tells her, “she’ll be coming any minute now, huh?” He asks. Hermione beams up at him.
“Ginny!” Harry says, taken aback.
“I need to get out of here.” He croaks, wiping sweat from his brow. His eyes sweep the crowd again, but he can’t seem to find what he had seen just seconds before.
“Mmmm! So good, Draco!” Molly praises, and Draco seems to relax the last bits of tension in his shoulders. Everyone joins in to praise him, earning a genuine smile from Draco as his eyes meet Harry’s. Harry nods at him before leaning in to kiss him softly on the lips. Once everyone has a full plate and has begun eating, Harry tucks into his own meal, moaning appreciatively at the taste. Draco’s hand is on his knee, warm and comforting as he gives him a gentle squeeze. He lets the merry chatter going on around him lull him into a blissful state of calm as he enjoys the meal.
“Rare blood disorder.” Draco finishes darkly.
Chapter 3: The Pounding Sound
“Harry,” Arthur says curiously, “Why have you got a picture of Augustus Dresden sticking out of your robes pocket?”
“I’m actually here on official Auror business.” He tells her apologetically. “I can’t divulge too much information, but I was hoping I could ask you a few things about Annie.” Mary looks surprised but nods her head and begins to lead him toward her office, heels clinking even louder as she walks with purpose.  Once seated inside of her rather spacious office, Harry pulls out his photograph of Dresden.
"And your friends?" I ask. He blanches at me. I don't even know if he considers them his friends anymore.
"Do you uhm...remember what happened?" I ask him.
Their erections slide against each other hotly, the pleasure shooting down Harry’s spine in sharp currents. He places his hands firmly on Draco’s chest and then exerts just enough pressure so that Draco begins to move backward. Getting the hint, Draco continues to move, pulling Harry along with him until the backs of his legs bump up against the couch. Harry pushes him down onto it before straddling his lap wantonly and pressing his mouth against Draco’s neck. He licks his way down the blonde’s collarbone and then makes contact with his right nipple, relishing in the sharp intake of breath, and the way Draco tightens his hands around Harry’s hips. All the while, they are rocking against each other, creating a friction that is at once too much and yet not enough. Draco slides his hands downward over Harry’s buttocks and grabs him firmly, aiding him in rocking against him while his mouth nibbles at his exposed shoulder.
He chokes back tears, tries to be reassuring, but inside he is fuming. But Merlin Dresden was such a
"I love you." Potter breathes the words into my ear, his stubble tickling the side of my face, breath hot against my neck. We've just finished having sex for the very first time. It was messy and awkward, and although we were both nervous wrecks, it was the most amazing moment of my life.
“You and the Weaslette probably have a little one by now? Or at least one on the way?” Draco says politely. It seems disingenuous, pained almost.
“No peeking, Potter,” Draco jokes, and Harry chuckles lightly. He finds that it is quite difficult, actually, not to peek, but does his best to remain respectful. He doesn’t want to do anything to fuck up this sort of peaceful thing they have going on. He enjoys that Draco is smiling at him and joking with him, and he desperately wants the other man to just be happy. It almost feels like…
Harry can feel himself relaxing. He makes his way to the bartender and orders a strong drink, eyes skimming the crowd for a familiar face. The man he searches for is standing off in a corner, shrouded in shadow. He leans against the wall, watching the crowd, his dark, spiked hair glinting with shiny gel in the distance. Harry smiles, paying the bartender before making his way through the crowd. The throng of writhing bodies seems to ebb and flow around him, hands and body parts pressing onto him as he squeezes through with purpose. The dark haired man smiles, sickly sweet down at him, brown eyes flashing as his hand reaches into his black leather jacket pocket.
“Okay mama!” Harry is floored for a moment at how beautiful Draco is, the silver in his eyes matching the silver of the tinsel as they sparkle with mirth. The connection he has with Albus is so much more than Harry could have ever dreamed. He remembers the way Draco took him into his arms one night and told him that he’d always wanted a kid, and that it couldn’t get any better than a little mini Potter running amuck. The flood of emotion gives way to the frazzled nerves, stomach lurching with butterflies as he fingers Draco’s Christmas gift in his pocket.
Harry leaves under the strict instruction that they send him a message as soon as Draco is ready to take visitors. He chokes back his tears, willing himself to stay calm. What he wants to do is shrink down into a ball and hug himself tightly on the ground, safe and warm in Draco’s blankets. The flat looks barren and messy and so unlike the way Draco would usually keep it. Harry feels panic rising within him, wills it to go away, so that he can have the strength to move forward. Kingsley has not moved from his spot on the chair in their shared bedroom. He shuts the door with a soft click and stands in the middle of the living room, wondering what he should do next. All of the gusto has seemed to rush out of him like air from a balloon. He just feels defeated now. None of this matters if Draco doesn’t come out of this okay.
It feels like hours have passed before my cell door opens, the light hurting my eyes as it filters in. It's Potter, of course. He walks over and gets down on his knees before me.
, Malfoy?" Harry finds his voice, and although it's hoarse, he is pretty proud at how intimidating he still manages to sound. Malfoy doesn't flinch, however, but he does stop his movements, standing stiffly a few feet away from the bed.
Harry gave a small, sad smile as a few tears leaked from the corner of his eyes.
“Harry, did I do something to upset you without realizing I did?” He quietly asked.
Just then, another familiar face popped up in the open door. “Hi, Harry, Draco.” Hermione greeted as she entered the compartment. She sat in the seat opposite them. “Have a nice honeymoon?”
“You have to eat something.” The other said as he picked up a piece of toast and took a bite.
“Do you want me to?” Draco asked warily. “I thought it would freak you out sleeping in the same bed with another guy.”
sorry if it scared you but that wasn’t a hurt scream. It was a good scream, a really,
“Harry?” Draco asked a few minutes later.
“Does Ginny know what?” Harry asked

“When I was taken to the station, I hysterically explained that I had a son who I was supposed to be picking up soon. They told me not to worry about it and that someone would get him.
“I- I never thanked you, for-for last night. So um… thank you, Draco.” Harry said shyly.
Not a moment later, a pair of familiar hands was around one of his and coaxing it out of the tight fist it was in.
Almost immediately he heard, “Quiet down up there!”
He turned around to see Draco standing above him, his arms crossed and a triumphant look on his face. Harry tackled him and they both tumbled through the mounds of snow for a moment only to stop with Draco on top of him.
“Harry?” The blonde said softly. The response he received was Harry burying his face in his hands and sobbing harder. Draco looked pleadingly at Madam Pomfrey and she seemed to understand what he needed.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He replied. “I’m just happy. Really, really happy.” He suddenly yawned. “And maybe a little tired.”
Suddenly, the hand on the back of his head pushed him all the way down the hard cock and, without warning, started coming. Draco moaned Harry’s name as the smaller man wrenched his head back.
Eric’s not that stupid though. He’ll probably figure it out the first night we’re together and then make me kill it.
“Language!”
“Right. Do you think I could get some bandages first?” They both looked at his knees that were still oozing a bit of blood.
Harry was still looking at Draco but he quickly looked down as he answered. “I- I got in a fight with Ron.” He stammered.
A pale hand came to rest on Harry's belly. “About the time I wrote you, I started getting fluttery feelings. Now they’re becoming pretty solid kicks. Dr-Draco…” Both boys looked up from the baby bump into each other’s eyes, tears flooding the green ones. “I don’t want it to die.”
“Wait a second, what was that?” Draco noticed something glinting in Scorpius’ dark hair when the light from Harry’s wand had passed over his head.
Labor seemed to be going much faster than what was normal and even though he had been warned it could, and most likely would, happen that way, he was on the edge of panicking again.
Just like the first time, Harry stayed perfectly still as a foreign tongue explored his mouth. Eric had been happy with this reaction for a while, but after over a month of kisses, the man would appear frustrated when he pulled away. He never said anything, but Harry still knew he was getting angry about it.
“Okaaay.” Harry said and then asked, “Is something wrong?”
Narcissa pulled her son into a tight hug. “I don’t care about that as long as you can still give me grandchildren someday.” She said and kissed his forehead.
“With you?” Harry asked hopefully.
Auntie Hermione
You’re exhausted.” Draco insisted as he took his arm back to hold his son.
“Ok. I love you, Daddy.” The three year old whispered and snuggled further into bed.
What a joyous occasion it is.
“You left. You don’t care about me at all.” Harry sobbed into his pillow. He felt the bed dip under Draco's weight and a hand start to comfortingly rub his back.
“Th-that… that’s just my nephew, who
both look very pretty.”
“Harry, does he feel warm to you?” Draco
Every so often, he’d pull back far enough that the head of his cock would push against Harry's entrance when he slid forward again. Each time this happened, a small gasp would escape Harry, each one louder than the one before it.

“It’s very nice to meet you, Harry, and please, call me Narcissa.” She said kindly before giving her son a stern look. “Why did you not tell me that Harry Potter was the boy you’ve been seeing?”
Harry however, had woken up the moment the blonde’s hand went around his prick. He continued to feign sleep though to see what his boyfriend was going to do to him.
toddler nodded. “You want some more medicine?”
Cockily, Draco replied, “I never would have guessed a Gryffindor could act like that, let alone a virgin Gryffindor.” Glancing down on the second ‘Gryffindor’, he noticed blue and bronze where red and gold should be. If he wasn’t confused before, he was now. “You’re giving me a headache.”
“Of course it’s necessary.” The werewolf replied with a slight growl. “Harry has been through a terrible ordeal and needs help to recover.”

“Don’t just stare at it. Sit, lay, jump on it if you’d like. It won’t leak.” Draco said amusedly.
Several minutes later Harry had finally cried himself out and he sat up so he could kiss his loving boyfriend. As the kiss went on, they could both feel the effect it had on the other.
“Harry, you can be comfy and warm in a bed.” Draco said. “We don’t want you falling asleep in here and drowning.”

When he was done setting up his

“Trop?”
Before he could react, Harry found a pair of lips pressed to his and a sly tongue pushing its way into his mouth. For several seconds, the muscle wandered his mouth until his lack of response convinced the man to pull away.
“Hi, Daddy.” She whispered as she walked into the room.
“Is that really necessary? You seem just fine to me.” Sirius said, earning him an elbow in the ribs from Remus.

The blonde quickly climbed out of the pool sized bathtub, hurried across the room and grabbed a few fluffy, white towels off a shelf. He wrapped one around his own waist before going over to help Harry out and get them all dried off.
straightened herself up, which included a quick cleaning charm.
“Push, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, push.” Ordered Healer Carter, the same healer who’d delivered baby James just a year and a half ago.
“Hey! One at a time, please.”
Harry squeaked and moved his arms
Draco watched the man sitting

Harry turned onto his back and smiled up at his boyfriend. Then he wrapped his arms around the other’s neck and kissed him soundly.
“I’m a little sore,” Scorpius started, “But that was awesome.”
“Really?” Harry turned and looked down at himself. He was wearing sweatpants and an over-sized sweater Molly had given him at the baby shower. Harry actually thought he looked a little dumpy.
Once the pain passed, Harry calmed down some and apologized for yelling at him.
Every so often though, Harry would
“Hurry up, boy.” An angry voice shouted from a short distance away.
Harry nodded his understanding.
More gasps and two more women fainted.
After some time, it became clear that this kiss was different. It had already lasted twice as long as the others and the man seemed to be putting more into it than usual.
With another deep breath Harry began:
“What are you going to do about it?” The Malfoy patriarch asked.
“This is my wife, Petunia, and my son, Dudley.” The man said as he entered the kitchen.
“Do NOT come in here!”
“Nooo.” Scorpius whined when the hand was taken away. He nearly screamed a moment later when a hot mouth descended around his erection. “Holy fuuuck.”
“Harry!” He exclaimed as he stepped around the privacy screen and ran to his side. He pushed Harry's fringe off of his sweaty forehead and kissed it. “Harry.” He repeated softly.
quick smile for warning him and then frowned when she looked away again.
hate you. If you don’t want to speak to him though, you don’t have to. And don’t worry about anything he might say. He’s not quite stupid enough to say something in front of your brothers and sisters. I’m going to talk to him about it tonight so we’re all on the same page. Ok?”
“Fourth floor, please,” she replied.
“If you don’t get up, I’ll get a glass of water to pour on you.” The blonde teasingly threatened.
Harry suddenly broke the silence with a groan and whined, “I was almost asleep.”

It was Tuesday, classes had just started up again after Christmas Holiday the day before and Harry had been confined to their rooms as he was ready to pop any day. The only thing that made it slightly better, was the fact that he wasn’t in the hospital wing.

The healer passed the newborn off to the so far silent nurse as he moved to cut the umbilical. “Care to do the honors?” He asked of Ethan and offered a pair of clippers.
Before, he could have waited for his family to return home. He could have waited for Draco to find him like this, but now, now he needed to get to the hospital.
“Yes, and about that,” He turned toward Draco, “I’ve only heard mention of fathers, plural, nothing about a mother. Care to explain?”
“Is he coming tomorrow?” Eric asked next.
“I’m sorry.” Harry said looking away from the silvery eyes that were watching him curiously.
A moment later Harry's entire body stiffened as he came with Draco's name on his lips. The sound of his name and the sight of Harry coming pushed Draco over the edge without further stimulation.
“I think it’s time to go to sleep now.” Draco said as he pulled the blanket tighter around them.
“Congratulations Mr. Potter-Malfoy, Mr. Wood, it’s a girl.” Healer Carter announced as he held the small bundle of joy, still connected to Scorpius by the umbilical cord, up for both men to see.

“What happened?” Harry asked as he pulled Draco into his arms.
Nodding in agreement, Harry picked up baby Scorpius, held him tightly to his chest and stood up from the floor. “It’s your bedtime, little mister.” He softly said to the dark mop of hair snuggling into his shirt.
“Thank you.” They replied together.
“Thank you. What would you like to know first?” Draco asked as he started wiping up the semi-dried blood.

Harry shook his head weakly before looking up at the blonde man, a small amount of confusion written on his face. “Love?”
“Leave me alone!” Harry said in a hoarse voice.
“What the hell is antiseptic?” He asked as he looked at the item with a fair amount of confusion.
Harry rushed to his hysterical husband’s side and gently, but firmly, held his face in both hands.
“Harry, dear, you’re falling asleep in your eggs.” Narcissa vocally noted.

Trying to keep his eyes off the other boy’s naked torso, Scorpius shrugged. “I don’t know. Listen to music, maybe.”
Draco nearly laughed. He should’ve known it would be something as simple as that.

. I’m powerful and it’ll be more likely he can get me pregnant; something I didn’t even know was possible until he told me!
“Noooo.” Harry whined. “I don’t want to move. I’m comfy and warm here.”
“Hell, yes.” He growled as he ground his erection against her hip and smashed their lips back together.
“You’re in the headmaster’s office Mr. Weasley.” Professor McGonagall replied sternly. “We have a few questions we need to ask you and we would greatly appreciate your full cooperation.”
Now, he was not one to believe in auras or extrasensory perception, that was more Pansy’s current realm, but the entire room felt like grief. It was a heavy, thick feeling that started pulling his thoughts away from the present and into the past. How on
It was quiet around them, just the sound of rustling trees and chill breezes rolling through London.
And yet...
“Thanks,” the blond replied, a useless pleasantry and he stood up to face fate. He didn’t want any of this but he would be damned if he didn’t face it will the all the dignity he could possess.
The woman responsible for saving their skins was
Now that he knew how those hands felt (on his arm, on his wrist, barely tracing past the numb tattoo) and how under the smell of whiskey and rain there was only Harry (something incomprehensible to human language) and how every now and then Harry would be caught staring and laugh out of joy (the way his eyes would crinkle, the dimple that appeared, the unrestrained laughter), he was certain that no one else had ever felt these emotions so forcefully. No one until him and now he was dealing with the afterthought of them in the cold light of the foggy morning.
“You forget, America is much larger with a much higher population of people, it stands to reason that they’d have a higher number of witches and wizards.”
“Yes.
Blaise’s eyes widened as he stared back at Draco, his stylish purple blazer at the perfect angle across his gray silk dress shirt, his shoes shined and far ahead of the fashion curve as he rested on the edge of Draco’s desk.
“And she cleared her background checks better than we did!” Harry clamped his mouth shut,
“Maybe I will. Maybe I will... God, you’re so arrogant— Maybe this is the better option, after all together we didn’t sail through the background check. Together. Separately yes but together no. And if you’re going to talk about children that way, like they’re property and something to put a name on just as
It should have changed his world, the thought of being in love, but this was real life and not a book. Instead, Draco spent his winter as he had previous: he visited his mother, they visited his father’s grave, while the snow lashed at their rosy cheeks and it was less worse that’s he was expecting but no better considering the news. He spent the appropriate amount of time at the firm’s Christmas party before begging off to get drunk very pointedly
“Me too. Until I found this. Made it an easy decision to move here.”

“Come here often?” And that made him almost laugh, helpless to it and relieved.
“Unless we found out you’re secretly hiding contraband in your house,” John snarked. They all laughed at some shared joke, from a case Draco didn’t remember hearing of.
“Can you describe as to the reason why?” He knows, objectively, why they need to ask. They need to know if he’s been into anything that could cause undo harm to a child.
The silence in the flat was deafening, as if they could see the physical destruction around them had scattered all life from it. Stop all the clocks, stop the barking of the dogs and stop even the turn of the earth itself. They stood at this precipice, both knowing there was no good ahead.

He turned it off.
Harry just raised an eyebrow, “If I
or was she
On the counter sat two Mars Bars, a packet of crisps, and something called a Toblerone, which Draco was most intrigued to try, considering it came wrapped in a fancy gold box. Above him, the light flickered the way that all Muggle lights did and he tried to will it to stop, rather than complain about it, as he had before in the last corner shop they visited.
wait,
Then there was the linguistics of the country—they called their muggles Unenchanted, the term apparently new in the last 60 years. Before that, all of the texts seemed to use the words Wandless, but that had fallen into a bit of a faux pas, being that indigenous populations (a word combination he had never seen before) tended to forgo traditional wands to do their magic. Sometimes they called them Giftless too, that word was littered in, with healthy skepticism in Hermione’s print.
Which is why the next morning, they caught a teary Rebecca as she tried to escape the hospital, clutching one of Harry’s terrible sweatshirts in her hands (this one was advertising some sort of Natural History museum from Germany) and being chased by an old woman in mourning black and the head Auror and head medi-witch.
“We don’t—”
Also I don't get soap operas and couldn't figure out when and what reruns come on so I just picked a safe one. It's artistic liberty???
“Well, it looks like your....” she hesitated and the room got a bit quiet again, “Your daughter is fine, a bit scuffed up but it seems she avoided the worst of it—“
“How does this relate to me?”
“You yourself said it was a war, there were no casualties caused by you?” Draco was about to shake his head but he remembered the fire. The flying spells. The falling rubble. It came in flashes, like remembering a nightmare.
it’s a saccharine story, all about finding love and being kind and
Harry! Gods, you think every child is you—” he stumbled over his next words, seeing the color drain from Harry’s face. “S-She would have been fine without us.” He swallowed hard, copying the Boy Who Lived’s gesture. Lived. Survived.
Thanks much to everyone who has read and enjoyed this!!!
Harry laughed, but not in a mocking way, in the breathless sort of happy way, where he made Draco feel like he was a hero for being a part of it, for causing that bit of joy. “I could handle it too,” he told him, quickly kissing his cheek before tugging him along, heading up the street.
“You were a
“You know,” Harry moved slightly closer to him to avoid running into the group of school girls who were distracted by a window display of summer dresses and bikinis, all chattering away, “When you put like, a Mars bar or a lion bar into the freezer and eat it once its frozen.” He didn’t move back for a second, but then the sticky heat was palpable and he had to maintain their previous distance.
“Yeah, from the case file information, all the way to the case law and the other side’s lawyer,” he answered back, finally stopping the clicking and dropping the pen to the table on top of them. It was starting to get annoying, even as a new sound to Draco.
Sometimes it was impersonal pieces of memory: “Here’s that place where Hermione met with her parents again,” or “The Knight Bus almost ran over an old woman here,” which he had coupled with a rakish grin, his warm brown skin dimpling as he waited for Draco to laugh and more often then not, roll his eyes. Other times, it was more personal, and completely unrelated to what they were seeing: “The only memory I have of my parents is the sound of my mother trying to save me, screaming for my life to be spared,” or, “That scar on my hand is from Umbridge and her blood quill.” It was hard telling, at first, what Draco should say or not say. Often, he would say nothing, trying to understand. Sometimes, he couldn’t help but lash out, angry and vengeful at enemies that no longer existed, except in the nightmares they both had. Harry would say nothing, and sigh, in that long heavy way that reminded him of very old men.
The feelings within him, particularly as they passed November and headed full tilt into December were always mixed. Part of him was deeply, secretly, relieved that he didn’t need to handle his father in his post-trail life. Maybe it was wrong to feel that way; mostly because he could vividly remember the time where his father’s opinion was the only thing that mattered. And that part of him that still reared its naive head would remind him what a terrible son he was. Then there was another part of him that was glad that his father, who had dragged him a child and his mother, however willing she was, into the Dark Lord’s most intimate plans, was gone. They could have easily died at any moment, but it never matter to Lucius because of things like
Draco laid back, thinking on this.
“I think so too,” she smiled at him, “Makes it all more worthwhile.” He returned the smile minutely, letting Draco Malfoy, heir to Malfoy Manor, take over in his responses, an easy disguise to throw on so he wouldn’t have to think as hard or exacerbate the headache.
“Draco Malfoy.” She nodded slowly, not really recognizing the name. He added, “Head Cursebreaker at Smithson & Sons.” She didn’t change her expression but her slight hesitation meant she recognized the firm at least. He could work with that.
his mind whispered to him, the ache in his heart compounding,
“I started after the sentencing.”
“I live in Washington DC, near where the magical governmental buildings are, but I’m from Vermont,” Cynthia said, which were more words that didn’t make much sense to Draco, “Though I feel like I’m getting tired of living in the swamp¹—the weather is god-awful in the summer, so this is really nice.”
They digressed for a moment into weather, comparing the coolness of the summer and describing the features of similarities of their native cities (rivers, they all had them nearby though all admitted swimming in them was a poor idea) and the differences of lakes or ocean.
“Mikaela and Lacey Stone.”
Draco had never learned why his parents married. He had never asked. They could have loved each other. It could have been yet another pure blood marriage of convenience. But they were his and it left joy and a sour taste in his mouth.
“So,” the man next to him starts, “I’ve gotten an actual frame for my bed and a second chair for my place and I was thinking of picking up some more magazines because I think it’s high time I got a sofa and a Telly—can’t have you keeling over next time you come for a visit.”
“Reasonably weird, isn’t it,” he mutters, watching a dark haired witch quickly turn away from him. “Honestly, Ronald, I will never forgive you for coining that particular phrase.” Ronald only laughed in reply.
“Then, I would support…Support Harry so he could support her.”
“Ever the optimist, Potter.”
“Oh fuck off—”
And Harry stared. And Draco stared back.
But Weasley was already stepping back, his giant hands up to ward off the fight, mumbling something about
“Massive is one thing, this is beyond that. I’m not even sure you could apparate across the whole thing in one go even if you were Albus bloody Dumbledore.” They all sat in silence considering these facts.
Almost all together.
“Voldemort,” Harry said, weariness in his shoulders as his Auror persona slid back into place, a second lid that seemed to sap all his energy, “Was a homicidal, genocidal dark wizard.” His voice was firm but detached, calm but quiet. Through their linked hands, Draco could swear he could feel the thrum of power in him, the power over Death he held, both great and terrible if he so chooses. Soothed by the coolness in his hands the whispered promises that
The good news is that we’ve finally caught up to the first chapter in ‘real’ time. I'm posting TWO chapters today in honor of it being a three day weekend in the US--Thanks Memorial Day!
“This foreign national,” said the auror, green robes contrasting with his shock of Weasley styled hair, “Is trying to remove this child from the scene without any proper clearance—for all we know he could be a part of all of this—“
No one was locking him up this time at least.
“Very strange indeed,” she agreed, taking a sip of her drink and Draco copied the motion so he wouldn’t say something else completely dense. While better than standing there awkwardly and silently, it was still terrible. He had to mention the elephant between them.
“What did he say? I
“Let me finish,” he says, gently, and he swallows down the fear, remembering Blaise and Ronald and his mother telling him how she wants him
“—Bursting in here like some sort of escaped convict—”
Draco though, scowling through the wind with an intensity he hadn’t felt in years.
He couldn’t read their expressions, his breath was coming a bit too shallowly to focus on much of anything.
What was wrong with him.
Which is when Harry stood up, knocking his chair over, instinct taking over, wand already out and hurling spells as if there’d never been a pause in the war, incapacitating the first death eater that had come out of the smoke, sending another two flying down the rubble filled street. He looked as an avenging angel, a god of chaos and destruction with the cuts bleeding from his temple and arms, his hair flying up from raw magic expulsion and his scar pale and bright against his reddish-brown skin. He looked at him fiercely, bright green eyes alight. The man who had beaten death twice.
Instantly the strong breeze stopped. “Oh.” He turned his focus entirely to Rebecca, “Oh, Bexy, I’m sorry...” and he took her hand and squeezed it. Rebecca looked up at him and smiled, just a little.
event.” Draco corrected, a modicum of decency and manners trying to rear up.
“Where’s your sense of adventure kid?!”
Then there was the long, pleasantry filled goodbye. He barely gave answers outside of what was polite, running automatically based on years of experience. Repeated ad nauseam.
“But it all worked out in the end,” Harry added, setting his warm brown hand over Draco’s.
“Thank you,” he said pointedly. He adjusted his jumper collar slightly so it sat correctly, barely avoiding a shiver as he remember why is was messed up in the first place. “Now. I’m going to ask you some questions and you’re going to answer them.” Harry opened his mouth but Draco cut him off, “With yes or no answers only.”
“Why are you
I was surprised that you were here again. Furnishing more rooms in your victor’s palace?” Potter just shook his head, his smile smaller.
“But not your mum because she’s dead too...” Draco flinches but Harry doesn’t and
“That’s just cruel.” Thomas added.
“As you know,” she said, dabbing at the corner of her mouth, “We deal with many different dialects and language barriers in UMNAS, so it’s a great opportunity to look at how we try to solve the wicked problems of today with practicality.”
His own list had been torturously small. Mother. Blaise. And after some hesitation, his aunt. Three people. He kept a small circle and he was certain the doctors at Saint Mungo’s would have called it deficient in some way, but it was better that way.
Draco Malfoy exited the bathroom and headed down the stairs to join his annoyed partner. They didn’t hold hands like they usually did, instead tying each other together like the anchor to a ship, and unlike their usual tether of warmth. They’ll probably argue about this later or just let it settle below the surface again. How much longer could he keep this corporeal form?
“Right. Essentially, there was a huge drive in creating vaccines and preventative potions by both sides to stop the various diseases that resulted in high mortality. Not all of them were successful, so much so that they avoided any conflicts external to their borders, taking a very isolationist stance. That changed during the Second World War. This is roughly the time when Grindewald rose to power as well. While the wizard in world was dealing with him, the muggle world was dealing with Hitler and his ilk, resulting in the intervention by the Americans in both wars.” She sighed, seeming at the same time old and young.
“No. I’d… I’d rather my first time
One of Draco’s hands found its way around Harry’s dripping cock and began stroking it. And after only a few pulls, ropes of come sprayed out over his hand. The tight channel surrounding his manhood clenched impossibly tighter and Draco found himself spilling into the hot space.
“Well, Harry, don’t you think you should turn around and greet your guest properly?”
Draco's thumb rubbed over the head of his erection, just barely pressing into the slit and Harry felt his release nearly upon him at that point. He suddenly grabbed the blonde’s hand and stopped him.
“He does.” Harry replied as the
Harry turned his attention from the door to his boyfriend. “No. I’ve heard you can become dependent on that stuff if you take too much of it. Merlin knows
All movement ceased and the older boy released the cock he’d been lavishing with attention.
Harry sat at the kitchen table.
Several terrible things ran through Harry's head in the few seconds he had before hearing the rest of what she had to say.
“Nothing.” The teen replied, crossing his arms as he did so.
“Of course, is something wrong?” Draco asked in response.
Draco hurried through the winding halls of the dungeon, silently praying that she would still be there. He dashed around one last corner and was relieved to see his strawberry-blonde beauty sitting on the floor along a seemingly blank stretch of wall.
Harry nodded against Draco's shoulder. “That’s all it was and it was even better than what anyone had told me.” Draco said.
“I love you, too.” The blonde replied just as quietly before kissing Harry breathless once more.
rear passenger side door so that Draco could put a sleeping Elliot in his car
and spilled himself inside her.
The blonde folded the paper and returned to his own breakfast. “I asked her to make sure it was short when I walked her to the door.” Draco responded.
Harry went hysterical. “I can’t be pregnant! I’m a male! I have a penis and testicles! I can’t have a baby!” He practically screamed.
When they pulled apart for a brief
“I had to be sure he couldn’t hurt you again, Harry. I refused to let it happen again.”
They informed him of his future the day Harry returned after sixth year. He was sixteen; underage in both worlds and because of that, he had absolutely no say in the matter, not even now that he was seventeen. It was already done.
“I’d like to be friends.” Harry said matter-of-factly.
“When did it start exactly?” Draco asked next.
With trepidation, Harry peaked over the side of the bed to see a pool of blood forming on the carpet under Ron’s already red hair. Then he started struggling again. But, as much as he tried, he couldn’t break free of his bindings. He then turned his attention to the gag in his mouth, but that wouldn’t budge either.

against his dad’s shoulder.
Blech, I wasn't very fond of writing this chapter or the next. I can't really stand het anymore because so much of it is far too fan-girly. I don't know why I don't like my own, but, whatever.
The distraught, dark-haired man managed just the tiniest of nods followed by a soft sob.
Harry placed a hand next to Draco's and replied, “Beautiful.”

Draco chuckled. “I’ve always wanted to be your friend, Harry. Maybe not for the right reasons at first, but later on I really did just want to be your friend.” He answered.
Ethan quickly divested them of the rest of their clothing before settling on his knees between pale thighs.

When Draco finally tore his
With a thumb, Draco pulled the abused flesh from Harry teeth and rested his forehead against the brunette’s. “Of course. I’d never do anything to hurt you.” He replied with a reassuring smile.
“Yeah. Let’s do that.” He turned to address the rest of the room. “I’ll be back in a bit.”
“I’m not asleep.” Harry said brokenly.
said, “Try that again, only slower.” This time the girls stuck their arms out
“From Molly! Ro-” He froze for just a second. “…Ginny, Fred, and George’s mum.” He finished sullenly.
“I’m Healer Janus.” The woman answered gently.
“I’ll try.” The blonde said with a sigh. A couple hours passed before anyone of note came by.
Several gasps were heard throughout the room. One woman even fainted.
“I do and I want to go home, but Ron said I have to stay here.” Harry said quietly.
“Oh.” The blonde boy was still a little confused but decided he didn’t really want to think about it. “When will the baby be in your tummy?” He asked.
“Aug— August 1
Several minutes later, that task was completed and the raven-haired man was trying to figure out how he was going to use his cell phone.
Draco was taken aback by Harry's outburst. “I’m sorry, Harry. I just thought you’d like it to happen as soon as possible.”
Draco thought for a moment. “It’s in a couple of weeks, right after Valentine’s Day.” He answered.
When his balls were pressed firmly against Harry’s firm arse, he waited just a few seconds before gradually pulling back out. He slide back in and started slow, but firm pace.
The blonde smiled a little and returned the hug. “Don’t be. Nothing could be done about it then and nothing can be done about it now. Besides, I couldn’t possibly imagine our Scorpius with any other name.”
Harry laughed at their antics before deciding to go check on Elliot.
Ron stood to full height and laughed gutturally. “So
“Yeah, only a much bigger one.” Harry replied with a small chuckle.
Without a single thought, the bound man leaned forward and pushed the answer button with his nose. “Draco! Ron’s here. He came back and tried to hurt me again! Please, come home!” Harry sobbed into the phone as another contraction hit him.
at least to himself, that even
After an unknown amount of time, their lips finally parted and Draco began trailing kisses and nips down Harry’s throat. He pulled the other man’s shirt down to reveal a tan collarbone and decided to mark it, causing Harry to hum in pleasure.
“He was afraid.” Harry said with a giggle.
“Give it to me!” Harry screamed.
A deceptive smile graced Eric’s lips and he slid uncomfortably close to Harry. “You are a very powerful wizard. This will help ensure the conception of a child between us.” He explained.
Harry suddenly pulled out of his grip, wide-eyed, and said quietly, “Not here.” He took a hold of Draco's hand and dragged him up the stairs to his bedroom.
Draco felt a sense of déjà vu as he pulled Harry's shirt up to look at the damage Ron had done. He winced when he saw the state of the other’s chest and stomach. There was more purple, blue, and black than fleshy pink.
Draco smiled down at his boyfriend. “I’m not really sure yet. Maybe run a business. What about you Harry?”
Despite his fear of the man standing over him, the sudden realization that he hadn’t been home alone hit Harry hard. “What did you do to my son?” He yelled.
“I-I guess so.” He replied almost inaudibly.
we made you come here to help
“Do you want an answer or not? Because I’m not sticking around for this selfish behavior of yours.” Draco replied forebodingly.
“You’re right, something doesn’t sound right.” Healer Carter agreed after hearing Draco’s story. He jotted something down on a clipboard “I’ll get a mind-healer here to talk to him straight away.”
“What do you think I did?”
“Of course he is.” Draco replied with a glare toward his son. “And we’re fine.”
“Harry, love, stop fussing. You look fine.” Draco stated as he took a hold of his fiancé’s hands to still them.
“That’s ok, love. There are others
Harry thought dejectedly as he stared unseeingly at the contract in his hands.
“No!” Emma replied. “He’s old!”
Hands on his hips, Harry said,
“Neither do I.” Draco said softly, “But it may be our only option.”
“Draco?” He whispered as he patted the other man’s face and neck. “Come on, wake up.”
“And we don’t know where Scorpius went.”
“What?”
It wasn’t until Draco began pushing in a third finger that Harry remembered what this was leading up to. He hissed in pain as he was stretched to unnatural proportions.
The younger man took a deep, calming breath and did as instructed. On cue, the finger inside him slowly began to move in and out. Only a moment later, a second finger was added to the first and the pair repeated their previous actions.
“No.”
Harry's sessions with Emma had gone much better than he had expected. After the first month, he only had to see her every other Wednesday. By the time Easter rolled around, it was reduced to once a month.
Trepidatiously, the dark-haired man wrapped a hand around Draco’s throbbing length. He rubbed up and down a few times before giving the head a tender lick with his soft tongue.

Luckily, Draco was sitting at one end of the table while Scorpius was on the side so he didn’t have to look directly at him.
Immediately Harry approached him and sternly crossed his arms. “I think we have a problem.”
“Harry… what are you saying? That you wish our life together hadn’t happened?” The blonde man asked.
Suddenly shaking his head, Harry cried, “I can’t do it. I can’t do it.”

“Yes!” Harry groaned as the fingers were suddenly removed from him.
Draco then knelt down so that he
“Great just what I need, more fame.” Harry grumbled, his face taking on a dark look. But then he looked down at the tiny form of his son and another smile stretched across his lips as everything negative melted away.
The voices finally penetrated the oldest man in the room’s mind and he stopped pummeling the now unconscious young man. Sirius looked down and finally recognized the face of the youngest Malfoy.
Draco dropped his bag in the empty chair next to the bed, sat down with Harry and asked, “How are you feeling?”

, and he was married to the man he loved. Suddenly he felt overwhelmed as it all really sank in for the first time.
…” He pointed at Draco's crotch, “… is what did this to me!”
Before another word could be spoken, the conversation was interrupted by the sound of a cell phone ringing.
Harry's eyes snapped open and looked incredulously down at the panting Draco. “Wha… wh… hey!”
Finally, Harry sobbed and tears began streaming down his face. He didn’t even notice when he was pulled to his husband’s chest, nor did he hear the whispered words of comfort.

“And obviously he plans on being responsible about it. He has the antiseptic.” Harry explained.
“But I’m not tired.” Harry whined like a petulant child. He then contradicted himself by yawning. Draco just raised a brow. “All right fine… Mother.”
” Harry’s legs moved to wrap around Draco’s body, pulling him in just a little deeper and causing the cock inside him to slide perfectly against that one spot.
“All set there, Harry?” He asked happily.
“Come on, Potter.” He said as he pulled Harry up.
“Scorpius.” A voice suddenly called from the quieting crowd. “Scorpius, what is going on over here?”

As they divested themselves of jacket and cloak, they heard a loud crash from above them.
“He is, but Papa can be a Mommy too.” James explained.
“You ready to go?” A voice asked from right next to his ear. Harry started and turned to glare at his fiancé.
Scorpius, however, was less than impressed. There was a boy at school who was a metamorphmagus and the novelty had quickly worn off. If he couldn’t do it, why should he care?
The trio walked to the door together.
“I suppose I would have done the same thing you did.” Harry finally replied, “Except, I would have told someone even if you told me not to.”
At this, Sirius' confused stare turned into an angry glare. “Malfoy? Lucius’ son? What the bloody hell are you doing here?” He yelled as he got to his feet and advanced on the blonde. “Did you have something to do with this?” He was right in Draco's face and had grabbed the boy by the collar.
Several minutes passed and Ethan deemed Scorpius sufficiently prepared. He moved to his knees and picked up the bottle of lube once more. “And you still want to keep going?” He asked just to be sure.
“Let go of me, Malfoy.” Ron shouted.
The Slytherin completely ignore the other’s outburst and pulled Harry back into another kiss, trapping him against the wall again as he did so.

“Come on already!” She whined impatiently.
in his own and said reassuringly, “I’m fine. I just have a lot on my mind right
“We’ll always have each other.” Draco murmured and ran a hand down his husband’s cheek. “Besides, five kids is a big family. And it’ll only get bigger when the girls, Elliot, and James grow up and start having kids of their own.”
Right as he was turning his gaze
Blue eyes rolled in their sockets, but a smile adorned the pale lips below them. “Well, that was helpful.”
Harry gave his friend a hard look. “He’s not the same git he was in first year, Ron. He… he’s changed.”
Four gasps sounded throughout the room and everyone turned to look at the boy on the floor.
Harry nodded. “Yes. I had never thought about what I might name my kids before last year and the only boy name I had is no longer available. Besides, he’s your son too.”
an embarrassingly short amount of time, but they were both sated and it had
“We can both do it. That way it’ll be over faster.” Harry said as Draco opened the jar.
“You want me to stop?” Draco asked softly and kissed Harry's inner thigh.
“I was changing Olivia and I realized… I am so done with diapers.” Harry explained.
“Oh.” Harry looked at Madam Pomfrey. “I suppose that’s why you didn’t ask if that was an option for me, not that it is.” He gave Draco a reassuring smile when he felt the other’s hand tighten around his own.

“You think this is funny, Potter?” Oliver spat.
by car.” Scorpius retorted.
Harry opened his eyes and looked at the object in his hands. It was a red and yellow striped onesie. He wanted to cry. It was the best gift he had ever gotten, even if it wasn’t technically for him.
Draco sat up a little and Harry turned his head so they could see each other. “I half expected you not to be there.” He said with a tired smile.
Again Harry broke down.

“Then what am I—” Draco started before realization dawned on him. “Oh!”
“Nothing yet.” Came a voice from the end of the bed.
When Sirius finally let go of him, Harry could see unshed tears swimming in those gray eyes. He felt tears build in his own green ones.
“Why do you have to knock me out?” Harry asked.

two years ago now that he realized girls just didn’t do it for him.
“Oh, my god. Malfoy… if you… don’t stop… I’m gonna…” Harry panted. But before he could finish warning the blonde of his impending orgasm, he felt it ripped from.
Wow, so I know a lot of you may have thought I was dead. I am not. I've just been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for the last several years. Because of this I have been unable to write anything for a very long time.
“Really? Isn’t that just a day after your birthday, Harry?” She asked. The dark-haired boy nodded and took a bite from a biscuit. “Why so soon?”
“That’s so sweet.” Hermione gushed.
“Harry Potter.” She interrupted, wide-eyed, the moment she recognized him.
Harry suddenly stood up to be closer to eye level and put his hands on his hips. “And how old were we?” The question was obviously completely rhetorical.
“Not even through with your
“Mmmm.” Draco purred. “That bad, huh?” He pinned Harry’s smaller body against the cold, stone wall and pushed a knee between his legs.
Emma bit her lip and refused to meet her dad’s eye. Scorpius had told her not to tell, but if he was sick, she wanted him to get help.

“Do you want me to get you some more blankets?” He asked kindly.
Nearly in tears, the teen replied, “I don-don’t know. I called dad back but I couldn’t really understand him. He was crying though and said something about someone named Ron and… and again. I think dad’s in trouble.”

Harry stopped struggling and started crying, but he allowed Draco to wrap his arms around him to comfort him.

“I’m not!” The blonde man cried, suddenly near tears. “I’m pissed at myself. And… and a little bit at you.” Harry scoffed, but Draco continued before he could speak. “I thought we did better than that. We told him ev-everything! Everything! Absolutely. EVERYTHING. I thought we made it clear that what happened with us wasn’t a good thing! That we were lucky we had money and resources to help make it easier! That

Having been given permission to do what he liked, Harry climbed up on it and bounced a little. He watched the bedspread ripple out from his feet like ripples in a pond. He then jumped once, landed on his butt, and purposely fell back so he would move with the bed.
Albus rushes up to Ginny, dragging a tinsel-decorated Draco Malfoy behind him, and takes his teddy, a soft, mint green bear that was a gift from Harry and Draco the day he was born. Draco scoops Albus up into his arms, and they giggle merrily up the stairs to Albus’ room. “Harry, be a dear and check the roast please!” Draco’s velvety voices floats down the stairs in his wake. Harry shakes his head proudly before ambling into the kitchen, Ginny hot on his heels. She sighs before sinking into one of the plush, crème colored love seats as Harry checks on the roast. It looks great and it smells delicious. Everything seems to be coming along right on track.
