, not a dragon.” Rudá smirked, watching the toucan throw his cards on the table, hands still trapping Draco. He turned back, pink eyes on him again. “I’ve heard so much about you already. No tale did justice to your beauty, my angel,” Rudá started, heavy-lidded eyes piercing into Draco’s. “I can’t tell you how anxious I’ve been to finally meet you!” He stretched a hand, petting the stalker-parrot still on Draco's shoulder. “Good boy, bringing him here to me.”
The memory of their first encounter still stung a little. In a bitter way, though, because the second thing to know about Draco Malfoy was that he did
Draco had taken to watching Harry at all times; when Harry was sleeping—they shared a bed constantly now—when Harry was driving, when he used his wandless magic, or cooking them breakfast. Harry would often catch Draco’s eyes on him and grin back, bashful, cheeks blushing endearingly. Then, Draco would hug him from behind and rest his head on Harry’s shoulder and just stay there, until their hearts synchronised and started beating in the same rhythm.
That got him a roaring laugh. “It’s charmed. The Jeep. Kind of like the Knight Bus, you know? We won’t hit anything, don’t worry. And I’m an excellent driver. Just… keep all of you inside of the car.”
he had now. There was nothing else to hold on to except for himself—and, currently, the certainty that he’d hardly reach the end of the day without murdering someone. The question remained, should it be the annoying clerk or the bloody Saviour? Both options were so tantalising.
Draco was so intrigued by how it was produced once Potter began explaining the dynamics to him, he didn’t even have it in him to reject the idea. Brazilian TV shows, once aired, had one episode per day, except Sundays, and they filmed it while going, taking into consideration the public’s opinion. It could last hundreds of episodes and it was amazing how they made it work continuously.
“That’s a terrifyingly accurate guess,” Draco mumbled, staring at the blur of the forest by his side.
followed them to Potter’s house and only left his side when Draco profusely refused to let it in. Maybe he should have. He could bet Potter’s snake could eat it in one go. Draco smiled at the thought and opened the windows again after a cold shower, but the bird didn’t return.
Of course, Draco was wrong—as he usually was, about many things in life, albeit never admitting it—and Francisca’s plan failed miserably during the first hour of their campaign into the forest.
“But testing me for what? He wants me to open it, or not to open it?” Draco asked, frustrated and tired of staring at the seed, unsure if he should do anything with it. It still felt cold to the touch, though the noises had subsided after a few hours of possessing it. He stowed it away in his pocket again.
. It was just as his father always wanted. Of course, the desire of making his father proud certainly hadn’t lasted long before images of girls were replaced with boys… and as he grew, of men. Of magazines hidden under his bed, desires and fantasies revolving around a certain green-eyed boy with tousled hair.
He knew Harry’s mysteries. Draco knew the man in front of him; he had always known. Back when they were in school, or when they were inside each other. He
He had tried Saci, of course, but apparently the plant was from before Saci’s time. Draco hadn’t understood that, but didn’t push the issue. He had long before declared Saci to be useless in his plans.
good now. It was a relief that someone saw that, acknowledged he was trying, even if that someone was Potter and his new friends. Draco wondered if he might call them the new Golden Trio, and smirked at the thought of Granger’s and Weasley’s reaction at being traded.
like seeing Hogwarts for the first time. It wasn’t better, per se, but was a completely unique feeling. Draco remembered having read everything there was to know about the castle in Scotland and the history behind it. He was prepared for that stony giant jutting into the darkness behind the waters of the great, dark lake on its grounds. His eleven-year-old eyes grew brighter with excitement as soon as he had caught the sight of the building on that first fateful night. Draco almost hadn’t wanted to hide his awe. He did, reluctantly, because he was a Malfoy, and Malfoys strived for perfection—even if that meant being an arrogant little prat, incapable of feeling humility.
Draco rubbed a finger on his chin. It was a delightful story, and the fact the plant looked like an eye was enticing. The drawings around the text were very clear, but… “Is this fruit magical?”
“I’m sorry,” he started again. “I’m so sorry, but I had to. You wouldn’t have talked to me.” And just once again, flinching “I’m sorry.”
it seemed. Despite his mind's reasoning, Draco still trusted Harry wouldn’t do anything to harm him.
Tai didn’t comment further on her reasoning behind avoiding the ritual. Draco wasn’t all that eager to talk about why he thought his didn’t work either.
The only one who didn’t show up again was Rudá. He suspected Saci was right when he had said the dolphin-man was not to be trusted. Draco tried to get more out of Saci regarding the half-man, half-aquatic beast, but the only thing he got was a roll of eyes and a, “He’s testing you.”
Tainara had, though, refused to reveal how she had made the potion without the last ingredient, Saci’s mushroom; and Rudá—who had pretty much only been slightly chided about the whole thing, but didn't seem to care—was no help regarding the potion his daughter was making. Draco’s relief lay in the fact that Tainara never figured out the last ingredient, though, as his research had proved the mushroom was the component that stripped the victims of their past.
me! You all are to blame for what that girl is suffering! For what she’s doing to you!” And if it was not for Harry, Draco might as well leave them be. Let them deal with their own problems. “You’re going to help me, now!”
Draco fiddled with a few books, annoyed to notice most of that collection was in Portuguese. Not that it explained why Potter hadn’t had the heart to show this room to Draco sooner, and he was intent on confronting him about it later.
Her eyes beamed with excitement since Potter first brought up the creature earlier that day. Caipora, as Francisca had explained, was one of the native creatures that lived in the rainforest. Brazilian people believed these beings were nothing but myths, figments of the imagination. However, not only were they very real, but a vital part of the school. Caiporas, specifically, were protectors of the forest,
The sun was warm on his face, but besides the boiling heat, there was something else. A cool breeze caused the hair at his nape to sway, the dampness made fresh by it. A cicada sang in the distance, birds chanted amongst themselves, a melody only they could translate. Something cried, loud, acute and long, and it wasn’t sad, just
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it again. How did Potter know so much? How could Potter praise him so easily? Not that Draco was complaining. Not at all. It felt good to be the centre of his attention for once. Draco could get used to that again.
But she didn’t finish, interrupted by Tainara’s voice cutting across the land until it reached them. “Jurupari.”
As if hearing his name had awakened something within him, Harry’s stance shifted. The darkness spilled from his limbs in long strands, streaming across the ground in their direction, like serpents searching for their next victim.
Draco wasn’t sure whether the shadows were too busy scaring other people or his own nightmares hadn’t become real yet, but he just ran without looking back, crossing the field of the Living Section faster than he thought possible.
“Great. This is simply great,” he huffed, rolling his eyes. His body was cooling down; the adrenaline ebbed away, doubts about his precipitated reaction assaulted his senses. “I’m lost in the very forest they told me not to brave alone. And whose fault is this? Potter, obviously. It had to be Potter,” he whinged, pushing his body off the tree and revelling in the way his knees didn’t falter. Talking made his throat hurt, but it kept his mind from wandering off too much. “Of course Potter had to be perfect on the other side of the fucking Atlantic Ocean; of course, everyone would rather be friends with Potter and think I—
“She almost always stays on the grounds. But she doesn’t live at the school, like me,” Potter said, once they got out of the car. He shrugged at Draco’s questioning expression. “She’s probably enjoying the peace and quiet by spending some time with her babies.”
“Don’t be dramatic, Draco,” Longbottom chuckled, but then flinched. “Actually… Harry asked us not to tell anyone. He was afraid of the press finding out, and… you can imagine it.”
The girl was tall—taller than Potter, at least, which wasn’t saying much. Her bushy hair fell in waves around her shoulders, almost merging with the golden brown tone of her skin. Despite the freckles scattered around her face like a constellation, her features, lips, nose, cheeks were full and flushed, and eyes sharp. She seemed young enough to be a student, although she wasn’t wearing only the plain uniform like the others, but donned in a small headdress made of feathers, with black paint drawing geometric figures around her face and arms. “Hey, you.” She glanced at Draco after a beat, and her attention seemed too intense. “You must be Draco. Harry mentioned you, like… a thousand times. He told me everything about you.”
“I know.” Draco pushed himself from the tree, taking a step closer, a smile already tugging at his lips.
The school was even more majestic up close. There was an uneasiness about the whole thing, though—about being there, surrounded by nature and the magic that Draco
“I wouldn’t usually agree to something like this—” Francisca, still on a roll, barely noticed when her partner left them for his own classes. Hers wouldn’t begin until later, and so she was free to arrange a meeting for Draco with this Caipora. She also seemed very content with finding someone to listen to her incessant chatter—not that Draco was all that focused. Francisca raised an eyebrow at him, containing a smirk. “Seeing as they are not as friendly as we’d like. But since you don’t have many options…”
The creatures glanced at each other before turning back to Draco. Caipora’s sigh was so deep her breath sounded like the wind singing in the crack of a window. It was creepy, more so because it happened during the day and not at night.
he was still holding open. His confused expression was gone so fast, replaced by a soft grin, that Draco was convinced it had been a trick of the light. Potter couldn’t really care whether or not Draco had a fiancé.
when it was aired, and Nazare—the villain—such an amazing character that she became a wide known meme you've probably seen around:
“Christ, Draco, where were you?!” Potter asked, voice strained with concern, kneeling in front of Draco. His face was red where it was not covered in soot, hands full of scratches and recent burns, his clothes charred from the fire.
It didn’t really matter that even his magic disagreed with that plan, flaring wildly at the most inconvenient times—when he attempted to touch one of Potter’s photographs, or when he closed the door to his guest room and it stung him. Draco knew deep down in his bones that this was just a presage of how bad this arrangement would end.
It took Draco a moment to realise Potter was talking about the fire, as his own thoughts were not near that at all. He grinned weakly. “Yes. It’s just… I’m afraid of it. Fire. Since… you know.”
“I’d trade eternity for this night. Why is it dawning? I ask the opposite, to see the sun setting.” Potter pulled away just enough for his piercing gaze to settle on Draco’s flushed face. “Why is it dawning if I won’t kiss your lips when you go away? Draco?”
Trap made of sticks with pyramidal shape, destined to catch birds, small mammals and other animals; a scam.
It seemed like a valid point, if he considered the bonding part of the ritual. Still, she wore a uniform like the others, and she was
Brazilian summer starts in December and the beginning of our school year between January and March after our biggest vacation time.
After he and Harry had… worked out the unresolved tension between them, to put it blandly, Draco barely left the house for days, fully intent on enjoying Harry’s company for as long as he could persuade Harry to stay at home.
Deliberately choosing to leave out the part about whatever darkness was going to taint him, Draco recounted his encounter with Curupira and Caipora, and showed Potter the little fruit of guarana he had got as a gift of good faith from the latter. They were both inclined to believe it was a good sign, though neither of them knew quite what to do with it now.
Draco didn’t understand why he didn’t tell the truth. Why telling Potter what Berenice had told him felt like failure, like a conviction.
Nobody was wearing the uniform, and everywhere Draco looked, he was met with the most different hair styles he had ever seen. Even Tainara was looking slightly different than usual. She was still covered in facial and body paintings, but was wearing an outfit made of feathers, a tall colourful headdress and countless bead necklaces—some of which she lent him, claiming Draco had to dress accordingly. Tainara was beautiful, and like most of the students, wore such a bright smile that its glow could be compared to the light of the magical spheres.
And then Harry was tilting his head, enunciating slowly, “We’re back to Potter, now? I thought we were past this.”
It was odd to notice how nothing had changed in the leaves, in the surrounding trees, when Draco was someone completely different now. There were indelible marks under his skin, where no one could touch him, proving that he had been there. That he had met Caipora and Curupira. That Harry had touched him and loved him. Marks that proved he was trying, still frustrated and even more lost than what he realised he felt when he first got here, but trying.
“Amazing, isn’t it?” Potter supplied, turning an amused grin towards him. It was, indeed. “I felt the same when I first got here. It’s like it’s…
They turned to her, and the sight made a shiver run down Draco’s spine. The girl had an arm raised, and mimicking her posture, was Harry just below, feet rooted to the ground by the same dark veins that came out of his eyes and were trying to consume his whole body. From his fingers Harry dispelled a sombre energy Draco was sure could hurt whoever it came in contact with. But the magic flowed slowly, like the stream of a calm river, instead of with the charge of Tainara’s rage for not having all the attention on her.
Draco spluttered, “Well, yes. Harry is very generous. He’s helping me every way he can.” Draco didn’t mention they were both also shagging on every surface they found, whenever they were both free, but the low humming coming out from the woman conveyed she knew enough.
inside the tucumã seed. Whereas Draco had the nagging suspicion it had been lurking around them before, Harry had been acting warily for weeks, even more so after their fight.
That had been when Draco caught sight of the small pocket watch. Its golden case glinted against the light filtering through the curtains. Elegant numbers were painted on the white interior body. The object was held by a delicate golden chain and hanging from a miniature tree trunk.
Draco smiled, searching for Lua’s and Caipora’s shapes in the night. He met the white of their wide eyes almost instantly, but they didn’t seem happy.
Draco wasn’t trying to avoid the inevitable—fixing everything and finally talking to Harry—when delaying talking to Lua. It was just that the woman, beyond hating him to no end, was also one of the creatures Draco had very much betrayed, albeit not on purpose. He did not know Lua’s capabilities, and she already looked scary as hell without him knowing what she could do to him.
He wouldn’t, because it was probably a joke. Draco fought the urge to turn around, to let it all go, to run back to his comfortable—if convenient—life.
She is a dwarf indigenous guardian of the forest. She has red hair and skin, and pointy ears (though, depending on the region of Brazil, she might look just like a normal indigenous woman). She lives in the forest and protects it from hunters, although she can be persuaded if they leave tobacco for her before going on a hunt. Caipora is a trickster, and her main goal is to protect the ecosystem, that’s why she sets traps to confuse the hunters. She can also make many noises to distract them and make them lose their way. Besides, she can control animals and resuscitate them.
Draco’s eyes darted around. Students gathered distantly from the line of the fire, crying copiously at the damage. The animals, covered in soot and ash, sought protection from the searing heat inside the school. The adults were trying to control the flames that just consumed, quenched,
“It’s a capybara,” the stranger said, still with their back to Draco. They sounded like a woman, voice deep and a bit muffled, as if all that hair prevented her from talking. “You humans come and take, take,
Draco was still wrapping his head around what she’d just told him as he was filled with the curiosity to know
The breads Potter offered had been truly delicious—some sweeter, some saltier, but none like what he was used to—and went perfectly with jam from a fruit called guava that Potter made him try.
Draco hummed. When she didn’t offer any clarification about the words, he tried memorising them to ask Harry to translate later. “I noticed,” he muttered under his breath.
“There’s nothing you can do,” two voices echoed at the same time; Headteacher Berenice’s thundering words and Tainara’s.
It wasn’t that Draco was afraid of retaliation if people discovered what he was doing. He was beyond that. Saci was right, though. If Draco kept quiet, it was purely out of a guilty conscience.
Draco ignored that, following suit, and hesitated momentarily when his eyes caught the books abandoned on the grass—he wasn’t really getting anywhere on the other plant for his potion and was starting to fear being stagnant, but he still needed to return them.
Draco hadn’t asked, but he didn’t point that out. He could relate to that level of commitment to a job.
“Okay?” That seemed to cool him down. Potter smiled, pointing with his head in the direction they had come from. “Let’s go for now, yeah?”
The staff and students seemed to be getting used to the twenty-four hours sun. Though the days passed slowly, there was still no sign of the moon or the stars. If Draco didn’t take into consideration the dark circles under the eyes of everyone in Homunin and the lowering buzz each day, he could assume people were dealing with all of that considerably well.
Harry was right about the robes. They were dirty now, exhibiting a small hole at the bottom, he noticed when climbing back in the car. Draco found he didn’t mind that too much now.
The students had pulled away almost entirely as the staff tried to contain the flames, throwing every kind of spell they could think of to prevent the wild fire from reaching the cabins. Fire spread fast, birds and land animals fleeing the woods they used to call home. The thick smoke darkened the sky as the pungent, tart tang weaved in the air.
a good man, he had made sure of that in the years after the war. Guilt would never leave him, but that was not what this was about. He grew, he became a better person. He knew the wrongs he had done would follow him forever and he’d never stop redeeming himself. But he could do
dwell on feelings. If anything, he avoided them. Draco Malfoy would never let his heart get the best out of him—not again. There were too many pitfalls in having to depend so much on a single organ to keep him going.
“Mr Malfoy, calm down,” Berenice said, her voice low and melodious, resonating as one with his mind. “Everything will be alright. You’re fine, now. You’re breathing slowly and thinking of a way out of this. I know you are.”
that smelled like it was rotting. He obviously didn’t say that, afraid he might offend someone with his opinions about the food, and wasn’t feeling adventurous enough to try it.
Potter patiently walked him through all the gadgets, pointing to every button on the panel, and explaining all the safety measures Draco should take before starting the car. Draco let Potter’s silvery accent wash over him, determinedly following his instructions.
Draco took (another) deep breath, because it was better to keep his lungs full of air and his mouth shut than to say what he really wanted.
very worried. Not about Potter’s confidence or the success rate of the ritual. But there was a nagging feeling in the back of his head, repeating that what usually worked for
Convincing Martin that he was perfectly fine all the time, even when he just wanted to break a few things, had become somewhat tiring after a few years. It was easier to control his moods when he had no one else to please.
“Fuck. No.” Harry sighed, reaching for Draco, hand cupping his nape while the other rested in the small of his back. “You look perfect, Draco.”
running from anything, it’d be from being on the receiving end of looks filled with contempt that followed him at every corner since the break up—not as many as he’d have hoped for, though. His popularity wasn’t very high right now (as if it had ever been). But he definitely didn’t need healing. And he didn’t need anyone by his side. Draco was perfectly fine on his own. He’d always been.
Draco didn’t stick out for the answer. The urge to run took over him, and his feet were taking him away before he rationalised about it. Draco had never run so much or so fast in his life.
“Oh, it absolutely is,” Potter chuckled. “Just, I’m not sure it’ll still be in one piece when we arrive.”
Draco cleared his throat, praying to all the gods that his blush had subsided, and pointed his chin at the great, golden building. “So, what are we waiting for? I’m sure you’re dying to give me the grand tour.”
“Who else would it be, Draco? You went into the forest, you carried that thing around. You think I didn’t know you had Saci’s cap? You were looking for trouble!” Harry’s voice raised with his shoulders, and Draco forced himself not to recoil to the free and unwarranted demonstration of power.
Draco pursed his lips, very sure the reasons for Harry’s ashen pallor back whenever it had been had less to do with ‘London not having sun’ than with his state of mind. “Well,” he started, hesitantly, and then shrugged. “Not like here, there isn’t.”
“Second,” Tainara added, “I do believe it was not your fault. She will have to see it, even if she doesn’t like it.”
“You cannot be serious,” he gasped, eyes wide and unbelieving. “You’ve seen how I was after that. It certainly felt like a drug. And it wasn’t you vomiting your guts out, so I say I was drugged and someone gave it to me on purpose!”
“Going to the forest. But don’t go alone; it’s very dangerous. Harry knows her, they always like Harry.”
“I thought I’d go insane with wanting you,” Draco breathed, nails clawing Harry’s back under the hem of his shirt, pulling him
He knew where to go, and the night sky enveloped him as he followed Machado to where he needed to be.
It sounded… not bad. And it was frightening. How easy it was to realise all he wanted was to stay by Harry’s side.
Draco nodded, resigning himself to spending more time with Potter. He’d survive this, he had to. It’d serve only to strengthen him. Dealing with Potter was definitely a challenge.
Everything dived into an uneasy silence and Draco wondered if the forest was quiet in salute for one of its creatures.
He held the small, dancing flame that the Headteacher floated to him. It didn’t burn, as Harry said it wouldn’t, weird as it felt holding an immaterial source of power in his palms. Increasingly so when it didn’t get absorbed into Draco's chest at all.
“What… excuse me?" Draco started, snorting. "I do not… I’m here for important research, something that could change lives, help people. This is not about me!”
“You don’t have to help me. I’m sure researching isn’t your forte. I can do this on my own,” Draco said, undecided if he should stick to the excitement with knowledge at the tip of his fingers brewing inside him or his reservations about the school. It was getting tiring—resenting the new ways the school would find to reject him.
At Draco’s pointed glance, Potter continued—now more genuinely—apologetically. “Right, yes, I was planning on introducing you two sometime today, but I thought she was shedding. She said she liked you.” He added the last part as if it would appease Draco’s temper now that the harm was done.
—its ancestral indigenous house. Each trunk represents a soul. They paint the wood of each soul with drawings that remind them of those that are gone. Women come with food and sweets, and they dance and sing to invoke the spirits of the dead again.”
“Zere’s zomething guarded inside ze zeed.” Lua turned it over between her fingers. “Zomething evil.”
He felt Potter’s hands on his body; the heat radiating from him, the smooth patch of skin, and the short hair at his nape. He felt it all, and he wanted
Draco’s grin grew larger as he watched the creature disappear between the leaves. He squinted his eyes, swearing he could see more of them jumping from one branch to the other, crying out happily.
The students, scattered just until now, gathered around their instructor, babbling excitedly and apparently still unaware of the stranger in their domain. Draco took the moment to watch the assortment of younglings Potter had under his care. Some looked older, taking over controlling the younger ones as Potter answered a girl in the corner. It was not that uncommon for schools to mix student’s classes based on aptitude. Still, he wondered how Potter managed such an odd assembly. He reasoned it was okay, since it was only a practical class. The controlled chaos suited Harry.
.” Francisca kissed Zé and waved at Harry before turning to Draco again. “It was nice meeting you, Draco. Don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything.”
it had been an accident. Harry was shaking, eyes wide, pressing his back against the counter as far from Draco as he could get. His magic was still alive around them, but not as hurtful anymore.
He would have time to ask them all later once his temporary situation became permanent. Draco’s efforts now should be focused on handling the problem at hand: being accepted by Homunin.
But he had something, and it was more than what Caipora offered. An exciting thrill went up his spine, making the hair on his skin stand, and Draco’s actions become bolder.
Saci is a black, mischievous boy, with a smoking pipe and a red cap that gives him magical powers. He loves playing pranks and has a good time with them. His main hobbies include braiding horse’s tails, hiding objects from their owners, and whistling very loud. Saci can control the woods, and so he domains herbs and medicinal plants. He protects and cares for the sacred plants in his forest, and tricks people that are trying to collect them without his avail.
But Martin hadn’t been the only problem, as much as Draco avoided staring at this truth with too much attention. Martin was a good man and wonderful to Draco, which made it all… harder. How could someone like him deserve something so good? It was not fair that Draco had a chance of happiness when he had done so much bad in his life. And it was not fair that all Martin got was Draco and he could never truthfully return his feelings.
Potter didn’t laugh this time, but he was grinning from ear to ear when he crossed his arms. “Syryking,” he said, as if it was enough explanation.
“Partially. At first, I believed the way the potion affected their brain was irreversible. However, some patients began regaining normal functions after a while without the influence of the substance, though most of them remained amnesiacs. Still, it’s important to pinpoint exactly what… Er, Potter?”
On top of the stairs that led to the giant doors of the palace stood a grey stoned platform, holding flames twisting and never burning, no matter how close Draco got to it. Pyre of Iaké was its name, Potter had told him on the way there. It was the only respite from all the gold around the place.
The truth was Draco was still afraid of opening up while Harry gave his entire self to him so easily. Harry was like this, brave on the surface, hiding his darkness where no one could tap. But Draco knew him better than that. Draco saw the secret in Harry’s eyes and he feared it. He feared it was too much for Harry to handle. Too much for them.
Clenching his jaw, Draco pressed his fingers against Potter’s bare skin. “Let’s just go, Potter. It can’t be that bad.”
Draco nearly laughed hysterically as he realised he was fulfilling a childhood dream—walking hand in hand with a
By the time they edged the forest and the sight of the castle of Homunin extended in the horizon, Draco was on a first name basis with newly named Machado—in honor of the author of the book he couldn’t really read. “Why can’t I understand you like that Rudá guy, Machado?” he wondered, but the bird just clicked his beak in response.
Draco wondered whether Lua had been talking about the greenhouse or the school as a whole. It didn’t matter, he realised, standing at the end of her stern gaze. Draco wasn’t eager to relive the experience of being thrown into a wall, so he and Potter left the building.
The fire was out, but the people kept dancing and chanting, and howling. He couldn’t hear them. Everything was muffled by a long loud buzz in his ears.
Harry’s kiss was like the rain at the horizon, far and comforting, coming slowly to meet him. Then, a storm, buzzing with energy,
Draco tried not to feel hurt by the clear distinction. The voice in the back of his head telling him he’d never be
His body didn’t ache so much, but frustration and helplessness were enough to have him walking far from his useless notes for the moment. After getting some butter and jam on a piece of toast—Draco wasn’t very adventurous in the kitchen, especially without Potter to cook for him—he settled in at a quiet pace for the rest of the day, braving the parts of the house Potter hadn’t shown him. Nazaré serenely stalked after him as Draco opened door after door, only to find more and more guest rooms.
Harry had said he was with Tainara when he fainted. Tainara always seemed to know where Draco was when he braved the woods. Tainara knew all the tales, all the magic. Tainara lied to Harry about Draco’s location. Tainara disliked the forest’s creatures with a fierceness Draco couldn't understand.
“It’s an ocelot,” Potter murmured, bumping his shoulder against Draco’s once they were out of the car.
“Of course, you beautiful thing,” Rudá said. “I couldn’t find you anywhere, and I needed to see you.”
A few days during which Draco would have to deal with copious views of that crooked grin, bright green eyes, unreasonable tanned muscles and to hear that fucking nauseating,
A strong tornado made every leaf fly. The crown of the trees swayed dangerously to the sides as Draco’s hair whipped around his face. The whirlwind closed around him, the razor-sharp wind stinging his skin. Using his forearm to cover his face, Draco took a step back. No matter how much he tried to back away, the tornado just seemed to get closer. The parrot on his shoulder squawked and tried to fly away, but a gush of wind threw him right back into Draco’s arms.
Draco could do exactly that. Last a day in the forest. He’d still see about the rest later, although the trip was already proving itself quite challenging so far.
Potter shrugged. “I cleared my schedule. You have me for the day.” Couldn’t Potter see that was exactly where the danger lay? Having his full attention wasn’t good for Draco’s frayed nerves. But then, Potter added, “Also, I don’t think you can read Portuguese.”
“I know,” she hissed through gritted teeth, beastly eyes boring into his. Caipora crossed her arms, promptly analysing her nails—though they looked more like filthy, tattered claws. Her accent was a strange thing, dragged, but rough and forceful. She didn’t look like someone to take lightly. “And I don’t know yet if I want to hearr’u orr not.”
Despite Potter’s reassurances that the snake—Nazaré—wouldn’t bother him again, it ended up tangled between his legs as he napped comfortably for the rest of the day. Draco realised he didn’t mind that much. The rainbow boa emanated the same kind of energy that Potter did. And if the wizard really felt what that reptile felt, Draco mused, Potter would probably be feeling comfortable right around then. Draco purposefully tried not to think about the dynamics of that too deeply.
a drug, no matter what Potter said—but… Draco had noticed soon after that he could sense Machado wherever the animal was, and he knew for a fact the bird felt him as well.
Whatever this power was, whatever it meant. He could feel its tendrils stranded between the silent, terrorised students. Whose nightmare had made it so eerily quiet? Would Draco lose the ability to speak once he crossed the border?
But the bird didn’t seem as interested in Draco as usual. He nibbled Draco’s tied hair for a bit before flying away, leaving them to their lazy conversation again.
He glanced around, though, just to make sure there was no one there who could go with him; but neither Francisca, Tainara, José or even Harry were in sight. Draco was confident that whenever he decided to try it again, he’d end up lost and alone anyway, so it didn’t seem to matter if he had company now.
Without a clue how to get Lua to at least talk to him, Draco approached her in a fit of bravery and stupidity, much to his dismay—it had to be Potter’s Gryffindor-ish influences on him.
Machado squeaked in greeting, flying around their heads. Draco didn’t approach the boy with the red cap, keeping a safe distance between them, back leaning against a tree.
Potter started the engine again, eyes on the trail ahead of them. “I’ll show you around once we get there. Then we’ll get you to your ritual and—”

Even when all the odds were against them; when he had been trapped in his house with a madman, or when Harry sliced him open in a bathroom and he had almost—for a whole second—wished that he didn’t need to open his eyes again, or when Harry left and broke him to pieces. Not now, when Draco couldn’t—
could have used them like that. Him and Harry. Draco didn’t care if he got hurt. He had been knocked by life more than once. But he wouldn’t forgive her if she did anything to harm Harry.
The man was on his feet so fast it scared the bird away to the improvised table. His cards were abandoned, and his fingers clasped Draco’s hands between his. He said, “I have never seen such beauty. Your pale skin reminds me of the moonlight, your eyes are as bright as the stars.” The fingers of one of his hands intertwined with Draco’s hair—Draco hadn’t even noticed it was untied. The man took a strand of pale hair and brushed it across his own cheek. “Your hair feels like perfect silk.”
The stranger lifted their hand. The movement, though sudden, was smooth and the tip of their fingers touched the animal. The not-rabbit lurched to its paws, a staggered movement, but definitely alive. It bowed to the person and left, not glancing at Draco once.
Cursing his own daylight brooding, Draco tried to come up with a context for what had granted the student that answer. Potter beckoned for him to come over, and Draco did, though he was reluctant to deliver himself so openly to the array of scrutinising gazes.
Rudá followed him, almost seeming not to notice it. His lips spread in a wild, sardonic grin. “Yet—” Rudá added, shrugging and waving his hands as if whatever he was saying meant nothing, or if he wasn’t scaring the shit out of Draco, “—we decided to give you a chance for now.”
Iara was a beautiful indigenous warrior from an Amazon tribe. She was powerful and loved by all, save her two brothers, that were extremely jealous and enraged by her overshadowing them. They decided to murder her while she slept, but she was a better warrior and killed them instead. Afraid of the wrath of his father, the pajé (or shaman), Iara fled. But he found her and as punishment, threw her at the river. The fish, however, took pity in the beautiful woman and transformed her into a creature half-fish, half-human. To this day, Iara drowns every man that crosses her path. If they manage to escape, they go insane. Iara or Yara means “that who lived at the water.”
“It resembles the Imperius Curse, except there is no apparent way to break it. Some of them are still under the influence of their former master. Even those who are already dead.”
Now Harry didn’t seem hurt at all, just confused, brows drawing together in a frown. “I didn’t disappear on you. I sent you a letter.”
“It’s an endangered species,” Harry continued, his voice louder now that the jaguar had disappeared between the trees. “People hunt them for their fur. To make coats.”
The bits and pieces of information he had gathered didn’t really make sense in the whole. Guaraci, the sun, didn’t like him, he assumed, as his flame decided Draco wasn’t worthy of being there. But he also depended on the creatures from the forest to accept him or not, and Caipora had said he would be tainted by something dark. What
Harry glanced at him, pulling a branch out of the way. He didn’t answer, though, instead keeping a balanced pace with Draco right on his heels.
Martin?” His voice was almost inaudible. It was impossible to say if Potter didn’t want to be heard or the surrounding noises were too distracting.
Draco was not one to give up. He would not take the coward’s way out, not when he was trying to do the right thing. That wasn’t about to change, even if those creatures couldn’t see it.
Machado was by his side again, guiding him through the woods while softly nibbling his ear. The bird seemed to have mellowed even more to him after Draco had named him, and now Machado didn’t leave his side anymore. After the proof of loyalty Draco had got—even if Machado did lure him to the woods by following Rudá’s orders in the first place—he couldn’t dismiss the bird any longer.
Draco gulped and raised his head, eyes staring into her deep red orbs. “I understand. I won’t. I promise, I won’t.” That was the only possible answer, and that was the only thing he could do.
Curupira laughed, open-mouthed, head tilting back. No sound came from his mouth. Instead, the forest around them burst into roars, leaves rustling and animals crawling at his command. Draco refused to give in to fear, though his body almost recoiled unconsciously.
was a male macaw. However, whenever he saw Draco and the bird, he didn’t seem capable of holding back his grin. “Oh, he’s still sticking with you. I think he likes your clothes,” said José.
Everybody seemed to know Potter, be it at the school or the city. The lady behind the counter of a small and lovely bakery inquired him for news—and
Draco sat by his side, cautious as not to let their knees touch. “You must teach some manners to your snake, Potter.”
“Hello, Draco. Good to see you again,” Harry greeted, his plump lips moving swiftly, green eyes gazing at him intently.
He could find another way to finish his research. Draco was resourceful, he’d work it out. And just as he had got used to Brazil in the last few months, he would get used to London again. Maybe he could even give Martin a second chance.
When Draco woke up and tried to sit, he was immediately assaulted by both memories from the night before—he hoped it had only been the night before—and dizziness. His heart started thumping faster than his chest seemed able to contain, and when raking a hand over his chest, Draco noticed his disgustingly sweaty palms. Slowly, growing more alarmed with each second, he gauged the events that had led him here.
“Don’t worry, Mr Malfoy. Every student on this property has undertaken the ritual. It’s perfectly safe.” Her voice was deep, hypnotic, and soothing, but it did almost nothing to calm his nerves.
Draco strolled for long enough that he started worrying about what he might hear from Potter when he came back—the fear of getting trapped there forever was abated by the audacity and absurdity of the whole thing. He was too far gone now to be concerned about what those creatures might do to him. Honestly, if they wanted to hurt Draco, they’d probably have done that when he spent hours alone and completely lost in the forest that time before. They might trick him, absolutely, but Draco liked to think he could handle provocation.
Curupira is a boy with flame-coloured hair and feet turned backwards. He’s the protector of the forest and uses his speed and backward feet to deceive and mislead hunters that mean harm to his woods. He doesn't tolerate those who threaten to harm the environment, but he helps the lost or in need. Curupira is also tricky and mischievous. He can whistle nonstop and imitate sounds of nature and human voices to torment and confuse his targets. Curupira loves smoking and drinking sugarcane liquor (
“Yes, it’s me. I’m Draco Malfoy,” he interjected, forcing the boy’s attention on him again before any of them said anything else. “I need to know why I was rejected. Why won’t Caipora let me in?”
Draco tried grabbing Berenice, but it was too late. His back hit the ground with force, air painfully knocked out from his lungs. He coughed, turning around and leaning on his hands as blood leaked from his mouth.
“Oh, my God, Draco,” Potter’s hands finally managed the last button, and he batted Draco’s hands away when he tried to stop him.
Still, he rose to his feet as slowly and as quietly as he could. Looked around once, twice, to be sure. Even the animals had quieted after the gale.
now. So close to achieving an extraordinary result. To healing people, and making up for his faults—those committed during the war. Mostly. To proving that he was
“Of course she was,” the Headteacher agreed. She didn’t sound distrustful, even if her smile had turned vicious. “We have a saying in Brazil, Mr Malfoy, that would apply to someone like Tainara; ‘c
Harry pressed a hand to the small of his back, encouraging him forward. He nodded to him, and Draco raised the hand holding the mango.
There was no way Draco could get to the school by running. He growled. “Fuck! I don’t have time for this.”
tasted bitter on his tongue. It felt so wrong to call him that, but he didn’t correct himself. Even if calling him Potter felt off now, it was what the wizard deserved, and the only recognition he would receive.
Well, if it wasn’t the most confusing and appalling conversation Draco had ever heard. And Draco had had his fair share of obnoxious people.
In the room’s gloominess—and his own panic fuzzed brain—Draco vaguely noticed the elongated body shifting over his stomach, punching a sigh out of him, smooth, cold scales dragging against his skin. The snake perked its snout up, small beady eyes staring intently at Draco, a forked tongue flicking in his direction.
“I know,” Draco interrupted, raising both hands in a placating gesture. “I was wrong to assume I knew anything. You were right, and I was so,
Draco got up, fuming, as he averted his eyes from Potter. He pretended not to be satisfied at the flush in Potter’s cheeks and how his jaw worked as he surveyed Draco’s body—naked, but for his boxers—walking towards his trunk. “Are you sure it—
He would have got the fuck away if another hand hadn’t grabbed his wrist. “Draco, we didn’t know!” Francisca said, making him turn to face her. “We didn’t know it was Tainara.”
Harry shook his head, slowly. “Christ. I vouched for you, Draco. I tried to help you as much as I could!”
Draco’s eyes went, immediately, to his forearm, to the mark hidden behind layers of heavy fabric. No, it couldn’t be that.
Potter had always had his heart in the right place. The problem in having a relationship with him, though, had been in Harry’s lack of commitment skills.
In Tupi (one of the indigenous languages in Brazil—there are almost 300 indigenous languages here in total) Cuca means “swallow something with a single gulp”.
Draco prayed to all the gods that Potter didn’t notice the flush on his cheeks. Or that, if he did, he attributed it to the shock of being awoken by a wild beast, rather than the sight of Potter speaking to said beast. A
Draco didn’t see Potter the next morning, but he found toast and eggs on a Stasis Charm at the table.
Draco’s eyes darted from the pipe to her. “Who are you talking about now? I never know with you people. Half the time any of you talk I can’t follow, especially with Tainara.”
“I don’t feel good. I think I’m going to be sick again…” Draco mumbled, and there he was again, throwing up. On Harry’s shoes.
Draco shivered, fingers closing tighter around Harry’s forearm, but neither of them dared to say a word.
,” he heard someone say. Was it Tainara’s voice? Draco wasn’t sure. Her face was… Not hers, but a darker and shapeless transfiguration of the girl he had met before.
They didn’t share more than pleasantries during those days, and neither Harry nor Draco tried any kind of conversation anymore.
The jaguar’s purring became a low, low growl that got the hair on Draco’s neck standing on edge. He looked up, facing Rudá’s pink eyes, darker and more feral under the moonlight. Shivering, Draco backed away with another step.
Potter all but spluttered, trying to conceal laughter Draco had already caught. “That’s rude, Jade,” he admonished, though he didn’t sound all that bothered by whatever the girl had said.
,” Francisca started, disregarding Draco’s own internal storm and tugging at the rope to keep him close. Something apparently made sense to her, for she didn’t sound
opened his mouth in a toothed grin, naughty and barbed, pointy stained fangs ripping out of his lips like knives, sharp and ready to wound. Finding it too hard to keep from staring at him, Draco averted his gaze downwards, following the shape of the creature’s body. His gaze landed on the strangeness of the boy’s feet. Ragged, barefoot and facing backwards.
Potter said, “There are only two kinds of weather here, Draco: hot and wet. I advise you to keep your cooling charms in check.” Then muttered under his breath, “Come on. She only failed me once, because Curupira messed up the spells I put in it.”
Hours later, realising he wasn’t getting anything done, and Tainara’s help wasn’t an option since she was nowhere to be seen, Draco decided it was time to go back to Potter’s house. Hesitation had prevented Draco from opening the seed of guarana. He knew there must be a magical variant of it around there somewhere, but it didn’t help that the school was so flagrantly hiding it from him.
to stay. There was no other possibility to finish his research. And there wasn’t much left for him to return to in London. He couldn’t go back as a failure.
The wind that had brought Saci made Draco’s body tilt to the side. His fingers were fast to grab the trunk again, trying to keep his balance. The wood scratched his palms in an itchy, pungent way. He retched on the grass and smiled.
He and Potter resigned themselves to going back to the library for the rest of the afternoon until Potter grew tired of reading “useless books” and dragged Draco around the campus.
Homunin held many wonders, surely, but Draco was still sore from the day before, and another warm bath wouldn’t do any harm to his aching muscles.
It was not as difficult as Draco would’ve thought, considering the school grounds were gigantic and Draco was pretty sure both of them were avoiding him as well.
There was no surprise when the, “You’ve zone enough,” came out of her thin lips, more like a growl than resembling words, as she pushed him away.
Francisca straightened, rubbing the back of her hand on her face to dry the tears from her laughter. “Yes, we—”
“I have no idea what you did out there, but it was tons of help,” Draco said to Machado, brushing the back of his hand against his lips.
“She reminds me of Granger. Only taller and with a lot more hair.” A shiver ran down his spine. Potter laughed. “How come she doesn’t live here?”
Draco snorted inelegantly, finally tearing his eyes from the trees. Harry stared at him with a smile too open, eyes too bright. Draco felt weak in the knees, and preened unashamedly. “Of course you do.”
Draco didn’t realise the sun hadn’t dawned, despite how long he stayed there, until the knock on the door echoed in the living room. Draco didn’t answer, he didn’t move, still holding Harry’s sleeping form between his arms.
“I—” Draco started, finally lifting his head and staring at Rudá. But his voice was weak, and the rest of the words went unspoken.
. It was so easy to live that life that Draco almost didn’t feel bad about his almost abandoned research.
He could deal with the Saviour of Bloody Everything. As long as Draco kept in mind this was the man—the
“I have this. Do you… want it?” He stretched his arm in her direction and counted it as a win when the creature didn’t flinch away from him. “It’s just… it’s…”
Draco panted, quivering hands gripping the blankets. His throat hurt, his breathing came out ragged and anxious, but there was nothing holding him anymore. Not the dark, icy fingers of the night, not Potter’s magic.
Draco gaped at him. Potter had to be kidding. Except he didn’t seem like he was. Despite the tranquillity of his stance, he sounded more serious than he had since Draco's arrival in Brazil.
special to me,” Harry said, and the grin he gave Draco left behind all the doubts and hurt. “I shouldn’t have left you, I should have carried you away with me.”
Draco recoiled a bit more at each of his words, but the man kept pushing closer and closer until Draco’s back had hit the trunk of a tree and the stranger was inches apart from him.
like anything Draco had imagined. He gawked at the rustically garnished room, unsure of what to stare at first. At the giant gameleira tree—Potter’s addendum, because there was no way in hell that Draco would remember that name—standing resolute right in the middle of the space. Or the thick roots that crept from the base of the tree, slithering through the hard stone floor like the bodies of dormant Basilisks, serving as improvised tables and benches for the students. Despite the sturdy canopy almost completely covering the ceiling, sunlight bled around the room.
Why did it hurt, then? Draco didn’t know what to make of it. Of that deep pang of loss for something he hadn’t even got the chance to have. Why wouldn’t the damn fire get absorbed by his magic? Was it because he couldn’t do as many wandless spells as the rest of them?
Still frozen and pinned down in bed, Draco only shot a searing, wide-eyed glare at Potter. “Why is there a serpent in my bed, Potter?!”
Lua was a small woman. Her plump body was enveloped by a black gown that spread like snakes at her feet. Her hair had the same gleam of the midnight blue, waving around her waist, and contrasting with her marble skin. Potter had said “lua” meant moon in Portuguese, and her name finally made sense. Lua’s eyes shone silver, like two bright moons in the night—brighter than his own.
“Wait, you were actually rejected by the school?” Tai asked. “There was someone else like you, ya know!”
As if he needed healing in the first place. Draco was not broken, nor was his heart. Something Narcissa—and Pansy, for that matter—entirely failed to understand. He had been the one that called the wedding off. And he
Tainara moved on, “It’s called Kuarup, the true ritual, you know. It’s the name of wood. Tribe men get trunks from Kuarup trees and line them in front of the
home. To give it to Draco so freely. And truth be told, he’d sleep anywhere if he had Harry by his side.
Seven years had done him good, Draco had to concede, staring at Potter’s profile. Right after the war, Harry had been a bundle of grief, guilt and sadness. Draco had met him then, himself being much of the same. It had been good for a while, having someone who understood him, having someone to… not to patch his wounds, but to just
What a preposterous notion, that Draco would be marginally satisfied by spending more time than necessary with Potter. No. If he was following Potter it was simply to appease the man’s conscience, as his saviour complex didn’t seem to ebb away with time, now worsened by the slightest scratch on Draco’s porcelain skin. If his well-being was enough to have Potter wobbling, it was too bad for him and not Draco’s business.
Draco stopped, raising an eyebrow at Potter’s unashamed chuckle. His glare seemed to silence Potter, though his grin was still too amused for Draco’s taste. “Sorry. Sometimes I forget that you and Neville are friends now.”
Draco had wondered before where Potter got his food—maybe he planted it himself, or had learned how to hunt animals, and the image had its appeal. But as it happened, Potter went into the village twice a month (thrice, now that Draco was there), bought supplies and came back. It was all terribly anticlimactic.
“Whenever Jaci hid behind the clouds, it meant he had company, that he had taken one girl and made them into stars,” Harry continued, sliding the shirt off of Draco’s torso. The words fell to his skin like a blanket, while his fingers worked the flies of his pants open. “Naiá, a beautiful indigenous girl, dreamed of being taken by the moon. But, one night, admiring Jaci’s reflection in the river… She started believing he was coming to take her. So smitten Naiá was, she fell in the river and drowned.” Draco’s pants slid down his thighs, Harry’s lips tracing each of the scars on his chest in slow motion. He lifted his head, looking up at Draco, a crooked smile playing on his lips. “Touched, Jaci made her into a star of the river, transforming Naiá into the Victoria Regia.”
“You said it’s probably guarana, and a mushroom. I just have to look out for those. How hard can it be?”
“You think I’m evil. That’s why, isn’t it?” He was already shaking his head. “I’m not! What else do I need to do to prove it to you?”
“Well, I can assure you it very much can. I got stung at least twice today and thrown against a wall. I’m not in the mood to serve as Castelobruxo’s punching bag any longer.”
Well, wasn’t that funny? “Aren’t you all? That’s what I've heard. Anyway, what should I do with it?”
it was going to happen. You knew that this evil—whatever it is—was trying to come for me. You just didn’t realise it was not me.” His laughter died in his throat, a wan smile spreading on his lips. “You were willing to let me face it, anyway.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but his tone was bordering on hysterical. “You don’t say. This school is bloody attacking me now!”
“Harry, please. Please, wake up.” But no matter how much Draco cried, tears dampening his face, Harry didn’t move.
Draco’s eyes were fixed on the blurred forest they rapidly crossed, as he considered releasing his white-knuckled grip of the car to gather his jaw from the floor. It was probably best to keep securing himself, though, with the way Potter drove like there was no tomorrow.
hass everything, and you have nothing. Not him, not the school, not your resssearch. He isss taking it all from you again," Curupira said, but his next sentence didn’t sound like himself. "
Harry didn’t bring it up again, but it didn’t feel like he was dropping the subject entirely. Draco tried not to think about what wanting to stay meant for him.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment on what he was really thinking. Introducing himself was a better course of action. “Nice to meet you.”
The ritual now was an actual formality that wouldn’t prevent anyone from being a student, and it proved the school was much more accepting than any of them had realised before.
Draco followed Harry’s voice until he was in front of him, lips curling up. Staring at him was always like he was looking at the sun itself. It burned and made him want to cry.
“Works for what?” He asked, too high on the adrenaline of what had just happened to overthink what he had just heard.
Potter’s expression creased in pain as he fell on his haunches, arms hanging limp, but fingers still gripping the shirt. Draco held Potter’s hands, prodding them open and freeing himself from their grasp.
Now, though, it was hard to ignore the loss that flying made him feel. Loss of so much time having passed without ever experiencing it again—Draco glanced at Potter, at his blinding smile as he swayed from one side to the other. The loss for what he could have had, Draco thought.
Potter, as excited as he seemed about everything that had happened, couldn’t conceal the concern in his beautiful eyes. To Draco’s dismay—or, if he was being honest, his vanity—Potter kept stealing surreptitious glances at Draco all night; as they ate or drank tea or prepared to go to bed.
Potter’s gaze kept following Draco as he fished a robe, and let the silk slide over his body. Draco stepped in front of him, daft fingers tying a loose knot around his waist. When no more seemed forthcoming, he asked, “What would that be?”
He felt safe around the macaw and he knew Machado understood him enough to take him out of there unharmed. And, somehow, he understood Machado just as well, enough to know he was glad that Draco was fine.
Draco opened his mouth, rebuttals coming to him even in his weak state, but the Headteacher raised a hand, stopping him from even trying. “Am. I. Clear?”
She was on a roll, and even Tainara was roaring hard with laughter by his side. José, at least, was composed enough not to openly laugh in front of him. The parrot took it as his cue to nip at Draco’s ear for the tenth time that morning. Tainara said she found that endearing, but Draco only thought it was annoying.
Somehow, during Harry’s wave of kisses, and bites, and grabbing and veiled apologies against Draco’s skin, they had ended up naked on Harry’s bed.
Potter’s grin grew wider, and Draco tried very hard not to preen at himself for making Harry forget the pain from seconds before. “The sun is up very early here. You’ll get used to it soon. C’mon, you’ll love the breads I have.”
And Draco tried. He tried a lot, overcoming the fear of burning his clothes and just shoving the flames inside himself. Despite radiating some heat, it didn’t burn, and neither Draco nor his clothes caught fire.
She shrugged. “And you? Shouldn’t you be working or something? Harry said that you came to research.”
“Zon’t talk to me, Zark Boy.” She raised a hand. Her voice was low, controlled. It sounded like it was inside his own head, fracturing his skull into dark, smaller pieces. It couldn’t be.
Draco stopped dead at that. Their arms, still linked, stopped Francisca from taking a step forward without releasing him.
My city has one of the biggest (and longest) carnivals in Brazil, it always starts on a Thursday and lasts 6 days (yes, that's true, practically 24h a day). There are also tons of other parties happening before and after this week. When I was at school (and even college) we got those 6 days off, and sometimes a bit more, right after the start of classes.
The rest of Potter’s class passed in a blur. After the initial disturbance Draco’s presence had caused, the students calmed down and gushed effusively about the new manoeuvres Potter tried to teach them.
“It’s a day to celebrate the memory of the dead,” she said, keeping a placid pace by his side as they strolled around the field.
Not that Draco knew anything for certain these days. He had long ago resigned himself to the uncanny truth about his own ignorance. He had been illiterate about Muggles, sticking to the bigoted truths his father diffused, even about magic. It made sense that he would be ignorant about Harry Potter, too.
“… Okay. You were not. Noted,” Longbottom corrected, pursing his lips to reign in a chuckle. “Tell me, then, what did you run from?”
Looking closely, Draco noticed his tattoos were not messy or confusing, but an amalgam of shapes that completed each other in a great masterpiece.
He took a deep breath, forcing his body up and sat down, eyes on the great path of grass stretching in front of them. “We don’t even know what I need.” Frustration nibbled inside him, working as a great way to sober him up faster than he’d wished. “It’s just… I have every chemical detail about the ingredients used in the Moriaetem Potion, but I have no clue to their accurate name, those last two, how or where to find them, except that they grow in Brazil’s general territory.”
real, then it had happened only in there. Probably. Otherwise, there’d be Aurors at his doorstep by now, no matter how far from home he was. Draco doubted his status as a prime suspect in everything that went wrong near him would change much over the years.
Draco closed his eyes, letting his face lean against Potter’s palms, still dizzy and too shaken to care about what that touch meant. “What happened?”
Lua’s face scrunched up as soon as she took sight of him, averting her way as fast as she could to avoid his path, but he followed her anyway.
, but he wasn’t about to prevent Potter from saving whoever—or whatever—needed him. Merlin knew what would happen if he interfered with the man’s sense of saviourship.
“As a vessel to that power,” Tainara supplied, arms open and chest on display. She didn’t have to worry about being attacked when Harry was there in all his magnificent power and shadows to protect her. “I knew it’d be Harry. I’ve always known.”
Potter blinked and took his sweet time before darting his eyes from Draco’s now covered body to his eyes. “Oh, right…” Potter started, scratching his nape, and licked his lower lip. “They’re spiritual animals. Familiars. Students here are not allowed to bring their own, because we believe the animal—or Eí—will choose its wizard and bond with them. That’s how I met Naza. She was just a baby snake at the time and had trouble getting out of her egg; her siblings had already left. I took her in, and well, she stayed. She can sense what I feel, that sort of thing.”
Well, the good news for her was that Draco didn’t need her pity. He needed someone to help him open the damn tucumã seed.
Monotonous noise that is repeated consecutively. Action that is repeated in a boring way. Way of living defined by the sameness of its events; routine.
Draco groaned in a way he’d feel very self-conscious about if he wasn’t so frustrated. “The bloody school is not very fond of the idea, and won’t let me read the interesting books.”
! Merlin, I thought you…” Potter’s voice was frayed, anxious. His calloused fingers rubbed the scratches on Draco’s face, healing them almost immediately. His eyes darted overt Draco’s entire body, probably looking for a more pressing wound. “I was so fucking worried. I looked everywhere for you, and when I couldn’t find you I thought…” Potter’s hands held his hips now, voice growing darker, more urgent. “I tried tracking Caipora down, but that damn woman was no help at all. I shouldn’t have left you alone, I’m so sorry. Are you… are you okay?”
Then, he saw Machado, and he knew it was real, as the bird’s body absorbed every single tendril of light that came out of Draco.
Draco felt the tears running down his cheeks, burning his skin with a pain he didn’t think he had ever felt before. Maybe it was his nightmare taking form, chasing him now. He couldn’t see Harry suffering like that. It would kill him if Jurupari didn’t.
The things still missing from his research were the aspects of the potion Draco couldn’t translate into ingredients from his own repertoire. The patients displayed a pliantness to follow orders, which was one thing, and they not only had amnesia, but seemed to forget ordinary life skills, such as how to eat or talk. It was as if the potion erased the person they were completely, and Draco vehemently believed this mystery pointed to those two ingredients he had come to Brazil to research.
“Don’t bother, Potter already tried. They refuse to open in my presence. One would think I have something contagious, but I was just trying to continue my research.” Draco gestured up to the sky with his hands before they fell at his sides. “Is that too much to ask?”
The first thing one must learn about Draco Malfoy was that he lacked patience, which was contradictory to his upbringing.
“I hearr you’rre looking for this. It is not magical,” she clarified with a sly grin. Hope didn’t even have time to lodge inside Draco as he caught sight of the fruit in his fingers. “Not until you prrrove yourr value.”
, as he was not at all affected by Potter’s presence. And Draco told mother so when he called her right after Neville disconnected. He shouldn’t have worried, though. Mother seemed more interested in informing him of Martin and his silly attempts at pestering her to get Draco’s location than to hear whatever he had to say about Potter.
He stalked Potter closely, watching the man gather an assortment of titles he wouldn’t understand, and trusting—or trying to—that Potter was looking for the right things.
Draco, however, was more intrigued by a group of students sheltering from the sun under a tree. There was nothing really special about them, except their things floating around the group and no wand in sight.
He turned around to find the Headteacher’s smile facing him. Headteacher Berenice was usually amiable enough to him, but something about the woman always made Draco shiver apprehensively. Something in the way she almost sang the words her lips enunciated.
“You ought to teach me how to drive your monstrosity, Potter. It’s inconceivable that I have to stay locked in your house all day while you go gallivanting around the forest,” Draco started, chin pointed at the atrocious thing Potter called his car, parked close to the front porch of the house. “It’s not like you don’t have time for me. It’s vacation time—I still can’t understand how you let the students go home after having just started classes, but—this is not the point. You can’t say you don’t have the time
Draco sighed, taking the offered broom. It was unfair how Potter still seemed to know him, how Draco’s mind worked, how to distract him. And Draco never backed away from a challenge—unless it was called Martin and wanted to marry him—especially not one coming from Potter.
“I saw something there…” Draco crawled up his seat, just in time to get a glance at the animal. It was… magnificent. It looked like it had come from one of Draco’s old children’s books. Its yellow fur gleamed bright under the sun, dotted with black round shapes swimming in that ocean of warm colours and patterns built by the shadow of weaving leaves dancing over the animal’s skin, as it just laid there, ears perked up and lazy eyes staring at the sky.
Draco’s grimace creased even deeper. “Actually, I’m positively appalled to see you. Salazar, you’re going to be worse than Martin,” he muttered the last part under his breath, trying not to get too caught up in what it meant that Harry was there—and that Draco hadn't known that he would be! “At least now I know where you vanished to seven years ago. The middle of the woods, it seems. How do you like it? You were always one to enjoy being all muddy and messy, if I remember correctly. This must be your paradise, Potter.”
The prospect of spending the rest of his life alone wasn’t particularly appealing, but it was definitely better than wasting it with someone he didn’t,
Potter groaned, casting a protection shield around the car. But there was nothing attacking them, not really, and he quickly realised it. He turned to Draco, then. “What was that?”
“You said it was just a formality!” Draco did scream this time, an acute and long screech, and then turned to the Headteacher. “I can’t leave. I need to be here to finish my research. It’s… it has to…” It was
well. So well that he cringed when comprehension dawned on him, trying to obliterate the last remnants of his patience.
Draco shrugged. “Do you all revert to Portuguese when you are mad? This is going to make things harder.”
Fires aiming at deforestation for agriculture happen in the rainforest every year, which not only contributes to reducing biodiversity but it's also an issue that can lead to a worldwide problem, as the Amazon Rainforest is critical for global carbon storage.
One morning he met Francisca and José, days after the occurrence with the seed. Both of them glanced at Draco sympathetically, but they didn’t really blame him for the sun burning their scalps day and night.
Draco knelt down by his side, grabbing Harry’s torso between his arms, holding him tight. “Please, Harry. Talk to me, please.”
that wrong, per se, since Draco wasn’t asking Saci to do anything bad—or to do anything at all, besides meeting him every day and not telling anyone. It wasn’t good, either, of course. Draco was beginning to enjoy Saci’s company enough not to care about it.
“No. It’s not—” Potter’s hands clutched desperately to Draco’s shirt, opening each button with unsteady fingers.
Saci opened his mouth, but he was interrupted by a long and distant, “Draco!?” somewhere deeper in the woods. It was Harry’s voice.
used to defeat Voldemort if someone were to hear about that. Draco would take that to his grave, naturally. “
“I don’t know. Use your charms. I know you to be very inventive.” Harry gave him that fucking crooked smiled that only made Draco's temper boil even hotter. Harry pressed Draco’s forearm before releasing him. His still burned to the memory of the recent touch. If it wasn’t for the dire situation, he would swear Potter was flirting with him.
He glanced through the window of their room. The sun was as bright as the night before. How much time had passed since he fainted on the bed? It had to be morning by now. He distantly wondered if the absence of the night would affect only the forest, the entire city, or the country. Maybe the world. If it was real. But there was a strong possibility that it had been all in his sloshed mind.
And with that display of—what was that?—jealousy, he was left alone again. The girl disappeared inside the building; the books floating after her in an organised line.
He waited for Harry to compose himself. All the fight had disappeared now, leaving them weary and vulnerable. Harry sagged against the icy surface of his counter, eyes boring into Draco’s chest.
Draco now found the weight of the parrot on his shoulder to be comforting. He wasn’t facing that man and his insane jaguar totally alone, though he’d rather have Harry by his side.
The bright golden building beamed in front of them. Like a pyramid, the monumental structure raised from a rectangular base in even spaced steps, truncated to form a platform on the top that towered into the sky as if it intended to reach the gods.
was hot and damp. A huge contrast from the room where he waited for three hours at the Portkey Station, filled with cooling charms. His clothes were sticking to his skin, and having long hair didn’t seem like a good idea right then. Even in a ponytail, it increased the heat on his nape to almost scalding.
“It’s okay.” Draco took a deep breath. “I can deal with that. I can deal with Jurupari and his magic. He won’t get to me.”
Draco glanced at the silhouette of his new friend disappearing around the brightness of the palace of Homunin. “This castle doesn’t really match with any of the other buildings here…” he murmured, unsure if Tai would hear, or if that mattered.
“I think I’m looking for a magical one, I don’t know how it… perhaps this energy, the fruit gives natives, is magic?”
Eyes, focused and intent, stared at the sky the same way Potter had done when he had sensed the Headteacher needed him. As interesting as their connection was, Draco still found that particularly creepy, more so when both of the professors said in unison, “Fire.”
Potter refused to explain what he meant about knowing the right person to take him to Caipora, to Draco’s distress. So when Potter got up to leave their lunch table the next day, Draco assumed he was supposed to follow suit.
“I want you so much,” Harry said, straddling Draco’s thighs, fingers still on his arm. “I don’t want to hurt you. I want to be with you. I’ve always…” Harry inhaled deeply, eyes finally boring into Draco’s. “I
And Draco… Well, he felt like he was being constantly watched. It wasn’t paranoia; it had been true in London after the war. It was true now. People stared at him from the corner of their eyes, averting their gazes whenever Draco noticed them.
Draco tilted his head back to give him better access, cursing the way his voice sounded so small, strangled. Fingers fidgeting and searching for contact, he reached for Harry’s hips with a bruising grip.
Potter’s arms closed tightly around him. Draco leaned all his weight on Potter as he was carried inside.
“You can’t stop me… Wait a minute,” He patted his clothes, his pockets, until he found it at last. Fingers lifted the red cap high by his head. “I still have this. And—I’m so sorry, again—I want you to help me open it.”
Draco had his own theories about the ingredients used in the Moriaetem Potion, which diverged from most of the researchers who had studied it before him. He had used reverse brewing on the sole sample the Ministry granted Draco, and curiously found similarities between his potion, Amortentia, and Calming Draught. It wasn’t the same, but the Moriaetem Potion definitely had traces of those two, which explained why those affected seemed obsessed about their ‘master’ and strangely calm at the same time.
“Might I learn the name of the woman of my dreams?” The stranger asked, grinning, honeyed voice spilling all over.
Berenice was… impactful. Her twilight black skin stood out like a patch of midnight in the middle of the day. But somehow, colour, life, and magic revolved around her. Draco found he could not avert his gaze from the tall woman with long, deep brown braids and sombre black eyes. Despite her severe stance, there was a clear charm to her features. Not in her grin filled with too many teeth, not in the golden curl of her eyelashes.
?!” Draco snapped. “You were responsible for that girl and what she was doing! How—How could you not have noticed?”
miss him, no matter what Draco’s opinionated heart believed, whenever Martin had to leave the city and their bed was too cold for a single person.
Much like he used to do, Draco now pictured himself throwing a bunch of plates and mugs and glasses on the floor. By hand, even if his arm ended up sore and in pain by the end. It was a good kind of exhaustion, he’d learnt over the years.
The nightmares were gone. Jurupari was sealed. People hugged each other, crying and holding their wounds.
Potter’s solution didn’t make things that much better, but it was something. It was better than nothing. It was…
Draco tried not to flinch at the memory of the last Creature Care professor he had met and smiled kindly at José.
But perhaps Draco could still make it work. It was not like he had to interact with Harry once they got to the school. No, not Harry.
“Harry!” Longbottom called, before noticing that the man in front of him wasn’t the one he was looking for. “Draco?
“Potter, I’m in no rush to die before reaching Castelobruxo. I don’t know where you got the idea that you’re a perfectly capable driver, but I can assure you if I die like this, without finishing my research, I will come back and I will haunt you until
Draco opened his mouth, ready to state the likelihood of him sharing a room with Potter, or worse, sleeping on his couch—very little—when Potter opened the front door. A ripple of powerful magic assaulted his senses, silencing his words.
Draco assumed Tainara was talking about Headteacher Berenice, but didn’t comment further. He said, “Even if she does, the creatures will never forgive me now.”
Machado suddenly appeared from wherever he had been hiding, positioning himself defensively in front of Draco, stretching his wings to protect him from Harry’s Dark magic.
A smile crept across his face as Draco followed the lead his parrot had given him. Using their bond as a map to guide him inside the woods, he could feel clearly the way the bird was going.
The toucan rolled its eyes, annoyed, sighing audibly. It barked with the tip of its beak, as if it was talking in a language only Draco couldn’t understand. The jaguar was bent forward, roaring something that sounded too much like laughter, while the tapir remained staring at its cards, too focused to notice the exchange that was happening around it.
Draco expected little from him, anyway. Saci was good company, and though his transportation magic had saved Draco’s skin just now, he was not that skilled overall. Or willing.
Hours later and with no prospect of finding anything useful, Draco was ready to give up and demand that Potter feed him, when Potter roared triumphantly.
Those not standing in circles of conversation or lying on the grass were dancing lively around the fire. There was music, a flute echoed somewhere in the distance, but it turned into a cacophony of “ha-ha” and “ooh” cries, mixed with the melody coming from whistles, drums and rattles.
“Wait, but you said,” he started, heaving a shaky breath. “You said it would search for someone who had been touched by darkness. And I have.”
eager to learn all he could, of course, but a gentle peace had settled inside him and its name was hope, and love, and home.
Fingers closed around his forearm, bringing it up. Harry’s lips were on his faded mark, making the scar from his tainted past disappear behind his kiss and the hope of something Draco hadn’t allowed himself to feel for years to surface.
Potter went on, as if he didn’t notice the way Draco’s heart swooped in his chest whenever he glanced at him, and Draco continued with what he did best: he pretended everything was okay. According to his own lax life philosophies, once he repeated something enough, it’d become true.
Francisca had kept the length of what had been left of his hair, and it now fell in waves to his cheeks, getting shorter until it reached his shaved nape. It reminded him of his sixteen years self, but a handsomer version, and Draco realised he didn’t mind it that much.
“P-Potter,” he tried, voice raspy and low. “Harry… Stop. Stop it,” Draco got out, before his door slammed open. A blinding blue light came from the corridor, dissipating the shadows quickly.
Draco took the offered hand with a roll of his eyes. “Ha-ha, you’re hilarious. Something hit me.” He took his hand back as soon as his feet touched the ground, fingers massaging the spot on his chest that had been hit.
Draco frowned, and the skin pulled over his body as if he was puckering. “No. Everyone seems… normal? I feel good. Actually. But bad. But
Harry sighed, raising both hands in defeat. “I’m not sure I should’ve done that. Homunin always knows best.” His voice was low, threatening. The power they carried crackled around the kitchen. It was dark, suffocating.
by then. Only a few things would—usually involving some amount of wine and good food—but it might help.
It wouldn’t be fair to Martin, though. But when had Martin been fair to Draco, with those bright pleading eyes and dimpled grin?
Tainara was already laughing, almost seconds before the damn stalker-parrot reached Draco’s chest, landing as inelegantly as a drunken pilot. He could swear sometimes that bird had no sense of balance—or timing.
Draco could still take his things and go back to London right that instant. There had to be a simple way to charm his Portkey to transport him back home. He could sacrifice his research and his freedom. He could even reevaluate dealing with Martin again, if that meant not having to see Harry
“Good riddance,” she told him, when Draco laid out for her the events of the untoward night one by one.
“I thought you were past that hating each other thing.” Longbottom scratched at his nape, making an effort not to stare at Draco.
Caipora stood in front of her, as red and furry as the first time Draco had laid eyes on the creature. They must have noticed him, but neither of them acknowledged his presence. They drawled furiously, keeping their voices low, as if there was someone else other than Draco listening to their little secrets.
The flames were still high, dooming, but they hadn’t advanced to the grounds of the school, and were restrained to the edge of the forest. No matter how wild they got, how powerful they became, they never crossed that invisible line.
The look of genuine interest shot at Draco was almost enough to have him melting all over the carpet of the car. It wasn't fair that Potter still had that effect on him. That Potter was so fucking hot and friendly. It was, above all, not fair how Potter clearly remembered how much Draco loved talking about himself.
“I don’t think that,” Caipora added. “But you werre touched by darkness, and that’s what this force needs.”
Harry’s fingers tightened around his skin, and Draco couldn’t contain the low, pained groan that escaped his lips. Harry didn’t even seem to notice.
“Obviously.” His retort was sharp. Draco couldn’t be less bothered about getting the language wrong. Still, he schooled his features again into something less pedantic. “I don’t speak Portuguese, either. Can’t you contact them, for Merlin’s sake?” And he added for good measure, “Please?” People responded better to someone like him—ex-Death Eater and everything, but also very temperamental—when Draco had a smile plastered on his face, even if it was a fake one, which happened often enough.
Draco’s stomach dropped. This couldn’t be happening to him. This was the worst scenario possible. Harry Potter couldn’t be his only option, it would only lead to disaster.
The snake stared at Draco for a second, before sliding under the covers, and he let the mantle of sleepiness envelop him.
Potter interrupted, rushing over his words, and Draco grinned smugly at his fluster. “She’s just a bit of a slack. And spoiled. Eating you would be too much work.” He grinned. “She’s my Eí.”
Being with Harry, between his arms, in his care, filled Draco with the tentative certainty that everything would be alright. And Draco wanted to believe it and to make Harry feel the same way around him somehow.
“Sorry for that,” Potter interceded for him, clearly amused, but still trying to contain his chuckle. “They have no filter.” He shot the kids a pointed glance, but they just kept staring at them with the same amazement.
Draco paused, glancing at the telly for a second. Was that what Potter watched religiously every day? He fixed his posture, staring at the man once more, considering how to understand what was Potter’s life as he bundled himself up alone in the cabin.
Draco peered inside, as he did every time they had to use the car. Deciding it best not to test his luck, he tied his hair in a tight ponytail, folded his sleeves and got inside in an elegant movement.
A girl with skin like autumn leaves, fine eyes, and long, dark, straight hair, eyed Draco with curiosity. “
“I found something.” Potter’s smile spread so large it was almost blinding. “Here, it’s something about an old ritual…” He slid the tome he had been looking at for the last hour across the table.
Harry fell asleep to the sound of Draco’s voice. Harry looked vulnerable sleeping; it was almost hard to picture the strong, snarky man that was always smiling at him like Draco was his world, or the man whose head was constantly assaulted by nightmares.
Harry remained silent for a few moments, staring at him with burning eyes. The music ended, and they were blanketed by a quietness that was not replaced by any other song.
Saci and his red cap were gone in a second, leaving Draco staring at the leaves his wind had made whip above him, and at the midnight sun glowing in the sky.
Potter had, with a flick of his hand—hand, not a wand in sight, Draco noticed belatedly—tilted the garage door up across the ceiling, revealing their means of transportation.
his house, Potter’d had to clarify that at Draco’s flummoxed gaping. It suited him perfectly, though. It was a wooden cabin sporting only one window on the side wall. It seemed barely large enough for a person to live in. The place was small, humble and hidden from the rest of the world.
“I don’t know, Harry. Perhaps… Perhaps I was tired of waiting? I had to do something. Even if”—Draco exhaled sharply, pressing a palm to his temple,—“alright, look. All I know—or what I’m assuming, because, really, this is insane—is a psycho gave me a fucking coconut and now the night’s gone. It’s still gone, right?” He raised his head to see Harry nodding. “I swear to Merlin, if they’re not trying to kill me, they’re not doing a good job convincing me otherwise.”
His other hand held the coconut high at the tip of his wand. Sparks started coming out of the wand. They were not actually harmful, for now, but seemed true enough to show that he was really willing to destroy that thing.
But Saci didn’t stop. It didn’t even matter that Draco had the red hat when they both went rolling on the ground. Saci’s hand closed around Draco’s throat, the other trying to reach for the coconut or the cap that had fallen near, whichever was closer.
Draco grabbed Potter’s arm, all but ready to drag him to the Jeep. Once he realised what he was doing, though, he dropped it immediately. The heat of Potter’s skin burned Draco’s fingers like a warning he ought to take more seriously. Resigned and frustrated, he let his body fall inelegantly onto the hammock on Potter’s porch, watching as the fabric adapted to his shape and ignoring Potter’s intent gaze.
“Here I thought you’d jump at the chance to learn all of that—how do you say it?—Prodigal magic,” Harry snorted, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder and dislodging Machado, who flew away annoyed. “Syryking, wandless magic, you know…”
From what he’d heard of Longbottom’s blatantly inaccurate recounts of his trip to Brazil, this was supposed to be the high season—the beginning of summer, a couple of weeks after the start of the school year—and it would be buzzing with even more people and energy in a month or two. Draco had been expecting music, loud talking, and excited chaos; not this disconcerting silence filled only with cooling charms.
Draco discerned, with the same frightening accuracy from before, as Saci ceased to be by his side. He felt it like he was living it himself. Draco turned to find that the bottom half of Saci’s body had disappeared.
“Oh, speak of the devil.” Her smile turned softer when they both caught sight of Harry walking towards them. Harry was wearing a beige shirt adorned with indigenous patterns, a colourful fabric armlet on his upper arms, and sandals. His eyes had gained a golden gleam in that magical light, and Draco found he couldn’t look away.
What Draco had asked to grant him this story was why her parents had named her Tainara, after he told her his name came from a constellation. Draco was happy enough to hear the tale behind it, musing that both their names somehow came from the skies, even if he now felt even more dazed.
Tai batted Potter's hand away, focusing solely on Draco. “Yeah. His name was Jurupari, he was indigenous, like me.” She kept talking, tumbling over her words, despite Draco’s stunned face and Potter’s apologetic smile. “According to legends, Homunin didn’t accept him and banished him from the land. It was centuries ago, you know. Some also say he was God of Darkness, or Demon of Dreams, so I don’t know how much of it is true. It was very sad and all, but I guess it’s not that bad if you’re still here.”
misdoings. You will fix this. And you will fix this soon, leave, and never come back. Am I clear, Mr Malfoy?”
“Don’t you think I would’ve figured out he’s here once I, you know, got here?” He tried tamping his anger, but it was not there anymore. Draco had known. He suspected as much, at least. It still hurt, though, that Potter had decided Draco was not worthy of the information. Even if they hadn’t parted on good terms, they… Draco never would have told anyone, Potter had to know that. “You could have given me a heads up.”
“But it was not you,” Lua growled, hands in her hair. She turned to Caipora, who was shaking her head. “Ze fuck we do now?”
Harry raised his eyes to meet Draco’s. It lasted one second before he averted his gaze. “I asked you to stay. You said no,” Harry whispered.
“Isn’t it afraid of us? Or, you know… going to eat us?” Draco added, though the creature was now nowhere to be seen. Surely it wasn’t the only one of their kind in that forest.
Draco tugged his face. “I love you, Harry. I’ve loved you for so long. And I hated you for leaving me behind.”
sorry,” Draco heard, as Potter’s calloused fingers cupped his cheeks. His voice sounded frail, too weak to relate it to the man Draco knew, his magic frantic and wild. Potter added, in a whisper, “This happens sometimes.”
Potter grinned, taking off so fast Draco had only had time to grip the open structure of the jeep as the inertia punched a breath out of his lungs.
He liked it. Draco liked the taste of flying aimlessly, of flying beside Harry. He could get used to it.
“Don’t get me wrong, I loved your hair.” Harry breathed in Draco’s scent, eagerly nibbling at his neck and collarbone, as if he hadn’t done the same just that morning. He licked a stripe of Draco’s skin, and Draco felt rather than heard the smile on Harry’s lips. “But I like your neck free like this better.”
Draco willed his thoughts in the right direction, concentrating on his feet and on the path ahead, dodging lower branches and roots on the ground trying to keep him from his prey.
, a latent, pulsing need for knowledge. He inhaled deeply, holding back the urge to ask the woman every thought rolling in his mind—
Except for something in his pocket, he thought. Draco pulled it out, surprised not to find Saci’s cap—he had been thinking of giving it back—but the tucumã seed. “I could swear I had left it at home.”
“Liked someone?” Draco gulped around the lump in his throat. It was not jealousy. Just an annoyance. Potter could like whomever he pleased. It was none of Draco’s business.
But the seed was still open, Draco realised, glancing down at his hand. It was open, and it was empty. And whatever had been hiding inside it had escaped.
?” Draco interrupted him, his astounded expression rapidly turning into a scowl. “What ritual?” He was positive he didn’t remember Longbottom talking about any ritual, but there was the matter of Draco getting constantly lost in his own thoughts or distracted about any conversation that didn’t revolve around him.
Harry raised his head and grinned at Draco. His eyes didn’t hold the usual warmth. He asked, “How are you feeling?”
Berenice’s fingers were holding him down, preventing him from leaving. Draco barely acknowledged her, snapping his eyes at Tainara once again. “Why?! Why would you do that? You’re hurting him! What do you get out of this?”
hear was the cacophony of the colourful and shiny birds chirping in the sky, the chatter of voices not so far away, and the rustle of the leaves.
Draco sighed, touching his forehead to Harry’s. “I still wish I had got the chance to decide that for myself.” Even if he knew he probably wouldn’t have come, indeed. Draco’s arms went around Harry’s waist, their bodies fitting against each other. “I’m not mad, you know.” He wasn’t, not truly, not for what mattered. He couldn’t even allow sadness to settle inside him over the fact that Harry didn’t trust him enough at the time. Draco didn’t trust himself. Or Harry, Narcissa, Pansy. Anyone. They were both so broken from the war and its scars, it would never have worked. Harry didn’t let Draco in his life, but neither had Draco.
After that clear dismissal display, though, the book refused to open again to Potter, as if knowing he was going to read it to Draco. Potter told him what he remembered, but apart from a passage about an old ritual that shaman used to perform on recently deceased people, it didn’t really help him. Draco supposed it was something significant if the school didn’t want him to know, but there was really nothing he could do about it before he won Homunin over.
If Draco still knew Potter as he used to—something he denied vehemently—this anxiety would wear off in a few days.
Draco smiled and nodded. He thought of those who had died at the war, of the part of himself had always felt ashamed of, and that should have died together with the victims of Voldemort. It made sense, Draco mused. Even after spending the best part of the last seven years mourning those who were gone—including part of himself—Draco couldn’t believe he would have wanted that for those who missed him if
, abstaining from his usual snarky comments about the characters and the stupidities of Maria do Carmo, the protagonist—he liked Nazaré better.
As excited as Draco was about learning how to drive, he wasn’t confident enough to do it alone just yet—even with Potter’s charmed map to always show him the right path home and all the protection spells on the car. Since most of the students still hadn’t returned from the carnival holidays, Potter wasn’t terribly busy. Draco had such an easy time convincing Potter to take him back to Castelobruxo that afternoon when he got a positive answer after inquiring about the Potions master of the school that the smug smile stayed plastered on his lips all the way over.
Longbottom was right, of course. Just as Draco had said, he was here for his research. It should be obvious that he wouldn’t give it up so easily.
He still felt dizzy, spewing all the way out of the forest, but his head was clearer now. Clearer than it had ever been before.
“Very small, furry and red. They keep the school safe, but are too tricky. I think there are more of her, but I only met one.” Tainara scrunched her nose, making Draco wonder if her displeasure meant more about the creature she was talking about or his whole situation. “I don’t like her. But she can accept you, maybe?”
“What the fuck, Draco? What happened?” Harry said, grabbing his arms with more force than necessary. Draco was too weak to mind it that much. “The fuck did you do?”
He was honestly wondering if his legs would be able to carry him those last few steps when warm hands cupped his face.
But Potter sounded very serious about the whole “winning the school over” thing. It was visible in his face. Potter was not smiling anymore. The green of his eyes gleamed towards Draco.
“Beautiful Imaeró transformed into Urutau, you know, the bird.” Draco didn’t know, but he nodded anyway. Tainara didn’t seem to notice, because she continued, and he let her voice wrap around him in the hazy blanket of his almost-nap. “Brown bird, has big, big mouth and is always crying like it’s very sad. It’s called ghost-bird or ‘Mother of Moon.’ Imaeró, transformed as Urutau, cries until this day, whenever she sees Tainá-Can and Denakê in the sky.”
The animal, a large parrot with red feathers, was already getting up as if nothing had happened. It flew towards them and didn’t seem to notice Draco flinching—that was the same rainbow-winged parrot he had seen with Caipora, he could swear on it—before landing on his head.
Draco had only got out of the forest safely—though ‘safely’ was used loosely—because of his bird friend. Machado guided him through the woods, avoiding whatever invisible path could lead him to Caipora or Curupira. Or
No. He had to change. He had to believe all the work he had done in the last seven years wasn't for nothing.
Draco was pretty sure he would, no matter how hard he avoided thinking about that. He snorted inelegantly, shrugging. “You’ve been talking to Harry.”
jumped out of the car before Draco had the slightest chance to answer. He took something from behind the back seat and circled the vehicle until he was on Draco’s side, opening the door for him again. “Come out. I want to show you something.”
well aimed, that left him exposed from the inside out, cracking his head into a million pieces. The pain from a sliced chest, while his blood stained the floor of the bathroom. He even knew the pain of a broken heart from back when Harry had left him for the first time.
He raked a hand through his hair, a slow movement, so as not to alert Caipora of a threat. And then the small wooden object knocked against his forehead. That’s right. He was still holding the pipe. Draco glanced at Caipora, satisfied to notice the device had caught her attention too.
But the trees had no marks. They remained the same, green leaves shining in a golden glow under the strong sunlight, reminding him the world was still the world, even if he didn’t feel like himself anymore. It was not necessarily a bad thing, though. There was a kind of peace knowing that some things stayed the same after time had passed.
Harry’s laughter made his chest wobble. “That, we can’t. But we can use the one at home, if you’re this keen on sleeping outside.”
Well, it made sense. The jaguar had beautiful fur. But Draco didn’t believe dressing splendidly was enough to justify killing innocent animals. He said so. That was probably the right answer, because Harry gifted him with a larger grin.
Harry lifted his head, lips resting against Draco’s neck. “I’m sure you would get everything right on the first try. If you’d just try.” He bit the soft skin, making Draco shriek at what would surely leave a mark. “You want me to beg to teach you?” Harry’s voice was softer now, lips nipping on the recently wounded skin, his magic healing it so fast Draco didn’t even have time to get attached to it. “Because I will.”
He turned to Berenice, but she wasn’t there anymore, nor was Tainara or his stalker-parrot—though, Draco mused, he hadn’t seen Tainara when he ran to the fire, and the bird might have just flown off in fear.
Draco’s grin spread bright and wide, and he raised the hand holding the seed-coconut. “Oh, I think you will.”
He shook his head. It was the ‘dark boy’ that did it for Draco. “What—Have you been talking to Curupira, too?”
Draco’s arms closed around Harry’s shoulders, pulling him closer, lips meeting again in a soft, almost chaste kiss. But Harry wasn’t finished.
The main building was, according to Potter, where most of the theoretical classes were taught. It also held the library—the one Draco was intent on visiting—and the Headteacher’s office. The area in front of the castle was stretched in a half-circle, divided in three sections, all of it surrounded by the same dense forest and canopy of green humidity where Draco and Potter had been minutes before.
He said, a snarky smile tugging his lips, “Harry Potter, did you start actually reading books during these seven years, or do you have a Granger here to fill you in on important information?”
Tainara had told him that not only was Lua supposed to be one of those creatures from Brazilian folklore—Cuca, or something like that, and it explained
Harry flinched again, this time harder, pulling away almost a step. He cast his gaze downward, briefly focusing on Draco’s lips instead of his grey eyes.
Draco smiled again, genuinely now, despite himself. This man was… something else. Potter was different from what he remembered of him, yet the grin he directed at Draco still bore so much resemblance to the Harry he knew. He tried to reconcile the Harry he used to shag (or make love to—same difference, he argued) with the knowledgeable one that sat by his side.
There was nothing extraordinary about the dining hall, and it was a relief to finally find something normal around here. Round tables were distributed around the ample space, chairs of different shapes and sizes positioned around each of them. There was no distinct separation between staff and students, and everyone seemed free to choose where they wanted to eat.
“What?!” Draco didn’t even care that his voice sounded like a shrill. It was becoming impossible to control his growing anxiety, and their silence did nothing for the churning in his guts.
As for the tornado, it couldn’t have been Rudá—he was too much of a sucker, and he had probably run away from the wind when it closed around Draco. It had to be Saci, Francisca told him, a mischievous boy that could control the wind. It also explained Draco’s hair. Saci liked to braid horses’ tails, towels, and everything he could get his hands on—he distantly remembered a thing Harry had said about Saci right after they met at the Portkey Station. Since Saci apparently resented Draco, well, Draco could guess the rest.
“Heya, Draco,” Tainara, Potter’s rebel student, said. Her smile was as bright as the sun, and almost as blinding. She had no headdress today, although there was a lonely black feather hanging from her ear, complimenting the drawings in black paint adorning her features. Draco made a mental note to ask her about the paintings.
“Oh no, I think he wants to mate with you.” Francisca was already bent forward with laughter when she said that.
He walked for far longer than he remembered walking last. It had surely been hours when he found them. The person, almost entirely covered in long tousled red hair, was scrunched against an animal that looked a lot like a giant rabbit lying motionless in a pool of blood. A metal contraption rested abandoned by their side, stained with the same blood tainting the grass. A
Still left out of the network, Draco could barely understand more than a few words that the students were saying. He was sure that there were over two languages being spoken at the same time. The refusal of the school stung deeper, and he put his notebook down, temporarily giving up his notes about the tomes Tainara had got open for him.
After stealing Saci’s cap, Draco met him every day. Tainara still claimed she didn’t like the rainforest’s creatures and, well, Draco hadn’t really told anyone else about it, so he was always alone in his endeavours with the one-legged boy.
“I do wish.” Draco gave Saci his best smile, against all reason telling him he was stepping on dangerously thin ice in trying to control that boy. “And to my knowledge, you have to obey me. Please, tell me more about the coconut.”
Not heartbreak, not loneliness or loss, but that thrill of hope for something Draco never thought he’d have back at the reach of his hands. He didn’t want to let it go. He couldn’t let it go.
Harry Potter was not a sacred being, he was not incapable of wrongdoings. Harry Potter, above all, was
There was a hum of powerful magic around her. Draco assumed it had to come from the shielded greenhouse behind her, rather than the woman herself.
—The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas, by an author called Machado de Assis. He wasn’t going far at that rate, but it
Draco would prove them wrong. Starting with the fact that he was really in Brazil. Even standing there, it was hard to believe.
He felt dizzy, basking in everything happening at once around him: the blinding lights that seemed even brighter than he remembered. Flames dancing on the wood of the bonfire, trying to hug him in their searing embrace. Every single tepid patch of skin that touched him whenever they crossed arms, or stumbled upon one another. Draco was different. That place was different.
Draco was becoming increasingly adapted to pursuing those treks, avoiding branches and keeping himself and his colourful clothes intact while braving the forest. It was easier using Harry’s Jeep, naturally, but his feet would do for now.
“A nightmare that attacked me,” he repeated in a murmur. Saying it out loud didn’t make it any more plausible, though.
Still, who was she? Draco had read so much about the myths from indigenous Brazilian folk, but every time he read a new book, it felt like he knew absolutely nothing about what was happening around him.
His body laid bare on Harry’s mattress, sweat prickling his skin, glueing them together. Draco’s leg dangled on top of Harry’s thighs, head resting against his chest. He tried not to think about what that meant—because it meant something. Draco didn’t do casual, not after everything.
The Headteacher didn’t seem as relieved about it as Potter, but she said nothing else before nodding and leaving them to it.
Potter shrugged. “Yeah, sort of. You can come with, but I’ll have to go to the forest and…” He stared at Draco from top to bottom, pointedly glancing at his inconvenient clothes. Draco abstained from pointing out that he was a researcher, not an explorer, and that he had packed accordingly.
Draco snorted inelegantly, his laughter merged with the long, distant screeches of the shadow creatures. Shaking his head, he walked away from Berenice and her feeble protection. “Get the fuck away from me.”
and he was once again sated when they finished eating. Fernando promised to introduce him to Lua, the Herbology professor, whose whereabouts during lunch were a mystery. He took Draco directly to the greenhouse instead.
Potter’s magic had always felt warm and comfortable. It tasted citric on Draco’s tongue and accepted him easily.
Surely he would remember how Draco got when he was pressured like this. Possibly the same way he got when he was hungry, sleepy, thirsty, or just in a foul mood overall. Cranky and sardonic.
Draco mirrored Harry’s movements, albeit with much less strength and determination. This whole fight… Why was it happening? The reason behind it escaped his grasp so fast as it escalated to something he couldn’t control. “Then explain to me how the fuck I drank it! You know what, it doesn’t matter.” Draco splayed his hands across the table. “I would have opened the seed even if I was sober. Probably, even if I knew what it’d do. There. Are you happy now?”
Potter snorted, and lifted his arm, index finger pointing to the top of the canopy, the sky, or… no, to a branch. Something moved on top of it.
—but that she was like that, unfriendly and unpleasant, with everyone. It was not exclusively directed at him.
The conversation offered him a respite from his own thoughts as it veered into charted territory. Draco’s head perked up when Potter’s unmistakable accent echoed in the field.
magic. This should be a place for everyone.” Even as the words left her lips, even if they were true, Draco felt the vitriol blemishing them into something hideous.
Draco snorted. He could imagine, yes. “Do you really know everything that’s happening on the grounds?”
As his fingers followed the path of Harry’s tattoos, Draco harked as Harry explained each of their meanings to him in the night's silence—
His legs though, were about to give away beneath him. So when Harry—bright and warm in the sunlight—caught him in his arms, Draco gladly let his own weight lean on Harry.
“I want to fix everything. I really do, but—” he stated, motioning broadly while trying to keep the pace next to her. She was a small woman, but each step she took seemed like five of his somehow. “—but, I can’t. Not alone. I need you and your help. You don’t want this sun to last forever, I’m sure. And I want to help,” he panted. “So, why don’t we assist each other?”
!” she cried, trying very hard to keep a straight face. It didn’t work, and she was soon bending over the counter with laughter.
She eyed him suspiciously, and didn’t move to take the pipe. Instead, Caipora said, “The same day you arrrive, boy, things starrrt to go wrrrong and my prrecious thing got stolen.”
He smiled, laughed, and then gave in and yelled with joy. Potter followed suit, their cries startling the closer birds, who sang in tandem with them.
Well, he should have known that. He probably did, what with his compulsively controlling tendencies. He might have just forgotten momentarily, because of the indignation about being left waiting for—he checked his watch again—three hours and five minutes now.
Saci didn’t wait. With a hand on Draco’s shoulder, he was taking Draco back to the eye of the storm at that same instant. Draco blinked his nausea away, taking in Jurupari’s magic spreading across the grounds in waves of profane energy.
you a lot,” she said, tugging his arm again until they were walking out of the dining room. “He couldn’t shut the fuck up about you ever since he found out you were coming. Honestly, it was annoying. ‘
Draco tried to lift his head twice before giving up due to laziness, instead tipping his chin and staring at Harry with an eyebrow raised. “Your observational skills are unparallelled, Potter.”
He released a deep breath, not thinking too hard about how relieved he felt to have found her again—or to have been found. Just… not to be alone, when Headteacher Berenice’s words still echoed painfully inside him.
His accent was different, his tone. Potter’s speech was slow, melodious and harmonic. It was a composition that Draco could no longer decipher.
“No risk of that. There are so many protection spells in those, that it’s easier to get stuck there rather than fall from it.”
“Draco, we need to go back to the school!” Harry’s fingers, scorching hot, grabbed Draco’s wrists. “They might need help!”
Two things were becoming increasingly clear to Draco during that conversation: Rudá was probably one of the creatures Francisca and Tainara talked about constantly; and Draco was going to be insane when he finally went back to London.
Draco kept muttering to himself all throughout his trudge, kind of wishing Potter was there to hear what exactly he thought about him—even though he knew it was much more from his exhaustion and rage than truthfulness. Listening to his own voice, and concentrating on the one good English accent he heard these days, was the only thing he could do not to fall on Curupira’s traps, as the surrounding noises—crickets, growling beasts, the bloody deafening leaves brushing against each other—only grew louder.
Draco was used to the hum of the city; loud neighbours and the constant honking of cars. The silence was oppressing, and he couldn’t really control his wandering mind when it got louder than what was around him. It had been a while since he had enjoyed his own company, since he had heard his own voice talking to him and not only pictured his
It was easy. Draco could say no to evil, he… he hadn’t been able to do that in the past, but he had changed. He was good now; he
“She lives with her tribe. I’ve never been to visit her, though, they’re really private. But if you ever need someone who understands this forest, that’d be Tai.”
“I’m the last one,” the indigenous girl went on, voice now graver, solemn. She lifted a hand and Harry did the same. The shadows began to gather around them again.
Harry’s right arm was colourful; the sun shining brightly on his shoulder, and the blue sky behind it descending to his elbow, where it turned into the sea, a boat aimlessly floating on the immensity of the ocean depicted on Harry’s skin. It didn’t stop there. The blue turned darker. It followed the path of his forearm, turning into depths of the sea, with radiant fishes swimming in its waters.
Completely unable to utter comprehensible words, to organise his thoughts, Draco turned to face Potter. Despair grew inside him, gutting the hopes that things would be better once he cured those people affected by the war.
A big, winged animal descended upon them, dropping something in Caipora’s hands. It was bigger than normal parrots, but the long beak and its features still reminded Draco of one. The bird displayed colours as bright as those of the forest. Part of its body was covered in red feathers, with rainbow colours at the tip of its wings. It was wonderful, and it stared at him directly before chirping and flying away.
Draco chuckled, pushing him. “You know I wouldn’t have followed you anywhere. You were an even greater mess than I was at the time.”
Draco’s brows shot up. “Excuse me?” Indignation gnawed inside him. What was that now? Potter used to love his robes and his neatly combed platinum bands, even when they had been stained by darkened eyes and a malnourished constitution. “I’ll have you know my attire is perfectly respectable, as opposed to those rags you call clothing.”
Draco was still in awe at how deep the knowledge of the girl ran, but he realised it was probably because she lived there. She breathed those stories daily. She also taught him other legends, and tried to explain to him how magical these lands were; alive, pulsing, sentient. Draco could
Not that he’d comprehend them, anyway, so it was understandable that they didn’t really care about him.
Draco huffed, rolling his eyes, in a peak of courage he didn’t really know the source of. “Seriously, now? What with the nicknames? Can we, please, talk about the real problem here? I’m tired, hungry, and thirsty. I can’t take another step and all of this is because I need your help.
Draco snorted. “I don’t need saving, Potter. What would she do? Bore me to death? She’s not kicking me out now, she’s had plenty of opportunities.” He took a step closer, resting a hand on the small of Harry’s back. “Also, the woman seemed to notice we’d need some privacy.”
Harry’s grin was like the sun, Draco had always thought, envious of whoever had a glimpse of it. Draco had wanted Harry’s grin, he had wanted his eyes, his attention, lavishing over him and only him. And Harry was giving him it all. “I love you, too.”
The most popular version of her in Brazil is that of walking and talking crocodile because of a TV show called "Sítio do Pica-pau Amarelo" that depicted many Brazilian tales.
Well, Draco would be gone as soon as he fixed this one last thing. His research be damned. He didn’t have the energy to deal with any of that anymore. As bitter as failure felt on his tongue, Draco just wanted to go home and curl under the sheets, as painful as it was admitting it.
And that brought the third thing one should know about Draco Malfoy. Despite his usual inability to control his temper, he was an excellent liar. He wouldn’t have survived the war if he wasn’t.
The Pink Dolphin morphs into a tall, handsome, and elegantly dressed man at night. He wears an all-white suit and a hat to cover his blowhole since the shape-shifting is not total. He, then, goes to the villages and seduces women, impregnating them and running off to the river when the sun is born. In smaller towns, for many years (and possibly until today) many women with kids with unknown fathers were said to been have impregnated by the Pink Dolphin.
Owing Potter because of that help was an ache that kept niggling Draco’s ego. Staying with him was even worse.
Still, when Draco saw the big dark cloud of smoke coming up from the forest near the Living Section, he didn’t run in the opposite direction. Draco and Tainara followed Francisca and José, and when they reached the place that seemed to originate all that smoke, it looked even worse than how it seemed from afar.
Tainara chuckled, shaking her head. “Okay, calm down. First, I don’t believe Harry wants you gone. He really likes you.”
. That he was good. As good as someone considering slamming the Golden Boy’s head against the wall could be (that had to be a justified exception).
“Potter, I’ll need to research every hour of every day, you don’t understand…” Draco's hands grabbed his neatly tied ponytail, fidgeting with it in a way he didn’t have the energy to care for right now. Draco needed to break something. He needed it so much.
Harry smiled at him once, nodded, and yelled. It was a deliberate, shrill cry, similar to the ones Draco had heard before.
Draco still knew the way to Harry’s body; how he squirmed when Draco kissed the soft spot behind his ear, how he moaned as Draco’s hands skated up and down his back, the exact way his arousal became apparent when Draco rolled his hips underneath him.
Tainara helped him keep guard when she wasn’t learning from Harry—Harry, who was behaving like nothing had happened, but wouldn’t talk to Draco. They both took turns in watching the place, until finally Lua came out the door and Draco was the one standing there, waiting for her.
Draco wasn’t sure the coolness of Potter’s tone was genuine acceptance or resignation over the fact that there were no answers for him. He let the subject drop.
But this wouldn’t do. Draco couldn’t be amazed by every little thing Potter did, like a teenage fan just getting out of puberty. He had to get a hold of himself. Harry was not all of that.
Potter sighed, relieved, the smile creeping back onto his face. It was a beautiful sight. “Kind of. To my place, actually.” Harry—Potter!—was already shrinking Draco’s luggage—a heavy dark wooden trunk and a small hand case—and storing them in his pocket. “You can’t get to the school by magic like this. It doesn’t react well to Apparition or Portkeys.”
The woman, however, was the sole clue Draco had of how to fix things. The tucumã was a seed, and there was no one else there who would know more about it than her, as she was not only an Herbology teacher and Potions master, but a legendary creature of the forest.
Draco was the only other person there touched by darkness. His Dark Mark burned, and he contained the urge to scratch it.
So, he hugged Harry tighter, pressing Harry's face against his own chest. Shaking his head slowly to Saci, Draco’s lips mouthed
Draco frowned and contained the impulse of looking back at the building he had just come from. There was no way that, given the option, he would choose not to be there. Not to access the knowledge that the school held. “
“What is that?” Draco’s voice was barely a whisper, fear of scaring the creature or disturbing its peace preventing him from raising it.
José, Draco marvelled, was a comfortably quiet companion. He was so different from his partner, Francisca, that the silence felt like it had a voice. It probably did, in how it stretched between the trunks of the trees, in the gaps between the leaves. This silence screamed.
What if Harry really wanted Draco to leave? Draco could survive that, of course, it wouldn’t be the first time. He just… didn’t want his time in Brazil to end like that. He didn’t want his time with
The woman’s deep, umber skin shone with a glint of bronze under the sun, the light hitting the long, curly hair cascading around her shoulders. She was leaning against a pillar. Her face opened in a delighted expression as soon as she saw them. The woman beckoned for Harry to move closer. There was a man with her. His russet brown features denoted more seriousness. He smiled softly at them, tugging the wavy fringe from his face and distracting himself from whatever he was staring at by his feet before.
Though there was never a sign of Harry in the mornings, there was always breakfast waiting for Draco in the kitchen. Knowing Harry’s schedule by heart aided his attempts to keep shunning him. Draco would drive to the school alone, following Machado’s guidance, and avoided bumping into Harry or the Headteacher there.
The sight almost threw him off track. It had been her all along. The girl he had considered a friend.
“Merlin,” he grumbled, torso bent forward and holding his churning stomach underneath his hands as nausea spread over his body. Heaving a deep breath, Draco made sure he could move without spewing, before saying, “Fuck. A little warning next time would be appreciated.”
There was something about the Brazilian weather—humid and warm—that made him slack and soft all over, willing to lie down after lunch and contentedly sleep until he felt numb and could no longer think. The effect was similar to what he felt after fucking Harry, Draco mused.
Draco doubted that. But he complied, because he was a good boy and he had no intention of distracting Potter and accidentally causing a car crash.
After that night, he started to wonder if that was the reason Potter was really hiding in the middle of nowhere. Shame, and not freedom. Caipora had said Draco might still have darkness in him, but… he was not the only one. Everyone has a bit of darkness inside. He just hoped Potter’s light shone brighter than his shadows.
“You could say that.” If by ‘not very common’ he meant only the most powerful wizards—and Harry sodding Potter, obviously—learned how to do it. Were they all prodigies here? Draco felt suddenly dizzy.
Draco’s eyes snapped open, focusing on Potter, even if it was too dark to make out his precise expression. It was better this way. The night hid secrets Draco wasn’t sure he was willing to uncover, and they were right there, on the edge of Potter’s features.
Draco’s empty coconut cup ended up abandoned at another table when Harry dragged him to the edge of the living section. Harry seemed to believe it was too noisy down there, and that the night was perfect for sky gazing, which ended up with them climbing up one of the biggest trees.
“These creatures can be tricky to deal with. They were out for you from day one,” José added, giving him one of his small smiles.
Draco wanted to ask if she wasn’t evil, but held his tongue. “Right. But if it was inside it, why didn’t it get out when I first opened it.”
The problem was, José could be right at some level. Draco did like his new clothes, but they were very far from the sombre and neutral colours he usually wore. He hadn’t found pieces to his taste in the nearest city and ended up with a lot of colourful and patterned outfits. Potter seemed to appreciate them, which only increased his suspicions that Potter had only taken him to a store with those kinds of clothes on purpose—though it seemed like it was the only one in town. He couldn’t be sure. The git denied it, but Draco wasn’t convinced.
Draco’s jaw fell. The parrot had come back, and was nibbling at his ear again, but he didn’t pay it much notice. The bird did that all the time. He said, “It was one of the largest empires of America.”
“I’m curious about something though,” Harry started, fingers softly stroking Draco’s hair, disentangling the knots he had put there himself while gripping to his platinum bands with force.
Draco just had to survive living with Harry Potter for a while. Until he found out how to seduce the school, while still moving forward with his research and trying not to melt under the Brazilian weather. Feasible.
“It’s…” he started, but soon found he had no words for it, and the ones he had didn’t seem to be enough.
Having Saci’s allegiance again was brilliant, but it didn’t really help in the bigger picture. Saci had no idea how to help Draco—or the inclination to do so—and was deemed useless. Saci kept Draco company, however, whenever Tainara and the professors who didn’t hate him were too busy, or when he was trying to run away from Harry. None of them was much help, really, but it was better than staying alone.
Potter laughed from where he was leaning against the baluster and crossed his arms, his tattoos stretching with the pulled muscles. “It’s carnival. Kids are supposed to go partying. Don’t argue with this. You just have to accept it. Also, you could come ‘gallivanting around the forest’ with me, you know. Should I take it personally that you don’t want my company?”
“When Harry’s not giving lessons or picking you up, he’s our assistant,” José added, and shrugged. “He’s alright.”
“Right—” he started, and when his throat tightened around the words, he tried again, “Fair enough. How do we do this?”
And here was another quite self-destructive tendency of his: to poke danger with the tip of a knife. It was usually unintentional, the way he evoked the worst in people.
wants me gone. I’ll bet you Saci can’t even look me in the eye right now.” And he wasn’t annoyed about the latter. He was definitely not. He didn’t care about Saci.
Draco nodded, unworried about the girl’s rebellious tendencies. He had too much in his head to think hard about other people’s problems right now. “She also suggested I talk to a… Caipora?”
“A few months, maybe. As long as it takes to finish my research,” Draco replied, shoving his hands in his pockets. “Don’t worry. I’ll figure it out and… erm, win the school over quickly.” Merlin, it was hard even getting the words out of his mouth. “You don’t have to worry about me staying at your place for too long.”
—that he hadn’t been accepted by Homunin. That was if Potter hadn’t already gossiped about it to them, of course. Draco nodded, plastering a grin on his face.
Draco didn’t try talking to Lua again, and whenever they crossed paths in the corridors or the fields, she would hiss at him. Draco was increasingly sure she was trying to curse him into a frog or something of the kind. Nothing too bad had happened yet, so he tried not to keep his expectations so low.
The lie “My fiancé” tumbled out of his lips before Draco could hold it back. Why should he, though? What did Potter think, after all? That Draco would wait for him after all these years? No. Draco had got himself a prestigious job and an amazing fiancé—even if he had just one of those things left now. Potter wasn’t entitled to that detail, and he was so unobservant he wouldn’t even notice the lack of an engagement ring.
“It’s far-fetched, really, to believe Caipora will just fall at your charms, but—” She raised her index finger. “It might actually work. Think about it, they are certainly not expecting you’ll confront them. And certainly not with the help of one of ours.”
He had tried reaching her near the greenhouse, but the place was so tightly shut against his presence that the magic prevented him from getting close to it way before he was near the building. And so Draco waited. Lua would have to leave at one point.
He hadn't been able to kill Dumbledore when he tried, but he hadn't wanted to, in reality. He gave Martin up, but he had never really loved his former fiancée. Draco came really close to giving up after the war, but he hadn't. He gathered his pieces after Harry left, when the world still hated him, and made something of himself. He studied, he started his research; he changed what his name meant.
Later that night, when Draco was dozing on top of Harry, Nazaré crept on the bed around his thighs, cold and malleable.
It was a second before Potter burst inside wearing nothing but joggers, slamming the door against the wall. “What happened?!”
wrong. How could he have thought he had a chance in that place? Draco believed he had really changed, that he was good now, that he deserved to feel happy, to feel something—
. But I didn’t think you knowing it would change anything. You wouldn’t have come, and… I—I was so fucking tired of people thinking they knew what’s best for me. I needed to get away from all of that.”
The Living Section had been transformed into something even more magical that night. Right in the centre of the main field, the flames of a bonfire made the shadows dance in a slow, hypnotising pattern. Many small light spheres weaved between the trees, casting a yellowish glow on the furthest and darkest spots, where the silvery cold brilliance of the moon couldn’t reach. Some vivid yellow and red ribbons had been tied to the branches and swayed softly in the cool breeze.
The bird bit Saci’s head with its powerful beak, squeaking loudly. Saci didn’t let go of Draco, but he was so distracted trying to scare Machado away—and seemingly dissatisfied by whatever had happened—Draco just had to point his wand at the seed, near to where they had landed and screamed at the top of his lungs, “
Fortunately, Lua was actually at the door when they turned the path that led there, almost as if she was waiting for them.
The quietness of the place was getting under his skin. He pulled the collar of his robes, trying to keep his smile in place.
There were no students there, only two people who seemed old enough to be professors or in the staff of Castelobruxo. Relief washed over him.
they kept repeating. Potter had kindly translated it to “Harry’s friend” but Draco couldn't be sure. Not with Potter’s permanent smirk.
“Harry,” he corrected, but then quieted. The uneasy energy around him betrayed Harry was still waiting for something.
“You remember, right, Draco? The first story I told you,” she spoke softly and in a low tune, but her voice still travelled across the field into their minds, into their bodies. She would be heard whether or not they wanted to.
Potter’s grin was soft, distracting. He shook his head and raised both hands in a placating gesture before pulling away from the railing. “Fine. Anything you want, love. I’ll teach you how to drive, as long as you promise to behave. And not to disappear again.” Potter didn’t seem to notice the slip of the endearing term in the middle of his sentence, or Draco’s cheeks flushing deeper, as he walked back to the vehicle. “You need a licence, though. It’s a bit tricky to get one here, so try to drive only around the woods.” Smirking, Potter added, “There are no patrol cars to catch you there.”
The sky was already darkening when Draco took notice of his pained muscles. Unwilling to stop, but knowing his body would thank him for it, Draco reluctantly descended back into the mass of dense leaves mantling the forest on the way to the wide field they had come from.
that something dark? Where was it? He almost wanted it to hurry and meet him soon, so he could just say no to it and go back to his life.
Both of them froze, slowly turning to face the steely eyes shooting daggers at them. Or, more specifically, at Draco held between Harry’s arms.
Still keen on not having Draco out of his sight—not that Draco would have any means to leave alone—Potter got José Silva to drive him back.
He pulled out the pocket watch, glancing at the numbers on display. The watch read half-past seven now, which meant half-past three where he currently was, and three hours since he had first started checking the time.
There was a startling variety of trees saluting him, towering into the sky in many heights, lengths, and hues of brown; some with trunks thinner than his waist, others so thick his arms wouldn’t fit around them.
Still, she was the one preventing him from reaching Harry. And this was something he could not forgive.
, he believed, and unquestionable fibs tumbled out of his lips with the same ease of heaving a breath.
Draco’s knees faltered, and he fell, hitting the floor in a soft thud. His heart was beating so hard he could feel it in his throat. His palms gripped at the grass, grounding him to something palpable that was not trying to kill him. He took a deep breath, taking in the deafening
Harry rushed things as if it would be their last day on earth. Draco let him for a while, lavishing in the attention he finally got from Harry, and not applying himself fully to Harry’s impossible tasks.
It was easy tapping into his magic, and finding the strand of it that connected to Machado’s proved to be something natural, as well. It was like feeling the sunlight inside his skin, inside his bones, warming his whole body, connecting him to something else. Something
José raised an eyebrow at him. “He’s intense, but he’s nice and he seems to really like you. I’m guessing he messed up.” He shrugged, an infinitesimal movement that shifted only his shoulders, arms still locked on the steering wheel, and Draco found being his passenger made uneasiness grow inside him.
Saci continued, “It’s eating the school’s magic. Using it to attack Homunin.” He pointed at the field again. “It’s making everything dark, see?”
The safety of the ritual was not the entirety of Draco’s concerns, though. It was hard to think that a fire like that—alive, breathing—could be dangerous. It was pure light. The problem was… Draco was not pure.
Draco slammed his mug on the table with a bit more force than strictly necessary. “And here I thought you knew
“Oi, Harry,” Francisca started again, looking pointedly at the man. “I think Berê was looking for you, after the—wait.” She lifted her head as if scenting something in the air. The pause only lasted a couple of seconds before. “
“I truly am sorry. Saci decided to braid every animals’ tail just before I left. They had me deal with that,” Harry exhaled, as if this was something ordinary, a reasonable excuse for his three-hour tardiness. He turned to the clerk as she chuckled behind the counter. “Hey, Nanda
His left arm, though, was all black and white. Its pictures started from a collection of bird silhouettes on his collarbone. This side showed the moon on a cloudy sky, and the forest below where the black dog stared at Draco. The roots of the forest spread like veins on Harry’s skin, covering his hand and fingers in an elaborate pattern.
Half of the brooms had been abandoned on the grass; the other half simply floated around, following their owners as the kids assembled around Potter and Draco.
Draco went back to his books and just stayed there—unable to return them to the library, because without Tainara, most of them refused to even let him touch them—hesitant to leave them here in the open.
Saci hunched his shoulders. “Combined magic. Not with Eí. With my magic. Harry has to fight it, though.”
A hopeful smile tugged Draco’s lips, as he watched Harry’s eyes turn from night black to his usual green at Berenice’s soft words. Black tears still cascaded out of them, marring his skin, but his eyes were alive.
“Wait,” Potter blurted, staring at him appraisingly, eyes lingering on his long hair held back by an elastic band. There wasn’t anything hungry about the look, but it still made Draco’s cheeks burn and his knees falter. “Don’t you have anything else to wear?”
Draco snorted, forcing himself to look away, not to stare at the deep expectant green eyes. “You think I do, Harry?” He shrugged. “Still, I’m here… I want to be with you now, because you make me feel special. That’s purely egoistic, really.”
Potter snorted, leaning against the door frame looking as if he had no concern in the world. “Sorry, that was Nazaré,” he said, though he didn’t sound sorry at all.
It was a small bayou, round and flat, surrounded by slopes with smaller trees and plants holding them together. Resting on the water, though, were the biggest water lilies Draco had ever seen. Large green leaves spread across the surface of the lake, a slow stream making them move swiftly from here to there. None of the buds had opened, but they were still beautiful and large enough to hold the weight of a person. Even Machado seemed to agree, trading his shoulder for one of the lilies in a heartbeat.
By episode ten, they dropped the translation spells because the acting was just so good Draco couldn’t miss a thing, even if it meant Potter had to explain what was happening at every scene. Potter didn’t seem to mind it that much, chuckling amusedly at each of Draco’s stupid questions—
“Well, yes, actually,” Draco started, staring at the trees instead of Potter. “It’s a mystery, to be honest. I’m sure you’ve heard about the people who were declared dead and buried some years ago. Who, after years of their alleged deaths, returned with no memory, showing up all over London after the war and… an urge to obey.” Draco waited for a beat. Harry hummed in acknowledgement. “What left these people in that state was a potion made by plants native to this region. It was a long shot, and a complete coincidence that Longbottom had some seeds that matched a few of the ingredients. I started researching South American herbology, and I…”
The wheels screeched loud enough to have him reeling, and they were thrown forward by the rebound. Draco grabbed the dashboard before his face could hit it.
“You don’t underrrstand anything about our magic, Drrragon Boy,” Caipora said, and it didn’t sound like she was coming to his rescue, she just sounded judgmental. “You think yourr magic worrrk herre, it don’t. You think things you do in yourr countrry worrk herre, they don’t. You listen to us now. If you free the night,
It didn’t matter. Draco would have time to go back there soon, without the disrupting presence of Potter’s eyes, his voice, his whole body.
It was such a Potter thing to do—pursuing a career mounted on a wooden stick. But it was, as much as Draco tried to fight the image, something undeniably beautiful.
Saci jumped outside at the same time Harry’s whirlwind filled the room, making everything around Draco fly and crash against the walls. And then, Draco was plunged into the most complete darkness-filled quietness again.
They both quieted after that. Draco sipped his tea too quickly, grimacing as the hot liquid scorched his throat.
It was mostly Harry’s fault, Draco thought. But the place, Homunin and Brazil, and the Rainforest, had their share of the blame. “I like it here. I never thought I would say that.” Or honestly come to like the place, but he did. And it was easier admitting it to José than to the one person he shared a bed with every night.
The ritual, they explained, comprised of accepting a flame from the Pyre of Iaké and letting Draco’s magic absorb it. According to Potter, in practical terms, it was like it would be consumed by his body. Draco wouldn’t feel anything but a heat spreading in his chest.
?!” He cupped Potter’s face, turning it one way and another, checking his wounds. Nothing seemed too serious. “You’re hurt. You were there, weren’t you?”
There, perched on the stone platform that had once held a living fire, was Tainara. She had a smirk plastered on her lips and a hand resting on Harry’s nape as he was kneeling on the floor.
happening between them. And it took only a few minutes of prying for Draco to spill the whole truth to her. How the school had rejected him. How he had made no progress in his research because he was trying to win over every magical creature that lived in that place. How they kept toying with him and playing with his life. How he had messed everything up by opening something he didn’t fully understand and how it was so hot he couldn’t think properly half of the time. And, finally, how he ended up locking himself up at the house to stay inside the cooling charms, but in reality he was just too tired to deal with anything. Draco had no clue of how to begin to fix things. He wanted his home and his bed so badly it hurt. But it hurt even more to realise his home was that cabin in the woods, and his bed was Harry’s bed, with Harry lying by his side.
Draco glanced back at Rudá. But the man had completely vanished. So had the animals playing with him before, despite the abandoned cards flying menacingly in the vortex. He and his bird-friend had been completely abandoned—if the tornado wasn’t Rudá’s doing, that was.
It had been a long time since he had last flown—it was something difficult to do in Muggle London—and Draco hadn’t even realised he missed it. He wasn’t sure if he still had the gist of it until he mounted on the broom. But his body remembered it, and he barely lost his balance once as he got on.
She was gone before Harry arrived, and his face creased in a frown. “I was about to rescue you from her.”
excited, and his heart wasn’t tripping. It was just anger feeding him, burning his cheeks and setting his jaw taut.
After Harry had left, Draco convinced himself he’d never wanted Harry’s attention. But what a lie it had been. Draco had always been scraping for Harry’s attention in the past, for Harry’s eyes on his, his words, even if they hurt. When Harry had hit him with that curse in the prefect’s bathroom in sixth year, Draco couldn’t have helped the hopefulness sparking inside him. He had got something of Harry, even if it’d only been his anger and the scars it had left Draco with. And then, after the war, when Harry had given him his broken pieces, his kisses and his touch, Draco finally understood how magnificent it was to have something of him that wasn’t hatred.
The days that week unfolded smoothly and quickly. Soon the students were back, and classes had started again. In search of something to do, Draco ended up opening up and studying the guarana Caipora had given him, but it was just a regular fruit. Chemically, it resembled one ingredient of his potion, but more like a distant relative than something he could properly use. Still, it was all the confirmation he needed that he was in the right place.
“Actually,” she added, tying the rope firmly around Draco’s wrist, before doing the same to her own. “These clothes will not work, sorry. Excuse me.” Without a second thought, Francisca transfigured his robes to a simpler version of clothing.
Saci shrugged. “Ye shald give it back to me, anyway. It’s not like ye could open it, even if ye wanted. Ye’ll never open Boiuna’s seal.”
“I know, we just…” Potter started and seemed at a loss for words for the first time since Draco had got here. Evidently, he felt as uncomfortable near the professor as Draco felt displaced in the school.
Harry had him on the shore. Half of Draco’s body splayed across the grass, his legs underwater with Harry between them, taking him apart so easily. Draco wondered how he had survived so long without Harry in his life.
So, after having told Tainara what happened, and having planned everything out, she had left Draco at the edge of the forest, promising to keep Harry thinking Draco was deep in reading, like she had done the day he had met Rudá. Draco didn’t dwell on that and how she knew where he had gone, instead focusing on the task at hand.
Berenice tugged his arm, forcing Draco to finally look at her. “It will not go in the seed by itself. It will find the next available person.”
Draco tried to ignore the gnawing feeling eating his insides and convinced himself it had nothing to do with the fact that Potter wasn’t there with him. He could very well handle it without him. Also, according to Potter himself, Francisca was the best one in dealing with those beings—
“The husband sent three messengers to get the night from her mother, and the snake gave them a sealed tucumã seed, saying the night was inside it and they should not open it. But men—like ye—are curious, and they heard noises, and broke the seal and opened the seed.”
According to Potter, they were right at the centre of the castle and the school’s ground. For centuries it had been considered a sacred tree by the people inhabiting these lands. When the time had come to build a haven for wizards and witches, it was only natural that it converged at this point. The tree kept growing in size through the years, a feat that could only be explained by the obscene amount of magic that fed it daily.
Harry shifted in his chair. “You didn’t think about what you were doing, didn’t consider the consequences, and—You messed up everything, Draco.” His voice sounded strained, pained. “You were so selfish. My life was fine before you got here, and now… Everything is…”
Working on a plan to fix his mistakes helped as well, since it would set a deadline for that torment. As soon as Draco worked everything out, he’d be able to go home and be away from all of that.
“I missed you, your smell, the touch of your skin,” Harry’s words fell against Draco’s skin, warmth spreading from the mark, through his arm, to his chest.
Draco shook his head, but Tainara didn’t catch the movement, intent as she was on finding something in the book.
down his throat to ease the burn. Surprisingly, it worked. It was not that bad. But Draco was not about to admit it.
Longbottom chuckled, his image turning more frayed, voice muffled. “Oh, and try not to run from Harry too.”
“What the—” Draco pulled back, hand burned and spasming from the shock. There was no apparent wound on his skin, only a slight red stain and the memory of the sting.
“What the—Get off of me, you—” Draco tried to scare the thing away, but the bird only clawed tighter on Draco’s head until it started hurting. Draco squealed in an undignified manner, waving his hands. “Stop it, you! It hurts!” The animal seemed to finally realise what it was doing, and traded Draco’s head for his shoulder, the beak nibbling his ear. “What are you doing? Go away—shoo.”
The bit of information had been given so freely it took Draco by surprise. He darted a glance at Potter, satisfied to notice the flush in his cheeks, but said nothing else.
Therefore, it didn’t matter what anyone thought about it—especially Narcissa and Pansy, with their claims of
Draco didn’t let him finish. His stomach stopped churning, and he stabbed a finger against Saci’s torso. “She’s one of you! She’s—
, had subsided a little because of how good it felt. It was the most marvellous feeling in the world to just lie with Harry on his hammock, doing nothing all afternoon, or to sit tangled in the couch while binge watching
“She’s one of my favourites,” Potter said when they got back to the car. Draco had to refresh his cooling charms on the way there, though the sun was setting and a cooler breeze weaved between them. “Terrible at flying, but her magic is… beautiful, raw.”
“You see,” he started, putting the watch back. “My escort was supposed to be here three hours ago. I'm not that exigent—” he said, and his lips didn’t even twitch with the lie. He continued, in a modulated tone, “But I don't think I can possibly make my way to Castelobruxo by myself. I truly hope they didn't just forget me here. They’ve known I was coming for weeks now. It makes me wonder about the school's procedures and organisation. Besides, I can’t even speak Spanish.”
He shouted Harry’s name; tried to leave the protection of the weak shield with no regard for his own safety. He didn’t care about himself. Draco had to get to Harry.
“It’s okay, don’t worry.” Draco shook away the thoughts from his head, trying to concentrate on something else. “What is this song about?”
Berê was Berenice Albuquerque, the Headteacher of Castelobruxo and the person Draco had been communicating with regarding his exchange for the last few months. It was a mystery to Draco how Potter knew she was waiting for them, but he didn’t dwell on it. After everything he had seen, Draco was all too eager to do the damn ritual as soon as possible, start his research, and explore the school grounds.
“This is not funny. I don’t know why you are so happy. Honestly.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t have the slightest chance of getting accepted by the school or finishing my research. The creatures were mellowing to me, but now…” He huffed, dropping both hands on his lap, a heavy sigh escaping his thin lips. “The Headteacher wants me gone.
“It’s perfect, thank you. And nice to meet you.” Draco said, politely enough to offer a hand. The girl—he assumed she was at least seventeen—shook his hand so vigorously he considered it might fall off.
The woman raised an eyebrow, giving him a dismissive glance. “The language spoken in Brazil is Portuguese, sir.”
Draco only saw Potter again at night when he cooked Draco dinner as an apology for leaving him alone for the rest of the day. It was something called
It was also important to be as far away from Martin, and mother, and Pansy, and every other person who still despised him. Draco didn’t mention that detail.
It was not all that bad. This way, he didn’t really have to think about leaving Harry—Draco still refused to think about Harry’s proposition to stay—and the patients in London were stable and recovering slowly, albeit still amnesiac. But on the other hand, Draco felt like he was stuck in the middle of something important, and his life could not go forward until he dealt with that question. Even if it meant being away from Harry.
Tainara frowned, pulling the book back and turning the pages quickly. “I don’t know about that second one, but the other… Devil’s Eyes, you mean, like guarana?” She lifted her head and stared at him questioningly.
The only source of light was the weak sun's rays filtered by black clouds. Shapeless shadow figures roamed all around, either stalking behind voiceless students or pacing aimlessly like his memories of Dementors, as dark as one, but translucent and fuzzy. There was no fire, no light, almost no magic anymore. There wasn't even sound. Everything had been muffled by a deafening screeching coming from the castle.
Avoiding Harry at night—that were days, really—was an almost impossible task. Draco managed it by remaining in his room every evening after the incident, or just staying at school until late.
Additionally, Brazil was only halfway to the other side of the world. There really was no reason for the exaggeration.
Draco’s grin faltered as he looked from one to the other. “What? What do you mean? There’s—There’s no darkness, right? It didn’t come out?”
“They’re all here, things from the forest. They think they control everything, the beasts.” Her voice had assumed a venomous tone Draco hadn’t heard before coming from the girl. “The Headteacher is one of them, you know.”
Caipora’s fingers crushed his arm, her claws thrusting into his skin, as if she was hearing his doubtful thoughts. Draco bit back a whimper, looking down at the mauled skin. There was no visible wound or blood, but he couldn’t tear his eyes from the deadly grip.
.” Draco did really believe half of that, but his tone was loose and amused, as he sat down in front of Saci.
“Well, me and Saci were…” Draco felt his cheeks burning and shifted in place “Anyway, I just used a simple spell to open locks and it opened.”
Harry raised his head, grin as bright as the sun blinding Draco’s view, and he said, “For a very long time it is, then.”
“Meh.” Saci shrugged, sagging his shoulders, and falling so hard on one leg Draco needed a moment to realise he was just sitting and not really falling. “Ye’re just stupid human.”
The couple looked at each other, but remained silent, and so Draco went on, trying to shake off the feeling of inadequacy that had taken over him. “You know, Machado was the true hero of the night.” He grinned, ruffling the bird’s feathers, his claws perched on Draco’s shoulder. Machado made a low humming sound, raking his head against Draco’s chin.
“You’re never leaving, are you?” The question was out of Draco’s parted lips before he could contain it.
The sodding git had disappeared from Draco’s life, and wizarding London, years ago. And Draco had made the best effort not to track him down. He didn’t care where Harry was or what he was doing, or the fact that
“I just needed him to be open to the darkness, and your presence made it possible. Harry had told me
“I don’t feel well,” the words tipped out of his lips, rememberals of a language he didn’t really realise he spoke, even if he’d done that for his entire life.
“Yes, exactly! It’s a bit more complex than Apparition, but I can teach you. Apart from boats, flying brooms, cars—my car, actually—and Tree Com, this is one of the few ways to travel and communicate inside the grounds of Homunin.”
