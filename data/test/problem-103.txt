There's a surge and a brief flash of light that instantly dies down. I can't believe it. It hasn't happened for ages. I haven't failed my Patronus for over half a year.  My heart leaps in a panic. No, no, it can't be.
I sit, staring dumbly into space, I don't know for how long. This is happening again, and now I'm going to end up in Azkaban for the thing I hadn't committed; for the thing that had been done to
"No." Tears prickle my throat, I avert my eyes. "No. I want to keep it..."
"I think we should go," Potter says.
We Apparate to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore stumbles forward. He would have fallen if I didn't catch him by the arm.
"I said,
"I thought the same about you and Parkinson. Although you two behave like utter weirdos... You suit each other."
"I swear..." Granger weeps, and my eyes fill with tears.
"Throw them into the cellar!" She shouts. "Leave the girl. We'll have a little chat."
I'm in the forest, the sky above is blue, screams,
A flash of smile, perfect teeth, his fingers on the stem.
There is shuffling of feet against the floor, the scrape of the heavy door on its hinges, urgent footsteps scattering over the staircase, dying down in the distance, until the door slams shut, its echo fading into a ringing silence, leaving me alone in the small stone room at the top of the tower. Me and dead Malfoy.
- happened to be its Master without knowing it, until Harry disarmed me and the wand's allegiance...
I see Dumbledore silently killing the boy in a green flash of light.
"No, he doesn't," Potter says, "but if we go and tell him, he will help."
the letter he'd received a week ago from Narcissa Malfoy had read.
Glaring at the damned creature, I approach the fireplace.
"Once, I was walking over the grounds and saw the two of you by the Lake. You were teaching him to cast a Patronus. When he finally did it, it was a Stag, Harry."
"Vernon Dudley," I reply.
"We love you, Henry!" You repeat dutifully, along with everyone else.
he is allowing me.
I come close to trace my fingers up his right forearm, and the other - the one he holds stiffly, not trying to hide it though.
will be his way of pronouncing your name. His clear blue eyes will meet mine, that warm smile I'm so fond of lurking in the corners. "I've been told." His hand will swipe a strand of hair off my brow.
I roll over on top of him, pressing him into the sofa while my hand rummages over the carpet.
. You don't own me," you repeated, trying to step around, but I grabbed your shoulder.
More.
Swearing, I hurled the newspaper into the fireplace.
.. you don't have to... or anything..."
"Is she your girlfriend?" I have to ask, I understand nothing anymore.
What if I'm mistaken, and Noir has nothing to do with Zabini?
Oddly light-headed, you took a step back and turned around, quickly heading to the door before Ron could say anything.
I turn around and run for my life, cutting into the crowd between Weasley and weeping Granger. Weasley's sister gives me a solemn nod, and I nod back.
I obey. There's a faint pop of a stopper.
"And there were no particular reason, no business to seek you out," he continues, looking at the river, "but then I thought... maybe it's okay - to call without any reason? To come and see you, just because I wanted to - maybe it would be just fine?"
"Planned to pass your precious NEWTs at my expense?" I spit. "Find someone else." I stand up. "Some other
I know he hates being excluded, hates that we never tell him anything of our plans. But it's the way things are, I cannot help it.
Zabini bellows, hovering near the Gryffindor hoops.
"What do you think?" Ron whispered out of the corner of his mouth.
"I promised to help you with your project. It was your idea." This is getting out of hand. Why the hell would he bring it up now, when everything was okay, when it was perfect? "You care about this assignment way too much."
"Yeah?" Looking up at me, he raises his eyebrows. He has very intense, expressive eyes. He is adorable.
"You're right, I'm good at them."
With my help he slowly gets on his feet.
I nod. It strikes me that Potter is not familiar with most Wizarding traditions.
With his hands tied, I feel suddenly bolder, suddenly reckless, suddenly free.
I feel Malfoy's presence, but can't bring myself to look at him. Seems like he's as pissed as I am; there's no other explanation for
me in the eyes and see that I'm not lying.
"Malfoy, do tell us about the Deathly Hallows," Granger says, "it's not like we have any better ideas of what to do."
I don't know what I'm doing, but when my wand –
“No.”
Harry launches forward and grabs my arm, shoving me behind his back.
"So I've heard you broke up with your girlfriend?"
I shift to the side for a better view and...
My words. I am the one to own them.
"Where's the trick?" Bella's eyes narrow as she fiddles with her wand.
He exhales. Barely. And finally opens his eyes. His gaze is cautious and waiting and patient. And...
I hug her and stroke her hair and tuck her head under my chin.
There are footsteps, soft on the carpet, and a smell of his perfume as he approaches.
"The bezoar and... I was in a haze, can't tell the details. He did something to the wound and sucked the venom out, and healed it afterwards."
I look away, I look at the faces, so many faces, all of them
“Look, Potter--”
He threw his head back, and his breath hitched - in pain or pleasure, I couldn't be sure. No, in pain.
You raise your glass and drink. To the newlyweds.
He turns. I throw my wand at him, and he catches it with a deft movement; my heart sings. I look around, right into the Dark Lord's bewildered noseless face, and there behind him is my Mother, insane with terror. Sorry, Mum, but I have to look out for him.
My heart thudding, I sit up. "Draco?"
The locket rests against my chest and
He rolls his eyes. "Come on, move."
"You're cold."
I spring to my feet.
He doesn't say:
"So I haven't, why?"
"Sit down," he says. His hand finds mine.
"On what?"
Moonlight makes his face look a pale-grey mask, old and weathered,
"And now?" Silently, he moves out of my reach, retreating back and to the left.
"It's not a perfume," he says. "Not as such. It's a potion."
There's the Quidditch match tomorrow. The last one of this term before Christmas. Gryffindor-Slytherin.
Heading to the kitchen, you take a bottle of white wine out of the fridge and pour two glasses. Carrying them, you head to the hall and up the staircase, up and up, music growing louder the higher you climb.
"You can see us! You can see." Hermione says through tears.
We grin at each other and exchange glances, and when Weasley adds: "The thief and the cook to the rescue!" - the four of us burst out laughing and can't calm down for a long time.
I'm standing right beside his bed; he is looking up at me in the dark.
"Ron!" Harry shouts, and Weasley, with his face twisted, jerks Granger out of the line of the falling chandelier.
I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Snape managed to fool Dumbledore.
just steal food."
Squeezing your eyes shut against his image, you stumbled out of the bedroom. You dumped everything over the bannisters, down into the hall by the staircase and refused to cry. Tears choked you, swelling up against your will. You refused to let them fall, striding angrily back, picking up the defeated brogues and Chelsea boots, one of them still lay mocking you across the room. Snatching it up, you dashed back, throwing everything down from the landing.
I will approach the piano again, the image of your fingers before my eyes - strong and delicate - their caress evoking languid sounds from the ancient instrument. The image of your tranquil face, your closed eyes and a ghost of a smile blossoming on your lips will forever stay in my memory.
He nods and steps into the Floo.
you to kiss
I think of Potter and Dumbledore, of Snape and my Father, of what's happening out there while I rot in this place - I have no clue.
The moment was broken, washing the tension away. Some people followed, others began to climb the stairs. Ron turned away, walking to the armchairs where people were gathering on the floor. No one approached us.
wrenching until it hurts, until it cuts into my neck, until something
I won't let him set this trap for me now.
I don't worry. He's the only person with whom I don't.
The information board in our Common Room never catches my attention. Why would it? Especially when I'm dashing down the stairs, almost being late for breakfast.
"Because no one gives a fuck that he's missing! As soon as they heard that he was kidnapped by his own father, they laughed in my face. Do you think I haven't tried to alert the Aurors?"
My pulse thrumming in my fingertips, I feel strangely elevated. I want Malfoy to drop his dignified pretence and be ugly. I want him to come back at me as only he knows how, to retaliate, say shitty things, and maybe I'd even like to punch him. Like the good old times.
he said, closing the bracelet with a flick of his wand,
In the light of day
"No," he replies. "You've asked your question."
I realise there's no plan, Potter acted on impulse, all this was only his stupid idea, and Dumbledore is none the wiser.
The knowledge tastes foul anyway.
"How can I help you?"
Malfoy's eyes are grey
Yesterday at Potions, he even moved his things to my table, when we were asked to gather in groups. I realised I didn't mind and spent half the time distracted by his presence next to me.
I don’t want to stop, I don’t want to wait. Right now, I can’t think at all, and blood is pounding in my temples. The only thing I want - is to
Slowly, oh-so-slowly, gingerly I moved and moved and moved, on and on, until his body clenched as he cried out and came. I watched white strips covering his stomach in bouts until his hand stilled and he went boneless. Carefully, I pulled out. He curled on his side and looked at me.
I had been busy figuring out some stuff in Robards' office and almost forgot about her invitation.
if he knows perfectly well why I am here, and whom I am waiting for?!
I am about to say thank you, but a sudden touch of his hand at my back renders me unable to utter a word. It is heavy and warm; it slides up to wrap around my shoulder, his thumb stroking my collarbone.
I turn the switch further.
"When I put my eyes on you, I fell in love with you," he replies, his eyes dancing with mirth.
I bolt out.
"How?"
"Thank you, Kreacher."
"I never liked you, you know," he continues, which makes me laugh.
There's Astoria now. They are friends, he said.
"You must really like it," I say, "to add it everywhere."
She puts a wand on the table. I recognise it, it’s her old wand that I’d been using after the war before purchasing a new one after my house arrest.
I said first thing this morning, watching as he limped back into the cave after he'd pissed outside.
"Well, well... not as unbreakable as it seems.” I smile. “I am most pleased."
There's something… I squint and step forward - my reflection moves towards me. Tongues of fire are sprouting from my bare chest, fraying the white edges of my open shirt into smouldering brown.
We are passing Madame Malkin's as a flash of light hits me in the face, then another one.
, broken pieces of glass in fiery liquid rain down off the mantel into the fireplace. The raging flames burst, spitting fire, snaking their bright paths over the rug. When I look up, my reflection is smiling, bending, distorting the liquid surface within its frame. Magic mirrors don’t break. They only laugh and twist and mock you.
"One night, I was sitting on watch, when a Patronus appeared. At first, I thought it was yours, Harry, you know, it looked a bit similar. But then I realised it wasn't a Stag, it lacked the antlers. So I woke Hermione up, and we followed it. It led us up to a frozen pond and disappeared. And there it was: the sword at the very bottom. So we retrieved it, and here we are." He raises the sword.
He's right.
as I have thought: everyone around me is clutching at their heads, their faces insane.
A couple of weeks ago Gin sat beside me at the Quidditch stands. The day after she punched Zabini.
"Thanks." I bite into it. It tastes good, and I am starving. I’m surprised he includes me in their meal after the 'welcome' he gave me earlier.
"The Stone," Harry instantly says.
Maybe Muggles are idiots, after all; you don't know. But it's obvious to you that your condition cannot be changed. If you ever want to get out of here, you have to play the part and show them that it's working, that you're getting better, you're getting
to each other. But not like that. We both knew - not like that. In her bedroom, I lay my head on her lap, and she stroked my hair. We spent hours like that. I knew Molly urged Gin to spend more time with me, and even get back together.
“Harry?” Hermione repeats when I don’t reply immediately.
Nothing happened. He did nothing, said nothing, just stood there. There was a heavy sigh, and another, and a long silence, until I realised he didn't come to kill me. It seemed he wanted to talk. Whatever in hell could Potter and I possibly talk about? I didn’t understand until it finally dawned on me that he came to apologise. To right the wrongs and all that shit.
I shove Goyle off me, pick up my wand and dash along the aisle, but fire and smoke block my way in the middle. I turn back. The fire roars to the left and right. I dash back, only to find Crabbe and Goyle enclosed in a fiery circle. When the fire catches my hair from behind, I realise we are doomed. I scream and beat it out of my hair, dash to the pile of old furniture and begin climbing it.
He suddenly stops. "Watch the steps."
A sob escapes me, and another one, my eyes prickling hot. My face suddenly damp, I wipe at it with the back of my hand, and my palm, and my fingers, again and again. I press my fingertips into my eyelids until colourful circles bloom before my eyes: yellow and red and orange.
It pisses me off because now there's no reason to be rude and just tell them both to fuck off until they start treating me
I stare at his back. I could still probably cast a Full-Body Bind on him and keep him here.

Theo's parents had contacted Granger through his barrister, she’d told me. They'd offered an
"Malfoy..."
Unable to sleep, I toss on the sofa over and over, winding the blanket around my legs. Fuck. I sit up to disentangle myself. The faint moon throws barely a hint of light from the window. This place is dark and creepy, and most certainly cursed.
“Do come in, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall says into silence. “Please, take a seat, the class has already begun.” There’s a steeliness in her voice that wasn’t there a moment ago.
"Merlin's tits, Malfoy! I thought it was a question of life or death," I reply as he steers me to the right, in the direction of the Gryffindor table. "No problem, just pick me up after dinner. And we'll discuss your stupid project."
You shoved it away and got on your feet. "What
She jumps away from me, shaking her head, and dashes to the door.
If it weren't for the potion, I'd feel the urge to throw something, to break and shatter things against the wall, to wallow in my rage and the satisfying sounds of glass smashing. It's still there, but very vague and dull - a ghost of a feeling - only a reminder of what things would have been, of what I could have been if I were still me.
Mother's face, her last words when they led her in.
It is everything.
There, under the perfume - is only him. I want to wrap myself in it, to crawl underneath the delicate fragrance and discover
"Me too."
"Malfoy… what are you doing here?" I'm suddenly weak in the knees.
A few times a week after classes, he stays in the Potions classroom to brew for St. Mungo's. Sometimes, I even stay with him. He doesn't seem to mind.
"Malfoy..."
When firm gentle hands cup my face, when a breath ghosts over my lips, when stubble brushes my jaw, when there's finally a feather-light touch of lips on mine - I freeze. My hands hanging loose, I even forget to close my eyes, I barely have a moment to realise in a shock what's happening, before he withdraws, his palms are gone, his perfume lingers, reluctant to follow his footsteps away from me.
“A wireless,” he says.
"You are." He shrugged.
I would cover my face if my hands weren't tied behind my back.
"Show off," you repeated when my wordless spell made my fingers drip with lube.
A sweet sprinkle of the tiniest droplets reaches me, and I lick their bright fragrance off my lips.
"Are you asleep?" He asks.
give a fuck?"
We flew over the country roads, over the villages scattered in the valley, on and on, until I recognised the outline of night London ahead.
"Legere Digitus Intelligo," I repeated. Nothing happened.
"Tell me, girl." She stands over her. "Where did you get the sword? Tell me the truth."
"The light. It's morning, and I see it."
He squeezes my hand.
My heart is racing; it is dark in the room. I am terrified to move in my bed. Because I know
I flinch and snatch my hand away.
I grip his wrist, he cringes.
"You are not my
"Where are we going?" I whisper, following him down the stairs. Better do as he says.
"Harry, look, you need to finish your education."
I miss him badly. I cannot help it.
"You shouldn't offend the house, Potter." I glare at him. "No wonder you say it doesn't like you."
"House like," Kreacher confirms. He is dressed in a new starched white linen napkin, and even his ears look starched. "Masters is welcome to dining room."
"We broke up."
He is above me, the cords in his neck straining as he
My eyes are travelling down Malfoy's lean frame, lingering on the black leather belt circling his waist…
So what, if sometimes my heart would squeeze at the sight of his face from a certain angle? So what, if after seeing you in the papers I still couldn't gather myself back? So what if I still avoided Quidditch matches because you would be there? So what, if lied to him that nothing was wrong after seeing a glimpse of you in the Ministry? So what, if asleep in the wake of the night, with his quiet breathing and ruffled hair, he looked just like you?
Memories don't ask my permission.
"No."
You shrugged and looked down at me… the brooding longing in my veins turned into joy. If you wanted to leave, you would have already done so.
"Do you?"
"Spin the bottle. Wanna join?" Parkinson sing-songs. "Boys are having fun."
"I understand, you may not get it - that's why you broke up, after all, I suppose - but she's smoking hot, she's cool, I like her a lot, if you know what I mean." He wiggles his eyebrows. "Though, apparently, you don't."
I mean... I certainly found him rather hot and even secretly indulged in ogling his body. But what is happening now - is another level. Afraid of being too obvious, I often avoid looking at him too much, lest he'd notice me admiring him.  And now he might, nothing prevents him. But he never asks anything. Apart from his words about Zabini in the hospital, he hasn't referred to the gay-thing even once.
Harry stirs beside me. I shake him by the shoulder.
"Good bye, and... thank you, Potter. For everything."
Approaching Grimmauld Place slowly, I cannot see Number 12 from the street. It's concealed from prying eyes with a Fidelius Charm and other heavy warding spells for good measure. He'd cast them himself, and they are holding better than the Ministry wards, Potter had told me this morning, handing me a piece of paper.
"Who is that?" Someone says next to me. "Hagrid's carrying... Neville, who is it?"[17] Ginny Weasley pushes her way forward.
"Yeah… it's weird, but I like it."
He hasn't changed in the face, only his eyes are wide, and a red spot is blooming bright on his cheekbone.
So I gave the sum to Kreacher. "You buy groceries anyway."
"Yes," I reply, "last night."
Idiots, why would someone even do such a thing in a place like this? No doubt their parents will shut them here for good. The memory of the Bible falling down across Paul's head makes you wince and squeeze your eyes shut.
Malfoy stands up, too.
I always did as he told me, always trusted him without question.
I think he's changed, or maybe he'd never been
"If you meet Potter, call me!" I shout in their wake.
Mother takes me by the arm. "I am so happy to finally have you here, Draco."
"Holy shit," he says, "it's Malfoy. It's Lucius Malfoy's brat." He grabs my throat. "You are
He turns on his side to face me, lifting his head, so that I can retrieve my arm.

"You know what I mean," he whispered, "not that I care, but keep doing that and you risk turning into a vegetable, mind that you're already halfway to that state."
and hold onto him for dear life.
"But a
You knew. He was planning to propose on her birthday.
His leather wristwatch box, the pair of cufflinks, the hard leather belt—everything bounced off the floorboards and joined the pile of clothes as you viciously threw the items down, one by one.
"Kreacher bring dinner. Kreacher made French onion soup."
Reaching to the very bottom of the deepest depth, I retrieve the memory... the
“Yes.”
"Nothing."
I turn.
“Fuck, sorry! I didn’t see--”
"He has disowned me," I say dumbly, words alien in my mouth, "my Father." I look up at Potter. "I am no longer his son. That's why you aren't able to address me by that name. I'm no longer Malfoy."
[8] – announcement on the radio, from “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” by J.K. Rowling.
We are sitting in the Slytherin stands. I don’t know why I let Malfoy drag me here. That’s just what I do these days. I go where he goes. I’ve got used to him -
rose on the threshold and Mrs. Black's portrait started to shriek, but then all the noise abruptly died down. I instantly knew it wasn't Potter. Whoever it was, they must not see me. In a panic, I sprang on my feet, not knowing where to hide. The footsteps were approaching, and the living room door stood open, offering me on display. But then Kreacher was there; he waved his hand, covering us both with a Disillusionment Charm. My heart in my throat, I stood there, watching as Snape emerged and headed briskly up the main staircase. He came back in some fifteen minutes and left the house the same way he arrived.
"What do you care?" I sprang to my feet and just walked out.
- clatters against the floor.
"Why do you think so?"
"Did you... is it yours?" He asks, tracing the drawing of the rooftop garden with his fingers.
"Harry." Seamus nudges me. "Come on!"
I push, and his breath catches. His fingers dig into my arm. I prop myself on my elbows above him.
"What should I do?
I dream of Noir and the kiss, about kissing Noir who is Malfoy who is Noir. Standing in the circle, just how we were doing it - and the next moment we're lying in bed, and I'm pinning him to the mattress. His mouth is greedy, and I see at the same time how he's kissing me: I'm in Parkinson's place, and people are cheering.
"I..." He shrugs. "I don't know, okay? When I set out to search for you, I thought... Well, I didn't think anything. But I saw you there, saw all that crazy shit going on... I couldn't fucking
In vain he frets; he can't wake me. I'm not asleep to begin with. I'm not going to open my eyes either. I want him to leave, and now he's going to, as he always does. I know it's not his first visit here. It's not even the second. It's the fourth.
Malfoy shrugs. I look at his forearm, now mended, at the Mark that snakes down, not quite reaching his wrist. He probably catches me staring, because he grabs his sweater from the bedside table and covers his upper body, tucking his arms underneath.
"I'm not blind." I shrug. "Or deaf, or stupid. I notice things." Not looking at him, I fiddle with my wand. "You’re going to leave me behind."
"Expecto Patronum!"
“Yeah, I like it here,” I reply, rummaging over the desk surface until my hand touches the cauldron in the centre. “I’m not going to brew anyway, I’ll just sit here and listen. I don’t want to get in the way--”
"Dragons, yes…" he replies oddly. "Looks like this one doesn't want to."
Ron and Hermione break apart, breathing heavily, turning to look at the remaining couple. Malfoy and Parkinson, intertwined in the middle, are acting as though they are committed to sucking each other’s brains out.
"Where?" Malfoy asks. He picks at the grass between the tiles and throws it in front of him on the steps.
He turns to leave, but I grab his arm. "No!... I mean... look..."
Pulling me along, he doesn’t reply, and I’m relieved that he dropped the subject. We enter the showers.
I reach into my satchel and retrieve the box. By the look on Malfoy's face, he recognises it, he knows perfectly well what it is.
"You can brew a Calming Draught?" I ask carefully.
He tells them everything from the night in the hospital he came to apologise. I watch Granger's and Weasel's faces rather than listen... until he comes to the part of his conversation with Dumbledore after I left.
The sudden thought scares me.
Our fight with Ron, the cave,
... that leads to another thing - the one I have yet to deal with. And I don't know what's wrong with me, but apparently something is, if the thought of it makes me ill.
His touch is warm and safe and so...
"Who?" I ask, distracted, because Malfoy appears in the doorway with Parkinson on his arm.
"Hanging my clothes," he replies. "And yours, too."
My face is burning; what the fuck was
"What a heavenly way to die."
The elf had said nothing, but accepted.
making it burst into hundred fiery sparks.
. You sniffed and exhaled and shook your head, surveying the disarray.
We laugh and shake them out of our hair, and suddenly Malfoy reaches under my collar to retrieve some. Hot all over, I mumble
"I just don't want to," I say pettily.
No. No, this can’t be. But the
"Be quiet, Ron," Hermione hisses irritably.
It's Saturday morning, yes, but I've totally forgotten. Or rather thought he wouldn't come.
"Shut the fuck up!" She says angrily when I almost reached the door. Not sure whom she's addressing.
knows this about you, Potter. Please." She winced. "You can tell
"Bye." I Apparated from the porch.
His bathrobe is parted, revealing his navel and the dark trail of hair, going down.
She stares at me.
Next morning at breakfast I try to think about anything but our meeting with Father and what time is it.
"So I assume
He summons the tent out of Granger's beaded bag and sets to unfolding it.
I knew - we both knew - Gin would never do that to me, would never stay with me out of pity. I loved her so much for that. And for other things, too. But not like that.
"Well, you behave like you know her very well. Astoria this, Astoria that! What does she look like?" He mimics my voice. "You talk about her all the time!"
A limp hand is hanging down... an arm in the stained grey sleeve - probably blood or dirt, or... My eyes follow the line of the sleeve up, up to where it joins the rest of... a grey hoodie? Yes, hoodie - I see the hood over Hagrid's arm, and on top of it... black strands of his unruly hair, he is still wearing my hairband... his glasses are askew, and the crane of his neck is not good... I shake my head. Not good. His eyes are closed - he is asleep,
His face uncertain, he nods awkwardly and shrugs, as though saying:
"I don't know, maybe you're right." I don't know why, but I suddenly have a bad feeling. "But wouldn't it be too dangerous? If we are seen, if
I thought,
I think.
"We should ransom him," someone says behind me. "The Malfoys will pay good money."
Zabini laughs, flashing his impossibly perfect white teeth.
When he comes close, I wrap my arms around him and squeeze, steadying my swimming head.
I'm an idiot. An utter idiot to even
"Do me a favour."
After the war, during those two years of your house arrest, you’d got interested in art. You’d begun reading books for nothing better to do, and soon discovered that architecture and sculpture drew you the most. So, once you were free to leave the Manor, the first thing you did was visit the National Gallery. There you bumped into Theo, who was no less fascinated than you.
Why is he telling me this?
"Maybe? I don't know."
All this flashes wild through my mind as I'm approaching Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table.
speaks to me. A voice whispers inside my head.
. It's just skin.
He looks up.
My whole body trembles faintly from standing upright for so long, or maybe it's out of fear of the Dark Lord, or perhaps because I haven't eaten all day... and Harry –
"It's weird," Granger says, "this sign here." She points at the book in front of her. "It's not a rune, it doesn't belong."
"You are," he whispers. "It doesn’t matter what I think, but yes, I think you are."
"Me? Why
Weasley stepped around her to stare at Potter. "You don't know why I listen to the radio every night, do you? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum-"
We couldn't eat it alive."
No, no, it
"I don't know, the coin-" I open my palm.
I am afraid, I’m not able to.
Zabini says, and above him I see Hermione covers her face.
We curl into each other in my bed, sleeping through the lunchtime.
He'll leave me now.
I’m not going to explain.
I realise I'm afraid of
"Hold on! Patronus Essentia Liquidus!"
With a quiet sob and a sigh, Malfoy turns on his side to face me. "Thank you."
away from you."
"At least you can stand, which means your spine is not broken." I put his arm over my shoulder. "Lean on me."
He looks down at her, long and hard, and finally pulls her close. "It's okay." He kisses her temple. With a sigh, she leans into him.
I look down at the drawing board on my lap. The charcoal sketch of the Tower Bridge is almost finished.
"You've done great, Hermione." Potter hugs her.
The hero who conquered the Dark Lord
"I promise."
I despair.
hissing sound he suddenly makes sends chills through my bones. Silence falls, only disturbed by a faint mechanical ticking coming from the locket.
They may have moved from the front of my mind to the back, but some barriers cannot be crossed or dismissed.
"I hope it has made a difference, sir," I say, my face burning. "He didn't accept my apologies, but he accepted help, in the end."

He nods.
Across the Ministry canteen?
"Why?"
"Okay," he says warily, gingerly sitting down at the foot of the bed, his silhouette outlined against the greying window.
For a moment, my heart sings, only to crash heavily on the ground. I remember the game of truth and dare. "So it's not Astoria… the… someone you're in love with."
"I think..." He shrugs, and there's this dreamy note about his voice. Terror grips me. "Maybe in the pouch...
"I know, boy," he snaps, "I was thinking aloud." He waves his hand at me. "You are dismissed."
go, and there's nothing I can do to make him.
I sensed disaster.
"You know what, Harry?" He is fumbling with his clothes.
I stare at her, chill spreading through me at the thought of what she is implying.
Moral Inventory means a list of your sins, that you have to write down after searching deep in your heart. Your homosexual sins. You must read them aloud in front of the therapy group. And now it's Henry's turn.
Immediately my mind strays to all the black guys in the Eighth Year. Which are only two: Dean Thomas and...
"I really think you should cut your hair." I look at his face, and look and look, and can't get enough.
No. Two months precisely. Yes. It was the 2nd of August yesterday. I testified for the Malfoys on the 2nd of June. Malfoy's shocked face in the Wizengamot courtroom after my testimony was one of the last things I've ever seen.
"We must-"
"Goodbye, Annabel!" Draco tugs at my hand.
I turn on my way up the staircase.
" He throws the door wide with a bow.
"To let Death Eaters into Hogwarts."
"Thanks," I mumble, not looking at him. I sit down again and take the mug.
"It was in the papers--"
The whistle blows. I imagine Ron in the air, taking his position by the hoops. His Gryffindor Quidditch gear, determination on his face. Bitterness is always there - right next to self-pity in my jealous heart. I should have been there with Ron. I didn’t particularly want to come.
Harry dives again, his hand outstretched. Crabbe launches forward in his attempt to reach Harry and shoves me aside so that I stumble and almost fall. Crabbe tries again and falls face forward right into the raging flames. In horror, I stare as his form melts and dissolves as though in molten lava.
“Maybe in this, you weren't wrong.” I put my arms through the sleeves and spread the soft fabric down my front and sides.
"Goyle!" I shout, and he turns, right at the moment when Harry opens the door to the Room of Requirement.
Gin stirs next to me.
So many things we talked about, so much is still left unsaid.
There's a click of the door closing, and I with a growl I fall back on the pillow. "Fucker."
"Okay."
“I think I could use a nap.” He yawns, rinsing shampoo out of his hair. We've finally got to wash.
in their bedroom.
"Not you too, Hermione, spare me." I wriggle my hand. "Ron, would you
"What
"I'm crushing you," I mumble into his shoulder.
“Astoria? Why?”
I look around and catch a glimpse of Potter, lurking in the doorway.
I don't dare.
"No, I mean... it's
His face set, he limps slowly, favouring his right side, wincing each time his right foot touches the floor.
"Bye." She already unlocks the door, slamming it in her wake.
"Touch all you want." He pulls me into a kiss.
"Leave him
"Yes." I remove my bag from the seat next to me.
No. Potter.
"No." Reluctantly, I drop his hand. "I can't see anything, really, just the outline of your silhouette. I can't tell the colour of your jumper."
"Fuck off," I reply, not looking back at them on my way down the stairs.
I lean in - a tiny movement, just a fraction, because he’s very close - and finally kiss him. With a sigh, he responds - barely there, as though he’s afraid to breathe.
do you think you're doing?" I spit the words in his face. "I'll fucking kill you."
My face turned upwards, I stare at the silver spark with my blind eyes.
He is nodding, his eyes are wide.
My stomach rumbles. "We should find food."
"But Snape..." Aunt Bella's face twists.
Chapter 2
"Harry?" Ron jabs me in the ribs.
Dashing to the library, I frantically leaf through a huge French thesaurus. Strange, alien words jump on the pages, blurring before my eyes. At first I even skip it in my haste, turning the next page. Finally, here it is:
"Out of the way, Malfoy!" McGonagall shoves me aside and I hit the wall as she attacks a tall masked Death Eater twice her size.
That means I have to keep an eye on Malfoy from now on, lest he gets harmed in my absence. I feel ill, and my face probably betrays me, because Dumbledore sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose with his good hand.
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy does. But he doesn't simply fucking open it, as in opening just to
"Let's go?" I reach for his arm.
"The what?"
I shrugged and nodded, still determined not to acknowledge butterflies in my stomach as I watched your profile in the mellow light of the candles hovering in the air over the terrace. "I don't like these events. Everyone is so stuck-up."
"What do you mean?" I was suddenly shy again.
The backpack flies out of the cave and slands at his feet. Harry unzips it and reaches inside, retrieving the locket by its chain. He holds it at arm's length, disgust written across his face. Since the night I tried it on like an idiot, neither of us have touched it.
"What?"
He didn’t approach me here, as I didn’t think he would, and now I have no clue how to find him among this mayhem. I would like to find him, to say hey and offer him a drink. Why not? I’m sure he wouldn’t refuse Firewhisky…
"Master don't see, " he repeated. "It is morning but Master think it is night, his eyes don't see. Master hurt his feet."
"It’s better if you don’t," I agree. "Trust me."
Granger and I draw our wands behind Harry's back.
"Hermione..." I take a deep breath. "I'm... "
"Hi." He doesn't turn from the cauldron. "Forty-two seconds and I'm done."
You remember reading your own Moral Inventory to the group for the first time, more than two months ago. You’d begun exactly like Henry.
"Mr. Potter! What is your involvement in Draco Black's case?! Mr. Potter! One word please! Mr. Black! Turn to the camera!"
"You are bleeding, Harry." Ginny peers in my face, too close. "Let me..." Wet cloth touches my forehead, slides down my temple, wipes under my jaw.
His offer, his words make my heart squeeze, make me ache with a thrill of anticipation and bitterness for something I’ll never have, something that is forever lost for me, something that… I would give anything to have it back.
I should be still mad at him, and I surely still am, but the thought of him caring enough to come to me first… It's not even Potions where we're paired up. It's Charms. He doesn't
In a panic, I rush forward and stumble over the steps, falling face forward into the grass with my wand in my outstretched hand. Something stings my chest through the front pocket of my shirt. I reach into the pocket and retrieve a golden galleon. The coin is very hot, it stings, it burns my fingers, and I almost drop it... but the next moment darkness swirls me away.
When you reach the door, a shout makes you turn. In the circle, Henry shoves Tom away from Christopher's hunched form. It’s an unexpectedly powerful movement for such a small man. Mr. Vice is shouting, ordering Henry to step back.
I stare at her. This is something surreal, something that never happens to
I nod. I know.
"No." My face is burning. "No, I..." I look away. I didn't know it would be so hard to meet his eyes.
He will strike that insane bitch Bellatrix, and the Werewolf, and all the Death Eater scum that have wormed their way into Hogwarts. He will defend Dumbledore, he will save him and call for help and...
Ron's frame still concealed the man's face from view, but you didn't need to look.
"You're enough the way you are," he continues, his voice distant. "But for you it's not enough, it makes all the difference to
I stare at his jaw working, at their locked lips, at her fingers leaving red prints on the side of his neck.
"I wanted to,” he says, “but..."
"Harry!"
"Oh, not
you've been up to?"
It went better than I expected. I cast Muffliato on the barking dog that sensed my presence and managed to get into the hen house. Now, carrying about a dozen stolen eggs in my jumper and a chicken tucked under my armpit, I approach our camp, or rather the spot where I know it should be because a protective sphere conceals it from the eyes of an outsider. With a jolt, I realise that they could have moved in my absence, leaving me behind, and nothing would stop them.
She squeezed my hand.
"But what? I bet you took it as his crazy rumblings." I roll my eyes.
The sound of a bottle spinning against the hard wooden floorboards goes on and on and seems like it’s never going to stop. I take a sip from my glass. Twice.
It feels like he knows
he says gently, and I watch in horror as bloody gashes open in my chest.
"You'll be the death of me, Potter." He planted a kiss on your open throat. "All I could think of at work was you."
"Harry?" Granger breaks the silence. "What the Horcrux said..."
Malfoy with his back to me throws a broomstick on the floor, retrieving another one.
I think but hold my tongue.
"It's here." He shows us the Snitch. "The Stone. Now I’m sure it's here. Dumbledore hid it inside; why else would he leave me the fucking
I jerk and look around. There's no one, but...
"Do whatever you want." He turns his head to the side. "Anything. You don't have to ask."
"We don't have time, Harry. Quickly, I need your Cloak."
There's laughter, whistles and cheering from the entrance.
I'm...
Bewildered, I get to my feet, slowly heading back in the centre where Romilda is waiting for me.
"Leave!" you bark.
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" I suddenly realise I'm hard, and he no doubt sees my morning wood obscenely tenting my pants forward.
"Everyone knows you've fancied him since forever."
I press my nose to his. "You don't have to. Unless you want to."
You wouldn't be alone, you--"
"Oh, let's go then, I’m starving!" He pulls me along, and I follow him out of the lab, down the corridor and past the lady behind the counter.
The corridor is black.
"Pass me the Asphodel powder." He held out his hand, looking down in the cauldron.
As soon as we emerged from the Leaky and stepped on the Diagon Alley, the staring began. I hadn't thought of it before... but come on... it's Potter and I, walking side by side together. What did I expect?
"Malfoy's right," Weasley joins, in spite of the
I hear the word, but I don't understand what he means. It doesn't make any sense.
"Are you going to Herbology?"
"Let me." I propped myself on my elbow. I took his cock and began to stroke it, and in no time it was stiff again. Astonished, I felt myself harden inside him. Carefully, I moved my hips. Slowly, as slow as I could. "May I?"
I thought. They were talking puzzles again. Not that I cared, really.
it said.
Flitwick is saying something, but my head is buzzing, and I can't focus on his words. Probably it was a stupid idea, most certainly it won't work; I gave it a try anyway.
Weasley protested when Potter gave me the Cloak. Potter said, in that case, he could go on his own. Granger said that no way Potter was going. Potter offered her to take the Cloak and go by herself. She said she was uncomfortable with stealing food. Weasley wouldn't go because of his wound. So it came to me again.
The room tilts before me as I get to unsteady feet. As I approach, your face smiles at me from the mantelpiece, frozen in a moment from several years ago. The
I press my palms into my ears, but the voice rings in my head.
“Good.”
"Are they real?" Harry asks at the same time as Granger says: "It's only a legend."
After the shower, I went to bed and tossed and turned for a long time. When I'd finally begun to doze off, the door opened quietly, letting in a thin trail of light from the corridor.
"Merlin," says Ron, "Merlin's tits!"
After dark, we creep down into the valley where several farmhouses are scattered between the low hills. The dogs sense our approach. They bark and snarl, and no doubt have awakened the entire household. There's very little room under the Cloak for the two of us. We slip into the hen house, but there are no eggs. As soon as we emerge outside, door slams and a man walks past. We still. He's gone to see to the dogs, and we hurry across the yard.
Carefully, my hand reaches to the bedside table, immediately finding the vial. Kreacher always places it just right, so that I won't knock it over. Pulling the stopper out with a soft pop, I bring the vial to my mouth and drink. I only have a few spare seconds to put it back on the bedside table, drop my head on the pillow and pull the blanket up to my ears before the Dreamless Sleep grips me.
"There's this
He squeezes my cock in his hand, giving it a sure stroke.
The sound of running water. Silence. The light switches off. The door opens.
In my Muggle suit, I stand out here. Pretty much everyone is in robes, except for Potter in his Auror uniform jacket and trousers.
I turn.
"I took your Map."
"I'm dizzy," she breathes out as I lower her down on her feet.
I bolt upright.
you think. For the past two weeks, the reports had been quite satisfactory -
“Just… I don’t know, it’s sort of stupid if you think about it,” he replies. “Isn’t it? My name and all, you know… Cliché. Almost like a peacock.”
I grab Harry's hand, but he lets go and springs on his feet, dashing outside.
The sky is fake, there's no 'outside' behind the window. The window is fake, it's not a window. It's the Room playing tricks with me, so that I’ll find my prison pleasant. And pleasant it is.
"You don't like to read?" You asked me.
So I do. Everything.
"I'm telling you, he's been kidnapped. He's been missing for
I've fallen in love with someone, whom I've never even seen; someone who, having found out who I am, doesn't want anything to do with me.
A swipe of my hand sends them all flying; all of them, frames shattering against the floor.
"I wanted to let you know, that Mother has nothing to do either with my escape, or my whereabouts."
I pull the t-shirt over my head and bend down to unlace my boots. Getting rid of them and my socks, I finally take off my jeans. Yes, jeans. I transfigured my trousers into them, after Potter's fashion. Practical.
Malfoy flinches.
She neither falters nor apologises for the 'look', and isn't it what I wanted?
With his brow furrowed, he leafs through the sheets slowly for a long time, and I hold my breath, leaning against the counter, until he looks up.
"It's the same one that you cast," Draco says.
I’m sitting in bed with Gin, naked. I tug the sheet up to my armpits. I have to say something; I don't know what to say.
I lean against the wall, staring into the shining surface of the obsidian floor under my feet.
I go to bed early. I don't want to face Potter just yet.
"Bloody hell, Harry," Weasel says.
I hug him and squeeze him until his spine cracks, until he protests in a breathless laughter.
"Since
The next turn to the left will take me right to the Common Room's hidden door. I ignore it, quickly walking past, and turn to the right instead, in the direction of the Potions classroom. There I stop and lean against the wall.
"He... brought me to a… er... sexual satisfaction... by his hand, and I... returned the favour." Henry covers his face. "We sinned at my home, when my wife was out of town."
Something lifts off my chest. Maybe, if he says so... Maybe he'll want to come and see me again sometime?
"Harry, what are you going to do, then? Shut yourself up in this house? At Hogwarts, you'd be amongst
“Graceful,” I repeat.
He doesn't say anything, I assume he's gone. Slowly, I trudge up the steps.
"Looks like she wants more than I can give, so it was kind of… unfair to lead her on."
"The Cloak of Invisibility." I enclose the line and the circle within a triangle.
face; with his bright-blond head, strands laced with gold; with his warm laughter and sure presence that never ever made me doubt where I stood.
just in case, so that the wretched creature could never tell Potter I provoked him.
attack never ceases.
We sway in place in the middle of the Entrance Hall. All I ever wanted was to see her again, and now she is here, and... Why then do I feel dead? Why do I struggle not to wail in despair now that I see her?
"Expelliarmus!" I bark, and Malfoy yelps.
"You've changed your clothes," you said dumbly, staring at the dark trail of hair that ran down from his navel to that place where his cock stood out, bobbing in front of him as he walked.
"Someone left a note that..." Hermione lowers her voice.
The room goes dark. I hear him approaching. He's barefoot, I think vaguely.
Potter snorts and draws a deep breath and exhales, long and slow. "Would you sit down? We really need to talk."
I'm not alright, and probably it shows on my face.
"Mr. Malfoy. I believe you've got lost from your fellow Slytherins." Her voice is grim. She won't let me pass, won't let me follow Harry. "Let me escort you." She gestures towards the Entrance Hall.
“Thanks.” My hand reaches up to touch the knot. “I never knew how it’s properly done, you know, even when I could see.”
I drop into the armchair, watching Malfoy sitting back on his heels on the floor. His face lowered, he blinks as though trying to ebb the tears away.
I move my hand up and down, curling my fingers, encircling him with my palm. He jerks and thrusts into my grip, digging his nails into my arse.
"For your help and hospitality... but I think I should no longer impose on it. So... I'm leaving tomorrow morning."
Bright. This house was bright with your presence. It only ever felt like home when you were here. It only took you stepping out of the fireplace, and the huge chandelier would flare to life in the living room. Its glow turning warm and welcoming, it would no longer seem tacky or ugly or too old. When you were here, the house was never gloomy, never hostile. It brimmed with life and sighed happily and stood proud.
"I am." I bent down to kiss him, open mouthed and hot. His head fell back, and he tasted of champagne.
"What's wrong?" Potter frowned up at him.
Mr. Vice says something to the staff, while Chris and Paul are standing with their heads bowed. Mr. Vice is gesticulating furiously with his hands, and two men head to the door, followed by the two staff members. You realise that the music has suddenly ceased playing.
"Hi," Malfoy says. "Are you not ready yet?"
"Well, well...look what we have here," Fenrir Greyback says, eyeing Granger.
His face.
He nods.
No, if I'm honest, I probably do. Because it's a secret - a secret from him, first of all - a revelation of that terrifying, wild, heart-stopping moment when I clung to him on the broom, his warmth, his hard body my only anchor amidst the abyss. That was what made my Patronus flare to life.
Greyback releases me and studies Harry for a long time.
The headline catches my eye. I take the Prophet from the kitchen table.
Without a word, Potter gets up and walks away.
he said.
- shut up." You gripped the headboard and rotated your pelvis. "Fucking big you are."
"Yes, the wards--"
"I'm not denying it!" Malfoy grunts. "I enjoyed it. No less than you enjoyed snogging a half of our year on Halloween!"
Granger shakes her head.
"Talk."
Dropping Draco's hand, I dash down the stairs, pushing among the people on my way.
There's a silence. Malfoy shifts beside me, and I prepare myself for his another snogging session with Astoria. Maggie knows what she's doing, damn her.
Weasley clears his throat and turns to Granger.
"Come on, Harry, time to catch up with your homework."
"Masculine sports for men are encouraged."
"Why do you ask?"
See people and places as I remember them. See my life - so bright, vivid and real - that awakening to the darkness before my eyes will feel like dying.
Now, staring at Potter, there's this weird certainty in my guts, that if he offered to make out - right here and now - I wouldn't mind at all. I have no idea where it comes from, but it feels perfectly fine and I'm sure I would like it a lot.
"Yes," I say.
"Come on!" I nudge her. "Spill it."
The entrance hall is covered in debris, stone shards everywhere, gaps in the walls where the paintings have been. There's no one here. I run outside, catching up with people hurrying along the castle wall.
"Your world?"
“Shut the fuck up!” Ron barks and the buzz of voices around the Common Room dies down. “You, a fucking--”
"Anyone may come forward and punish the sinners!" Mr. Vice's voice makes you jump.
We are in the lab, it's late, and my eyes are closing.
My limbs turn to jelly with relief.
But if gratitude is all there
"Okay." I don't know what to say to him.
I never do
"I just wanted to take a walk." I stand up, my feet disobeying me from the cold. "Alone. What's the big deal? I'm not a baby."
"I'm going to die," Harry mumbles, staring at the bite marks.
I wouldn't scream.
Whiteness is flooding my eyes with tears, the empty air stinks of medicine. I blink through the pain at the white ceiling, white walls, white light through the high hospital windows. At your blurred face above the whiteness of your shirt.
And again.
"What?..." You laughed in disbelief. "You really think… I'm fed up, Potter. I'm
"It will," I say and look away. I don't want to think about all the 'what ifs' if something goes wrong, lest I lose my determination to go at all. Hermione's plan of ambushing the Ministry is madness, but it's not like we have a better one. And we need that locket.
"Watch the steps!" Malfoy says - too late - I'm already tripping over and he steadies me by the arm. "Fuck! Sorry."
Harry would. He absolutely would go. And he did.
"Draco, truth or dare?" Maggie repeats.
"Yes." I force a lump in my throat down.
I put the lamp down on the bedside table and turn away, sitting down on the bed with my back to him.
Gathering the supplies, I head upstairs. I want to have at least something finished before he returns.
My eye had caught the headline on the table of Mother's parlour.
"Yes."
"What is it?" I ask.
"No, I mean..." You squint at me, brow furrowed. "I'm sorry, I'm an idiot. What a time to be alive - is what I meant."
His eyes are closed. He nods.
Hermione dragged me to the library yesterday after dinner.
I snap at him from the landing, gripping the corner and moving along the wall to my door.
"No. I'll go with you."
In half an hour, twilight gives way to the darkness, and the garden lamp above the porch switches on. I prop my chin on my knee and sit and sit and sit.
I was thirteen. I could cast a Patronus to set a hundred Dementors on fire.
I think,
there," I say. "Like, why do you think it's called Godric's Hollow?"
I exhale. "I need to wash my face."
And this is what I could never remember; I am reliving it all now. I can't breathe.
To me.
Malfoy breathes, and I watch how his chest and thin stomach move. It makes me embarrassed, I look away - at his broken arm, now fully revealed, lying flat on the mattress, inky lines of the Dark Mark stark against his skin.
She demands. "You're dead."
I'm not about to ask my friends.
No such luck.
He stared, obviously expecting me to protest or insult him, but not to agree.
“Right!” Someone says, as soon as I am seated on the floor. “Let’s begin!”
did you say?"
"What the fuck, Potter? Still spying on me?"
"Rules are rules," Daphne says.
"What's going on?" Pomfrey enters with a box of vials.
"Why did you leave? You said you and your mother were invited--"
"I thought..."
No one seems to care.
"Two hundred!"
I wake up to the bright morning light and the sound of the shower running.
"Draco?!" Crabbe emerges on his heels and gapes at me.
kiss. The mere thought of it still makes me hot all over.
Granger and Weasley are doing
He stops dead. "Draco?"
"Why the fuck do you always take
I'm sitting on the windowsill, staring at my reflection against the night in the dark, glass surface.
"Students in the corridors!" Filch runs along the aisle. "Students in the corridors!"[14]
When I head to the door, he follows.
"Celario!"[3] Granger says next to me, and I watch as Potter and Weasley vanish from view. The place where they have just been shimmers and the air settles, revealing only empty clearing in front of me with the forest in the background.
"Hell if I know."
"What?" His eyes widen. "No, I can't... I can't leave them." He gestures behind him.
Silence fell, dragging out long minutes, as he stood there motionless. Not daring to breathe, you stared at his back.
That's why I keep trying."
"Potter, are you all right?" McGonagall is by the entrance, looking concerned. It strikes me that teachers also know, I've never considered it before.
"Kreacher insists, it's dining room tonight," he says solemnly over Kreacher's head, "come on."
Something squeezes in my throat. I try to swallow it down, to no avail. It's my heart, threatening to choke me.
"Traditional upbringing. Everyone plays, pretty much."
I've had this idea for some time.
"Nothing."
such things were possible. I don't have a father, never had one, you know..." He exhales. "But I couldn't imagine that your own father.... that
Weasley drew his wand, but Potter threw him back with a spell, sending him sprawling on the ground.
I have some ideas as to the library and the living room, but they are just minor changes. The kitchen in the basement is okay, and is actually the most inhabited place in the house, except for Potter's bedroom, I suppose, though I haven't seen it.
"Malfoy?" He frowns. I realise I'm gaping at him.
"Maybe, but I've got an idea of how to make things work for you. Would you like to know, or would you rather keep whining?"
He joined the group only a few days ago. A small mousy man, late thirties. Itchy and nervous, brown hair, dull features. You wouldn't recognise him on the street.
to fuck off all you want. Just help find Draco."
"Oh, it's a super weird story, mate. Last night, I was playing with my Deluminator, and I heard a voice -
"Zabini!" She calls, and the heads snap up. Malfoy, Parkinson, Nott and Zabini in the middle.
“Agreed.”
You don't believe in God or the Devil, but the truth of your broken, twisted nature is ingrained in you as firmly as your family name and obligations that you have no right to fail.
"There are two ways of taking it off, Draco," Father says, "either after you are completely cured,

fill the air.
“Okay,” he says carefully, getting up, too.
"Robert... Robert Weasley."
"Do come in." You stepped aside, dully registering the sick shudder of your unshed tears that ebbed away along with the edge of angry magic seeping back under control.
"Don't flatter yourself," you scoffed, but your lips pressed to my shoulder. "I'm good. Probably will have a problem walking in the morning. But it's a small price to pay for the honour of having the Saviour's golden dick."
He rolled his eyes and you laughed. You both knew you didn't have any pressing matters waiting; you'd prefer anything else to Narcissa's tea party at the Manor. And besides, no one knew about you and him. You were sort of
I know I'm lost forever. From now on, I am not able to un-trust him. It's like falling in love, but deeper - more secure and safe. Something that's not easily undone, not with him.
in the first place? Never was fit for the Mark? I saw him, I know; I'll never forget that awful night when Dumbledore died, and I couldn't help it. When Malfoy was holding him at wand-point, I saw ugly fear and weakness and desperation of an animal trapped; but that was all I saw. And though something tells me that if one makes such shitty choices, probably there is more evil in him than in those who don't - I don't know what would've I done if my family was threatened; I never was in his place.
the realisation fills me with relief and frightens me even more.
"Offend the

Draco doesn't reply for a while. "Mine too," he finally says.
I draw my wand.
again. Though clumsy as it was, my hex did its job, rendering him unrecognisable. It wasn't a stinging hex, it was a reverse-modifying one. His face is neither red nor swollen, it is no longer deformed. But it's fat and round, with full heavy cheeks, a double chin, flat jaw, and a narrow forehead. The only thing I left unchanged is his hair, but they've already seen it, I couldn't take that risk. His nose is tiny and short, the eyebrows are pale and almost non-existent. His full plump lips have turned thin and narrow, and his tiny rabbit eyes behind the glasses are very closely set. There is a big purple bruise on his forehead. He looks grotesque and nothing like Harry. In fact, this face is the literal opposite of Harry's, and if anyone would only stop to think and put two and two together... But no. No one in the room seems to be bright enough.
Approaching, I brace myself.
I stare at him. Is there any chance that he
“You were mental.”
Upon me. It stops.
"Which absolutely
I feel his gloved palm under mine.
We don't talk as he tidies up the desk, clinking the vials, collecting ingredients into the boxes.
"No," I say, "I'm not going to waste it. Maybe I'll fly a bit." And maybe I actually will.
"Ron," I warn him.
"I had to check first." He nods, standing up. "Had to make sure you were being held there against your will."
— Yes.
"I'm on your side," I say instead.
He frowns, gripping me firmer around the waist.
"I know," he repeats.
My head swims as a sudden dizziness overcomes me.
It is dark outside. I'm playing the piano, and tears are running down my face. The melody is coming out sad and helpless, and I feel the house sigh around me.
“Okay.”
Everything is rising in me, my mind suddenly blank, until I can no longer bear it... But there's still more, and more, and
There's a crackling sound, the smell of the fireplace creeps in the air...
Granger and Weasley do basically the same.
The Carrows and their rules be damned. I hate them. They favour me. It makes me sick. Although I never engage in the japes and jokes they send my way in classes, it doesn't matter. Everyone thinks I am one of them. Everyone knows the Dark Lord himself sent me here. Everyone recoils.
He hooks his leg around the back of my thigh, tracing my spine with his fingers. "You

"Sit down, I am not finished."
You never asked anything. You and he hardly were anything. To the world, the two of you didn't exist.
Thick, content with hot mid-afternoon fatigue, your voice tells me that's not what you actually mean. You are lazy and tired, and we probably shouldn't lie in the sun like this...
"Skipping classes, Potter?" He smirks, and I am already reconsidering. I'm in a foul mood, having just fucked up with Gin like an idiot.
"He... he'll kill my parents." My voice cracks. I walk to the water, past Potter, away and back. I breathe and breathe to ebb away this feeling in my throat, to not let the tears flow.
Malfoy is quiet.
As soon as we entered the Common Room and the door clicked shut, a sudden realisation that we were completely alone and no one was going to disturb us stripped us of our bravery, shutting the carelessness off.
You stayed and he left. White shirt and green jacket, ruffled hair and the absence of tie. A whiff of his cologne still lingering in the air even after the sound of his footsteps faded away.
I stop.
"Maybe he's right, Hermione." Harry reaches under the collar of his sweater and retrieves his tiny leather pouch. He rummages inside it until the buzzing Snitch flies out and lands into his palm.
"It's okay," he says against my lips, "come on."
I run to the living room, where the folder with my drawings lies on the coffee table.
My voice barely obeys me, and it comes out as a croak.
He rolls over. "You're hard, let me—" I think he frowns—without glasses I cannot tell—and plants a kiss on my neck, and touches me again.
"You're safe." His voice is in my ear. "I've got you. Now cry."
in the twilight, on the deserted bench by the lake. And just when I’d begun to think he’d stopped stalking me.
I move my hand, over and over, fascinated by his face. His lips part, and he winces... and holds his breath... and swallows and exhales.
I would mimic his best, his most annoying drawl.
If he wanted to break free, it wouldn't stop him. But because of that very reason, it is

something - anything!
I haven’t seen him since I left his house. And there's no reason for us to meet. No pretext.
"At what?" I grip the locket and squeeze it in my palm. It's as cold as ever, though it feels strangely alive.
"Madam Pomfrey," she calls quietly.
"Draco."
I cover my face and follow Potter to the main entrance. Once outside, he grabs my hand, Apparating us to the Grimmauld living room.
happen, Harry. Do you understand?"
"Weasley." He moves around the room, his voice sounding to my left. "He was going for the kill."
But there is Dumbledore's word against their suspicions, and for Potter it outweighs their reasons.
“No problem.” My heart gives just a tiny thud out of tune.
are making me angry!"³ The boy shoves him away. "Get off me!" He runs down the steps of the dais and along the aisle between the chairs, heading to the door.
"But how many invisibility cloaks that fit the description do you know?" Weasley insists. "If the Cloak is real, so are the other two."
I want it all.
mere hours ago. Breathing heavily after the climb, I lean against the railing and look down. I suddenly realise that I stand at the very spot where Dumbledore stood, touch the stone where he laid his hand, look down at the ground where he fell. There's nothing and no one there now. They carried the body away, I don't know where. Probably to his private chambers. It's still dark, but the dawn begins to gnaw at the black line of the Forbidden Forest. The world is still and silent. Empty. As empty as I am.
I assumed that Dumbledore would surely include me in Malfoy's secret since it was my idea in the first place. I thought he'd ask my opinion, and even allow me to help. It's Malfoy, and it's not like I'm eager to get into trouble on his behalf, but... well... I nearly killed him, I have to make amends.

Sirius was still grinning before it turned into a frown and he slowly turned his head to Draco, "Hey! I am not a princess!"
"Hello, Nico."
Hadrian and the group followed Dumbledore and the rest of the Order out of the kitchen and into the sitting room. The air was tense and nervous. Dumbledore charmed more seats to sit, and they all sat on one couch together.
Before Voldemort could make a smart retort, Bellatrix squealed and ran to Harry and Draco giving them both a hug, "My nephews! Oh, your auntie Bella missed you soo much! Didn't you miss me!"
Remus and Harry both reached in their back pocket and gave their chosen men their phones and before they could ask questions they simultaneously said, "Look at the phone."
greeted him.
Sirius moaned again as Remus slowly entered another finger, "Yes.
"Dumbledore is the greatest wizard since Merlin!"
Hermione knew everyone was studying their ex-family, or in Draco's case his godfather but Hermione only had eyes for the Weasley’s, and she stared at them with hate. Especially Molly. She was the one to cause Ron the most pain. Yes, his dad was involved, and the twins were definitely part of it too but Molly? Molly was the cause of so much hurt and even though Hermione knew, knew that she loved her son, knew that she just wanted what was best, knew that she didn't want to hurt him, she also knew that she did, she hurt Ron whether she meant to or not. Hermione would never forgive her.
Still silence.
Draco didn't say anything at first and instead grabbed Harry's hand as they walked to the door. Draco reached for the door to open it before turning and spinning Harry around so that he was pinned to the door. He went to his lips and murmured, "I don't look as good as you, birthday boy." and kissed him.
Sirius came back to work at the same time he did every day but he knew something was off. Nothing looked different, he didn't hear Harry since he was down for a nap. But Remus didn't come and greet him, and his Moony
I DO NOT SUPPORT J.K. ROWLING AND DOBBY WROTE THE BOOKS!!
They were going in order, and all turned to Hermione, who didn't take her place. Ron pulled her closer to him, "What's wrong love?"
Hadrian nodded, 'For today'
Warning: Very Brief Speak Indication of Sexual Assault and Child Neglect
As he took off his mask, he ignores the gasps of the Weasley's at seeing Ron, the gasp of Severus at seeing him and Draco, and the gasps of James and Lily at seeing him. He only had eyes for his little brother who had tears in his eyes. He gave him a small smile,
They all snorted, and Hermione answered, "Because we didn't want you to."

He was just walking around to nowhere, he had been kicked out of the Dursley's house, again. He would go back soon enough, they wanted the money Dumbledore offered them.
---------------------------------
"Harry, I have grown to care for you in this week along with my other death eaters like Bella and Lucius, but I- you seem to have found in my heart, I was wondering if you would allow me the chance to adopt you."
Harry and Draco stayed in the room and watched as Voldemort inflicted curse after curse on the man who ruined his life. Finally, Voldemort relented his curses only to have his son start them back up again. When Dumbledore was on the brink of death, he gave a shaky laugh, "Go ahead and kill me, Death is but the next great adventure."
They all bowed before leaving and once they finally did, Voldemort took off the glamour that made him look half snake and changed back to his handsome self, "How many times have I told you not to call me that Harry?"
As the Order got settled, Hadrian turned to see how his group was faring. Ron was tense and angry; Hermione was annoyed at them all and Draco... Draco wouldn't stop staring at Severus.
Draco thought a movie for 2 hours then dinner for about another 2 was perfect until 11:00 since it was only 7:15 now.
Nicolas stared into the eyes of his brother; his vision slightly blurred. He wanted to rush over and hug him, he wanted to demand where he'd been and why hadn't he come back to him, he wanted to beg him to stay and never leave him again. There were so many things he wanted to do but he felt like he was in quicksand. His brother was really here.
Sirius started to move closer but was interrupted by the door opening and Harry running on their bed and jumping into Sirius,
Draco groaned, "How I wish that I could talk in that language, then you would see the effects it has."
Molly couldn't believe Ron, no son of hers would be staying in a room with his girlfriend unsupervised, "Now see here Ronald, there is no way I'll be allowing you to stay in and room with your girlfriend, especially not overnight! As your mother--"
At the moment, Harry wondered if it would be that bad, that bad if he just let Voldemort have him now, he only had few people to live for... but what would that do to them. Fred, George, Luna, and Neville. His people.
If I want to talk to you in the story, I will put in bolds and parentheses A/N then say what I want to say. For example,
Seeing the subject chance for what was, Hadrian, answered, "Just as I remembered, Scheming and Manipulative. He's not evil but he's not a kind old man either."
"Harry? Love? Are you there? I wasn't too rough, was I?"
"I loved seeing Severus again, he was the only one I missed. At the moment I just feel on my guard, I know my parents aren't here, but I'll have to see them again."
Hadrian rolled his eyes, "Then we don't do it, simple. Don't know why you guys are making such a big fuss about it."
Hermione was proud of Ron for standing his ground, remembering his worry that he would let them walk all over him again, she grabbed his hand from where she was standing and squeezed, trying to convey how she felt without letting them see, remembering one of the first things Harry had said to her, 'Don't let them see how you feel. It will always give them an advantage no matter the situation.'
"Well, we have to go."
After exchanging 'I love you', Ron and Hermione left, and Draco and Hadrian got settled in bed together. Hadrian wrapped his arms around Draco kissing him softly on his head, "We got this Draco."
It turns out, Harry was right.
Harry and Draco were in his father's manor in Harry's room. They were 16. Harry was laying on Draco's chest while Draco's fingers curdled his hair. Harry knew how he felt about Draco, he was just too scared to say something.
Voldemort looked happy at this but he still looked nervous and Harry for the life of him couldn't figure out why, "Voldemort, anything you wanna say, you can say it to me...I can take it."
Harry turned to his group who by now had their hoods off, take your pick guys, you know who's mine. Harry stunned Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Mr and Mrs Weasley and walked out with Draco. Neville chose to torture Professor Snape who he definitely wasn't scared of anymore. Luna chose the girls who used to bully her. Theo chose Crabbe and Goyle who always tore up his books and mocked him. Pansy chose Daphne Greengrass whom she never got along with and lastly, Blaise chose some people that didn't seem random but no one knew why he chose them.
Draco hummed, "Well, I don't think that's very good from the surprise I have from your father."
When Remus's mouth reacher the clothed cock, he glanced back up at Sirius who was still watching him. Remus continued to stare until Sirius nodded his consent and that's when Remus's hands reached up and slowly pulled down the boxers, freeing an eager cock.
The more Hadrian spoke the more fear the man had in his eyes, "L-look, I-I could g-give you some m-money. Y-you'd like that, eh?"
Sirius held him tighter, "When is our life ever fair?"
Draco rolled his eyes, "Anyways, I was obviously flirting with the cashier. He was rather cute, I think."
It was silent for the next 30 minutes until Harry whispered again, "Draco! They are gonna get caught!"
Harry is a dominant person who takes no shit from no one except maybe his family. Harry is the leader of their group and the most powerful. He doesn't have all these exceptional powers, but he has learned to use the power he has. Harry is confident and takes pride in his power and accomplishments but isn't cocky.
Harry smiled smugly, "Yeah, you go do that! Then you'll see my problem."
Hadrian came out of his room with still wet hair but fresh clothes. He saw Hermione, Ron, and Draco all sitting on the sofa chatting quietly looking nervous, but Hadrian noticed they ceased conversation as soon as they noticed he came in.
I never owned you, I never did. But oh, did I wish to.

"I don't want to date her!" He shouts back. "What the fuck is this all about? Even if I did, what's your problem, Potter?! Are you jealous?!"
A glimpse of blond hair flashes at the entrance, and my heart gives a jolt.
"You're…" My face is on fire. "You're back."
“I still might.” I protest. “How do you know I won’t?”
"I don't know, maybe... er... probably yes. Eventually, we might." He looks at me, surprised at the sudden change of topic. "How do you know?"
I had piano lessons as a child. Every pureblood does. It's something one has to learn, as well as ballroom dancing, my teacher used to say.
He points his wand at me. I can't believe it. In dread, I realise that he won't help me. It's not the Potter I've known for the past few weeks. Not the one I talked to in the dark in 'our' spot behind the kitchen door. Not the one who brought me to his house.
"Ron! Goyle! Quickly!"
Like some bloody werewolf
"Nothing... just..." I say helplessly. How am I supposed to put this into words? "It's just..." I look away.
As the bird swooped out of the window, my heart swooped with it.
Granger is dissatisfied. "I can't

She whispers angrily. "Your Father brought this plague on us, and now we've gone too far to turn around. But when all this is over, I want my family whole and safe, whatever the outcome will be. This is all I ever cared for. Remember that. You are going to Hogwarts."
I dash out of the kitchen, into the hall, and up, up the stairs to my room.
"I don't
"If she could, Mother would make me wear a tie and a high collar every time I visited her for tea," he said last night, unbuttoning the top two buttons of his shirt and ruffling his hair in front of the mirror.

to meet my fate in Potter's lifeless stare.
"Thanks," I say.
She sits at the side of my bed. "How do you feel?"
“How am I supposed to ride? Are you taking the piss?”
“She has long dark hair, shiny and beautiful. She often wears it to one side over her shoulder.”
“Oh, Snape told me, have no doubt, what a cheating little bastard you were.”
"Expecto Patronum!"
"Friends told me in detail." I pull the jumper on and sit down on the bed to put on my boots.
And maybe I've been unfair, for once he'd tried to call his friend out on his shit. My anger is still vivid, but reaching the end of the corridor, I stop.
"Yep."
"Do... a...
My eyes suddenly prickling, I turn my face away. Fuck. Isn't that stupid? My useless eyes are unable to see but still can cry.
it. But I want him to. Oh, do I want him to. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I want. He's only willing to give what is needed.
"Sit where you are," I add.
I touch myself to his name on my lips and shudder.
When I enter the Room of Requirement, I see Malfoy curled on the bed with his back to me.
"I don't. But Weasley is done, and you’re an idiot. Someone has to keep an eye on you." His voice is harsh, sneering; I'm suddenly reminded of the Malfoy I knew before. He makes me sick.
remember: he is performing my task; he is doing what I commanded him to.
"The one who wrote that note," Hermione says beside me, and I tear my eyes away from Malfoy who now says something into Parkinson's ear with his arm around her.
A figure moves in front of me, and I look up. Too late. Aunt Bella’s curse reaches me, and I don't understand... Harry's Shield holds, I am sure, but...
"If he can play so beautifully, he probably can't be that bad," Molly had told me once.
"Sixty-two! Sixty-three! Sixty-four!.." the roar makes me wince.
"I knew I was in love with you the day we brewed Amortentia," I whisper into the crook of his neck. "When you opened the lid and there were your
A mad shriek rips the silence, and another one, someone is running right at us.
For a couple of months, yes, since the moment Noir appeared in my life.
Zabini is so pissed off, that I see he barely restrains from punching me. I would gladly punch myself.
"Malfoy!"
"No."
I rise on my feet, my legs unsteady, taking a step into the centre where Malfoy is waiting for me.
"You thought I'd had it plenty?" He laughs. "Thought of it often, did you?"
I stand up from the armchair and approach to peer over his shoulder. There is a small triangle drawn on the page's top corner. A triangle with a circle and a vertical line inside.
One of the cupboards opens and closes quietly.
"It was a Stag."
Something coils in my stomach. I don't like it. I don't think I want to know what he's about to say next.
You do the same, sending ripples in my direction.
"Good." I sit down.
"Why?"
“Or something stronger, mate,” Seamus claps me on the shoulder. “Are you in?”
"Draco, it's
I look at his back. He's wrong. I'm my Father's son, and that's never going to change.
"Malfoy, tell me!
The door creaks open. "Potter?"
Whatever may have come to my head must have been true. It has been staring me in the face. It’s just… I was too much of a coward to realise it.
He walks away.
"So he told you."
I did. We didn't notice when it got dark. Then he got up to switch the bedside lamp on and lay his head back down on my lap.
Just...
He is very close, if I leaned just a little, I would touch his face with mine, and his
Everything turns into chaos. People shout, shards of glass and debris scatter in the air, and I feel my lips sting, my temple, my forehead. I cover my face and suddenly hit the floor. I guess my Father has knocked me down. Amidst the roar and chaos and hexes flying, on all fours, I crawl into the corner. When I finally manage to look up again, I see Harry and Weasley pick up Granger's unconscious body as the elf jumps on Harry's back from behind - and they are gone, leaving only a silvery swirl shimmering in the air.
I approach and squat beside it. No, I'm imagining things. I know the

There is a
"Fuck, Malfoy," I grunt, dragging him into the corner behind the pillar, the very one Dumbledore threw me into. "You could get up and walk on your own, save me the trouble."
Potter stands up. "Kreacher!"
Potter appears at her side.
"Yes, sucked the venom out," Harry repeats, "with his own mouth, yes, if you know what that means. He risked his own life for me."
He leans into me and gasps, and presses his face into the side of my neck. His breath is harsh and hot against my skin, and when it suddenly catches, I feel his shudder and a whispered moan. Warmth spills through my fingers, and I feel wetness through the front of my shirt. He shudders one last time and stills, leaning heavily into me.
"Lucius -" Mother began, but you didn't let her finish.
"I'll tell you when to stop, go on." He is grinding something in the mortar. "Now. Stop. I'm going to add the powdered root of asphodel. Begin stirring clockwise when I tell you. Ready?" He moves so close, that I feel his breath on my face.
"Where?" Harry asks.
“Thanks.” I turn to him. “You know…I’ve been thinking...” I hesitate.
"It's the sign of the Deathly Hallows," I say, and they both look up at me.
when I am already certain it never will, I nearly lose my shit.
"Thanks," he said distractedly, focused on pouring and stirring and not paying any attention to me: how I held my breath for a second, how I looked at his eyebrows, drawn in concentration, how I watched the iridescent flicker of the potion, reflecting in his transparent eyes.
"Ah, it's..." He laughs. "It was pretend, making appearances. She's a lesbian."
The mere thought that there might be someone suddenly takes all the joy away.
The corridors are deserted during lunchtime. I meet no one on my way to the Room of Requirement.
"Thank you, Kreacher." I stand up. "I'll be downstairs in a minute."
It’s a weird look that he gives me. I mean, it is certainly not new, but somehow it is: this mix of haughtiness and something like contempt, but not
"I am sorry, Harry… I—" She rummaged in her handbag, retrieving a handkerchief. "I don't know what to say." She shrugged and noisily blew her nose and made a face, tucking the white piece of cloth back into the bag.
"What?! Are you okay, Potter?" He snaps. "Do you actually remember that
Kreacher. Go."
"You Father has gone bonkers. He knew instantly when you’d left the place. But he can't track you down here. My home is under Fidelius."
“No. I’m perfectly capable of… fuck!” I’m having a problem with the buckle. I could have asked Kreacher to help me dress - as usual - and be ready in no time. I’m not going to make a spectacle in front of Malfoy, having myself dressed like a baby.
like that."
Man-and-woman, boy-and-girl, M-and-F, couples swirl around. Those, at least, who know how to swirl. Those who don’t sway modestly in place, shuffling their feet to the music.
He pulls back and takes his glasses off, putting them carefully down on the floor, then cups my face and kisses me.
"Fuck, Potter..." I stand up, tugging at the front; it's damp, and I feel the T-shirt underneath is soaked through as well.
I wrap my hand around his cock.
I mean, there are Ron and Hermione, of course, and we talk, but it's not the same. Ginny and I never talked that much... especially, not about

He looks at her. A silent spell from her wand hits him square in the face, and he cries out, clutching at his eyes.

or some such. Something I'd hardly be able to pull off. I think it comes down to the way a person holds themselves... their body language and grace, or lack thereof...
"Mr. Potter... Harry!" Narcissa Malfoy grips my hand, catching me from falling.
Potter says nothing. He takes the chair facing the window to my Father's left, leaving me the seat across from Father, as though putting himself as a barrier between us. I am grateful.
"Where's the guarantee he won't leave Hogwarts and go wandering around, getting himself killed? Or he may even return to You-Know-Who's side," Granger says grimly.
Grinning, I turn to him. “How?”
I knew it did. It loved you. Probably because you were related to the Black family, or maybe because you played the piano, or for any other mysterious reason, your presence brought the house to life. It never particularly cared for me, and once you were gone for good, I wouldn't be able to stay here alone.
Two years you spent tiptoeing around Theo, trying hard not to give yourself away. You felt that he might like you in return, that he might already
Father glances briefly at Potter, who sits with his arms crossed, staring out of the window. His presence is steadying, and at the same time a bit unsettling. I am trying so hard not to appear a sissy in front of him.
We grew apart with Ron and Hermione, the three of us no longer being as attached in the hip as we used to be. But we are not kids anymore. The two of them are having their relationship to deal with and I... We all have our secrets, our secret lives, reluctant to share everything with each other, always on our guard. And since I'd begun talking to Noir, I hadn't needed anyone else to talk to - to really talk about the things that matter to me. A pang of guilt tells me that perhaps I've been neglecting my friends, and they noticed.
You step through the Floo into your living room, shrugging your uniform jacket off on the way.
"They are coming!" Someone says, and the voice rings loud in the hushed Great Hall. "They are coming!"
“Nothing," Malfoy says too quickly.
There is no plan. I know nothing. Dumbledore had a plan, but he didn't live long enough to tell me.
I imagine Noir in that shower, touching himself right next to me, having no idea that a stall away I’m doing the same. Maybe he even hears me doing it, not realising what he's listening to. I see his hand sliding over the length, his cock thick and flushed. Water is sluicing down his arching neck. He swallows, his throat moving, leaning against the wall for support. I see the bow of his lips, mouth falling open in pleasure. His blond hair is plastered to his head, turning dark-gold under water, and his hand is moving faster, shoulder straining, muscles rippling alive beneath his skin.
The door opens again.
His hands are on my hips. "May I?"
It's suddenly not that simple, we suddenly absolutely
"It's not stupid... and...  look... it's kind of crazy, yeah? All this..." I wave my hand. "Absolutely wild. Can we just... sit for a second and talk?"
"What the hell,
"No, really?"
The strap of my satchel pressed down over my shoulder as he adjusted it. I reached out and found the sleeve of his jumper. I wasn't going to link arms with Malfoy, absolutely not, but I needed to hold onto him somehow, right?
I looked in her wake until she disappeared among the crowd heading to the Gates.
Fuck. They'll never give me a rest.

spasms are gripping my stomach and I’m heaving again.
I don't know. However, I don't distrust him completely anymore, this much I can tell. And I see no harm in telling him about the Ministry. It's not like I've told him about Horcruxes or anything.
~ Hogwarts Express, please and thank you. I'm offering my hand.
I follow him in silence along the dark corridors, the sound of our feet on stone stark for the world to hear. When we finally enter the Room and the door blends into the wall, Potter turns to me and wrenches the Cloak off.
Hell if I know what that meant. For a few days, I was jumpy and anxious, expecting his return any minute. He never came back, so eventually, I'd ceased to fret.
"Yes, I've brought you a sample to test."
"How are you?" He asks, glancing in turns between the Tower Bridge over the river and my sketch of it.
"I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on!" My voice echoes around the hollow room.
"Where are you going?" I asked your back.
Running wet hands through my hair a few times, I finally leave the bathroom.
"See you, I'm… I just remembered, I've got some stuff to finish.” You itched to turn away and flee.
Cursing myself and my weakness, I brush past him, making my way through the crowd, faster and faster, out of the Great Hall, until I reach the main staircase and stop.
We promised Harry, we-" Tears brimmed in her voice.
“Put this one into the envelope, Kreacher, and prepare another piece of parchment, please.”
It worked. Weasley twins. Though the last time I heard them on Weasley's radio they called themselves Robert and Robin or some such, I have no doubt it's them.
“That’s better.” I feel the brush of his lips against my temple.
What a pathetic crap
"Get off him." Potter's voice was murderous.
"Why do you care?"
"The part that I don't...
I know immediately.
"We can mark it and return here later."
"Ms. Granger." Mother drops my hand. "May I have a minute of your time?"
"Well... everything..." I wave my hand. "This Spin the Bottle thing. Urging one another to snog other people, what couple in their right mind would do that?"
You said no more, steering the motorbike higher into the night skies. I guess, I felt your smile with my ear pressed to the side of your face.
Once I heard girls talking in the library: "Draco is not that bad, look at him around Harry Potter."
“You are such a nerd.” I jab him in the ribs.
Next time I see him
"Thank you, Dobby." I press the handle when a sudden thought strikes me. Dobby is a free elf, after all, and can do as he pleases, so nothing really prevents him from...

The light flares on, and I stare at the three of them in the doorway. Grim, stony-faced, all three hold me at the wand point. We stare at each other in silence. Potter is the first to lower his wand.
I turn on the spot, dumbly surveying chaos around me. Death Eaters fight, Death Eaters flee, Death Eaters giving way. And there, in the middle, the body lies motionless. The body of the man who called himself the Dark Lord. I step closer. In his death, he looks like any other. Just a man.
Then why do I feel sick?
Full of mirth, your eyes would be hiding wariness, fatigue lurking in the corners. "Pray tell me, what kind of
His busy weekends were not uncommon. He never explained anything. He worked in the Department of Mysteries. He couldn't really talk about his job.
Because this is how it should be.
"Sorry," you repeat.
Mother squeezes my hand and smiles. She says no more and strokes the back of my hand with gentle fingers. Her touch is soothing, my eyes close.
"He will not. Believe me, when he hears, he won't."
Granger cut him off, nodding in my direction.
"Thanks." My palms hurt, I'm suddenly embarrassed. "I… I think I'm done." Releasing their hand, I begin walking, carefully prodding the floor with my feet... "Sorry, sorry guys…" People part before me. "May I?... Thanks…"
He laughs, leaning close. His wet hair is plastered back, away from his forehead, giving him a rather severe and formal look. What a ridiculous thought, giving what we're doing here.
He never signed his letters.
Also, this time there would be Malfoy. Often around, always at the back of my mind. I used to have him on my mind, nothing new - but this time it would be different.
He goes still and rigid. This is all I need. I bring his bleeding wrist to my mouth and suck, and spit, and
"Masturbation is forbidden," read the blond guy from the row ahead.
Potter laughs again, good-natured and a bit tipsy. "If anything, it should be me - a good thief. Dursleys never allowed me to have things; anything of mine, whatever possessions I might have had, were old shabby things my cousin no longer needed, and even so..." He stares into flames. "They never ceased to remind me that nothing I ever had was really mine. They even begrudged me food, so… I don't know how I didn’t grow up a criminal."
Only then you realise, it's Henry. Henry Ponder and his partner Miranda. Before you almost knocked them out with your waltz, they'd been peacefully shuffling their feet by the wall, not getting in the way of those who really
In a minute, Ron and Hermione were there, and then tons of people, including Kingsley himself. In an hour, I was in St. Mungo's, healers arguing over me.
It sounded crazy indeed. "Why would his father kidnap him?"
I look at him over my shoulder, bright moonlight reflecting off his glasses. He sits with his arms crossed. All the fight leaves me, and now I just feel tired. I walk towards him and sit on the bench.
Pomfrey says I'm almost healed and will be out of here soon enough. Can't wait.
Unable to bear my damned house in your absence, I would grasp the Ministry offer of working abroad for a year and flee.
Today at potions we brew Amortentia, it isn't helping at all.
…to be Parkinson's boyfriend
"What?" He laughs - a low, unabashed sound. "I mean… really, Potter?!"
Slowly, he headed down the corridor and I followed, holding him by the sleeve. Only then did the noise around us resume. When I heard Ron talking in a low voice behind us, I realised he'd been standing there all along.
"Alright, Potter?" Your hand swam into view and, surprising myself, I reached for it, letting you pull me up.
I scribble frantically below his words, stuffing it back inside.
"Yes," you said, feeling a tear rolling out of the corner of your eye. You didn't think there was a way to fix you, to fix it all.
"No. No way." I came up and put my hand on the motorbike, because what the fuck? You absolutely weren't going to...
"Is Master Black enjoy his casserole?"
And prove to me

Silently, I am coming with him.

You stayed ever since, more often than not.
She finally gave up.

hair. Malfoy whines and curses and manages to flip me on my stomach, straddling my arse. He grips a fistful of my hair, wrenching my head back with such force that my neck cracks. I cry out in pain. With his free hand, Malfoy reaches under my chest and finds the locket; he wrenches at it until the chain snaps. He hurls it into the cave, and I hear it crash into the wall.
I lower my wand.
The morning is bright and very cold. But even colder was his gaze when we met in the air after the whistle blew. After that he hasn't looked at me even once.
"And how is that?" I watch him closely. He doesn't fidget, doesn't show any sign of fear.
I wanted to slip my hand under my belly, but you grabbed it, pressing it into the pillow, leaving me frustrated and needy and trapped. Until I came untouched, my cock rubbing helplessly against the sheets.
I don't worry, I don't care, I don't think about it anymore. And if I'm jealous? Well, yes, I am. So what?
"Don't kill him!" I shriek and throw myself at Goyle "Don't kill him!"[15]
"Yes. Thank you." My smile is genuine.
Just playin' it cool
"No." I propped my chin on the desk. "Not a word."
"I know." I shrug. "But Father doesn't think so. And I wish he were right. I wish it could be fixed."
Out, out of here. If I could, I would run. I don't. Reaching the main staircase, I put my hand on the bannisters, starting to climb.
"I didn't, are you insane?" Familiar annoyance rises in me. Seems like even the bracelet is not able to completely suppress my reaction to Potter. "I never planned for it to happen. Someone... figured it out and told my Father. And it's been a hell ever since."
He turns his head and kisses me, languid and slow, his quiet laugh blooming between our lips.
, I know you are, it's just I don't see it."
"What? You're inviting me to my own room?"
I want to feel him whole, I want to
"Apparate me to my bedroom." I wipe my eyes with the back of my hand. "I want to lie down. What time is it?"
"You don't own me!" How many times would I hear your voice in my dream?
There are two bunk beds in the tent, a shabby armchair, and a table. Space is spelled, no doubt, so the interior is much larger than it appears from the outside. Still, it's not too vast for four people to share. There’s another room behind the flap, but I don’t dare to go and check what’s there.
With a bow, he disappeared before we even could say thank you.
"No!" Without a warning, he stuffs a handful of snow under my collar.
"I don't
Some half an hour later, we are heading along the corridor to my room, carrying our clothes, giggling like two idiots - because we are naked, and there's no one here to stop us.
The password? Weasley never used a password, at least as far as I was aware of. I adjust the switch carefully back and forth.
"Dumbledore told me to hide you, once he... once he was dead, that's what he meant, I think... he knew they were going to kill him." I wipe my eyes and force the lump in my throat down.
I barely have a moment to brace myself, barely have a second to see a flash of blond hair falling across his bewildered eyes, as I whirl him around to face me, to wrench him close and meet his lips.
in his stare that makes me aware of my naked body. Not in a good way.
I grabbed the vial, putting it into his open palm.
“A hot shower.” He discards his boots.
could this be happening.
"No! I mean, at Hogwarts?" I lean forward, clutching the blanket to my chest. "Why would you want to come back?"
"It was a joke!"
He might like me as well, I think. Otherwise he wouldn't be spending hours flying in my company, would he? Flying until it's dark, until our fingers go numb from cold, until I barely see him, and he shouts over the deserted pitch:
"Is that true?" I turn to Severus.
“The paperwork.” Trying a smile, you stuffed your hands in your pockets. “I’m so behind, Robards will have my head." You nodded at him and finally turned around, picking your pace up the street.
"What's your perfume?" I blurt. I wasn't supposed to say that.
"Yes, Father," you used to say. And you never did, never forgot that.
I catch my breath and grin and nod… and leave her in the middle, heading to take my seat by Seamus's side.
"Your Noir is the one to
"Ah, okay... it's for her parents you were sucking your brains out, snogging at the Halloween party?"
This is not the time and place.
You think he will flee, but he doesn't. Instead, he takes a step towards you.
"Yeah." I felt embarrassed for some reason.
I defiantly stuff another slice into my mouth, all the while hoping that Astoria can see me right now, eating half of the token of her affection.
A half an hour later, I am sipping scalding tea, sitting at the kitchen table. It's cold here, and I shiver, looking around, and notice a grey woollen sweater I saw on Potter at dinner. It's fucking freezing, and I'm only in the T-shirt and my pyjama bottoms…
"Potter," he says.
He clears his throat. "Your Mother contacted me today. She says she wants to meet you tomorrow. In a Muggle place. She's given me an address."
Bewildered, Weasley turned to me. At the edge of my vision, Potter scrambled on his feet. Weasley's fist collided with my cheekbone, making me stumble back. I clutched at my face as pain exploded before my eyes.
Cursing, I crawl on the floor and point my wand under the armchair: "Accio coin."
The novelty of me being a thing at Hogwarts is wearing off. But all the same, people stare; they whisper and throw glances at me. How long will it take for them to stop?
And though I've never seen him, he is there, he exists, he's right here; the one who knows my heart as well as I know his.
Take your pick.
My thoughts slow, thick like jelly, I stare at the spot where he stood mere moments ago. No, no. It's a mistake, someone's stupid mistake. It cannot be happening, not to Dumbledore, never to him.
His eyes suddenly snap open.
I haven't heard from her since that Floo call a week ago, when the connection had suddenly broken. I go cold. I hadn't paid it much thought then, but what if that meant that Father had caught her making that call?
I see Zabini, pulling Malfoy away with his arm over his shoulder. Malfoy throws his arm off, speeding up until he breaks into the run, disappearing around the stands.
I hold him for a while, evening my own breaths.

He looks up. His eyes are waiting, expecting
Ron and Hermione decline.
"And the remaining are?" I tighten my grip around his chest. He leans back into me, and I lean against the wall.
“I don’t know, I…”
"I'm good." I'm hurting, I want to hurt, to take it all. "Fuck me."
It is all the more bewildering now to find yourself within a Muggle religious facility, having been placed here by no other than your Father himself.
"Yes." He snorts. "Potter, look… I'm really sorry, I hadn't the faintest idea. Sitting next to you this morning, I didn't notice anything. Now… you weren't wearing glasses, wouldn't take notes. It makes sense."
"Kreacher misses you, you know. And the house, too, I think. Though I’m not good in talking to it... So I thought..." He trails off.
"Astoria Greengrass?"
"Draco, I..." I desperately wanted to move, to thrust, to go wild on him. He shut me up with a kiss, squeezing his thighs around me. I tore my lips away. "Draco, I..."
No one talks to me, except Potter, though even he is often not in the mood. I avoid him when he wears the locket. There's an
"Yes. From my Mother."
Weasley complains. At the lack of food, at the ache in his arm, at the cold, at my presence. If not for me, he said more than once, food would have lasted longer.
“Seamus?” I call. “May I have some more of your stuff?”
"Harry."
"Draco?" Harry turns to me.
The next morning, when your Father summoned you straight out of bed, you knew immediately that something was wrong. How terribly wrong, however, you realised only upon seeing his face.
I see that they both are not quite convinced of my agenda, and to say that they are not happy about it would be an understatement.
He nods. "I think there
It made me sick. And furious.
"I'm telling you, they're doing it as long as it gets under your skin. If we stopped getting embarrassed, they'd drop it."

The customer reached out, letting the stones pour against his open palm.
With his wand drawn, Weasley dashes into the room and Harry follows.
"I've seen his memories," he says with his back to me, "he attached them to the case as evidence. You used Cruciatus on him, repeatedly, so spare me this

I go cold.
"What?" He whispered into my neck.
I shove him in the chest. "You must've had a good laugh, eh?" I shout.
"Now, back to the matter at hand," he raises his voice, and silence falls instantly. "What do you know about Potter's plans, schemes, whereabouts?"
I nod. Whatever horrors he may see, I'm sure, their nature differs from mine.
I wrench against my bonds. At least I think that I do... or would have done if I could. I can't even blink.
I am standing by the wall with a glass in my hand, observing the couples whirling on the dance floor. Music is loud, gowns are dizzying. I am dressed up and on tenterhooks.
"Father is being released in a week, dear." She sat at the foot of your bed.
I try to raise my head and growl when it falls back and hits the stone floor. Sharp pain makes sparkles bloom before my eyes.
Harry reaches out with his hand. It's not Harry. He is not. And yet, he is. He is so beautiful.
You shrug; hell if you know, but obviously the guys have got into trouble.
"Yes."
I don't know.
"Yes, I'm glad."
He does anyway.
His face grim, Potter glances at Granger and then turns to me. My time is running out. If he listens to her, nothing will help me.
He looks at me, not saying anything for a long moment, then shakes his head. "Alright, Potter." He resumes walking, but in a slower pace, and I follow.
Letting go of my hand, Zabini nodded and walked out, leaving us alone.
Shit, the pig-head pisses me off.
I can't get enough.
"Naughty..." His breath is shallow. "
Reporters can't harass me at Hogwarts.
I kiss him, and he melts against me, going pliant, kissing fervently back.
My heart gives a jolt.
Mother. I roll my eyes. I didn't want to deal with it, I just wanted to be alone.
I peer to the left and right. Can't discern where the sound is coming from. It is everywhere.
"I had nothing to do with it, Potter," he bristles.
[3] Celario
"Yes. There you are, Mr. Ponder. Please, follow me."
Once I even heard someone else there in the kitchen, a man's voice. People talking over each other, shouts and commotion. But when they emerged, there were only three of them.
It's only a rasp, barely a whisper. But you flinch, and grab my hand and squeeze, bringing it up to your lips. Your face is wet. Why are you crying? You've done nothing wrong.
She nods. "The snake, it..."
His eyes burn bright.
“Fuck off!” I shove him. “I’m gonna dance after a drink or two, more like”
"My Kensington flat. You are always welcome there, my dear. And here... I’ve brought you this.”
Except the very thing I cannot figure out
I snuggle into him, pulling a blanket over us both.
"What?"
Of course I've fucking CHANGED.
"Look, mate, I'm so sorry, I don't know what possessed me, I... It wasn’t me, it-"
"Harry!"
"Hi." Releasing Malfoy's arm, I reach out to touch the back of the chair that is put for me next to the bench at the end of the table. "See you, Malfoy," I throw over my shoulder.
He laughed, pulling me away from the door. "I felt awful, having to give myself away in front of all those people. I was jealous and…"
"You didn't? But you
"Nothing." You smile. "It's just... I think I could lie here forever."
"How so?" He raises his eyebrows. “Your hen house debut…”
"Please, leave. Just
“Hmmm… yes?” I bounce in place, lifting my face up in the direction of his voice.
I finally step out of the water, past Potter, and bend down for my wand on top of my clothes. I feel his presence behind my back, tension radiating off him, stirring
into his hair...
He spied on me copying my letters before sending them to Noir, as I always do, to keep our entire dialogue. I usually do it in the library alone, to avoid Ron asking questions.
Around the same time, you realised that you liked Theo more than a friend should. It didn't come as a surprise, but you knew that you'd never act on it. Nothing could ever happen. Muggle arts is one thing, but for someone like you, with your upbringing and family duties,
"Good?" I kiss his shoulder and neck, and when he arches, I press my lips under his jaw.
"Pansy cornered me after I'd written that note on the information board," he says, "she recognised my mother's handwriting. I mean - I modified my handwriting into my mother's. Hadn't thought Pans would figure out. But we'd grown up together, you know, family invitations and stuff; holiday cards they received from my mother and such."
"You smell so good."
“I’ve been meaning to ask.” Lathering my hair up, I turn to face him, because f
"What board?"
My heart drops.
more of them apart from the one vile thing in our possession.
"Me neither," he says quietly.
My gaze falls on his lips, to the smudge of red lipstick still remaining - Parkinson's mark - and I don't like it there.
Whatever she may think or feel looking closely at his Dark Mark, she doesn't show, proceeding steadily in her work, as the bones align with a faint sound. Pomfrey is a tough one; she gives the impression of a person who'd seen the worst. It's a Healer-thing.
cringe and feel half-annoyed with Potter and half-sorry for him when he doesn't see when he is being a third wheel. I can't say I mind that much though. Caught up in each other, Weasley and Granger don't pay me much attention. Their distracted indifference is better than their hostility.
I squint at him. "Why are you doing this, Potter?"
"No." I put my glass down.
He rocks me by the shoulders, and I finally obey, rocking along with him.
, okay?” I snap. “I do have an elf of my own, thank you. I can summon him any time.”
I laugh, and he laughs with me, and we're laughing, only able to stop when the teacher suddenly says over us:
"Thank you, Kreacher."
"No, my boy. From now on, you should try and do your best to make it work. It is essential that you succeed."
"Kreacher know things."
I don't want to think. Don't want to remember. Your lean figure flying black against the icy disc of the Moon. Black night. Black waters of the Black Lake. Your hair and snow - white. Black and white. Black and white.
"Yes, if you don't mind." I sit down next to Harry, and he takes my hand under the table.
She touches the inside of my wrist with her fingertips lightly, just above the place where Father's band had left its mark, and I feel a faint thrum of her magic flowing beneath my skin, mingling with my very blood.
"Come on, you can't possibly be
Henry nodded, looking around. The room with a single bed was simple but nice. It looked like any room in any random decent hotel.
"Go on... go
That's what this is.
His gaze makes you uneasy. What is the guy up to? For the last few days, you've been bumping into him a lot. At first, you thought it was an accident. Now, you don't think so; not at all. Is the man hitting on you, or what? You should probably report him, otherwise he may get you into trouble. You don't want your flawless record spoiled, do you?
I glance at his back, feeling oddly grateful that he's allowing us this moment of privacy.

"Wow," was all I could manage. I had lived there for years, but it felt as though I was seeing my own house for the first time.

There are applause and cheers and it seems like whatever has been going on there is over.
"They wanted to ransom me to my Father. The Order needed gold, they said."
I say irritably.
"Let go!
The papers then had gone viral:
She is all no-nonsense and treats me politely, though there
What the fuck had come over me?
For the next week, Malfoy and I talk very little. Our routine is the same, as though nothing has changed. To me, it feels like everything has. For the worse.
"Turn off the lights." My voice cracks. I wipe the wetness in the corner of my eye. I don't want him to see my face.
"As long as it takes," Potter says, "you may stay here for as long as it takes."
I have no idea what he is talking about, it hardly makes any sense; it sounds wrong, and I don't have a chance to ask him. I want to shout, demanding to lift this fucking spell so that I can finally breathe and... I try, but... I try and try and try...
"Yes."
I touch the keys, feeling, rather than hearing, the living room around me exhale.
When did you ever?
"Okay, come in, then." I throw the door open. "I'm going to get dressed." I turn around, heading to pick my clothes from the armchair.
the heavy splash of Potter's feet against the sand eats up the distance in no time.
"I'm so honoured."
Her dirty face is contorted in pain; her hair is a nest, loose braid hanging over her shoulder.
I don't think I remember him wearing anything short-sleeved, even on the hottest of days in early September, when Quidditch practice first began for the season. Unlike the rest of us, he was always clothed to the brim, buttoned up, and was never seen taking his jersey off. In the locker room and showers, he always entered the stall with his shirt on and emerged nearly fully dressed. Of course it made sense.
"No, stop," I say weakly,
" Potter asks. "It's not a
I must ask Dean first.
Every night after dinner I hurry to my room to sit on the windowsill and wait for his owl to arrive. We share the dorm with Ron, but after dinner time he usually hangs out with Hermione, which serves me just fine. Once he asked whose owl it was. I said it was from the Prophet, offering me to be interviewed for Halloween. It sounded stupid, but I couldn't come up with a better excuse so quickly. I wrote Noir that my roommate was being overly curious about our letters, so we had to stop for the night. It was yesterday.
"Of course, Harry Potter!"
Harry, never taking my eyes off him. McGonagall puts her hand on his shoulder and lets go. Harry runs to the door with Weasley and Granger in tow.  I dash through the crowd after the three of them, when McGonagall suddenly blocks my way.
It wants me to put it on, I realise. I probably shouldn't. I’d better not. The thing is vile, the thing is dangerous… But it’s so beautiful. It’s just a locket… a pretty thing… I glance at Harry over my shoulder. What harm would be in that? He doesn't need to know. I shake the chain out of my fingers and take it with both hands, pulling it over my head.
"Wow!"
We're sat at the library desk across from each other, a pile of books between us.
. What a pleasant surprise." His voice drips with acid.
"Don't!" Malfoy yelps, shuffling on his knees backwards.
"I wanted to apologise."
of this place any time soon. Making up a bunch of bullshit was nothing, nothing at all.
"He's got your days and nights, too." Your lips would ghost just above my ear. "Is there anything you’re not telling me?"
The door creaks. “Hi! How are you?” She doesn’t enter the room.
His face falls.
“Healer Musgrove is not your master. Now shut up and bring me my vials.”
We sit.
I find his hand over the blanket. The murmur of voices resumes around us as though nothing has happened. And nothing has, really, it's just the two of us in one bed, with our heads close.
“Do you think she’s beautiful?”
"All of it?" Her voice was cautious.
"You were just thrilled she didn't outright kick me out, yeah?" You shrugged my hand off your shoulder. "Nothing could be wrong even though she denied me even the most basic respect."
, tearing my world in two, turning my life into
I don't ask what it is and why it must be destroyed. They won't tell me. The only thing I gathered is that this is the item they ambushed the Ministry for and nearly got captured. After a whole day of futile attempts, they finally quit.
“Can’t or won’t?” He catches my other hand.
Fuck, no.
"Look what we have here," Malfoy says from the fireplace.
Last night flares vividly in my memory: Malfoy's hot breath on my skin, our fervent kisses, me clinging to him like a drowning man, groping for the last hope. Our frantic release in the dark, though we barely knew what we were doing... My face grows hot.
"For fuck's sake!" you growled. "Would you just let me breathe? Everyone wants something from me at work. And then my mother wouldn't stop… it doesn't matter. Can I have a moment of peace at home?"
"Maybe next time," he said, planting kisses over my chest and stomach, all the way down, until his lips touched my aching cock. He bore down and pulled back and sucked and did it all over again. I gripped his hair, holding on for dear life, until everything rose to the surface, shattering me with joy.
"I said no, Potter." There's a click of the door opening. "Now, come in."
His silhouette retreats, and there's a sound of the opening door. "Come find me when you pull your head out of your arse."
"Malfoy."
Walking up the stairs, I glance back at the room below, at all the people watching, talking, reading my note. Zabini is pulling Malfoy aside, whispering urgently in his ear, and Malfoy is shaking his head.
Still not looking up, Lucius snaps his fingers, and an elf appears in front of him. He gestures at his wife, and the three of them disappear from the hall.
I kiss his nape and between his shoulder blades; I slide lower, pressing my lips down his spine, down to his lower back and all the way up again. He turns his head and reaches out to pull me into a kiss. My cock drags along the cleft of his arse; a gasp escapes me.
"Fucking hell, Harry," she said, "you could have told me long ago."
I don't know what to do now. Dumbledore has left me so many things to accomplish and figure out. But now I see no point. Without him, there is no way I will succeed. Without his command and guidance, without his wisdom and support. He always told me what to do, he was always
The same yesterday, only he lingered longer and sat in a chair by the bed, creaking its back, shuffling his feet.
"Don't be afraid. We love you, Drake!"
"... give it a try."
I get to my feet. "I'm going to bed... I mean,
of him disappearing and reappearing again in front of me.
"Draco," Goyle says, both eager and disappointed, "you found him first."
"Ron... there's a madman on a hunt for me out there, with half of Wizarding Britain at his command," Harry says tiredly. "The other half expects me to save the world, and I have no clue what I'm doing. I may get myself killed any day. Do you think, in the middle of all this, I should give a fuck what people may say when they learn I'm in love with a
condition. Regrettably, Wizards hadn’t found a treatment for it yet. But Muggles have. Muggle ways led you there, Muggle ways will cure you."
I lean against the wall.
Like your love was even there.
"Get up," he says into my navel.
My heart still hammering, we head down the steps. "Thanks."
"Isn't that what you want Weasley, me to fuck off?" I added. "Anyway, where the hell would I go?" That was the end of it.
"We know it is," Weasel supplies. "What the hell? You said he was dead."
The water is hot, my tears are hot, I don't bother to wipe them away.
Harry props himself up on his elbow. "What do you mean?"
I already said so." There's a familiar pang of annoyance that used to lace my interactions with Malfoy.
She is small, the top of her head barely reaches your chin. She is tilting her face up to meet your eyes. She is funny and smart, and very pretty. She's a lesbian, 17, carted off by her parents to this place.
"Hi," Potter says curtly and pulls his jumper over his head.
Reaching out, I place my finger at the base of his throat, sliding it down and down, until it reaches his belt and stops.
"What's this?" I ask, though I think I already know. There were rumours, and once I witnessed it myself in the third year, though I didn't know what I was seeing.
The whistle blows, and I am in the air, staring daggers with Malfoy. Wind is messing up his hair, making it flutter and stand on end above his forehead. The colour is burning high on his cheekbones. He has that odd, a bit feverish look on his face, as though he's over-excited about something, trying not to show it. I don't think I've ever seen him like this.
He doesn't hate his father. Lucky boy.
The hand grips my wrist and lets go, his touch is too weak and feeble, but it is enough for me to look up. He lies in a pool of blood, but his chest is clean.
How had you even allowed him to do this to you? Why didn't you throw him off? Why didn’t you fight back? Why didn't you kill him on the spot, as soon as you realised that he’d put Amortentia into your Firewhisky? Why had he done it in the first place? When you liked him... and even more? When you trusted him enough to feel safe in his presence...
"Come in!" He called, when you knocked on the door of his study.
The moment is broken, he gets to his feet, leaving me sitting on the floor. My heart suddenly racing, I lean back against the foot of the bed.
"You are a fucking blind idiot, Potter!" Someone shouts.
I glance at the clock on the wall: a quarter to eight. I have no idea what may happen, or may not. Would I even be able to feel it? To feel

something between us. I thought he probably felt it, too.
"I know," I say.
My hand stills.
The music abruptly stops to the dismayed voices of people around.
and pull back again, and repeat, repeat,
"What?" I turn to him from my spot on the carpet, where I've been lounging with a book.
"The light?" He approaches.
"Kreacher don't have a self-writing quill. Kreacher is purchase it if Master need."
Some people are dressed up in every fancy costume imaginable, others are not. I am not. Didn't feel like it. I'm having a good time anyway.
I'm so lonely.
- not 'with us.'
I know before I know it: Ron and Hermione are doing it for everyone to see.
"Alright." Ron frowned.
Someone whistles, someone laughs.
Descending the main staircase on my way to breakfast, I realise people are whispering.
The Dark Lord claps, and everyone joins the applause.
The remaining Death Eaters scrumble on their feet and dash out of the Great Hall; no one tries to stop them. The Order, the students, the teachers stare into space. Until a woman's wail rises to the ceiling, and I see Weasley's mother kneeling over the body of a red-haired man.
Mother's hand at the small of my back steadies me. I avert my face, my gaze sliding over people around the hall. I won't listen. If I could press my hands to my ears and stop hearing... I can't. I'll just look away and won't listen. My eyes drift along the wall... to the left, where there is no one there, just the open doorway with the spiral staircase to the dungeons. They dragged Harry down there and threw him into a cell and... Tonight, when everyone is asleep, I'll sneak down there and figure something out. I don't have the key, but surely there must be a way...
All bothered and hot
“No…” He says slowly. “She’s not?...”
"Actually…" he clears his throat. "I spent the entire summer shutting myself up in the library. I avoided the
I see a tuxedo jacket hanging off the back of the armchair. Very likely it's not mine, I don't remember hanging it. I’m in my shirt and trousers, and my glasses are on the carpet under the sofa - he said he had put them there. But I can't reach them now. Draco's head is a heavy weight on my arm, and Merlin's tits - we'd fallen asleep in our shoes. He is tucked into me on his side, and I am smashed against the back of the sofa.
it, if that makes any sense.
"No... you may sit down, but... would you just... remain where you are?"
Without a word, he sits down and starts retrieving his things from the bag.
I shrug. She nods.
"Come here."
"Those are his clothes." She gestured weakly with her head in the direction of the staircase.
"Okay, guys," Parkinson said cheerfully, "who's down for a round of Spin the Bottle?"
How do I know?
"Okay, then…" I push myself off the floor and stand up.
You touched the glistening handle, ran your fingertips along the worn leather of the seat. The touch echoed in my guts. Raised goosebumps over my skin. I swallowed.
"What?!" He asks, bewildered.
"Hi." His voice is hoarse, but it's
I do.
"There isn't!" Bellatrix in the front row ardently presses her hands to her chest.
skinny and frail, I've just never thought of it until now. The bright moonlight from the window makes his hair glow silver. Like a ghost. It's unsettling.
I stare at her. "Where's?.."
"It's stupid," he replies.
Longbottom cuts him off. "I'd like to say something."
I yell at the top of my lungs, trying to peer around Granger. She shoves me in the chest.
"What do you mean alone?" He closes the door. "Who else would there be?"
"How's Father?" I ask.
...over the glimpse of white skin where the shirt is parted and along the long column of his neck, which is decorated with some weird glittering pattern (or is it a trick of the light?)...
"You wear the Dark Mark." He points at my arm. "Vo... You-Know-Who's Mark. You made a big mistake, yes."
"Excuse me?
"Sorry." I stand up. "I need to..."
I run my thumb over his cheekbone, down his face and along the edge of his jaw, until, sliding up his chin, it stops at his lower lip.
at the time.
We finally stop, there's a swoosh of the door opening.
"Sorry, sorry!" Henry springs to his feet. "I forgot, I'm new here. Sorry!"
"You did it!" I turn to him.

"Good night," he says.
An eternity had passed before she finally pulled back to look up at you with a frown.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't..."
Not like that. Not
"Spin the bottle?" I ask, sitting down, because

Never in my life did I think
"And so should you." He grins.
"Er... would we just... sit?" I gestured to the fireplace. "Or..." I waved at the staircase, not sure what I was going to suggest. Or what?
"You are dismissed," I say, and the man retreats to take his place in the semi-circle.
When I told him and Hermione about Zabini, Ron was threatening to kill the fucker.
"Come on!" He pushes me towards the centre of the room, where people are sitting in circle.
but I'm staring anyway, feeling my guts turning over.
"No homo," I repeated solemnly, and we burst out laughing.
The wall explodes, and when the debris settle, there is a huge hole in the place where the door should have been. Granger directs her broom and disappears through it, Harry and I follow, and Weasley with a roaring Goyle is behind us.
"Nice to meet you, too," said the woman with a beer bottle in her hand. All eyes were on me.
"Harry, spin it!" Dean says. "Let's see who next you'll put a spell on!"
We wrestle, and my wand clatters against the floor; I am no match for him. Goyle grabs a fistful of my hair and drives my head into the wardrobe. Stars bloom before my eyes as my temple hits the hard wooden edge. I try to throw him off, but he grips me by the throat and squeezes.
"Why would I deny it? You know it's true," I say, "and what would Noir think of me, if I did?"
He frowns. "Harry? Do you--"
"Do you want your hair cut? I'll summon the elf."
I think about Malfoy's tentative peck, his body even not touching mine. About his palms - steady and gentle - holding my face, tilting it up just so. About his smell assaulting my senses, about my helpless stupor and wild heart. I even briefly regret I didn't kiss him back. Well, that's fucked up. He wouldn't want that.
"I'm starving," she says, hugging me around the waist, "come on."
"How do you know, Harry?!" Weasel rises to his feet.
enclosed in the circle between the dragons chasing each other. And in the right top corner:
"I know, I know," I repeat again and again.
"Yes... I do... I do," the guys in the centre repeat with their heads bowed.
"Watch it!" He snaps, his breath sudden on my cheek. "You could've broken your neck." His arms around me are suddenly gone, and his hand grips me firmly above the elbow. He briefly bends down and straightens up again. "I've got your bag. Come on."
I don't know what to do, how it's properly done. All I want is to press myself into him and
Harry had said,
I don't know how long it takes, probably just a few seconds, but for me the moment is dragging, making me uncomfortable. I don't know how to behave around Malfoy. He still annoys me to no end, but what had once been is no longer there. Our ire burned out, our vitriol faded. We've both been through too much to still commit to the childish rivalry.
She turns.
Both of you! I'm fed up with your conspiracy, with your-"
now it feels like I've been suffocating all this time when he was away.
"Thank you. You may go."
"Where would you rather go?" Potter asks from the doorway. "Your Father will grab you as soon as you set foot outside. Without magic..."
“I think I’m going to go to bed,” I say, tripping over a book on the floor. “Fuck!”
"What are you doing?"
I know.
"No, really, Malfoy. Stay." I tugged at your arm, pulling you to lie back down next to me.
We both know what you mean.
Just not with guys.
Resuming my way up, I really can’t be arsed to reply, it’s most definitely the potion. Good.
"He'd done a shitty thing," I say, "but that’s what Slytherins do."
"Lucius, come." I beckon at the kneeling man, his blond hair tied at his nape with a black ribbon. "Rise, my friend, and be pardoned."
"I told him that Theo had made it all up, but he wouldn't listen... He said you admitted it to be true. Draco, why?.."
I go cold.
“Yes.”
I shake my head.
His face black with soot, he looks mad, totally mad. I'm sure my face doesn't differ much.
Harry comes forward. From this spot, I only see his back: unruly black hair gathered in a loose bun, his grey hoodie - the very one he was wearing when I saw him for the last time. The broad square set of his shoulders... the frame of his glasses glints against his temple as he turns his head... My throat aches. I can't breathe.
I caught the earlobe between my teeth, he whined - it went like this… We kissed and talked and kissed again.
I've never touched him like this before.
My life.
This is the news I have yet to break to him: I'm leaving tomorrow. I've been waiting by the Floo in the living room for his return.
Finally done with the belt, I sit on the bed and bend down to find my shoes. I put them on and fumble with the laces. Will do. I reach for the pile and pick a tie up. Shit. I hold it in my hand.
The area is devoid of human presence - Granger checked thoroughly. We've made our camp in a forest, near a small mountain river.
You could tell he was staring. You didn't need to look. You never missed the electric touch of his gaze, the prickling it sent over your skin each time he secretly watched you. You cherished it in silence, holding close to your heart this secret joy, this knowledge—or maybe hope?—that there was a reason behind his stolen glances. You never told him, never let him know, lest he denied it, taking it away from you.
"No, um… I mean, it's fine. Suit yourself. I'll manage."
“I’m not apologising. You could've broken your neck - alone - on one of these moving staircases.”
"Who?" Father finally releases me.
"Fucking
"Malfoy." I catch up with him, keeping up with his stride. He says nothing.
I have no choice.
"Give me a few minutes, mate."
"What did he tell you? What were you going to do once you let them in?" I ask.
We wouldn't notice the time until we'd be late for dinner.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No!”
“Yes.”
I turn.
He takes me by the arm. "Potter, listen... hear me out."
"Stay still," he says, fumbling with my hair. "Okay."
"They are not." Granger shakes her head. "It's only a children's book, Ron."
“Harry!” He claps me on the shoulder. “Here, sit down, mate.” His hand takes mine, pulling me down on the sofa next to him. Hermione snuggles at my other side.
“Would you mind if I… sat with you?”
I know he’s here a moment before he says anything. There’s the
"Yes, Harry Potter. Dobby understand. Dobby remember."
He nods, and his smile is a bit awkward, but you know perfectly well when he is content with his play.
We hovered in place as I dismantled the wards over Grimmauld, letting us land in the back garden.
"How can I have a crush on her, you dimwit?! I've never even seen her!"
"I see," his voice falls flat, "I'd better go."
Harry is good,
"Such a thing will never happen again, right?"
"I don't know... it’s never happened to me before," I reply, staring into my cup.
Did she touch it, too, while he was asleep? Following her into the hall, your thoughts were oddly detached. Did she trace her fingertips over the slender lines of the flower the same way you did?
that night felt real, though. I tried not to show how much I enjoyed it."
"Maybe you're right." I stand up. "Meet you there, guys, I have to pick something in the dorm."
the actual name of the gay-conversion therapy institution, which operated in the USA, and where Jared (the protagonist of the film ‘Boy Erased’), and Garrard Conley (the author of the novel ‘Boy Erased: A Memoir’, based on the real life events) had been sent to by their religious parents.
You'd take me to bed.
"We... I couldn't wear it anymore," he doesn’t meet their eyes, "so I kept it tucked away. And still... it attacked me and... Draco, too."
Next morning, Malfoy comes to pick me up as usual. We never mention the party or the kiss again, though I think about it all the time. Not about Romilda or Susan or anyone, though with them it was great.
"Protego Totalum, Muffliato, Repellum Muggletum, Celario!" I run around, casting protective spells. Harry is shaking all over.
"You were right, she's beautiful." I look in her wake.
With his kind eyes on that utterly

"My Lord!" She scrambles on her feet, outraged. "Let me-"
"Yeah, I… I saw you," he says, "I remember."
"Yes." The disfigured locket lies on the ground and the sword of Gryffindor gleams near it. Weasley pulls the thing up by its chain. "It's gone. It's empty." He wipes his eyes.
"I mean it." Her face was grim. "I know a lot has changed since... but... It's
"You are crushing me," he says.
"I don't mind."
He peers at me from under windswept hair.
“Can’t say the same about you, and it’s not a compliment to your learning abilities, believe me.”
"Alright?" I ask.
I want to say 'Hi' and... I forget what I want to say because I see Malfoy point his wand at the locket dangling off the chain in his hand.
His whole body was trembling. "Yes."
I ask dumbly.
I feel sick.
"Yes!" He grabs my wrist. "I told McGonagall, and she lowered the wards on your door."
Unable to hold it back anymore, I bite my lip and turn away to hide my crumpling face from Potter. I begin walking along the water, quickly picking up pace. Only when I think the distance between us is safe enough do I dare to wipe my eyes.
"Healer Musgrove is tell, Master is not drink more than one vial a day.”
came out. When I saw you that day in the Great Hall, it didn't seem funny anymore. It was fucking terrifying." His gaze roams over my face, searching for mercy I don't have. "I feel awful."
Feeling nothing, I glance down, see nothing and look up into the mirror again, bringing my hand to my flaming chest. Fire springs from my fingertips, sending sparks into my glasses. I flinch and stagger backwards, my feet setting the rug aflame.
