“I won’t, I swear I won’t!” Harry is desperate for Malfoy to believe him. It’s a bit ridiculous, to freak out over a little kiss, but Malfoy looks like his is about to shatter into a thousand pieces, only held together by the slippery slope of pride.
safe, and that they are peacefully sleeping. He remembers that his house hates him and that he woke to someone actually screaming right now and not just a nightmare.
Draco knows Grimmauld (and to some extent, its inhabitants) is important to his mother. He never quite understood it, not until recently.
Weasley and Granger behind him have gone silent, a new tension to the air. They heard it too, then. Draco didn’t think he was imaging it, not for a moment, but he is relieved to have them by his side regardless. Just because all this is happening in Potter’s mind, doesn’t mean wounds can’t get grisly. From Draco’s experience, there are no worse monsters than those conjured up by frightened minds.
“You mean if you were to, totally theoretically, devote all your life and being to a self-sacrificing moron and keep both denying and cursing that route your foolish heart has taken?” Theo asks, pointedly not looking at Draco and idly swirling his drink.
His head aches, pounding against his skull and laying thick on his tongue, coating everything in fuzz and heavy thumps.
It should be easy, compared to some other rescues. The villain doesn’t see him, too busy looking scary to consider himself vulnerable, something trivial that couldn’t possibly apply to himself. He believes himself victor already, thinks himself invincible. It’s this very arrogance that paints the target on his back—literally, in this case—but once you are this far gone you don’t think about such things anymore. It’s not
The real problem is this: when two bodies that hold on to each other fall to the ground, it’s logically inevitable that they should land in a similar state to how they fell, closely connected and touching. Harry and Draco did. They landed in a mess of limbs and with no coordination to speak of, Draco lying fully on top of Harry, who is blinking up at him, arms tight around Draco’s ribs and pulling him further down, closer. His eyes are wide, and there is something suggestive in the curve of his lip, in the way his hands start moving over Draco.
Blaise is worried about him, they all are. Maybe worried isn’t the right word; Draco is hardly in any danger, nothing compared to what they all went through the last few years. There is absolutely no reason to be concerned.
“I won’t pretend not to be delighted at the prospect of stepping foot into that house again, it has always been beautiful and I shudder to think of what has become of it …” She trails off, lost in memories.
“That is a little more metaphorical than the other times, isn’t it?” Draco vastly preferred the scenes where he could charge in and beat down a few wolves to save Potter. This doesn’t feel nearly as heroic.
“Harry Potter, nothing would make me happier.” Draco hopes that Potter doesn’t realise it’s the truth.
Draco is a reasonable man, though—no really, don’t laugh—and he settled a price so simple, Granger almost didn’t accept for fear of it being a trap. A favour, that’s all Draco asked for, a favour from Potter. Weasley had grit his teeth and muttered about devious snakes and debts Draco allegedly owed, but Granger agreed and here Draco stands, staring at Potter’s frail body laying in a bed too big for him.
“Malfoy agreed to fake being in love with me so Grimmauld will make an effort to be nicer.” That’s the closest Harry can come to an apology. He hopes it’s good enough.
Potter should have woken up by now. He should have followed them, should ideally have woken right along with them but not more than five minutes after them.
Harry offers him all he yearns for, presented on a silver plate and waiting for Draco’s approval. Draco wants it so much it hurts, wants to reach out and take it all, without looking back.
He should have. Pansy smiling is rarely a good thing, and, looking back, that was more of a smirk than a smile, which is even more dangerous. But Draco never seems to learn, and he doesn’t pay it any mind, too intent on his escape for suspicions.
“What you need, Potter,” Draco whispers, low in the tiny amount of space between them, “is to go skydiving.”
“What is it you are saying, Potter?” Draco asks, because he won fair and square and he wants ice cream.
So there you have it, that is their ridiculous plan, reduced to its bare essentials. They are doomed, aren’t they?
Pansy doesn’t bother asking if he is sure, if they are safe and vaccinated and if they are tame at all, she goes straight ahead to pick the squirming thing up. It’s always odd, realising how much Pansy loves animals. It doesn’t fit their proud heritage of dignity and superiority at all. Not that that ever stopped her from doing as she pleases, sneaking in books on magical creatures and refusing to wear anything with fur (she cites an allergy, which is a weak excuse but miraculously never provoked any further questions. She would skin alive anyone, other than her parents, for daring to suggest she wears fur, because it’s horrifying and heartbreaking and let’s see how
Although, that’s not what that expression is. Harry saw Malfoy afraid plenty of times: surrounded by fire in the Room of Requirement; in third year, when Harry played that prank and made him and his gorillas think he was a dangerous ghost from the Shrieking Shack; even in sixth year, in that bathroom, clutching the sink and desperately searching a solution in the mirror, but finding only himself, alone. Harry knows what fear looks like on Malfoy’s face, and there is not even a hint of it anywhere to find.
“You can’t just vanish my things! That couch was very important to me!” Potter flicks up from his grumpy slouching so fast that the blanket falls off his shoulders, his eyes blazing with a new intensity. Forget what Draco said about glaring daggers,
Harry narrows his eyes at them. It’s a rather small chair, you see, not for one person sure but if it were big enough for two people (even people bony as Draco and Parkinson) they would hardly call it an armchair, would they? The chair is small and it was just fine for Draco alone but with
him scheme, pushing around furniture in his mind and replacing everything that was lugged in here in an effort to make it homier with ostentatious, over-priced and soulless equivalents. Grimmauld will be delighted, Harry is sure. At least that means he gets to see Malfoy sweat trying to figure out how to get a couch through the floo (Harry remembers that day, he remembers pushing, pulling and cursing and the couch not moving an inch, stuck and unmovable. He doesn't remember how they finally got it through, but he is sitting on it proudly now and if Malfoy wants to get rid of it he has to throw Harry out right along with it.)
Ron looks like he considers obliviating himself. Honestly, Harry can’t fault him for that, he wished the same often enough. It’s no use though, Harry can’t stop thinking about Malfoy, how prim and proper and elegant he is and all the filthy things Harry wants to do to him. Not since Malfoy brought up sex, that is, Harry was perfectly fine (or convincingly pretending to be, at least) before Malfoy told him they would need to have sex. Harry had somehow forgotten about that minor detail. Consummate the marriage, he had said, blushing in splotchy flecks of crimson. Harry had wondered how far down that blush goes before he could stop himself, and his mind had gone rampant and frolicking through a garden of lust and fornication.
that Harry imagined in his plan, of spouse and friend and someone to raise children with and invite the neighbours over for barbecue. Malfoy is, well, none of these things. Except spouse, or soon to be spouse.
, and he was too scared to ask his friends, but some of the things Parkinson talked of must have been true. Things concerning Ron, specifically, like the claim that he acted as mediator between Parkinson and Hermione. That, too, Harry can believe all too easily. He just doesn’t see why Hermione would ever want to talk to Parkinson after a fight bad enough Ron needed to stop it.
Sure, first names are wonderful in the cover of the dark, but daylight has a way of exposing flaws and downsides with uncompromising honesty. Fantasies rarely live long in the day, no matter how far they reach in the night, and Draco was sure it would be the exact same with any progress they might have made in that nebulous space.
who gets trapped by the clause he wishes he never added it; it does seem a bit far fetched. That might just be why Weasley let Potter sign them, come to think of it.
“You think? Show me then!” Draco shoves Potter at the dishwasher to present him with that wondrous solution.
Draco will be prepared next time. He will wear his stoicism like armour and anything Potter might say will shatter against it.
“I can’t really talk about open cases, sorry.” Harry gave him an apologetic look as he closed his notebook, tucking it into his back pocket. There really wasn’t anything to tell, anyway, but he knew better than to open those floodgates with a victim’s family member, estranged or not.
Harry allows himself to get lost in the kiss, even as his aching cock presses into Draco’s hip looking for pressure and release. After a long moment, Draco roughly pulls one of Harry’s knees, wedging his folded leg between their bodies. Harry relishes the stretch and the burn of his muscles as they relax into the new position. He’s not as limber as he used to be, but it’s perfect—rough and desperate, Draco taking what he wants.
Harry hears him whisper an incantation and looks up to see the feather moving on its own. “Fuck!” He’s far too gone to attempt to suppress his reactions at this point, so he lets himself yell and whine and squirm without holding back. In their playroom, Draco doesn’t expect him to hold back, doesn’t want him to. He wants to hear every moan, every cry and sob, every curse and plea. So Harry lets himself curse and whine, and even a laugh is pulled out of him when the feather hits a particularly ticklish spot.
People passed him laughing, talking with their friends, but no one paid him any attention. He kept his head down, walking a few more streets before finding a phone store. Thankfully, due to his frequent trips to Draco’s pub, he had plenty of Muggle money on him.
“We had a bad batch of sweetener potions going around that were causing all sorts of problems, so we were just taking some precautions that no one ate them,” Malfoy said.
Harry cries out, long ropes of come land on his and Draco’s torso. Draco continues to pound into him as he chases his own orgasm. The drag against Harry’s prostate becomes almost unbearable but he just holds on to Draco tight until Draco cries out, dropping his head on Harry’s chest. He releases Harry’s legs, letting them fall to the side, and collapses on them. Then they lay still, panting and spent.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco moans as he stretches his body, clearly becoming overcome by the stimulation. Harry’s not moving fast or hard enough to make his husband come yet, instead, keeping his motions soft and teasing. He remembers when they’d do this weekly—spending lazy Sundays exploring one another’s bodies.
After only a moment, Draco pulls off, and Harry feels his body sag in relief. But it becomes quickly apparent that Draco is only changing techniques when a hand is wrapped around Harry’s spent cock, pulling and twisting.
He started trembling as the adrenaline seeped out of his veins. He reached into his pocket with a trembling hand for his phone. He struggled to keep his fingers still enough and had to keep backing out of the wrong selections, but eventually he managed to dial Ron. Holding the phone to his ear, he laid back, too tired to stay upright, his head knocking gently on the pavement.
Harry had no idea what that could possibly be and was also afraid to ask. Before she could continue, Minerva stepped to the front of the room.
About half-way down the pitch, the brooms started to slip from Harry’s arms, causing him to pause to rearrange his grip. He hoisted them up, tightening his hold and managed to keep them from tumbling out of his arms until he got to the shed.
“Your armchair, sir,” Harry answered without hesitation. He was too exhausted to stand, but he wanted to see everything, wanted to hold Draco’s head still and slowly fuck into his mouth. His cock twitched, and he took a deep breath. He already wasn’t going to last long, probably shouldn’t get too worked up before they even got started.
Muffled sounds slowly filled Harry’s head as he tried to open his eyes. His eyelids felt as heavy as his limbs as he tried to move. But eventually his body woke up fully, and he blinked awake to see a stark white ceiling over him. As his vision cleared, the smell of spell-cleaned air hit his nostrils, solidifying in his mind that he was in St Mungo’s. The sounds slowly became less muffled, and he started recognising voices.
“Hmmm. I tend to work the hours when most people are out doing non-work things, so mostly I spend time with other restaurant and bar workers. It sounds a bit sad to say it, but we usually just wind up at other restaurants and bars on our days off.” Draco’s eyes crinkled in a smile. “What about you? Lots of Ministry galas and society dinners? I seem to remember you being ‘the wizard to have’ on the guest list when I left.”
Harry cast the Levitation Charm and Edwards gasped out as his body shifted, causing Harry to wince in commiseration, though he trusted that the MLE officer would let him know if it was too much. He kept his wand steady as he moved the man across the room. Harry lowered him slowly to the floor just outside the cage and let Edwards take a moment to settle, as he was clearly in pain.
Harry was easily as happy for Ron as he had been when Hermione had been promoted to the Head of The Department of Magical Creature Rights and Regulation, a department that had undergone some major renovations, primarily spearheaded by her since the war. He felt a deep sense of pride watching her rise through the ranks taking on one project after another, from regulating how potions ingredients were harvested from magical creatures to ensuring house-elves had rights. It was so heartening to see his friends have these good things in their lives.
Ginny shrieked and reached out a hand to hit him on the arm. “Harry! Fucking yes! About goddamn time.”
Instead of flying over to Malfoy, Harry used the pretence of watching the students, half of whom were blatantly ignoring his instructions and dropping the brooms on the grass. Of course, Alder Briarwood was part of that group. As he watched Opal and all her friends do the same, he wondered, not for the first time this week, why he’d even taken this job.
“How did Lucius get killed, by the way?” That particular piece of information was still driving Harry crazy. Even if it was the Markupo, which made the most sense now that they knew one was in the country, he still couldn’t work out how they had got it into Malfoy Manor.
In what feels like an eternity later but is likely only a few minutes, Draco steps in front of Harry, putting a finger under his chin to lift his head. It’s the first good look Harry has got at him since earlier that morning, and Draco looks immaculate in his expensive trousers and crisply pressed white shirt. His sleeves are already rolled up—a sight that Harry’s come to associate with play.
Draco looked at Harry with a smile and leant across the bar to pull him into a kiss. “Happy birthday, love.”
Trelawney blinked several more times, opened her mouth, and then seemed to decide against asking any more questions, instead, leaving in a haste muttering something about irresponsible potions professors.
“We also need to talk to Malfoy again and let him know his alibi checks out. I think I’m going to head out and see if I can talk to him again, maybe he’d also have some ideas about who his father was friends with, maybe long-term acquaintances.” Harry stood to grab his coat. He’d need to pop home and change into different clothes, he realised, remembering the worn t-shirt and baggy khakis he’d thrown on under his robes that morning.
Draco hummed. “This one is a bit more abstract, but it’s about kind of… becoming myself in a way. Like being true to myself.”
In the end, the Head Auror agreed to let them fill out a warrant request, provided that Harry and Mel went in quietly and had a look around themselves before putting together a full team.
Harry shuffled towards Draco’s legs and moved them so that they were bent, knees up with his feet flat on the floor.
He pushed the idea way down and focused on getting out of the Ministry and getting home. From the work schedule they’d got during the interview, Malfoy was at the pub every afternoon and evening except Mondays and Tuesdays.
He knew he was putting additional pressure on himself after several careers not working out. It was starting to become a point of embarrassment for him. This was his fourth attempt at a career and he had only just turned twenty-eight.
“No way. Peeves hasn’t had access to the staff room for decades, not since the knickers incident of ‘88”
“Ah, old friends then?” Ewan asked, visibly relaxing. Draco’s answer seemed to put the man at ease, which Harry found even more irritating.
"Well, that makes things easier,” Draco murmured against his skin, a smile in his voice. “I get to explore all of you now.”
Harry moaned, dropped his head back on Draco’s shoulder, his hair tickling his forearm still pulled back around Draco’s neck. It didn’t take long for his orgasm to build this time, still worked up from the last two wins. He forced himself not to hurry things along, not to buck into Draco’s hand which would definitely not be allowed. He reminded himself that Draco set the pace, Draco was in charge. Heat pooled in his gut and he started to cry out just as the pressure on his cock disappeared. His hips thrust up involuntarily once again, seeking out any form of pressure. The ropes dug into his thighs at the movement. As desperate as he was, Harry would have even taken the edge of the table at that point if he thought he could have got away with it.
“No. That’s fine. I’m sorry I’ve been so pushy; Merlin, I’ve been like my mum, haven’t I?” She groaned and covered her face with her free hand.
Harry walks him backwards to the bed, pulling his husband into a heated kiss as he pushes him down on the bed. Not wanting to wait another minute, Harry flicks his wand to send both their clothes to a pile on the chair in the corner.
Draco can hear the long-suffering sigh of his husband across the room. “Room, now. You two need to learn to work your stuff out.”
Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s messy hair. He knew there was so much to worry about at the moment, but couldn’t find it in him to care about anything outside of that small bedroom in that shitty flat.
“We’re going to try a little pain play,” Draco says as he makes his way back over to Harry. “Nothing too hard with the potion.”
Draco yawned, pressing his face into his pillow and stretching his arms wide. When his arm hit air next to him, though, he propped himself up and looked over to the other side of the bed. Harry and he always spent their Saturday mornings lazing about in bed—sometimes moving on to more energetic pursuits but always waking up together.
Instead of settled, Harry constantly felt this itching just under his skin. Sometimes it was work, sometimes it was just life, but it was this general feeling of unsettledness, the lack of settled, the opposite of whatever Malfoy had.
Draco chuckles as another soft moan escapes Harry as he cups his erection, stroking it through his pyjama bottoms. Unable to stop himself, Harry rocks his hips, pressing his hard cock into Draco’s palm.
Harry turned to tell whoever it was to wait a minute when he heard the rising excitement in the class.
The twins have been going through a phase where they can’t go to sleep. It's often just one twin at a time, really, but the one will keep the other up, and it’s been a nightmare. No one has been sleeping, and Harry’s been too tired to do much beyond fall face first on his bed by the end of the night.
Harry felt his strength coming back and pushed himself up into a seated position, Ron helping him with a firm and steady hand on his back.
Draco nodded minutely, eyes fixated on Harry’s hands, still working at the belt clasp. Harry thought Draco may have stopped breathing, and his ego preened at the thought. He kept his movements deliberate, slowly sliding the belt through the final loop. Unfastening the trousers at an unhurried pace.
And then there was Draco, who loved him and would give him this—would treat Harry if he was no one, unimportant, nothing.
Harry slowly came to consciousness, his body warm and relaxed. As he blinked himself fully awake, he found himself staring at a white wall only a few inches from his face. The events of the previous evening gradually filtered in, their details replacing the morning fog. He sighed and burrowed a little deeper under the warm duvet and closer into Draco’s arm which was slung over him. Draco stirred at the movement and pulled Harry closer. Harry let himself relax against him.
Harry tried to shuffle back but was stopped by a shelf digging into his back. He tugged at his collar; it was so hot.
The phone rang a jingle as it powered on, and Harry saw that he had missed messages. The first was from Ginny; she’d heard what had happened and was worried. Harry shot off a quick reply that he was recovering and would be fine. Underneath, he saw he had quite a few missed messages from Draco. No one knew that Harry had been hanging out with the man, so no one thought to let Draco know something had happened to him.
Another card; Harry got five more strokes. Another and he got four more smacks. It continued in this vein until Harry could no longer tell the difference between pleasure and pain. Everything blended together into a throbbing arousal.
Harry also knew that he’d mellowed over the years. Now that the war was a distant faded memory, the days of not trusting anyone, save Hermione and Ron, were long gone. His career had long stagnated, much to the surprise of the public. It had been widely assumed that it would be only a matter of time until he was Head Auror, but it had become clear early on that even though he could lead in the moment of battle, that strategy, endless meetings, and bureaucracy were not his strengths.
Just as his body starts to thrash involuntarily, Draco pulls back. Harry takes a deep breath through his nose as more tears form and run down his face, down his forehead and into his hairline. He’s grateful that Draco waits long enough for him to get another breath in, letting it out in a noisy exhale before pushing back in.
Harry’s in a mood though, so he simply smiles and keeps up the slow circular motion as he swirls his tongue around the head of Draco’s cock. Usually, this is Draco’s game—the slow teasing and building of desperation—but Harry developed an appreciation for it over the years. Plus, he learned from the best.
Teddy pleaded a bit more, and it took Harry all of his strength to not just agree and stay there forever. He knew that wasn’t actually an option, but he wanted nothing more than to freeze this moment in time.
“Let’s just say getting used socks for Christmas wasn’t out of the ordinary and leave it at that,” Harry replied. It didn’t really hurt anymore. Not in the way it had as a young child. But now, having Teddy in his life, he found himself even angrier that they could have ever treated a child, any child, that way.
“Okay, love. I’m right here,” Harry said soothingly, his hand still a steady presence on Draco’s chest. “Say the word, and I’ll remove it.”
Eventually, it turned into a running joke as Ron started getting irritated by it, which Harry thought might have something to do with his ears turning a bit pink every time Harry used the title. But that only made it more entertaining, so it stuck. So now, several years later, they still only referred to each other by their most formal titles whenever at work except for in the most serious of situations. Some of the other Aurors had even joined in for a bit, as Ron’s promotion had been highly supported by all.
Harry continued to add anything of interest to his pile of possible evidence. He also kept a few otherwise innocuous correspondences to several wix at the Ministry. He was still convinced the man was blackmailing a few people there. Some of the stacks of letters even included Lucius’s original letter, appearing to have been duplicated with a Geminio Charm, given the lack of wax seals or any signs of having been handled by owl post.
“Ah,” Ron said, a smile curving up his lips. “Well, while I didn’t know you were going to quit, none of us actually expected you to accept the position, either. You mind sending Mel in on your way out?”
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could do this. He’d take a step back and figure out where things went wrong with his classes and just plan better.
Harry scooted around and brushed Draco’s hair back off his forehead before looking him up and down. “How’s everything feeling?” He reached around and checked Draco’s hands again.
Once Draco’s fingers are slipping in and out with ease, the copious amounts of lube dripping out of Harry’s hole, Draco slicks himself up with the excess. There’s definitely no need to conjure any more of the stuff; he’s pretty sure there’s a small puddle of it under them at this point. He then lines himself up and pushes in slowly.
Harry fought through the grogginess as best he could and made his way into the hallway. He was surprised to see Auror Naomi Hardy, one of the Junior Aurors, standing guard between his room and Mel’s.
Draco kissed inward, Harry’s body coiling in anticipation, but Draco pulled back, skipping over his hard cock and starting on the other hip. Harry nearly cried. He knew if he asked, Draco would stop and get on with it, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to; he wanted to live in this moment forever. All of his worries long forgotten and his body on fire, the world narrowed to Draco’s bedroom, his small bed, and their bodies.
Draco leant in, pressing his lips to Harry’s, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth. “Okay,” he whispered against Harry’s mouth.
Every reason why this was a bad idea faded to the background, and Harry leant in, his heart pounding.
Harry nodded and took a long drink of his pint. It was pretty depressing, to have fought so hard just for new wizards and witches to pop up and try to restart the whole thing.
“Harry, stop—” Draco stepped back into his space. “I want this. I want you.” He started to reach out for Harry and then hesitated, letting out a wild laugh. “Fuck, I want this. But not tonight.”
Harry tried to push away the thoughts, unable to deal with this crisis at the end of such an awful day. But as he pushed out those thoughts, other ones crept back in—the sickly looking house-elves, the creatures that had all looked so underfed and mistreated, his team crumpled on the ground, Draco… his hands started shaking.
Harry headed to the pantry for his own snack, and, as expected, the yoghurt was once again missing. Harry moved around the food on his shelf and cast an Accio just to be sure, before letting a smile take over his face. It was game time; Harry felt a smile tug at his lips.
“No, no—that’s not… Draco, I think it’s incredibly hot that your greatest desire isn’t just being with me but apparently having hot sex with me.” Harry leaned in and trailed kisses down the side of Draco’s neck. “God, I’ve wanted to do that for so long…”
Harry took off his glasses and pushed his hands in his eyes, his face now completely on fire. “Yes, we’re together.”
It takes longer this time, and Harry can’t feel too upset about that, even with his bollocks in a vice-like grip, as Draco does wonderful things with his mouth.
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat back. Tears started prickling at his eyes. He knew if he tried to talk he’d start crying, so he just shook his head as he tried to blink the tears away.
“I don’t suppose you know where the most recent stuff might be?” Harry asked, taking in the enormity of this task as his eyes scanned the shelves.
Harry still wasn’t thrilled about going to the wizarding district at that moment, but at least that pub was good at keeping out reporters.
Harry huffed a laugh, quietly so as to not wake up Teddy, who was out cold between them. “I suppose we should get this one to bed then.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco closed his eyes as he felt the rope start to wind around his wrists. It was already so good. While not as silky smooth as some of their other ropes, the hemp wasn’t nearly as rough as Draco had expected. But already he could feel the difference—the natural fibres, the lack of give.
Healer Roth rolled her eyes with a smile and started towards the door before stopping and turning to him again. “Be careful out there, okay? This was a close one.”
After a moment of adjustment, they both wrapped their hands around their cocks, Harry’s hand covering Draco’s, and started to move, rocking their bodies as their hands worked their growing erections.
’s been having a field day with this, with all the wild speculations about all the people he has connections to, so people are afraid of this getting tied to their name even just as a rumour. The faster we can close this case, the better.”
“I never enjoyed that stuff. I’ve always hated being the centre of attention, actually,” Harry replied with a huff.
“Okay, if there are no more questions, I’ll call out your name and a colour. These will be your groups for the rest of the term, so remember your colour. Wait until the end to go,” Harry pulled a piece of parchment out of his pocket. “Jacob, blue; Emily, orange; Aaron, purple; Henry, white.”
“No, I think we have it,” Mabel, one of the Hufflepuff students answered, before demonstrating the lift-off and landing. Harry watched her, nodding.
When they made it to the station, Draco handed Harry a spare ticket. And Harry couldn’t help but wonder if he’d planned for it on the way over, as he watched Draco deftly navigate the station and hold up an Oyster card to get to the trains. He wondered if he’d ever get used to this version of the man, so similar in some ways—the dramatics while storytelling, the need to be involved in things, a bit snarky and cutting with his humour—and yet still so different.
Draco pulled back slowly. “Let me know if you need me to slow down or stop at any point, okay?” He pushed back in, bottoming out with a groan. “We can stop at any time.”
Harry then cast a protective dome over the pile of brooms, ensuring they stayed put until he was back. Even second-year students could likely dismantle that particular charm, but he was banking on the first-years not having any real spell knowledge yet.
He vaguely remembered Draco leaving and something about the Floo. With a start, the memories flooded in, and he rolled over to see Hermione and Ron sitting in Transfigured chairs on the other side of the study. Hermione appeared to be deep in one of Harry’s reference books on defence magic, and Ron was reading his latest
Draco wanted to protest further but curiosity won out. Plus, he loved presents. He unwrapped the silver paper and then opened the plain brown box to find a sizable bundle of blue rope. While the colour was gorgeous—a deep ocean blue—they had plenty of rope, a whole drawer-full, actually. Draco looked up, confused.
“Right now, I don’t think anything. But we need to go through all possibilities. The wards show no signs of being tampered with or blasted through. And he’s the only person other than you who has access to the Manor. We need to check. Do you know where we can find him?”
Malfoy wiped his eyes and took a deep breath, eyes still crinkled from laughing. “You think I’m stealing your yoghurt because I don’t want you to work here? I can’t—” He burst out laughing again.
Harry smiled. “Do you want to make breakfast with me? We can heat up one of those breakfast casseroles and cut up some fruit.”
While Harry felt better knowing that they had a plan, he couldn’t help the simmering panic of knowing that someone at work had tried to kill them. It had been a long time since he’d had to wonder who he could trust, and Harry had to say, he hadn’t missed the feeling.
Draco must have picked up on the tension because he sighed and set his mug down. “I know I didn’t treat house-elves well when I was a child. I can’t fix that now, but I do know that, Harry. And now when I understand slightly more about Muggle history, I started to understand how shit the whole setup was…”
Harry pushed himself back from his desk, the chair loudly scraping the wood floor. Draco looked up, and Harry felt his face warm before he muttered something about using the loo and then hurried out of the office, pretending not to notice the grimace on Draco’s face.
Harry thinks he might make a sound, but he doesn’t even know anymore. The adrenaline is wearing off, and he can do little more than lay limply in his restraints with the support of the levitation spell.
“Sorry, wait. Are you telling me you’d be dead if you weren’t so bloody powerful?” Draco gestured at him, eyes wide.
They both stepped back, sliding an arm around one another’s waists as they turned to the mirror. Harry’s mirror image was still taking his time, unbuttoning Draco’s shirt one at a time.
“Mr Malfoy,” Harry read aloud. “We would like to sincerely apologise that you found our renovated restaurant to be less than sufficient for your tastes. We did not intend to offend your sensibilities with our new tasting menu and understand that you found our inclusion of chips drizzled in truffle sauce to be ‘catering to the lowest classes.’ Please accept this invitation to our private room on a night of your choosing. Our chef would be happy to put together a personalised experience.”
Ron grimaced. “Let’s talk to Higgins and Perry first, and then maybe the Ministry prosecutor before we make any decisions there.”
Harry nodded. “And it worked so much better. And your idea about the stronger students helping the weaker ones worked well, so thank you for that.”
“Understood. We’ll pull together what we can about the timeline for Foxley—when they dated, when they broke up—see how that might line up with Isabelle George’s schedule,” Harry said.
Harry grasped the sheets on either side of himself, straining at the need to touch his cock and find his release, desperation clawing at him.
“Eh—I think I might need some help, but I don’t mind if you have to levitate me,” Edwards said. “Whatever needs to be done.”
“Dead,” he repeated. “He’s—I mean, we don’t, we haven’t…” Malfoy started to turn a sickly shade of greyish green.
“Don’t go feeling so bad for me, Harry,” Draco said, cocking a smile. “Sure, when I finally refused, he yelled a whole bunch of homophobic slurs and threw me out, but my life is infinitely better than it would have been. In every way, really.”
Harry leant back over, pressing a soft kiss on Draco’s lips, before turning to his wardrobe and pulling out a clean Auror robe and his usual jeans and t-shirt combo that he wore underneath.
Harry looked at the innocent-looking flowers again and shuffled just a little closer to Malfoy and away from the plants.
He gently nudged a few of the brooms so that they were all standing upright from where they leaned against the rough-wood wall and, with nothing more to do, turned and locked up the shed.
Draco huffed a laugh. “Yes, well. I would have thrown a tantrum if you’d thrown out the rest of that melted chocolate also.”
Eventually though, spent as Harry is, his cock starts to very slowly stir back to life. He feels a growing warmth; the tingling arousal starts to build. It’s not all at once, but Draco is nothing if not diligent in his work. Harry wonders for a fleeting moment if Draco’s arm is getting sore. But soon, his thoughts are brought back in focus. And too soon, his cock starts to ache in its need to come.
After landing in the street, he could sense that the area in front of his home was still under enough repelling charms that he couldn’t approach it. Finding himself unable to care about ruining the crime scene, Harry raised his wand and started to dismantle the Auror wards and repelling spells, one after another. They had more than enough evidence to put every one of those arseholes away for life. The Dark magic attack on his house was barely a drop in the bucket. Eventually, he’d dropped all the wards except the Muggle-repelling charms.
He hears one of them huff and then melodramatic foot stomps from both of them slowly becoming quieter before a door slams.
She put her hand on his knee bringing his focus back. “Hey. You’re safe here, you know? No one is going to judge you here, not for being gay, not for being in the closet, not for being a cop,” she added with a smirk. “None of it.”
“Shut up. That’s not the point.” Draco sat back stiffly in his chair as his cheeks flushed—finally deep enough for Harry to notice through his now tan skin. So, maybe he wasn’t entirely unaffected, Harry thought.
Draco nods faintly and in the back of his mind is grateful that his husband can keep his head in a crisis. The front of his mind is only filled with horrible thoughts of his injured cock. Eventually, with some help from Harry, Draco manages to get dressed, whimpering as his still throbbing, inflamed cock is jostled slightly as he fastens his trousers.
“Thanks.” Harry finished off his pint. He’d need to drink water at the Dragon’s Lair if he didn’t want to be totally pissed before dinner. Grabbing his coat and bag, he hugged Ginny as she stood up.
“How many times do you think you can come, Harry?” Draco asks as he moves his hand to Harry’s other nipple, continue the slow torture. “How many times until you are dry? Until you’ve got no come left?”
“Excellent,” Draco said, leaning back in and chasing away any of Harry’s residual feelings of sadness.
Harry propped himself up again, watching as Draco kissed down his calves all the way to his feet, gently pressing a kiss to the arch of his foot.
“So impatient,” Draco says breathily as he bottoms out. He leans in and trails kisses down Harry’s neck before starting a slow pace while Harry adjusts.
“Absolutely,” Mel replied, a smile full of care and a little sadness curving on her lips. “Okay. Now get out of here.”
Harry laughed. “You’re right on that one. I’ll tell you what. What if we dip some strawberries in chocolate as a treat. We can have one each.”
“You think you can come like this?” Draco leans in to whisper in his ear. “Do you think you can still come just on my cock after all these years?”
A scraping noise pulled him back to the present. Draco walked across the room, pouring himself a cup of tea from the charmed tea service that continually refilled itself. The plug in Harry’s arse settled down, shrinking in size and slowing to a low vibration.
Minutes passed as Harry stared at his screen, waiting for a reply, the lump in his throat growing the longer he waited.
“You’re the one that wanted it here. I tried to remind you of the mess this lot made last time you decided to host a party here.”
But he’s trapped, at Draco’s mercy to do with as he pleases, so Harry can do nothing more than wait for it and react. He huffs and yelps, tries to squirm away, but it’s no use. And once Draco’s worked Harry up into a frenzy, he makes sure to hit all of Harry’s most sensitive spots—the soft skin on his side, the hollow of his hip. Just as Harry braces for Draco’s wand to touch down on his sensitive inner thigh, Draco taps the metal prostate massager.
“You’re taking it so well, love,” Draco says soothingly, as he drags his wand down Harry’s cock, causing him to buck and scream.
” The spell slows the water but doesn’t stop it from still escaping the pipe in slow motion. Harry grimaces as he thinks about the damage this is going to do if it gets through the floorboards.
Harry wanted to give him the world. He wanted Teddy to never want for anything in his life and have everything he deserved, everything Harry had often been denied in his own childhood. But he realised that meant also having structure and making sure that Teddy was taken care of in other ways.
Draco shakes his head with a laugh and swats Harry on the arse again. His husband always wants it rough when he’s been drinking, often when he’s not been also. So, Draco pulls out a bit farther, the tip of his cock barely inside as he rams back in. He keeps up the fast hard pace as his orgasm grows. Finally. It’s been weeks.
“Okay, I’m off to another meeting with the Minister,” Quarrington said, clapping Harry on the back on his way out. “Good work, both of you.”
There are several moments where nothing happens, but Harry can’t relax, his muscles are tightly wound, waiting for the next hit.
“So,” Draco said, slowly walking towards him, his eyes running over Harry’s face. “I came with a whole speech prepared but I think that’s going to need to wait.”
“It doesn’t say what, but this could be the connection to the potions ring—if Lucius was involved in the transportation somehow.” Harry looked up at the ceiling as he let his thoughts bounce around.
Draco’s so good at this—driving Harry positively spare by going slow, hesitating, waiting until Harry is riled up with impatience before taking him slowly apart. Draco stays still a moment longer, both of them tense.
Harry nodded, his heart breaking for Hermione. She was going to be devastated—not only at the treatment that all these creatures and people had to endure for god knows how long, but also that, at least some of it, came from people in her own department.
“No, I’m not going in for long. Spend time with your family, Assistant Head Auror Weasley,” Harry said.
Harry raised his eyebrows at that. “No one else? Not family or friends? Surely your son has access.”
Harry turned to Draco, smiling. “I’m glad you’re going to work on your fear of Magical Creatures. This will be great!”
“But this,” Harry added, pointing to a much larger warehouse only a few streets away. “Keeps coming up over and over again in the records. We think this was the primary warehouse for whatever they are smuggling.”
“Hey.” Draco smiled brightly as Harry approached and started to hold out a hand as if to pull Harry close but then pulled it back. “Sorry, you probably don’t want the press catching wind of that yet.”
He ran his finger along the edge of parchment where there were a few random calculations, a symbol here, a jotted down note there—the margins seeming to be a scratchpad for whoever wrote this—likely Lucius. Harry tossed it aside and then leant up against the camp bed, removing his glasses and scrubbing his hands over his face.
Harry put his tea on the floor and fell back, leaning up against the wall, and covered his face with his hands as he groaned. “Okay, well. You’re not wrong.”
“Come on, let’s go have an unreasonable amount of drinks for a Monday night and live to regret it terribly in the morning,” Malfoy said with a smile, and Harry let out a laugh, feeling lighter than he had in a long time.
“So—” Ron eventually broke the heavy silence. “In other news, they’ve officially offered me the Head Auror position.”
“I have two potions here,” Draco said, holding up his other hand to show Harry the small vials. “This one,” he says as he plucks the red vial from his hand, holding it in front of Harry’s face, “is quite the special brew. It heightens physical sensitivity—every touch, every pinch or stroke or lick. Everything will be amplified.”
Teddy came running back in, pulling the jumper over his head while still in motion and running headlong into the door. After a yelp and a bit of tugging, he managed to get it on. Since he was still growing, he regularly got ones with his initials, needing a new one every year. This one was a warm umber with a bright gold “T”.
“Er, well, both,” Hermione said, leaning toward him. “But Harry, you know that we love you no matter what, right? You could have talked to us about it. Not that you have to! Just that we’re here for you… if you want.”
Harry’s body breaks out in goose pimples, and he has to fight a full-body shiver. Draco continues, sometimes getting close enough that Harry thinks he can almost feel the softness of his lips. A puff of air skims a nipple and Harry drops back on the bed, gripping the sheets beside him. God, Harry misses this.
When Harry got back to the office, he closed the door tightly behind him with a sigh. “How long do you think it’s going to take the lab?”
The situation was enough to nearly make him come untouched. Draco working, ignoring him, Harry there as a toy, his plaything—inconsequential. Harry’s cock throbbed, a bead of pre-come sliding down the shaft.
“So—” Harry yanked open the broom shed doors. “I cannot possibly tell you how much I am not interested in helping you with anything.” With a huff, Harry grabbed the brooms on the ground and stepped in the broom shed. He shoved them into their spots a little harder than necessary, his face still burning in anger: at Malfoy, at the way his classes had been going, at the embarrassment of trying to catch that stupid bird and failing so miserably in front of his students and Malfoy both.
Harry lifts himself on his elbows, a grin on his face. “You’re the one who always insists you have impeccable taste.”
Harry stopped at the bottom of the stairs, straining to hear any sound from the bedroom where Draco had disappeared to after breakfast. They’d had another argument about household chores, with Harry expressing his frustration at being the only one who ever cleaned the place. After months of Draco insisting this was what house-elves were for, and Harry absolutely refusing to let the Malfoy house-elves come over to clean, the issue had come to a head that morning.
“Right, but isn’t there a point where someone else can take over? If you wanted to be done with it?”
So far, everyone had normal hands and Harry felt himself getting antsy with this plan but forced himself to go back to his fifth-year lessons. At least his evenings and weekend were looking up — he’d likely have his work all prepped by then. Eventually, Sinestra and Vector left, Simone Chaumont, the Defense teacher came in to ask Gerald something, and then quickly left, as well.
“Harry, here’s some for you.” Teddy gathered far too many presents in his arms, walking over to Harry before dropping them in a pile at his feet.
was a fluke. Just another example of Harry and Draco’s sheer bad luck. Apparently, when you mixed several forms of Party Pops together and then splashed the resulting mix over two unsuspecting souls, instead of any fun side effects, it had the ability to swap consciousnesses into different bodies. Cleanly. Perfectly. Without any other effect. And no one had any idea how long it would last.
Harry pulled the lace to the side and teased Draco’s entrance with the tip of his cock for a moment.
“And I do want to reward good behaviour,” Harry sucked Draco down, and Draco tightened his fingers against his neck before digging his nails into his hands to keep himself from bucking up into Harry’s mouth.
His phone buzzed, and he pulled it out of the pocket of his robes, assuming it would be Ginny. Quidditch training season had just started up for the year, and, like clockwork, every year since Ginny had become a coach, she’d spend the first week or two complaining about the new players. This group was driving her nuts, in particular. The new players apparently thought they could complain their way through practices and that their coaches might go easier on them if they told them repeatedly how hard the drills were. Harry smiled at the thought of how wrong they were about to find out they were.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, pulling his legs to his chest and wrapping his arms around them, pulling tight—tight enough to slow the shaking.
“Auror Potter, Auror Shaw,” he said, catching his breath. “We have a problem. Ernest Foxley from Floo Regulation has gone missing.”
Harry nodded subtly before turning and heading down the street to the pub. The pub was loud and fairly busy, but Harry was able to snag a slightly sticky table in a far dark corner of the room. A few minutes later, Ron slid in across from him putting a beer in front of each of them
But as Harry lay there, emotionally devastated from a case, he wondered why he’d just assumed that was all his life could be. He wondered how many of his life choices had been about him at all, and how many had been about other people. About not letting people down, about living up to people’s expectations, about doing what was expected of him—even at the expense of his well-being. He’d gone into the Aurors and stuck with it even as it consumed his life. He’d kept his sexuality a secret for decades, unwilling to even consider disappointing the Weasleys, his friends, and the public. He’d kept up his public appearance, always striving to be the poster child for a respectable member of society and a perfect Auror, all so that he wouldn’t disappoint people who he’d never even met.
“You’ll both be fine. You can go home tomorrow, but you’ll need a few more days of rest. No going into the field, and don’t try to bypass me this time, Potter. I’ve already told Auror Weasley as much.” She raised an eyebrow and quirked a smile.
As he undresses and steps into the spray, his mind spins at what Draco might have in store for him, the options are nearly endless in the playroom. Whatever it is, though, Harry thinks as he lathers himself up, carefully cleaning every inch of his body, it’s likely to be a very good day for both of them.
“Yes, sir,” Harry said in an exhale. Even though the air was warm, goose pimples were spreading up his legs.
“Not enough.” She sighed and sat back down towards the end of the camp bed, giving Harry room to join her.
Harry forced himself to smile, to pretend he was fine. “You’re terrible,” he said in what he hoped was a joking tone and then pulled himself out of bed, knowing if he didn’t leave right that minute, he’d not go at all. And he couldn’t do that to Ron or Mel. “I’ll put in for time off next week, okay?”
Harry’s hand twitched, positively itching to grab his wand and hex the man; itchy, red boils seemed like a good choice. But instead, he ground his teeth a little harder, taking a deep breath through his nose. It was going to be a long year.
Before Harry could respond, Draco was moving lower, kissing the hollow of his throat, down his chest, and then a nipple. Harry groaned at the sensation, nerve endings sparking.
“Okay. I’ve got it.” He settled back into the sofa. At least his body was happy about that choice, even if his mind couldn’t stand not being up and moving around. “Well, I’d offer you tea, but this stubborn houseguest is forcing me to stay on my sofa.”
The journey, in the end, is far too short. Before Draco knows it, Potter mumbles a warning and Draco’s world is being turned again, his body deposited on something cold and hard and not Potter.

Draping himself artfully over a cluttered workbench is more difficult than Draco anticipated. There is nothing that looks stable enough to hold him, nothing he would
“I would like that,” Potter answers and Draco smiles, nuzzling closer into Potter’s neck. “But you are here to save me, you said so yourself. That will be kind of difficult, huddled up here, far away from all the danger.”
It would be simple to say something, to ask Draco to sit down for an hour or two and very calmly, very rationally, talk about what exactly happened between them, how Draco feels about it. Simple, yes, but not easy. And, even in all its glorious simplicity, it could destroy the last thing remaining to them. What if Harry asking scares Draco off? Harry would be left here, without Draco, and none of the answers. Losing Draco again is not a risk Harry is willing to take.
“Don’t you think you are being a tad melodramatic here?” Potter asks and he doesn’t sound like someone smashed his head in, which is highly unfair.
Draco would love to give into the temptation and act like nothing is wrong, like this is how they spend their mornings and no one had been crying today, but he owes Harry better than that. Harry was kind enough not to point out the tears, not to comment on the ferrets piled onto him despite Draco’s professed aversion to them — he even made Draco laugh after patiently listening to his sob story. Harry deserves more than to have the whole thing swept under the carpet and forgot, although he would let Draco get away with it. Perhaps especially
For the first time, Harry is actively grateful that Ron only gave him a pitying look when everyone was out buying furniture and appliances for their new place and Harry suggested getting
Potter does a strange twisting thing with his fingers that has Draco arching up, gasping for air and only managing to smash into Potter, inhaling his hair and chocking on it, coughing violently and fumbling for air, panic searing through him as there is only more hair, dry and tickling in his throat, filling his mouth.
Malfoy still doesn’t say a thing, and if Harry didn’t see his open eyes (his lovely, deep grey and warm eyes) Harry would think Malfoy drifted off to sleep. Then Malfoy takes a small breath, lifts his head in defiance, anticipating blows and steeling himself to bear them, and he
to hold on to. Potter bites, then, bites into the skin just under his jaw and Draco shouts, tilts his head back to give Potter better access.
“Okay, seriously,” Ron holds up his hands, trying to quell the laughter enough to talk. “I’m telling you this because I think it might be relevant to your situation. I think you should be aware of the non-conventional forms a relationship can take.”
“Okay, first of all, it wouldn’t be half a relationship, alright? It’s full and complete, and, yes, exactly what I want. I don’t care about the sex, Draco, I want you to be happy.” How dare he make it about Draco? Draco is trying to save their marriage here, to think beyond himself and be selfless.
fault, if you are desperate for someone to blame. I asked vague questions and didn’t share my own thoughts; you had barely anything to go on. I think you did wonderfully, considering how reticent I was about sharing my… condition.” Reassuring Pansy in her unnecessary guilt has taken quite a lot of Draco’s attention, which he is equally grateful for and annoyed by.
“Fine, come on then.” No sooner has Harry said the words that Malfoy climbs on, immediately crawling under the blanket and laying down as far from Harry as possible.

Pansy has no concerns at all, watching the ferret twist and jump with a delighted laugh. Completely mad, the both of them.
“I know, how cruel of me to favour a tedious evening with stilted conversation with my dull husband over spending time with my friends who love to tease and pester me instead of adhering to the loyalty we are infamous for.” That came out bitterer than Draco expected. Yes, he doesn’t look forward to his evening with Potter — it will be even worse than they are predicting, and they all know he has barely concealed resentment and active antagonising to look forward to — but Draco didn’t mean to drag the mood down by putting this pesky truth into words, making it unavoidable.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, leaning closer and not looking away from his mouth. This is going all according to plan, dangerously smooth, and Draco presses down on his discomfort. He can’t afford to slip now. “I’m going to need you to stop saying things like that.”
“As if yours were any better. Perhaps I should lace your next meal with lemon juice as well.” Draco wouldn't, because he has
“I think your dad is patting the trees.” Harry's unexpected words (perhaps Draco should have known Harry would free himself of the spell in a matter of minutes, he has an annoying aversion against doing as he is told)startle Draco so viciously that he almost stumbles through the hedge; which would not only be humiliating and dreadfully tear his clothes, but also give away their position. Draco would have to find an excuse for being here,
‘GILDEROY LOCKHART KIDNAPPED BY THESTRALS!’ the headline reads, plastered over the whole page. The article (Harry is generous calling it an article, mostly because he doesn’t know a better word) details on how Lockhart — apparently recovered from his dangerous position as Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, which Harry didn’t know about — has gone missing, leaving behind only a lock of his hair and a hastily written note to communicate his abduction. The whole thing seems very dodgy to Harry, but the smile is promising to give him nightmares if he looks at it for much longer, so he quickly moves on.
Draco sits here, drinking his tea and holding Potter, offering what small comfort he can and thinking of what it might be like if he could run his fingers through that hair, if he could pull Potter against his side and hold him properly.
“You look like you never saw a room bigger than a broom closet before.” Infused with exactly the right amount of taunting and arrogance, the words snap Harry out of his thoughts.
“I was right, then,” Ron says, nodding to himself, as if Harry confirmed his answer for a paper he was writing, far too casual for the things Harry revealed.
at him, measuring and judging, seeing someone Draco does his best not to be anymore, someone scared and cruel and arrogant. Someone who doesn’t stand a chance at being found worthy. Granger doesn’t owe him anything, isn’t obligated to educate him solely because she has knowledge he doesn’t. Just because Draco is willing to learn doesn’t mean Granger has to teach him or answer his questions.
, and he grew accustomed to having those needs satisfied. He can’t be blamed for getting irritable when he is suddenly deprived of that.
“You see, I thought about what you said, that the marriage needs to be consummated before Grimmauld accepts it as real.” Potter is unbearably close — when did he get so close? “I think it’s worth a try, don’t you?”
Thinking on it, Draco realises that Potter has a point. His whole life was shaped by old men deciding what would be best for him, casting him off to magic hating relatives and rearing him to be the perfect little soldier from the first moment he set foot into Hogwarts. No one bothered to asks Potter what he wanted to do, the prophecy a convenient means when the questions started to pop up. Things were decided for Potter, often without his awareness, always without his consent.
! The third and last of the ferrets Harry dragged home, most adventurous of the bunch and currently about to be annihilated by a spell meant to stop a human intruder.
Draco is confused, breathless, smiling from Potter’s laugh and, most importantly, standing in completely dry air. Draco raises an eyebrow at Potter.
house, and that Pansy is his friend and wants him here. Granger has no say in the matter, little as she might like it.
“You should be nicer to me, Potter. It’s old pure-blood magic — you don’t stand a chance without me.” That … was probably meant to hurt Harry a lot more than it did. As it stands, Harry is just
He doesn’t understand, that is, until Potter suddenly screams, the sound terrified and going straight to Draco’s bones, and then there is another wolf, leaping at Potter. Draco doesn’t hesitate, making some beastly noise as he lunges forward, smattering the wolf back into the darkness it crawled out from.
Which, very neatly, brings Draco back to the letter awaiting him. A letter from Harry, an invitation to tea from his mother, and Pansy’s voice in his mind telling him to fight, to stand up for what he wants and to take it.
? Because under no accounts can that be the truth, starting with the fact that Ginny is the opposite of dull.” Blaise gets suspiciously defensive over Weasley, Draco notes. Of all the absurd theories Pansy has been spouting for the last 30 minutes,
For Harry, this is where he and his friends were captured. This is where Granger was tortured and mutilated and where he was reduced to shouting himself hoarse in his insignificant fear and fury. This is where his friend died, pierced by a dagger for daring to rescue them.
"That's unacceptable, I thought it would have been an hour at most! Look at you, you look like you'd keel over when you don't eat for a day, all scrawny." Harry almost protests that. What can he say, it's a sensitive topic for him. But seeing Ron so indignant is kind of touching and — Harry needs to remember that — the reaction he hoped for. "Wait a moment and try not to get locked into the cellar again, we'll be right over with some food for you."
"Famous last words, man. You are so going to marry Malfoy." Ron nods wisely as he drinks, immediately spluttering and choking on it. Good, next time he'll think twice about saying something horrible like that.
Or perhaps that’s just Draco. Perhaps Harry doesn’t think about any of that. Either way, Draco talks and he points, he tries his best not to think about all the reasons this shouldn't work, can’t for much longer and is doomed to fail when he least expects it.
, they touch all the time and Draco pokes and prods Harry into agitation and anger and — not the time, Harry has something more important to focus on here.
(Of course, Draco didn’t see it that way before escaping his own bonds of marriage, plainly refusing to marry Astoria. He is convinced it was only as easy as it was because everyone involved was relieved by the severing of that commitment—Astoria’s side because Draco is hardly a desirable match anymore and Draco because he jumped the plane of polite society and has insipid ideas of marrying for love, if you please.)
“Perhaps I liked it more than I wanted to admit,” Potter says and Weasley jumps into the air in triumph. Right, this is enough.
“Of course it is. You always had a weird way of flirting, you know that?” Draco almost chokes on his tea at the accusation, spluttering and coughing. He should have expected this, he really should have; Pansy loves to bring up her opinions when he is least prepared for it, always causing Draco to embarrass himself.
“I never claimed not to trust you!” That sounds awfully close like an excuse, talking around the truth because Draco is too cowardly to admit it. Too close for Harry.
, embarrassing as it is to say. There is something about Potter, all that raw power and the stubborn belief in The Good. It’s intoxicating, thrilling, simmering in the air between them.
Malfoy, which is such a weird thought that usually he wouldn’t even entertain it for a second before needing to think something mean and unfavourable about him to restore the balance of their lives. But this is hardly their usual, and Harry did enough damage, without adding mental jabs to the list. Comforting people is not something he is good at, though, not with people he likes and especially not with people who are confusing and irritating and so prickly that they would glare holes into him for trying.
to visit. (And that he prefers coffee over tea, but that is blasphemous and of little importance. Draco brought him tea anyway.) Potter doesn’t throw them out when they show up, no, but he certainly doesn’t invite them over and to call him pleased at the expression of concern would be exaggerated. Weasley made it very clear that they aren’t exactly welcome.
Harry looks down into his face, searches for traces of malice or madness and finding absolutely nothing, despite Malfoy’s face being more open that he ever saw it. Harry can’t bring himself to look away, can’t move his mouth to answer.
It's that, in the end, that is the most jarring; Potter never seemed to sit still a day in his life.
Draco doesn’t need to spell this out, does he? He doesn’t want to dwell on his own pain, either, and his friends know him well enough to fill in the rest. The details of what Potter said aren’t important, in the end. What’s important is that Draco was supposed to be better than this, that he should have grown impervious to all allegations thrown at him, hardened to the ugly words people hold for him.
The point is, things are going well. Potter is — after some gentle persuasion — willing to do as he is told, relieving Draco of the tedious task of carrying the furniture, and from time to time able to hold halfway decent conversations, even making Draco laugh sometimes. Yes, Draco is quite happy with where they are, despite having to make some sacrifices for it. He draws the line at inventing Weasley and Granger to lunch, though.
The kitchen, as it turns out, is not a safe space. That has more to do with Draco being in there (which, how? Harry left before him and there is no chance Draco could have passed him without Harry noticing, there is no other way into the kitchen. There they are again, then, favouritism, Harry’s old friend.) than with the knives hanging on the wall, sharp and dangerously glinting in the light.
Potter clears his throat, rubs his hands together with clearly malicious glee and lifts the silver dome concealing the first course. Potter does so with more fanfare than an appetiser deserves (and Draco has had some brilliant appetisers, he knows what he is talking about), unnecessary flurries of hands and acting like he is about to reveal humanity’s biggest secret. Draco rolls his eyes at his antics.
Draco’s point exactly, they forced a complicated relationship into simplified terms and it left giant holes to their plan. Not that it seems to bother Potter, who didn’t yet understand that if
“That’s not my name, you know?” Malfoy whispers into the space between them, the first words he spoke after bleeding out his insecurities onto Harry. And
to make friends with Potter. He wanted an interview and a boost to his spectacular career, nothing more. And now here Potter stands, telling Draco they
“Because, Potter, you are describing an owl. They have spooky eyes and beaks that hurt a lot when they pick at you but really, they are smarter than you give them credit for. You need to treat her better and perhaps she won’t try to murder you again.” It’s probably as simple as that, in the end. Potter was pissed after their fight, treated Athebyne with very little of the charm he is capable of, and their relationship has never fully recovered because Potter is socially inept.
He also has the feeling Draco won’t let him go back to sleep without acknowledgement, and Harry desperately needs either more sleep or more coffee. Draco might have finally learnt that Harry takes his caffeine with milk, but the overall quality hasn't improved much. Sleep it is, then, no way is Harry getting up to make coffee and listen to Draco’s complaints instead of sinking into peaceful oblivion.
“Are you trying to poison me, Potter?” he asks, in what is apparently a fit of reckless daring. Or the pathetic urge to make Potter feel better, which Draco won’t examine further (it works, anyway, Potter forgets his failed attempt at food to glare at Draco).
you here. If you are that desperate to have someone to talk to, take your bloody owl and leave.” Potter points at the door, his entire body throwing Draco out, rejecting him.
It’s not unheard of to find the victim’s (not a term that sits well with Draco, thinking of Potter laying in that hospital bed, being pulled up and apart by these chains) own representation in their mind in a state similar to their body, to find them unresponsive and hurt. It never means anything good and though there is more research necessary, they know enough to proclaim that treatment of these cases is rarely successful. If Potter doesn’t respond, he is as good as dead. (Not that Draco would just give up on him, but one needs to be realistic about these things.)
know. Not only is Pansy my best friend, but I’m not a complete idiot and I understand what was tactfully left unsaid.” Yeah, that doesn’t help Harry at all. He isn’t an idiot either, but Slytherin interaction and innuendo is not exactly his area of expertise. He’ll have to do more baiting, something to make Malfoy think he doubts his words, something simple that shows — Harry raises his eyebrow.
something about Pansy’s progress to Potter. They do have a bet Draco intends to win, after all. Potter then would react rather violently, like he did the last time Draco dared to imply his precious friends could fall to Pansy’s devilish vices, and Draco would have Potter’s temper to admire and poke at to alleviate the boredom.
recognise a challenge when he sees one. This is a test, one Draco is sure Harry will fail. Just as with the tickling. Harry is determined to not prove Draco right again.
. The ferret kind of nods, he supposes, leaves off its vigil, and begins to draw a circle around Draco, pressing so close Draco must feel its presence going round and around.
Or, more likely, Potter dropped him off and continued on his merry chase alone, find himself a better hero. Less pleasant, sure, but also more likely, given how Draco always woke to nothing but flowers and empty air where Potter was meant to be. He wouldn’t be terribly surprised if Potter had made him as comfortable as his Gryffindor conscience commands and then left him here, to either catch up when he wakes or not.
arrogance, at least) or a superiority-complex, but insecurity. Draco is lost, he doesn’t know what to do or how to fit in, so he compensates with confidence. Overcompensates, really, so that he doesn’t end up suave and charismatic but entitled and bratty.
Draco opens to him, surrenders all that he is to Potter’s prodding tongue and his questing hands. They are good hands, Potter’s, and Draco melts into them, held up by nothing but Potter’s desire, by his hands hands running over his ribs and gripping his arse, his tongue licking into Draco’s mouth, seeking the taste of himself, the proof of ownership, of possession. Because Draco is his, wholly and completely.
to demand anything of me if you aren’t even conscious enough to recognise me.” Draco is getting into proper ranting, whatever he is talking about bottled up for far too long and breaking out in an explosion of flying shrapnel, edges sharp and cutting them both deep.
The the world gets very hot—Draco doesn’t think he is burning, he would be screaming if he were—and he tightens his hand around a sword, the weight of it familiar and comforting. There is a roaring noise, the dragon’s head shooting down to pick at him and Draco jumps, tightens his hold on the sword and rams it deep into the dragon’s eye, the one place it isn’t covered in scales.
, because Potter is stupidly attractive and Draco doesn’t sleep much anymore—which had to take a toll on his judgement eventually—he raises from his place on the couch to slowly,
Draco lets go of Weasley in a panic, dumping him back into the river. Weasley huffs and glares and mutters about ‘the youth these days’, but he doesn’t say anything Draco would need to remove through a dangerous self-Obliviation.
He knows Potter is smarter than that, though, because he went to school with the git for six years and because Potter smirks at him, a smirk that promises a repeat.
“You mean what about sex?” Draco nods, feeling the blood crawl up into his face and making him blush. Harry shrugs, as if it’s that simple. “We won’t have it. Nothing you are uncomfortable with, I mean it.”
“Well, can you help him or not?” Weasley asks, impatient as always, eager to prove himself and his place. Draco would have thought getting more medals than he has siblings, now that he is one brother down, would have given him more surety. All it takes is for Potter to stumble and the world falls with him.
“Save it for the game, Potter. I’m here to see Athebyne! It’s been entirely too long since I saw her. I have to say, it’s irresponsible for you to stop writing to me and bereave me of her lovely company.” Draco didn’t realise he had gotten that attached to the owl, but he genuinely misses her.
wants to make you.” Draco, honestly, cannot claim to fully understand the complex feelings the public holds for Potter. He did his best to avoid the hubbub around him, their saviour and hero. He would bet all his fortune on it though; Potter is far more charming than anything people like Rita Skeeter could conjure up.
Well, he supposes it’s not really the deal or the man himself Harry is missing. As far as he is aware, Malfoy is blissfully asleep in his bed and the deal still firmly intact. No, what Harry is acutely missing right now, has been missing for several hours, is the effect their sort-of-allegiance had on Grimmauld. That vindictive old house is trying to freeze him out, and Harry has no idea what he did to deserve this sort of treatment.
They have lost track of how many times Blaise has defied Pansy for reasons not deemed good enough — he regretted it every single time, Pansy’s revenge schemes getting more elaborate and more personalised with every spin they take. Actually, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out it was Pansy who cursed Blaise with his bad luck in bets, the gambling skills an unplanned side effect. Blaise and Pansy take some weird enjoyment out of baiting each other — something Draco never fully understood, because he might have similar habits with Harry (there he is again,
Draco doing? He doesn’t know, he truly doesn’t, but he doesn’t want to stop, either. He doesn’t remember when he last felt like this, grounded in his body and yet floating on adrenaline, heart beating high in his chest from excitement not fear, arousal curling heavy and warm in his gut like a lazy beast, stretching on stiff limbs after sleeping for far too long.
Draco doesn’t dwell on that, can’t afford to, if he wants to avoid having a Talk — for someone so dreadful at talking and emotions, Harry does insist on doing a surprising amount of it — and get through this operation smoothly. They ought to talk about this, about the war and their respective roles in it, at some indefinite point in the future, but not here, not now. They have been doing well on Not Talking about Things, mostly, only discussed what was absolutely necessary to to satisfy Grimmauld, and Draco has no intention of shaking that balance of acknowledgement and denial over events that are best forgotten.
Potter’s hand squeezes around Draco’s cock, the pressure sudden as heat encloses him and Draco screams at the sensation, throws his head back to breath as he chokes on his tongue, hips stuttering into Potter’s hand, cock spurting in exploding relief, whipping through Draco like a tidal wave.
It’s stupid. Draco would have realised that sooner if he had stopped for a moment to think, if he had considered what comes after the jump, but he hadn’t. Potter was falling, gone, waiting to be saved, and apparently it’s
Draco looks at Harry like he doesn’t believe this is really happening, like he doesn’t know what to do now or how to process this, Harry saying his name. Harry understands; he feels it too.
“How can you be so calm about this? This isn’t what you signed up for, but you are okay with half a relationship?” Perhaps Harry simply hasn’t admitted to himself yet what insisting on his stupid noble honour means. Perhaps Draco has to make it extra clear what his options are.
“What, you think Draco is… ace, you said?” Harry asks, because he can’t apologise for being a stubborn bastard and making his friend’s life more difficult over Parkinson than it already was. There was too much humility here today; Harry doesn’t think he could bear much more of it.
On the other hand, Harry never gave him any reason to suspect he wouldn’t take good care of his secrets. In fact, as Draco’s partner, he is not asking for anything unreasonable in being kept in the loop. Draco is allowed to trust him, to share the innermost workings of his mind with him. Technically, it should only be Harry who knows these, but Draco is certain his friends figured him out years ago, which only supports the idea of inducting Harry into the small circle.
“Shows how little imagination they have, but if that’s what you prefer,” Harry says, because he is unsure what the expected response here is and because he might explode if he starts thinking of all the things charming about Malfoy. Malfoy looks at him with wide eyes, expectant, prodding and, oh, that is what Harry is supposed to say. Alright then, if the night already doesn’t really count. “Draco.”
“Rain, Malfoy, it’s going to rain!” Draco doesn’t get a chance to protest before he is being pulled up, Potter’s arm around his waist as he lifts him and twirls him, setting him down laughing.
Draco turns—arms shaky as they push him up and vision blurry, blood pounding in his head and his nose, flowing over his face and into his mouth—and he spits in the mans stupidly grinning face, blood splattered over him like a bad Jackson Pollock painting. The man takes his grabby hands of Draco, trying to wipe blood of his face and out of his eyes, but Draco doesn’t give him the moment, kicking him and hoping in all vicious wrath for revenge that he can summon, that it breaks the bastards nose.
“Come on, Malfoy, put in some effort! This is Harry’s favourite scene; this is where you do The Face™ and promise to show him the wonders of the world.” Weasley jumps in excitement, disconcertingly close after climbing through Potter’s hair towards him.
“Malfoy, welcome back with the conscious.” Weasley. Right, Draco forgot there were other people here besides Potter and him.
He just … disappears, leaving nothing but a vague pain in Draco’s hand and an imprint in the grass. Harry Potter, gone again because Draco couldn’t hold him.
what the best for me would be. You don’t get to decide for me, Malfoy,” Potter hisses, anger flaring up as though Draco, in his attempt to put it out, added fuel to it. Draco must have hit a nerve.
Draco doubts Harry will understand that exact reference, but he hopes the message translates regardless. He doesn’t have the words to express the warmth pooling in his chest, the fiercely protective urge making him want to keep Harry here forever, far away from anything that could hurt him, so the kiss will have to do.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise to Harry that Draco doesn’t see his friend as the threat to careful bliss that she is. After all, Draco grew up with her, invited her, doesn’t have any personal boundaries with her — Harry went over this a million times this evening alone, he
“At the very least I would have liked to see you on your knees,” is what Draco says instead of admittances of any sort. Then his brain catches up with his mouth, Potter smirks at him, and Draco wishes he had just spilt out his unrealistic dreams of being loved for who he is; that would have been less humiliating.
“Care to explain what this is, Potter?” Draco tries to control his seething anger, he really does, but Potter’s smug grin tells him he didn’t succeed.
Safely landed on his own feet, Malfoy immediately runs to hide behind Harry, pressing close against his back and peeking over his shoulder. Harry doesn’t ask if he has to stand on his tiptoes to accomplish that, he knows Malfoy does.
“What do you think you are doing?” Harry sounds the closest to panic that Draco has ever heard him, holding Draco at arm’s length and staring at him, eyes wild. That is not what Draco wanted to happen — did he do it wrong?
if perhaps Draco has plans. Draco doesn’t, he generally dedicates that time to reading, but Harry could at least should have asked! It’s the polite thing to do, and it would have given Draco the chance to come up with an excuse. As it stands, the topic is long closed before Draco has recovered from the shock of being invited.
, because they like you and they like spending time with you. Honestly, if you don’t know what friendship even
Harry sees Draco cringing against walls, sees him throw up after Harry’s touched him, sees him bundle up in blankets and pace in front the door, deciding if the worse fate is freezing to death or sharing a bed with Harry.
He opens the window to let Cassiopeia inside and absently scrambles for the owl treats as he reaches for the letter she is carrying. Potter’s letter.
Draco takes a decisive step back. Not yet, he can kiss Potter when they are out of his mind, but not a moment before that. They agreed, much as he regrets it at this moment.
“Yes, Neville has been here a lot. To look after the plants.” Potter does a weird thing with his eyebrows, his pronunciation terrible the way someone who wouldn’t know subtlety if it hit them over the head would try to subtly add meaning to a consciously bland sentence. It’s all terribly endearing and only hurts Draco’s Slytherin heart a tiny bit. “He talked too, about his shop and his friends and the things they do.”
, hands over his mouth to hold the accusations inside. Too late for that, it’s already out in the air, laughing between them, more dangerous than if Draco had just said it.
Potter, as predicted, doesn’t want to hear it, struggling and flailing, hitting Draco in the face and aggravating his barely healed nose. They are kind of bad at this communicating thing, aren’t they?
Draco startles so badly that he lets the paper fall, shooting upright and eyes frantically searching until settling on Harry, identifying him as the intruder. Harry might have been exaggerating on how well they live together.
“No, but —” Harry is interrupted by Draco, who apparently needed nothing but that tiny confession before he keeps condemning Harry for having common sense.
you could have stumbled a little longer. That scene wasn’t in the movie when it should have been—I wanted to see how that would play out!” Weasley has the gall to look honestly put out that Draco saved his best friend too early from his nightmare. They have a strange dynamic going on, these two; Draco doesn’t think he’ll ever understand.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Is that what this is about? Do you not want my friends to come over so you plan on buying an aggressively small couch?” Harry looks vaguely insulted, not sure yet if it’s warranted but prepared for it anyway. Draco is mostly confused.
are the one currently tied to a chair and unable to move, just saying.” Potter grins and winks at him and Draco melts right where he sits. “Second, I don’t need you to save me.”
(Also, assuming Draco would have the money to make everything bow down to him in that setting—obviously, Malfoys know how to get to the top of society—he probably wouldn’t be too keen to drop everything to run away with the handsome gardener, no matter his laugh. Draco would still
“Touch me, you bastard,” Draco demands, his dying wish before he throws himself into kissing Potter, pulling him closer.
“Yes, your hair is fine,” Granger confirms. Then, because apparently Draco can’t get away quite that easily, she adds: “Exactly the same as when you asked me a minute ago.”
Ginny sitting up straighter and narrowing her eyes at him is the only warning Harry gets before she is firing them again, one kernel of popcorn after the other with quick pace and high precision, forcing Harry to duck and jump and contort to catch them all. But Harry isn’t the youngest Seeker in a century for nothing, and he never backs down from challenge. Harry is going to catch them all, every single one of them, until Ginny has no popcorn left and has to admit defeat.
Harry feels faintly sick, the pieces slowly fitting together to create one horrible, horrible conclusion. (The exact thing he has been denying in an increasingly desperate struggle finally victorious.)
Potter, Draco realises far too late, has a terrible sense of humour. He is also very proud of it, recounting his favourites of Draco’s expressions and what he did to earn them, his tale wrecked by hiccups, which only makes him laugh harder. Draco barely understands a word.
“I wouldn’t, no,” Draco answers, trying for even and failing. It’s the truth and her disdain hurts, but it’s nothing he doesn’t deserve. “I am asking you now, though, to please explain it to me.”
“Agreed,” Draco says instead, holding his hand out for Potter to shake. Which he does, smirking at Draco because he knows he won. Damn that bastard.
“Come on Potter, we talked about this. I thought we agreed?” Draco, it seems is the only one who remembers that conversation. Potter certainly remains unmoved by his appeal, pouting in this nightmare of a romantic scene, fireflies flying around him and the water shining silver in the light of the moon.
Malfoy took a lot more time with his outfit. He’s wearing formal robes, closed high and dyed a dark blue, contrasting beautifully against his pale skin and shimmering in silver ornaments. They move in the wind, just a bit, his hair gently curling around his face and calling for Harry to tuck it behind his ear, trace over the silver pendants woven into a multitude of tiny braids.
“I need some air, Potter.” Draco sounds feeble to his own ears, weak and fluttering and on the verge of being overwhelmed.
“There is a nice park nearby, which should be pleasantly deserted at this time of the night.” Potter almost
There was no other choice for Harry but to fight through the heaviness, to approach problems with the arrogant certainty that he could defeat them. Sink or swim.
, every nook and cranny, all in vain. He was forced to concede that even knowing the secret he didn’t find the object connected to it, Theo got to feel smug and then they had ice cream. Draco blames the ice cream for overshadowing the lesson he should have learnt that day, leaving all his secrets collected in one room. Except when he thanks the ice cream, because they also amount to his favourite place to be in.
“Now what do you say we surprise your cousin with having breakfast ready when he wakes up? You can help me,” Harry said, conspiratorially.
“Flynn, go get Hagrid,” Harry said. As soon as the student turned to go, another loud pop sounded behind him. Harry turned to see an empty space where the Diricawl had previously been. Apparently, the rules of wixen magic didn’t apply to this creature; it had apparated, or whatever magic it was doing, right out of the trap. Harry groaned.
“And then, I don’t know… with the Weasleys and my friends. I honestly don’t know how they’d react and that scares me.”
"Hermione and Ron’s.” Harry leans up against their dresser, a smile spreading over his face. “For the whole night.”
Draco nodded and walked around the side of the centre counter to the taps. A minute later he slid a honey-coloured lager in front of Harry.
Further back on the field, Noah, a Ravenclaw Chaser, kept pulling up instead of turning. Harry flew over to watch more closely. Noah flew back to the starting location, about 20 yards up, and flew into another dive. Harry watched him carefully, saw the tension and the flinch as the ground came closer; Noah pulled up again far too soon and didn’t make the turn.
“Sounds good. Now let’s go find George and Angelina so that I can kick your arse at Quidditch.” She knocked him on the shoulder as she walked to the door, a clear bounce in her step.
The street remained still and silent save for some echoing sounds of train cars in the distance, but Harry could feel the magic in the air as the numerous wards began to drop, one by one. Harry could sense how strong they were, and a sense of foreboding crept over him the longer it took for them all to be disabled. Someone had gone to great lengths to keep unwanted guests out of this warehouse.
“Okay, we need to come back to that at some point,” Harry said, momentarily derailed. “But the point is that I don’t think we should rule anything out just yet.”
Harry checked his watch as he made his way back to Alder—the class was nearly over. The boy was impatiently tapping his foot in the grass, arms still crossed. Harry grit his teeth, refusing to rise to the bait and reminding himself that he was the adult there.
“Okay, go to my flat. My roommates will let you in—I’ll call them—and I’ll be there as soon as I can. Just go back to my bedroom and wait there.”
He checked his watch and saw he had a little over an hour. “Sure, but I want to shower, so I should start getting ready soon.”
“Thanks for the reminder, hon,” Ron put his arm around her shoulders and kissed her temple, before smiling at Harry, and saying, “We’ll leave the feints and dives for the kids.”
When Ron was first offered the position, Harry was concerned that he’d be envious. There had been an assumption from the moment that Harry started with the Aurors that the Assistant Head Auror position would eventually fall to him. And even Harry had bought into that assumption at some point, finding himself surprised when Ron was offered the job. But once the initial surprise faded, Harry found that he felt nothing but happiness for his friend. In fact, he even found himself a little relieved at not having been offered the supervisory position, which he would have felt obligated to accept.
on the ones that seemed like a flight risk. Bradbourn has his wand on them, also. We’ve got him stable enough for that.”
“Harry.” Draco gently grabbed his arm as he got to the door. “Let me just say bye to Lila, and I’ll take you home.”
Ron’s smile was blinding as Harry turned to leave. And as he walked back to his office, Harry felt, for the first time in a long time, like things were going to be okay.
Draco’s eyes crinkled and he kept his gaze locked on Harry’s as he lowered himself back down. He kissed his way down Harry’s cock and then traced his tongue back up as his fingers slowly pressed in. Harry sighed and moaned as Draco continued to slowly open him up, working his fingers in and out, paying just enough attention to Harry’s cock to keep the experience enjoyable and to keep him relaxed.
Harry was pretty sure it was her first real case, even as a researcher. Harry held back a smile, not wanting to come across as patronising, as he could remember being the nervous one in case meetings when he’d first started.
“And what?” Malfoy scoffed. “They’re just hoarding it somewhere in the castle instead of eating it? I don’t see how they could avoid touching the items if they planned on eating either of them. And the potion works with any contact. So if they even brushed the wrapper of the chocolate or the jar of your container, it will have turned their skin blue.”
“I often just get the stronger student taking over and just doing the entire potion instead of trying to help along the weaker student. Sometimes it works better to put the two weaker students together in Potions so that they have to struggle through it.”
Harry looked down at him; Draco’s eyes were dark with lust, all nervousness gone. “What about you?” Harry ghosted his hands down to Draco’s sides.
As he sat back down, Draco gave him a flat look before flicking his wand in the direction of the pile, sending the clothing airborne as it folded itself and settled on a shelf to the side of the office.
Molly shared a look with her husband, and then, Arthur carefully asked, “Ah, and is that a good thing?”
“Oh, sure, yeah,” Harry replied, tamping down the fluttering in his stomach and reminding himself that this was just drinks with a colleague. The reminder quickly was lost when Malfoy stood up and flashed him a genuine smile as he nodded towards the staff room door.
While Malfoy was still snarky and a bit too posh for his own good, it had become more than clear over the past few weeks that the cruel, blood purist child Harry had once known had been replaced by someone who was introspective and thoughtful. And even though Harry wouldn’t quite use “kind” as a word to describe Malfoy, the nights they’d spent over the past week plotting and talking about classes showed Harry just how deeply the man cared about his students. He was professional, fair, and honest. Maybe “honest” wasn’t quite the right word, Harry thought with a suppressed laugh as he quickly walked to the staff room where their stolen plant was waiting.
Draco was used to some give in the ropes and in the way Harry bound him—room to squirm, to try to get away, even if it wasn’t really possible. But this was entirely different. While none of the ropes were tied off to anything, nothing that should keep him in place, the ropework only allowed for a little movement, only a slight bend in his torso, a stretch along the side of his body. And even then, the pressure that put on the rest of his body was so great that the effort was soon arrested.
“We’ve got quite some good craft beers and ales on tap. What do you like?” Draco grabbed the clipboard from the bar and turned to tuck it next to the till.
“Yeah, a few on some of the letters. Hold on—I wrote them down. I’ve seen an L, I’m assuming for Lucius,” she said, shuffling some parchments around on her desk.
Draco quickens the pace of his hips, feeling the familiar warmth growing. The orgasm doesn’t build as fast as it used to, age slowing all things down, but he’s not sad to draw things out. When they were young and first together, they could barely get their pants off before they were coming from simply rutting against one another.
“So, Teddy,” Harry said as he joined Teddy and Draco on the sofa. “We were thinking we could read the bedtime stories out here tonight. Have a special Christmas Eve story time?”
They’d need to check Narcissa’s alibi, but Harry doubted it would be that easy. Normally, they’d start looking for someone who might have a reason to murder the victim. But for Lucius Malfoy, that list was likely to be a quarter of the wizarding population. Hell, Harry would have to add himself and the other Aurors who were still pissed off that he managed to get off with only a large fine to that list. It was a fine that might have made the average wizard destitute but had seemed to not even make the most minor of dents in the Malfoy fortune.
He fiddled with his napkin, wondering if Malfoy was going to be irritated to see him here again. After another minute, he pulled out his phone, scrolling through his missed texts. He had two from Ginny, no doubt bothering him about having cancelled their plans to grab a drink that past Friday. He started tapping out a reply that he’d make it up to her soon.
“Harry—these are hot, and you are getting them,” she said with her head tilted in consideration as she continued to stare at his arse. “Malfoy will be drooling.”
Harry spun to glare at Malfoy, as he pulled out his usual chair and plopped a large stack of parchment on the table.
“Oh wait, what was the reason for that again?” Draco tapped a finger on his lips if trying to remember, and Harry rolled his eyes at the melodramatics. “Oh, right! It said your musculoskeletal system had been severely taxed from the spell residue and since your magical core was also recovering, that you could injure yourself further. That was it.”
Harry nodded and knew that as a Black witch, this likely hit her a bit harder than he could even imagine. He wasn’t doing great with it, himself. He waited for Naomi to finish directing a team of Healers to the seating area that he and Mel had set up.
“But, that means we need a new trainer. You’d work with the general MLE trainers to train both new MLE officers and new Aurors.”
When he reached Draco’s room, he opened the door slowly and flipped the light switch. Harry wasn’t sure what he expected, but the small room still took him by surprise. There wasn’t much in it—a bed, dresser, and nightstand.
“Oh,” Harry replied, relaxing his stance just a little. He took a moment to really look at Malfoy, his eyes were sincere and he looked genuinely contrite. Harry hadn’t thought the man actually had it in him. “You’re apologizing?”
“I do—I consider you a friend, Mel.” Harry pulled himself up off the floor and sat on the camp bed. He knew he could trust her; it was just that he’d just carried this secret around for so long that it felt huge. Too much. But at the same time, he couldn’t really remember what he’d been afraid of for all those years, at least not with her. “I’ve been… I’ve been figuring some things out.”
Draco huffed and waved his hand in front of Harry’s face. “Did you get hexed by some stray object in the last hour? Why do you keep saying that?”
He tried to fight down the flush that he could feel creeping up his face, but she just laughed a little harder at his embarrassment and pulled him tighter.
Malfoy laughed as he went to the pantry, pulling open the door. After a moment, he stepped back and made a small noise. Harry watched him intently as he shuffled a few things around in growing frustration.
Draco’s eyes narrowed slightly at the movement, and he gestured toward the sitting room. “Probably should take it easy until then, yeah?”
“Or did you have something else in mind?” Draco asked tauntingly. Harry’s own green eyes stared back at him, but the expression was all Draco.
Harry lets out a weak sigh when Draco finally removes his hand from his cock. The metal toy is slowly worked out a moment later, and Harry whimpers as it brushes his prostate on its way out. Then he’s being lowered, his restraints removed, and carried to the bed in the far corner. He blinks through wet eyelashes to see Draco looking down at him reverently as he lays him down.
Harry gave her an obligatory smile at the joke and headed to Ron’s office. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement was only slightly less chaotic than it had been the previous two days. Officers and Aurors were trying to track down the last few suspects in the trafficking ring. Other support staff were busy putting together case files for the prosecutors and Wizengamot. Harry nodded hello at his co-workers as he made his way down the hallway before knocking on Ron’s slightly open door.
“What Ron means to say,” Hermione said loudly, “is that we’re here for you, and we want you to know that it doesn’t make any difference to us. And we’ll accept whoever you choose to date.” She gave a pointed look to her husband, who cleared his throat and nodded.
He watched as Draco finished, as he gently worked himself through his orgasm and then the aftershocks. He then opened his eyes, and his expression was unguarded. A soft smile curved onto Harry’s lips. Draco huffed a laugh and then returned it.
“What can I get you?” A young woman with a lip ring slid a coaster in front of each of them. Her hair created a sort of rainbow halo around her head, with tight curls dyed in a myriad of colours pulled back by a cloth headband, bright against her dark skin. Harry once again felt far too uncool to even be in the neighbourhood, let alone this pub.
person, might have scrambled up, offered Draco a hand and apologised, might have tried to brush grass and dirt of his clothes and only made it worse. Potter doesn’t do that, extraordinarily pleased with himself and wriggling on Draco like a fat cat, proud of its catch.
(Potter doesn’t have a ring, which his disappointing despite how unsettling it would have been for Potter to be prepared for this highly specific situation—no one sane carries around engagement rings on the off-chance they might need them.)
make a good friend? Don’t tell me it’s the hair, please, because I have neither the complexion to pull off that trademark Weasley ginger nor the patience to deal with Granger’s—admittedly very lovely—curls.” Vaguely, Draco is aware that becoming Potter’s friend wasn’t what he set out to do. (He would have approached that differently, would have gently ensnared and charmed until Potter wouldn’t know what hit him when finally, Draco asked him—okay, no, Draco is thinking of dating Potter, sorry about that.)
(There is also the issue of Draco being painstakingly aware of how close Harry is, obviously wishing for the wall to part to grant him sanctuary. Harry deliberately doesn't think about that.)
"I made my decision, Potter. I think you will be ecstatic." Somehow, Harry doubts that; it's likely because of the evil smirking and gleeful anticipation. Like a comic book villain, full of himself and monologuing in front of his involuntary audience. "Despite your sudden change in tone, which I don't appreciate, I will grant you your request."
Draco talks as though he’s in a trance, no inflection or emotions in his voice. It’s chilling and not at all what Harry was expecting.
to be here.” Malfoy is avoiding the question. Sure, being insulted in every single sentence serves as a nice reminder of why Malfoy is
Even if Malfoy could sound as arrogant and assertive as he wants, Harry still would not do any of these things. Malfoy struts through the house like he owns it, acting like Harry is nothing but a particularly unpleasant, though temporary, house guest, and it’s only a matter of time before he leaves and Malfoy can do all the fancy remodelling that he wants. And there is nothing Harry can do about it if he doesn't want Grimmauld to enact revenge for Malfoy’s wounded pride.
Potter scrunches his face up into a grimace but nods, as if he expected that. Then he motions for Draco to go on, because he doesn’t like planning their domestic bliss any more than Draco does. Right, so much for the expected, uncomplicated bit.
The only thing he could do is leaving. It’s such a far off concept—leaving Potter behind, leaving him to sit alone in this boat, waiting for someone to come and kiss him—but it would theoretically be possible. Finding the path wouldn’t be easy, not unless Potter wanted him to find it, but Draco could go back into the real world, accept that he failed in saving Potter and leave.
wouldn't be the one leaving.” Harry doesn’t know how Malfoy always does that to him, riles him up and gets him involved in arguments and fights when just seconds ago he was almost perfectly content and asleep.
Potter first. Draco has his priorities. (Granger and Weasley are more than capable of helping themselves, Potter might not be.)
If Harry doesn’t get a new brain, neither does Ron. And because Ron is his best friend — as Harry pointedly reminded him as he tried to flee the moment he realised exactly what it was Harry wanted to talk about — Ron sat patiently and listened to Harry’s dilemma. Sure, there is a constant grimace on his face that got worse with every minute Harry didn’t stop talking about Malfoy and might be stuck on his face forever, but Ron listened and that’s all that counts. Because Ron can tell him what to do about it.
It’s a nice surprise, a gift horse Draco has no intention of looking into the mouth. He will take all the blessings Potter’s trapped mind feels gracious enough to bestow upon them, and he will deal with the price when it’s demanded.
Potter smiles up at him, small and sad. He shouldn’t look this way, this lonely, and Draco wishes he knew how to help him, how to make that quiet sorrow go away. Then Potter sneaks a hand up into his hair, holding Draco even closer, even more intimate, and Draco has to close his eyes against the onslaught of possibility, against his heart racing out to meet Potter’s.
Harry takes his coffee (does he know there are other ways than dark and bitter? Surely he must!), the mug once again filled to the brim with coffee barely drinkable.
The importance of Draco’s being undisturbed is utterly lost on Potter, of course. The only time he so much as moved to say something, was when one of the men wanted to know where
As for the linguistic resemblance you remarked upon: it’s called manners and seems to have gone out of fashion.
Harry tries to remember that, that he is doing proud and impressive work here, as he finally grabs the right chair and loses his balance picking it up, almost falling on his arse. He clings to the thought as he manoeuvres the giant monstrosity through Grimmaulds rather narrow corridors — this is
Harry sighed. The young man was fidgeting, his face taking on a greenish hue. Harry grabbed a bag of medical supplies and walked over.
“I’m gay,” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself. He couldn’t look at the man to see his reaction, keeping his eyes trained on the pond, the ducks swimming along the far end, the small ripples in their wake.
Harry’s eyebrows rose at that. From what he knew, Draco never went into wizarding areas anymore. Well, he’d be able to ask him about it soon enough, he thought. He suggested they meet at the Dragon’s Lair, and Draco replied that he’d be there in a few.
Already, Harry could tell this was going to work better. He’d spread out the zones along the far length of the pitch, allowing him to see nearly the whole class at once if he hung back towards the stands closest to the castle. While he’d still need to go around to the different groups, at least he could at least fly back to the stands and keep an eye on everyone. He gave them some time to go through the actions a few times over. One of the students nearly fell, but he watched the others in the group immediately help out and correct his grip.
Harry broke out in a smile, chuckling quietly, and thinking of Aaron, who just seemed hell-bent on finding a way to injure himself in every class.
“Well, thanks for that. Now what am I supposed to do to convince myself that my lifestyle is better than most?” he asked melodramatically, with a glint in his eye.
“We’re okay, Ron.” Harry tried to pull himself up in his chair just enough to look slightly less injured, but pain shot through his side at the motion, and he couldn’t keep the grimace off his face.
Harry allowed his eyes to roam over Draco’s face, searching, wondering once again if he might not be the only one whose feelings had grown into something new. Hoping he’d been right earlier that evening in the Andromeda’s kitchen.
Harry felt content. It wasn’t a feeling he was used to having. He had hoped that he would find a bit of contentment at this job—particularly being back at Hogwarts, which even after all these years still felt more like a home than his attempted renovation of Grimmauld Place. In all his musings of what this job and life might look like, though, never would he have expected to find his moment of happiness sitting in a pub with Draco Malfoy.
Harry didn’t react, a calm rage boiling through his body. He pressed harder, letting his magic flow through his wand, heating up the tip enough to hurt.
After a few minutes, Draco wraps his fingers around Harry’s cock, and Harry sighs in relief. It doesn't take much for Draco to work him back up to the edge.
Another scrape of the chair, and Harry realised Draco was taking another break. It must have been some time later.
Harry let out a cry that sounded more like distress than relief. He’d get to come. He’d get to come in Draco’s throat. Fuck. The arousal coursing through him only intensified at the thought. Then, the ropes were sliding off of him and a sound of scraping filled the room as the table slid toward the wall.
A sigh broke up the silence, and Harry looked around the stacks of parchments and notebooks on his desk to see Mel chewing on a fingernail while she read more letters.
Draco released him. Harry pistoned his hips almost immediately, and Draco gagged as his cock hit the back of his throat roughly, but he forced himself to relax and let Harry fuck his throat.
“Draco—” Harry snapped his head up, unable to take anymore. He could feel his body reacting… except it wasn’t his body, and that was the problem. He knew Draco liked to get him riled up, that it was just a game to him. But this felt different, more charged.
He thought of Draco at his pub, smiling and laughing, of the last few days lazing in bed, exploring one another. For once, life hadn’t felt so difficult—so full of darkness and evil people. And he wanted that back.
“Pansy, please. I made you these scones, laboured in the kitchen for hours upon hours so that you might enjoy the fruit of my hard work and dunk it into your tea—also provided by me, in case you forgot. Could you just eat them and answer my question?” Draco is not pouting, how dare you suggest that? He is very reasonably pointing out that Pansy is being a bad friend, which is a
. What kind of marriage do they lead, where Draco can’t trust him and goes along with everything Harry wants because he is too scared of losing the good parts to speak up?
Potter smiles at him, eyes wide and bright in the near darkness around them, but he doesn’t say anything.
inner circle of the family he isn’t privy to. It’s ridiculous and Harry hates it, hates how abruptly that made him feel lonely.
He raises a good point, though, well worth the risk of inelegantly falling on his face. Did Draco say yes? He doesn’t remember — whether he doesn’t want to, or the alcohol is dimming his mind, he doesn’t know for sure. Sometimes he did, like that very first time. Surely, he did the other times, too?
The exhaustion sitting deep in his bones. The call to sleep, to drift back out into hazy contentment.
“Do you want us to break your legs so you will have to stay in St. Mungo’s until you are healed and unfortunately miss your appointment with Potter?” Blaise is the first to break the silence, grin wicked and eyes bright. But there is a darkness hovering just underneath the surface, ready to pounce at just one word from Draco. The message is clear: if Draco is serious, if he were to give the slightest indication that this is what he wants, Blaise would do much more for him than break a few legs. They all would, for every single one of their group.
the one who wouldn’t have sex when he was asleep.” Draco is less sharp than Blaise — it feels that way, at least. Draco feels soft, malleable, sunken in puddle of misery, splashing out answers with every poking question. It’s all so very simple when you are drunk and don’t care about the consequences, because there are no consequences here, not when everything is fuzzy and miserable and the next day is an endlessness away.
, Potter; could you wait until tomorrow before you throw me out?” Malfoy has stopped muffling his words in the bedding, going so far as to turn around to tell Harry just why exactly he is an idiot for being excited about this. Well, the idiot part is implied. Actually, the near-pleading is wholly unexpected to Harry.
“It’s not going well, no,” Draco tells the table, his forehead firmly resting there after his last drink made the world spin loudly. It didn’t get kinder, though, and Draco didn’t want to see that. So, table. It’s a very reliable friend, much better than Pansy, who pokes him in the shoulder with her sharply manicured fingers, testing to see if he’s still breathing. (As if he would just die like this, miserable and unceremoniously, without leaving instructions for his eulogy to Blaise.)
The test is passed, Granger is sure and both of them step back into the room to join Draco. The energy changes around them as Granger and Weasley conceding to Draco’s expertise, no longer arguing. They are getting serious, preparing to dive into Potter’s mind and the horrors that might await them there. The air grows somber with the responsibility they assumed.
“Anyway, seems like you really ought to kiss him,” Weasley smirks as Draco splutters at the non-sequitur. “I’m afraid there is a whole song about it, this entire scene dedicated to get the two of you kissing.”
“I wish; I’ve seen them do it before.” Granger shrugs, like it’s no big deal, and turns back towards Potter and Weasley, now in a lift. Draco didn’t think they could do that; he is begrudgingly impressed.
“Of course I would, anywhere you want to go,” Draco says, because if you can’t be sappy under the sprinkling rain, than he doesn’t know where else. He reaches one hand out for Potter again, offering it into the empty space between them that Potter created in his fit.
Draco remembers flying against Potter in Hogwarts, remembers being more focused on Potter than the Snitch and remembers the way Potter flies, reckless and graceful, as if he was born for it. He remembers the thrill and the challenge no one presented like Potter did, remembers how Potter used to laugh in the air, where no one but Draco could hear.
“Did you meet Charlie's boyfriend last Christmas?” Ron asks, completely out of nowhere. Did Harry miss something?
“You silly man,” he whispers, voice chock-full with affection, something tight and held down, too big for this moment.
Still, Potter looking at him expectantly means Draco now has to share his realisation and really, he had hoped they could perhaps avoid this. A ridiculous idea, of course, childishly naive, but Draco had hoped nonetheless.
Draco takes it—his good manners the one thing he can rely on—and only stops for one very short eternity to marvel on how soft the material is, smooth and pleasantly cool. Draco presses a kiss on it, just because he can.
“You are making that face again,” Blaise says, because he has known Draco all his life and he can see right through Draco’s pathetic lies. “Stop it, it’s depressing.”
don’t feel comfortable kissing you under these circumstances. Is that better?” Draco hopes it is, it’s the best he can do.
It might be the general air of gloom and defeat hanging over the bare trees, or the hushed whispers Draco is trying hard not to hear, but Draco finds his thoughts straying into the lonely-and-depressing department. They might very well freeze to death here, searching for Potter who is already buried under layer after layer or powdery white snow, where they will join him soon. Nothing will be left of them, a smooth surface covering them and their doomed quest.
“Can I have one last fight? Just one, I promise, and then we can be done, then we can have our happy ending.” Potter looks so earnest, pleading with Draco as much as he himself pleaded earlier, asking to be understood and indulged.
“Now now, Malfoy, let's not get violent,” Potter gasps out between his laughter, which Draco would like to react to with a few more kicks, but that wouldn’t help. (It also really hurt his foot, not that that matters. At all.) “I’m sure there is a non-violent solution.”
“Good for you, Malfoy, your parents must be so proud. Now, if you could demonstrate this astounding ability of yours again to leave and be somewhere else.” Weasley motions at the floo, shooing Draco out without much movement.
No, Draco cannot say that. He can barely say it to strangers he neither knows nor cares about but he certainly can’t say it to Weasley and Granger, can’t say it about Potter.
Draco grabs his wand tighter, tries to assess the situation beyond ‘wolves everywhere and no help coming’. He
say Draco would have free reign about the house, no exemption agreed on. Draco is paying a high price for that deal, he wants to get what was promised. But he already offered to regard it as the favour owed, because when confronted with Potter about to fall apart Draco panicked, his brain circuited and he completely forgot the room was already his by all that is right and just.
He knew of course that he was being unreasonable, starting with the least used rooms is a questionable method not only because it means living on basically nothing until almost the end of the renovations, but it also leads to things being rushed and decisions made under pressure — it’s inconvenient all around.
His words don’t quite register with Harry, but that image does. The flimsy attempt at a shield, at protection,
“Potter, wait a second, won’t you let me explain?” It’s useless, of course it is, but Draco has to try.
Draco watches him for a while, debates eavesdropping before deciding that would be rude. In the end, watching Potter work isn’t all that interesting, not for long, not if Draco isn’t allowed to touch. If he could run his fingers through that hair, drape himself over Potter’s shoulders and perhaps even have his own hideous goggles—silver, gold doesn’t suit him half as handsomely as it does Potter—and he could watch him work, nimble fingers and delicate spell work.
the music, lives it and moves it as his hands fly, eyes closed to the world and ears only for the music, for the magic purring in the instrument resting against him, for the notes twirling around him.
Whatever the case, what his father told him, time and time again, was this: know how you want to move through this world and do it, or you might as well surrender your life to someone. And if you don’t think you can move the way you want to, can’t stand with your coat billowing behind you and people watching in awe, can’t do it because you can’t move from the blood spilling from your mouth and your knees shaking from the insistent weight pressing you down, you don’t move at all. (Draco might have paraphrased a bit there, drawn from his own experience. There are things you shouldn’t explain too detailed to children, preparing them for a cruel world or not.) You stand tall, untouchable and imperious, well aware that any attempts to walk would resemble the stumble of a dying fawn, knowing that you can’t drag your feet. You stand tall, and you watch, and you wait, until you find your strength, a way to move on.
, however, a bridge, of sorts. It’s a room after all, if not in the conventional understanding of the word. There are walls, yes, and they are grey and blank and tedious, but there is very little floor, not even a dull one. Instead there is this bridge thing, not thin enough to be worrisome and more of a landing, leading towards the centre of the room.
at Harry, before he realises how utterly inappropriate that is and dims it down a few suns. Harry narrows his eyes at him. What is going on?
Harry kissed him (assaulted, more like, but that's a whole other crisis Harry doesn't have time to have) Malfoy is emphatically
have that conversation, confessing their mutual not-hatred and testing each other’s names on their tongues. Huh, Harry would have sworn there is too much history between them to leave space for the unpredicted intimacy of their given names.
“Merlin, Draco! The Captain is fine, don’t worry about it. Wait a sec,” Harry reaches for something, which Draco regrettably can’t see because he is busy glaring at Harry (or rather, marvelling at the expression of concentration on his face, the little frown and the way he bites his lip — it’s all terribly endearing, don’t tell Pansy he said that).
“What kind of movie is that even? I don’t understand a single one of the things that happened.” Draco isn’t asking, merely ranting his frustrations into the damp earth, as one does. Weasley has proven himself very capable of smelling blood, though, and merciless in its pursuit; it doesn’t matter to him at all whether Draco wants to know more horrific details about their last movie or not—he will narrate the whole thing in graphic detail for Draco’s suffering.
Not alone though, Draco doesn’t want Potter to ever feel alone again. He holds his hand, grabs it tight and hopes that Potter can feel it, wherever he is in that escapist fantasy of his.
“Would you do me the honour of this dance?” A fox asks him, paw expanded in invitation and pretty red fur shinning and shimmering in the flickering light of the fire. Her dress is a shade of pink that goes surprisingly well with her fur, the necklace sitting high on her throat a deep green the shade of Potter’s eyes.
“You want to?” Potter asks, voice bright and hopeful and Draco was wrong when he thought the fight didn’t do him any favours: he looks good like this, hair a mess and falling into his face, something wild and alive about him, choosing to be still for Draco, to not harm him.
And save Potter he does, throwing them both out of the window and hoping that this time, their landing will be together.
“Come on, Malfoy, that was a foul!” Potter shoves his shoulder into him, not looking to see Draco almost fall from the unexpected contact, far too focused on watching the game. A game Draco himself remains inexplicably uninterested in.
Harry has no idea what they are doing, standing still in the corridor while the house around them is bustling with activity, workers following Malfoy’s orders but not disturbing them to ask more inane question as they are wont to (Grimmauld leading them away perhaps? Not that it really matters, as long as they get some more time to stay like this, Harry doesn’t care who he has to thank for it), separated from the rest of the world. It’s oddly intimate, Malfoy’s face pressed into Harry’s neck, his fingers still entangled in his hair, Harry’s arms wound around his ribs, holding him up and close, his face resting on Malfoy’s head, his hair soft against Harry’s skin.
were the one owing a favour.” Draco is mostly teasing, they all know he is, but Pansy doesn’t appreciate it and glares at him. Draco gifts her his most blinding smile.
(Potter also doesn’t point out that Draco’s reputation is already besmirched, that he did more towards that goal than a snide remark of the Lord and Saviour could ever do. Draco is very grateful that they both tactfully avoid his family shame.)
? He came in here to laugh at Malfoy's face, instead he stood rooted to the ground and admired Malfoy’s
, takes something that could have been formal but under-dressed and grounds it into the wild life of defying expectations.
They all stare at Theo now, who has stopped talking in favour of staring at Draco, looking like a world or two has crumbled around him. Draco has no idea what he is talking about. He doesn’t know anything, least of all right now, so what does Theo mean?  The world is neatly separated — in Draco, who has all the questions, and Theo, who has all the answers.
“What did you say about the kitchen, when are you going to refurnish it?” Harry asks, glaring at his uncooperative chair.
“It was delicious, thank you.” Potter smiles at him, as if they didn’t both witness him dying to eat that biscuit.
Then, he remembers that he isn’t supposed to see Draco in the night before their wedding, which is not only superstitious nonsense but also
The symbolism of his offer is not something Draco plans on sharing. Symbolism, if done well, doesn’t need to be explained. If Harry can’t figure it out on his own, perhaps Draco overestimated him. That was never one of his problem though. If anything, Draco
“Fine, calm down, Malfoy. Ron found a stray, alright? The poor thing was all drenched and shivering and Ron couldn’t just walk past, could he? If Hermione wasn’t allergic he would have kept it at their place, but what else was he supposed to do?” All of this, except Ron’s weakness for strays, is a lie, delivered in the most innocently annoyed tone Harry can manage.
“Don’t sulk now, tell me about the dragon!” Harry is practically begging, pouting at Draco with his green eyes wide and imploring. It’s not fair, those eyes, and Draco can feel himself giving in. Well, at least it’s an entertaining tale. Plus, it’s better than contemplating Harry's possible acquaintance with his mother.
Draco doesn’t tell her that, either. He doesn’t want to be lectured about how she knew all along that things would work out just fine, that they would fall in love and forget all about the practical reasons they claim to have married for. Draco doesn’t want to hear it.
Draco figures it’s more than fair that he hides, too. Harry is a very good person to hide behind, very accommodating aside from the low chuckle that Draco is content to ignore.
If Harry wants to convince him, wants to confess to his crimes in all their shocking depth, Ron first has to believe him capable. There is no way for that to happen, unless Ron experiences it for himself.
“I didn’t want things to change between us. I was scared — I thought if I told you that I wasn’t ready to meet your friends …” Draco trails off, the words getting lost in shame. His fingers dig painfully into Harry’s shoulder and ribs, as if worried he would leave after that confession, and while Harry burns up with the need to know what Draco was going to say, reassuring him is more important. Harry couldn't define what kind of miracle they found here, the incredible ability of simple touch being so all-encompassing, but he intents to exploit it to its fullest.
spun tight between them and ripped before it could pull them together, but he also gets to watch Potter so he doesn’t feel too bereft.
Civil, right, that’s not what I would call it. You have been snappy and unreasonable ever since I apologised. Did you not like the apology, is that it? Was it not flashy enough for you? Not enough grand gestures and raining roses?
and he fills the room with his careless arrogance that easily crowds Draco against the outer corners, pushing and shoving and leaving him no room to breathe and think, to remember what Blaise said in the looming darkness of Potter’s expectations.
, no need to make such a big deal out of a perfectly lovely creature.” As if that wasn’t Potter’s plan, stepping up from ferrets and making them larger when he didn’t get the reaction he desired out of Draco. He isn’t even subtle about it, glancing at Draco and then away before looking again, as if that is less obvious than staring outright.
“Nonsense, it’s brilliant! I figured out how to convince Potter to give me that interview.” That finally gets everyone's attention, Pansy and Blaise even deigning to put their argument on hold.
Second, and this is more important, why are all his friends so mean? Draco is sacrificing his time to help Theo prepare and
owns them, I want nothing to do with them! They are pure evil, no matter what you say. One of them snug into my closet and pissed on all my clothes, Pansy! It smelled appalling for ages!” Draco remembers that particular find, odious bastard number one proudly sitting in its mess and every single thing Draco owned drenched in the stench. “I made Potter promise to get them descented, that is apparently the only way to prevent it from happening again. It also gets rid of the constant musty scent clinging to them.”
“Potter no! Please, no more!” Begging is neither dignified nor appropriate, but these are desperate times! Draco will make an exception.
“I’m sorry about that,” Potter says, embarrassed but sincere, shuffling his paws on the cobblestone. “It was a stupid idea. I thought—I don’t know what I though, that it would be romantic? It always seemed that way in the movie. They don’t end up kissing, it’s a very close thing and I thought, well, I thought if I couldn’t kiss you, I could at least have the anticipation of it.”
They can’t stay here forever, they have stories to tell and boxes to pack, but just for a moment, Draco can allow Harry, too, to hide from the world.
“Pansy is family to me. You don't understand what that means to me, but I can promise that you would regret it should you ever hurt her. The war might be over, and I might have been pardoned, but I was a Death-Eater. You cannot imagine the things I witnessed and learnt, and not with all your reports of survivals and books on dark magic do you have an inkling of what I can — and
Potter narrows his eyes at him, the fire dying as the winds begin to howl, and Draco thinks he might have summoned the monster waiting here for him. Then again, the monster has always been Potter, hasn’t he? Potter who pulled his hand back and feels like he could be standing at the other end of the world, so deep is the sudden distance between them.
Potter is smiling, bright and excited, barely standing still and grinning from ear to ear. Draco forgets that smile isn’t what he was supposed to look at and only remembers when Potter’s smile turns into a smirk, one eyebrow raised in the ultimate sign of benevolent amusement. Draco quickly looks away, escaping the mortification and shutting it down before he can begin to blush (that is the last thing he needs, to look like a pale crab next to Potter, the literal embodiment of the sun).
Not dwelling on that frightening prospective further, Draco pulls them both up and creates some distance too, for good measure. They had a purpose in coming here, and it wasn’t to experience the fresh air .
Potter is quick to anger, temper flaring hot and high, but he is at least as good in regret and feelings of guilt and—if Draco’s suspicion should be correct—self-loathing. Potter is quick to shout at those nearest, whether they are loved or important political figures, and if that means he hurts someone dear Potter will need a long time to forgive himself over it. He didn’t yell at Draco, not really, but the sentiment was close enough, his eyes cold and words hissed, that Draco feels justified in counting himself among the friends jilted.
That is precisely where things are getting complicated, though. Malfoy doesn’t seem interested in a repeat performance.
?” Harry sounds so pained by the idea, far more affected than Draco expected him to be, his hand falling down, useless. It reminds him of Pansy, insisting that Draco should be proud of who he is, should celebrate it. Draco has heard enough of it.
“Well, yes, a bit. I know you… learnt some things about yourself and that you are still struggling with it all — I honestly don’t understand half of it. And that is okay! I don’t have to understand it all to respect your boundaries, you don’t need to justify anything! But I still didn’t understand it, and then I find you looking at porn, and I thought that changed everything I had just figured out, but it doesn’t, does it? It’s perfectly normal, everyone does it, why would I freak out over that? I
himself alone, overwhelmed with the world and unable to exist within it, but Draco knows he is wrong. Potter very much
“Why do we have to have this discussion over a board of chess?” Draco moves one of his pawns, one of the left ones. Theo snorts but otherwise doesn’t comment.
“More complicated than it is now, you mean?” Ron asks, dry as dust, and yes fine, he might have a point there. Looking at how things are now, it truly cannot get anymore complicated than that.
Ron specifically begun with old family recipes, learning them over many days spent in the kitchen with Molly, cooking together through the grief and loss the war brought upon them. Ron gradually tested his own recipes, exploiting Harry and Hermione as his personal guinea pigs and forcing them to smile at even the most vile concoctions lest they want to destroy his fledging hopes, using their feedback to adjust and perfect every dish before presenting it Saturday Family Dinner.
“I'm not sure if the next years were coloured by my judgement or if you really were that insufferable, but it all screamed of the cousin I hated.” Harry stops again, and this time it feels more monumental, more final than the other times. Harry isn’t pausing to order his next thoughts, Harry is done talking.
“Perhaps I didn’t recognise you then, that hair of yours looks as wild as any plant.” Draco is very aware he is conceding ground, thank you. It doesn’t matter as much as it should, Potter ecstatic in his triumph and Draco’s doom inevitable the moment he decided to argue for the obvious lie. He usually possesses better instincts than that. (One could argue that he still has pretty good instincts, if they lead to Potter being happy, but Draco doubts that his rhetoric teachers would agree with him there.)
apprehensive, almost like he might be looking forward to it, purely for the discomfort it would cause Draco.
Draco opens his eyes, braced for the vague possibility of anything, which in the end means he isn’t prepared at all. For anything.
How is Draco meant to say no to that? Stronger men than him have failed when faced with Potter, no one could blame him for giving in, for giving them what they both want. Hell, they might even congratulate him! This much tension, it can’t be good for them. Draco finds himself consumed with the thought of Potter, kissing him, making him laugh, see how that smile tastes against his mouth—it would be best for efficiency if Draco would kiss the man, quell his desire at least as long as it takes to get him out of his mind.
Because Potter wants to be saved—such a simple fact, such a huge effect—pulling him up actually works. Or perhaps Draco pulls himself down? It doesn’t matter, Draco gets them closer together and Potter doesn’t roar in pain, doesn’t take his arm off with sharp teeth. Lions are just bigger cats, in the end, aren’t they?
He crawls away, like a wounded Kneazle—limping and covered in blood but proudly presenting some disgusting present for the shocked people allowed to live in his house—and vaguely, through the booming headache and teetering vision, hopes that his pursuer needs a fair bit longer to recover than he does.
“Ha! See, it does make sense to keep the couch! We need somewhere to sit, Draco, keeping it is stuffed so full of sense it’s close to bursting.” Harry’s hands mimic what Draco assumes to be an explosion, the wide grin on his face at odds with the tragedy he is acting out. It’s all very endearing and distracting from the argument they are having. Draco scowls at him and his stupid nonsense point.
“Because he is valued here regardless of his objective utility to the situation,” Granger says to calm her near hysteric boyfriend, before adding, rather pointedly like Draco needed the unsubtle nod to understand the warning: “Unlike some other, whose continued presence is tied to their skill and bedside manners.”
Sometimes Harry proves in the most uncanny ways how well they have gotten to know each other since their ill-advised idea to marry; him walking straight up to Capt'n and gently taking her from her treasure trove of books and sparkly stones is one of these moments.
Could he? It didn’t feel that way when Potter yelled at him. It felt pretty unfair. They were never close during Hogwarts, how was Draco to know he was
Well then, this is as close to a blessing as Draco needs! He takes the violin off its place on the wall, soothes the magic fluttering over its surface and takes a bow. He didn’t mean to
“Then we’ll play a game. I always wanted to beat you, all those rumours about how good you are, unbeatable and all that crap—we can talk while we play a round.” Weasley is gone before Draco can protest, hunting down a board Draco has no idea what to do with. Well, at least he can get some answers, if he manages to prolong his misery long enough to ask a few prying questions.
It’s nice, better than mindlessly hurling around words or whatever is close enough to reach in an attempt to burn the energy racing through his veins. Harry doesn’t know how Malfoy does it, standing rooted to the spot should be the opposite of helpful, but Malfoy’s concern feels like a soft blanket wrapped around him, comfort sinking through Harry’s tense muscles and warming him to his core. Malfoy’s movements are careful, tender, sliding over Harry’s head and draining him of the itching of his restless nerves.
“I wanted to help—” Draco begins, trying to soothe the beast he freed, but Potter is beyond reason, fury barely held back by his grip on the counter.
“Yep, fully aware. Now go on, up you get. We’ll wait down here.” Weasley drops down into the grass, making his place between flowers—since when have there been flowers here?—and pulling Granger down besides him, fitting her against his side like they have always been sitting like this, comfortable and familiar.
“I have been very patient with you” — Potter snorts, Draco graciously ignores him — “and I allowed all those ferrets you moved in, but there is a line here, Potter.
Draco doesn’t want to hear it. Yes, Potter’s support of a dying team is endearing and yes, Draco loves to see the concentration on his face but he sat still and admired for long enough today.
know how to set a nose—Potter puts his own hands on Draco’s nose (nice and big and warm and Draco wishes he would be cradling his jaw and not his nose with these glorious hands) and then Potter makes an odd, jerky motion, and the pain in Draco’s nose shoots up far beyond what Draco thought possible.
Given all that, it’s extremely embarrassing that Harry can’t seem to escape Draco’s attack. To be fair though, this is not exactly a situation Aurors are trained for. All Harry can do is gasp for air and hope that maybe, if he is very lucky, his wild flailing will actually land a hit and shove Draco off of him.
“Sorry, it’s just—” Potter laughs, swallows it badly and hiccups it back up. “You should have seen your face, you looked so pained!”
it’s Potter—cut dark against the sinking sun and twisting into what might be called dancing, if one were generous. (Draco, as a rule, is
“Boring!” Potter slams his cup on the table with enough force that Draco is worried about it breaking, for a moment, but Potter has always had a temper and knows to prepare for it. “How do you think I should live my life then, if it’s so
This is exactly why Draco never bothered to learn, never took Theo up on his offers of teaching him. It’s all so incredibly
It leaves Draco at a loose end, no conversation possible with a Potter who is determined. (One might point out that
Potter makes a muffled noise against the table, head resting on the unforgiving surface, hair thrown around him like a black halo, one arm laid out on the table like he is reaching for Draco.
“How can he be lost? It’s his own mind, shouldn’t he know his way around there?” Weasley asks, once again proving that he shouldn’t be allowed to speak.
“I apologise.” There, that wasn’t so difficult. Draco means the words, fully aware that they sound like a cheap trinket given when you couldn’t care less but it would look bad to do nothing. Draco
“My father changed first, became secretive and withdrawn, brooding for hours in front of the fire and going on ever longer walks. I don’t know for sure what occupied his thoughts, if he was planning a war or seeking a way out for all of us. I don’t think I want to know. Either way, he fell in His favour, so all of us did. I watched my father — proud and imposing and confident, the man I always admired and yearned approval from, who could do absolutely anything once he set his mind to it — dwindle into an unkempt husk that I barely recognised, bowing his head and kissing dirty feet.” Harry remembers that, remembers feeling gratified at seeing the arrogant twat fall so far from grace. He thought it was well-deserved and overdue, that finally Lucius' outside matched his insides. Hearing Draco talk about him like that, talk about his
“For the record, I would have helped you if I thought you were in actual danger. You are just being dramatic now.” Draco would like to argue that being dramatic is far from the insult Potter seems to intend it as (what a dull thing would life be without some drama?) but Potter rudely continues on before he gets the chance. “What do you want to discuss ? I seem to remember things all being very simple.”
if she wants his help in this, and she hates it. Draco waits, watches as Pansy reconsiders how important her pride is against whatever she wants from him. “Please, Draco.”
“Oh I couldn’t possibly decide now — how about a favour?” Dealing in favours is dangerous business, even when you don’t have Slytherins to consider, but Harry desperately wants Malfoy to owe him a favour and he agrees before his worry can catch up with his exhilaration.
Harry hopes Draco won’t be so spooked as to insist on separated beds again; Harry rather likes sleeping with Draco at his side. Most mornings, he even enjoys waking up to the git.
“Wait, further?” Draco feels slightly bad for breaking their moment—a moment of affection that did not want to be broken, unlike the one between Granger and himself—but the words are out before he can stop them.
But dinner is done now, Blaise said so himself, so Draco sees no reason to put up with it any longer.
“If I wanted your input on this, I would have asked. I would appreciate it if you could take your opinion and —” Draco turns around to face Pansy and tell her exactly what she ought to do with her rude opinion, when he freezes.
He grew fond of them, somewhere between Granger intimidating him into compliance and Weasley laughing at him for having to climb a tower, Draco started to count them as friends. How is he supposed to tell them he couldn’t save their best friend?
Draco graciously doesn’t point out how irresponsible he was. He is all too aware that his own behaviour these past days has been… questionable, and he would prefer not to shackle them both to what they did wrong. There is nowhere to go but down if they stay here, and there are only two ways of getting far away.
(Harry would have called it superstition, but Draco talked right over his commentary, too convinced to listen to anyone else) and a whole lot of other nonsense that amounts to not one reason for this insanity, except that that is how it’s always been done. Never a good argument, but if it’s the only argument you have it’s a sure sign things need to change.
Potter stares at him as if it should be obvious, as if Draco is the crazy one for questioning this insane plan. (Draco gets the impression he shouldn’t have asked, should have said no and shut Potter down before he can reason this insanity.)
the game—how would you know you won?” Potter asks, as if there aren’t cheering Harpies fans all around. Draco throws him a wink over his shoulder.
“Why exactly couldn’t you have written the address down for me?” Potter asks, pulling his hat deeper over his face. It’s meant to protect his identity on this highly dangerous trip into town, but in reality it’s the very thing drawing attention to them. Draco tried explaining this to him, but Potter remained stubborn. Draco counts himself lucky that he could persuade him away from the sunglasses and that is that.
“That Act makes exceptions for injured animals taken in with the intend of caring for them,” Ron declares confidently, which probably means that yes, it
. Theo is the only one not drunk, smart and responsible, so they all listen to him. “I’m not an expert, and I don’t think I explained it properly, but it’s not about desires either. It’s about attraction, about looking at someone and seeing a sexual being. As I said, there’s a spectrum, all kinds of shades between those completely fine with sex, enjoying it even, and those who get sick just thinking about sex in the abstract. I don’t think I'm the right person to be talking about this, I just read a few books. I can recommend you the books, though, if you want to read them for yourself.”
kitchen? Whatever happened to our marital bliss and the sharing of property?” Potter clutches one hand to his chest in a crude allusion to being wounded, every over-drawn inch the picture of a husband let down and hurt. Potter is
“Yeah well, that’s because I finally made a decision and I feel really good about it.” Potter shoots him a lewd wink, the kind of expression not fit for polite company (Isn’t Draco polite company? Why is he being subjected to this?) and Draco might not know much about any of this, but it’s impossible to misunderstand its intention.
It’s probably his wondrous talent to see but not understand that led to him agreeing to have tea with Draco and his mother.
There are indeed children, and parents to the children, and people walking their dogs. It’s all very normal and very pleasant and Draco almost wishes he hadn’t corrected Potter, just to see how far he’d be willing to go to desecrate this pleasant normality. They are magic, they could have found a way to make sure they wouldn’t be interrupted.
(He also—he couldn’t help but notice—is a strutting mountain of muscle, wearing ineffective armour and a skirt so short it might just as well not be there. Draco feels ridiculous, off-balance in this body that isn’t his, but he assumes Potter did this on purpose, to match the hero from this movie. He only hopes Potter will appreciate the efforts it takes Draco not to fall.)
“I think my parents never quite got used to them, though they didn't admit their discomfort again. I wasn't bothered at all, and my friends were all quite jealous; I soon forgot about the unsavoury people who sent them. I dressed them up in elegant robes that I made my parents commission and I held tea parties for them, where they entertained Capt’n and told her all of the latest gossip, talked about books and magic and the first flowers of the year.” Draco doesn’t tell him that they also talked about the great hero Harry Potter. Harry doesn’t need to know that.
them, motivates and inspires them, pulls them all along in that whirlwind of energy that surrounds her. Yeah, Ginny would be brilliant at engaging Draco in the conversation. In fact, Harry is reasonably sure that they would be brilliant together, Draco and Ginny, they would get along really well. It wouldn’t end well for Harry, because Draco made it his goal in life to make Harry suffer on ever more creative ways (lately that has been achieved by switching labels on all kinds of spices and ingredients he
“Don’t worry about it, Malfoy, didn’t work in the movie either,” Weasley says, now from Draco’s shoulder—when did he get his slimy tongue this close to Draco’s ear?—as if Potter hadn’t stomped on Draco’s self-esteem, as if he hadn’t promised Draco flirting with Potter would be his way out, his way to save the proud git and move on to the next movie.
“If you didn’t what?” Interrogation it is, then — study the new life form, like an insect, caught and observed before being pinned and dissected. Draco doesn’t answer. What is there to say?
Potter glares at him, which is the best answer Draco could have asked for. He takes Draco’s cup right out of his hands—which is
the furniture. Your magic would interfere with their own charms and spells and concoct something dreadful.” Malfoy nods along decisively, already leading them out of the kitchen as he talks. Harry, because apparently he is an idiot and doesn’t even attempt to think of a good excuse, follows him.
Draco wonders what he wants now, half dreading hearing it and half curious. It will be about their Situation, of that much he is sure; Potter might have some brilliant new idea of how to fix it. Unlikely, yes, but Draco needs some delusions to get through this.
Harry sees Draco in every room they pass, sees him hiding smiles behind books and frowning at his plans, trying to teach the ferrets tricks or sneaking sweets out of the secret storages he installed all over the house and didn’t think Harry knew about. He sees Draco laughing and happy, sees him how he only knew him for a short time, and Harry aches with how much he wants to go back.
“Well, I already have a couch — one I won’t give up under the thread of disembowelment so don’t even try — and I assume you have something fancy that fits perfectly with the curtains in one of the idle guest rooms picked out already? Which is good, we are going to need the extra space. I assume someone will end up on the floor anyway, but that can’t be helped. We then need to arrange the couches so you can see the TV from everywhere in the room, and no second row because you don’t want to see the squabble
Harry doesn’t know what it would be like, if he had a portrait of his family, of his parents. He would like to say that he wouldn’t comprise who he is, that he wouldn’t abandon all logic to tradition, but he knows that isn’t true. If Harry had a portrait of his parents he would do whatever it took to make them proud.
“You have a castle here, Potter?” Draco asks—again like an imbecile, he doesn’t like this trend—because he didn’t know this but it seems like pertinent information one might like to share.
need me to explain this to you?” Weasley asks, making as meaningful eye contact as possible for a chameleon sitting far too close.
“Yes, I thought we established that? In case it wasn’t clear, I don’t want to talk about this night ever again.” Malfoy doesn’t sounds nearly as happy as Harry about the news — which, yeah, could be the late hour, Harry isn’t thrilled about that either — grumbling and sulking.
Harry lets go as Malfoy jerks back, looking flabbergasted and suspiciously red. Harry doesn’t know if he should feel disgusted that he kissed Malfoy at all or disappointed that he didn’t impress Malfoy. He usually is a much better kisser than this, he swears!
“Still ready to elope with me?” he asks, tone light enough that it might be written of as a joke. Draco knows it isn’t, knows it to be true because he remembers what Potter looked like when Draco first proposed it, that same cautious hope on his face.
On the bright side, this means Draco will be the one to introduce Potter to the wicked pleasures of the flesh, drag their Golden Boy into frivolity and sin. To say that Draco isn’t beyond thrilled at the prospect would be a poor lie.
Draco blinks, blinks again, but sure enough, there he stands, Weasley grinning at him from the shape of a bear. He is standing upright, dressed in green linen and wearing a ridiculous hat.
anything, yet. It was Ron, all Ron, who did the work. He pulled Harry out, herded him onto his couch, and pressed the tea into his hands, filling the silence so Harry’s feet stayed on the ground.
Potter’s other hand remains on his shoulder, sadly, but Draco can work with this. (Besides, confidentially, Draco isn’t sure his heart could handle
Harry really can’t blame his friends either. He can’t expect them be rushing to make Draco feel welcome while Draco turns his hideout into a throne. And he would, Harry knows Draco a fair bit better these days than he ever did, and he knows with stone cold certainty that that is what Draco would do.
“I don’t think that would be a good idea,” Draco says, even as it almost kills him. He is proud that his voice doesn’t waver, one last dignity retained.
—interrupts them, just when Harry might have gotten all his nerves together to lean forward and kiss Malfoy.
“Did you find out anything useful about that ward or did you just want to look important?” Harry asks, quickly changing the subject and latching on to the new problem to obsess over. Anything is better than to keep leering at Malfoy.
He isn’t stupid, he does have a pretty good idea of it (Parkinson all snuggled up to his husband, doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out) but that doesn’t make any sense. Draco is not only gay (Harry
Draco has enough of this confusion, of asking stupid questions and being looked at with pity. He doesn’t want to wonder anymore, to question what it means that he doesn't understand that basic emotion, such an essential part of humanity. It’s all gone on long enough, Draco will pull himself together and get on with it already, no more hesitating and stalling. He is a married man now, it’s expected of him to share his body, the distance he always kept no longer a virtue.
who started these night-time wanderings in the first place.” Malfoy is moving again, closer towards the bed, the sounds growing louder. Harry thinks he can almost see him now, his hair shining like a beacon.
“Okay, so, that was ugly. And then Potter threw you out?” Pansy asks, breaking the silence that settled in after Draco told her about the fight. Well, a heavily edited version of it; Draco doesn’t tell her how this could have been avoided if he had kept his mouth shut and born it, if he had just kept on doing what he had perfected over the months. He didn’t tell her that it’s his fault, that he is still broken.
“Rescue is a rescue mate, and that is how they do it in the movie. Pretty sure he used arrows to climb his way up; it looked painful.” Weasley grins at him, delighting in making this more and more difficult. He probably looks forward to Draco’s inevitable fall, getting his chance to dunk water over him after all when Draco knocks himself out.
Potter is looking more and more frustrated with every word Draco says, a fact he only notices when it might already be too late because he was too busy appraising the dishwasher thing with criticising looks.
reluctant. Marrying Potter isn’t exactly a burden—good for the tarnished reputation—and almost feasible, if it weren’t for that tiny, mortifying crush Draco used to have on the git.
Potter though, as he has a habit of doing, defies Draco’s expectations. There is a spark there, irritation, that was meant to grow into something bigger, something more consuming. But it doesn’t, doesn’t explode into one of Potter’s temper tantrums. No, it … vanishes, sinks back down into the haze of Potter’s green eyes, leaving behind the placid stranger Draco can’t stand.
Now Potter is here, intruding on Draco’s space when he should be sleeping, looking like death warmed over, and he won’t stop
“But this is brilliant!” Malfoy doesn't answer in favour of keeping up his muttering, though it's nothing Harry can easily make out and he doesn’t care enough to ask about it. “That means Grimmauld at long last stopped with the blatant favouritism!”
Harry remembers every fight they had, the deals they made, and how hard Draco fought against it all.
It makes no sense that it should have been so comfortable, felt so right. It makes no sense that Draco should already yearn for the moment back.
Narcissa smiles softly at them, and if Harry needed any more convincing that this was a good idea, this would have been it.
Draco nods, gaining his hand and only glaring at the smug git once it’s back safely on his side on the table.
cups that keep anything in them at the perfect temperature. Apparently, Harry still sometimes has the tendency to behave like a tourist in the wizarding world, fawning over the most normal things and falling for the biggest trash, taking his picture with everything to make the moment immortal, and then forget about it in some dusty box on a high shelf.
But Harry doesn’t grant him time, nothing more than what he already allowed. If Draco could judge this situation objectively, he would probably agree that he had plenty of time to come up with
, just a different kind of hurt) were it not for the thunder, growling low in the distance. Thunder isn’t sadness, isn’t the petty act of covering the sun in clouds. It’s anger, volatile and reaching, loud and intense.
“Fine, I’ll get Parkinson that date, but she better not hurt them because I swear to whatever scares you the most, Malfoy, if she hurts them —” Potter trails off, out of words or aware that he doesn’t need impressively worded threats to make himself intimidating. He has quite the fearsome glower — only to be expected after the hell he went through, Draco supposes, one picks up certain things when being hailed as the first defender against evil — green eyes narrowed at Draco and something dark lurking in them, something that says clearly that his friends are not to be touched. That Draco would sorely regret it should he hurt them.
“So you want to have sex, that is what you are saying?” Potter asks, because apparently this isn’t excruciating enough yet. It also shows that Potter didn’t listen to him at all, because Draco said nothing about
has to offer. Miraculously, she breathes all while maintaining the facade responsible fairness, a feature proudly shown of by her parents.
It’s a ridiculous and unproductive thought, and Harry decides to ignore it and follow his instincts. The worst that could happen is that Draco doesn’t want Harry to hug him and he finds himself at the wrong end of a nasty hex, but at least then Harry knows where he stands.
“Probably for the best. This is Sleeping Beauty, you know? There are three very fussy fairies here that would
, but no self-respecting Wizard should eschew the proud tradition of tea for the bitter swill, only half bearable if you add milk and sugar in indecent measures. No, Draco brings tea or he brings nothing at all.
It needs to be something safe, something that won’t set Potter off on the next fright—or worse! If only they were already friends and Draco knew what Potter likes to do as a diversion, which subjects are safe to talk about. He knows nothing, though, except that Potter apparently developed an appreciation for music—which Draco would love to ask about but fears veers into a darkness Potter pulled himself out of just enough to build this—and that he doesn’t admit to liking the plants Draco brings him.
“I also know the kindness in people. I know their warmth and their love and that they try, that they are reasonable creatures. People are
“I’m talking to you, yes!” The man points a finger at Harry, as if his shouting and glaring wasn’t enough to clue
“Of course, Saint Potter can’t let people think so badly of themselves. Go on, then, explain to me how I’m not broken.” Now it’s Harry who is holding on to Draco, keeping him from avoiding this conversation any longer.
Draco doesn’t like them, even if this is indeed how they are done, this stammering and flailing and the constant ache to
“I thought Slytherins were supposed to be smart and opportunistic—how have you not figured this out yet?” Weasley sounds like he might drop into a long monologue of anti-Slytherin sentiments and Draco glares at him to remind him that he might currently be a bit helpless, but that underestimating and mocking him would be a grave mistake. “Alright, sensitive topic, got it. It’s simple though: you need to convince Harry that you being free would be better for him than you being bound.”
Weasley, it seems, understands perfectly fine that Draco would rather see him gone. He puffs up, like an angry cockatoo severely overestimating how intimidating he looks. It’s the hair, ginger clashes unflatteringly with the indignant flush colouring his cheeks.
tables. Malfoy claimed the biggest bathroom and the master bedroom (which Harry didn’t want anyway, but this is a matter of principle and Malfoy ought to at least have
Potter looks at his books, gives it a few cursory shakes, and turns his frown up at Draco. He reached all the wrong conclusions from his stumbling tests; Draco should have expected that.
to brush his hair back or straighten his clothes (or put on some new ones, these are wrinkled and loose as if he slept in them), which only serves to make his appearance more intriguing.
If Draco doesn’t trust him, how did they get as close as they are? What about the first name thing, about the hugs and the soft smiles and the elaborate breakfast? What about when Harry told Draco about Sirius and how they sleep in the same bed ever since Grimmauld froze them into compliance? They never said anything about trust, but Harry does trust Draco. He doesn’t know since when or how but he trusts him implicitly. He thought Draco trusts him, as well. He certainly hoped so.
In the end, they placed all of the bowls, almost none of the cups, a good half of the spoons—because you can’t just jam them all in there, Jesus, Malfoy!—and most of the plates in the dishwasher. They agreed for that to be the most effective use of the space they have and closed the dishwasher perhaps more forcefully than necessary.
be, knows what he wants to say and ask and know. Harry knows what he’s missing — he just doesn’t know how to reach it.
. It’s quite offensive, really. Still not the point though, so Harry doesn’t comment. And if he wants to hear what Malfoy has to say, well, his interest is purely academic. You can’t change someone's mind if you don’t understand their logic.
Potter nods, almost eager now that he has his promise. He pulls at his hair, once, twice, and the ties come loose, falling off the chair and around Draco. It doesn’t make sense, no secret mechanism that Potter could have planned at while strapping Draco in, but Draco isn’t going to question the workings of his freedom. This is Potter’s mind, anything that happens here is because he wants it to, not because it makes any sort of sense.
Harry doesn’t know why Draco sought to hide his fondness for cheap gossip magazines (actually, no, Harry wouldn’t want anyone to know, either, if he was the one reading garbage for entertainment), but leafing through it all will not only make Harry lose faith in humanity, but also not help their situation at all. It’s much worse than Harry thought already.
“You didn’t follow the plot,” Potter points out, grumpy and not polite enough to hide it and thank Draco for the rescue.
“Here, that should help,” Potter whispers and Draco wants to lie, wants to tell him not to be arrogant and that Potter isn’t a miracle cure, but then Potter lays something soft and cool onto his forehead, something that curves against him and covers his eyes and quietens the entire world and Draco is proven wrong: Potter
This is shockingly easy. For obvious reasons (what with all of them having gone through a war and quickly coming to value the virtue of constant vigilance), Harry would have expected sneaking up on Malfoy to be a lot more difficult. Maybe that is just one of the perks of growing up pampered and adored, the absolute faith that he is safe and protected in his sleep. It’s hard to imagine that not even sharing his house with
, the surprise and bewilderment. No one could have predicted the snow and the forest, but that Potter wouldn’t be awaiting them in a well-organised library is no surprise.
“If you had evolved past the caveman behaviour, you would have realised there are plenty of ways to strike an accord and satisfy the demands of the ward,” Malfoy hisses at him, still furiously blushing but angry enough to glare again. It would be hilarious, if it didn’t also mean another deal with Malfoy. That makes everything less amusing.
“Anywhere specific you want to go?” Ron asks, the question pulling Harry out of the swamp of regret and self-loathing he was all too happy to wallow in.
Draco’s hard work would go to waste because of one very wrong assumption: the roof would afford them all the space the need.
Harry releases Draco, vague ideas of apologies and explanations on his tongue, but none of them relevant as the adrenaline fades and he collapses onto the bed.
Granted, Draco doesn't look like a man on the brink of an epiphany that will improve his life. No, Draco looks like a man struggling in despair to hold all the pieces together before he shatters. Sometimes, though, that is exactly what needs to happen, something needs to break to be put back together better, stronger.
“The bruise doesn’t suit you,” Potter says from behind him, appearing suddenly and startling Draco into coughing up his tea.
“Oh Draco, no seduction? Do you plan on wallowing in your love and being miserable about it, then? Do you want to get spectacularly drunk and tell me all about it?” Pansy doesn’t even possess the decency of pretending to be perturbed by the prospect of Draco breaking his own heart before Potter can do it, far too eager to have an excuse to get Draco drunk and make a fool out of himself. How are they friends?
There is an odd expression on Malfoy’s face, not smug at having found something vulnerable and precious to Harry, not determined to strut in and break it. Malfoy looks … concerned? It’s hard to tell with the walls shaking around and — oh, they aren’t supposed to do that, are they? It’s not Grimmaulds doing, either, Harry realises, thoughts thick and slow as treacle. This is
Harry frowns at him, follows the movement of Draco’s hand, and frowns some more. Draco quickly pulls his hand back. Then Harry’s eyes light up in understanding, and he laughs, not at Draco, he doesn’t think, and Draco feels a bit less stupid.
