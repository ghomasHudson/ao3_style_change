“Of course,” Draco nodded, smirking mischievously. “After all,
…right?
“Well...” Teddy took a deep breath, smiling sheepishly as he shrugged one shoulder. “Actually, his name is Garfield Lasagnaface McWhiskers. But I think he’d prefer just going by Gary.”
“He is my friend,” Luna said, gazing intently at Harry. “He is quite busy. In fact, we only ever spend quiet moments together, tea and dinner. I have invited him to our group outings but he has always had other obligations and denied the invitations.”
?” Ginny snickered.
“Harry!” Teddy called out as he and George reached him, an excited grin splitting his godson’s lips. “Did you see me? I flew, and I caught George,
Gary meowed, crouching close to the ground and shifting his hips as he prepared to jump. With a graceful movement, he leapt into the air and landed lightly on Harry’s shoulder, nipping at his ear.
“He is,” Harry nodded, grinning broadly as he watched his godson toss the quaffle through the hoop behind Ron, thrusting one fist into the air as he cheered in victory. He stood up, clapping as he cheered. “Great job, Teddy!”
Chuckling, the man nodded, reaching for his wand and waving it before the barrier. It shivered, a small archway forming at the bottom. With a flick of its tail, the Kneazle gracefully leapt from its perch, landing on all four paws in front of the archway, before striding through it and stopping at Teddy’s feet, gazing up with curious green eyes.
“Oh. Alright,” Harry nodded quickly, chewing at his bottom lip and shoving his hands awkwardly into his jeans pockets. “Well, er...I suppose I’ll see you another time, then.”
He is my mirror—
“Harry—“Andromeda started, placing a hand on Teddy’s shoulder and trying to pull him back as she stepped toward Malfoy and Harry.
Talented.
“You. This.” Malfoy gestured to the entirety of the room. “A few weeks ago you were so sure that I was in the wrong, that it was

It felt like
Harry laughed, kneeling down and wrapping his arms around Teddy as he collided with him. “Yes, well I didn’t have anything else to do this morning, so why not spend extra time with my favorite godson?”
Ginny let out a snort of laughter, her hand flying towards her mouth to prevent any wine from spilling in her mirth.
Harry laughed, summoning Teddy’s training broom and his
You close your eyes, trying to remember. It’s all a blur, images hazy through the inferno—

Harry snarled at the sudden accusation, sparking back into action. “What

Your lips curl, satisfied, and you turn, running a hand through sweat dampened hair as you roll your hips, losing yourself to the pulse of the music.

Draco rolled his eyes, snorting out a rather undignified huff of laughter. “I’m fine, Weasel. Scurry along now, why don’t you?”
You huff a choked laugh, tears wetting your eyes as you frantically look around the darkened room. “You’re not, Potter. I don’t need—I don’t
“Brilliant.”
“Ginny asked me to help with the camp. They needed someone here in case of—” Jesse chuckled, his voice deep and rich, and Harry frowned. “Well, in case of something like this happening. Although I am certain that she suspected I would need to tend to the children, not to two grown wizards.” He winked at Draco before turning to offer his hand to Harry.
Malfoy had. But surely, if Teddy’s reactions were anything to go by, they couldn’t be that bad.
You curl in a ball, clutch your knees to your chest.
Slowly, Teddy nodded, “Okay. I’m ready.”
Morning light filtered in through a crack in the curtains, casting a soft glow throughout the room.
They both pushed off from the ground, shooting into the air. Teddy’s broom hovered a few feet above the gardens, limited by the training charms embedded in it. Harry circled above him for a moment before making his way to Teddy’s side.
Harry finished washing the dishes and took a moment to gather himself as he dried his hands against the kitchen towel. Taking a deep breath, he placed the damp towel on top of the counter before following the sound of laughter to the sitting room.
“Yes, right. Any time,” Harry mumbled. Draco gave him one last inquisitive glance. He turned to kiss Teddy and Andromeda once more on the cheek before gracefully grasping a handful of Floo powder and stepping into the flames.
...that will strengthen those bonds for Teddy. And he would be trying to strengthen them as well?”
Harry licked his lips, inhaling sharply as he stared at plush lips. “Draco, I—”
You rest your head against a strong shoulder, eyes flickering until you meet vibrant green—
. The garden was silent for an endless moment.
“Oh, Potter,” Malfoy heaved an exasperated sigh, running nimble fingers through his pale hair. Harry watched as the strands fell from Malfoy’s grasp, wondering briefly what they might feel like as they slipped between his own fingers.
“And you seem much happier, too,” Hermione continued, smiling warmly and nudging Harry with her shoulder.
. Harry grimaced before taking a deep breath, tilting his head forward slightly in acknowledgement of Teddy’s request.
“Really?!” Teddy nearly began to shake with his excitement. His hair shimmered, shifting between colors before settling to a blotchy pattern reflecting the calico markings of the Kneazle in front of him. Seeing the display, the Kneazle let out a loud purr, standing up and arching as it rubbed itself against the barrier, as if to touch Teddy.
Deeper…
“So?” He could hear George and Teddy’s voices in the distance as they continued their game. All three of his friends were watching him carefully—it was unnerving. He hesitated before lifting his shoulders dismissively. “He’s cute as a blond...it suits his complexion.”
They finished the rest of their meal in relative silence, though Teddy occasionally remarked on something that he had seen over the last week that he thought they would all appreciate.
“Ah, of course.” Andromeda nodded sagely, blinking thoughtfully as she stared at Harry’s jogging bottoms. “Ginerva is quite competitive. One would think you would have realized it is safer to not bet against her.”
Malfoy’s head snapped towards Harry so quickly that Harry could swear he heard a crack of the man’s neck.
Potter hums, low in his throat, as he circles the sitting room before sitting next to you. His knees brush against yours and he sets the tea cup upon the coffee table before resting one hand on your leg, thumb massaging your flesh.
Alive.
“Nothing,” Teddy shrugged. He reached for Gary, picking him up gently and placing him on his shoulders, then stood and grinned sharply at Harry. “Let’s start lunch! Nana’s not here. Can we make pizza?”
, Draco…
Harry took a slow breath, gazing around the kitchen before his eyes caught on the lemon tree outside of the window. He watched as the leaves swayed in the breeze, fruit hanging heavily on branches.
“Harry!” Teddy squealed, tossing the flour that he had clutched in his hands in the air as he jumped from his stool and rushed towards Harry.
But then, it was too late.
Warmth spread through Harry as he watched Teddy hum contentedly, burrowing his face against Draco’s chest, as Draco smiled adoringly down at the boy, fingers continuing to run gently through messy blond curls.
now. Or, at least....I would like to, if you’d let me.”
Harry tilted his head forward, an affirmative answer to Draco’s unasked question, and Draco’s shoulders immediately released the tension that they held. He sent a shy smile towards Harry—genuine—before turning to look back at Teddy, “I will come as soon as I am finished here, Tedward. I promise.”
“What?” Harry spluttered, “Andy, you just revealed
“So will you, Harry! Even with the Ferret as your other half. Your sprogs will be cute, at least. Merlin, can you imagine? Curly blond hair and your mum’s eyes?”
“Er, no...” He started, running a hand through his hair only to get his fingers caught in tangled strands. “No, I came early today. You should stay...spend time with Teddy, like normal. I’ll just...join, if that’s alright.”
I just...damnit!”
Of course Malfoy would take his involvement in Teddy’s life lightly, Harry thought, as he began to imagine all of the excuses the prat must have given Andy. Didn’t feel like leaving the luxury of the Manor this morning, perhaps, for Andromeda’s quaint cottage. Had to go to Gringotts to count his galleons and make sure he was still a rich prat. Was too fucked out from another evening with Lord What’s-His-Name from the gala the night before.
“No, Tedward,” Malfoy repeated, narrowing his eyes slightly as he looked down at the child, “Lunch is had
They were silent for a moment, watching each other, before Harry slowly nodded. “Alright...I’ll ask him.”
“Oh,” Harry blinked. He wanted to ask Malfoy more questions. How much longer did he have to train? Why did he decide to become a Healer? What the
“Wait, what does your case have to do with Teddy?” Harry interrupted, sitting forward in his seat.
He was a Gryffindor at heart, after all. He could be brave.
“‘Morning, Andy.” Harry grinned sheepishly as she raised a questioning eyebrow at him. Teddy was ecstatic that Harry was here well before his regular time, but after their encounter last weekend Harry was sure that Andromeda suspected his motives. Which was ridiculous...she should be suspecting Malfoy’s.
, Potter. What are you doing?”
“What was that?” Harry questioned hoarsely; his voice felt raw, scratching over his words. Malfoy tilted his head slightly, as if to look over his shoulder at Harry, though his eyes remained focused solely on Teddy.
Harry glanced at the elderly man, hoping to find some understanding there, but was only met with disappointment as the man slowly shook his head. He swallowed loudly, taking a deep breath. Harry hated disappointing his godson, but he knew that Andromeda would have his head if he brought a Kneazle back with them.
as he turned and fled from the sitting room. It sounded as if Andromeda laughed behind him, but it was so light that he couldn’t be sure. His cheeks were aflame as he walked towards the kitchen, though he did not know why. Surely, Andromeda knew that he would be here to see Teddy.
else.”
“Are you okay, mate?” Ron asked hesitantly.
“Mate, c’mon,” Ron started to follow Harry as he stormed to the front door. He was using his calm-investigator-Auror voice. Harry clenched his fists in frustration, knowing that neither of his friends believed him.
With a
Confident in his conclusion, Harry strode out of the kitchen and towards the sitting room. Teddy’s laughter echoed down the hallway and as Harry entered the room, it was to Teddy laying on the ground again, Gary leaping over his small body.
He loves you…
Harry remained outside, leaning against the railing of the porch and waiting as Draco and Teddy made their way towards him. Teddy was perched on Draco’s shoulders, turquoise hair shimmering in the morning sun, a broad grin displaying the gap where he had recently lost another tooth. Draco’s hands held on to Teddy’s thighs, keeping him in place, cheek dimpling as he laughed. He looked up, caught Harry’s eyes and winked.
The library was quiet but for their shallow breaths as they stared at each other. After a few moments, Malfoy’s gaze shifted, hovering just beyond Harry’s shoulder.
“And? What did he say?”
“Imagine my surprise upon discovering that Ginevra is actually a rather extraordinary witch. We happen to get along quite well. However, as I refuse to call her by that ghastly nickname of hers, I told her that I would not call her anything other than her proper name.” Draco grinned sharply, silver eyes twinkling. “Unless, of course, she would prefer that I continue to call her Weaslette.”
You laugh, nearly hysterical as Potter crawls up your body, hovering on top of you—emerald green eyes boring into your own dull grey.
stood gracefully, reaching out to gently hold Draco’s arm and help him off of Harry.
, and him calling me
Letting out a shaky breath, Harry forced himself to look away from Teddy—who had morphed, Harry had no doubt about it, to resemble both Draco and Harry.
Turning around to clean up the remainder of their lunch, Harry cast a couple of charms around the kitchen so that they would not leave a mess behind upon their departure, before turning to look at what was left of the crumble.
“I’m your
Control.
They settled into an easy rhythm. Harry sliced all of the foods while Malfoy assembled them atop the hob. Teddy placed the top layer of bread upon the toasties before Malfoy gracefully flipped them to brown on the opposite side and then lifted them from the cooktop to settle on the serving plate.
With one more self-assured nod, Harry walked out of the cottage and spun on his heels, Disapparating on the spot.
Malfoy caught Harry’s curious gaze, shrugging elegantly as he took the plate of toasties in hand, nodding to the pot with a smug smirk. “Tomato and basil soup. One of my specialties. Tedward thought that it would go well with the toasties. If you would, Potter?”
“Okay,
Maybe Draco wouldn’t want him, Harry thought as he looked at his empty home. Grimmauld was not as dark as it had once been—Harry had made sure of that, remodeling what he could. But someone with Draco’s tastes surely would not be swayed by
But, of course, nothing
Harry growled, thrusting his hips forward. Draco yelped as he was thrown off balance, as Harry darted forward, rolling them so Draco was on his back and Harry caged him into the bed.
“I told you!” Harry stepped backwards until he was pressed against the wall, lifting his hands in front of him. “We were flying—practising for Quidditch Camp this weekend—and he turned too sharply. I didn’t reach him in time and he fell. But...he’s okay, now. You fixed him!”
As he approached the kitchen, Teddy’s voice rose, desperate in its pleas. “—you can’t go yet! We haven’t had lunch yet!”
Staring at the dessert, Harry’s lips twitched as he recalled walking in on Teddy and Malfoy—or Draco, he supposed, now that they were beginning to get along—in their efforts to bake.
“So, Malfoy...” Harry cleared his throat, running a hand through his hair only for his fingers to get caught in the strands. Exasperatedly, he shook his hand in an effort to quickly release it from the curls, stumbling slightly and catching himself against the table.
“Of course. I will bring you a bouquet of the Hydrangeas that you are so fond of.”
Draco turned away, striding to the armchair closest to the hearth. Gracefully, he sat, sprawling across it. He threw one leg over the arm of the chair, legs spread wide as he took a leisurely sip from his drink. Harry’s gaze was drawn to him—to the
Harry blinked, dumbfounded.
The Kneazle let out a soft meow, rubbing once more against Teddy’s chin and burrowing its head into his neck. Teddy’s gaze froze, stroking calmly at the creature’s back, before he lifted silver eyes to Harry.
. That means making sure no one is manipulating him, which Malfoy
Draco’s eyes were riveted to their joined hands, a small wrinkle forming between his brows. His cheeks were beginning to pinken and although his face remained inscrutable, when he lifted his eyes to meet Harry’s there was an intensity within them that was hypnotizing.
Harry licked at his lips subconsciously as he catalogued every change. Malfoy really had grown into himself since the end of the war...and it did seem like, perhaps, his character had changed for the better as well.
Harry slowly chewed his food, a soft smile lingering on his lips as he watched the elderly elf. As much trouble as Kreacher was, Harry couldn’t help it—he had grown fond of him. Kreacher complained about nearly everything, and was almost always talking about how much better it had been at the height of the Black Family’s reign, and yet he did seem to care for Harry in his own, aggravated way.
“Oh, you know—” Ginny smirked mischievously, “—just that as Teddy was begging you to go to camp, his hair turned all white blond and his eyes kept changing color.”
“Harry!” Teddy cried, footsteps thundering down the hallway. “He isn’t here! He said he’d stay, but he’s—“ Teddy flung the door to Harry’s room open and skidded to a halt upon seeing Harry and Draco in bed. “
The space where Teddy had recently lost a front tooth gaped prominently behind his wide grin, before he turned to attack the remainder of his ice cream cone. With a fond smile, Harry finished his own cone as they made their way to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.
He froze, breath catching in his throat.
“Don’t.” Harry snapped, stepping to the side of the Quidditch pitch. He could see Draco and Jesse in the distance, talking heatedly. In the middle of the pitch, Teddy maneuvered between various obstacles, cheered on by the Harpies and other children as they practiced tossing Quaffles to one another.
Harry felt as if an icy hand had clenched around his heart and dragged it down into the pit of his stomach, while his veins simultaneously thrummed with a warmth that spread through his entire body. He inhaled sharply, feeling his eyes begin to water as he tried to think of what he could possibly say.
“Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry snorted, “Must you always be such a bloody drama queen? You missed it entirely, you git.”
, Harry had no clue.
“Er...yes. When I saw them together on Saturday I thought Jesse was flirting with her—which, to be fair, he
He said you could make it work.
“You’re leaving already?” Harry frowned, pushing himself from the wall, “You don’t normally go until after lunch.”
Teddy remained where he sat while Malfoy and Harry had danced, amber eyes wide as he looked between the adults. Malfoy stood straight, shoulders tensed as he stared unblinking at Andromeda.
Teddy readily agreed, lifting Gary so that the creature could perch on his shoulders, before skipping after the man.
“Already?” Harry asked hoarsely, eyes lingering on Draco’s pert arse as he walked by, trousers molded perfectly to its shape. His eyes roamed upwards until they met sparkling silver. Harry grimaced at being caught out, his cheeks flushing in embarrassment, though Draco simply watched him with an eyebrow raised, his left cheek slowly dimpling in amusement. “Er...”
“We will see you on Monday, dear,” Andromeda smiled, nodding as she placed a comforting hand on Teddy’s shoulder.
How dare he? Argue with Draco—not even say
Shattered glass—
Malfoy froze, eyes wide as he stared down at Harry’s hand, hovering between them. Harry watched, fascinated, as Malfoy’s throat worked, hesitating for a moment before raising his pale hand and grasping Harry’s own.
“Er...” Harry coughed lightly, clearing his throat as he glanced up at Malfoy. Slowly, Malfoy’s gaze shifted from Teddy, icy silver meeting emerald.
, two, three...
“Well, come
He must be missing something. Malfoy was surely still up to
Harry groaned, rubbing a hand over his face. He knew he should have never introduced his godson to that muggle comic.
Draco grumbled, burrowing his head into the pillow. “‘S too early. Go back t’sleep.”
I brought him pain, years ago, marking his skin.
You whimper.
“I’m sorry!” Harry spluttered, twisting around where he sat so that he could look Draco in the eyes. “I know we didn’t really talk about all of that, about you staying, but...I’d like it. If you stayed...today, tomorrow. Whenever you’d like, really.”
“Of course you are, Harry,” Hermione remarked, eyes beginning to glitter like they always did whenever she had a new insight or theory developing. “Don’t you remember that case I had a few weeks ago, and the werewolves that were contesting their pack member’s will?”
Harry chuckled, kneeling down to wrap his arms around Teddy in a tight hug as the boy ran into his chest.
“See, I told you!” A smug grin spread across Teddy’s face, one dimple tugging at his left cheek. He wriggled around in George’s grasp, attempting to sit up straight, as he basked in the glory of being right.
were the one acting strangely. “Draco, of course.”
“Draco is helping me practise my morph!” Teddy nearly vibrated with his excitement as he looked between Harry and Malfoy. Harry clenched his jaw, forcing a smile. He didn’t want Teddy to worry.
“What?” Teddy’s gaze snapped towards Harry, the Kneazle’s tail twitching as its sharp eyes followed. “But...but he wants to be mine. He does!”
. He could feel the tension in the air—he
Letting out a soft sigh, Harry walked towards the sitting room, looking inside to see Andromeda sitting in a plush armchair in front of the hearth, a worn book propped in her lap as she stared at him, amber eyes sparkling.
“Well, er...” Harry licked his lips quickly, nodding towards the hallway that would lead towards the kitchen and dining room. “I suppose we should join them...”
“Oh, er... He can’t control it well yet. But he’s been practicing,” Harry coughed lightly, shifting on his feet. He didn’t meet George’s eyes, instead keeping watch over Teddy as he lifted a Pygmy Puff into the air and sat it on his head. The Pygmy Puff was white, fur shining brightly in the morning sunlight. It made Harry remember when Teddy morphed the previous day, platinum blond hair glimmering as he defended his cousin. “I think a lot of it is still unintentional.”
Draco pulled back, staring heatedly at Harry’s lips. “Shouldn’t you be getting ready to go?”
They made a few more turns around the room, bodies pressed against one another, the heat steadily rising, before Harry glanced to the entrance of the sitting room, stumbling when his eyes caught on Andromeda’s.
“Yes, of course,” Harry threw back the entirety of his tumbler, turning to gaze into the crackling fire. He nodded slowly, mumbling, “Cooking...yeah, that’s it.”
Malfoy shook his head once, clearing his throat, “No, I should go.”
The door slammed open.
“Well, I do not know, dear. It is only that I never quite know what you are working on,” Andromeda’s eyebrows rose slightly in astonishment, “Perhaps you got caught up in that glass blowing studio you experimented with the other month, and forgot the time as you have done before.”
The front door creaked quietly as Harry walked inside, and he closed it as gently as he could, trying not to bring any attention to himself.
Nothing at all like what Harry had expected.
Harry groaned, running his hands through his hair as he glared down at the sticky bar table, before leaning back in the booth and looking at his friends. Ron and Hermione sat across from them, each nursing their own pint. George was sprawled next to him, one arm resting across the booth behind them while a smirk tugged at his lips.
, all three of us!”
“He knows me. And he—” Draco swallowed thickly “—he doesn’t want to see me hurt.”
Hesitating as he reached the front door, Harry knocked gently before turning the knob and making his way into the home.
They won’t be able to stop this.
And Merlin, it almost looked as if Jesse was
Harry lifted Teddy from his lap, standing up so that they could all say their farewells. As he turned, he caught sight of Draco, leaning casually against a wall, ankles crossed, elongating the sleek line of his body.
He felt as if all of the breath had been pulled from his lungs as he stared at Malfoy.
Lunch was ready, after all.
“But...how?
“Yes,” Harry interrupted, reaching for Draco’s hand and squeezing it, “Yes, Teddy. He’s

“Harry...it’s not just
, suddenly, he felt this need to approach Malfoy—not in opposition, as he always had before, but with something else.
Harry rolled his eyes, his head thunking painfully against the back of the booth as he let it fall. “Of course not, Hermione. That is what he
“You are a menace,” Harry narrowed his eyes at the Kneazle, who merely blinked in response. Shaking his head in exasperation, Harry motioned towards the creature, tapping his shoulder. “Well, come on, then. Let’s go see Teddy.”
His breath caught as Teddy stepped out from behind Andromeda’s legs. His small body had morphed, silver eyes glimmering with tears as he looked between Harry and Malfoy. Platinum blonde hair now created a halo around his head, thin strands falling across his forehead as he began to shake. His skin was still tanned, dotted with freckles from playing in the sun, but it was evident in that moment who inspired the pale hair and stormy eyes.
watch Malfoy, and here he was caught in the act. He could feel his cheeks heating, though he stubbornly refused to be the first to break eye contact. Malfoy’s lips twitched slightly before he glanced quickly to the ground and then back towards Teddy, a light flush lingering on his cheeks.
Harry hummed softly, rubbing his thumbs against the tear tracks before running his fingers through Teddy’s dirty blond curls.
“Sure we can,” Harry nodded. “You did well with Ginny and George last weekend.”
An obnoxious snort sounded to Harry’s side, and he turned to glare at his best friend. Ron was sitting on the floor with his back resting against Hermione’s legs, who observed the other three from her perch in her armchair.
written across the arse in sparkling silver script. The bottoms were obnoxious, although Ginny swore they were the most comfortable things she had ever worn.
he like me?”
Gary skittered beneath the love seat, leaving only Harry, Malfoy and a distraught Teddy in the middle of the sitting room. Harry instantly fell to his knees in front of his godson, reaching out to hold him, desperately spewing out reassurances, “Teddy, are you okay? It’s okay, you’re going to be okay!”
“Er...yes, of course I do.”
“Harry!” A loud squeal echoed throughout the kitchen as Teddy ran into the room. Harry laughed, forgetting his discomfort of only moments before, as he knelt down to pick up his godson.
, and there’s nothing going on?” He laughed incredulously. “No. No, something is going on. He didn’t admit to anything, but something is going on. He wasn’t only there to visit. Andy would have told me if she and Teddy had been seeing Malfoy. I’m telling you, he is
“No,” Malfoy shook his head, coughing lightly as he turned to gaze cooly at Harry. “But I am certain that you would prefer to spend time with Teddy without my presence.”
“Oh, no,
you, Teddy!” George exclaimed, his eyes wide in exaggerated shock.
“Oh, I am certain that you would be,” Andromeda grinned, looping her arm through Harry’s and leading him towards the sitting room. “Teddy and Draco are in the drawing room. Teddy was adamant that Draco help with his painting upon his arrival this morning. Why don’t we have a cup of tea while we wait for them to join us?”
Draco paused, bright eyes boring into Harry’s own. After a moment, his eyes softened, dimple crinkling his cheek as he spoke, “You’re sure.”
Harry couldn’t look away even if he tried.
“Yeah?” He whispers against your lips—a taunt, a challenge.
For Teddy.
Harry blinked dumbly. He very rarely recalled Hermione’s cases while she was discussing them, let alone weeks later. With an exasperated sigh, Hermione rolled her eyes.
Malfoy scoffed, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling as he threw his hands in the air. Teddy giggled, clasping his hands over his mouth in an effort to disguise his amusement.
“Er, no. No, I didn’t,” Harry said hastily. Malfoy was smirking at him, a mischievous gleam in his eyes, and Harry waved a hand through the air as if to further dismiss Teddy’s accusations. “Anyway, you didn’t answer my question. How is it your

, followed shortly by a low chuckle.
“Oh, are you sure? I could have sworn you were my long lost cousin, Theodore Weasley.”
Until—
“Can we go home now?” Teddy walked into the room, one hand reaching to grasp at Harry’s fingers as the other reached for Draco’s, looking up at both of them with wide eyes. “Please?”
“Well...” Harry coughed lightly. “Should we go, then?”
“Mm...” Harry licked his lips as he reached for the nearest fork and knife, “Would you prefer I eat like you, Malfoy?”
listening, then. It’s a case contesting next of kin and the relevancy of a deceased werewolf’s will. She wrote a will stating that her lover should receive her assets, however, her lover isn’t a werewolf and her pack hadn’t formally recognized their relationship before she passed. Her pack is saying that because it wasn’t formalized, the will is inapplicable, and they must instead defer to the pack hierarchy.”
“I’m joking!” he wasn’t, not really. But Harry was still certain that Draco would be welcome at the Burrow. And more than that, he
Teddy had been so thrilled, eyes shining with excitement as he attempted to steal bites of the crumble when Draco was not looking. And Draco had been...different.
A sharp
Harry now spent his days caring for Teddy. He had given up searching for a career, knowing that he was more fulfilled raising his godson and helping with Quidditch Camp every month than he would be doing anything else.
“Yes, but I missed him, Nana!” Teddy replied, squirming around on Harry’s lap so that he could rest his back against Harry’s chest and look over at his grandmother. Harry wrapped his arms around Teddy’s torso, ensuring he was secure and wouldn’t topple over the edge of the armchair in his excitement.
Teddy shifted slightly, gazing up at the man desperately. “They do? But...how do their companions know?”
Until teeth
Teddy flung his arms around Draco’s neck, tugging him close and burying his face in the man’s neck, turquoise hair darkening rapidly to an inky black. Although they were too far away for Harry to overhear anything, he could see them whispering to one another before Draco pressed a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead and pulled away.
“He is busy, love,” Andromeda turned back towards her garden in dismissal, fingers beginning to gently pull fresh tomatoes from their stalks. “Nothing you need to concern yourself with.”
You lean forward to place a gentle kiss against soft lips, and are met with a firm hand against your chest.
You won’t.
For a moment, they merely watched one another. Draco’s eyes were blazing, intent shining clearly within, and Harry could no longer doubt that this

“Yes. Be brave, and all of that. Now I must be off,” Ginny snickered. She paused, turning back to look intently at Harry. “I expect you to be at the Burrow for brunch on Sunday, though. I’m bringing Jesse...I’ll need you there so Mum doesn’t lose her mind. After all, I haven’t brought anyone home since—“

going out with, then?”
Ginny grimaced, glancing to the side. “I really think that is something that you should ask Draco about.”
“Oh, my!” Andromeda gasped. A deep chuckle sounded from within the room, though Harry refused to acknowledge who it came from.
“Harry!” Teddy cried as his small body fell from the broom.
“No, you’ll see that I’m right about this,” Harry reached for the front door before turning to give one more glare to Ron and Hermione, both standing in the doorway to the kitchen and watching him carefully, “And for the record, I was

.” Harry laid himself over Draco, nuzzling into his neck and pressing soft kisses against his pulse. He did not say he was sorry. This was not the time for apologies and long conversations.
“Harry—” Hermione interrupted before he could begin to argue with George “—you still have not provided any evidence that would support that theory. I’m not saying you’re wrong, but you are jumping from one theory to the next with very little proof, if any. Despite Malfoy helping Teddy morph—and it does sound like he was
Harry let out a soft huff of laughter as he let his fingers caress his skin, spreading the soapy lather across his body. Malfoy would be so easy to rile up.
“Did I?” Ginny asked dismissively, not bothering to look at her brother, instead continuing to watch Harry.
Ginny dipped into an elegant curtsy, “Draco.”
Teddy and Gary spent every moment together, running throughout the halls of Grimmauld Place and generally creating a ruckus. Harry didn’t mind—even when he had to listen to the grumbling from Kreacher after his godson departed on Sunday evening—because despite the house elf’s complaints, Harry was certain that Kreacher missed listening to Teddy run around the house just as much as Harry did.
“Alright,” Draco whispered, “I will come to the Burrow.”
That can’t be right.
at camp. And Draco thought it would help, is all.”
“Bye, Draco!” Teddy grinned, brown eyes shimmering as he stared up at Malfoy.
Draco sucked at his rim, tongue flicking against him before darting forward, delving into Harry and loosening him, preparing him for
Gods, you are
Harry stumbled as Malfoy brushed past him, knocking his shoulder against Harry’s, and swiftly escaping the library. He looked at the entrance numbly. He had been in the right, questioning Malfoy as he had. He knew he had. Yet suddenly he felt as if he were perhaps missing something. His gut felt heavy as he turned and followed in Malfoy’s wake.
“Good. Now, then. As I was saying...you are
“Of course,” George nodded, pushing himself from the counter with a sharp nod. “In fact, he was just telling me how he planned on bringing you to Magical Menagerie before heading home.”
“Nothing,” Malfoy slowly shook his head, pursing his lips as if considering what he would say. Harry had never known Malfoy to consider
Gathering himself, Harry grunted, standing up as Draco began to leave, “His name is
Malfoy’s lips twitched, his eye crinkling slightly before he looked down, breaking their gaze. Harry felt his own lips twitch and quickly bit his lip to prevent any unintended expression from crossing his face and upsetting Teddy further. He sniffed before glancing down at Teddy, whose eyes had returned to their familiar amber hue, platinum blond beginning to bleed to turquoise, a wide grin splitting his face.

You breathe heavily against his nape, succumbing to the pleasure—the
Not unless Harry had absolute proof Malfoy was up to something, of course.
“He’s here!” Teddy cried out, scrambling from his chair and rushing out of the kitchen to greet Draco. Harry heard his godson squeal, followed closely by Draco’s warm laughter.
The bright light of a
. He grinned broadly and before he could consider otherwise, Harry found himself nodding.
“Hi there, Tedward,” Malfoy grinned, running a hand through Teddy’s hair, before heading further into the garden. He had yet to spare a glance at Harry, focusing instead on Andromeda as he strode forward. “Good morning, Aunt ‘Dromeda. I apologize again for my tardiness.”
Teddy’s morphed silver eyes, flickering as color began to bleed back around his irises, remained fixed on Harry. He stood adamantly next to Malfoy, clutching his cousin’s pale hand.
“Yes, yes. Of course,” Draco nodded as he took a step back.
?” Teddy whined from his perch atop Draco’s shoulders as he caught sight of Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes, sticking his tongue out at Draco as he made his way towards them. “Merlin, yes, we can go.”
“Yes, Nana!” Teddy grinned widely at Harry and Malfoy before following Andromeda from the room as they made their way toward the dining room, leaving Harry and Malfoy standing alone in the middle of the sitting room.
. His fingers trembled, clutching at Draco’s hips and yanking him closer.
“They’re
There was no way.

, Harry thought, breathing deeply and smiling back as he watched Draco and Teddy make their way towards him. He was happy.
“What the fuck is ‘
Malfoy blinked, grey eyes flickering across Harry’s face. “It is, yes,” he said slowly, “but it’s perfectly fine, Potter.”
and yet was now eager to return to Quidditch Camp, as if nothing had happened.
“Fine,” Teddy whined, kicking gently at the kitchen floor. He turned one last pleading look towards Harry, silver eyes glimmering, before Malfoy swiftly interrupted any attempt at subterfuge.
, Draco cleared his throat. “Harry...what, exactly, did Tedward mean when he said—”
Harry leaned forward, pulling Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth and suckling at it before he sat back. “Mmm...probably. But you should, too.”
“Teddy being able to control his morph. When did that happen?” George inquired, leaning against the counter as he turned to focus on Harry.
As Ginny and Angelina began to organize a scrimmage, Harry risked a glance towards Draco.
Draco looked ethereal in the evening light, and Harry’s breath caught as he stared up at him—fair hair disheveled and cheeks flushed with want. He hungrily eyed the long lines of Draco’s pale throat, the sharp dips of his collarbones, the silvery scars crossing his—
By 10:30 am, Harry figured he had waited long enough. With sure steps, he walked out of Grimmauld Place and Apparated to Tonks Cottage, making the familiar journey up the cobblestone path towards the front door. The cottage was quieter than previous weeks; he could not hear Teddy’s laughter resonating throughout the gardens, nor the muffled voice that he had begun to recognize as belonging to Malfoy.
“Of course, dear,” Andromeda smiled up at Malfoy, gently grasping one of his hands between her own.
,” Draco whispered against his lips, breath warm and intimate as it caressed Harry’s skin. “You bloody git...of course it’s not. How are you
“Oh, no it wouldn’t!” Teddy said, shrugging as his feet touched the ground. He looked up at Harry, wide eyes glimmering mischievously in the morning light.
“Malfoy—”
And he did.
Malfoy gaped at Harry, his thin lips parting as he stared. Harry’s lips twitched in an amused grin, pleased that his response had inspired such an uncharacteristic display of shock from Malfoy.
“He’ll be there, Teddy, don’t worry,” Harry said confidently, smiling reassuringly at his godson. “Draco just has to finish his shift, and then he will come to Grimmauld and tuck you in. How does that sound?”
“Mmm,” Ginny nodded, one finger lazily circling the edge of her wine glass as a corner of her lips pulled up in a smirk. “It could be your incompetence with herbology...or was it the fact that a plant exploded and covered you in purple slime?”
it mean?” Ron questioned, widening his eyes as he blearily gazed between his sister and best friend.
“Mhmm,” Hermione nodded, shifting to tuck her feet beneath her legs as she curled into the corner of the loveseat. Gary meowed pathetically at the loss of her fingers, and quickly moved to seat himself upon her lap. “Have you determined what Malfoy is up to?”
Reaching for the door to the sitting room, Harry pushed it open and promptly froze where he stood.
“I should be going, as well,” Draco said, pushing himself from the wall and sauntering towards the hearth. Harry inhaled deeply as he passed, reveling in the fresh scent of citrus that he recognized as
…you pack your bags.
! Harry, let’s
“Must I—what?” Harry swallowed his mouthful, glancing around the table as he tried to figure out what he was being scolded for.
Draco soothed him, reassuring the boy that
Teddy narrowed his eyes, his nose wrinkling in a small sneer. He shook his head once, firmly, emerald eyes flashing. “No. No, just you.”
Teddy’s eyes widened excitedly, “Alright!”
“Come on, Harry...” Draco murmured against his ear, sucking at the lobe, demanding, “Come for me.”
“Come on, Harry!” Teddy called, rushing through the hallways on his way to the garden. “Let’s go fly!”
As Harry opened his mouth to confirm that yes, they could go now, Draco interjected.
“What?” Harry looked frantically between Malfoy and Teddy, eyes wide.
Not when you are dancing with the devil.
and he threw his drink back quickly before falling across the chaise lounge.
“Yes, of course. Well, then...” Harry paused, glancing between Malfoy and Teddy. He focused briefly on Teddy, who was watching the two adults hopefully, before turning back to the man standing stiffly before him. “I suppose I will see you next weekend...Draco?”
Andromeda and Teddy were kneeling in the dirt in front of the vegetable garden, speaking softly to one another as they observed the ripe produce, their backs to Harry. He paused for a moment, quickly looking around to spot where Malfoy was lurking, and frowned when he did not spot him.
“Well, his schedule is quite sporadic, and he doesn’t like to be unprepared,” Luna explained with a shrug. “And if he has plans with Teddy the following morning, he never goes out. He is very adamant about not being indisposed when he spends time with Teddy.”
and their lips would meet. He could feel Draco’s warm breath against his skin, a caress, but
“Wait, Harry—“
“Yeah…”
Teddy sniffled, hesitating for a moment before nodding. “Yes...and you made it better.”
Your voice is hoarse. It doesn’t sound like you…
Well.
“Shh…it’s alright. I’ve got you, Draco.” Firm fingers wrap around your scarred wrist, lifting it to soft lips. “I’ve got you…”
Harry melted against Draco as his release swept through him. His lips parted on a silent scream, stars bursting behind his eyelids. After what felt like eons, he surfaced to find himself laying in a heap on top of his bedsheets while Draco tenderly wiped a wet flannel across his body.
Harry threw one last glare in George’s direction as Teddy hastily tugged him down Diagon Alley toward Magical Menagerie.
Instead, Harry focused on Ginny—flying quickly towards them, Teddy held tightly against her chest and Ron following close behind. Within a moment she arrived, Teddy scrambling out of her arms and rushing forward, tightly wrapping himself around Harry’s legs.
, Harry thought—Draco’s tongue ran along his lips, leaving them plump and glistening, firelight shimmering against the wet trail along his skin.
“You’re sure?” Harry questioned, turning his body towards Malfoy. He didn’t know why he suddenly wanted to make sure that Malfoy was not upset that he would be taking Teddy early, but he did.
“Harry...come on,” Ginny whispered, gently resting a hand against his shoulders, “It’s just me.”
Harry and Teddy stood in silence, watching as the heavy door slowly swung closed behind Malfoy’s retreating form.
The welcomewitch squeaked behind them, and when Harry spared a glance her way he could see her smiling, hands resting clasped against her chest, watching the three of them with a soft look in her eyes.
Harry rolled his head against Draco’s shoulder, hooded eyes flickering across Draco’s face until their gaze caught. Silver eyes burned as they stared back at him, warm breath panted across his lips.
, thinking that
Lights glint off of his skin—highlighting his scars. Silver beneath an open collar, thin cuts leading up, across full lips. I know what those scars look like.
“Are you ready?” Harry asked, grinning as Teddy nodded his head frantically. Reaching for Teddy’s hand, Harry tossed the powder into the hearth. He called out, “Grimmauld Place,” and they stepped into the flames.
“Er...” Harry wavered, hesitating as Teddy’s eyes widened even more, grey morphing to a vibrant silver.
“If that is all, I will show myself to the guest quarters. Good evening, and thank you for your hospitality.”
You’re alone.
Malfoy’s lips parted on a silent gasp—whether at Harry’s words or the nearly
Harry took a quick breath, realizing with a shock that Teddy was yelling at
You lose yourselves.
“I think that is a brilliant idea, Harry,” she stated, “After all, it is so important for children to have a positive and loving familial unit. You and Mal—Draco, rather, being friendly with one another will certainly help facilitate that.”
There is something tragic about this.
“Oh!” Teddy suddenly scrambled to stand up, nearly tripping over his own feet. He spun to look at Draco, wide emerald eyes shining. “Can you read
Hermione rested her head against Harry’s shoulder, reaching out to squeeze his hand. “I’m glad, Harry. We all are. You deserve it.”
George smirked, eyes sparkling with mischief, “Ah, yes, of course. Who else could it possibly be but your favorite Slytherin?”
He had everything that he could ever want, right in front of him.
“Hello there, Harry,” Andromeda greeted him from where she sat, perched on the armchair nearest to the hearth. “Teddy and Draco are in the gardens.”
“Well, what is this?” Draco drawled. Harry turned his head to the side, his throat drying at the sight of the other man. Standing just across the threshold, Draco held Teddy securely against his hip. He was wearing worn jeans, which did
Out of the corners of his eye, Harry could see Draco begin to part his lips, some sort of explanation ready to calm the boy. Before Draco had a chance to speak, however, Harry interjected.
As he approached the cottage, Harry could hear the laughter of his godson echoing throughout the home, muffled slightly by the soft swell of music drifting through open windows.
Harry swallowed and smiled shakily as he knelt in front of Teddy. He lifted the hand that Teddy was not clutching and brushed Teddy’s hair behind his ear, leaning forward to press his lips against his forehead—just as Draco had earlier.
!” Teddy cried, stampeding down the stairs and stumbling into the sitting room. “We’re going to be late!”
Malfoy cleared his throat quietly, gazing down at Teddy with a fond smile, “Of course not, Tedward. I am due at St. Mungo’s early today, so there is no inconvenience on my part.”
Everyone wanted him to believe that Malfoy had changed, that he was better, that he was
Malfoy shrugged apologetically at Teddy, “If you want to have any sort of command over others later in life, Tedward, you must have the skills to present a provocative argument. Unfortunately, you failed at that today. Confidence and determination only go so far.”
“Er...” Harry coughed, refusing to meet Malfoy’s gaze, instead turning to stare in astonishment at his godson. “Yes, I’m sure he is, Teddy...but that still doesn’t explain
“Er...” He hesitated, grimacing as Teddy’s eyes began to glimmer, silver irises highlighted by tears. Harry was never good at remaining calm when Teddy began to cry, often resorting to whatever necessary to make his godson happy again.
Malfoy sat in front of Teddy, back straight, silver eyes unblinking as he stared at Harry, on guard like an animal of prey, frozen in the moment before flight.
“…Harry. No.”
Malfoy immediately raised a hand to his right cheek, wiping it from cheekbone to temple, and then back down to his sharp jaw, before pulling his hand away to look at the residue it revealed.
“Alright, Harry. Let’s say Malfoy
“Hello, darling,” Andromeda pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s right cheek, then his left, before pulling away and smiling fondly at him on Saturday morning. “It’s lovely to see you. Teddy has spoken of little more than what fun he had with you while I was away.”
Draco froze, his fingers digging into Harry’s side. Harry gasped at the sudden pain.
“I won’t, I promise.” Harry peered around the corner to see Malfoy kneeling down and enveloping Teddy in a tight hug, holding him close for longer than Teddy ever allowed before he would inevitably wriggle away. Malfoy pressed a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead before standing and bestowing a kiss to each of Andromeda’s cheeks in farewell.
You told him.
…bruising…
and her sudden display of decorum seemed out of place.
Harry propped himself onto his elbows, gazing hungrily at the bulge beneath Draco’s black silk pants. He fingered the band and began to pull down, watching enraptured as the fabric strained before suddenly releasing, Draco’s thick cock freeing itself from the confines of his briefs and landing heavily against his stomach.
A soft smile tugged at the man’s lips as he nodded back to the creatures in front of them. “Oh, you just know. A connection is formed. It’s unmistakable.”
Ginny turned towards Draco and raised one brow, lips curling roguishly as she lifted a hand. Draco’s eyes sparkled and he smirked before gracefully reaching forward to grasp her hand in his, resting the other against the small of his back. He lifted her hand, placing a kiss to her fingers.
“No—“ you gasp, turning away from his mouth “—you don’t…
He reached for the mug he had drank his tea from this morning, dipped it into the soapy water and began to wash it as he listened to Ginny’s light footsteps echo down the hall.
Something was still going on...Harry had no idea what
child yesterday?”
Teddy rambled on about everything he had done during the week that Harry had missed as they prepared their pizzas. Gary sat perched on his shoulder, tail flicking back and forth as he stared at Harry.
…until you succumb.
“No. C’mere,” he slurred, pulling Draco towards him as soon as his fingers intertwined with Draco’s.
“Yeah, the Harpies told us about it yesterday when we went to their practice,” Harry chuckled as he recalled the conversation—or lack thereof.
Humble.
Ginny sighed, reaching forward and wrapping her hands around one of Harry’s. Her thumbs stroked against his skin and she looked calmly up into his eyes. “Just talk to Draco, alright? The next time you see him.”
Harry gaped as his eyes flickered between the two, dumbfounded by the bizarre rapport they had. Just as he was about to question what
You want him to tell you that he loves you.
“I’m not a bloody horse, Tedward, don’t kick! I’m going.” Draco huffed, turning and striding out of the kitchen as Teddy cackled.
“Of course.” A small smile graced his lips and Teddy stepped forward, wrapping his arms tightly around Malfoy as he burrowed his face in his cousin’s neck.
Kneeling down beside them was a wizard, dressed in a tight t-shirt with a crossed wand and bone embroidered on the breast and tucked into dark jeans. Chestnut brown hair shone in the morning light and as Harry met the man’s concerned eyes, he felt as if he had been suddenly doused with a cauldron of ice water.
“It’s not about the
A breath shudders from your lungs as your lips part. You sink into the couch, legs spreading as he rolls his hips against yours, gasping at the sudden
Malfoy continued to whisper soothing nothings in Teddy’s ear, until he was giggling, feet kicking against the cupboards as he grinned up at his cousin, nodding to whatever question Malfoy had asked him.
“Of course. And Jesse—he’s a Healer, too—he can help,” Draco tilted his head towards the other man. Teddy followed the movement and watched as Jesse smiled, waving at them.
He stood up, fingers still clutched in Teddy’s tiny fist. “Well, then, Tedward...” He smiled fondly at his godson, “Shall we go home?”
“Stop…” you whisper, turning your face away from the tongue licking at your jawline.
at Hannah’s!”
He had also never felt as heated during the Yule Ball as he did now. Though surely that was only because Hogwarts would have had excellent cooling charms in place on account of the amount of students in the Great Hall, whereas Andromeda’s cottage was not charmed for such activity.
Draco’s other brow slowly rose to meet the first, staring wide-eyed at Harry, and Harry could feel a deep flush spreading across his face. He glanced down, lifting a hand to rub at the back of his neck.
Hermione turned on her heels and made her way into the kitchen. For a moment, Harry was alone, left stunned and more confused than ever.
Satin sheets, whispering against your flesh...
“Draco doesn’t go out much. He’s quite dedicated, you know. It would take a lot for him to miss spending time with little Teddy.”
Draco’s nostrils flared on a sharp inhale, pale brows lifting in surprise, cheeks pinking slightly. “Pardon?”
. Teddy was crying, evidently unable to control his morph, all because Harry had confronted Malfoy.
, at the gala.
Harry froze, eyes flickering to his closed wardrobe, before he hesitantly looked towards Kreacher’s stumbling form. “Kreacher...what do you mean, my friend brought clothes?”
As Harry placed the final dish to his side to dry, he wiped his hands against his jeans, not bothering with a drying charm. He turned, gazing around the room—quiet and empty.
Ensuring that Teddy was secure in his grasp, and without further delay, Harry Disapparated.
Harry spluttered, his mouth falling open in astonishment that only
The soft notes of a piano echoed through the room, string instruments rising to accompany its delicate sound as the melody swelled. Gliding gracefully across the floor were Malfoy and Teddy, ignorant of their sudden audience.
right now.
The doors open and you see
“Harry, can we get one?” he begged, holding the white Pygmy Puff in his hands. It stared up at him with huge eyes, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from cringing. He hated the little puff balls. As much as he wanted to be a good godfather to Teddy, he just couldn’t do this.
’s notorious Society column, was Malfoy in all of his glory—shirking any responsibilities he may have to gallivant around, throwing himself at whomever he pleased.
“Yes, and with
Harry jumped from his
Harry watched curiously as Malfoy’s face flushed a deep red, his eyes widening as he stared at Teddy.
A deep, violent shudder reverberated throughout Harry’s body as he moaned. His cock throbbed, sticky cum spilling over his fingers in his release. Harry panted as his body began to slump against the tile, steam caressing his heated skin as he came back to himself slowly.
Harry’s breath caught, his eyes widening at Teddy’s words. He swore he could hear a rush of breath on the opposite side of the garden, where Draco stood stiffly. Teddy simply smiled, cheeks flushed with his excitement, pale eyes twinkling.
“What?”
They stared at one another for a moment. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and glanced quickly at the floor in an attempt to prevent a wide grin from spreading across his face. Taking a quick breath, he lifted his gaze once more to Draco and offered what he hoped was a welcoming smile.
It is not the mark of pain, of mistrust, of suspicion. No…now, it is so much more.
to secure you, “…What?”
tell Molly Weasley that. You’re right fit, honestly. You’re a bloody Healer, for Merlin’s sake, and you’re good at it.” Harry’s voice softened, his smile shy and genuine, nervous as he whispered vulnerably. “...You’re brilliant with Teddy.”
Harry smiled down at his godson and nodded. “Yes, much better. Good as new!”
It catches.
nothing you have said yet sounds like he is doing anything suspicious.”
one of them.
Worse than when
Draco hesitated before kneeling in front of Teddy, resting his hands on tiny shoulders, “I do. I’m sorry, Tedward. But I will see you again in a couple of days. Enjoy your time with Harry.”
Andromeda merely chuckled, tilting her head and looking at him as if she were indulging a child, “Neither of you are as subtle as you think that you are, my dear.”
!” Teddy exclaimed, grinning up at Harry with bright silver eyes. “We had some at school the other day! I told Draco, and he said he could make some for me today!” Teddy beamed up at Draco, his honey colored hair darkening, fading to black.
Loving him will kill you.
You whimper.
, they went home.
Ginny stuck her tongue out at him, her nose scrunching up, before she lifted the wine glass to her lips again. Harry glared at her, wondering—not for the first time—what he had ever seen in her. She was trouble, that one. Too mischievous and bold for her own good.
Teddy wriggled out of Harry’s arms as Malfoy turned around, running over and wrapping his arms around one slender leg. A fond smile pulled at Malfoy's lips, and Harry was momentarily stunned, before pale fingers ran through Teddy’s tussled turquoise hair. “Goodbye, Tedward. I will see you on Tuesday.”
“Harry.” Andromeda spoke softly at his side. Harry glanced quickly at Andromeda, who nodded towards the two blondes in front of them, an unspoken demand.
“Yes, Harry,” Ginny laughed quietly, her aggressive stance melting as she grinned at him, “It really was such a success! All of the parents asked if there would be another one. But with our season starting soon, we don’t know how much time we will have to organize it, even if it is just one weekend a month. We need someone to take the lead, and I think you would be perfect for it!”
, can’t I have the crumble now?”
“Perhaps we will need to consider you spending more time with your godfather in the future, then,” Andromeda pondered aloud.
“Er...right,” Harry mumbled, frowning quizzically as he looked between the two. He was not sure if he should be relieved that they seemed to get on alright, or terrified.
With everyone else preoccupied during the week, and Harry left alone to his own devices, he was vibrating with excitement when the following weekend finally arrived. On Saturday morning, Harry leapt from his bed and rushed to his bathroom to get ready. He did not need to be at Andromeda’s until after lunch, but with no other pressing concerns, and eager to see Teddy, Harry got ready quickly and Apparated to the countryside by 10:00 am.
“Tell me—” he groans, rolling his hips into yours as he huffs a warm breath against your nape.
am the one hurting Teddy. Open your bloody eyes, Potter! Look at the mess you’ve started!”
“Master should always be aware of what is important in the Wizarding World,” Kreacher lectured, one bulbous eye twitching subtly as he glared at Harry.
“Hey, Tedward,” Draco said softly, kneeling beside Harry so that he could look Teddy in his bright green eyes. “We’re okay, I promise. Just some bruises—like when you fell earlier this week, remember?”
Harry could feel his cheeks flaming. He shifted awkwardly in place, casting a quick glance to Malfoy who was focused determinedly on Teddy.
Teddy’s slight body hit the ground with a sickening
The sudden sound of game pieces rolling together, summoned to organize themselves back into their box, echoed in the quiet room, and Harry turned to watch as Draco charmed the game back into order. Draco stood in front of the hearth, the warmth of the fire reflecting off of his pale blond hair, making him nearly glow in the light of the flames.
Teeth dig into your shoulder, possessive, as a hand roams lower, grasping.
“What do you think you are doing? That crumble is for
“Of course,” Harry nodded. He could feel his cheeks begin to heat, embarrassed, though he was unsure of why. “Teddy desperately wants you to read
“Oh...” Harry coughed lightly, shoving his hands into his pockets as he watched Malfoy cork the vial of dittany. “Er...how do you know that?”
You freeze.
earlier this week. Who’s to say he wasn’t out with that bloke again, doing who knows what, ignoring every responsibility he has to Teddy?”
Ron nodded, his eyes crinkling as he looked up at Harry and took a long drink from his Firewhisky, “I reckon he might be, mate.”

“Ah, yes,” Draco hummed. “I assume that she informed you of whom Jesse is
Ginny hummed next to him, drawing her knees to her chest and resting her socked feet on the edge of the kitchen counter as she stared at him.
“No. Potter—you don’t even…you don’t even
“Yes, Ginny,” Harry stared firmly up at Ginny, praying that she didn’t lose her temper and make Teddy more frantic than he already was. “It happens.”
“Wait, Draco, no!

Ashes turned to dirt.
In the overwhelming knowledge that you are
She sighed, pursing her lips in a tight smile as she rubbed a soothing circle on one of his wrists. “It’s about the hierarchy, Harry. Maybe his morphing is related to that. Perhaps a part of Teddy is trying to appease those who he views as being...more superior to him. His alphas, for lack of a better word.”
Harry chuckled, glancing away in embarrassment. “Of course not. Bruises...nasty business, those.”
Malfoy’s shoulders tensed. Harry could see his fingers grasping the counter, knuckles white with the strength of his grip, before suddenly relaxing and falling to his side as Malfoy spun around to face Harry.
Feeling someone watching him, Harry dragged his attention away from where he had been hypnotized by the scene.
He stops in front of you, resting his hands beside your face, caging you in. His voice is low, sure—a threat. “You’d be dead without me, Draco.”
, Harry!” Ginny stuck her tongue out, leaning forward to shove Harry. “And I’ve barely heard from you the past few days. What’s been going on?”
“It means the plants
Andromeda pursed her lips together, corners twitching as if she was holding back laughter. “Well, then. Since you are here, Harry, why don’t you help prepare lunch?”
There was a tight pull to Malfoy’s smile, and Harry could not help but wonder if Malfoy really was going to St. Mungo’s early, but before he could question the other man, Teddy squealed, jumping up and down with delight, before scrambling out of the kitchen to gather his things.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence, Ron,” Harry reached for his wine glass, watching as Ginny excitedly spoke to Hannah through green flames of the Floo, before throwing back the rest of his drink.
How can such a being be so broken, so tragic…when they are so tempting and beautiful?
Pretending to be perfect. A hero.
Reaching for the

“Of course, Aunt ‘Dromeda.”
surely was not one of them.
“Go along then, Tedward. Luncheon will be served shortly. Let us set the table.”
Hermione sucked at her bottom lip for a moment, breathing in deeply as she considered Harry. With a quick exhale of breath, she asked, “What features does he morph into when he is feeling strongly, Harry?”
, Harry!” Teddy squealed as the shop came into sight, owls perched in their cages outside; toads, snakes, rats, Kneazles, and various other magical companions on display in the windows, watching the passersby stroll down the cobblestone streets.
Harry threw his head back and laughed. He bent down and hefted Teddy onto his hips, summoning the trunk to his side. “Of course. Are you ready?”
“Oh, am I?” Malfoy spat, crossing his arms across his narrow chest as he leaned against the sink, “Why else would I be here, Potter? You seem to know everything. Do tell, why
Harry spun around, nearly falling out of his chair in his haste to face Luna. “What? How would

He’s gorgeous, dancing on air, the lights creating a halo against his porcelain skin as he loses himself.

He was met with silence, before Draco questioned stiffly, “What?”
“Ginny…
, so surely he was wrong. Malfoy released a slow breath before nodding, “Alright then, Potter. I will stay. For Tedward.”
You always have been.
Teddy smiled shakily, one dimple pulling at his left cheek as his eyes began to water. His head jerked in an uncoordinated nod. “Yes! Yes—Draco calls me Tedward!”
Perhaps he had no chance.
“Goodbye, Nana!” Teddy smiled up at Andromeda and they watched as she called out Narcissa’s home and stepped into the green flames, Floo-ing out of sight within seconds.
Malfoy’s pale brows rose until they were hidden behind his tousled fringe. “She wanted you to look like...a muggle prostitute?” He questioned, his eyes roaming over Harry’s body again.
“I don’t—“ you gasp, throwing your head back as he bites at your neck, “—I don’t know why…
Draco placed his hands on Teddy’s shoulders and began to slowly guide him back towards the cottage, “Well, then, we must begin to prepare luncheon before Andromeda departs. Come along, Tedward. Potter, be a dear and clean up the brooms, would you?”
“What?” he asked, his high voice muffled by the crumble filling his mouth.
Shadows envelop you, darkness embracing your bodies, temptation licking at you as you succumb to passions that you should not crave.
“What else would he be doing at Andy’s?” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air in exasperation. He didn’t understand how his friends couldn’t see how serious this was.
You’re pretty sure that is what he said…
Andromeda raised her eyebrows as she stared at Harry, as if
This isn’t…
Fuck.
Malfoy huffed, shaking his head in exasperation, as he waved a hand and the music stuttered, beginning once more from the start.
You won’t survive it.
“Well, I don’t know yet, do I?” Harry muttered petulantly, not understanding why Ron and Hermione weren’t taking this seriously, “I’ve only just seen him there! Who knows how long he’s been going there—and what was Andy thinking, even allowing him into her home in the first place?”

Harry moved to help prepare lunch, listening as Teddy began to run down the halls to join them. If Andromeda was so enamored with Malfoy, Harry would have to be more calculating as he discovered Malfoy’s deceptions.
Teddy spun around, nearly falling over in his haste. “Harry?”
Puncturing the skin of your nape, a rough tongue soothing the ache.
you fell from your broom earlier this week.”
“A homeostasis charm. It is used to prolong the effects of any potions used for healing, which in turn amplifies the intended benefits,” Malfoy stated, gaze flickering briefly to look at Harry before he turned back to Teddy.
Andromeda suddenly stood in one fluid movement, brown eyes sparking with fury, “Harry James Potter. What did I tell you about speaking ill of Draco in this house?”
As Harry entered the kitchen, the movement caught Andromeda’s eye and she turned to welcome him from her spot at the kitchen table, hands clasped in her lap and a soft smile lingering on her lips, before she promptly froze in place.
Merlin, he’s beautiful.
Carefully, Harry stood, grimacing at the spasm of pain that shot through his body. Teddy must have seen it because he ran to his side, reaching out to hold Harry’s hand between his own. “Draco, help!” he cried, “Harry is still hurt!”
Teddy skidded to a stop as he slid back into the kitchen, grinning broadly as he looked up at them, “Alright, is it time for crumble yet?!”
around Draco, and he was gone.
?” Harry scoffed. “You heard it! Malfoy is
Ron huffed a laugh, “Of course. He’s a Healer in Training, Harry. And he’s specializing in Emergency Healing, so he’s normally in the Accident and Emergency Department whenever we have to go in after a raid.”
“Yes, Potter.”
” he exclaimed, rolling off of the bed and tripping out of the room. “I’m going to get dressed! Hurry up, we need to go!”
. Surely he would not be staring at Harry’s arse with that particular expression. One of disgust for the hot pink garment, sure, but...while Harry was not sure
They were both staring at him. Hermione’s eyes were narrowed, a thoughtful look on her face, as if she had just reached a rather intriguing hypothesis. Ron, meanwhile, was staring at Harry incredulously, lips parted and nose scrunched.
“Er...” Harry shot an icy glare at George, who only snickered as he walked towards the Pygmy Puff display to return the ball of fluff. There was no way he could get out of this now, he realized, so with a sigh he nodded, resigned to his fate. “Yes. I thought you might like to look at the...er, the Kneazles.”
She smiled innocently, throwing a quick wink his way. Harry stuck his tongue out in response.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, spinning around to look at Harry with affronted eyes. “You can’t
Harry felt Ron’s hand grasp at his arm, fingers digging into his flesh, holding him in place.
For the heat of him.
At least Draco would be easy to find. Harry knew he had a shift at St. Mungo’s on Monday’s, so they could Apparate there and Draco would have everything needed to heal Teddy. “Can I pick you up? Or do you need me to levitate you?”
“You could help out there. Be a barista! Y’know, make those fancy coffee drinks and hand out scones and pastries and whatnot. You’re not bad in the kitchen, I bet you’d do well,” Ron nodded to himself, a grin splitting his flushed face.
Ron grinned, chuckling as he clapped his arm against Draco’s shoulder. “Alright, then.”
“What do you mean,
, Potter. All he had to do was bat those big eyes at you and you nearly fell for it!”
“Harry, I’m getting better!” Teddy exclaimed with a squeal. His tiny hands grabbed at the broom handle securely as he slowly made his way towards Harry, hovering only a few feet above the ground. “I’m ready to go
Turning back to Malfoy and Teddy, he paused, watching as Malfoy ran a dampened tea towel over Teddy’s mouth, cleansing it of any remaining crumbs. The two grinned at one another, Malfoy whispering too quietly for Harry to hear, followed quickly by a peal of laughter from Teddy as a wide grin spread across his face.

as direct or as stern as Malfoy had been, no. But that wasn’t necessarily a
Draco leaned forward, resting his forehead against Harry’s. For a few moments, the room was silent, save for the quiet
Malfoy pursed his lips briefly before kneeling down in front of Teddy like he had in the kitchen. “You know that I would not leave if I did not have to.” His long fingers reached out, gently caressing Teddy’s round cheeks before lifting his chin so that they could look at one another. “You will have a marvelous time with Harry, and I will see you in a couple of days, alright?”
“Good. Now then, shall we prepare lunch?”
“But how?” Harry questioned. “Hermione, Teddy is
“I’m going to beat you!” Teddy called out, leaning closer to his broom as he put on a sudden burst of speed.
Sheepishly, Harry ran a hand through his messy hair, “Er, yes. I didn’t have anything else scheduled this morning so...well, I figured I would come by. Is that okay?”
And yet…
“Only because you made me!” he hissed, glaring at Ginny.
started!? You’re the one who is intruding in his life, Malfoy, when you shouldn’t be there at all! What are you doing, hm? Teaching him
Harry inhaled sharply, a bright grin splitting his lips. “Yeah?”
They were silent for a few moments. It wasn’t awkward though—rather, it was like a balm, comforting at the end of a long day. Harry cleared his throat.
Harry hummed, settling himself between Draco’s spread thighs and wrapping a hand around the base of Draco’s cock. Lazily, he leaned forward, raising his eyes to meet Draco’s heatedly as he wrapped his lips around the head.
“Listen, I—” Harry chewed on his lip for a moment before turning his gaze back to Malfoy. “Teddy and Andromeda...they trust you. Teddy adores you. I’d be a bloody idiot not to realize that.”
He and Draco flew next to one another for a few minutes, quiet as they listened to the excited screams of the children maneuvering their training brooms around miniature goals. Angelina opened a worn trunk, revealing quaffles, bludgers and a snitch, all modified with child-safe charms so that they would hover just beyond their reach and move with little force.
shining within, as bright as the blood surrounding you.
sounded in the distance, and all three of them turned towards the cottage. Silence rang throughout the garden, before a hurried voice called out. “Teddy? Aunt 'Dromeda?”
” Ginny mirrored Harry and placed her hands on her own hips. “How do you not realize where I am going with this?”
?” Teddy pleaded, voice soft and muffled against Draco’s robes.
“But…don’t you think it would be nice?”
Delicately, almost
had been right.
that voice.
Of course Draco’s relationship with Jesse was serious...why wouldn’t it be? They had been photographed at a gala together months prior, and now...
Harry quietly closed the door to Teddy’s room behind him, casting a modified
“Er...thanks for coming over, Draco,” he said softly. “And for healing Teddy earlier.”
, two, three…”
what,” Harry nodded, sure of himself in his vindication.
! He’s at Andy’s home with Teddy, just casually washing dishes, drying his hands like a
Malfoy was looking determinedly over Harry’s shoulder. His pale face was flushed, a rosy hue painted across the apples of his cheeks to the tips of his ears.
“It has been a pleasure, as always,” Malfoy said, striding past Harry towards Andromeda, “I must be off.”
“Or he’s teaching Teddy to morph so they can take over the ministry, free all of the criminals from Azkaban, and start a new Wizarding War!” George exclaimed.
As he walked away from Malfoy, Harry caught Andromeda watching them intently. Her lips twitched as she cocked an eyebrow at Harry in question. He merely shrugged in response, turning to look at the entrance to the kitchen as he heard Teddy storming down the stairs.
Ginny paused, furrowing her brows as she watched him carefully. “What do you mean?”
Melting.
Draco raised an eyebrow, staring down at Teddy bemusedly. “I beg your pardon?”
Secrets.
Turning his gaze back to Teddy, Harry saw his godson’s hair slowly start to morph. The tips of his messy curls began to lose their color, all pigment leeching out from tip to root until all that remained was platinum blonde. Curls lost their bounce, straightening out to a loose, barely-there wave, light from the windows reflecting from the strands.
!” You cry. “Potter, you—you are calling me
, did he want to know.
Leaning back in his chair, Harry twirled the quill between his fingers as he stared at the parchment and the next possibility:
“Now, Teddy. Remember what we must do when Draco has his obligations?” Andromeda chastised softly.
“What?” Harry asked, standing up straighter. He didn’t understand why they were staring at him like this, as if he had done something both incredibly stupid and ingenious.
He cleared his throat self-consciously, wiping his hands against his jeans, before making his way towards the sitting room.
They made their way to the edge of the pitch. As they reached the border, they turned and caught sight of Ron, Ginny, and Jesse. The three of them stood together and waved their hands in farewell, watching as Harry and Teddy departed.
He nodded, his eyes never wavering from Draco’s, “Yes, of course he should.”
Not when flames begin to claim you again, begin to burn, begin to turn you to ash.
Harry snorted, “Oh, is that so?”
“Well, it won’t be so bad. Kneazles are amazing creatures. I’m sure you won’t mind having Gary around Grimmauld,” Hermione smiled, eyes glancing towards where Crookshanks lay sprawled on an armchair.
Why would anyone want you, otherwise?
The kitchen was silent as Harry swallowed his latest morsel. Hesitantly, he raised his eyes to his friends. Ron and Hermione were staring at him, looking equally shocked and exasperated. Luna calmly observed him, head tilted slightly.
A whine echoes throughout the room.
Harry blinked, frowning slightly as he glanced at his friend, “What’s new?”
people!” Teddy sobbed. Andromeda laid a gentle hand on his shoulder, thumb rubbing soothing circles against his back, as he began to tremble. “He fixes people, and saves them, and he didn’t do anything wrong! Take it back!”
—as you are held afloat.
“I’m sure.” Harry agreed, hooded eyes falling to Draco’s lips. “Promise me, though. Promise me, we are not rushing this.”
“Do you realize you’re fucking me on the dance floor?” You whisper, licking at the line of his neck as his fingers curl into your hair.
against his bicep. He jumped back, glaring at Ginny and clutching at his throbbing arm.“Ouch! Bloody hell, Gin! What was that for!?”
“Malfoy was just showing me the proper techniques,” Harry interjected with a groan as he pushed himself up from the ground. As he stood, he glanced at Malfoy to find the other man staring at him in shock. Harry frowned before he realized
Fresh new scars, pink as they’ve only just healed, cut across his wrist.
“Oh, really?” Harry questioned, chewing at the inside of his cheek to keep from chuckling as he turned an inquisitive eye towards Malfoy.
Malfoy gently pressed his lips against the side of Teddy’s head, one hand rubbing soothing circles on the boy’s back, as he whispered back, “I love you, too, Tedward.”
Harry looked up, pausing with his hands submerged in the soapy water, “Really?”
Reluctantly, Harry let go of Draco’s hand.
Malfoy spluttered, his face flushing with fury, “
Andromeda laughed and bent to kiss the crown of Teddy’s head. “Be good for Harry, darling. I will see you in one week.”
Harry felt the corners of his lips twitch as he watched the hearth, remembering how content he felt while cutting tomatoes for their toasties, Teddy and Malfoy at his side.
Harry snorted to himself, lips curling in distaste at the paper as he clenched his jaw. It shouldn’t matter what Malfoy was doing on his evenings. Perhaps Andromeda would see the article and finally realize what a bad influence Malfoy was on Teddy, cutting off all ties with the man.
Harry let out a slow breath. He could figure out what Malfoy was up to later, when Teddy was less upset. For now, he had tomatoes to pick.
“I don’t know what you are talking about, Potter,” Malfoy sneered. Harry took another step forward, pleased as Malfoy took a faltering step back. He continued his advance until he had Malfoy backed up against the nearest bookshelf.
Teddy and Andromeda really did seem to adore him, after all.
, “I will not have you speaking ill of Draco. Not in my home, and never in front of Teddy. You do not know the man that he is now, and I will not have you making ill conceived judgements upon his person. Do you understand me?”
Harry hesitated, a flame of hope burning brighter within him, before whispering, “Really?”
“Look at you!” George roared, laughing as he picked Teddy up and threw him into the air. Teddy squealed, his arms windmilling wildly as he hovered for a moment, George casting a wandless levitation charm, before falling and being caught by the freckled man. “Why, if it isn’t the newest Weasley!”
“I beg your pardon?”
Draco blinked, wide-eyed as he stared at Harry, lips parted. His eyes flickered across Harry’s face before they settled, shining brighter than he had ever seen them, on Harry’s own.
than Harry expected—which he doubted, since Malfoy had never seemed to be a particularly powerful a wizard—or something else was going on to make Andromeda not only allow Malfoy to be a part of Teddy’s life, but to defend him with such conviction.
Teddy whimpered, inhaling shakily before nodding his head in acquiescence. Draco held a hand out and Teddy immediately grasped it, squeezing it tightly between his small fingers.
yet—Teddy ran back to them, skidding to a halt in front of Harry.
Harry exhaled heavily, nearly collapsing against the wall in his relief that Teddy would be okay.
Where are you?
!” Teddy repeated. His bottom lip began to tremble, and Teddy quickly sucked it between his teeth in an effort to stop it. “You’re wrong! Draco isn’t bad, take it back!”
“What?” Teddy tilted his head back so that he could stare directly at Malfoy. “Aren’t you staying for lunch?”
you liked Draco. You aren’t exactly subtle when it comes to him, you know.”
Shakily, Harry released his breath, running a hand through his messy curls as he heard Teddy start to call for him from the garden, reminding himself that this
He grinned as Teddy squealed and skipped to the kitchen table. With a deft flick of his wand, Harry levitated the pot of soup from the hob, reveling in the domesticity of setting the table for lunch.
Harry nodded.
What was it that Hermione had told him the other evening?
Harry quickly bit his lip, holding his breath in an effort to keep from bursting with laughter at the image of his godson, innocently placing the wooden spoon back into the counter.
Draco nodded, pulling the blankets securely around himself as he sat up. “I did.”
. So now obviously he hates me. And why wouldn’t he!? Merlin, what else would you think of the man who wants your bloody perfect boyfriend?”
“What?” Harry spluttered. “I do
A sharp inhale of breath broke his attention, and he looked up into Malfoy’s eyes, widened in shock and pupils blown as he stared back at Harry.
! Teddy
Maybe this
and you know that it’s true.
“It’s just that you have had this obsession with him before. And other than helping Neville with his shop, there’s not much to distract you right now,” she explained carefully.
How much they love you.
Kreacher narrowed one eye at Harry, staring at him as if Harry were a moron. “Yes. Kreacher asked if Master was needing his clothes to be washed. Master said yes, so Kreacher has started the wash.”
When they were far enough away that Harry could no longer hear Draco or Jesse, Ron cleared his throat.
It’s so hard to speak...to say no.
“Coming, Teddy.” Harry spared one more glance around the kitchen, making sure that everything was in order, before turning to stride from the room.
“Of course, darling. Now, behave for Harry,” Andromeda ran a hand through Teddy’s turquoise locks before making her way around the kitchen table. She paused briefly next to Harry, placing a firm hand on his shoulder and squeezing, just once, lips twitching in a smirk as she strode out of the kitchen.
“I do?”
“Draco?”
“It’s done?” He asks once more.
Harry’s eyebrows slowly rose as he stared at his best friend. Ron had calmed in the five years since the war, maturing with his experience as an Auror. And yet, Harry had never once thought that Ron would ever reference Malfoy as being competent. Ron’s hatred of Malfoy had always rivaled Harry’s own. This sudden respect was unprecedented. Harry had no idea how to react, beyond staring incredulously as Ron turned back to the stew.
Andromeda offered a quick smile and nod. Malfoy squeezed Teddy’s shoulder one last time before he turned and strode away, not sparing a single glance towards Harry.
it feels good…
A low rumble echoed throughout Draco’s chest. His fingers drifted down Harry’s body, lingering at his shoulders, his side, the curve of his back, fingering the waistband of his jeans before dipping beneath and clutching at the flesh of Harry’s arse.
Hermione hummed, lifting the tumbler to her lips and taking a delicate sip before setting it back on the side table.
Teddy’s hair began to lighten as he gazed up at Harry, morphing to a sandy blond, before a cough sounded to his side.
They encompass you; burn you.
Harry gazed up into Draco’s eyes, entranced as he watched pupils dilate, surrounded by a thin ring of silver, shakily releasing a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
Turning the corner, Harry leaned against the doorway, resting against it as he had the previous week, watching the scene before him.
“I’m afraid I cannot join you,” Malfoy said, running a comforting hand through Teddy’s hair as the boy let out a squawk of dismay, “I only came by to apologize for having to miss our morning engagement, but I must get back.”
Fingers digging into hips, pulling you close. Secrets whispered against your neck, a firm line grinding against your arse—a tempting rhythm.
Harry ran a shaky hand through his hair, swallowing thickly as he stood in front of the entrance to the kitchen. He suddenly felt anxious, but was unsure why. Teddy would surely be excited that he was there early. And it did
They stared at one another for a moment. It felt as if the air vibrated between them—nearly thrumming with tension. Harry lifted a shoulder in an awkward shrug, one side of his lips sheepishly pulling into a lopsided smile as he looked at Draco. “What do you say, Draco?”
As soon as the door clicked shut behind them, Draco turned icy grey eyes towards Harry. His voice was cold, devoid of any warmth he had while speaking to Teddy. “Stay here while I get Maggie.”
“Teddy,” Harry laughed, shaking his head, “we are going to be
“Why are you being so selfish?!”
…not really.
Draco’s hands on him were firm, kneading at his cheeks, pulling them apart until Harry could feel cool air caressing the cleft of his arse. He was just about to question what Draco was waiting for when the bed shifted and he felt a hot huff of air against his entrance.
Harry looked over at Hermione, dumbstruck. He could understand Luna’s forgiving nature. However, hearing both Ron and Hermione sound like they could put the past behind them when it came to Malfoy...he didn’t understand what was going on.
, Draco. So I brought him here. I...” Harry glanced to the side. He could feel his cheeks begin to heat. “Well, I didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t say no to him.”
His platinum hair reflects the heat of the fire, silken locks glowing with their vengeance. Your eyes lock on his—molten silver, filled with such heat that it
Harry didn’t move from the counter as he watched Malfoy wash the dirty dishes, his eyes roaming the other man’s pale form. Malfoy’s shoulders were tense as he stood straight, stiffly lifting a freshly cleaned bowl from the sink and deftly placing it to his left to dry.
, it burns in the best way.
You can trust him.
Harry stood back and stared for a moment. Despite using magic, Kreacher’s laundry regimen was thorough and cumbersome, and there was no way his clothes would be ready before he had to go to Andromeda’s cottage.
A voice calls out, echoing down a hallway. You turn your head, peering over the top of the sofa as footsteps begin to approach.
“Maybe she thought Teddy should get to know some of his family?” Ron interjected with a shrug as he sat back down.
Maggie stood in the doorway, her eyes twinkling with amusement.
And yet.
“Yes, of course,” Harry hurried over towards Malfoy and Teddy. He focused on the cooktop, determined not to meet  Malfoy’s judgmental gaze. “So, er...what are we making?”
Draco blinked slowly, gaze calculating as he watched Harry. After a moment, he smiled apologetically. “Thank you for the offer, Harry. But I have an early shift in the morning and I doubt Teddy would wake before I left.”
?” Harry spluttered.
I cannot leave him there, dancing by himself. He’ll hang himself—a rope of his choosing tied to a tree—wrapped in the pleasure of what he finds on the dance floor.
“What happened?” Draco asked, striding towards Teddy. He stood on the opposite side of the bed from Harry, running long fingers through Teddy’s hair as his other reached for his wand, deftly beginning a slew of diagnostic charms.
good at convincing Harry of what he wanted.
in sixth year!”
“Wh—you!” Harry spluttered. Of
“Mm...” Ginny hummed, leaning back contemplatively against the arm of the loveseat. “If I lose, and you last more than one week at the café, I’ll convince the Harpies to let you try out our new brooms—maybe keep one of the prototypes.”
“They did not!” Harry hissed. Ginny merely snorted, placing her wine glass precariously on the arm of the loveseat as she sprawled back against the cushions.
“Er...yeah, it was,” Harry stumbled for a moment, thrown by the sudden spark in Andromeda’s eyes as she watched him.
“Yes,” Harry hissed, clenching his teeth together in frustration. How many bloody Malfoy’s worked at St. Mungo’s, anyway? Just to be sure the welcomewitch understood, he clarified, “Draco Malfoy.”
“I can’t force this on a child.”
Harry glanced at Malfoy, whose porcelain cheeks were gradually beginning to flush. Regretting it almost instantly, Harry looked away. He did not want to see the smirk that would surely be painted across Malfoy’s lips as he prepared to mercilessly tease Harry.
“Alright, dear,” Andromeda nodded her acceptance and looked once more at Harry. Her sharp eyes narrowed, observing him quietly for a moment. “Behave.”
Teddy’s eyes were squeezed shut. He clutched at his leg, head tilted towards the ground as his tears soaked into the dirt, his sobs muffled by the earth beneath him.
Draco exhaled slowly, pressing a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead before standing up. “I will see you soon, Tedward.” He glanced quickly at Harry, head tilting in a question. “If your godfather allows it, perhaps I will visit you while you reside with him this week.”
In the middle of the night…
After all, why wouldn’t you?
“I see,” Hermione nodded slowly. She steepled her fingers together and pressed them against her lips, eyes sparkling as she stared at him. “Do you have any thoughts about that?”
“No!” Teddy wailed, staring up at Harry with wide eyes, wet with tears that readily fell down his flushed cheeks. He sobbed, his breath quickening as he began to panic, quick huffs of air as he choked out, “I—want—
“Yes, Potter,” Draco snapped, and Harry could not help wincing as Draco reverted to his surname, after they had made so much progress recently. “It may surprise you, but I am quite good at what I do.”
Teddy raised his arms, his fingers grasping at the air as Malfoy stood up. Malfoy huffed a quiet laugh before bending down again and lifting Teddy up, shifting so that the boy rested on his hip.
Teddy’s bright eyes locked on Harry’s. Shining beneath a messy fringe of platinum blond curls were brilliant emerald irises, flecks of silver lending them an ethereal sparkle.
Potter freezes, lips sealed around your nipple and one hand against your cock.
“Well...I mean, he didn’t seem to particularly like me, did he?” Harry started, lifting his shoulders in an awkward shrug. “And I don’t blame him, I guess.”
to him. Apparently I’m not as good at it as you are.” He laughed quietly, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco stood in the doorway, a halo of light from the hallway highlighting his figure, bright eyes frantic as they flickered around the room, settling on Teddy immediately. His platinum hair was a mess, strands sticking up in every direction, cheeks flushed and breath heavy, as if he had ran down the corridors in his haste to get to them rather than pausing to Apparate.
“Draco can come visit us tonight!” Teddy chirped. “Please, Draco, will you? You can come to Grimmauld and play games and we can have a
Malfoy frowned, cheeks flushing as he huffed upon seeing his clean fingers. “Are you just fucking with me, Potter? Or is your eyesight truly that bad?”
“Can you...can you make Harry
Perhaps, Harry thought as he slid their pizzas into the oven, it wasn’t Malfoy that was up to something.
Teddy took that moment to look over at them, his turquoise hair shining brightly in the sunlight as he waved frantically before taking a sharp turn and chasing after an auburn-haired boy, screaming, “Jamie, wait!”
“What do you mean,
Teddy took a deep breath, leaning forward on his broom and staring, determined, at the lemon tree in the distance. “Alright. Three...two-
He watched, hypnotized as his tan fingers pressed into the pale flesh of Malfoy’s cheeks. A deep flush was spreading across those cheeks, and Harry wondered if it was from the pressure of his own thumb against the porcelain skin.
Harry nearly choked on his own tongue.
“He’ll be here soon, Teddy. Don’t worry.”
“No—Harry, please.
“I am afraid that Draco is not here to offer his expertise. He got held up this morning.” Andromeda’s eyes did not move as she spoke, set firmly upon Harry.
In the
Harry’s breath left him with a forced
The Chosen One and
“Er...we were racing. And, well,” he hesitated, biting at his lower lip, glancing sheepishly at Draco before quickly looking away when he realized that Draco’s focus was solely on the child in front of him. “Teddy fell from his training broom.”
Distantly, Harry heard a sharp
“I love you.
“Harry, I’m ready!” Teddy called out, stampeding back down the stairs. “Let’s go!”
Maybe he could also ask Malfoy for some advice the following weekend. The man seemed to know his way around a kitchen, after all. Surely talking to him about it couldn’t hurt.
Unless, of course, Malfoy made fun of him in response.
Sharp whispers—
“Er...Hangover Potion, Kreacher...please,” Harry squeezed his eyes shut again, clutching the sheets around him in an effort to stop the room from spinning.
shot out of the Burrow, the ethereal form of a goose settling between the porch and the gardens. It paused, glancing between the two groups, before its beak parted and Molly’s strong voice called out, “Brunch is ready. Come along inside, now. And make sure that you do not muddy my floors—that means you, George!”
He was met with silence.
“What?” Harry inhaled sharply. “What do you mean, to ensure that
“Yes, absolutely!”
Harry groaned, resting his elbows against his knees as he leaned forward, fingers grasping desperately at his hair.
Malfoy’s thin, pink lips parted on an inhale as he slowly shook his head from one side to the other. “No.
“Shit—” Harry spat, pulling at the handle of his broomstick in a belated effort to prevent himself from crashing. Frantically, Harry swerved to the side. His eyes caught on Draco’s, wide and horrified, before they collided.
She had left none other than her bloody
He would meander throughout London, stopping in cafés and various stores, exploring gardens, thinking about how much Draco would enjoy this or that, how nice it would be to have the man at his side.
“Yes. Or rather, a Healer in Training,” Malfoy lifted one shoulder in a graceful shrug, a soft flush beginning to color his pale cheeks. “You must complete two years in training before you become a certified Healer.”
Harry stumbled on his next step as his arm was pulled backwards. He glanced behind him, tilting his head in a question as Teddy stood frozen, staring up at Harry with wide grey eyes.
“Can we not talk about Neville’s shop,
you.”
Harry chuckled and walked towards Teddy, running his fingers through messy turquoise hair, “Of course. Go ahead and say goodbye, then we can head to Grimmauld.”
“Oh, er, thank you.” Harry felt himself flush at her assumption that he would ask where they were before inquiring about how she was. “And...how are you, Andy?”
Being there early had absolutely nothing to do with Malfoy.
It felt like family.
With the assurance that no one was seriously injured, the crowd began to disperse, returning to the camp and stands.
“Sure,” Harry agreed, “I don’t think Andy thinks so, though. She wasn’t too pleased when we brought Gary back on Sunday. He’ll have to stay with me, and Teddy will just visit him on the weekends.”
You’re so
of the Floo again, indicating Ginny’s departure.
,” Ron’s eyebrows rose nearly to his hairline, his eyes widening meaningfully as he stared at Harry, as if trying to transfer his thoughts by virtue of the intensity of his gaze alone.
Teddy suddenly jumped from his perch on the end table. He smiled brightly as he skipped towards Andromeda. “I told Harry that he didn’t understand the importance of the waltz, Nana!”
“Does that mean—” Teddy inhaled sharply, a bright grin splitting his face. His eyes widened dramatically, shining brightly with his excitement, and his hair began to morph, shifting quickly between blond and black. “Does that mean that you are
Gods, but it would be
“Well, mate,” Ron set his glass down, sucking his teeth, “I hope you know what you’ve gotten yourself into this time.”
Malfoy furrowed his brows, looking at Harry in confusion, his nostrils flaring. “I beg your pardon?”
With a cheeky wave from Teddy, he and Draco disappeared into the cottage, leaving Harry standing alone in the garden, Teddy’s training broom and Draco’s
Teddy squirmed, burrowing further into Draco’s side, though his eyes did not leave Harry’s. One corner of his mouth rose in a small smile, a dimple that had never been there before appearing on his cheek.
Like looking into a fire, into fiery emerald eyes, you cannot look away.
Harry didn’t bother to make up an excuse. “Er, no...I’m sorry Teddy, but no.”
You lean forward, breaths mingling, groans hiding behind gasps, silent screams…
“I know, Tedward. But you know that sometimes I must leave when I do not want to,” Malfoy’s voice was soft, soothing as Harry stood outside of the kitchen. The warmth Harry had first heard upon entering the library was back, quiet and directed solely to his godson. Harry hesitated outside of the kitchen, frowning. Malfoy had always been a dramatic prat, but his theatrics had never been very convincing. He sounded sincere enough, now, that Harry briefly wondered how much of it was manufactured.
You let yourself drown…
“Er...” Harry looked down at his feet, shuffling back and forth in place. “Ginny and I made a bet. She may have won.”
“You know…little ones.”
Laughter echoed through the cottage halls from the direction of the sitting room, and Harry quickly made his way towards it. Gary meowed excitedly before leaping from Harry’s shoulder and running ahead.
“Er...” Harry blinked dumbly. Of all of the stupid, provocative things he had spoken in an effort to rile Malfoy up, this was
“My bloodline!”
and things. Snakes!”
“Oh God, Gin, really?” Harry rolled his eyes and Ginny laughed loudly, pushing herself up from where she sat. She kissed the top of his head before making her way towards the entryway to the kitchen.
“...What?”
“Not today, I’m afraid. I am due at St. Mungo’s this afternoon.”
Ron hummed quietly, though he said nothing else. They watched the remainder of the camp silently from the sidelines.
can hurt you...right?”
Harry groaned, morning-damp dew seeping into his clothes. His body ached, throbbing in pain.
“Kreacher,” Harry croaked, wincing as a sharp
Andromeda chuckled, “Yes. It is something we may discuss later, if it is of interest to everyone.”
“What the hell do you think you’re playing at, Malfoy?” he spat. Malfoy didn’t move, standing his ground, his shoulders tight and hands clenched by his side.
Teddy cheered, pulling his hand from Andromeda’s and skipping down the hallway, while Andromeda serenely followed behind him. Harry watched them go before turning back to the kitchen sink, still full of suds with clean dishes drying neatly beside it, wondering what the fuck had just happened.
“Teddy, of course. Can you imagine? Seeing the two men that he loves most in the world, so at odds with one another,” Luna’s wide eyes focused on Harry once more. “The poor dear.”
“Please,” Teddy whispered once more, bottom lip jutting out slightly and beginning to quiver.
“Ah, a splendid choice!” The man slowly walked from behind the counter, gesturing towards the side of the shop. “Our finest Kneazles are right this way, young man.”
“I saw you five days ago. How am I a stranger?” Harry asked, swatting his soapy hand against Ginny’s thigh and leaving a wet mark on her jeans.
