“Well what should I do? Who do you think she was referring too? Blonde hair and grey eyes?” Harry was really sketched out by this and the fact that Hermione wasn’t all over this was quite concerning.
As Harry strained the pasta through the sieve, he briefly heard the water from the shower turn off, and thought back to the blond. He let his mind wander to what the blond was doing right then; probably grabbing his towel, drying off his silky, pale skin, as water droplets drip off every part of his his body- Harry was thrown out of his thoughts as he almost dropped the pot of pasta. He quickly returned the pot to the stove and grabbed two bowls from the cupboard. He carefully filled both bowls, poured some tomato sauce on top, sprinkled some parmesan on as well. He placed both bowls across from each other at the table and filled two glasses with water as Draco quietly entered the kitchen.
Draco took another deep breath and answered “Well, I read a little about it from what I could find in the library. With you being an Alpha and me an Omega - and you can smell me, does that - does that mean we're mates?”
“Paint me white.” was all Harry said when he felt Draco losing it, causing him to have one of the strongest orgasms ever.
“I just had Kreacher fix it up with a few cleaning spells. Nothing big.” He shrugged, putting the cup down on the desk and slipping his hands in his pockets.
“Yeah, ‘Mione, I’m ok.” He took a sip of the water, clearing his throat of the harsh feeling left behind.
Harry shrugged. “It's nothing.” Then he thought for a minute and thought about his plans for the day. “Oh, also, Hermione is supposed to be coming over for a while after work, but that's not until 6. Just thought I'd let you know.”
“You’re telling me.” Harry said as he took another swing of his second beer. He was comfortably buzzed and had the sudden urge to get home and cuddle Draco. They said their goodbyes with a hug and a promise to get together soon, then parted ways.
Harry and Draco nodded. It was so much to take in and process. Draco grabbed Harry's hand unseeingly, chewing on his lip.
“I don’t want to talk about this, Draco. We’ve already had this discussion. Give us some time and we’ll revisit it in a little while.”
“Well, what do we do now?” Harry asked. “We can’t even joke about anything because of this damn prophecy?” he was getting aggravated. This whole situation just put him on edge. The fact that he couldn’t go home to sleep in his own bed because he had to be here due to this damn prophecy.
“Holy fuck, Potter, Harry I mean. You fucking ruined me.” Draco said, giggling wetly, wiping his face then wrapping his hands around Harry’s neck.
This caused Harry to laugh a little harder before being silenced as Draco's icy glare intensified. “I'm sorry love. You're just so cute.” He wrapped his arms back around Draco and buried his face in his neck once more.
Harry regaled the whole story of what just happened in the bathroom to his best friends. They were both shocked when Harry told them about how Malfoy acted when he was struck with the sectumsempra.
“I will curse you, you know. And I’ll spell your mouth shut too. Permanently.” Harry said matter of factly.
“What’ll it be, Draco?” the barman asked. Draco had visited John’s pool hall/bar since he took over his business five years prior. He and his employees would play pool after a particularly frustrating day, or just to have a night out with each other.
“Well, she told you not to heed this as a warning, but a guide. I mean, I’m definitely curious, but I wouldn’t be too worried if I were you.” Hermione said, taking out her homework from her bag.
Snape met the two outside, keeping them back while permitting the rest of the students forward. He glared at Harry, then scoffed at Malfoy.
“So, as you two are aware, you were engaging in intimate activities before it occurred. Keep in mind, that wasn’t what caused it. You had stopped for a moment, however, to converse, jokingly, obviously, about Harry going to find someone who would, well, you know, ‘do the job’.” The boys both blushed furiously at her words. “This, now, I know it might sound crazy, but you know how you two had to join in matrimony under the pretense of a prophecy? Well, this ‘joke’ had somewhat angered it in a way. It didn’t approve of the thought of Harry finding someone else to engage in intercorse with, seeing as that is one of the most sacred acts of marriage. And since you two were already in that position, it made the notion even more drastic. So, the prophecy gave a sort of warning, shocking Harry in a way, seeing as he was the one who brought it up. This caused his seizure. Again, I know it’s a long shot and it is a theory of sorts, but it all adds up.”
“My father did work within the Ministry, you know. He was always going on about the Aurors and their ‘brash privileges’.”
Draco was expecting it, seeing as Harry had just brought it up in the kitchen. He took in a deep breath, bit his lip, and nodded. “Yes.” He whispered. He looked up to see Harry’s lips pursed in a thoughtful way, but continued before he could respond. “But how did you know?”
Draco approached the mailing door on the basement floor in the Ministry of Magic, pushing it open and watching it swing closed behind him. He regarded the room and its few occupants, everyone stopping to watch him. There were maybe 4 gentlemen and one woman, all tall and intimidating-looking, watching Draco with curious expressions.
Hermione nodded. She told them he was in the common room and offered to send a patronus to get him to come up.
“Well, Ronald, since we are to spend the rest of our lives together, lest we die, we decided to put our past animosity behind us and actually get to know each other.” Harry said.
He sat on the bed as he watched Harry strip off his shirt and move to the bathroom to wash up. He admired the lean muscles that shone proudly on his back, the dark skin encasing them against his bones. He wanted to touch, to run his fingers over them to feel how strong they really were; he wanted to taste, to lick and suck at the supple skin...
‘Alpha’s scents don’t affect Omegas, as Omega’s scents affect Alphas. The Alphas always claim the Omegas, what with their protective traits and all. Some might even say possessive. Alphas always find their Omegas. Alphas and Omegas can only mate with each other. They can have sex with other humans, but they won’t be able to produce offspring without their mate. A great thing about that is that if an Alpha and an Omega are mates and from the same sex, they can still have children. During the Omega’s heats, both bodies morph to be able to produce offspring. When Alpha and Omegas first appeared, they were always of the opposite sex; overtime, their magic and genes changed to accompany both sexes. This allowed for easier reproduction when Alphas found a mate.’
Harry was debating on looking for trunks in Draco’s suitcases, but he was pretty sure they wouldn’t fit. (Mostly because Harry was of a thicker build than that of his husband.) So Harry went with the only other option he could think of.
Then it hit him. He briefly let go of Harry, trying to avoid the hurt look on his best mate's face, and grabbed his wand from his nightstand before settling back onto Harry's bed and pulling him into a hug. Harry seemed to have calmed down a bit, but he was still crying quietly and sucking his thumb, so Ron quickly waved his wand. "
They had barely been gone for 5 minutes before Mrs Umbridge came back in, a sadistic smile on her ugly face. Harry gulped.
Harry woke up tucked in a huge bed, still wearing Remus’ sweater and his boxers and wrapped up in a heavy, downy duvet. He smiled to himself, stretching like a cat and rolling his neck before padding barefooted out of the room. The floors of the hallway were rustic stone and he felt a shiver run through his whole body as he made his way towards what he thought might be the living room. He was right, and when he entered, he saw Remus curled up on one of the armchairs, a large cup of coffee in his hands.
Harry took his hand and the two of them walked to the cab, which was the start of their trip home; the next chapter.
Wait, what? Did Potter actually just ask him out after he thought that Draco had? This was a big misunderstanding. Draco paused, considering the notion. He thought back to the severe attraction he had for the man. Well, one date couldn’t hurt... “I might…” Draco said.
“Oh, no you don’t.” SHe whispered in his ear. “You need to accept the consequences of this, Harry. Stay put.”
Late in the evening, one would consider it nighttime, Harry came padding down the rickety stairs and into the kitchen. Draco could hear him from the nearby sitting room, where he was busying himself with a book. He followed his husband into the kitchen to see how he was doing. After giving Harry space for the majority of the day, Draco thought it safe to see how he was feeling.
“Outside my classroom this morning, you were fine with, some would say wanted, Malfoy to stay with you during these two periods. So, you had somehow managed to cause a curse to inflict a totally different part of another wizard, than what it was intended for. Then you proceed to be left with said wizard after the damage you had done, then proceed, again, to want the wizard to stay with you, to not be taken from your space. Tell me Potter, tell me, why? Why do all these things add up to the fact that you could have just taken an unsuspecting wizard and turned him into your little… play thing? Why, Potter?”
“Uh, yeah, it came up. She was pretty determined to get it out of me that I want to be a healer. Even talked to Pomfrey about it.” He said with a shrug.
"Good going mate. I'm with 'Mione on this one. That is not something you want to be doing in court." Ron said, placing a hand on Hermione's shoulder. "And since when has Malfoy become Draco?" Ron asked, looking at Harry with a raised eyebrow.
“Harry!” A body with a head of bushy hair flew into his arms and wrapped him in a bone crushing hug as soon as they stepped in.
Draco untangled himself and rolled over. He threw the blankets off of himself in a heap. Merlin, he was hot. His breathing came fast and ragged, and his sweat soaked through his silk pyjamas.
Arri Walkins entered the room with the air of a wisp: gentle and elegant. Her frail composition suiting her well. She came over to the bed, shaking both Harry and Draco’s hand with a quiet introduction, before turning to Hermione too.
“Merlin, no, that’s not why I’m-. Hmph.” He sighed. “I just enjoyed it, and I want to do it again.” Harry drifted off, getting quieter after each word.
He dreamt the whole thing. He must have. That’s the only explanation for the blackness that coated everything and the warm comfort that surrounded his bones like sleep.
When he turned around to face the rest of the mailing room, he came face to face with one of the men that were working.
“Ok, but it kind of makes sense. It affects you more because when we first got married, you clearly weren’t happy about it, but I’d liked you from way before, so the prophecy doesn’t affect me as much. However, during our honeymoon, you just started to like me and it went quite fast, so I’m thinking it was you being more lenient around me, so the prophecy took advantage and you started to fall in love without really feeling it.
“Before class, you also showed a...willingness to be with Malfoy, or for Malfoy to be amongst your company, during my lectures. This information now leads me to believe there was another reason as to why all of this doesn’t add up. You supposedly cast an unknown curse at Malfoy, who was incapasitated at the time of the duel, which effectively altered his mental state. Which I, being the creator of said curse, knows that the spell was not meant to cause any harm aside from physical. Now, being the…
Harry was just about to comment ‘as long as it keeps you quiet,’ before Malfoy leaned in ever so slightly and brought their lips together. Because of the awkward position and the fact that he was tied up, he ended up leaning against Harry like a stiff board.
“Fucking, dammit Draco.” Harry said, releasing his wrists and letting him up. As soon as Draco sat up, Harry grabbed his cheeks and pulled him into a rough kiss, making out with him with all the passion he could muster. Eventually they pulled apart, breathing heavily.
“It is a very big possibility. I, actually, had come up with a similar theory as to why. That is why I came to speak with you two.” she gestured to the men.
He knew he was acting childish but admitting he was sick meant that he had weaknesses. And although he knew Harry wouldn't care, Draco hated when Harry saw him in vulnerable states. Unless, of course, they were both in a specific vulnerable state, which of course, was more pleasurable than concerning.
He quickly showered, dressed and made his way down to the kitchen where he saw the elegant blond sitting and eating his breakfast while reading 'The Daily Prophet'.
“Our friend. Hermione Granger, mentioned to us a possibility of what caused this. A theory of sorts.” he nodded towards Hermione.
“Attached? You’re saying that Malfoy attached himself to me? In-in what sense? Does he, oh Merlin. He liked me, doesn’t he?” Harry hid his face in his hands, the thought of Draco Malfoy liking him being to hard to bear.
“...so now I work for PSIMS. My line of work, in the bloody Ministry of Magic, is called PSIMS. I am so over this. I quit.”
Snape stuttered and sputtered before gritting out “Seeing as you are ‘feeling better’, I shall be going. And I will be contacting your father.” He said in a menacing way that meant trouble.
“I-I’m so sorry, so sorry. I didn’t mean that. I shouldn’t have- I’m sorry. I don’t want to die. I don’t.” Draco continued to sob as he apologized for what he had said.
Harry stirred and rolled over to see his Draco almost in tears. “Baby? Oh baby what's wrong?” He sat up and Draco wasted no time before he flew into his arms.
Draco smirked. “Also, if I were you, I wouldn’t use that little pet name you’ve given me, out in public, unless you want me to strip you down naked, fuck you hard and fast for everyone to see, then have you come, untouched, as I fill your beautiful arse with my seed, painting you white inside. Got it?” Harry nodded, breathing hard and fast, eyes wide. “Good.”
“Do what?” Draco could only ask before he felt a pull by his navel, Potter’s scent and arms surrounding him.
“I did too, but there really is no reason to. I realized that when I saw you dressed like that… then you said, ‘this is for my bonded’ and I realized that would be me. But then I thought what if I wasn’t to be your bonded, and you were referring to someone else? I just got so angry at the thought of anyone else seeing you like that or touching you like I do. I knew then that there was no way I would ever let you go. I know you meant it was for me, and that I am to be your bonded, but that was really a wake up call. Then the way I lost control because of you… Draco, you have more control over me than I do of anyone, even myself. You contain more power in the way you control me, than I do in my whole being, magic and all. You own me entirely. There is no one else I want, there is no one else that will have you. And I realize that now.” Harry explained, looking deeply into Draco’s soul.
He stepped out and stood at the end of the aisle, for everyone to view. Sweat beaded on his forehead, heart thumped as if he just ran a marathon, head pounding like a hammer, and vision softly blurred around the edges. His eyes caught one particular blue petal in front of him, and he wished more than anything that he was just that: a useless piece of organic material that would be swept away at the end of the day. He continued his mantra almost like a prayer, as he slowly lifted his head. Green met grey before
“Come in.” Harry said quietly, beckoning him forward. He was sufficiently covered with bubbles, maintaining his privacy, so he was ok to let the blond in.
“That sounds like fun. Better than what I’ll be doing, probably.” Harry chimed in, clearly trying to lift the mood.
Draco knocked, mainly just for respect. When he didn’t hear anything come from within, he tried the knob and realized it was unlocked. When he entered, Harry wasn’t in, but there were a couple chairs in the corner, as well as a decent couch off to the one wall. He sat and decided to wait for him.
“Oh? Must be my lucky day.” Draco said with a laugh. The previous week’s events had been replaced with another busy week’s filled itinerary. He had not heard nor seen hide or hair from Potter. He wouldn’t let some outrageous encounter from his old school rival ruin anymore of his time.
When they both returned to the reception, Ron and Draco were immersed in what looked like an important discussion, Harry almost felt bad for intruding. As he and Hermione approached the head table, Ron and Draco stood at once. Ron pulled Hermione to her seat and they fell into a hushed conversation as they began to eat their dinner.
When their plates emptied and several glasses of wine later, Draco wasn’t expecting Harry to ask him: “What do you like to do in your spare time.”
“I know, that’s why I do it.” Harry giggled. He gasped at the resounding smack that skipped across his bum cheeks.
“Yeah, but you’re good at saving the wizarding world, it’s something you were smart to pursue because no one can do it like you can.” Draco said, emphasising with hand gestures.
He gently removed himself from around Harry and walked back to their room. He threw on a pair of Harry's old boxers cause they were extremely comfortable and they kept him cool in the summer. When he got ready for bed that night, he hadn’t realized he'd have to break them out so soon. Not that he was complaining though.
“Anyways,” She emphasized, fixing her hair. “I can tell. You know how I can tell? You’re smiling like a great big buffoon, and you’re wearing a turtleneck which you haven’t worn since Hogwarts. So you’re either planning on changing your career path to become a gay French fashion designer who never sells his items, only displays them on really fancy fashion runways, or you’re hiding a hickey. I personally think it’s the latter, seeing as you love your job and your fashion, although an expensive taste, is somewhat subpar to what those hands can do when it comes to colour and a curling iron.” When he didn’t say anything, just looked at her with wide eyes, she continued with a smirk. “So, tell me. How’d it happen?”
Draco drifted off and averted his gaze back down to his shoes. Harry took this opportunity to try and comfort the Omega. He wrapped him back up in his burly embrace once again, holding the blond to his chest, feeling their heartbeats sync in a rhythmic pattern of thumps.
Healer Walkins nodded along. “Yes, that sounds about right. It is very possible that the magic traces from the prophecy are enough to inflict pain when it can’t sense the other’s magical core.”
“Yes, actually. I checked on him this morning, and still, his physical abilities still look good and healthy. His magical core is much stronger. I’ve consulted a Spell-Damage specialist, and she took an immediate interest in your case. I was just on my way to bring her to you and Mr Potter for her to consult with you directly.”
“They’re ready for you soon.” A man Harry had seen running around the building during wedding preparations but didn’t bother learning his name, announced as he peaked into the room.
“But I know you’re enjoying it.” Malfoy said, rubbing his hand along the inseam of Harry’s leg. “And all the things I’d do to you with my mouth...why would you ever want it spelled shut?” He asked, peering up at Harry through lidded lashes.
“Yes, yes, it’s me. Have you seen Har-Potter?” Draco said, getting right to the point. He wasn’t interested in small talk with the redhead, knowing it would be a dull experience. And as for calling him Potter, he didn’t want Weasley to know anything suspicious was going on with him and Harry as he wasn’t sure if Harry told his friends about them, seeing the shock on Weasley’s face.
“- then they’re gonna ask personal questions, which you should be able to handle, they shouldn’t be too hard. They know to avoid things like financial details, but you know those hungry vultures.”
Draco smiled softly at him. Harry, being entranced by his beauty, tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. “Merlin….” He said almost inaudibly.
The heat helped to soothe his aching muscles and morning headache quite well. He didn’t hear Malfoy for a few minutes, so he thought he must’ve left. As he was finishing up, he heard the ruse of fabric behind him and turned around to see a very pale, very naked, and very much there Draco Malfoy.
They came together, the squeeze of Draco’s arse around his cock as he came, pushed Harry to follow a second behind him.
Harry closed his eyes and curled up against Draco. He quickly fell asleep again, missing the words the blond said “You’re not going to make this easy, are you?”
He shrugged. “Because he’s Malfoy. I can’t stand the git. Of all people I could’ve been forced to marry it had to be him.” He ran a hand down his face.
“Are you excited to go home?” Harry whispered to him. They sat beside each other on the jet, much different than their first flight together.
Draco hummed. “Okay, good talk…. And for the record, you’re right, you really ought have known I were gay- I’ve never been particularly subtle about it.” He looked Nott up and down with one of his patented sneers that always made Harry’s heart flutter and whoever it was directed at cower back slightly, and turned away, walking into the great hall with Harry’s arm still firmly around him.
When Harry woke up that morning, Hermione was gone and he was halfway laid across Ron, who was still snoring. He remembered what had happened the night before and felt himself flush, his head dropping in shame. He'd been doing so well hiding the weird episodes he'd been having for the past month, but one stupid nightmare and both his friends had found out.
“No. There’s only Aunt Marge left, and she’d be more likely to set her dogs on me again than let me in to her house.”
“Yep. Now, I reckon these jeans should fit you, they’re a bit too long on me but I think we’re about the same size waist-wise, and I’ve got a few t-shirts that’re oversized on me that should work. So, Weird Sisters, The Mountain Goats or this one?” She held up a black t-shirt with “Mom come pick me up I’m scared” printed across the chest.
“Hiya, Lu.” She leaned down to where he was sat and wrapped her arms around him, her metal bangles tinkling.
“Harry! Come here.” She held her arms out wide and he immediately stepped into her embrace, balancing Teddy on one hip.
The person behind the counter grinned sunnily. "Absolutely! Just pass them here and you can get them when you're done!"
Ron was staring at Draco almost as if he didn't know him. "Don't hurt him." The statement was simple, but the threat was evident. Draco nodded solemnly, showing he understood, and recieved a nod in return.
“Oh, yes! I can see that! You’d look lovely in some nice clothes like hers.” Draco beamed, and Andromeda felt her chest swell- honestly, how Lucius could ever turn someone as sweet as this boy away, she’d never know.
"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. So, what does that mean for him? Does he need to take a potion or…?"
birthday, when his Hogwarts letter had arrived and he’d ran across the manor to show his father, flapping his hands excitedly, and shouted “Letter!”. He’d then spent the next few months until he’d started at Hogwarts in intensive speech therapy), and sometimes on his Bad days he found his voice abandoning him again.
Nym’s eyes went a bit wide. “Badass, kid! I’ll help you dye your hair when we get home, if you want, and my friend Al’s a piercer in town, so we can totally do that.”
The room wasn’t particularly large, but it wasn’t as small as Draco had feared. There were two double beds and nightstands with curtains around them, two wardrobes and then a rug and a window seat in the middle of the room. Everything was in neutral tones, which wasn’t Draco’s preference but he supposed it was to avoid house colours. He immediately headed over to his bed and stripped off the covers, folding them and placing them on the bottom of his wardrobe, and then replacing them with the silk set he’d fetched from his own bed. He felt Harry staring at him and turned to him.
He turned quickly, and was somewhat surprised when she pulled him into a tight hug. “I’m so proud of you, darling. I’ll message you your Aunt Andromeda’s phone number, and you should call her. She’ll take you in, okay, love?” Draco nodded, his eyes suspiciously damp. “Her child has a girlfriend, so she’ll support you, okay? And if you need any money, just let me know and I’ll try to get it past your father. I love you so much.” She pressed a quick kiss to his sharp cheekbone and stepped back, nodding at him as he grabbed his amp and moved towards the door.
He set a charm to go off when Granger reached her office and sunk into one of his many tomes, an old, almost disintegrating book as wide as the length of his forearm, his golden framed reading glasses perched precariously on the tip of his pointed nose.
"Of course! That's no problem, just bring me anything he wants and I'll leave them behind the counter and you can pay at the end."
“Mr Greenfeld, that is enough. Henrietta Potter’s behaviour has always been poor, and you ought not try to defend her or you may find yourself out of a job.”
Remus looked over at Harry and made eye contact, his mouth tugging into a wry grin. “You know he’s Sirius’ cousin?” Harry shook his head. “Yup, on his mother’s side. Now, come on in.”
“I do support him!” Ron’s ears went red. “I Just reckon he’s got bad taste.” At that Harry burst out laughing, Hermione and Ron joining him soon after.
“Good lord! What on earth has happened here?!” Her voice was high pitched and panicked at the amount of blood all over Aaron.
"No, sweetheart, no, it's not bad. You're not bad at all, it's okay. Alright, come here." She pulled him up off of the bed, wrapping her arms around him and motioning with her head for Ron to move over against the wall. She was only an inch taller than Harry, so he didn't seem quite as small as he had against Ron's lanky frame. She waved her wand and pulled up the blankets until they were hovering a few feet above the mattress and gently guided Harry back into bed. "Okay, Harry, come on, lay back down."
“Yeah. I’m just tired.” Draco tore his eyes away from Harry’s broad chest and the silvery and pink scars all over it. Harry hummed softly in response.
The pyjama section was wonderful, particularly because since his current pyjamas had been being worn since second year. He picked out fluffy bottoms, big, soft t-shirts, fleecey jumpers, a dressing gown and even a couple of onesies- one was a pastel pink dragon, and the other was a blue dinosaur, so he wasn't sure how he could possibly be expected to pass them up. He took everything back down to the counter and left them with the employee again, before heading up to the third floor.
“Mr Potter, our new… transfer.” He sneered. “Were I to ask you for the atom economy of a reaction, what information would I be looking for?”
Harry nodded vehemently. "I did it as soon as I got home, and then the day after I went to this store that sells lots of stuff for littles, and I got new clothes there, do you like them?" He babbled excitedly, sticking out his leg to show off his yellow jeans and his white converse shoes.
Once he was again dressed, although this time in soft leggings he often wore around his flat because they didn’t feel stiff or itchy like trousers, and his pink cosy socks, he padded down to room 2B. He knocked on the door in his usual repetitive pattern and heard Pansy’s muffled voice inside saying “It’s just Draco, hang on.” The door swung open to reveal Pansy, her face cleaned of her usual makeup, and Hermione sitting looking at Pansy’s phone. “What do you want, Drakiepoo?”
“I will need to inform Headmistress McGonagall, and I would recommend letting your friends know as well, although I cannot force you to do so. I will also, with your permission, inform Professor Flitwick, who is trained in supporting students with neurodivergencies and mental health issues.”
“I want to, but I don’t know how that would work out with Teddy and everything.” Harry dropped his head back against the sofa as Draco burped Teddy.
"But…. 'Mione…." Harry's voice was practically a whine and his eyes were glued to Draco, but just then the blond turned to open the shop door and Harry panicked. "Oh fuck, guys, we need to, we need to, he can't see, fuck…" he started mumbling, pulling them towards the shop and they both huffed out a laugh at him before following him off of the street and into the store before Draco could notice them.
“I- thank you. I’m sorry to bother you with this, but is there any chance you have an extra shirt or something? I need to take off my binder but I can’t in this one.” He looked down at his feet- it was almost unfortunate that he had picked that day to wear his only fitting shirt.
Avery was just about to release a litany of near-fatal curses onto Draco when a dark voice came from behind him, “
“Detention. Never speak to me like that. Tomorrow evening you will be spending an hour scrubbing beakers.”
"For- for- you shouldn't have had to deal with me when I was like that! I know you didn't sign up for this shit, so I'm just sorry." Harry wished his bed could open up and swallow him so he didn't have to keep looking at Draco's gentle expression. He settled for clamping his eyes shut.
“I’m proud of you! You’ve far less Nargles around you, now that your father is out of the picture. It’s a shame the Slashkilters got to him.” He hugged her back softly and hummed his agreement.
I was somewhat surprised by how clearly Draco’s voice came through the silence. “They’re muggle ear defenders, but I added a series of charms that let me add specific people’s magical signatures by having them touch their wand to them so their voices can still be heard. Pansy got annoyed with having to write notes to me when I had them on, so it was her idea. The charm resets itself every time they’re taken off.”
He froze as he heard footsteps coming towards him, and looked up just in time to see Harry Potter step through the doorway across from him. Harry’s hair was messier than ever, flopping down into his vibrant green eyes- eyes which widened as they landed on Draco. He knew he must look a mess, his hair waving all over the place, his hand bloodied and his eyes red-rimmed and almost wild.
Piers and his friends all backed off, looking innocently at the toad-like pink monstrosity that was their headmistress.
“Is that a mobile phone?” Harry waved his hand to finish putting his clothes (and he seemed to have finally replaced the old rags he wore with mostly fitting clothing, although it was still all simple items like blue jeans, t-shirts, sweaters and soft plaids) away and stared at the item in Draco’s hand.
“Do you know if it’s safe to floo with a baby?” Harry wanted to scratch the back of his neck but his arms were full of Teddy.
"I think he had a nightmare about being back at the Dursley's, and now he's acting like a little kid or something. I don't really know what's going on." Ron told her softly. Harry was looking between them, his bright green eyes wide.
It bleww awaayy.” Harry’s heart almost stopped as he walked into a small clearing about twenty-five meters into the forest to see Draco Malfoy, the boy he’d had feelings for since at least sixth year, leaning over a muggle acoustic guitar, his long, slender fingers plucking at the strings. “Blew away.
"I- well…. You… you know you told me to think about the whole caregiver thing?" Laura didn't express any surprise at the abrupt change in topic, but just nodded her head. "Well, I think- I think I'd like that? But not with someone who wasn't also my boyfriend or girlfriend. But because I've been in love with Draco for years even though I tried not to be, that basically means I want Draco to be my d- my caregiver, but he'd probably punch me if he ever found out!" Harry tangled his hands into his hair and pulled slightly.
Draco almost leapt from his bed, usually pristine hair in disarray and his eyes wild. He threw himself uncharacteristically gracelessly into his desk chair and immediately began scrawling messy notes across his parchment. He’d discounted time turners almost a year ago, but he thought he might be on the verge of a breakthrough with his new idea.
The smoking area was essentially just a circle of metal benches under an enclosure to keep the rain away, but Harry rather liked it. It was early enough that no one else was out there, and he enjoyed an hour just sitting, smoking and relaxing before breakfast. All too soon, though, it was 07:45 and he needed to head inside for breakfast. Standing up he groaned, his back popping as he stretched, before making his way to the massive wooden doors at the front of the castle. He still wasn’t over the fact that
Harry looked up into Draco's face. "I- I love you too. For years." He still felt stunned, even more so when Draco's face broke out into an uncharacteristic grin and his lips descended onto his in a gentle, tentative kiss.
I looked over at Hermione and saw that she looked incredibly confused, while Ron just looked vaguely sick. I took off the ear defenders and asked “What’s up?”.
“Correct on all counts, Potter. It seems as though you may not be as big a dunderhead as you look. Now-”
“Aaron’s been harassing me for weeks, sir. Every time he sees me he tries to feel me up, and he’s a lot bigger than I am so I can’t really do much, then today he tried to bend me over and pulled my pants down, so I had to do something to get him off me!” Harry practically exploded.
“Erm, I was just coming by to see ‘Mione.” Potter scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, which made his shirt rise in a way Draco tried very hard not to notice.
“PADFOOT!!!!” Nym practically leapt at Sirius. “I’m so glad you agreed! Man, you’re gonna love this song!”
"He will! 'N now you've seen me crying 'n you're gonna think I'm a freak too!" Harry's lower lip wobbled.
He was already in the alley where he apparated too and from his therapy sessions when he realized he’d been too busy thinking to call Pansy. He swore and hit call.
"Thanks, 'Mione." Harry smiled. "Laura recommended I choose some of my own clothes to sort of cut the tie between me and the Dursley's." It wasn't a lie- she had said as much multiple times in the past few months, he just hadn't bothered until now.
"Well, none of my friends have returned this year, and Luna… is with her friends." Draco shrugged awkwardly.
“Officer Riddle, and my partner, Officer Lestrange. What seems to be the issue?” The man’s voice was dry.
Draco looked at him incredulously. “Potter, you could ask her if you could have an alligator in the school and she’d sort it. You’re
to date a member of the Black family.” Remus joked, prodding Harry with his elbow that evening when he went to get his testosterone shot.
His breath was short and his eyes started watering, and before Hermione and Ron could even notice he had turned and fled. He found his way to Myrtle's bathroom and dropped down onto the floor in the corner, pulling his knees to his chest and sobbing brokenly. His thumb made its way into his mouth as he cried for the loss of his parents, of Sirius, of Remus and Tonks, and of everyone else who shouldn't have had to die but did.
“Yeah, pretty much. Dramatic bastard.” His voice was fond, and Harry couldn’t quite suppress the snicker at the pout on Sirius’ face. “So, Harry, the three of us will be living in my home in Hogsmeade, and you’re free to decorate your room however you want, and we’ll take you shopping tomorrow morning. You’ll be starting at Hogwarts Academy in a couple of weeks once half-term’s over, which is a private boarding school, but you’ll have your own room there too, in my suite, and will be able to come home with me on weekends if you like, seeing as I’ll be driving home each weekend to stay with Sirius.” Harry nodded, a little wide eyed at the idea of
One of their roommates, a muggle-raised half-blood called Alaistor, reached out to touch Freak’s wand. “Your wand is so interesting, what wood is that?”
“Here.” He passed Harry a pair of boxers and a big, super soft grey knitted sweater that he didn’t recognize. “Shout me when you’re dressed.” He added as he made his way back out of the room, giving Harry a full look at his arse as he walked. He felt his mouth go dry watching.
Harry didn’t even think before stepping through, his feet bare and his mug of tea still in one hand. “Thank you for contacting me, Auror….”
Draco, however, burst out laughing. The sound was rich and melodious and Harry vaguely wondered if it was possible to live in someone’s laugh. The blond’s face lit up, his silvery eyes dancing.
“Yeah, mate. My dad and his dad actually got in a fist fight in the bookstore once. Absolute arsehole, is Mr Malfoy.” Ron laughed.
“Er, yeah, you don’t have to leave on my account, Malfoy. Actually, you know what? I’m just- I’m just going to go, yeah?” he nodded, apparently to himself before looking back at Granger. “I’ll see you later, ‘Mione.” Potter’s eyes were pointedly averted from Draco, but Draco would have sworn that just before he left, he saw them land on him and Potter’s cheeks pink up, although he couldn’t for the life of him understand why.
“Absolutely they are. The Head is actually a friend of mine, and I can assure you that they are very much used to dealing with problem cases such as young Mr Potter. Now, if you want to take Mr Potter home to collect his things and say goodbye and then meet me at St Brutus’ in, say, two hours, we can get everything signed off on and sorted.”
“Doesn’t bother me, if you want me to I could probably get all three of them in the hospital wing within, like, 10 minutes.”
“I accept.” A drawling voice came from behind him, and he turned quickly to see Draco standing against the wall. His eyes grew wide. “Meet me tomorrow at 09:45 outside Professor Snape’s quarters and we can spend the day in Hogsmeade. You may kiss me, if you like.” Draco’s cheeks were pink and he was fiddling with the hems of his sweater sleeves.
Masked by the rustle of text books, Ron leaned over to him. “Bloody hell, mate, I didn’t know you were a genius!”
“The day Lucius sodding Malfoy is supportive of anything I do, let alone any queer person, is the day I’ll… I don’t know, fancy a bird.” Draco’s bloodshot eyes were watering as he laughed.
"Excellent. Well, unless you have any questions...?" Harry shook his head. "Then I will see you next week."
"Does it feel weird to you? When you've found yourself regressing before, has it felt wrong or strange?"
“Girl! Are you still doing that? I thought we told you to stop lying!” The obscenely fat man bellowed, his moustache trembling.
“Yeah. I guess he’s your… cousin? Of some kind? He’s my godson. Or son, I suppose, since I adopted him.”
Harry's new clothes had been a huge change from how he used to dress, but the pastel colours suited him well, and Draco was somewhat glad to see that he'd brought them into his dorm as well, although some of the decor was a little more… childish than he had expected. His desk was littered with Muggle crayons and colouring books and children's storybooks, and there was a white dragon plush toy on his bed.
Harry was wandering around the black lake when he heard something coming from the forbidden forest; it wasn’t the usual creature noises or even the centaurs, but, oddly enough, distant guitar music. Someone was in the forbidden forest playing a song he vaguely recognised as muggle on an acoustic guitar. He stopped, puzzled, and whoever was playing started singing.
This opinion changed, however, when he walked into the classroom to see Draco Malfoy sitting in the corner, chatting lowly to a girl with frizzy, dirty-blonde hair and radishes hanging from her earrings. He flopped down on the chair across from the two of them and cast a glance around the room. Most of the students in there he didn’t recognize, although he did see one of the boys who had tried to fight him, McClaggen, and one of the boys he vaguely recognised as a fellow Gryffindor, Neville.
“Harry, don’t worry about it. I was going to hand in my notice soon, anyway, because I’ve gotten a job over at a boarding school in Scotland for next year, and I’ve got the savings to be alright for the next seven months until then. All my things are already packed up in my office. Will you be alright if I just go get them?” They asked, worried about leaving Harry to the mercy of Um-bitch, as they called her.
Harry looked back down at the sweater in his hands and smiled hesitantly before quickly making his way to the bathroom Officer Shacklebolt had shown him to earlier.
"Oh- Potter." Draco Malfoy stood in the doorway, and Harry felt his jaw drop. Draco was wearing black drainpipe jeans, Doc martens and a cut up black tank top, and his arms were covered with heavy, colourful tattoos. "I'm really sorry, but would you mind if I sat in here?" Draco shifted uncomfortably.
Harry didn’t even have a chance to reply before Ron cut in. “Actually, I’m perfectly fine with Harry being my roommate. Maybe you should look into not being a prick, eh, mate?”
Once he was done, he leaned back and admired his masterpiece- she was certainly prettier in death than she had been in life. Nodding to himself, he headed back to his cupboard to wait for Dudley to get home. Dudley was the same age as Harry, but he had been going to the primary school around the corner for nearly two years now, whereas Harry spent his days cleaning the house or locked in his cupboard.
“Potter, can I talk to you?” Draco’s hands were shoved in the pockets of his robe to hide the shaking.
The castle was definitely nicer at this time in the morning. The sun was only just rising, and it cast colours on the stone walls. The door outside was large and ornate, but that also meant it was heavy as fuck. The smoking area Remus had told him about was just outside there, and apparently its where students had been hiding to smoke since him and Sirius were at school there. Harry could see that there was someone already there, but he just decided he’d ignore them. He flopped down onto the old brick wall of what clearly used to be an outhouse, on the other side to the other person. He took out a cigarette from his pack only to realize he’d forgotten his lighter.
Draco had his gun cocked right back, but Harry could see the hesitation on his face. Draco hated having to kill people, he always said it made him feel too much like his father.
Inside the reception, Officers Riddle and Lestrange were stood talking with a stern-faced man who Harry guessed was the Head.
Once Harry had finished with the shoes (and Ron had grabbed himself a pair of bright red converse to replace his old sneakers, which he could afford from helping Fred and George out at Wheezes), he made his way over to the other side of the floor, which was full of things like dummies, bottles and sippy cups.
"Ah yes, of course, Mr Abide-by-my-laws-unless-you're-Harry will fix it." Draco teased, pressing a kiss to the side of Harry's neck.
Harry was stunned by this- Draco was unable to look him in the face after his little rant, but Nym certainly wasn’t, and given how easy Harry was to read, it was clear to see that he was crushing hard on her cousin, and they couldn’t help but start to plot a few different ways to try and get two of their favourite boys together….
It had a double bed, cream walls, a desk, a wardrobe, a set of drawers and an en suite bathroom. He was so stunned, standing in the doorway, that he didn’t even notice Sirius coming up behind him.
As he entered the kitchen, it was spotless as it had been before he decided to distract himself with baking earlier. He felt bad for leaving Harry to clean up, but he couldn’t stay there. He had to get out.
“So for example, if one naturally experiences exhaustion after sex, then as their libido increases, they may experience tiredness more often. If being in pain angers someone, then they will experience anger more often, just because that’s how they react to it. Do you understand?”
As Hermione rushed over, she instantly checked the blond for his vitals. He was breathing but unconscious, and his nose was covered in dried blood.
Draco stared at their hands again, and as if Harry got the clue, his hand slipped away first and started to turn away. "Good night Draco." He said over his shoulder.
After lubing up and fingering Harry to ensure he was stretched enough, Draco pushed forward and slowly entered his husband.
"Yes, sir." Draco replied quietly with a tight nod. His expression was back to his calm 'n cool Malfoy mask, although less pointy than Harry remembered.
“You are a wicked, wicked woman. Fine, something did happen. And yes, it was intimate. And yes, he did treat me really fucking well. And yes, I may be totally, irreversibly in love with him. But that gives you no right to spread my life through your spiderwebs of lies that cling to the Ministry’s black walls, Parkinson.”
“Oh, I’M aware, but it seems you’ve forgotten.” She smirks at him. “I’m sure he’d love to relive the experience you two had, because I KNOW something happened between you two, by listening through my gossip.”
Not feeling Harry let up, Draco sighed, and turned his gaze to the side so he wasn’t forced to look at Harry when he spoke.
Although they were a twisted mix of emotional chemistry, Draco was hurting desperately and he was still Harry’s husband. Harry couldn’t help himself. He kneeled down beside Draco, pulled his hands from his eyes, and before Draco could do anything, he kissed him. A full on the mouth, hard and desperate kiss. Harry wound an arm around Draco to steady him, and continued to kiss him with all his might.
Harry pushed his magic out to open the door for him and padded out back towards Andrews’ office. Once he got there, he smiled at the auror politely and threw some floo powder into the fire, calling out “Tonks Residence!” and stepping into the green flames.
“Harry. Its good that you’re here.” Kingsley’s deep voice cut through the fog in his head, as calming as the first time they had met.
“Fab. That’ll look right handsome on you. Okay, Sirius first then Harry.” She turned and headed into the little piercing room, Sirius following.
Once in his room, Harry finally let Draco put him down and ran to change into pyjamas. Before he went into his bathroom he turned and looked up at Draco, his big eyes pleading. "C"n you stay? Pwease?"
A series of cleansing spells to his clothes and the bathroom and he was left with one last piece of clean-up. Twirling his wand between his fingers, he stalked over to Myrtle’s stall where she was cowering against the wall. A sick smile on his face, he started casting.
He rocked back and forth lightly, chewing on the skin and breathing heavily as he blinked tears out of his eyes. The combination of the horrible day he’d had and that girl trying to force herself on him was just too much. He wished he had his weighted blanket with him, because he knew the pressure would sooth him, but it hadn’t occurred to him to grab it before leaving his dorm. He was glad he was at least wearing his comfort clothes. He bit down on his hand extra hard and felt the points of his teeth rip into the skin and pulled his hand out of his mouth with a dry sob, gagging as the taste of blood hit his lips. He slapped both palms into his head, one on either side and applied pressure. He had been trying to stop hitting his head so much, but sometimes he couldn’t help it.
“Harry?” The shorter man was staring at him as if he couldn’t believe his eyes. Harry nodded awkwardly. “Christ, you look just like your dad.”
“Mngh. M’rn’g.” Draco mumbled, pouring hot water into an odd contraption he seemed to have found somewhere. Harry assumed it was some way to make coffee, but he’d never had to make any at the Dursley’s and he wasn’t a huge fan of it himself, so he wasn’t sure.
“What? He wasn’t the one who attacked them! They attacked him, just like they always do!” They said, outraged.
Harry turned back to Luna, only to find that she had apparently disappeared. Pulling himself together, he nodded to Draco. “Alright, tomorrow then.” He took a few steps closer to Draco and put one square hand to the side of his pointed jaw. Guiding his face up, he leaned in and pressed their lips together softly.
“Yes, Aunt Petunia.” Harry murmured obediently and began pulling out the ingredients for pancakes. He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard his Aunt’s shoes clack out of the kitchen and towards the stairs, likely to rouse Dudley, and surreptitiously opened the junk drawer by the sink and snuck out his Uncle Vernon’s old pocket knife. The blade had started to rust, so he was sure no one would miss it, but it was good enough for him. He quickly pocketed the knife and turned back to his task, frying up as many pancakes as he could before his relatives came in.
“I would never lie to you, Draco. Anyone else, sure. But not you. Never you. You’re safe.” Harry’s warm arms wrapped around him, firm and reassuring.
“Is this- is this what you’ve been working on?” Potter’s eyes were on him, so intense it made him squirm.
“Good morning, Harry.” Draco’s cheeks were once again stained pink. “We thought we might eat breakfast with you today, if you’d like.”
“Well, then, Ronald, you can help me with my research.” Ron groaned and followed her out of the room, shutting the door behind him.
“You’re braver than me. If Lucius was my da’, I’d probably be in the closet ‘till I finished uni, at least.”
“I, uh, heard you playing, so I wanted to come see who it was.” Harry grinned sheepishly and ran one square, brown hand through his already messy hair.
“Uh, I didn’t really get much food as a kid. ‘S why I’m so short. I basically lived on stale bread and sweet tea ‘till Hogwarts, then during summer too.” Harry shrugged, tucking into his dinner. He did love shepherd’s pie.
He practically jumped out of bed, excitedly getting dressed and checking the store location on his laptop before apparating to an alleyway further down the street.
In the 6 months Harry had been on testosterone, his period had stopped entirely, something he was incredibly thankful for, his voice had lowered, not much but enough to be noticeable, his body had generally begun to look more masculine, which in turn made him feel far more confident, and he had even started to grow a bit of wispy facial hair. He was hoping that the facial hair would start to thicken soon- he was sure he would look fantastic with a full beard.
"Okay, darling. Do you have a caregiver?" He asked with as much delicacy as he was capable of, which was far more than people tended to think.
"I'm in love with you too." He whispered against his ear, trailing kisses down his cheekbone and back towards his mouth.
“Harry Potter? It’s Officer McKinnon.” Officer McKinnon was a kind, pretty woman with blonde hair and a no-nonsense attitude. Harry liked her very much.
“Sure do. Now, lets go get you some clothes of your own. Do you just want clothes, or have you got anything else in mind?”
It was Halloween when things got to be too much for Harry. He'd been doing so well, keeping it together, rarely having panic attacks now he felt comfortable regressing in his room, and honestly barely even thinking about the bodies he'd seen lined up in the great hall less than a year before, but when he entered for the feast on Halloween evening, it felt like all he could see. He couldn't see the tables, the food, the decorations, it was just grey and death and his heart pounded in his chest.
Harry interrupted him, “What, the same godfather who killed my parents? What the fuck?!” He turned to Leo, who was standing against the wall and smirking at his outburst.
Eventually their kisses shifted from hungry and lustful to sweet and tender, and then to light and sleepy, and that is how they fell asleep, Draco laid out on top of Harry, one of Harry’s hands resting on his lower back and the other on the back of his upper thigh, their lips still touching lightly.
“You say that, but I know you, Pans, you’d’ve probably told him in an argument, just like you did your mum.” He rolled his eyes again. He remembered the day Pansy had come out to her mum; they were 15 and Violet Parkinson had been convinced that him and Pansy were secretly shagging and kept trying to catch them at it since they always locked her bedroom door when they were hanging out, and once Pansy had figured out what she was doing, they’d gotten into a screaming match where Pansy had yelled that she was “a raging bloody lesbian” and admitting that she’d been sleeping with Millicent Bullstrode since the end of year 9. Draco had spent the entire argument trying to blend into the wall and not burst out laughing at the expression on Mrs Parkinson’s face.
Instead of shaking the proffered hand, Freak grasped it and brought it to his lips, pressing a soft kiss to the back. “Freak Addams, the pleasure is mine, amado mío.” The blond’s cheeks pinkened and Freak smirked.
“Glad to hear it.” Draco took a step closer to Harry, quite a feat given their proximity, and Harry could feel the heat of his body through their robes. He didn’t even have to think about it before tilting his head up and pressing their lips together.
He barely had time to get his bearings before he was bent over, Aaron’s hands forcing his too-loose grey trousers down around his ankles and a lecherous voice breathing hotly into his ear, “Be a good boy and stay still.”
!” Draco snapped his fingers and a spark of magic cracked through the air. “Maybe I helped you realize it, but you are exactly the same person you’ve always been, Harry!”
Harry remained silent and slid Vernon’s plate over to him, piled just as high as Dudley’s had been. Avoiding eye contact, as he knew that would be the fastest way to another violent lashing, he turned back to the stove and began moving the dirty dishes to the sink and wiping up the mess on the countertops with a rag, trying to ignore the angry grumbling of his stomach- it had already been three days since he had last been permitted food. By the time the dishes were clean and put away, his relatives’ plates were all empty. He took them and cleaned them too, putting them away as Vernon stood and clasped Dudley’s shoulder.
“I was thinking, we should probably go shopping today, you know, get any stuff we need for us, Teddy and the house.” Harry was suddenly struck by how domestic this was and felt his heart ache.
By the time he got back to his dorm, he felt so intensely drained that he almost immediately curled up on his bed, only kicking off his slippers and dropping the silencing charm, delighting in the loss of the odd buzzing magic sound and the silence of the wards he’d put around the room, before he wrapped his weighted blanket around his shoulders and rocked back and forth. He stuffed his hands into the pocket of his hoodie, trying to stop himself from smacking his head or biting them, and summoned over his chew necklace from his drawer. His face was damp with tears and his chest felt tight. The door opened again and he screwed up his eyes.
“My pleasure.” Draco’s cheeks pinkened at how true that statement was. He couldn’t think of anything he’d rather have spent the day doing than running his fingers through Harry’s soft hair… well, almost anything, anyway.
Diagon Alley was packed. They could barely take a step before being mobbed- press taking photographs of Harry, people talking over one another and shoving to try to get to him, groups of total strangers trying to harass or attack Draco- it was a nightmare. Harry turned to Draco and under his breath asked, “Gringotts then muggle London?” The relief on Draco’s face was evident as he nodded. Harry pushed his magic out and forced a pathway to the bank between the crowd, making his way there hurriedly. Draco was sticking so close that Harry could feel his warmth against his back, even if they weren’t touching.
Harry and Draco’s relationship went public very quickly after Draco had sat with Harry for breakfast and then again at lunch. Neither of them were interested in hiding it, nor were they inclined to deny it, so by dinner time everyone in the castle was aware that Harry Lupin and Draco Malfoy were a couple. This, however, meant that Remus also knew before they had even been together for a whole 24 hours.
"Y-yeah, he is. When we first got together, he spent about a week doing research on littles and how to be a good caregiver before officially agreeing to be my caregiver." Harry smiled. "He knows me really well, though, so he's taken to it better than I could have ever expected."
He was pulled from his thoughts when he felt Harry seemingly try to burrow into his chest, mumbling sleepily.
“He found out about a year ago that I’m gay, but during the war drawing attention to that fact would have reflected poorly on him to the Dark Lord, and so he was unable to disown me until now. And yes, I am unable to return home.”
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled to himself. “Why don’t you sit with me in class from now on and if you need me to do anything just let me know?”
Harry put the kettle on and made himself another cup of tea before settling in to the sofa with one of the baby books. It was rather informative, and before he knew it, it was almost 10 PM and he was over half way through. He was considering making himself another cuppa when there was a knock at the door. He frowned, confused as to who on earth would be knocking at his door so late, particularly when the only people who knew he was living there were the Weasleys, Hermione and Kingsley.
Kingsley let out a low chuckle. “Of course, Harry. Ordinarily there would be more to work through, but in this case I’m sure I’ll be able to make an exception.” Harry wanted to butt in that just because he was now ‘the saviour’ shouldn’t mean he didn’t have to follow protocol, but in this case he was willing to ignore it as long as it meant he could take Teddy home with him as soon as possible. “So, I’ll just need you to sign some paperwork stating that as his godfather you are willing to become his legal guardian and adopt him, and then we’ll discuss Andromeda’s will.”
After dinner, Molly dug out as many baby books as she could find and sent him off home with a shrunken stack of them and a fresh treacle tart.
Before they even got home, Teddy was half asleep on Harry’s chest, one little thumb in his mouth, and so by the time Harry laid him down in his cot and set up the monitor charm Molly had taught him, the little boy was already asleep.
No one had expected him to walk into first period Physics with Professor McGonagall, his arm around Harry Potter’s shoulders. No one had anticipated Harry leaning up to press a kiss to his cheek before heading for his seat at the back with Ron and Hermione. Certainly no one had expected Draco Malfoy to look happier than he had since first year. He smiled to himself as he sat down beside Padma Patil.
Harry nodded then gestured to the bathroom. "There are towels in the linen cupboard to the left." He smiled before starting back down, but he quickly stopped himself and turned back. "You need clothes, don't you?" He asked.
He stops and glares at her. She doesn’t seem fazed as she continues “He experienced a magical rupture through his core, unbeknownst to us. As a result, his body physically couldn’t handle that amount of stress, so it locked down and he suffered a seizure due to it. Is there any possible explanation you know of that he could’ve done to have caused this?”
Harry had barely stuck his nose against Draco’s skin before he was GROWLing against the pale skin, and rutting roughly against Draco’s thigh.
“Or... we can stay here all day.” Malfoy offered, following him much like a predator hunting his prey.
“I’m alright. I know what’s wrong. It’s just a bit of morning sickness.” she responded breathlessly.
"Oh gosh, you scared me." Draco said, clutching his chest above his heart, willing his breathing to slow.
“Mr Malfoy, please.” He drawled. “Your behaviour, while inhibited, is seriously improper. Were your father to see you now…” He trailed off, looking at the blond with a mild look of disapproval.
“Holy fuck, Dray. You are fucking gorgeous.” Harry said, spreading Draco open and promptly licking from his tip to his tailbone.
Because then Draco came out with just a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair dripping wet and skin shining with dew.
“I didn't expect you to… This is a lot. Thank you, for this.” Harry smiled, staring at the Omega as he ran his fingers over his old wand, getting a feel for its magic once again. “Can I ask you for a favour?” Harry nodded for him to continue. “Well, um, I thought that we could maybe go shopping today. So I can get some clothes since I don’t have any, and I don’t want to keep taking yours from you.” Draco bit his lip and started playing with the hem of his shirt, and Harry realized that he hadn't given him anymore clothes to wear. All he had was the pyjamas he was currently wearing.
Potter stood there, head down in a shameful manner. “I know I acted inappropriately last week. I came to apologize for what I did. I’d had a few drinks prior to meeting you, and I got carried away-”
Harry had just stepped out of the shower and was towelling his hair when he heard Draco on the other side knocking on the door.
His boyfriend of four years, Harry Potter, turned over and gasped at the sight before him. “Merlin, Draco, are you alright? You're sweating!”
Harry was responding to a letter that Kingsley had owled him when he heard a noise come from downstairs. Normally he would’ve brushed it off as Kreacher before he realized that it wasn’t just the two of them anymore. He quickly scribbled the rest of his response and sent it off with the ministry’s owl that had been waiting patiently. He quickly grabbed his wand and made his way down the stairs when he discovered the sounds were coming from the kitchen. He pocketed his wand before pushing the door open. The sight that greeted him was shocking.
Harry didn’t speak or move, just stared deeply into Draco’s eyes. A few minutes passed, silence wrapped around them before Harry said “I did it.”
"Are you sure mate? It's not just your hypersensitive Alpha genes playing with you?" Ron asked with a slight smirk.
He then grabbed his clothes and went down to the basement to wash them… only he had no idea how to work the damn machine. He could ask the house-elf, but he tried to avoid him as much as possible. He was an unfriendly little fellow and Draco felt extremely uncomfortable under his gaze. He settled for throwing them in a basket off to the side, and made his way back up to the main floor. He really didn’t feel like locking himself up in the library again, so he decided to go outside for some fresh air.
Ron and Hermione eyed the two in shock at the complete control Harry had over the blond. Albeit forcefully and threateningly, he still managed to make him shut up.
Draco stayed silent for a moment before quietly replying “I would like that too. But, before, were you implying that I'm your mate? Or might be?”
“Well, I don’t know their last names, but there are five of them." Draco started, giving in to his Alpha. "Jonathan, a big burly kind of guy. He must be in his late forties. He helped me get situated this morning. There’s Philip, I didn’t get a good look at him but he works beside Jonathon. There’s Ethan, I work across from him. He’s tall and scrawny, glasses type. He's young, must be around our age. Daniella, or Danny, is the only woman. I work beside her. She’s also tall, medium build, long brown hair, and also young, maybe mid twenties. And there’s um, Mason I think. He’s tall too, fit and kind of lumberjack-like. Very...thick. I can't tell how old he is; could be late twenties or late thirties.” Draco explained with furrowed brows. He shakes his head after a moment. “All complete nutters if you ask me. No one talks. Anyways, I have to go. I’ll meet you up here when I’m done, though.”
“Finnegan, you utter plebeian. I am thoroughly disgusted by your childish antics you clearly haven’t grown out of since our time at Hogwarts. I am ashamed to say that I had the displeasure of knowing your immature arse. Never pull a stunt like that again on Potter, or YOU will be on the receiving end of MY wand. This is Draco Malfoy, by the way. Get checked, you Irish clown.”
Harry ignored his question, looked down and ran a hand through his hair in a calming manner. "There's something else..." Of course, being Harry's best friends, both Hermione and Ron knew about the wolf characteristics passed down through Harry's lineage. They were there when he manifested into an Alpha fourth year. Confusion etched its way into Hermione and Ron's faces. Harry looked up to see their expressions as he explained what he discovered. "Draco's an Omega."
Draco looks deeply at him, still stumped as to why he had this accident. Harry pulled him out of his revier. “Do you know when we’ll be able to head home? We haven’t spent a night at home yet.”
Once Harry was settled in the middle of the bed she climbed onto the edge, and after making sure all three of them were comfortable she lowered the blankets to tuck themselves around them.
Harry had barely even thought about it before his gun was out, a bullet travelling fast directly into the back of the man's head. Blood splattered across Draco's pointed face and he looked up, startled, and smiled upon catching sight of Harry.
He walked as fast as he could without running, but he knew he would still be late for school- he always was. In spite of that, his grades were still fairly high, and he was in top set for all of his classes.
“Don’t be silly, Ronald.” Harry raised a brow at her. “Its clear you’re not that dangerous. I’m sure you could be if you wanted, but you’re not. So, we’re going to be friends.” Her no nonsense, matter of fact tone was what got him and he cracked a grin.
It took all of Harry’s self-control not to burst out laughing at that. “I’m not, I just learned this at St Brutus’ last year.”
“Yes. Yes, Harry, of course we do. We wanted to adopt you when you were a baby, but the authorities wouldn’t let us.” Remus pulled Harry into a hug, but the movement made him suddenly very aware of the pain in his back and chest- he’d fallen asleep in his binder.
Harry smiled crookedly. “Okay, yeah, sounds good.” Once Draco left he started undressing, getting ready to shower. It was much easier when he could stand, but over the past few months he’d gotten fairly adept at getting clean whilst sitting. It was only once he’d gotten washed and wrapped himself in a big, fluffy towel that he realized he hadn’t gotten any pyjamas out. Normally he’d’ve just summoned something from his trunk, but his magic was always a bit dodgy after a migraine, and his spells either came out as absolutely nothing or with far too much power. He shuddered as he remembered just after the final battle when he’d tried to summon something from his trunk and had accidentally summoned the whole thing; that had definitely worsened the damage.
Whispers suddenly started circulating, and Harry felt hundreds of eyes on him. He pushed his half-full plate away and stood up, rolling his eyes as almost everyone in the hall watched him leave. He headed up towards his room, but was intercepted by professor Snape.
Draco smiled indulgently. "While you go change, I'm going to go and change into my pyjamas too, then, is that okay?"
“Really?” He rolled his eyes exasperatedly, but it was all in good fun- they were both well aware that he would end up going to school in the daft t-shirt (although, actually, not that he’d admit it, it was a pretty cool shirt. It was black with a shiny black print on the front, and Nym had used her seem ripper to remove the collar and un-hem the sleeves and bottom and fray it out a bit for him.)
Later that day, in their dorm, Ron sat across from Harry and stared at him as if he didn’t recognise him.
“Well, yes, I-” He was cut off by Potter’s lips pressing insistently to his and he gasped, melting against him.
“Brilliant! He’s the best teacher here by far.” He seemed to be about to say something else when the door was pushed open and a petite black girl bustled into their room, her timetable in her hand.
The person behind the counter looked rather out of place among the pastels and bright colours- they were tall and dressed in all black, with dyed black hair, but they gave him a cheery smile as he walked in. "Hi, if you need any help, just give me a shout, alright?" He nodded, still a little stunned by the array of clothes.
“Because I wanted to? I know I should have asked if you were okay with it first, but I didn’t think.”
Snape looked vaguely impressed. “Correct. So, then, Potter, lets see… In a theoretical experiment, 1.3 g of sodium chloride is made. The maximum theoretical mass of sodium chloride is 1.6 g. What is the percentage yield?”
Harry heard Draco rattling around, and at one point it sounded like his bedroom door was opened but he just ignored it. A few minutes passed and Draco again knocked on the bathroom door. “Can I come in?”
Harry’s new room at Sirius and Remus’ house in Hogsmeade was HUGE. Or, at least, it was to him, who had had a cupboard under the stairs for ten years and then a cramped, shared room for the following four.
“Thank Salazar for caffeine.” Draco’s voice was much clearer already. Harry laughed. “What?” Draco raised one pointed brow.
“That’s not very nice! I’m not an idiot!” Harry feigned offence, but then burst out into a fit of giggles, pulling Draco’s hands away from his face. Draco let him, and smiled against his mouth as he kissed him softly, standing in the hallway.
He’d only just sat down on the sofa when Draco came walking out of his bedroom, gently closing the door with a soft snick.
“Well then, Potter, go and pack your things. I’ll draw up the release paperwork. You’ll be able to leave in about 30 minutes.” Yaxley’s gruff startled him out of his shock, and nodding to each man in turn, he turned and headed back to his room.
"Most people see killing at all as immoral, love. Besides, I'd kill anyone for you, you know that, so they'll definitely think you're turning me to the 'dark side'." Harry laughed lightly, dropping his phone back onto the nightstand and wrapping his arms back around Draco's slender form.
“Alright, same as dad then. He doesn’t wear his docs anymore, if you want them? He wanted to give them to me but they’re a couple sizes too big.”
“No developments as of yet. I think what I really need is to experiment with the charms work for it, but Granger says I’m ‘not to do anything that could put my life at risk’,” He mocked, rolling his eyes, “Although I don’t understand how she expects me to make progress if I don’t experiment.”
"Yeah, right, I saw that. Sure, you can- you can sit in here. Ron and Hermione are still prefects, so…"
“No problem, kiddo, whatever you want.” Sirius kissed the side of Harry’s head and hugged him tight until he started to pull away.
July, Gryffindor House, Year 11, Transfer from St Brutus’, Dorm Assignment Gryffindor Tower room 4B, Roommate Ronald Bilius Weasley. Hogwarts does not have a uniform, however please avoid dressing inappropriately. Outfits like the one you are wearing currently are perfectly acceptable. No smoking in the dormitories, hallways, hall or classes, and violent behaviour will be punished with detention and possible suspension or expulsion.” Headmaster Dumbledore read off of his screen. “Your roommate Mr Weasley shares all of the same classes as you except for your Friday afternoon Special Ed class with Hagrid, when he has a free period, and as such he will be able to help you get accustomed to the castle. Here is a copy of your timetable, and I’m sure Remus will be happy to show you to your room, Mr Potter.” The old headmaster smiled at him, eyes twinkling. “I’m sure you’ll also be glad to know we have no rules about piercings here.” His smile almost turned into a smirk as he looked up at the little barbell through Harry’s eyebrow.
Neville pulled back. His eyes were wide and panicked. "Fuck, Harry, I'm sorry, I-" Harry bolted. He ran out of the room, tears streaming down his face, and blindly tried to make his way towards the eighth year tower. He thought he was about half way there when he slammed into another body.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded. “T-thank you, doctor.” He stood up and made his way over to the office door, twisting his fingers into the large stitches at the wrists of his sweatshirt. Once out of the office, he kept his head down, hair falling into his face as he walked through the waiting room as quickly as he could, pulling out his mobile phone. He wasn’t sure how he was going to cope without it when he returned to Hogwarts….
“Well, you’re keyed into the wards already.” He hung up the phone and spun in place, reappearing in his comfortable sitting room. His sofa was large and soft, and he had 3 blankets in different shades of green thrown over it, ready to burrow into. Which is exactly what he did- he removed his shoes and socks, sighing in relief as the seams that had been driving him mental all day were no longer touching his skin, and stepped out of his trousers, banishing them to the laundry basket and flopping down onto his sofa in just his oversized sweater and his boxers, curling up in his nest of soft blankets. He’d just gotten comfortable when there was a crack and Pansy appeared by his kitchen door. She didn’t even look at him before heading into his kitchen and he almost laughed when she reappeared with two wine glasses and a bottle of merlot.
Harry stalked back towards the dungeons, magic crackling dangerously around him, and the part of himself that wasn’t entirely lost to the sick pleasure thanked Merlin that most of the students were away.
He was about to reply when another voice came from behind the girl. “Maybe he should.” Harry hadn’t seen the boy before, because even as tall as he was, he was completely hidden behind her thick curls.
In the accessories, he picked out two different bags- one was very childish, with dinosaurs all over it and a dinosaur plush keychain attached, and the other was more wearable for everyday, a muted lilac with no designs, but the inside had lots of little pockets that he thought would be perfect for carrying things when he was back at Hogwarts. He also found a pack of 5 different pastel beanie hats, each with a different coloured tag on the front, and a plush my melody hat that felt incredibly soft.
“Ah, Mr Dursley, Mr Potter. Excellent timing. This is the Head here at St Brutus’, Corban Yaxley. All of the paperwork is ready, so if you, Mr Dursley, will just sign off on Mr Potter’s admission slip, here, and again to sign over guardianship, here, then you are free to leave.”
“Sorry.” He loosened his fingers from where they were digging into her arm and saw the slight red marks and crescent moon shaped indents his nails had left. “But why was that so fucking hot?” He asked.
"Harry- wait!" Ron called, heading after him while Hermione and the shop assistant shared commiserating glances.
The next morning, Draco and Pansy waited outside the great hall until Harry, Ron and Hermione showed up. Harry’s face broke into a big grin as he saw his boyfriend, and he pressed a kiss to his lips.
It didn’t take him long to pack up his things. The only clothes he had were still Dudley’s old cast-offs he was sent with, and as far as ‘personal items’ went, he only had his stash of cigarettes he’d been able to convince Leo to replace for him once a month. Within 10 minutes, he had everything thrown into a trash bag and was ready to head back to the office. When he swung open the door, he was greeted with the sight of Sirius still sobbing into Remus’ chest.
Just then, Slughorn called the classes attention back to him, and Harry and Draco both turned back to the front.
“Then you’ve got me.” Draco’s pale cheeks were flushed pink and he unthinkingly dropped his gaze down to Harry’s plush lips.
"Well, there's actually a shop on the outskirts of London that specifically caters to littles. They have clothing as well, although from what I could find out most of it is either bright colours or pastels." Hermione smiled.
Chemistry was definitely Draco’s favourite class, but mostly because his godfather didn’t care if he showed up stoned and spent the entire lesson with his head on his desk staring at the back of Harry bloody Potter’s head, especially since Severus had been tutoring him since he was six, and so he knew he already knew the entire curriculum (plus, if he were being honest, enough to get him through at least the first two years of a chemistry degree if he wanted to do that). Today, though, it seemed to drag on as he worried about what he was going to do that night. He was definitely glad he’d chosen a Friday to do this, so he at least would have the weekend to adjust to most likely being disowned without having to deal with school as well.
“I-I’ll see you tomorrow. Don’t be late.” Draco said and then grabbed his bag up from the floor, turning and striding back towards the castle. Harry smiled and shook his head.
That halted Draco in his tracks, and the ‘Malfoy Mask’ he’d put up dropped in favour of a nervous, vulnerable expression that made Harry want to pull him into a hug. “Y-you don’t?”
“Next time, amor.” Draco stood and strode over towards Freak’s bed, pressing a soft kiss to his lips as the dark-haired boy flicked his wrist and released the curse. He turned to Alaistor- “Never touch an Addams wand.”
“I’m surprised Granger never noticed anything, but it’s not something people really talk about in the Wizarding world. It’s not difficult to find out though. Come on.” Draco got to his feet and held out his left hand to help pull me up. I took it, feeling my face flushing at the feeling of his soft skin on mine and hoping that my dark skin covered it up.
. I looked up, right into the angular, handsome face of Draco Malfoy. Of fucking course, of all people to find me like this, it had to be him. We’d not been antagonizing one another this year, and so I wasn’t too worried about him taking the piss, but it was definitely embarrassing to have my crush-slash-ex-rival walk in on me like this. “Are you okay?” I almost laughed- I knew what I must look like, tear-streaks down my face, my hair even wilder than normal, still rocking back and forth with my hands clapped tightly over my ears. I just shrugged. “What’s wrong?” The blond dropped to the floor on my right side, depositing his bag to his left and pulling his long, slender legs up to his chest.
“Real Addams spirit, wouldn’t you say, Lurch?” The man addressed the chauffer, who upon Harry’s inspection appeared almost Frankenstein-esque. Something about his waxy, dead-looking skin and grunting agreement put Harry at ease. “Say, what is your name, pequeño?”
“Touch me and I slit your throat. I already did my aunt’s, so don’t doubt I’d be able.” He practically snarled, but to his surprise, the man grinned in response.
“Get out of my house. You are a disgrace to the name of Malfoy, and I will be submitting the paperwork for your disownment immediately. Come Monday morning, you will no longer be a member of this family.”
She didn't seem to be treating him any differently to normal, so he hoped they'd just be pretending the night before had never happened. She floated his tray over to him along with the toast and he helped himself to 2 slices, grinning when as soon as the smell hit Ron he stirred and pulled himself up into a sitting position.
