“So…so wait, does this mean that—” Hermione started but her thought cut off. “But…which…”
She zoned out as she read the rest to herself,
Persephone barely reacted to the younger girl, as she caught site of a tall, dark haired boy. She raised her hand but he had his eyes on her already. She met him half-way and took him in—he was wearing very nice dress robes of black, of course. She always forgot he was older than her. Now it was impossible to ignore, what with his handsome features on display with a well fitted top that hugged his shoulder, a black collared shirt under that first layer. He wore black leather gloves and was just now throwing an outer robe on with two silver pendants that were engraved with what looked like the Slytherin crest that linked with chains right by the collarbone that went down to his knees.
She noticed a newspaper held in its beak. The owl waddled its way over to Hagrid and dropped the newspaper on him. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. "Hey, hey, don't do that." She chastised it drowsily.
They made their way across the grounds around five to three, to where Hagrid lived. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.
—robes of an emerald green, though modern, for it ended just below her knees. Along with it were a black, over cloak, soft velvet that went to her elbows. She was glad she did not skimp her gift to Daphne.
“I didn’t say that,” She coughed. She wanted more water. “Where did you say we were?”
He nodded, “I can help you, if you let me.”
“You barely pay attention in class. You basically depend on my notes!” She said. She was building herself up to start going over their exams, as had become habit now.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Persephone knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
She hesitated but said, “Later. I have a bobby pin.”
“I had good reasons,” He said, raising his brows at her.
“Wait ‘till Fred and George find out!” Ron said, another high five shared between the two. “Better than any prank they’ve ever pulled!”
“Lils?” George snapped his fingers in front of her face and she started.
Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a sabre-toothed tiger.
Usually, the charm was supposed to freeze two or three pixies. Instead, the pixies all froze up in the air, floating slowly until they stopped mid-air.
His face fell, “Oh, god, sorry—I was so nervous, I barely remember anything from that day,” He smiled and chuckled and she smiled but thought to herself, his nervousness looked terribly smooth.
“He works for the Ministry,” Ron said. “You know we’re not supposed to do spells outside school —”
She realized she’d been staring at Ben when he suddenly caught her gaze. She looked away, “How are the dorms set up?”
“You didn’t realize?” Ben questioned from a considerable distance away.
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again at the same time. "You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see what it was standing on?
She had rushed to the nearest bathroom—she was so angry she was crying, letting cries of frustration out.
“I liked the movies, alright?" She raised a brow. She only recognized the name because Dudley's friends had a strange infatuation that Persephone herself couldn't quite understand. "And Obi-Wan and Han were my favorite characters."
Persephone was surprised to find that she was excelling in her classes, even without a wand. She was sure she’d be behind but here she was, doing great and understanding her classes. She earned house points, too, and usually was the one to help Neville understand what he didn’t in the common room.
“What…?”
“Working on it,” He gave her a nod, before passing by her with several feet between them.
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?" Persephone frowned in contemplation—it seemed like a simple mistake, as it was solved so quick with just a wave of his wand. Shouldn’t he be concerned
It was impossible to move on from such a subject and yet, they did. Diana was retelling a story about Hogwarts, which led to Persephone asking what house she’d been in and Diana telling her she was a Slytherin. That led to a long series of questions from Persephone to describe the common room in great detail. Despite seeing the common room, she was still fascinated.
She raised her brows, folding her arms, “That’s what I came for and you have to help because I’m your heir.”
She watched them peck at them, wondering if she was mentally okay. Did she finally lose her mind? Why were they eating so vigorously?
She grimaced, glancing up at Uncle Vernon, before taking the letter from the owl.
Benjamin had followed her and was standing in knee deep water. He slipped, throwing his hands out and for a moment, Persephone thought he would fall in. Instead, he laughed. His laugh was loud and piercing and boyish. For a moment he looked like any other boy.
He leaned away, “Uh, you’re all wet.”
“Uuuuhm,” Persephone took a bigger bite of her apple to avoid having to answer this ridiculous answer.
"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside.
A door stood ajar to her left, and she was thanking her lucky stars she was thin enough to slip through it without moving. She listened to them walk straight past, and Persephone waited for them to turn the corner. Finally, it was silent. She let out a breath, calling that one a close call.
There was no getting out of this one—Filch was leading them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor. He had them sit and wait without speaking. Hermione had started trembling and Neville was close to tears he was so scared. Persephone’s mind was going a hundred miles an hour, fidgeting nervously.
"Well done," Dumbledore told her quietly, so that only she could hear. "Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..."
Together, Tom and Persephone both thought, ‘
"Er—yes, they did, yes," Hagrid said, shuffling his feet. "I've still got the pieces, though," he added brightly.
“I don’t know, is Lucius Malfoy rich, pale, probably albino, and got a look like he’s permanently smelling something bad?” She asked. Fred snorted.
She wanted a cat—she wanted a cat more than she wanted anything ever—but when they walked passed the Owl Emporium she couldn’t help but reconsider—the babies in the windows were so cute! There was one who wasn’t a baby but wasn’t as big as the others, who watched her interestingly. She was a snowy white owl with big round amber eyes. Persephone tried to look at the other owls but she kept looking over at this particular owl, who also watched her. She couldn’t walk too far away, in fear someone else would notice the beauty. Now, Persephone carried a large cage that held the beauty who was fast asleep with her head under her wing. She was absolutely in love with her, unable to stop her stammering of thank you’s.
“So Snape is probably a vampire who’s after the stone for Voldemort or he’s a vampire trying to scare Quirrell off who wants the stone and that’s why he probably stuffs garlic up his turban!” She wheezed. “And Voldemort—Voldemort is living in the forest and he killed the unicorns!”
She hesitated before taking his arm, her chest filling with a nervous buzzing, “It won’t be so bad. If it’s a duet, usually the guy supports the girl so you can support me, and lift me in the air. It’s really casual and we all have our little groups. We can be in the same group,” She smiled at him and she felt like the luckiest girl in the world to be the one he smiled at so genuinely.
They’d just crossed into the next cart when someone stopped them. A girl had just come out of her compartment, looking first in curiosity at the trio before seeing Neville, “Oh, Neville, there you are!”
Confused and disappointed by the teacher, she left the class to catch up with Ron on the stairs. "Hey, cheer up," she said, "Snape doesn’t seem like any Gryffindors, I mean, blaming
Something simply did not sit right with Persephone for the rest of the week. She passed it off as anxiety to Ron and Susan but she had to admit, it felt worse than anxiety. Not even cuddling up to Salem did the trick. Simply put, something was deeply disturbed in her.
. He groaned. She frowned. “George!” She nudged him and finally he started blinking awake.
Ron gritted his teeth as he pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
“Is there something I can help you with?” Persephone shook her head a little too vigorously—anxiety ran through her veins so violently she felt dizzy.  “And so explain why you are lurking?”
His face fell, “You still haven’t grown your wand?”
"The whole school's out there!" Fred Weasley said, peering out of the door. "Even—blimey—Dumbledore's come to watch!"
She froze as she flipped through her script. Oh gods…She turned around slowly, and cleared her throat, “Yes?”
“What’s funny?”
McGonagall’s mouth set in a way that Persephone knew meant she did not believe a word she had said, “Miss Potter, that may be the most ludicrous story I have ever heard from a student, and I taught your father.” Persephone felt her insides crumble.
Another hit on the car, barely missing Persephone, sent the car off her. The car shot backwards, as if in reverse. The tree was still trying to get another hit in, but the car had sped off away. Ron had grabbed Persephone by the arm and pulled her into the car through the window. She could hear the roots of the tree creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.
and he followed a few feet away by jumping and landing into a summersault completely in sync for when she hit the ground. When she lifted her leg in a ballet move, he did the same from the floor in a contemporary move, throwing his body up with the support of one arm.
“Right, well,” She said, getting into first position, “As much as threats are so appropriate in dance, knowing the basic positions is too. This is first position.”
“Why, a good morning to you all!” He cried out, beaming at the assembly of students. “Oh, don’t mind your professor’s tardiness—I was just showing Professor Sprout the proper way to tend to a Whomping Willow. But don’t start any rumours, now! I don’t want you running away with the idea that I’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels…”
She nodded once, “I am.”
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Persephone saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.
” She read out loud.
Hagrid grinned down at Persephone.
Everyone’s eyes turned to look at her, in shock. She waited, staring up at Lucius Malfoy. He pursed his lips, “Well, a prime example of how little muggle brought up witches are taught. Have you no respect, girl, of the trauma that has been brought on my family? How dare you ask such a question?”
“Right,” He sighed and looked up at her and suddenly she recognized the accent.
He nodded in a most obvious way, “Did you think I’d be stupid enough not to bring someone? And he has a camera—I wanted a picture.”
“What a night,” he muttered, “Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned…”
The owl did not seem fazed, it just kept hopping over to her. “Owls are nocturnal!” She tried to reason out loud. “Whaaat.” She panted.
and it sorted through their minds, deciding in which how they would fit in best. The four houses were Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. She didn’t expect to be put in Gryffindor, for her belief that she wasn’t brave. And it was still true—she wasn’t brave. She was very disappointed to find she wasn’t put in Slytherin. She was surprised, now, to find she was still upset over it.
“As I ‘ave missed you!” She smiled back. “I’m so sorry for saying anything—really, everything’s been so hectic—here have you met my foster brother?”
“They’ve never pranked me,” She twirled a strand of green hair. “Weird prank, but efficient.” She sighed. “I think I gave them the idea back in first term.”
Persephone felt a blinding light over her, a ringing in her ears, “It’s not their fault!” Her voice was trembling. She pushed herself away and off George, to push herself into a sitting position against the wall. “We were…” Her breathing became restraint as pain filtered through her vision. She couldn’t tell as to what hurt.
"The little bronze ones."
it. She truly felt every particle of oxygen and hydrogen, and she was sure she could probably ball up the air into her hand and it would solidify—but that was not her plan.
She held in a scream, as she was without air at the moment and stared up at the thing, and she stumbled back, her feet snapping a few twigs. The small noise proceeding made the thing jump and back up.
“No—it’s not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named—”
cloak for the
“You named your cat Minerva?” One of the twins asked and the boy nodded, too distracted with trying to force a collar on the poor thing. “Like, McGonagall?”
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
“I—” She tried to interrupt but he continued.
She looked to find it to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. She peered in and saw the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.
Mr. Weasley was a tall, thin man, going bald but the little hair he had was a fiery red. He wore a long green dusty and travel-worn robes. He greeted Mrs. Weasley with a kiss on the cheek, a pat on Persephone’s head, which she thought was odd but then decided he probably mistook her for one of his children, being as she had fiery red hair. He was obviously very tired, as he slumped into a chair, taking his glasses off.  He was groping around for the teapot as the boys came in, taking seats all sat around him.
!—and as she stepped through the archway, she gasped as the archway shrink back into a solid wall. She double checked with Hagrid that she was really seeing what she just saw, and was glad she couldn’t find words to express her feeling of amazement because she would have just talked Hagrid’s ear right off. He grinned at Persephone amazement.
‘No, I’m not scared,’ She asserted quickly, ‘I just didn’t know.’
And then Pansy Parkinson was called and, though Persephone hated to admit it, she sang beautifully. There was a strange tune to it but it was bearably beautiful. She hated it.
She didn’t expect presents, but she expected a fun day. She cherished the moments alone, in her dorm, basked in the firelight, watching snow whistle outside the windows. It was such a peaceful scene that she fell asleep in her clothing.
“Big deal,” Ron said, holding onto Persephone’s shoulder for support as her rubbed his foot where the photographer had harshly stepped on. Persephone had not looked up from her book but Gilderoy Lockhart had looked up from his at Ron’s comment.
“Hmm…” She pursed her lips, “Usually, I’d let you, maybe even join you, but its dance. I don’t want to be late.”
“That part where he got cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf—ugh!” She gushed, “What were your favorite parts?” She asked.
He was staring hard at the tapestry, at his own name.
“Don’t talk about my family,” Persephone said through clenched teeth.
“Er, hi?” She said. How awkward was this? Should she hug him? Shake his hands? Make fun of him for what he was currently wearing? Despite how surprising it was to see him so…neat, it was no laughing matter.
Hermione let out a great sigh and Persephone was surprised to find she was smiling.
“What did you just do?” Persephone whispered as the music started again.
“You don’t know that any more than I do!” She exclaimed. “And I’m not doing that!” She shouldn’t have gotten so mad but then again he shouldn’t have tried telling her what to do.
Suddenly, George became the apple of her eye and she listened to his breathing. He was conflicted, this much she could feel from him—she could feel a lot, as she lost her ability to logically think and he was lost. But, beyond that, she could feel his blood pulsing through his veins—she could feel his heart beating. A sudden wringing sensation in her hands made her want to pull her fingers through his hair, to count every freckle out and to memorize the exact color of his eyes, to taste his blood—she snapped upright, feeling a sudden tightening in her throat, making her unable to breath properly.
“Dreadful!” Helga cried, “Absolutely dreadful! If I’d have known—”
She wondered idly if the Percy Jackson world was real—if it weren’t fiction at all. Who was to say if a magical world like this existed, that a Greek mythological one didn’t exist too?
“Haha,” She sneered. “This is serious—what do I do!?”
“I’ll believe it when I see it.” He paused, thinking, “And maybe not even then.”
An owl was perched outside, on the lining of the window, staring at her with big eyes. She thought for a moment she was hallucinating, given the article she had just read, but then she noticed something. Clasped between it beaks was a letter—a familiar enveloped letter.
Without a second thought, the young witch abandoned her cloak and shoes and threw herself into the water.
Lee was still commentating.
Persephone, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them, and her head nearly spun with them. "But what happened to Vol—You-Know-Who?"
She slid down the passageway as it started to become steeper and steeper, hoping this wasn’t the twins’ way of getting her back finally, when it then offered a drop. She was so startled by the sudden fall that she had no time to scream and then she was sliding again, gasping. It was becoming colder until finally, her feet hit the wall and crumpled, allowing for her knees to pop onto the stone wall. She hissed a curse under her breath before catching her breath. Those twins didn’t even warn her…
Their trolleys hit the barrier as if though they were any other ordinary brick wall. Ron’s trunk fell off with a loud thump while Persephone was lunged forward, knocking Hedwig’s cage to the floor. She rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?”
think it’s cute?” He was definitely smirking now but then dropped the camera lens. She rolled her eyes.
He seemed as nervous as she was, so she asked in a tone she hoped to be calm, "What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?"
They were headed towards the forest, this much Persephone could see. Filch seemed disturbingly delighted, too much so, and Persephone could only wonder what sort of punishment they had to endure.
Filled with anxiety, she watched her disappear behind the office door behind the large desk. It took a few minutes for her to return and when she did, she seemed more than smug—like she had just won something Persephone did know was taking place.
Persephone felt she should have felt calmer—if they would be with Hagrid for their detention, could it really be that bad?
He walked off towards his Hufflepuff friend and she stared at the pastry. Gently, she rewrapped it and placed it in his bag.
"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!"
Madame Pince handed the book to Persephone but when she tried to take it, she did not let go. She stared her down while saying, “Any damages and you will be expelled from the library for the next seven years of your academic life.”
Hades met her eyes once more, “Persephone?”
Persephone was still laughing and gasping for air at her sudden burst for exercise while Ron collapsed on the floor, heaving.
“What?”
a Hufflepuff.”
Enough sense to calm her down, at least.
Herbology classes were held out in the greenhouses, behind the castle. They were taught by the Head of Hufflepuff, Professor Sprout. This class they had with Professor Sprout’s house, where Susan immediately reached out and made sure to be seated right by Persephone’s other side, whereas Ron was on her right. The class called for a good amount of manual labor to take care of all sorts of strange plants and fungi. While the plants held still for her to care for them, Susan had to wrestle the violent plant down so that Hannah Abbot could water the right leaves.
"Now, you listen here, girl," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured—and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion—asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types—just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end—"
Persephone, cringing, left her friends regretfully, following along slowly.
They were sent on their way to the Gryffindor tower then, both waiting until they got through the portrait of the Fat Lady, when Ron whistled, “I thought we’d had it,” He said, glancing at her almost carefully.
Hermione kept her distance, hovering anxiously and giving tips to the other girls on how to help. Persephone doesn’t remember much but she does remember Lavender holding her to her chest and stroking her hair while Parvati held her hands. The two girls insisted on staying with her and they all somehow squeezed onto Persephone’s bed for the night—or morning, given how late into the night it was.
When she saw Ben again, she had an epiphany.
"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy on the other side. They were twins. "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell
was the seeker here!
And here there was, clutched in her hand, a chance to go to a school for people like her—away from people like Aunt Petunia, who ignored her freakiness and pretended like she didn’t exist for it. People who could do what she can do. Maybe people had color changing hair existed in this Hogwarts—wizards and witches weren’t that far off in the mythical. There had always been people who did things that no scientific textbook could explain. It just happened, with no explanation—maybe
She flipped through several books on sirens, stacking them up in one hand. She just wanted to be sure of something—this was the excuse she gave herself. She just wanted to prove a point. And who said knowledge was a sin? Well, she didn’t know if it was or not so don’t quote her.
She followed the map closely, avoiding any ghosts and cats wandering the halls. The sun was just rising when she was standing outside his office. The tower was guarded by a large and ugly stone gargoyle and she shivered—it reminded her of her run in with the gargoyle in the library. She narrowed her eyes—could this gargoyle been the one following her?
Persephone nodded, turning to Ron and Hermione, “See you later, I hope.”
She took a moment to pick out some non-wizard outfits as well—she’d still had clothes at the Dursleys from the very most generous neighbors but she found it extremely thrilling, buying some of her own—new and with her own money, along with her tights and even three headbands. She ended up also picking shoes from here too, one pair of flat shoes of shiny black and a pair of lace up, slim boots that went up just below her knees. It was all three galleons, including her flying robes, school robes, shoes and accessories.
"Yes and no," Dumbledore said quietly. "You, who have never known your family, will today see them standing around you. And Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. And then, Fred and George Weasley will seem themselves standing, successful with their shared dreams that they’ve been discouraged for, being fully accepted. Perhaps, in some years, or even months, your desire can change. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible, completely taken by the one image when it could have changed in the time they’ve wasted.”
“I am nice—I don’t have to help you with your wand,” He told her, again without meeting her eyes. “Hand me your core?”
“If he meets Gary, they’ll start making posters and pins,” He continued and she slapped his shoulder.
She snorted and they made their way towards the portrait hole, only for someone to make a, ‘hmp’ sound behind them and to bump Persephone’s shoulder as she marched by—“Oi! Watch where you’re going!” Ron called after Hermione.
Flitwick’s shoulders fell but he nodded, “Yes, Mr. Keller.”
She chose to ignore that nickname and shrugged, “I noticed you know most of the castle incredibly well—how is that?”
“You got the front page with me and it gave you a thrill, eh? Needed more of the feeling so you did the biggest thing you could think of.”
Malfoy smirked, “Unless you can prove you aren’t—tonight, if you want.  Wizard's duel. Wands only—no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose? I suppose only wizards know of them—and you’re just a little—”
She stared at him, waiting.
“Look through those books over there, I’ll take the desk.”
She started to walk towards it, feeling her heart in her throat—and then she walked quickly towards it, working up the nerve to start running before she finally felt her last sense of resolve drain away and she started running towards it, knowing very well if she wanted to stop she could not. She kept her eyes closed as the barrier neared and just as she knew the impact would come, it didn’t.
So the four of them threw George’s blanket off the bed and slid the mattress off the bed. As quietly as they could, they pushed the mattress down out the door and then, before she could stop them, Fred and George had the brilliant plan of taking it for a toboggan ride.
“Moon won’t be out for a few hours,” He said, staring at her warily. She blinked. “You don’t want to drown me?”
But coming down to respecting magic came down to also treating it right. Some magic that depended on more unpredictable parts of nature—like the wind. Asking permission is required. Persephone had to ask the wind for permission before she could use it to help herself and it never failed her. It wasn’t always reliable, however, and uncontrollable at times should the right mind, soul and heart be trying it. Those able to use wandless and non-verbal magic are more in tune with magic.
He awarded her ten points for Gryffindor and offered her some books for further reading, but his words were better than any amount of house points. She was smiling, looking at her lap, trying desperately to fight the sting in her eyes, when she noticed someone staring at her.
He stared and then snorted, “What? Are you scared?”
“Only…by choice…?”
“I hope we get put in the same class,” Ron said when they saw the notice.
“What’s up?” Fred asked.
“I will never get on your bad side when you’re hungry,” Fred said as she let him go in front of the basement stairs.
“Not really…we just happen to be in the same places sometimes—”
“Get us back?” Fred raised a brow.
As shocking as the situation was, it was comical after the initial shock. She and Susan went off to the girls’ laboratory to wash off and she fell into a fit of giggles—they looked ridiculous! Her red hair had been thoroughly touched by the green dye and her perfectly dark red hair had been turned an emerald green, nearly matching her eye.
Gary spoke up for the first time, “Six…” His voice broke and he spoke again. “Six brothers.”
Finally, when dinner was announced at 8:15 sharp, they moved to the dining room. Persephone was starving. She forgot that she had not eaten since...had she eaten today?
When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, “You have thirty minutes—start—now!”
As the taller one, Spinner, took a step forward, she surged her leg forward, kicking him in the stomach straight. He looked down at his shabby attire and sneered before seeing something—she had been bleeding, still, from the cut and some blood had spattered on his shirt. Her blood shimmered on his shirt, shimmering like a diamond.
"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --"
Hermione sighed, “What are you talking about—”
“Needs the soil.” He said.
Daphne Greengrass was a very funny girl when she wasn’t around Pansy. She didn’t think she’d get along so nicely with that annoying girl’s best friend but here she was. She was surprised Pansy hadn’t set Daphne completely against Persephone, but after her win in Quidditch, it didn’t even matter than she was Slytherin and Persephone Gryffindor—she wanted to talk about Quidditch. She did, however, comment on the cat that was peeping out of Persephone’s cloak.
“My Chamber of Secrets!” He bellowed, “What other chamber?”
She reacted accordingly, and she ran for it. She slipped into a large black cabinet nearby, closing it behind them. She waited, breathing silently when a mere few seconds later, she heard the bell above a door clang and footsteps following immediately after.
“Oh my god! Hagrid!” Persephone gasped as she made the connection. “Whoever tried to rob Gringotts did it on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!"
“That was terribly inappropriate!” She giggled.
“Again, what I
It was such casual conversation that it made Persephone’s head spin. Vampires? Hags? What next? Werewolves? Zombies? She’d never been allowed to connect herself to the internet at the Dursleys, never mind they paid the same price and she’d literally built her own computer, so she had vague ideas what these monsters looked like from what Dudley’s conversations with his friends. To have them in this new world seemed insane. “Do demigods exist?” She questioned, hoping for a yes.
She raised a brow, “I didn’t say which professor.”
There was a magical school in Turin, named
Persephone watched him bring out a pen and pad of parchment and he scribbled down something. “Your eyes are the same as they were when you couldn’t see—how’s your vision now?”
“Y-your mother? I thought…” Persephone trailed off. Was Mrs. Johnson not Diana’s mother? How could—what?
“RUN!” They both called to her, and when they got close enough, George grabbed her hand and pulled her forward. Barefoot, they skidded around the corner as water pulsed behind them and George pulled her into a closet with Fred close behind them.
"Don't, Gary, we'll send you loads of owls."
“I guess…” Persephone pursed her lips. “I guess the best part is I get to go to dance class.”
But the car had begun to shudder, the engine making whining sounds. Persephone stared, concerned. Ron was saying something, “Almost there, almost there.” He was saying it more to the car than to them. Then all of a sudden, it started shuddering and picking up speed, heading straight for the Black Lake.
Uncle Vernon chuckled heartily, “Nonsense! Who’d be writing to her?”
“Well, Ron,” She hesitated before someone knocked right into Persephone and hurried past. As every cliché played out, it was Hermione.
“What is it you need, young grasshopper?” George asked, “We haven’t got all day, now.”
There was a silence that followed and she was sure that homophobia would sure ensue soon. She quickly said, “I think you two would make wonderful fathers.”
Persephone found she spent a whole ton of time in the Room of Requirement, more than she cared to admit. Ben was there half the time but other than that, it was just her.
“What year are you really in?” She narrowed her eyes.
Ron turned to the other two.
“Have a crush, do we?” Fred grinned at her.
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," Dumbledore smiled, much to her relief. “Not wearing our glasses, are we?”
He passed a cut up piece of her cake and passed it to her and she hesitantly took a bite, all the while watching the giant watch her. He didn’t seem at all like any other strange man she’d ever thought of would break into places. He was very relaxed, his eyes filled with tenderness, as if he was watching baby ducklings try to walk.
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"
She thought about the conversation for a long moment as she walked to rehearsals—she wasn’t surprised. He seemed very accepting of everything and everyone—he was accepting of her being a siren, at least. The only thing he’d ever had a problem with, a serious problem with, was with older boys having a crush on a younger girls. She’d talked to him about the punching boys rumor and he’d told her not to flatter herself and that he wasn’t only interested in hospitalizing boys that had crushes on her.
Persephone was small enough to slip in, dragging both her friends in with lots of force that caused several witches to give them dirty looks. Then they had a job of it to fight their way to where Mrs. Weasley was with the rest of the boys and Hermione’s parents. They had each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2, thank god, because Persephone was most certainly not meeting this guy.
Ben stood in ankle deep water, staring off as she disappeared. He was gasping, unable to keep himself from feeling the fear he did. He’d asked Diana to cover for them, without giving a proper reason as to why, but now? Would Persephone come back?
She couldn’t even get lunch as she was told auditions for the school play would be held at this time. She rushed out of her class to the Charms classroom. She ducked passed people hanging around in the halls and nearly tripped over some of the trick stairs. She skidded into the classroom with a loud squeak of her shoes, drawing several annoyed glances. Blushing, she avoided the eyes and got in line to sign her name on the sign-up sheet and take a form.
Persephone had to take the extra length to keep her mind on her lessons. If she didn’t focus, her mind would wander to the new broomstick that was lying under her bed, or to the Quidditch field where she'd be learning to play that night. She sped through her dinner very quickly that evening, and then bolted upstairs with Ron to unwrap her Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
“Dobby had to punish himself, miss,” The elf sad miserably and cross eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir…”
Persephone’s mouth dropped open, “But…they won’t possible pay and I don’t want you to either!”
The little creature had large bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Persephone knew, without a doubt that she had seen this morning.
"Wow," said Ron. He said nothing more. He stared for a moment, along moment, before realizing her averting eyes and looking away.
Unfortunately, they weren’t able to visit that many cathedrals but they were able to get some gelato before heading back to meeting Reginald and Mary. They planned a more together trip to visit the magical communities of Venice for the next day and finally the jet lag caught up with them.
The ghost girl had disappeared and Persephone was just standing there, looking like an idiot. “Er…”
I know what this is—A complete set of the Chudley Cannons trilogy, with their books and posters and—ooooh! Signed jerseys!” He was shocked. “But…but how…But Lily I can’t….”
“Hm, Charlie’s brother?” She asked.
"Look—at—yeh! In here—all—my—ruddy—fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!"
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before she could.
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Persephone fell off. She got slowly and shakily to her feet—he couldn’t possibly believe she would tell him what she saw in the mirror?
“Old Filly has asked me to be the official documenter for the process of putting together this little shindig—the more no-maj touches, the better, in his words,” He cocked an eyebrow in thought and raised the camera again. “Anything our young, ambitious actors would like to say?”
Persephone froze, hissing at him, “Be quiet.”
"Play Quidditch at all?"
; no in
She collapsed against the wall, “And how am I to have a hand in that? Write to the board of governors? He’s much too respected for anyone to actually do anything.”
Set Gryffindors apart;
She looked around wildly—the corridor was too narrow to simply shrink against the wall. She could either wait here to be trample or…or could she possible hide behind the suit of armor…or…or—oh! A chance!
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face.
“If you’re so sure…” He said, but he was a lot happier with not being embarrassed. “Your turn.”
"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away, much to Persephone’s pleasure. She moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake, telling it about sorry she was people treated her (him?) like that. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Persephone’s.
“Famous enough to be recognized, eh Georgie?” Fred slapped his brother’s arm.
She broke water a few seconds later, gasping and pushing herself forward to the shore. Stumbling out, she looked around for Ron. As if the car was waiting for her to break water, the nose of the car dropped. She watched, horrified, as the car fell out of the air, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall.
“Yes, but your broom has a history of trying to throw passengers off.”
“I see you’ve all bought a complete set of my books—well done. I thought we’d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about—just to check how well you’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in—”
She finally took a moment to herself to go down to the lake, to be away from everyone in the common room. It was a sunny day, where she sat under a tree by the lake, staring at it in fascination. She felt something tingling in her legs, like they were asleep. It happened often when she was around the lake. She took her shoes and socks off and dipped her feet into the lake.
“Dammit Longbottom!” Malfoy took off. Completely impulsively, Persephone chucked the dye straight at him before yelling for them run. Malfoy had disappeared, looking more red haired by the time he was gone.
Persephone did not understand what was going on.
He looked up at her in surprise, “You sound as though you’ve accepted the fact that you’re a—”
Five minutes before her birthday, she was curled into a ball, rocking back and forth to keep herself from freezing, staring at Dudley’s light up wristwatch. Her stomach rumbled and she felt that she would have severe back pain in the morning, should she find sleep any time soon. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight and the chattering of her teeth. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Persephone she'd be eleven in a few minute’s time. She lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where Minerva McGonagall was now.
from the trophy room.
George, seeing her mouth drop and her eyes widened, snickered and winked as he dipped his fingers into the flowerpot.
suffered through it like a girl did? Probably not—she didn’t care. She mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up she soared; air rushed through her hair, and her flying robes whipped out about her.
"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started."
In a low whisper, Persephone explained what she had heard and seen.
“Sorry, I have to, uh,” He pointed towards the vaults and she raised a brow.
“So, all those symptoms from before?” She told Ron. “Those are just symptoms that I have because I’m a siren. You know, rashes, fast heart, really good reflexes—all of that.”
For school—she was spending money for school, as she’d always planned. This was
She crossed her legs and undid her knot of hair on the top of her head. Wet curls fell to her shoulders in knots.
She’d never dreamed of such a stadium before—hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Persephone of the little plastic sticks children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
She didn’t sleep that night. She wasn’t tired—she was too excited. First she gets a magic map that could help her sleuth, next she meets the founders of Hogwarts, or their portraits at least. Meeting them raised the question of how alike portraits are to their living counterparts. What if their living counterparts weren’t living?
Okay, well no. She wouldn’t. But she’d like to.
He almost smiled, “Complicated family stuff—and you didn’t answer my question. Were you going to dive into the lake in under sixty—sorry, under ten degree weather?”
She flipped through the book she’d gotten from the library, the one Ben wanted. Damocles Belby was a very brilliant potioneer—he’d invented the Wolfsbane Potion not too long ago, a very complex potion that relieves the symptoms of lycanthropy. It was made up of Wolfsbane, hence the title, which was a poisonous substance.
Mrs. Weasley faltered in her pouring Persephone some juice but continued, “Ah, well, I have heard marvelous things of your dancing—Ron says you’re just a good a dancer as a Seeker. You’re welcome to stay with us for the entirety of the summer, if you’d like. The Diggory’s are not too far from here.”
“Your eyes—”
She thought of the stars, moon and sea all the way to lunch. She thought it was funny—Hades, Diana and she were like the stars, moon and sea. If, of course, Hades were actually named Pluto. And that would just be the funniest fucking thing ever.
The Gryffindor common room was noisy that evening—many were hyping up for the game tomorrow. The trio sat together by a window—Hermione was checking Ron’s Charms homework for him, while Persephone was hyping herself up to go get her book back. It wasn’t that she was afraid of her potions teacher—she was just…just….
He shrugged, “Wasn’t expecting anything. Open it.”
Malfoy looked at her as if she were insane and seemed to take a step back from her—and for good reason. She looked lethal and ready to kill, silently staring at him, the smile still on her face.
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's that Weasley brother, who's got no money—you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains." Malfoy pointedly ignored the fact that George Weasley was also on his house’s team.
“American?” Ben laughed, “Is that what I’m known for?”
He almost smiled, “I’ve very good at Divination—you wouldn’t believe what happens to the Archie gang.” He turned to Cedric. “And how’s our leading man?”
It was still pretty early so the air was nippy but warming. Her pony tail swung with every one of her strides across the grounds. No one was out in the foggy morning and the fresh air was incredible to Persephone.
While Potions and Transfiguration were the most interesting, Charms looked to be the most fun, only because she understood each spell and charm incantation. Most spells and charm incantations were in Latin, which was very lucky for Persephone, who’d made the connections between Spanish and Latin. She also picked up a book on Latin from the library as well.
“I’m not sure, Freddie, but I definitely won’t take her for granted.”
“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic outside school,” Uncle Vernon said. “You risked being expelled for the deal, did you?”
She panicked—him wanting something in return meant he knew how to help her and she wouldn’t lose her literal only chance at progress with her wand.
A few seconds later, the door was thrown open. “Girl!” He shouted. Behind him, Aunt Petunia peered over his shoulder.
“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Persephone.
There were some hints to the building’s original architecture, which made it seem like time was unmoving, stuck between ancient and moderns times—the furniture was Victorian, the murals depicted people that Persephone recognized from the 17
Persephone did not receive any mail since Hagrid's note—this was something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course, because he was hyperactively aware of her every move, apparently. It wasn’t any better that Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
She hummed, “You’re basically on the Gryffindor team.”
carved beautifully into the flooring.
Persephone was startled to find she had tears streaming down her face—guilt immediately coiled in her stomach. “She heard you.”
"Don't be stupid," said Ron.
Those were its words.
"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else—something that will bring you back to full strength and power—something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?"
“Oh suddenly, we can harmonize?” Ryn asked, crossing his arms. “When we practice, you can’t handle a harmony but now, you can? Interesting.”
Persephone felt her insides turn into ice, and she knew from just the name the voice called her by that this wasn’t a student. She turned to look behind her, and was shocked to see it wasn’t even a teacher—it was Albus Dumbledore. She must have walked right past him, so desperate to see her parents that she didn’t even notice him.
She blanked, "There's more than two?"
He fidgeted, “Siren hair.”
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. Persephone rolled her eyes at them and took a great leap over the tree, using her newfound powers. When Ron caught up to her, not in the slightest surprised at her talent, he was still mad.
“I’m just tired,” She sighed, rubbing her eyes.
The little area around the fireplace reminded her of the Gryffindor common room—warmth.
“Who?” She asked, blinking heavily.
," Draco Malfoy said one Potions class, his confidence back with his platinum blonde hair, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home."
"So we were right, it
"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered to Persephone.
He peeked at her, “My entire family is either dead or imprisoned for life or disowned. I’m the only person to be legally able to inherit anything.”
“Oh my god,” She suddenly gasped, looking at his shoulder where the deer had bitten her friend, “Oh my god, was the bite infectious?”
Some chairs down the table, Persephone could also recognize Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
“Sorry!” She cried, clutching her ribs as she got up, “Faulty wheels!”
Her mouth had already dropped at the amazing architecture feature—how did that even, but the volume
“Why, come sit with us,” She offered, smiling very sweetly until her eyes went back to Hermione. “You don’t need to be wandering around with magic-stealers.”
“Either way,” Ron said, “I’ll be gone by next Tuesday.”
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“What’s going on?” She asked the group she recognized as the theatre club.
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
Persephone recognized the name as something Susan’s friends had once mentioned.  Wasn’t it…Gilderoy Lockhart? She was accurate, as she read the fancy gold title on the book:
Welcome back! Hopefully you are all enjoying the story so far, even though we have yet to get to the juicy bit. I hope you drop comments, I adore reading them and they simply motivate me to continue to update regularly!
“’Mione, you are simply brilliant. When shall we do this?”
Brilliant—absolutely brilliant. What even was a fire seed bush?
“I am half-spanish.”
This woke him up thoroughly, “Brilliant.”
“I didn’t notice,” She muttered, examining her silver hair. It was pretty—it glowed like the moon. The moon. Right! “We should head back inside before the moon comes out.”
“Persephone Potter.” Draco answered for her. Pansy looked surprised. “We’ve met, though you told me your name was Lily, no?”
Without taking her eyes off the headmaster, she leaned over and asked, “Is he mad?” to Percy.
"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."
“Well, I suppose I ought to re-introduce myself.” She smiled and suddenly Persephone knew why the girl in the picture in the album Hagrid had given her looked so familiar. “My real name is Mary Cattermole, though my maiden name is Mary MacDonald.”
She was now spending all her free time in the library now that she had no rehearsals to get to. Flitwick was visibly glum and depressed and no matter how many of his theatre students sent him gift baskets, he would no cheer up. She was hoping with the approaching holidays, some happiness would come about. Hermione and Ron joined her in the library most times, in search of Flamel. Usually, however, Persephone got distracted and accidently got into reading something with no correlation to Flamel.
Dumbledore hummed, coming near her without a sound, almost like he was floating, “He is.”
She turned to the rest of the class.
"I have strength enough... for this...."
Persephone glanced down at her broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.
She thought for a moment, and then she smiled. “How about…hm…midnight? Kitchens?”
“You—you idiot!” He exclaimed. “Why would you say that?”
“Oh, goodness, there you are, right on time,” Mrs. Weasley said breathlessly, patting down her hair. “We’ll be able to see him in a minute…”
“Sounds like wings,” Persephone said, trying to ignore the two and the urge to giggle at Ron. "There's light ahead—I can see something moving."
,” She raised her brows at the girl. “I told her I’m waiting for a letter and she assumed.” She said accusingly.
"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Persephone jumped, freezing on the spot. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.
“Finally,” George suddenly said from next to her. “Thought they’d never get together.”
Ron was torn between accepting the gift and being embarrassed because he had always been against what he considered ‘charity’. Finally, quietly, he said, “Thank you.”
It was a set of pretty wrap skirts, very simply patterns, and several pointe shoe wraps. She hugged him in thanks, complimenting him.
“I most certainly do not
“Nah mate, she never loved you!” George edged on. “
She thought about that for a long moment. They were far beyond t
They took a stop the next day at the Caffe Gilli for pastries and to satisfy Diana’s apparent addiction to caffeine. They took a bus to Fiesole where they found themselves at the hilltop town that overlooks the valley of Florence. Granted, they took the wrong bus but still ended up in a beautiful place. They toured a roman theater, the San Francesco convent and then was dragged out to the hiking trails by Ben, who was going on about how amazing and incredible it was that they were standing where Da Vinci had first tried out his flying machines.
"A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched one."
"JORDAN!"
noses, twitching and quivering in their direction;
Then suddenly, a hand on her shoulder made her jump—it was so cold. She looked back to see Dumbledore’s smiling face.
“Or,” Ron interlude, “Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy—and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocus—I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through --"
Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? Did that happen with high tide?
“Have to,” He said. “I made a compromise with my aunt, though, about my name. My middle name is Di Angelo.”
He finally brought out three boxes and placed them next to each, “Will you please raise your wand hand and face down your palm to the box?”
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," Hermione said in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you."
Apparently it was much too early for any lunch venues so they hunted down some cafes, for brioches and fruit of the season. Next, they visited a bookstore, Acqua Alta—
“Hurry up, girl!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke and she spun, taking a wide step to her cupboard, cringing as she opened it with the tiniest of creaks (she’d fixed and oiled the door back in June!) and tucked the letter between the top of the loose doorframe. She let her hand go and it didn’t fall and she closed and open the cupboard door and it still didn’t fall. She prayed it wouldn’t fall should either of the other occupants of the house open the door as she closed it for the final time and took a step into the kitchen, “Finally!” Uncle Vernon grumbled, snatching the letters from her hands.
“But it—it says! 'Ms. P. L. Potter, The Cupboard Under the Stairs, 4 Privet Drive—'" He read out for his father, before Uncle Vernon, with a strangled cry, leapt from his seat and yanked the letter out of his hands and cried,
She dried herself off easily—siren power? Maybe—before putting the dress on. The dress looked old-fashioned, more 50s inspired then modern. It was baby pink, with lots of slippery silk above the actual skirt. It was a collared dressed with see through, loose silk adorning the bodice. The bodice was heart shaped, with button to the skirt that hugged her waist.
“Oh lord, Patrick,” Alexandra rolled her eyes. “We’re not first years anymore—”
She glanced at Uncle Vernon and he nodded. She smiled, “Very well, sir. I find the school is a wonderful opportunity for me.”
“We couldn’t let her die professor!”
"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad—knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find—anyway..."
"Ron—"
Sirens' eyes are much better adapted for the water and I always imagine that they are excellent star readers, being as there is no light pollution in the middle of the ocean. This is my reasoning of why she's able to see the sky so clearly.
Persephone thought for a moment. Shouldn’t it already know what she liked being called, if it knew her mind?
Persephone’s heart skipped a beat, “Like—like dance class?”
Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard.
George held his hand out and she took it. However, a screech behind her alerted her to the one thing she forgot, halfway through the window. “Hedwig!”
Persephone had given up trying to reason. She’d given the proper excuse of how Hedwig wasn’t used to being locked up all day and night, that she was used to flying around. Of course, this only led to Uncle Vernon becoming offended, snarling about how he knew that the owl being let out would be a means of communication.
Then, she grabbed her magical brush and quickly went through the length of her hair several times, having it come out in big waves and curls that hung gracefully around her face.
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red card!"
"T—there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.
Hermione had pulled out the hand mirror from Persephone’ bag and Persephone stared into her eyes in the mirror, concentrating hard. Slowly, at first, but quick in the end, she began to feel her skin burn then crakle and cool and Pansy Parkinson was staring back at her. Her usual blue and green eyes were a dark brown and her nose was flatted and more of a slope, her nostrils big and wide. Her skin lost its pink tinge and was now pale white.
Percy shook his head distantly. Persephone thought for a moment—what could the brothers had been not saying? First George, then Fred, and now Percy, completely silent? She knew Ron had said the whole just of it—and she could understand. He had older brothers who had done it all—and he stood alone, doing all the things he had. He had all the attention and praise. Growing up in such a large family, being one of the youngest, she could understand why he desired this.
“Okay—okay so Snape is a harsh character, right? He’s your number one pick of sketchy, is he not?” Persephone asked, raising her brow.
She was relieved to find some familiar faces—she was put in the third year dance classes with the other third years.
“All right, Lily?” George grinned.
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Persephone shivered in the cold night air, or in her nerves, and crossed her arms to keep warm. A lamp was bobbing over the heads of the students, and Persephone was thrilled to hear a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Sephie?"
“Native language to merpeople, you familiar with it?” She shook her head. “Hm. Maybe it’s like demigods with Greek—maybe it comes naturally? Maybe there’s some Dylan Marwood somewhere here…”
“I’m in Gryffindor’s house,” Persephone spoke up. “What is this place?”
“Down this way, Professor Snape,” They all heard coming from where Filch had disappeared to, from where the twins and Persephone were about to head down. The three shared a look and ran down the hall where Ben was, laughing and screaming as they did.
"Kept what from me?" Persephone asked in exasperation. “That I’m a magician?”
!” Daphne whispered, scandalised and excited. “Do tell, my dear!”
"That doesn’t explain what Hagrid would be doing here, though…” Hermione muttered.
“Your call, Malfoy.”
She stared at him, surprised, before catching herself and remembering her manners, “Thank you?”
"Every year she makes us all a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and mine's always maroon. One of yours is at least a
“I’d say get a room, but Mum would have all our heads,” Someone said. They jumped apart, and saw Fred at the doorway. George flung off the bed, standing awkwardly before bidding her a red-faced goodnight. He darted past Fred and Fred started grinning. “That kiss flare up some feelings, did it?”
The next room was darker than the last. They proceeded carefully and cautiously, Persephone immediately grabbing the elbows of Hermione and Ron, who were on either of her sides. When they stepped into it, the room was basked in light, making them jump.
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
They cursed, backing off immediately but this only seemed to excite them further, “A siren…”
Before she could answer, someone called her name, “Lily! Lily, there you are!”
“Brilliant!” She positively beamed and he reacted appropriately.
, since we’re already
“You know him?”
“So…so am I going to…?”
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop her," he said.
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
Amanda sighed, looking absolutely exhausted, “Renee.”
For now they're bare and full of air,
"Vol—sorry—You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"
“You seriously mean it?” He sounded so hopeful that she couldn’t help smiling.
She snickered, “Actually, that’s a long story—I want to follow him so hurry up!”
skilled at Transfiguration to have a child that is one…wow….” She blinked and Persephone shrugged.
You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
He stared at her, narrowing his eyes and then grinned, “And you didn’t wake me?”
She closed her eyes—what did Percy do in the
Diana was a much preferred babysitter because she didn’t act like a babysitter. She acted like she liked Persephone, like they were friends. Diana often taught her different hairstyles and let her read whatever she wanted—Percy Jackson usually—and they often times watched old movies too. Diana always laid out all sorts of snacks and took her to the library and even the theatres. It was so much fun, though she had to act like she hated it there because the Dursleys would never let her come again if they thought she’d had a good time.
Amongst the dense, dark trees, she could make out the shape of something…something strange. And then, someone had tackled her to the nearest tree, keeping her pressed up by the shoulders.
At that very moment, something hit the other side of the car with the force of a charging bull, causing Persephone to fall. The force had sent the car straight onto Persephone’s legs and she had the breath knocked out of her as she would have otherwise been screaming her lungs out.
“Dance program?” Her interest was piqued, “What dance program?”
By the time it was over, the sun was up and they had thirty minutes until breakfast. Persephone showered and got dressed, sore and tired, but quite awake. She was happy for the morning practices—they helped her concentrate in classes. Oliver bombarded Persephone with reflex exercises in the halls when she least expected it. She had on more than one account dropped all her books at the very sight of Oliver Wood, expecting him to throw something at him.
"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop
It was an intricate map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Amazed, Persephone bent over it and found the Gryffindor common room, where the names, ‘George Weasley, Fred Weasley and Persephone Potter,’ were in a circle.
“Obviously—we’re not stupid.” Ron said. “I have questions though.”
“Oh, yes.”
Diana smiled a brilliant smile, “We were in Hogwarts at the same time, though we were not in the same year.”
The weather was very cold on November first.
She blinked—this wasn’t the time for a family story. "So Voldemort—he’s on your side? How? I thought he was dead—or barely alive.”
Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing—or caring.
“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” Persephone noted, raising a brow.
“I was lookin’ fer a Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent,” Hagrid growled. “They’re ruinin’ the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?”
of girl.
Mrs. Weasley beamed, “Oh he is marvelous, and he really does know his household pests, all right. It’s a wonderful book…”
“Right,” Persephone got out of the car, disoriented. They were in front of what was called, ‘Hog’s Head Inn,’ written on a sign, advertising with a wild board’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it. Next to the door hung a sign, declaring that the sale of unicorn blood was forbidden, and that anyone who asked about it would be thrown out. “And…has George or Fred ever mentioned
The cheers were deafening, she could barely hear herself laugh in near hysterics of happiness. Persephone was keeping score, even over the yelling and she was screaming to find that Gryffindor and Slytherin were tied.
Persephone rolled her eyes, slapping his shoulder, “Don’t be dramatic.”
And then the answer was clear to her: ‘Basilisk! Of course. A basilisk would do the job nice and proper wouldn’t it…it kills people with just a glance…I don’t want to kill anyone.’
George was the one who maneuvered her. She made a grab for the cage but could only lean as so much to the lock. If she tried any further, she would hurt Hedwig. She pulled a bobby pin out of her hair and pick the lock, reaching farther to do so. She reached out, unlocking the cage and he pulled her back in and she cleared her throat and whistled.
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
“Not as good as you,” Persephone said, smiling weakly as she too let the feeling find her too. “Brilliant witch of our age…” She let her go.
"What are you doing?" Ron moaned, gray-faced.
“Ron!” She stared at him, incredulous, “We cannot fly the car! Especially not in such a crowded place! Imagine the amount of trouble your dad would get in!”
She pursed her lips, “Professor I was wondering…if you could, possibly, tell me something?”
“He looked really—weird when I told him I go by Lily, just like her.” She said briefly. They were silent for a moment as she stared at Fangs, until Hagrid said.
“You are rather brave without your goons, aren’t you?” Persephone crossed her arms, glaring at Draco. “Must I deal with you so early in the year?”
“First off, that would be slightly offensive if I weren’t white and my name wasn’t actually Black, second off, I don’t care.” He shrugged. She glanced over to him to see him looking too relaxed for her irritation.
“Hey!” George cried as Persephone stared up in shock—Goyle and Crabbe were turning their attention to the twins as they surged forward. Persephone knew in an instant what Malfoy was raising his foot for and before he could kick her, she raised her hand and palm first to the point of his foot. It froze in midair—the Slytherins around them, including Pansy, were staring at this movement.
And like that, the mood lifted. A cheerful smirk painted his lips, “Probably not today—you’re gonna be late.”
She suddenly knew better than to sip her drink—drugging people with potions seemed a subtle poison. Who said Mindi wasn’t trying to drug her into dishing all about her non-existant boyfriends? The word in her mind made her recoil in disgust—ew.
It seemed he had perceived her trigger—that being a girl was a weakness and an excuse for what she can and cannot do. Her jaw clenched in anger. “Little girl?”
Persephone gave Pansy a look.
"Oh,” She breathed, staring in amazement.
Unfortunately, Persephone could not send any thank you notes. All their letters were worrisome, which was very nice after the day she’d just had, but she could not unlock Hedwig to send a letter. She had tried lock picking and had been caught, which is why there are bars on Persephone’s window. It was devastating.
“Blimey, I’m tired,” Fred yawned hugely. “I may just go and hit the hay—”
On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. Persephone thought perhaps she ought to say something about knowing what the letters said and that she had interest (the latter was a lie, she was very interested against her will) but watching Uncle Vernon lose his mind was the best source of entertainment.
It took a lot to draw her eyes from Pansy’s and to look at McGonagall. Standing at the door was Hades, who was surveying the tension in the room and immediately drew his eyes to Persephone’s hands.
"Three up... two across…” he muttered. "Right, stand back, Sephie."
A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron’s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Persephone stared at it as Ron was stunned. Gradually, the little amount of laughter died down and the loud chatter broke out once more.
She was threading together her little speech as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk. It was a little harder to keep her thoughts together when he fixed her with a penetrating, light blue stare, “Please, what might I help you with on this fine morning?”
“Nah,” They both shook their heads, laughing.
If Quirrell was like one of those men, he would take advantage of his position and look down Persephone’s shirt, easily because of the unbuttoned first few buttons.
She carefully put the hair in a small pocket of his bag with the feather and watched him zip it shut, “The last core shouldn’t be too hard to get.”
She turned but then Fred was there too, with a whole sort of lilies. “Don’t go with that clumsy twin! You and I both know I’m the better looking one!”
“I don’t blame you, dear,” Mrs. Weasley smiled warmly down at Persephone as she filled her plate with eight or nine sausages. “You certainly did not ask for three underage, reckless boys to show up at your window in the middle of the night. Arthur and I have been worried about you, of course. We’d said only just last night that if you hadn’t written back to one of my idiot sons,” She glared at them, “We’d come get you ourselves. But honestly,” (she was now adding three fried eggs to her plate) “flying an illegal car halfway across the country—anyone could have seen you—”
"Still famous," Ron grinned at her as she waved back to Cedric Diggory.
When finally, she was banished from the kitchen, she swiftly grabbed the letter from its hiding place and tucked it under her dress as she walked out. Her heart beating against her throat so hard it made her knees weak. She started walking the perimeter of the neighborhood, watching the Durlsey’s car drive by. She waited a good few minutes before she started walking back, towards the Johnsons.
“We’ve been through this,” He put his head back down, “We steal Filch’s shackles,”
She nodded, “It didn’t feel the same though.”
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section."
“We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Lily, Wood was almost skipping when he told us." George grinned. “I have never seen him this happy, it’s like he’s been saved by his heroin.” His grinned widened when Persephone grimaced and he bumped her shoulder, "Anyway, I reckons it’s almost dinner time and we’re meeting Lee Jordan afterwards. Reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school."
“How?” She narrowed her eyes.
Persephone thought, “No…no I don’t think he’ll stop unless he is dead.”
"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
She rolled her eyes, “Time for what?”
"Where's Percy?" said their mother.
Hermione came around and folded her legs under her as she sat in front of Persephone, drawing the curtains closed. This was a ritual when the two talked privately. Persephone drew her wand, casting a quick but sufficient
“We probably lost so many house points!” Hermione gasped but she didn’t seem all that upset.
It took a few seconds to wake Fred, who immediately grinned at the prospect of sneaking out. “Do you even need to ask?”
"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully.
“Says the youngest Quidditch player in over a century,” He tossed back up to her, looking perfectly content and smiling a genuine smile again.
"This is Ron Weasley," Persephone said as she folded her legs under her to sit. Hagrid poured boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
The next day was spent staring at Pansy Parkinson as quietly as possibly. They hoped no one noticed the two straight up stalkers staring at the girl so they could nail every detail of the girl. Twice, Persephone had gone to bump into Pansy to get a close up of her face to see any freckle details. She got so many nasty stares from Pansy and even some classier threats.
“Well, simple answer, really—I don’t care for people who believe themselves above other people for the simple cause of being brought up in an entirely magical family. Truly, it’s an idiotic notion, to believe your above people—the law, even,” She said, pointedly looking at Draco’s father. “Because what does being pure-blooded prove? That you understand magic better? Because this has been proven false, as Hermione Granger is a witch brought up in an entirely non-magical family and yet is the top of our class, better than several purebloods, including you, Draco. Weren’t you marked something like, second, in our grade?” She asked somewhat mockingly. “Oh, no I forget. I’m above you as well. And I, of course, was brought up in a non-magical environment, with the added
“Not only did you forget to mention your detention but you also forget to mention it was on a full moon.” He hissed. “And by the time I find you, you’ve attacked Malfoy—I had to use three memory spells to get him to stop blubbering about a monster! You’re lucky I’m so good at them, otherwise he’d have gone straight to Dumbledore—or worse, his father. And when I asked you to wait—you don’t! What the hell!
. How could she not be a girl? “I don’t think I understand.”
They took a turn after lunch and decided to visit the reptile house, much to the disgust of Aunt Petunia. It was cool and dark in there, which Persephone told no one in particular was because most of the reptiles were cold blooded and dependent on carefully lit places when in captivity. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.
,” Ron suggested cheerfully as she mixed the product in a bowl in the boy’s bathroom in Ron’s dorm. She quickly found that the boys could not come up the girl’s dorms—George Weasley found it very funny to wait until Persephone climbed up all the way to the top step before jumping on the stairs. When a boy touched the stairs, the stairs immediately turned into a slide. She had dropped many books this way. They were charmed as such because the founder’s thought that girls were more trustworthy than the boys.
Tom answered her in her mind and she used the incantation, “Calor,” and her clothes immediately dried. When the six were dried and amused, Persephone had no doubt that this was the very highlight of her day, as she had Lockhart next. She would hate this class.
Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest,
"Mom?" she whispered, her voice hoarse. "Dad?"
crush on him. He was born in ’93, five years older than Persephone, unfortunately.
The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
"McGonagall doesn’t favor us, that’s for sure," Persephone mumbled. Just as she took a bite of her eggs on toast, the mail arrived.
She tried to swallow her nerves, “So…so you’re saying you didn’t…” She felt her anger make no sense. She wasn’t sure she was angry at all anymore, being how much she had missed him. “Oh.” She looked at him for a long time and he looked at her for just as long.
The three sat in the common room, suspiciously quiet. Nobody bothered them—no one liked Persephone anymore to bother them. She was finally at a point where she didn’t care. Hermione was skimming through her notes while Persephone kept tapping her foot, which irritated Ron. She kept playing with her necklace. They probably looked like first time drug dealers or something.
"No—no—not again, please—"
Her heart was speeding up like it was beating up against her ribs and from her ribs vibrated down her spine and through all her bones. She felt it like an electric shot through her entire body and for a moment, she thought she would pass out.
The evening was spent with Ron and Persephone discussing what they’d do with a Philosopher’s Stone of their own. Persephone opt to fund better libraries and school programs while Ron said he would fund a program to allow people of all classes to play on a Quidditch team. It wasn’t until Ron had said that that Persephone suddenly remembered about Snape and the coming match.
Ron held her back before they could follow his older brothers, “Can I talk to you for a second?”
Instead of answering, she ran at Cedric. Surprised, he fell into instinct and caught her before pulling off half a Cheshire cat lift. It wasn’t a full one as when he tossed her up into the splits, he kept both hands on her.
Ron went as red as his roots and had to be held back by Persephone from jumping him. ‘Hades’ laughed out loud, a sudden laugh that made them all jump.
"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the other twin. "Once --"
Dobby reached into the pillowcase he was wearing and pulled out a thick wad of envelopes, tied together with a leather cord. And then he pulled out a package, after package. She stared at the stack.
His face softened an inch, “You can support her by being there for her,” His voice had softened too. “You can support her by offering to help her talk through it, or by accepting her and her feelings. You can support her, first off, by apologizing.”
She nodded, just wanting to get away from him—they needed to plot and no one could plot with Snape around. “Er, sure, yes, I will graciously accept your offer, thank you so much, sir, Professor,” She nodded, smiling uncomfortably. She was thinking—Snape would believe her. “Professor, there’s something you ought to know—”
"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this...but he's in London...I'll be far away by the time he gets back...."
Professor Alison pointed her wand up to the ceiling, where the music had usually protruded from. The music wasn’t placed, nothing very categorized. It sounded jumbled to Persephone. She had all girls come to the floor and Persephone was forced to leave Hades on his own. She shrugged, smiling apologetically before going to stand by Daphne.
He raised a brow, “Alright?”
Again and again, she pounded on the glass, finding it unbreakable until finally, she placed two hands on it and screamed. And with this ear shattering scream came the mirror shattering and down fell the pieces until there was no mirror left.
"We had to, Neville, no time to explain," Persephone told him before leaning away.
“Hmph,” Pansy scoffed, “This is why we don’t allow half-bloods into pureblooded events.”
“Well, then, I don’t know if anyone could be causing such peril in a school run by Albus Dumbledore.”
“RON!?” She screeched.
She walked cautiously out of her dorm, quietly climbing down the stairs, across the dark common room and then out through the portrait hole. She did all this without tripping, thankfully and only the Fat Lady noticed anything, "Who's there?"
“You can make it on your own from here, right?” They stopped in an empty corridor near the Fat Lady’s portrait. “Don’t forget the book.”
, and you can back me up."
Only thing about the full moon was that it happened every month. This much scared her. With them not talking, she was scared she would go through the full moon alone. She was terrified, actually.
“Let’s go,” Ron’s voice came from her right, where he had been moments ago.
“Not surprising Lily knows of it,” Daphne said, shrugging, “
“Are safe,” They said together, grinning.
“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,” Mr. Malfoy said coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant—”
They strolled about the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill and she almost felt bad for Ben having to listen to her Roman mythology lessons. Truly all of their trip was her giving lessons on the roman myths but the only time she was able to really just not contain herself was when they visited the Pantheon.
“Alright, that’s enough!” George shot back. Everyone looked at him. “This is utter rubbish—she lost fifty points. Not a hundred and fifty. Just fifty. Let’s not forget that she’s the reason this team is doing so well and winning this year. Let’s not forget she earns more points in one class than any of you do in a day! And let’s not forget that without her we wouldn’t even have a chance at winning the cup. So for all of you giving her a hard time, remember that we’re supposed to be a team that we’re supposed to treat our house members like family.” He fumed, throwing his hands up.
She nodded, “Right…” She said sardonically.
The common room was quiet. There dorms were empty. Persephone gladly took her bed, the usual bed, and made sure to make Hermione take the one next to hers. She was sure Hermione would take the same bed as last year, next to her on the right. The dorm was so much cozier than her bedroom back at Privet Drive. Despite sharing it with several other girls, it was more her style than anywhere else.
“Working on it,” She narrowed her eyes. “Where are you in the other core process?”
Her voice broke and she sniffed, looking away. She shook her head, afraid of speaking.
. She should do this alone. At least, this first time.
Dobby gave her a tragic look.
He probably didn’t hear her right but she didn’t blame him. He looked very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.
Up the stairs, hanging on the wall was a grand tapestry, one seeming to depict the Malfoy family tree. For a moment, she didn’t understand why it was so large, but then she remembered the Mafloy family was one of the oldest pureblooded family in Britain.
She found some ingredients before she gave Susan some instructions on ingredients to find. She would make some sugar skulls, calaveras, while looking for some fruits. She found a picnic basket under a shelf, among about fifty others, probably for picnicking, and put the fruits in. She and Susan made sugar skulls, the ingredients appearing in cupboards as they needed them—it took them a good hour of their free time to finish. They laughed about what a mess their hair became in the heat, and packed the food into the picnic basket.
“Can I borrow this?” She asked and he nodded immediately, flushing. She smiled, and thanked him, before rushing out.
“Dragon heartstrings are most powerful, unicorn hairs most consistent and phoenix feathers the most mysterious,” The boy said with an odd tone as he passed by to reach up a shelf behind her. Mr. Ollivander held her hands up and told her to hold them limp, where he examined her cuticles. She glanced at him but he was counting out something out on the front shelf.
“Actually, I never intended to break the law,” She inserted. “I never planned on flying the car.”
And what if she did like girls? What did that mean? Could girls marry girls? What if all her friends who were girls found out and were disgusted by it? Was this normal? She knew of the two boys on Valentines but…but could girls…? All girls talked about were boys not girls—could boys like boys
One among us seven will let you move ahead,
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. As much as she loved Hedwig and would literally die for her, she had to seriously control her desire to stop and pet each cat. There were lots owls, too, hooting to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. She stroked Salem’s head without a thought.
“She’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” Mr. Weasley insisted, taking his turn in reaching into the flowerpot.
Persephone turned to open her letter and read quietly through its contents; it was just like it had been first year, with her ticket for the Hogwarts Express, a welcoming letter from Professor Minerva McGonagall and then, the list of new books she would require.
"I heavily advise you not to,” Persephone said but she too was smiling widely. They looked at each other and maybe it was the situation or maybe it was because it was a bad idea to be laughing but the girls had a hard time stifling their laughter.
Hermione didn’t even need to think about her answer, “Professor Quirrell.”
He obviously wanted to say something but was looking for the right words. Instead of speaking, he took his camera out.
“Lack of proof, I daresay—he must have thought it best to simply scare me off you,” He laughed to himself. “Wasted time, as you will die now.”
"No—no way, he wouldn’t!” Hermione insisted. “I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
“Do not be frightened!” He called out, holding the cage of pixies over the class. They matched the description of the textbook exactly, with electric blue skin and tiny, at only eight inches long, with pointed faces and shrill voices. They had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making ugly faces at people nearest to them.
Persephone and Amanda had to shift a lot but ended up being able to huddled in the corner with their sole pillow and blanket, munching on snacks. Persephone let Amanda cry for a long few minutes, nestled onto her shoulder. She didn’t know what to say but she simply kept to her side. If she wanted to talk, Persephone would listen.
“You have to promise me, you have to promise me that we will practice the dance—okay? However long it takes, okay? I don’t care how many hours or on what days or if you haven’t slept! We need to win, okay? I don’t want to lose my legs, Lavender promised me she’d give me a pedicure and I’ve never painted my nails before, okay, and I want to wear anklets and—” A sob shook her shoulders and she couldn’t breathe.
She frowned, turning, “You’d rather burn yourself alive rather than get on a broom?”
“Oh! You can use mine, if you want to!” She offered up her wand. “I’m not really getting anywhere with this anyway.”
Then, he dropped the pudding.
“That’s not true, George,” She rolled her eyes. “Men can like other men’s work too. And besides, he doesn’t seem like just a pretty face with all that he’s done. Banshees, ghouls, hags, trolls, vampires, werewolves and yetis, by the looks of it. Can you handle all that?”
He was looking over at Persephone as he spoke as Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
century and there were dungeons beneath them, according to Hades. It was more art than home.
“We will,” Fred and George in unison.
Neville blushed at being addressed.
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed."
She rolled her eyes, “Shut up.”
“Of course I’d help you! You don’t need to be so sketchy about it!” She remembered when he was helping her with her wand business and had done something very similar to this. “How can I help?”
She took her place next to Hades begrudgingly and finally Snape entered and everyone silenced at once. Persephone was mildly disappointed—and Hermione would also be, later, when she filled her in—that one aspect of the potions club was to keep the hospital wing stocked. The more advanced potions were brewed by Madame Pomfrey but the more common ones were brewed by this small team of Slytherins and one Gryffindor.
She tried to listen in and as she leaned forward, suddenly a hand wrapped around her and covered her mouth. She reacted immediately, jumping away from the person and nearly off the branch but then she saw Ben hanging upside down over her on the branch above her. He steadied her, widening his eyes in warning, lifting his other hand to make a shushing face. She slapped his hand away and he mouthed an ‘ow’. She motioned to him with her hands in confusion and he pointed down to the people she was spying on, as if telling her to shut up and listen.
‘I don’t even remember reading those…’
“Tired?” He was suddenly sat at the couch, staring at her with brilliant golden eyes. She jumped up and yelped.
"What's up?" said Hagrid.
Hermione, as usual, had all the right answers and was rewarded with ten points and a wink. Persephone grimaced while Hermione blushed a deep red.
“Ah, there is no such thing as privacy when you are a celebrity, I shall tell you that,” He told her, sighing rather dramatically. “Of course, nothing you ought to worry about—I don’t encourage this little fame snowball you’ve started for yourself. It’s terrible for publicity.”
“I need to tell you two something and it can’t wait,” Persephone told them. Despite the weird encounter she’d had Ben, she had not forgotten a vry important revelation of the day.
“Well, I’ll—I’ll see you laaater…” Susan said and Persephone nodded awkwardly.
His eyes on the fire in her palm, he stared at her then, narrowing his eyes, “Only a foolish girl would believe that the greatest wizards of the time would have not cast fire-resistant spells on their portraits.”
Without her glasses, it looked like a girl. She didn’t wear her glasses often, only after classes. She’d forgotten them this morning and regretted it—she couldn’t tell what the person was.
“Oi! That’s my brother!” Before launching three balls at once, hitting two second year girls. Fred remained flat against the ground, crawling, until he was hit.
She went through the lines, reading each name and piece of information, finding some familiar pureblood names here and there. Then she found the name Hardwin Potter. He was the eldest son of seven children. His father was Linfred of Stinchcombe, nicknamed the Potterer. He was the first Potter. He got his nickname from his pioneer potioneering, having invented many medicinal potions, including Skele-Gro and Pepperup Potion.
She cut him off, “You can help, you’re my friend, so please, help?”
She felt shame now instead of anger at his choice of words and she looked down, “I just…”
She was so pleased with herself, she barely gave any thought to Hermione’s sour frown directed at her. Lavender high fived her and Persephone promised to fix her hair the way Lavender had complimented hers the next morning in payment.
“Look, I know it’s confusing but if you let me, I want to help.” He told her and for a moment, his dark and sardonic mask came off. He looked genuine, like he had the day of the water flood with the twins. “No one should go through this alone.”
He gave up first, “Sure you aren’t Ravenclaw?”
Before anyone could say anything, someone else’s voice echoed into the very crowded compartment, “Hey, you found my cat!” And then the boy from earlier slipped into the compartment gracefully, though knocking Malfoy down ungracefully, and smiled down at Persephone. “Oh geez, that’s twice now.”
When he first dropped by and they spoke as Mrs. Weasley and his mum arranged things right, he looked as he always did—smiling and handsome.
Hedwig unsurprisingly hadn't brought Persephone any letters or packages. She flew in enough times right onto her shoulder and let Persephone feed her some bread that Persephone would always bring her hair off her shoulders, or bring all her hair onto one shoulder if it weren’t up, just to give her space to come down on. She would nibble onto her ear affectionately before flying off and away to the owlery with the other school owls.
She suddenly realized something drastic had changed in the room, “Hades.”
"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
“Privileges!?” She raised a brow. “Not everyone has been orphaned like I have been. Not everyone has literally had their parents murdered and then had the same man try and murder them only to be murdered instead by god knows what.” She fumed. “Just because we haven’t suffered through the same things doesn’t mean we haven’t suffered.”
“If any of us will end up prefect, it’ll be you,” Fred told her, “Honestly, I have no idea how we’re friends with you being
“Yes and yes.” He said. “Anyone feel like a swim?”
"Are you serious, Professor?"
“Alright,” Armand, who was a very quiet guy, suddenly spoke to her, “I need you to not lost or gain any weight until after the play. The material I’m using doesn’t rip but also cannot be readjusted. Do not, under any circumstances, grow, understand?” He looked very serious and she had no other instinct but to nod. “I need both you and your understudy to be the same measurements.”
As was usual, even ten years of being here would not cause them to miss her. She was surprised Dudley had not taken over her room while she’d been gone.
Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Persephone and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
“Answer the question!” Persephone insisted. “Is he not?”
“Congratulations, Lils,” George said, jumping over the back of the couch she was sitting on and falling next to her upside down, a goofy smile playing on his lips.
Could there be anything worse than Lockhart on her first day?
What house do you believe Ben is most likely in?
He blushed furiously, “The pear!” He nodded his head towards the wall without looking at it. “I can’t tell you anymore—and I need to go find my cat, sorry,” And with the he took off.
Susan laughed, “Course not! Come on!”
There was a tap on the dark window.
"Course! Just got yer key right here,” He patted his jacket as he held it up. “First stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold—an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither. An’ ye’ll have to repeat the rest of whatcha said, there,”
She paled. That was what Dumbledore meant when he said the Mirror would be moved—it was moved here.
The incantation appeared in her mind almost immediately and she smiled to herself—it was so simple!
That didn’t really clear things up but she getting cold and she didn’t care. “Alright sure.”
"The entire school is raving on about it but no one knows what happened,” Ron said. “
“Because,” She said. “Also—Slytherin? Really?”
Some things to keep in mind: a lot of things won't make sense, and things will be very odd, but that's done on purpose because this is told from Persephone's point of view, and things don't make too much sense to her right now. She's also different in her narration; she calls Ben 'Hades' and she's very arrogant, in ways only a young Tom Riddle would be.
When the clapping for the Hat died down and Professor McGonagall announced the beginning, the Sorting began. Fred and George caused a lot of ruckus, yelling out their predictions for the kid under the hat. When they got it wrong, they started booing. It was very comical.
He said, “My biological mother’s sister, yes.”
They just looked at her, smiling with such adoration, she’d never felt, or even seen, such adoration. Anywhere.
She raised her hand, “Wait.” She told him. “Alright, Dobby, I understand that there is…danger at Hogwarts. So, could you possibly…bring us to Hogsmeade?”
She dug around her trunk before she found her bathing suits and chose the one piece that hugged her body more comfortably. It was a deep V-necked bathing suit, with blue stripes over a white going down and it was almost backless. She was examining herself in the mirror, turning from side to side when Gary walked in, looking for Ron. She didn’t notice him at first, as he was silent.
The plan was to stay in Venice for three days, three days in Bologna, five days in Florence and a week in Rome. It was a relatively short trip, not meant to carry out for too long. Nonetheless, Diana packed as though it were a summer long trip. Diana requested her opinion on dresses that she tried on and turned for different angles while Persephone sat on the floor, sipping water, giving thoughtful opinions on each dress.
"Don't make me feel worse," Persephone. She told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin's.
“If you must know, Elizabeth Cooper,” He flipped the camera off, “I did have some inquiries to make to you.”
“Welcome back to our returning dancers,” Sinistra began, “And a welcome to our first timers! To put it rather blunt, the people you see around you will be the people you see for the rest of the year. There are no such things as quitters in dance, as anyone who has thoughts of quitting should have thought about it before joining the class.”
…she found, all the way in the back, a beautiful, incredibly adorable tiny, black kitten. He was all alone in his cage, meowing loudly for attention. The store clerk informed Persephone that someone had just adopted her two sisters.
It was a relaxing atmosphere—she’d been in this room for the first time this time last year, ready to be sorted into her own house. Up in front of the tables, on an old, wooden stool, sat the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat.
Yesterday had been the messiest day at Hogwarts yet, and Persephone recounted the craziest part of it all to Ron; she explained about her theory about the package Hagrid had taken for Dumbledore. She was sure it was under the trapdoor, guarded by Cerberus. (She decided that they would name the dog Cerberus for now).
It took a moment for the chatter to die down with a sharp ‘Silence!’ from Professor Alison. Sinistra continued, “For those who are unaware, La Revolution de Danse was first established during the end of the Renaissance as a way to solidify bonds between schools at a time that it was very dangerous to be a witch and wizard. It is a two year competition, the first year having five schools and the second having only three, as two will lose in the first two rounds year. There will be three acts this year, all of which are going to be tasked a theme.”
“Shrill shriek,” He pointed out with a smile. “Who’s to say I can’t pick a hair from your head and have it work as a third core, hm?”
“Siren?” she sputtered, “Like mermaid?”
Persephone watched in disgusted amazement as the egg cracked open in half and something flopped onto the table with an icky splat.
“I wouldn’t worry too much ‘bout it, Effie, that Snape doesn’t like too many students anyway,” She nodded. “How’s yer brother Charlie? I liked him a lot—great with animals, he was.” He told Ron.
“You know we don’t just do ballet right?” Persephone raised a brow.
It seemed all the founder’s breath seemed to stop and they all looked at Persephone expectantly.
She snorted, “Right, okay—so I’m the first person you’ve spent a full moon with.” He shrugged and then nodded, still looking outside. “I feel honored.” She yawned.
You'll make your real friends,
The very first birthday cake she’d ever gotten made her throat tighten and she felt like not even Poseidon could top this. She looked up and smiled, or grimaced, and thanked him. The giant seemed genuinely pleased with her reaction but offered no introductions, so she quietly asked, "Who are you?"
“You need to do the same to block a jinx, ‘Mione.” Persephone pointed out.
century, designed by Giorgio Vasari. She spent a good portion of the three hours they spent there being lost at how breathtaking it all was.
“You thought…it would be…funny,” He said coldly, staring down at her. Ron didn’t dare contradict her. “I have to assert that a considerable amount of damage has been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,” Snape continued.
, which is what I
“He is a mere nephew, Borgin, no addition,” Mr. Malfoy said as coldly as ever. A nephew? Should she feel bad for whoever was related to Draco Malfoy or should she feel just as disgusted by them? “Now, perhaps we can return to my list. I am in something of a hurry, Borgin.”
She raised a brow to him, "…Er, no, you’re white…” She said, frowning in confusion. “My dad is Spanish, I think.” She felt herself building up unease. Were there prejudices against the ethnicities of the students here too?
Together, they stared at the candles and sugar skulls, and Persephone brought her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them.
“How do you do that!?” She cried out, looking around.
Ron tried to answer but Snape interrupted him.
She snapped her head to him, staring him down, “What?”
“Listen here, Sephie—you got to be more careful then that. There’s people out there who done terrible things in the past to yer sort, and will do it again if they find out yer one.” He coughed. “People will not be all warmed up to you when they find out what yeh are—I should know.”
Susan did match with her, as she had been standing right behind her to give her a Valentines gift. After the original fit of laughter, she and Susan washed off and shared some chocolate that Susan was to give her. “Those Weasley twins are quite the pranksters, aren’t they?” Susan asked.
“Seph,” Hades was panicking now, unsure of what to do when he put his hand on Persephone’s shoulder.
“Sorry!” She gasped, “We must be miles under the school—oh! Sorry!” She said as she tried to roll off Persephone, but she elbowed her in the jaw.
“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Persephone were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.
“I was wondering if you taught my mother.” She said without stuttering once. He froze and she winced. Maybe this wasn’t the best way to do this…
While Hermione unloaded her books and such onto her desk, Persephone unpacked her trunk. She organized the dresser into categories and found all her clothes fit snugly. It was probably magic, she smiled to herself. She quickly unfolded the little bed for her kitten by her bed, though she was sure she would sleep with Persephone until she was big—then she took her carefully out, welcoming the purs she gifted Persephone with.
“Not great—for whatever reason, you have a very recognizable face, being famous and all.”
Flitwick considered her for a moment, before saying, “Ms. Potter, what are your opinions on theatre?”
"Neville," Ron exploded, "get away from that hole and don't be an idiot --"
“I—I don’t know,” Persephone answered truthfully—she wasn’t dancing to become a professional ballerina. At least, she didn’t think she was…
However, Hermione was the one picked to answer this, “Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative. It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.” Hermione had a talent of memorizing textbook passages to recite. She was sure she dreamt in textbook passages.
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.
"Mom—geroff" He wriggled free.
“What?”
Werewolf.
“Sorry,” Persephone muttered.
“W-what?” Hermione asked.
"I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air again. "Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you." And he scooted off.
"Don't talk to me for a moment," Ron said when Persephone took a seat next to him, "I need to concen—" He caught sight of her face. "What's the matter with you? You look terrible."
They entered what could only be Snape’s office. The fireplace was dark and empty. An empty cauldron was stood in front of the fire place and there were shelves lining the walls, with large jars filled with a dark liquid that had unfamiliar things floating in them. Snape closed the door and turned to look at them.
"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said.
“Well, you did earn the most amount of points, didn’t you?” He countered thoughtfully. She blushed.
He raised his hand and snapped his fingers and then suddenly, with a crack like a whip, and for a long moment, she felt as though she was air. The next second, she was sitting in the car still, but in a completely different setting.
Persephone tried her best to talk with Gary, who usually froze up whenever she was around.
He held his hand up, “Wait!” He was silent for a moment and just as Persephone was going to ask what he was listening for, he nodded, “They’re coming. Hurry up.”
Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!’” He ruffled his son’s blonde hair.
When Persephone finished, she stood and had started to cross the stage to grab her book-bag. Quirrell was speaking with Flitwick on the other side and she had thought curiously of what they could be talking of. She had reached the end of the stage and grabbed her bag and turned around.
“Your headband is very pretty.”
He shrugged, “It’s a maternal gene.”
“You become Pansy Parkinson and sneak into Malfoy’s dorm to find the letter. If you’re caught, you can say that you were leaving a love note or something. She clings to him like the type to do something like that.”
“Don’t call me ‘red’” She snapped. “And work?”
With the sound of her name, another twinge of guilt—why was she feeling this way!?
She stood, flipping her hair over to put in a high pony tail before taking a deep breath and stretching down to touch her toes. Then she slid into the splits and one of the girls cried out. Persephone looked up in alarm to find two of the girls staring at her in shock, “What?!”
“You’re acting rather brave for someone who doesn’t know how to throw a proper punch,” Someone spoke before she could.
“Would you—”
"NO!” The girls shouted immediately.
“Were we supposed to wear house colors?” She asked, suddenly cold.
Madam Prince glared at each student carefully, checking for any guilty faces to see if anyone had damaged her books. It took so long that when she was done, she bid Cedric a wave that he did not see and she flushed and left.
“You’re just going to let him bake a cake and bring it to the trophy room at midnight?” Ron asked, eating some steak.
Persephone piped up, “I could go to the library.”
“Have you no sense of morality?” She hissed. “And what hex, Malfoy? We haven’t learned any hexes!”
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Persephone made a sharp turn without wavering. A few people below were clapping.
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
She frowned, “What? No! Why? Does he think I’m mad at him?”
His eyes widened, “What?”
"Just tell us what to do,” Persephone interrupted. “You’re king in this.”
"Friendly of them,” She murmured. She’d thought maybe Ron would like it—he probably never had seen non-magical money. Or paper money, period.
She didn’t get a chance to tell Ron but when Potions ended, she dragged him down the corridor, to where the bathroom was. He was embarrassed when she pulled him in, but she promised it would be worth it. She opened the faucet and reached her hand out, waiting. The water did nothing.
"Taking Dudley to the hospital," She said, looking away from Persephone in the low, lamp light. "We must get that tail removed before school begins."
She pleaded long and hard and then, finally, she must have cracked her,
Of what awaits the sin of greed,
She returned a mocking smile, “No thank you—there has to be something better. If I’m a siren, I need water.”
She held it in her hand without moving, surprised to find it still in her possession. Then she noticed the writing on it. Squinting, she read, ‘
He followed her league and she took his hand and let him drag her towards him. She did a bridge over him where her then push her legs with his own so she was on her feet. His hands snapped to her hips and he pushed her up into an aerial splits jump, her hands on his shoulders.
"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?—It likes the dark and the damp so…Agh!” Hermione threw her hands up. Persephone struggled for a moment, trying to normalize her breathing and found her skin had lit on fire—literally. Something started smoking under her and she screamed into the plant, wondering how the hell she missed the part of the lesson on Devil’s Snare that taught them that it spontaneously burst into flames.
Persephone shook her head.
More to the extent of his manipulations will be revealed slowly, only to the reader, and not much to Persephone.
“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” Ron snapped, sitting up properly once more. Why were they always bickering?
Maybe.
"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said stiffly, like it was not her idea and that she was against it. “And you have another visitor.”
full of myself? As if you—”
She took the wand and gave it just a swish when he snatched it back quickly. The boy handed him a box, telling him, “Ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.” She quickly realized what she had found confusion about his voice—it was American.
From Susan, she opened the paper carefully, afraid she might damage what was inside. It was a strange shape and only when it was uncovered did she realize why—it was a set of books on potions. It was written in Latin and looked to belong to the Restricted Section of the library. She smiled to herself—Susan was
She thought several things over and ended up figuring some stuff out that was completely useless since she had vowed not to lurk anymore in things unrelated to school.
It was so not as easy as Professor Sprout had made it look. The stupid Mandrakes hated coming out of their pots but then they hated going into the bigger ones too—they were frustrating to deal with. They kicked, flailed their tiny sharp fists and gnashed their teeth, squirming, trying to get away from Persephone. One particularly fat one was very stubborn, trying to climb up her arm rather than be shoved into the pot.
“You slept where now?”
“Who fancies Lily?” George asked, sliding in to sit next to Persephone
“There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at midnight. In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.
It was Malfoy—he seemed interested in what they were talking about and was probably still listening. She dragged them away to Herbology.
‘I hate thinking about it. I mean, I’m famous for something I don’t even remember doing, you know?’ She sighed, ‘No offense but I’m starving.’
She ignored her compartment mate’s stare and tipped the snacks onto the seat next to her, before curling up against the window with the book—she knew enough Spanish to make some connections between some words, why not start learning Italian?—and bitting into what was a pumpkin pasty.
Nearly the entire school was out to enjoy the snow. She spotted Hermione teaching Ron how to skate properly, a very amusing thing to watch as Ron was so tall and Hermione was not. Hagrid, too, pulled a sled along across the ice with Fangs on it, who was enjoying seeing so many students. Persephone offered Susan a warming charm as it started getting colder and just as they decided to go back inside, they were joined by Daphne Greengrass.
Professor Sinistra was the Astronomy professor and one of three dance teachers. Professor Berry and Professor Alison were the other two and she knew very well from second-hand accounts how strict they were. Standing with them were strange women Persephone had never seen before.
He coughed, “I’m not here with them.”
Persephone had a really good feeling when she won the fifth round and there were only five girls left. Pansy, Daphne and Persephone were amongst them, to no one’s surprise. Cho Chang was another girl, no surprise there either. Lydia, a sixth year from Hufflepuff house, was the fifth.
It was George. He looked guilty, his shoulders slumped forward, “Hey.”
“Who are you?”
She reached her hand out, feeling something pulling at her and tugging, the feeling emitting from the water, like she was a part of it, only to be rained back in. Persephone’s red hair began to shine a silver blonde, her nails sharpening and her teeth becoming lethal, her eyes becoming sharper and clearer when someone called her name, “Hey!”
"Liar…liar…”
She took a step towards it, to look into it and almost immediately spun around in a new settled panic.
“Funny.”
Surprised, she forgot about her original intent. “Oh?” He seemed too old to be as young as her mother was.
Dobby answered guiltily, “Miss must not go back to Hogwarts!”
“Oh?” Another, more feminine voice asked. “She could just as fairly be my own descendant.” This voice came from a portrait of a round and plum woman with fair strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes, adorned in a yellow robe piece with brown under robes.
Around four o’clock, Aunt Petunia gestured for her to come in and ordered her to take a shower. “Walk on the newspaper! Take a shower, quickly, and shave your legs, I want no ‘buts’, girls are not to have any hairy legs, now go!”
"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor—what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too—”
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Persephone needed a haircut. While aunt Petunia was mostly in charge of how Persephone looked, she must have gotten hundreds of haircuts at Uncle Vernon’s command. In his mind, he thought a haircut to the nape of her neck would make the messy curls vanish.
Hades leaned against the wall she was sitting up on, resting his head on her knee, “Could you be a little more specific?”
She looked at Ron and said, “I know.” She felt like she was deep underwater and her friends’ voices were faraway, up above the surface.
Persephone, whose eyes had watered and stung, did not understand why this was going splendidly but opened her eyes. He had placed seeds all along the desk. She looked up at him—what the hell was going on?
Deciding to give up, she blew. The seeds moved with her breath. Not one ‘withstood to be her wand wood’. She blew all them and then she noticed one not moving. She blew once more—another two withstood as well.
She liked to think of herself like Percy Jackson. Maybe
Each of them grabbed a broomstick and kicked off. Persephone immediately felt like her instincts had taken over and her built-in seeker inclination to examine the keys ten at a time took over. It was impossible to catch it, as proven by Ron and Hermione, who flew a few laps.
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent, and she barely took up one.
Thunder rolled above, followed closely by lightning and for half a horrifying moment, his black eyes became golden under the light, like how cat’s eyes flash under flash photography. She jumped back, surprised but quickly found he had taken a step forward, “Are you wearing contacts?”
He seemed at a loss of words.
They stared at each other for a long time and shook their heads. Then they looked to her, “Prepared for what?”
“What’s wrong, Lily?” Hermione asked.
“Magic-stealers—no, that’s—” Persephone tried but the girl had grabbed her hand and pulled her in, shoving her onto a seat.
“You only think I’m popular because you have no friends,” She shot back.
Persephone stood up, brandishing her wand, “IMMOBULUS!”
They left the castle together, crossing the vegetable patch and headed towards the greenhouses, where the magical plants were grown and kept. They met with the rest of the class, who were all crowded by the greenhouses. Persephone greeted Susan with a kiss on both cheeks and Hannah the same. They chatted on their schedules, complaining together on having potions with the Slytherins again. Persephone adored Potions, but being put with Draco Malfoy’s group of Slytherins was not her favorite.
"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the girl."
“I want to go with him,” Persephone said immediately. She wanted to be alone with the blonde haired boy, only to have him to herself—dead or alive, she didn’t care.
“Oh, thanks,” She smiled. “It was a team effort,” She laughed.
"We won! You won! We won!" Ron shouted upon seeing Persephone. "And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all right—talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens."
Okay, bear with me. This chapter is all over the place but it sticks to the original plot with some tweeks. Also, where do you guys hope I go with the wand situation? I'd love to hear your ideas! Comment down bellow!
“I should warn you everything will probably be cursed or something,” He said, rubbing his shoulders. “I’m fine, I think. Doesn’t feel poisonous—”
She cleared her throat, “I mean, that’s the name you’re going with now?”
“Avenge me!” He cried dramatically.
She crossed her arms, “Well, I’ve never grown a tail so it doesn’t matter!” She exclaimed and then looked around.
“Oh, it’s you,” Ron said as he and Hermione fought their way over to Persephone. “Bet you’re surprised to see Lily here, eh?”
The man who had spoken was tall and thin, with a great deal of long, stringy grey hair and beard. He was wearing dirty lensed spectacles and had on casual attire, and an apron. He leaned back against the bar, looking at them. Not in suspicion or interest, but like a barman did in the movies.
They were trapped.
How absolutely stupid!
“PERSEPHONE!” Hermione screamed and it caught Persephone off guard to hear someone close to her call her Persephone. It caught her off guard enough for her mind to blank in surprise to find that the fire wasn’t from the plant but from her.
Persephone shook her head, “I…Is it possible you just don’t…I don’t know, you’re just a tomboy? That you don’t like things that are usually feminine?”
“Do you think I’d make a good Slytherin?” She asked randomly.
consisted of reading through all her new textbooks and trying to get an idea of what to expect. She was not looking forward to DADA but then again, she never had. There had been several occasions where George, Fred and Ron complained that she was on break and shouldn’t be working but she liked herself to be occupied—she had felt different since going to Diagon Alley and could only feel somewhat herself when she was doing schoolwork.
“Uh, pardon
“What you just had, do you know what it’s called?”
Persephone was not allowed any visitors, this much she learned when she asked Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, a nice but very strict woman. She was not allowed to see anyone who passed by to see her—not Daphne, not Susan, not the twins and most definitely not Ron and Hermione.
Slowly, with close inspection of the faces of the other people, she came to see that some of them had green eyes too, and black hair, and olive skin. She couldn’t help the tingling sensation that spread through her body as she looked at her family for the very first time, couldn’t help the twitch of her lips in absolute wonder.
Persephone took a deep breath, trying to settle her thoughts, “Alright, we need to be creative. There must be another way to get to school—there are no wrong answers.”
“So…you’re a siren?” Ron asked. “Like you have a tail if you touch water?”
“You’re definitely his favorite student,” He tapped his finger against the spine of the book. “If we’re done arguing, I’ve got a good list of stuff we should go through.” She waited and he coughed, “From what I’ve read, sirens are closely related to banshees and veelas because originally, sirens were half mortal, half-bird—”
She stared after him and then turned to stare up at his goon squad. Using her index and middle finger, she swatted them both to opposite sides and they crashed to the floor. She pushed herself up, and turned to face the gawking students of Slytherin, “Anyone else?”
"Won it," Hagrid said. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
There was something glinting in Salazar Slytherin’s dark eyes and then he said, “Such a prize…”
"SHHHH!" Hagrid urged them once more again. "Listen—come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh --"
When Saturday morning came, Persephone woke up to the twins standing over her.
For a moment, she wondered if she could make it move without her wand, but thought against it. The whole point of school is to use her magic through a wand. But still—the spell surely did not have such a strict limit of just going
Persephone carefully folded her legs under her on the bed, as not to disrupt the perfectly made bed and glanced around. It was so…cozy. She looked back at Ron, who was watching almost sheepishly.
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Persephone found it awkward when she said quietly, “Lily, sir.”
When she was in her dorm, with the drapes closed in around her bed and salem purring at the foot of the bed, closed her eyes and closed her palm. It darkened for a moment and then when she opened her eyes, a warm glow emitted from her hand.
Rubeus Hagrid fell back down on the sofa, which caused each side of the couch lift off the ground, and the cough sagged under his weight. He started to pile things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. She glanced at her aunt to see her scolding in disgust.
Quirrell finally showed a sliver of emotion—fear flittered across his face. “He is but once I deliver the stone to him, he will be restored once more….he is a great wizard, even in the state he is in…”
didn’t fly the car.” Fred smiled, though his eyes were closed.
She’d wandered to the curly haired products afterwards, trying out her new glasses. Everything was…so
She came upon a wooden door, one that creaked loudly when she pushed it open. She came upon a round room made of stone with shelves carved into the stone walls. It looked ancient, with cobwebs covering most corners and a circular candle holder above her head. As she stepped in, a fire burst in the hearth and illuminated the room with a warm glow.
