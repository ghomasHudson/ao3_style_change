Draco can only nod his head and then the tears break free. He covers his face with his hands and tries to roll away from his mother. Narcissa won’t let him. She puts her arms around Draco and pulls him in a sitting position. Then she lets him rest against her chest. In the same way, Draco had comforted Harry from time to time in the past year.
‘I’ve never known them, so I don’t miss them,’ Malfoy writes. He bites on his bottom lip again. Harry finds it cute when Malfoy does that. It causes all these weird feelings inside Harry’s stomach that Harry doesn’t know what to do with.
But enough heavy stuff and talks about dead parents. I need to tell you about Hermione and her obsession with house-elves rights. She has gotten all upset about the house-elves. When she found out that they work without getting paid, or getting sick leave and pensions, she stopped eating for a while. She said it was slave labour. Draco dismissed her at first, said she shouldn’t be so silly and so Muggle-born (I’m so proud that he never slips up anymore or even has to think about it, but just says Muggle-born instead of Mudblood as he used to). I told him that I get why Hermione is upset, that I can see why it might not be fair on the elves that we use them like that. Draco said that they liked it, that it was their place. I throw back at him that I pretended to like it when my aunt and uncle used me as their slave, just to make sure they didn’t find another reason to hate me. That shut Draco up and we had a long talk about how Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia used to treat me. Draco still thinks that is different from the situation with the elves, but he at least doesn’t dis Hermione anymore when she starts with her S.P.E.W. talk.
We have a plan. Malfoy is going to teach me some spells that will help me defend myself when they attack me again and some spells I can use to get back at them. I’m not sure about attacking them, but Malfoy says I need to show them that I will stick up for myself, that it is the only way to make them stop. And maybe he’s right, so I will learn the jinxes and see if I’ll use them when the time is there.
“You sure you will survive without your mum’s cooking?” Harry asks. It’s the one thing Ron always brags about, how good a cook his mum is and how amazing her Christmas dinner is. He must truly be in love with Hermione to let that pass him by.
The only problem is that the traps are always empty. Even regular rats don’t seem to get trapped in them.
Harry grabs one of Neville’s arms and tries to pull him back towards the benches. Neville holds his ground and tries to get free.
I entered at the same time as Cedric and we both went into a different direction when we reached the first fork in the maze. I wish now that this was the last time I saw him, that we hadn’t reached the cup at the same time and he wouldn’t have come with me to that graveyard. He might still be alive if that was the case. I still can’t believe he’s dead. It’s surreal. He was only sixteen.
“Sorry, daddy,” Teddy grovels. “But are you okay? You look very pale.” Teddy moves further into the room and closes the door behind him. The bed dips as the boy sits down next to Draco and puts his hand on Draco’s forehead. “You don’t feel warm,” he informs Draco.
All his life Draco had heard his mother tell him of the rooms in the Manor he wasn’t supposed to go. They were down the stairs on the right side. When Draco had been a little boy, he had sneaked down there on his socks. He had taken off his shoes to make sure he wouldn’t make a sound and alert his father of his presence. Draco had stared through a crack in the door as he watched his father sweat above a cauldron admitting green and black smoke. His father had taken a big spoon and walked out of sight. Moments later the room was filled with screams of a woman and Draco had run back up the stairs.
And then after lunch, at the start of our Herbology class, Professor Lockhart hold me back to have a word with me. He gave me a speech about how I shouldn’t let the thirst for fame go to my head or something. He thought I flew the car to school to get attention and publicity and that it was all his fault because he helped me make front page news with his book signing. I tried to correct him, but he wouldn’t listen.
As soon as the teachers had left the Broomstick, both Hermione and Draco popped their heads under the table. I was already crying and Draco took my arm and guided me outside, along the road until we reached a small park. He walked me in and sat me down on a little bench. He pulled a coat over me and a scarf around my neck and then just pulled me close to him. He kept telling me that it was okay, that everything will be okay. I think he even said other things, but I had a hard time listening to him. My mind was spinning. Why had nobody ever told me? Why had Hagrid, the headmaster, Mr and Mrs Tonks, Draco’s mother or even the minister never told me that you had died because your best friend had betrayed you?
Oh, I also made Hagrid cry. He came to visit me while I was still in the hospital wing after everything that had happened with Professor Quirrell and Voldemort. He thought it was all his fault because he had told the evil git (his words) how to get past Fluffy. He felt horrible that I could have died, and only because he wanted that dragon egg. He promised to never drink again. I don’t think he will hold up that promise, because he likes to drink once in a while. But at that moment I was shocked to see Hagrid like that. He was shaking and great tears were leaking down into his beard. I comforted him, telling him that Voldemort had found out one way or another and I offered him one of the many chocolate frogs I had gotten.
We had dinner at the Leaky Cauldron. The five of us ate our way through five delicious courses. Draco’s mother was a bit hesitant to eat there, but Mrs Tonks promised her it was good food and that it was nice to not have to think about which fork to use. After dinner, we were all full and sleepy. Hermione her parents came to pick her up and the rest of used the floo to get back home. Draco is staying with at the moment. His father is off on some business trip and won’t notice that he’s not at home. His mother is also here at the Tonks. I think she really loves hanging out with her sister.
Harry shakes his head. “You know what it was like for Uncle Sirius when he came out. His family kicked him out. Draco comes from the same family. He won’t be okay with me being gay. And then to add that I’m head over heels for him. I can’t tell him.”
After the Halloween feast, which was great and a lot of fun, I just wanted to crawl into bed with Draco and kiss all my worries away. But we had hardly brushed our teeth when we were all ordered to go back to the Great Hall. When we arrived there, Hermione made her way over to us and told us that The Fat Lady, the portrait that guarded the Gryffindor dormitories had vanished and that her portrait had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor. According to Peeves it had been Sirius Black trying to get into Gryffindor Tower.
“Yeah, that sounds nice,” Draco answers. Harry pulls him in close and hugs him. The hug lasts a little longer than usual, and when Harry moves away, he gives Draco a soft kiss on his cheek.
Draco is now giving me a weird look, he doesn’t think Sirius being impressed with my flying is important. He’s still upset that Black told him that I could never date a Malfoy. It seems Black knows Draco’s father from his school days too and they weren’t friends.
And then Harry says Draco’s name. Draco has to swallow away a lump in his throat and then nods. He sits down in the chair next to Hermione’s bed and takes little Rose from her arms. Her eyes are brown, the same colour as Hermione. Some small tufts of red hair sit on her head, and she looks so peaceful. All sounds around Draco seem to disappear while he watches the tiny baby in his hands. Draco’s vision starts to blur, and he thinks his arms begin to shake. It isn’t until a large tear falls onto Rose and she gives a single cry that Draco notices he’s crying.
“Both, mostly the latter,” Neville says. He looks towards the lake. The grass around it is crowded with students. Most of them with books on their laps, busy studying for the upcoming exams.
“It’s bad that you need help defeating a girl and a Slytherin,” Neville says as he grabs some more snow. A snowball hits Draco straight in the face. He sputters and looks horrified. And then he laughs. His entire face lights up and even without any sound, it’s clear he loves this day. Then he spots Harry staring at him and throws his snowball at him instead of Neville. Only Harry’s reflexes are quick enough and he dodges the ball. Then he grabs some snow and joins his friends in the snow fight.
“It’s okay, Draco. We don’t both need to die today,” Harry says. Draco shakes his head and tightens his grip on Potter’s arm. He won’t let go. He can’t let go. It will be the end of everything.
Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head. “Not your fault, Draco. You’ve done everything by the book from the moment we knew. This is not on you.”
“Is he dead?” Draco repeats. A little louder this time. He can deal with all the hateful words, take all of them. As long as Harry is still alive. That is all that matters. Granger can believe all she wants, blame Draco for all, if only she would tell him that Harry is still with them.
I brought it up again later that day and Draco just snapped at me saying I should stop worrying about it, that we had bigger things to worry about, like Voldemort and the stone. We screamed at each other for a while and then we both went our separate ways. I hung out with Hermione after class in the library to study and then had dinner with the Gryffindor’s.
Draco looks at her and shakes his head. Harry curses next to him and mutters something about stupid hospital rules.
Hermione pulls to map to her side of the table and spots Pettigrew in seconds. “How did he get in?” she asks.
The wind rushes in Draco’s ears. His fingers slide over his broom, fighting to hold on. Only the broom is wet and Draco’s fingers threaten to slip off. The rain pours around them, drenching their robes. They get heavier by the second. It won’t be long before Draco’s fingers slip and they would both fall to the ground. If it was just Draco, he would be able to get back on his broom. Only, it isn’t just him. He’s holding the arm of Harry.
‘No. I don’t mind,’ Draco writes. ‘The world has always been silent. Sounds will only be distracting.’
“Well, thank you, Draco. I’m glad someone over the age of ten appreciates my lemonade,” Molly says. She smiles at him, and her eyes sparkle. “And I’m happy for you and Harry.”
Draco and I had a fight. About a week ago, a notice went up to announce the first Hogsmeade weekend for this coming Halloween. Draco wants to stay in the castle with me, and I told him not to be stupid and go with our friends and enjoy the day away. He thinks it won’t be any fun without me. And to be honest, I would like him to stay behind with me. I hate Halloween. I’m sure you understand why. But I don’t want to take away this experience from Draco. He deserves to have fun with Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Hermione. We didn’t agree on anything, just yelled at each other and then both sat on different sides of the common room until it was time for bed. For a little while, I was afraid Draco won’t come to sleep in my bed, but after a couple of minutes, he came anyway. He said he was sorry and that he loves me. I told him I was sorry too.
After that, we enjoyed the feast. I think it was the best evening of my life. It was better than Christmas and better than knocking out mountain trolls. I will never forget that night and the feeling of Draco’s hand in mine. And when we were back in our dormitory I showed him the book Hagrid had gotten me. We looked at all the pictures together, trying to figure out who the other people in the pictures are.
And then he gave me the best present I’ve ever gotten. It is a handsome, leather-covered book and it’s filled with wizard photographs of you, mom and dad. Hagrid had sent owls to all your old school friends asking for photos because he knew I hadn’t any. I couldn’t speak when he gave it to me. It really is the best present ever. So, I just hugged Hagrid in thanks.
"The potions, please, Draco, did you take them?" Harry’s voice cracks, and he knows he has tears in his eyes by now. He should have seen this coming. He should have dragged Draco to get help, should have listened to Blaise and let them help him. He should have made sure Draco didn’t feel like he had to fall back into oblivion again. Hermione was right that it was wrong to ignore it, to just let it happen, to let it destroy both of them in the process.
Harry and Neville bend over the table too. Their heads are close together when Neville says: “It’s been fine all year. Everyone loves Professor Lupin.”
I felt like a bad friend at that moment, because I was happy that Draco didn’t get hurt. That Ron’s wand had backfired and that Draco was okay. Isn’t that just stupid? Why would I care more about that bastard that used me last year and now even insulted my best friend? Why do I care so much about him, mom? And what do I do to make it stop?
“Yeah, sorry,” Ron says in a softer volume. He bends over the table again so they can whisper. “But a werewolf teaching? That’s asking for problems.”
I was glad when the door opened and the Headmaster told us it was time for the ceremony. Mr Ollivander was there to inspect our wands, making sure they are in good condition before the tournament. He first inspected Fleur’s wand, that contains a Veela hair that used to belong to her grandmother. So we were right in thinking she is part Veela.
James chuckles. “No, I believe this one will still do just fine,” he says as he nudges the broom on the table. “But it is related to Quidditch.”
Hermione, Ron and Neville also came to the party. It was cool to see them being impressed by our common room. Ron said the chairs were of a better quality than the Gryffindor ones, but he and Neville both agreed they would feel trapped without any outside windows. Hermione was most fascinated by the windows that made it possible to look into the lake. She wondered if we were ever able to see the giant squid. Daphne told her that the squid never comes that close to the castle, but that mermaids sometimes were visible in the distant.
“I don’t want to kiss you,” Harry almost shouts. The idea is insane. Ron and Hermione are like his brother and sister. He has no intention of ever kissing any one of them.
I took out my invisibility cloak and started to look in all the usual spots. I searched the library, in the hope Draco would be there still trying to find a way for me to breath underwater. I searched our favourite spots around the castle, I even tried the Prefect’s bathroom and Myrtle’s bathroom. Only Draco was nowhere to be found. It reminded me of the dreams I used to have in second year. You remember, the ones in which Draco kept disappearing as he’d never excited. It scared me. In the end, I sat down in an alcove and cried myself to sleep.
“Stop!” Narcissa screams. There is a power in her command that rings through the room. The pain fades away. Draco takes deep breaths as he stares at the ceiling of his room. His save place to hide when he was younger and had angered his father. Or to hide from the Dark Lord this summer. Only now the ceiling is the roof of his prison, the last thing he will see before it all ends.
Harry looks at Iris and Neville. He squeezes Iris’ hand softly. “I’m fine, Iris. You don’t have to worry,” he says.
Professor Lockhart is still as ignorant as ever. He thinks the danger has passed because Hagrid has been taken away. That the Minister of Magic wouldn’t have taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred per cent sure that he was guilty. But I was there when they came to take Hagrid, and the Minister hadn’t thought he done it, but just wanted to save his own face. I really need to calm myself during his lessons. He irritates me so much that I want to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in his stupid face.
Next to all the TriWizard stuff and stupid professor Moody, I’ve just been really busy with the massive amount of homework we’ve been getting. I wanted to cheat on my moon chart for Divination, but Draco wouldn’t let me. He made me do all the work and made sure I understood all the calculations. The predictions were really boring and I’m sure I would have gotten a better mark if I’d handed in a chart filled with catastrophes and near-death experiences. But that aside, we do spend a lot of time in the library with our friends doing homework. Our group is slowly growing. It is so different from first year where it was just me and Hermione. Now it’s Blaise, Luna, Greg, Daphne, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean and sometimes Millicent. It’s fun to study together and help each other. And when we’re studying, Hermione is less tempted to bring up S.P.E.W. and her fight against house-elf enslavement. And that’s a good thing. It’s like school and her S.P.E.W. is the only thing she’s willing to make time for at the moment. And complaining that Ron seems to be head over heels about this Veela girl from Beauxbatons. Blaise told her to take matters into her own hand and just ask Ron out on a date or something. But Hermione is refusing to take the first step.
When dinner was finished, Draco and I headed back to our dormitory, only to be stopped by Professor Snape. He wanted to explain that he just wants to make sure that I’ll be safe. There is a change that the broom came from Black and that its sole purpose is to kill me. And I understand that it’s all about my safety. But for only a little hour I was the owner of a real Firebolt, the best broom there is at the moment, and I didn’t even get to fly it. I’m sure there is nothing wrong with it now, but who knows what it will be like after they subjected it to all sorts of anti-jinx tests?
Malfoy shakes his head and his eyes darken again. ‘And you are going to make things better?’ he scribbles. ‘Do you even know what you did last year? I had to get by without help because you thought you had to make things better.’
I didn’t say, but I had kind of hope not to wake up again when I was stuck on that tree. Every day that Hermione is not here, every night without Draco close by, with all the teasing and bullying, with everyone treating me like I’m a horrible person for attacking Colin, Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, I think I would be better off dead. I want to die, momma. I want to die and be with you and dad.
With care, Harry turns Neville around. His eyes are closed and his face looks pale. Harry bends over his head and looks for any sign of life. A soft wind comes from Neville’s nose. He’s breathing. Harry drops his head on Neville’s chest for a second. “Thank Merlin,” he says. Neville is alive. Hurt and unconscious, but alive. James and Lily aren’t going to kill Harry. They’ll still be mad as hell when they hear what happened, but at least they won’t be able to blame Harry for losing Neville.
Harry nods, that will work. Hermione shakes her head on the other hand. She of course thought the idea of Harry making notes was a better idea.
Only moments later the door opened and headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall came in carrying what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall went to get Madam Pomfrey. It seemed there had been another attack and this time it was Colin Creevey, the Gryffindor first year that used to follow me around at the beginning of the year. He was also petrified, still holding his little camera in his hand. When headmaster Dumbledore took it and opened the back a jet of steam hissed out of the camera. The inside of the camera was melted and I wondered what that mend. I still need to tell Hermione; maybe it will help her in figuring out what is attacking everyone.
“We’re here,” Harry shouts back. He turns and spots Draco on the floor. He still has Harry’s wand in his trembling hand. Tears stream down his face and his eyes are fixed on Neville.
Neville manoeuvres around Harry and takes a hold of one of Malfoy’s arms. “Get off him, you idiot,” he says. Malfoy doesn’t seem to hear him. He just pulls his arm free and slams his fist at Harry’s chest.
“Come on, Harry, just slow down. Please,” Neville shouts again. He can’t keep up with Harry. He’s never had the same endurance. It’s why Harry is the jock and Neville the guy that likes to dig around in the dirt and cares for plants.
“You know what I mean,” Neville says. “He’s going to find out. You can’t keep your eyes off him. People are going to notice how you glance at him and how your skin gets flushed when he’s nearby. And how you’ll do anything for him. It will be better if he hears it from you,” Neville says.
“Shut up,” Harry says. “I’m kissing my boyfriend. I’ll catch you up later.” Then he turns back to Draco and places another kiss on his lips. Draco laughs into the kiss and then pushes Harry to the side.
Draco looks at his arm. The mark faded over the years to just some red lines on his pale skin. Draco remembers when Voldemort burned it into his skin, how it flared black before turning red. Aunt Bella had given Draco some pain potions before the act, said it would make things easier. It had still been painful but bearable. It was the start of the slide down. The potions had helped then. Helped him sleep, helped him forget, helped him to stop feeling anything at all.
But back to the maze. The TriWizard Cup will be placed in the centre of the maze and whoever gets there first will receive full marks. And of course, the maze will be filled with obstacles, like creatures and spells. Cedric is allowed to go in first, together with me, as we have the most points at this moment. Viktor will follow ten minutes later and finally, Fleur will be allowed to enter. I’ve told Hermione and Draco about the tasks and they’ve made this impressive list of jinxes, curses, spells and charms I should learn to get through the maze. I don’t think I can learn them all in time, but Draco is positive and keeps telling me that he’ll help me and will reward me for every spell I master. And I can say, I love the rewards he gives me late at night when our roommates are asleep.
“Thank you,” Harry says and then he leaves. Back in his dorm, he places the snowy owl’s feather in the box with the other little gifts. His hand dips into his pocket and he strokes the soft piece of fabric that he carries around everywhere. Fuck Malfoy and his stupid gifts.
Draco, Hermione and I went to visit Hagrid the Wednesday after that, he was really upset. Draco told him not to worry, that he was fine. Only that wasn’t the problem. The governors of the school had been told and Hagrid was afraid he would lose his job. We told him that we would back him up, tell everyone that needed to hear it the truth, that Crabbe had come up to Buckbeak without bowing, that he had ignored all Hagrid’s instructions. He hugged me and Draco, told us we were good boys. Hagrid was kind of drunk and Hermione told him so. He then went and stuck his head in the water barrel outside. When he came back he suddenly started shouting at us for wandering around after dark, that it was too dangerous. He escorted us back to the castle and promised him that we won’t go out after dark again.
I’m off to the Great Hall now to have lunch with Ron and then we are going flying on Fred and George their brooms, they told us yesterday that we could. I’m looking forward at being in the air again. It’s wonderful and now there will be no teacher to tell me to stay closer to the ground and stop spinning around. I will have to see about buying my own broom for next year when we are allowed to have our own brooms at school, so I can go flying in my free time.
“So, what is it that you did?” Draco asks. “Do we need to smuggle you over the border to keep you safe?”
Remus kisses Harry on the top of his head and then stands up. “We love you just the way you are, Harry,” he says and then he leaves. Harry is again alone in the dorm. He falls back down on his bed and cries. Is he a horrible person for wanting to give up everyone he loves, if it would mean that Draco would love him? It’s a silly thought. But it’s there, in Harry’s mind. He would give up everything for Draco. Even James, Lily, Neville and Iris. And that is the scariest thing Harry’s ever felt in his entire life.
The castle is quiet. Most portraits are asleep. Some of them snore, others talk in their sleep. Harry watches them. It sounds so easy, being a portrait. Never hungry, or scared. You never have to worry about getting your heart broken. Or fear for the lives of the people you love.
We didn’t waste any time with showers that morning, or hair braiding, or breakfast. We pulled on the first clothes we could find and started to make our way out of the castle. Only to get stopped by Professor Snape. He took one look at the Firebolt and demanded to know where we had gotten it. We told him it was sent to me for Christmas. Snape took the Firebolt from me and examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. He wanted to know from who it was and when we couldn’t tell him because there had been no card or message with it, Professor Snape decided to confiscate it so it could be checked for jinxes. He said something about Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick stripping it down and I think my heart stopped right there. Draco uttered something and Snape just said it was necessary and that it would only take a couple of weeks. He was sure I would have the broom back in time for the next Quidditch match. And with that, he walked away with my beautiful new broom.
Draco closes his eyes and bites away the sobs that threaten to leave him. “I’m sorry,” he stutters again. “I’m sorry for pushing you out, for believing you don’t want me if I can’t give you any children. For believing you would leave me because of everything I’ve done. For thinking I have to give you children to make you stay. I’m sorry for all of it. The miscarriage, all the times I hurt you, for following my father and fighting on the wrong side of the war. For almost killing Ron, for being one of the reasons why Sirius is dead, why Teddy has to grow up without his parents. For not holding on to Vincent’s hand. For the potions, now and back then. I wanted to take them today. I wanted it all to stop. I want the pain to stop. It won’t stop, Harry. Please make it stop.”
After we’ve all gotten our money we split up and agreed to meet again at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy our schoolbooks. I, Hermione and Ron strolled off toward the broom store. Here I bought the new Nimbus 2001. It’s black and silver with revolving stirrups. Because they pivot they should be more comfortable while slitting in different positions on the broom. The shop owner told me it’s the fastest broom in existence and already ordered by all the big Quidditch teams. Ron is very jealous about it and has already asked me if he can try it out tomorrow. I’m sure I’ll let him after I’ve taken it for a spin myself. I’m looking forward to flying on my own broom. It should be better than the brooms I’ve flown up until now.
“I wouldn’t know, Mrs Prince,” Harry tells her. Even though he also doesn’t like Malfoy’s father all that much. He’s the reason why Malfoy doesn’t want anyone else to know he’s deaf. And that is just plain wrong. But he won’t say that out loud. It will only upset Malfoy. And that is the last thing Harry wants.
“Oh, he stayed with Luna and Ginny,” Hermione says. “A Dementor came to check our compartment and they were pretty freaked out.”
Harry wants to smack Ginny. Sometimes she’s a pain in the arse. But she’s Ron’s little sister, and good on a broom. Harry loves playing Quidditch with her on their days off. She will surely get a place on the team when there are openings next year. But she should know not to judge people by their cover. Luna is weird, and looks the part, but she’s a lovely person. Ginny is her friend, she knows that appearances aren’t all that reliable.
Harry directs his broom towards Draco. “You can use mine. It’s already flying,” he says. Another idea from Hermione. What if the broom stays in the air after Harry has spelt it to, even if someone else goes flying on it? They both don’t know if it’s going to work, but it’s worth a shot.
“Not when you’re having a party,” Draco tells him. Ron’s lack of manners will never stop to amaze Draco. Right now, he needs a large dose of alcohol so he can erase the image of Ron fucking Hermione on the kitchen counter out of his head.
“And what if they don’t? What if it’s just bad luck?” Draco doesn’t know if he can handle that. Or maybe it’s even worse. Perhaps they will tell them that it truly is his fault and that there is no solution. That will make Harry leave him for sure. Once Harry finds out that Draco can never give him the family he wants so badly, it will all be over.
Draco has known that this day was coming. The last time they saw Hermione, she was huge and kept saying she wished the baby would just come already. So when Ron phoned Harry this morning to say they were on their way to the hospital, that it had started, it was no surprise. So now he and Harry sit in the small waiting room at the end of the hallway, while Hermione is giving birth to her little one. And all Draco can think off is how it’s been nine months since new years. And that for nine months he still hasn’t managed to conceive again.
“Yeah, I know, behave and all that. Sorry Harry,” she says. Not that she means it. Draco knows her. Something is bothering her. She’s been trying to pick a fight with Harry and Teddy since the moment she stepped into the house. Draco had just made dinner, and Pansy invited herself to stay for it. And now she’s playing with her wine, hardly drinking from it. And that can only mean one thing. Pansy did something more than stupid.
“It’s been a hard week,” Harry pitches in. “We both would like to get this over with as soon as possible, so we can grieve and try to move on.”
Harry gets up and walks to the aquarium. A strange creature floods around it, with scary legs. “It looks ugly,” Harry says.
I was frozen on my seat, just staring at the headmaster, expecting him to say it was a silly joke. Draco was squeezing my hand tightly and I was aware that he was shaking his head. Professor Snape got up and whispered something in the headmaster's ear. I was aware that nobody was clapping or cheering. No everyone was staring at me. Hermione was even standing on top of the Gryffindor table so she could see me. I looked her in the eyes and said I didn’t put my name in. I know she couldn’t hear me but she nodded.
Harry shakes his head. “They would never,” he says. He looks at Neville and wonders if he still worries. They’ve faced Voldemort twice now in the two years they’ve been at Hogwarts. And it’s clear the man still wants Neville dead. Pettigrew used to be part of his crew. And he’s already been spotted in Hogsmeade once. It’s a miracle they even were allowed to go out to Hogsmeade. Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if their parents would have stopped them for the fear that something might happen to him or Neville.
“He isn’t crazy,” Harry says. He nudges his shoulder and Ginny gets the massage. She lifts her head, looks at Harry and raises her eyebrows.
The tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin as soon as I hissed the words. Then the sink sank right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed. The pipe was wide enough for a man to slide into. I told Ron that I was going down. I couldn’t not go, not if there was a change that Draco was still alive. I had to believe he was, the thought of losing him for good was daunting. Ron said he would come with me and I was thankful that I didn’t have to go down the pipe alone.
“Pansy, you weren’t there. You didn’t hear him stutter. It was weird. Like he wanted to say something, but couldn’t get the words over his lips. I always knew he was stupid. But this, it triumphs it all.” Draco sits down on the sofa and stares at the fire. Tomorrow is the next tasks, and if the rumours are correct, Potter will have to retrieve something from the great lake. Draco sure hopes the idiot knows how to swim.
They try again, with the same disappointing result. The broom crashes to the ground, over and over again. Draco’s shoulders start to slump and after the seventh attempt, Draco kicks the broom away. There are tears in his eyes. Harry wants to hug Draco and tell him it will all be okay, that he will fly today. But that’s not what friends do, so he keeps his distance. It’s time to try the next option.
‘I asked Professor Lupin, my uncle, if he knows of ways for you to learn to cast. Because I think you can’t. And if you can, I’m sorry. That’s why I should have talked to you first. And also to hear if you want any extra help with this. Lupin told me to go talk to you first. But he thinks that Professor Flitwick might be able to help. Lupin said he’s been reading up on how to teach deaf wizards to master magic. He could help you. But Lupin won’t go talk to him until you say it’s okay. I’m sorry. I really am. I should have come to you first. I just want to help. I don’t want to make it worse.’
"So you and he aren't going to join us for dinner," Ron says. "And you need me to tell mom because you're scared shitless of what she'll say."
Harry turns to look at Neville. It’s the first time he’s called Draco by his first name. “You called him Draco,” Harry says.
Oh, I also need to tell you about something weird. Professor Snape thinks that Draco and I stole the Gillyweed and Boomslang skin from his office. I tried to explain that Dobby stole the Gillyweed, that he gave it to me. But that didn’t convince Professor Snape. He said he would have no other choice but to report us if we would brake into his office again.
Only nothing happened, Nott just kept giving me and Draco lurking faces in the next week. Hermione, Ron, Neville and I spend a lot of time at Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to make him realize he can’t keep the dragon. But he even named it Norbert, like it’s a little child. It had grown three times in length in that first week and Hagrid didn’t do anything else than look after it, ignoring all his gamekeeping duties. Draco didn’t want to come with to Hagrid. He always made up excuses about homework he still needed to do.
Things are better now. I have to see a mind healer once a week. We talk about my classes mostly. Sometimes we talk about you, or how it is to live with the Dursleys. She never asks me why I did it, and I’m glad. I don’t really want to talk about it. Hermione is still petrified and I’ve been to visit her a couple of times. It’s hard to see her lying there, so still. It almost looks like she’s dead. But Miss Davis says it’s good to go and see her and talk to her like I would do if she wasn’t petrified, so I do.
This Tuesday we went over to the family Tonks so we could take a very early Port-key to the Quidditch World Cup. Sirius had gotten tickets from the Ministry for his wrongful imprisonment. We were all very excited to go. We had six tickets and we went together with Draco, Tonks, Remus and Mr Tonks. Mrs Tonks made us an amazing dinner the night before and promised to wake us all up in time. It felt like she woke us up way too early. Draco was even cranky, and he’s the morning person of both of us. I was just glad she didn’t say anything about the fact that Draco hadn’t slept in the bed she made for him but instead had again crawled into mine.
“No, I won’t leave it,” the pregnant man says. “We’ve been there. They don’t need more shit on their plate. Not with what they are going through right now.”
I will let you both know as soon as I do what is going to happen now. If I get expelled or not and if I can stay here for the rest of the summer. I really hope I can.
It is stupid and unrealistic. Harry knows this. But he can’t help it. He sits down at the back of the class during potions, just so he can stare at the platinum blond hair in front of him. Hermione and Ron have stopped trying to make conversations with him during meals, sure that Harry won’t hear a word they say. And they are right of course. Dinner is only useful because it gives Harry the chance to study Malfoy.
“I’ll help you,” Draco says. He doesn’t know where the words come from. He shouldn’t say these things out loud. It could mean the end of him. Of his mother and father. When the Dark Lord finds out.
Draco asked him if he knew why my scar hurts and he wasn’t happy with the answer. Dumbledore said he had a theory and no more than that. He thinks it’s because of the failed Killing Curse from when I was a baby. Because of my scar, I feel pain when Voldemort is near and when he feels a strong surge of hatred. Draco hates this, he doesn’t want me to be connected to the Dark Lord in any way. He says that one soul biding connection is enough for a person. I told him it’s not the same as our connection. I don’t feel Voldemort all the time, as I feel Draco. This calmed Draco down a little, but he is still upset about it all.
“Are you even listening to me?” Ron suddenly asks. “And what is it you’re looking at. Hermione and Krum left the dance floor ages ago.”
The Dark Lord chuckles and Draco turns his head so he can see the man. He twirls his wand in his hand. His tongue licks over his upper lip. The right side of his mouth is lifted in a grin and his eyes twinkle as if he’s just got a new toy from Santa.
That’s the worst of it all. Harry doesn’t mind that Draco doesn’t like him in that way. But why can’t they stay friends? They got along great. Is it that bad that Harry is gay? Harry never thought Draco would be that closed-minded. He knows what it’s like to be part of a minority that isn’t all that accepted in the wizarding world. It might not be the same, being deaf and being gay, but they’re both frowned upon. They could have supported each other. Harry had expected Draco to see that Harry is still the same person, someone worth his time.
On the first Wednesday after the Easter holidays, Hagrid send us a note saying that his dragon egg was hatching. I was having lunch with Draco and Blaise when his note arrived. It only said: It’s hatching. Draco wanted to know what was hatching and on our way to Herbology, I told him that Hagrid was hiding a dragon egg in his hut. Draco his mouth fell open in surprise and he wanted to skip Herbology to go watch the egg hatch. I agreed with him and ran up to Hermione and Ron to tell them we were going to Hagrid. Ron wanted to come with, but Hermione wouldn’t hear of it. She started complaining, but Ron silenced her when Draco came closer. I told them Draco knows and Ron was outraged. He said I was an idiot for trusting Malfoy, that he would betray Hagrid and get him fired. Draco then called Ron a fool and they started bickering. I just took Hermione’s arm and escorted her to Hagrid’s hut. Ron and Draco followed us still calling each other names until we reached the door.
Harry lays down next to Draco and rests his head on Draco’s chest. Draco twists his hand in Harry’s hair and plays with the strands.
“Draco, I know you’re struggling. You’ve been sick this entire pregnancy. Not to say your emotional state. We all want you to be okay, so let's make sure you will be after our little third miracle is born. We’ll have four beautiful children and I want to enjoy them with you, not just by myself.”
When we got back to the Slytherin common room that evening everyone was nervous. Marcus kept walking up and down the room muttering to himself. Derrick and Bole were polishing their beater bats and Adrian and Miles kept going over the tactics we all agreed on for the match. I just sat down next to Draco on a sofa. I didn’t want to talk because every time I opened my mouth I felt like making a run for the toilets.
“You don’t have to,” Harry continues. “I just worry about you. I know you haven’t been feeling well lately.”
It had been beautiful. Harry wishes he had recorded it so he could listen to it one last time, the song Draco wrote just for him. Instead, the piano disappears and Harry falls on his knees on the empty spot.
Harry looks over the lake and shrugs. “I can’t help it, Neville,” he says. “He’d made studying fun, somehow. And now it’s just painful.”
“You’re saying, I’m the person Potter will miss the most?” Draco stutters. They most all have gone insane. In which universe does the person someone will miss the most come down to the one person they hate the most?
“Now we wait,” the healer starts. “When something like this happens, we like to wait another week and have another scan. Just to make sure that the foetus isn’t growing and that we didn’t make a mistake in calculating the date when you conceived.”
I want it to stop. I want it all to stop. It’s a good thing most children are going home for Christmas tomorrow because I can’t do it any longer. There is not a single person in this school that doesn’t think I’m the one causing the attacks now. Another boy has been petrified, together with Nearly Headless Nick. I would never hurt Nick, he’s a friendly ghost. He even helped me at the beginning of the year when Filch was trying to give me detention because he had left mud on the floor. And he was so nice to invite me to his party. Why would I hurt him? But nobody seems to care about that. No, they only see the boy who can talk to snakes and has been spotted at the scene of the crime, twice. And I was missing for the other one, so it must be me. But I’m not doing this. I promise mom, I’m not.
This Saturday there was another Quidditch match. It was Gryffindor against Hufflepuff. I went to watch with my friends and even wore the Gryffindor tie, just to support them a little. I didn’t go all the way and pulled my green jumper on as well. Gryffindor could overtake Slytherin in the house championship if they would win this match, so I kind of hoped they would lose. Ron and Neville complained that it was unfair that Snape was the referee for the match because he would be biased, him being the head of house of Slytherin. Professor Snape scares me; I think he might even be able to read minds. He’s been extra horrible to me in Potions, blaming me when Malfoy makes a mistake. And I keep running into him wherever I go. Maybe he knows that I know that he wants to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone.
“They are going to catch him,” Harry tells Neville before he turns and follows Oliver out of the entrance hall.
I could see myself in the mirror. I was pale and scared-looking at first. But only a moment later, my reflection was smiling at me. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. Then he winked and put the stone back into the pocket. And at that moment I could feel something heavy drop into my real pocket. Somehow I had gotten the stone.
“Neville, please drop it,” Harry says. He can’t do this. He won’t cry in front of his brother again. No matter how much it hurts, Harry will forget about Draco. He has to. He picks up the newspaper and goes over the article again. “Do you know where this street is they mention?” he asks.
Merlin beards, does Malfoy truly believe that it was normal to hide his condition? The hatred of his father and Uncle Sirius towards the Malfoy family starts to make sense. Because this is wrong.
We slowly walked down to the dungeons. I told Draco about what was said in the small room, about what Moody had said, that maybe someone put my name in to get me killed. I mentioned my dream from last summer wherein I’d heard Voldemort plotting my death. Draco stayed silent next to me, he just held my hand while I talked.
I was panicking. I could run and no one would ever know I had been there. But I also couldn’t just leave them there. I had to get help. But who would believe I didn’t do it? I was so lost. What was I supposed to do? And then Peeves came by and saw the bodies next to me. He started screaming: ATTACK! Attack! No mortal or ghost is safe, run for your lives. And of course that made every door in the hallway crash open and students were coming in from all directions. It wasn’t until Professor McGonagall came on the scene and she had ordered everyone back into class that I dared to move. Professor McGonagall looked at me and told me to follow her. I tried to tell her that I hadn’t done it, but she said it was out of her hands. And then she took me to headmasters Dumbledore’s office.
Well, that all for now. I’m going to brush my teeth and get ready for bed. Got lots of schoolwork to do again tomorrow. I’ll let you know who will become Hogwarts Champion when I write to you again.
I tried to shut him up by saying hadn’t done that and I think Sirius was relieved to hear that. He went on that Draco and I are still very young and that I shouldn’t do anything I don’t want to. I promised I wouldn’t and then fled the room. Draco has looked into the book and says it’s interesting, says I should read it for when we want to take that step, so I also know what to expect. I don’t know if I want that, but on the other hand, the idea of being that close and intimate with Draco makes me feel all fussy inside.
“Yes, we can start with the basics this holiday,” Hermione says while she pats Ron on his head. Ginny laughs until Hermione looks at her and she realises that she will have to start with a BSL crash course too and she groans.
“Somebody just told his parents that he’s going to be a big brother,” Draco says while he takes three plates from the cupboard and gives them to Harry.
“I love you, and I’m sorry I didn’t congratulate you properly,” Draco tells her. “Don’t let my stupid behaviour ruin this moment for you,” he continues.
“Draco, I don’t care that you are a homosexual. There have been others like you. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. But that doesn’t mean you can’t marry and produce an heir. I’m sure we can find you a wife who won’t mind that you have lovers on the side,” Narcissa says.
When I woke up again I was in the hospital wing and headmaster Dumbledore was sitting next to my bed. I freaked out a little and told him that Quirrell had the stone. But he told me to relax and that everything was fine. I looked around then and saw that the table next to me was piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. The headmaster said they were tokens from my friends and admirers since the entire school seems to know what happened in the dungeons, even though it’s a complete secret.
“You should hurry now, the other players have already left the castle,” Myrtle says while she flies around them.
Hermione lifts her shoulders. “It’s just, you normally are worse than those two.” Hermione nods her head towards Neville and Ron who are both at the table with books and parchment around them.
After that, the Headmaster introduced Professor Lupin and both me and Draco didn’t miss the look of loathing on Professor Snape’s face. I wonder why Snape hates Professor Lupin that much, I know he wants the DADA job, but I’m sure it’s more than just that. Draco thinks they maybe know each other somehow, says they are around the same age, so maybe they went to school together and didn’t get along or something.
Hagrid opened the archway to Diagon Alley after that. It was amazing. The stones of the wall just disappeared and made an archway. There were shops everywhere, with cauldrons, owls, broomsticks, robes and telescopes. I’ve never seen anything like it and I wanted to go to all the shops at once.
Draco is telling me I still need to finish my paper on Vampires for Lupin and that he would like to go to sleep soon, so I guess I’ll get on to that. I’ll write to you soon.
When everyone was off to bed, including Blaise, Draco asked me not to go. He was afraid I would get caught again, or get hurt trying to get past the charms that are protecting the stone, or worse, that Voldemort and Snape would beat me to the stone and kill me. We argued a little, with me telling him that I had to go, that it was important that I stopped Snape from getting the stone. And Draco said he didn’t want to lose his friend. In the end, Draco stepped in front of the stone doorway and told me he wouldn’t let me go, that he would fight me if he had to. And then I used Petrificus Totalus on Draco, a full body-bind jinx Draco had shown me how to do for when Nott or Crabbe ever tried to do anything to me again. I told Draco I was really sorry, but that I had to go. He had tears in his eyes when I left and I was close to crying myself. Leaving Draco lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel good, it felt horrible. And I was hoping the rest of the night would go better.
As silently as he can, Harry walks towards the stacks and searches the rows. He should have taken the map from Neville. That would make this search in the library so much easier. Now Harry has to look around each corner, into each pathway, in the hope he doesn’t run into Pettigrew before he finds Draco.
Harry feels his blood boil. “His father is an idiot,” he says. “Malfoy has been struggling in school for two years because that man thinks nobody is allowed to know that his son is deaf. Malfoy needed extra help, and nobody gave it to him. Teachers just thought he was a difficult boy who doesn’t want to study. But he’s not. He studies harder than any of us. Even more than Hermione, and that is saying something. Malfoy’s always reading school books and uses all his free time to learn more. Mrs Prince said he’s in the library almost every day. She noticed what was going on with him. So why did nobody else?”
‘I would,’ Malfoy answers. Harry wants to jump from his seat and dance around. He doesn’t. Malfoy might change his mind when he sees how stupid Harry can act from time to time. He does spot the clock at the end of the room and curses. He quickly writes down that he needs to hurry off to dinner because he has an extra Quidditch practise this evening.
“I won’t,” Draco answers. “You can arrange all you want, I won’t do it.” Draco has made up his mind. He can’t live a life filled with lies. No matter how hard it is to stand up against father and hold his ground, Draco won’t give in. Not this time.
Draco kissed me in front of the whole school then. He took my head in between his hands and told me he would be right there waiting for me. He told me to be brave and rested his head against mine for a small second. I nodded and turned to the door, alone and scared.
The next day, Harry sneaks off to the library again after his last class. He finds Malfoy and sits down opposite him, just as the day before. They both do their homework without acknowledging each other until it’s time for dinner. Neville is the one that asks Harry this time where he’s been. Harry doesn’t tell them. If he does, Hermione will want to join, and that will ruin his entire plan. Or Neville and Ron will pop by, only to find out Harry’s still trying to get Malfoy’s attention. Harry doesn’t want to know what Neville will have to say about that. Harry already knows it’s not healthy to obsess about Malfoy. He doesn’t need Neville pointing out what it might mean. Harry isn’t even sure himself what it all means. The only thing he knows is that he needs to do this.
I can’t believe it’s only two more nights before I go back to Hogwarts for my third year. It’s the first time since starting that I’m really looking forward to it. I just know it’s going to be a good year. Draco and I are dating and I will join the Quidditch team. I’m going to be an athlete. Who would ever think that? Dad, did you play Quidditch? I wish I knew or knew someone who could tell me. At least this last month of the summer holiday has been good. Mr and Mrs Tonks already promised me that they would chat with headmaster Dumbledore if there is a way for me to spend more of my holidays with them. Draco’s mom and they both agree it’s unhealthy for me to stay with the Dursleys for long periods of time.
“It’s okay, Draco,” Hermione says. Her hand rests on Draco’s shoulder. Draco thinks he should look at her, but he can’t take his eyes off the baby in his hands.
I’m not completely sure what happened next. I think Black made a move to grab Scabbers, Ron screamed in pain and professor Lupin was dragging Black away from Ron yelling that they first had to make us understand. The rat was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face. Black, Lupin, Ron and Hermione fought back and forth about if Scrabbers could be Peter Pettigrew and I just stood there. It all made no sense. Black had killed Pettigrew twelve years ago, only days after he made sure you died. And I had missed my chance to revenge you because of Draco, and professor Lupin was in on it all and I was certain we were all going to die that night.
“Mr Malfoy, could we have a word?” Lily asks before they are out of earshot. Harry could hug his mum. She’s amazing and Harry will do whatever she wants him to all summer if she will be able to give him the possibility to properly say goodbye to Draco.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley,” Hermione states as she stands up. “You fought with Harry on the day of the task because of his crush? Are you insane?”
My Patronus lessons aren’t going as great as I would like. Draco has no problem conjuring his Patronus. The Tigress is beautiful and always drives the Dementor away. I, on the other hand, are only capable of producing an indistinct, silvery shadow that won’t do anything. It just makes the Dementor hover in place, draining me until I almost pass out. Draco gives me disappointing looks after each lesson. I think he knows that I secretly desire to hear your voices again. Professor Lupin is really proud of both of us. He told me that it’s a huge achievement for a thirteen-year-old wizard to produce an indistinct Patronus. He had complete confidence in me, that I would be okay during the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. Well, I was, but not thanks to my Patronus, no it was Draco that saved me.
“Hermione, stay out of this,” Harry says. “You don’t understand. You didn’t grow up with the scars that man caused.”
He left just before I started this letter. He promised to come when the Ministry is going to do their test to prove that Draco and I have this special soul bond. I keep forgetting the name and Draco is asleep right now so I can’t ask him. I’ll tell you the next time I write to you.
I wasn’t allowed any visitors for the first two days. Madam Pomfrey said I needed rest, so my body could heal. She told me she had mended my broken ribs and broken leg and that she had stopped all the internal bleeding. But she was still very worried about my eye and she made a special healer from London come over to take a look at it. I needed to take multiple potions those first days, for healing and against the pain. And Madam Pomfrey used a special salve for my bruises to help them heal.
We arrived at their house when the sun was coming up on the horizon.  It looks like it had once been a large stone pigpen, but it has extra rooms added here and there. It is several stories high and so crooked it looks like it’s held up by magic. It has five chimneys and a lopsided sign is stuck in the ground near the entrance reading the Burrow. I think it’s wonderful. I’ve been staying here for the last couple of weeks, sleeping in Ron’s room. Almost everything in his room is orange, like his bedspread, the walls and even the ceiling. And there are posters everywhere of the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team. Oh, and a ghoul lives in the attic and you can hear him banging on the pipes and groaning at night.
Harry lifts his shoulders and stares out of the window. It’s a beautiful afternoon. It’s a shame that there is no Quidditch practice today. It would have been nice to go out and fly a bit. But the Hufflepuff team is on the pitch right now. They have a match in two weeks. It’s going to be the decider of the year. Hufflepuff has won their match against Slytherin. If they win against Gryffindor, they will be the champions this year. And Diggory is putting in all the effort to try to make that happen. Oliver is worried. He’s taken Harry aside on multiple occasions to instruct him that he needs to find the Snitch as soon as possible during the game, so as not to give the Hufflepuff team time to get into the lead.
Narcissa takes him in her arms again. She doesn’t say anything else. No words of how all will be fine, how things will work out somehow. Because they won’t. Harry is dead and there is nothing they can do to bring him back. The Dark Lord has won. And all because of one small accident. Because Draco couldn’t hold onto the person he loves. Draco holds onto his mother’s dress as he sobs. He can’t hold the tears back any longer. Not now all hope seems lost.
The next obstacle was some kind of enchanted mist. This is when Fleur screamed. I could feel that Draco was worried about me so I chanted that I was fine, that all was okay. And reading his letter to you from yesterday, I guess it did help him a little.
While the Professor and I were having tea Professor Snape came by to bring Lupin a potion because he’d been feeling a little off-colour. It was weird seeing them interact. I don’t think they like each other very much. And it didn’t look like Snape made the potion out of kindness, more because someone ordered him to do it. Like when I get when I don’t want to make my homework. They hardly spoke more than three words at each other. Professor Lupin didn’t even thank Professor Snape for the potion, he just drowned it quickly and placed the smoking goblet on his desk. And then I saw it, the picture on Professor Lupin’s desk. It contained both of you, a younger Professor Lupin and two other young men I didn’t recognise. And it just shocked me, seeing you there in that picture, big smiles on your faces.
Harry just stares at Draco who tries hard not to look at any of them. He must feel bad that this is another thing he can’t do. Harry doesn’t want to think about how that class would have gone for Draco. How the others would have made fun of him, stuck on the ground. Why didn’t anyone realise something was wrong when Draco couldn’t even get his broom to fly for him?
But like I was saying, Hermione disturbed the History of Magic class last Wednesday. Professor Binns was droning on about the International Warlock Convention of 1289 when she put up her hand and just asked point blank if the professor could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets. Well, that woke up everyone in the class. Professor Binns told us about the founders of the school and how Salazar Slytherin wanted to be more selective about the students who they would admit to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. It turned into this big argument between Slytherin and Gryffindor and Slytherin left the school. And the legend goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing, that could only be opened by his own true heir to unleash the horror within, to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.
It isn’t long after that that Draco feels he needs to go to the toilet. A large bundle of tissue comes out of him. It’s gross and looks disgusting. But it’s a relieve. Instinctively Draco knows that this is it. The worst is over, and he survived. He cries tears, not from the physical pain this time, but from the emotional pain. His baby is gone now for real. It’s all over. He and Harry won’t become parents.
The classroom door opens and Malfoy stands up from the floor. He goes inside. Harry, Neville and Hermione follow him. As usual, Malfoy finds a spot at the back of the class. He sits down and pulls his history textbook out of his bag.
Draco gets up and sits back down next to Harry. “I don’t know what to do. I feel so empty right now,” he says.
With that, Harry ends the call. He walks back into the bedroom and crawls into bed with Draco. He tells Draco he loves him and puts his arms around him. They don’t say another word, and they don’t wish each other a happy new year when the fireworks start to light up the room. It’s so different from last year it frightens Harry. All he can do is hope that this year will be better than the previous.
“He’s excited to spend more time with his uncles. I told him yesterday about our new arrangement,” Andromeda says. Draco turns to look at her and is surprised to see the smile on Andromeda’s face.
Others move passed Harry and Parvati to get into the great hall. Harry doesn’t pay them much attention. And for once everyone isn’t looking at him, but instead at Hermione. She looks gorgeous tonight, her arm linked with Viktor Krum. Ron is still pissed off about it. He couldn’t believe his eyes when Hermione walked in with the Durmstrang student. Harry is sure that Parvati’s sister is fed up by now with Ron. Knowing him, he’ll still be complaining about Hermione and Krum.
Harry looks at Neville for support, but Neville shakes his head. “I agree with Hermione about this,” he says. “We hardly know him. And he’s not our problem.”
On Tuesday I made sure I got out of bed before Nott and Crabbe woke up and spend the entire day sitting on a toilet listening to Myrtle complain about the fact that Hermione is not visiting anymore and that she’s a horrible friend. I tried to explain that she had to go home for the holidays and would be back in January, but Myrtle didn’t believe me.
I walked back to the Great Hall together with Professor Snape, who told me that he will not tolerate beds not being used and that he doesn’t want to get any complaints from Nott and Crabbe this year. So Draco takes my cloak with him to bed at night and once Nott and Crabbe are dozing off he sneaks into my bed and hugs me close.
Things have gone from bad to worse. It seems everyone thinks I’m the heir of Slytherin. There’s this boy in Hufflepuff named Justin, he ran away from me one day when I wanted to great him in the library. And Ron and Neville don’t want to be seen with me either. None of the Gryffindors wants to by the way. I’m not allowed to eat at their table anymore. I tried to explain that it wasn’t me, but nobody seems to want to listen. Only Hermione and Blaise still hang out with me, and the girl Blaise has been hanging out with. Her name is Luna and she’s a bit crazy, but I like her. She doesn’t seem to care about what happened at all.
Hermione shakes her head. “Pettigrew won’t get in here. Hogwarts is well protected. And there are Dementors outside the gates. He will never get past them.”
Everyone groins at that statement. Ever since Sirius opened his mouth about how useful a house-elf would      be and Hermione figured out what house-elves are and that they don’t get paid for their services, she’s been on and on about starting a movement to free them all. She doesn’t understand that Dobby was the crazy one of them all, the only elf Harry ever met that wanted to be set free. Most elves are perfectly happy where they are and enjoy the fact they get to serve wizards and witches. But Hermione just points out it’s the same as Muggle slaves and that there was a reason slavery was made illegal. Harry doesn’t get it. If the elves are happy, then what is the problem with having them? It’s not that they have a bad life. Most of them are content and well treated. Not all families are the Malfoy     s who disrespect their elves. And with what Harry has learnt over the past couple of weeks, Dobby was only mistreated by Draco’s father. He was Draco’s friend, and Draco misses him whenever he goes home.
I think I just witnessed a real prediction from Professor Trelawney. I happened right after my exam, which I don’t think I’ve passed. Professor Trelawney saw us one by one and the waiting took forever. In the end, it was only me and Draco left. Draco went first and he wasn’t really happy when he came back down. He said he thought he failed, he couldn’t see a thing in the crystal bowl, so he made stuff up. He asked if he needed to wait for me but I told him I’d see him in the common room afterwards. I knew he wanted to write his mom about how his exams had gone and if he could do that before I was done we would have more time to spend with just the two of us.
‘That explains why you are so lousy at every subject that is more difficult than Divination,’ Malfoy writes
Harry shakes his head. He knows this. Sirius always takes care of Remus. He won’t leave him alone during the worst night of the month.
“I don’t want to know what just almost happened out there,” Burke says. “What I do want to know is how you’re holding up, Draco?”
The warning never came, but the insults from Aunt Marge continued. And then yesterday, just after dinner when Aunt Marge was hammered from the wine she turned on me again. Told me I had a mean, runty look, just like some dogs. And then she told us that she had Colonel Fubster drown one of her dogs last year because it was weak. I looked down at my hands when she continued, small tears falling from my eyes. She went on, explaining it all comes down o blood and that Aunt Petunia’s sister was a bad egg. That she was stupid to run off with a wastrel and that I was the result of that. She then asked what you did for a living, dad and Uncle Vernon said you were unemployed. And then Aunt Marge just went on, saying you were a no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger and I just snapped. I pushed my chair back, stood up and screamed at her that you were not. She laughed at me, joked about the tears I was shedding and then she suggested that you died because you were driving drunk I couldn’t take it and yelled that you didn’t die in a car crash. This made Aunt Marge angry, she, of course, doesn’t know the truth and still believes you dying in a car crash is the trued. She called me a nasty little liar, an insolent, ungrateful little something. She couldn’t finish her sentence, her body was swelling, her face expanded, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech. Then the buttons from her tweed jacket burst. She just kept swelling. I knew I was doing it, but I couldn’t stop it. I was so angry. I’ve never been that angry before, it scared me a little.
“Your dad thinks Pettigrew can get into Hogwarts?” Hermione asks. Her face turns a little pale and Harry wishes he hadn’t said anything. He doesn’t want to scare Hermione. It’s already bad enough that he and Neville know how dangerous Pettigrew can be. But maybe it will make her understand that they need to stop him. Before Neville finds him and gets himself killed.
Draco sits on the lid of the toilet. The timer he cast next to him counts down slowly. Draco tries not to look at it, or the vial on the counter. He wrings his hands together and stares at the floor. His wedding ring glistens in the light that filters in through the window. Draco lets out a breath when it catches his attention. The ring is a constant reminder that Harry loves him, no matter what. There is no reason to be this nervous. Draco hadn’t dared to tell Harry he’s taking a test today. Harry didn’t get why Draco couldn’t come along to pick up Teddy, but Draco just needs to know. He can’t wait any longer. He’s been so tired the last two weeks, and last night, Draco struggled to keep his diner down.
It took me a while to calm down. Dragging along my heavy trunk helped with that. When I reached Magnolia Crescent I collapsed onto a low wall. It didn’t take long before I started to panic then. I was sure I would get expelled from Hogwarts because I did magic and even harmed a Muggle doing so. I was afraid I was going to get arrested, or outlawed from the wizarding world. And that made me think of Draco, and how I would have to leave him if that was true. I couldn’t force Draco to leave the wizarding world, he knows nothing about Muggles and their ways. I started to cry again, wishing I could be with Draco at that moment. I needed him more than ever.
“You never heard me say that,” Hermione says as she looks into the last compartment of the carriage. She shakes her head and moves towards the next carriage. Harry wonders where Iris has gone. It’s her first time going and already she’s missing. Harry told her to stay close, now that Pettigrew is on the loose. They all know the man has it in for their family. And Harry will never forgive himself if his little sister gets hurt.
The air rushes past Harry as he pulls his wand out of his sleeve. He has no idea what kind of spell he should use. He tries Wingardium Leviosa, in the hope he can make himself float. Of course, it doesn’t work. Tears well up in Harry’s eyes. He doesn’t want to die. Not like this. Not when he’s just figured out that he wants Draco to be his boyfriend. That he wants to take him out on a proper date. And maybe even take him home to his parents.
It doesn’t take long before his friends catch up with him and they walk out of the front doors together.
Draco and Hermione have started researching again to help Hagrid with his case. I wish I could help them more, but Miss Davis is giving me more and more homework for therapy. Even though I tell her time and time again that I’m fine and that I don’t need her anymore. She seems to think that having Black around is making me more unstable. It really sucks. I don’t want to go and do all the work she’s giving me. I want to help Draco and Hermione so we can save Buckbeak.
I lost the Marauder’s map. Draco says it’s because I got cocky. I took the invisibility cloak so it would be easier to sneak in and out of the basement of Honeydukes. Draco was waiting for me outside. We decided not to tell anyone else I was coming. Hermione had told us she was really worried, with Ron being attacked and all. And Blaise said he wanted to spend the day with Luna. I think they’re dating. Oh and Greg told us he kind of fancies Daphne, so we told them I wasn’t coming and Draco made up an excuse to leave them alone as soon as possible.
Mr Diggory continued to question Mr Crouch’s house-elf and I was surprised when Draco spoke up to say that it hadn’t been a house-elf voice that had conjured the mark, but the voice of a man. There was some more discussion going on and in the end, everyone agreed that the house-elf couldn’t have conjured the mark and we were all free to go and I’d gotten my wand back. Sirius apparated us back to Grimmauld Place and made us go back to bed. In bed, Draco explained to me that the Dark Mark was used whenever someone was killed by Death Eaters. His father had told him about it when he was younger. I told Draco I was worried, that not long ago I had woken up with my scar hurting and now his mark had shown in the sky. Draco nodded and kissed me and told me to try to get some sleep.
Harry pats Neville on his back and pushes him forward, urging him to move on. “They’ll have him back in custody before you know it. You heard dad, the entire Auror department has been put on the case.” And even if that was a lie, James will make sure it’s one of the department’s top priorities. Harry hasn’t missed the fights James had with Lily when they thought Harry, Neville and Iris were asleep. Mum is scared that James will do something stupid if it comes to Pettigrew. Or that Harry and Neville will go after the man alone if they knew the whole truth. Harry wonders what this truth is. He already knows that it was Pettigrew who gave away Neville’s parents’ location to Voldemort, and that he was the one casting the curse that permanently damaged Sirius’ hearing. What else is there to know? And what could be worse than all that?
“Yes, you can,” Harry says to answer Teddy. Draco can see the tears form in Harry’s eyes. The little tremble in his hand when he takes a cookie from the plate when Andromeda offers them to him. And the only thing that Draco can think is how he did this to him. Without saying a word, Draco gets up and walks out of the room. He hears Harry call after him while he hurries up the stairs and into their bedroom. As soon as he closes the door, he drops to the floor and lets the pain boil to the surface.
Draco wrote me back to tell me he loves to see the house and the family tree. As a kid he had a lot of lessons into their family tree, to make sure he knows where he comes from and all. He said it was really boring, but I kind of envy him. I have no idea who my family was. Luckily Sirius loves talking about you two. He has all these amazing stories of how he ruled the school together with you, dad.
Harry looks up from the parchment. Hermione and Ron are whispering about the werewolf essay. Neville and Harry finished that ages ago. It’s not that hard to write about a werewolf when you’ve grown up with one being your uncle. Neville eats a sandwich, and Harry should also take one. He’s got Quidditch practise in thirty minutes, and Wood will kill him if he’s late again.
“Will you stop pretending that you are still on Voldemort’s side of this war,” Harry snaps. He steps away from Draco and paces across the room. “You’re not going to kill Dumbledore, you won’t have to.”
Harry looks down at Malfoy. He looks kind of peaceful now that he’s passed out. Harry wishes he would just pass out. That it would all be over. He wants his mother’s screams to stop. He doesn’t want to live now that all his friends are dead. He will never be happy again. It would be better if it was done. If Harry would die today at least he won’t have to live the rest of his life alone.
Draco made red sparks come from his wand while we were running. We didn’t stop until we were almost back at the spot where we had split up from the others and Hagrid was running towards us. I fell to my knees when I saw him and Draco kneeled down next to me. He asked me if I was alright because I was holding my free hand over my scar. The other one was still in Draco’s hand. I told him my scar hurt but that I was fine. That the pain was already going away.
He also told us that one day Sirius played a trick on professor Snape that almost got him killed if it hadn’t been for you, dad. If you hadn’t saved him. This really pissed of Draco, he said you don’t play tricks on people if it can lethally hurt them. That only stupid Gryffindors do that. Off course that set of Ron, who defended his house. Lupin got them back on the subjects of Scabbers and there was a whole explanation why Scabbers was Peter. Draco stepped in somewhere saying it was all a bit weird that Peter had tried to fake his death twice. Because why would he do that? Lupin answered him that it was because Peter had betrayed you, that he was the reason both of you are dead.
It’s still a couple of weeks away from Draco’s due date, but Harry wishes it was here already. He wants to meet the little girl hiding away in his belly. Even though Harry will miss the sight of Draco being pregnant. Draco doesn’t believe Harry, but he’s beautiful with his massive belly. If it wasn’t for the fact that Draco is exhausted most days when Harry comes home, Harry would show him just how beautiful he is. But for the last couple of weeks, Harry has been forced to take out his urge to fuck Draco by wanking in the shower until the urge goes away.
Teddy sits in front of the coffee table. His crayons spread out over the entire surface, a blank piece of parchment in front of him. Two finished drawings lay next to Draco on the sofa. The first one is a dragon, the one Harry had defeated when he was still in school. The second one is the one Draco wants to tear apart. Teddy had drawn a house that looks just like the one they are in now. In front of it are Harry and Draco. Harry, with a massive lightning bolt on his forehead and Draco, with white hair. Teddy is in it too, holding Draco’s hand. And that is all fine. Draco has seen many drawings that feature him and Harry. But this one is different. In the background sits a large dog. When Draco asked about it, Teddy shook his head and said it was a wolf, just like daddy. The wolf has a puppy on his back. Teddy said it was his baby brother that is now in heaven. And ever since Teddy spoke those words, Draco hasn’t been able to take his eyes off the drawing and the representation of his unborn baby. The baby Draco lost. The little brother he stole away from Teddy.
And then Hermione gave us quite the scare. She screamed and almost dropped the milk. It turned out that Scabbers, Ron’s rat was hiding in the milk jug she just took from the cabinet. The rat looked dreadful. He was thinner than we’d ever seen it and it writhed in Hermione’s hands as though it was desperate to free himself.
The next two days I hid away, thanking Myrtle for letting me hang out with her so much. She said it was nice, to have company so often. So I survived the weekend. But then Monday came and somehow they had managed to put Sleeping Draught in some of the snacks I had saved for later. One moment I was eating and the next I was fast asleep. They took me outside in my pyjama and strapped me against a tree. When I woke up I was freezing cold and I had no way of getting loose. I screamed for help only to hear laughter from behind some of the bushes nearby. Nott even screamed: ‘so where is your big bad monster now when you need saving, Scarhead?’
Neville, Hermione and Ron noticed. They shake their heads and whisper among each other when they think Harry isn’t paying them any attention. But they don’t say a word to Harry, or tell him to stop. And Harry kind of loves them for that. They know him well enough to know that this is just something Harry needs to do.
Ginny sighs but doesn’t move. Harry sits back up and tries to smile at Neville, but his mouth won’t cooperate. This is harder than he expected it to be.
Draco pours himself another glass of wine. Pansy’s glass is still mostly full. It’s like she’s not drinking at all.
“Yes, I already yelled at Dumbledore about this,” James says. “And where is Madam Pomfrey. I need a full report on your health.” James walks past Harry and Draco towards Madam Pomfrey’s office.
“And will you stop sugar coating everything? The order is not going to risks anyone's life just to get my mother out of the manor. You and I both know that. So what choice does that give me? Do you truly think this stupid crush is more important than my mother?”
Oh, I must tell you about Fred and George, you remember Ron’s brothers. They are the only students, next to Hermione, that don’t think I am the heir of Slytherin. They make jokes about it all the time. When they see me walking down a corridor, they come to march ahead of me, shouting: ‘Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through.’ And making jokes like: ‘Harry’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea whit his fanged servant.’  It makes me feel a little better to know that there are at least two other people that think it’s ludicrous that I’m the heir of Slytherin.
“I can’t tell you what to do,” James starts. His eyebrows draw together and he leans a little closer to Harry. “But if it’s true, and Draco doesn’t want anything to do with you now that he knows you’re gay, you need to leave it be. Even though you have a massive crush on him.”
Draco gave me my notebook after that, saying he was sure I would like to tell my parents about everything that had happened. I thanked him and wanted to say he was right, but Madam Pomfrey bustled over and told Draco and Hermione to go, that they had been in for nearly fifteen minutes and that I needed my rest. When they were leaving Draco said he hoped I could join him for the end-of-year feast tomorrow.
“Your father speaks highly of you,” the Dark Lord says as he walks past the dresser. His finger slides over the top as if he’s inspecting it for dust. “You made him a proud man.”
When Draco and his father had left and Mr Borgin had returned to the back room I slipped out of the cabinet and the shop. I had ended up in an alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. And people were staring at me. It was creepy, so I started off in hopefully the right direction. I just wanted to get out of the alley and find Draco, hopefully without his father, so I could talk to him.
Harry clutches Remus his clothes in his hands. He doesn’t want Remus to let him go. He lets out an uncontrollable whimper and closes his eyes.
The Dark Lord’s steps are calculated. He moves slowly towards the bed. Narcissa sits up straight and tries to block the Dark Lord’s view of Draco. Draco puts his hand on Narcissa’s back. “It’s fine, mum,” he says. He knew this moment had to come someday. Maybe it’s better that it comes this soon. At least now Draco doesn’t have to pretend anymore. The prospect of reuniting with his lover gives him the courage he never thought he had.
“Well, Pettigrew used to be friends with Remus, Sirius and dad,” Harry says. “And when they found out about Remus’ condition, they illegally became Animagi so they could join him on the full moon, to make sure that Remus wouldn’t be alone.”
“You think mum will be upset when she finds out that Ginny likes girls? She still hasn’t got over that day that Charlie told her he will never marry a girl and give her grandchildren,” Fred continues.
Harry’s hands are turning blue from the cold and he struggles to hold on to his broom. The Dementors come closer. Harry can see them now, even in the dark. Screams enter Harry’s mind. His mother’s screams. Of that night when she was tortured. Harry can hardly remember. He was too small to know what was happening. But now he can hear it all. The pain and despair of his mother. It makes it harder to concentrate. Which way is down?
Harry grins. ‘It’s a good thing,’ he writes. ‘This way you can beat her on this essay and she will be all upset.’
Neville and Harry laugh as Hermione wrinkles her nose and looks away from Ron. Her eyes are cold as she takes the dish with meatballs from Harry. Harry gives them up without a fight and moves on to the greens. Dinner passes in good fun. Hermione forgets her dislike of Ron’s eating habits and Neville talks away about his new book about plants that Professor Sprout recommended to him.
And then you stepped out of the wand, mom. My hand trembled then, and I almost let go. But you said that dad was coming, that he wanted to see me too. So I fought to hold on. I wanted to see dad too. And just thinking about it, makes me miss you so much. I hope it truly was you that came to help me from beyond. And it was good to see you and to hear you speak to me. I just wish you were here now too. That you could hold me and tell me that everything will be alright. Because I don’t think it will be for a long time and I don’t want to think about what that means for me and Draco. I don’t want a war. I don’t want anyone else to die.
“Don’t tell me it wasn’t him the Dementors were after,” Neville says. “He’s a Malfoy and a Slytherin.”
Harry doesn’t look at her. His eyes are locked with Draco’s. Draco lifts his hands and signs “You okay?” Harry nods his head and then smiles. Then he points towards Draco. Draco first nods but then he shakes his head. He grabs his bag and pulls out his parchment and quill.
Harry doesn’t respond. He’s busy reading the friendly words of his uncle. Harry hadn’t told him about Malfoy, but of course, Remus has told Sirius. And now Sirius is offering his help. Sirius says he has his doubts, the boy is a Malfoy of course. But he knows Harry and what he’s like when he’s set his mind to something. He gives tips for some helpful books to get from the library to help with the      communication problems. And if the library doesn’t have the books, Harry should let him know and he will send them along with Remus as Sirius owns them all.
“He hates me,” Harry whispers. Fresh tears well up. Harry doesn’t care that he’s in the middle of the hallway and that everyone can see him. Neville pulls Harry into a tight hug. Ron and Hermione join them. Harry hides between them as he sobs. It’s sweet and well meant, only it doesn’t comfort Harry. His heart just broke into a million pieces and he doesn’t know how it will ever heal and be whole again.
They left me alone during Herbology since Ron had pulled me to their side of the greenhouse. He said he wished I was in Gryffindor with him. But we didn’t have a lot of time to catch up, because professor Sprout gave a lecture about Herbology safety. After class, I walked with the Gryffindor’s to our last lesson of the day, Transfiguration. This is taught by Professor McGonagall. She’s a strict and clever teacher. This class I was able to sit down next to Zabini. Like I told you before, he’s the only Slytherin boy that doesn’t bully me. We had to take a lot of notes and at the end of class, we tried to turn a match into a needle. Only the smart Gryffindor girl had made any progress. Her match was silver and pointy.
“Whatever you say. Just catch the Snitch already,” George shouts before he’s off to aim a Bludger at Flint who tries to score for Slytherin.
But the good memories get clouded by the horrible ones. He remembers all the times he yelled at Vincent when he did something wrong in Draco’s eyes. And how he ignored his friends in sixth year because he didn’t think he could trust them, that they wouldn’t have understood that he had to do it, to save his mother. And the fire. Draco will never be able to forget the fire. Or the sight of horror on Vincent’s face when he slipped from Draco’s hand and fell into the flames.
Hermione and Neville fall in line with Harry before he exits the Great Hall and turns towards the stairs that will lead him to the History of Magic classroom.
And then last Sunday happened. Everyone was off to breakfast and Malfoy and I were alone in our dormitory. He was sitting on his bed, working on our Potions homework when he suddenly started speaking. He said he hadn’t read through my notebook, he just took it to keep it safe. And that he had seen the invisibility cloak when he was searching for the notebook, and knowing that Nott would destroy that too if he would find it, he hid it as well. I thanked him for keeping them safe. And I also thanked him for finding Snape when I went missing. He looked away then, saying it was nothing. That he should have stopped them in the first place. That he was the one that had started it all in September, and that if he hadn’t this would have never happened. He didn’t say sorry, but I don’t think Malfoy has ever said sorry for anything in his life, but only admitting that he was partly at fold was already a big deal for him.
Harry puts his book down and strokes his hand over Draco's back. He leans over and places a kiss on Draco's neck, just below his hairline. Draco used to love it when Harry would do that before sex became a necessary evil. Now it’s just a reminder of how big a failure Draco has become. He doesn’t want this to last. He just wants Harry to dump his sperm inside him. What does it matter if Draco enjoys it or not?
“I just thought that I was the one helping him,” Harry says. “But the truth is, that I need him more than he ever needed me.”
I took off the hat and walked towards the Slytherin table with shaking legs. Draco Malfoy, the nasty boy is in Slytherin. Most people at the Slytherin table were clapping, but Malfoy just looked at me with a piercing look. I set down next to Theo Nott, who was also sorted in Slytherin. Malfoy said I better start behaving like a real Slytherin if I wanted to survive my first year.
“I’ve got you something special,” Harry tells Draco when he places a small package in his hands. Draco’s hands shake when he takes off the silver paper and opens the box in front of him. Inside is a silver necklace with a beautiful stag. The eyes of the animal are diamonds. Draco caresses it with his finger. It must have cost a fortune.
And that is not all. I’m nervous, like all the time. I feel like my whole life has been heading up to, and will finish with, the first task of this stupid tournament. And now that I know what the task is, it has only gotten worse. I have to go and face a dragon. A real dragon. And they are enormous and wild. I know this thanks to Hagrid. He made come to his cabin at midnight last weekend and asked me to take my cloak with me. Draco helped me get out of the dungeon close to midnight and then I was off to see Hagrid. When I got to his place he told me to follow him but to stay quiet and hidden under my cloak.
And you will never believe what I found under my sheets. Neatly folded with a note on it saying: just in case. It was my invisibility cloak. I was so happy to have it back. That and the fact that Draco is talking to me again make everything just a little easier. We are still scared about Voldemort coming back and I’m still going crazy from all the studying, but Draco is helping me again. He also noticed that Nott was hitting me again and he now makes sure I’m never alone in the dormitory. We study together almost all the time. Hermione said she misses me, so I told Draco I’ll have to go study with her tomorrow. But for now, we are just hanging on Draco’s bed trying to remember the names of Jupiter’s moon and all the other stuff we need to know for our exams. They will start in two weeks, so I probably won’t write again until after.
They reach the castle doors and aren’t surprised to find Ron sitting on the steps. He looks up from his book as they reach him.
“Harry James Potter, you are brought before the Wizengamot to be trailed for the crimes you committed. I understand that you have waived the right to have an attorney present. Is that correct?” Shacklebolt says.
Draco stops in front of the picture of Lupin and Tonks. Teddy puts his small hand next to them and smiles at them. “Hi, mom and dad. I’m going to be a big brother,” he tells the picture. “Can’t stay, uncle Harry is making grilled cheese sandwishes.”
Nobody will sit next to Draco tonight. He’ll cry all alone for losing his first love. A love he wasn’t allowed to have, a love that was worth losing everything.
Draco took me to bed that night. He kissed me and told me everything would be alright. He kept petting my hair until I fell asleep. Not that I had a good night of sleep. No, first I had a nightmare in which I had overslept and that they had to use Crabbe instead. And then I dreamed that the entire Gryffindor team showed up on flying lions that could spit fire. I tried to get away from them but I had seemed to have forgotten my Firebolt and I fell to the ground at rapid speed.
Draco took my hand and pulled me into the woods. When I looked at him he had tears streaming down his cheeks and I stopped him when we had just passed the first line of trees. I could hear children crying, anxious shouts and panicked voices all around us, but at that moment I only had eyes for Draco. He muttered he was sorry and I took him in my arms, told him he had nothing to be sorry for. And then he said that he had, that his father was probably one of the people torturing those muggles. I didn’t know what to say to Draco at that point. I don’t blame him for what his father does, and I hate how it hurts Draco, but he was right. Draco’s father was most likely the one organising the masked parade.
Inside the house, I ended up in a room with boarded-up windows. There was a chair, a giant snake and that traitor Wormtail. A cold, high-pitched voice spoke to him. Told him he was lucky, that his blunder hadn’t ruined everything. He still got tortured, but I didn’t felt sorry for him. I hate that man. He’s worse than the Dark Lord for betraying the both of you. But I did feel his pain as my scar burned on my forehead. I screamed until I heard Draco’s voice, screaming my voice, telling me to wake up.
And there is another image Draco doesn’t need. “Not the dining table we still have in our house?” Draco asks. The one Harry brought along when they moved into their own house.
Draco turns so he can look at Teddy. The boy is in his dragon pyjamas and holds Teddy-bear in his small hand. Draco kneels in front of him, and Teddy falls into his arms. “I love you, Draco. Don’t be sad.”
By then my eyes had gotten used to the dark and I could see what the plant was doing. It was twisting its snakelike tendrils around our legs. Only Hermione managed to jump up in time to get to safety. Ron and I tried to get the plant of us, but the more we pulled and struggled, the tighter and faster the plant wounded around us.
“Just cry, it’s okay,” he says knowing Malfoy can’t hear him. He laughs softly. Uncle Remus once told Harry how he still talks to Sirius when Sirius can’t see his lips move, knowing Sirius can’t hear, but somehow hoping he knows he’s loved and cherished.
Hermione is somewhere in this room. He’s seen the paper when she was elected into the Wizengamot. Harry was proud of her. Still is. But that doesn’t matter now. She will not give him any favours. She will hear his testimony and know she won’t be able to claim he’s innocent. Because he isn’t.
When the bead touched Voldemort’s wand, smoke came out of it. First, a hand appeared, and then the smoke turned into Cedric. He stepped out of the wand and told me to hold on. Next, the old man I had seen in my dream during summer stepped out of the wand, followed by Bertha Jorkins. She also told me to hold on. Her voice sounded from far away, it even had a little echo, just like Cedric’s voice had sounded before.
“And what if it is because I died during the war? What if it’s because I once housed a part of Voldemort’s soul inside my body? Who knows how that fucked me up,” Harry says.
Harry laughs. “No, only Crouch junior thought that was a good idea. Sirius has a better trick. He’s an Animagus. He turns into this beautiful black dog.”
Harry is a fool. He’s halfway between the castle and the Quidditch field when he stops in his tracks. If it was him, he would take the map and hunt down Pettigrew. No matter the promise they made. And Neville is just like Harry, maybe even worse when it comes to Pettigrew. He wants justice and revenge. Neville isn’t going to go to Uncle Remus. Neville is probably on his way to the Hufflepuff common room to end Pettigrew once and for all, right now.
"No, he's not, " Harry says. "And he won't, he's hurting but he's not stupid." Harry doesn’t know if he still believes that himself. Every time he goes to work, he’s afraid he’s going to come home to an empty house. That Draco will be gone to find a potion that will make him stop feeling a thing. Or find him high, or dead in their bed, as it looks like Draco doesn’t care at all anymore.
We have lots of homework during these Easter holidays, so all of us agreed it would be best to stay at the school and study together. We just get a lot more done when we can help each other. I don’t know how Hermione manages with all her extra classes. Draco and I have gotten extra homework and I have no idea when to do it all. First off, I’m back to somewhat more regular visits to Miss Davis. I see her once a month now, just to make sure I’m dealing in a healthy way with this bond thing and the TriWizard tournament. She doesn’t give me that much homework, but she does want me to keep a track of when I’m feeling down or overwhelmed with everything and what is happening at those moments to talk them over in our therapy.
Neville is a big fan of Herbology. He loves plants and I like partnering with him for this class. He knows a lot about the subject. We’ve been working with Wormwood, Mandrake Root and Dittany. We’ve also had theory lessons about the severing charm. I’m not sure what I think of it, I don’t think I have the green fingers necessary for this subject.
And yes, you read it right, I said painting my nails. It was a little after the second tasks that Draco, Greg, Daphne and I were sitting at the same table in the common room. Draco, Greg and I were doing some homework while Daphne was painting her nails. And for some time I wondered what it would look like if I would paint my nails. Not in the bright red’s and purple’s Daphne paints them, but in Slytherin green, or something else dark. So I asked Daphne if she had any dark green nail polish that I could borrow to paint my nails. She didn’t, but she got Millicent involved who did have darker colours of nail polish. That night Daphne and Millicent tried to teach me how to paint my nails, but I’m rubbish at it. That’s when Draco pitched in and let Daphne and Millicent show him how to do it. Ever since that night, he takes care of the paint on my nails as I take care of his hair. So each morning I braid his hair and once a week he fixes my nails. Millicent showed us where we can order the kind of nail polish I want to wear. Some other students think it’s stupid that a guy wears nail polish, but I like it. And Draco says it looks good on me, so I don’t see any reason to stop.
Harry shrugs. The big word is out there. And Neville already knows, and Hermione suspects. It’s only fair, to be honest about this too. “Maybe,” he says.
Draco nods and then is consumed again with pain. He squeezes Harry’s hand. It’s a miracle that he hasn’t crushed it yet. It must hurt, but Harry doesn’t complain.
I think it was a good thing that Wood was a keeper because he looked like he wanted to hurt one of our team. Points went back and forth for some time, but Slytherin stayed in the lead. If was just never enough to win the cup. So even though I spotted the snitch a couple of times, I didn’t chase it. Every time I spotted it I faked a look of concentration and pulled my Firebolt around toward the other side of the field. McLaggen kept following me, not spotting the snitch but being stupid enough to think I would lead him to it. Like he could outfly me if I would spot it first.
Draco looks up at Harry and shakes his head. “No, Harry. You love Christmas dinners at the Weasleys. I won’t ask you to stay away from it.”
Ron picks up on the second ring. "Hey Harry, what's up? Forgot to send your presents to the Burrow?"
“GET OUT!” Draco yells. How dare she turn this around. Pansy never needed Draco. She just liked to use him whenever she’d screwed up. And Draco is sick of it. Of all of it. He’s been nothing but a friend to Pansy in all the years they’ve known each other. And now she’s done the worst thing possible, getting pregnant just to show that she can have what Draco isn’t capable of.
After the game, Draco said goodnight to his parents and we made our way back to the campsite. Mr Tonks made us all some hot chocolate and I think he spiked the once of all the adults and we had some conversations about the game. When we finished our drinks Sirius told us it was time for bed and Draco and I slipped into the tent. We got into our bed and Draco told me he wanted to become a professional Quidditch player one day. His eyes shown and his smile was wide and gorgeous. I told him that I’m sure he will be one day, that he’s an amazing Chaser. We kissed and moved together until pleasure took over before we fell asleep.
“Fine, I’ll go make breakfast. Strawberry pancakes with syrup?” Harry gets up and moves towards the kitchen.
Except for the boy that refused to be his friend. The famous Harry Potter. Draco took out his frustration of missing the dead of all those silly Muggles out on him. He did everything in his power to make Potter’s life more difficult. It was fun to fight with Potter. His temper reminded Draco of how his father would get when a potion hadn’t turned out the way he wanted. The only annoying part was that Potter somehow always got away with his behaviour. So at night, Draco dreamed of Potter in the cell at the Manor, screaming in pain from a deadly potion for days before he would die.
Malfoy sits bent over a book. His quill slides in quick notions over the parchment next to him. Harry smiles as he sits opposite Malfoy and pulls out some parchment of his own.
Hermione finally looks at him and it’s clear she can see what the problem is straight away. “Of course not,” she says. “You said you didn’t want him to know.”
“I love you too.” Draco chokes on his words. He wishes it wasn’t so, that he could just get up and leave. That way, Harry wouldn’t have to choose between his family and Draco. Then Harry would be able to find someone that can give him that perfect family he deserves.
He turns and runs away. He falls on his knees between the first trees of the Forbidden Forest. Nobody will follow him in here. And he will only stay for a short while. He should be safe for just a few minutes. Just a couple of minutes to get himself back under control. To fight the tears that keep coming. To stop the heartache inside him, to forget the hollowness that consumes him.
“Of course Tedster,” Pansy answers and then she turns back to swirling around her glass of wine. Draco shakes his head and gets up. He sits down next to Teddy on the floor.
The Easter holiday didn’t feel like a holiday at all. We had so much homework we spend most of our time in the library studying. And when we weren’t studying, Draco and I had Quidditch practise. Hermione seemed to live in the library. She was always already there when Draco and I would finally get out of bed. And she never left before us. I think she was close to tears most of the time. I tried talking to her about her workload, but she just snapped at me and told me to leave her alone.
Hermione picks up the fabric and turns it around in her hand. “It’s the same material as our robes,” she says. “Why would someone send you a small piece of robe fabric?”
Warning that contains spoilers coming up. I've included a new tag on this story because Harry is getting a little more sexually active. He's a thirteen-year-old boy in love and can't help himself. It's all still very innocent, but if you don't like that cup of tea, just stop reading where Harry tells his mother that it might be better if she stops reading.
Ginny is okay now, George told me she is just sad that I don’t fancy her, but that she will get over it. I hope she does, I never mend to hurt her. He and Fred also assured me that Ron will come around, probably very quickly because my new broom is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. I’m glad the twins don’t treat me any differently than before. They are asleep now, it’s already very late, but I just can’t sleep. I keep thinking about how Draco didn’t say one word to me. I want him to talk to me. I don’t want to have to share a dorm room with him this year and not be able to fall down on his bed to complain about Hermione her study schedules. Or not get his help with Potions, he’s been the only one who has been able to make that subject make sense for me. And I want to see him smile at me, I want him to hold my hand during breakfast and dinner. And I want to hear him complain about headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall and how they always seem to favour Gryffindor students. But it looks like I won’t have all that this year and now I don’t know if I want to go back to Hogwarts. Because it’s just going to hurt, seeing him without being able to hang out with him. I’m afraid it’s going to be worse than just missing him.
Harry shakes his head. He can’t give up now. So, he tears off another piece of parchment. He scribbles down that he doesn’t mind clearing time in his schedule for Malfoy and then folds the paper into a little aeroplane. When Trelawney has her back turned to the class Harry flies the plane to Malfoy who catches it with ease. He would make a good Seeker with reflexes like that. Harry smiles at him and is happy to see that Malfoy opens the note. He stares back at Harry, his eyes wide and horrified. And then he picks up his quill and starts to write. Harry turns around again with a grin on his face. He’s made Malfoy talk back to him.
We both got new ropes at Madam Malkin’s, standing next to each other while she fitted us. We had to laugh about how that is where we first met and how we both got the wrong idea about who the other is. Draco’s mom made sure that I got the same quality robes as Draco, they are way better than the ones I had last year. Not itchy at all. Draco’s mom also ordered some basic clothes for me at Madam Malkin’s, and she promised to send them to Hogwarts as soon as they are finished. Draco says I’m finally going to look sharp.
“Fucking Merlin,” Ron says and he climbs over the table so he can help keep Neville in the Great Hall.
Neville says Harry is obsessed. And maybe he is. Harry doesn’t care. He needs to get to the bottom of this. It’s the same as first year when he had to know what was hidden underneath that trapped door. Or who was after it. And it reminds Harry of second year when he just had to know who was the heir of Slytherin. Because he was pretty sure that Neville wasn’t it. And now he just needs to know how Malfoy manages and why he won’t let Harry help him. Harry can’t help it, it’s just in his nature. And at least with this obsession, there is no way that Neville will get hurt because of it. No, this obsessing will make his mother proud, instead of what happens most of the time, which is her being upset that Harry is so much like his father and always gets everyone mixed up in something dangerous.
I hate my life right now. What is it worth being alive when I can’t go back to Hogwarts? When I can never find out why Draco didn’t write to me. When I will never see my friends again. Maybe it would have been better if I had died when Voldemort killed both of you, or when I met him again only two months ago. Then I wouldn’t be alone and locked up now, but with both of you. That sounds so much better than this.
It’s the right thing to say. Draco brightens up and then moves in to kiss Harry. Harry lets him. They might not kiss for some time after this. Harry will ask his parents if Draco can come to visit. But Draco’s parents might not agree to it, and then they won’t see each other for two months. So Harry makes sure that Draco knows he’s loved before he has to go to a home where love seems to be lacking.
We had to undergo all kind of silly test the weekend after the task. Some people of the Ministry came to oversee them. And Sirius and Draco’s mom were there. I think that was the first time they’ve seen each other in years. They first didn’t know how to interact with each other. Draco’s mom was extremely polite, just like Draco was in the beginning with Sirius. I made Draco laugh. I love it when he laughs. He’s so beautiful, mom. I want to look at him for the rest of my life. And now that we know about our soul bond, I think I will. I know I will never love anyone the way I love him. And yes, I know we’re only fourteen. But there is no denying it anymore, we’re made for each other.
The final is at the end of this month. We are up against Gryffindor and I really hope we win. Marcus has us do extra training sessions on Saturdays. But that’s fine. I like being able to fly this much, and Draco is with me on the team so we get to spend all that time together.
And now it’s time for Harry to just agree so he utters an okay. He gets it. He wants to find Pettigrew too and hurt him for all he’s done to this family. “We’ll do it together,” he says.
“Ron already thinks I’m seeing someone,” Harry says without looking at Hermione. “I don’t want him to get the wrong idea. He’ll just make fun of it.”
Draco shakes his head and then takes Harry’s hand back in his. They walk through the train until they find an empty compartment. Draco closes the door and then continues to lock it with his wand.
Draco nods. “I hadn’t expected it all to be that violent. And for him to be so cruel to his followers.”
I can tell you that there is no way anyone is ever going to control me by the Imperius Curse. Professor Moody put it on me four times during lessons to show others how to fight it. It was really weird, being under the Imperius Curse. It was like all my worries and thoughts floated away and left in place a vague, untraceable happiness. I wasn’t really aware anymore of the people around me and then Moody told me to jump on a desk. And I just thought that was stupid, why would I jump on a desk? There was no reason for it. So I kind of jumped and tried to stop from jumping at the same time and smashed headlong into the desk. I could feel it in my knees for the rest of that day.
"Blaise is worried about him. We all are. If there's anything we can do to help, you'll let us know, won't you?" Ginny asks.
Blaise doesn’t react to Harry’s snappy tone. He might remember too how he failed Draco the last time around. And Harry is glad that Blaise changes the subject of their conversation. Harry only listens with half an ear. His eyes focus back on Draco. Maybe he should sit with him and stop him from scratching his arm open. Only Harry isn't sure if Draco won't snap if he does. It’s harder and harder each day to find out what is still acceptable in Draco’s eyes.
I’ve been thinking a lot about the package that Hagrid and headmaster Dumbledore are hiding in the castle. I’m sure by now that Snape is after it. When I was dragging myself back towards the dungeon one evening after dinner I passed Snape his office. The door was ajar and I could hear him talking to someone. I decided to listen in and to take a peek through the open door. Filch was with him and Snape was holding his robes above his knees, making it possible to see the bloody and mangled wound on one of his legs. And then he wondered out loud how he was supposed to keep his eyes on all three heads at once. So he had tried to get past the dog again. I told Hermione, Ron and Neville the next day. Hermione is convinced I’m wrong. In her eyes, teachers can do no wrong, but Ron thinks I have a point and Neville agrees too. He’s afraid of Snape, ever since his potions incident during the first week at Hogwarts.
It’s only since last weekend that everything seems to go wrong. It started last Saturday when I went out to fly my new broom, in the hope it would help me take my mind of Draco. It didn’t. All I could think of was how badly I wanted to fly together with him. He’s so talented on a broom. I’ve been coming to look at most of his Quidditch training. He’s noticed me there. He always looks around the stands until he finds me when he comes on the field and then just tries not to look at me for the entire training. Pansy and Daphne are also always at the training, cheering Draco on. I wish I could cheer with them. Hermione says I should stop going, that it’s not healthy. I should just forget about him and move on. Like it’s that easy. I still have the nightmares, only the situations keep changing. Sometimes we are sitting in the Great Hall having dinner and I look away for a second and then Draco is gone. I then run out of the Great Hall, looking for him, but he has just vanished. Or he’s playing Quidditch and suddenly his broom would be empty. I hate them, the nightmares. What if they are a bad omen? Like my nightmares from last year, that warned me about the danger that was coming? What if Draco really is going to disappear? I don’t think I want to live in a world that doesn’t have Draco in it.
The days after Christmas showed a more active Draco. He started to rise from bed before noon and even agreed to go to the new year's party organised by Blaise and Ginny. Harry began to believe that perhaps Ron was right, and all Draco needed was some time to heal. But seeing him now, alone on a lounge chair, his eyes blank, ignoring everyone around him, clearly not enjoying himself, Harry isn’t so sure anymore.
“She’s been keeping me up at night,” Draco says. Harry looks at him and sees the dark circles below his eyes.
Neville holds up his hands. “Don’t worry, I won’t say a word,” he says. “Don’t freak out. Just know you can talk to me if you have to.”
“That his father acts as if he isn’t deaf,” Harry says. “He’s supposed to be the one to help him the most. And the only thing he does is make it worse.” A tear escapes Harry’s eye and he hurries to wipe it away before Remus will notice.
And then we pulled into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station. All our friends got off the train until it was just me and Draco left. He said he was going to miss me and then he kissed me on my cheek, just before he walked out of the compartment. I just sat there for a while. My hand went to my left cheek where Draco had just kissed it. What did it mean? It made my stomach flutter and my heart pound. Is that what it feels like when you love someone? I should have asked Hermione how she knows that she loves Ron back at school.
They go to the Quidditch World Cup final. The game is amazing and Harry has a great time. He spots Lucius Malfoy with his wife. Harry’s heart speeds up while he searches if Draco is with them, but they appear to be alone. Harry is disappointed, but when the night turns into a riot and the Dark Mark appears in the sky, Harry is glad that Draco wasn’t there to witness it all.
Hermione, Ron, Neville, Blaise, Draco and I all shared a compartment in the Hogwarts Express. We talked and laughed and eat so much candy. It was a lot of fun. Draco said he would ask his parents if we could have a birthday party for me at his house this summer and promised to owl all of us as soon as he had tricked them into saying yes. Blaise was off to Spain for the summer with his mother; Ron would stay home and enjoy the countryside with his brothers; Neville was going home to his gran and Hermione said she was going to help her parents in their dentist practice. She had to explain to the others what a dentist is. I was glad the conversation turned to muggle health care after that, so I didn’t have to tell them that I was going to spend my summer feeling miserable at my aunt and uncle’s place.
“Did you truly already finish all your homework?” Hermione asks when Harry again changes position on the couch.
The Dark Lord won’t say anything about Draco’s refusal to enter his mind with so many people around. But they won’t stay. And if it’s just them, the Dark Lord would surely punish him for shutting him out. Draco will suffer through it all, but he won’t share his true feelings. He can never let them slip. The Dark Lord will never find out how Draco’s heart is broken beyond repair, or about how Draco had begged Harry not to let go. He will only get to see the strong and proud Draco, a true Malfoy, one worthy of his alliance.
Days later, Harry gets another anonymous package. He opens it and finds a small book about snakes inside. Harry shivers as he remembers the snake in his dream last night. To large and old to be natural, slowly swallowing Harry’s body after Voldemort had killed him, making it impossible for Harry to return to the living. Sometimes Harry things he’s still dead, that all this is a dream. But then he wakes up screaming in his bed and he knows he’s still alive.
“I guessed that, as he’s part of the Defence Against the Dark Arts class,” Harry says. He takes another look and then walks back to his seat. He scrapes his throat. “I wanted to ask you something,” he says.
“You will,” Hermione tells him when she joins them. “You’re not copying my work again. Professor McGonagall will notice.”
“Say goodbye to your boyfriend, Harry,” Ron says as he passes them towards the stairs. “You’ll see him again during dinner.”
The nightmares are getting worse, by the way. The ones with Draco disappearing. They wake me up almost every night now. And I just have to get up and check that Draco is still in his bed. It just feels so real, the dreams. They scare me, dad. Do you think it’s a bad omen? Should I be worried, or is it just because I’ve lost him? Am I dreaming him disappearing because he doesn’t like me anymore? Because he hates me now?
Harry shakes his head and looks back at his brother. “It’s fine,” he says even though it’s not. Harry had hoped that this new focus, that their search for Pettigrew, would help him forget about Draco and the pain inside his heart. But it doesn’t. Everything seems dull without Draco. Harry can’t put his mind at rest, always dreaming of Draco and what could have been.
Quidditch practise was every day during the holidays. Marcus wanted us to be ready for the match on the 23rd. We’d have endless discussions about tactics and Marcus kept drilling into me that I was only allowed to catch the snitch if we were more than 50 points ahead of Gryffindor. They had a lead of 200 points, so we needed more than that to win the cup this year. Draco would hide his laughter against my shoulders every time Marcus brought it up again.
“So, he is?” Hermione asks. “He is a.” She looks around them. There are too many people here to say it out loud. “You know what I mean,” she finishes.
Nathan just puts his thumb in his mouth and Harry shakes his head. “I’ll ask your daddy tonight when you and Lily are asleep. And then we can stop this Sissy nonsense.”
This is when Draco remembered that Voldemort had summoned his followers, and he asked if his father had been there. I just nodded, I didn’t want to tell him how his father had spoken about Draco. Greg didn’t need to be told, he just said that his father would have come too. Then Millicent said she was sure her dad would too. And then Neville did the most amazing thing, he said that didn’t matter, as long as they all knew what was important, and that if they needed, they could all come to stay at his place to stay safe. And that is how I know I have the best of friends, and that even if things will take a turn for the worse now, I’m not alone. None of us is.
“Harry, if young Malfoy’s family is anything close to Sirius’ family, he’s been raised to believe that a man is only allowed to marry a woman,” Remus says. Harry sits up a little straighter so he can look at Remus. Remus his features are soft and he keeps steady eye contact with Harry.
Harry doesn’t hesitate and runs down the stairs. He turns to his left and then stops in his tracks. Draco stands in the middle of the hallway, with his wand in front of him. Neville lays on the floor only a couple of meters away from him. He isn’t moving. Is Harry too late? Is Neville already dead? And is Pettigrew still here? Is that why Draco has his wand out?
Harry flies them over the Great Lake and then back to the Quidditch field. He lands softly. Draco lets go of him and Harry doesn’t want to admit that he misses the arms around him straight away. But then he looks at Draco. His cheeks are flushed and his hair is blown out by the wind. And there is a massive grin on his face.
Harry grins and takes his quill. ‘You don’t want Gryffindor to win?’ Harry writes. He’s laughing as he slides the parchment back to Malfoy who just rolls his eyes and points to his tie.
By Wednesday Malfoy started to call me Scarface all the time. He joked that the lighting scar was the only pretty thing about me. Since I have horrible black hair that looks like a raven landed on my head. And my eyes are so poor that it’s a shame the glasses don’t hide them any better from view.
Only Draco doesn’t look up. His shoulders shudder. And Harry can’t have that. He steps off his bed and walks to the other side of the room. He stops in front of Draco’s bed. Draco cries and Harry wants to hug him. Harry lifts his arm and reaches out. Softly he ticks on Draco’s shoulder.
“Harry, don’t be stupid,” a familiar voice says. Harry looks to Shacklebolt’s left and sees Hermione sitting there. She looks older. More mature. Life has done her good. Harry wonders if she and Ron have stayed together. He can’t remember if the article about her appointment into the Wizengamot that he’d read years ago said anything about her private life.
Ginny gets up and places a kiss on top of Harry’s head. “I’m off, gay boy,” she says. “Please explain to my brother why we will never be and that it’s okay. I’ve got Nargles to catch.”
Their lips meet and Harry forgets all about London. That night he dreams of Draco’s hand on his, of the promise to spend the next night together on the astronomy tower. The night will be special. Draco promised. Something about the new moon and how much brighter the stars will be. What Harry didn’t expect is to find a blanket surrounded by flying candles. Pillows soft and comfortable to sit upon, a picnic basket filled with fruits and snacks. Draco holds his hand and caresses his neck.
“Oh shut up, Bill. I’ve already hugged Draco when I helped him make his lemonade look like wine so all of you won’t get suspicious before Teddy could make his announcement,” Molly says.
In the end, Slytherin won the match and Draco came to greet me with a sweaty kiss before heading to the showers. Daphne and Hermione wooed us and started laughing. Ron looked like he had just witnessed a murder being committed to the amusement of his brothers Fred and George (who are on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but didn’t seem all that upset with losing, their captain Wood, on the other hand, walked away with an angry scroll as soon as the game was finished because Terence had caught the Snitch). Come to think of it, that was our first kiss in front of others, I hadn’t realised until now. I wonder if Draco thought about that.
A tear escapes Harry’s eye. “He said he did what he did because of you and Uncle Sirius,” he stutters.
Without thinking about it Harry pulls all the clothes Draco bought for him from the racks and pushes them all in an old duffel bag. Then he opens a drawer and pulls out his favourite jeans. It’s filled with holes and completely worn out, but it fits him better than anything else he owns. Next, he gets a sweater and pulls it over his face. An old gift from Ron, once bright orange. Harry should call Ron and see if he wants to grab a beer soon. It’s been too long since they had a night with just the two of them.
