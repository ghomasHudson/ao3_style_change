"Yes, sir," he said, trying and failing to bite back his smile. Then he let out a little laugh. "You know, Draco, if you wanted your own 'Harry Potter adventure' that badly, you could've just said so."
Draco sighed and began absentmindedly carding his fingers through his hair. And as if he could read his mind: "It's ok, I'm scared, too."
go without chasing it down and finding out exactly where it leads, but, I don't have to tell you that this has the potential for you to get hurt very, very badly..."
"Nah, that's impossible, Stevens! It's already troll sized!" said Reynolds, a tall, stocky blonde wizard who was built like a tank. He clapped Harry on the back as he passed. "What's on the agenda today,
"You have no idea," he mumbled as he turned around to swap robes as they approached the school. He knew that everyone had expected him to accept the Auror position that he'd been offered, marry his teenage sweetheart, and rise up through the ranks at the ministry but the idea of it all felt suffocating. When Mcgonagall told him that provisions were being made so that students whose studies had been interrupted by the war could return for an unprecedented 8th year, he jumped at the chance for normalcy! To be an 18-year-old!
?" he asked incredulously, looking between Ron and Hermione. Ron looked at him innocently though his eyes were still wide and Hermione just smiled.
Harry shot him an apologetic smile and sighed, deciding that maybe he should learn from past mistakes and just be forthright, for once.
care about our friend's happiness, and for some bizarre reason this pointy git makes him happy," he pointed a thumb at Draco, "we'll all just have to get over it."
the one meant to be all breathless and bothered, remember?" he asked as he snaked his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him close.
Draco took off the rings on both hands, his beanie, jacket, loafers, and belt and placed them in with Harry's. He looked nervous as he stared ahead.
He felt the mattress compress on both sides of him as Pansy and Blaise climbed in eagerly on either side. Meanwhile, Greg's face screwed up in confusion where he stood, wheels trying their hardest to turn.
He leant in and was relieved when Harry did too, letting soft lips brush together, sweetly. Harry wrapped his arms around his hips and sighed, pulling away from the kiss and resting his forehead on Draco's in a move that reminded him so much of their very first kiss. That is, until he had to go and ruin it.
"Ok..." he said, wheels turning. "Ok, Alex, I need to talk to Blaise but, in the meantime, can you schedule a meeting for tomorrow morning with Hristofor, that Bulgarian bloke from Sunday?" He'd seemed the denser of the two.
Lee stared at the two rivals brewing quietly on the couch and bit his lip. He sighed. "Shite. I'm about to lose 10 galleons, aren't I?"
Draco pulled him to his chest, a move that felt both loving and protective, and thought he might never let him go.
Draco was still standing right there beside him but he really wished that he could just shrink away instead of awkwardly lingering on the outskirts of their moment. But then Mrs. Weasley fixed him with her gaze and placed a hand on his arm.
"I don't know what I want anymore. But everyone else wants me to be an auror so that's probably what I'll do," he said, resigned.
"Draco, if you're talking about the Yule Ball, we were young, dumb, and tripping off mushrooms! And sex on shrooms is amazing so if the only adjective you can think of is '
itself -- crushed him. And then the grip tightening on his hand wrenched him back to reality, grounding him as Draco nodded towards the group of people running along the terminal.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and shook his head frantically, wet tears sliding down the crook and soaking his t-shirt there.
"The real question is, what happened here--" Draco poked his finger at the point on the report that said both Hollyhead in Wales and Surrey in England, both at 10:31am.
The woman nodded. "I half thought I was going mad, made it all up, you see. It's not everyday that a strange girl falls out of the chimney like a mixed up Father Christmas! That is -- until two men crashed in, one after the other, not even a full minute after she'd run out of the door!"
He landed smoothly in the alley from earlier. There were no signs of Harry so he decided to go back to the little restaurant and wait.
Draco hadn't been listening to a word they'd said since they had insisted that he join them to give his input on some asinine wedding detail that he couldn't care less about. He was too distracted.
The Aurors had gotten the word out to the muggle public, of course, but that was a simple news bulletin asking folks to be on the lookout for an armed and dangerous man; standard protocol in these instances. Even if the MLE had thought to check muggle police reports for possible current whereabouts, surely they hadn't thought to do a deep dive that went
He stilled. He had wondered about that once. He'd assumed that it wouldn't work properly but, as soon as he'd held it, he'd felt the magic course through him, reuniting them again at last!
"Her stick! She broke her stick?" Harry was struggling to keep his voice even. Draco instinctively reached out to grab his hand in his without thinking, it only belatedly occurring to him that he probably shouldn't have. Harry looked at their interlocked hands with a strained look and swallowed thickly, but Draco was surprised when, instead of letting go, he squeezed back tightly and held on.
glare. She just smirked and blew him a kiss. Ooh he was going to get her back big time for that one!
Draco's eyes snapped up and he was surprised to see his mother reflected in the mirror, standing by the bedroom door.
"Yes, dear, what a great idea! ...I absolutely agree!" he said as he edged his way towards the spiral staircase. "I'll just go and run us a bath with some
"Yep," Draco smirked, eyes still flickering back and forth between the threat now looming from every angle. "And you're supposed to be
"Yes," he panted. That was fine, especially after the tongue. Harry was starting to wonder what the big fuss was about until Draco added a second finger. Harry screwed up his eyes and tensed when he felt the burn.
Harry thought back to that moment during the war when a teenager risked it all to save the boy he couldn't admit that he loved; To years later when he was willing to give up his way of life, his family, his status just to see if they could be something... And, of course, to everything that had happened from the moment Draco'd heard that Harry was in trouble up until now...
"What are you... What is going..." he faltered as he stared back into the grey eyes. Then the boy was wiping at his tear stained cheek with his thumb while his fingers gently cupped his face. When had he been crying? He closed his eyes and leaned into the touch as something flickered painfully into consciousness. "Draco?"
She shrugged. "If Harry says you're alright then you're alright. It's just the two of us, we could use more family."
the way I'm meant to... Make amends, so to speak." He shifted in his seat uncomfortably. "Oddly enough, your speech this morning causes me to believe that,
Jansen smirked as he approached but Harry set his sights on the wand half hidden up the bloke's sleeve. If he could only get him to drop it...
"You don't have to do anything, Harry. It's ok if you don't want to and it's ok if you think you might want to and change your mind," he said in a low, reassuring voice. Harry nodded contemplatively but he reached out to grab ahold of Draco, all the same. He wanted this.
Potter's spell hit just as the thief crossed into the woods, their leg moving in slow motion. They reached them
Sorry the chapter count keeps getting longer. I was going to post one BIG chapter but there was just too much going on so I'm breaking it up into 2. This one is short and, since I was planning to give you all of it at once, I'll post the next chapter in a few hours during my next break. Hope you're enjoying!
He lay on top of Draco for a long moment, happily sticky and sated and surprised that the shame and guilt he'd feared was nowhere to be found. But of course it wasn't. This was
Harry's stomach dropped and he heard groans around the room. The last time he'd attempted that potion had ended disastrously with Snape vanishing the contents of his cauldron.
He shifted to reach for the chain around his neck but hesitated. Surely this was too much... Perhaps selfish? Inappropriate? Foolish? His cheeks flamed but he
After the war, the ministry offered Harry a large sum of money along with his Order of Merlin. Harry had initially refused it, the situation feeling eerily like 4th year and accompanied by just as much guilt at the idea of being rewarded when people had died that he couldn't protect. But, like with the Triwizard winnings, he realized that just because he didn't want the money, didn't mean that it couldn't be invested in those who could use it. And with that, he created the Hedwig Center for children affected by the war.
He smiled wanly. Andromeda had played a big part in him coming out and eventually going through with the divorce from Astoria.
Harry glanced at Draco who was now fidgeting with his hands awkwardly, clearly not sure what to do with himself.
Draco started when a hand landed on his shoulder! He instinctively tried to scream in fright but another hand covered his mouth before he could make a sound. He turned, abruptly, only to come face-to-face with bright green eyes.
While Draco had been terrified, Harry wore the same exhilarated expression that used to annoy him to no end whenever Slytherin played against Gryffindor back in their school days. Now, it just made him smile, in spite of himself, and despite the fact that he was sure he looked terribly bedraggled.
"We already know each other. I'm the evil, entitled prick and you're the cocky, self-righteous bastard. What more is there to know?"
Ron nodded. "And it has nothing to do with the fact that Malfoy is getting married tomorrow? Because Hermione said that this weekend was probably going to be tough for you..."
"This is going to sound sappy and maybe a little childish -- I'm sure Bubblykicks would be proud," he scoffed and Draco raised a confused brow. Harry took a deep breath before he continued: "Draco, sex with you... Well... it's filled with love and awkward insecurity and hope and this... this desperate need for safety and belonging and reassurance....." He paused, his brow furrowed. "Quite frankly, it's
"Harry... Think about what we've bonded over... Me witnessing your rape, the times we were almost killed, people dying -- no, being
"None of it really matters right now outside of the proof that Harry could not have done it. Blaise caught a redeye portkey to New Zealand on Sunday night. He must've told her she could stay the night at the flat. This says that she would've left the flat at 10:30am on Monday --"
It was already well into the wee hours of the morning and twilight was fast approaching. He'd been at it since waking from yet another dream that'd felt all too real and ended way too tragically had found him camped out in one of their spare sitting rooms, obsessively combing through fruitless detail after fruitless detail like a madman.
? And all the crap he collected on you from your Death Eater days? So what -- he's a muggle hating fanatic who was looking for a Dark Lord and then found out about the Elder Wand and thought
"Well, you might have avoided it if you hadn't said that thing about his mum!" Ron laughed. "That wandless capture was
"You know, I wanted to believe that all this new leaf shite was a cowardly act to save your arse but
"Blaise, you get that it is in my best interest that Ginevra be alive and well so that Harry's name can be cleared and they can get their divorce? That maybe then I might have some thin, pathetic chance to stop being a mopey, self-loathing prick and just be with the man that I've loved for
"Now, all you need is a pair of Doc Martens," Harry snorted as he let his own long hair down and pulled the bill of his hat low over his scar before slipping on a frayed jean jacket.
Penelope Periwinkle was sat at McGonagall's desk the image of perfection, her blonde hair in pinned curls under a periwinkle hat that matched her cloak and travel briefcase. "Hello, Harry," she said, standing and flashing him a brilliant smile with a brisk nod that was all business. Ron was convinced that the woman was part veela and... right on cue:
. He had been so angry. So furious and so hurt. But when he thought about confronting her, he realized that he had so much more on the line than their marriage. He finally had a family. A good family. A big family. Who he loved with all his heart. But the fact of the matter was: they were
Draco scowled. Father hadn't even needed to pay off the neutral families to keep hush thanks to their stupid blood curse preventing them from talking about it. Thus, his newly bought reputation as a blossoming family man was still secure. While he certainly didn't wish that Astoria had
"Yes. Lucius has always seemed to enjoy this particular form of torture with young muggle men, he no doubt would have found this to be the sweetest revenge for our dear Harry Potter," he almost purred, his voice hitching.
"Wow," Draco echoed, his hair wild and lips slightly swollen and red. He kissed Harry once more and flashed a brilliant smile. He reached for his wand from the side table and casted a "
Harry shook his head and pulled back to gaze into hooded eyes. "I just happen to have the very best partner I could have ever asked for," he said, intently.
Draco shook his head and kissed him chastely. "There is no right or wrong answer, I just want to get a sense of where you're at so I don't make assumptions."
"Ok, it's showtime," Ginny said, looking up into Blaise's eyes. He kissed her and they immediately heard the distinct sound of the clash of metal as someone ran into a suit of armor. They all smiled at each other as they heard the buzz of whispers start to spread.
He smiled, ruefully, and squeezed his daughter's shoulder. Ginny gave him a wan smile and nodded, reaching for Blaise's hand.
"I don't want to, but you have to admit, the evidence is pretty overwhelming..." said a graceful, older witch.
It was strange coming back to Hogwarts, a place where he had once ruled, now returned as an anathema. He had expected it and resigned himself to his fate, but it was still sobering all the same. There were exceptions and surprises, of course. For instance, Granger had been downright friendly since the start of term, going out of her way to call him by his given name and say hello whenever she saw him. It was quite disconcerting, actually.
"Excuse me? Do you think you're above this class, Mr. Malfoy? If so, there's the door!" He pointed. "And 10 points from Slytherin!"
" Ginny said, a mischievous gleam in her eyes. Ron mimed vomiting. "Because the first step is distraction and misdirection. We need a scandal big enough to distract attention away from what happened this morning and away from Draco as the enemy. Something that's going to boggle the minds of students so much that they can't make heads or tails of what's really going on..."
saw them risk everything for me that day. I am their pride and joy. It's just... for father, I think that pride comes from the expectation that I think like him and act like him and I just can't anymore. I don't want to."
His gaze idled, ruefully, on the faded skull on his left forearm which had been left exposed by the short sleeved ensemble. Harry noticed his ruminating and his brows furrowed in concern; they shifted to surprise when Draco rose, slightly, to kiss the lightning shaped scar on his forehead.
again until your honey finally got the point and handed it over," he sneered as he tested the weight of the bat again.
"Mr. Malfoy, sir! How was your meeting yesterday?" she asked, walking over to sit down daintily in front of the hearth on her end.
Draco apparated to his penthouse home on Friday night, glad to put a long day of meetings behind him and get a pint of something strong in front of him.
he knew what was going on within his own household, including all the bullshite he bloody well wished he didn't. But... not today.
"Not exactly." He pushed the box across the desk towards her and watched her eyes light up as she pulled up a chair and began rifling through it. "I'm telling you, Hermione, the MLE  down there is rubbish. I'm tempted to just draw him out. I mean, I
"Well, I hate to say this..." He looked away and shook his head in disbelief before he turned back. "But, I think you might have the perfect partner to try it with."
?! And, he might've seemed intrigued in the moment but he never mentioned it again! I suppose he did become a little more curious about what was going on with
In large part, yes. When you experience a traumatic event, it becomes a part of you even if you don't want to acknowledge it. It affects how you think, act... the choices we make! I wouldn't be sitting here today, fighting to do something good and help others if I hadn't experienced the horrors that I have and if others that I care about hadn't as well. And pushing it away and not dealing with it wasn't working for me.
"Oh, yes! That's it!" Yaxley was gripping Potter's hair painfully as Harry pushed forcefully against his thighs with his forearms. "I like a good fight!" he hissed, slamming his hips against Harry's flushed and sweaty face as he finished in his mouth with a loud cry and a shudder. He pulled out gingerly, spraying the last of his load across Harry's now too red lips as he spluttered and spat. That seemed to be enough to tip Rowle over the edge as well, his head tipping back and a garbled moan escaping his throat as he buried himself deeper inside Harry before stilling.
Draco shrugged. "Well Harry told a few of the younger years that the two of us could teach them how to fly. It gave me an idea to maybe introduce a concept of restorative flying. Like a support group that provides a space to talk but builds in mindfulness and coping strategies through something everyone can relate to, like flying. But... I don't know who would run it..."
Well, it became pretty evident that the Potters hadn't done the bonding ceremony the moment Blaise let him know (against his downright insistence to be kept in the dark about all things Potter, mind you) about whatever guilty antics he'd gotten up to with the redheaded Mrs. Potter.
It had been easy to behave last night: they were so incredibly exhausted from the week's events that they'd both knocked out as soon as their heads touched the pillow. They'd slept straight through the night despite the fact that it was only 6pm when they'd gone to bed.
"I just came from the Department of Magical Transportation. Percy went back and tracked the floo channels from all of your places to all of her frequented places, and, nothing of use."
Draco huffed. "It doesn't matter, can we move on?" he asked, flippantly. "Are your family and the other neutral families all connected?"
The thought of having to work under that prick, Potter, had driven him mad but, then, the bizarre turn of events from earlier that week had given him hope! Oh, it was lovely! Potter couldn't very well lead if he were locked up in Azkaban.
Draco had lasted through an hour and a half of Harry's pacing back and forth in that muggle lounge before he threw his hands up in defeat, told him he was stressing him out, and demanded that he go and take advantage of one of the fifteen minute neck and shoulder massages at the spa. It was a fine idea and all until Draco was left alone reading a muggle magazine all about how Angelina Jolie stole Brad Pitt from Jennifer Anniston and he was suddenly reminded that Harry was bi and unbelievably attractive and that some muggle girl was about to rub all up on him.
"You're precious, Harry," Draco said as he finally reached out and pulled so that Harry found himself lying on his back with his head in Draco's lap. "Relax. Now why in Salazar's name are you so nervous?"
"Course not, I'm just glad we're not the ones left picking splinched bits and pieces of you out of fake tree tops!" he called down and shook his head in disbelief.
He sighed, already bemoaning the thought of going back to his office with no leads and plenty of time to sit with his thoughts. Just then, there was a knock on the open meeting room door and Anavi popped her head in.
we've been through, I still love my parents. Dearly. But I can't help that I love you, too. What it means that me falling in love with someone who is not in
"Draco... if that's what you're planning on doing -- breaking him out, I mean... You do know that you will inevitably be found out, right? You know that, even if you don't get caught and dragged to Azkaban, you'll potentially have to give up your entire life to go on the run?" Hermione asked, cautiously.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
"You look good in this," Harry said, his hands landing on Draco's thighs and sneaking innocently underneath the skirt of the dress. His eyes drifting to where his cock was just barely covered by the fabric like he wanted desperately to take a peek.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Harry shrugged. "And, technically, I'm not on this case -- yet, here I am." He smirked wryly and Draco frowned. Harry softened when he caught the real reluctance in Draco's eyes. "Look, Draco, this is
"I know that look, Harry." Hermione gave him one of her knowing, worried looks. "I know it's hard for you to let
"Pretty much, mate," piped up Weasley. "I went to meet with the other members of the DA to brief them and they were genuinely happy to hear the news about you two. Lots of congratulations and mostly everyone was open to being apart of this mission."
" he hushed and planted another kiss on his forehead. "You don't have to say anything. We're going to find your sodding wife so you can get that blasted divorce and just know that
"Well, there came a point where I kept blowing things up and crushing them when I was angry. The thing was, it wasn't that I would be talking to someone who was pissing me off and random things would start exploding uncontrollably -- as I think is the case for most accidental magic. Instead, it was more like I would be talking to someone and think 'I really want to punch this prick in the face' and, instead of doing it, I would focus on a lamp or vase and concentrate on it until
Harry moaned. Draco tested the waters with soft, tentative kisses at first. He had never really believed that Harry's hesitance actually had all that much to do with Ginevra to begin with but, he knew this was still technically
Draco finally lifted his head and glared at Potter for a long moment. When Potter didn't back down, he sighed.
"Nice, Ron," said Ginny as she joined them, placing a hand on Harry's back and taking the seat next to him. He looked up to see her shoot angry glares at his admirers and some of them had the good grace to look guilty. They all laughed.
"Ah! What a treat, indeed!" Ollivander's voice floated down to them as he descended a nearby ladder. "The very gentlemen who rewrote the rules of wandlore, united in my shop!"
Harry rolled his eyes and went to sit on the sofa adjacent to the chair. Malfoy came over to sit down beside him and began fixing tea. When he leaned over to grab the milk and sugar, Harry was suddenly overwhelmed by a fragrant scent of lemon shampoo that momentarily left him breathless. He looked up and stared back into gray eyes.
She paled and swallowed, hard, refusing to look at him. Draco tsked, his steel-grey eyes narrowing and his voice turning as icy as his gaze.
Draco rolled his eyes. "What does it look like I'm doing? Consulting. My fee is 200 galleons per hour. Or you can suck me off. Your choice."
"Anavi!" he said, immediately turning to Draco who was already fixing him with that perfectly arched eyebrow.
Stevens shook her head and her lips set in a grim line. "Last week she was terrified and struggling to come up with a list of suspects and today she just calmly told me that it was ok to close the case because she hadn't heard anything since and preferred not to have all the fuss..."
crap or fully understand my past and he just always seemed so interested to know!" he rattled off, somewhat defensively.
Blaise was lucky. His family had always been neutral in the war so he was able to navigate all of the drama as a witness and not as a participant.
"Now, now--" Borgin began to back up slowly with hands halfway up in surrender. "I mustn't be held accountable for whatever...
"You really love him, don't you?" Hermione asked and he hated the soft sadness in her voice that meant she actually saw through him.
Draco couldn't help his toothy smile and shook his head knowing it probably looked ridiculous. "Ok, Potter. Let's go do some gay stuff and get some firewhiskey."
"Hmm... What was so strange about this particular man?" Hermione asked. "It's not unusual for them to get onlookers..."
A tiny smirk tugged at the woman's lips. "Oh, for you, hun, I'll make it extra special," she teased.
His eyes flew open and head spun to the side -- an action he immediately bemoaned when his stomach lurched and the room spun, too. His bed was, thankfully, empty but broken memories from last night came flooding back to him as he lay: dancing wildly and singing off-key to some delightful muggle group called the Spicey Girls (or something of that nature); drunkenly crying into a pint of gross beer while two girls dressed in neon fits with tiger stripes cooed over him like a sad kitten; letting some nameless bloke with messy black hair and the wrong colored eyes bend him over against the wall outside a bathroom stall... Sweet Salazar!
Draco licked his lips as old fantasies of himself on top of the world, worshiped by lowly pissants, came flashing unbidden into his mind. A bitter mixture of bile and shame rose at the thought and he swallowed. He thought, instead, about how much his life had changed and all the people he'd been able to help, all the
Wasn't he a muggle?! Holy shite, how did he get them all the way here from Soho?! Thoughts of being locked away for breaking the international statue of secrecy ran through his mind!
. You held back when I'm not even sure I could have if the roles were reversed. You got him, Draco."
"Er-hmm" Lucius cleared his throat and they startled apart. "You may use the floo. You can stay the night but that's all. While I'll heed your advice and not actively invoke any unnecessary inquiries onto this family, I also will not make a habit of harboring fugitives in this home."
Ron slowed in his tracks, a distinct look of worry taking over his features which surprised Harry. Ron swallowed thickly for some reason. "Mate... What happened yesterday?"
Harry nodded and followed Ron down the spiral staircase and to the tapestry that hid the stairs that led to the ground floor. Instead of descending them, however, Ron sat down on the topmost step and Harry followed suit.
"None of your business," he said, not taking his eyes off of his page. Another moment went by in silence before it became clear that Potter had no real plans of leaving. He sighed and finally looked up to see him staring back at him, amused, the circles under his eyes impossibly darker. Draco looked around them warily. "Why are you
Harry took a deep breath. The world seemed to pause. Seemed to get smaller. Narrowing in until there was no one else, nothing else, besides them, in that moment.
fucked up! It's why we get each other in the first place! Before, I might have thought being fucked up meant miserable, too, but I'm not miserable... Not with you, at least." He smiled shyly and then rolled his eyes at himself. "It's actually been pretty restorative to talk about some of these things with you and know you get it. Maybe pretending we're normal and untouched by trauma won't work for us."
"Harry, there's nothing more beautiful than celebrating love and family, even if it means grieving what
! There's no need to bother the poor bloke again when I'm sure there are other leads we could be following," he explained. "You know, if
He met mother's piercing grey eyes, so much like his own, with sadness. He knew she wouldn't ask him to explain. She had a habit of already knowing things where Draco was concerned, even if she never spoke upon them.
There was hardly a dry eye in the house by the time the bonding ceremony begun in proper and there was a building sense of anticipation as he and Draco repeated the remaining vows and necessary incantations.
spells, how many of you have ever used any of those 3 spells outside the classroom, while moving, and while being fired at?"
Andromeda hid her snicker behind her hand and Bill fixed Harry with a deadpanned look from across the room that screamed:
"Now that just leaves Yaxley and Rowle." Harry stiffened but continued to look up at him. "How much blame would you give them?"
(Harry bemoaned) his wand, firmly. Harry was surprised when the sick bastard stared back at him, blood streaming down into his mouth, and actually
Harry scoffed at the idea of being sent "home" to a place that would only ever be home again if Draco made it back to him. He turned and marched off, determinedly.
"Today, has been lovely, Gin," he said as he led her inside and they waited for the hostess. "I have a good feeling about tonight."
Harry jolted upright and the three best friends all fixed each other with wide eyes before they whipped out their wands, at the ready.
"What happened 6th year was not sex, Harry. That's not what sex is like and no one would think you wanted that."
"Oh no -- whoever this prick is used you, hurt Ginny, and is actively trying to tear my life apart. I'm livid," he said, pulling Draco closer and planting a kiss in his hairline. "But at least now we
Ron shrugged. "Speaking of which, you went off to bed super early last night and we never got to talk about what in the
"Oh... I guess, technically, you're not out yet... Sorry, I didn't even really think -- And, Merlin, I guess I sort of outed you to my parents, didn't I?" He frowned.
"Still recovering from having to spend a full day with that ferret? I'm telling you, mate, you've too much of a bloody bleeding heart. I don't care if you
"Draco..." Harry breathed as he rushed to him, anger melting into concern and something warm and nurturing.
His entry into the Ministry went mercifully smoothly thanks to Hermione's coin giving him access to the toilets.
just mean dragging toy brooms around while carrying a quaffle). They could just make out Arthur in the distance trying out his new muggle grill and Bill, Percy, and George on standby in case he accidentally set the whole place ablaze.
"Ok, we've got work to do." Granger clapped her hands together from her place on the couch in Snape's sitting room. Weasley was perched on the arm of the sofa next to her. Draco glanced over at the surly portrait of his Godfather who was glaring at him venemously.
"Kidnapped?! I svear, I know not vat you are referring! If you mean the red haired girl, Sebastian simply asked us to retrieve her so they could talk!"
Harry groaned. That was another thing that had driven him crazy about working with Draco yesterday. The whole time, he kept looking at him with that one burning question in his eyes: "
"It is and you look great." Potter rubbed at his neck sheepishly. He wore a simple button up with a black t-shirt underneath and his fitted jeans.
"Harry will need to make an appearance so that people see he's alright and interacts with Draco without ill will, but since he can't be in the Great Hall right now, he won't join for the feast. Thus, we have to plan how to make sure Draco is supported, protected, and actually looks like he's welcomed and having fun while there," Ginny took up the thread.
here, Potter? Surely you're not here because I missed lunch? Shouldn't you be somewhere in the Great Hall stuffing your face with the Weasel like a pair of trolls?"
He sighed and shot a furtive glance at the two men who were sat across from him, watching curiously. He quickly scribbled back:
But, please, tell me again how your piss poor sense of self-worth is to be pitied," he added dangerously. "
"Well, I welcome the challenge, sir." She smirked wryly and crossed her arms, champagne swirling with the movement. "Now you've
There were cheers and applause, his family and friends clapping the loudest at the head table. Harry smiled nervously and bowed to allow Robards to place the inaugural medal around his neck.
nodded her head towards the large booth to the left of the stage and the busboy stopped his clearing of the bar top to whistle at the odd arrangement of characters convened around it. On one side sat a group of posh ladies and gentlemen who looked overdressed in the too bright neon lighting of the karaoke bar while the other was made up of a plain, comparatively ragtag bunch. The table between them might as well have been a chasm the way they awkwardly stared across at each other with only the occasional terse, fake smile for niceties.
"Well, I'm seldom a yeller but I can promise to keep you on your toes by being insufferably disorganized," he smiled, apologetically.
He had the briefest, fleeting, ridiculous thought that maybe he could do what Ginny had suggested and reach out to Draco...
"The bloody hell do you lot want?!" he asked, brow furrowed and arms crossed as he took in the bizarre sight of Pansy, Blaise, and Astoria standing side-by-side with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. Harry, who was still groggy and shirtless with pajamas hanging low on his hips, joined him at his side.
"Exactly. So, if you give them 100% of the blame, that pushes you and I off the chart. Are you ok with that? Can you accept that?"
Sebastian's cheeks turned beet red and Draco refused to turn away or flinch when the bat raised and reared back, mightily, before barreling towards him!
"Draco... Remember when you said that you weren't brave?" Draco raised a brow in question. "Remember? It was all those years ago -- That day when your dad flooed in and you buried me under the pillows!"
He felt anger and sadness build in his every nerve till he punched out and kicked at the mattress in silent fury until his muscles ached. He was surprised when the tears came -- he had learned long ago not to let them out but, in the privacy of the pitch darkness, he buried his face in his pillow and let them flow until he'd fallen asleep.
He heard someone coming and hastily made to bury his robes among the hanging cloaks on the rack by the door. Auror robes were probably
But then there were some smaller things that Harry noticed that made him wonder if the still bristly boy who was now his peer in Auror training might actually be remorseful and trying to find his own ways towards redemption.
Draco smirked in response. "Probably a good rule of thumb," he agreed even as his eyes searched the dark trees around them. The smell of damp earth and pine trees was familiar in a way that made him stand on high alert. All was still but for the gentle rustling of leaves in the wind but he knew better than to linger. He'd rather take his chances against a wand any day than to face any number of the beasts that lie within the Forbidden Forest.
"Harry." He coiled his hand around Harry's hair and tugged, gently but firmly, so that Harry was at his mercy, neck exposed. He started at the base of his throat and then let his teeth and bottom lip lightly scrap upward, detouring and stopping just below his ear so that when he spoke -- voice rough with want and wavering restraint -- Harry could feel every syllable. "
"Yes, and that would also make the perfect cover because whoever it is could bank on it that if anyone figured it out, they couldn't tell the authorities if they wanted to! Pansy, were you about to say that there's no coincidence that your families are all neutral?"
Blaise shook his head. "I don't see why they would, the inauguration was the first time I'd met either of them and we hadn't even conversed until Sunday's meeting so I hadn't even had a chance to offend them..."
Potter shrugged. "Things just got a little hectic with me finishing up training and her just getting drafted to the Harpies." He finally paused at a glass case with the staff in it. He pointed it out as an afterthought as he turned towards Draco.
Yes, you heard that right: In the biggest plot twist since Wilda Griffiths' trade to Puddlemere United, Hogwarts' (former) resident Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, has taken on an unexpected role as an advocate of mental health. I sat down with the 18-year-old for a tell-all interview right before today's official ribbon cutting ceremony. Dressed in his finest dress robes, the charmingly handsome young man talked candidly about his personal mission of healing trauma post war.
"Merlin, Harry..." Draco's voice sounded almost awed as he explored. "Are you living completely muggle?"
"Ok, well we're going to see if we can find out what's what from the source. Thanks, Blaise -- we'll try to update you with what we find before your portkey leaves."
It took him a moment to notice Hermione beaming up at him or Ron and Zabini staring between him and Draco with eyebrows raised in confusion (and maybe a little bit of disgust for Ron, who really should have been paying attention to his potion as it was now shaking dangerously).
Ginny finally descended the stairs an hour and a half later wearing a sparkling emerald green dress that put his jeans and navy blue button-up to shame.
They were both shocked when a silver stag actually shot through the tip of Draco's wand. It galloped around the room, driving off the looming dementors.
had for him. Harry leaned into the touch and closed his eyes as he continued. "And I'm sure that you also know that, when I have been loved, there's historically been a 50/50 chance that something tragic will happen to take them away? I mean, Ginny's just further proof of that!"
His heart beat quickly as he stared around the room full of mostly freckled faces. It looked as if the
Harry, still slightly shocked, turned to find exhilarated grey eyes blinking back at him through wet, brown hair. They shared twin smirks as renewed hope filled them! They nodded once before pushing forward, Harry casting a mixture of defensive and offensive spells, wandlessly, while Draco covered his back.
to find a way out of this! His adrenaline spiked and heart beat quickly as the sound of approaching footsteps filled the corridor. It wasn't long before Robards came into view flanked by Auror Jansen.
The DA members dispersed among the crowd and the younger years excitedly started their duels. Harry watched the rain of red wand light from stunners shower the room. As he watched, his heart started beating faster and his adrenaline pumped. Then something truly odd happened: One minute he was in dueling club and the next he was transported back to the Battle of Hogwarts. He looked around the room and everyone was fighting for their lives. A little boy who looked a lot like Colin Creevey in his first year was hit with a light that he could've sworn was green instead of red. This was all his fault! They were going to die and it was all his fault! He suddenly was stricken with the thought that he really wanted his mom and dad. Did he have to die again? And, if he did, would he be able to see them again without the resurrection stone? He turned his head to look along the head table and panicked when he saw a line of dead bodies, Remus, Tonks and Fred, all bloodied and staring unseeingly with vacant eyes, lie nearest to him. He started to scream in terror but then the fog started to ebb away at his brain.
They were both surprised when, instead of his usual stag, a white peacock burst from the end of his wand and floated around the room."
still loving and being there for my family, or I leave right now and I don't look back. There's nothing else that I can do."
"Yes! I didn't find out until yesterday, after I got the ransom note, that she didn't actually go to Luna's. I apparated right over when I found out!" he said, trying to keep his voice even. He was exhausted and he needed to be out there finding her. "Look, you're wasting your time! I didn't do this! I should be helping!"
And if you make me eat alone I'll stand here and kick at this door all day and draw attention to your hidey hole." Draco sighed, resigned. "Plus, I want to sit out by the lake and talk about Potter."
Harry threw his arms out behind him to brace himself but nothing could prepare him for the overwhelming feeling of Draco's impossibly warm, incredibly wet mouth sheathing his cock.
Through it all, I had the sole goal of keeping my mother alive and trying to stay alive myself, but, with little hope in the latter. When I made it through to the other side of the war, the goal had been met but then I was purposeless. Most of the things I'd done or been privy to in the process of surviving as a 16 or 17-year-old death eater were things that I found that I did not want to live with. Thus, two weeks after my release from Azkaban, I had my death all planned out. I didn't tell anyone but I had decided to go out with a self-destructive bang. That was all me running away from the trauma and pain.
Draco watched on as she tenderly crafted the plaits into an intricate, braided crown and then waved her wand so that the rest hung down his back in long, beautiful waves. He clutched his heart.
"As you've so kindly pointed out, I have chosen the side that has no qualms about killing and I do so like to live." He turned to tap his wand to the bricks, looking back over his shoulder at Harry right before he touched the final brick. "Good luck, Potter. I do hope you survive. Or... at the very least, that I'm not the one that has to kill you." He smirked.
They all laughed. "Ok, ok! Go get your man!" Daphne pushed him towards the door and he waved good-bye as he let himself into the office.
Thanks for hanging in this with me! There is still the epilogue which I had hoped to get done and out today as well but, surprisingly, my life has gotten even busier working from home and it looks like I'll have to wait until Sunday to post it. (Also, even though I have a whole part two to keep the story going I think I might hate goodbyes and endings just as much as Harry so I may be subconsciously drawing this out lol). Sorry for the suspense.
"Of course not, but that doesn't matter right now. Hermione, what do you know about African Dream Root?"
"I have a cheating wife who asked her husband for a divorce, publicly, on their anniversary night. I have a hot headed, grieving husband. I have a destroyed foyer and signs of a great struggle at Grimmauld Place. I have a husband who disregarded all order of rank and file to meet with and pay a known criminal, only to go on and sully the investigation by, not only working his own wife's case himself, making it possible to cover tracks and hinder progress, but also brought in family and friends to further muddy the investigation. Did I get everything?"
"Yes," Granger continued. "Mcgonagall is arranging for the house tables to be removed and replaced with smaller, circular tables for tonight that make it easier to mingle. That way, Draco will be able to be integrated with the student body but be surrounded by the DA and it'll look more like a bunch of 7th and 8th years bonding and less like..."
Harry's eyes were caught by a collection of vinyls and it reminded him of the Celestina Warbeck case.
"Because the head girl now thinks her best friend is about to get laid. Whether she likes breaking the rules or not, I can guarantee you she just sent out word to all the prefects and quidditch captains that the prefects bathroom is out of service for the next 3 hours." He smiled mischievously.
"I'm fine!" He glanced at Malfoy who seemed to be listening although he was still avidly avoiding looking in his direction. "I just went for a walk to clear my head last night and fell asleep by the lake. I'm fine," he reassured them.
Harry held Robards wand tightly, not at all sure if it would work for him since he hadn't won it and in no mood to find out.
Draco abruptly grabbed him by the chin and kissed him deeply. Harry felt himself melt and his already half-hard cock grow. Shockwaves went through him and he moaned into the kiss as he felt it connect with Draco's hard length and they rubbed together briefly. Draco released him and exhaled a shuddering breath to try to compose himself but, when he spoke, it was with a raspy voice and his eyes were dark with lust. "I could be so much more than a tease for you, Harry, but I need to know what's off limits first, ok?"
still the blokes with the highest records on the thing so if anyone might be able to pull this off then, in theory, it should be them. The only problem was, it had
"It turns out that the reason why Krafft doesn't show up on anyone's radar for those eight years is that... Well, it appears the bloke just went completely muggle after Durmstrang!"
Harry's breath hitched, his eyes drawn to the leaking cock. "I want to taste you." He swallowed, Adam's apple bobbing. "Want to please you."
!" Harry shouted as Ron marched urgently into his office. He nodded solemnly and slammed the door in Jansen's face. Harry shrugged at the man mouthing indignantly at him through the window and quickly turned his attention to Ron.
The sonorous impact of the 12 stunners and killing curse hitting the shields rocked the room and propelled Draco and Harry further. Harry's glasses flew off from the force and Draco's head hit hard against the metal banister near the bottommost stair of the grand staircase as they landed. He could feel the sticky wetness of the blood starting to ooze into his hair and the dull pounding sensation of his skull but it didn't matter because he was too distracted by the fact that Harry Potter was lying on top of him, his pelvis pressed against his own. He stared back into bright green eyes until the darkness started to take over and he slipped away into unconsciousness.
look. I didn't want to get that from you, too." He shook his head then stared down at his trainers. "I hate feeling pitied."
His heart clutched as he saw red hair stand out in the middle of the throng as a disheveled Ginny Potter-Soon-To-Be-Weasley-Maybe-One-Day-Zabini desperately searched in his direction. Harry numbly took off his baseball cap and Blaise, who looked exhausted and a little banged up himself, pointed in their direction. Ginny pushed away from Savage and Robards, who were holding her up, and ran full force, despite her limp, into his arms.
Harry blinked back into large, round, blue eyes as a half-sleep, very cranky Draco shifted beside him. He removed the arm that had been draped over Harry's chest and grumpily grabbed the towering tray of food from the house elf. Harry felt around on the nearby nightstand for his glasses and quickly jammed them onto his face to better survey the situation.
Draco directed a little bow toward his welcome committee but resisted the urge to dish out a mighty two finger salute as he exited his portkey port.
He felt lost and pained. But then he was being pulled into strong arms and inhaling, he realized, his favorite scent in the whole world because it was Harry. Harry planted a soft kiss in his hair.
"Andromeda explained that she had no more choice in whether she stayed or left the family than she did in falling in love. She fell in love and had been naive enough to hope that her family's love for her was infinite enough that they could accept her still, as she had tried to accept them despite their views. Instead, she was banished and forbidden to talk to her sisters." Draco shook his head and Harry could see the conflict in his eyes.
Harry wasn't feeling well that Saturday morning. Surprisingly, he'd actually slept last night. In fact he'd gone to bed early and woken up 12 hours later, just before he was supposed to head down to the Great Hall for the dueling club.
Draco angled his his hips back to create distance between them then leaned in for a quick kiss. "Not yet."
The owl simply looked at him with large, baleful eyes and stuck its leg out more forcefully. Draco, knowing all too well the pain of the eagle owl's beak, quickly relieved her of the letter and reached into his robes for an owl treat. There was a quick hoot in response before she flapped her large wings and took off again.
"Draco, why can you move like that?" It came out too breathy and his ears turned red at the sound of it.
Just as Draco was thinking that he really liked this girl, that gruff voice that always grated on Draco's last nerve broke through the murmurs of the room.
Draco looked flabbergasted. "What in the-- Wait..." His eyes widened impossibly larger in disbelief. "Harry, can muggle men have babies?!"
All of this! You are all risking your own reputations but what are you expecting of me in return?! To be this fake, friendly bloke who wears his heart on his sleeve?" he scoffed, angrily. "Harry, I'm not even friends with my own friends! Not really... Blaise and Pansy are the closest but even they get bits and snippets. Everyone sees the parts of me that are necessary, when they are necessary."
Draco felt an unmatched spark of pain and anger and heartbreak swirl within and around him like nothing he'd ever felt before. His hair whipped around him and the forest floor quaked mightily.
. In that moment, Draco realized that he hadn't needed to travel the world in search of his new home.
"Harry..." He looked down at his fancy shoes and swallowed thickly before returning his gaze. "What would you like to do?"
Harry had listened with his eyes and jaw open, indignantly, his heart racing and a deep rage simmering in his very bones.
didn't happen!" Ron chuckled and shook his head in relief. "Now if only you and Gin would go ahead and have some kids like the rest of us."
Draco peaked out, warily, at the flailing, bashing limbs of the Whomping Willow. Maybe Blaise was right and the Gryffindors really were rubbing off on him... This type of martyr shite was usually much more Harry's style.
Angelina grabbed onto George's arm tightly in anticipation and they watched as Harry's eyes widened as he turned to stare back at Draco, now unconsciously clutching the cufflinks to his chest. The room full of Gryffindors (and Luna and Hannah) all watched with bated breath as both the apprehension and the tension pulsed palpably through the room. A spot of pink touched Draco's cheeks and he stared back into green eyes for a long moment.
"Harry... Those are two different questions. I don't think sex with you would be anything like what sex is usually like for me."
damned day of working in the field together as young cadets for he and Draco's whole lives to be flipped upside down. They had stupidly chosen to date in the week and a half before Draco's arranged marriage, knowing full well that it couldn't continue after. But then, Draco had given him a choice:
"Merlin, yes yes yes yes yes," he almost sang. And with that, Draco matched his rhythm and Harry buried his head into Draco's neck and moaned loudly as he came and came and came. Draco arched his head back as he followed suit.
something that Ginny wasn't leaving him. If having pretentious arse Blaise Zabini on the side was what it took for someone to not fucking leave him, for once, then so be it.
"I'm sorry for scaring you, Potter." Harry's lingering frown softened. A very Slytherin thought crossed Draco's mind. "It's just... Sometimes it's like... Do you remember Cedrick Diggory's birthmark?"
"The information he learned from Ollivander led him to Gregorovitch which led him to Grindelwald which led him to Dumbledore, the last known possessor of the Elder Wand."
I were gay... And we had sex, what would that be like?" He felt mortified to have asked but he also couldn't look away as Draco contemplated the question. Something warm but guarded reflected in his eyes.
"Well then, I'm very glad you don't know where we are," Harry said, reaching for Draco's wand to cast a quick disapparatition jinx. He didn't need Dung running off to collect whatever bounty the Ministry was offering before they could get answers.
it! But, for some reason, actually hearing Draco say it felt like a lot like that 100 foot fall from his broom in third year. There was the same icy feeling in his chest, too, although this time there were no dementors needed to make him feel this despair. He couldn't stop the tears.
"Adhira?" she called out as she sat down the now empty mug of tea she had been nursing and stood. "What have you gotten yourself into, now, you silly cat?"
particular road... He still hadn't recovered from the last time he'd made the mistake of reading too much into the sweet gesture and wound up connecting dots he shouldn't have.
Draco walked determinedly down the hall in what was now feeling to Harry like the most dreadful game of chicken. The screams of despair started up in his head as they closed the gap.
Draco looked like he had questions but, thankfully, his sense of propriety seemed to prevail and, taking Harry's cue, he allowed the subject change.
Harry beamed at him when he realized that he'd actually put on his glasses and washed the Sleekeazy's out of his hair. Harry thought he looked very adorably nervous and the fact that Harry could tell that he was nervous made him feel inexplicably proud of him. He wanted to kiss him but the corridor was full of passing Slytherins who were already shooting them all incredulous looks.
Harry thought about Draco at work at a potions station. He used to be so annoyed by how confident and in control he seemed in potions but now the thought just made his cock harden. He blushed. Ron rolled his eyes but smirked knowingly.
Harry felt light headed at the words. Was he really having second thoughts? Of course he'd be having second thoughts...
"Sebastian told us that he vuld guarantee that ve got an audience vith the famous Draco Malfoy for the deal of a lifetime if only ve could bring him the girl! He arranged for us to sit vith his business partner at the inauguration and told us ve just had to get Oblansk onboard."
"No way." He bit his lip lasciviously as he pulled Draco into his arms. He wrapped his arms around his hips and pulled him closer as they began to dance, Draco's arms finding their way around his shoulders.
His visit with his parents had gone, well... as expected, mostly. No big breakthroughs but still no one had gotten hit with a curse which was... fine.
Could all of that stuff realistically have happened in under 6 minutes? Maybe. Maybe not. But hey, they're wizards so **shrug**.
The force of the unexpected spell knocked him forward on hands and knees as his wand flew from his hand and a second voice boomed, "Petrificus totalus!"
"Draco, while I assure you that it will be my extreme pleasure to have a hand in Potter's fall from grace," Lucius' lips curled into a satisfied sneer as his eyes landed on the boy turned man who had singlehandedly been behind every one of his missteps and, ironically, his own fall from grace. He cocked his head. "--and though I couldn't much care what happens to you at that moment, please, indulge me. Was this depraved lifestyle you've chosen to live worth throwing your life away?"
"Huh... Haven't done that since what? Fifth year? Sixth?" Harry screwed up his face in confusion. What was he on about? Did Jansen even
Harry tried to force himself to loosen up and breathe normally but that only seemed to make him more self-conscious.
No sooner than the words had left his mouth did a thick, Bulgarian accent catch his attention. He turned to find Minister Oblansk and two, bulking, dignitaries heading their way towards the exist.
"Ok, Malfoy. You've got 15 minutes to come find me before I come find you!" he commanded, his chest poking out and his arms flexing with authority. "Why are you looking at me strangely?"
or whatever folks called him these days. Also, no floo meant no one popping in unannounced which was a regular occurrence at number 12.
Draco silently sauntered towards Harry, stopping to hover low over his back, letting his breath ghost over soft skin as he rubbed his hands up the length of his back. Rather than relax, Harry stiffened and Draco smirked, devilishly.
and choose the only person in the room who's actually wanted you dead at some point." He rolled his eyes and Harry gave a watery laugh and bowed his head. Draco squeezed his hands and held his gaze, seriously. "Harry, I am the man I am today because you believed in me over and over again, even when you probably shouldn't have. I still don't know why, frankly, but I am eternally grateful for whatever screws you have loose or wires you've got crossed that allowed you to trust me when no one else would. That trust is your greatest gift to me, Harry, and I vow to always fight to be deserving of it. To be both a man and a partner who is worthy of it. Merlin knows I'm not perfect, and I can't promise that I will never miss the mark or let you down, but I vow to wake up every morning with that as my main mission in life and in marriage. I love you, Harry, with every. Single. Part of me. You are loved and you are valued and you are worthy. Now and forever. And I vow to never let you forget it."
Harry couldn't hide his shiver at the words. He swallowed, Adam's apple bobbing and mouth suddenly very dry. His cock hardened as he inhaled the intoxicating citrusy smell of bergamot and Draco so very, very close.
Draco opened his eyes to find Harry smiling sweetly from the doorway to the hospital wing. He smiled back from his bed and shrugged.
seen you look at me the way you just looked at that man." She shook her head and rocked back and forth as if she was steeling herself for something. Harry looked around them warily, praying that they weren't garnering attention. He thought he knew what was coming -- the very thing that he had been hoping a good day might prevent -- and the
"Ron! She's imperiused!" he shouted, pushing the woman to the floor, the shocked and indignant cries of the muggle patrons mingling with the clattering of the drinks and tray crashing as he took off running toward the restrooms.
The darkness pressed in around Draco, encasing him from every angle, heavy and suffocating. He stilled, his ears straining carefully, at first hearing only the sounds of his own quickened pulse thrumming against his eardrums and his ragged breath in the chilled air around him. He was rewarded for his patience with a slight rustle in the distance. Robes against leaves? The smell of damp earth and pine cones and the feel of soil and twigs beneath his feet told him that he was in a forest. That meant that any shot he took could be impeded by trunks and branches.
"Harry, if we were to have sex, and we only got to have one go at it, then it would be my every intention to make sure that you never, ever forget it." Harry felt goosebumps rise on his arms and his cock thicken. "I don't care what holes you've be in before or would be in after me, but I
"Oh, come on. Let's buy you a pint," said her friend dressed in a matching neon green fit as they ushered him over to a seat at the bar.
There were shocked looks around the room as his classmates perked up out of their stupors at the brewing conflict.
Harry deflated, realizing that he was right. If he didn't have to think about Draco, he might've taken the risk regardless. But, as much as he'd talked about his own fear of loss, he'd be kicking himself for eternity in the afterworld if he
"Draco!" he cried out desperately and Draco finally obliged. Harry watched as he licked up the underside of his cock with the flat of his tongue. Harry had never felt anything like this and he was completely lost in sensation as Draco's tongue flicked at his frenulum before making it's way up to the head and twirling around the tip, lapping up the precum that had already beaded there in the short time that he'd been out of the water.
"Not a thing, mate!" Sebastian raised his hands in surrender but his smirk didn't disappear as he sipped his coffee.
the easiest thing I've ever done. And it's easy because you make it that way." Now Draco was crying. Harry kissed his knuckles. "Easy because you make it safe. Easy because, as my partner, you never let me face my fears alone. You may have had to threaten to curse me a few times, but I'm thankful for all the times you wouldn't let me shut down or push you away. Thankful for all the times that you gave me reassurance or held my hand or made it ok for me to let go of the reigns because you could either share the load or were willing and able to take it on entirely. Draco, I've learned from you that being in love and being an Auror are not so different. Both are terrifying and thrilling and require you to trust your partner, fully, to have your back. Draco, you are the best partner that I have
Harry blinked, searching furiously for Draco as the lights came on to reveal the full Ministry Training Room. He sighed with relief when he spotted him and rushed to where Draco lay, curled up in a fetal position, with the Elder Wand kicked as far away from himself as possible.
"Why are you so giddy, mate?" Lee Jordan asked as he handed George a cup of eggnog, his red Weasley jumper sporting a big, white "L". George, who donned a green and red elf hat with one enlarged novelty elf ear, turned in his seat and shot him a gleeful, mischievous smile.
"Draco, I....." He looked off into space for a moment as if trying to find the words. He furrowed his brow as he remembered something.
article and was dying to attend the ceremony to share the opportune public spotlight as the proud father. Draco knew that he would follow mother's league, however. He had hoped that when she inevitably found out, though, that
Draco had quit Auror training and moved away to the states which made it easier for Harry to pretend that his already bruised and battered heart hadn't finally shattered into pieces and to gradually move on with his life.
"Their names are Hristofor and Grozdan and, from what I could tell, they are trusted advisors to the Bulgarian Minister for Magic." Draco shook his head. "Apparently, they had a big role in convincing Oblansk to go international instead of using in house underwriters. I thought it was a little strange that they were a part of the deal since they didn't seem to have roles specifically in finance, but they did seem genuinely excited by the prospect of the payout and curious about the intricacies of the deal... Not what you'd expect from kidnappers, really. It's just not adding up, why set this all up to get to Weaselette?"
After the arrival of father's latest correspondence, Draco was in a particularly foul mood that following Tuesday. He skipped lunch despite Blaise's insistence that he join him and, instead, he headed to the library and carefully browsed the Healing section. His fingers skimmed over the greatly worn and battered spines of ancient books like
"Oh, but of course! Master is hosting it this time and Boply made sure that the drawing room was spotless and made all the favorites! There is treacle tart for Mrs. Fawley, and macaroons for Mr. Greengrass, and sponge cake for Mr. Ollivander --"
"Attention! Attention, everyone! I'd like to make a toast to the grooms!" He called. Harry laughed harder when he saw Hermione close her eyes and put her head in her hand in exasperation at her husband. "Don't worry," he said, pushing up the bosom area of the dress. Draco was smiling as he pulled Harry to his side and glasses of wine were floated over to them. "I'll make this short and sweet because the shorter I make it, the sooner I can get out of Auntie Muriel's dress!"
that we were pregnant -- not in our circle, at least. We'd agreed not to until the baby was full term." Harry shook his head. "The fact that you knew at all meant that you could've only found out from one person and, according to Ginny,
! He may not be the fastest or hardest-working Auror in the unit, but you didn't need to be when you had what Jansen had: Pure, infallible, natural-born instinct.
Harry took off his glasses and let his long hair free from its bun as he relaxed against the trunk of a large beech tree. It was a clear, peaceful day off and Harry was enjoying being on uncle duty instead of Auror duty for a change. They were currently sat out in the orchard behind The Burrow's garden watching the kids "play quidditch" (Teddy and Vicky were the only ones old enough to have figured out how to get off the ground at all but Dominique, Luis, Mols, Lucy, and even little Fred and Roxie were giving it their best shots -- even if it
"We're here because -- as it turns out -- you can learn tons of fascinating information with just a little bit of dream root and a few pilfered hairs. For instance, I've learned that there's something that I want very badly in that white tomb by the lake." Draco gasped. Harry wouldn't have! Would he? "Unfortunately, try as I might, I could't discover a way to apparate into or out of this blasted school! Potter's dreams, however, implied that a select few knew about a secret entrance and I figured, who better to be more in the know about that sort of thing than Harry Potters boy toy? So... here we go, mate."
Draco wrapped his arms around his neck and pulled him closer as he came down. He felt a flood of emotion as Draco peppered soft kisses in his hair and he was wrapped in a blanket of hushed words of reassurance.
secretary! Draco, think about it: she's the one who would've been in charge of the seating arrangements at the inauguration, she's the one who booked the table at the restaurant last minute without even asking, she's the one that told me to meet with Dung, and she's the one that got 'poisoned' by the Warbeck potion knowing I knew and had the antidote!" How could he be so blind not to see it before?!
The room filled with laughter and Harry found himself filled with so much joy he was sure he could cast the brightest
logo from one pocket and a shriveled-up, dried human hand with a candle firmly in its grasp from the other. Harry's jaw dropped.
"It's the boy-boy thing," he said as he grabbed his cup of eggnog and made his way over to the sitting area and the sofa opposite the boys. George followed.
"The girls confirmed that Ginny wasn't at practice on Monday morning. None of them saw her arrive but they did say that they noticed a strange man in the stands."
be a wedding here Saturday afternoon and, unless you readily have someone in mind, then, I'm afraid it will be that mousey little--"
Draco blinked back, slowly, shy smile turning brilliant and then settling on something more mischievous. Grey eyes implored green in a familiar dance that always filled Harry with nervous anticipation and, amazingly, made him want to be soft instead of hard -- gave him permission to be soft instead of hard. Harry recognized it as a gift, silently offered, and he accepted with a minute little nod of his head. Draco smiled, tenderly, before it eased into a more assertive smirk.
"Yes, well, about that... it appears that she tried to apparate to Holyhead and something either went wrong or she redirected but, either way, she wound up in a muggle inn in Surrey."
"Ok." Draco stared intensely into his eyes. "Ok, let's see what you like," he said as he leaned in and captured Harry's bottom lip and sucked on it gently, his firm hands making their way to Harry's back. Harry mewled and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, pulling them closer and relishing the feel of his wet, toned muscles flexing against his skin. Draco paused to slowly run his teeth along the scruff of his jawline, stopping when he reached his ear and sucking on his earlobe. Harry gasped. "Remember to breathe," he said softly into his ear, the vibrations resonating directly in Harry's groin. "Be mindful of the sensations you feel in the here and now without getting stuck in your head. And if there's anything you don't like or you want me to stop, promise me you'll let me know." Harry moaned in response. Draco licked at the tender spot under his ear and Harry thought he might come undone. Draco pulled away abruptly and he was left whimpering.
Cedrick Diggory's birthmark had been tiny and on his left inner thigh. The only reason that Draco had ever noticed or dared to obsess over it was because the bloke's enormous dick always hung to the left and his eyes couldn't help but stray to it in the changing rooms after quidditch. The peculiar shape had puzzled him for over a year until he'd finally secretly gawked at the man enough that it clicked that it was, indeed, shaped like a hippogriff. There wasn't a straight bloke alive who would have noticed that detail...
Stevens' spinning, green head smiled smugly from the hearth and Harry tried to tamp back the seed of hope threatening to burgeon somewhere in the pit of his stomach.
Draco laughed. "Quite the contrary, Blaise -- he actually keeps me quite hard," he countered with a smirk, feeling triumphant when Blaise's mouth fell open, indignantly.
Harry turned to find that the Slytherin was, indeed, seated at a nearby table in full salesman mode as he attempted to rub elbows with the disinterested looking foreign wizard sat next to him. Harry thought he vaguely recognized the man.
"Sorry -- why am I dressed like I'm in a bloody choir and holding a stick?" he asked, screwing his face up in confusion and tossing his wand near the rubbish bin. "You must think I'm a complete ponce."
"Is that so?" His eyes were lit with amusement despite the fact that he was sure the innuendo probably went over Potter's pure little head.
bad at it." He whispered conspiratorially. The three kids all laughed. "He saved my life more than once and even gave me a pep talk once to keep me going. You know, you've gotta really hate your job to spur on the guy who's trying to take out your boss," he said, cheerfully, as if relaying a fun folktale.
Teddy laughed and Draco fixed him with a pointed glare which only succeeded in making him laugh harder.  Draco decided not to dignify either of their accusatory tones with a response (Buttercup just spoke to him! What of it?), and, instead, honed in on the wan look behind Harry's eyes.
now? Well, the Savior that you so badly seem to want to come to your rescue after you so brashly sought to ruin his life grew up orphaned, abused, malnourished and stalked by a ruthless psychopath!" he growled. Anavi's eyes widened with surprised and a glimmer of regret. "
"What? Oh, yea -- that's what my CI told me we needed to do when I went to meet him yesterday." He barked out a laugh in relief that it worked and shook his head. "He said that there was an undetectable amount of bulbadox juice and boomslang in the poison being used on the Celestina Warbeck records. He said he didn't actually know the bloke who told him so I thought it was all bollocks! Thank Merlin it worked!"
What had started off as Draco wanting to have a unique and heartfelt way to memorialize those who had touched him or he had wronged during the war had resulted in him incidentally becoming quite the horticulturalist. He always sent the bouquets anonymously, though, and plants and flowers weren't really the sort of things that people usually associated with Draco Malfoy, the Death Eater. He wasn't all together shocked that Harry Potter, Auror Extraordinaire, had figured out that it was him but...
Harry nodded. He had no doubt that Ron would've abandoned all sense, reason, and plans in an attempt to kill either of the two men had he known. "It wouldn't have been good. And I'm glad you didn't know because I wouldn't want you to carry that on your conscious."
Draco nodded then turned to his friends. "Well, what happened this morning was Harry's response to being triggered to a traumatic event. I knew what to do because I've seen him go through it before and understood what was happening." He wouldn't tell the details, that was Harry's story to tell.
He'd barely made it two steps into the large kitchen before he was forced to stop dead in his tracks at the most glorious scene he'd ever laid eyes upon: There, before him, stood Draco with his back to him, long blonde hair braided in that perfect fishtail and miles upon miles of alabaster skin and lean, taut muscles on full display. Harry's mouth dropped as he watched Draco skillfully use his wand to stir one pot while he tasted from another with a wooden spoon.
so guarded -- the freedom giving him permission to be his sassy self without having to mask it in a layer of meanness that disguised the queerness... A world where he had friends and community that actually understood those parts of him and embraced them... A world where maybe he could have Harry Potter by his side as soon as he figured out that he was most definitely bent...
was the one that was masochistic, but Hermione was right: It was the what if's that he couldn't live without knowing...
When Ginny had first suggested he go to a mind healer, he thought it'd be some stuffy old bloke or, with a name like Bubblykicks, some coddling, old biddy. Charlie had recommended her as someone who'd done great healing work with some of the Dragon trainers he knew so he guessed he shouldn't have been surprised when he walked into their first appointment to find the silver-haired witch sitting with her dragon hide boots kicked up on her desk.
Harry chewed on this. Draco was right, it didn't add up. Of course he knew that Krafft was a half-blood but, then again, so was Tom Riddle. Maybe he just had a horrible case of mummy issues...
"Harry, one outcome comes with a media frenzy headache that is over in a week but, the other... The other would mean that we're in for more running and hiding and fighting." And, he didn't want to say it, knowing how frightened Harry was of loss, but it wasn't lost on
"No, sir. Neither is Miss Pansy. Only my eldest master is here, sir. He and his friends have just set down in the drawing room for their monthly gobstones game. Would you like me to let him know that you're here?"
Ron shook his head. "I don't trust it, he's still a Slytherin. And with Zabini trying to put the moves on Ginny, I bet they're up to something."
Their magic buzzed and mingled in a way that Draco had never felt and his own breathing hitched as he picked up the pace.
"Ah, bollocks." Andromeda waved a hand dismissively. "Sounds like they still love ya, hun. They're just still holding out hope that you'll go back to conforming to whatever it is they want but, to hell with that!"
Harry would probably never forget those moments when the world truly seemed in danger of crashing in on itself. How he had waited with bated breath, mouth dry, and his whole being seemingly reduced to the sound of his own heartbeat in his ears, every passing second feeling like days.
"Ooh! Sweetie!" A girl in a tiger striped, hot-pink neon tank top and hot pants was embracing him. "You don't need him anyway! Fuck men!"
Harry nervously tapped his fingers against the black tablecloth that covered the posh little high-top table they were sat at. Ginny continued to gaze, unseeingly, at the purple flame floating in the lamp next to his head as the silence stretched on.
"Well, the way I see it, we really only have two: We say our goodbyes tonight... or I give it all up and we can be together."
have been possible in a Ministry controlled simulation) shone astonishingly bright. Draco fixed his sights on a terrified looking Sebastian who fumbled to reach for his chestnut wand.
Draco smirked, realizing that Harry was so close and he hadn't even touched his cock yet. As if he'd read Draco's mind, he tried to reach a hand between them, desperate for release, but Draco quickly pinned his hands above his head. Harry whimpered.
Sure, they were technically separated and she had basically told him to fly free -- to reconnect with Draco, even. But what kind of piece of shite would he be to move on or get wrapped up in some heated fling with an old flame before he's even made sure that she's still alive?
," he said again, this time pointing to the blonde man standing by the fountain chatting with a woman that Harry was pretty sure worked in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. He already looked all the part of the aristocratic businessman, his tailored robes a stark difference from the brown ones he'd worn here just 10 days ago.
He paused when he noticed the date of the alleged argument which was supposedly the last time that Ginny was seen.
"Wait, let me just get some owl treats then you can distract me all you want," he said, suggestively, as he quickly relieved the owl of her post and turned to head back inside for treats. He stopped short, however, when he glanced down and caught sight of the moving picture on the front page.
Draco didn't really know what he wanted or expected from any of this anymore, all he knew was that he'd never felt like this about anyone. What was hardest about it all was that he actually really cared about Potter and how he fared in this.
"ONE OF YOU LOT OR YOUR UNGRATEFUL LITTLE DEMON SEEDS MUST BE RESPONSIBLE!" Ollivander was shouting.
"Well Sebastian wasn't particularly secretive about his fascination with my past." Harry blinked back at him in surprise. "From the very beginning, he was curious about how, not only my views, but also -- maybe even moreso -- the public narrative around me had changed so vastly in such a short span of time."
Draco felt a surge of anger. "What? Harry, no. You matter. " He wouldn't look at him. "You matter so much and to so many people! Imagine what your life means to so many people? Imagine what your death would do to your friends? What it would do to me?" He reached up and cupped his face in his hand. Harry's eyes shined bright and he nodded.
Covetous eyes followed them in their wake and Draco became acutely aware of the fact that he didn't have use of his wand hand. He could kick himself for agreeing to something so ludicrous! Apparently, Potter noticed him stiffen because he briefly placed a reassuring hand on his back. Was he normally this touchy-feely?
Draco shook his head, still in his lap. Finally he looked up and the expression on Harry's face was carefully blank. "I haven't the slightest idea, Harry -- I swear! It's just... he was the only one I could talk to about you because he grew up so far away and he didn't know about all the
"Well, Sebastian, it's going to make finalizing the details on that big box quidditch supply chain preeetty hard without Benson. How about we reconvene at a later time when he can join us?"
She leaned across the counter, cleavage spilling out of her red sweater and over the top of the green smock. "Oh good, I'm glad you like it." She said, her smile growing wide and teasing, the little imp.
It had been five months of this already. Harry had half a mind to say bugger international cooperation and go to Australia to find this piece of scum himself!
Draco walked silently around the room. He didn't know why, but he needed to see Potter's face. It was still frozen in that shocked look, his black hair as disarrayed as always. Draco thought he could see horror in his bright green eyes as Yaxley used his fingers to widen his jaw. Draco winced when it resulted in an audible crack and a ghost of a scream came from Potter's throat. That meant that the spell was showing signs of wearing off if his vocal chords were starting to move. It didn't matter though because in that next moment, Yaxley had shoved his old, pulsing cock inside of Harry's mouth almost at the same time that Rowle rammed his own too huge cock roughly into his arse. Harry's eyes grew wider in pain and terror and his screams grew louder though they were now muffled around Yaxley.
. That one fact was what distinguished him from dream Draco: he knew the draw of that wand and he wanted nothing to do with it.
"He asked us if mandrakes ever made us think about our future kids because they always make him pray that his aren't that ugly. He walked off and Hannah and I talked for hours after about our dreams for the future," said Neville.
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
to play nice with Malfoy?" Hermione said, already exasperated as she took a seat next to Harry. "Us 8th years are supposed to be models for interhouse unity!"
He hadn't yet worked out how to tell his new wife that he'd made such an enormous decision without her before their marriage even begun.
"Oh, don't worry, love, I would've paid you a fortune to fuck off first." His lip twitched as he pretended to smile sweetly.
Suddenly, Kamal was no more. Instead, Harry felt a pure sense of terror as he registered the man with the salt and pepper beard and the flash of green light barreling straight towards his fiancé.
Draco was grateful that he'd opted to wear his warmest jumper today as Potter had, indeed, made him ditch the robes. He shivered as he apparated them to the address that Harry had given him, already yearning for the balmy, Australian temperatures. They appeared on a picturesque little suburban street with lawns that all still somehow looked perfectly manicured, despite the frost.
Harry stared into the flames intensely and Draco felt heat radiating off of him despite the coolness of the green flames.
Harry had been worried most about Ron's reaction. He turned to Draco to find gray eyes searching his own. He realized in that moment that this was another situation that he hadn't thought through. He'd asked Draco to join him as a support but they hadn't defined anything and his eyes widened as it dawned on him that Draco technically wasn't even out of the closet!
Draco opened and closed his mouth several times as he tried to find a way to dispute Harry's blatant flattery. Finally, he gave up and smiled sheepishly, looking up at Harry through long lashes. "I
"In all my years, I have never!" She shook her head and lead them over to the paisley patterned sofas to have a seat. "It was Monday morning and I had just checked out two guests when this red-headed lass landed in a rumpled heap in my fireplace! She was dressed quite oddly, like she was dressed up for one of those comic-con conventions they have in the city."
to hurt others, he didn't always have an outlet for that rage and he learned to turn it inwards until he finally imploded after the war. But, Healer Bubblykicks had helped him to find healthy outlets for that rage and the feelings underneath them.
His steps faltered when he caught sight his mother's long, white, flowing hair. She was sat at a small garden table near the fountain, facing away from him while one of the house elves fixed two cups of tea.
Harry found it hard not to stare at the beautiful, angelic looking man beside him between bites. He was still half-convinced that he was dreaming -- which made sense, he supposed, considering how often Draco Malfoy had consumed his dreams in the past five and a half years. But, now, he was here. Now, he had risked his own life to save Harry's arse. Now... he had just as good as proposed... And the thought of actually, truly having the chance at a life with this man...
"Oh, Harry, dear!" she beamed, enveloping Harry in a big hug and then stepping back to examine him with one hand on either side of his face. "I am so glad you're alright! Oh it was pure
"Ron..." Hermione placed a calming hand on Ron's arm to stop him when he pulled back with the intent to punch the blonde bloke in his face. Draco sat unflinchingly and sipped the tea Hermione had prepared. "What if what he's saying is true?"
The brunette woman shrugged. "It's showing up as a blip on the system. Percy says he's never seen it before."
Harry bit his lip and tried to hold on, but, as his eyes fluttered shut and he gripped her hips tightly, his mind supplied him with an image all its own: White blonde hair and pale, pale skin illuminated in gold, purple, orange and crimson hues from so many sunsets ago, as if still scorched onto his lids. The thought sent him flying over the edge and he threw his head back and cried out as he came, hard.
that's not what I want to taste right now," he said, voice low and rough in his ear as he let his arms, now wrapped around Draco's back, slide down his arse and stop at the back of his thighs.
"They're just a tough nut to crack! Look who we're talking about, mate -- it might just take a little bit of time!"
"Zachary, we might get to patronuses but, honestly, unless your duel is with a dementor then it's probably not going to help you too much for our purposes today. Now as for the
"Anavi... Just....... Why?" It didn't make any sense. Out of all the people he'd worked with, he'd have expected something like this from Jansen or even a disgruntled trainee but... never her. In all these years, he had only ever been nice to the administrative witch who had been such an integral part of their team and she had always been kind to him in return... They'd even exchanged Christmas cards that one year, for Merlin's sake!
was why Draco avoided Harry. What was he supposed to say if he ever came face to face with the man who'd been the sole focus of his thoughts (good or bad) since he was 11?
There was a long silence. Draco didn't really need him to answer; he couldn't remember a time since the war that the stoic man beside him had ever looked so depleted and defeated. After several long minutes, Harry finally spoke.
exploded. Finally, Hermione told me that she thought I was actually using wandless and that I should learn how to channel it. Practicing wandless magic was one of the things that finally gave me a sense of control again."
Even baby Rose seemed to sense that something was wrong, for she'd been nearly impossible to soothe for most of the day. Both Ron and Hermione had been too upset to go to work for the past two days so, on that particular afternoon, they were taking turns trying to soothe the baby, and then themselves, when there was a knock at the door of their small cottage.
fun." He looked over his shoulder as he spoke to Ron. "As much as I'd like to root for the Cannons, Puddlemere's seeker, Benjy Williams, is going to be a force this year."
pretend that this has anything to do with Malfoy! Ginny, can you seriously look me in the eyes and tell me that you think I don't
"What in the?" She bent low and examined it with narrowed eyes as it began to let out a thick, billowy cloud of
Lee chuckled. "Yea, and then down plops Ron out of nowhere, eating ham of all things, and he asks George: '
Across the way was where Ron had once sat before he'd left to join George at the shop more than two years ago now. So much had changed in the last 6 years. So many people had come and gone. But he had remained and he had long learned that he couldn't always count on people to stay -- it was out of his control. What he
Draco's smile went from shy to ravishing and Harry's eyes traveled down to it, automatically, making the moment feel charged and Draco's already distressed heart leap. Just when he was quite sure that Harry sodding Potter might literally be the death of him and that he didn't very much mind, something shifted for Harry and he dropped his hands to his side, the carefree, thrilled countenance from a moment before replaced by something more hesitant and doubtful.
and called it a day," he said, sourly, and tried to loosen his tie only to have his hand swatted away by a disapproving Hermione.
"No, Harry, of course not. But maybe bisexual..." Hermione squeaked out and then shrunk back as if expecting him to get angry. He didn't though, he stood in silence for a moment putting puzzle pieces together in his head, Ginny's cryptic breakup finally making sense. Was it possible that all of his friends had picked up on something
--" he whined as Blaise pulled him down the hall. He still had morning bedhead and that was just uncouth.
I realize that there a couple of things that might make you raise an eyebrow (Draco style) if you haven't read the prequel, Draco Hearts Spice Girls and Harry Potter. Here's some info that will be helpful to know for this chapter if you haven't read DHSGAHP:
have noticed the way the one dressed like a confused rocker (because who wore loafers and trousers with a leather jacket and Metallica hat, anyway?) held the other's hand when 7pm came and went without anything more eventful happening than the flight attendant's announcement that those in Zone B were now free to board.
Draco leaned in for a kiss, lips still brushing his salaciously as he spoke. "Nope, that's the Potter-Malfoy special. Now, let's hurry this along -- we have plans this weekend and I won't have any fun if you're obsessing through the whole damned thing. And Salazar forbid this shite bleed into the wedding." He shivered at the thought.
bad! This mystery thief could have been apparating to any place in bloody England! Potter was already shite at apparitions to places he was extremely familiar with and Pansy's house was completely foreign to him, Draco having apparated them there in the first place... He groaned. Potter wouldn't even know how to get back here if he tried!
"Why, I think you can, actually." Draco leaned on her cubicle casually. "See, my godson is visiting from Australia for his summer hols and I believe the little rascal has been sneaking off when I'm away at work."
, I do usually wind up being the one who winds up capturing my suspects even after they get the upperhand once, but still..."
He hadn't even bothered to tell Ron or Hermione about any of it since he'd left Hermione's office last Wednesday. As far as they knew, Harry had been a wreck because he was a sappy, confused bloke with a unrequited crush -- which wasn't that far off from the truth, honestly, so he figured he'd spare them the parts that would give them cause to worry that he might lose it. Besides, he didn't want to talk about it. It felt private and tragic and his and Draco's. How could they understand? How could anyone?
"Nothing! I just want you to be happy. Just... be very careful if you plan on getting closer to Malfoy. He
," he whispered and let out a hushed sigh of relief when the door actually clicked open and revealed a staircase leading to the basement below. As he eased down the stairs and past the barrier of the silencing charm, he could hear Yaxley and Rowle once more.
"Are you sure?" Draco leaned in so that his forehead was resting on Potter's, his lips so close that all Harry had to do was lean in just a bit more...
A hush grew around him and more and more eyes turned in his direction. Granger turned, wide eyes on him, too, just as surprised by the use of her first name as everyone else but it was important that she listen to him. He had a hunch that she might be the only one who could understand. He doubted most of the students even knew what dissociating was yet alone why Harry might be doing it. But she was the brightest witch in their year and one of Potter's best friends.
It was funny, really -- in a twisted sort of way. Draco had gambled everything for his parents' love, sacrificed everything that mattered! And he'd lost it anyways.
As he turned towards Borgin and Burke's, he was briefly stirred from his thoughts when he thought he saw the air shimmer around him. He paused but, when he saw nothing, he simply pushed forward and his mind drifted back to the task at hand. He sighed. Why, oh why, couldn't Dumbledore be one of those people who just laid down and got out of the way? The weight of what the Dark Lord had asked him to do settled like lead in his stomach. He knew that Mother feared that he had been given the task with the expectation that he would fail and to punish father for his failures. Draco refused to think this. He was clever and cunning and he could figure this out and gain the favor of the Dark Lord in this new world order along the way. No, he didn't
Harry, sensing the changing tide, walked backwards to the suspiciously still Whomping Willow and hovered with his hand above the bark. He raised a brow in challenge.
He felt his temper rising and it only peaked when he looked over Blaise's shoulder to find Portrait Snape looking at him with crossed arms and a scornful expression.
of it all! With a wistful smile, he leaned in to plant a light kiss on Harry's forehead and watched as emerald green eyes slowly blinked open, accompanied by a shy, sleepy grin.
Harry looked up at him, his eyes still red. He gave Draco a wry smile. "I don't know." He looked away before saying so quietly that Draco could barely hear him: "100."
"But then I came along and mucked it all up by disarming him." He stared at his loafers but Harry only pulled him closer.
Draco felt so torn in the situation. His deepest concern was for Harry, of course. He knew he was bound to be hurt in all of it but was it his place, as the bloke who'd hurt him and likely led to him being in the situation in the first place, to break it to him? And as much as he wanted to shout his friend down and call out that she devil, he knew it was complicated.
Draco grabbed Blaise by the sleeve and pulled him out into the corridor, looking around to make sure that they were out of earshot.
"How many times do I have to tell you?! She asked for a divorce on Sunday and said that she wasn't coming home. She was planning to stay at our friend's home!"
"Wow, Malfoy, you sure know how to give a compliment." Harry rolled his eyes but smiled wryly. "I haven't mastered it, per se. I've always been able to do it in an accidental sort of way when emotions were high. Not being raised in the wizarding world, I just assumed that it all fell under typical accidental magic that little kids experienced. After the war..." He looked at Draco sideways as if contemplating if this were something he really wanted to share. "Let's just say I was not well after the war... I was a mess. And losing control in every possible sense of the word..."
Harry shook his head and then gave up. "Oh, absolutely," he said, thickly, his voice cracking as the tears began to flow in earnest. "But only because I'm so, so happy."
She laced her fingers with his and he forced a terse smile right as the bright light flashed, leaving him temporarily blinded.
Fierce determination coursed through Harry's veins as he took the little slip of paper on which the address of a place in Appleby was scribbled. This guy was an arrogant, fucking prick. Let him send all the bullshite cryptic messages he wanted, Harry was coming for him and he planned to destroy him when he found him.
"You're not a good liar, Potter. Let me guess: you couldn't mind your own business and didn't think it all the way through, per usual?"
"Harry, how in the bloody hell are we supposed to get her from Australia? There's no way we can get a portkey when we're bloody fugitives!"
"Well, good morning to you, too," he purred, leaning in to steal an open mouthed kiss while his fingers made their way down the side of Harry's body, teasingly, with one destination in mind.
"For what reason, Draco? For all intents and purposes, you still just got married and are moving to the states... Wouldn't it be more humane to just let the bloke think you forgot so he could actually move on?"
He watched as Robards (apparently no longer imperiused), Proudfoot, Savage, Reynolds, Jansen and Stevens rushed towards the shoe shine booth and disappeared, one-by-one, behind it.
Harry had spent the whole week practicing mindfulness meditations in every spare moment he could find. While he had found the concept intriguing enough on its own, Draco had given him some external motivation that he couldn't resist.
He groaned around the head of his cock in that moment, the vibrations affecting Draco deliciously and a new wave of precum wetting his tongue. Harry just wanted to please him, to be good for him.
"So, they can't get into the flat and decide to wait for her at practice. One in the stands and one tucked away near the floo... Of course, she must’ve recognized them as soon as she landed in Holyhead and redirected," Draco deduced. However, it still raised the question: "
"Even if you do manage to convince the others to let you be your own free entity, it's best that you at least appear to be neutral. Nothing could possibly be more revealing of where you stand than befriending the very symbol of the light! They will not allow it, Draco!"
Hannah and Daphne were chatting merrily; Greg giggled drunkenly as he leaned against Neville (who looked slightly terrified as he tried to hold up his gargantuan frame); Pansy and Hermione had their heads together, plotting (a frightening sight, indeed!); Blaise was talking a seemingly intrigued Ron Weasley's ear off about getting in on the ground floor to invest in the quidditch world cup; Astoria and Ginny kikied over joining the ex-wives club; and Luna and Rolf were on stage singing some muggle song called
There was a brief, awkward moment when Draco pulled away and Harry wasn't sure what to do. Now, Ginny usually swallowed when she did this for him but...
It was nearly 3am and he hadn't slept a wink. Ron was snoring loudly from the bed beside him and Neville, Dean, and Seamus all seemed to be sleeping soundly. He pulled out the Marauders Map and looked to see who else might be awoke in the castle. Hermione was tucked away in the eighth year girl's dormitory and he wondered if she was still having troubles sleeping, too. Nights like this made him wish the dorms weren't separated by sex.
"Draco... What if it hurts less for you? What if the bonding ceremony makes you fall madly in love with your new wife and makes every one else feel... insignificant?"
The thief shouted the muffled incantation and the large shelves on either side of the door fell forward, blocking he and Potter's exit and giving the mysterious figure a head start.
Ron looked pained. "Please don't say that, Hermione! I'm still holding out hope that you two will get back together just so I don't have to worry about her," he said to Harry. "I mean, you're not even interested in any other girls, you don't think it's worth reconsidering?"
He was a persistent bugger, but Draco didn't mind. He made good company in a foreign land and he was slowly wearing down his guards. What had started as monthly meetings somehow turned into weekly lunches then nights out on the town with friends.
"Well, since you reported the disappearance of the wood carving knife, the thief has since targeted Hector Fawley's pocket compass, Josephina Flint's enchanted amulet, and Doria Shafiq's golden quill."
"Andromeda was my favorite sister." A flicker of pain flashed in her eyes at the admittance but she continued. "We were closer in age than Bellatrix and I but she still prided me as her baby sister. She was always kinder and gentler. Bella would kill for me but Andy would let me cry on her shoulder or crawl into her bed at night when I had a nightmare, well into our teens." She smiled sadly.
"I really wish you wouldn't," said Hermione from her position curled up next to Ron on the couch. She had intermittently switched between lecturing him about breaking rules and given him the cold shoulder all day. "But if you insist, be careful, Harry. And, I guess..." She crossed her arms and rolled her eyes at the idea of encouraging him. "Have fun."
-- sorry!" he corrected, realizing too late that that was probably a more suspicious response than just saying
"Well hello, Mister Big Shot," she teased as she titled her head up to kiss him hastily on the lips.
Draco turned, briefly revealing a perfect arse before he dived in. He turned to float peacefully on his back. Harry suddenly felt nervous. The last time he was naked around anyone was...
Draco thought about what Harry had said on the hill about why they'd both been capable of possessing the Elder Wand. After all he'd been through, Draco was no more afraid of death than he was of loving the man beside him. He'd long accepted that both were inevitable, he only now had faith that he could and
Ironically, it was the day after he'd proposed to Ginny that he found out that Draco must not have taken the soul bond after all as word of his pending divorce from Astoria finally made it across the pond. It was unfortunate timing, really, because he knew that it was the start of Ginny questioning whether or not Harry was really in this with her. And it certainly didn't help that his determination to avoid those emotional fires, even when they were threatening to consume him, had translated to his marriage. He wasn't as blind to the gaping holes there as he pretended to be but he avoided his feelings like a basilisk's gaze. He supposed he should feel angry at the blonde prat for not telling him about the soul bond, but he mostly tried not to feel anything when it came to Malfoy.
Harry reached out hesitantly and grabbed ahold of the gnarled hand. The lift doors opened onto the atrium and Harry watched in awe, marveling at the sheer amount of strategy and detail this plan must have taken as Draco, looking for all the world like a damn good Auror instead of an investment banker, threw the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder into the air and readied his wand.
"Hmm..." he hummed as he sat up to straddle Harry's hips and pulled his pajama shirt over his head. Harry licked his lips, eyes glued to Draco's bare skin as he sat up to slip off his own. "Maybe later," he said, rolling his hips and eliciting a delicious, raspy moan from Harry. He was just reaching for the tie on Harry's pajama bottoms when the sound of the floo coming to life downstairs made them both freeze.
! The situation was what it was and all he could do was accept it. Simple. "It was just a crush that couldn't be. There's no need for us to talk about--"
She pulled out the divorce papers from her purse and slid them across the table before gathering her things. In that moment, Harry thought that she had it wrong because he felt precisely like that confused, broken boy from after the war. He bowed his head in defeat.
Draco simply returned his attention to the case file and shrugged. "Its not like a I can produce an heir with a man."
She pushed him with her shoulder but laughed. She really was very pretty, if you were into girls, that is.
Then he heard the distinct voice of Davenport. "He did something to Harry! The death eater must've imperiused him! Get him!"
"I wish it was you. Only you." Draco had removed his arm and fixed Harry with red, watery eyes. Harry's heart tugged at the tears running down his cheeks. "I'm so sorry. Wish I was different. Wish I was stronger. Love you," he sniffed and closed his eyes, drifting off to sleep.
"I don't know, Potter, maybe I'm a masochist... Or maybe I just wanted any chance at redemption I could get and Auror seemed like the quickest, most tangible shot at it." He stared back at Harry who was watching him astutely.
He pressed a potions vial into his hand and Draco's jaw dropped and he stared back at Harry, incredulously.
" he hissed through gritted teeth, fighting to keep his voice even. Her eyes went wide and fearful as green bore into blue.
He smiled down at Harry who was laid against his shoulder nursing the same drink he'd had all night. He had been glued to his side from the moment Astoria had walked in and kissed Draco on the cheek. Draco laughed.
"No, Draco. This will go down in history as the one case that got me. The one case that stumped Harry Potter,
Were they all really just accepting him as a part of their family? Even though technically he wouldn't be in very short time? He'd expected interrogations, tough conversations... that they'd have to rely on Luna to come up with some weird puppet show to help the kids make sense of it! And that was if they even wanted anything to do with him in the first place. A part of him (the most insecure parts) almost expected no hoopla at all, just a stale goodbye and a gentle shove out the door, a
Draco's heart stopped for a moment and then threatened to beat out of his chest. He pushed through to the front of the crowd without another thought.
Harry shrugged as he watched Draco tour the tiny flat, mesmerized. "Well, I have my house at Grimmauld place -- I mostly stay there because it's obviously more convenient to use magic and for travel... but I like to come here whenever I need a break from the wizarding world," he added, somewhat sheepishly.
"And are those niffler cufflinks because of the magical heirloom theif you guys caught when not even Robards could catch a lead? Brilliant!"
Draco smiled, triumphantly, as the wand fire ceased, save for a final attempted stunner from where Harry must now stand. It wasn't until he heard Sebastian's fleeing footsteps run past him, heading east, that he was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. This needed to end. Now!
He eyed the bar cabinet in the corner ruefully and shook his head. Harry had promised himself years ago that he wouldn't let alcohol be his escape again. After the war, it had taken almost losing everything,
"And then you just left her there, by herself, to catch your portkey?" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice even.
McGonagall grabbed a tin of biscuits and waved her wand to make her chair float over to sit in the center, facing the semi-circle. "Ok, Mr. Potter. Can you start off by telling us what exactly
For the most part, the Potter's fourth anniversary had gone as planned. After ages of operating as ships passing in the night, he had expected spending a whole day together to be somewhat of an awkward experience. He was surprised, however, by the ease of which they'd slipped into conversation.
He swallowed and then nodded. "I'm sorry, Ginny. I didn't know.... when we were dating... I couldn't even let myself think about it when we were together. I mean, there was just so much guilt and shame around what happened to me and not wanting to be broken and wanting to live the life that everyone thought I should be living..." He paused to catch his breath and then shook his head at the sadness in her eyes. "I'm sorry that I hurt you by not having that figured out."
"Mr. Potter," beckoned a very guilt ridden Merrywhip as the class was dismissed. Ron and Hermione made to stick around but he nodded for them to go ahead without him. "My apologies, I didn't mean to put you on the spot..."
Malfoy's eyes gleamed with something menacing and his pupils widened infinitesimally at his words. His wand hand twitched but then his mouth worked into a slow smirk. "I should be hexing you to Hades, Potter, but... it looks like I've got a new cloak and I think it'd be more fun to leave you to the wolves."
He stood to grab another handful of the green powder and called out for his Melbourne home. Soon, he was looking out into the familiar, panoramic views of his sitting room.
"Well the curse breakers have already examined both the records and gramophones of two of the victims and didn't find anything," continued the sharp, grey haired wizard. "We've got the lab rats searching for potion residue now."
?!" A muggle inn? That was the last thing he was expecting him to say. "Draco, why is it that the more you say, the less any of this makes sense? And how do you even know any of this? I thought DMT said that they found nothing more than a '
Anger and loathing pulsed viscerally through Draco's veins as he stalked down the cobbled path of Diagon Alley. How dare Harry Fucking Potter, already the bane of his existence, talk to mother in that way! Like it wasn't enough that he had cost him his father and sullied the Malfoy name, but to outright disrespect his family in Madam Malkin's like that with the mudblood and blood traitor behind him! He'd show them! He'd show them all!
Merrywhip's face reddened as comprehension dawned. "My apologies, Mr. Potter," he said, solemnly, to Harry though he refused to so much as look in Draco's direction for the rest of the class.
"Draco, hunny!" he called out as he slid down next to him. Draco was sobbing, uncontrollably, as Harry pulled him into his lap. "I'm ok! Hunny, are you ok?"
"Look, Harry, there's absolutely no way you can work this. Not after what happened with Ginny," came the deep, dulcet voice that was anything but calming right now.
"What in the fuck did you just say?" His voice was soft and wispy, his throat too dry and his heart having stopped beating in his chest, altogether, only to take up residence in his ears.
"No! Of course not! Ron, how could I be? I'm not bent..." He said that last part a little weaker than he had intended.
He took a deep breath and readied himself, sweat beading on his brow and heart beating in his ears, and waited.
Draco chuckled lightly and then leaned in to capture Harry's lips with his. He placed his hand under Harry's chin and angled it to deepen the kiss. The warm, tingling sensation of the brandy settled right in his groin and made him pull away breathless. His voice was rough and his eyes glinting wickedly when he spoke again.
What was the point of trying to explain? Draco was going to move on with his new wife and go someplace where he'd never have to think about any of this ever again. Never have to think about
He conjured a seat and then sat down with his head in his hands. Finally he looked to his best mates.
plan was going to be tougher than he thought. And as if the universe was listening, his friend Kamal chose that moment to pop by and say:
Harry frowned as he thumbed through some of the files and came across pictures and article clippings dating back to the war...
Harry's heart melted and then clinched as he took in the sight before him and a completely unhelpful, impossible, painfully implausible thought started to form, unbidden.
Harry hadn't even made it to his desk before the panes of the large windows that looked out onto the bullpen shook as Ron slammed the door behind him. Ron angrily waved his wand to shutter the blinds (surely to the dismay of the still lingering onlookers) and it was barely a moment later before his best mate had crossed the length of the room and grabbed him roughly by the front of his robes.
"25 Under 25!" list last year. No amount of accolades, however, seemed to prevent him from being reduced to little more than a reformed teenage death eater and disappointing son whenever he returned home.
"Mr. Malfoy," Headmistress Mcgonagall spoke. "It appears your contributions to this war and the precarious situations you've been placed in, much like your godfather," she glanced at Snape's portrait who returned a curt nod, "have been greatly understated."
Draco ducked out from underneath the invisibility cloak and immediately lost sight of Harry. He briefly wondered where the other boy would go right now but told himself that he would be alright and that it wasn't his problem before turning back towards the brick wall. He was startled, however, when moments later Potter reappeared, suddenly throwing the cloak off with a flourish.
It felt so different from what he knew: Where Ginny had been soft and supple, Draco was angular and cut, lean muscles. Everything felt a little harder, including the cock now pressed against his thigh, and yet, somehow, it all felt
The Ministry was his first thought but that wouldn't be the first resort for Potter, not without having Draco bring the thief in with him. Robards would absolutely blame Draco for the separation and credit Harry with the capture if they didn't come in together. He could no longer deny that the man truly did seem to care about him, for whatever reason, and want him to succeed.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Snape, the man he had revered and respected, was killed over a
"Sweet baby Merlin!" Harry exclaimed against Draco's lips which were now forming into a smirk. He sped up the tempo and just when Harry was ready to cry out, sure he couldn't take it any more, he stopped!
Harry sagged with relief and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist just to make sure he didn't actually fall.
She shook her head. "That may be true, but not as much as him. And all this time, I've wondered... But I knew..." She shook her head again and Harry felt the blood drain from his face as he saw her make up her mind.
"Slowly." She frowned down at her report. She looked back up and bit her lip as if contemplating something.
"Sebastian, please don't make me regret mixing business with pleasure," he warned with a pointed brow. "I just needed a distraction."
"Erm... Yes, about that. Well, if you didn't know," he blushed as he looked to Daphne and Astoria. "I'm gay."
"We've had three more victims and, unfortunately, this week it came with a fatality." Savage said solemnly. "Little witch in Dorset. Gram of eight."
"I can't do this anymore!" he shouted, enraged and anguished as he made to stand up and leave. He was surprised when her hand shot out and wrapped around his left forearm. He looked down at it and then back at her. Her brow was furrowed in worry again but her face softened as she spoke:
"You're fine. You're good," he said, forcing a smile onto his face until it started to look somewhat natural. "You're fine."
Draco apparated into the vast English garden that had always been his refuge and immediately felt at home. It was sad, he thought, that every time he'd done that since his divorce, a part of him was always surprised that the wards still admitted him.
They had settled in at the bar of a night club that was booming the latest new muggle music and Draco was surprised that he liked it. One hour and many drinks later, he was not only smashed but he had also learned most of the words to at least three Spice Girl songs.
Harry swallowed dryly then abruptly pulled his head out of the fire, not even bothering to end the call.
Draco fought his shiver at the thought of the sweet little old lady getting up to things that were anything but sweet-little-old-lady-ish. Harry, on the other hand, was already on his way out of the door.
Harry and Draco both froze, wide-eyed like deer caught in headlights. It sounded like someone was pushed up against the door and they could practically hear the snogging.
Robards spoke out: "Ok, thus far, we've been working on increasingly strenuous skills and strategies and, until this point, the simulations have been the main way to test what you've learnt. Well, enough of that! Third year is
Things seemed to move in slow motion as Harry pushed Draco behind him and felt the fear and love and rage that he had pushed away for so long fill him from his core as something stirred within him that he hadn't felt in years.
She gave him a little smile but hesitated. "Oh, alright! It couldn't hurt," she said as she waved her wand and the document duplicated.
Kamal nodded. "I'll never forget the first time he came in here. He didn't look more than 6-years-old but I found out later that he was actually 10 -- they just weren't feeding him and were keeping him in confined spaces so he was malnourished." He shook his head ruefully. Meanwhile, Draco's heart was shattering. "I love to cook and I love to eat and a hungry child is one of the saddest things I can fathom. And on top of that, his Aunt and Uncle would have his fat beast of a cousin to pound him into submission. It was awful. I told him that very day that whenever he could get away then this place would always be a safe space and a free meal." He poked his chest out proudly.
"Oh, Harry!" Draco called out as his cock pulsed, filling Harry's mouth with warm rivulets of his seed. He stared up at Draco, ardently, mouth still wrapped around his partner's softening cock as he came down until Draco finally urged him to stand.
Draco donned his unbothered-Malfoy-mask. "I know this might be a particularly hard concept for you to grasp, but it's none of your concern, Potter," he said as he walked off and turned into his Advanced Arithmancy classroom without another word.
"She's in Australia?! How in the world would he get her to Australia?! You can't just sneak someone through customs on an international portkey..." Harry stated, just as confused as Draco.
to say but, alas, he was no closer to knowing how to approach this now than he probably ever would be. He took a deep breath and, conjuring up some Gryffindor courage, rapt briskly on the brass knocker.
Draco wrapped his arms around his neck and stared directly into emerald eyes, Harry's glasses discarded somewhere off to the side. He looked so raw and unguarded this way.
he'd been able to do, just by leveraging the sheer amount of privilege he'd been granted even when he could have -- no,
Ginny smiled smugly from where she stood, squeezed in between Mr. and Mrs. Weasley with Blaise standing awkwardly off to the side.
"Oh, that was hilarious!" said Bill. "He flooed me and Charlie for advice and we just shrugged and told him to go for it."
Draco rolled his eyes, he had completely forgotten he was wearing them. "I look like a swot," he said as he took them off and slid them into his robe pocket. He shivered and pulled the cloak closer. "What do you want
They were met with incredulous stares as they casually entered the apparition room full of witches and wizards -- who likely still hadn't yet heard the news that they had been acquitted and, thus, must've thought they had some nerve -- but Harry couldn't care. His heart felt so full. He flashed his newly restored Head Auror badge that allowed them to skip the line and apparated them straight to Grimmauld Place.
Draco gave them both an endearing smile as he joined him under their tree. He ruffled Teddy's hair before Andromeda called him to her side so that Draco could take both of Harry's hands in his.
"Ginny, he didn't do anything." He sighed. "McGonagall and Penelope are here and they want to know what happened earlier."
"Don't be nervous -- see, even the little teeny boppers do it." He pointed at the gaggle of thirteen year olds with lollipops ahead of him.
Draco opened his mouth to protest as they were pushed roughly out onto the cobbled road but the door slammed shut before he could even turn around.
As it were, in the past five months, they had already developed their own routines, their own rhythm and, by some divine intervention, everything else seemed to be subtly clicking into place: They were officially settled into the quaint little villa Draco had fallen in love with (and he'd been thrilled when Harry'd let him talk him into setting up a muggle media room so they could watch MTV); working from the London office with Blaise and Alexandra for companionship had actually proven to be more fun than he was willing to admit; he loved volunteering at the center with Harry on the weekends (he still couldn't believe Harry had let him teach the kids that Beyonce choreography last week but he was pretty sure it now made him their favorite volunteer); and even the consulting work he'd been doing with Granger-Weasley felt oddly magnanimous and important. Now, in just eleven days, they would finally be Mr. and Mr. Potter-Malfoy! There was even something harmonious about the date: June 12th, the anniversary of the day they'd joined as partners all those years ago and the first time in six years that it was to fall on the second Tuesday of the month.
that there was also the possibility that they'd both be burying people they loved at the end of this. "We might not have peace again for a long time after 7pm tonight. Harry, it's OK to enjoy it while you can. If you don't want to for other reasons, then that's ok. I just think you're being unfair to yourself if it's the
"Perhaps..." He was deep in thought. "Is there any chance I might get a copy of that?" He implored innocently. When she looked sceptical, he pushed. "His mum will never believe me -- thinks he's a right angel."
"Ha!" she barked. "What's the bloody point of that, Harry? You're just going to do what you want regardless. The question is just what
There was anguish in her eyes and the intent was clear as she stared into Draco's. His heart beat was back but now it was stuck in his throat.
Draco felt himself floating, barely there in the days to come and teetering on an impossible decision.
There was an excited, frantic energy in the room but Draco let his eyes shut momentarily in defeat. He'd pointedly isolated himself from the start. He knew that he'd joined as the pariah and so he made sure to keep to himself, avoiding the group lunches and team nights out. It probably didn't help that he was still a down right bitch to most of them. He probably should've played nice but his Slytherin instincts told him to defend himself and he couldn't help it if his best defenses were... moderately offensive. Boy had this come back to bite him in the arse. He looked around the room where all the best candidates who might leave him with even a slim chance of avoiding being picked off by Robards' vengeful cuts were already eyeing the friend they were considering for their partner. Potter was stood next to the red-headed buffoon, of course.
Jubilant laughs and cheers echoed off the hillside and the little wizard waved his wand in a shower of stars. Harry wasted no time in pulling his
. Ginny knew." He looked toward the floor and shook his head. When he looked back up, his brow was troubled. "Potter, I didn't see you and Ginny enter the restaurant. I left the table before Draco and the others to use the gentlemen's room and, when I went back to collect my cloak, you and Ginny happened to be sat at the table directly in front of where Draco and I had sat for our meeting! I couldn't believe it! You had your back to me but Ginny was just there, looking right at me. She had promised she would give you the papers and... I couldn't resist! I sat back down to see if she would..."
Harry dropped to his knees and sat back on his heels. He closed his eyes as long fingers made their way through his hair and scraped soothingly against his scalp. They stilled and tugged forcefully, forcing him to stare up at Draco, expectantly.
Potter was doing it in the first place. Was he really delusional enough to believe all that stuff he said or was he just trying to weave a tale for the kids?
Draco caught Harry's eye and smiled, warmly. He shook his head solemnly as he returned his gaze to his estranged aunt.
"If it makes you feel any better... I get it. I'm just better at casting good glamours, apparently. You should really learn to meditate. Mindfulness meditations help me."
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
Draco had, in fact, tried to confront his friend on one of his rare visits home three years ago after Blaise's
Harry looked down at his hands and shook his head. Ginny had left a clue that only he could ever pick up on in a place that probably no one else in their world was as familiar with. The clever witch was leaving him a trail.
"Ron, just consider what we know... We know they were getting a divorce and Harry said there were some things he didn't want to talk about... And we both saw how he reacted when we saw Zabini at the inauguration... Is it too much to consider that Ginny might've..."
"Well, they should!" Harry's brows knit together in concern but Draco rubbed the back of his hand with his thumb as if trying to give
"Of course we will. Now please get the bloody hell out of my sight, the lot of you, and go chase down some goddamn leads! Proudfoot, I want everything you've got on the latest 3 victims on my desk in the next hour," he commanded and his crew began to disperse, grumbling their theories about who pissed in this coffee that morning. He closed his eyes and removed his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose. When he opened them, Stevens was still there.
Harry shook his head before looking back up at Draco. "This might sound crazy, but I really thought I must be the only one having a hard time being here. Literally no one talks about it. It's like we're all trying to prove we're strong enough to persevere. Trying to show that Voldemort hasn't won by continuing to disrupt our lives or something."
Draco bristled at Harry's side. He spared Harry a fleeting, nervous glance before turning his full attention back to Krafft. His nerves were replaced with adrenaline as the full weight of the situation dawned on him: he may be immune to the full extent of the Elder Wand but Harry...
"But what about --" He gave her a sidelong glance that made her falter. "But no, really, Harry! This one's at Hogwarts and it's a great opportunity! Apparently Flitwick and the new DADA professor would like you to personally head up the new dueling club. It starts on Halloween so there's plenty of time to prep!" she whined.
"Ha! Not with Puddlemere just snagging their chaser. Wilda Griffiths just signed with Puddlemere," Draco added.
What very little color Malfoy had seemed to drain from his face and Harry turned panicked eyes to Ron as if he desperately wanted to ask him what his normal was.
"Figures," he said. Nott being out there, unaccounted for, made him nervous but knowing that he was being hunted by the MLE was reassuring. A not-so-smart son of a death eater on the run for casting an unforgivable that nearly hit the savior just did not stand a chance.
Harry's brows shot up. "Not ready? Is it really that different from sex with a girl?" Sure, body angles would be different but, essentially...
Hermione and Ron looked at each other with wide eyes as they quickly dropped the note. Harry jumped into action, rushing to the cupboard in the corner of the room and grabbing the bezoar and bubotuber pus from the first aid kit.
"Ow! Ow! Ow! OW!" he whimpered as he nursed his hand. For someone who was averse to pain and blood, he really needed to stop doing that, he thought.
"I'm going to choose to ignore that bit, but," He glanced back down at the note with narrowed eyes. "what
"Nothing, you're just cute when you're jealous." He snaked his arm around Harry's waist and squeezed him closer, planting a soft kiss in black hair. "Merlin only knows
"Well..." he said, examining Harry's work. "This is poison." He pointed at the contents of the cauldron and Harry's face dropped.
I shouldn't be that stupid'. Consider giving you a choice in all of this and what not..." He smiled ruefully.
"Malfoy, what are the odds that they'll strike tonight? Do you think we could catch them in action?"
!" he hissed as he quietly stomped through the house with Potter in tow. "And! Let's not forget, could've blown my cover to boot!"
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Harry smiled. He felt so grateful for his friend. "Thanks, mate. That's all I really want is a real chance to work at this with Draco and there are already so many hurdles that we'll have to get over that we haven't even talked about yet. There's clearly a lot of history to overcome and..." he paused, suddenly feeling somber.
Harry noticed that Draco's left arm was still wrapped around his middle protectively. He'd never really stopped too long to think about what tortures Draco must've witnessed or even been forced to participate in when Voldemort took over his home. Had he been tortured, too? The idea that Voldemort might be understanding enough to leave him unscathed after he had failed to kill Dumbledore seemed unlikely.
He turned back to his friends excitedly before answering. "Walden, sir. Walden Farrow. This is Ariela and Willamina." He pointed his thumb at the Hufflepuff and the Slytherin in turn. "Ummm... Mr. Potter, sir? ...Why are you sitting with the death eater?"
He frowned in thought. How bizarre. A spell that bound five families and made it so that neither of them could talk about what went on between them. Why? And for how long? Did it run through the blood lines? His eyes widened.
"Sorry, professor," Harry said, joining her and Periwinkle with Draco at his side. Periwinkle looked Draco up and down with her mouth twisted in concentration like she was trying to figure out how to solve a problem. He frowned at her. "They're here because what happened today made me realize that I can't hide from some things that I've been hiding from and I need some support if I want to actually be... ok."
"Please don't," Harry cut him off, a plea in his eye. He watched as blonde eyebrows threatened to disappear into Draco's hairline.
I was going to lose you." He shook his head. "Draco, I wasn't ok! No where near it! All that wound up happening when you left was that I shut down even more than before..."
They scrambled to pull apart only to find the ancient house elf struggling with a man who looked more basset hound than man. Draco absently wondered if he may actually have fleas.
He mouthed to Harry. He didn't even have to look at Ginny to feel the fury emanating from her direction.
"Plus, I'll publicly show my support for both of you," Harry said. "We'll all walk to the Great Hall together and I can be nice and supportive while the two of you hold hands. That way, it will hopefully be clear that this isn't a surprise to me and that we've been broken up at least long enough for you to form a new relationship and for me to be ok enough to give you my blessing. And that way when me and Draco eventually come out they wont think I stepped out on Ginny, either."
"I'm going to move them now. It might burn a little bit but if you feel more pain than pleasure, tell me to stop."
He shakily threw the green powder into the hearth and kneeled as the flames roared green. He stuck his head into the cool flames and called for Luna's place.
become overly curious about the lot of them as of late... And, come to think of it... all of the drunken conversations about Harry had almost always been started by Sebastian...
As if she could sense his gaze, she turned and they locked eyes causing her to abruptly drop her hand and nod her goodbyes to Blaise.
Harry swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly going dry. "Well... I've probably thought about sex more in the past 48 hours than I've ever done in my life and... there's something about the idea of it being with
more than that but, despite Pansy's constant insistence that he just needed a shag, Draco had been hesitant to cross
"Maybe not... I've had a lot of big losses in my life and, yes, I've been a little fucked up but still ok, you know?"
. It wouldn't work." Harry didn't expect to feel so disheartened by those words. But then Malfoy continued: "Not like I'm used to, at least. It couldn't just be a random hook up or no strings attached. When has anything between us ever come without strings? Strings with you already gets so messy and tangled... But the crazy part is, even though I run from strings and attachment, somehow, I wouldn't even want a life with you in it without the strings." He resumed caressing his hair and stared into his eyes warmly.
"Do you think the floo was tampered with?" Hermione furrowed her brow in thought, worry etched on her face.
"What? You mean how is it different from being raped?" he asked gently though his eyebrow was raised. Harry nodded slowly. It was weird that he was able to hear the word without it holding quite the sting it once did -- even just an hour ago! "Well, for starters, it should be with someone that you actually want to have sex with. And it shouldn't hurt. Unless you want it to, of course... And in those instances it should be with someone you trust and feel comfortable enough with to talk about your needs and likes and limits and discomforts and know that it will be respected. And of course, it should actually feel
"Well can you be one, just this once?" He smiled, imploringly. Alexandra had been a godsend to he and Blaise in her 4 years as their secretary. "Come on, Alex. I've seen you work with less in bigger time crunches!"
Molly shook her head. "No, no need to explain, dear. If you had told me just two weeks ago that I'd be letting my favourite-son-in-law go without a fight, I'd have hexed your toes off." She shot Harry a wry smile. "But something like this... Harry, I just want you to be happy. You've been my son long before you were my son-in-law and the last thing I want either you or Ginny doing is forcing something that doesn't make you happy. And if it's young men that make you happy, well..."
I kept my word! Glad I was able to get the second one out today, I feel like this one and the last chapter just feel right read together. Hope you're enjoying so far!
Regardless, he had survived it. Each instance may have left him slightly broken but never destroyed beyond repair. Would it make a difference now if he were actually able to say goodbye on
figure out the whole wandless thing, but he'd certainly been thinking that now would probably be the time to try. "No, mate, I know better than to underestimate you or that Potter bloke, again," he huffed.
Harry eyed the last bit of his food wistfully but nodded. He stood and headed towards the door, shouting good-byes to his friends at the counter along the way. Draco hesitated. He eyed the heavily battered cod warily and, once he was sure that Potter wasn't looking, plopped the last of it into his mouth.
-- when I was destined to be extraordinary! So, you see, for ages I've been on a mission to find it!
Draco laughed to himself and made sure to take his sweet time unwrapping the wriggling frog before taking a big bite, relishing keeping Harry waiting while he chewed. Harry rolled his eyes and waved his wand, wordlessly summoning a pillow which he promptly whacked him over the head with.
to think about). Yet and still, no amount of accolades was ever enough to escape the fact that he was little more than a reformed teenage death eater and disappointing son whenever he returned home to Not-So-Merry-Old-England.
The loud, jarring sound of marble cracking echoed through the still grounds and Draco turned his back to the scene, gaze fixed on the glowing bindings around his wrists. He shut his eyes tight and waited with bated breath. He didn't need to see what came next.
Harry sighed. He didn't know where he and Malfoy stood. So much had happened in these past 2 years, some of it horrible, some of it painful, and half of it they seemed to have an unspoken rule to just not talk about. On "
"Your main course will be out in just a couple of moments Mr. and Mrs. Potter, is there anything else I can get you?"
Draco tried not to think about those days in the Manor when the Dark Lord had resided and done so many unspeakable things there. The kidnapping of the wand maker was one of the many things that hadn't made much sense to him, at the time. The Dark Lord had taken father's wand, leaving him emasculated and defenseless and, despite all his flaws or their strained relationship, Draco hated to remember him that way. And, honestly, if the stunt hadn't meant that both his mother
"I don't understand!" Granger said on the verge of tears as she tried again to cast the right spell. "Nothing's working!"
' thing but, like, little things -- like, if I hadn't ate that shepherd's pie that one time, would I be with Hermione?"
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
Harry chuckled. "Go ahead, say it." Malfoy fought back a smile and shook his head which just made Harry laugh harder. He was finding an unexpected sense of joy in being able to put cracks in the Malfoy mask. "You look like you're having a fit, you might as well go ahead and say it! You know you want to!" he teased, smiling mischievously.
"Oh, twas some Indian chick. All business like. She looked righ' out of place in a pub in Yorkshire, she did."
"Now, let me take care of you," he said, pushing Harry back and climbing back into the bed. "Harry, you've never had
Draco shook his head. "It's different now and you know it. And this bubble bursts in a week and you'll go back to calling me Malfoy and, for everyone else, it will be completely unremarkable. For us, however, it will forever be a reminder of what almost was but couldn't be."
the Warbeck case..." Harry said, his own rage building. This was a sick and extremely meticulous man they were dealing with.
He heard the sound of footsteps shuffling towards the door and a muffled incantation before the door was pulled open and a shock of white blonde hair poked out.
Harry rolled over onto his back, face flushed and sweaty and wearing an exhilarated smile. He sat up and kissed Draco, sweetly, pulling him down on top of him as he laid back down.
Harry shook his head. "Draco, I..." He looked away. "I don't like asking people for help. I couldn't growing up without being... punished." He swallowed again and Draco screwed up his face in confusion. He'd always imagined Harry having some life where he had been the center of attention but, he realized now that he knew nothing about what Harry's life was like outside of Hogwarts. "My relatives were physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive... Draco, I never knew that I could be loved and cared about until that day I met the Weasleys when we were 11... They made me a part of their family right there on the spot, with no conditions, as I was standing there with no clue of how to get onto platform 9¾. And they did it for no other reason than because they saw that I was lost in more ways than one and I needed it, not because I was supposedly famous."
It wasn't long before Potter joined Draco who was already fast at work, pouring over the case file in the little booth. Potter salivated over whatever foul excuse of a meal he'd just ordered and Draco scrunched up his nose when Harry had the
He placed one hand on either side of Draco's face and kissed him, full on. Draco looked surprised by the sudden action and even more surprised to see Harry's eyes bright with un-shed tears.
"Well... Merlin, this was so long ago... Maybe six months ago or so... We were all out day-drinking at an Oceana Wizarding Pride event and he was talking about Gregorovitch, the famous wand maker, and I told him that we have Ollivander back at home. I remembered the odd encounter we had with him on that case we worked and shared the bit about the Elder Wand as a farce... Salazar, why would I ever think that was
"Erhm," the bloke cleared his throat and shook his head as he continued. "I was saying that we only know one side of the story. We know very little about yous lot or what any of this might mean." He gestured to the box.
