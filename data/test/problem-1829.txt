She turned the show of when they came on, but Vernon raged about it for hours.
“Why are we telling us how happy we are, to be friends?” Blaise gently pushes Hermione's files away to make space for him. Harry is once again reminded how much his inner circle has changed in the last ten years. He is deeply grateful for the two Slytherins, who somehow wormed their way into their hearts, first Pansy with a sincere apology in their eighth year, and a gentle patience to wait for Ron when the fast paced romance with Hermione burned out in the same year. Then Blaise with his thirst for knowledge that had rivalled Hermione’s, and a nonchalant way to teach him how to deal with the constant pressure of the press.
He doesn’t quite know what to do about it though. And he can’t explain where his desire to see Harry Potter succeed at life again has come from.
“You won’t - just trust me.”

“Ok, so that is out. Then there is only one other option and you probably won’t like it. While you were unconscious I ran a couple tests, and I am in the position to offer my own magical strength to keep this pregnancy going.”
It is quiet. An eerie absence of sound and he tries his very best to keep it that way. As long as he is invisible he has at least the illusion of being safe.
“What?” Minerva betrayed her bafflement
He also realises that he is definitely not the only one with issues left from the war, more than once he gently wakes Harry from nightmares or sees him withdrawn into himself. Harry is unreachable when he is in that state, and either Draco or Hermione just wait it out with him. It is during one of their vigils that she asks about their relationship, and Draco answers her truthfully.
“She could end up a Squib?” Harry inquires.
Draco sighs. It won’t do to tell her that she had him with the mention that Harry never saw the magical Yule decorations. Also she probably needs to do some shopping for gifts as well. So he will take Teddy out of her hair for a bit and show Harry the magic that is Yule in the wizarding world.
* Meeting Lucy *
“Well, hi is better than the hex I was expecting.” Draco raises his eyebrow.
"No, Harry, please believe me, if it were only the engagement, I would not object at all." Draco felt his face heat up.
"Ok, I give up. No picnic with Victor either." He had apparated back to the Manor and sulked in his room, right through the apologetic note that Victor sent, explaining that he had caught a very bad cold and that they would probably be better off as friends.
"Yes, and to add insult to injury, she has decided on a colour-scheme" Pansy grimaces and he knows, "Shades of Pink." He blurts out before Pansy can, and she blinks.
"Because it just says you have to accept your role as my consort, and seeing that these books are from the 16th century, I am guessing any form of intimacy beyond a kiss would be enough. Or we could first try that you just stay overnight, in my bed without anything."
All in all not much has changed since the summer, while everything is different at the same time. He wakes, attends class, eats, does his assignments and goes to bed. He doesn’t think that this will change until the end of his eight year.
"No! You know as well as I do that my love life is nonexistent:" Harry swallows. "Why would you do this?"
Draco tightens his embrace a bit, and Harry melts even more against him.
Classes pass like a blur, but when he looks at the last period he does a double take. There in bold black letter is written “Ballroom Dancing”
"Well, if I may cite Mr Ollivander, 'the best results, will always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience; the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.' Even if I cannot fix your wand, you will be able to find one that can work for you. I am picking Hawthorn wands because the wood itself is suited to your personality."
"You know your wand has a unicorn core. This core generally produces the most consistent magic, and is one of the materials least subject to fluctuations and blockages. As Ollivander has probably told you wands with unicorn cores generally are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their chosen owner, irrespectively whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard. But you are a strong wizard. For your wand to react like this, it could indicate that your wand has become melancholy."
"The only thing you need to stop is being afraid. I will take this wonderful robe off before I do anything, but only because I would hate for your hard work to go to waste." He finds his mouth claimed thoroughly and all thoughts leave his head. The studio is dark, nobody is here, and the couch in the corner beckons to him. When breathing becomes an issue he tears himself away for a second.

"Well laughter is better, than a hex and being yelled at." he brings out after a while and Draco sobers at that.
“She did. I wrote to her about something that I found in the Manor, and she told me to come to you, that you would not hold my heritage against me. I think she fears I might go insane all alone.”
“I waited for you. Let’s head to breakfast?” Potter continues to talk as if he has not just upended his entire world. Draco just walks with him, baffled by this development.
Harry coughs. “Oh no, I think I have never seen you carry him like this. It looks nice.” He holds out his arm, and Draco steps up to him, Teddy secure between them as they Apparate to Diagon Alley. Draco is a bit dizzy once the squeezing sensation retreats and feels Harry’s hand steadying him at the small of his back. This action causes him to blush again, but Draco resolves not to read anything into it.
When they were alone at last Draco guided him towards a huge tree "That is a papaya tree.." Harry leaned against the tree trunk and wondered if Draco would finally make a move, but he just leaned close and breathed in.
“Well-” Harry didn’t look straight up, a clear indicator for his guilt. “I wanted to get a reaction from him.”
June turned into July and July into August in this manner.
“Damn that is cold!” He felt his balls try to climb into his body and was immensely grateful for his underpants. While he was not on the small side, the sheer frigidness of the water would have caused him embarrassment.
"What do you think?" Harry's laugh sounds harsh. "I am the only remaining living family member of the Potter clan. I get informed immediately if something that changes the status quo happens. But when I got over the shock I decided to give Draco the chance to be who he wanted to be, without your meddling. I was already in love with him back then, and I wanted him to be happy!"
"You are mine now, to cherish and protect, just like I am yours." The light pulses gently before it sinks into their skin, and a circle of runes appears around both of their wrists.
“I’ll try,” Harry mumbles and blushes again.
“You look amazing.” Harry kisses him again, “ready for another one?”
"Tora, she must have slept on my robes again." I am mortified.
Draco stares wide-eyed at his wrist and at Harry.
"Yes she is well, and I am sure that she would love to hear from you. I understand if you don't want to give up what you have built here for you, but I am sure that she will understand that as well."
“Let me check. She should be up for a bit before we can administer the next round of potions.” The Healer smiles at the two of them and exits the room.
“Well then we are doomed, because there is no way I will ever fall in love with you.”
Harry rubbed his tired eyes, lifting his head. He had been scoring the books in the library for what felt like ages and still had not found a real explanation. Seeing Tibby standing in the door with her hands on her hips he couldn't contain a smile. "So what do you suggest?"
Even though he was still hurting. Knew the grief would overwhelm him, once he had time to process the things that he rationally already knew, but could not emotionally process for the time being. Now there also was something new.
“Have you ever heard of Anhedonia?” He looks straight at the wall.
"I trust you, Harry."
"Lucy is a therapy dog. She decided you needed her at the moment. Seems like she was right.".
Harry refused to dwell on the problem and threw himself into work, graduated top of the Auror Class in 2002 and began to work. And work was all that stayed with him for the next two years.
The wand felt warm in his hand. Draco swished it softly, as if not fully daring to believe that his wand, the one that had chosen him, was back in his hand. But it worked flawlessly. If anything, the sparks that erupted from the tip were a little brighter than before. It felt as if something more had settled into the wand. Draco knew he would not be able to explain it, but it felt comforting, if one would be inclined for sentimental drivel, Draco would have described the feeling of comfort almost as if the wand understood his inner conflicts, and need of absolution.
Pig took the parchment, and fluttered out of the window.
"Harry, your wand represents you; you are a protector at heart." Bill smiled "Tell me more about this ritual."
“See, this is why I didn't say anything! I wanted you for my birthday, and I got you and I also know that you would have stopped any time, should I have said so. You are infuriatingly noble, and I lo...” Draco stops abruptly, not wanting to spill all of his secrets at once, but Harry has always known him better than anyone. He finds himself subjected to a soft kiss and melts back into the sheets.
“Yes, Minerva I never wanted to hurt Draco or the Slytherins. I only cast the Flurry Charm. It was supposed to make it snow in the Slytherin common room, but instead, Draco here turned up with his personal snowstorm and the Dungeons are flooded.
Warmth suffused him, finding himself imagining the scene so vividly that he could almost smell the dessert he had loved as a child. He didn’t understand why he longed for this domestic scene so much.
“I have no idea, where you got the crazy notion from that you had to be a hero, to get my attention. Merlin, Harry I think you have no idea how NOT to be a hero. But I don’t want you to go out of your way, rushing into danger because you feel like I ignore you. I thought that is what you wanted, professional distance. And the next thing I know is that Ron is tearing into me, for making you go on this undercover mission, because I broke your heart. And then we get the call that you are here, in critical condition. You have no idea how that felt for me.”
“Ah, Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy, I had hoped you would drop by.”
Draco breathed heavily.
A small smile tugged at the corner of Draco’s mouth, and Harry realized that the other man looked tired.
! It is so beautiful there, and since it is a weekday we might even put our feet into the water.”
Pansy looks at me, and I really, really hate the way this is going. And yes here it comes. “Draco you can lie to yourself all that you want, but I suggest you go back to that night and take a look at yourself. If you still don’t believe me then, I won’t say anything any more. But for Merlin's sake, you have a chance at happiness, and you won’t take it when you both deserve so much more. At least talk to the man!”
Draco feels his heart expand at the scene and withdraws carefully into the kitchen.
As he headed back to the hotel to take a shower, and change his clothes, he found that he looked forward to spending time with someone from his past.
“What good would it do?” Draco takes a deep breath. “It would not make anything better, and frankly I am not in a position where I take pleasure in petty revenge. Blaise is right, that I hurt many people and never said sorry. He went about it wrong, but he is not entirely wrong.”
Oh, how wrong he is…
Teddy had fallen asleep next to Draco, tired out by the day in the snow and Harry looked at his lover. The tender look that Draco bestowed on the little boy that had curled up next to him, warmed Harry’s heart.
Philippe is gone.
“Unless you have someone in your life.” It seems so obvious that he just keeps talking, without registering the shock on Draco’s face “Of course, your partner is in France, I am such a selfish idiot keeping you here.”
Harry remains quiet for what seems like a long time. Draco curls into his chest, trying to make sense of the words he just read.
The last class of the day approaches much faster than he wants, but at least the humiliation will be over for this week. Maybe Hermione will take pity on him and partner with him. But his hope is dashed when he gets to the large hall and sees the Sorting Hat, lying on the table next to the professor.
“You have never loved anybody?” Harry can’t believe what he is hearing.
"Not quite, I make a design first, that is I draw a picture of what I want a robe to look like." And he does it at the very moment, looking at Harry, he sees the deep greens and the seafoam colour in his mind, throwing strong lines onto paper and colouring the sketch with his magical brush, that draws the shades directly from his brain.
"What." he blearily looked at her, his bloodshot eyes, having trouble focusing. "Gin, how did you get in?"
“Be right back, there is an owl at the window.” He pads over and lets the bird in.
“You were right, the food is amazing. It would have been a shame to destroy their reputation.”
He loved the feeling of water on his skin and was aware of the looks of admiration that he received from several people at the beach. But he didn't care for them, only thinking of Draco and his happy smile, and confident demeanour.
"Yeah." Draco looks at his own wrist with wonder, and Harry realizes that he didn't expect it to be there.
This morning is particularly bad. Even getting up requires effort, but he has promised Mipsy to finish the library soon, and there is still a lot of work to be done. The fire in his room is already going by the time he manages to drag his body out of bed, and there is a chill in his bones that he can’t seem to shake. Even worse, he presumes, is that he can hear the walls whisper to him, calling for him. Well, he would do whatever they want if they could be clearer in their instructions. As it is the soft pleading is driving him spare. No clear words, but the tone is cajoling, as if he should know what they want from him.
Three weeks later he receives the information that the travel ban has been lifted and that he is allowed a monthly stipend from the Malfoy Vaults for his living. The owl that brings the news also carries a Handwritten Note.
“We would severely recommend it. If she leaves too early she might suffer a relapse, and her magical core might not recover.”
The owl hooted softly again and flew over to the chair. It nudged his hand, as if to say -
Harry grinned and brought Draco off with firm strokes, while they kept kissing lazily. Quicker than Harry really wanted Draco shuddered through his orgasm and reached for Harry's prick that had taken an interest in the activities. But it felt wrong to do it out there in the open and Harry stilled Draco's hand. Before Draco could interpret this as rejection Harry hurried to explain.
Washing up and getting dressed for the day was a quick affair. Stepping out onto the terrace he enjoyed a cup of coffee and pain au chocolate. He was just glad that all that hiking and swimming he kept doing gave him ample muscle to burn of these occasional indulgences. Finishing his breakfast, he asked about the best way towards the
For Draco to simply refuse to yield, something must bother him about the cold, and was it  bad that he refused to be outside?
“Ok, guys that was very good.”
"Courtship?" Harry was flabbergasted.
"Mr Malfoy," His voice sounds cool, collected and I see him in front of me. I feel warmth at the thought that he has followed a summons of my father, to talk about our friendship.
When Draco took it, he felt a subtle strength vibrating through his arm.
Draco paused.
“Are you coming?” he calls over his shoulder.
Music does not make it better Harry stumbles over his feet, feels clumsy and uncoordinated, and letting Malfoy lead is just not in his nature. But somehow he gets through the first class.
"But is she alright?" I am so relieved that Mother searched for me and Harry's next words warm me from within.
"Master Harry is to be looking into this!" Tibby levitated a heavy tome onto the cluttered desk. "Master be looking for the solution long enough now! Master is making himself sick!"
"No!" Harry covered his hand, with his own. "Usually people, want me to explain first, why I haven't become an Auror. I should have remembered that you know how we felt after the battle. But truth is, I wanted for things to have a second chance. Especially after learning that not all wizards are buried with their wands. So I talked to Mr Ollivander about the old trade, and began to learn. I gave your wand back and then I travelled for a bit to learn more about the other wandcores and woods used in wandmaking. Then it was time to come back, and open shop. Well, and that is what I have been doing for the last year."
“I am sorry, too. I should have known that Harry talks to you about this.” Draco shrugs. “I am fond of him, very much so. And yes, I am very attracted to him, but that is all that you need to know about us.” He smiles at her when he says it, and receives a cautious smile in return. They sit quietly until Harry snaps out of it again and Hermione refrains from prodding again.
"'ello Draco, cher. How are you feeling?" She stroked his forehead gently. "You worried us, quite a bit."
Draco closed his eyes and thought back to the day when he picked his first wand at Ollivanders. Mother had looked at him with something akin to sadness, but only much later the wisdom lying in the old man's words had become clear.
"I love Teddy, but I haven't had the best role models, if you recall."
"Just like you love your crups." It is an easy and safe topic I think, easy and safe is good with us.
Then our lips finally touch.
“This was truly supposed to be a prank!?” Draco reacted with disbelief. As if he couldn’t understand fully what he was hearing. Given that Potter didn’t look smug or happy about getting one over him, instead of miserable and contrite. His eyes softened a bit as if he could almost believe that Harry hadn’t done it on purpose.
"But can't they be used in a sensible way?" Harry asked.
"I am not sure that I can do that." Harry turned his face away.
"Your poor hands, you will have scars." She was still sobbing.
It feels a bit uncomfortable at the first penetration, but the burning sensation gives way to pleasure quickly.
“I have no idea how to handle babies!”
As they settle in front of the fire, Draco can’t contain the question any longer.
“I have no idea.” Harry sounds exhausted. “Her heart rate was all over the place and her blood pressure was sky high. I hope they tell us tomorrow. They might not like it but you are next of kin and they have to let you know what is going on. For now I suggest we both stay here and keep things as normal for Teddy as they can be.”
She looks at him and her nose is slightly upturned, but her mouth quivers and he sees how much it must have cost her to come to him.
Oh he knows that he looks good, he dressed to impress after all. The grey silk of his shirt clinging to his torso and the black jeans tight as if painted onto his long legs, but tonight he doesn’t care about the looks he is garnering from all of these men. Tonight only one man counts.
"He doesn't see me."
Draco laughs a little startled sound that Harry cherishes.
“No she always puts too much milk in it.” Harry indicates his cup. “But this is perfect. Thank you.”
Harry just looks at him, and Draco's smile reminds him of a snake.
“Hm - so lets come up with a plan to make Harry talk to me.”
He thought he would come home - instead he stepped back into his own personal nightmare.
It didn't take long, until Harry came back. He put the glass down in front of Draco before he slid into the booth across from him.
"Why didn't you visit him then?" Now I am truly curious.
----------
"Yes, Sir." Harry was already engrossed in the case file.
"If you keep this up, I will fuck you right here..." I am harder than I have ever been, and holding back takes more self-control than I think I possess.
"Well, then the first try is completed. I am not making the promise that everything will be alright by then." Harry answered the smile with one of his own.
"Oh please. As if Draco Malfoy has ever NOT seen you." Ron rolled his eyes, biting into his breakfast muffin.
“Ok.” Draco takes a deep breath. “I left, because I needed to find out who I was without my past. It sounds selfish and it was, because well, this is me we are talking about, selfish to the bone.”
“Yes, touch me.” Draco arches towards Harry, yearning for the warm touch which ignites a fire underneath his skin.
Draco keeps researching, but hasn’t found out yet what he has been given. He wonders if he’ll ever figure it out, because it gets harder and harder to ignore the potion and the lust it ignites in his body every time he is close to Harry.
“I is sorry, but Master Harry Potter is outside the wards. He was here yesterday too.”
-----------------------
A shutter seemed to go down behind Draco's eyes and Harry remembered that Lucius Malfoy had been sentenced to life in Azkaban shortly after the battle. Draco would never see his father again. His mother had succumbed to a wasting curse that had been cast on her while she was shopping in Diagon Alley. Harry had not realised that Draco had left England probably at the same time that he himself had gone, and was curious.
“So where are we heading first?” Harry grins like a little boy. To have that grin directed at himself does funny things to Draco’s insides. He pushes the thoughts aside quite firmly and directs Harry to Flourish and Blotts first. After all they too have some shopping to do.
"Have you lost it now completely?, Draco you cannot mean to bind yourself to me, just to get one over the Wizengamot!"
Potter laughs "Lucy is the dogs name by the way. So no it is not a burden for me not to meet her. Her owner gave me literature to read through. I know that with keeping my crups, I cannot walk freely in the Muggle world. Even though Dot and Patsy are not aggressive towards Muggles as far as my experiments have show, they are very rambunctious around them, and the Muggle equivalent to crups is quite annoying." Potter rambles on while absent-mindedly stroking Tora's fur.
"Uhm, you know, you are not the only one who has been trying to gather his courage." Harry feels his cheeks burn. "But I thought you would not want someone so inexperienced."
“Please I want you!”
"Ok, tea and Firewhisky..." He will need it when both of them show up like this.
"What do you mean?" Harry bristled.
“Easy there.” He lowers Harry onto the floor and lets go as much as he can, although Harry all but curls into him and holds on for dear life. It is as if he is somewhere else entirely. Draco keeps making soothing noises and strokes Harry’s back as if he is trying to soothe an injured animal.
must have washed the dirt from his face, but maybe something is still stuck.
His grimace must have been too obvious, when Zabini grabs his beer and takes a sip.
He dries himself and dresses quickly. The soft grey jumper goes with the black trousers. That Mipsy brought these clothes shows that she checked the weather forecast. The weather is overcast and he picks the heavy cloak up that goes well with his dragonhide boots. He really needs to reward Mipsy for being so thoughtful.
“So we brought all of them to the Room of Requirement, and then came to you,” Draco picked up.
He is unconscious when he hits the ground. Nobody is around to see the flash that turns the crumpled form of a man into a much smaller form, huddled in the thick folds of the bloodied uniform.
“Welcome students! I am Professor Hamish and I will be teaching you ballroom dancing. The Headmistress has asked me to utilize the Sorting Hat in order to assign you a partner for the duration of this course.”
“Because on the small chance that you do, let me tell you, that there has never been anybody who has infuriated me more than you, that all of my attempts at relationships have been with men who are tall, blond and snarky, but that not one of them has really captured me, because they did not know me as you did. I missed you the moment you left, but I get why you had to. Do me a favour and read the letters. Once you are done, answer my initial question.”
"Mother, we would like to visit the Hawthorne trees. Harry has another idea for my wand issues."
As he sinks back onto the silk sheets on my bed, my breath catches - he looks beautiful. There is no other way to describe it.
when I was in fourth year. Love spells fall under compulsion spells. They don’t work on me. So even if the artefact would have tried to give me to you, as you put it, it would not have worked. Instead there is a very easy reason that made me stay with you.”
Which is why she stood in front of the small cottage that Harry inhabited. The downpour was even harder here. Harry didn't open the door, but Ginny didn't let that deter her.
“How much further?” He asked to distract himself from the maudlin thoughts
"Hi, Bill, how’s the family?"
So of course he was engrossed in his work, touching up the last of the new polish for a delivery of wands when the doorbell rang.
Teddy is awake now and gurgles happily at seeing all of the lights and garlands strung up. Draco feels a bit hungry but is reluctant to address the issue, until his stomach protests quite noisily.
The cups of tea and candy canes keep showing up for a while, always with a sweet note and Draco begins to relax more and more. Later he will blame the long lack of human interaction for his inability to connect the dots earlier, but when Harry Potter begins to stop by at his desk, first with only a friendly nod and then a friendly word, he doesn’t think anything of it.
Harry’s face loses all colour when he realises just whom he is threatening with his wand. Shock hits Harry hard, and he looses his footing. His broom clatters to the floor. Draco lets go of his own broom and catches the crumpling figure. Having an armful of Harry and inhaling his scent wreaks havoc on his senses, and he decides now and there to refrain from touching Harry too much, for as long as he can. The man is intoxicating to him and he berates himself for playing into the potions intent so easily.
Sleep evades him for much longer that night, and he swears to himself that he won’t return.
So he promises to be back in two days.
As she sweeps out of the room, what hurts me most is that I see tears in her eyes.
“No, he has disappeared for the time being.” Pansy shrugs.
"Don't worry, you are safe with me."
But for the last year of his schooling it had been, that if it wasn't Ron it was Draco Malfoy. But at least with Ron, Harry didn't feel as if the ground should now please open up and swallow him whole.
------------------------
“That is the Black Family Crest, isn’t it?” Blaise raises his eyebrow. Of course Draco has recognised the painted symbol but the books have told him nothing  about this specific piece. The only magical property seems to be that once he opens the box the symbol pulses softly, as if a beating heart is in the box. It has creeped him out at first, but by now he has gotten used to the gentle pulsing.
Blaise has left England to travel with his mother and Theo has been confined in the Manor of his family. Somehow the Malfoy name even though he has been exonerated doesn't carry much prestige with it any longer.
“I could look at you all day. Do you have any idea for how long I wanted to have you like this?”
Harry grasps his hand, and Draco can’t bring himself to pull away. Instead he tries to provide stability, even though he himself feels shaken. Teddy reaches out for him as well and he holds the little boy close. He is just glad that the baby doesn’t understand what they are talking about.
"I don't think that he is angry at you, Mrs Malfoy." I turn back to her. "Why do you think that?"
Draco looked anywhere but at their joined hands.
“How long was I out?” He feels disoriented, and struggles into a sitting position. Clucking her tongue the witch gently levitates a pillow into his back.
Looking at his lonely robes, left hanging on a few pegs he sits heavily on the bed, but it is only when he sees the remnants of the pictures of them as a couple burned in the fireplace that he allows himself to cry.
“I am currently taking the correspondence course for my NEWTs, and then I definitely want to work in potions development. Although I admit I have no idea if I want to go more into the direction of healing or magical restoration. I want to make things better and beautiful again and both avenues offer me this.”
“Were you serious?” Draco swallows around the lump that seems to have taken residence in his throat, and he feels terribly insecure. As much as he revels in the attraction that he feels for this young man in the chair by the fire, he thinks that feeling this wrong footed is a rather unfortunate side effect of feeling again.
He leaned forward for a kiss and found himself pulled flush against Harry's chest. It was only after several minutes of heated snogging that Harry let him go and gave him a rueful smile.
"No, my father would not allow it. It wasn't dignified enough, you know just like being gay."
“You expect us to work through seven years in a week?” Draco looked straight at the headmistress.
When Harry leaves the atelier, Draco cannot contain his exited whoop of joy. He has not felt this elated and happy in a long time.
“Ok, all set. You can give him to me now.” Andromeda steps up to him. “Unless you want to change his nappy?” She grins deviously and he feels all colour leave his face.
She might have overreacted a bit,
“You know Potter, I know you are not a fan, but if you don’t get this one thing into your skull we will never manage to dance with each other, no matter trying to find a song that we can dance to at the graduation.”
"She was asleep when I left. But of course you can visit her." Proudfoot nods at me, not unkindly. "There was nothing unusual today?"
Things come to a head on a night when Draco lets his guard down too much.
“Are you hungry?” Harry turns towards him with concern and when he is just about to say that it is not that bad, his stomach emits another growl. He blushes at that, but Harry just grins.
Later that night, I sit in my room and I think back to the night, that might have triggered this entire mess. Once I have the memory secure I pull it out, and pour it into my private pensive.
The words pour from my mouth and I can't control my own mind. "If we do this there is no turning back, there is no divorce - Harry this literally is till death do us part! Are you sure?" I need him to understand. "We can wait until I am thirty, and then we can..." He silences me, with a finger to my lips.
“Oh, I thought Andy makes it just like I do.”
His startled laughter is a welcome distraction, his talk about needing a reason to get up, has hit a little too close to home to be comfortable.
“Dancing - that means to fall in love for the duration of a song, it means giving in and trusting your partner to guide you.”
Life has gotten better during the last few months. Draco does not withdraw as much when I visit, and still I feel that something is not quite right yet. I am the first to admit that.
"Hey Tora." She twines around my legs, and distracts me from my near meltdown.
As always when he considers the two steadfast friends, his mind strays towards the third part of their former trio, and he wonders for a moment where Draco might be now. He has been gone for so long, and Harry wonders if he should reach out once more. But before he can finalize the thought, he gets drawn back into the conversation.
The Chief Warlock is not pleased but he can do nothing but proceed.
"Yes, even then I knew that I trusted you with my life. When you came to me with the wand so weak, I wanted to make it right for you again. But I think I made a mistake. That day when you picked the wand back up from me, the cut that you saw? My glove wasn't sealed anymore and blood mixed with my sweat had gotten onto your wand. I sealed my subconscious promise to always be there for you, to protect you with my blood. When you left, the wand thought you didn't want me in your life. And so it malfunctioned to bring us back together until you realise that I am the perfect choice for you. My wand is made of Holly, look what they write about that here."
Harry is naked now as well, and when did he lose his own pants? Draco looks at the other man's erection and wonders how on earth that will ever fit inside of him. Potter must be at least eight inches in length and he is pretty thick, he reaches out to circle his cock with his fingers and even though he can close them, he feels the heaviness and a frisson of fear shoots through him. He strokes Harry for a bit, before he finds himself back on his back and Harry hovering over him. The smile he bestows on him, tells Draco that his fear has not gone unnoticed. He strokes his flanks and cups his cock tenderly.
"Harry, I dropped the glass I am so sorry!" He carefully placed it on the kitchen table.
When he steps into the common room, something is different though.
We have to do what?” Harry feels himself freeze.
They are both working on the correspondence course. Harry is taking it a bit slower, but there is no rush for either of them. Draco is grateful for the knowledge that he can repeat the tests should he fail them, and Harry has already decided to use the second slot. At least he has told Draco this much. It means he won’t take the NEWTs before January next year. More important, this way he buys himself time to decide what he really wants to do in life.
"Lucien!" she hollered again.
“Hm, well, too bad then.” He straightens and lets the hood fall back that he had pulled over his distinctive hair. “And you had so recommended the taste of their quiches.” Draco sees the eyes of the server widen as she realises who has entered with him.
“Only fashionably so.” There is a roughness in his voice that betrays only a hint of annoyance, and Draco feels an answering shiver of his own.
Exhausted but happy he fell into bed.
So he trudged back to bed, clutching the stuffed fox that Grandma had given him for his 5th birthday,  never forgetting that Harry had promised to play with him outside later.
But Harry is having none of it; he is pacing in front of the desk, much like a caged lion, raging against her.
"No, Mistress only said she wanted to go to Twilfit and Tattings." Lindy wrings her hands and I dismiss her, there is no need to worry the elves more than needed.
Walking over the cold stone floor she tears at her red hair.
And nobody sees when the tired young man who lives behind the dark curtains, comes home and stumbles upon the bundle upon his doorstep, with its precious content.
“Fancy going for a flight tomorrow?” Harry grins from ear to ear, and he agrees without thinking too hard about it.
Harry laughs softly. “How would you know?”
When he enters the parlour, he takes a proper look at his mum. She looks tired, washed out even, and his heart aches even more. He should have taken better care of her, instead he has left her to her own devices hiding within the Manor.
Harry settles at the table, and they eat together, talking comfortably, as if not five years had passed.
“I don’t mind you spending time with Teddy. Hell, if I had a problem with you being out and about, do you think I would have tried so hard to get you spared from Azkaban? Yes, you have been a right twat in school—but I haven’t exactly been trying to understand you either.” He scratches his head, mussing the black hair. “I know that we have had a bad history, but I don’t want you to flee when I am in Andromeda's house. I know that you are really good with Teddy and I would like to get to know that side of you.”
Draco didn't get a chance to say how sorry he was for the scars that marred the handsome face. All he could do was gape at the man, no matter how undignified a behaviour it was.
And Harry drops by every other day. They have established an easy rapport.
"It used to be, yes." His throat felt tight, and the dust in the store made his eyes itch, because surely there was no other explanation for the burning sensation behind his eyelids.
“Because we are all taking a class on dancing?”
Teddy stretched his arms out towards Draco, clearly pleading to be taken by him, as soon as he heard Draco’s voice. Andy had handed the baby over and there he stood, with a hiccuping child pressed to his chest.
“Because the blond scumbag we only tolerated for Harry’s sake has gone and broke our favourite Gryffindorks heart!”
"The salon. I am just going to disarm the wards on the library doors, these are pretty straight forward." Bill sounded far away and Draco's vision tunnelled.
“Usually the deep love between partners is a component, yes. But you have always been an exception to the rule. My best guess is that you desperately wanted to have a family of your own. You wanted a child to love, and that love was enough to create the pregnancy but not enough to sustain it. Somewhere deep inside of yourself you still believe that only someone of your own blood could love you unconditionally.” Draco smiles sadly. “Family is such a huge word. It means loving and accepting someone even when you disagree, and it so much beyond friendship. It means a bond that can’t be broken unless by death. But at the same time it has NOTHING, absolutely nothing, to do with being blood relation.”
potion, please? He has overexerted himself. Stubborn man." But his fingers gently combed the wayward pony-strands back.
* Moving forward *
"Draco, dinner will be ready soon." Harry called from the kitchen.
“Headmistress.” He nods towards the woman behind the desk.
They continue to chat long into the afternoon. But when she leaves he hears the silence even louder than before.
"You mean the weekend that we spend with your friends, where I felt under interrogation from Granger for the entire time?" Draco sounded tired and Harry realised that this was more serious than he believed it to be.
"Of course. Thank you for lending it to me. I have to admit it worked better than I thought. Of course not as well as my original, but fairly well." Then Draco handed the other wand back, and tried to pay Harry for his efforts. Only to have Harry wave it off.
"How does it feel when you cast in my vicinity?"
He stares at her, wondering when he got so transparent.
Draco scrubbed his face with his hand, unconsciously messing up his hair.
"Bonjour!" The old lady waved him towards one of the tables, looking at him with a keen eye. "Vous etes anglais ou allemand?"
The owl seemed to nod at that and come to a decision. It let go of the package it had held clutched in its talons, and flew to the perch. It hooted softly, as if wanting to encourage him. So he took a step closer, and saw that his name was scrawled on the package in untidy chicken scratch. Curiosity warred inside of him with self-preservation. In the end he took his uncooperative wand, and forced it to perform a basic curse detection spell. Sweat broke out on his brow but the package glowed a reassuring green, indicating that it was clean of curses.
"Well you look more than decent, to be honest, you actually look nice, but don't let it get to your head." He mumbles.
to work with him. He felt utterly ashamed at the thought. Just as he was prepared to give up, he found one, which at least performed the basic spells he would need.
The Golden Goose has come to be my respite when things at home take a turn for the unbearable. I am embarrassed to say that I find myself at the bar at least once a week, trying to gather my thoughts and to fortify myself against the palpable disappointment that I will encounter when I get home. Even though I have tried to find a way of keeping the peace at my home, after five years my father still has not gotten the message that things are no longer always following his plans.
He sees that she wants to argue with him, but decides to let it rest for the moment.
Maybe one day he will.
"Just for that I have to punish you!" and just like that Harry found himself being tickled without mercy until he begged for leniency.
“Thank you, I can return that compliment,” Harry replies easily. Teddy is bouncing on his hip and Draco feels a wave of longing rise. Ruthlessly he squashes it down and squares his shoulders.
When I catch my breath, I look down at him, into his green eyes and nothing is more adequate than the simple truth. "I love you too, Harry."
"Where are you,Bill?" he called out for his partner. His instincts told him that trying to do anything alone in here was a suicide mission.
Harry lets his head fall back onto the sofa, and stares at the ceiling for a long time. Draco has to subtly reheat his tea and when Harry takes a sip, the pleased smile on his face again does strange things to his stomach.
“Good afternoon, Pansy!” He strolls into the salon and takes a look at his childhood friend.
"I know this is important to you, and I want you to succeed. So tell me when to be here, and I will be here."
"But why, Mr Potter?" Father sound genuinely puzzled. "Don't you think that he should have talked to you about the bond when he found out? And do you really believe me a monster? What I have done was only for the greater good of our family, you surely know after five years of friendship with my son that it is not unheard of to arrange marriages?"
Bill's eyebrows rose when he turned around the corner, and Draco thought grimly that he must make quite a sight, flushed and dishevelled. Before he could greet the unexpected guest however, Bill had raised his hand.
“Have you even listened to the lyrics?” There was a fond exasperation in Draco’s voice... "Maybe, you could stop risking your neck quite as much? Cause as I said I 'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts or hero. But if you are just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss. Then you are just perfect for me."
"Two years, three months and four days." Harry grins at him. "You showed up with Andy and Teddy and he begged me not to hex your arse."
“That is hardly a testimony of good character,” Draco objects. “Look Pansy, I know you mean well, but I have to face the truth. For most of the people that count I have not made a good impression. I am okay with working in the Manor, but going out is not high on my agenda.”
“That is rich, coming from you”, Harry bites out.
“I have no idea, maybe he just doesn’t like being wet.”
"I won't lie, this doesn't look good. But I can try a few things." Harry looked at the man seated on his armchair. "Can you leave the wand with me for a couple days? We can try to find a suitable spare wand for you in the meantime. At least then you won't be wandless."
"Yes." And then Fleur began to cry.
But before he can ask what that means he is fast asleep.
"It feels content, calm. Depending on the additional core you added, a little different."
"I am looking forward to it."
“Oh.” Harry feels warmth at the admission that he obviously had such an impact on the other man.
He moves them into the bedroom, but when he settles the basket onto the floor, he is not amused. Surely Draco cannot mean for him to sleep on the floor? He begins to meow, hoping that Draco has not yet fallen asleep. Apparently, luck is on his side, and Draco peers down at him from the bed. "What? Can't you sleep in your basket? Do you want to get in bed with me again?" If cats could smile he probably would, but so he settles for a pleading "Meow" instead. When Draco gives in and cuddles him close to his chest again, he cannot help but purr contentedly.
“Perfect. If someone would have told me five years ago, that the only person who gets my tea just right is Draco Malfoy, I think I would have gotten them admitted.”
“Harry is pretty messed up,” Hermione states just as flatly.
“Good you are awake.” The woman bustling into the room, has a friendly smile on her face.
"No" it is such a simple word, but it is the hardest I have ever spoken.
"Hey, Phoenix. You seem to be all healed again," I crouch down and scratch him, as he loves. "Are you going to leave me now?" and there it is, Phoenix shakes his head, in a very decisive manner.
So to judge Draco for complicity in a murder that wasn't one, would not be just. And then he continues to talk about Draco's home life, about the love that he has witnessed from Narcissa Malfoy for his school rival and the desperate measures Draco has taken to make sure his mother got through the war unscathed. And he talks about the fact that Draco still protected him to the best of his abilities by refusing to identify him and giving him a chance to get away.
"Can we get coffee and talk? But I have to warn you, I slept horribly without you, so I might fall asleep on you."
"So did you? Break Ginevra's heart that is?" Draco couldn't contain his curiosity.
"You will not win, Bellatrix. You hear me?!" he poured his pain, fear and anger into the room.
Watching Draco eat a lychee was positively lewd. His plump lips closed around the white flesh of the fruit and he sucked it into his mouth, when he was sure that he had Harry's full attention.
“You should smile more often. It suits you.”
"Draco." Must his voice sound so terribly understanding? I hide my face in Patsy's fur and to my amazement she remains where she is, paws over my shoulder and her little face tucked firmly against my neck. I feel her huffs of breath and they anchor me. So much like Tora.
The whispers sound excited, as his eyes rove over the dusty surfaces. The nursery doesn’t contain much, which makes it impossible to say which Malfoy slept here as a baby. The old fashioned furniture tells him that at least a century must have passed since the room was in use. The whispers don’t indicate what he is looking for and he can’t figure it out. Standing in that room for what feels like hours and still no clue, he picks toys up, lonely rattles and knickknacks, but the whispers don’t stop.
"And now what?" I hate the helplessness creeping up on me.
For a second I wonder if we are not doing this too fast, but then again, we have waited for five years.
When he says he is mine he forgets that I belong to him just as much, have always belonged to him, and I am not afraid to always be his any longer. If father has a problem with this, I can do something about it later, but right now I have more pressing matters to attend to.
"Me getting a hard-on, after your teasing?" Harry sounds sarcastically. "Not quite how we functioned before, Draco."
The oily blackness branded against the shield only seconds later, made him want to retch, but he held his wand steady. With luck the curse would take only his hand, with bad luck he would lose his arm. Then he could only hope that the paralysing factor wore off fast enough, that Bill could keep him from bleeding out. Bill's eyes were wild, but he didn't have time to think about the implications.
"Yes." Draco didn't quite smile but some of the tension around his eyes bled out. "You have quite a good memory."
His mother coughs delicately pulling him out of his thoughts. Getting caught in his own head is something he is becoming familiar with. Life in the cell was not that different than his life in the Manor now.
"Are you very mad at me?" I know what he said to my father, but I want him to be honest with me. I can take his anger, I want to explain my egoism but he surprises me again.
I pull Harry close and the way he melts against my side, makes me strong enough to do what I should have done long ago.
“Send him away.” Draco feels old, much older than his 18 years. Mipsy pops away to do his bidding—but Harry would not be Harry if he just took no for an answer.
Draco snorts, “It is more a question of you being alright with me always being there.”
“If you want nothing to do with him, that is perfectly alright, leaving a pregnant man is a punishable offence in the magical world. He has no right to this child any longer.”
“I don’t feel a lot, but I know that you care deeply for me, and that makes me want to get better, because I have come to care for you as well. I don’t feel physical attraction right now. It's as if my libido has decided to take a holiday in Iceland.” Draco tries a feeble joke and turns towards Harry's chest as he continues to speak. “But I want to feel that passion again, I want to want you again. Not even my mother made me want to get better, so there is something special about this thing between us. I can’t promise you that it will be fast, but I will try. I don’t want to jump your bones, but you make me feel warm again when there was only cold and numbness before.”
"So you blocked the curses and saved Bill's life." Harry felt sick at Draco's casual dismissal of his sacrifice, he knew the curses and their only counters. It was a wonder that Draco still appeared to be whole.
The next day found Harry waking early. He thought back to the previous evening and caught himself smiling. They had talked for ages, and even though Draco had to work a shift later, he had promised to take Harry to the botanical garden. Or as he had said
“Diagon is always quiet around this time of year. You have been here when school supplies are needed. That is a pretty busy time. But not only is today a workday, we are here after the rush of people wanting to get to work and before the lunch crowd is due. And of course the time when the Biggest Wanker Of All Times was at large cannot be counted!” Draco doesn’t say that he had hoped to attract the least amount of attention this way, but the soft smile that plays upon Harry’s lips shows that his thoughts might have been figured out.
“What is it that you need?”
"Luna." I am surprised to see her muster me with worry.
“Shame, you are a beautiful man, and I really would like to see all of you.” Draco was serious now, and Harry couldn't help himself, he turned towards him and kissed his lips. Soon their snogging became intense and Harry felt the evidence of Draco's arousal pressed up against his leg. He reached out and wrapped his hand around the shaft.
"So, what has driven you to drink today then?"
“Then what's going on?” Harry removes his arms from him, but still stays close to him.
"Oh, Draco." Picking the other man up and gently Apparating with him to Grimmauld Place in a matter of seconds.
“Is this ok?” He asked belatedly and Draco barked a laugh.
Harry felt the air leave his body. "Is he alright?" Something must have shown on his face because Bill frowned a little.
“Thank you, gentlemen, please have a seat.” The Healer who goes by the name of Montrose, smiles at them reassuringly. “Let me tell you first that we expect for Mrs Tonks to make a full recovery.”
Selling second hand wands has always made him happy. But the happy glow on Draco's face as he used his repaired wand to
"Mother." My voice sounds strange, choked in my own ears and I breathe her soft perfume in.
"That speech was quite something, but you could have just kissed me?" Draco quips and wraps his arms around Harry.
“This is more than ok. If you don't move your hand soon I will have to hex you into next week!”
“Why would you think I consent to enduring this again?” He bites out “Wasn’t it enough to humiliate me in fourth grade?”
She waves them out of the room and Draco allows Harry to pull him outside by the hand. It feels warm and right.
“But I'm not depressed!” Harry protested.
Suddenly it dawns on him that his aunt is as nervous about his visit as he himself feels.
I could lose myself in this kiss. I have known that I am in love with him for so long, but to feel his mouth beneath mine, to really taste him, and to know that he has just given himself to me for the rest of our lives, is intoxicating.
"Well it has been quite some time since a handsome man has asked me out. So I accept." Draco grinned and settled at the bar.
“If this is a joke it is not a very good one. Men cannot get pregnant as far as I am aware. We lack the equipment!”
Draco snuggles into Harry's shoulder, and the arm that wraps tighter around him anchors him and warms him deeply.
Walking through the flat he notes the little things missing a picture here, a trinket there, and each little token carves him more to pieces. The closet has been emptied of most of its content and he feels a small smile tug at his lips. He always knew that Philippe had tried to take over his life, and he had started with the damn closet.
A whole month has passed before he manages to come back to the familiar cafe. He wanted to come back much sooner than he has. But between being counted as missing for months and his friends insisting on checking on his health. More time has passed than he had anticipated. He has missed Draco more than he could believe possible at first, but sleeping alone still is a struggle.
“Will you stay now?” Harry takes a deep breath. “I know it is unfair to ask you, and I don’t want you to feel pressured, but we all missed you so much, and you can’t possibly still think that you are not worthy of being in our lives!”
“Do you think they know that it is obvious what they feel?”
“Pansy...” He tries to smile but he feels so so tired. She looks at him, worry evident on her face.
“Morning Malfoy.”
“Morning Potter,” Parkinson calls out hesitantly.
“Are you happy now?” Harry’s voice is calm, accepting and loving.
"Oui." Harry grinned back. He loved the interactions at the airport. People all over the world were friendly. He loved the initial burst of hope that this would finally be the place where he would feel warm. Even after three years of travel he hadn't found a place that warmed his heart permanently.
Draco was quiet for a while. “It was the one where I came out to you. I was so happy about my first relationship and you started to withdraw after that. I didn’t know what to make of it.”
"Yes Tora. She is cute."
"He threatened you?" Harry is in full Auror mode now "And you didn't trust the Aurors to protect you."
“I'm not certain there is anything you can do but sure, why not.” Draco is tired of trying to figure this out by himself.
Harry had only just finished his ablutions and gotten dressed in fresh clothes heading towards the reception area, when he already saw the familiar blond head reclined in a chair waiting for him.
“Why, because everyone thinks I’ll end up with my childhood sweetheart, pop out three kids and name them after dead people?” Harry snorts. “I think I’ll disappoint them quite a bit then. Now sit down and eat. We do need to head to the hospital soon.”
With the current guests in Malfoy Manor, it would not do to give a reason for questioning.
"No of course not. But we need to talk this through in more detail. Come have dinner with me tonight, and then we can talk about our options?" Harry suggested softly.
“Sit down.” Harry points towards the chair across from him, and his body follows before his mind has caught up with the request. The green eyes focus on his face and Harry must see something that propels him to speak.
“I said, I want to become a Healer. I want to make things whole again. I know that now.” Harry stares at him with these impossible green eyes. “I want to work with you, on healing people.”
“Forgive me when I say that nothing bad is a funny way of putting it.” Draco looked furious for the first time. “This imbecile made it snow in the dungeons! It just wouldn’t stop! Do you think it was fun to try and soothe the frightened first years? They were cold and crying! I just wanted him to feel a bit blown around since he thinks it’s so hilarious.”
The next morning found Harry rising in the wee hours. The sun was just peaking up, but Draco had informed him that the hike that he wanted to undertake would take the entire day if he didn't want to rush.
“True enough.” Harry focused on the assortment of open containers that Draco placed on the table between them. The dishes smelled amazing,but he had no idea what most of them contained. As he picked up a small pastry he quipped “Will you explain what I am eating here?"
"I owe you a picnic." Draco didn't want to forgive Potter immediately, not when he had made his life so miserable for the last couple months. First by being an inconsiderate arse and then by leaving a Harry shaped hole in his heart that nobody could quite fill. But now that he stood in front of the man, who ducked his head shyly, his resolve crumbled. It was not entirely clear to him, why, if it was the strain around Harry's eyes, the reluctance to look him into the eyes, as if afraid of possible rejection, or the fact that Harry looked wrecked from months without him. Part of his heart that he tried to harden against selfish saviours, melted. Simple as that. He felt as if that specific hole had been filled and he breathed easier for the first time, since the day he walked out on Harry Potter.
“Are you really?” Harry asks quietly.
The pillow asked him. Something was not right. He began to recognise his surroundings and opened his eyes fully. He was at Grimmauld Place and Harry was his pillow. How had that happened? He didn't remember making up with Harry. He had wanted, to when he had gone to the shop. Had he succeeded then?
“I haven’t been able to get it to play anything. Trust me this was my last resort. I didn’t want to dose him with a Calming Draught, or let him cry himself to sleep. You have been the person to put him to bed for the last few days. It seems he has gotten used to you.”
“But Harry,” Ron sputters. “He must have you under a spell or something!”
"Yeah we are passing the
"Yeah well, it was not that easy. I wanted for you to succeed, but I hoped you would not forget me."
His roommates are already up and move through the shared room, conversation filters through the hangings of the four poster bed. Only the thought of the unlikely case of someone checking in on him and questioning why he has not moved at all makes it possible to move his tired body out of bed and walk into the bathroom. He takes a shower, because he remembers that he used to care a lot about his appearance and doesn’t want others to grow too suspicious about his changed looks. It is bad enough that he doesn’t put much effort into his hair any longer. It grows, it gets washed and dried. He cuts it regularly, because he doesn’t want to resemble his father too much, but that is it.
There are still tears on her cheeks, but the gentle smile on her face lights the room.
One might say that this too was a new development, but Harry was more honest with himself. He had always wanted Draco's attention. Even though back then in sixth grade he hadn't known just why he longed for Draco's eyes on him. But now he wanted to ask all of these questions that he had suppressed for the last two years. Most of all he wanted to know if Draco still had that boyfriend, but words failed him.
"The mind is only strong for so long." Luna looks at me, knowingly. "Your Mum is a wonderful woman, but I would bet that she has tried to keep all of her worries to herself. And today it was just too much, and her mind screamed for help."
Harry settled down and stared over the expanse of the caldera.
Draco browses a little before settling on a book for Teddy. If his own eyes linger on Potions in magical restoration, and healing, Harry doesn’t comment on it.
Harry flinched, Draco would probably allow Teddy on the sofa, but for himself he did not hold high hopes. “We have to ask him, Teddy.”
"Thank you." Draco releases a breath he had not know he was holding. "If you can be here around 7 tomorrow evening? I need to order the fabric, but we need to measure you and I can start with the pattern."
So she had already decided what he was going to eat, it seemed. Harry was used to the friendliness of people in warmer climates and felt warmth at her antics.
Harry stares at the former Slytherin as she walks up and takes the Hat from Professor Hamish. Her face is white and pinched as she seems to listen closely to the hat, she shakes her head several times but nothing is said out loud. As she takes it of, Professor Hamish pick the hat and listens closely to his Words.
“Well, yes, we are both pretty messed up, but with you I want to work at getting better. You ground me and you make me want to be ok. And I very much want you in this baby’s life and mine.”
“I knew I was attracted to you in school, but I didn’t want to act on it. I knew I would face rejection. But when I came here and faced the ugly truth about myself, I also realised that you would always be my biggest
For now they still sleep in their cots, blissfully unaware.
“And how would you know that? Is he starting with the Aurors then?” Draco finds himself asking. What does he care what Potter does in his future? He expects that he will never see the other boy again, for what are they but two boys trying to make a life in a world that has been torn apart by war.
“Well, the scarred part is true.” Draco admits. He hasn’t felt miserable and alone ever since Andy has all but forced him to move in and Harry had become decent company as well.
"Yes."
He feels his body again for the first time in weeks. It is strange to be so large in Draco's flat, and he realizes with a start that he will have to leave soon. If not to say he should leave immediately, but he cannot leave like this, can't leave Draco like this. Not now, when he has found him and has realized that he is the part that fixes the hole that has been in his life.
Suddenly he feels unendingly tired and slumps onto the stool he has set into the middle of the room. Just for a second, he wants to breathe and think that this was not entirely crazy.
"It looks good Dray. No infections to see."
Andromeda is still weak and the potions take a heavy toll on her system. Secretly Draco is terrified that she will not make it, but he doesn’t dare speak it out loud. But Harry looks drawn and tired and so he faces the Erumpent in the room.
“Draco.” It is more of a whisper than a greeting and his voice is horribly rough as if his throat was lined with sandpaper.
"Okay, I am Harry, as you know." Harry smiled softly, but there is an underlying edge that told Draco that the following words were not going to be to his liking.
"Yes, I am glad to say that Draco and I have become more than good friends." Harry replied easily.
“Is everything alright?” Her voice is gentle, and he squeezes his eyes shut.
Draco stares at the result and cast again to make sure that he has not miscast. But the result remains the same.
"I am afraid Mr Malfoy, you need to be clearer. I enjoy the friendship with your son immensely and am not aware of any, as you call it, inconvenience."
He has not meant to stay quite as long with Harry, Draco is no saint and being with him for an extended period of time makes it incredibly hard to refrain from touching. The potion still in his system keeps whispering in his head to take it further. Touching warm skin makes it even harder not to give in and just jump him. But tonight they just talked and talked for hours, before they realise that nobody was with them in the dorm. Harry touches Draco’s face gently almost reverently, before he can move away.
When Harry breaks away, due to oxygen issues, he still holds him tightly.
Before he could talk himself out of the madness that had taken him over, he turned and Apparated straight into Harry's workshop.
It feels like hours when in reality only a few minutes can have passed. Harry’s awakening is like that of a lion. He stretches luxuriously, and pulls Draco’s body close, as if he is prey to be indulged in. He peppers kisses onto his nape and nuzzles the warm skin. His hands roam over Draco’s skin still warm from sleep and he doesn’t know what to do. How to let Harry know that everything has changed. Harry does not immediately realise that Draco lies rigidly in his arms. But Draco notices when Harry becomes aware that something is wrong.
“So St Mungo’s?” He tries for brusque, but obviously doesn’t fool Harry. The man just nods, wraps his other arm around Draco and apparates them to the entrance of the hospital.
“So, care to tell me why you are reading through the entire section on heirlooms and cursed artefacts? My contacts in the Ministry are all abuzz about your reformation and the constant stream of artefacts that are being sent in for decontamination. Has the Black Madness finally gotten to you?”
"Breakfast is ready for Master Harry."
------------------
“Mistress Narcissa insists that you will be joining her.”
“Well, I would appreciate it if you stopped dawdling and just got this over with. I have no interest in being here, so just get on with it and choose which poor soul gets stuck with me.”
"You owe me a picnic?" his eyebrow was raised perfectly, and his voice sounded haughty enough to send others running for the hills. But Harry Potter had never been others, and a small hesitant smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. "Yeah, I owe you a picnic, one where you have me all to yourself, and where I am entirely at your beck and call."
"You will find a solution." He turned to Harry. "I trust you, but we are not touching these two trees."
"Fuck, I have been so stupid!" Harry turned to Bill. "He only lashes out like this..."
He could tell Harry, that, of course, he would be fine pinning the trial pieces to a dummy moulded after his body, after all that is what he will do in the future for his customers, but he wants to see him again and for once he indulges a little, he is not hurting anyone after all.
That settled what he would have for dinner. And if he was honest with himself he already missed the company of the other man.
“Well getting that out of his hair will be a challenge,” he states.
enough.
He is fiercely grateful for her presence though. But no one of his own age is around.
"Master Malfoy, Bill Weasley is waiting for you in the atrium."
“Yeah? You want to see me on my back?” Draco wants to sound assured, but the nervousness is taking over.
“Don’t hide,” he whispers into his ear. The warm breath touches his earlobe, making his stomach do funny things that have nothing to do with hunger.
"Shhh, don't fight me. I am trying to help you and your owner." He shook his head a little, "that must have been quite a magical clash."
He wandered over to the fireplace and settled in his favourite armchair. He knew it made no sense to ask her what she was on about. Sooner or later he would stumble across the issue again and maybe then she would make sense. As wonderful aromas started wafting through the house his thoughts strayed back to Draco's visit to his shop.
“Beer is ok. Are you sick?” These dark blue eyes look deep into his soul, lying is not even an option.
"Yes, 'cause they could get scared."
“Come on let’s go.” Harry gives him a kind smile, and steers him towards the entrance. They approach the welcome witch and she sends them to the ward of Magical Maladies.
“No, they withhold judgement for now. But you are giving them reason for confusion.”
Andy is probably outside with Teddy, because he can’t hear them in the house. He hums under his breath and brews his tea, but as he looks at the sink he sees two cups in it. Andy never has company, so who had that second cup? Should he not have come by today? He wracks his brain but cannot remember for the life of him if Andy has mentioned an appointment.
"Master Harry is needing to be patient. Things like this be needing time."
"Is that a promise?"
Seeing Draco waiting for him close to the hotel his heart gave a funny little lurch.
The worst part about loneliness is that most people don’t realize that it has crept up upon them until they wake up one morning and wonder when the last time was that someone, other than a family member, touched them.
“Hm.” She seems happy enough with that explanation and sips her tea. They sit in silence for a while, but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable. His thoughts are drifting, so that he doesn’t hear her first question. She touches his shoulder gently and he realises with mortification that she must have tried to get his attention for quite some time.
“Oh.” She nods “Well Harry is Teddy’s godfather and just wanted to see how he is doing.”
"The wand worked okay for charms. But Harry, my job requires transfiguration and some defense spells. With this wand I cannot even raise a proper shield." Draco looked hopefully at him. "I know you said two days, but I had to check. Have you made progress with my wand?"
I am an idiot, I scold myself  "Oh, you can't eat like this, can you?"  But I can help this easily enough, picking the pillow and plate up settling it onto my lap completely. I hand him tiny pieces of meat and it is oddly satisfying to feel the tiny teeth take the offered morsels gently. Slowly he grows more confident and the pain seems to recede. After a while he bumps my fingers away, indicating that he has eaten his fill and settles back down for more rest.
“We have been friends for 10 years, and I have been your healer for four of these. If I don’t know you, then who does?” She bows towards him “This is serious, please keep this in in mind
become invisible. But now he is missing the strength to fight against the feeling of loneliness. So all he does is shrug his shoulders, straighten his back, and tell himself that it is better this way and trudges on. He does so for years and nobody cares, for all he knows.
“‘t was not your fault” Harry tried to explain. “Remember the last real letter I replied to?”
Sleep eludes him for quite a long time that night.
The beauty of the path that led up to the waterfalls took his breath away, but he focused more on the man that kept showing him butterflies and plants. Draco seemed truly at home on this island and what more he was at peace with himself, Harry found himself longing for such peace. He wanted to be as much at home in his own skin as Draco already seemed to be.
Draco swallowed, his throat suddenly too dry. Any moment now he was going to hyperventilate. How could he answer this question? Which answer would not make him look like an absolute psycho…
“Your hero complex knows no bounds does it?” Draco snorts. “You are letting nobody down, by not becoming an Auror. I daresay you are not even suited to being one.”
“Hm, you are so warm,” he sighs, morning breath be damned he leans over and kisses Harry.
Hermione smiled as she looked at the picture that was enclosed within the envelope. Harry held a huge basket with produce, while Draco was obviously selecting the best fish from the fisher, half turned towards Harry with a gentle smile and his hand outstretched towards Harry who laughed about something.
“Do you know that when you spend too much time outside in the cold, your tissue first turns pale and feels like pins and needles, then red with blisters and then you lose all feeling, while the tissues freezes?” Draco said it almost clinically detached. “The advantage of being a wizard is that you can regrow such tissues again and again.”
Draco was glad for the routine the new job gave him, it kept him from overthinking.
Tora has gone missing. I cannot recall a time, when I felt this scared for an animal before, but then again. She is so much more to me. I search through every room, and even in the gardens, nothing. But just as I am about to give up, I hear a voice talking to someone. Potter is back in the Manor, to work with mother I guess. She is almost back to her former self. Not that it helps much with my own issues, but that I don't have to worry about her breaking down again and leaving me for good is a tremendous relief.
I get ready for my day, thinking about the logistics. It doesn't help I have to try and transfigure a loo for a cat and find a way, to take him with me to the cafe. I can't leave him here alone, the poor little thing.
. It is "unofficially" ranked as the only naturist beach on the island. Nudism is part of the daily life of this place even though it is officially forbidden. I haven't heard of anybody getting arrested for being nude there. It definitely is a gay meeting place. But it is also known for a lot of voyeurs being there. So if you do like that sort of thing, I would say go for it."
“I knew you didn’t listen to a word that the Headmistress said!” Hermione sounds resigned. “If you had, you would have blown up then.”
Soon he had found the shelf with the hawthorn wands, riffling through the contents on the shelf, he picked three wands with different cores.
Draco placed an assortment of foods on the table that made Harry's mouth water.
He has not been back to the flat that he shared with his ex, and is immensely grateful that Hermione and Ron just gathered his things and took care of the lease. But the conversation Ron had with him while Hermione spelled his things into the closet, remains with him for a long time.
The shop with the attached atelier is perfect. He loves the light falling into the backroom, and he can see himself already working with the fitting models.
"So nice of you to join us, Senior Auror Potter." Robarts raised his eyebrow in a manner that reminded Harry of a certain blond. He still missed him, but he pushed that thought far back into the back of his mind.
But he has chosen his path. Dictated by his love for his family, and he will stick to it, hoping that it will not bring him further pain than it already has. So he keeps moving the needle through the fabric and breathes in and out.
“Better get used to it. I am a very physical person with people I care for. I love cuddling and Pansy has compared me more often than I care to count to an overgrown cat. Which is particularly ironic seeing what our house symbols are.”
at the mess, before he went to the kitchen, to tell Harry about his mishap. He just hoped that Harry had not been too fond of the old glass.
“Please, don’t tell me.” Ron groans as he falls into his seat next to him. “You are watching him again?”
"Don't worry. I am glad I got to spend time with you. It gave me an opportunity to see you as you are, and not as who you thought you had to be." Harry smiles again.
“No, but I want to understand.” Harry was asking honestly
Draco remained silent for a long while, but he held onto his hand.
“Did you listen to a single word of headmistress McGonagall’s speech?”
He should have been able to defeat Voldemort weeks ago, but he had needed the time to gather the final Horcrux.
When the customers come, I work with a smile and a tune on my lips. And when I turn around two hours later, I see that Phoenix has emptied his bowl of water and is watching me avidly.
Draco raised his hand and tried to flex it, the newly healed skin pulled a little, but his finger movement looked mostly alright. The entire inside of his right palm was pinkish scar tissue, and he winced, realising that Fleur was right, such damage indicated that his magic had nearly burned itself out in the fight against the curse.
Draco reaches out and the symbolism is not lost on him. "Thank you for doing good with it." No other words are needed.
"Pansy." I can't really put into words what my mind keeps telling me.
The folds of the robe are soft and designed not to cause physical discomfort, and to anybody else, they would hide Harry’s state well from the world, but to him who has created this very piece of clothing, it hides nothing. He breathes out and Harry shivers.
“So magical architecture or restoration?” Pansy looks at him speculatively.
“Of course they would think the worst of me.” He sounds bitter.
A man, if I judge the timber of his voice, correctly. But not a voice that I recognizes immediately. Mother solves the mystery inadvertently for me and I feel something within me tremble.
Potter throws him a challenging look. “Yeah, are you?”
"So do I pass judgement? Oh, and to answer your question, Pansy invited me." Harry smiles and that open smile does something funny to Draco's innards. He feels warm all of a sudden.
He is wondering if the nightmares will ever stop, if he can ever shake of the past and move forward. Lord knows he has tried to make amends with sending the artefacts in to be destroyed, but deep down inside he knows that he won’t be happy until he has come up with something that allows himself to give back to the wizarding community.
As he wakes drenched in cold sweat he becomes aware of the subtle sounds of the lullaby ringing through his bedroom. Gripping his wand, to cast a shaky
I still can't believe that I have him. That I get to make love to him, from now on until our life ends.
potion, grateful he sank back onto the pillow.
“You know you can’t save them all? You will lose people to their illnesses.”
"Master Harry be calling?" Tibby popped into the lounge, eyes widening as she saw Draco's unconscious form. "Can Tibby help?"
He steps into Malfoy’s arms and Harry can see when his position all but melts into something pliable to be moved around to Malfoy’s liking. Ugly words ring through his ears, words he heard so often when Petunia watched her dancing show and male couples performed,
“Potter would never get in trouble with you,” Draco murmured.
“Alright?” Harry sounds strained and Draco moves back slightly taking him deeper. Still no pain beyond a slight stretch, and Draco moans. “Deeper”
“Why wouldn’t I be?” Draco tries to keep it together, he really does, but when Harry touches his cheek in concern, softly stroking the skin there he loses it. He needs to get away from Harry before the spell breaks, for it can’t have been something else that brought him here, and he can’t bear to see Harry look at him with disgust. How long does he have? Days? Hours, minutes? Harry frowns at him, already losing the tender smile that he has gifted him with during the last weeks and months, how much will he hate him when he realizes that he slept next to an unreformed criminal, someone who has taken his free will away, through an artefact. It probably won’t matter that he had no idea what the music box was, that he had just hoped to find happiness. What happiness could there be if Harry didn’t choose him freely, and he hadn’t. Otherwise he would have tried to get physical with him, wouldn’t he?
“I think I have been dosed with a lust potion.” He has to say it like this.
The food is fantastic and Harry eats with joy. Draco smiles, keeping half an eye on Teddy while taking bites of quiche.
Harry complies with his begging, giving himself as much as taking Draco apart. Quickly he seals them away behind the blinds of his bed and divests Draco from his clothes. Only when every inch of creamy skin has been revealed to his greedy eyes, does he stop for a second to strip himself.
“I am a fucked up mess,” Harry laughs shakily.
"Hello, Draco. I had hoped that I was still Harry to you?" The smooth baritone does strange things to Draco's insides.
“And, pray tell, why would that be the case! The only reason it would not take..." He trailed of, looking at the goblin, realization growing "NO!"
I have my wand not with me most of the time, and I barely use it for my own anymore. But I will miss Phoenix. He has grown on me and talking to him at night, feeling his warm weight next to me, it has made me aware of the loneliness that I have simply accepted most of the time.
“Maybe you are overthinking this,” Blaise says softly, after holding it for the longest time.
"How did you know?"
“Why did you leave? Was it something I did?”
“Oh, there is a way to do that.” The Boy, almost a man, drawls as he slouches onto the makeshift couch.
“Hello Nephew, I have the kettle on. Or I can make hot chocolate. But please come inside.”
Harry grinned, turned towards Draco pulled softly on his hand, so he stumbled towards him before he pressed a soft kiss to his lips. It wasn’t the longest or the most erotic kiss Draco had ever received, but it was by far the best.
“Ok, nothing bad apart from a black eye and a busted lip. Hold still.”
He gets up and leaves the room, his heart beating wildly. He can’t deny that he wonders if they have always been going in this direction, but Draco’s magic feels like the anchor he has always searched for and he feels complete in ways that he has only known during eighth year, when Draco was his pillar of strength.
"Then what are you waiting for?"
The other man in the room, rose and headed towards the door.
Getting dressed, and transfiguring a sling for my little addon is done quite quickly. And if there is a little spring in my step, well I am strangely excited about the day ahead.
When Harry shyly touches his furled opening, Draco almost flies off the bed, his body reacts so strongly.
For within this book the family records every bond made by its members. It does so even when they are not aware of having even entered one. Sometimes such thing is a curse, sometimes it proves itself to be a blessing. For a bond which is written down in this book can only be broken by the family member who has made it.
She blushes deeply, but stands her ground. “Because he told me. He also said that you are taking it slow, I am sorry, if I made you uncomfortable.”
The music box floats with them as Draco puts his baby cousin into the bassinette. The lullaby gentles and drifts off when Teddy falls asleep. Draco sits with him, listening to the soft breathing for a long time.
But just as he is sure that he is reaching the breaking point and will go insane if he spends one more day alone, the door to his cell opens. Kingsley Shacklebolt steps into the cell.
Harry hated the resigned look on Draco's face.
"Are you aware of the little inconvenience that has befallen your uhm... 'friendship with my son?" I can't believe that my father puts things so bluntly. He must be desperate to break the bond while I am still technically under his jurisdiction.
"You know I wish your owner would be as easy to talk to. I think he is quite lonely here in the Manor, and with his Mum being so insecure still, I hate to think of him alone with only you for company. Not that you are not wonderful company of course." He chuckles at Tora's soft meow. I swear that cat understands exactly what is being said! "Draco doesn't like me. I cocked that up for good I think." A lump is in my throat all of a sudden. Potter wants me to like him?
"I think we need a cup of tea for this conversation." Harry breathed deeply, "Do you still take it with a splash of milk and one sugar?"
"Water" he croaked, and when he felt a straw being placed in between his lips, he sipped gratefully. After having had his fill he turned his head away.
"I was just preparing to come by, Mr Malfoy. She is not in critical condition according to the Healers, and I wanted to talk to you about the circumstances of her breakdown."
The green eyes are searching desperately for a sign on his face, and Draco wants so desperately for it to be just for him, but he can’t leave Harry in the dark. He will probably hate him, but then at least everything is out in the open.
"I meant what I said. And you know it! You know the problem is that you can run as much as you want and as far as you can dream of, but it will never solve your issues."
"You recognized my style?" Draco can just repeat the statement because he cannot wrap his mind around the words upon hearing them.
Draco chuckled and followed him to the car without further flirting. But the looks that he kept throwing at Harry, were heated.
"Are you here often?" blurting out the question, before I can reign my thoughts in, I find myself blushing, "I don't want to stalk you, or anything, it is just..."
He is for all accounts as close to happy as he has been in ages.
---------------------------
"I hope you didn't wait long?" Harry looked at Draco taking in the relaxed sprawl of the long legs. Draco looked like a graceful cat in the lounge, and he had a basket next to his chair.
He was certain that Molly would ask him quite a fair amount of questions. But before she would be able to do so, the kids would be all over him as soon as he stepped into the tumult that the Burrow was on Sundays.
For most of his life whenever Harry Potter, made a spectacular fool out of himself, there was one person around to see it. Ron Weasley.
"So how have you done it? Crups are aggressive towards Muggles as far as I know. Isn't it a burden for you not to be able and meet Lucy freely?" Is that jealousy that I am feeling for this unknown woman?
Okay—that is it. He is losing his final marbles, he has been alone for too long and now…
And he let Teddy down to run over to Harry. Picking the energetic child up and settling him on his other hip, Harry shot him a quick and easy grin before turning on the spot and Disappeared.
“Yes.”
“What happened Pans?” He uses the childhood nickname she hated so much because it is one of the few things that still make her smile.
Andy looks frail and much older than her years. The Healer making his rounds looks up as they enter the room.
Ginny watched the weather for several weeks before she made the connection. And when she did she was not happy. Winter in England was rarely pleasant, but when one threw a lovesick wizard, of the calibre of Harry Potter into the mix, then it was a guarantee for disaster.
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Harry replied, greeting Draco with the customary kisses to the cheeks, inhaling his unique scent.
“I simply felt that with Harry—” And the name on his lips does feels so strange, and seeing Potter’s face hearing it is no easier. “—being present, I would not intrude. He hasn’t seen Teddy in weeks, and we have never gotten along well.” He swallows the bile in his throat and simply continues “I am aware that most of that is my own fault. I simply did not want to walk into an altercation and I didn’t want to hear that I am corrupting an innocent baby with my evil Slytherin ways.” He turns away.
“Well, I remember that Draco hates nothing more than to lose control.” He grins and there is a promise of pain in his eyes.
"She won't." Harry looked at him and the tentative hope that shone in those expressive green eyes was too much. Draco stepped closer and looked straight at him "You said you owe me kisses."
"Draco," She takes my hand in a rare show of affection. "You deserve some happiness. And if you have gone and fallen in love with Potter, then why not?"
"That was..."
"Yes she is well, and I am sure that she would love to hear from you. I understand if you don't want to give up what you have built here for you, but I am sure that she will understand that as well."
“I don’t care.” Draco turned to Harry. “I will not go outside and freeze, it is not my fault that there is no snow in the city. Such days are better spend on the couch.”
"No, I just got the pint when you stepped in. Do you want one as well?"
Warmth, perfect warmth is the first thing that filters into his consciousness. But also a sense of wrongness, his body seems strange. When he blinks his eyes focus on skin, has he gone home with someone? But slowly his memories trickle back, he has been injured and the pain that hits him like a freight train, causes him to moan loudly. But it is not his own voice that he hears, but a soft meow. His eyes focus on his own tiny body and the fact that he is covered in bandaged, down to his paws.
"Hey." He greeted the regal animal with a soft voice, the bird truly was magnificent. If he was not mistaken it was an Eurasian Eagle Owl, blinking at him with orange eyes.
Harry turns towards him now taking his hand and going into the arms that will always protect him. His own clear voice carries through the hall,
The pleading and whispering is getting louder though, the farther he walks into the direction of the unused east wing. The longer he focuses, the clearer the voices become, sounding like a child begging for attention and he feels the pleas tug at his heartstrings. Who knows if these voices are manifestations of former Malfoys? Of spectres caught within these walls? He is so focused on the pleas of not being left alone that he walks past the door at first.
"I cannot just go up to him and tell him that we are officially betrothed!" I am horrified at the simple thought.
. When the flavours burst in my mouth I felt warmth and love. Once I was done eating she sat down across from me and made me talk." He chuckled deprecatingly. "Would you believe that I cried my eyes out right there in that restaurant? I was so done hiding all of my pain, and if she wanted to laugh at a grown man bawling like a baby, well I didn't have enough strength left to be upset."
"Bullshit!" It is terribly uncouth, but if Potter believes that my parents ever cared about giving me space and trying to avoid upsetting  me, he has another thing coming. But before I can tell him, exactly how my parents handled such things before, Patsy clambers up on my shoulder and a wet tongue swipes through my face, the movement so suddenly that a startled laugh escapes me, and my right hand automatically cuddles her close.
"Did she?" Harry gripped the warm sand.
“Why did you leave?” It is a desperate deflection from the topic that he doesn’t want to think about right now.
He met up with Draco for a quick breakfast of coffee au lait for both of them and a brioche for him. A daily pain au chocolat would be too much and he enjoyed the soft brioche with the coffee. Draco had declined to eat something for breakfast and assured him that this was quite normal for him.
"Kid you are seventeen, you are allowed to do things that your mother won't approve of," Bill grinned at him. "You are way too serious."
Bill looked at him with a strange smile. "Sounds like you got it bad."
"Why would he care?" The words are out before he can control himself.
"Uhm, you may kiss each other?" Hermione sounds doubtful, as if this is the worst idea they could have come up with, but Harry doesn't take notice. He looks at Draco with question in his eyes, and Draco closes the gap between their lips. It is a chaste touch, but it ignites something deep inside of Harry, something he didn't know he was missing.
"Good night Harry."
When he headed into Teddy’s room, the lullaby had started to play out of its own accord. Teddy had been fast asleep before he had even put him into the bassinette.
He fails to understand what she implies. Should they just give up? The Manor as it stands is the only place where they can move about freely. Diagon Alley won’t give them a happy welcome, as he realised when trying to go shopping for some needed potions ingredients.
“Mad?”
Why would Draco acknowledge the other Aurors, congratulate them on their success, take interest in all of them, men and women alike apart from Harry?
“You wanted an answer.” There is a hitch in Draco’s voice and he only nods softly.
Phoenix lays in his basket and watches. Draco is an enigma to him, he seems sad about something but overall content with his lot in life.
He does notice that he has even fewer nightmares since sharing the bed with Harry and Teddy, but he refuses to think about it.
, he struggles to breathe. His heart races, as he stares up to the ceiling, counting each tiny fissure.
Draco's face betrayed nothing, but he nodded. "It will be all done tomorrow morning. Have a good evening." He turned away. Harry was baffled, what had he done wrong now? Didn't Draco want him to be professional and stop vying for his attention?
"I do suggest we do the circling of the peak, before we do our picnic., heading back will take another four hours at least and we do need to get back up to the
He is happy to return to England now. His home is calling to him, even though he has found peace in leaving places and exploring unknown cities, he has soaked up knowledge and knows that he is ready. It won't be easy, but it is time.
She kept throwing him looks and grinned, talking in rapid French with Draco, whom she kept calling Lucien. Well Harry surmised that "Draco" was not a name that one could use in a muggle environment.
"Bring me a cool flannel and a
And so Harry complied and talked about the last few years. He didn't mention the fact that he kept leaving again and again. Right now the cold was still kept at bay and he enjoyed the time with Draco.
Draco puts his own head back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling. Harry is a warm solid presence next to him and they are silent for a long time.
How can he leave Draco - whom he has grown to love.
“Morning Potter.” There, that should be normal enough. He used to care about Potter's attention, wanting it with a passion if he remembers his first years in school. Now however, there is nothing. But one responds to a cordial greeting and he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself any longer.
“Coming?” Draco called over his shoulder and stepped into the water. He turned onto his back and splashed about as if he had not a care in the world. Harry stared for a minute before dropping his clothes apart for his underpants and stepped gingerly into the water.
Draco's cheeks grew warm. His mother would probably start planning their wedding as soon as they left the room. She knew where his true passion lay and wanted him happy.
Harry couldn’t help it. It wasn’t as if he meant to sabotage Draco’s outings. But when the anonymous owl reached him, informing him about Draco’s progress in getting over their break up it brought everything up again and he spent the day pondering where they had gone wrong.
"Uhm" and such eloquence from my mouth, I wish the earth would open and just swallow me down.
"Thank you, I rarely indulge but I do love chocolate." Draco bit into his breakfast and directed Harry through the streets of the city, which was called
The lock turns and Draco enters his house. He swallows and steps up towards his companion.
"Oh come on Draco! Don’t you love the smell of pumpkin spice, and cinnamon? The crisp air in the morning and the light that catches in the coloured leaves?" Harry laughed. "I love coming home in the autumn, after a long walk, snuggling into my favourite blanket in front of the fireplace with a good book and hot chocolate!"
“Well, now we are going to make sure that you will be alright.” Draco smiles at her. “We are taking care of Teddy, unless you want someone else to take him?”
"Marianna will have a fit!" Draco laughs.
"I can eat." Harry grinned and stepped out onto the beach, he loved the feeling of sand underneath his feet. They looked for a place a little off from the people enjoying their time off and settled onto a blanket that Draco had brought with him.
"STOP!" he screamed, but too late. Bill had finished the casting. Draco could only watch in horror as the spell unravelled the superficial curse, triggering the trap that Bellatrix had set for men of his profession. Bill had turned, when the paralysing element of the curse struck and he froze mid-motion, halfway turned towards him.
"Yaxley contacted me, after the trial. He told me that I would soon be dead if I didn't disappear." Draco shakes his head. "I wasn't willing to take a chance, and left the wizarding world."
"You have never..."
"If you make noises like that while eating I envy your lovers." Draco sounded breathless and pushed a couple of pastries towards him that reminded Harry of doughnuts.
And off she was and left Harry standing in the parlour.
“Oy!” Harry laughs against his will, even though his heart still aches a little.
"You know that Potter hasn't fixed my wand yet. But no it isn't bad enough that he has weaselled his way into my life under the pretence of fixing my problems. No, that it isn't enough that he has my fucking mother wrapped around his little finger. Not bad enough that I depend on his presence to cast the simplest spells But the icing on my fucking cake is that this ridiculous wannabe wandmaker, with a people- saving-complex manages to invoke some fucking martial ritual of my crazy aunt's family. And instead of freaking out, he just tells me to '
"Mate, that was not what I meant." Ron looked at the billowing Auror robes of his best friend. "Well fuck."
“Harry, we all are sick in a sense. We all underwent trauma, severe trauma and they left us alone with it. We are kids and they left us to deal with this on our own.”
“I want you too, but not here, when my balls are freezing. And my skin is covered in goose-flesh for the entirely wrong reasons. Please, can we have dinner together and maybe you can stay the night?”
"I activated the first one of my Auror emergency portkeys, and one of the smugglers must have recognized it, because the idiot set Fiendfyre lose. Draco, two of the Potioneers were barely twenty, in over their heads, they were terrified, their screams where horrible." he tapered off, now that the story was out, he realized that Draco was right in being angry. Not for one second had he thought about Ron or Hermione. Barely even spared Draco a thought, just working to get the two kids out and then the building had begun to collapse. He really had made it out at the last possible moment. He just hoped the wards had contained the fire, and kept it from spreading through the neighbours' homes.
“Haggis” he bites out and walks up the moving staircase before he can think things through.
"I am sorry I am so late" He blurts out, just when Draco steps around the bar very close to him as if to pull him into a hug.
and he loved the impressions and sensations, the film that was shown on the first level showed the power of the volcanoes still active in La reunion and gave a memorial to those that had died in their exploration, going forward he lingered within the Lavatunnel that gave him a sense of being within a Volcano. It was very impressive but after spending three hours on the premises his stomach growled and he realized that he needed to come up with an idea on lunch.
And just like that, everything Harry had believed to know about Draco has come to a standstill. He stills completely in order not to miss anything else,
"They are united in death as they were in life." Harry mumbled. "Did Lance have a Holly Wand by chance?"
Contrary to the belief of most Hogwarts students, Draco doesn’t check his drinks for poison each morning. The way he sees it, if someone is dedicated enough to poison him and put him out of his misery, he will not take that pleasure away from them. Somewhere along the lines he just stopped caring about being alive or dead. He doesn’t taste much when he swallows the tea the elves serve each morning and he goes through the motions of putting food into his mouth. It all tastes of bland nothingness anyway.
“Are you sure, you’d rather stay here, instead of coming outside with us?” Harry tried one last time, only to receive a glare.
"Well, I like looking good. And you once told me, that if I want people to take me seriously I need to look my best. I took that to heart." Harry looks at him, with such sincerity that Draco doesn't think twice.
“What I don’t understand is: why do you think it defines you? These are a sign that you survived a war. That you fought and lived. They don’t make you worth less. If anything in my eyes they make you worth more.”
“Can we get out of here?” His voice is slightly hoarse, and something must be different, telling to Harry, because he doesn't ask. Just nods slightly and steers Draco out of the club. His hand on the small of his back, feels halfway possessive and protective at the same time.
With that cryptic bit of advice, she waves him goodbye and steps out of the frame.
He cursed, the repair had not held after all. Well, he would get through the work day and then go back to Harry's shop and have him look at the wand again.
He dries himself with a quick spell, and sobers, indicating for her to sit on the sofa.
Every day Harry comes back, and Draco accepts defeat after three days. If the spell is still active he will hope that at least it has lessened enough for Harry to have a clearer mind.
"Thank you for your time, Mr Ollivander. I need to think about this."
"Bill, would you believe me that I care very much for him?" Harry sighed. "One could say that me caring as much as I do, has caused this fucking mess in the first place,"
“But it didn’t make you feel better.” Draco looks at her.
“When I saw you unconscious, saw what you had done to yourself, everything inside of me reached out and even if you didn’t want me in your life after this baby is born, I needed to make sure that you get through this unscathed. I have no definite proof, but I believe that the life-debt between us played into it as well. So, the connection that we have had ever since you pulled me from the fire, acted in the best way possible.”
It was small, but Harry loved it. The kitchenette held a small hob where he could boil water for his cuppa and the occasional fried egg or two. He also loved it because it was his and his alone. Being in the shop gave him a sense of peace that few other places could bring him, he could lose himself in his work here.
Draco leans down further at that, brushing his lips against Harry’s softly, questioning, ready to retreat at any show of discomfort on Harry’s side.
"Mr Potter, it was so kind of you to come by. Please will you do it again?"
"You know, there are not many people out there, which actually understand what this war has done to us." He keeps talking and I feel that what the crups are doing for Mother, Tora is doing for him at the moment. I don't want to admit that she has done the same for me so often, but the knowledge has taken root and won't be shaken.
That they are wonderful in bed together, is an added bonus. But one that the rest of the world does not need to know.
“No, surprisingly not.”
"I am as well as can be expected. Can you tell him that?"
"But I can hold this for an entire day, and I want to look like the both of you."
“In the end we are young, and we have been hurt badly. The adults in our lives have failed to understand us, and hoped we would just get over it on our own. I don’t blame Blaise for wanting to ease Ginny’s pain. I blame you for not trying to help us work through the problems.” He looks at Minerva and sees her face ashen and old.
Harry had again wanked leisurely in the morning, imagining Draco's mouth on him until he came explosively over the tiled floor. He let the pleasure linger for a little while before he got dressed and headed outside. He did indulge with a pain au chocolate for breakfast again, resolving to go for a swim to work of the calories before he would head to
“You want me to put Teddy to bed?” Harry asks, surprise evident in his voice.
Harry takes a breath wanting to say that his is fine on his own, but Hermione frowns and Ron is halfway out of his chair as well.
"Well, I am going by my real name, my second name to be correct." Draco grinned, Harry's breath caught at the spark of desire that shot through his belly. The careless grin made Draco breathtakingly attractive; his skin was kissed by the sun and had a healthy golden glow.
* Needing help *
“You can swear like a sailor when it suits you….”
“I will always be alright with you being around Teddy and Andy and of course myself.” Harry is so intent on reassuring him, he seems to forget that there is someone else in the room with him. How else would Draco explain that Harry is leaning towards him as if meaning to kiss him?
Harry realized that Draco had gained another couple of inches on him and he carried himself with a grace.
Andy smiles at that but it is a sad one. “Are you unable to spend any time with Harry in my house?”
As soon as he swallows the warm liquid, warmth spreads though him. Every cell in his body feels alight with want and need honed into the direction of one person. His eyes find the object of his sudden desire and he groans internally. Whoever dosed him with this drug - because he knows that this is not natural attraction, has a sick sense of humour. Or they know him well and tried to play upon his baser instincts. But he has lived with the Dark Lord in his house and learned to ignore everything that was not related to survival.
Just when he decides that he has probably lost it, he hears a baby laugh. The sound is so clear that he steps towards the cradle, situated in the corner. When he bends over the bassinet the whispers stop abruptly.
Harry was nervous. He had never felt this kind of connection with anyone. If he was entirely honest with himself it had always been Draco that he had felt drawn to. The Slytherin had been a presence in his life that he hadn't consciously acknowledged, but now that he had felt Draco's skin against his, and had tasted him he knew that leaving this behind would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.
put in
She had never known him to be cynical, and her heart ached at the thought.
They come to the end of the song, and just stare at each other for a long time. Draco bends down and kisses Harry right there in the middle of the Great hall and Harry… Harry just melts into the kiss, he doesn't care any longer what anybody would say, he is safe and happy and Draco will spend his life trying to make sure he is happy. It is quiet for a second, and then a storm breaks loose, all of their classmates clapping and catcalling .
"Guilty."
The dreams are always the same.
"Once the pattern is done, I can cut and start with a first fitting after hefting the clothes. That is where you come in."
"I remember when you left. Bill was not all that happy with you for a while." Draco grinned, and made no move to pull his hand away.
“I did not fight a fucking war to have one bigotry replaced by another!”
Harry had lost what little colour he had had to begin with. "Ok, I need to check one more thing, but I think I know what happened."
"I see." Ollivander frowned, before he shook his head. "I am afraid I cannot help you Mr Malfoy. Your wand took the Detachment Curse intended for you, and there is no other way to put this, it detached itself from you. It saved your arm and life, but the connection between you and the wand was broken."
It remained present in nightmares and psychological traumata, in haunted faces and the overall exhaustion that gripped the wizarding world.
He wonders if he will ever have a child to carry this tradition on. Who would want to live with him? Disgraced, moody, tired most of the time, and prone to talk to the house-elves and ancestors, as if they could explain to him where he actually went wrong.
"Huh. I never took you for someone who runs away from his problems."
"Oui, mais je veux manger authentique cuisine."
If Harry insisted on indulging Teddy constantly, he would simply be absent.
When he just looked up, the look on Harry’s face was one that Draco is not unfamiliar with. It was blatant appreciation, mixed with a healthy amount of desire. But acting on this would surely end in disaster, so Draco pushes his own desire into the back of his mind. Being friends with Harry is one thing, taking care of Teddy with him another, but dating him would be an entirely different league.
