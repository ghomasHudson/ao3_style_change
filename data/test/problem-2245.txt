Draco shrugged. ‘Better.’
He was ready to swallow his pride and go back in when the door swung open.
“I have no idea what you’re trying to say to me,” she said. “But I’m going to assume it’s something about how honoured you are to meet me. You’re welcome.” Harry snorted and Malfoy glared at him, but the fox seemed very amused.
Draco blew his breath out slowly. He maybe had a way to fix this once and for all.
‘Shut up you nutter.’ Draco picked up his mug and arranged himself so that Harry could lean against him whilst sitting up far enough to drink his chocolate. Draco felt that balance had been restored now that he was back to being Harry’s pillow rather than Draco hanging off him like a deranged koala like he had a few days ago.
‘He can’t tell her she can’t do it just because she’s a girl!’ She said like Draco was stupid. He couldn’t help it, he tipped his head back and laughed loudly.
‘I have nine toes and a purple beret on my head.’
‘Oh! Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean- well, you are beautiful. I did mean it.’ He shrugged awkwardly as Draco wondered how on earth they were going to get through this if they kept acting like that. He didn’t even know where to look. He was distracted as they were shown their table at the back of the restaurant, concealed behind an unnecessary column. Draco stopped walking and Harry didn’t notice for a few seconds, but he seemed to sense Draco’s hesitation, so he stopped and walked back towards him.
“Don’t get any ideas,” he said absently, “it’s not a pet name. It’s the codename we gave Sirius during the war. I didn’t think to keep it up with Remus, but he could be anywhere now and maybe it’s not so safe there. Or maybe he just wanted to keep that distance.” He drank more of his tea, the sugar helping to steady his wooziness, and wondered what he should do next. It was always Hermione who came up with the plans that actually worked – well, worked better than his would have anyway. Not that any plan they’d ever made ever worked out the way they’d wanted it to.
The taxi dropped them near the Leaky Cauldron, and Draco could tell this was going to be difficult purely by the sheer volume of people in the pub alone. He was always careful to avoid crows with Teddy, not wanting to put him at risk by having an anxiety attack when Teddy was his sole responsibility.
If Draco had had the strength, he might have pointed out that she didn’t mean it, that she would never have said anything like that herself, and that being angry at him wouldn’t help matters. He might even have said that he did indeed say that to Potter, in part, and that he did at least ask him to think about it, to consider the consequences.
Harry shot bolt upright. He was sure he’d just heard someone shouting for him. It was pitch black and he couldn’t remember where he was. He tried to sit up, but a hand shot out from the darkness and pushed him back down. He fought, panic rising in his chest until a lamp flickered on and shed some light on the large room.
“Sirius,” Harry began cautiously after he had cleared their plates, “were you and Remus ever…”
Now, contrary to popular belief, Harry wasn’t an idiot. He wasn’t under any misguided belief that make up’s only purpose was to make people look pretty or to help them hide themselves. He had seen the way Luna used those magipowders on her eyelids to make each blink look like fluttering butterflies. He’d seen the way Hermione meticulously chose the exact shade of lipstick that would match her outfit because it made her feel organised and powerful; he knew that Dean’s amazing ability to always produce the most symmetrical and precise winged eyeliner was his way of expressing his creative drive.
‘I wouldn’t worry about it right now,’ the mediwitch told him, still smiling at him kindly, ‘I’m afraid this is probably going to knock you out again. It doesn’t enjoy being mixed with your usual medications.’ She handed him the tincture and he downed it, wincing at the horrible taste. Within a few seconds he felt it crawling through his veins like icy water. ‘I’m so glad you’re awake, you should make a quicker recovery now that I’ve been able to administer the dosage this way. Honestly, the ointment isn’t nearly so effective. I’ll leave you two to say your goodbyes before Mr Potter falls asleep again.’ The mediwitch bustled off to her next patient and Draco felt good, even if everything had just gotten a whole lot more complicated than it had been before.
“It’s not ideal that you were seen arguing with Harry,” she continued. “But there is no evidence to suggest any foul play. I’ve found witnesses who say they saw you and Harry leaving separately, and on
‘I don’t like surprises,’ he said wearily, putting the ribbon marker between the pages.
‘I see you have the file Macmillan was talking about. Great.’ He entered the room properly and sat on the edge of Draco’s desk. He was momentarily shocked at the familiarity of the gesture.
‘Thank you, Mr Harry,’ she said timidly. Draco thought she was unbelievably cute, and it struck him how differently she viewed him to Harry. She would never have called him Mr Draco.
Harry very carefully apparated them home, something he shouldn’t really do since Ron had had three pints, but that he often did anyway. It was a good decision because he fell flat on his face when they reached their destination and definitely wouldn’t have survived a trip via the floo network. They had been out all day and their small flat was dark and cold. The sort of cold that made you feel damp as well as chilled. Harry immediately lit the fire and turned the mismatched lamps on as Ron hauled himself up off the floor and collapsed in the scruffy armchair Harry had rescued from Grimmauld before he had sold it.
“Yes he does, he’s a magical fox!”
‘We?’ Smith sat far too still for Draco’s liking. He’d hardly moved a muscle the whole time Draco had been there, and it was making him uncomfortable. He took a deep breath. If he wanted this to be over, he may as well tell Smith something, get him off his back.
It didn’t sound so lovely to Harry, he’d never heard of that name. “Aspen?”
Draco was wounded. This began long before their divorce and Draco hadn’t known a thing.
‘You’re allowed to be angry at me. Heck, I’d rather you be angry at me than you be as calm as this. Are you sure everything’s ok?’ Draco didn’t know how to take that. Was he supposed to be angry? Did Harry think he was an angry person?
‘I don’t think I can.’ His voice wobbled. Harry put his hand over the last piece. Draco’s skin had cooled rapidly since the sheets had slipped from his shoulders and pooled around his waist, and Harry’s hands were warm as ever.
He must’ve drifted back off the sleep after that, as when he resurfaced the healer was gone and the shadows in the room had shifted dramatically with the sun. He figured it was probably sometime in the late afternoon. Harry was gone too, which made Draco feel oddly bereft.
‘Are you my friend?’ She looked up at him hopefully with her big brown eyes. It was a loaded question and one he knew he shouldn't answer.
‘Is that all? From my notes I can see that you never wanted for anything as a child.’ Draco looked at Smith indignantly.
‘Don’t be a git, it’s Christmas.’ He began scooping up the shreds of wrapping paper they’d left strewn all over the floor, but Harry stopped him.
“What do you mean, ‘no’? I haven’t even told you what it is yet…” He should have known that their ease with each other was only temporary. It would take a miracle for them to truly get along.
Harry turned and grabbed his wand from the bedside table, hurrying towards the bathroom and abandoning Aspen by the window. He burst through the door and found Malfoy standing in the middle of the room, broken glass all over the floor around her, droplets of dark green liquid splattered up the wall. She turned to look at him in the doorway.
‘Is that necessary? It’s ok if you don’t want me involved, but I can give you space when you need it. I’m always out somewhere doing things for the orphanage anyway.’
‘Dad?’ Harry had almost reached the door, but he stopped and turned back around.
“Ok, what’s going on?” He asked the sorry group.
While he waited for someone to arrive who could untie his hands and offer him the floo call he was entitled to, he sat there pondering who he could call and what he would say. Pansy was no use; she already knew where he was and what she could do.
Draco watched the way the fluttering light reflected in Harry’s eyes and sharpened his jawline even more. ‘I don’t share enough with you. I thought we established that.’ Harry walked over to one of the sofas and picked up one of the blankets Draco had left on one of the cushions.
Draco felt like a fool. He hadn’t really meant to say what he had. Did he really think he loved Harry more than Harry loved him? He hadn’t even realised that was an issue for him. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he had thought that once they’d finally gotten around to talking, it would be some kind of light switch moment. If anything, he’d only become more closed off since. It was as though letting himself be vulnerable had sent his anxiety into overdrive.
‘No. This isn’t your problem to deal with. You should go to school and talk to your friends and study for your lessons and have fun and just be a child. The war is over and I’m not a death eater and no one gets to use any of that against you.’ He didn’t know why he never thought about what his own reputation would do to Teddy. It had been somewhat improved because of Harry, but ever since they’d divorced it had naturally returned to what it was before. It shouldn’t be anything to do with Teddy. Draco had to deal with his own mistakes, no one else should have to do it for him.
He jumped when Harry gripped his wrist and took his wand out of his hand. He was about to panic when Harry said,
It worked out quite well for him, as that meant he could spend his days searching the streets of wizarding Paris for a suitable lot for the apothecary he wanted to open and navigating his way around the city finding the best fresh markets and bakeries and coffee houses. Then, in the evenings, he’d apparate to the chateau and work on the wards. It was gruelling; Draco hadn’t done so much complex wandwork since the war, and he stumbled into bed in the early hours of the morning and fell straight to sleep. The physical exercise and the proper use of his magic was doing wonders for Draco’s anxiety, and he’d cut down on his potion doses from two a day to just one with his breakfast. He missed Teddy terribly, but he hoped his lack of encounters with Eltanin meant Teddy was settling in well at Hogwarts. Draco had infuriated his mother when he’d forgotten to owl her at all during his first term, so he did his best to understand.
he thought when he went over their last conversation. There was nothing left to say between then, and although Harry knew nothing of his plans to move to Paris, Draco was sure he’d be more than happy to get Draco out of the way now that their somewhat tenuous arrangement was no longer necessary.
‘Daco!’ When they reached the second floor Draco was tackled by Johnny. He latched onto Draco’s legs and he bent down to hoist him up onto his hip. ‘Hawweeeeeee’ He squealed when he noticed him too.
‘Um, yes, of course. Is everything ok?’ Harry shook his head and muttered something under his breath that Draco didn’t catch. He tried to ask him, but he was already turning tails and storming out.
‘That’s not why you won’t talk you him. We’ve been making progress today Draco, don’t throw it away now. The only person you’re hindering is yourself.’ Why did he have to be so bloody self-righteous all the time.
‘I tried, Hermione. I’ve made it four months and nothing’s any different.’ He was frustrated. He’d hoped she’d see the effort he’d gone to and how much it had affected him.
‘I don’t know, Harry. I really don’t know.
‘Oh?’ Harry said without taking his eyes away from the dishes. It was so domestic Draco was thrown back five years to a different time.
By the third month of Draco’s agreement with Hermione, work was becoming unbearable. One Wednesday afternoon, he found himself sprinting up from the labs to Harry’s office.
‘Anytime. Come on then, let’s get you that ice cream. This is going to be your favourite weekend ever.’ Draco said, jumping up with feigned enthusiasm. Teddy’s grin lit up his whole face.
‘The Malfoys, Master. Spungen can feel the house will accept an heir from the Noble House of Black, should Master know the correct procedures.’ Spungen shot Draco a scarily knowing look for a house elf addressing his master. ‘Spungen will prepare the chateau now.’ With a crack Spungen was gone.
‘Don’t be ridiculous. Just look at her.’ He gestured over to where Ella was chattering away with Daphne like they’d known each other for years. The horrible music that made Draco’s stomach sink started blasting and he nearly jumped out of his skin.
The menu was whisked out of his hands and the waiter disappeared. Draco was concentrating too hard on his breathing to notice and jumped when Harry took both of his hands in his.
“Sometimes with small words like et, that means and, they just did a sort of scribble rather than a real letter. I’ll show you next time I find one. People have been studying this for years. It’s called palaeography – the art of reading manuscripts. You should see a Merovingian script, it’s practically illegible.” Harry has no idea what on earth a Merovingian script is, but he could listen to Malfoy say long words like palaeography all day long.
‘So I shouldn’t trust it?’
‘I’m moving back to London. Permanently.’ She said with a smile. It was a nervous smile, as though she wasn’t sure what he’d say. He pulled her into a tight hug to ease her nervousness and wondered when he’d become such a sap. He felt like he hugged anyone and everyone these days.
“Yeah, well. I’m a criminal, aren’t I.” She said in a low tone. It crushed him to see her frown and turn away from him, to be so dismissive of herself.
Draco was dangerously close to letting Harry back into his heart based on one panic attack and a messy kiss in the kitchen. He felt like a giddy fifteen-year-old.
After a while, he picked himself up off the floor and went into his bedroom. He routed around at the back of the small wardrobe he now had after he’d thrown most of his clothes away and picked out a small black box. He pulled it open with shaky hands and stared at the platinum band nestled in the cushion.
‘Exactly. Think about it like a do over, returning everything to their original state. A factory reset, in muggle terms. When your magic was restored, any lingering effects of your bond with Harry were negated. So, any progress you might have made with your anxiety because of him and any additional help in severing the dark magic in your mark were undone.’
‘Really?’ Harry asked him as he pulled away. Draco could stare at his thoroughly kissed-debauched face forever. ‘You couldn’t feel it when I spend ten minutes continuously stabbing your hand, but
But only Harry and Draco know what really happened.
‘Why didn’t I think of that!’ He exclaimed a touchtone loudly. Hugo stirred slightly in his arms, but he rocked him gently and he didn’t wake.
about anything.
place anyway.” Granger shivered, no doubt remembering the time she spent in the manor with his aunt, but even her disgust only masked her anger for a second.
If he hadn’t been flying out the door – or in this case the fireplace – he probably would have needed a minute after that one. As it happened, he gave the piece of parchment a cheeky grin and shook his head at it. Not that it could see him do it, obviously.
‘That’s enough for me. I shouldn’t complain, you know how much I love you in those glasses.’ Draco rolled his eyes.
‘Why can’t I levitate myself?’ Teddy asked whilst floating in the air above Draco’s head. Harry was standing next to him, levitating Teddy so that he could put the star on the top of the tree
‘Fine,’ he sighed, letting the topic drop. ‘You still have to explain who your not-girlfriend is though.’ Harry blushed to his roots and Draco thought it was one of the most adorable things he’d ever seen.
“You planned this all along didn’t you, you bastard!” Draco tried to be indignant, but he had a sudden turn of shyness and hid his face in Harry’s chest. Harry wrapped his arms around him and let himself descend into a fit of laughter, despite the situation.
She wasn’t looking at him. Instead she was looking at the solitary window on the wall to the right of the tapestry. It had no view except for a large sycamore tree whose branches obscured the streets behind the house. There was nothing but bare twigs now that autumn was paving the way for winter. Still, it gave her something to look at that wasn’t him.
He couldn’t find his own coat, so he stole Harry’s charcoal one. The collar was still turned up the way Harry liked it and Draco slunk into it as if it was a hug. It was far too large on him, the sleeves reaching to his knuckles, but it was too cosy not to steal. He checked the hot chocolate was still there before sending them ahead to the snug, so he didn’t have to worry about walking with them.
‘You don’t have to be religious to know history, Harry. I didn’t even celebrate Christmas remember? You’re not the only one though. Muggles used to think they were French kings. Tried to behead them during the French Revolution. Those statues aren’t the originals, they were replaced in the 19
Harry decided to take a quick shower and dress before calling Luna, the one friend he knew would definitely know what he should do. There was always Hagrid, but Harry didn't much feel like having a conversation with Hagrid about what to do with a wild fox, especially since Hagrid didn't have a good track record when it came to taking in strays.
‘I definitely don’t mind. Tell me about your day.’ He noticed that Harry had avoided ordering wine even though it was only Draco who wasn’t drinking. Things really had changed.
‘Is Draco still poorly?’ She asked Harry. Draco looked to him, interested to hear what he would say.
‘What did he say to you?’ He asked her. He didn’t look away from Hugo, choosing to watch his little fingers grip the edges of Draco’s coat. He probably should’ve taken it off, but he didn’t always notice temperature changes with his bad circulation.
He found Harry in the kitchen washing up glasses.
Draco got an especially long cuddle with Hugo who didn’t seem happy to settle with anyone else – he’d certainly changed his tune. He spent most of the afternoon and early evening with Hugo’s chubby hand curled into his jumper and little fingers wrapped around his pinkie. If anyone had asked, he’d have been totally ambivalent, but his insides were a puddle of goo the whole time. He’d forgotten how happy family made him.
“When was this?”
‘Come on. I’ll get you a hot chocolate and then we can go home.’
If only Harry had known then what he knows now. Hummus became the new marmite except this time, Draco put hummus on everything because he had become a complete hummus fiend. He used it on all the regular things Harry associated with hummus – carrot, celery, pitta bread, that kind of thing. But then things started to get weird.
‘I’m sure.’ Draco didn’t tell him he wasn’t going to be living there much longer, he wasn’t ready for another goodbye.
and the fox with the
“Give her some space, this is hard on her.”
And then there were Harry’s eyelashes. Long and thick and fluttering against the tops of his cheeks as dreamed. Harry had beautiful eyes even when they were closed, and Draco missed the way they used to look at him like he was the only thing in the world so much, that he could hardly look Harry in the eye at all now.
‘Anyway, I just came to see if the rumours about you leaving were true. I want you to know that I don’t agree with it but seeing as I’m not your mother, I won’t argue with you about it anymore.’
Draco decided to make himself some coffee, figuring he’d never be able to get back to sleep. He couldn’t believe he’d slipped up in front of Harry after all this time. Hopefully, their lack of communication would mean it would never come up again.
‘Listen, Harry, I-’
“What can we do? If the Ministry have his wand then we’re not going to be able to get it. And even if we could, I’m not allowed to leave the Manor unless it’s for something related to my non-existent case or my health. The latter wouldn’t even give me an excuse to go to the Ministry.” The theory, Draco could handle. In fact, he was rather excited about having a complex puzzle to solve. The practicalities, however. Well, he had always been the brains behind the operation.
‘And take one of your FUCKING POTIONS.’ Harry yelled. He slammed the second mug down on the counter so hard it cracked straight up the middle. Draco flinched.
‘I know, I know. You keep telling me that. Heck, I think I told you that too. We’re such a mess.’ Draco let his head fall into his hands. Harry’s hand on his shoulder made him jump slightly, but he relaxed.
As he went downstairs he remembered what it was like to have Potter’s bright green gaze on him when they had breakfast in the Great Hall, to be on the receiving end of Potter’s arrogant wit, the feeling that had shot up his arm when they’d both reached for the snitch at the same time during a match; Potter’s fingers always inching just that bit closer than Draco’s.
‘I’ll take little shit over Potter. You’re going to have to stop calling me that eventually, you know.’
, he always said.
Struck with a sudden idea, Harry opened the fridge. There wasn’t much in there because he was terrible at remembering to buy food and regularly ordered in, but there was some leftover chicken he hadn’t figured out what to do with. He had no idea what foxes ate, although he was certain a wild fox wouldn’t eat cooked meat, but he thought it was worth a try. Tearing the chicken into smaller pieces he fed a couple to the scared animal, which calmed down enough that it stopped growling at him, but it took a few attempts to get it to sniff out its temporary bed. Eventually it would stand in it, but it wouldn’t lie down. Harry decided that was good enough because his arms were really quite painful, and he needed to sleep himself.  He quickly covered the kitchen in cushioning charms, in case of any incidents through the night, and went to the bathroom to heal himself.
‘Come through.’ Harry said, his voice still slightly choked. Draco followed him numbly into their old kitchen. He sucked in a deep breath as a barrage of old memories hit him. Late nights fighting over who said what to whom, mid-morning brunches when the fed each other ridiculously sickly pastries and stayed in their pyjamas all day, family dinners and Christmases. It all seemed like a lifetime ago now, although it had only been three years. Harry’s hand on the small of Draco’s back did nothing to ease his apprehension as he stepped out the French doors and into the garden. Draco couldn’t contain his gasp when he saw it.
How had Draco forgotten that?
‘You’re a good man Draco, and you deserve to be happy. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, not even yourself.’ He kissed her cheek gently.
badge, the first snitch Harry ever caught, the invisibility cloak, the ring Harry had given him at Christmas that he’d handed right back again. His heard clenched painfully when he saw it.
‘Are these-?’
“Hey, Potter. POTTER!” Harry turned in the corridor on his way to Transfiguration. Draco was at the far end of the corridor, leaning languidly against the stone wall, his face cold and indifferent, as if he owned the place.
“It will all be alright you know. Granger’s bloody brilliant.” He said to her after she drank three cups of tea and spent five minutes staring down at her plate without eating so much as a morsel.
‘You sweet-talker,’ Harry teased, finally opening his eyes. Draco’s breath caught in his throat. He never got over how startlingly green Harry’s eyes were, as if they held the power of his magic for all to see. It used to be an old legend among muggles, men with shining eyes who could perform miracles. They believed it was a sign of divine power, and Draco was sure they were powerful wizards like his Harry. He’d never met anyone else whose eyes shone like that.
‘DRACO!’ She yelled with a lung capacity completely disproportionate to her small size. She launched herself at him and although he caught her expertly, she knocked the air he’d only just recovered right out of his chest.
Not trying to be rude, but completely forgetting the world around him, Draco arranges the Atwood books on the coffee table. His collection is only five of Atwood’s best, plus the new release he had signed, but he’s very proud of them.
‘I didn’t steal. I borrowed.’
‘Yes, and no. I’m not dying or anything.’ Draco got up from the stool and staggered over to the sofa. He was feeling light-headed and drained and he needed a better support. He sunk onto the soft cushions of the sofa and wondered how he’d managed to get himself into such a mess at such a young age. He felt like an old man on the inside.
“Yeah.”
Draco was laying there watching Harry sleep and pointedly ignoring quite how disgustingly ill he really felt. Something big must have happened for Harry to be here. He was in St Mungo’s too, which means whatever it was he’d been brought back to England for treatment. Harry had been here the whole time, here for Draco. Draco’s chest swelled, despite the pain, and he realised that no matter what shit had gone on between them, this was what mattered. Harry would be there. Even if he thought Draco hated him. He loved Draco as much as Draco loved him. It was a nice realisation, it made him feel like the decisions he’d made up until this point had all been worth it. He’d gotten better and he’d understood how he really felt.
They had been at a picnic on Hampstead Heath when Hermione had produced a pot of the beige gloop. The look of horror and disgust on Draco’s face at its appearance would be burned into Harry’s mind forever.
Draco felt a hell of a lot better about leaving his flat after that. He supposed it was because he had some sort of closure. He could leave knowing everything between him and Harry was out in the open, even if Draco didn’t want to pursue anything.
‘Go back where? Where am I?’ How was he supposed to choose when he didn’t know what he was choosing?
“I’m always right.”
The rush of warmth Draco felt when he stepped inside the chateau washed away the lingering anxiety and he relaxed completely. He walked through their main living room and noticed there was a pile of mail on the table. They hadn’t received much mail since they’d been in France – the majority of their friends appeared to be giving them the space to work out their shit. He was very appreciative of that, particularly since it seemed to be working.
‘He calls you Draco to your face because he thinks you wouldn’t like it if he tried to call you Daddy. Whenever you’re not around it’s “Daddy said this and Daddy that”, sometimes he calls you ‘other Dad’ – he thinks it’s funny.’ Draco didn’t know what to say.
‘Really?’ Harry looked as though he couldn’t say a word, he simply nodded furiously and covered his mouth with the back of his hand as is physically trying to hold back a sob. He hadn’t even realised how serious Harry had been taking it. They’d sat down and filled out all the forms of course, they’d had every background check imaginable, they’d been interviewed, they’d undergone house visits – the works. Draco had honestly thought it would be on the off-chance they might be approved, never fully expecting anyone would think him capable of looking after a child – even with Harry’s upstanding reputation.
‘Alright Malfoy? Glad to see you’re still in the land of the living.’ Was the greeting Bill had given him when he sat down. That was fine though, he appreciated the Weasley tactic of dealing with trauma through humour. It was an excellent choice.
Seeing Teddy to the floo was difficult. Draco had to fight to keep the tears at bay. He hated seeing his little boy disappear off to Scotland where he wouldn’t be there when he needed him. Everyone pretended like Hogwarts was one of the safest places in the wizarding world, but Draco had seen enough disasters in the walls of the castle to know better.
‘So, we were thinking about cutting about six inches off. What do you think?’ He glanced at Ella in the mirror in front of him where she was squirming with excitement and look at him hopefully with a broad smile on her face.
He ripped open a particularly thick cream envelope and after flicking his eyes over the first page, Draco noticed that his hands began to tremble. He set the hot chocolate down on the natural wood surface. They’d taken to occupying the small apartment at the top of the building when they came on their own, although they planned on having the entire family over for Christmas this year – Draco was very excited even if it was months away.
the time. There was no such thing as
‘Just tell me the truth,’ he said calmly. He bit his lip in anticipation of hearing something he really didn’t want to.
‘But I was going to make us breakfast.’ He let Harry turn him around in the gap between him and the counter and he hooked a finger under Draco’s chin, lifting his face so he was forced to look at him.
He stood under the shower unmoving. Shampoo dripped into his eyes and he winced but didn’t do anything about it.
‘I didn’t mean to. I just…missed you I guess. My favourite birthdays were the ones when I could wake up and have breakfast with you and Teddy and spend the whole day with you, just being a family. You know, feeling like a part of something.’ Harry’s eyes were trained on the floor as he spoke, and Draco was grateful because he wasn’t sure he could have this conversation otherwise. He felt guilt pull at him for taking that away from him, but what was he supposed to say? Harry had never come after him. In fact, Harry had purposefully blocked him out.
The Ministry had set up a tracking spell which was layered over the existing wards. It was linked to his magical signature and would directly alert the Aurors if he were to leave the premises without Ministry approval. To avoid tripping the tracker he would have to create a false signature inside the Manor and mask himself when he passed through. Polyjuice would prevent him from being noticed, but it wouldn’t strip his magic.
“It’s ok. I mean, you’ve done more in one afternoon than I’ve managed in two weeks so I shouldn’t complain.” By now the sun is starting to set and Harry realises he never informed the office that he would be gone so long. The clock on the far wall is about to strike six and he realises it’s too late to send a patronus now anyway.
‘I see. So our relationship is reduced to a business negotiation. I knew you’d moved on, but this really is something else. I’ll make sure you don’t have to see me around the department then.’ Draco was speechless. How was it that every time he attempted to be near Harry, things descended into absolute chaos? It was really bloody tiring.
and, not for the first time, felt disgusted at the principles his family had stood for over hundreds of years.
“You’re right. It’s just, it’s difficult to put it into words.” Harry drained the last of his tea while he formulated the best way into what he was about to say. He didn’t want Lyra to fly off the handle when he implied there was another version of her out there, a twin maybe, or another cousin no one knew about. Both were more plausible than his initial thought, but it still wasn’t something he expected her to take lightly.
‘Exactly, Harry! Each of them were sedated when they were admitted into St Mungo’s to slow the effects of the aconite. We wouldn’t have found anything unusual about seeing valerian in the samples because the healers had given them doses of it themselves!’
The figure stood in the doorway looking down at Draco. His eyes struggled to adjust from the pitch black to the bright light coming from behind the door, so it wasn’t possible for him to see the person’s face. The smell of star anise was stronger around them and Draco trusted the instinctive familiarity. It was a hard-fought battle between his animal instinct and his human equivalent, but he did his best to show that he wasn’t a threat by brushing himself against the person’s legs in a way he hoped seemed affectionate. How degrading.
could read his mind, the fox turned and looked at him, narrowing
As he waited a couple of minutes for the potions to take effect, he walked through the apartment and replenished his warming charms. A more skilled wizard than Draco would’ve been able to weave warming charms into to the apartment walls themselves, but Draco only knew how to replenish old charms. He could pay someone to do it for him, but since he’d effectively given Pansy and Blaise free run of furnishing the chateau when it was ready, he didn’t think he should be too frivolous with his galleons. Plus, walking around helped aid the blood flow to his extremities. He staunchly refused to think about what Hermione had just told him.
Blinking into the blaring sunlight until his eyes adjusted, he glanced around to find no sign of the silver fox anywhere in the room besides the bed he had transfigured the night before, which was crumpled and covered in white hairs. It was mercifully intact, unlike the curtains, which was a significant relief.
Whatever it was that Granger wanted to say to him, it was evidently off the record. She was sat primly on one of the overfilled sofas wearing a white turtleneck jumper and dark tailored trousers. Unlike her usual bushy mane of hair, her curls were sleek and pinned in a loose fashion away from her face. It gave the overall impression that she was planning on going somewhere. Part of him hoped she wasn’t feeling pressure by Pansy to look like a Parisian model. Heaven knew Pansy spent far too much time preening, and that was saying something coming from Draco.
‘What utter rot.’ Draco rolled his eyes, ‘if I stop calling you Potter everyone will think I’ve gone mad. Besides, who said anything about marrying you?’ He watched as Harry’s face dropped into mock-horror.
It’s not really his place to say, and he knows that Harry has managed fine so far with doing as little reading as he can get away with, but Draco has had a sneaking suspicion for a while now that Harry’s reading troubles might be caused by dyslexia. Far from being an expert on such things, Draco has kept his mouth shut.
His first attempt collapsed instantly, and he realised too late when he glared at Harry’s sniggering and found a camera in his face that he hadn’t hidden it away well enough.
January? It was Boxing Day last time he checked.
When he stepped out the front doors, he was hit with a wall of heat completely uncharacteristic of Scotland. There were clusters of students taking shelter around the edges of the courtyard but beyond that the sprawling grass was still relatively quiet. He walked across the sloping green down to the lake and around the edge to the far side. There he sat near a large weeping willow, not to be confused with its whomping cousin. He sat just beyond the reaches of the tree’s branches so that he could feel the sun on his face. Draco wasn’t there yet, so Harry prepared himself to wait.
The silence between them was getting awkward. Things hadn’t exactly slotted back into place when Draco had moved back. They were clumsy around each other, unsure even. Of course they cared about each other, but it was difficult to ignore the changes they’d been through over the years.
young.” Sirius suggested.  Harry nodded and tried to coax Aspen out from under the table, but it proved difficult. He was shaking all over again and whining loudly whenever Harry tried to manoeuvre him.
He watched on anxiously as Harry paced, his hand gestures getting more frenetic and his hair getting messier each time his fingers ran through it. Surely, he wouldn’t let himself get this irate over Wood?
‘You’re kidding.’ Hermione flushed in embarrassment at Draco’s surprise.
“You’re right. I’m sorry I haven’t seen you in a while. It’s been so busy with him landing on the doorstep,” Harry explained.
That was where he had seen them before. Aspen, Lyra, and Draco all had the same shade of silver-grey eyes. How had he never noticed that before? His heart was in his throat as four faces loomed above his head and the fox sat whining on his lap. What was supposed to happen now?
‘Is everything ok? You’d tell me, wouldn’t you, if it wasn’t?’ Teddy didn’t say anything, just hugged him tighter. He put the plate on the draining board and tried his hands on a tea towel, so he could hug him back. He glanced behind him to see Harry pointing to the hallway.
He caught her just before she disappeared. “Oh, Granger.” She turned. “Next time your girlfriend tries to send me a gift, tell her I prefer chocolate.” Granger tried to scowl at him but couldn’t quite mask her smile.
The poor little fox had got itself tangled in the curtain and was scratching at the side of the bath trying to extricate itself. It had been silent until Harry tried to prise away the curtain, then it promptly started screaming at him.
He cards his fingers through Draco’s messy hair. It always calms him down when Harry does this, although he’s not sure anything he does will be enough this time.
in particular was prone to report. It was probably nothing.
The iciness in her voice was enough to turn even the weather jar cold.
‘This might well be the most awkward thing that’s ever happened to me.’ Draco admitted. Harry finally let go and wandered over to the kitchen and put the kettle on. Most likely just for something to do. ‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for this to happen.’ Draco said. They’d come to a tentative truce the day before and Draco didn’t want it to be ruined. Harry sighed deeply, and his shoulders slumped as he leant against the bench.
‘So you did do it. Did you fuck him? Did you? Have you been disappearing off all this time, laughing behind my back? The idiot stuck at home dependent on you for everything whilst you swan about with other men? Hm?’
“Granger I’m not leaving here without you.”
‘’m fine.’ He mumbled into Harry’s chest. He sighed deeply and tried to let go of the anxiety itching his skin.
‘I wouldn’t dream of blowing off my hot date!’ He joked. He really had been feeling much better since he’d had his little chat with Kingsley and he figured humour would work as a good distraction from the conversation he didn’t really want to have.
He felt himself slipping away as their eyes locked and he got a last glimpse of his favourite green eyes.
‘What is it?’ He said cautiously.
‘How are you feeling?’ She pressed the back of her hand to his forehead as though he was a child with a cold. It was sweet really, although a completely pointless gesture.
It took him the first five days to detangle the wards surrounding the chateau. His father had been careful to hold onto the less well known of the family properties, which was probably a wise decision as they’d be less traceable. Draco had never been to this one, and he could tell by the confused state of the wards that no one had been there in his parents’ lifetime either. As far as he could tell, the house didn’t recognise the Black blood in him and wouldn’t let him through. It wasn’t the end of the world, as he was still a Malfoy and he could reset the wards, but it was complicated and tiresome magic and he only had the strength to break through one ward a day.
Harry’s look of disbelief melts into a charming smile. “Nothing. It’s just that that was the first ever Gryffindor password in first year.”
“I’m sorry.”
He couldn’t remember a thing from the night before. He’d been at a muggle club. Ok, he’d never slept with a muggle before, so it couldn’t have been a one night stand repeated. He’d gone out with Pansy. That meant that he’d probably gone to a club he’d never been to either. He’d been to a muggle club before but been too afraid to sleep with a muggle in case in his drunken haze he slipped up and used some form of magic. He couldn’t figure out what was bugging him about the whole thing.
When they were almost done, Gabriel returned. ‘Ah mes amis, ce sont fantastiques! Maintenant, ze last part is to top zem avec le fondant. Alors, I will show you.’ He poured alternate stripes of white icing and chocolate and combed it together in a complex pattern. Harry looked bewildered but this was the one part Draco’s grandmother had let him do when she made them, so he was really quite excited.
He wasn’t feeling any ill effects of standing in the room so he decided to take his leave while he still could. The floor creaked as he came down the stairs, alerting anyone downstairs of his approach. For the first time he wondered whether Ron was still here, but surely he would have gone home by now.
‘The tree is up! With all my stupid old decorations! It’s better when he’s home.’ Teddy said it like it was the most obvious thing in the world, but Draco noticed. Teddy thought of this place as home. Their home – all three of them together. Had he really been so blind this whole time? How different things might have been if Draco hadn’t been so stubborn. Then again, Harry hadn’t left him much option with all his stalking and his excessive anger.
When Draco’s fish arrived, he could’ve melted into the floor. Harry had been really bloody boring and ordered the most ridiculously poncy satay chicken Draco had ever seen. He had no imagination, and Draco told him as much. They kept conversation light for the most part, avoiding anything that may cause the argument they’d had the last time they’d tried to come here. Draco felt happy. Really, genuinely happy. Harry’s smile was warm and his conversation interesting. He held Draco’s hand across the table multiple times throughout the course of the evening, and Draco was beginning to feel like he had when they’d been dating.
Draco knew he was clock watching. Every five minutes felt like some kind of purgatory and he was sure he’d read the same set of results three times and he still had no idea what they meant. He’d sent a couple of the pills down to the labs because apparently there was a muggleborn downstairs who’d had proper muggle lab experience. Draco had to admit he was relieved. It wasn’t that he wasn’t capable of doing it himself, but he’d been in complete turmoil over his behaviour with Harry and he really couldn’t focus on anything.
‘It isn’t when you’ve had your magical core completely detached from your body.’
The envelope was much heavier than he expected, although the letter was written on the same thick cream paper that Draco himself used. Used to use. His fingers already left dirty prints over the pages and he realised that this was the kind of dirt he might never be rid of again. It was from a
‘Piss off Potter. Don’t you dare pretend like you care.’ Draco stormed out of the conference room and disapparated. Forget the bloody floo, he didn’t care about social decorum around that waste of space.
“A name?” Harry’s heart was pounding. He couldn’t name his fox; he was already way too attached as it was. If she wanted him to name him…did that mean he could keep him? He was almost too scared to ask.
He didn’t really know what to do with himself – a common theme since the incident as it had become known. Harry had gone back to work three weeks after he’d brought Draco home, when his condition had stabilised. It had bizarrely been easier for Draco not having him around all hours of the day. Moving back into the house was a big deal and he’d needed some time to settle whilst also coming to grips with his condition. He hated calling it that, but he hadn’t been able to come up with a better term. Lifestyle, maybe? That seemed a bit too permanent. He refused to believe it was permanent.
Draco felt as though he’d been dumped head first into an icy plunge pool. A chill spread through every inch of his body and a tight knot formed in his sternum which somehow managed to make him feel sick and unable to breath at the same time.
‘Harry don’t. Please. You always fix it.’ He could feel tears welling up in his eyes but he wasn’t able to cry. Smith gripped Harry by the shoulder – his jumper crumpling under his hand.
At least he had intended to. Except, when their lips met and Harry’s were so dry they were almost cracked, Draco was reminded of how many hours he’d spent outside in the grounds after Draco had yelled at him. In an instant the kiss became gentle, tender even. Barely more than the softest brush of lips, as though Draco could heal each crack himself if he tried hard enough. Harry’s fingers threaded through Draco’s hair because the smug git knew he was the only person on the planet allowed to touch Draco’s hair. They’d kissed a thousand times before but this, this was different. It felt like coming home after such a long, long time.
“We just have to open the doors until we find the right one,” she said. She stepped forward and opened the door dead ahead of them. There was a glowing red light inside and what looked like hundreds of tiny yellow eyes staring at them. She shut the door again quickly. Draco tried the door to his left and only opened it a crack before he realised it was full of large water tanks with wiggling tentacles in it. Whatever they were, he wasn’t about to find out.
Potter was not part of his five-year plan.
‘What?’
Harry smiled at him. ‘I ordered you the seabass and edamame, I hope you don’t mind. I figured you needed a minute.’ For a moment he was overcome with love for the man sitting opposite him, looking like a model.
The lull was the time for him to tell her about what he really came for, but it was also hard for him to explain it when he wasn’t entirely sure what he wanted. She went back to her guitar, playing chords quietly while he thought.
‘There’s a new muggle place down-’
‘So, you like your house, and I know you like your classes…except Madam Hooch…what else is there?’ Draco probed. Teddy pushed his food around his plate a little, and Draco was convinced this was it. He didn’t dare look at Harry again, just in case he saw his own worry reflected back at him.
“Don’t you want to… uh, sit down? You know, the hummus isn’t going to disappear if you take your time to eat it.” Harry had always been funny about when and where he ate food. He wasn’t exactly sure why, but he always had to eat at a table.
The man, Draco had already forgotten his name, was leaving an indecent amount of lovebites all over his neck and collar and whilst Draco had always found it horrifically tacky, he secretly revelled in the idea of showing up to work tomorrow and parading his marked skin in front of Harry. A sober Draco would’ve felt like a pathetic little worm for thinking such manipulative things, but drunk Draco had no such qualms. He pulled the stranger close to him and didn’t object when he felt his hands groping at his arse. If getting laid was what Pansy wanted him to do, then that’s exactly what he would do.
They searched meticulously through the seventeenth-century section. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack but whenever Draco glanced over at Granger and saw the look of determined concentration on her face, he couldn’t help but redouble his efforts.
“That’s not why you came here.” She looked desperate to change the subject and began fiddling with the strings on her guitar. He liked that when she was nervous, she needed to keep her hands occupied. He’d never noticed that before.
It was taken not long after his small stint in Azkaban. He could tell because he looked painfully thin; his cheeks sunken and his skin almost translucent, even his hair was dull and dry.
Granger looked as if she was going to say something sentimental but a glare from him had her changing directions.
Draco laughed. ‘Busy day then? Oh, I bet she’s the cutest angel. Muggles take photos at those kinds of things, right?’ He wasn’t really aware of nativity plays and the like until this year when some of the oldest kids started getting excited about it. He’d thought it was sweet, until he’d heard from some of the other staff who had their own kids that there was a mad rush to get costumes sorted, and one poor woman’s son was a lobster in his nativity. A lobster? Were there lobsters at the birth of Jesus? It didn’t compel Draco to open a Bible that’s for sure.
didn’t go to the Ministry at all?”
He watched as Teddy’s hair turned a deep ebony shade and he glanced around to see Harry crossing the law towards Draco, a beaming smile on his face as he saw Teddy wander off to the sandpit they’d built him – that really he was a little old to be using – and nearly fall headfirst into it. He’d heard Teddy’s mother had been incredibly clumsy and it wouldn’t surprise him if Teddy was just the same. He didn’t like to think about that though, Teddy was his little wolf now. He didn’t want to admit that Teddy wasn’t really his. It was so easy to forget when he could change his appearance so easily.
‘I’m sure it’s only temporary, darling. You magic is unsettled after all. It’s good though, it means your it’s working again.’ He assumed no one had told Pansy that he’d already known he could do magic before he’d put himself here in the first place – maybe that’s why she wasn’t shouting at him.
“Where did you learn all of this?” Harry asks him. They certainly never learnt any of it at Hogwarts, which seems like a bit of an oversight now that he thinks about it.
‘Do you ever wonder what it would’ve been like if we’d worked out.’ Harry asked him, lifting his head to look at him. There were slight crinkles beginning to form around his eyes – the barest hint that he was quickly approaching his thirties. Draco thought they were almost more beautiful than any other part of Harry and he couldn’t quite explain why.
‘What?’
“Maybe something,” he said uncertainly, “but there’s still the last part.” He couldn’t stand the anguish written all over her. He wanted this to go perfectly but the chances were so small he had tried hard not to get his hopes up – he wondered if Granger had bothered doing the same…
Thankfully, Luna was happy to have Teddy for a couple of days and Teddy was more than happy to have a sleepover. It gave Draco the time he needed to get his affairs in order. Unfortunately for him, the day of his bank meeting started badly.
‘There’s a couple. They want to proceed with the adoption process. It’s early, really early, they’ve only just been approved as suitable parents and they’ve only met her once. I just- I know how much she means to you and I wanted to give you time to accept it.’ If the bottom hadn’t fallen out of Draco’s world yet, it certainly had now. He didn’t know why, it had always been on the cards, she was a bright and beautiful little girl. Who wouldn’t want to love her?
‘Do you think this may be part of the reason why you struggle to communicate in your marriage?’ Draco’s heart nearly beat out of his chest.
When they arrived at Draco’s flat, Draco dropped the act. Apparently so did Teddy, who flung himself down on Draco’s sofa in a way that imitated Pansy so much that Draco nearly panicked.
He took his time in the shower, allowing the hot water to warm his bones. He had never been more grateful for shampoo in his life. His was mixed especially for him after a ridiculously expensive consultation with a fancy London stylist. Looking at the minimalist bottle now, it felt frivolous and stupid.
‘Honestly, Draco. What did you think happened? Only you could move 500 miles away from home and take your work with you.’
‘Any respectable wizard knows one never uses magic to pour wine as magic messes with the viscosity.’
‘Nothing’s wrong. Before I do this, there’s just one thing I need to know.’
‘You’re right, I’m sorry.’ Harry took a step back and Draco lowered his wand. The Ministry was beginning to fill with people and they didn’t have the privacy Harry apparently wanted. He motioned Draco into an empty conference room and Draco didn’t have the energy to argue.
him? Had he broken up with Wood at all? He and Harry hadn’t exactly gotten back together anyway, it had sort of just…happened. His head was starting to hurt with all the questions.
‘You’re my daddy and I love you and some people don’t like you and that’s ok because no one has to like everyone, but I do like you and I should tell you more often because that’s what you do when you love people.’ Draco thought he’d been heartbroken when he’d gotten divorced. He was wrong.
Before he could figure out what was happening, Potter’s hands were all over him. He was all of a quiver as he felt the strength in Potter’s arms, until he suffered the indignity of Potter’s arm between his legs. Almost choking on his own tongue, he began to protest at such over familiarity:
‘Leggy-Blonde? How jealous were you, Draco?’ Harry smirked. Draco flushed but he refused to be intimidated.
Sirius looked a bit bemused. “Oh?” It was then that Harry realised he hadn’t lifted the disillusionment charm yet. He pulled his wand out and aimed it at Aspen with great difficulty, as he was zigzagging down the hallway at great speed. While he had his wand out, he pulled his sleeve up and inspected the bite Aspen had given him. It hurt but he was right that it hadn’t drawn blood, so he put his wand away and made a mental note to find some salve later.
‘I suppose. Are you sure that’s wise?’ Harry shrugged his shoulders and Draco couldn’t be bothered to push the subject. He led Harry up the winding staircase, nodding politely to the numerous portraits of ancestors he’d become acquainted with during the restoration. They eyed Harry curiously, some turning their noses up in disdain, but the majority smirking or nodding their approval. Their reactions had Harry blushing to his roots and Draco absolutely did not find it adorable. He’d have thought Harry would be used to people staring at him by now, but it seemed he would never be accustomed to being an icon.
It’s also quite new to him to be allowed to take genuine pride in what he has achieved. Although he used to boast a lot when he was younger, it was always about things he had been given, or things his father had done that he thought were great. Until he started dating Harry, it never occurred to him to take pride in himself as a person.
“Yeah?”
Draco decided that he would make the most of having Teddy this weekend because he wasn’t sure when he would get the opportunity to do it again. He’d take him for ice cream at Fortescue’s and he’d let him get whatever he wanted at Quality Quidditch Supplies. Fuck the rules, if his son wanted a broom in his first year, he’d have a damn broom. Draco would just be careful to make sure he didn’t boast about it. He was sure Teddy would be sorted into Hufflepuff; he was so kind and giving and loyal there was no way he would ever hurt a fly. Draco found he didn’t much care what house Teddy was in, so long as he was happy. He was sure Harry had already talked to him about that, but if Teddy brought it up at any point over the weekend, he’d make sure he knew that Draco would love him no matter what happened.
‘It’s very relevant, but if you don’t want to talk about it yet then we won’t. Tell me about something else. Tell me about your father.’ This guy wasn’t about to give up any time soon. Draco supposed he should throw him a bone.
‘That’s excellent news, congratulations. Harry, can I talk to you for a minute?’
Harry was the first the break the kiss and Draco actually whined in protest. Harry’s smirk was every inch the cocky bastard Draco remembered from school and he realised how little he’d seen Harry smile recently. How had he never noticed until now?
Harry’s face was flushed with embarrassment when they parted – Draco had been right. Coming back to himself, he looked around the room and found Teddy studiously examining another pile of presents and pretending he hadn’t seen a thing. Bless his heart of gold.
‘Don’t you dare spoil this for me, Potter!’ Harry looked sheepish and Draco stood there feeling like a third wheel.
liked this guy. ‘But I’m willing to let Mr Potter apparate you home, Mr Potter.’ Draco could hear sentences like that all day and never get tired of it. ‘You just need to sign the discharge forms.’
he whispered to himself.
‘You know what I’m like when I’m drunk Draco, and this isn’t it.’ Harry skimmed a thumb over Draco’s left cheek and it was as if time stood still. He couldn’t see straight, he couldn’t think straight. He didn’t move a muscle but that didn’t seem to bother Harry. He looked him straight in the eye as if daring Draco to stop him, but Draco couldn’t. There was a part of him who desperately wanted this to happen. It was the part that told everyone he was fine and moving on and ready to start a new life in Paris.
‘Really? You hate those kinds of films.’ He’d never admit it, but Harry loved the silly Christmas films like
He’d taken too long to watch her, and a spell caught his ear. It stung but he tried to ignore it, scanning his surroundings for a way out. His heart hammered inside his ribcage and he was losing his grip on Potter’s wand. He ducked to avoid a spell aimed at his head but moved right into the path of another instead. It hit him square on the chest and that’s when everything changed.
‘You can’t tell anyone this, the Ministry is trying to keep it quiet, but you remember Kingsley’s secretary?’ Draco thought about it. He remembered the young woman who couldn’t tell her arse from her elbow who’d been in place when he’d worked here.
‘It’s ok Draco. I understand. We’ll get through this.’
Harry’s eyes flicked nervously around them. The street was actually quite busy, but Draco could see anything beyond Harry. ‘Maybe. Mostly I just wanted to know you were safe. At first, Hermione didn’t tell me how long you’d been planning on going or what you were going to do here. I didn’t know if- if being around me was really so bad that you’d move across the Channel.’ He wasn’t exactly wrong, was he?
Draco was exhausted. The only thing to do in his cell was sleep – if he didn’t want to think about Potter – but he hadn’t realised that sleeping too long would only make him more tired than he was when he started. He’d missed his chances to eat, having been conveniently asleep any time food had been put in his cell; the food congealed and inedible by the time he woke up, assuming it was ever edible in the first place. The detached resignation he had arrived with had bled away as his hunger crept in, and he was in a full-blown rage by the time his first visitor arrived – who wasn’t who he expected at all.
‘I’m ok. I just had an odd dream about this place while I- when I was in the hospital again.’ He really had forgotten about it until yesterday, it wasn’t as though he was trying to hide it from Harry.
‘Monsieur Verne.’ Harry greeted him politely and the gears in Draco’s mind started whirring. Pâtisserie Jules…Monsieur Verne…
‘We’re so close to this place…it’s only a few streets over…I’d like to show you it. And then, maybe we could go to Notre Dame? It’s such a tourist thing to do but I haven’t been in so long and-’
‘Ew. That’s disgusting. Why did you have to go and ruin it?’ Teddy scrunched his face up and stuck his tongue out with revulsion. Draco nearly fell over with unexpected laughter.
“You understand the charges?” The girl asked him with a squeaky voice. In all honesty it didn't much matter to Draco what the charges were.
“There’s not Draco Malfoy,” she said, her eyes boring into his own, “just me.” She said it in the most un-Malfoy-like way he had ever heard her say anything. With an openness which verged on vulnerability. Suddenly he realised that her standoffishness wasn’t born out of dislike anymore, but fear.
Draco shrugged. ‘I have circulation issues.’ He paused for a second before calling for Spungen.
‘Teddy, you know that just because you’re going to Hogwarts soon, doesn’t mean that you can’t talk to me all the time. We’re all just an owl away. Harry will love sending you owls, he never got very many when he was at school.’ Draco remembered how Harry’s eyes would light up whenever he got an owl. Of course, Draco had hated him back then and he was obviously only watching him to make sure his mail wasn’t plotting Draco’s demise.
‘Why am I getting this?’ Draco asked the intern who brought the file to him.
‘It’s not like that, you know it isn’t.’ He brushed a thumb across Draco’s cheek, the look on his face begging for Draco to believe him, but he couldn’t.
“Thank you, Potter. It’s good to know that a thousand years of my family’s collection is up to your impeccable standards.” Harry doesn’t know why Malfoy has to be so acerbic all the time, but he can’t afford to let this opportunity pass.
‘This isn’t what I wanted for Teddy. He’s already had one set of parents taken from him, he doesn’t need another. I dread to think what would have happened if anything had happened to Molly and Arthur, and I don’t think we’ve been fooling Teddy.’
‘Hey, leave that, I have a better idea.’ Harry stood behind him and took the batter and the spoon from Draco’s hands.
‘Hm?’
that was knocking around inside his skull also seemed to repel him, as if the name was a carefully guarded secret. It left his head thick and soupy, like he’d opened a door for something that could never go back again.
“And you think this has something to do with that fox?” Sirius asked him. Harry nodded.
‘DRACO!’ Teddy launched himself at Draco.
‘May I…’ He handed it over to Harry who flicked it quickly and levitated his pen from the desk surface. ‘I just wanted to check it still worked. Not that it wouldn’t but, I didn’t know if you were avoiding it for a reason.’ He twirled the wand in his fingers like it belonged there. ‘It’s funny how once you’ve mastered a wand it’s always familiar to you. I wish I’d asked Ollivander more about wandwork when I had the chance.’
“Bloody hell, Harry. Can’t you shut him up with something? Silencing spell? Literally anything!” Ron grumbled every morning at the breakfast table. Harry wasn’t much of a morning person, but Ron was even less so.
‘Good surprise?’ Harry asked him. He nodded.
But it’s not just the research that’s causing Harry discomfort. Malfoy’s head is bent impossibly close to his own as he pores over thick Latin script. Whenever Harry glances over at the pages before Malfoy, he notices that there are as many letters written in superscript above the main text as there are in the actual words themselves.
Suddenly the crack of light burst open, flooding the darkened hallway with yellow light. Another figure appeared next to the first one. By then Draco’s vision had adjusted to the light and he could see a mop of brilliant red hair. His heart sank.
“Oh what a lovely idea, Lyra!”
‘Yes, Minister. I was just explaining to Head Auror Potter that we should be able to revive the patients in St Mungo’s.’ Draco said, although his mind was still with whatever it was that Harry was trying to say to him before they were interrupted. Did he regret the kiss? Was he about to forgive Draco for running off?
He was making breakfast the muggle way. He’d woken up in the early hours having been plagued by another nightmare. They’d started after their little talk and he could only assume he’d unleashed some other monstrosity on himself. It was probably why he was so unfocused and made the batter far too thin. He reached up for a glass jar of flour he’d found on one of the shelves when his left arm went completely numb. Naturally, he dropped the jar and had flour all down his clothes and in his hair. Of course, that had to be the moment Harry walked in.
‘Well, we never really discussed our relationship like that. We made it clear to each other that we both still had feelings, and after a while we started behaving a lot like we had when we were together, and it just sort of…fell back into how it was before. I thought maybe if I hadn’t said that I was in it for the long run that maybe he didn’t think it counted…’ Smith was nodding vigorously and scribbling away in the notepad. Draco wasn’t even sure if he was listening properly.
He ran a hand through Harry’s hair and marvelled at how soft it always was despite looking coarse and messy all the time. He’d always loved playing with Harry’s hair when they’d been together, both in and out of the bedroom. They’d lounge on their sofa many an evening, Harry with his head in Draco’s lap as Draco carded long fingers through the raven strands. The ache in Draco’s chest grew.
‘I think you should all step away. I’d have thought your training would teach you not to overwhelm her any more than she already is.’ The group looked at him but didn’t move. ‘Go. Now.’ He demanded. Susan’s gaze flicked wearily between Draco and Harry. He knew Harry was much more of an authority figure than he was, but it still stung a little that she didn’t trust him - Ella had asked for him personally after all. Harry gave a small nod and Susan stepped away from the blue painted door. The others appeared to follow her lead until there was only the three of them left. He put Johnny back down on the floor.
‘Wow.’ Harry stopped in his tracks to look at the structure, although Draco knew the outside wasn’t a patch on the inside. It was a pavilion of sorts – a cross between a greenhouse and an outhouse. It was a later addition to the grounds, perhaps nineteenth
“Granger.”
‘Yes,’ Draco said tightly. ‘The Malfoy line ends with me.’ He had never much cared about being the end of his family line, not after he saw what obsession with blood purity and magical families could do, but he had to admit that it was sad that a place as beautiful as this didn’t have a family to own it. He could of course marry again and start his own family, but the magic in houses such as this thrived on the blood of those who built it. ‘Spungen?’ Draco asked.
‘I-I- I don’t know what to say,’ he rasped. He took the ring from the box and with some difficulty due to the tears blurring his vision he could just make out an infinity symbol engraved on one side. As he turned the ring over, he noticed on the inside of the band the date
‘No.’ He pulled him off him. ‘You can have all the hugs in the world, if that’s what you want, but you have to tell me first.’ Teddy pouted but nodded.
‘Anyway, after you left I started to feel like I wasn’t actually doing any good out there. I’d come home from work feeling like something was missing. Completing cases didn’t have the same satisfaction anymore. Hermione suggested writing in a journal, but I couldn’t keep it up. One day when I was out for beers with the guys, Dean was talking about an old manor house that was going up for sale in a muggle auction. He was complaining about how whoever bought it would probably tear it down and it was such a waste of the architecture or something. I don’t know, all that stuff is more your thing.’ Draco didn’t know what to say, so he tried to keep his mouth shut.
‘I was under the impression it was Harry you didn’t want to talk about, not your relationship.’
‘Draco, darling, I thought you’d never ask.’
“Sirius,” Lyra started carefully while Harry was still trying to figure out the tapestry, “aren’t you lonely in this house?” In the corner of his eye he could see Sirius tense.
“I don’t presume to know what it’s like to be you,” Malfoy began carefully, “but I do know that you should think very carefully about what you do have before you go chasing after something you don’t. You might be surprised to find that the grass isn’t always greener.”
‘Thank you Draco, that was the best Christmas present ever!’ She hugged him tightly, effectively binding his legs together since she was so small. He could do little else put to pat the top of her head awkwardly since he needed at least one arm to keep his balance.
Being under house arrest, Draco had been mostly shielded from the fallout of Potter’s disappearance. He of course knew that it was splattered all over every newspaper from here to the Mediterranean, but he’d had no real concept of the level of conspiracy which had been stirred up by wizarding media. For the third time in a month, he’d been caught out by a nasty conjunctivitis curse trapped inside a cleverly disguised letter which Draco could have sworn had been written in his mother’s hand. It wasn’t nearly as bad as the ear-shrivelling curse, but unpleasant, nonetheless.
He let go of Harry and stepped towards the pensieve. He could hear echoes of the memory as it swam before him and it didn’t sound all that pleasant. He didn’t want to look at Harry before he delved in, so he didn’t.
Maybe he just wasn’t capable of becoming and animagus. He stood there in the middle of the storm for more than forty-five minutes hoping that something would happen. When it didn’t, he decided to go back to bed and salvage some sleep before the dawn came. He cold and empty inside. All these months under house arrest and the one productive thing he had done had come to nothing. What a waste.
Draco was horrified. ‘Harry!’
He didn’t want to see the weather jar run out when there was no one there to enjoy it, so he located the lid under a pile of books and screwed it back on. By the time he had done so she had disappeared. He found her again in the kitchen, standing near a hardback book open somewhere near the middle, a thin wooden bookmark with an owl on it sticking up where it was wedged between pages.
“Harry! It’s ok, calm down. You fell asleep!” Someone had removed his glasses and all he could see were blurry blocks of colour breaking through the pitch black, but he could still make out Lyra’s voice. He squinted, although it made little difference, and discovered he was no longer in the room with the tapestry. Relief flooded through him like an icy cold river and his head thumped back down onto the pillow beneath him. As his eyes adjusted to the dark it became clear he had been moved to Regulus’ room. He scrambled for his glasses and found them being pressed into his hand.
‘And here I thought he was too cool for hugs.’ Harry said with an amused smirk as he reappeared and crossed the garden and handed Draco some water. He might’ve got a bit too tipsy earlier and under the hot summer sun Harry had started supplying him with water sometime after dinner.
Harry waited patiently. “You can talk to me, you know. We’re friends, right? I won’t judge you.” Draco sat up and looked at him sharply. His grey eyes glittering, his hair shining so blond it was almost white. He looked ethereal like that, as if the sun that broke through the willow branches was lighting him up like a beacon so that Harry couldn’t look away even if he wanted to. Up this close Harry could see the dusting of freckles across Draco’s cheeks and nose and he desperately wanted to touch them.
They’d agreed that they’d grow Narcissus and Lily in their garden, as an ode to their mothers, without whom their garden would never exist. Except it turned out that Draco was allergic to lilies, so they’d agreed to put in Pineapple Lilies, a native South African flower instead, as the variety was just different enough from English lilies to not bother Draco. Thankfully, with the use of weather charms, they could grow any plant they wanted.
“The roses. The yellow roses you said just last week were the worst kind of roses because yellow flowers are what you take your sick grandma in hospital.” Granger looked to Draco for help, but he refused to get involved. He’d barely had any sleep and now wasn’t the time for arguments.
‘No one can help me,’ he choked. ‘I can’t do it… I can’t… It won’t work… and unless I do it soon, he says he’ll kill them.’ He sobbed into the sink, hardly able to breathe, gulping in air as best he could. He shuddered with the overwhelming feeling of doom consuming him from the inside out. He steeled himself, finally looking up into the mirror and found Potter staring at him in the reflection.
‘YES!’ She yelled, and the connection closed.
‘Oh, Ted. You make me laugh.’ Harry mused.
‘I’m sorry!’ She wailed. He pulled her back against his chest and let her cry it out. He could feel her tears soaking through his clothes, but he knew once she’d got it out of her system she’d probably be fine. A few minutes later, Susan knocked on the open door. She was clever, not crossing the threshold and respecting Ella’s boundaries.
‘Daddy, that’s an opinion.’ Teddy said it with such serious seriousness that Draco couldn’t help but burst out laughing. An elderly witch turned to look, and her face fell into a scowl when she realised who he was. It was weird really, Draco was almost as famous as Harry now, except he was famous for the wrong reasons. He still found it odd that people recognised him, let alone old ladies who may or may not have been born a century before him. This woman certainly looked like she could’ve been. Sorry not sorry.
“And other people who also read books…”
‘You know what? Fuck it. Let’s go.’ He said decisively.
‘Now then, lunch will be ready soon, why don’t you rope Ronald in and make sure everyone has a drink and is seated at the table. You’ve all got your own little place cards.’ Draco did as he was told and was grateful for Ron since without his magic he’d have had a nightmare trying to carry drinks and glasses from the kitchen without a little extra help. Thankfully there were magically refilling jugs. On one of his trips back from the tent, Hermione pressed a glass of wine into his hand and winked at him conspiratorially since he wasn’t really supposed to be drinking. Naturally, he downed it in one and picked up another.
Draco could feel the warmth of his breath across his cheek and could smell the same aftershave he’d been wearing on his birthday, this time mixed with the oversweet tea Harry liked to drink. Draco told himself it didn’t affect him, but the fuzzy feeling in his stomach and the slight wobble in his breath said otherwise.
‘If you calm down, I promise I’ll get him for you. Stop worrying about them and think of yourself. You can’t do anything from here. You need to get better first.’ He wasn’t listening to anything she said. He had to see Harry.
‘Draco…’ Harry edged towards him, his feat crunching on top of the mess on the floor. He stayed very still, wondering what Harry thought he was going to do.
‘Yeah, yeah. I’m not good at packing. He made it there and back in one piece, didn’t he? I consider that an achievement.’ He nodded towards Teddy who was now rolling his eyes in a fond and all too familiar movement. They tucked into their food and Draco was, for once, filled with confidence that things would turn out just fine.
‘Do you feel anything?’ Harry inched just a little closer.
‘I love you too.’ Their little moment was ruined by a cough from across the room. Draco’s entire body tensed, and Teddy must’ve sensed it since he only gripped him tighter.
‘Master Draco, Spungen is being glad you is well.’ He could tell the elf was ready to start fawning all over him, but he put a stop to it quickly.
Removing his hands from his face he watched as Aspen leaped up from the bed and darted across to the small window in Regulus’ room. He jumped up onto the wide, old-fashioned window ledge and scratched at the shutters that were bolted closed.
Still, he was finding it difficult to adjust to life without a purpose. That sounded a lot more dismal than he really meant it, but he hadn’t appreciated the significance of waking up every morning with a job to do.
He was glad to step inside, the icy winter air finally shielded from him. He had paper fine skin after all, which his wrinkled frequently reminded him. He anxiously pressed at the corner of his eye as if he could smooth the skin back to how it had been when he was twenty-one and hadn’t even heard of moisturiser.
“Just give him a minute. He’s a fox, he doesn’t understand you.” Malfoy hissed in Harry’s ear. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Like she knew anything.
When he finally withdrew from the pensive, he was shaking and crying. Harry didn’t say a word. He hugged him tightly and waited for him to calm down. He cried so hard he hyperventilated, and if it wasn’t for Harry’s hand rubbing soothing circles in his back for him to focus on, he may well have passed out. He hiccupped and spluttered and grew more and more irate. How could he have forgotten that? He knew how much he hated his father by the end, he knew how horrible it had been to live in that house, he knew he had poor circulation because he had nerve damage. How had he managed to forget why?
Harry was looking at him that way he used to. Like Draco was the centre of the universe and nothing else mattered. His face was so close, his breath ghosting over Draco’s face and he wanted nothing more than to kiss him again. So, he did.
‘You could be calling me a bastard right now for all I know.’ Harry said huffily. Draco couldn’t help but find it cute that he’d arranged all this but wasn’t even enjoying it. He took a proffered apron and looped the straps around his waist to tie them at the front.
“My father used to say,” she interrupted, “that if I wanted to make the right impression, attract the right kind of attention, I should look my best at all times. Because I could never know when someone important might be around.” She said it in monotone, as if she was reeling off a speech she’d heard a million times before.
‘Ah, Mr Potter. I see we’re awake again. No doubt you feel like shit and would rather not see me right now.’ Draco liked his guy immediately.
He felt the tell-tale pull on his navel as he was swept away with the portkey. Harry held him in a vice-like grip as they spun. Draco’s stomach churned horribly, and he clung onto Harry as best he could. The world spun around them for what felt like an eternity, and when Draco’s feet finally touched the ground once again, he wretched violently.
‘I knew you just wanted a house out of me! I should never have agreed to build a potions lab for you, you’re way too spoilt.’ Draco grinned and kissed him gently, trying to keep it Teddy-suitable even though really, he was dying to rip Harry’s clothes off and take him upstairs. He could tell from the way Harry kept drawing him in that he was struggling with the effort too.
‘It’s going to take a long time for you to be up and about Mr Potter, your body is readjusting to its reattachment with your magic. It’s a very experimental procedure and I’d be grateful if you’d permit me to use your notes for research purposes.’ The healer said. Draco nodded and turned his attention to Harry.
“He’s a fox Ron, I can’t undo his natural instincts,” he mumbled, even though he had been wondering the same thing himself.
‘Dad! Look! Look what I managed to make the Lego do!’
‘I can’t believe you just apparated me to the middle of Paris without even thinking twice! That was a stupid thing to do!’ He swatted Harry’s arm but wasn’t really all that annoyed since he was unbelievably excited.
‘Don’t mention it. That girl is an absolute dream.’ Draco was gobsmacked.
‘Sorry everyone, I promise we’ll be right back.’ He pulled Draco into the house. ‘You ok?’ He held Draco’s face in his hands and looked at him worriedly.
‘No magic outside Hogwarts, remember?’ Teddy sighed dramatically but got up and followed Harry out of the room. Draco sat himself down where Harry had just been but changed his mind and ended up lying across the sofa. His mind was spinning. Teddy had taken it all remarkably well, but maybe that was just because he wouldn’t really understand until he had time to process it. Maybe Draco wasn’t giving him enough credit and he really was alright with it all. Kids were always more robust than anyone ever expected. He hadn’t appreciated how much Teddy loved him either, defending him like that when nearly everyone had shunned him.
It was difficult to keep his head up. The ground was cold underneath him and the wall damp against his back, but it was already too dark to see much of the inside of his cell, and he was too exhausted and shivery to move. His chin fell against his chest and he held back a sob. This was not the way things were meant to go. It was impossible to tell how long he sat there, his head pounding and his thoughts whirring, but at some point, he must have fallen asleep.
‘Harry,’ he whimpered into the darkness. His voice sounded pathetic and small even to his own ears.
‘We’re wizards, Draco. We invented silencing and locking charms for a reason…’ The smirk on Harry’s face made Draco want to punch him, but he supposed that wouldn’t get him very far.
‘Hermione, Neville.’
‘I think there’s something funny about this place,’ Draco said absently as he scanned the second page. ‘They’ve both been seen at a private healing clinic. Wouldn’t have been unusual but their appointments seem to have been one after the other every single time they’ve been. They’re obviously not regular appointments, which means they’ve made either emergency appointments or one of those on-the-day appointments they’re trialling from the muggle NHS.’ Harry leaned across the desk and looked over his shoulder to read the same passage Draco had just read.
‘You should stay here,’ Harry told him as he ran the taps. He paused, letting the shampoo run down his shoulders.
A week into his overhaul, the first couple of inhabitants began to return to the smaller frames, eager to find out who was present in the chateau once again. Draco found the portraits became the closest human contact he had; they told him all about the history of the chateau and the generations of Malfoys who had lived there. Draco was surprised to discover that most of his paternal ancestors were in fact nothing like his father, and highly disapproved of his actions once Draco told them what had become of their lineage.
“I like it. It feels different.” Harry cast a warming charm over the both of them and suggested they head home with a nod of his head.
“It’s going nowhere.”
‘Pansy please,’ he imitated her exaggerated tone, ‘I’m gay, I’m not dead.’ She cackled her way out of his lab and he was finally able to get back to his work in peace, his mind whirring with the implications of Harry wanting him at his birthday. It would be the first time he’d ever been back to his marital home and he wasn’t sure he would ever be quite ready for that.
She sighed. ‘I know. It sounds terrible. But in medieval wizarding communities divorce wasn’t a thing the way it is now. Couples separated of course, but they didn’t go through any sort of formal settlements, they didn’t divide their possessions, they just…started living separate lives.
‘Harry, please,’ Draco’s voice wobbled, ‘not so many questions at the same time. I’m having really bad time being around you all the time and Teddy leaving.’ Draco jumped as Harry unwound his arms enough to take both of Draco’s hands in his own.
He ran to his shower, desperate to get the smell of Harry’s aftershave off him. He ripped off his blue shirt and the chinos he’d chosen to wear and vanished them. He never wanted to see them again. He stepped into the shower and turned the temperature right up, as if burning a couple of layers of skin was some sort of suitable punishment.
‘LIKE ANY OF IT MATTERS!’ He roared. He didn’t know where it came from. It was like an inferno of anger blasted through him and had nowhere to go. The glass rattled around them and Harry was gripping Draco’s arms in the blink of an eye.
‘Draco? Are you ok? That tea must be scalding! You didn’t even put milk in it. Shit, it’s burning you.’ Draco felt’s Harry’s magic crackle over his skin but he stayed staring straight ahead, as if he wasn’t really there. Harry’s voice disappeared into the background and the world blurred around him. He could feel Harry’s hands on his cheeks, was vaguely aware of his face right in front of his own, but it was as though he was watching on as someone else.
‘Look away now, bud.’ Harry joked before taking Draco face in both hands and kissing him forcefully. Draco made a slightly inhuman sound of surprise at the sheer emotion he could feel radiating of him. It was a bruising kiss, Harry pulling at Draco’s lower lip and sending shivers down his spine. Draco thought maybe Harry had forgotten where they were, so he pulled away first.
The more Draco said, the more worried Granger looked. At first, she remained impassive as he told her about being reunited with his wand and the way people had stared, but as soon as Draco brought up Cousin Sirius, she started biting her lip and her brows furrowed. This was where Draco was in the dark. He knew relatively little about Potter’s relationship with Sirius Black, other than knowing he had been Potter’s godfather. It seemed it was a familiar topic to Granger though, although she seemed relatively surprised that it was something Draco had heard about.
‘Can I say both? I don’t know. It hurts the most to think he took me in just because he pitied me, not because he cares about me, but it’s even more insulting to think that everyone else knew it and I didn’t. Especially because…I’ve never cared about anyone the way I care about him. I didn’t really date anyone after we split – it never felt right.’ He felt like such a sap admitting it to a total stranger, but it was true. He didn’t really know who he was without Harry. France had taught him that he was capable of living without him, but that didn’t mean he wanted to.
Luna took Harry’s bundled-up fox and he immediately missed the warmth of holding it close to his chest. He wasn’t the only one. The fox began screaming again, turning its head wildly as Luna carried it away. Harry hoped it was looking for him. He glanced back at Malfoy who clearly wasn’t the slightest bit interested in Harry’s presence. He watched her turn another page, her long fingers hooking under each page and lifting so that she didn’t make a single sound. He wondered if she did that on purpose.
As they flooed to Diagon, Draco tried his best to ignore the small feeling of guilt niggling in the back of his mind. He had a meeting on Monday with an agent to sort out the apartment he was going to rent in France. He had an international Portkey booked and had requested the time off work. Thankfully, as Harry was Head Auror he was far too important to deal with such menial tasks as granting holidays, and thus far Draco had managed to make no mention of his planned trip. He’d be back in time for work on Tuesday anyway, he was sure Harry would never even notice.
‘Draco,’ Harry said carefully. He walked around the table and pulled him into a hug. ‘I don’t need to pretend to be someone else to go out to dinner with you. I just wanted to be sure it’s something you really want. If you do, then we can go. Is it what you want? I thought you wanted to wait until we could tell Teddy when he gets back from school.’
‘You think I’m poisonous?’ Teddy looked at him like he was stupid shook his head.
‘A family day. Where exactly is our family?’ He did make a good point, but he wasn’t sure where the attitude was coming from.
The last thing he saw as he felt the familiar pull from his navel, was Harry frantically calling for him to stay but as he landed in his crumby little flat he knew he’d made the right decision.
‘Who’s this?’ He asked Harry.
‘Well, since this issue with your magic hasn’t been resolved, Pansy has stepped in and started the classes I offered you. Please don’t be offended, you’re more than welcome to take over whenever you’re feeling up to it. Anyway, it’s actually about Ella.’ Draco wasn’t surprised that things had moved on without him and to be honest, he wasn’t sure he was the best choice for those classes anyway. He was surprised that Pansy was running them, however. That seemed far too benevolent for her.
Snapping the book shut and throwing it away in a fit of anger, Draco decided to walk the grounds. He was anxious for tomorrow and stir crazy looking at the rows upon rows of books all day; he needed to expend some energy.
“Nothing!” Pansy said too brightly, “we were just discussing… how pretty the roses are!” She pointed to the side of the window completely opposite to the rose garden.
He was just about to give up hope when he saw a figure in the distance. It was strangely ghostly and for a minute he wondered whether he really was stuck between the planes of existence. He walked towards the figure. Or at least, that’s what he thought he did. He couldn’t tell if he actually had any arms and legs and he felt like he was moving through something that was much thicker than water but just as cold, but he got closer to it never the less.
Before he made it to the stocks, the front-page headline caught his eye.
‘I’m not ready. When I saw father he-’
“Pans,” he leant forward and rested his elbows on the desk, something his father would have hexed him for, “you realise anything we tell you puts you at risk?”
‘What is all this?’ Harry asked him without looking up.
‘It’s good to see you, Draco. You have a lot of our lunch dates to catch up on. With interest.’ She walked off, presumably to use the floo, he didn’t really know. His mind was racing, filling him with guilt. He was so useless at being a parent, at keeping a family together. No wonder things with Harry so quickly gone off track. He never thought about anyone else.
Draco aimed it as best he could through his slightly blurred vision and cast a cutting charm to trim Harry's beard closer to the stubble Draco preferred. Harry looked astounded.
A noise startled him as he was waiting for the kettle to boil. It was a strange scuffing sound coming from the hallway. Harry was certain he’d locked the front door before they left so it would be worrying if something, or someone, had gotten inside.
‘I think you’re making really good progress here, Draco. I’m grateful that you’ve decided to trust me with this. Now, I want you to think about it carefully – what would you say hurts you the most? That you feel as though Harry has humiliated you, or that he lied and doesn’t love you?’ It sounded brutal when he said it like that. Had Draco really implied that Harry didn’t love him. Was that the truth or was Smith just repeating what Draco had said back to him?
‘That’s ok,’ he wheezed slightly. ‘Did you miss me?’ She nodded vigorously.
‘We were happy for nearly eight years.’ Harry argued stubbornly.
He led them out through the back of the chateau and across the immaculate lawns. Spungen couldn’t manage to maintain the gardens on his own, not that Draco had expected him to, and whilst the lawns were kept to perfection, the flowerbeds were dry and desolate. They said nothing as they walked. Draco kept his hands clenched into fists in his pockets so that Harry couldn’t try to hold them.
to serve Master Harry.’ Harry sometimes regretted asking Draco to move in with him, he only gave Kreacher the impression it was alright to talk to Harry like that. Harry might take it from
Draco realised how stupid he was to be telling Harry all of this now, now that everything had already fallen apart. He should never have accepted Kingsley’s offer to consult with the Ministry, he should never have made a deal with Hermione to stay for six months before moving, he should never have told Teddy he would be there when he came back from school.
‘Why are they called rose windows?’ Harry asked him.
He had one more stop to make before he went to visit the one person who would always listen and never answer back.
‘Draco,’ Pansy started carefully. Draco knew from experience that when Pansy’s voice takes on a soft tone, you’re in trouble. ‘Did you expect him to stay alone forever?’ She asked him gently. That took the wind out of Draco’s sails. He stopped pacing. He felt cold all over, like he’d been drenched in ice water. Pansy said nothing.
He cleared his throat and stepped in front of her, effectively putting an end to their conversation. He placed his palm flat against the intricate designs and felt the thrum of magic beneath the surface. Since taking over from his father, Draco had discovered many hidden corridors and rooms around the Manor that he hadn’t known about before. It certainly explained how his father had always seems to know when Draco had misbehaved, and why
With much less trepidation than he’d had the first time he’d viewed this particular memory, he delved in.
“Idiot.”
He stood before Harry, his face a blank slate. Harry looked him in the eyes, waiting for him to explain what the heck he was doing. Draco couldn’t really explain though, it didn’t make a lot of sense really, it just felt like something he needed to do. The bed was warm when Draco climbed in and he was immensely grateful that Spungen was around. He wondered if he should employ more house elves – the chateau wouldn’t run itself and it was such a large property for Spungen to manage on his own. That wasn’t exactly a priority now, however.
‘Project? Good to hear you’re getting back on your feet. Give my best to Harry when you get back?’
By mid-afternoon, his broom brought into the house and placed in the corner of his bedroom ready to be serviced, he forced himself to focus on the task in hand. He therefore found himself seated at his research desk next to Granger and opposite Pansy. He hadn’t asked what had been said between the two of them while he had been in the lab, but whatever it was it seemed to have taken a toll on Pansy. Possibly no one else would have noticed, but Draco had been Pansy’s closest friend since they were four years old, and he could see the tiny make-up smudge under her eye she would never usually let slip, and the slight trembled of her lip she fought to control. She had obviously already cried this morning, and that was not what he wanted for his best friend.
‘What about her?’ Tension held his shoulders like a newly erected scarecrow.
‘Oh, so you mean after you dumped me on my sorry arse you were kind enough to let me live my own damn life? How charming of you Potter, let me know if you need me to write you a recommendation for your next marriage.’ Draco was furious. As if he should thank him for letting him be his own person.
‘No.’ He said, his voice wavering. Of course he hadn’t. He couldn’t ask Harry to stay sad and alone forever just because Draco couldn’t be what he wanted.
‘I always forget how well you can sing until Christmas comes around,’ he mused as Draco threw tinsel over him. They banned magic from the Christmas tree decorating, purely on principle. The first Christmas Draco and Harry spent together they both realised they’d never decorated their own tree. Draco because he’d never celebrated Christmas outside of Hogwarts, and Harry because his aunt and uncle had never let him. They both made it a point to decorate their tree themselves. Draco hadn’t even bothered getting a tree after the divorce, it didn’t feel right without Harry.
‘No. It’s fine. You were right to tell me.’ He said, although it didn’t really sound like his own voice.
“And you are?”
to wander into their flat? As far as he knew, they hadn’t left any doors or windows open, and foxes didn't just appear out of nowhere. His instincts told him there was something purposeful about the new arrival.
“Good. Really good, actually. Sometimes makes me wonder if he-” Ron wasn’t able to finish for his voice cracking.
“Easy peasy!” Granger said with a grin. She handed the wand to Draco as if he would know whether this was Potter’s wand or not. It was immaculate despite the fact that it had been in an evidence locker supposedly collecting dust for eight months.
The woman produced two sets of paperwork for the Hit Wizards to fill in and she was joined by a stooped middle-aged man who was the first to speak to Draco directly. Luckily the paperwork meant Draco was temporarily released from the tight grip on his upper arms, although his hands were still bound.
you my darling? Did you sleep well? It’s
She rolled her eyes at him. “I don’t need a Latin grammar lesson, what are you trying to say?”
‘Can we go and look at the Christmas decorations? I know we already put the tree up, but I like looking at them.’
‘Oh. I don’t know that much really. It’s a later period than my interests. I only really started learning when I was renovating the chateau…’
‘I’m sorry. It happened to me too. I had no idea it was a bond I swear or I-’
“The thing is Draco, I mean- Malfoy, if you’re brought in again there won’t be much I can do for you. I’m not qualified and what I did to post your bail could have seen me struck off before I was even on. If we want to get Harry back and keep you out of Azkaban, we don’t have any other choice.” She looked scared as she said that, and Draco noticed that Pansy shifted just a little closer to her. He tried to think about how it might feel to see Potter again and he found he couldn’t. Things would be so completely different now. Maybe, Potter would even hate him more for not doing anything to stop him, and if he helped Granger he might end up with even more blood on his hands if something were to go wrong.
As soon as Granger had gone, he bolted up to the top floor. He stopped on the way to grab a small silver dagger his father pretended was a letter opener from his desk drawer. There would only be one chance for him to get this right and he couldn’t afford to waste time.
‘You know that no one can actually take me away from you, don’t you? I nearly died when you started screaming like that, and I’ve seen a few things…’ He looked troubled and Draco's guilt over having woken him up flared again. Harry had been the one to suffer nightmares at first; Draco’s hadn’t been really bad until after the divorce when…He couldn’t actually remember what he used to have nightmares about.
‘Be honest with me,’ he didn’t like the way that sounded. ‘Do you want to be here?’ Draco went cold.
“No, I’m not.” He kept his voice flat, hoping that if he could feign disinterest, Granger might let the subject lie. He lent forward and poured himself and Pansy a second cup of tea. Granger was so preoccupied she’d hardly touched hers.
‘You know, I think the tree gets better every year,’ Harry said once they’d finished. They alternated between red and gold and silver themes – they never could quite let their old school rivalry go, no matter how old they got.
‘Stop Harry. You need to stop.’ Draco was shallow breathing and the further Harry’s voice rose, the worse the buzzing in his ears was getting.
I realise it’s not exactly cheery, but it’s possible you were using Harry’s magic to protect yourself. Are there any obvious gaps? Maybe from sixth year or something concerning your mark, it has to be something related to the mark or it's unlikely it would have come back quite so vividly. Does that seem plausible?’
‘What? I needed it ok? The couple who were looking to adopt Ella have withdrawn their application. They’re being relocated to Austria. Ella’s inconsolable and they’ve tried everything to calm her down. She says she only wants you…’ Draco felt a rush of warmth. He had no idea he meant that much to her.
‘It was complicated. I don’t know how to explain.’ Harry nodded.
That night the message was a simple one:
His entire face was soft. Rounded jaw, button nose, wide eyes, soft brow. His hair was now a dirty blond and his eyes were hazel. It was difficult to tell but he estimated he was about three inches shorter, the inches added to his shoulders and waist. This muggle wasn’t particularly bad looking, but he certainly wasn’t Draco.
May 1999
They stumbled to the man’s room, dropping items of clothing throughout the house as they went, and Draco found he really didn’t give a shit about much else anymore. Why had he gone out in the first place? He really couldn’t remember. All he knew was that this stranger knew all the right things to say and all the right things to do, as if he could read Draco’s mind and it was absolutely thrilling. As they tumbled into bed together, Draco didn’t have a care in the world.
The moment he gives in is obvious because Draco’s tense shoulders drop. “Fine,” he mutters, flopping down dramatically on the sofa and resting his head in Harry’s lap. Looking down at Draco, he can see there are light tear tracks down his face, and Harry’s stomach clenches with guilt and worry.
‘Do you think I would’ve stayed here permanently?’
“Well it looks like that’s a dead end anyway. It’s nice that you wanted to help Cousin Sirius but maybe he’s better off without the werewolf,” Lyra shrugged. Harry balled the letter up in his fist.
“Of course not.” Granger shifted her weight from foot to foot looking sheepish. “They think I took a wand belonging to a Penny Weston who went missing twenty years ago. They have an awful backlog up in evidence.”
loved Draco. He often found himself feeling like this, like he wanted to stay curled around him forever. The problem was, he didn’t know why he felt that way and he didn’t like it. He didn’t like feeling as though he needed someone else and he couldn’t say it out loud either, it sounded so pathetic whenever he tried.
Draco watched on in amusement as the pastry chef got more and more frustrated with Harry. It seemed everything she told him to do, he did the exact opposite. Harry kept shooting him mournful glances which only made him laugh more. After a while, when the crème pât miraculously came together, Draco sauntered over and irresponsibly dipped his finger in to taste it. Harry was so distracted by watching Draco lick crème pâtissière off his fingers that he over-whisked it and the mixture split.
‘What is it?’ Harry asked him.
“If you say so…” Harry doesn’t like how uncertain Malfoy seems. Does he really think Harry is here because he’s in trouble? “Would you like tea?” Harry nods, and Draco disappears out of the room faster than Harry can say ‘yes please’. He would have thought a house elf would bring tea for them, but since there wasn’t one to answer the door either…
“We can’t let it out in the street either!”
Harry set about dishing up the food Draco had been cooking while he waited for them to return. Teddy, eager as always to help, went to set the table, leaving Draco presumably on drink duty. He glanced sideways at the open door where he could see Teddy’s school trunk abandoned at the front door, Eltanin’s cage perched precariously on top. It struck Draco that maybe he’d lost sight of all the good things in his life because it was so easy to fixate on the bad.
‘Do you know how difficult it was watching you today.’ Harry said, his voice taking on a strange tone. ‘Chatting with Neville and playing games with Rose and Hugo. Do you have any idea what you look like when you laugh like that, when you smile like no one else is watching?’ Draco thought his heart might burst clear out of his chest it was beating so hard.
‘No sweetheart, I’m just very happy to see you.’ Teddy grinned at him.
‘That’s the date I found you in France. I know, it might be a bit morbid and you probably don’t want to remember what day it was. It’s just…it’s also the day I realised how stupid I was for letting you go. I’m never letting you go again.’
He was surprised when he opened the bedroom door that the bedsheets looked like they’d been disturbed. Draco always made Harry make the bed even when he wasn’t home because rumpled bedsheets were one of his pet peeves. Except when then shagged of course, but Harry wouldn’t dare complain about that – knowing Draco he’d withhold sex. Harry didn’t like how much willpower Draco had on that front.
The reception area was empty, as was the kitchen and the offices where the social workers came and went. They headed up to the first floor, where they found a few of the children sitting around being very quiet. Draco wasn’t very hopeful that the situation was under control. It must be bad for the staff to have abandoned the other kids in order to help.
Draco wished the floor would swallow him whole. Of course, he had told himself all along that Potter had gone through the Veil as he said he would, but somewhere in the back of his mind he held onto the hope that he hadn’t. That he’d listened to what Draco had said and come up with another plan. Because if Potter really had stepped through, which it appeared that he had, there was no way of knowing if he even still existed.
‘My father was a bad person. He was on the wrong side during the war, he told me all kinds of lies about things he didn’t really understand, and he hurt innocent people who didn’t deserve it. I don’t see what else there is to say on the subject.’ Draco didn’t talk about his father, ever. He’d told Harry how he’d received the kiss and later “died of an undiagnosed blood infection”. Draco had never believed that. Other than that, his father was black-listed from Draco’s acceptable topics of conversation.
‘S’not your fault.’ Draco rasped, and Harry pressed a kiss to the back of his head, then his neck, then his shoulder. Eventually Draco gave up his cold front and turned towards Harry. He latched onto Harry like a life force and buried his head into the crook of his neck and Harry’s heart soared. There’s nothing Harry wanted more than to have Draco curled up in his arms forever. Harry ran a hand down Draco’s spine gently as his shaky breaths began to even out.
‘Ella has just been telling me about the books she got for Christmas.’ Daphne told him. ‘Come on then missy, you’re done. Go and sit on that chair over there and we can talk about what we’re going to do with this beautiful hair of yours.’ Ella squealed with delight and bounded off towards one of the styling chairs.
‘Shut up Pans,’ Harry said with a roll of his eyes even Draco would’ve been proud of. ‘Pansy has decided-’
He rolled his eyes at her. ‘I’m fixing your hair of course.’
“How do you feel?” Granger asked him anxiously. She was an inch shorter than before, and he could see that the Polyjuice was starting to wear off, which meant he was already well on his way to being his normal self again. He was glad he had brought extra.
‘That’s not what I’m talking about.’ Harry snapped and turned the pages back to Draco’s basic information. Draco couldn’t figure out what was so important that Harry felt the need to barge into his flat after hours and- oh.
“Have you told the Weasleys about all of this?” It was a tricky situation. How much could they feasibly say? Granger flushed slightly.
After their laughter had died away, Draco took his opportunity. ‘Yeah, yeah you do.’ He listened as there was a sharp intake of breath.
He was about to forget all about Potter and continue his chat with his mother, when someone approached Potter from behind and snapped him back to reality. Draco watched as his previously serious face lit up when he clapped eyes on the man who’s face Draco recognised but name he couldn’t place. The two men embraced, and Potter’s companion kissed his cheek. Draco watched as Potter flushed adorably and he could kick himself for finding it so damn sweet. He was, however, getting more and more frustrated by the fact that he couldn’t figure out who Potter was meeting.
He didn’t recognise the street they were on. It looked like an alley, but slightly wider than Knockturn and not as open as Diagon. Perhaps they were somewhere in muggle London. He stood behind Harry and felt a surge of jealousy when he noticed Harry’s hair was mussed in a way Draco recognised from all the mornings they’d woken up together.
In the living room, Draco downed the potion. He sneered when he noticed Harry had left his wand on the coffee table. He even remembered that Draco hated sleeping with his wand in the same room as him after a nightmare went very wrong. Why couldn’t he just hate Harry? Why couldn’t Harry have turned into an evil git in the past few years? That man had no consideration for other people.
Draco didn’t ever want to let go of Harry. Harry was safe and warm, and he loved Draco, he
Granger looked ready to spit venom but managed to hold her tongue.
He didn't even know who to use his one floor call on.
‘Please, I bet Kingsley is still crying without you.’
The flat was quiet as Harry walked through to the kitchen. The water dish he had left out for the fox was empty, but there was no sign of his furry refugee anywhere. Harry really needed a shower, but he also needed to make sure the fox wasn’t destroying the flat somewhere out of site. The idea that perhaps the fox had only needed a shelter for the night and had taken off before he awoke made Harry’s heart squeeze uncomfortably.
“Ok, so first you open the internet, that’s this button here.” Draco watches Harry’s fingers slide over the funny square bit at the bottom of the laptop. He presses a circular button on the screen and a blank white page shows up. “Then you type in the bar at the top here.” Harry starts typing out the word ‘instagram’ and presses the big key on the right with the arrow on it.
‘Come on then, Ted. What do you want to do first?’ Draco asked him as they headed through to the living room to use Harry’s floo.
If there’s one secret talent Draco has, it’s that he’s learnt his way around a camera. It’s the one and only muggle technology he has taken to like a duck to water. He’s only been dating Harry a few months, and he knows there are plenty of things Harry doesn’t know about him, so he quickly slinks off to get his collection of Margaret Atwoods. A few days previously, she had been doing a book signing near where Harry lived and Draco was too nervous to go on his own, so he asked Harry to come too. It caused a big argument between them because Draco had missed the past three quidditch matches Harry had played and, maybe rightly, Harry felt like he was more supportive of Draco than Draco was of him.
Pansy poured her fourth cup of tea with shaking hands. She laughed bitterly as she did so. “Of course I haven’t discussed it with Hermione, what is there to say? If it was you, no force on earth would keep me from going after you. We stand by our own.” He would freely admit that when he had first found out about Pansy’s relationship, he was dubious. For the life of him he couldn’t figure out what pulled the two of them together. But now, now he saw the dedication in her. Even though it was killing her to sit by and watch, she knew Granger needed this. It broke his heart.
‘Pansy’s pregnant!’ He shouted, his voice muffled by the sheets over his head. Harry’s head dropped, and his shoulders slumped. They’d been trying to adopt for over a year now and they were having no luck. Harry would do anything to get Draco the baby he so desperately wanted, he wasn’t even above pulling the
‘Ok. Just focus on me and you’ll be fine. Can you do that?’ Draco nodded, unable to trust his voice. Harry’s hand sought his and the minute their fingers intertwined something loosened in Draco’s chest. He was still terrified, his pulse thudding heavily in his ears, but it was still easier to breathe. He let Harry guide him carefully through the crowds, focusing on the back of his head and trying to remember how it felt to run his fingers through his dark hair. Draco’s grip on his hand was vice-like and he hoped Harry wouldn’t hate him too much for hurting him.
It felt like the tapestry was calling out to him and he closed his eyes so he wouldn’t find his gaze wandering towards it. His stomach swooped with wave upon wave of emotions he couldn’t fully decipher, and he felt his eyes itch with hot tears that he didn’t understand. Why would a single name make him feel so cast out and untethered? He didn’t remember lying down, but he could feel the soft material of the transfigured sofa pressing against his cheek. It didn’t stop his head swimming, but it was a relief not to have to hold himself up anymore. He jumped when he felt his head being lifted but he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes. There was a rustle of clothing and a dip in the sofa and suddenly his head was resting on something warm and solid.
Saturday 13
“You were expecting Potter to step right out of that Veil and ask you if he’d missed anything.” She said without looking at him.
lying on the kitchen table.
When he got back downstairs, he saw Pansy disappearing through the floo. She managed to catch his eye just before she disappeared, and he could’ve sworn she was smirking.
What did it matter now though? Draco was still the same person. Sure, he didn’t have attacks nearly as often, and he didn’t have an overwhelming need to stay inside all the time, but those issues hadn’t changed. If anything, it would be worse for Draco to tell Harry now. Harry would never let him look after Teddy on his own if he knew how much of a mess Draco was. Not that he’d ever had an episode whilst Teddy was around. No, it absolutely wouldn’t do to go back on things that were done and dusted.
“Sorry,” he apologised, his voice watery, “what were you saying?” But neither of them resumed what they were saying.
‘Helen was just telling me the paperwork finally got approval from the muggle government, so we’ll be added to their systems as of next month and we can finally start taking in muggleborns.’ Draco nodded – that was certainly progress.
‘Harry you have to understand, I-’ Harry shook his head and Draco cut himself off.
‘Yeah. Just thought you should know.’ Harry said as he started rubbing his neck awkwardly again. ‘Anyway, I should be going, I have someone-somewhere to be.’ Draco heard the someone. He said nothing.
‘I think I’d like to be a healer when I’m grown up. Or I want to look after plants, people forget about them.’ Draco smiled fondly at how caring he was. Maybe they hadn’t done such a bad job of raising him after all.
There was no one in the corridors which seemed unusual to Draco, but it wasn’t as though there was anyone to ask about it. He knocked politely on Hermione’s office door. There was some shuffling from within, and he almost opened the door himself to check that everything was alright, but then the door was flung open with some force, and a bedraggled looking Hermione stood in the doorway. Half of her hair was hanging out of its bun and her face was flushed scarlet.
An unwelcome voice in his mind told him.
‘I’m ok. Just haven’t travelled that far in so long.’ Harry had an arm secured around his waist.
“You know you’re really not helping yourself here.” When he said nothing, she sighed and continued. “Pansy sent me. She’s been going spare you know, but they wouldn’t let anyone in to see you.” Draco’s blood ran cold. He knew the chances of him getting fair treatment were slim, but if this was how the Ministry were going to play it now, things could only get worse later.
so he did, and the screen came to life. He tapped the funny looking button with the red number one on it and found the message.
‘Forgive me, Minister, but it doesn’t sound like you have many leads here.’ Draco said. None of the information in the file seemed to make any sense.
‘Why do you care so much about Harry?’ Draco didn’t like the way Smith always asked about him. Was he a closet superfan who wanted all the details? Was he going to use Draco’s insecurities against him? Everyone had an ulterior motive.
“Oh.” To Harry’s utter dismay, the car lurched to a stop and died. It was eerily silent besides the sound of the rain hammering at the windows. Harry glanced over at Draco who was white as a sheet and clutching onto the steering wheel for dear life.
‘Bad one, huh.’ He said. She nodded and smiled at him kindly. She was pretty, if you were into that kind of thing. Long, dark hair and wide, unassuming eyes.
‘He calls me Dad and you Daddy.’ Harry said it like it was the easiest thing in the world, but Draco felt like his heart would burst.
“Nothing bad happened. She just wants to talk to you, ok? I think it’d be better for her to explain it herself.” Draco nodded, all thought of how close he was to discovering his animagus form pushed to the back of his mind. Together they traipsed back up to the house, which took much longer than he remembered when he came out, and found Granger sitting in the parlour where the grand piano resides.
‘I-what?’ She rolled her eyes.
It would be far-fetched to say that Draco was in love with Potter. How could he be when he’d never even been on the receiving end of one of his smiles? Or known what it was like to deserve his kindness. But he knew he had the capacity to love Potter, if such a thing had ever been on the cards.
She took her first dose and he watched as she turned into a tall middle-aged woman with willowy limbs and sleek blonde hair. It was weird for Granger to be taller than him – he didn’t like it. He poked his head out of the door and waited for a crowd of people to pass so it wouldn’t look like they’d just appeared out of thin air.
“I’m sure she doesn’t. She just enjoys a good debate.” Harry hadn’t anticipated just how well Draco and Hermione would get along. It had definitely made things much easier for him that they had, although things were still tense with Ron.
coffee shop. Laughing away on their little date. I mean, he can date whoever the heck he wants but does he have to pick someone who looks like the female version of me? And in my favourite place as well? Talk about a kick in the teeth.’ Draco mumbled the last bit. Hermione looked dumbfounded.
Today however, he was taking a break from his writing to take Teddy shopping in muggle London. Draco liked to avoid Diagon this close to Christmas, but Oxford Street would still be relatively quiet in the middle of the week according to Harry, who said muggle children stayed in school until right before Christmas. Draco thought that was mean, Christmas was about spending time with family and people couldn’t do that if they were at work or school the whole time. He’d already bought presents for everyone except Harry, but he liked to shop with Teddy just to let the kid run wild for a few hours. Unfortunately, Harry couldn’t join them like he sometimes did, but Draco supposed that might work in his favour on this occasion.
‘You haven’t asked him about it?’ Draco had considered asking Teddy outright if everything was ok, but he supposed he had a parental version of an inferiority complex – he still thought of Teddy as more Harry’s than his own. He would never really admit it, but he always thought he’d be overstepping if he took matters into his own hands.
Draco scoffed. As if he wouldn’t be gentle with Teddy. Of course Harry would think badly of Draco.
‘Your guess is as good as mine.’ Ginny refused to pull a cracker with him and was especially cold the entire time. Draco happened to win both the crackers he pulled and got an Irish dancer to the eye when the magical animation got to close to him. Still, he wasn’t so mean as to hoard the hat or the mini sneakoscope he technically won.
‘I’m being careful, promise.’ He smiled at her cheekily and she opened her mouth to respond but was interrupted.
‘Don’t go.’ Draco’s hand stilled on its way to the floo powder and he turned to Harry who was standing with his hands in his pockets, his green eyes glittering. ‘You’ve travelled a lot today, I don’t want you to hurt yourself.’ Draco scoffed.
A pain lanced through Draco’s heart as if he had been stabbed. He winced and rubbed at his chest as if he could alleviate it. What was that about? Maybe it was karma, if he believed in such things.
‘I just want to know that we can get on if you take on this contract.’ Harry said earnestly.
‘Are you trying to give me a sugar rush?’ Harry simply shrugged.
‘I SAID NOT NOW!’ Draco yelled so loudly even Harry flinched. His heart broke when he heard Teddy whimper. ‘Ted-’
“Why is this so complicated? It’s like patting my head and rubbing my stomach at the same time! This is why wizards apparate!” He was struggling to change from third to fourth.
It’s definitely not what he expected when he knocked nervously on the Manor door earlier that day.
‘Golf? Really Pans, do I look like a middle-aged muggle bank manager?’ Pansy scoffed.
“Come here,” Harry says in the gentlest voice he can muster. There’s a pause while Draco acknowledges the change in tone. It’s easy to see the emotions flit across his face now that Harry is attuned to him. Mainly he can see that he’s trying to hold onto his anger towards Harry, but that anger is fighting against his need for reassurance, which he also gets from Harry.
century, and the reinforcement work cost a small fortune.
The only thing worse than an angry Hermione, is a sympathetic Hermione.
‘I know. I guess we’re all just suckers for a happy ending.’ She sighed. ‘Hey, it’s getting late, do you mind if I stay for tonight?’
Harry’d never even completed auror training, but Moody’s
‘Is Daddy going to die?’ Teddy asked in a small voice. Draco felt his heart shatter at the sheer innocence of his question. He turned in a flash, but he didn’t need to – Harry had already wrapped Teddy in a hug.
‘Are you sure?’
‘Give me five minutes and I really will be.’
He’d charmed little orbs of light to float around within. They twinkled against the glass which was also charmed so that one could see out without anyone seeing anything from the outside. The flagstone floor was covered with thick antique rugs and there was a real-wood fire, not currently lit, which was the focal point of the room. He’d had indoor climbers installed which trailed up the glass panels and added a sense of warmth. He hadn’t done much with the place really, only had a couple of well-worn sofas and a bookshelf, but the affects were something else entirely. A person could disappear in here and forget about the entire world around them.
‘Actually,’ Harry cut in, ‘my colleagues came across an abandoned potions lab yesterday which they think may be connected in some way. I’m pushing to get the paperwork through quickly so that we can scope the place out.’
‘Un bâtard?’ He clutched his chest in feigned horror, ‘je n’aurais jamais!’ By this point Harry was flushed heavily and Draco thought he’d best stop teasing him.
‘Oh for crying out loud, Draco. Get over yourself. We need to talk about that kiss and if you think I’m going to let those potions go, you’ve got another thing coming.’ Harry was leaning menacingly on his desk the same way Draco had done when he’d needed to bully the Minister’s secretary.
‘Be careful who you say that to, or people might think you’re serious.’
Harry explained to him how the fox had shown up at his and Ron’s flat, how he had been learning how to take care of him with Luna’s help, how it had been weeks now and no one had shown up to claim him. They went into the kitchen and Sirius made them tea, all the while listening attentively to what Harry had to say.
He decided it would be best for him to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible, so he turned tails as quietly as possible and tiptoed his way back through the house, collecting his abandoned clothes on his way. In a twisted way, it was good that this had once been his own house because it wasn’t quite so awkward making it all the way to the stairs before finding his discarded underwear.
He didn’t know what made him do it. He never really wanted to hurt Potter. He hated the git for being everything Draco could never be, but he never wanted to harm him. It was a reflex, words coming out of his mouth he thought his father would expect him to say, a curse the Dark Lord would expect him to use. ‘Cruc-’
‘’Arry ‘as asked me very kindly to give you a quick cours de cuisine. ‘Ow about it?’ Draco’s jaw fell open.
He’d still have to go to France.
‘Sorry!’ He wasn’t really sorry. Harry took the mugs from him so that he could remove the blanket from his head. ‘What did you pick?’ He asked him as he sat down on the sofa. He was glad he’d persuaded him not to buy a leather sofa, it would’ve been far too cold for his arse. He sunk into the dark fabric like it moulded to his body. Which it did, since he’d had the finest charm work done on it.
October 1999
‘Not this time. Well, if you’re going to be an arse about it I suppose I could spend a couple of hours perusing…’ Harry’s groan was enough to have him feeling smug. ‘No, on this occasion I wanted to show you this.’ He stopped right in the middle of the street where one of the shop fronts had been hidden by a disillusionment charm. The muggles walking past would probably see them staring at a poster for the ballet. ‘Oh my…’
“Of course, it’s written in the passive as you can see by the -ris which makes it slightly complicated since it’s not an active curse but there must be a work around. Since sole is in the ablative it suggests that it’s the sun being repelled, which makes the victim the repellent. Very important of course when considering the nature of a counter-curse…” Harry has literally no idea what Malfoy is talking about but it sounds amazing.
‘You stole from me.’ Draco said flatly. He was furious. Did Harry have any idea how many days he’d set Draco back because he’d been a dose short.
Was that what Wood had been about to say? That he didn’t know Harry and Draco were together because he and Harry...what? Hung out? Dated? Kissed? Slept together? Had Harry been sneaking off with Wood this whole time? Was that what that phone call had been? He felt the age-old panic rise in his chest, and he knew he had to calm down. He paced the flat anxiously.
‘Obviously.’ Harry spat, sounding scarily like Severus Snape. ‘I was referring to its contents.’ Ah, the penny dropped.
‘Well, that’s what Harry is here for. He’s much more familiar with the case than I am.’ Draco glanced at Harry, who was suddenly engrossed in the file he refused to pick up before. Draco could tell he wasn’t actually reading it.
‘Sorry. I, er, had a dream about my mother. And you. She used to love the waterlily house.’ He indicated off in the opposite direction where the greenhouse could just be seen in the distance. ‘I’d brought her here for a little trip out.’ Harry squeezed his hand. He was grateful they were walking as it meant he didn’t have to look at him and he could focus on the crunch of gravel beneath their feet.
‘Hermione,’ Draco said tiredly, ‘please not now.’ He wasn’t going to throw a party for a small example of accidental magic, they said that could be a possibility anyway. He certainly didn’t need Hermione going on a research extravaganza.
Walking in the opposite direction of the apsen trees, he passed the rock garden and the orchard. The apple trees were far from bearing fruit at this time of year, which was disappointing, so he strode on past them. He came to an old shed structure he couldn’t remember the purpose of until he kicked open the stuck bolt.
Pansy was particularly clingy that morning. She hung off Granger’s arm as well as every word she said. She stole kisses and kept tight hold of Granger’s hand. She laughed too loudly at attempts at jokes that weren’t really funny. It was difficult for Draco to see her so worried, but at the same time he thought it was sweet seeing them together like that. It made him ache with an understanding that he had little potential for romance being stuck in the Manor as he was. What kind of life would he ever lead if he couldn’t even walk down the street like a normal human being? And yet instead of being a model citizen, he was about to start actually breaking the law instead of just being suspected of it.
‘Mr Potter! It’s a pleasure to see you awake.’ The new healer reminded Draco a little of Gilderoy Lockhart with his wavy blonde hair and too-white teeth. Draco’s stomach turned, and he wasn’t convinced it was whatever potions they must have him on.
He didn’t today. He stayed exactly where he was and burrowed back into the dip of Harry’s collarbones.
“Do you want me to stop?” There was something of a challenge in the question, but he could sense the unevenness of her breath.
‘Hey,’ he wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. ‘We’re past that. If it was enough for you to notice, then I wasn’t balancing my time very well. Anyway, it’s not really an issue now, is it?’ Harry turned and kissed Draco’s cheek.
‘You too. Thank you so much for doing this for me.’ She rolled her eyes at him.
Smith seemed to perk up at this, the sadistic prick. ‘Might be? Did something happen between you?’ Smith lent forward and Draco once again felt trapped. He thought about just telling Smith. After all, he didn’t really have much to lose. It would fill the time and wasn’t he just saying the other day that he could use someone to talk to? Weeks rather. He forgot how long he was asleep.
‘I hope so. It’s taking a lot of work. I’ve been trying to get planning permission to sort out the garden for months but they’re being a pain in the arse about it because it’s a grade two listed building.’
‘Will you please tell me what happened?’ He asked the mediwitch as she updated his notes. He was desperate to think of anything else.
‘I think he cheated on me.’ Draco looked down at his hands which were absent of any rings. He’d taken to wearing his old wedding ring on occasion, but since Harry had admitted to sleeping with Wood, he’d felt as though… as though he couldn’t bring himself to look at it anymore. It felt like another life.
‘Stop it!’ He yelled. He jumped up from his seat in much the same way Harry had. ‘Stop looking at me like that!’
“Are you sick? I don’t have much favour anymore, but I still know a few healers who would help if they knew-” His chest swelled with affection when he dared to meet her eye and saw the earnest look on her face. It was hard not to smile.
Draco could feel the stubble Harry had regrown catching on his chin as their jaws worked. It sent a strange thrill up his spine for a reason he couldn’t identify and despite the strange circumstances, he felt like he was coming home. Harry’s lips were always warm and comforting, and this time when he pulled on Draco’s bottom lip, Draco did nothing to stop him.
‘You’re such a housewife.’ Harry laughed as he sat down next to Draco. He swung his legs up into Harry’s lap and he didn’t complain.
‘You obviously already know why I didn’t change it and why I didn’t tell you Harry, why did you even come here?’ This really was getting ridiculous and Draco was done. He wasn’t going to play along anymore.
‘Don’t give me that. Do you really think I’m going to let Teddy stay at yours if you’ve got some disgusting potions addiction?’ Harry was seething. Draco could’ve seen it, having known Harry all these years, except he didn’t need to. The ink well on his desk was rattling and the generic picture frames on his office walls were shaking. Harry’s magic was reacting to his anger and threatening to explode.
‘Harry?’ He knocked on the door forcefully. Sometimes the warding around the room made it impossible to hear someone on the outside, but Draco still felt it important to knock before he entered. He always had. There was no reply, but he’d expected as much.
Teddy made a beeline for the broom on display at the centre of the shop. It was a Lightening ’98 – named after Harry and dated by the war. Draco had thought it was cheap advertising at the time, but Harry had convinced him that he was only grateful they hadn’t called it the Potter ’98 and tried to sell it with his face all over it. Of course, it was practically a vintage model now, hence why the little plaque next to it read
Finally, Draco gasped in a lungful of air. He’d almost relaxed until he realised he couldn’t let it go again, but Harry was still there. ‘In…and out, Draco. You can do this.’ He told him calmly. He released his breath and slowly he tried to find a normal breathing rhythm.
‘I have a favour to ask…’
‘How did you-’
‘I miss you.’ Harry said abruptly. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. He didn’t need this. Not now.
‘Don’t,’ Draco said icily, ‘presume to tell me what I can and cannot think.’ He turned his body towards Harry and shot him the fiercest glare he could muster. Harry visibly shrunk into his seat and Draco felt a twisted sense of pride that he still had some kind of power over him after all this time.
Draco had found him. After all this time Potter had been getting on with his life. A guttural sound escaped Draco when he realised that maybe Potter had stayed away on purpose all along… had Weasley gone with him? However, through the fox the noise came out closer to a high-pitched screech than a cry of pain. It made no sense for Draco to be there like this. Had the spell actually worked? Or was Draco so close to the edges of reality that he could no longer tell fact from fiction?
