“He— He threw me out. He didn’t let me gather my things. He—” You drop your head into your hands, your elbows resting on your knees as you rake your fingers through your hair and release a heavy sigh. “He didn’t even let me use the Floo.”
PPS You know muggles invented mechanical record players over a century ago, right? No magic or electricity needed.
“The exam you have next week?” he clarified. “The one you wanted my help studying for? The reason I’m here?”
Maybe the whole ordeal would’ve been more bearable if it had only been about that bloody speech. To think that the part I had been dreading the most about that day turned out to be the least worrisome. It was still awful, no two ways about that, but even so, it was nothing compared to what came after.
“W-what?” Harry gasped, mindlessly scrunching up the bedspread in his fists as he bucked into Draco’s hand.
Draco did as he was told and was greeted by the green depths he’d willingly drown in for the rest of his life.
brain. You will find this one day you know, broken and discarded, and you’ll figure out a way to fix it, to make it better and more powerful than it ever was before.” Merlin. Harry sounded so proud. Of him. Of future him, but still. Proud as a preening peacock. “And you won’t do it to change history either, or even to correct a mistake. You’ll do it because it’s a challenge, a mystery you can’t resist solving. Because that’s who you are, Draco; a mystery-solver. And one of the most intelligent wizards I know.”
Draco reached for the box on the side table. “You know that project I’ve been working on ever since I joined the Department? The one that got me the promotion a few years back?”
Potter — the younger version; the one who’d never cared two Knuts about Draco — had just pulled him out of a rampant Fiendfyre, saving his life without rhyme or reason, only to…
“No, he’s fine!” Draco cut her off, feeling irritated. “Well, as fine as he can be.” He paused and drew his wand, putting up a privacy shield around them. “Why did you tell everybody I was his fiancé?”
And Harry loved them too. For all the fuss and noise and never-ending bickering, they were a warm and caring family, and he felt honoured to be considered an undisputed part of it. But there was no use denying the fact that he never felt as lonely as he did after coming back from another visit to the Burrow. Somehow, the lively atmosphere and the continuous attacks on his senses made his own tranquil townhouse seem all the more desolate.
However, he wants to know what’s going on in Draco’s head. He always does. Even after all these years, the man is still an enigma, a puzzle Harry’s itching to solve. No, there’s really no point in denying this unhealthy curiosity, at least not to himself. And if his gut isn’t deceiving him, if this is indeed the topic weighing Draco down tonight, Harry doesn’t really need any additional reasons to humour him.
No, Draco couldn’t allow himself to relax. He wouldn’t. He knew if he did, he wouldn’t be able to hold back the moans, the groans, the needy whimpers that threatened to escape his throat at Harry’s every touch. He wouldn’t be able to keep from shuddering as those feather-light hands roamed over his body, wouldn’t be capable of restraining his urge to roll over and pounce on the man who was currently driving him crazy with want without even knowing it.
He rolled his eyes in a manner Harry had always thought universally exclusive to melodramatic teenagers. Teddy did that sometimes, acting much older than his years, and Harry usually had a hard time hiding his amusement whenever it happened. Tonight, though, it barely registered with him, distracted as he was by the implication of Teddy’s words.
. Draco bit back another groan as realisation hit him, sharp and mortifying; while Harry may not be able to see the proof of his arousal, he’d most definitely be able to smell it. Admittedly, there might be a slim chance the man was still too preoccupied with his anatomy revisions to notice, but with Draco’s usual luck, it was only a matter of time before…
Teddy nodded and didn’t protest as Harry went to pick him up from the sofa, compliantly wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and leaning his warm head against Harry’s chest.
I don’t know why the notion rattles me this much. I should have known this was bound to happen, sooner or later. I should have known you wouldn’t stay content playing house with your best mate forever; you’re not like me. You want more. And why shouldn’t you? After everything you’ve been through, you’re definitely worth it. You used to be so misguided, but you’ve changed since then. You’re a decent person now. Amazing even. And you’re beautiful. Fucking fabulous.
He watched the girl hurry back down the hallway and set the bag down, looking around for the only person he could blame for this situation.
“Because I’ve barely ever spoken to the man. I’m not his fiancé, and they’re going to figure out that I’ve lied to them, and then Harry Potter will hunt me down and kill me like the mini-dark lord I apparently still am.” His voice was rising in pitch, but he couldn’t help it. “And in the meantime, Molly will have had a nervous breakdown and Hermione will have a miscarriage, and it’ll all be my fault for destroying this really rather lovely family.”
Harry’s arm shot out, grabbing onto Draco’s bicep as Harry’s feet slid on the ice. Unprepared, Draco fell to his knees, dragged down onto the cold ground. The laughter they’d been enjoying increased and Draco tried to stand, only to slip and fall, landing with a huff entirely on top of Harry.
“Well, not just like that. Mostly, it sparked my interest. I came home and started reading up on it, and then I found a place to take some classes. About a year later, I bought the place next door to the Wheezes and set up my furnace. It’d be more of a problem without magic, keeping the furnace hot enough for long periods, but magic helps and keeps the heat from disrupting the rest of the alley.”
“My pleasure, ma’am.” He winked, already retrieving one packet of each to add to her plate. He rang up the purchase, leaving her to deal with the credit card machine as he started preparing her tea and turned to the next customer in line. “What can I get you, sir?”
So you were complimenting me after all? Thank you for clarifying that, or I never would’ve believed it. (Still doesn’t prove you’re not going insane in there, though, but anyway.) And don’t worry, I’d never expect any praise from you. I already have the entire wizarding community praising me without rhyme or reason and if praise was what I wanted from a friendship, I could pick any flailing fan from the street.
There’d been a reason he’d opted for the peace and quiet of upstairs today. His Charms revision required his undivided attention, something a crowded common room would never be able to provide, but with a roommate like Potter, he should have known better. He should have gone to the library.
Harry stared incredulously. “A fox? Whyever would you have a fox in a London flat?” He sounded almost accusatory, making Draco immediately defensive.
Sitting at his desk, Draco let out a sigh of frustration as he rifled through piles of parchment. He had to find last month’s invoice from St Mungo’s. All he could find was the paperwork for the dragon-keepers’ physicals and there was no sign of the emergency healing that had been required on 18th November.
PS You think I have ‘striking emerald eyes’? Is this your wistful inner poet talking, Draco, or have you been sneaking down into the wine cellar again?
“What?” Draco briefly turned his head to look at him, bewildered, before huffing a laugh. “Circe, Harry. I had no idea you were so sex fixated.”
Harry swallows. It’s not that he’d never date a man, he just… hasn’t. Yet. But dating a friend? It just seems…
The framed picture on the mantle catches his eye as he passes the fireplace on his way to the kitchen. Two newfound friends grin back at him, Draco’s arm casually slung over Harry’s shoulders, Harry’s loosely encircling Draco’s waist.
It was useless. As long as Draco was near, Harry didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of resisting the magnetic pull towards him. Harry wanted him, ached for him, and there was absolutely nothing he could do to avoid it.
“Inside,” Draco demanded. “Now.” His voice was a low, deep rumble that went straight to Harry’s cock, making it twitch in anticipation.
However, when George had come back to him a few months ago, telling him about Amanuensis Quills closing down — inside information he’d just gleaned at a Diagon Alley Shopkeepers’ Association meeting — Draco finally caved. The opportunity was too good to miss out on; the location too perfect to ignore and let go to waste. Situated right next to Madam Malkin’s, with the entrances of Gringott’s and Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes not even fifteen yards in each direction from its front door, the premises couldn’t have been more ideal for what they had in mind.
“Fine,” Draco said, veiling his thrumming anticipation with a challenging quirk of his eyebrow. “Show me.”
Draco swallowed. “All right,” he said, trying to sound unaffected and failing miserably. “I guess I better join them then.”
I recall you not being too enthusiastic about having children, more resigned to the idea than anything else? Is that still the case? If so, I bet you’ll change your mind once you’ve met Teddy. He really is the most adorable boy to have ever walked the earth.
The two friends seemed to be immersed in deep conversation, comparing notes and crosschecking them against what looked like a detailed diagram of the human body. None of them made any sign of being aware of Draco’s existence, so after a few moments of visual indulgence, Draco returned his attention to the phone, opening up the new message that waited for him just below last night’s text conversation.
“And you just eat it like that; slice on slice?” Arthur asked, curiosity sparkling in his pale blue eyes.
He hung his overcoat in the closet and walked down the hallway, pausing by Smaug’s room to check the fox’s food and water bowls, both good, and turning off the small telly in the corner playing animal videos.
It’s all it takes; a two-letter word, and my heart breaks. One broken whimper, and it shatters into a million tiny shards, each one sharp enough to cut through muscle, bone, sinew, veins. I want to say something. Anything. Something hopeful and consoling. But how do you talk when you can’t breathe? When no words seem enough? I want to tell you that it’s okay; that everything will be all right. But how can I, when it’s not; when it won’t?
The wheels were turning in his head a million kilometers per hour, coming up with thousands of possibilities he'd never even fathomed before.
She didn't say anything to that, just stood, hands clenched into fists by her sides and hair in disarray; Harry barely noticed the short black dress she had on. Closing her eyes, she took a deep breath. "Fine." She picked up her wand and grabbed a handful of Floo powder next to the fireplace. "I'm going to Ron and Hermione's without you, then; make sure you send them a card before their next anniversary. You're sleeping on the sofa tonight." She threw the powder down, stepped into the flames, stated her destination, and was gone in the blink of an eye.
Malfoy flashed him a knowing smirk; he leaned close to his partner across the desk, where Harry was busy filling out the paperwork from the case. "Do you still believe she's not cheating on you?" He raised a brow in suggestion.
Nodding, Malfoy reached into his robes and pulled out the file, flipping to the wanted poster. "Number 27, Wisteria Walk."
"That blood stain could have been anyone's, Potter. Some twat living on this floor could have cut himself and left that there." He ran his wand over the strand of hair he found, sending the sample back to the Ministry for analysis.
"As it happens, Potter, Blaise Zabini told me." He rose from the desk and opened the door, pausing just before exiting. "And he
Malfoy's eyes snapped up to meet his partners'; Harry had never noticed before just how beautifully grey-blue Malfoy's eyes were. "Well, Potter, it looks like you've got something there." There was another tapping on the window, and the same Ministry owl from earlier was back with another message. Malfoy let it in and took the letter, letting it fly back outside.
"Ah, the Weaslette finally came to her senses, did she?" He waved his wand in the air in a sweeping motion and let the wards down enough so Harry could enter; once his partner had stepped across the threshold, he put them up once more.
Harry's anger flared and the Snitch on his desk shattered again. "Why are you so intent on convincing me that she's cheating on me?"
Their lips finally met for their first blissful kiss, and it was everything Harry had imagined and more; Malfoy's lips were soft and fair, but firm and demanding. Harry ran his tongue along the crease of Malfoy's mouth, coaxing it open for him to explore; the blonde yielded and Harry was finally free to roam, tasting Malfoy's teeth, tongue, and cheeks. Malfoy cupped his hand behind Harry's neck, pulling him closer so they were pressed flush against each other; Harry wrapped his arms around Malfoy's waist to steady himself, and tugged so the blonde was lying atop him.
"I suppose the thought had crossed my mind, yes." Malfoy scowled at him. "Fine, I'll tell you." He put his elbows on his knees, leaning forward. "I got home and she was sitting on the couch; the first thing she says to me is 'You're late.' We were supposed to be going to Ron and Hermione's for dinner, but I had told her that work might keep me late." He sighed and ran a hand through his hair; he watched Malfoy watch the movement with a thrill of delight, but quickly squashed it down. "Then I guess I said something wrong, Godric forbid, and she went
"Potter, anything's fair game in there. But if you tamper with them and I walk out with blue hair tomorrow, don't think I'm going to let you live."
can take the stairs, Potter; I'll be taking the lift." He went over to the lifts and waited for a few seconds before one appeared with a small house elf operating it; he stepped in and said, "Flat 26B, please."
!" he breathed, turning around to run back into the room, but Ginny had already come out with the sheet wrapped around her naked body. One glance at the window had her eyes growing wide.
He arrived outside of a small house that had large bay windows on the front end and a well-tended garden under them. Harry stepped onto the lawn and hit the invisible barriers Malfoy had placed around the property.
Malfoy smirked at the quickness with which this statement was said, and leaned in close to kiss Harry again. "And just so you know, I don't plan on letting you go anytime soon. It took me this long to capture you finally…" He trailed off, obviously remembering something from long ago.
Harry grinned and led Malfoy in the right direction, clutching his wand in his hand tightly, on guard for anything unexpected to happen. They found themselves standing outside of number 27, and Harry suggested Malfoy go around back just in case Lucas was there and tried to escape. Malfoy nodded and disappeared around the side of the house.
Harry jumped up, wand at the ready, and ran outside. "Is this Lucas Tyler?" he demanded of Malfoy, but his partner shrugged.
After his shower, which was one of the best showers of his life, he ate dinner with Malfoy at the table in the kitchen, which was one of the best meals of his life. He had groaned as his teeth sank into the first bite of the creamy Alfredo sauce covering the fettuccine pasta that was cooked to al dente perfection. Malfoy had laughed, asking him if it was really that good. Harry's only response was to take another bite and positively orgasm.
home — brought back memories and emotions he hadn’t thought he’d missed. Moving photographs of people he once knew, trinkets from places he’d once frequented, objects the likes of which he’d once owned. A snitch laying amongst a random collection of knick-knacks in a bowl on the windowsill. A knocked-over stack of chocolate frog cards on the coffee table, presumably used as coasters.
A shiver rushes down Harry’s spine, making his entire body tremble with desire. Draco wants this. He wants
And now I sound like a whimpering arse. I’m sorry. I really don’t have any right to complain because I actually do have someplace else to go if I wanted to. And I probably should, either way. I’m just not particularly looking forward to it.
Realisation seemed to dawn on Harry then, and Draco watched entranced as a blush rose up his neck and tinged his cheeks an intriguing shade of pink.
Harry looks up into Draco's eyes, just inches from his own, the steely-grey irises hardly visible due to the immense size of the blown pupils.
I wasn’t expecting to see you tonight, had just settled in for a quiet evening in front of the telly when Michael Aspel was suddenly interrupted by the doorbell. There was a brief moment when I contemplated ignoring it, unable to think of anyone who’d pop by my flat unannounced like this on a Sunday evening. After all, I just came home from the Burrow an hour ago, just back from spending the day with most of the people who are otherwise prone to come over. And even if you entered my mind — not that you ever really leave it — I never thought you’d be the one I’d find on my doorstep as I left my comfy couch to answer the door.
Okay, so, Snape. I’m not saying he wasn’t a death eater; he was. I saw his mark too, and I can very well imagine him bowing before Riddle, but here’s the deal. He didn’t want to kill Dumbledore. In fact, he even begged Dumbledore to not have to go through with it, but Dumbledore insisted. He was already dying, you see, and instead of withering away, he decided to make his death useful to the cause. So, he had Snape kill him that night, hitting two pixies with one stone. One, he relieved you from the burden of having a murder on your conscience, and two, he secured Snape’s position with Riddle. Because nothing shows loyalty better than killing off the leader of the opposing side, right? Yes, it was a set-up. And a quite successful one at that.
“You know what I think?” Draco’s voice is soft as he leans closer to place his hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing it gently. “I think you should go for it. You never know, maybe he’s…”
Harry looked around at the rapidly filling trash. “And you don’t mind that Charlie lives like this?”
Molly smiled and nodded. Yes, and in the corner are their two children, Fred and Roxanne. They have inherited their mother’s dark hair, so it’s easy to pick them out in the crowd. Over there are Fleur and Bill’s two girls, Victoire and Dominique. Their baby, Louis, is asleep upstairs. And over there, talking to Hermione, is Molly, Percy’s daughter. The woman next to them is his wife, Audrey.” She flashed Draco a grin that reminded him of the one Charlie often gave when he was teasing the interns. “Are you taking notes? There’ll be a quiz later.”
They sat on the sofa in the living room after they cleaned up, Harry insisting on helping because he was intruding on Malfoy's privacy, and talked about their next case.
"Yeah? Well, excuse me for having a demanding job so I can pay all our bills and still afford to buy you the stupid stuff you want on the side." Harry had had just about enough of their bickering; three long years of it.
Shrugging, Malfoy rose from his spot. "Suit yourself." He walked into the kitchen and hollered back out to Harry, "I was going to make something for dinner, but if you want to order something, that would be okay."
Opening the door to his and Ginny's shared flat, he was surprised and annoyed to find her sitting on the couch, arms crossed across her chest and glaring at him. "You're late," she snapped.
"Well, we should still analyze it." He pulled out his wand and waved it over the stain; it glowed blue for a second and then returned to normal. "There, now we just have to wait for an owl from the Ministry on the results."
Harry chuckled; the blonde could be damned impatient and demanding, quite a lethal combination. "If they were all different then our job would require less talent, leaving it in the hands of half-witted witches and wizards." He decided to completely ignore the rant Malfoy had given before, not wanting to anger his partner any more than he already was.
Shaking his head to free himself from his day-dreaming, he walked over and crouched down low with Malfoy. The blonde raised his hand, and in between his index finger and thumb he held a short black strand of hair. "What's that?"
Malfoy was already shuffling through some papers, and found the one he was looking for. "Right here, Potter," he said, pointing at the page. "The Ministry sends out a missing persons poster every time something like this happens, and there has been a sighting of Lucas Tyler somewhere outside of Muggle London."
Harry's heart did a happy flip when Malfoy said he was worried about him, but he blew it off; he hadn't actually said it aloud, after all. "You mean that
Malfoy visibly relaxed, obviously not wanting to comment on the fact that he was worried about the brunette. "Of course, Potter."
The kiss was over too soon, however, when Malfoy pulled away and gazed down at Harry. "So you don't have anywhere to stay now, do you?"
Malfoy pushed past Harry, walking over to the wall with the biggest blood splatter on it; he pulled out the file and found the corresponding picture. "This blood was already analyzed. It belongs to Amelia Tyler." He stooped down low and ran his finger along the floor where it met the wall; Harry had a hard time not staring at his partner's form, but how had he never noticed the arse that Malfoy had on him? "Potter, I think I found something."
Thirty seconds later, Ginny Potter née Weasley appeared in his office doorway. "Why did you keep me waiting? You don't want to talk to me?
"Is completely legitimate and should not be thrown away as a possibility just because you're homophobic."
"Of course not," he said through a clenched jaw. "Why couldn't you tell me this through a Floo call or an owl?"
"Well, I think we should look for Lucas Tyler first. They were best mates after all; maybe he'd have some idea of where he is."
"Now you're starting to make sense, Potter." He placed the model he had been toying with – a tiny pewter phoenix – back onto the desk and straightened his robes. "Send me a memo when you've completed the paperwork; I'll meet you in my office when you're ready to start on the next investigation." Malfoy swept out of the room, robes swishing behind him and fluttering out the door behind him.
Harry took this opportunity to buck his hips up into Malfoy's, receiving a surprised yelp; the brunette chuckled. "I'm not going
"No, you know what, enjoy yourself, Ginny. If this is what you really want, you can have it. Because you and I are done." He walked back out of the doorway, leaving the door on the floor. "I'll send someone over for my stuff and I'll have the Ministry owl the divorce papers over. Goodbye." And he
"Which of the products in the shower am I allowed to use?" he shot back, not able to hide the smirk.
"Yes. I'll get you a sheet to cover up with." He went down the hallway, opened the closet, and pulled out a large, comfy-looking down blanket; he brought it back and handed it to his partner. "Well, Potter, good night."
It’s all so peaceful, Harry’s just about to doze off when his makeshift pillow suddenly starts trembling under him.
, Harry mused as he entered the sitting room with three steaming cups floating in front of him. Draco was still handsome, though, with all those perfectly trimmed curls and his long, lean legs stretched out like that towards the fireplace. He looked so content where he sat in Harry’s favourite armchair, as if there wasn’t another place he ever wanted to be other than in Harry’s sitting room. Draco looked like he belonged.
“Well… I shouldn’t keep…” Draco gestures vaguely towards Harry’s unready state. “Talk to you tomorrow?”
Draco sucks in a sharp breath, then tries to look down at the tree which is now back in its previous, bare state. “I can’t— Let me see your neck, Harry. I want to see what it looks like.”
It hasn’t been completely abandoned since Walburga died — I believe I mentioned the Order of the Phoenix used it as HQ during the war? — but apart from Sirius staying here for about a year while he was in hiding, it’s true no one has really lived in this house, not really. And it wasn’t like Sirius ever liked being here, which isn’t strange considering his past and what this house likely represented to him. It was lawfully his, but at the same time, he had been disowned by his own mother, blasted off the family tree tapestry in the 1st-floor drawing-room, and I don’t know if the house remembered that and decided to stay loyal to Walburga rather than him, but it sure as hell didn’t seem like the house liked him very much. Not that the feeling wasn’t mutual.
Hannah grabbed both of his shoulders and gave him a little shake. “Pull yourself together, Draco. You’ll be fine. You’re still the one who saved him, right?”
Draco cringed. He’d never used the expression before in his life and it sounded terribly awkward coming out of his mouth. “Anyway,” he drawled after clearing his throat, “your friend seems to think you’re struggling with it; that something”— or rather,
"Ugh, you need to shave," Draco mutters. "If you'd just use the Shaving Charm I taught you, it'd stay smooth all day."
With nothing to do and nowhere to go, he usually didn’t mind taking on the Friday shifts, even ending up trading them with other colleagues on the rare occasion he wasn’t already scheduled to work. Like this week, when he’d agreed to swap his Saturday shift with Mandy whose sister was visiting from Wales and had insisted on a night on the town. An agreement he deeply regretted now as the afternoon dragged on, seemingly with no end in sight.
She sighed and rested her head on his, and the entire thing made Harry smile with contentment. This was what it was all about. This was what they'd fought for. Family, friends, a future to plan for.
The other part of me, the one that’s looked forward to Ron and me being auror partners and fighting evil together for the rest of our lives, is not as thrilled by the idea. I mean, I’m quite sure I still want to become an auror, but how will reality ever measure up to my expectations now? When I’ve imagined my future with the DMLE, I’ve always envisioned us doing it together, him and me, come rain or shine. Now what? What if I’m partnered with a jerk, or a total bore? Or even worse, a fawning fan… But it’s not like I have that many options, do I? I mean, what else is there for me to do? Fighting dark wixen is the only thing I’m good for, the only career I’ve ever considered. I don’t know, I guess I just need some time to adjust to the idea of doing it without him. What do you want to do when you grow up?
“Harry…” Draco breathes, clutching Harry’s hips with both hands as Harry starts in on a fresh trail of wet, sloppy kisses up Draco’s throat while rolling his hips slowly over Draco’s crotch. “What are you doing? I thought we were going to—”
Harry was waiting on the other side, and he held out his hand as if to steady Draco when he emerged. Draco took it, standing up straight, but his confusion must have been visible because Harry shrugged.
No, I wasn’t homeless. (Can you hear my eyes rolling, Your Highness?) And no, I’m certainly not after any ‘pity points’, especially from you, but as I’ve mentioned before, my childhood really wasn’t the sunshine and rainbows you still seem to think it was. It’s not a topic I generally like talking about, though, with anybody, ever, so I hope you’ll excuse me if I ask for a raincheck on this one. It’s not that I don’t want to tell you about it, not really. In fact, the more I think of it, the more I’m convinced that I probably should. How else will I ever be able to make you drop those preconceived notions you have about me? Just not right now, okay? Not right here at the Burrow, just before I’m supposed to join the others downstairs.
Your white-blond hair stands out like a beacon in the dark, making you look almost ethereal. Your skin-tight jeans hug your form in all the right places and the sheer fabric of your shirt is plastered to your sweaty skin, outlining every dip and curve of your toned torso. You look positively gorgeous. You always do. But somehow, there’s even more to you when you’re in this state. You look confident, dishevelled, carefree — and happier than I’ve ever seen you before.
And that’s not even counting the only ones whose opinion I actually do care about. Like Ron, who is vicariously living out his childhood auror aspirations through me these days, and Hermione… You don’t know her all that well yet, but let me tell you, you do not want to be on the receiving end of her Frown of Disappointment. It’s like the worst mix of disapproval, pity, annoyance, and frustration, all rolled into one. I can already hear her chiding interrogation: ‘Oh, Harry, what did you do?’, ‘Without a backup plan? Whatever were you thinking?’, followed by, ‘Merlin, Harry, you can’t just… You must think about…’, and the million-galleon question: ‘What are you going to do?’
Teddy didn’t seem to listen, though, and Harry did his best to keep up with him, almost tripping over his own feet as he sidestepped a little girl who was clutching her mother’s hand tightly.
“The marquee is out the door and to the right; you can’t miss it. Please do not wander away from the party areas. There are wards up to keep both you and the dragons safe, but if we see you trying to go too close, you will be evicted from the party and not invited back. At ten till midnight, everyone will gather in the viewing area and there will be fireworks and champagne on the hour. Please don’t litter, and remember that this is a wildlife refuge area, so treat it accordingly.”
A commotion outside the doorway had Draco jumping up and moving into the corner, sure he’d be reprimanded for being in Charlie’s private room. Nobody paid him any attention, however, as the room filled with ginger-haired family, quickly going from small to cramped as the newcomers took up more space than seemingly possible. As he watched them enter, Draco realised he was somewhat familiar with most of them already, either through school or their work during and after the war. A disconcerting thought, especially as they all most likely had preconceived notions about him from the past. He may have made peace with his old Gryffindor rivals during that eighth year they all attended at Hogwarts, but that didn’t mean they’d parted as friends or that they’d passed on his apologies to their relatives.
Malfoy smirked, and damn it, if it didn't make him ten times more attractive, Harry didn't know what would.
"Well, then, you should feel right at home." Malfoy stood from his desk, grabbed Harry's shoulder, and
, or didn't you notice the ring on her fucking finger as you no doubt made her use her hand for things other than holding onto the bed sheets?"
The place was a mess: there were picture frames shattered on the floor, papers thrown around in disarray, and blood smears on the walls. "Merlin…" Harry breathed, stepping into the room. "Well, there was certainly a struggle."
Smirking and sitting on the edge of Harry's desk, Malfoy pointed to his robes where the Ministry's insignia was printed. "I work here, Potter; and, as much as it pains me to say, I
Harry blinked, not understanding what all the words meant, only knowing that this was the best tea he had ever tasted. "It's delicious."
Malfoy reached out and touched the blood stain, but it was completely dry. "It must have been there for a while. It might not even be one of the Tylers'."
Harry awoke to the soft light of the morning sun, the smell of fresh tea, and the sound of sizzling bacon. He rose from the sofa, stretched his arms above his head, and padded into the kitchen, where he found Malfoy darting around the small area with a plastic spatula in one hand and a fork in the other. "'Morning," Harry greeted, taking a seat at the table.
," he hissed; Harry had the sudden urge to lunge forward and kiss Malfoy, but restrained himself. Where had that thought come from, anyway?
Harry blinked several times and then smirked a very un-Harry smirk. "It seems to me, Malfoy, that we not only have a case of domestic violence on our hands, but I think our victim was fooling around."
"Harry!" she exclaimed, as though she just noticed he was in the room. "I didn't know you'd be home so early…"
They ate breakfast in silence, save for the occasional "pass the marmalade, please" or "more bacon?" Afterwards, they went back into the parlor to discuss the case once again.
Summoned by the disturbance of his shields, Malfoy stepped out of the front door with his wand at the ready; he lowered it when he saw Harry standing with his bag slung over his shoulder.
. They had been so caught up in questioning Lucas Tyler, who finally – through questionable methods – revealed the whereabouts of Thomas Edwards; they tracked the man down and apprehended him. The trial had proved to be long and quite boring, as Edwards did not want to answer any of their questions and seemed content to stall as long as possible. Lucas Tyler, though he claimed to have nothing to do with the murder of his wife, was exposed to the Wizengamot as an accomplice to the crime, even going so far as to provide safe-house for Edwards. It seemed that when he found out his wife was cheating on him with his best mate, instead of trying to stop Edwards, he allied with him; realizing his actions after it was already too late, Lucas fled.
The dreams returned. Sometimes several nights in a row, sometimes weeks apart, but always the same; the same man; the same sensations; the same feelings there to comfort him whenever he woke up. Safety. Love. Desire. Acceptance. Care.
Harry could easily drown in those enigmatic eyes, glistening like liquid silver and currently dark with promise. Yet, his own eyes close of their own accord as Draco leans in and finally —
Draco tilts his head to look at him, grey pools of inscrutability catching Harry’s gaze from the corners of his eyes. Harry counts five unsteady heartbeats before Draco finally speaks.
“I’m not sure what Charlie’s told you, but Molly lost two brothers, twins, in the first war. Gideon and Fabian were friends of mine and good fighters, but, well, it was hard on her when they were killed. When she lost Fred in the final battle, she almost didn’t recover. Losing a loved one is hard, but losing a child… It’s something nobody should ever have to endure.”
“You have feelings for someone?” Draco sounds surprised, intrigued, but not nearly as gloating as Harry had anticipated. “Who?”
“Right.” Harry’s jaw twitched. His eyes were intriguingly dark, but it seemed like he too wanted to pretend nothing had happened. “Can I escort you to the party tonight? I can Side-along you.”
Draco leans down the inch or two necessary to reach Harry’s mouth, and his lips are warm and pliant as they brush lightly over Harry’s, setting him on fire with nothing but a barely-there touch. A little more pressure, a faint needy whine, and then Draco plunges. His hands curl around Harry’s cheeks, taking Harry’s face between them, his fingers stroking over Harry’s jaw while his wet tongue outlines Harry’s lips and then dips inside.
Yes, Kingsley Shacklebolt is the new Minister. And maybe you’re right, maybe I shouldn’t have bothered him with my questions, but since he’s the one I know best in that bureaucratic nightmare of a Ministry — except Arthur, who’s in the wrong department to be able to help me get any answers — it only felt natural to turn to him. And I’m sure he doesn’t mind; he’s a good guy.
. Draco had anticipated this inquiry, of course, and he already had the answer prepared at the tips of his thumbs. “All right, here goes nothing…”
You really think another dose of my sloppy hungover writing would be able to off you? If I only knew my words were that powerful; I should have struck up a correspondence with Riddle years ago. Thanks for the tip, though. I’ll keep it in mind for the next time you infuriate me enough to make me want to go over there and strangle you in your sleep. Death by grammar; now wouldn’t that be something?
Apparently, though, my brain-to-mouth filter had switched off earlier in the evening, because next thing I know, Nott and Zabini (who just happened to be close enough at the time to notice my unintentional muttering) were staring at me, incredulous. So I told them. Not right there in the pub, of course, or anyone could have listened in, but later, on the walk back to the castle. I had no idea how they’d react, but once I told them, they were actually kind of cool about it. At least after Zabini was done with his usual teasing banter. You know how he is. ‘So that’s why you’re always in such a good mood on Saturdays? Interesting.’ With that smug smirk of his that makes you want to thump him in the mouth. Insufferable twat is what he is.
The burn is sharp, stretching Harry around Draco's girth, and when Harry winces, Draco stills, letting his mate get used to the feeling. It's a lot. Harry knew it would be, but somehow, he didn't realise it would be quite so much.
PS Yes, I’m fucking sure his name was Tom Riddle. Tom Marvolo Riddle, in fact. His mother was a Gaunt. Riddle was his father’s name. His
close to crashing straight into him. Frowning, he followed the boy’s gaze to the other end of the square. There, on a two-foot-high podium next to the gigantic Christmas tree, all dressed up in white-trimmed red, with shiny black boots and a long curly beard. Draco.
Harry sighs with pleasure as he sinks deeper into the cushioned chair, rolling his shoulders and breathing in the heavenly aroma of Vindaloo. Every muscle in his body aches from the exertion of their afternoon activity. “So, what’s today?”
Draco ended the call and glanced over at Smaug who was now inspecting the towel-covered bowl. “Looks like I’m taking a trip out to the Reserve tonight.”
family. What do you think I should do? Should I go tonight and keep pretending, or should I ruin everyone’s Christmas, again, and tell them the truth?”
Charlie was clearly waiting for a reaction, though, so Draco scrambled for a response. “I suppose just a bit for Christmas would be understandable.”
Draco could sense those familiar emerald eyes burning the back of his head as he worked the espresso machine, could feel them prickling the skin under his white dress shirt. He hadn’t been too keen when Ms Cortado handed out their new work uniforms; there wasn’t much a slim-fitted shirt could do to hide any absence of strong shoulders and bulging biceps. Not that Draco was in any way ashamed of his slender body. He wasn’t. But a few more kilos of muscle surely wouldn’t have gone amiss. Eventually, he’d come to terms with the soft fabric clinging to his torso, and nowadays it didn’t bother him much. Except for when those green eyes made him feel like he was on display.
Reaching out a tentative hand, Harry finally allowed himself to touch, letting his fingertips trace the wrinkles on Draco’s forehead, brushing the pad of his thumb lightly over Draco’s rosy cheek, trailing tentative fingers through the soft curls of his long white beard. Under his palm, Draco’s chest heaved in sync with every shallow inhale and Harry found himself adjusting his own breathing to follow the same rhythm.
I never thought of it that way, but yeah, now you say it, I guess I was a bit like a house-elf to them, albeit without the no-clothes rule and the magically enforced self-punishment routine. (Maybe that’s why I found it so easy to sympathise with Dobby?) Yeah, they did have me cook for them almost daily, basically from the day I was tall enough to reach for the things I needed to make myself useful in the kitchen. I usually ate with them at the table, though, if I wasn’t locked up in my cupboard or, later, my room. I didn’t do all the cleaning, just the heavier stuff my aunt couldn’t be bothered with, and she didn’t trust me with the dusting. (I think she feared I’d break some of her gaudy knick-knacks if she ever let me loose with a feather-duster in her house.) I did the laundry too, and most of the gardening, although, that wasn’t much of a burden since it was nice to get out in the fresh air where Dudley usually preferred not to go and therefore left me alone.
“Yes…?” Harry hissed, nearly arching off the bed as Draco flicked his tongue over the sensitive nipple.
The words had barely left him before Draco kissed him again, slowly, tenderly, achingly sweet. “I’ll take care of you, love,” he said. “Just relax and I’ll take care of you.”
Draco says, his voice serious. "Merlin, Harry, you are so responsive; I swear I could come from nothing but the noises you make. And your face? You're so bloody beautiful. So perfect."
“I—” I have no idea. “The right one?” You frown, glancing down at the— “Or the left one?” I add, earning myself a sharp look from your steel-grey eyes. “Oh, for— I don’t know, okay? Just…”
. Surely, that high-pitched noise wasn’t any of Draco’s doing, was it? Cheeks hot, he cleared his throat and brought his voice back down from the dogs-only territory. “She’s
The hum from the fridge was his only companion as he sat there in the dim light from the street below, thoughts swirling, heart racing, eyes fixed on the screen for what felt like hours. Fragments of an old saying, something about watching a cauldron, flitted through his mind without making a whit of sense. Then…
Harry doesn’t really know what to think but eventually decides to give Malfoy a fair chance before writing it all off as poppycock.
Harry grinned. “Nah, I’ll be okay. Besides, I’m comfortable this way.” He made a point of looking Draco up and down and gave a little nod in Draco’s direction. “You look nice, too.” The pleased sensation fluttering in Draco’s stomach turned sour in an instant as Harry frowned and added, “Are you wearing makeup?”
Seriously though, I felt like a fucking prize animal at a cattle market, and honestly, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to stomach having to go through anything like that again. Do you really think they would try to make me?
“Yes, Draco, you are,” Harry insisted and reached up, chasing any further arguments from Draco’s mind with another bone-melting kiss.
Draco’s voice broke, and his heated words ricocheted off the tiles, leaving the air trembling as the first tears broke free and pummelled down his cheeks. He was so tired, so fucking tired, and every muscle in his body had to work overtime to keep him standing upright.
I think you need to hear it — that arranged marriage nonsense sounds blooody archaic and narrow-minded to me, like something belonging to the fucking past and nothing that should ever dictate the lifes of anyone
you’ll find a way to make it happen. What other career ideas do you have? You don’t dream of flying pro anymore? You’ve always been a crazy-good seeker, Malfoy, even if you never managed to beat me to the snitch.
“No…” Draco’s arm tightened around his waist and Harry was sorely tempted to suck that pouting lip into his mouth. It looked delectable.
George merely laughed, and with a finger wiggle wave and a cheerful “Toodle-oo”, he was gone, leaving the door open behind him.
I do think I have what it takes to be a good auror, though, and I’m certain Ron and I will make a brilliant team. We have been fighting evil ever since our first year at Hogwarts and we know each other inside and out. I encourage him whenever he’s wary and he holds me back when I’m being too reckless. We complement one another perfectly, and between my determination and his strategic thinking, I’m quite sure there’s nothing we can’t face together.
Draco barely had time to process what happened before another curse, on his right this time, whizzed past him at eye-level. A crystal vase exploded mere feet in front of him, jerking him out of his stupor. Heart pounding, Draco dropped to the floor just in time to avoid the next curse from grazing his hip.
“I can’t! He’s going to tell them the truth, and they’re all going to hate me. Merlin, I wish Sirius hadn’t talked me into waiting. I can’t do this. I
Her eyes widened. “Because you said you were going to marry him. I mean, you were out of it, but you were talking about not wanting to have a crispy groom.”
As of yet, it hasn’t shown any signs of noticing me, though; always too fixated on you and the men who dare to come near you. Like the burly one you danced with a few weeks ago, who pressed his broad chest against your back and curled his grabby hands around your hips as he ground his crotch against your arse and sucked on your neck while you rested your head on his shoulder. Or the bearded one who lured you into that dark corner over there a fortnight ago and pinned you to the wall as he devoured your mouth, leaving you with a fierce stubble burn that you whined about for days afterwards and yet refused to spell away. Or the one I still refuse to acknowledge, the hottie who smiled at you so salaciously last week as he took you by the hand and led you through the crowd towards the loos, desire burning hot and black in his eyes.
.” His voice cracked, but he went on. “The Weasleys were there for me. They took me in, made me a part of the family, and Molly and I were able to grieve together.”
A bark of laughter rang through the room, Sirius being anything but quiet. “Both,” he finally said with a grin. He let that sink in before continuing. “I overheard you the other night when you came to visit Charlie.”
An image unfurls in Harry’s mind, an image of himself, naked, his legs wrapped around Draco’s hips while large, white wings smelling of caramel flap through the open sky, keeping them aloft.
Hannah greeted Draco as he returned to Charlie’s floor. He must have had a particular look on his face because she approached him and pulled him into a hug.
My heart aches, pain searing through my body as I take in the defeat in your hushed tone. You sound so small, so helpless, and all I want to do is take you in my arms and hold you close while telling you everything’s going to be okay. I press my nails into my palms to prevent myself from reaching out.
Draco shrugged, then cleared his throat as he handed her the gift bag. “A fruitcake. Though I fear it’ll get lost amongst all your amazing pies and such. Maybe just save it for tea another day.”
“I hate you,” he repeated through clenched teeth, the statement sorely lacking any trace of his earlier venom.
“I’m not ‘good’,” he ventures in an attempt to lighten the mood. “Just because my fans think I’m a saint, doesn’t mean it’s true. You of all people should know that by now.”
“I guess…” Draco said hesitantly, because, yes, it did make sense. He’d just never thought Harry would actually be willing to ever forgive him his past wrongdoings.
“Let it go, Hermione,” he insisted, then turned back to his textbook. “I need to get this spell right, so, with all due respect, stop bothering me.”
“He usually comes with me to the Reserve and gets to run around and explore; everyone there knows him and spoils him to no end. Anyway, he recently hit his sexual maturity, and he’s not scheduled to be neutered until mid-January, so I’ve been keeping him in the flat. It’s made him get into more trouble than usual, though, thus the leather last night.”
Harry’s hands ventured up to cradle Draco’s heated cheeks and he angled their heads to allow for the kiss to deepen. Sucking in Draco’s lower lip between his own, Harry begged for entry in the only way his brain could manage at the time; with a whine so desperate and needy he’d be loath to admit himself capable of anything like it for the rest of his life. But capable he was — apparently, Draco brought it out of him — and thankfully, Draco didn’t seem to disapprove. On the contrary, he readily opened his mouth and flicked out the tip of his tongue to meet Harry’s. The connection sent a flush of arousal straight to Harry’s core, igniting every fibre of his body until he felt ready to soar broomless through the sky.
Draco had never enjoyed a workout session more, and once wrung out and sated, they fell asleep in each other’s arms, all cuddled up under Harry’s luxurious duvet. The next morning, Harry insisted they’d continue the study session from the previous night, with Draco on his back this time, but, not surprisingly, they didn’t even last more than a few minutes before they got distracted with other, far more interesting activities. Not that Harry had really needed the study help in the first place — he’d done his homework and would surely have aced the exam regardless — but Draco was only too happy to play along.
Harry rolled his eyes. “As much as Ron likes to think he understands Parseltongue, you shouldn’t believe everything your boyfriend tells you. And Orion is just teasing me, just like the rest of you. And although I have no clue what I’m saying in my sleep, you’d think it’d be okay seeing as how I’m actually
. It didn’t matter anyway, since Draco took the opportunity to silence him with another brutal kiss, invading Harry’s mouth with his hot, wet tongue. Harry thrust against him and gasped as Draco’s hard erection rubbed against his own through several layers of clothing.
supposed to open until next Saturday. I’m still unsure where they draw the line for your approved correspondence but I keep my fingers crossed it’ll make it through the Ministry scans. Please, let me know if you receive it.
Harry’s face flashed through Draco’s mind, but he pushed it away. Sirius, maybe. Sirius was friends with Shacklebolt, wasn’t he?
Draco peered over at the man. He’d never seen this stranger before; how could he possibly know Draco’s parents well enough to assert anything like that?
“Yes! No! It’s not like that. It’s just… Charlie’s not the type to settle down and get married, okay? And frankly, he doesn’t seem like your type, either. He’s messy and selfish, and you’re not even willing to take him to fucking Florence with you, so why would you want to marry him?”
The look on Harry’s face made it impossible to get another word out. Draco needed to get away from him, from all of it. He needed to leave before he broke into a million pieces right here on the floor of the Ministry’s Office of Civil Affairs. He needed to get home.
Draco nods and takes a deep breath. "Just another moment and I think I'll have it under control. If I move too quickly, I'll come on the spot and it'll all be over."
I had planned to marry Charlie, but I married Harry instead. Thank Merlin my mother was right; life doesn’t always turn out the way we plan. And Harry took me back to Florence, to the city I once thought I’d never be able to enjoy again, and he proved me wrong. He’s given me all I’ve ever wanted, and more; a home, a family, friendship, companionship — and an everlasting love.
Draco looked over at Harry who was intent on the sky, the corners of his lips curved into a slight smile. He considered the handshake from earlier, the laughter, the humming, and realised he really didn’t want to be angry with this man.
He was getting ready to marry this man when he was pretty damned sure there was at least one reason why he shouldn’t, even if he could hardly bring himself to admit it.
Draco wasn’t picky; any sign of life would suffice — Draco was only vaguely aware of the happenings in the open space in the centre of the courtyard. His peripheral vision registered movements, someone charging towards the Dark Lord and dropping to the ground, something falling from the sky, something bursting into flames. He heard the Dark Lord’s voice and others’ shouts, and then the ground started to tremble under his feet, vibrations likely connected to the approaching rumble of roofs and impossibly heavy footfalls that had everyone around him shift and turn and mumble and—
He wrote it over four rows, intending for it to reveal itself gradually as Harry drank his sickly-sweet brew. Then, mustering up his resolve, he took a deep, calming breath and added the final four words, biting back a silly smile as they stared back at him from the bottom of the cup. A swarm of pixies overtook his insides as he filled both cups, veiling his secret message under the black surface, hiding it like a lost pirate treasure just waiting to be found by his boyfriend’s emerald eyes.
As Harry walked over to sit in his chair, Draco was unable to look away from the sight of him in his scruffy blue jeans and washed-out, once-black t-shirt.
He had walked up to the Owlery, only to find Malfoy there, alone. He hadn’t been in the letter room, the heated space where students could find writing supplies and owl treats, but was standing with the hooting birds out in the roost.
“He…?” That’s why you hadn’t worn your coat when you showed up, and why you’d been so thoroughly drowned? The bastard had made you walk all the way to the gate to get past the wards to be able to Disapparate. “In the driving rain?”
"Mmm," Draco says, opening his mouth to suck at Harry's tongue. He pulls back after too short a moment, bumping his nose into Harry's. "Did you bring your broom?"
Yes, you dimwit, I have indeed released you from the secret quill-pal closet. And apart from Ron, who I already knew would be a challenge and a half, I’d like to think they’ve all had time to process it by now. To be honest, though, I can’t say for sure. Thing is, Draco, we’ve all been so busy these past few weeks, what with studies and work and everything else, that I’ve barely seen anyone but my fellow auror trainees since that day when everyone found out, not even Ron and Hermione.
Harry nodded as he swallowed another sip of wine, his mind suddenly reeling. "We're going to do this, aren't we? Live together."
There are still times when I have a hard time believing this is real, that this amazing man is actually my husband. If someone had told me back in school that we’d one day end up together, I’d probably curse them as punishment for their abysmal joke. But now, being with him feels like the most natural thing in the world, as if this was how it was supposed to be all along. It took us a while to get here, and life surely provided some unexpected twists and turns on the way, but here we are. Together. In Florence. On our honeymoon.
Harry doesn’t bother to come up with an answer but simply glares up at Draco from the corner of his eye. Because damned it if that isn’t exactly his problem: his pathetic romanticism constantly feeding his futile fantasies.
He fought the urge to do it again, figuring stroking his arse probably wouldn’t be the smartest thing to do with a line of customers waiting by the counter. Especially considering he was currently facing the espresso machine, his back to any questioning eyes.
Instead, I lay down beside you, curling my body against yours, my chest against your back, my thighs behind your legs, wrapping my arm around you and hoping my presence will say all the things my words aren’t able to. My hand comes to rest over your beating heart, moving with the ebb and flow of your ragged breathing. I’m still not sure whether you really want me here, whether you mind me witnessing your tears, but then you clasp my hand with your own, clutching it tightly to your chest, and I know I’ve done the right thing.
Draco felt his face flush a bit. “Well, can’t set your recovery back by having you feel too sorry for yourself, now can we?”
My dismissive growl doesn’t seem to have any effect on him, though, apart from the flash of pure want in his clear blue eyes.
“I’m just saying,” Arthur’s voice intruded, booming yet powerless to break the eye contact between them, “that if rubber ducks don’t do anything, they should come with a disclaimer.”
Harry rolls his eyes and reaches for Draco's cock. Draco sucks in a sharp breath as Harry urges him closer, caressing the hard length and bringing it to his waiting hole. "Now," he begs.
“Mum, stop, I’m fine,” Charlie’s voice came from the bed where Molly had a handkerchief out and was trying to wipe away some imaginary spot from his face. Charlie squirmed like a small child, but his grin belied his enjoyment at the coddling. “So, everyone’s here, huh?”
Stop constantly fishing for confirmations about our friendship as if you still can’t believe it’s real. (Yes, I noticed you calling them that — my ‘real friends’ — as if what we have is somehow fake and you’re just an imaginary playmate the kind of which lonely kids like our younger selves make up when they’re bored out of their minds.) Stop talking as if I’m going to ditch you the moment someone asks me to. As if I had no integrity whatsoever. Do you really think that little of me? No, as far as I’m concerned, our friendship isn’t going anywhere, and you had better start believing it too before I get tired of convincing you about it and actually ditch you for being such an unbearable, daft prat.
He took a glass of wine from a passing tray and thanked the server, then set to his task. It was time to mingle.
That was all the invitation Harry needed. In one swift move, he was straddling Draco’s legs, his hands roaming over Draco’s bare skin, only pausing momentarily to squeeze the swell of Draco’s arse cheeks through thin fabric before venturing further, exploring the expanse of Draco’s back.
Draco had come here to catch a break, and possibly, very likely, to break down. Grown-up Potter, with his false concern and his fake pride — and his fucking entourage of futile childhood fantasies — was the last thing Draco needed right now.
The jazz club Draco took him to tonight was about the swankiest place Harry’s ever set foot in, and the cocktails they’ve been drinking have made him tipsier than he’s been in quite a while. He knows those conniving things are nearly pure alcohol, but it’s hard to keep that in mind when they taste so sweet and look so pretty. Also, it’s easy to lose count when your thoughts are occupied elsewhere, like with the pleasure of your company, his glorious wit, his ravishing looks.
With a loud shout of Draco's name, he comes, spilling across the fist that keeps moving around him, drawing out every last sliver of pleasure he might have left in his body. It seems infinite, as though it'll go on forever, and in some vague little part of his mind, he recognises that Draco has reached his own crest, filling Harry with his release. Perhaps it's this notion that keeps Harry's orgasm going for so long.
Come to think of it, I doubt you even knew Teddy existed, did you? Well, he’s Andromeda’s grandson and, I guess, your cousin. He’s not even a year old, born only a few weeks before the final battle, and since both his parents were killed that night, Andromeda is his guardian now. When she’s teaching, Molly Weasley takes care of him, but when he’s not at the Burrow, I’m helping Andromeda with him as much as I can. He’s such a ray of sunshine, that kid, and I swear his laugh is enough to make anyone smile, despite how low they may feel otherwise.
“Draco, darling!” Slyvia squealed and stepped back, making a show of raking her eyes all over him. “I’ll be out for the night and just thought I’d stop by on my way down. I must say, you look absolutely delicious; I could eat you right up.”
I’m sorry to tell you neither the Arrows nor the Falcons managed to take home the cup in the end. When it mattered the most, your team was simply too slow and mine was embarrassingly uncoordinated. Instead, the Tornados won, much to Justin’s and Parkinson’s delight. We all followed the final round over the WWN the other day and it was a real nail-biter, even if the wireless doesn’t allow you to actually see anything. (Why the wizarding world still haven’t been able to invent a magical version of the muggle telly is beyond me.) Sure, the wireless is better than nothing, I guess, and their commentators are undoubtedly doing their best to relate the goings-on, but no matter what they do, they’ll never be able to compete with the live experience. Not that I’ve been to many pro matches. (Actually, apart from the World Cup five years ago, I still haven’t been to a single one.) I bet you have been to more matches than you can count, haven’t you?
Also, Cotton! Excuse me, but I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a more adorable cat in my life. He looks so content sprawled out like that, no doubt enjoying the warmth of the sun better than any human ever could. And the name, Lord Cotton Candy? (That’s American for candy floss, isn’t it?) I’d say three-year-olds should probably be in charge of all pet naming procedures from now on. You think I could get the Wizengamot to sign off on a stipulation like that?
Sounds like Narcissa is doing all right, all things considered. Good. I’m glad to know you have her there with you. Hopefully, the rest of the year won’t be as hard on you now that you have some company. I don’t know if she was offered the same deal as you were, but I totally get your reasoning for not wanting to tell her about our letters. If it were me, I’d be hesitant too.
It’s as if all the anger raging within me vanishes at the flick of a wand, leaving me with nothing but a yearning desire to make you feel safe, secure, loved. I take in your wretched form and swallow around the lump in my throat. I want to sit down beside you, to drape my arm around your shoulders and lay you down on the purple bedspread. I want to hug you close and stroke your hair, and hum soothing melodies in your ear until you eventually fall asleep. I want to kiss your eyelids, hot and wet from the tears I see reflected in the dim light. Want to kiss your rosy cheeks and the pale, pointy tip of your nose.
“A lot of what he said didn’t make much sense at the time, but it cheered me up all the same, making me relax enough to eventually fall asleep.” Draco took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. “When I woke up the next morning, I first thought it had all been a dream, but then I noticed the coin still clutched in my fist and I knew…”
Trembling hands notwithstanding, Blondie managed to make it over to their table without drama. Draco followed her with his gaze until she was sat across from her girl, knee bouncing under the table as she placed her purchases between them with a hopeful smile.
Heart pounding, he stares up at the canopy and listens to the comforting sound of boys sleeping all around him. It’s familiar, like an old song he’s heard a million times before, and yet…something is different tonight.
At Harry’s reply, Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, stretching the fabric of his slim-fitted t-shirt as his chest expands with the inhalation. The corners of Draco’s mouth twitches, clearly fighting a smile, and Harry watches him mesmerised, unable to quell the excited butterflies swarming in his stomach.
Draco carefully lifted the large piece out from the crate, feeling the urge to do it with his hands instead of magic. The glass was cold under his hands, but it felt full of life, and Draco was taken aback by the fact that it was still in his grasp. The movement portrayed seemed so
“Oh, Helga, I’m so sorry, Draco.” And she did look sorry. She looked like somebody had kicked her crup, actually, and all at once, Draco felt awful for getting so angry at her. “What are you going to do?”
Molly looked around and met Draco’s eyes, then turned to her husband, horrified. “Oh, Arthur! He’s got amnesia!”
sorry. I should have told you everything from the start. I should have told you all, and I’ll never forgive myself that—”
Whatever you two are talking about, though, it doesn’t sound important in the least. Just amused murmurs and delighted laughs. I make the mistake to chance a glance in your direction, catching you with a fond smile on your face, your eyes sparkling, your free hand fiddling with the fringe of the blanket you have thrown over your legs. You’re so smitten, and for a moment I find myself wishing you weren’t here.
The dog tilted its head to the side, and Draco could swear it raised a questioning brow at him. Did dogs even have eyebrows?
at a party of Slyvia’s. As far as he knew, not a single one of them had gone by without the Muggle police being called to the building for some reason or other. “I’m really sorry, but I have plans.”
Then he turned, left the room, and headed for the lifts. He had an old movie, a glass of wine, and a fox waiting for him at home.
“But…” Someone had to be messing with him. Like a start-of-school prank or something. Because it simply couldn’t be… It didn’t. Make. Sense. “I don’t…”
“Perfect,” Draco sighs. “Abso-fucking-perfect.” He takes another sip of his tea and lowers his mug to his lap, cradling it in his hands as he leans his head back against the couch cushion.  Harry tries to ignore the pleasant warmth spreading through his chest at the words, tries to keep his gaze off the pale arch of Draco’s neck as the man continues, now addressing the ceiling. “You’re too good to me, Harry. You’re too good for your own damned good.”
Draco forced a smile onto his face. “Of course.” He took a deep breath and gently tugged his arm back from Harry’s grasp. “Now, tell me about this firework accident Charlie had that Ginny mentioned.”
He turned back to Molly and met her gaze, begging for her forgiveness. She picked up a handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes, but she seemed to be composed, so Draco pushed forwards, eager to finally get it all out.
That doesn't keep me from being curious about whether you'll be able to pick it out of the crowd, though...
Harry’s eyes were intent on Draco’s, and something fluttered in Draco’s stomach. Harry looked like he was trying to solve a puzzle and was pleased with the result so far. But no, surely Draco was only imagining it.
She smiled and walked up to him, settling down next to him on the worn wooden bench. Her presence was calming. They’d gone through so many of the same things: the Triwizard Tournament, losing Cedric, fighting in the war, being unceremoniously adopted into the Weasley family. Over the years, she’d become like the big sister he’d never had and he thought that, if anyone, she knew love. She was part Veela, after all. Weren’t they supposed to be experts?
Father still insisted they see the Dark Lord’s presence as an honour, a sign of trust they all should be proud and grateful for. And, yes, Draco may have found it exciting in the beginning — all but basking in the notion of the legendary wizard choosing their house for his base of operations — but seriously? The Dark Lord acted as if he owned the place, despite it having been the Malfoy family estate for centuries. He hadn’t even let them celebrate Christmas in peace.
“I’m not,” I assure her, helplessly accepting that my eyes are already back on you, drinking in the sight that makes me dizzier than any beer ever could. “I’m not going to ‘do anything about it’.”
“I— Yeah,” Harry manages, reminding himself for the gazillionth time that this was never supposed to be real, that he shouldn’t feel disappointed about it being over.
There really wasn’t anything special with these cheesecakes — honestly, they were just plain lime, strawberry, mango, and blueberry — but just by labelling them Slytherin, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw, Draco was all but certain he’d boosted the demand by at least fifty percent. (The same went for the four tea blends he and Neville finally patented last week after months of experimentation: green with jasmine, ginger and lemongrass for the snakes; rooibos with chilli, apple, and cinnamon for the lions; black with cornflower petals and blackberry leaves for the eagles; and a herbal blend of chamomile, vanilla, and passionflower for the badgers.)
The stern look she gave him would’ve had Draco nodding even if it hadn’t been his plan all along. He grinned. “Oh, fuck yes. It’s been far too long since—”
“Of course, dear,” Molly said. “If you can’t remember getting engaged to Draco, then surely something’s wrong in there. We’ll just wait for it to clear up, and you’ll be right as rain.” She stood up and took Arthur’s hand. “I’m going to go home and make you some soup so you don’t need to eat this horrid hospital stuff. Creamy chicken?”
And that’s when it hit him: the two of them were having an actual conversation, quite possibly their first ever. And to his surprise, Draco not only found himself enjoying it but was starting to think the feeling might even be mutual. The only thing he knew for sure — he didn’t want it to end.
And fuck, but it hurts. So damned much. Even my ugly chest monster is hurting enough to huddle up in a foetal position against my thumping heart, its enraged roars replaced by soft, pathetic whimpers. I’m aching to do the same, to let my unsteady knees give out, to sink to the floor right here in the middle of the kitchen and succumb to the pain.
They stepped into the tent and, Circe, the heat and noise and crowd of people hit them like a wall. The marquee was lit with fairy lights everywhere and a band played at the far end of the tent. From the outside, Draco hadn’t heard a thing, but in here, the din of voices and laughter lifted his soul. Yes, he really was an extrovert at heart, feeding off the energy of those around him. And this, this was simply wonderful.
It wasn’t like Draco had a thriving social life to uphold in his spare time anyway. His work was plenty social as it was, and, most days, his brain was about ready to switch off the minute his shift ended.
You don’t answer my greeting, an anomaly strange enough to make me sit up straighter, allowing me to throw a glance your way over the back of the couch. I only get a brief glimpse of you as you pass by the doorway, heading straight for your room without acknowledging me, wrapped securely in a world of your own. Before I even have time to process what’s going on, the door closes behind you; the sight of your face, pale and drawn, dancing before my eyes long after you’re gone.
But yeah, I probably should have told them why I asked them to pose for that photo. And believe me, I did plan to, but once the time came, I just… couldn’t. I bet they would have loved being able to send you their love and birthday wishes, though. Just as you would’ve been thrilled to receive them.
Now, you don’t even notice the cuckoo clock. And I can’t be bothered to come up with a guess on its value. What’s the point if we’re not doing it together? This used to be the highlight of my week; you and me together in front of the telly, pointlessly arguing over silly antiques. It was familiar and comforting. Bloody perfect. And now you’ve gone and ruined it all by bringing
He watched Charlie nod, trying to ignore the man standing right behind him running his hands through his raven black hair the way he always did whenever he was upset. Draco couldn’t let himself worry about Harry now. He had to finish this. Determined, he turned back to the family.
Draco sensed they weren’t talking about missing limbs anymore, but it was New Year’s, dammit, and he wasn’t going to let himself get overly maudlin pondering any deep thoughts. “Yes, well.”
‘Someone who has the ability to make your heart race and your toes curl’? Seriously, M, what the fuck happened to you?
As soon the decision had been made, something warm and comforting settled in Harry’s gut. It spread throughout his body, pleasant and soothing, draining the tension from his stiff shoulders and slowing down the rapid beating of his heart. Even the pixies in his stomach were finally lulled to sleep. Harry had thought it would be hard, letting go; he’d thought it would be agonising and painful and all but unbearable. It wasn’t. He had expected sorrow, anticipated the bitter taste of defeat, and instead, what welcomed him now was nothing but a liberating feeling of relief.
Yeah, they noticed the owl, all right. I hadn’t planned for it to happen, or for them to find out. Well, I had, at first, but then, sometime around mid-morning, I changed my mind.
It was perfect. It was an exact fit, and the colour was just what he would have picked out on his own. His eyes found Molly’s, and he smiled. “Thank you,” he mouthed, and she grinned.
“I promise. In fact—” Harry let go of Draco’s hand to reach into his trouser pocket, fishing up a… coin? Draco frowned. “Here. Take this,” Harry said, placing the coin in Draco’s palm. “Just something to help you remember our little chat.”
He hadn’t thought much about it in the years since the war, but now the day had finally come, it suddenly felt more significant than ever before, as if everything in his life had somehow been leading up to this particular moment in time.
“Yes, well,” his voice sounded strange to his own ears as he pulled back, thankful for Smaug’s interruption and eager to move before his body had time to betray him. “I get what you’re saying. Thank you so much for the demonstration.”
I thought I had got over the worst of it; thought I’d finally reached some kind of new normal. These past few months, I’ve been sleeping better, sometimes several nights in a row without waking up in a cold sweat and with my limbs tangled in the sheets. I’ve caught myself laughing and joking with my friends without the twinge of grief dampening the moment. Of course, as soon as I realise it, the moment is gone, but still. I actually believed the worst was over, that the bright new future everyone’s been talking about had finally started. I guess I should have known better.
Draco wracked his brain, remembering what he might have said, then settled on his rambling apologies. He looked at Sirius’ now more solemn demeanour and nodded. “Right. Well, then you know I never meant for this to happen. I was trying to help Charlie, and then everything just snowballed, and I couldn’t… I really care about them all so much. Is that weird?” He paused and then began to study the swirls in his teacup. “It
Draco returned the smile, forcing himself to feel the cheer that seemed so elusive these days. “Yes, Merry Christmas, Ernie.”
"Fuck!" Harry yells, throwing his head back into the pillow as his back arches from the bed. It's so much, so intense, and with each thrust, Draco reminds him of what they are to each other now.
have had a futile, little (more like embarrassingly huge) crush on the guy once, but that was ages ago, back in school. Back in that mythical part of the world that he’d left behind. And yes, all right, he
The fire halted again, and Draco managed to draw himself back to the moment. Laying on the ground in front of him, barely conscious but still managing to maintain his Shield Charm, was Charlie Weasley.
It’s interesting how you’re always so quick to jump to conclusions about me. Not very Slytherin, is it, to talk before thinking? I thought snakes were supposed to be more calculating than that, more prudent, weighing pros and cons, analysing possible options, all that stuff. Making groundless assumptions sounds more like something a Gryffindor would do, don’t you think? Tell me, is this something you always do or is it only when it comes to me? Should I perhaps be flattered by the special treatment?
Thinking rationally, Harry knew chances were minimal that anyone would try something in the middle of the holiday rush, but that didn’t mean his protective instincts ever took a break. Although it felt like a lifetime ago, the war wounds were still fresh and deep enough for some resentful people to take justice into their own hands, driven by a perceived obligation to right the wrongs they believed had been wrought in the aftermath of the war. There were still wizards and witches out there who believed in Voldemort’s agenda; anonymous, faceless people who hadn’t been active in the war and therefore had never been identified or apprehended. Who knew when any one of them would suddenly think it a good idea to attack the man who had vanquished their admired martyr?
“But I don’t have…” You hesitate, closing your eyes while taking a deep breath. When you look up again, you’re standing right in front of me, your stormy-grey eyes wet and pleading. “My vault… I don’t…”
“B-but,” Potter stuttered, “Charlie’s not engaged. He’s not even seeing anybody regularly. I mean, it’s
“Your bowl was auctioned off as by an anonymous artist, but it’s Potter’s. I tried to get him to relent on that as I would’ve been able to raise more for the charity with his name attached, but he didn’t want it on there for some reason.” She shrugged and gave him an evil grin. “It still went for more than I’d expected.”
The room hushed as he entered, but it was packed nearly full of Weasleys, people from the Reserve, and a couple of Draco’s and Charlie’s friends. At the front, waiting near the official, stood Charlie Weasley, looking much better than he had since Christmas, and although Draco had to admit his husband-to-be looked good,
"It's just something to think about." Malfoy led the way into his office, sitting down behind his desk and pulling out the case file. "Shall we?"
"So this woman, Amelia Tyler, 32 years old, was found dead in her flat; her husband, Lucas Tyler, 34 years old, was nowhere to be seen while the Aurors were investigating the place." Harry opened the file folder on the table, pulling out some pictures and spreading them out on the table. The crime scene photos were ghastly; the woman, a young brunette with a very pretty face, was lying on the ground in a pool of her own blood, her hand clutching her wand and her eyes wide open. She had a large, deep gash across her chest which had ripped through her shirt.
The door opened and a short, brunet witch poked her head inside. "Auror Potter, your wife is here to see you, sir."
Malfoy turned around and returned the salutation, setting down a mug of steaming hot tea in front of him. Harry took a sip and realized that it was brewed to perfection, even though it was left black. "Godric, this tea is amazing." He took another taste, delighting in the warmth of it. "Where did you get it?"
and let me finish this damnable paperwork so we can start on the next case?" Harry's face was flushed fuchsia with frustration as Malfoy rose from the desk.
Back at Malfoy's house, they discussed their findings over lunch, Thai food Malfoy had ordered from the new restaurant down the street from his home.
at Zabini; the wand he was holding flew out of his hand and landed in Harry's outstretched one. He threw it aside, disgusted. He then pointed his wand at Ginny, who cowered behind Zabini meekly. "Ginny," he breathed, trying to calm himself, but to no avail. "What the
“Fine. I’m not really impressed either.” Draco rolled over and his stiff body screamed in protest. “I am, however, fucking sore. Merlin, who knew saving somebody would be such a hassle?”
Harry hurried to the fireplace, and Draco followed him, watching him trip the ward allowing the call. The person murmured, then Harry turned back over his shoulder to look at Draco. “They want to talk to you. It’s St Mungo’s.”
And it’s not like a few extra study hours will make any difference in the grand scheme of things, right? By this stage, either you know it or you don’t. At least, that’s how it is for me. These last-minute revisions never manage to stick inside my head, no matter what I do. So, if anyone asks, these are my Charms notes, okay?
could be my mate, I was sure I was going to lose my mind.” Then his eyes fling open and Harry’s heart clenches at the sudden panicked look on his face. “Not literally. I know there are all kinds of rubbish stories out there about Veela bonds, but… Harry, my life isn’t dependent on you accepting me or anything. If you don’t want this, if
Harry climbs the steps to the Owlery, the pulling in his chest simultaneously loosening yet becoming even more pressing. The urgency has spread, taking over his whole body, driving him forward, step by step, to the top of the tower.
Except, Draco still refused to believe it. Even as the people around him screamed out their despair, even as he witnessed Potter’s lifeless body being placed on the ground at the Dark Lord’s feet, Draco just
Thirty minutes later, Draco was ready to scream. Harry hadn’t outright accused him of anything, but he was consistently fishing for information, trying to trip Draco up.
Draco could feel the corners of his mouth curve upwards on their own volition as he read the words on the screen, his smile only broadening as he tried to figure out how to respond.
It was still hard to grasp it, that Draco was actually here in his bedroom, touching him, holding him. It was like a belated mass delivery of happy childhood Christmases, a whole decade’s worth of them, all wrapped into one.
With no waiting customers in line, Draco finally allowed himself to slip his phone out of his pocket. He seldom received texts other than from his boss to confirm details in his work schedule, or colleagues begging to switch shifts for one reason or other, but this time, it was from someone else entirely.
Harry set his jaw, finally coming to the decision he knew he should have made months ago. He would get over this stupid crush one way or another, or he’d die trying.
“Right where you left me.” He glances at the clock, wondering where the hell time went. The position of the hands makes him frown; Draco’s back earlier than expected. Not that Harry’s been sitting here waiting for him or anything, just… unexpected, that’s all. “Everything’s okay?”
Pansy stared for a moment and then started laughing. “How could you possibly be blamed for a miscarriage or a nervous breakdown? You’re not making any sense.”
Should I be concerned about the fact that you just used my first name for the first time in possibly forever? Who are you, and what have you done to my Draco? (See? It feels weird, doesn’t it? So weird.)
Merlin, I hate this place. Or rather, I hate that this place seems to hate me so much. I’ve been staying here for nearly a week now, and this house still makes me want to leave as soon as I enter the front door. It’s like an itch, a restless feeling coming over me every time I get inside, prickling and creeping across my skin, suggesting I come up with errands to run, friends to visit, laps to run in the park… anything to get back out in the fresh air outside these suffocating walls.
“Fuck!” Potter had done it again, leaving Draco raw and confused, nauseated by the tangled mess of false hopes and futile dreams wreaking havoc in his chest. “
“Please, don’t,” Harry hastens to cut him off. He’s heard the same speech from plenty of his friends these past few months. He doesn’t need to hear it from Draco too.
Harry approached the bed, scanning his intense gaze over Charlie. “I stopped by this morning, but he’s already looking better than even then.”
No, he walked. Briskly. As fast as his legs could carry him. Up the main staircase, around the corner, another four flights of stairs, and along the corridor leading to the only safe space he could think of that didn’t contain that fucking vanishing cabinet; the bane of his existence.
This letter is already much too long, but just one more thing and then I’ll leave you to your day. Yes, you may have done some awful things during the war, but you’re not a monster, Draco. You never were.
to release it, just for a few hours.” Draco looks up and runs slender fingers through his long, blond locks, revealing eyes bright with unshed tears. “I thought if I came out here, if I was far enough from the castle, it wouldn’t affect you as much. You deserve so much more than this; getting wrapped up in my problems. I’m so sorry.” He turns away again, looking out into the starry sky, his wings once more on full display where they hang loosely below his broad shoulders. “I won’t hold you to anything. I promise,” he whispers.
And if that reason turned out to have messy raven hair and vibrant green eyes, Draco really didn’t want to think about it.
“I’ll talk to him,” Harry said. “Again. I swear, if Sirius ends up in Slytherin and Ron gives him shit about it, I’ll—”
Draco's heart did a double-take at that last piece of information, finding himself unable to keep his eyes away from Harry any longer. Looking over, he couldn’t help the smirk curving his mouth at the sight of Harry, face down in the palms of his hands, ears bright red.
The pride in Potter’s voice still lingered in Draco’s mind, even after all these years, and suddenly Draco just
Molly wants me to stay indefinitely. She’s even offered me BIll’s old room since he lives in Cornwall with Fleur now, but I don’t know. I guess I don’t mind staying here as long as Ron and Hermione are around too, but they’re already talking about getting their own place and if they do, where would that leave me? Holed up with my friends’ parents like a fucking charity case? No thanks. Not that Molly and Arthur would ever think of me as a charity case, I know that, but still. It feels like I’m intruding on something I shouldn’t, like the broody black sheep in a flock of cheerful ginger.
Considering the risk of rousing another rant, I’m not really sure I should ‘enlighten you on the purpose of toothpaste’ right now. The answer is bound to hurt your pride even more, so if you don’t think you can man up and handle it like a normal person, just skip to the next paragraph, okay? Right. So, toothpaste. It’s not made of teeth, silly, it’s for
“Salazar, you taste so good,” Draco murmurs against Harry’s skin, his voice low and rough, a bit breathless and
“Argh, all right then,” Draco said through clenched teeth. Not that he wanted to come with. He just needed to get Potter’s hands off his body before he accidentally let out the moan threatening to escape his throat.
Harry grunted and shifted his box. “You and everyone else. But family is important to me, and, well, it was right after we finally finished school, and George was barely functioning at the time. I mean, with Fred gone and, well… Anyway, I figured I’d have time later, to join the Aurors or get a Defense Mastery, if that was what I wanted.” He fell silent and Draco glanced over at him, biting his tongue to stay quiet in hope that Harry would continue. He did. “Well, eventually I realised I didn’t really want all that other stuff. I liked the peace and quiet. I get to help the family, and I travel from time to time for the business, so I’ve been able to see the world.”
They’re seated in a quiet corner, out of sight from most probing eyes, and the hours fly by as they enjoy the evening, the delicious food, the delectable wine, and most of all, each other’s company. They talk and laugh, and they toast with champagne. They play footsie under the long tablecloth and share the chef’s special Valentine’s dessert.
Draco’s eyes shot to the ceiling above; the movement in his peripheral vision telling Draco Harry’s did the same. Draco’s heart skipped a beat as his gaze fell on the white-berried, green bundle hanging there, all festive and traditional and—
He looked back up at the sky and let out a long breath, the visible exhale floating up and away into the cool night air. “The song you were humming. It was my mother’s favourite. You know, Sirius’s cousin.” Harry turned to look at Draco, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to meet his eyes. Instead, he kept watching the stars, letting their familiarity bring him comfort as he continued. “My mother used to sing it to me all the time. ‘I wish I had a river so long, I would teach my feet to fly. I wish I had a river I could skate away on.’ I haven’t heard it in a long time.”
I’m pleasantly surprised to read that you finally seem to have become aware of your own imperfections, though. That’s a rather big step for you, isn’t it, allowing yourself the benefit of the doubt regarding your supreme excellence? I’ve been trying to imagine what your childhood must’ve been like, a peaceful, sheltered life with your doting parents in a ginormous house out in the countryside. So far from what I grew up with, it might as well have been in a different universe entirely. With that in mind, I guess your patented, self-assured haughtiness isn’t all that surprising; I bet your parents reminded you of your unrivalled brilliance every single day.
Draco’s knowledge-thirsty brain took over the reins of his mouth. “I thought you could only travel so far with a time-turner?”
“Nah, I’m donating it to a charity auction. Some new initiative is having a fundraiser ball in a couple of weeks.
The house-elf jumped skittishly, tearing her attention from the surrounding chaos. She looked up at him, biting her lower lip as she fiddled with the hem of her tea towel. “Mistress wishes Master Draco joining her in the drawing-room, sir.”
Draco picked up the time-turner and blew off the dust from its bronze circles, barely caring about the sneezing fit as he turned it in his hands, admiring the way the hourglass’ purple sand shimmered in the lamplight.
Clearly, Potter knew Charlie better than the others these days, and there was no doubt the man was about to call him out on the entire charade. Perhaps it was better this way, though. This was his chance to come clean.
“Sure. Take your time.” Draco let Harry work while he took the opportunity to examine the room. Shelves of books, binders, and office supplies lined the walls with small personal items staggered throughout, giving the room a comfortable air. A storeroom was visible through a door on the left wall, and Draco imagined it probably ran the length of the entire shop. Overall, it was a meticulously organised space, which Draco realised didn’t really surprise him, the business being as successful as it was.
You remember Fred, right? George’s twin brother? Well, he died that day, in the final battle, like so many others. We all grieve him, of course, all in our own way, and Molly’s still devastated by the loss of her son. But as hard as it is for her and the rest of the family, it’s a hundred times harder for George. He hasn’t been himself ever since, as if he’s lost a limb and can’t figure out how to function without it. And why am I telling you all this? Because, over Christmas, all everyone could think of was Fred’s absence. With everyone gathered under the same roof, it became so horribly obvious that he wasn’t there, that he’d never be there again. The others seemed to be consoled by each other, comforted by their relatives’ presence. I only felt like I was intruding on something private, although they all assured me I wasn’t.
The endearment is unexpected, as is the eruption of heat it sets off in Harry’s chest. It only takes another couple of thrusts before Harry comes, hard enough to see stars, his hands clutching Draco’s biceps as Draco’s name falls from his lips like a prayer.
Harry grins and pulls Draco up to standing, And it doesn’t matter that he was practically draped over Draco’s bare chest only a minute ago; when Draco straightens in front of him, rendering them not even an inch apart, Harry forgets how to breathe. Their height difference is not much, and certainly not anything Harry’s ever contemplated before. Now, though, standing this close together, he suddenly realises he has to tilt his head up slightly to meet Draco’s eyes. Harry refuses to question why this revelation causes his cock to strain even more eagerly against the tight fabric of his pants; as if it was reaching out for Draco, craving contact.
He looked so soft, so vulnerable, with his perfect hair all rumpled and his immaculate skin blotchy red from being grazed by Harry’s five o’clock shadow.
“Draco,” she called, her voice pleading, but he was already cutting his way through the crowd, the joy of the room now turned against him with the utter mortification of the moment.
Harry was quiet for a while, then Draco felt the warm weight of a hand on his shoulder. “You miss her. How long has it been now?”
happy? Because it seems to me you’re stuck in a job you don’t really care about, ignoring what you really want to do — what your talent
“Nope, just me.” Harry glanced back over his shoulder, his eyes narrowed, but once he turned back to face Draco again, he smiled. “Are you on the way to the Reserve?”
, Draco’s mind supplied — and surprisingly, former Tri-Wizard Champion Fleur Delacour, and an older, dark-haired man that looked oddly familiar, although Draco was sure they had never met.
Harry laughed, sounding a little strained. “Molly gave it to me. Hey, listen. There’s supposed to be some kind of New Year’s bash at the Dragon Reserve on Tuesday.”
. Tonight. From France.” He turned to lie on his side, propping his head on his elbow. “If it weren’t for Andromeda…”
“Hmm. Yes, well, with everything that’s been going on, and Charlie in the hospital, and then Smaug ate something he shouldn’t have yesterday and kept getting sick. I had to take him to the Animal-Healer so they could vanish a piece of leather from his stomach.”
“Nearly five years. After Father passed in Azkaban, she managed about two more years. A curse she’d taken during the war had weakened her heart, and it finally gave out.”
Pansy tilted her head. “Well, no staff discounts on a charity auction. You’ll have to bid like everybody else.” She reached into the crate and pulled out a note Draco hadn’t noticed before. Its content made Pansy grin like a shark. “And get out your cheque book, baby, ‘cause he’s letting me put his name on it this time.”
The Burrow was…indescribable. Draco literally had no words. His mind could hardly take it all in: the people, the house, the decor, the spirit of Christmas infused into every nook and cranny.
And I can tell it’s just what you needed to hear. I can see it in the way you relax, imperceptible to anyone else but so obvious if you know what to look for. As the tension subsides, leaving room for relief and gratitude, something is constricting in my chest, a dull ache that only grows when a sweet smile curves your lips.
Harry’s eyes had dropped to Draco’s hand, though, and he ignored the question. “Is that an invitation?”
Harry dropped his gaze to the floor and shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, his shoulders slightly slumped as he shrugged. “I blow glass. It’s something I picked up as a hobby after the war. I like to give them as gifts, or sometimes donate them or whatnot.”
Draco turned to Harry who was watching him with something akin to sadness in his eyes. “Hey, cheer up, Potter!” he said with a grin as he bumped Harry’s shoulder with his own. “It’s a party. Come on, let’s mingle.”
I may not have liked Snape, but no, you’re right, by the end I probably wouldn’t have been able to kill him, no matter the circumstances. Did you know he and my mother used to be friends once, before they went to Hogwarts? And here’s another surprise for you, not that you’ll ever believe it: he actually was on ‘our side’, not Riddle’s. Yes, I know how it sounds, i.e. crazy as fuck, but it’s true. I didn’t have it confirmed myself until the night of the final battle, but as it turns out, he was the Order’s bravest and most loyal spy, right to the very end.
Despite his best intentions, Harry’s every trace of self-restraint is obliterated the moment Draco’s lips connect with his. They’re even more perfect than he’d imagined, all soft and pliant, tasting of sweetened tea and pure perfection. Draco lets out a pleased little noise, something between a moan and a whimper, and the sound of it, the taste of it, goes straight to Harry’s cock. A jolt of white-hot want courses through him, fuelled by months of pent-up desire and longing, and soon Draco’s lips are not enough.
Draco gulped and forced his gaze back to Harry’s, the vibrant, twinkling green making Draco’s head spin.
,” Harry cried out as Draco captured the nipple between his teeth and sucked, causing Harry to arch off the bed. “You’re such a fucking tease.”
“Really?” Hermione asked, looking thrilled. “That’s wonderful. I always told him that just because Crookshanks hated him and treated him nastily didn’t mean other cats would. If he’d just give them a chance—”
She winked, leaving Draco with an amused smile on his lips as he turned to open the cash register. It wasn’t until he was about to slide the banknote into its assigned compartment that he noticed the slip of paper that had been hiding underneath the money in his hand.
Harry stepped in and with a smile, wrapped his arms around Draco in a perfectly acceptable, friendly hug. “See, a hug is simple,” he said over Draco’s shoulder. “It involves arms, and people, and caring. And sometimes a little squeeze.” His arms tightened demonstratively around Draco’s torso. “If it’s Molly, it also involves something inherently maternal, but I don’t know how to do that one.”
— caught a glimpse of Draco’s naked figure in the locker room showers, it was all he could think about whenever the man was in the same room. That perfect porcelain skin stretched taut over powerful muscle and glistening from the water running down his spine towards—
Potter’s words echoed through his mind, and for the first time in his life, Draco finally let himself believe them.
You nod along as Parkinson spins her tale, glancing at Ginny to gauge her reaction, drawing a breath to impart something complementary to the story. You’re too slow, though, and Nott gets there first, making Zabini’s eyes grow wide in alarm as he realises yet another one of his safe-kept secrets is about to be revealed in front of his new girlfriend. Nott doesn’t pay him any mind, casually waving off his objections as he turns to Ginny and spurts out his words in between infectious laughter. You laugh too, tilting your head back to release the joy bubbling up from deep within you, baring your long, slender neck for the surrounding group. A dash of pink colour your cheeks, and above them your eyelashes flutter in the dim light.
Harry turned towards the sound, squinting in the sun at the man coming towards them from Hagrid’s hut.
To his credit, Theo tried to mollify her, telling her I probably have everything under control (Haven’t you, Harry?), but when she continued to glare exasperatedly at me, he turned to me and said, ‘Maybe you should just tell them, mate?’ So, I did.
Your key in the lock catches me by surprise. You nearly never come home these days, and whenever you plan to stop by, you usually let me know beforehand. As if I would mind having you. As if you didn’t live here anymore.
“There already is someone.” His mouth is dry and his voice hoarse. He wishes he could trust his body enough to take a sip from his tea, but he fears his hands would tremble too much if he tried to raise the mug to his lips. “Not that it matters, it’ll never lead to anything, and, well”— he shrugs —”it’s complicated.”
The Scottish night air is cool as Harry waits for Draco to arrive, his nerves tightening in his stomach.
. Young Draco, the Draco he grew up with, would have let him fall right into the mess and then busied himself by taking pictures. But this Draco, the Draco he’s been dreaming of for months, brushes off his visible concern with sarcasm.
Draco’s eyes widened, and he couldn’t quite contain his smile. “You got Shacklebolt to come? Seriously?”
“Okay, have it your way.” With another glance over my shoulder, you lean in and give me a quick peck on the cheek. As if that’s something we always do. As if it’s nothing special at all.
Things got marginally better around the house after the secret was out, mainly because my aunt and uncle were afraid of me, or rather, of what Dumbledore would do to them if he ever found out how they treated me. I was still responsible for most of the cooking and cleaning when I was home. They still locked me in my room and rationed my food, even when I’d been the one making it. They even put bars on my window once, in an attempt to prevent me from going off to Hogwarts for Second Year.
"You are incredible," Draco murmurs against Harry's skin as his cock finally slips out, his nose buried in the curls at the back of Harry's neck.
You swallow, distress furrowing your brow. Your silky blond locks are in complete disarray, as if you’ve pushed your hands through them countless times, as if you’ve repeatedly clenched your fists in them in an attempt to ground yourself. They fall in your face, veiling stormy-grey eyes glistening with unshed tears.
Yes, my relatives did indeed hate me, and it wasn’t until my eleventh birthday that I found out why. Before then, I was just a mistreated and malnourished, unwanted nephew, a burden that had been imposed on them after my parents died in a ‘car crash’ the night I turned 15 months old. They used to imply that my parents, specifically my dad, were abominable freaks, and they never missed a chance to remind me I most likely was one too. They thought they could suppress it, that they could make my abnormalities go away if they only prohibited me from expressing them. Unfortunately for me, though, that was not the case.
Harry bristled but nodded. Draco put the cat down to eat and decided he couldn’t take it anymore. He needed to clean this dump, if not for Charlie or himself, then for poor Mushu’s sake.  He drew out his wand and started throwing things in the bin and levitating dishes into the sink. Harry followed him around but didn’t seem to be willing to help. “When did you and Charlie start seeing each other.”
When those pleading crystal blue eyes zoned in on Draco and he finally realised who Charlie was talking about, he tried his best not to roll his eyes. “The dragon is fine, Charlie. She’s not hurt. And because you’re okay, the Reserve won’t be forced to put her down.”
Harry pulled the silk scarf from his face and took it all in. The sun was low in the sky behind them, but they were staring out at the sea, their view uninhibited by any buildings or people on either side. They appeared to be entirely alone, the nearest signs of humanity the little speckles of houses they could see in the distant cove.
PPS I’ve narrowed it down to either Lucy or Gryff. This is your last chance to give your opinion on the matter before I make up my mind.
” Harry Potter’s unmistakable voice was suddenly high-pitched and strained. “Charlie’s not engaged.”
“Ah, what a shame,” Draco said, feigning a wistful expression. “I really like those marshmallows…” He looked up and Harry forgot how to breathe as warm grey eyes connected with his own. “Hi…”
“I know.” A shiver runs down Harry’s spine at Draco’s words, and his eyes fall to soft, rosy lips, lingering for just a moment before they return to Draco’s sad gaze. “May I touch them?”
The Floo call came very early in the morning on New Year’s Day. There were no details, just that there was a change in Charlie’s status, and that Draco needed to come in.
Ernie balled up a piece of parchment and threw it at him, making him laugh. “Fine, I won’t ask questions until you’re ready to talk about it, but honestly, I’m impressed. Charlie Weasley. His brother’s right. I’d pegged him as a lifelong bachelor.”
Touched by the sentiment, Draco returned his gaze to the gift in his lap and slowly unwrapped it. Beneath the plain brown paper lay a soft, navy blue jumper, light silver threads woven through the yarn. He ran his hand across it, relishing its softness.
“H-hello?” Draco’s voice sounded awfully small and vulnerable to his own ears, all breathy and quivering. “Anybody there?”
Smaug slowly made his way closer to Harry, then sniffed his hand and gave it a little lick. Harry didn’t move, just waited, and finally, Smaug took the last few steps and pushed his head under Harry’s outstretched hand, nudging it.
“I’m actually quite good at the guessing, but I always feel silly being the one to act them out.” He let out a long yawn, the food making him drowsy.
When the clock finally struck seven, Draco couldn’t be out the door fast enough. Harry’s building wasn’t hard to find, it really
Draco’s well-bred manners were the only thing keeping him from letting his jaw go slack in shock at the admission.
Eventually, Draco rolled off him to lie on his back next to Harry. Harry let his head fall to the side, studying Draco’s striking silhouette while the man contemplated the ceiling.
But, he reminds himself, Draco doesn’t seem surprised to see him here. And he hasn’t told him to go away.
PPS Free drinks all night, eh? Sweet. Sounds like a win-win for me. Either I get an evening of free beer or I get the pleasure of drinking you under the table. Hmm, I wonder what Drunco Malfoy is like… Loud and testy, or weepy and whiny?
"No," Harry answers, smiling. "You promised me once, in this spot all those months ago, that you'd fly with me one day. I want to fly—" he runs his hands up Draco's back to where he knows Draco's Veela wings are magically hidden away beneath his skin "—with you.
“She sent Harry one in his first year at Hogwarts, and that was it. He was one of them. It took me until Sixth Year to get one,” she added with a laugh.
”No worries.” Draco offered her an encouraging smile. “Want anything else to go with your drinks?” He gestured towards the vitrine.
Harry tilted his head back and closed his eyes to the sun, inhaling the crisp December air and allowing it to fill his lungs with hope and reassurance. He’d make it. In a few week’s time, his infatuation would all be over and forgotten, left in the past, and everything would be alright. It wasn’t the end of the world, after all. It wasn’t even the end of their friendship. Merlin, maybe one day in the future, this silly crush would even seem distant enough to serve as a harmless joke between them. And until then, Harry had amazing friends, an adorable godson, a job that he loved… And Christmas — Harry’s favourite time of year — was just around the corner. What more could he ever wish for?
“Honestly, Potter? If this is the best you can do, there’s no wonder you’re still single.” Harry opens his mouth to retort but hesitates. Malfoy’s not mocking him, he realises, but sounds genuinely concerned, as if he’s actually looking to help. “Why did you choose this place?”
“And by saving me, he saved Daenerys,” Charlie insisted. “She’s my favourite.” He sighed happily and looked back at Draco, his gaze intense. “Thank you. You really are my hero, aren’t you?”
“True.” Harry took another sip of his tea before setting his cup aside on the end table next to him. “He’s nervous about the sorting, though. Apparently, Ron’s been talking shit again.”
“You know I’m right here, right?” Charlie said with a sharp look at the Healer, “Think you could talk to me? I mean, if I can handle a dragon, I think I can handle a little bit of memory loss.” His eyes widened, and he looked around the room in alarm. “Wait, what happened to Daenerys? Is she okay?”
Harry chuckled as he listened to the boy, pleased when he felt Draco’s warmth against his back. He wasn’t all that surprised when those strong arms wrapped themselves around his waist again.
Godric, what would people even think of me if I dropped out? Becoming an auror is the next logical step for me, the only logical step. What if I don’t manage to do it? What if I don’t want to do it? Everyone expects me to land my dream job, the only one I’ve had since the moment I learnt auror’s even existed. What would they think of me if I don’t make it happen now that my dream is finally within reach? What signal would that send to all the post-war hopefuls? Don’t hope, don’t dream, don’t pursue your goals? I can dislike my fame all I want, but there’s no denying the impact my decisions and choices tend to have on the public. No matter how much I wish it wasn’t so, it comes with a responsibility, and at the end of the day, I guess I just don’t want to let everyone down.
Harry stills in Draco’s lap and lifts a hand to brush a lock of blond hair from Draco’s sweat-slicked forehead. As he does, he watches Draco’s eyes flutter open, dazed grey pools of want blinking up at him beseechingly.
“Yes, you are. And that’s okay.” The man sounded so kind, not a trace of disappointment in his voice. Only concern. And empathy. Tension seeped from Draco’s body, even as he felt the man inch closer. “You’re allowed to be nervous about going away. Almost everyone is the first time they’re about to board that train. In fact, my son is just as nervous as you are.”
Then there’s Aya Ambarella, a thirty-something witch from South America. I have no idea where McGonagall found her, but she went to Castelobruxo and hasn't set foot in Britain before this past summer. She teaches Defence, or, as it’s called now, DAHM (Defence and Healing Magic). I don’t know why we’ve never been taught basic healing before — I certainly could’ve had good use of it these past few years — but I can definitely see the logic behind combining defence and healing. Most students seem to like the change and according to Professor Ambarella, this is how they’ve always done it at Castelobruxo so it obviously works.
A nice long walk with Harry Potter, with his perfectly green eyes and wonderfully tight arse—the man who Draco certainly did
Harry’s faint, “Happy New Year,” drifted into the reception area just before the door closed behind him. Draco slumped back against it, blinking back the tears pooling in his eyes.
Actually, you know what? Writing this, I just realised your parents weren’t all that different from them — my aunt and uncle that is, not my parents. (Merlin, don’t ever let any of them know I said that, Draco; we do
brave? Draco wanted to laugh, but Harry’s serious expression gave him pause. “You’re kidding, right?” he asked instead, bemused by the lack of humour on Harry’s face. “Because I’m pretty sure only a coward slinks out the back door when the going gets tough.”
Draco turned to Pansy and handed her his still untouched wine. “I’m sorry, Pans. I’ll see you later. Just have to step out for a moment and beat the bollocks out of this fuckwit, for obvious reasons.” He leaned forwards and kissed her cheek. “Happy New Years, if I decide to go home after.”
Mind preoccupied, he messed up the latte art on the flat white, making the palm branch he was going for look more like an ambiguous, phallic blob.
I know she’s right. Of course, she is. It’s only a question of time before someone else notices, before
His hands move in unison, bringing pleasure to each in tandem. He refuses to lose himself to his own strokes, though, instead concentrating on Draco's pleasure. With each bob of his head, he manages to take Draco a little further in, a little deeper, and the sight of Draco above him, his head falling back in pleasure, the moonlight bouncing off his pale blond locks, his parted lips pink and swollen from being ravished, brings Harry closer to his peak.
“Then would you relax for a minute, you hot-blooded berk? I was just about to say how much I like the personal touch with the hand-made garlands, but now I’m not sure I want to anymore.”
The set menu did in fact only include one chosen spread with the scone, but hell if Draco was just going to stand there, waiting for her to make up her mind while the queue of customers grew behind her.
PPS Ha, bloody ha. I’m glad I’m not superstitious then, because Monday night, I dreamt about you. Again. At least, this time, I didn’t have to try to save your sorry arse from mortal peril, so I guess that’s something. But you and me marrying? Godric, can you even imagine?
Our friends seem to have changed topics again. Quidditch, if I were to venture a guess. Ron only gets this passionate when he talks about Quidditch, all high-pitched and lit up, gesturing wildly enough for everyone around him to lean away so as not to accidentally get punched in the face. Or have their drinks knocked over.
Yet, here he was, caught up in the moment, all common sense vanished, as always, in the presence of this irresistible man. It was all so good, so fucking perfect, and still, Draco wanted more. Needed more.
And with this uplifting topic, I might as well seize the mood and let you cash in that rain check I once promised you.
Whatever happens, though, you can rest assured I won’t be ending up with Ginny, neither at the party next week nor any other day. Not only because she’s apparently crushing on someone else now (who she stubbornly refuses to reveal the name of), but because ever since you mentioned me being with her would be like marrying a sibling, I just can’t see it anymore. Not that I have any real siblings to compare with, but I guess you have a point. It just feels weird to think of her that way now, you know? The same way I’d never even contemplate hooking up with Hermione. And since the rest of the girls even close to my age seem more interested in the myth than the man, I guess I’d better prepare to settle down in Singleton, Loneshire. (Well, muggles could be an option, of course, but I don’t think I’d be able to hide such an integral part of me as my magic from someone who I intend to form a more meaningful relationship with. A relationship like that should be built on trust and honesty, not lies and deceit.)
Bill and Fleur flanked them, and with the fellow Veela by his side, Draco finally seemed to be able to relax somewhat. "Thank you," Harry mouthed to her, and she smiled.
They walked side by side down an aisle of the large storeroom, the stock all neatly labelled and lining the shelves in sizes that would be easy to grab and restock the shop. Draco tried not to be impressed.
He tried to draw his gaze away from the sculpture, but it seemed impossible — until his awe-addled brain caught Harry’s quiet reply.
Of course, I didn’t put the pieces together until much, much later, and as much as it hurts me to do it, if you really want me to answer your question, I must admit that I honestly don’t know. I wish I could say that I would’ve accepted your presence in this house, had you shown up on our doorstep one day collecting on Dumbledore’s promise. However, I think we both know the unlikelihood of that scenario. I was so angry back then, Draco, so fucking angry. At you, for letting the Death Eaters into the castle and attempting to kill Dumbledore. At Snape, for actually going through with it and deceiving Dumbledore so thoroughly. At Dumbledore, for naively trusting Snape and for not letting me help, only to surrender without a fight. There were other reasons for my anger too, mainly one horrible, evil thing parasitising my soul without my knowledge or consent. There was so much I still didn’t know, about Dumbledore’s secret plan, about the key to RIddle’s mortality, about Snape’s true loyalties. About you. I didn’t know you the way I do now, Draco. If I had, then yes, I would have indeed welcomed you with open arms.
“Yes, well, weird cravings are kind of common, right? I mean, Hermione was basically going through a jar of pickles per day when…”
Draco felt a chill run through him, and his eyes stung alarmingly. He ignored it, scowling. “Yes, well, if you know me so well, then what
“You know, you don’t have to be such a bitch about it, Draco. I’m sorry that Potter blew you off, but he’s a fucking Gryffindor, what did you expect?”
But he’ll come around eventually, he always does, sooner or later. He just needs some time to adjust. And don’t you worry, Draco, he knows better than to give any ultimatums of the sort you’re envisioning. He learnt that lesson the hard way the winter before the end of the war. Deep down, he knows he can’t control who I choose to hang out with, and if I want to keep you in my life, he’ll just have to deal.
And no, we’re not excluding Goyle. Or, at least, I’m quite sure we wouldn’t if he’d been here. He’s not, though. He never came back after summer and I have no idea where he is. Your friends never talk about him, not within my earshot anyway, and when I asked Zabini about it the other day, he was being very evasive, wondering why I was asking and so I didn’t pry any further. Maybe he’d tell me if he knew I was asking for you, but since I haven’t told anyone about
I called Kreacher home that same evening after reading your letter. I seriously hadn’t thought of his absence as a contributing factor in all of this, but yeah, when put like that it makes perfect sense. It’s strange, though, having him here, pottering around. I don’t know, it just feels weird for me to have someone doing stuff for me that I could just as easily have done myself — not to mention the guilt trip I have every time I even think of Hermione finding out I have him here, working for me. You don’t know this, of course, but she’s been fighting ferociously for house-elf rights for years; even started an organisation promoting house-elf liberation all the way back in Fourth Year, convinced all elves should be freed and paid for their work like everyone else. While an honourable mission, she never got much support from the elves themselves, not even from your old house-elf Dobby who loved being free ‘til the end.
Forty-five minutes later, and Draco still couldn’t wrap his head around this new twist of fate life’s just hurled his way. While the Healer examined Charlie for the alleged — and decidedly non-existent — brain damage, Draco attempted to get close enough to Sirius to kick him in the shin. No matter how much he tried, though, the man kept inching away.
“Er…” Charlie said after a while, glancing over Harry’s shoulder. “I probably shouldn’t hog any more of your time, mate. Your boyfriend’s staring daggers at me.”
“Really?” Harry asked, now holding his own box and pausing on his way out the door. “I had no idea. Well, good for her. It’s doing a lot of good.” He smiled and Draco followed him as he continued towards the Floo. “Kingsley’s the one who suggested I should donate one of my pieces after I gave him a vase for Christmas. And if the charity has impressed Kingsley, then, well, it’s impressive.”
“You’re one to talk,” Draco murmured against Harry’s shoulder. “Exam revisions, my arse.” Draco nipped at Harry’s collarbone before rising up on his hands and knees to look Harry in the eye. “You just wanted a reason to get your hands all over me, didn’t you?”
“Hey,” Potter said softly, taking a tentative step forward. “It’s okay. I get that you’re upset with me, and I don’t blame you. You’re under a lot of stress right now, and I don’t expect you to believe me when I say I know what you’re going through, but… I do.” A sigh, another step, an outstretched hand. “Come here.”
My retort is on the tip of my tongue when the waiter arrives and places two high-stemmed, metal dessert cups on the table between us. I peer curiously into mine and my mouth waters at the sight of the perfect sphere of pale-green granita glittering in the sun. I can’t deny I was a bit nervous letting Harry go inside to handle our order, his first time since we got here and he can still barely pull off a simple
Maybe it’s genetic? Sirius used to talk to himself all the time, and whenever someone caught him doing it, he always laughed it off saying it’s what always gave him the best answers. And each time he did, Remus told him ‘talking to yourself may get you the answers you want, but not the ones you need’. What do you talk to yourself about?
PPS Okay, I cave. We need to talk about these ridiculous euphemisms of yours. You know writing stuff like ‘what the shell’ and ‘leave the duck alone’ makes you sound like a preschooler, right? Or a toddler’s parent. If anything, it reminds me of how Andromeda talks whenever Teddy’s around. Is it part of your haughty upbringing, not being allowed to curse or something, or are you just being snotty on purpose, to rub your refined superiority in my plebeian face?
I never said I didn’t have the urge to crucio that fucking bastard to the end of the earth and beyond. I did. And I certainly possessed the desire needed to do it, too, had I allowed myself to. But I didn’t. Not only because I was exhausted from a long night of no sleep and too much adrenaline, or because I was so fucking sick of all the fighting and just wanted it all to be over, but also because it felt so fucking good to be able to keep my cool, to rile him up by my mere calmness, to outwit that arrogant shit who thought he was so smart and yet, when it really mattered, understood nothing.
And now he’d gone and done it again; cursing an innocent victim with an unforgivable, harming another. And once it came out, Draco was doomed. He'd be expelled for sure. And without access to the school, he’d be unable to complete his task for the Dark Lord, which meant…
“Oh.” In the quiet relief from Fleur’s words, one question remained on the tip of Harry’s tongue. “What do you mean by a tether?”
my roommates’ unbelievably loud snores and the fucking sun glaring through the window, bouncing off the parchment and straight into my grainy eyes. And it’s all your fault, M. I swear, if it weren’t for you and your stupid Saturday owl, I’d… I’d be sound asleep right now, just like everyone else. But, nooooo……… Instead I’m up, fighting impending nausea and the headache from hell just to…
This place sure is a whole other world during hols. We’re only about a dozen students left over Easter and I don’t think the castle has ever felt more abandoned. Everyone who can just wants to be home with their families, I guess, especially now after the war. I could’ve gone too, of course, it’s not like I wouldn’t be welcome at the Burrow if I wanted to. Ron and Hermione and the others tried to talk me into joining them for weeks, and maybe I should have. I thought about it; even got as far as to start a letter to Molly telling her I’d come. But in the end, I just couldn’t do it.
Soft and slow may have been a nice idea in theory, and maybe — hopefully — they’ll be able to get back to that later. Right now, though, Harry needs more. He
Well, shit, I think this might just be my longest letter yet. I’m sorry for rambling on like this, but I guess it’s just yet another proof that I really don’t want to get back to my boring revisions. Procrastination at its finest. I better end this now, though, or I’ll risk missing the Ministry owl.
Draco’s mouth twitched at the corner, begging for permission to curve into an amused smirk. “Is that so?”
Draco didn’t want to like it, couldn’t allow himself to like it, but his self-preservation had apparently gone out to lunch because Draco didn’t have it in him to break away from Potter’s strong arms and solid frame. The man felt like a steady rock in the middle of a raging sea, an escape from the utter clusterfuck that had lately become Draco’s life. Wanting this,
Ron snorts, sending beer up his nose as Harry scowls. “I’m not like you, Malfoy. I’m not in it for a quick shag. I want to find someone to fall in love with, something real.”
Draco chuckled ruefully, but he managed to force himself down the ward until he reached the family milling about outside Charlie’s room. He looked past all the redheads, seeking out Sirius.
“Uh, thanks?” Draco turned to Molly and strode over to give her a hug. “I need to go, though. I’m pretty tired.”
"You know you're dancing now, right?" Draco said softly, his voice amused and his breath warm as it ghosted over the sensitive skin behind Harry's ear. "I thought we might have a little bit to eat, a glass of wine, and then as the sun sets behind the hill and we won't be seen, we could go for a fly."
After the initial shock had subsided, Draco had turned his gaze to Harry, finding him with an encouraging smile on his face, his emerald eyes sparkling with possibilities. Of course, Draco did the only thing that made sense; he snorted at the idea, waved it off, and left them to their nonsense in favour of some customers waiting for him at the counter. He’d immigrated to the Muggle world for a reason, for Circe’s sake; there was no way he’d be heading back anytime soon.
Harry’s eyes return to Draco, fighting the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Draco’s nose is scrunched up in that way Harry can’t help but find… adorable — a word he, not a year ago, had never contemplated using in conjunction with his former nemesis. Funny how life turns out sometimes.
Everyone looked at Harry, who shrugged and pointed at Draco. “Ask him. He was the one there feeding it.”
PS You think I had a privileged childhood? Seriously? One day, Malfoy, if you’re lucky, I may tell you all about it. For now, let’s just say it was everything yours wasn’t.
Pushing both hands through his hair — it’d have to do for now — Draco crossed his flat to the kitchen, turning on the hobs and starting to fill the kettle. Thoughts of the previous day swirled through his head as he went through the familiar motions of breakfast preparation, relying on his muscle memory to accomplish scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and buttered toast without his interference. He’d just poured the boiling water over his favourite loose-leaf breakfast tea when he heard a loud knocking coming from the other room.
Draco’s arms tighten around Harry’s waist, one hand holding him close while the other starts rubbing soothing circles up and down Harry’s back. “I thought…” Draco bites his lip as he looks up at Harry through long, golden lashes. “I thought you wanted this?”
Draco walked up to the cottage and crossed the worn wood of the porch in three long strides, passing the rocking chairs that always looked so welcoming. He jumbled the keys around, looking for what might be the correct one. On his second try, the key fit and he slipped inside.
“Draco?” I lean my ear against the cool, white wood, listening for a reply that never comes. I say it again, a bit louder this time but still as gentle as I can manage, careful not to let the alarm rising within me affect my voice. Still nothing.
Draco threw on his clothes and hurried through his ablutions. If something had happened to Charlie, the family would be devastated.
Somewhere behind Draco, someone snorted, and he stood up, deciding this was it; this was his moment to spill the truth. But then, Sirius stepped in. “Harry, shut up.” He cuffed Harry upside the head, making the man scowl. “Draco here has done nothing wrong. In fact, his presence has made this entire episode less terrible for all of us. He saved Charlie’s life, for Godric’s sake, and he’s putting up with your unfounded accusations with remarkable aplomb. You should apologise.”
People are even worse. Seeing your old housemates interact never fails to alert my attention to anything remotely close to a glimpse of pale-blond hair. And thanks to the bloody study groups, that no longer only happens during classes or meals.
“He’s berating us for doing this out here. He’s cold and says he doesn’t want to watch us... doing stuff.”
Harry reached out and stroked Draco’s hot cheek, smiling fondly when those beautiful eyes fluttered open. They were unfocused at first, dazed, but soon the misty grey cleared to bright silver as they found Harry’s gaze.
He may be fated with the same orphan destiny as I, but I’m eternally grateful to know that he’ll never have to suffer through the same loveless childhood I did. I wish I could assure you that my relatives treated me well before the first manifestation of my magic, but no. If I’m being perfectly honest, I can’t remember a single moment of love or affection aimed my way during my nearly 16 years in their ‘care’.
He set off down the street, his expensive shoes clicking on the pavement with each step and echoing off the buildings around him in the quiet night.
Draco looked around, searching for a glimpse of Harry’s messenger bag which he knew to contain what they’d need to get started. There were a lot of muscles to keep track of, Draco realised, so this could take a while. Not that Draco would mind if it did; it wasn’t like he itched to get back to his empty flat anytime soon.
A dark-haired man steps into your personal space and, as I watch him wrap his arms around your neck, something vicious growls in my chest. It’s the same beast that once used to rear its ugly head whenever I saw Gin together with Dean, the one I had all but forgotten about since then — until it suddenly stirred awake again a few weeks ago. I clench my jaw, willing the monster to calm down, knowing my only chance of survival is to eventually learn how to befriend it, to temper it, to tame it.
“Yes. I’ve had it with me every single day since.” Draco gave him a wry smile. “Some days, when times were really bad, it was the only thing that kept me going.”
Harry grinned, feeling happier than ever before. Who knew a trip to visit Santa Claus could actually make all your Christmas wishes come true?
“No, you idiot,” Draco chuckled, “the city. Mother and I went there several times when I was young. It was usually just the two of us, Father being busy at the Ministry or whatnot, and she and I would spend days wandering the shops and museums, stopping into cathedrals, and savouring granita in the sun at open-air cafés. We’d take a carriage through the countryside and visit vineyards, staying in villas of people she knew.” He paused and inhaled, the floral scents of spring in Florence flooding his memory. “I can still smell the wisteria. It was our special time together, and definitely the happiest times of my life.”
Potter was supposed to win this war, for Circe’s sake, not be taken captive and possibly offed as soon as the Dark Lord returned from his mission, if not before. The image of his blood-thirsty aunt popped into his head unbidden, all intense eyes and insane cackles.
Only a few days left now before your mother joins you. Which also means you’ll be halfway through your house arrest. I bet that must feel good, knowing you've made it this far? Have you given any thought to what you’d want to do once you get out of there?
Draco opened the door to find Harry sitting behind a large desk, a sleek laptop open in front of him. Harry didn’t look up as he mumbled, “Just a minute. I need to finish this email.”
Ernie looked up as Draco stood. “Are you stopping by the Foundation? I have the monthly staffing papers for Pansy.”
Draco tightened his hold on the coin, making a decision right then and there. Why wait? Surely he could start changing things for the better already tomorrow if he wanted to. Harry had said they were the same age, and that meant Harry would be on the train tomorrow. And he might have said they wouldn’t be friends at first, but the future wasn’t set in stone, was it? No. Draco would set things straight right away. He’d seek Harry out already on the train tomorrow, making sure not to waste a single day of friendship with the legendary Boy Who Lived.
“No?” Harry turned a sceptical eye towards Draco where he stood leaning against the counter only a few feet away.
since we first met, you’ve been nothing but a calculating, conniving bastard, and now, here you are, suddenly talking about stuff like desire, devotion, lust, and passion as if they
When Harry trailed off and Draco realised he wasn’t about to continue, he put the empty jar in the sink and took the dish from the counter.
N.E.W.T.s went okay, I guess. Not as stellar as yours would have been, but at least they’ll be enough to get me into auror training on my own merits. The practical exams went better than the theoretical — not that that should be a surprise for anyone — but I managed, and I’m so relieved it’s all over and done with.
Hermione, sitting next to him, must have been watching because she leaned over and nudged him. “Put it on. Everyone else is.”
Draco glanced over at Harry, who was currently smiling up at some wizard and his wife, making polite conversation despite the strained tiredness only Draco knew to detect in his perfectly friendly features. If Draco hadn’t already known how much Harry loved him, this, if anything, would’ve been the ultimate proof; Harry deciding to be here for Draco and his shop’s grand opening regardless of all the hero-worshipping thrown his way.
You’re on your way to a date. A date with a cute guy you haven’t been able to shut up about for days. I should have seen this coming from a mile away, and yet, for some reason, I haven’t. For some inexplicable reason, I haven’t prepared myself for this; for you getting out there, searching, dancing, flirting. Dating. For you eventually finding someone. Someone that’s not me.
"So I told Kingsley that I'd work for him part-time, but I really want to get my wizarding law mastery before I commit to a specific path," Hermione was saying to Percy who nodded.
Draco runs a gentle hand up Harry's thigh, and that helps as Draco bites his lip and pushes in deeper, unbelievably slow and yet almost too fast. Almost. Harry closes his eyes and feels every centimetre of Draco's progress. They must be about halfway there when Harry begins to feel like he might actually crack in half. Surely he'll never make it. Draco is just so big.
Draco knocked on the door to the office of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes at exactly seven o’clock that evening. He’d finished the muffins as planned, and with enough time to spare to allow him to clean up the kitchen and change his clothes. Granted, a shower would have been nice, but tardiness wasn’t something he generally tolerated, not even his own.
Out of the pair, the girl was always the one approaching the counter, placing their orders as her friend busied himself prepping their study session.
