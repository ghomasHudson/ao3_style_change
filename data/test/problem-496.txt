“I guess I’m worried about all of them,” Draco confessed, he looked down at his hands, then looked back up at Professor Babbling, who was still going on with an incredibly boring lecture that was supposed to be incredibly important.
Harry dropped to his knees and was immediately accosted by the huge Scottish Deerhound. He couldn’t help but talk to Snuffles in that stereotypical dog-parent voice as he said, “Hey, buddy! Did you miss me? Huh? Did you miss me?” The whines that came in reply only made Harry chuckle louder as he buried his hands in Snuffles’ wiry black fur, a full belly laugh that resonated in his whole body. Petting him all over only seemed to make the dog even more excited.
Draco fell asleep with the thought of seeing Harry soon making him smile.
Wetting his lips, Draco gave himself a moment’s hesitation before answering. “I want you. Hell, I want all of you, Harry.” If possible, his face felt even hotter and his heart pounded even faster. “I just… I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to talk about it before anything happened, you know?”
to see her suffer as he had. To see that flame of hers flicker and sputter—much like his own had. There was no doubt in his entire body that he would do the best he could to help her breathe that fire back to life.
“You wouldn’t happen to be hiding someone in that room, would you, Potter?”
“You’re worried about something. What is it?”
The movie had been over for thirty minutes. Harry had been gazing-staring-at a sleeping Draco, for thirty minutes. He busied himself with tracing the contours of his face, sharp and elegant; he played with his hair, soft and blond and it smelled like lemons; he traced the outline of his lips, full and pink. He knew he should awaken his boyfriend so that he could make it to his common room before curfew, but Harry didn’t want this moment to end.
It sounded eerily like Vernon yelling,
Sirius recounted the same sentiment, yet even to Harry’s bewilderment, he pulled Draco into a hug—loose enough to not be overbearing and short enough to not be completely awkward. When Sirius pulled back, he snorted in laughter at the dumbstruck expression on Draco’s face and patted his shoulder, effectively making the blush in his cheeks brighter and more prominent.
“I was just at my desk, drawing, when I heard my bedroom door open from behind me. My father came in and… and he got so
(See the end of the chapter for
“He sure is,” Harry agreed, laughing at Remus’ scoff. His eyes took in every inch of his sort-of cousin, sort-of nephew while he held him to his chest. Yes, Teddy was still as adorable as ever. “Your blue hair is going away, bud.”
Leaning forward, Draco reached up and pressed a kiss to Harry’s jaw as they walked in. He took in the bathroom around him, identical to the one in his own dorm room; the white tile floor, the diamond-shaped walk-in shower in one corner, the corner bathtub in the other, all of it.
So, with a long-suffering sigh, Harry began, “I guess Snape has this whole… grudge thing, against my father. I guess they went to school together or something when they were our age, I don’t know. But Snape never misses an opportunity to say something insulting about him.” Harry paused when he saw Draco looking up at him. The next words were harder to get out, it was a fight to get them past his lips. But he knew that if he didn’t say them now, it would be harder later. “It just sucks, because I didn’t get to know my father enough to prove him wrong.” He felt his boyfriend lay his head against his shoulder, the shorter boy wrapping his hand that wasn’t in Harry’s around his arm.
“Hi,” Draco breathed. He curled himself tighter under his thick blanket, a smile tugging at his mouth. “How are you?”
But somehow, this time felt different. He wouldn’t have the comfort of knowing that Harry was somewhere in the same building as him, not even a ten minute walk away. He wouldn’t have the luxury of just popping in Harry’s common room to see him, or staying the night in his warm bed.
Draco had to hold in his scoff—he settled for a cutting smirk instead.
Harry seemed to hesitate a moment before chuckles poured out of his own mouth, though Draco was positive it wasn’t for the same reason. Whatever the case, it didn’t seem to make Seamus any happier.
Instead, he only turned around and leaned back on the bathtub wall as droplets of water ran down his face. Then he felt Harry pour a generous amount of the shampoo on his hair, his fingers slowly working it in. Almost immediately, Draco practically
“I was sent to my only living relatives. My mum’s sister, Petunia, and her husband, Vernon. They’d had their own boy, Dudley, a few months before I was born, and Petunia hadn’t spoken to my mother in years, so they were none too happy to find out that they were the only ones left to take me. The Dursley’s took me in besides, I guess they figured that it was better than foster care.”
“Do you want me to go and get you some food from the kitchens?” Harry asked, his voice was gentle. He was friends with one of the nicest cooks there, Dobby, who pretty much let Harry in whenever he asked. He knew that Hermione had a Maths quiz today, and wouldn’t be able to concentrate if she didn’t eat something. But he was reluctant to leave her in the common room by  herself.
“What? Who is it?” Draco asked. He finally managed to convince himself to look out the window.
“I need a drink.”
sense. The fact that you even had the
When Draco looked up, Harry’s eyes were sparkling, and there was a daring smile set upon his lips. Those lips that Draco couldn’t seem to stop glancing at.
“Okay.” Harry hated the thickness in his voice. He hated that he was giving those people anything of himself, that he was wasting tears on them. And yet, he knew that he needed to get it out now before it became something bigger later.
close. A spark of possessiveness tried to take form in Harry’s chest, but he hastily stifled it.
or… or
For a moment, Harry thought Joan was going to interrogate him further, but to his relief, her face softened and she finally seemed to accept his answer.
“I love you,” Harry moaned.
“Well,” Harry said, a smirk on his face as he entwined his fingers with Draco’s, “no more waiting. I am all yours for the entire weekend.”
“Yes.”
Draco was quite confused, but replied, “Weasley? Yeah, I’ve seen him around, I suppose. Isn’t he the third member of your little trio?” Draco tried to lighten the atmosphere but gave up when he saw it did nothing for Harry.
He felt warm hands around his waist, one slipping down to grasp his hip and bring him closer to Harry’s body. Draco’s shirt rucked up a few inches; the warm sensation of Harry’s hand on his bare skin made him shiver in pleasure, eliciting an appreciative noise from Harry, deep and rumbling.
“Hey, Sirius.”
“You,” he said, moving his fingers to trace the lines of his shoulders, “are absolutely the most amazing sight to behold.”
Honestly, it was one of the most humiliating things that Harry had ever endured. Krum had gone out with him, without realizing it was a date.
Harry felt anger burning in his chest, rising up to form hateful, scornful words. But he knew that that wasn’t what Draco needed right now. So he smothered the feeling before it could snowball into something worse.
potential that Harry was sure he would be able to whip up into a formidable player in no time. He had been able to give Theo the spot on the team without favoritism clouding his judgment. Cedric had tried to corner him afterward, but Harry had efficiently put him in his place, as gently as he could manage. Afterward, Draco had practically dragged him to his dorm room, an easel and his assorted paints awaiting them.
“No, no, not really. I guess I just haven’t seen you out of school uniform since the airplane. You look… nice.”
Harry’s entire body froze, his fingers almost jerking off the knob. No, he couldn’t face his boyfriend. He wouldn’t be able to stand the disappointment that would no doubt be written on Draco’s face. He would crumble, collapse, fall apart. He.. he just couldn’t.
“Draco, you haven’t been doing anything naughty on that phone of yours, have you?” Pansy teased, her dark purple lips pulled into an almost malicious grin.
Harry shook his head as Hermione laid her hand on his shoulder. All Harry could see was Uncle Vernon shutting the door of his little cupboard under the stairs, shouting at him for talking back, those awful names-
“It’s too early to be awake on a Saturday,” Draco whispered, tracing the shape of Harry’s mouth while his other hand was still massaging his head. “So why are you up?”
The thought sent uneasiness flooding his body, his veins. But before he showed any outward signs of his panic, Harry buried the feeling. This was something important to Draco, and he would keep his word.
. One of Harry’s hands came up to hold Draco’s face, and it felt even better than Draco had imagined. Harry’s lips were soft and full, and gentle as they moved against Draco’s own. The blond could feel himself melting against the bigger boy’s body, coming in closer to close the gap between them.
After class, Draco quickly grabbed his things and headed straight for the library, barely giving a farewell to his friends as he left. He tried not to appear too rushed to the students that were surely heading to their common rooms.
And he was in the perfect position to pass to Harry.
Draco turned to face his boyfriend. “Am not!”
They’d been texting and calling each other nearly nonstop since Draco had left two days ago. Harry had called him each night before he went to bed, asking for every dull detail of Draco’s day, from what he’d drawn in his sketchbook to what he’d eaten for breakfast. The blond was just as information-hungry, practically demanding to know everything about his boyfriend’s day along with their friends’. Secluded in this house, Draco felt isolated from the people he’d made into his own makeshift family.
Harry stopped her with a hand on her wrist, gently pulling her back to sit down. He wasn’t looking at either of them. He
Draco waited.
“Class starts in a few minutes, baby. As much as I would love to make out with you right now, I’ve gotta go, or Professor McGonagall will kick my ass.”
“That’s not even the best part, Sirius,” Harry sighed, cutting off his godfather. The panic that had subsided before threatened to return, but he took a few deep breaths to ground himself. “Petunia sent me a letter.”
Finally, he managed to dig the cell phone out of Draco’s pocket without dislodging him from his clinging position, Harry looked at the caller ID. He took a moment trying to register what he was seeing.
Harry pursed his lips, fisted the fabric of Pansy’s shirt in his hand, and counted backward from ten in his head. By the time he looked back up again, he realized that Hermione had already started scolding Ron.
Pansy smacked his arm, “Shut up, Potter.” Harry simply laughed at her as she swaggered off. He looked back at Hermione across from him, who was peering at him with an unreadable expression on her face. Her dark eyes were examining him like she would a science experiment. She glanced behind him, then back at Harry.
The grin that split Harry’s lips was impossibly big. “Yeah?”
Draco opened his mouth to object, but seemed to understand Harry’s earnestness. Harry couldn’t even stop to admire the blossoming blush on Draco’s face before he said, “Meet me after class today, in the library. We can study together, and I’ll tell you everything, alright?” Draco nodded eagerly, and Harry smiled at him again, kissing his other cheek before taking off for the kitchens again.
“There was no one else?” Draco could sense the dislike towards his relatives rolling off of Harry in waves. His words had a sharp edge—as if he wished he could use them to cut any ties to his aunt and uncle.
“Sushi sounds good,” Blaise commented. In the rearview mirror, Draco saw Hermione nod in agreement. Tilting his head in interest, he noticed she was playing with her fingers, noticed the fleeting glances she gave him as they talked quietly with one another.
All of a sudden, Harry felt Pansy throw her arms around his neck, pressing her lips to his cheek in a quick kiss before bringing her body closer to his until she was halfway in his lap. “Thank you,” she said, “for not letting Ron get away with what he said to Draco.” Harry nodded, peering over her shoulder to see Blaise and Theo, both looking at him with soft smiles.
Draco grunted. “Not good enough.” His pale, cold fingers slipped under Harry’s shirt, sliding up the toned lines of his lower stomach. The sensation never failed to send tingles down Harry’s spine, goosebumps erupting on his skin, and a rush of a cool sort of warmth through his veins. Draco’s lips shifted down to his neck, pressing a kiss there. Harry tilted his head to give him better access, his eyes flickering shut and a soft smile spreading on his lips at the gentle manner in which Draco proceeded to kiss him.
Harry held Pansy close to him, soothingly running his fingers through her hair until he felt her quivering come to a stop. Her arms loosened around him, but her hands were fisted firmly in his shirt against the small of his back. Harry felt her taking slow, deep breaths in tandem with him.
that our situations aren’t exactly alike. But I hope that you can find a way to do what you want to. For
And then, twenty-three left herself open, just long enough for Harry to dash in and steal the ball. He dribbled up the field, eluding Ilvermorny’s players with rapid movements. But one player got too close too fast for Harry to evade, so he kicked the ball to Katie, who passed it to Fred. Harry sprinted to Ilvermorny’s goal, never letting the ball or the players leave his sight.
It reminded Harry of how they met on the plane; Draco falling asleep on Harry and wrapping his arms tightly around the boy. (He couldn’t believe that they’d come this far, from strangers to curling up together in Harry’s bed. He felt balanced; he hadn’t realized it until Draco first wrapped his cold hands around his arm, but Harry felt too hot, uncomfortably warm without the other boy. It was like he evened Harry out—like he was the missing piece in his puzzle) Harry settled to finish the movie with Draco wrapped around him.
Almost the entire back seat of Harry’s Camaro was filled with bags from Joan of Art, and the peaceful feeling blossoming in Draco’s chest was worth every penny he would be paying back. The warm spring air blew into the car through the open windows as Harry drove. One of his hands held Draco’s over the console—the same hand that Draco held to his lips, gingerly and leisurely kissing each of his fingers from knuckle to tip.
Until his bedroom door opened from behind him.
Harry managed a small smirk, letting out a barked laugh. “I’ll damn well confess my undying love to you whenever and wherever I feel like it.”
Driving safely was truly a feat for Harry when Draco was sitting right next to him. Especially with the way he traced shapes on Harry’s palm, the serene expression on his face, the slight dampness of his braided hair.
“So, Harry, my
“Well,” Remus said, leisurely standing from his seat, “it’s getting late, Nymphie’s going to be home with the kids soon, and Harry, you and Draco need to get back to campus before curfew.”
Draco practically beamed down at the other boy, for once taller than him.
Luckily for him, and the rest of the football team, Coach Hooch walked in, blowing her neon orange whistle to get their attention. “Alright, you sweaty pigs, you’re off for the night,” at this, there were several sighs of relief and exhaustion among the already heavy breathing, “and take the weekend to rest up before we get started again Monday afternoon.” Here there were mixed signals, hollers of joy for the weekend, and groans at the mention of Monday.
The gates that surrounded Malfoy Manor looked more like a cage in the face of the midnight sky. Harry had already called Draco to tell him that he had arrived as he’d parked the car in front of them. He was currently pacing back and forth in front of the black, wrought iron gates, not caring about the chill in the air. Behind them was a long driveway that led to a menacingly large manor with huge, ornately carved doors—doors that suddenly opened.
Harry recognized the tension in Theo’s body. He knew the paralyzing dread that was warring with the anticipation in his veins. The first game was always nerve-wracking, setting the tone for someone’s experience during the rest of the season. It didn’t help that this game would either make or break their way to the championships, and Theo had only been on the team for a few days.
to hear them fall from his lips, like honey pouring in his ear, pleasure overflowing his senses. (But deeper than that, he felt that the pet-names were
“You talked with Pansy?”
“Not even close.”
The bigger boy simply gave him a soft smile and wrapped his arms around the blond. Draco’s brain went haywire. He was touching Harry’s bare chest. He was being held against Harry’s brown, muscled, slightly damp, bare chest. His skin was even warmer without the barrier of clothes between them. The shorter boy could smell the soap on his ridiculously smooth skin. Harry’s body felt like silk-covered steel, soft to the touch but hard and strong underneath. Draco let his arms come around Harry—but felt him stiffen when he touched his back. Draco almost pulled away in fear that he may have crossed a boundary, but Harry quickly relaxed again and only pulled Draco closer to him, pressing a kiss under his ear that made the smaller boy lightly shudder.
fine! I heard everything. Harry, you got detention because of me!”
Harry’s eyes were wide at her implications. “I don’t—Pansy I don’t think it was me. I think he did it by himself.”
Out of Ron’s view, Harry touched his hand to her back as both a
If both Draco and Hermione were with him, then there was no way he wasn’t safe. It wasn’t just feeling unsafe that kept his hand gripping his chest or curled into himself, but the sooner he could start swimming through the fear, the sooner he would breathe air again.
Draco thought,
The only downside to Harry’s car was the heater. It always took what seemed like forever to warm up. The chill in the air seeped into Draco’s bones. He wrapped his arms around himself, trying to conserve what warmth he had left. Luckily for Draco, Harry noticed his shivering.
“Oh my hell,” Harry said, loosening his grip on Draco.
“This,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand again, twining their fingers together, “is my boyfriend, Harry.”
When they arrived at Harry’s car, all four of their friends were huddled around it, unprepared for the chill in the early spring air. Draco was still clinging to Harry’s back, but he didn’t mind carrying his lightweight boyfriend around if it made him happy and got him to eat.
But then Harry was jostling his shoulder, saying, “Draco, look!”
Harry smiled at him teasingly, “Awake at last?”
And then promptly threw him over his shoulder.
“I can’t say that I forgive you right now,” Harry said. “But thank you.”
fine.
what I meant.”
“You,” he answered, breathless and decided. “I want you, Harry. I want all of you. I want you to make love to me, I want you inside me, God,
He traced the line of each and every scar with his fingers, then with his lips. He pressed kisses to every inch of skin on Harry’s back, every scar, small or otherwise.
of it—Draco loved every moment of it, craved him, wanted him in every way. It felt as though Harry’s hands were touching him everywhere at once, his heart was beating so fast he was sure it would burst from his ribs.
Only, they lost the sparkle they had seconds before. In their stead came a steady coldness that spoke volumes, even from across the hallway, where Harry kept walking in the direction that Draco had just come from. His smile slipped and melted off his face, as Harry slightly shook his head, leaned closer to his red-haired friend and whispered something, who then gave him a similar look.
Theo jumped up from the ground, shock painting every feature on his face. “You’re kidding, right?”
Laughter rose unbidden in Harry as she released him, only to look up at Harry with a sharp smirk on her lips—one that almost seemed to spite the redness of her eyes. He knew for a certainty that he would be hearing from her over the weekend.
Instead, Draco had grudgingly forced himself out of bed. He’d quickly shimmied into his clothes from the day before and pressed light kisses to his boyfriend’s forehead and the center of his chest before creeping his way through the corridors back to his own dormitory.
Draco lifted his face and brushed his nose against Harry’s. “Is that so?” His hands smoothed up the expanse of Harry’s chest until his arms wrapped around the taller boy’s shoulders, leaving chilled fire and threads of pleasure in their wake.
“Harry,” Draco pleaded, now standing just behind the bigger boy, “stop and look at me, please.”
A boisterous laugh burst from his mouth as Harry practically dropped his boyfriend into the grass, laughing harder at Draco’s pouting face.
Harry’s eyebrow rose and an amused smile quirked at his mouth. A long-suffering sigh blew out of his lips. “Alright, but only because you’re
Harry watched intently as Draco wet his lips before he whispered back, “You know the empty classroom on the third floor?” He paused when Harry nodded. “Meet me there at midnight tonight.”
Harry groaned. “I’m not an invalid, you know.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Pansy whispered, “Harry isn’t dating Cedric for a reason, Draco. If he wanted to be with him, he would be. But he wants to be with you. I can promise you that.”
Her response was immediate, he hadn’t even put his cell down.
Later that night, sleep found Draco easily. All the worry that had been niggling away at his brain had been silenced. Contentment and peace seemed to wrap around him, brought about by simply replaying Harry’s words over and over in his mind.
“Hermione, what’s going on?” Draco asked, trying his best to ignore Ronald’s presence looming over his shoulder and keep his internal screaming in check. Even he could hear the fear and anxiety threaded in his words. Seeing Harry like this… Draco didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what this was, didn’t know what was happening to him, any of it.
Laughter burst from Harry’s mouth, causing Pansy’s sharp grin to widen. He’d grown fond of her teasing in the past few months; she was something different, always keeping him on his toes.
After a second’s hesitation, he felt Harry’s fingers card through his hair. The soothing sensation eased the ache in his chest, if only by a little.
“I suppose I could,” he whispered.
Harry looked back down at him rain dripping down his face and beading in his hair. There was a bright grin on his face, and Draco knew that for whatever reason, he was happy to be out in the rain if it meant being with Harry. “What, you don’t want to dance in the rain with me?” He brought Draco closer to his body—still warm even in the shivering rain—with his hands at his waist.
There was a soft smile on his face like he’d been waiting for this moment to happen. Perhaps the circumstances were less than ideal, but Draco cherished it anyway.
(The intent was not lost on Harry, either.
Draco could feel his hands sweating. He had followed Harry all the way back to his common room in the northern dormitories, where Harry had gone inside to get Hermione. Draco was alone to ruminate in his thoughts. They weren’t very pleasant ones.
All Hermione could do was crawl in next to him, her chest to his back, her arm around his chest, hugging him from behind. Her other hand was combing through his damp hair.
“I have pictures of some of his stuff.” Harry pulled his phone out and started scrolling through his photos, grinning to himself at all the ones that were of Draco. Draco smiling and laughing, Draco with surprised eyes and whipped cream on his nose, slightly annoyed Draco with his eyebrow arched sky-high. “It’s not nearly as good as seeing them in person, but they’re amazing.” Harry handed Sirius the phone. It didn’t take long for both he and Remus to develop awe-stricken smiles and wide eyes.
Harry would gladly help Draco stand when he couldn’t do it on his own.
“I swear, Harry, he’s worse than Teddy, climbing all over you,” Hermione laughed.
“Narcissa, please,” she corrected. A wave of fondness swept over him as he nodded his head. She looked past both of them at Harry’s car, saying, “You get him in the car, I’ll put the bags in the trunk.”
“Oh, yes,” Harry said, his arms draping around Draco’s slim waist, a feeling of awe crawling inside him. “Someone
The instant that Theo stood up, looking menacing and ready for a fight, Pansy reached out and grabbed his wrist before he could even take a step.
So, with a deep sigh through his nose, Draco gestured with his head to proceed, closely watching his every move. As soon as Harry registered the water being handed to him, he immediately unscrewed it and began drinking as fast as he could. It didn’t even look like he was
want to go back there, Sirius.” Harry swallowed, surprised to find that his body seemed to have enough energy to make tears build up behind his eyes. Just not enough to stop them from falling. “I don’t want to see
Hermione nodded her head, but Harry wasn’t sure she was entirely convinced. He figured she wouldn’t be for a long while.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m fine.” Though his tone was gentle along with how he disentangled his fingers, Draco saw the stifled irritation in the jerky movement that Harry made to grab his gym bag. “I need a shower.”
The breath rushed out of Harry’s lungs, he could feel his eyes darken, his hand tightened on Draco’s side, fingers dipping under his shirt, tracing the lines of his hip bone.
“Well...” Draco floundered for a second. “Well, you’re the one who was groping my ass!”
Blood rushed to Draco’s face. He felt it staining his skin; his ears felt hot. The sheets were crumpled in his twitching fingers. He wasn’t ashamed of Harry—not in a million years—but he knew some of the things he’d written in his letters were a bit… embarrassing. Humiliating. Cliche. Juvenile. But in his defense, Harry was someone he thought was
the one with the flashlight, go in front of us so we can see where we’re going.”
Draco choked. “
“Ron, he apologized to me, and I’m okay with Harry seeing him. Why are you being so stubborn about this?”
Harry parked the car in the school’s garage, and this time Draco opened his own door before Harry could get there. Harry had the bags in one hand, and grasped Draco’s in the other, their hands swinging slightly between them.
Draco knew that Harry’s parents had passed away when he was little, but looking back now… Harry always seemed to evade questions about his childhood, or who’d raised him. It was like he’d had practice doing it.
Harry had anticipated the speech to come before Theo even started it. He’d spent all night trying to mentally prepare himself for it, because he knew what, or who,  it would remind him of.
“Come on, Katie,” Harry said, bent over with his hands on his knees, “just three more and then you can move on.” His own skin was slick with sweat, soaking into his tank top. The muscles in his legs were pleasantly sore from the unexpectedly extended run he’d led the team on.
Draco knew he was being slightly unreasonable. He was well aware that Harry was captain of the football team and therefore couldn’t miss practices or meetings. He knew that Harry wanted to be with him as much as Draco wanted to be with Harry.
“On a date.”
. Was that,” Draco seethed. It didn’t sound so much like a question as a demand, an order.
Harry howled with laughter, and it was such a wonderful sound that Draco couldn’t even stay mad at him. He even thought he heard his boyfriend snort, he was laughing so hard. Shaking his head, Draco just grabbed his hand and continued walking to his common room. The laughter only started dying down after he—completely accidentally—stepped on Harry’s foot. Hard.
The day before had left him completely drained—physically, mentally, emotionally, all of it. His chest ached, something he knew would persist for a few days at most, his mind felt like a mess, he hadn’t been able to concentrate in almost all his classes, and his entire being just
“That’s awful, Harry. I’m so sorry,” Draco gave Harry’s hand a squeeze, and tried to give him a reassuring smile. He took Harry’s hand and started tracing shapes on his palm.
And froze when he saw Draco leaning against the wall on the opposite side of the room. Harry’s shoulders tensed slightly.
Draco’s perfectly sculpted brow arched at him.
“Hello, Malfoy,” she said, “are you coming to sit with us?” Draco’s heart stopped at those words. He looked back up at Harry. With a surge of unfounded courage, he asked, “Would that be alright with you?”
Ron’s eyes dropped and he nodded his head in acquiescence. “I… Yeah. Yeah, okay.”
Figuratively, of course.
“Will you help me carry these to my room?” Draco knew he was blushing. He also knew that there was nothing he could do about it at this point; he may as well get used to it now.
“Nuh-uh!” Teddy laughed, trying to push Harry’s hands away. “Da’s just
“I love you, Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispered. His fingers began tracing circles into Draco’s skin, and Draco’s laugh turned into a smile that made his cheeks ache. His chest filled with butterflies, his heart was bursting at the seams.
” Hermione exclaimed though she was careful not to be too loud. Draco shifted his head so he could look at her over Harry’s shoulder. Her hand was buried in her dark curls, the entirety of her small frame was tensed. Her black eyes flicked to Draco, then she said, “Try talking to him, whispering to him. It’s soothing to hear someone else’s voice other than the one in his head.”
Harry saw Theo glance over his shoulder, worry furrowing his brows before he looked at Ron. His face became harder than stone, his eyes turned fierce. Theo looked back at Harry before Pansy tugged on his arm to take the turn down the hall, and they all disappeared.
Harry. All of it. Every contradicting emotion and thought in his mind and body threatened to stifle the very breath that gave him life. Crying, sobbing like a child made him feel weak—but he couldn’t find it in himself to stop. He was so impossibly relieved to be going home to his family, and yet, he was…
“I met Pansy when we were ten. She accused me of stealing her hair ribbons,” Draco chuckled, remembering how angry she had been, calling him a thief and a scoundrel. “Even though I hadn’t done it, I’d felt so awful for her that I asked my mother to pick out some new ribbons for me to give to her. She wouldn’t leave me alone afterward, so we just kind of stuck together.”
Harry huffed a laugh and slid his hands up and down Draco’s spine. “I like that one, too.” Lifting his head, Harry smirked at his boyfriend, adoring and crooked at the same time. He quite enjoyed the way Draco looked back at him—all smitten and rosy and beautiful. “
“You too, Harry.” Joan turned back to Draco. “So, what brings you here after all these months? I was under the impression that you
Harry reached over Draco to grab the basket and place it on the other side of the bed.
Draco burst out laughing. Here he was, in his boyfriend’s bed, in his boyfriend’s dormitory, with no idea where his shirt was, and what he was sure was a hickey on his neck. He could only imagine the look on his mother’s face if she could see him now, let alone his father.
Even though Harry wasn’t the same thirteen-year-old boy that he’d been when he first met Sirius, the feeling of complete safety in his arms had never faded. Though he wasn’t as naive and helpless as he had been, Sirius always embodied what Harry thought of as
any of your exes. But it doesn’t make me uncomfortable. Or think any less of you.”
wet kitten.”
“And it really is okay. Besides, you’re cute when you sleep.”
By the time the plane landed in London, Harry and Draco had woken up a few unhappy passengers around them with their laughter and constant talking. Harry had learned that they were both heading to the same boarding school, and it was a tragedy that they hadn’t run into each other before then. Harry had asked Draco if he wanted to take a taxi together, and to his strangling relief, Draco’s eyes had lit up when he said yes.
His heart twisted at the sight of her. Draco hadn’t seen her as anything but strong and composed. When Harry had described her as heartbroken a few months before, he hadn’t even been able to imagine it.
Although seeing his boyfriend and his mother shake hands and smile kindly at each other warmed the pit of Draco’s stomach, watching Harry and his father glower at each other was reasonably frustrating. The scowl on his father’s face was nothing new to Draco—he’d been on the receiving end of it more than his fair share. But the stony, icy expression on Harry’s face? Draco could use the fingers on one hand to count the number of times he’d seen it.
“If I were you, I think I would be a little more embarrassed about the hickey on my neck.”
“It’s just… you’ve been quiet all morning.” Harry raised his hand to rub at the back of his neck. Green eyes shuttered. “I just worry. That maybe me talking about Cedric made you uncomfortable. That maybe yesterday freaked you out, that—that
Now, Friday evening, Harry was finishing wrapping his hands in the weight room. The punching bag in the corner was looking particularly punchable. His vision was tinged red, his jaw clenched so tightly he was sure his teeth would crumble with the pressure. With every swing at the bag he let out a sharp breath, Snape’s words repeated in his head, screaming and tearing at his insides.
“It’s really okay, I don’t mind,” he stuck his hand out toward Draco. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.”
“When you get back,” Draco’s thumb came to caress Harry’s bottom lip, “promise me you’ll let me paint you for as long as I want.”
and you
“Just wait.”
“No.” Harry gritted his teeth and shifted in his seat, closer to Draco. “Coach and I are holding try-outs.”
“He’s been at his parent’s house for the past few days—it was his mother’s birthday yesterday.” Harry looked at both Sirius and Remus, giving them his
Harry abandoned the toiletries he’d been packing and walked over to where Draco stood by his bed. He could practically feel the agitation oozing off of the smaller boy as he gently hugged him from behind, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and hunching over to set his chin on his shoulder. The fabric of his pull-over sweater was soft against his hands. He felt Draco freeze, then all the tension seemed to melt from his body. His arms dropped to his sides and his head came back to rest on Harry’s shoulder.
“I’m sorry.” Harry opened his eyes and folded his arms across his chest. His voice was quiet, almost fragile. “I’m so sorry, that I made you feel like that. I know I should’ve asked him to leave, I should’ve pushed him away. I just—I was shocked, and I didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t want to hurt him. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry.”
Harry opened the door when Draco knocked with a remorseful look in his green eyes. The shame buried itself deeper in Draco’s gut just looking at him. But then he recalled how Harry hadn’t done anything to push Cedric away. He hadn’t told him that his advances weren’t welcome. He hadn’t done anything but talk and smile at him. The scene replayed itself over and over in his mind, and each time the focus turned to Cedric and his stupidly handsome face.
“You want me to teach you to box?”
“Yeah, I just need a shower, and then we can go do whatever you want,” Harry replied with a creeping smile. He leaned forward and unwrapped Draco’s hands, making sure there was no bruising on his pale knuckles. (Harry loved the color of Draco’s skin, white as porcelain and smooth like glass) After unwrapping his own hands, he intertwined his fingers with his boyfriend’s and started walking for the showers.
Draco’s head snapped up, his grey eyes flashing with worry. Harry took a moment to just gaze at his eyes before speaking.
The pressure behind Harry’s eyes built up until he couldn’t hold it in. Tears fell down his face, leaving wet spots on Draco’s shirt.
Harry could feel Hermione’s shoulders shaking with silent tears. He opened the door to the common room, and Hermione let out a loud, heartbreaking sob that made Harry pick her up bridal style and carry her over to one of the couches. She weighed almost nothing to him, but the gravity of her sorrow laid heavy on his shoulders. He sat on the couch with her in his lap, cradled against his chest. She was clutching at his shirt, heart-wrenching whimpers and sobs wracking through her entire body as Harry tried his best to soothe her with soft words and cooing noises that Hermione had used for him on more than one occasion, rubbing her back and clutching her body to his own.
“Your damn boyfriend! He hurt her, Harry. And—”
He just shrugged. “It’s not your fault, ‘Mione. But we should really get to class.”
Draco watched as Harry completely melted. Every ounce of tension in his body thawed. He practically fell back onto the stairs and gently pulled Hermione to his body. She curled into him, closing her eyes and burying her face in his chest. Over her head, Harry looked at Draco. He smiled softly and reached out one of his hands to the smaller boy, beckoning him to them. Draco felt his heart fluttering as he took his boyfriend’s hand.
Immediately, the sleep that had riddled his body dissipated. Faster than lightning, Draco shot up and snatched the phone from Harry’s hands, staring at it for a moment before answering.
He didn’t mind the saliva at all. Harry hadn’t realized how much he’d missed his dog until he was finally faced with him. Snuffles’ hazel eyes seemed to hold the same amount of fulfilled longing.
Harry scowled at his godfather’s suggestively laughing smirk and Remus’ embarrassed eyes. “Not like that, you
“So, did you have fun, at least?” Harry asked.
“I think I may have done something, but I’ve no idea what.”
the one that told you to sneak out after curfew, it’s my fault you got caught.” Draco felt his eyes watering.
The screams of the crowds echoed in Harry’s ears. His heart pounded in his chest. His body ached in the most pleasant way possible, flooded with adrenaline. Sweat coated his body, a sheen on his forehead. His eyes roved over the football field, tracking each and every player in sight, sensing those he couldn’t see. His legs were aching to race after the ball that was in Ilvermorny’s possession, rolling up and down the field between their players, but he knew he had to wait for the perfect opportunity. There were only ninety seconds left on the clock for the last half of the game, and he had to make them count.
, Harry. I’m not
intimidating.”
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. Harry wanted to walk with him?
“Yeah?”
“Apparently. But he wouldn’t tell me anything until you got here.”
But before Draco could take it any further, Harry pulled away and continued walking down the aisle toward a shelf of picture frames, pushing the cart in front of him. The irked groan that came from Draco behind him only made the devious smirk on his lips grow, light laughter shaking his shoulders.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
There was no real reason for Draco to hesitate like this. He should have already busted down the door and demanded to know where Harry was from the first person he saw.
Until there was a loud, sharp knock on the driver’s side window.
Draco looked up, and immediately looked like he was at a loss for words, his face was flushing red. “Well, I… uh…” His hand clenched around Harry’s like a silent plea for help.
Somehow he managed to ignore that fact, and took her hand, sitting on the bed next to her, his eyes fixed on Harry.
Harry yanked him back towards him.
“Do you want to go out with me?” Harry interrupted, the words having leaped from his mouth without his own consent. The adrenaline was still rushing through his veins, his chest was heaving with hard breaths.
She sniffed in a sarcastic manner. “Well enough.”
“Harry,” Sirius cut in, his voice somehow stern and gentle at the same time, “nothing you feel is stupid. Now, you can continue without self-deprecation, or you can sleep.”
“No, no, I wanna talk.” Harry swallowed hard. He could feel his Adam’s apple bob with the force of it. Though he was afraid of the disappointment he might face, Harry knew he needed to talk now. He didn’t think he could garner the courage to do it again later.  “I… I haven’t been able to sleep. The nightmares have been worse. It’s stupid, really—”
"Can I help you find anything?" I jumped and turned quickly, coming face to face with wide green eyes framed by round black glasses.
After stuttering pathetically, I grabbed a random book and held it up, grinning and mumbling, "Yep, that's the one... Ah, yep. Just gonna open those pages and turn the book. Gonna- yup." Before shuffling past the green-eyed, messy haired god before me. He was seriously gorgeous. I was blushing while I brought the book up to the counter, looking away quickly when Remus smirked at me.
“Because it’s with another boy?” I called back, feeling uncomfortable with myself for a moment. As much as my father said he was okay with my sexuality, I know he still wished I was straight.
“That’s sweet!” Remus smiled, “I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.”
I had managed to escape the accident with a broken elbow, broken pelvis and stitches, with only a scar on my forehead and sometimes soreness if I stood too much as a reminder.
“But you called him Sam.” She insisted. I caved.
“There.” I murmured, setting her hands over the blanket. “It’s a bit chilly in here. Uncle Vernon said he had to turn down the heat a bit because it was costing too much, so you can borrow my quilt for a while.” I played with the edge of the blanket idly, watching my hands move. “Um, I’m paying for food this week, so ignore me if I come to sleep on the floor again.”
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying?” I asked. I was amused to find his face turning rosy, his impassive expression fighting against embarrassment.
“It’s a good book. You work here; surely you get absorbed in books sometimes?” I defended myself. Harry scratched behind his head when he pulled his oven mitt off, a regular habit of his.
“No, no, no. You didn’t ruin anything, Harry.” I swallowed my own tears, tucking him closer with my chin. “I’m sorry.” I whispered. “I’m sorry you have to go home to that. I’m sorry that you think you’re broken and have to work so hard. You’re so amazing, Harry.” His breathing jumped, hands loosening in my shirt. “You’re so sweet and incredible, and I’m sorry you can’t see it. I’m sorry you can’t see yourself like I see you. I’m sorry I can’t do more for you,
Immediately, Harry sat up, pulling me up with him. He held my face and leaned his forehead against mine.
“And tell Luna that I don’t care what the bastards say; if she wants to sit with me at lunch then she damn well can.” He let out a short laugh, nodding again.
going to give me a sex-talk. That was
“Too obvious.” I denied. “My clothes are expensive and it shows.” She pursed her lips slightly, but her eyes stayed wide and content.
“Well, I dunno about
stuff.” I rolled my eyes, rolling over so I wasn’t facing the door.
you?”
“You used to tell me you thought Legolas was handsome, and that you wished you could go and live with him in his forest.” I blushed.
As I was saying, one Sunday, I was once again in the fiction section, this time looking for one of my usual fantasy novels. The shop owner, and one of Harry’s godparents, Remus was looking through their latest sales with his rectangle framed glassed slipped down his nose. He was just as friendly as Harry was, which only strengthened the argument of the fact that Harry was merely friendly, and not flirty, and that his was a trait learned from his family. We were on good terms, as I was a regular customer and getting closer to Harry, but we rarely spoke past what new books he was planning on buying or what upgrades could be made to the building.
“Keep it as a tip.” I insisted, closing the shop door behind me. As I passed the windows, I looked back to see Harry smiling to himself, putting the change in a cup beside his cash till.
There was a girl with long blonde hair at the coffee counter, wearing a denim skirt and bright neon leggings, bundled up in an orange coat. She was talking quietly to Harry.
The soft, unique smell of books surrounded me as I stepped into the shop, a light tinkling noise following me as the door closed behind me. A tall, thin, and slightly rumpled man smiled at me from behind the counter, his amber eyes weathered, but bright with intelligence and happiness.
“I won't be falling on my eye-”
The next chapter is longer than usual!
“We have Chemistry together. I’m Hermione.” Ah, yes. Know-it-all.
“I remember you. You came here just after the Holidays.”
“That’s nice. It’s nice to meet you.” It would be
“See you tomorrow.” He said decisively. I was just about to leave when he called after me, “Oh, Draco! You left extra here!” He held up some money and I waved him off.
“Uh, thanks.” I mumbled. Harry laughed.
“Yeah. Thought I’d try something new.” I watched him take a sip, his eyes falling shut.
“We should make it a regular thing.” I suggested. “We could go ice skating next week.” Harry paused on the sidewalk in front of me, letting me catch up. His cheeks were rosy from cold and joy, and I wanted to touch his face.
“God, that’s good.” Draco whispered, licking foam off his top lip. I smiled, feeling my chest puff proudly.
“Ah, yes. That’s good.” He echoed. We were quiet again, my mother continuing to eat and scowling at my father while I mixed my corn and potatoes together. “Er, well, Draco… Is something bothering you?” As much as my father was supportive of my sexuality, he really wasn’t interested in my feelings or affairs.
“So,” I broke the silence that fell over us for a few moments. “If you want to, you, Neville and Luna can come to my flat sometime over the hols to hang out.” I munched on my food and watched his reaction. I knew he would be nervous. Harry bit his lip and put his sandwich down for a moment to pull up his sleeves.
The door to their apartment was open a crack, and I pushed it open.
"Uh... okay, sure. See you around." I took off running again, a bit slower this time.
“Oh,” I reached across the table and took his hand gently. “What happened to your arm?” Harry let me hold his arm, his eyes going wide and worried.
“I don’t want to bug him-”
My godfathers remained gentle and quiet, as though they were waiting for it as well, but it never seemed to come. All that happened was a tender sort of hurt, curling up inside my chest like a fresh, shiny scar. Like the wound my parents’ accident left had fully healed, and the newly knit scab was merely being prodded. And as the days passed, and life continued, and I did not crumble, I finally felt some closure.
“No, it's not bad.” Luna focused on my cheek for a moment. “You know, maybe Draco is right. Maybe we've been hurting you by not talking about it rather than helping you. I never wanted to hurt you, Harry. I hope you know that.” I swallowed the lump growing back in my throat.
How could I let myself get carried away?
“Oh, it’s confusing. Here, let me...” I turned the telly on and handed her the remote, letting her change it to a cooking show.
books like that, where you get so lost that nothing else exists, nothing but you and the story. I stood up and stretched, groaning quietly and picking up my empty cup. Maybe I’d get a refill for my walk home. It was still pretty chilly out there. I followed my nose over to Harry’s coffee counter, pointedly ignoring Remus winking at me. Good god, what did he say while I was in the zone? Harry straightened up from his little oven, a tray of cinnamon buns in his gloved hands.
“Okay, Harry. It’s okay.” I pulled away, wiping at my face shamefully. I was strong. I had to be.
"Remus, I'm so sorry I'm late!" My godfather and boss smiled slightly in empathy.
“I don’t know, Remus. I’d rather hear it from him. It’s not that I don’t trust you.” I assured him. “But if he does have interest in me, I want to hear it from him.” Remus nodded.
“I’m here.” We looked at each other for a short moment, and I smiled widely. “How about you show me where it is you hide all lunch?” I suggested. Harry chuckled and tugged at my sleeve.
“Honestly, Dray.” Harry laughed, hitting my arm playfully. My heart skipped a beat. He hadn’t called me that before, only in my dream that morning. “Have you met Remus? He’s bent like an old spoon. Really, it’s fine.” I couldn’t help the laugh that escaped me. I wanted to hug him.
“That’s great! Well, I hope you like it here.”
A longer moan, hands gripping my hair tightly.
“It was alright. My maths teacher seems to like me, and I was asked to join a group for lunch.” I replied noncommittally.
“But you really should be icing it so it doesn’t swell any more than it already has.” Remus urged gently.
“I’m so sorry.” My father whispered. “I’m sorry I’ve been putting so much pressure on you. I don’t want you to change, Draco; I love you just the way you are. You’re my only son, and if you’re going to fall in love with a man someday, then that’s how it’s going to be.” I swiped at a tear that escaped me, breathing deeply to control my tears. “If you wanted to settle down working at a fast-food place, then I would still support you, though with long frowns and not-so-subtle begs for a career change.” I chuckled wetly, leaning into my father. Support felt nice. I had missed my father. “It’s alright if you talk about boys you fancy around me. I want to know how you’re feeling, because if repressing your emotions makes you miserable like you have been, then I don’t want you to do it anymore. Okay?” I nodded jerkily, still biting my trembling lip. “Do you need a moment?” He asked. I nodded again, pressing my hands to my eyes. I was fine until he started rubbing my back, and that small amount of affection broke the dam that had been holding back my insecurities. I started sobbing.
“Sit on the bed.” he ordered, his voice quiet but strong. I sat. His shirt came off slowly, and my eyes followed its trail. He had freckles dotting his belly, and there was a line of hairs peeking out from under his jeans, fading as it reached his belly button. He was thin, but filled out so his ribs no longer poked out so dramatically.
“Did I actually say that? Shit.”
“What’s
“Don’t be silly. It’ll be my treat.” I insisted. Harry bit his lip through his grin, nodding slightly.
“Working in the government.” I gave him the short answer. Harry nodded.
“I…” I paused, chewing my lip hesitantly. This was my mother, though. I could tell her anything. “I feel lonely.” I whispered. My mother’s hand paused in my hair, but continued to my shoulder, where she rubbed soothingly.
I followed Remus up the staircase, allowing myself a smile. At the top of the stairs was a small landing with a door that opened into a homey living room area, with a small couch sitting on one side, and a simple TV stand on the other. Between the two was an ornate rug, and a round coffee table littered with papers and what looked like small animal toys. On the other side of the couch was a small kitchen, cramped, with a dining table and a handful of chairs. There was a lean, if a bit scruffy man standing in the kitchen with a colourful bird perched on top of unruly black curls. He reminded me of Harry, but his eyes were elegantly slanted, and his face peppered with 5 o'clock shadow.
“That’s wonderful, Draco.” My mother chirped, lasering my father with another glare.
“Sounds good.”
I noticed, however, that he was holding back. He would begin to ask me over before stopping himself so I could spend time with my godfathers, or deflate minutely when Neville and Luna joined us on a date. He would lean in only to pull away, or reach for my hand and turn the motion into a stretch. He gave me time and space, too much of it, and though I appreciated it, I noticed that he wanted more.
Funny. I needed the opposite.
“Oh? Okay, then.” I watched him work for a moment, waving his gloves over the scones.
“I made your shirt wet.” Harry mumbled, plucking at the fabric where he was crying.
Heh, heh... So hey. I'm alive. I'm also not going to bore you with excuses :) This one feels short, so sorry for that, but hopefully it satisfies.
Love you all, even if you've moved on from this story!!
“Siri-”
“Draco, I really don’t think that Harry is straight. I love my godson, and I keep his secrets, but it’s really not a secret.” He sighed, leaning forward on one hand. “He tries to be straight because he wants to have one thing that makes him normal, but I can almost guarantee that he’s as straight as you are.” So, maybe I
glasses of wine.” He mimicked Remus’ specific brand of emphasis perfectly. “Did you want red or white?”
I left the store quickly, biting the inside of my cheek to quell my disappointment. Why did I think it would be so easy?
“Turn the light off.” he directed. I did. He was lit up from behind, the light picking up the subtle red in his hair. His face was slightly shadowed, but I could see when his lips parted with a strengthening sigh. He reached for his shirt, and though my stomach buzzed with expectant arousal, I stepped forward to stop him.
“I dunno.” I shrugged again. “I just do. It’s my special ability.” I made ninja hands like a dork and made Harry laugh again, clutching his stomach. He had laughed a lot tonight, which I was glad for not only because I liked his laugh, but because he looked sad that morning and I didn’t like it.
“I’m sorry; I’m not laughing at you.” He assured me. “I don’t have a problem with it. You looked so worried though, I had to diffuse the tension.”
“Thank you.” I breathed. Luna rubbed my back, kissing my cheek when she pulled away. We watched the cooking show for a few minutes before my intercom buzzed by the front door of my flat.
“Are we skating today?” he asked hopefully, eyes darting to Remus and Sirius for permission.
“Well, I like blokes a bit more than others were comfortable with.” I stared hard at my feet, silently begging Harry to be okay with it. Maybe it wasn’t the right time to tell him-
him like nothing else in the world, and though it sounded really cheesy and adolescent, it was true. We had gotten really close, but I just wanted more. I wanted to hold his hand, or lean over and kiss him when he was being particularly cute. I wanted him to smile and stop pressing on his stomach and stop frowning at the mention of family. I wanted him to
“Good morning,” The man greeted, rushing forward to shake my hand as Remus and I entered the living room. “You must be Draco. Harry has told us so much about you.”
I quickly marked my place and put my book away, standing eagerly.
I cried for the nights I spent as a child waiting for Father to come home and read me my story. I cried for sleepless nights, bouts of panic and anxiety I had throughout secondary school over grades I didn’t think were good enough. I cried for the years I spent through puberty hating myself every time I watched a boy walk by me, for feelings I stifled, repressed and abhorred. I
“Is there something wrong with that? My back aches like an old man’s from bending down to your short level.” Harry giggled
“W- Uh, well, maybe you can meet them when we get our- um, have a chance to get out skating. Go out, I mean. Skating, I mean.” Yikes.
“You mean so you can sit and chat?” I wrinkled my nose.
“I don’t want to ruin things for you, Draco. You’ve just started here and you don’t need me ruining secondary school for you. I like hanging out with you, and I like being friends with you, but-” I felt my eyebrows pull together.
“Oh! Hi, Draco! I’m just about to put some scones in the oven.” He walked around his counter, washing his hands. “They’re a new recipe; butterscotch and white chocolate. Would you like one?” He grinned crookedly, beautifully, and I felt my heart and mask melt away.
I thought I was comfortable with grief. I thought that I knew it well. And so after my mother’s funeral, I expected myself to crumble. I braced for it, welcomed it, even, but it never seemed to come.
“It’s easy to feel like you missed out,” he told me, “when you haven’t been allowed to do so much. But there’s time, Harry. There’s always time.” I nodded along, staring down at my socked feet. “No matter what you do or say, we will love you. That will never change.”
"No, just looking." I pursed my lips and looked straight ahead to hide my ridiculous grin. Harry eyed me suspiciously, but let it go. We walked in silence, our hands brushing every now and then.
“The next time I hear about this, I’m going straight to your uncle’s house-”
“I don’t know, Draco…”
“That’s no good…” Oh, he looked sad. I felt bad, and bit my lip slightly.
Touching his arm with her other hand.
I brought my new find to the counter, a book about dragon slayers, and Remus grinned up at me as I approached.
“I won’t be home until later tonight.” I told her in a rush, my voice cracking a bit. “Draco, the boy I told you about, he’s taking me to see a film tonight.” I was doing well, looking at her face... “Sirius said it would be good for me to go, so...” I trailed off, ashamed of my horrible excuse, now unable to look at her, the guilt already creeping in. “I mean I didn’t
“No, Draco. You’re going to tell me about this boy. I don’t know anything about him except for that you fancy him!”
“My friends from my old school are coming to visit. They wanted to meet you guys.” Harry stiffened where he stood, but smiled at me, making it seem like he wasn’t affected.
“Yes.” He said surely, wiggling his fingers above him. He stared up at the sky, his arms falling to his sides. “Let’s go. Just you and me.” A little shudder went through him, his voice going quiet. “It’s so far away...” I started walking again, touching his elbow gently.
“I’ve known him barely a month. I still don’t even know for sure if he likes boys.” I glanced at my father, blushing at the expression on his face. I finished making my tea, forgetting about letting it steep, and went to leave the room. “I think I’ll go to my room for the night.”
"She... she's good, thanks Luna." I managed to puff out. Luna smiled.
“I’m Luna Lovegood. You must be Draco Malfoy. Harry told me about you.” No hand was extended towards me; just her gray eyes looking into my own. I bit the inside of my cheek and buried my face in my book.
“Mm-hmm.” Harry nodded, bending down to start kissing along my neck.
“Fuck, Draco.” Harry groaned, and then we were kissing with so much pent-up want that we soon became a pile of tangled limbs and wet lips. My shirt barely made it over my head, and Harry missed his bedside table when he went to put his glasses down. We laughed as we kissed, then sighed, then moaned. I discovered more freckles across Harry’s shoulders, and set to kissing them while trying to pull his jeans off.
I walked in, my objective being to retain my pride, get the book and completely ignore Harry and his motherfucking, heart-crushing, rage-inducing, hair-tuggingly frustrating heterosexuality. As soon as the bell at the top of the door rang, Harry looked up at me from where he was standing just outside the coffee booth, tying his apron.
“I know how it feels.” I murmured. Remus stared at me for a long moment, then looked down at the clock on his desk.
“I thought it might be. Come on up, we’ll unlock the flat. The door sticks a bit, so don’t be afraid to really shove at it.” There was a quiet laugh.
“It’s one of my hidden talents. I have an appreciation for hot drinks, and pride myself in knowing what kind of people like what in their teas and coffee.” He flashed a smile before bending down to pull out a box of teabags. Fuck, his fucking ass. Bloody fucking hell. I watched him carefully pick out a bag, and placing it in a paper cup, then putting a kettle on to heat back up. He put the perfect amount of sugar in and turned to face me again, a wet cloth in his hand that he used to wipe down his workspace. “You’ve got an accent.” He remarked. “Where are you from, London?” I smiled and nodded, leaning carefully against his counter.
Harry flushed bright red, but wouldn’t meet my eyes, his thumb rubbing mine slowly. I accepted his shyness, not commenting while we made our way down the street, not even feeling the eyes that followed us.
Holding his hand.
It had to get worse before it get better.
“Like a man.” He answered. I wasn’t sure if that was good or bad.
Possible triggers: Description of depressive state, mentions of self harm, vague mention of traumatic experience involving sexual harassment. This one's a bit heavy.
“I met a boy.” I replied softly. Mother gasped.
“Yeah, we do…”
.” He turned to look at me, flushed with anger. “I’ve had enough of this, no matter how good Lily thought it would be for you.
“Thanks...” I mumbled. “But the other students didn’t seem to think so.” I shrugged again, then grimaced at my awkwardness. “People at our school don’t see how great you, Neville and Luna are either.” Harry bit his lip.
I brushed snow off my shoulder and stomped my feet before entering the shop, tugging my coat off and making my way to the coffee counter. I didn’t have the energy to greet Remus, whose worried look I could feel at the back of my head. I felt dizzy and shaky, bracing myself against the counter after I straightened up from getting my apron.
next week!” He reached up, laughing gaily, fingers outstretched like he could grab onto the white circle above us.
"Madame says to keep your eyes open for ice." I looked ahead at the well- salted sidewalk in front of me.
“Well… I consider you my friend.” He put down the knife he had been using and played with his hands, rubbing them on his apron. He peeked up at me, his mouth turning down in a little frown. I grinned.
“Mm,” I groaned slightly before I could stop myself. “No, I think you should just give them to me.” I said jokingly. Harry froze before his face melted into a grin, scoffing at me.
“I agree with Remus.” Sirius cut in. “Your eye-”
“And we should really be dealing with the great whale that put it there in the-” Sirius spat angrily, stepping closer to Harry, who shrunk.
he has a girlfriend! That’s just my fucking luck. Good job, Draco. Brilliant! Pick the doubly unattainable man! Just fucking go for it! You stupid idiot! I shook myself lightly, frowning at the unwarranted hurt that settled in my gut. He wasn’t really even flirting with me, I guess, just being friendly to the new boy. How deluded am I?
He sounded nervous.
Good lord, if that man laid a single hand on Harry, I swear to god...
... You don’t need to do that- To hurt yourself like that... We love you so much. Harry,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Huh? Yeah, right.” I agreed, blushing at my space-out.
“Alright then, read me.” I challenged. Luna smiled and looked deeply at me, especially at my eyes and my face.
“I don’t know how.” He admitted softly. I stopped in front of him, smiling down at his green eyes. The sleeves of his uniform covered his hands, and he pulled them tighter, putting his hands in his coat pockets.
“You shouldn’t apologise. I’m so lucky you’re here, Draco. Never apologise for being you. You’re perfect.” I smiled sadly, gently wiping the tear tracks off his face.
“I’m not going anywhere, Harry.” I promised. I squeezed him, rubbing his back. “I’m staying right here.” He finally relaxed, letting me support him, his hands tangled in my shirt and face pressed to my neck.
“I love you,” I answered, his lips meeting mine just as the last word left my mouth. We kissed lightly, with no intention to go further, until Harry pulled away abruptly.
"Thanks. I'll keep that in mind." I replied genuinely.
“You’re just,” I panted between kisses, “everything,” I bit back a groan when Harry unbuttoned my trousers, reaching a hand in to grip my cock through my pants, “everything I could ever want.” I moved on from his shoulders, kissing down his chest.
“Why does it matter so much?” I asked, not really sure I wanted to know the answer.
“You didn’t let me finish.” I humored her, gesturing towards her with my hand. “You’re close with your parents, but you didn’t necessarily have a happy childhood.” I breathed in sharply. “You’re lonely.” She whispered. “You have been for years. Even with a large group of close friends. You’ve smiled a lot, but not for real. You’ve laughed a lot, but you never truly felt it. You’ve felt a lot of grief, sorrow and self doubt, and it sits deep in your core.” I was hardly breathing when she went quiet again, looking sadly at me. “Though you know you’re intelligent and courteous, you constantly feel as though you’re not good enough.” We were quiet for a moment, and then I huffed quietly.
“It’s after a constellation. It’s kind of a tradition in my family.” A brief, fascinated look crossed Harry’s face, his head tilting to the side adorably.
“I’m only teasing, it looks lovely.” I said softly, digging through the tote on my shoulder as we walked up to the loft. “I brought a new card game, and some weird looking cheese I think Sirius will like.” I told Harry, excited to try a game that wasn’t Monopoly with his godfathers.
“But-”
“Burned myself at work. It’s nothing.” I lied, leaning over to kiss my mum’s forehead. I grabbed my bag off the floor and left the bedroom, rubbing my eyes to remove tears. Remus would interrogate me if he saw I was crying when I got to work. I walked straight to work, my head low. I was feeling utterly miserable lately, especially at Vernon’s house. I hadn’t meant to start cutting again, it just sort of happened. I hadn’t meant to start cutting in the first place, but...
"Hello, Harry." A dreamy voice floated out of the shop I was standing near. I looked up to meet the eyes of my friend Luna, who was bringing the flowers from outside back into the store. Why they were outside in the first place was beyond me- they were covered in frost already. She worked in the curio shop, owned by the local fortune teller Madame Trelawney. I panted and raised a hand in a wave. "You're late again, huh? How's your mother?"
“I’m sorry.”
“No, father. May I be excused?” I asked, avoiding the question. My father nodded his head and I cleared my plate, scraping the remains into the trash before retiring to my room. It wasn’t long before my mother followed me, sitting beside me where I laid on my bed.
"That's fine, really. Just let me know ahead of time in the future." The boy- Harry- nodded graciously and took off his jacket, the snow melting where it had fallen on his shoulders. He set up behind the coffee counter, washing his hands thoroughly. I bit my lip as Harry pinned his hair out of his bangs, revealing his large green eyes, black glasses and more of his pale skin. He rolled his sleeves up past his forearms and started cleaning mugs, blowing air out of his mouth and making his bottom lip pout a bit.
Something else happened in the midst of my new start. All of my writing I had been doing was erased when my abuser cut off my cell phone and I had to get a new one. It seems like such a small thing among the bigger things that happened, but it truly crushed me. Countless words and hours put into unpublished and half-written fics alike, gone in an instant. I had backups of only a handful of documents because I hadn't access to much technology before. I honestly have barely attempted any writing since it happened.
, so cute I thought I was going to pass out. He swayed from foot to foot, looking around.
When the floodgates shut, I caught my breath, the familiar smell of my father’s cologne calming me further. My breathing jumped in the aftermath of emotion, but I ignored it to reach for a tissue, wiping my face.
“You have a deep and everlasting love for books.” Luna tried, looking at the book on the table. I quickly flipped it so she couldn’t see the title, just in case.
“Yeah, that sounds good.” He mumbled shyly, grinning sheepishly. I nearly smiled back, before a flash of white brought my attention to his left forearm. He had bandage and gauze wrapped from his wrist to mid-forearm, with a fleck of red near the top interrupting the otherwise sterile white.
Coming to a close.
“Uh...” I could feel my face turning red. “Sorry. That just kind of slipped out.” Neville rolled his eyes.
“I’ve looked for you.” I said quietly, not wanting Remus to overhear us. Harry paused, looking over at me. A bit of his hair fell from where he pinned it back and I wanted to tuck it back. I slipped my hands beneath my thighs. “I… Are we friends?” He looked surprised.
...” Remus started to cry with me, squeezing me tightly to his chest.
“You’re handsome, smart and very charming, Draco. Trust me when I say you will find someone when the time is right.” She squeezed my shoulder and stood up, pausing at my door again. “There are some leftovers in the fridge for you if you get hungry later on. Don’t stay up too late, okay?” I nodded, playing with my sheets absently. My mother sighed and closed the door behind her.
I was a fucking goner.
“The moon?” I chuckled, humoring him.
I closed my eyes and breathed deeply through my nose, trying desperately to ignore the annoying prattling from the utter
“I see…” He considered the book, before setting it aside. “May I suggest a novel? A bit of a change from medieval mystical creatures?” I nodded, always eager for new books.
"Thank you." I replied, unbuttoning my coat as the warmth of the shop sunk into my chilled skin. I found myself drawn to the fiction section, running my fingers over the spines of the books. I had passed this store so many times in the past two months that I couldn't resist its pull anymore. I had always loved books, even before I could read. Books kept me company where my nonexistent siblings couldn't. Books stayed up late with me under the covers, spinning tales of bravery and adventure; everything a sheltered rich boy like myself dreamed of when they were growing up. And though I had become a teenager in an adult's body in every other aspect of life, there was still that part of me that absolutely adored books.
“You also had a stuffed tiger growing up. His name was Sam.” That one took me off guard.
I have selective social graces.
“I wanted to be a police officer.” His eyes went soft, and he grinned a bit. “That’s what my father did. He was going to be Chief Inspector.” Harry swallowed, his face falling again.
“I feel like some of the party may be missing out on some background details…” Draco flushed, seeming to remember there were three of us new to the group.
“Hey,” Harry’s voice interrupted my thoughts, making me jump. “Oh, sorry. My break started, and we should go now if you still wanted to go out...” He shuffled and bit his lip, and
“Mm, okay, that’s not bad.” He said to himself, turning to frost the other ones. I watched his tongue slip out to lick at the side of his mouth, and I bit down on my lip to stop from moaning. God, he was so
but whatever it was about me that caught Hermione’s attention- Oh, bloody fuck. Maybe she was trying to set me up with the Weasley girl. I groaned, hitting my head against the nearest bookshelf.
too weird.
I might actually have a chance! I hadn’t dated anyone since Theo and I tried and failed at a relationship. Sure, there had been attraction between us, but we didn’t connect emotionally any further than friends. I found the author I was looking for originally and picked a book, feeling hopeful and happy. I heard the bell to the shop ring in the distance and made my way over to the counter, placing the book down gently.
“That’s fine!” I assured him, maybe a bit too loudly. “Um, Draco. It’s nice to meet you too.” Harry smiled even more, his eyes crinkling.
“Mother!” I gasped. “You scared me!”
“So, Easter Hols are coming up.” I mentioned to Harry, who was pulling some scones out of the oven. He grinned and glanced at me, blowing a lock of his hair out of his face from where it fell from his clip. I shifted in the stool I was sitting in, my stomach fluttering.
“Yeah, well... You're not the psychic.” I deflected. How the hell did he get in my head so easily?
“No, I’m okay. I was wondering when Harry will be here, or, I guess since you’re closed, if he will be here?”
“Oh, yeah. Sorry.”
“What?” He grunted. He had staring acting all cocky lately, after he started attending a private school. I rolled my eyes at my pudgy cousin and left the kitchen, wrapping the sleeves of my uniform sweater around my hands. I pulled my coat on, snuggling into it for a moment before leaving the house, the icy air awakening me.
“Hullo,” He said softly in greeting. “I thought you weren’t here for a moment.” I grinned at him, loving the light flush on his cheekbones.
“No harm in asking.” I encouraged, happily taking her hand as we exited the washroom and went back to the table.
“Uh, yeah...” He chuckled quietly, and I looked up at him quickly.
“I’m good.” He slung the towel up on his shoulder, the movement wafting his scent towards me and for a moment all I could smell was soap and cinnamon. “My coworker and I thought you looked a bit distressed. The girl you were talking to- Hermione- She can be a bit much.” He grinned crookedly, and automatically became forty percent more attractive.
“Have a good night, kids.” He nodded at me and my friends, stepping into the hallway. My mother waved at Luna and Neville, who waved back.
“Yes, definitely.” Harry pushed me back by my hips, kissing me swiftly before dragging me off towards his room. I closed the door behind us, and turned to find Harry switching the lamp on in the corner of his room.
“Sorry, I’m just really happy. I don’t want to lose the friends I just made...” I let go of Harry and stepped back to look at him. “Especially you.” I grinned at him, and he blushed, looking away and rubbing his head.
“Is he handsome?” I blushed a bit, but nodded. “Oh, my love. He’s just a boy. You’ll find someone, Draco. Don’t worry.”
“Yeah… That’d be great.” Harry smiled and turned around, heading back to his coffee station.
“Alright then. Follow me.” I ignored the outrage at the table I left behind, focusing instead on the thin legs in front of me, holding a shy body with curved shoulders and a messy mop of midnight hair that I wished to bury my face in.
“Thank you.” She exited my room, throwing me a strange look, and then closed the door behind her. As soon as her footsteps faded, I threw off my blankets and looked down at my lap dejectedly. “What are you doing?” I chided myself. “That’s completely inappropriate!” My length strained back at me, rebelling against my conscience. I know it was a natural part of being a teenager, but that didn’t make it any less embarrassing! Harry would be horrified if he knew I went around getting stiff from thinking about him! I groaned in humiliation, swinging my legs out of bed and standing up. I had no time to wank this morning, I was already behind. With one last glare at my crotch, I picked up my bundle of clothes for the day and headed towards the bathroom.
“Draco...” A light knock started at my door, my father’s voice smooth and controlled again. “I know this is awkward. It’s just as weird for me as it is for you.”
“Are you telling me that they’re making you pay for food?” He growled. I shook, my nervousness overpowering my control of my trembles.
“Not really...” He murmured. “I haven’t really told anyone about it. It’ll figure itself out soon anyways.” He sighed. “Those things are usually out of my control.” He kicked at the ground, shivering in the wind. “Most of my life has been out of my control; at least, it has been lately. I don’t really know what to do with myself. Sometimes I get desperate...” He clutched at his sleeves again, bringing my attention to his slender hands. He looked up at me with his green eyes, his hands trembling as he shoved them in his pockets.
. That night, curled up on the floor beside my bed, a pair of scissors in my hand, I made ragged lines of
“Oh, details.” She claimed, waving her hand. “Did you tell him how you feel?” I scoffed, letting my tea alone for a moment to let it steep.
“There’s a sandwich shop down the street- bye, Remus.” Harry interrupted himself to wave at his godfather, who smiled at us and nodded, returning to his paperwork. “I heard they’re good.”
“We’ll go to the moon then.” I agreed. “And have tea with the stars.” Harry looked at me, a little frown on his lips, before trying a sad little smile.
“Yeah, well, it doesn’t really matter does it?” I nearly snapped. “He’s dating that girl Luna.” I was introduced one day by Harry, who smiled at her as much as he did at me, only he hugged her and ruffled her hair affectionately, something he has yet to do with me. Yes, I was jealous, okay? But she was actually a lovely girl. He laughed when we told him how we met at school. As I chatted more with her, I found myself liking her more. I just wish she hadn’t stolen Harry.
“Uh,” I was distracted by his eyes, so green and wide and beautiful against his pale skin and dark hair. “Uh, I don’t think I have a type yet. I’ve only been out since last year. I dated one boy at my old school, but we were better off as friends.” I shrugged, grinning at the memory of my boisterous friend.
Like I said, I didn’t mean to start cutting. I dropped a plate one day and it slashed my foot open, the pain shocking me. For a moment, I felt... Well, I
“I could be,” he argued, “with practice. Now go put some ice on your eye. You're starting to swell a bit again.” I sighed and turned away, ignoring the pang of want in my chest. “Harry,” he called after me. I turned back around to find him peeking out of his door. “Next time, it's just us, yeah? Ice skating, finally?”
“Sounds good.” He murmured, hooking his arm into mine. We continued down the street like that, quietly now, Harry shuffling his feet and looking down. “I want to get out.” He said softly. “But I’m not ready yet.” He sighed. “I have things I need to do.” I wasn’t sure what he meant, but I knew he wasn’t talking about our fake journey to the moon.
“I just wanted to bring you these spare skates I had,” I explained, picking up on Remus’ train of thought, “we can go anytime you're… feeling better.” I held the box out to Harry, biting my lip when his face fell.
“Thanks.” We smiled at each other before he held out his hand, laughing embarrassedly.
“Well, we had better do something about that.” I found myself saying breathlessly, unable to continue with banter. Harry watched with hooded eyes as I got up from the table, crossing to Harry’s side to lean over him, tilting his face upwards for a kiss. Of course I knew he wanted me too, but hearing it from him sparked my confidence. Harry hummed as our lips touched, his hands coming to grip at my shirtsleeves, mouth parting easily after a questioning nip. I tried to lean closer, Harry letting out a yelp as his chair tilted backwards, joining me on his feet with a startled laugh. I pressed him to the counter, kissing down his neck, my face warm and head slightly fuzzy from wine.
“Thank you for not making a big deal,” I murmured; I put my hands in my pockets, feeling them start to get clammy, “about everything. I know it’s not… normal.” Something in Draco seemed to soften.
Trigger warnings: Mentions of trauma and self harm (Nothing graphic)
“I bet you’re relieved for that, right? But I’m sure you miss your friends.”
Even on my bad days, when my therapy appointments ran into our date night, and we spent the time pulling the pieces of my heart back together instead of snogging in the back of the cinema. Or when I found myself lashing out at him, an ugly jealousy rearing its head when he cancelled on our plans to help his parents out. He surprised me time and time again, giving me the time and space I needed to gather myself to apologise. He surprised me by always forgiving me, with gentle smiles and accepting my gifts, instead of anger and ultimatums. He surprised me by loving me so fiercely, and gently, and fully. He surprised me by allowing me to love him back.
“There’s dessert, too, if you want some in a bit.” Harry offered. “It’s fruit crumble and custard.” he drank the white wine with less grimacing.
“Draco...”
“Who are your friends? I haven’t met them before.” She squeezed my shoulders slightly.
Meeting new people was intimidating.
“You transferred this year, right? How do you like it here? I just moved here for high school myself.”
“But maybe it’s time to let her go.” A large lump lodged its way into my throat, my eyes stinging. “You’ve been so strong, pup. But I really think it’s time.” I shook my head against his chest, widening my eyes so my tears wouldn’t get on my glasses. “I know it’s hard.” Siri’s voice went rough. “Trust me, I know it is.” He pulled back and held my face, wiping my tears and ruffling my hair. I let him, whereas I would usually pull away and remind him that I’m not six anymore.
Draco stumbles to make a good impression, and meets his potential competition? Also a little peek at the Malfoy family dynamics.
he’s straight.
“Siri? That’s Remus’ partner, right?” Harry snorted.
“I trust you.” He said softly. “Any friends of yours must be great people.” I snorted.
I can't believe Lunar Cafe is finally finished! Thank you so much to everyone who stuck by my inconsistent uploads and continually inspired me to start writing again. This story has been there as my outlet years ago and healed me to write and finish. Thank you so much guys- I hope you find happiness wherever you are, because you deserve it.
of you!” I stroked Marshy’s head while Sirius made me a sandwich, feeling guilty. “I know this isn’t your fault or responsibility, but you really should stick up for yourself, Harry.”
“Oh?” I laughed, my hands resting on his thighs. “Is that so?”
We reached Luna’s house and dropped her off, making our way to Neville’s house. They lived in the older part of Leicester, where the houses looked warm and lived in. After Neville went inside, it was just Harry and I, Harry skipping in front of me and kicking the snow, smiling brightly.
“I’m sorry, Draco, but I was so excited to see you! How did your date go?” I blushed, walking past my mother and into our kitchen, where my father was looking at paperwork. He lowered his glasses when I walked into the room, looking up at me. I ignored his stare in favour of making a cup of tea.
“Oh, really? Are you worried about your father, dear? He loves you very much and you know he has no issue with your sexuality.”
I tried. I really, really tried. When I returned to school a year after the accident, I was a shadow of my former self. My dad’s funeral had been one of the most painful experiences of my life. My shoulder ached with phantom pains for days afterward with the feeling of Siri’s hand clamped on my shoulder. I went through rehab and physiotherapy so I could walk and write again, all paid for by the drunkard who decided he was fine to drive home from the pub before his wife got back from work. The kids at school couldn’t look at me, forget talk to me, and I wore thick jumpers to keep the chill of loss out of my bones, to hide the scars from my surgery. My mum was allowed home after being kept at the hospital for a while, hooked to machines that kept her alive but not living, and me sleepless night after night. I was moved to Vernon and Petunia’s place once we found out mum and dad’s wills clashed; Mum’s asking for me to live with her sister, and dad’s asking for me to live with Remus and Sirius. It was decided that I follow my mum’s wishes, and when she passed, then I would live with Remus and Siri.
“You have a shield you put up to defend yourself. Like… Like a mask.” She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the tabletop. “It’s really rather strong, but I’m learning how to read people from an expert. Most people can’t get past me.” I smirked amusedly.
before he slid out of the booth we were sitting in, standing up and stretching.
“How do I look?” I asked Sirius. He looked at me for a long while, a sad sort of smile meeting his lips.
.” I repeated firmly. “Most of the boys at school are idiots.” Harry laughed and nodded.
“Do I look like the kind of person who would care about that shit?” Harry blushed darkly and shook his head jerkily. “Good, because I don’t. I don’t care about the Weasley’s or Granger, or being popular, okay? I stopped caring about that fuckery a while ago.” Harry nodded, and I nodded to myself. “I want to be your friend
I smiled to myself, rubbing my tired eyes.
person I’m sure you are.
“Oh,” He said softly. “Well, I hope you have a good time. You must miss them.” He looked down, playing with his hands. “Er, anyways... Tell them I said hello, okay?” I nodded and Harry smiled. “Okay.” He scratched at his head, his loose sleeve drooping and a flash of white catching my eye before he started speaking again. “See you on Monday then.” He turned to leave, and I grabbed his arm, tugging him into a quick embrace that wasn’t quite a hug, patting his back.
“So... Drinks? Snacks? The others are going to meet us in town, so we have a while to relax.” I herded the two into my living room area, Luna making herself comfortable on the couch. “I have some crisps in the cupboard if you fancy them.” I moved a pillow off the couch so Neville could sit nearer to Luna.
“Really? That’s wicked!” I blushed again, shuffling awkwardly.
There's a heartfelt conversation, and a bit of a steamy moment between the boys.
“Do you remember when I slipped on ice one year and threw my back out?” He asked me suddenly. I nervously glanced at my father, shook my head. “You were six years old, in second year of primary school. Since I had to take time off to heal, I could spend more time with you than before. I used to read a book to you every night to get you to fall asleep. Do you remember?” I thought back, through fuzzy memories of sing-along-songs and wobbly-drawn pictures hung on the fridge.
I chastised myself internally, straightening up. I looked him over, reading his nametag which (thankfully) read Harry, with a coffee shaped sticker beside his name. Harry smiled up at me, shrugging. He had a towel in his hands, and was drying them slowly while he considered me.
"Now go down and introduce your mouth."
“We are not done, Mr. Malfoy, there are still a couple of checks. Could you lie down again? "
The platform he was standing on began to turn slowly, and he saw several people approaching him to observe him with interest, chatting amiably among themselves and sipping champagne from the crystal glasses they had collected at the refreshment tables.
His embarrassment reached a never-before-seen peak when the first group of people peered at his ass with interest, and his face turned even redder as he realized he knew some of them: ministry dignitaries they had frequented. her home, men her father had done business with and ...
He was more and more on fire, more and more needy and eager, but the man did nothing but ignore him.
His father obviously didn't want to show off. Draco should have known.
Draco moaned again. He was terrified of his body's reactions. He didn't even know if they were normal, but the pleasure was disgusting him because he didn't want to try it, he just wanted to be left alone, instead the finger inside him touched him insistently, while his hand masturbated him faster and faster.
Healer Smith intervened:
Draco was not even sure where his room was from, but since his mind was, in a certain way, more present, he felt his cheeks cook with embarrassment, and he panicked.
He moaned the whole time, wincing with pleasure, and when his hands reached his buttocks he felt his hole stream humors, and the plea instantly reached his lips:
Orgasm came quickly and left Draco quivering, and the man quickly dumped him on the bed.
The pierced ears were nothing compared to the rest, only a vague burning that seemed to be muffled by the other pains, stronger and more annoying.
When the next morning the bedroom door opened again, Draco first smelled the Alpha and, at that point, his mind was no longer even able to visualize its owner's ugliness, because his body he only wanted one thing, and that thing his Alpha had hung between his legs.
"Take him to his room." He ordered, and Draco stared at the elf with wide eyes. Could he get up? Should he crawl? He did not know, but he found it safer to stay on his knees, and started following the elf to his room.
“Understandable, but it should be better in a few hours. Now try to concentrate, because we still have a lot to do today. Come on, now, without needing me to order it, let me see that you understand what I said to you yesterday. Get on the bed and show me your ass, good. "
Embarrassing, of course, but obvious since it was a careful medical checkup, and probably the fabric could have interfered with certain types of spells.
"Good boy. I see that we begin to understand each other, bitch. "
When the morning lit up the room and his master entered, Draco did have the strength to get into position, but he did it anyway.
"Lucius must be a fool to believe that someone can take him on those terms!" one said.
The idea of a big cock, so close, made him moan more, and he was sure that, if he could, he would come at that moment, instead the man let him continue masturbating in vain.
The strange expressions on the faces of his parents, when they had greeted him on his way out for medical check-ups ... the strange change of subject when talking about marriage alliances in public ...
“Well, Feba still looks like a nice woman, but it took a lot of effort to make her like that, because her last owner used it a lot and in imaginative ways. But, as you can see, it is still salable, and I imagine it will still be fertile for a few years. Well, let's go visit the next one. Follow me."
“No, I guess you still don't understand it well, which is why I preferred to use magic before. One thing at a time. We have little time to make you presentable, but I will do my best, given the amount your father paid to make sure you were ready. You can move and go to the bathroom if you have to. "
"Hey! I know you!" she said smiling and standing up to offer his hand, heedless of Draco's nakedness "My sister has told me about you, sometimes, in her letters! You went to school, "he said wrinkling his nose in a similar way to what Pansy would have done" it must be fantastic to learn magic! "
"Look me in the face, bitch." The man said and Draco opened his eyes, disgusted by what he saw and by the huge hairy face, as well as by the fetid breath of the monster who had bent down to blow in his face:
Healer Smith had been right, and Draco also began to understand why it was right for everyone to consider him less than human.
Draco couldn't make out her expression in the dim light, but it didn't matter because he was sure it was horrible and distorted by lust.
It was no longer just desire: it seemed that molten metal had been poured into his guts, and his body was burning.
“Oh, that's the effect of the potion. Your reproductive organs are getting back to work after years of inactivity. It will be painful, in fact. " The healer said flatly, before ordering "go back over there now."
Draco had begun to look around frantically, and footprint every object, of suitable shape, in his mind had become something that, if he could, he would have slipped up his ass for relief.
"Do we have any information on clothing?"
When he was brought into the adjoining room by a lady who was obviously there to style his hair, Draco for the first time saw himself reflected in a mirror and let out a scream.
Not the searing pain of the Black Mark, when it was placed on his arm, and which was now covered by the high leather bracelet, not the agonizing torment of a Cruciatus, no, the real, incessant pain.
Draco pursed his lips, trying to do the opposite, but the insistence of the healer's finger, and his wise hand, eventually made him give up, and he let out a long moan as his orgasm poured on the sheets under him .
He heard footsteps and the presence of his nearest new owner, then lights came on flooding the room.
He allowed himself a sigh of relief, and after a while, the healer Smith approached him, ordering:
Draco had been under Imperius in the past, but he realized this was worse. At least the Imperius gave a kind of happy feeling to those who carried out the orders, instead he, while his feet brought him back, did not feel happy but only horribly forced. He grabbed the member, pointed him towards the toilet and pissed, letting escape even a slight sigh of relief, but in all this his sense of horror was only increased, and the pang in his stomach became stronger, much who, after freeing himself, doubled over in pain.
The healer glanced over every inch of his naked exposed body and, if he could, Draco would have shivered.
"Really tight." He heard Nott say, and then the finger was withdrawn and a moment later the man had passed in front of him and, after grabbing his hair, lifting his face to be looked at, he said with a sadistic grin:
“Um… I see we're getting better, bitch. But we're not there yet. Come on, get out of bed and follow me. "
"Please, please, fuck me, fill me, please, I burn, I need it so much."
It was an intrusion, a penetration, and in that moment being penetrated, everywhere, was his only, incessant, desire.
The healer Smith stopped before operating the spells and massaged his chest with a strange yellowish paste.
He was sent back to his rooms, still burning and dissatisfied, and that night the pain came.
He had been taken to a private medical facility for some routine checkups, or so he was told.
And of course they were as rich as they had always been, perhaps even more than before because after the funeral, and the trials, the Lestrange's fortune had passed to them.
"yeah, I think I will" Harry said with a fake yawn as he stretched his arms "night"
"None of your business" answered Malfoy with resolve as he closed his bag.
“I won’t bite, Potter” Malfoy suddenly said. Harry glanced at him. “I won’t behave like before, I know you love someone now, I’m not that much of an arse” he explained, and Harry nodded. If only Malfoy knew…
Snape looked at Dumbledore, and Dumbledore looked back, and then both of then looked at Malfoy. They seemed to be talking with each other, and Harry couldn't hear anything, or even see much – since he was so little.
He opened the door hesitantly after he took a glance at Potter standing not too far behind "come in" he muttered.
Harry walked over there, opened the window, and was greeted by Hedwig carrying a letter from Hermione. He petted his owl before it flew away.
"Malfoy? Why?"
Thank you for the lovely comments! <3
As he was about to open his door, he heard a low sound coming from inside.
"Mr Malfoy, since you were present when the accident took place, you will be the one taking care of Harry while he is in such a state. I will assign you Head Boy, in order for you to have your own bedroom. We don't want the other students knowing about this little predicament now, do we?" Malfoy shook his head, and didn't seem to argue as well. Something must be wrong here! There was no way on earth Malfoy would willingly agree to take Harry with him.
"Blaise, of course"
"I don't know how I'm going to take a shower" Harry answered seriously.
They began working together, assigning each task to either one of them, and Harry noticed how smoothly he had been working – he was very proud of himself.
Harry smiled. Something clutched at his heart again "hey" he barely managed to say.
"Yeah, I'm in here" Harry said as he slid the shower door a little and poked his head out. Malfoy looked at him for a bit "so you don't have to sit in the sink huh?" and gave Harry a faint smile.
"I trust Malfoy" said Harry and both of his friends looked at him in surprise.
Harry was taking in the portraits hung on the wall as an excited voice yelled.
"Yes, we still have to write the essay for the DADA class, we should go to the library before dinner" Hermione said, and got up from her place, put the book in her bag, and looked ready to leave. Ron stood as well, and both of them looked at Harry, who decided that he should go with them instead of staying here, wallowing in self-pity.
"oh Harry! I'm so sorry" Hermione said as she took his hand in hers.
Harry knew he had to do something now. He didn't know what would happen if he just let Malfoy do whatever he wanted. Malfoy was clearly not thinking straight.
Thursday, September 5th
By then, he had forgotten everything Snape and Dumbledore told him and went straight to them.
"Watch him today, will you?" he asked his friend.
"after my parents died, I lived with my aunt" Potter said, swallowing the last piece of bread "they didn't like me very much" Draco scoffed
There was nothing he could do but wonder what Ron would do when he wakes up and doesn't find him anywhere, or what Hermione would assume upon hearing the dreadful news. More importantly, what Dumbledore would say to explain his disappearance. He had no way of finding out except to wait for Malfoy to come back and inform him of what happened during breakfast. He must have fallen asleep because when Malfoy closed the door upon coming in, Harry jumped in surprise.
Malfoy relaxed in his seat, facing Harry as he spoke "I left class after half an hour, I couldn't focus anyway" Malfoy sighed as he looked away "I'll start over…have you had sex before?" He asked making Harry's entire body stiffen "I mean I'm sure you have…the Boy-Who-Lived and all" he continued, not noticing Harry's expression. But when the latter didn't answer him, he tilted his head "what?" he asked, and probably seeing Harry's red face, his brows creased "you…you haven't?"
“you should be”
"You must place yourself in contact with Lucius. You must go to the manor. Mr. Malfoy, I'm sure, will not reject the idea" Dumbledore gave Harry an innocent-looking smile that Harry knew to be mischievous.
"I…I had Voldemort to deal with" Harry mumbled, fixedly staring at the floor.
He had replayed last night's scene a million times in his head. What did Malfoy mean that the rest would come when he returned to his normal size? Harry gasped at the memory. There was clearly something the blonde was doing to him. He tossed and turned before deciding to get up. Surprisingly, it was easy to get off of the bed now. He looked down at himself and went to the bathroom. He levitated himself to the sink, and as he looked in the mirror, he noticed that he was now about the size of a small child. He grinned to his own reflection before heading back and sitting on the couch. He was thinking of what he could do now when an owl pecked at the window to his right.
"Ron…" Harry began, and waited until Ron swallowed his food and looked at him "I don't feel right" Harry said, lowering his voice and sliding closer to Ron.
"This is the only way" Dumbledore interrupted "The Death Eaters have gotten smarter and more cautious. They leave no trace. If we are to stop them, it can only be through Lucius. He is the loose thread" Harry sighed, looking down in resignation. It seemed to him that there will always be something that only he can take care of and only he can do.
It had irked Harry, somehow, when Malfoy passed by him without so much as a glance. He really didn't want their relationship – whatever it was – to just change to this silence.
"You're so dramatic" Malfoy drawled "we went to Hogsmeade and drank butterbeer at The Three Broomsticks" Harry turned to face him, feeling stupid for the way he acted "alright" he muttered. Instead of going back to where he was sitting, he slumped down on the bed.
When he came out, he ignored Harry completely and sat on his desk scribbling away. When Harry tried to talk to him, he pretended like he didn't hear him at all.
"I…" Potter kept glancing about the room, fidgeting with whatever he could grab at the table "I…well I…I think I'm full now" his voice seemed to go up an octave
"Nice sound, Potter" Malfoy smiled in an irritatingly smug way as he always does, and walked slowly down to the dungeons. On their way, Harry and Malfoy did not utter a single word. Malfoy seemed to be preoccupied with some other matter. And Harry…well Harry was thinking about what Malfoy was thinking. As soon as they reached the dungeons, Harry became aware of his present situation. Malfoy hid Harry in his pocket – which was too tight – and sauntered in as if he were taking a leisurely stroll. Having Harry choking in his pocket did not stop Malfoy from making occasional stops as he trekked to his bedroom, nor did it prevent him from having unhurried and relaxed conversations with Parkinson and Greengrass (or at least whom Harry thought it was based on his hearing of their voices).
Malfoy had teased Harry the entire day after his stupid declaration, and Harry tried his best to disregard the fluttering in his stomach every time Malfoy smiled at him or made a comment about him being cute.
Snape may have changed, yes, but Harry was nonetheless more surprised than ever before.
"enjoy your stay" he shot Harry a glance, and not waiting for an answer, left the room.
"What shall we tell the school?" Snape muttered as if he were talking to himself, and trying to find a solution to something unsolvable.
Draco inched closer and pressed his ear to the keyhole.
Harry scanned the Slytherin table, and was met with a fierce gaze. Unfortunately, it wasn't from Malfoy. Zabini was staring at him, and Harry met his gaze. Zabini finally smiled at Harry, and looked away.
When he woke up, Harry saw Malfoy sleeping next to him on the bed, and he noticed that Malfoy had covered him with the blanket. Harry climbed on the sleeping figure next to him and stared at his face. Malfoy looked so peaceful, and Harry couldn't look away.
Harry opened the bag, he knew he shouldn't, but his heart thumped in excitement.
A few minutes later, he felt the blonde slipping under the covers. Harry waited patiently. He muttered a tempus charm to check the time, 23:55. He had to go.
Ron and Harry looked at each other, and tried to make sense of what just happened. None of them, however, seemed to know what that was about. They shrugged it off, and made their way to their table.
Harry woke up with a start. He had dreamt of being stuck in his current size forever and was terrified. He looked to his right where Malfoy slept and noticed that the blonde was still in bed.
"Harry!" Ron eventually exclaimed as Hermione continued to stare at him with a befuddled expression "what happened?! Where have you been? Why are you so tiny?" Ron bombarded him with questions and Harry realized only then that he might have made a mistake.
Harry, on the other hand, had mixed feelings about this. First off, Malfoy was NOT gay. Last year he had went out with at least two girls, then the war started and that was that. Also, Malfoy had went to the Yule Ball with a girl, and if he were gay, he wouldn't have. But what seemed to bother Harry the most is that Malfoy, if he were to be gay, would NEVER go out with Nott of all people, and they certainly don't look cute together. So, Harry tried to block out what his two friends were saying, and think about anything that isn't Malfoy-related.
"Er…a few weeks or so" he trailed off.
"Where have you been all day?" Harry asked, simultaneously eating and rubbing his eye.
He continued to place lazy kisses on his neck until he suddenly stopped moving. Harry dazedly glanced down to see that the blonde had fallen asleep again.
"But why not? I don't get it. It's just for a few days and it's funny…well to other people that is" Harry frowned. It wasn't that funny to him. This was supposed to be his normal year.
"Well, for one thing, I can fit you right in my pocket, which would have made my life a whole lot easier before" he half chuckled, "I think being small looks good on you" he added, turning away as he gave Harry one of his typical smirks.
"why would I sleep there?" Malfoy said, his voice laced with irritation as he looked at Harry "are you drunk or something? Maybe you should go to sleep" Malfoy added then sighed before grabbing his book again "now stop bothering me" he opened it and continued reading.
"Did you hear?!" Ginny began to gossip as soon as she sat down. Hermione tried to look uninterested, but she was obviously the opposite.
Malfoy fell asleep quickly, but Harry lay awake, unable to nod off.
They hurried to the Great Hall, Ron sulking because he has apparition, and Harry teasing both of thembecause they still had classes to attend, while he had finished for the day. However, Hermione didn't seem to mind.
Yours,
Malfoy glanced at him "as soon as his highness gets up" he motioned for Harry to get off the bed. Harry scoffed but got up anyway. He walked to the window and stared at the green grounds outside.
"I'm going to ask you for advice" Malfoy said, and as Harry was about to speak, Malfoy raised his finger and shushed him "and don't get cocky…I just thought you might have something better to offer than my friends. Their advice has been useless lately, to be honest" Harry nodded and kept quiet.
He remembered how disarrayed everything was. Snape was nearly killed by Nagini, and was saved at the last moment, McGonagall tried to protect the school as much as she could, but Hogwarts was still almost beyond repair, and Dumbledore, well he managed to catch every Death Eater and hand them to the Dementors.
"Detention, Mr. Potter" Snape said, and returned to explaining his lesson.
"of course not!"
"isn't there a couch?" he finally managed to ask, shuffling his feet and looking everywhere except at Draco.
"I'm not saying not to trust Malfoy…" Hermione said "but just be careful" without waiting for Harry's reply, she went on "I think you should go back before he finds out…take this with you" she handed him a small box.
"Malfoy certainly has" she said seriously, and turned to look at the blonde. Harry tried to hide his reaction to hearing Malfoy's name, and tried harder to find out why he was getting all worked up about such a thing.
"I'm taller!" he announced half surprised, half excited.
Harry and Malfoy had stayed in Snape's office for a while, discussing Harry's predicament and the Death Eaters on the loose when Harry asked: "Professor, what did you say to my friends?"
Tuesday, September 3rd
Harry exhaled in relief.
"yeah, Nott sat next to me and when Blaise came in, he glared as he walked past the both of us" he explained "and as if that wasn't enough, he kept looking back from his desk and when Nott decided to move his chair closer, Blaise walked up to him and almost hit him…so I just left" Malfoy finished, and without realizing, Harry just blurted out "I don't know why you're fighting over him, he's not even that good looking" Harry pursed his lips as Malfoy eyed him for a moment before his usual smirk appeared "How about me, Potter? Am I good looking?"
"I'm not so gracious as to tell you that Potter," Malfoy said "but if your answer to my question is good enough…" he mused "I just might."
"you can't just tell me a name!" Harry complained, and seeing that Malfoy remained silent he continued "tell me what he's thanking you for."
"Potter?" Malfoy muttered and Harry was almost shrieking underneath the sheets because he was stuck. Malfoy removed the sheets hurriedly and took Harry in his hand.
"we were just catching up, dear" said his mother with a small smile as she got up from her spot "perhaps you could show Harry the gardens" and nudging him as she passed, left the room.
“I’ll drink it tomorrow morning –”
"Yes" Malfoy said, apparently not wanting to elaborate any more than that "I just need to pack my things" he continued, and Harry could only hear the shuffling of their feet, and the boy's sigh.
Draco opened the door ever so slightly and peered through.
Harry concentrated, and read the instructions three times before starting. He made sure to shake the Shrivelfig well, and when he added it, he still winced away, but nothing was emitting and Harry allowed himself to smile inwardly. For his last step, he allowed the potion to simmer, and when it turned green he was grinning like an idiot.
Harry looked with disappointment at the now locked drawer. He had a chance. He had a chance and he blew it.
Malfoy sighed as he closed both eyes and rubbed his temple "Nott likes me not Blaise. He came over before to tell me that and kissed me. I told him I'd talk to him later and that's where I was" Malfoy said, opening his eyes again and looking at Harry.
They ate in silence for some time before Narcissa cleared her throat “how are you finding the Manor Harry?” she asked and Lucius looked up from his plate suddenly “Harry?” he asked as he eyed his wife suspiciously.
Malfoy laid down, resting his head on the pillow.
"Well, can I have a chocolate then?" Harry smiled. Malfoy turned and looked at him "what?"
"father…I want to talk"
Draco smirked. It'd been fun messing around with Potter for the past few weeks. He'd noticed how attracted Potter was to him and how uncomfortable he'd become whenever Draco moved closer to him. A part of it was satisfying, Draco had to admit. The-Boy-Who-Lived was behaving like a teenage girl around him. Potter was alright, and while Draco didn't particularly like him, he couldn't deny that the brunette looked good. Draco would definitely shag him if he got the chance.
"oh, I'm sorry…I didn't hear you"
Harry shuddered before Malfoy moved closer and started kissing him.
Malfoy was startled "where did you come from?" he asked Harry as he moved away slightly.
He laid on the bed with his hands under his head, and, without noticing, soon fell asleep.
We are pleased to inform you that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry will reopen its gates to all seventh year students who wish to finish their N.E.W.T exams.
"Don't worry Mr Potter, all will be explained in good times" Snape spoke slowly
"Better?! How is this better?" Harry was indignant.
Transfiguration was a complete bore, since it was with the Ravenclaws, and Harry had no one to stare at. However, Ron promised to tell him all about Apparition later, and Harry couldn't wait.
"Now, we started dating a few weeks ago, which explains why I haven't told my parents" Malfoy drawled. Harry went scarlet and fidgeted with his shirt "I asked you out…you said yes…we went out on one date…what else?" Malfoy seemed as if he's practicing for a movie part and Harry didn't like that. It seemed that Malfoy wasn't as affected by the idea of dating him.
Malfoy must have seen Harry's face because he sauntered towards him, his smirk dangling on the corner of his lips "like what you see Potter?" he said with a sly wink.
"if I don't drown by then" Harry huffed as he put on the clothes Malfoy provided for him.
"Yes, Professor" Harry's voice was barely heard. He could not think of any reason why he couldn't tell his friends. It was true that Dumbledore had told them, in his speech at the beginning of the year about some Death Eaters that have not yet been caught, but that was no reason to keep him with Malfoy! His father was a Death Eater himself. And Malfoy was going to take care of him. He would have to live with Malfoy in the Slytherin dungeons! And sleep with Malfoy!
"come, Potter" he said and Narcissa nudged him "that's not a nice way to call your boyfriend" Malfoy raised an eyebrow, while Harry blushed behind him, feeling grateful that they couldn't see him.
"Today, we will be brewing the Shrinking Potion" Snape began "it is an easy enough assignment for some students not to mess up" he said, as he looked at Neville. Harry was just glad it wasn't him. Snape waved his wand, and white lines appeared on the board "each of you will begin brewing the potion with the student next to you; I expect to have it ready by the end of this lesson. You may begin" Snape said, looking sternly at all his students, and sat behind his desk.
"Granger, may I have a word?" she began, and looked like she was trying really hard to smile.
He looked around their dorm, and was relieved to find it hadn't changed. They were given the same one, with the same people, and Harry had definitely missed waking up with his friends. Somehow, though, he could already sense how different this year was, and he could honestly say he was looking forward to it.
Hermione had somehow regained some of her composure because she looked at him with much calmer eyes "what happened Harry?" she asked.
"I haven't heard from you in a while…been busy?" he asked cautiously.
"Give me that!" Malfoy said as he snatched the letter from the Gryffindor "this" he said, gesturing at the note in his other hand "is private" he sneered as he put it back in the envelope, grabbed Harry rather roughly, closed and locked the drawer, and threw Harry on the bed.
Term begins on September 2nd.
Finding himself gasping, Harry tried to regain his composure, but Malfoy was looking at him hungrily and Harry's heart skipped a beat.
"I heard Malfoy is dating one of the Greengrass girls, but yesterday Nott asked him out, and Padma told me they were going to come to dinner as a couple tonight! I really don't believe it! I mean Nott? Malfoy I might believe, though, he cares about his attire and his hair way too much to be straight" she giggled "but they would be cute together" she looked at Hermione who agreed with her immediately.
Malfoy must have warned his parents because Narcissa didn't seem shocked to see him as she led them to the drawing-room.
Harry thought about getting out of the shower to check up on the blonde when the latter opened the bathroom door.
He shrunk and had to stay with Malfoy…then fell in love with him…and now, he’s at his house, pretending to be his boyfriend. It all sounded like a weird, unending, nightmare.
"why not? He's good looking, famous, almost every girl, or guy, would want to go out with him" argued Hermione
"Mr Potter" Snape started "you've got yourself in a predicament here" and he looked at Harry with a suspiciously kind expression. Harry nodded, though not looking at Snape but at the parchments on the desk, thinking how bigger they were than him.
Malfoy walked calmly towards his mother and gave her a hug. He shifted awkwardly "Mother, you know Potter" he introduced and Narcissa smiled faintly "yes, of course" moving forward and shaking Harry's hand. Harry smiled back at her.
"Ahh, I see you have come" he said as his eyes twinkled. He looked like he already knew what the problem was. Harry noted that everything just looked so huge around him, especially the headmaster's beard which was triple his size. He was slightly distracted, however, by a smell he'd noticed, but couldn't quite place.
"You really do look funny, you know that?" Malfoy laughed "here, fold these" he said, throwing what seemed to be a mountain of shirts on the bed next to Harry, but, in reality, were only two.
"and here I was asking you for advice" Malfoy teased
Crabbe or Goyle – Harry couldn't differentiate between their voices – addressed Malfoy at last "I can't find it…I may have put it in your drawer" he sounded almost scared.
"Why can't I stay with my friends? Do you know something?" he asked, although not really as interested in this topic now that he had seen the box and the note on the dresser.
"What's up?" he asked as he sat next to the blonde, pretending not to know anything.
As he heard him, Harry's eyes widened and he could feel his face burning.
"You wait here, I'll bring something for you to eat" Malfoy said as he got out of the shower and dried his hair with a white towel. He was wearing black pants, a white button up shirt, and a green tie. He put his robes on and Harry just nodded. As soon as Malfoy went down, Harry tried to open the drawer. It had been on his mind all night, and he knew he wouldn't get many opportunities like this one. It was very difficult to reach, however, and when he eventually did, he remembered that it was locked. Only then did he notice that he didn't have his wand with him. Malfoy must have kept it when he grabbed it along with his robes. Harry climbed down the nightstand and sat back on the bed.
"well I don't" Malfoy's voice sounded closer and Harry turned around. The blonde was right behind him and Harry took a step back "you notice things about everyone, Potter?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow as he took a step forward.
"Look, I know it's early, I just couldn't sleep last night" Nott started "I lied about Blaise alright? Pansy told me you weren't into me and I wanted to find out for myself. I…" he stuttered "Draco…" he said in a barely audible voice and Harry had to strain to hear what he was saying "it's you…always been you…I…" and before he finished saying anything, Harry just heard silence.
Malfoy huffed as he rubbed his temple "no, I'm not going to curse you" and then raising his head added "yet"
"I can't really tell you that, Potter" Malfoy said matter-of-factly, still not turning to meet Harry's questioning gaze.
Harry was sitting on one of the chairs when Malfoy sauntered in. The latter nodded his head and sat across from him.
"Yeah" Malfoy didn't elaborate. Instead, he levitated the luggage, walked slowly to the bed, and opened his palm for Harry to climb onto.
"I can't fold them, you idiot! They are huge!" Harry would need at least three days to fold them, surely.
"Where did we go?"
He eyed him suspiciously. He knew Malfoy, talking about his family was crossing an invisible red line.
"he shows what he wants to show" Potter retorted and crossed his arms.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
"to you, maybe" Malfoy said "sleeping on me all night" he seemed insistent on making Harry's morning unbearable.
Malfoy was sitting on the couch, staring into nothing.
Harry chatted with his friends before they decided to go to bed. Tomorrow they would have to wake up early, and have their first lesson in Arithmancy, which was difficult enough, so they had to be focused.
Harry searched Malfoy's face for any clues, but was met with a raised eyebrow that answered nothing.
Tuesday, September 10th
He crossed the room, took the box of chocolate and the note, opened his first drawer, and put them in.
"Well, Potter, you always have to find a way to cause trouble, don't you?" Snape said, his voice betraying what he had hidden so far – there was no malice, and Snape sounded actually concerned which caused Harry to freak out. If Snape was concerned, then there's definitely something wrong.
"I think Dumbledore doesn't trust Malfoy's father, and it was just a lucky coincidence that he saw you shrink. I believe Dumbledore found this an opportunity for you to be close to Malfoy in order to keep an eye on him and, by extension, his father" Hemione explained.
"Why can't we tell the other students? I can stay in my dorm with Ron!" Harry argued a bit childishly. He definitely didn't want to stay with Malfoy, and didn't know why Malfoy didn't argue on his part, it's not like the Slytherin liked him.
"A few weeks ago"
Dear Mr. Potter,
Harry hated when Malfoy had class in the morning because as he was studying Charms, Harry was stuck in the room alone.
Malfoy raised his eyebrow "then you don't know my mother...good luck Potter"
Malfoy hesitated a little before he sighed "I guess you're right" Harry's heart leapt with joy as he heard Malfoy's decision. He wouldn't dwell much on how happy he felt, he thought, as he relaxed again in his position. He crossed his left leg under him as he leaned his back against the hand of the couch.
It was with difficulty that Malfoy was able to release Harry from his pocket. His pants being so tight and all. Harry was gently put on Malfoy's bed, and the first thing Harry did was examine the room. It was very…Slytherin, for lack of a better adjective.
He slid a quivering hand and placed two fingers on Malfoy’s lips, tracing over the soft skin.
Harry had skipped the DADA class, because he didn't want to see any of the Slytherins – preferably never again. They had all made fun of him as soon as he stepped out of Snape's classroom. Hermione reassured him that they were just being friendly, and that they were actually teasing him, to which Ron nodded in agreement. But Harry felt awful, especially when Malfoy looked at him superiorly, with his nose in the air, and didn't say a word.
"you know, after this is over, I'm expecting to be rewarded" Malfoy remarked with his usual smirk, while Harry dried himself.
"but now" he warned "you must not let anyone other than Mr Malfoy, and the few Professors, know about this, are we clear?"
"If you react like that when mother asks you, then you don't really have to answer" Malfoy snickered.
"Mornin'" Harry muttered, rubbing his eyes open. He sat up in bed "when are we leaving?"
"Do you think they are planning to do something? Like hex you?" Ron sounded worried, but also ready to defend Harry.
Harry looked at him exasperatedly but seeing Malfoy's smile was infectious. He smiled as well. He'd have to think about all this when Malfoy wasn't around.
"Look how small I am, Malfoy" Harry's pissed tone betrayed him "I can't make any noise even if I wanted to" he sat on the bed with his hands pulled together. He was sure he looked like a spoiled child who was refused a lollipop.
Across from him, he saw Malfoy's stiff back with his hands dangling on his sides while Nott was kissing him.
An hour or two passed, and Harry hadn't heard from Malfoy since he went out. He knew he shouldn't have annoyed Malfoy. Now he had to sit alone in the room, having nothing to do or anywhere to go. Zabini had come to the room earlier as Harry was about to climb down the bed, and Harry had to hide under the sheets again.
"Alright Potter" Malfoy said, and although Harry was glad Malfoy was about to tell him, the blonde had a mischievous tone to his voice "I'll tell you on one condition" he continued.
"tell me about it…not just that, I have to stay in his house!" Harry said, the gravity of this situation dawning on him. Ron flinched "bloody hell, mate. You really can't catch a break"
"Do you trust me, Harry?" Dumbledore's voice came calm and whisper-like. Harry looked at the old wizard quizzically. He had no idea what this was all about. He turned to look at Snape, but the Professor had already tuned his face to icy and unreadable again. Malfoy was staring at him.
Harry looked around the familiar office as he made his way to the chair in front of the desk.
Malfoy took Harry with him to the bathroom, closed the sink and filled it with hot water from the tap and when he went out, he left the door open just in case Harry needed anything.
And thus, he began Friday morning with a sleepy and pissed off expression.
"missed me, Potter?" Malfoy smirked and without waiting for Harry's answer continued "I had classes and some homework…I also hung around with some of my friends" he paused "I have been stuck here with you for too long…I deserve a little break" he said jokingly.
“you love him?” he heard Malfoy ask.
They finished packing and headed towards the entrance of the school where a carriage was awaiting them.
“I won’t tell anyone” Malfoy added as Harry turned back around to face him.
"Parkinson wanted a truce, and I agreed" she explained simply "I think the other two will be coming as well" she continued and Harry looked puzzled, which was probably what made Hermione explain further "Zabini and Malfoy, I think they are just waiting for the right moment" she finished, and poured some pumpkin juice into her glass.
