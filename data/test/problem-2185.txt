“Merveilleux! That would be perfect, how about you swing round to the 8th year common room tonight?” He fluttered his long lashes as he spoke. The other boy light up and agreed he’d be round after his quidditch practice. Oh yes, this was going to be
“Draco you don’t have to-“ he was interrupted as his orgasm hit and the younger man instantly started to swallow, choking as the ropes got too thick.
“Lay back and lift your legs up, I wanna eat you” Draco gasped at Harry’s brash words, but complied. “Merlin this arse is taking over my life.” Draco gave him a sultry knowing look. “What?” Harry asked curiously. “Nothing you’d want to hear, now get on with it”.
Wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist Harry pulled him so that they were facing each other, and grabbed Draco’s left hand with his right. He lifted his knuckles up to his mouth and kissed down on the golden ring and emerald studded silver ring on Draco’s wedding finger, looking up at him with a smile filled with love.
“There you are!” He grinned as Draco stepped out of the bathroom with ruffled hair and pinked skin. He stepped sleepily into Harry’s arms and snuggled against his chest. “Come on kitten, lets get you into bed”. He lifted Draco up easily and pulled them both into the bed. Draco spread himself out across Harry’s chest and entwined their legs, sighing happily as he nuzzled into Harry’s neck.
“Went to go and talk to Harry, flooed about 20 minutes ago”. Ron nodded slowly. He’d woken up because his wife wasn’t in bed next to him, and wasn’t surprised that she was awake to help a friend.
It was a set up, he knew they’d meant it to be good fun but it was just too much for his anxiety to take and he burst into tears, causing their smiles to falter.
“It’s alright”. he choked out on a broken breath. He could feel they were about to reach climax and Harry against his neck lulled him into bliss. Harry’s thrusts got deeper and longer and finally Draco moaned loudly as his release spilled out in between them, just as Harry was emptying into him. The Slytherin tried to get up but his counterpart trapped him in kisses. “Draco, I love you.” He whispered, sadness in his eyes. Draco closed his own as a tear slid down his cheek. “It’s not enough”. He slid out from under the Gryffindor and started fixing himself up, cleaning up his own spunk and making sure he didn’t look freshly fucked.
“You’re a complete joke, Fletchly”. Came a rich, confident voice from the crowd. Everyone, including the confused couple, turned to the speaker. There he was, Harry Potter, sat with a devilish grin on his lips and dark eyes that challenged a rather unnerved, but pissed off Justin.
“How dare you! The real me is exactly what I you saw, I’ve fucked a hundred men, and loved if every time! You can stick your virgin purity!”

Finally they were naked, Harry pushed them both into their bed, kissing passionately. Harry reached for his wand and cast lubing spells and of course, protection spells. “Hurry the fuck up!” His stroppy his husband yelled, causing them both to giggle.
“Oh no, Potter I cant kick you out of your bed again!” Harry chuckled deeply which made Draco very exasperated. “We’re both adults, Malfoy. I’m sure we can share the bed, right?” Draco just nodded, it wasn’t like he was going to miss an opportunity to sleep with next to Harry.
“Mum! I’m so happy you made it on time!” Elated Harry as he pulled her in for a hug. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world, precious. And how is my Draco?” She asked as she headed towards the bed.
out of ‘basic human decency’, however, your denial leads me to believe you are ashamed of your feelings for my son, which takes us to the next part of our discussion. He has a fragile heart, both literally
never done you like that” Draco winked as he licked the cum off of the corner of his mouth, then started to get up off of the bed. “We don’t talk about her. Where do you think you’re going? You haven’t come yet.” Draco turned around just as he pulled his silk shirt over his shoulders. “I didn’t think you cared if I came or not, Potter. Besides, I have to get back to my dorm so I can figure what the hell im going to tell Jacob.” That was all it took.
“Hello, I’m Draco.” Said the man, with a shy smile. Harry grinned. “Hello, Draco, I’m Harry”. He held his hand out for the other to shake, and they shared a smile.
Harry sprung up from his bed and yanked Draco up by his waist, and manhandled him back on to the bed. “We don’t talk about him. You stay in my bed until I am done with you, and since you haven’t come I am not, done, with, you” He timed his last words with his tugs at Draco’s half buttoned shirt.
Draco made his way over to his own oak desk just as Blaise clicked the lock on their en suite door. Draco froze at the sight of the cursive scripture he had read so many times before. With a stiff hand he reached forward to grasp it between his two fingers. It was from his father.
Harry couldn’t fucking stand it any longer. He and Draco had been together for TWO YEARS and people still verbally and magically attacked his boyfriend for being with Harry. Draco always acted like it was nothing, but it upset Harry to see his love hurt.
Long one boys. Some non Drarry smut so be warned! There’s also the f slur used. This chapter is 3.6k long so enjoy!
“We could tell you’d been with someone, you were so happy. And then you weren’t happy, and then suddenly you were engaged to Ginny”.
Based off of a drabble prompts ask where Draco cannot sleep..so instead has sex. with Harry, of course.
“Shut the fuck up, I don’t want to fucking look at you. bend over.” The auror’s harsh words sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. Why the fuck did being treated like just a fuck toy to Harry turn him on so much?
about him so much?” Harry looked away. “We got pretty close over the summer, I just don’t want to see him hurt.” Blaise said nothing, but started moving again.
Draco knew he looked fucking amazing. He’d bought the lingere months ago, originally intended to wear it for Harry one night. He’d gone with a black lace thong and nylon stockings. He pulled his thick black dressing gown on over it and sat on his bed, waiting.
Jacob, was the 6th year Ravenclaw whom Draco had set his sights on. He looked quite similar to his cousin but his skin was a darker and his hair was thicker and longer than Blaise’s. All in all, he was gorgeous.
Blaise chuckled. "I’ve got to get up for work, and you’ve got to stop feeling sorry for yourself. You haven’t even looked at today’s paper”.
When he arrived at the hospital wing he was greeted only by a shrieking Pansy who had to be held back by Nott and Zambini from ripping Harry apart. “What did you do to him?! He meets up with you and now he’s
“Thank you, Blaise. Not exactly language I’m used to hearing in the throne room but entertaining nonetheless”.
“Harry loves you, you know. I think he’s probably just scared and so he’s trying to get over you by dating someone else. But you’re his person, I can feel it”. He said matter-of-factly.
Later that evening, Justin was giving a speech, with Draco sat beside him looking up at him with fake adoration, laughing at his unfunny jokes and wishing the gold chandelier would just fucking fall on him- he didn’t know if he meant himself or Jacob, and he really didn’t care.
His garden was his pride and joy, he spent hours in it every day- and as a result had grown into a farmhands strong build. There were all sorts of herbs and rare species of flowers in his garden which he often traded with the witches in the local village.
“Thanks, Pansy, but I quite like the ones I’ve got” he glanced over at Draco and the Ravenclaw. “It’s nearly curfew by the way, Ravenclaw”
It’d been a week since Harry’s article had dropped and the world had gone absolutely mad. His floo had to be shut and wards intensified for the sheer amount of people trying to break in. His phone and owl had been bombarded, but there was still no sign of Draco.
The bossy bottom took charge by straddling Harry properly and grinding their groins together, eliciting beautiful groans from Harry. By this point both men had recharged libidos, panting into their kiss, foreheads pressed together. harry’s grip on his lovers waist was so tight it was almost painful as Draco rolled his hips against Harry’s thick cock.
“I’m not sorry for telling you, telling you that I loved you. Because I did, I still do, baby. I love you so so much, and I don’t want to have to spend any longer away from you”. Draco’s heart was pounding.
Within seconds harry was throwing his head back and panting. “Merlin that mouth is talented, do you like the taste of yourself on my cock?” Draco couldn’t reply as Harry shoved his head down further on his dick.
So it’s been a while since I’ve updated, it’s weird to think this fic is pretty close to being over now? I’m writing this before I’ve written the chapter as I’ve had no motivation to write, but I’m forcing myself to try.
“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open, is something I was once told. And it rings true. Our differences should only bring us closer, not distance us. For as long as we stand together, we stand undefeated”.
The start of this chapter will no doubt be confusing until the next chapter, which I hope to have up for Monday.
When Harry entered his rooms almost everything was out of place, and a very red faced blonde was staring at him.
Now as a cis man, Draco wasn’t born with a womb, but, during sex gay wizards can create bonds that make them susceptible to pregnancy, which is exactly what happened. It is very rare and often takes years to occur, and very rarely happens more than once, so obviously, Draco and Harry
“Feels better when you do it” he moaned, gasping as Harry grazed his prostate. “Obviously”. Harry growled.
“How personal is the assistance you need?” He said seductively. He leaned in close and straddled Harry. “Uh, fuck, Draco. As personal as you’d like.” He lowered his head to Harry’s neck and started sucking, causing Harry to groan.
“Tho wasn’t meant to happen”. The raven haired boy tried to argue. “I had everything set up! You were meant to have a normal day and come home to the suprise and then we’d go to the party and we’d dance and sing and then, then I was meant to propose and you’d say yes and we’d come home and-“
“Come for me”  The blonde complied, splattering all over Harry’s and his own chest. A few thrusts later and Harry’s was joining him, emptying himself out into Draco. “God, we haven’t had sex like that in a while. Now, I’d suggest you take a nap while I’m in the shower, because I’ll be ready to fuck you again soon.” Draco nodded and rolled himself into Harry’s sheets, eyes closing almost instantly.
“Like what you’re seeing, Malfoy?” Harry grinned, a hand wrapping around Draco’s neck as he pulled him in for another heated kiss. “Just get on with it Potter!” The blonde yelled. Harry chuckled before shoving two lubed fingers into the blonde.
Harry stopped still when he entered the gardens. There, standing by the fountain was a blonde, with sparkling grey eyes. He was the spitting image of Drakon, only without the wings. He’d obviously made a noise when he’d entered, the wound man turned around and looked at him with a startled glance. Harry willed himself to move forward.
“Yes, although I’ve tried to convince myself otherwise at times, I am. And that is something I should be proud of, rather than trying to hide away”.
Harry’s brain had been all over the place that afternoon, it was a mess. Ginny had come to see him today, and they’d arranged to have a “night in” soon. Like a married couple. It was ridiculous. Stress seemed to be the only thing his brain could produce- it scrambled his thoughts which had only been rambling jumbles of words to begin with. God he wished for so many things to be different.
“Is that really what you think of me?” Harry asked with an exasperated expression. “It was never just a one night stand to me. You’re never a one time anything to me, Malfoy, You really think I would have let you into my home, into my bed if it was just a one night fucking stand? I could’ve done that in any club loo in London. But I didn’t, because it was with you. I’d wanted you for so long, and when I finally got you, you just fucking left without any explanation. And then you avoided me, like a coward.”
He got up and started pacing around the room. “Hermione you can’t, tell anyone, okay? It would destroy me.” She frowned. “Harry, I’m not talking to you to save
Draco smiled, which caused Harry to blush. “Well, I do have my eye on a rather dashing 6th year Ravenclaw, who’ll be able to top
“You mean we’re having another baby? Oh Draco you really are incredible!” He knealt down and kissed at his husbands stomach, rubbing it adoringly.
He sent sparks into the fire and rushed the angel to his sofa. Harry didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t well send an owl down to Ron and Hermione, it would never survive in this weather. The man started to groan in his sleep and Harry rushed to his knees at the side of his head. “Are you alright? Can you understand me?” He was full of nerves but the man didn’t scare him, not one bit. The man blinked, and Harry was taken aback by his shining grey eyes.
Harry tumbled into his room and sought out the switch so he could get changed into more comfortable clothes. He pulled off his shirt and trousers when he remembered that he’d lent his defence notes to Seamus and he needed them back.
it.” She looked at him from across the desk, an electricity running through her widened eyes.  He took his face out of his hands and nodded.
“I can’t believe you made me wait so long! Hurry up and get naked, I need your cock in me now” the blonde whined, as he bit and kissed at Harry’s neck.
“Well I for one think the 25th Anniversary was a lot classier than this” snipped Draco as he and Harry walked down a red carpet towards the main ballroom. Harry chuckled at his husband and pulled him into his chest, wrapping his arms lightly around Draco’s waist.
let anyone hurt you again, please I’ve been so terrible to you but I just want to make it right, to be there for you whenever you need me.” The blonde started to shake, all fragility left his face. “What in the
“Dracooooo!” An obviously tipsy Pansy approached them in a shorter than short black dress. She was accompanied by a giggling Hermione who was wrapped in a beautiful red dress. “It’s wonderful you could make it, come dance!” She led him and Jacob onto the floor, paralleled from Harry and Ginny.
As they settled down into the covers, Harry knew he always would, because this was too good to risk losing.
“I had a go at him for ignoring me, but I guess that was me actually being mad that it had ended, and then he was shouting about me getting back with Ginny, and then, well I’m not sure but it ended with me saying I wanted him back and him saying he doesn’t want me back”.
Draco didn’t know what to do. He threw another book at Harry from across the living room. “That’s not fair, Harry! You told me it’d be another year, at least, until you had to back, not a fucking MONTH!”.
As he waited for the kettle to boil he opened the cupboard to find a mug and was taken aback when his shattered mug was sat their looking at him, small lines visible from where a repairo had been cast on it.
“God your ass is magic, fuck, Draco!” The blonde could feel he was going to cum and tensed up around Harry’s huge member. He felt himself pressed further into the stress as Harry sped up his thrusts.
Draco groaned at the sight of Harry’s perfectly chiselled chest, tracing his hand across the defined muscles.
“Tell me you want this, Malfoy. And I’ll leave her. I’ll leave Ginny for you.” Draco knew his words were too good to be true but nodded anyway, spurring them on. There was no way Draco could say no. They’d only been apart for, what, not even a day and he was already back in the Gryffindor’s bed. It was just like the last time they tried to end it, when school had started up again.
“So, Draco. Tell me what’s going on.” She sat in the plush arm chair that had appeared in the room of requirement. He let out a deep breath. “I’m going to tell you everything, then you’re going to help”. She nodded. “Me and Harry Potter have been fucking on and off for the past 3 months.” He opened his eyes and looked at her. “I assumed it was something like that, he’s always looking at you with such possessiveness in his eyes.” She replied, nodding.Draco looked away. He then told her all the details of what was happening, and had happened. She just continued to nod. “You know what you have to do, then, don’t you? Make him feel what you’re feeling when you look at him and Ginny. Get with Jacob, put up with him until Harry comes to his senses or then you can switch Zambinis”. Draco laughed. “And what will make Blaise want me if I get with his bloody cousin, Pans?” She had a dangerously evil smile on her face. She told him what to do, and his eyes went wide. “Well, I guess that’s that, then. Avoid him at all costs Draco, do not let yourself give in, and for the sake of all things Slytherin go clean yourself up! You look a mess, and you’re better than this.” With that, she got up and left, obviously on a mission.
Draco’s sighed defeatedly. Harry moves towards him, embracing him loosely. “How did you know that stuff? About the ring, and him..doing that to me?” he stuttered through his words, looking up at Harry timidly.
He smiled sheepishly at Jacob as he arrived outside the room of requirement. “Hey, babe. Good of you to make it!” Jacob took his arm and led him into the room. Pansy had really outdone herself, it looked like a proper club, strobe lights and slutty music ensnared the dancers s. He spotted Harry on the other side of the room and scowled as he saw the boy look at him.
“Goodbye then, Potter.” His word hung between them for only seconds before Harry lurched forward and connected Draco’s lips with his own as he held the Slytherins jaw, whose on hands were pressed to Harry’s chest. Finally, they broke apart, both panting. Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s and sighed.
“Sweet, we have been together for 46 years, married for 43. You’re everything and more that I could have ever dreamed of, and I love you more than anything, okay?” Draco nodded his head and kissed Harry’s lips intensely, whispering an ‘I love you’ to him.
“That one”. Said Harry with a grin. “I want him, send him up to my chambers immediately.” Draco had a shocked look and yelled out in outrage as he was led away to Harry’s chambers.
Ginny moved over from the bed where she’s been waiting for harry to his lap at his desk, she’d taken her shirt of to try and get his attention but he couldn’t be more distracted. “What’s wrong, Harry?” She asked impatiently. They hadn’t had sex since they got back together in August, and it was now early October. He pushed her off of his lap gently and turned back to his desk. “I’m just not in the mood tonight, Gin, I’m sorry” she stood up with a huff and went to find her shirt. “I’ll see you tomorrow then, but you better sort yourself out, Harry.” With that she stomped away and he let out a sigh. What the hell was he doing with his life? She deserved better than this. So did Draco. He shook his head as he got up to go to Draco’s dorm. They hadn’t planned on meeting tonight but he hadn’t been with Draco since Wednesday and he was all riled up, and what’s more he had just seen Blaise leave so he knew they’d be safe.
Draco moved softly onto Harry’s lap, slowly lifting himself onto Harry’s hard cock. The other man ran his hands up and down Draco’s thighs as they both sighed at the pleasure of their bodies connecting.
It wasn’t even fucking night time. 4 in the afternoon and no one tried to intervene, even when the man started screaming. They kicked at him over and over again, every time he got up they knocked him down. No one did anything, except Harry who raced downstairs and onto the street, disturbing the attackers who finally left a very broken looking Draco in their wake.
“Potter, as lovely as it is to have you-“ Justin started, a snotty tone taking over. “The diamond in your ring is fake, Draco”. Harry turned to the blonde, his face expressionless. Draco frowned, wondering how the raven haired man could know such a thing. “That’s preposterous! How dare you!” Sputtered Justin, his ugly face reddening.
He got up and made his way over to the shower, standing under the water and letting it wash over him. He reached for one of Draco’s ridiculous shower gels and slathered himself in the smell, before getting out and finishing washing himself.
As soon as they stepped outside into the rather harsh rain, they were bombarded by paparazzi and fans. Harry felt Draco squeeze his hand tightly as the hateful shouts started in his direction.
“YOU DON’T HAVE TO GO! YOU CAN’T, IT’S TOO DANGEROUS! WHAT IF THIS TIME, IT’S THE TIME YOU DON’T COME BACK TO ME?” He was trying to force the tears back, but to no avail.
“Come here” Harry pulled him into a hug and Draco sighed contently into his shoulder, before drifting off to sleep.
Harry guessed that the bed on the left was Draco’s, he didn’t think that Blaise would have a vibrator in his bedside drawer. He pulled back the sheets and lifted Draco into the bed. He took of the boys shoes and untied his belt, but left the rest of his clothes on- he didn’t want Draco to think he’d taken advantage of him. He made sure Draco was fully covered, and he couldn’t help but kiss him, softly. He held on for a few seconds before turning to leave. It was getting harder and harder each time to turn away from him.
he could smell the stench of hard liquor on Potter’s breath but just laughed as the boy sat back down. “Lighten up, Potter! Tonight of all nights is a perfect time to get drunk! You’ll be able to blame only lasting 20 seconds with Ginerva on the alcohol!” He was slurring over his words and his head was buzzing. He swallowed as much water as he could but it didn’t help, suddenly he was clasping at his heart and knew he’d made a mistake. “Fuck off, Malfoy.” The other boy snarled at him. He gripped the bar. He could feel himself falling. “Malfoy?” He could hear the concern in his voice. Black. His vision was going. A second later he felt Jacobs hands on his waist steer him away from the bar and Harry slink back into the dark.
“That was incredible” Draco whispered to Harry in awe as the older man crawled back up the bed and lay beside Draco. “Thank you, glad to see you not scowling at me”. Draco rolled his eyes as Harry pulled him into his chest.
that. But we’re not the right fit for each other.” He rested a hand against the other boys cheek. “So,” Blaise purred in his usual seductive tone, “have you ever thought about us having sex?” A smirk played on his mouth as he asked. Draco rolled his eyes. “I promise that one day I will let you ravish me to your hearts content. But
“Mr Malfoy, I understand you must be under stress for your NEWTS, but you need to take better care of yourself, you gave me quite a fright.. The last thing in the world I would want is for you to go back to how you were in your 6th year”. Draco nodded. “Believe me, neither do I. Though sometimes I wish I had had the balls to go through with it” she gasped at his words. “Don’t say such things! Recovery is difficult, and it takes a long time, but it is worth it. So do not speak like that, I’ll not have it.” He rolled over to face her and groaned. “Don’t you have anything stronger for this? Poor old Voldy damaged the valves in my heart and then died, I don’t really think it was a fair trade.” Another tut at his words. “I’ll go and see what I can find” with that, she got up curtly and left back to her office.
Harry laughed before pulling his boyfriend on top of him, dragging him down for a kiss. “I woke you up for an excellent reason though,” the former Gryffindor smirked. Draco easier his eyebrow dubiously. “And that is?”
.” hissed the Slytherin. A wicked grin formed on Harry’s face as he lines himself up with Draco’s hole, slipping just the head in before slamming all the way into him which caused him to howl so beautifully in a mixture of immense pleasure and pain. “Fucking
“Come for me darling, come on my cock”. And Draco did just that, screaming as he was hit with waves of pleasure, coating them both in his white ecstasy.
As soon as the door shut Draco sighed and deflated into Harry’s shoulder, that was slightly shaking from the rugged mans chuckles. “It’s not funny Potter! I thought you put up charms!” Draco punctuated his words by poking the Auror’s chest.
“I wish that everyone could be here tonight, those who we lost in The Battle and those who we have lost since; Seamus, Neville and Ginny will forever be in our hearts,”
Harry loved eating Draco. He sucked the muscle up and moved his tongue around inside until it loosened up, becoming slick. Draco tasted like butterscotch and Harry couldn’t get enough of it. He nipped his teeth on the side of the hole which caused Draco to let out a shout, and then started sucking over the muscle instead. It was now a sloppy, flexing mess that had Draco in shakes. “Please Harry, fuck me!” Being a people pleaser, who was Harry to refuse?
That had all been promptly thrown to the wind as Harry had proceeded to drag Draco into his private rooms and fucked him
“I guess we should get back together then, what do you say Gin?” He stuttered over every word. She nodded and smiled sheepishly. He realised he’d been holding his breath when the table erupted into cheers and clapping. The  crowd moved into the living room, but Harry was quickly pulled into the stairwell by flowing ginger hair.
“Your majesty, or, no your highness” he stumbled over his words before bowing. “I am Neville, Neville Longbottom sir from the Northern Province, I am my own lord as I have no parents to speak of. I am sorry that my face may not be the most attractive, but this scar will forever be apart of me. I am willing to be a wife, though I don’t know why we must call it a wife, if you will have me.” He bowed again before stepping backwards.
And that was probably what hurt the most, after 8 months of domestic living, intimate sex and constant butterflies, Harry didn’t love him back.
He mainly went to muggle nightclubs or gay bars, the men there were always enticed by him- his shoulder length hair that seemed to glow in the neon lights, his slim hips that were usually clad in tight jeans that hugged his rather plump arse and a black thong that rode on his hips.
“Jesus Christ, The Saviour got hot, apparently. When did that happen?” Pansy babbled on. “Looks like his Weasley and he have a good time.” Jacob chuckled. Draco looked up at him.
“I want to get to know you, the real you. Not the one that pretends to have far more nerve than he actually does”. Draco looked incredibley offended at this.
Draco had kept it. He’d kept part of Harry. Why had Harry been such an asshole? He felt like a complete idiot as the kettle started to whistle.
The guests started to disperse, waving at the young men before they left, many very excitedly. Draco didn’t know what to do. Harry was stood looking at him, smiling. “Draco, I know this is a bit fast but-“
obvious how he felt for Draco? Who else knew? He wanted to kick himself for being so reckless. He was lost in self pity when Hermione linked their arms and dragged him into an empty charms classroom. “Harry, sit down please. I need you to stay calm, and reasonably quiet throughout this conversation.” He did as he was told and took a seat on the front row. “What is it, Hermione?” She stared at him deeply. “We didn’t see much of you, over the summer Harry. You’ve rushed right back into the world after saving it, and now you’re fucking everything up for yourself.” She said matter of factly. “Right. So what are we talking about exactly?” He shifted in his seat in exasperation. “I came to see you, over the summer. At Grimmauld Place. About two days before you got back with Ginny”. Harry felt his pulse quicken. “So what?” His voice hitched in his throat. “So,
“And my beautiful, beautiful daughter Carina Lily, knows she holds the strength of every woman who fought His evil in her name. I am grateful for you all, I am so happy that so many of us are still here, living out what we fought for.”
Draco made his way over to the Slytherin table where he was met with questioning looks from his friends. He wanted to speak  in French to Pansy but he knew Theodore would understand enough to tell Blaise, who, although cane from an Italian family and spoke decent enough Italian, was completely hopeless at making connections between the two languages. “L'AS-tu fait?” She asked. He nodded. “Nous parlerons plus tard”. She nodded in return.
Harry shook his head. “We both know that’s not true. We both know you’ve spent these last two years thinking about it everyday.”
” He spat his words at a grief stricken Harry who just wanted to stay next to him. He could feel his heart shatter at each word. The tears down his lover’s face were what convinced him to leave, turning his back on Draco’s weeping. “I have
Draco felt like shit. It was all his boyfriend’s fault, obviously. Harry has sneezed once near Draco and now he- Draco- was in bed in a comatose state with a fever hotter than merlins left armpit. He groaned again as his head pounded.
“Ohhhhhhh!” Draco moaned as he was pounded into Harry’s bed, face shoved into the pillow with his ass up in the air. Harry was absolutely wrecking him. “God, your arse is the reason I wake up in the morning, how are you so
Next to greet them was Dean, looking incredibly handsome in his old age. His hair was now in long, thick dreadlocks that made him look powerful, and his vibrant red suit gave him the appearance of youth. Harry definitely thought Dean had aged the best out of all of us.
He walked over to Draco and lifted him into his arms, kissing him softly. “Sweetheart, I’m so sorry. I should’ve been more careful. I’m so sorry”. Draco sighed and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. Kissing his neck gently.
Jacob lay him down on the bed and started to take of his shoes, then his top and his trousers. Draco felt to weak to protest. “Everything going to be okay,
Finally they were alone again, Draco thought, as he curled up into his lovers arms. Harry had barely left his side, but there had always been someone else they had to deal with too. Not that Draco minded, but as Harry pulled him close and kissed his forehead, he was pleased to be on their own. He had never been happier in his life, and for that, he was grateful.
“Harry, I haven’t seen you in two years, and you turn up and destroy my engagement. Why? Why? It’s not as if we’re in love, and that stuff-“
When the car pulled up there were photographers at them from every angle, shouting out at them. Justin linked their arms tightly and whispered in Draco ear,
“Did you, did you really expect me to stay. Potter?” Draco managed between the intense thrusts. Harry didn’t say anything. He took his hand away from the blonde’s now reddened neck, causing him to let out a whimper. His thrusts rapidly increased as Draco pushed his hips back against him, shouting out in pleasure. He felt his face be pushed down into the desk by a strong hand, his partner’s grunts growing louder before they both finally reached climax.
Harry did his best to calm his breathing. “I know for a fact you’ve had sex with Blaise Zambini since we split up” Harry spat out harshly.
Other than raising his eyebrows at Harry’s unexpected arrival, Draco’s expression remained unchanged at Harry’s arrival.
Then, Harry had told him about Grimmauld Place, told him he’d put Draco on the wards and he could floo in anytime he liked. And oh did he use that to his advantage.
Just as he was about to reply with a snappy rejection, he saw Potter over the Ravenclaw’s shoulder and a wicked grin enticed his face. “You have Saturday to make it up to me, Darling. I look forward to it.” With a quick glance over to the now staring Gryffindor, he pushed his lips against the Ravenclaws who greeted him with suprise but obvious pleasure. “I can’t wait” Jacob winked at him before making his exit with a skip in his step.
“We all had to make some tough decisions in that war, many of us children still, forced into making hurrendous decisions.”
He rubbed his eyes as he pulled on a T-shirt, fumbling for his glasses as he yawned. He got dressed reasonably quickly, but dressed casually. Narcissa wouldn’t approve, but he was Harry Potter.
The nurse asked if they wanted to let their friends back in, and the couple agreed fervently. Pansy and Hermione bounded into the room first, exclaiming shrilly at the sight of their god daughter.
“Sorry to interrupt”. Came a voice from the doorway. There, in all of her glory, stood Narcissa Malfoy. She smiled at her sons as they noticed her presence.
He rolled his eyes at the Gryffindor and stood up, seeking the attention of his Ravenclaw who, he was pleased to see, was already heading over to him.
The third man stepped forward. He looked nervous, and was rather smaller than the others but one key feature was a scar that ran down the side of his face.
“Your highness,” he paused to bow. His voice sounded like silk and something mischievous. “I am Blaise Zambini, son of Dutchess Zambini from the Southern Province. I admit I have been touched by a man, but I am no whorehouse and willingly offer myself as a wife to you”.
He was going to be sick. Jacob was pinning him down to the bed and Draco was far too drunk and weak to move him off. “Jacob,
He took the stairs slowly, and noticed Potter’s door was open as he reached the second floor. Draco didn’t really mean to poke his head into the dorm, but he had. Now he was pressed against the door on the closed side and knew he should’ve just gone to bed.
“Only in this life”. Harry’s magic was pushing him towards the angel and then, they were kissing. And it was like he was in the clouds, he could feel every fibre of his body screaming out in ecstasy. He lifted the angel up into his arms, minding not to touch the hurt wing. He lead them upstairs, all while never taking his lips off of Drakon’s.
Harry looked at Draco and his mother lovingly, he loved having them both in his life. Draco had completed him, truly.
“That was excellent” Draco sighed as he rolled off of Harry’s chest, both of them panting heavily. “There’s nothing like a good orgasm to get you to sleep”. Draco laughed lazily, nodding his head in agreement.
“You are going to make the perfect wife”. Harry said with a grin as he pulled Draco back down onto his chest, both of them sighing in satisfaction.
He ran his hands down his chest to smooth out the jumper, wondering what Potter would be doing with Her today. He was reasonably sure last night had signified the end of their shenanigans. He added a long overcoat to his outfit and some suede loafers. Yes, he looked gorgeous. It was now quarter to 11 and he was meeting Jacob at 11:30. He had almost an hour to sit about and mope about Potter. Fantastic.
“Ótan eímaste kai páli mazí”. And with that, he was gone, vanished into thin airC, leaving a rather dazed Harry in his wake.
“Hey, Ginny, are you almost ready to go?” Harry paced around his rooms as he waited for his girlfriend to come out of the bathroom. They were going to Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione and at this rate they were going to be late. When she finally came out of the bathroom he couldn’t deny she looked stunning. “How do I look?” She asked him with a bright smile. He smiled back at her as he held out his hand. “Stunning, Gin. Now come on or we’ll be late!” She grabbed his hand and they made their way down to the main entrance to meet Ron and Hermione.
“Ride me” Harry groaned as they broke away from the kiss. Draco nodded and summoned some lube, coating Harry’s thick fingers in the slime.
They were planning to go out again tonight, it was a really fancy club that they’d been invited to by possibly the gayest man Harry had ever met, who adored both him and Draco who adored him back.
Draco felt the tears run down his face as he let himself be kissed once more. Harry rested his forehead against his.
“God your arse looks delicious”. His voice was deep with desire as he surveyed his fiancés body. He was wearing nothing but a silk thong harry had bought him a few weeks ago, and it was making him harder than hell. The thong barely covered Draco’s cock and rode high on his hips, the silk slipped between his arse cheeks and covered his tight hole. “Gonna eat you out”. He said. Draco moaned in satisfaction as Harry pulled off the underwear with his teeth, trailing it down Draco’s legs.
“Bastard! Fucking bastard!” He yelled, scratching at Harry’s back, making sure to leave stinging marks.
Harry got his wand out and spelled the sheets from the bed into the linen basket. He wizzed out some sheets from the cabinet and had them make the bed. He decided to take his own clothes off, he much preferred close contact with Draco anyway.
“Nothing is ever up to your standards is it, Darling?” Harry kissed his husbands forehead. Draco smirked up at him.
As soon as Draco heard the shower start running he opened his eyes. His mind was far too busy to fall asleep. He knew that he could gather up his clothes and run up to his dorm before Harry had finished his shower, but he also knew he’d never do it. It was like a spell had been cast over him, pulling him closer to Harry. He couldn’t leave even if he wanted to.
“It’s alright, don’t worry. You’re welcome to it and you’re welcome to stay, as long as you need Malfoy.” He smiled at him again and it sent tingles down Draco’s spine.
“They are part of the reason why I cannot possibly be the main man. Just because I was the one to land the final blow, does not mean I ended Voldemort all on my own. Both Ginny and Neville fought bravely then, and Seamus would have probably ended old No Nose in a much more entertaining way than me!”
Harry had just stepped through his front door and was thinking about what curry to order in for dinner when he noticed that his living room light was turned on, and he knew he hadn’t left it like that.
His day had been completely miserable though, despite Ron’s certainty. The paper work he’d been asked to finish off was taking far longer than he’d hoped.
Harry rolled onto his back. He knew Draco was right. In all fairness, he still wasn’t entirely sure how this whole thing had started. It was back at the start of the summer, the war had ended and Harry had decided to return Draco’s wand. The other boy had invited him in, one thing had lead to another and he had lost his virginity. Things just spurred on from there.
“Potter, for fucks sake, stop it.” He felt his lip quiver. “If you’re not going to listen I’m just going to leave”. He stood up, but was immediately pushed back down into his seat, he’d no idea how Harry had been able to move that fast.
The 50th Anniversary of the Battle Of Hogwarts was a fine event, lavished with the most expensive decorations possible and wines with exquisite vintages, all for the star guests, Harry Potter and the Order. Of course, not everyone was still there unfortunately, but still it was important to celebrate what they had achieved, as that kept the memories of their lost friends going, too.
“How could he forget my birthday?! I’m his boyfriend! He completely ignored me this morning and, and”. He couldn’t finish his sentence, he could feel tears pricking his eyes.
She looked at him for a second. “I know how you’ve treated my friend these past few months, there’s nothing you could do or say that would make me help you find him”.
The first man stepped forward. He was shorter than Harry, dirty blond hair and a screwed up nose that made his rather attractive face seem ghoulishly ugly. He bowed before he spoke.
“Today’s issue of the Daily Prophet is a special one, and finally answers some of the questions we’ve all been dying to ask. I, Barnabas Cuffe have had the pleasure of being able to interview Mr Potter on his recent engagement and sudden split up”.
Harry’s house was fucking freezing, so he looked through a pile of washing and found one of Harry’s giant hoodies and pulled it on over his head. It smelt wonderful. He pulled the soft material up to his nose to breathe in the aroma that was so unapologetically Harry.
“It’s alright”. He sighed as Harry sat them down on the sofa and held Draco tightly. “I’ve no idea how we’ll manage two children though”. Said Draco.
Harry turned back to yell at them but felt Draco’s hand on the side of his face, stopping him in his tracks. “Harry darling, it’s not worth it, come on.” He nodded at his boyfriend and they kept moving.
Within the next few minutes they had been able to find the Order members they had gone to school with, all of them greeting them enthusiastically.
“That’s one way to sober a party up.” She spoke in a cold tone that was obviously angry but also mixed with something else. “You saved my Draco, and I thank you for that. But you and I
“Harryyy! Oh gods I’m coming!” Harry smirked, kissing his husband through his orgasm as he sought out his own release which came shortly after.
Harry looked up from the lunch table to see Ron walking towards him, he nodded at his friend who nodded back in turn. Ron was rather good looking now, not that harry hadn’t always admired him. He was fucking huge- easily 6’6”, thin but stocky in the shoulders. His hair was very soft and his face was an explosion of freckles and jawbone. Yes, more and more girls had started noticing him now, not just because he was the Chosen One’s best mate. But he only had eyes for Hermione. Cute as fuck.
Draco used this to push past Harry and walk out into the living room. He noticed that Harry had collected all his stuff up and piled it up against the wall.
“Not here” he chuckled in reply, and that was the only warning Draco got before he felt the familiar tug behind his navel and he was spun into an all too familiar bedroom.
Harry sat there for over five minutes as Draco read the whole article to him. They sat in silence as Draco folded the newspaper and looked across at Harry.
“I did! But your incessant moaning must have broken the barriers” The smirk on the idiots face was infuriating to Draco,
Being named the Saviour had meant that Harry hadn’t had to share with anyone else, and had a double room to himself. Draco’s room also happened to be right above Harry’s so it never looked suspicious when they walked down to the common room, even if they did look
“It’s alright, James, completely not your fault. Mr Potter here and I had just agreed on a final plan, tell Harrison I’ll have the file on his desk tomorrow” The other man nodded furiously before scurrying out of the room.
Draco’s hand jumped out and slapped Harry right across the face. His wrists were instantly grasped and he struggled against his captor. “I am not just sex, Potter. I am not just holes for your pleasure.
“I only let guys with sm-All aNd W-ee-uh-ak dick fuck me” he giggled. Harry slapped his already red buttocks and earned a yelp. Harry leaned in to Draco and spoke huskily into his ear “Don’t act like you don’t
“Oh.” They sat in silence for another minute before Harry put the eyeliner wand down. “Perfect” He said with a grin. Draco got up and looked round for a mirror.
Harry’s movements stilled behind Draco, both of them panting to catch their breath. The tension was like static between the unlikely lovers. If you could call them that. Slowly, Harry removed himself from the other man with a mutual hiss.
Two days later, they were back home in bed, with James tucked up between them as Draco held Lily. James had been enchanted by the sight of his little sister, wanting to know everything about her. The resemblance between them was shocking, although James’ hair was blonde and clearly much tamer than his sisters. Harry couldn’t help but be overjoyed at the sight of his family, still not understanding how he deserved such a wonderful husband, and their two brilliant children.
“Oh! Sorry Malfoy, I didn’t see you there” He blinked back in suprise and have her a curt smile. “It’s alright, Weasley, it’s no worry.” She smiled back at him and confinued on her way.
“Darling, it is so good to see you!” She said happily, kissing him on the cheek. He smiled at her before pulling her into a corner to chat.
“That’s rather a lot, isn’t it? I’m sure our readers will also feel a lot when reading this. Now, Mr Potter, how do you feel?”
“Harry?” He called out as he walked into his open plan living room. He could see Harry in the kitchen and saw him flinch at Draco’s voice, sighing at being caught.
Twenty minutes later Blaise arrived back from dinner. “Blaise, Darling, what are you doing tonight?” He turned to look at Draco while rummaging through his wardrobe. “A Gryffindor. She’s bloody wonderful Draco I tell you, you ought to try women out some time.” He laughed at his own joke but Draco just pouted. “Have fun, though tonight was going to be the night I let you do me, instead”. Blaise stood still, his brow furrowing. Draco lay back and threw open the dressing gown to reveal himself, and Blaises jaw dropped. “Change of plans”.
Draco hadn’t even noticed Ginny Weasley until she was about 4 inches away from him. He’d just come out of Blaise’s apartment and was waking down the avenue when she’d caught him.
Draco spent the rest of his free period in a haze, dawdling around the school. He had a date with Jacob that evening but he’d decided fuck it, he couldn’t date him when he was so infatuated by Potter. Right then he walked slap bang into Ginny Weasley.
Both Draco and Harry had aged well, neither of them were as physically fit as they had been in their twenties but Harry still had broad shoulders and stocky thighs, he’d shot up to 6’3 so his physique suited him. His unruly hair was still inky black, but was now heavily peppered with grey and white hairs that gave a Harry a very charming appearance, that matched the thick, but well groomed, beard on his jaw.
“Today’s been great, Harry, thank you. I was hoping we could give the other night another try, maybe? When you’re less distracted?” The ginger girl looked up at him hopefully and he nododed. “Yeah, sure thing. Gin” He was just about to make another excuse when a loud slapping sound made them both turn towards the entrance hall.
He roared with anger at the crowd as he felt his magic bubble over inside and it burst out through him, knocking everyone backwards. Somehow his magic was able yo locate who has set off the spell and Harry tore through the magic to end the spell. “Don’t you fucking EVER touch the man I love. I love him! I’m not going to stop SO YOU BETTER FUCK OFF”.
Draco’s legs felt like jelly as he walked down the corridor towards the Head Auror’s office. He’d managed to avoid the man for the past 4 months, not that it has been easy. He’d spent many of his lunches in the toilets in the code breaker break room, knowing the Auror spent many of his own lunches hoping to catch Draco.
“Boys! you had to miss my party but you caused your own right across the front page of the Prophet!” Draco and harry woke with a start, tangled up in their sheets.
“Pansy?” He spoke, completely ignoring her fellow Slytherins. The black haired girl perked up at him. “Yes Potter?” He handed the book over to her. “‘Mione said to give this to you, and to tell you she’ll be sharing Ron’s bed tonight” Pansy gasped before giggling. “Good for her! Thanks for this, Potter.” Harry nodded at her before turning to the stairs.
“I’m going to come, Harry, please let me come!” Draco screamed as Harry hit his prostate at a new angle. “Go ahead, Happy Birthday!” And with that, Draco came, happy and secure.
So Draco just sighed as he read over the evening post, staring at the rock on Ginny Weasley’s finger.
“We all know she only got back with you because she’d broken up with her quidditch coach at the end of the season, mate. Besides, if you’re gay, you won’t work out anyway, will you?”
The ending of this chapter is weird??? Idk it seems to short/weird but I hope you guys don’t mind, thanks for reading loves <3
Draco held his breath as Harry lowered his face to his, staring at him intensely. Draco felt himself move forward with Harry as their lips collided, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine. Harry was gentle, but powerful. Draco let out a gasp as Harry tore his lips away, smirking at his lover.
“Thank you, Neville. This whole pretence gets on my nerves as well, but I admire your bravery. Please step forwards, number four”.
He kissed him with all the sorry he had, he kissed him with all the love he had for him, even if it was platonic, he kissed him because he didn’t know what else to do.
Harry knocked on the door and heard a muffled yell from Seamus. “Come in!” Harry watched as Seamus hastened to cover himself. “Alright, Harry?” He said with a flustered face. Harry smirked at him. “Yeah, I just need my Defence notes back”
all about?!” Said a dazed Ron. Hermione gave Harry a knowing look, but kept quiet. “I’m gonna go see Draco, guys. I’ll see you back up in the common room?” They nodded and turned to leave.
Goodnight Seamus, Goodnight Dean” Harry laughed at the gasps he heard as he exited the dorm. He wondered when that had happened.
“Well he does. You need to go to Ginny and then go back to him again and tell him you’ve finished with her, and that you can be together again”.
“I don’t want to hear your excuse. You can’t just give me wet-willies.” Draco huffed, shoving his boyfriend backwards.
Draco had no clue where he was when he woke up. It didn’t smell like his room, he was wearing a very oversized T-shirt with apparently nothing underneath, but the bed he was in was comfortable, so it was very hard to leave.
“He’s your person, Harry.” He nodded to himself, and causing a confused expression to take over his friend’s face. He turned back to Hermione and they went upstairs, leaving them to figure it out for themselves.
“I love you, Draco”. And he stood up and walked to the floo, grasped a handful of powder and readied himself for the journey. Draco screamed again, this time out of grief. He picked up the framed photo of the two of them and threw it to the floor, smashing the glass into a thousand shards of anguish, as Harry shouted “The Ministry!” And was gone seconds later.
With a lazy flick of his wand the note found itself tucked into Harry’s hand. Harry looked up and held eye contact with Draco as he opened the note. He nodded and went back to his book.
“I think you’re forgetting who you belong to, Malfoy” said a husky voice near his year. He moaned into his captor as he felt a strong leg push between his own.
“Oh good! We made it on time!” Came a shrill voice from the doorway, as four people spilled into their room.
This is a really short chapter guys I’m sorry- it’s just 500 words as an interlude before the next chapter. Light smut and Topless Ginny guys.
Draco’s mind was spinning, he had no clue what was going on. He could feel Jacob carrying him upstairs but all he could see was black and purple flashes, and his head wouldn’t stay still. “What’s going on?” He slurred as they made it to his dorm. “Shhh, we’re gonna get you to bed, okay?” He managed to nod without throwing up- but felt uneasy for a different reason.
The wings in question were magnificent. They were white, smooth like silk and glittering in the rainfall. He scooped the man up into his arms and the wings traipsed over Harry’s arm.
What an awfully lovely letter. It was not unlike ones his father had sent him before, but now it just might send him over the edge. He sat down clumsily on the astronomy tower floor, and continued to swig on his whisky. He was going to get drunk, and fast, and maybe he’d throw himself off the astronomy tower. Who knows, maybe it’s written in the stars. Coming out as gay had been the scariest thing Draco had ever experienced- and he’d experienced a hell of a lot. But when you’re caught in bed with the Head Aurors son, you’re not really left with much choice. That had been his first big scandal after the war, as it was before his father was sent down. He’d been screamed at by his father on the one time he’d visited him when he was in custody awaiting his trial. He’d been told many a time that the Malfoy name wasn’t his anymore, but he didn’t care. “Draco Potter, how ridiculous does that sound.” The boy laughed sadly.
Draco took the opportunity to try and break away from Harry but the Gryffindor pushed him right back into the wall, causing them to stumble into each other.
“Fuck, you’re made for me, aren’t you baby? Moulded for my cock, weren’t you?” The blonde nodded rapidly, unable to form words to reply.
“Wait, Draco, do you mean?” Draco nodded nervously. Harry slid Draco off his lap and stood up, run his hands through his hair frantically. Then he let out a laugh, and then he broke into an enormous smile and started shouting out in glee.
Harry strolled back towards his own dorm while keeping his eyes trained on the Slytherins he was fast approaching. He could feel them openly staring at him and met Draco’s eyes, which proceeded to narrow.
He decided not to open the letter straight away. He tucked it into his desk draw and would open it...later. He hated letters from his father. They were always filled with hatred.
Harry had no idea what to expect of the men that had been chosen to be his possible wife, but when the four courtiers entered the throne room he was instantly attracted to the striking blonde who was clad in tight black robes and a scowl that could kill a man playing on his face.
“We don’t, but I’m sure you can make time for me” Harry spoke confidently as he sat down in his grey muggle suit.
I miss our weekends in bed together, eating breakfast in bed and then reading or just talking or just being together. I miss doing everything with him”.
“Malfoy! Look what you’ve done to my coffee!” She screeched. Trawley just shook his head and Draco found himself holding back tears for the second time that day. Without saying anything he just got up from his desk, wincing at the scolding feeling in his thigh, and left his office. He could hear people calling his name but he didn’t care.
“Of course I do, Daddy. Only for you”. Draco moaned the words as Harry lifted his legs up to extract the thong.
“You like that?” Asked Harry with a smirk. Draco could only nod, all of his courage suddenly leaving him stranded. They sat there, grinding down on each other, moaning and panting.
“Don’t you dare fucking tell me how I feel when you’re too much of a pussy to admit your own feelings. Now get the fuck out!”
“Draco baby, what’s wrong?” Harry rushed forward to him and wrapped his arms around him. Draco let himself lean into Harry’s touch, sobbing into his shoulder.
He trudged down into the Common Room and noticed Hermione and Pansy who has been whispering rapidly in the corner both stop and stare at him. His friend offered him a weak smile which he ignored. “If everyone’s done staring, I’ll be in McGonagall’s office if anyone would like to stalk me!” He ended his sentence with a shout and a wave of his arms, which caused all of the eighth years to do anything but look at him, let alone follow him.
“Mum!” Groaned Ginny, her brothers chuckled but the group had now turned to face Harry, who had no idea what to say. “Uh, well, I think it’s something me and Gin need to talk more about-“ he was cut off by Molly tutting. “What’s there to talk about? You two belong together!” He turned to Ginny who smiled awkwardly at him. “Well,”
“Your father told me about him being broke. And wanted me to do something about it, so I did. I knew he’d hit you the moment I saw you talking to Pansy, and I wanted to rip him apart right there”.
“Did you hear about Malfoy?” Ron asked casually before filling his plate up with lunch. Harry looked at him questioningly. “No, what’s he done now?” Ron paused to swallow before answering, “He was rushed to the hospital wing, ‘pparently some Ravenclaws found him near the common room, looked like he’d had a heart attack or something”.
Harry rolled over to face his en suite, where he was met by a slightly damp blond who was drying his hair.
“Your Highness, these are the 4 men chosen that have been deemed most suitable to be your future wife, obviously it would have been easier to find more courtiers if you wanted an actual woman to be your wife, but nonetheless they are here. They will each introduce themselves to you and then we will lead on as you choose”.
Harry fucked him slowly through his high, chasing his own release. The blonde clamped down on Harry’s cock, causing the man under him to cry out dirtily, shooting his load up into his husband.
Draco turned and looked at him then, his face scrunched in anger. “Sorry for what, Potter? Telling me you loved me? Or sorry that I’m not as much of a lap dog for you as you hoped? Did you really expect me to stay when you left me?”.
With that, she shooed him away and went behind the curtain of Draco’s cubicle. Harry was in shock. In all the time they’d spent together Malfoy had never once mentioned it, nor had he ever seen draco taking any potions. He slipped back into the ward and crept behind the cubicle he had assumed Draco was in, and lay in wait for Madame Pomfrey to leave.
“Ah, Harry! Did the storm get you badly?” His red haired friend greeted him. “No, thankfully it wasn’t too bad, you?” His friend shook his head.
than me?” Draco looked up into the steely eyes that bore into him and took a minute to contemplate the question.
Potter! Some warning next time!” Harry just smirked as he pulled half way out and slammed back in, using his hips to set a harsh, fast pace.
“My my, Potter, are you looking for a new partner tonight in that suit?” Harry spun around to see his boyfriend surveying him with a look of lust in his eyes. “Of course not, can’t say the same for you though, God’s I could just eat you up right now.” His boyfriend chuckled as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, snuggling into the crook of his shoulder.
“Yeah, like Hermione’s my person. You’re his. Where is she, by the way?” Draco was staring at him now.
He felt Harry’s arms wrap around his waist, and then he was being lifted and pushed up into the wall. Harry kissed him fiercely, it was all teeth and tongues fighting each other. “Gonna fuck me, Potter?” Draco spat, digging his fingers into Harry’s neck, causing him to growl.
“I have loved you every day since we were 14, and when you told me you loved me I thought you might actually mean it. But you left me, you left me and broke my heart!”. He reached out to the wall to steady himself. Harry rushed forward and pulled a reluctant Draco into him.
. And Draco. And I assumed you and he had been a one night stand or something- I atleast expected you to have ended it before you got together with Ginny. But no. It wasn’t just the other night that confirmed it, either. It just confirmed to me that you and he were still going on”. Harry was shaking. He let out a long breath before turning back to his friend. “Hang on, what do you mean it only ‘confirmed we were still going on’?”. Hermione’s eyes widened and some of the confidence left her face. “Draco may have told Pansy. He was stressed out of his mind and had no one else to turn to about his feelings, least of all you, Harry.”
Harry sat up as the Slytherin limped round the bed and started to get Dressed. “Draco I-“ the blonde turned to him, anger set on his face. “No, Potter. It’s always going to be
“The stable is in shambles, but nothing we can’t fix”. Harry nodded in relief. “Ah look, if it isn’t my favourite girl!” Harry chortled as Hermione made his way over to them. “Yes, well we had a new arrival this morning, Harry. I think you should go and say hello.” Harry was skeptical about the twinkle in her eyes. “Where, in the stable?” She shook her head. “No, in the water gardens”.
Harry stood up just as Draco was tying his tie. “You’re right, this has gone on long enough.” The Slytherin straightened up and looked at Harry.
I said I'd have the next chapter up soon, and here it is! I haven't completely decided on how the next chapter will go, but I'll update the tags when it's released. Hope you enjoy!
No, as far as the world was concerned Harry Potter hadn’t spent every night on Draco’s sofa watching muggle television and eating ready meals and takeaway, he didn’t have his own body wash in Draco’s shower, nor did he fall asleep in his bed every night.
Draco still wasn’t used to not waking up next to Harry, he still had Harry’s coffee mug in his kitchen cupboard.
Draco’s favourite thing to see was his husband holding their son, they were what made him happiest. He was 39 weeks pregnant, and had gone into labour earlier that morning. They’d fire called the medi-witch who’d told them to come in when his contractions started to be 30 minutes apart. Their daughter was on her way.
He woke in the hospital wing, people gathered all around him. “Draco!” He heard Pansy cry and he reached out for her hand. “I’m alright you silly bint, All you seem to do is worry about me” his friends laughed softly. “Only because you give us so many reasons to be worried” chimed in Blaise, Draco smiles at that. “Out, the lot of you. If you’re not careful you’ll cause Mr Malfoy to have another attack, he’s unstable as it is and I need to make sure he’s not in danger”. He heard her try to push his friends away. “D-danger?” Pansy stuttered in a timid voice. She squeezed his hand tightly into her grasp. “But he’s fine, isn’t he?” Madame Pomfrey gave no reply. He heard her escorting his friends out and sighed.
Harry sighed in exasperation and brought his boyfriend into his arms again. “Yes, to you. And if you’ll let me get on with it then we can be engaged”. This couldn’t be happening. Harry wasn’t really getting down on one knee, he wasn’t really pulling out a little black box and opening it to reveal a gorgeous silver band, studded with diamonds.
He couldn’t keep his eyes off of Draco and Jacob. He was dancing the best he could with Ginny, but watching Draco practically fuck that guy on the dance floor was maddening. “I’m going to the bathroom!” Ginny yelled to him. “I’ll wait over by the bar!” He yelled back over the music, she nodded before making her way off the dance floor. He found an empty bar seat and ordered a whiskey.
“You crazy bastard! There’s nothing there yet and I’m only about 3 weeks, there’s still a chance we could-“
“Ginny and Neville will be here any minute to pick him up, darling, so now’s the time to say goodbye” Harry let out a sigh at his words.
But there was no mistaking that platinum blonde hair, that had grown out long on top, no longer straight but slightly curling. He was even thinner than at school! Harry was just trying to make his mind up what to do for the billionth time when two men dressed in full black came up and attacked Malfoy in the street.
“Because I’m fucking tired of it! No one knows about us! We’ve been together for 8 months and The Prophet still writes articles about when you’re going to settle down with the
look at himself. He’d evened our quite well over the last year and grown a good 6 inches. He was no longer so scrawny, but now had broad shoulders and muscles had formed up and down his limbs. He’d put in some extra work and now had a quite good six pack.
To make matters worse his boss, Tawley, (who is a complete twat!) told him he’d be staying for an extra half hour after work because he had to finish a report that wasn’t due for three bloody weeks! But Draco loved his job as a social worker for magic kids, so he agreed with a curt nod.
The man sat in the chair sat up immediately, eyes wide with a smirk instantly forming on his stupidly handsome face. “Malfoy! To what do I owe the pleasure?”
Of course Draco didn’t have anything at Harry’s, Harry had kept their affair confined in the walls of Draco’s apartment.
“I’m in love with you, potter. Have been for a while. This year, coming back and having a second chance at everything, even being friends with you, was incredible. But I can’t help my feelings and I can’t bear being around you when I feel like this for you but you’re in love with her, Ginny, instead and you’re straight so I should never have gotten my hopes up when you wanted to be friends because now I’ve ruined the one thing that’s made me happy, but it hurts too much to be around you.”
Furious. Complete fury had wrapped itself around Draco as he’d stormed away from Jacob- who the hell did he think he was? He stormed into his dorm to find a rather startled Blaise watching him. “Are you okay, Dray?” He didn’t answer his friends question but instead reached for the letter in his desk and the bottle of fire whisky he kept in his dresser. He slammed out of the room without another word and made his way to the tallest tower.
“We’ve known each other for quite a long time, but I didn’t properly get to know him until just over a year ago, when we met again at a mutual friend’s 18th  Birthday Party. He took me back to his house and in the morning I never wanted to leave”.
Draco made a yelling sound deep in his throat before he picked up the ornamental statue from his coffee table before hurling it to the ground, watching it smash.
“I’m so sorry Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter. It’s just i was sent up by our head of department to check how negotiations were going since you;d been gone so long, your secretary Mr Potter told me she thought by the sounds of it you might be fighting so i thought it best to just walk in, gosh I’m so-” Draco held up a hand to silence the other man.
you prick. And I didn’t tell you because it’s not relevant to you. 6th year is also none of your bloody business. Kindly
The time neared 8 o’clock when Draco had just finished getting changed. He looked irresistible, and he knew it. The shirt showed of his sharp figure, and the tight muggle jeans (Dolce and Gabbana mind) shaped his assets quite nicely. Just as he was ready to leave, Blaise entered their dorm.
“I was wondering if you’d like to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend? There’s a French restaurant just opened that I thought you might like to try” Draco let his smile travel up to his eyes which caused a satisfying blush to spread over the other boy’s face. Draco knew if he looked over to the Gryffindor table he’d be met with rage filled green, but he had to act as though Potter was nothing to him.
Draco Malfoy loves dancing. Not the classical, ballroom dancing he’d been raised on- no, he loved the dirty, grinding up on a stranger type of dancing.
“Right I’m off guys, see you tomorrow” The dashing Slytherin announced upon entering the common room. Blaise winked at Pansy as she started to ask where he was going, but Draco nudged her as a hint.
He couldn’t cope with these feelings. They reminded him of sixth year, and he’d promised to never let himself get that bad again. He’d decided he was just going to go home, pray Harry wasn’t there and pack his bag. He’d go to Paris somewhere and just get away from the feeling of being overwhelmed, and come back when, we’ll he didn’t know when. It didn’t seem as though anyone would care if he left.
Between fierce kisses they managed to make it over to the bed, where Harry pushed them both down into the sheets. They scrambled at each other’s and their own clothes, desperate to be closer to one another.
Jacob nodded. “Thanks, Gryffindor. I don’t think we’ve been formerly introduced. Jacob Zambini”  The boy made no move to properly introduce himself with a hand shake, so Harry just nodded at him. “Well, of course you already know who I am. Goodnight”.
“I love doing that so much, especially with you” Draco sighed, pulling his Harry into a hug. “I love you too, pretty”. This was some of Harry’s favourite sex that they had, full of love and happiness. And he’d missed it a lot, missed spending time together, but now the could spend time as a bigger family, the family neither of them thought they would have- or deserved. But, they did.
Harry hung his head, looking down at Draco through his lashes. “I should have come back for you sooner, and I’m sorry, Draco. Truly. I just hope you’re willing to give me another chance?”
The dark haired boy raised an eyebrow at him in speculation as Draco shifted his way down Harry’s body.
First of all, I am SO SORRY it's taken me so long to update this, I wrote this back in October and published it on Tumblr but never got around to adding it on here, thank you for all the support and I hope you all enjoy this!
“But of course, it couldn’t, partly because you loved other people but also because, you’re gay, is that correct?”
Just then, there was a knock at the door before a mane of red hair joined them in the living room. “Hey guys! Oh I’m so happy for you both! We’d obviously be willing to babysit the new one if they’re anything like James is!” They laughed as Harry handed James off to Ginny.
“Of course we did! We wouldn’t miss this for the world” Pansy spoke again. “Some witch tried to stop ya coming in, as if she could”. Scoffed Ron. Hermione and Blaise nodded too.
He spotted Jacob in the great hall and the boy arose upon his arrival. “Hey, Draco I wanted to apologise, I’m sorry I upset you”. Not much of an apology. Draco took a deep breath before smiling at the Ravenclaw. “Hey, it’s alright. I think,” he took the time to look away and blush, Goodness he belonged on the stage. “I think we should maybe try being a, a couple?” He made his eyes wide. Jacob, of course looked like Christmas had come early. “Definitely, can I come over tonight?” Draco giggle. “Of course, I’ll want to see my boyfriend every evening” If he was completely honest he wanted nothing less. Jacob nodded, kissed Draco on the cheek before waltzing his way out of the great hall.
leave your lover”. Draco shoved him hard. He stalked away in search of Jacob, leaving a disgruntled and confused Harry behind him.
Drakon smirked. “Eager as always, Hades.” Harry didn’t question the wrong name- he’d heard it somewhere before, but he couldn’t think where- and just focused on the fact that he was kissing an angel. An angel who was pulling him out of his shorts and also unwrapping his own gown, to reveal more beautiful milky white skin. He kissed the angel again as their bodies connected, Drakon releasing a moan that set Harry’s ears ablaze it was so sensual.
feelings. You’re hurting everyone around you, and you need to realise it- and fix it- before you have
No. He wouldn’t let him. He’d right in, give the proposition, and leave. He took a deep breath as he reached the door and knocked briskly.
“Never. Ever ever, Draco. I wouldn’t do that to you. Couldn’t. Come here you idiot.” Draco awkwardly rushed towards Harry, knocking them both into the chair opposite Harry’s desk. They kissed passionately, elegant hands rested against a thick beard, whilst calloused fingers ran through silky hair. A slight tug on Draco’s hair caused him to release a moan, and for a grin to infect Harry’s face.

“What do you mean? Did someone take him?” Draco saw the worry rush into Harry’s eyes at that moment.
“Malfoy?” Came a hesitant voice from the door. “It’s me, Ron. Are you alright in there?” The voice was laced with uncertainty but it seemed genuine. He begrudgingly opened the door and offered the other man a meek smile.
So much stuff is meant to be in italics but since AO3 hates me I can’t make any of the words italic- if anyone knows how to fix this that would be helpful? I’ll hopefully update tomorrow and maybe edit the italics into this chapter. (Edit- Italics have been fixed.
This is based off of a prompt from keyflight790 which is why they are listed as a co-creator, I've also linked their Tumblr in the footnote.
“Yes, I wanted you to stop hiding me and you decided that meant we had to split up, so we did, Potter. Don’t try and turn this on me”.
“When I kissed you, that was right after a different boyfriend had hit you, wasn’t it? I’d wanted to rip that one to pieces too, come to think of it”.
Draco kissed Jacob lightly on the cheek as they said goodbye, he was quite lucky really as Potter was right, it was very nearly the 6th year curfew.
“Why the hell am I here?” Spat the blonde. Harry just smiled and walked forward towards the blonde, who’s face quickly morphed into fear as he realised harry had cornered him.
things you let me do to you?” The husk in Harry’s voice turned Draco on even more. He shook his head, which made Harry growl. The sound sent a shiver down Draco’s back.
Harry spent Thursday and Friday afternoon in a foggy state. His mind, once again, was everywhere and nowhere at the same time; he felt lost. He had loved Ginny for some time, he knew that. But it was the first time he was letting himself think about how he felt about Malfoy. How he really felt. Kissing Ginny felt like nothing compared to Draco- who made sparks fly. He couldn’t leave Ginny, not after everything that had happened, and was was expected of them. Besides, it’s not as if he could come out even if he wanted to. The wizarding world was still very prejudiced, and Harry didn’t feel that they could accept a queer golden boy, as it would make him seem a whole lot less golden.
He’d been back to Draco’s flat everyday waiting for him to turn up, but to no avail. He’d been to every house he could think of that Draco’s family owned or still own, he’d stalked both Blaise and Pansy but had had no luck.
Harry in turn grabbed Draco by his wrists and turned him back to face him, leaving the next tears to role freely down the Slytherins face.
The library was quiet when the trio settled down at one of the big oak tables. Harry sighed as he finally finished his potions essay. There were at least 10 spelling mistakes and half of it was complete shit, but he didn’t care. Hermione and Ron both looked up at him when he started packing up. “I can’t concentrate on anymore homework, guys, so I’m just going to go to bed” Ron nodded and Hermione looked at him pitifully but nodded anyway. “Before you go Harry, if you see Pansy in the common room could you give her this?” She handed him a book that seemed to be written in a different language. “Why can’t you give it to her?” The girls were now roommates, and surprisingly, friends.
he was. He knew that night he’d dream of nothing but his blonde, then he’d have to tell his Draco what he had done.
He’d just sunk down onto the sofa and switched on the television when his floo fired up, and in stepped the unkempt wizard he’d just been trying not to think about.
Draco’s breath hitched, not looking up at the Auror. He felt a flush spread up his neck, because of course he remembered how it felt.
“Mr Potter, thank you for agreeing to see me.” He nodded and shook her hand. “It’s the least I could do” he said before sitting down across from her. It felt weird being near her in such a casual setting- last time they’d been this close she’d pronounced him dead.
Then, the summer had come to an end and Harry had told him very awkwardly about getting back together with Ginny. “I want to try and make it work, Draco” he’d stiffened up and gathered his things, feeling stupid for thinking Potter would ever choose him. “I see. Have fun, Potter.” And with that he’d left and ignored Harry for the 3 days before September first. He’d been so angry he’d blocked Harry from the floo and all the wards, yet Harry had kept trying to get in.
“There is not enough cock in me right now and too many clothes on, so hurry up” Harry chuckled at his bossy lovers demands. “You’re such a fucking brat” he growled as he spelled both of their clothes off. “Your brat, Daddy”
“Brilliant to see you mate!” Exclaimed Ron as he pulled Draco into a manly hug. “Likewise, it’s been too long” replied Draco with a genuine smile.
” She wrapped her arms around his neck as Madame Pomfrey tutted, but left them to it. Ron was next to grasp him in a bear hug, filled with the love he’d felt so many times from Molly. “Mate, you were terrifying back there.” He said with concern. Harry looked away. “It comes over me sometimes. I just couldn’t stop.” His friends looked at him sympathetically and patted his shoulders as Pansy pulled back his curtain.
“I want you to fuck me, fuck me until all I can remember is your name, please, Daddy” Draco’s words wavered as he felt Harry shift his legs, he lifted them onto his shoulders and he murmured the charm that filled Draco’s entrance with slick.
“I really want to have sex with you right now.” Harry grinned, raising his own eyebrow in what Draco could only conclude was Harry’s attempt at looking sexy. “Ugh, you’re getting a vasectomy. That’s final. I refuse to have the children of a man that would wake me up for something so mundane.” Harry scrambled up to pull a fleeing Draco back into his arms, kissing at his neck.
It seemed like hed been dodging people all day. He could hear the school whispering about him,a few people in his year tried to approach him at lunch, but he darted out of the great hall before they could properly accost him. He just wanted to talk to Draco. Instead, he walked right into his girlfriend. “Harry, I want to talk to you.” Her eyes were a mixture of concern and fear, but he couldn’t face her right now. “I’m sorry, Gin. But not now. It’s not a good time” He scurried into the 8th year common room and up the stairs into his room, so no one else could bother him. He was meant to go and see Professor McGonagall, but he was in a constant state of panic and talking to people made him feel exposed and vulnerable. At least 3 people knew about he and Draco. He was well and truly fucked.
Harry fell down against the wall as he watched his friend walk away. He wished he could be what Draco wanted him to be, needed him to be. He wished he could love him the right way.
“Alright, alright!” They both laughed before Draco gasped as harry pulled his fingers out of him. Harry moves them up to Draco’s face, hovering them over his lips. He raised his eyebrow before letting out a deep moan as Draco sucked his fingers into his mouth. “God you’re so gorgeous baby.” Draco smiled at him and pulled Harry’s face down and kissed him dirtily.
Draco shook his head. “I’d prefer to stand, we need to get this over-ah!” Draco shouted out as he was spelled into his seat. He glared at Harry who just continued to smile.
“I want to be there too, you and Blaise will have such beautiful children I’m sure of it”. Said Narcissa. Hermione and Pansy were both cooing over Draco’s belly, willing the child to come out.
Watching Draco come whilst shouting Harry’s name was the most magnificent thing he’d ever seen. He’d walked into the room but Draco hadn’t noticed him as he was so lost in himself- and harry was mesmerised. He could feel his erection growing as he sprinted over to the bed to pounce on his unsuspecting lover.
They finally got to the common room and Harry raced towards the staircase, but the whiskey was taking its toll and he had to slow down. “Potter, are you
Harry narrowed his eyes at the blonde, both of them still fully naked. It was surreal that they were having this conversation when Draco could literally feel cum oozing out of his arsehole.
Then one day Draco just, stopped talking to him. It’d been 4 days and Harry couldn’t bear not knowing what he’d done wrong, and how he’d ruined their friendship.
Harry had no idea what to say. Thirty seconds of silence went by between them before Draco finally opened his eyes and looked at him, his face seemed so empty now as if the spark in him had been stamped out.
Draco turned over into his back and watched at Harry lifted his backside on to a pillow. “You’re so tight and gorgeous beautiful, even though you’re old now”. Harry chuckled. Draco pretended to be offended and and slapped the back of Harry’s head. “Less talking, more-“
The heat was unbearable. Draco couldn’t stop moving, he’d already kicked away the sheets and managed to remove himself from Harry’s ridiculous grip, but try as he might he could not sleep. It didn’t help that Harry would NOT stop snoring in what looked to be a very peaceful slumber.
“Wait, what? How could you produce an heir?” Draco rolled his eyes. “For heavens sake Potter, don’t tell me you didn’t know gay wizards can have babies? Because we can, quite easily with the help of a few potions.” Harry just stared down at him. “I didn’t mean, um, not us per se since youre not gay or whatever.” Harry had been imagining his children with Draco, what they’d look like. How happy the could beohgod he was choking up, he had to turn away from Draco who took this opportunity to escape and have another swig of firewhisky. “However, I won’t be able to successfully marry into one of these rich piggy families, because I’m so in love with you that I could never be happy! I’ve had feelings for you since that day in Madam Malkin’s, did you know that? My first wank was over you! And now with this bloody heart condition loving you is harder than ever’. His voice cracked over his words and he had to lean against the balcony to support himself. Harry got as close as he dared, what was he meant to do? “Draco, I-“
“Yes. I do. I love you so much, Harry”. Draco pulled him down into a kiss, Harry wrapped his arms around him carefully.
“Shit! Are you okay?” Draco couldn’t help but giggle at Harry’s concern. “Help meeeeee!” He giggles again as Harry sighed, and pulled Draco up onto his chest.
“You can’t keep turning up at my place and then falling asleep before we actually have sex every time he hurts your feelings” Blaise said almost cattily.
Draco was pacing around their living room frantically, having absolutely no clue what he’d tell Harry when he got home in- oh god, 20 minutes.
Harry made his way over to the fire place and had lent to reach for some floo powder when Draco spoke again.
Harry turned back to Draco, his expression softened. “Draco,” The blond shook his head and rushed himself into Harry’s arms, wrapping his own around Harry’s neck and reaching up to kiss the taller man, shutting his eyes tightly as the sparks ran through them. They heard gasps and cheers from the crowd, and then a round of applause.
“I’m taking you back to bed. You need to sleep.” Draco started to protest but could do nothing but settle in Harry arms as he hoisted him over his shoulder.
“Oh do hush its not important. Now, listen to this. Saviour Throws Magical Tantrum, is the ex death eater rubbing off on him? My my Potter, you really have been trying hard to stay out of the public eye!”
” He started to shout but a hand clasped over his mouth and he felt his eyes start to close once again. “
“Put a smile on and get rid of that ugly scowl, you bloody brat. You are lucky to be here, that anyone wants you, got it?” Draco’s nod caused a cruel grin to form on Justin’s face.
Harry was wearing tight navy trousers, with an even tighter blue shirt that looked like it would tear if he moved too much. He knew he looked good, there was no point denying it. He liked working out and keeping fit so he could fuck Draco better keep up with his work better, being an auror was bloody exhausting.
Harry really couldn’t help but laugh, which seemed to only further frustrate Draco. “You think I care about “virgin purity?” I may not be a “whorehouse” like you, but I myself am no virgin”.
He cast a scourgify over yesterday’s clothes and pulled them on, before walking into the kitchen to pour himself a drink. He felt to sick to eat anything.
“Your wing, is it alright?” Was all he could think to say. The left wing was dropping and it was obviously painful to move. “It’s broken, probably. They’ll know I was gone”. He sniffed and turned away from Harry.
Draco couldn’t say anything. He just stared back at Harry. The lump in his throat felt as if it would suffocate him.
“Even in your sixties you can turn me on, your talents are infinite”. Smirked Harry. They linked arms again before heading into the ballroom.
“It’s over, Malfoy, come on!” Harry yelled, still not looking at him. Draco looked away with tears in his eyes and noticed Harry had fixed all of the plates.
“Draco, look at me”. Harry whispered. Draco shook his head, he couldn’t bear to. “Draco, please, look at me”. He opened his eyes, the teary grey pleaded with the sharp green that were staring back at him. He couldn’t help it, as much as his brain was screaming at him to run away, his heart couldn’t contain itself- being so close to the man he loved.
He noticed a mug he’d bought for Harry in the top of one of the boxes he was holding. On the side of it it read “worlds best kisser”, a joke between the two of them. Draco had a matching one still in the cupboard.
“40 years later and I still can’t get used to that” laughed Hermione as she kissed Harry on the cheek before hugging him, her grey curls bouncing on his shoulder.
“Obviously I made a mistake getting back together with Ginny. The guy I’d been seeing, wanted me to tell people we were together, and I got scared, so I said no, and I said some pretty hurtful other things too, and I ended it”.
The arms pushed him up against the wall and his attackers leg pushed between his thighs, he closed his eyes as he felt sharp stubble against his neck.
Harry nodded. “Thank you, Monty. I’m going to completely discard all of your advice so we should probably change your title!”
“Potter, please” Draco’s weak voice begged, wanting nothing more than to kiss and punch the man at the same time. Harry started to kiss at his neck, causing Draco to let out a moan. He felt his arms instinctively wrap around the bearded mans neck, no matter how much he told himself he didn’t want this.
“Hey! You loved it and you know it!” Draco giggles as the bigger man tickled him and pushed him. Combined with the tangled sheets around Draco, this lead to him falling off the bed with a thump onto the floor.
“I don’t want anything else but you, Daddy, not ever”. He heard Harry growl at his words, and then the tip of his cock of his cock breach his quivering hole and he screamed out in ecstasy again.
Draco, on the other hand didn’t work, well, not officially. He wrote novels under an alias that sell like wildfire, but in the public’s eyes he was just Harry’s plaything that lived off of him, however Draco didn’t mind that narrative nearly as much as people thought.
Rage simmered in Draco at the sight of it. He hadn’t even realised he’d done it until the shatter sounded as the mug hit the floor, having wandlessly flown from the top of the box.
“Hey, baby, how are you feeling now?” The voice was full of sympathy but Draco wasn’t in the mood for forgiveness. “Shit, and it’s all you fault you prick”. Harry chuckled as he came to sit on the end of the bed. He ran his hand up Draco’s side and rubbed his back in circles, which caused Draco to involuntarily sigh and turn towards Harry.
Harry was mad. Draco could tell by the way he ripped his fingers out from inside of him, and lined his cock up. “You really are a whore, you filthy little bitch. Just letting anyone take you, fine. I’m gonna fucking take you.” With that, he thrust into Draco in one go, causing the bottom to scream out in a mix of pain and pleasure.
He felt Harry spell him clean, and then two lubed up fingers breached him. “Mm Harrrrry, just fuck me already!” He begged. The menacing man finally lined up with Draco’s hole, and pushed right into his prostate. He set a brutal pace that released moans from both of them.
“I’m sorry. Just making sure you’re ok” He rolled his eyes and made sure Potter could see. He turned the note over and scribbled down his reply.
At that moment Harry strolled in for breakfast and was swept right into the arms of the female Weasley. Draco tried no to look up but couldn’t help it, and when he did he found the emerald eyes already boring into him. He couldn’t stand it. He was going to make Potter regret not choosing him.
Harry’s head turned to look at his heavily pregnant husband, and his eyes lit up. “I just want to make sure everything’s alright” he said as he strode across the room. He kissed Draco lovingly before taking their son off of Draco’s hip, cooing at him and making him laugh.
Harry forced Draco’s legs to spread wide open for him as he continued pummelling his prostate with his fingers. “Please Daddy, fuck me already!” He grabbed out for his lover, trying to pull Harry close.
He found his clothes hanging up in the laundry room, ironed and clean. There were some new underwear and shirts for him, as well as some muggle jeans. He opted for a soft grey T-shirt and the jeans, which were surprisingly comfortable. After he finished pulling on some white socks he stood up and shivered.
“i think you’ll find it was me that got into you” Draco gasped before he burst out laughing. “We should probably clean up, get dressed and that. Since, we’re meant to be working and all.” Harry considered this, looking around at their surroundings. There was a scrupulous smell of sex in the air, and semen in more places than it should be, honestly, he felt sorry for the man who was unfortunate enough to walk in on them.
For the next three days Harry barely saw Draco. They only had defence and muggle studies in common now, but Draco was clearly avoiding him. He looked good though, his skin was perfect once again and his hair was looking wonderful, which is more than Harry could say for his mess of curls. He’d tried to corner the Slytherin after class a few times but with no luck. Dinner came and went, Draco making no appearance. He noticed Hermione watching him again but he didn’t care.
Harry paced around his room for some time before deciding to go up to Draco’s room, he knew Blaise was in but he’d just have to make up an excuse as to why he needed to speak to the Slytherin. Begrudgingly he knocked on the door and was greeted by Blaise’s handsome smirk rather than Draco. “What can I do for you, Potter?” Harry shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “I need to speak to Malfoy” Blaise moves back to show him his empty dorm. “He left about half an hour ago, he’s not in a good mood. Is it anything urgent?” Harry blundered. What was he supposed to say? “He and your cousin had a fight earlier, Ginny and I were just concerned” Blaise noticeably tensed at his words. “Ah, that’s what’ll have caused it. He got a letter from his father so I suppose he’s gone to go and drink and feel sorry for himself.” Harry thanked blaise for the information and headed back downstairs.
“Your highness, I am Justin Finch Fletchley, the son of lord Fletchley and I come from the Eastern Province. I have never been touched by another man and I will my life as a bride to you”.
“I’m fine, really. Just hay fever”. The taller man just stared at him for a minute before coming to his decision- which turned out to be wrapping Draco up into quite an awkward, but comforting hug.
“I feel like a complete and utter idiot, I wish I had a time turner to go and fix everything I did to him. I feel as though some part of me is missing, as if he’s kept my heart and it’s calling out to me. But most of all, I wish, wish, wish he would come back to me”.
Harry had no idea what the noises were coming from his garden. He knew there was a storm raging, but this sounded like some sort of animal. Letting his hero complex take control, he went to see what it was.
“But you didn’t. You’re Harry Potter. If you really wanted to not do it, they wouldn’t have been able to make you”.
Their affair together had only lasted 8 months, Harry hadn’t even told Ron or Hermione about them, never mind the press.
“Not until you tell me why we aren’t friends anymore! I thought we were getting on!” Harry could see the tears edging into Draco’s eyes.
“Gwain! How did you get in?” Draco shrieked, nearly falling out of bed. Good thing he had harry there to save him.
Anyway, the whole process takes about 10 minutes, Draco was put under local anaesthetic, as two magi-doctors lifted his child out. As soon as she was brought into the world Draco’s stomach was healed up, and his womb disappeared.
