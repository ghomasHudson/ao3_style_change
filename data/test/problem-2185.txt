"I think Hermione'll just be happy for you both to have a fresh start."
"Pathetic," Lucius says smoothly, unsheathing the wand hidden within the cane, his resolve hardening. "It looks as if I'm going to have to show you what needs to be done."
"EXPELLIARMUS!"
Ron’s sigh is exasperated but gentle, “It sounds like Malfoy Manor was a barrel of laughs, then.”
"I wish you'd done that sooner." Ron grumbles. "My legs are numb!"
anyway. Unfettered of cruelty or sarcasm or to mock. This smile is something else entirely, something new to Harry.
They come to a halt and Harry dimly recognises it as the very trophy room Draco had once suggested as the location for the wizard's duel which served as a ploy to get Harry and Ron into trouble with Filch. That time seems so innocent to Harry now. Had Draco known all along that they were headed here, was it an unconscious decision or was it a reminder of the things which once felt so important in their small spheres, ignorant to what lay ahead?
"And that I'd be lost without you - "
"I wish - " Draco breaks off and shakes his head. No good wishing for history to rewrite itself, his mother had taught him that.
"Ah," Draco says, eyes turned down. "Therein lies the catch: you're Harry Potter. People would line the streets to know you. The same people who would spit at my feet."
Harry wants to wince the moment he asks. It was a knee-jerk reaction, to think Draco has only approached him in the open like this because something has gone terribly wrong. It’s evident Draco is thinking along the same lines because he shakes his head, a small quirk about his mouth that might hint at a smile if the rest of his face wasn’t so sober.
"Draco - wait - "
After the war had ended, they'd come. Reporters, ministry officials, aurors to drag his screaming father off to Azkaban. Draco and Narcissa had miraculously escaped that fate; his mother because she bore no Dark Mark and Lucius had pleaded convincingly on her behalf, and Draco because he was simply so young . Words like
If Draco were capable of regaining even a tenth of the person he used to be, he'd aggressively mime being sick over the side at Potter's disgusting integrity. How can any one person face such honest concern and that woebegone expression Potter always seems to wear around Draco and come out of it whole?
"The portrait gallery." Draco dismisses with a lazy wave of his hand, indicating to the long succession of the Malfoy line glaring down at Harry with strong distaste. "I beg of you: ignore them. They're never pleasant, not even to me."
"Sorry." Harry says sheepishly. "I won't be long."
being spoken with charming bashfulness from Draco's mouth.
"I can't just pretend that none of it happened," Draco snaps. "Black was actually innocent of the crimes he'd been accused of. I did all of those things. I was
"Um, science. Maths. A lot of running around after a football in the rain. That sort of stuff."
So this is the difference Harry had tried to place; the sheer lack of ego which Malfoy normally carries with him like a shining talisman. Instead, he's trying to achieve the impossible. He's trying to go unnoticed for the first time in his life. Of course, Harry has always made it a point to be aware of anything Malfoy is doing. He's fine-tuned to his actions on a level that would scare him if he really sat and thought about it.
She grabs his hand and squeezes it, peering back into the hall. From where they stand, they can see the bright red of Ron's hair flashing through the shifting bodies. McGonagall is seated in Dumbledore's old chair, chatting to Professor Slughorn further down the teacher's table. The stool and Sorting Hat have already been placed before the entire school and Harry doesn't envy the first year's that terrifying walk between the aisles, of stepping into a new experience. He's still nervous to be walking out there now.
Harry raises an eyebrow and sticks his hands deep inside the pockets of his jacket. "We both know that it wasn't you doing any of that."
Harry can feel Ron bristling beside him, ready to pounce at a moment’s notice.
Harry snorts inelegantly, "Sure it isn't."
Potion residue is everywhere. Hermione - through quick thinking and even quicker movements - has managed to save the bulk of it but the telltale glow around Ron's ears are enough to say that the damage has been done. The rest of the class are tittering in the background, taking Ron's ears from pink to deep scarlet in a matter of seconds.
Draco storms over to retrieve his wand, surprising Harry by dropping down onto his hands and knees to stuff one arm into the dark gap beneath the book shelf, his face obscured by the crook of his elbow.
"I'm thinking about the time I was going to murder Dumbledore in cold blood, right over there."
"No-one likes being alone, Potter. Loneliness, even as a choice, can be exhausting," Draco picks through his words with care. "I know that I can appear - appear frozen. I know that it's as if I've been hewn from ice because I'm remote. Even with my mother, I feel...distant.
Harry snorts, nearly choking on a piece of broccoli. He takes the glass of water Ginny is sliding across to him and gulps half of it down. "No complaints from me there, mate. Going through it once was enough."
Draco briefly wonders what it would cost him to refuse. On his list of Things He Would Very Much Like To Do, hugging Harry Potter scores pretty highly. On the other hand, could he possibly get through the experience without feeling so embarrassed that he'd have to hide from Potter for the rest of his life.
Ron blanches, nods curtly without saying a word. Harry knows that there is too much history between them for it to be as simple as an apology easily accepted, that he’d never ask them to pretend otherwise but it’s a start. Draco already looks less aggrieved, plainly grateful for even this much. It appears to give him courage for further conversation.
"I like to think of it more as stunningly down to earth." Harry says with a shrug, shifting his legs to create space for Draco to sit. "I'm surprised you're here and not out on the lawn pulling gnomes out of the bushes or something."
Harry feels an overwhelming surge of fondness for his ever faithful wand. "Yeah, well - how's your wand feel? Back to normal?"
"Bludger to the face." Ron explains, wincing as he readjusts his hold on the tissue. "Must've happened around the last five minutes. Dunno what that bloody beater was thinking, everyone else was at the other end of the pitch!"
Draco shoves his palm hard against Harry's chest, sending him stumbling into the wall. "I said no deal, Potter." He hisses, staring at Harry for a long minute, the sound of their mingled breathing loud in the dungeon corridor.
Draco's slouching figure comes to a sudden halt. His head snaps around. "You can't possibly do that." His voice is barely above a whisper but Harry hears the reluctant hope in the statement, that hateful acknowledgement that if anyone could achieve such a feat it would be Harry Potter.
No taking it back now, even if he wanted to. He's grown sick to his stomach holding this secret in for so long, keeping it quiet from the rest of the school and especially Potter - Potter, who doesn't appear to be surprised at Draco's confession of trying to kill their teacher.
"I - I don't really know. Does it bother you?"
Harry finds his attention slipping from the first year students and Professor Sprout as she begins to call them forth one by one. He looks around instead. He watches Hagrid attempting to sneak to his chair and knocking Madame Hooch from her seat by mistake. He watches McGonagall shift ever so slightly in the headmaster's position, as if she keenly feels the full weight of responsibility on her shoulders. His eyes skim over the faces that are still staring in adoration at him, anxious not the let his gaze linger too long on any of them.
"Alright, you've proven your point!" Hermione says, hiding her smile behind a hand. "I hope you know you're included in that
"Not really," Harry says awkwardly, scuffling the toe of his shoe against the floor. "I like to cast it when I just want to, you know, think. Feel at peace. I owe Remus - I'd owe him a lot if he - if - just
“It’s fine, Draco -” Harry begins, catching the disbelief flit across Draco’s face. “Well, okay, maybe seeing your own dead body is a bit jarring but it’s happened before, believe it or not.”
The fumes from the cauldrons had been starting to get to him anyway; they had drawn out a steady prickling at his temples, the pain spreading across his forehead until it felt like his brain was ready to explode from his skull. He'd clapped a hand over his scar out of instinct and fear, and only when he saw the look of sheer panic on Ron and Hermione's faces at this motion did he realise that the headache was not caused by lightning bolt scar at all.
Though brackets line the walls, the corridor is still uncommonly gloomy and dark, the stone walls tinged green and glistening with slime. It's light enough to fully display the hostility on Draco's face when he turns to see Harry running after him.
"I had no idea if I could do it..." Draco murmurs, more to himself than for Harry's ears. His eyes are prickling but he doesn't rub at them, he knows that it'll just draw more tears.
"Hermione, I don't know if it's slipped your notice but me and Malfoy aren't exactly best buddies."
"Then there's me." Harry shrugs. "Just me as
"Oh, for the love of god." Harry moves abruptly so that he's within touching distance of Draco, holding the wand still in his hand out once more in defiance. If Draco thinks that Harry will play along with this charade, he's sorely mistaken. "You don't scare me, Malfoy."
Draco nods, still marvelling over the scarf.
"Fine. Let's try it your way, Potter." he doesn't look back as he says this, carelessly dropping the words behind him for Harry to collect if he so wishes to.
"I've heard that there's a custom when two people meet beneath mistletoe. I suppose it's slightly ironic that muggles also used to use it as a way to ward off witches..."
" Ron says in satisfaction, celebrating by dumping custard on his apple pie while Hermione silently glowers beside him.
"I'm just trying to engage! You're always banging on about me needing to engage with people, take them into consideration or whatever it was you said."

"Why wouldn't I be?"
Worked hard to get this up on my boy's birthday! Happy birthday, Harry, you absolute lad.
"Harry, you were
"Really?" Hermione says when he's finished, sitting up straighter with interest, Crookshanks squirming in annoyance at the movement. Harry can practically hear the cogs in her head clunking into action. "A boggart?"
"I know what you meant, Ron." Hermione bristles, eyes bright. She hastily wipes the back of mittened hands against her cheeks, allowing the wind to whip her corkscrew curls into her face. "I already explained to you that I need to be with my parents this Christmas. It was hard coming back to school but they understand that I have to do this. I thought that maybe after everything, you'd support me too."
If Draco had given Harry time to brace for the attack, it still wouldn't have been enough to prepare him for the force of the spell that strikes him squarely in the chest. It lifts him clean off his feet. His whole body skitters across the floor, coming to an ungraceful stop when he collides with the teacher's desk, the tower of sandwiches threatening to collapse over him. Across the room, Draco neatly catches the spiralling wand with his already outstretched hand, as pleased as his marble face will allow him to look.
Draco’s expression shutters. "Potter. You can’t say things like that." he insists, voice wavering.
"I'm sorry, Harry."
His hand pauses against the door handle, "Potter, before we go in..."
Ron comes up between Harry and Hermione, slinging each arm around their shoulders. "A word alone with Slughorn? I'd almost feel sorry for him if he weren't the world's biggest prat."
They both glance out of the window then, watching the rain patter against glass. Harry finds himself longing for the snow back at Hogwarts, for some sort of Christmas cheer in this miserable place...
"Do you?" Harry demands, suddenly breathless at the possibility of Draco acknowledging his attentions instead of sidestepping them.
"I suppose this means we're dating now." Draco says when they break apart, face flushed pink. "I have one question; can I be the one to tell Weasley?"
It doesn't feel right having told Hermione and Ron about Draco's boggart, especially to be discussing it so flippantly; it feels like a gross intrusion of privacy. Harry knows they're his friends - that they would do almost anything for him - but letting them in on Draco's secret savours too much of a betrayal. He doesn't owe Malfoy anything so why does he feel like this?
They all sit like that, a human paper chain of grief and pain and regret, heedless of the other Gryffindors milling about around them. No one bothers them, no one ever does. Here in Gryffindor Tower, they never even have to ask. They're the golden trio, what they went through is widely speculated but never spoken, and everyone in the common room often wonders in the privacy of their own heads or in muted questions to their friends but never aloud to the three of them. Something like that can never be put into words.
I was doing them and I knew it was wrong but I did it anyway. It - it wouldn't be fair to anyone for me to turn a blind eye to that. It would make me just as guilty as I was then."
"Thank you, Ploddy. Can you make sure Potter here has everything he needs while I'm gone?" Draco says formally, turning to Harry as Ploddy bows deeply, nose brushing the floor. "I shan't be too long. Do try to keep out of trouble, if that's at all possible for you."
The Map springs to life, clusters of sleeping dots gathered in dormitories and offices materialising like spilt splotches of ink. Harry can't deny it, the dream has spooked him. He peruses the Map, watching for any signs of movement, irrationally looking out for the names of Death Eaters out of sheer paranoia.
"What's the difference?"
" the Fat Lady cries after him in indignation.
"What are you - "
"After the Dark Lord returned, his erratic nature accelerated. Now, I needed to become a Death Eater and fix the impossible and - and kill

toward
"I wasn't going to say that." Harry tells him, aghast, moving closer so that they're almost shoulder to shoulder at the railing. "I just think that it's pretty sad for you, being left alone like that. You're respecting her wishes but who's looking after yours?"
It was a cruel brag, what Voldemort had hoped would be the final word on Harry Potter’s life. It had been a necessity to play along, to let all who he cared for believe he had truly been killed. To see it here makes him feel as if he is untethered from his body, witnessing what they had, the surreal horror of it.
Harry grins, pulling himself up into a sitting position. The copy of Seeker Weekly has slipped down the side of the bed somewhere but Harry doesn't care; his day is about to become far more interesting than an outdated Player of the Month feature.
"It's an unfortunate side effect of being me, I guess. Is it - is it too much for you?"
"Tell me, is this how you vanquished the Dark Lord? A bunch of shoddy guesswork and dumb luck?"
Draco blinks. "Well, I was never a team player." he offers unexpectedly, standing in one smooth motion. He flings his bag over his shoulder, his hurried farewell normally without a spoken word of goodbye. This time, Draco pauses and looks at Harry without so much as a sneer, the fingertips of one hand pressed lightly to the surface of the desk. His expression is almost wistful. "I suppose I do miss the flying itself."

stuck dealing with it."
The fury in Hermione wavers ever so slightly when Ron says nothing. For the first time in as long as Harry can remember, Ron is holding back - something he isn't prone to doing when it comes to Hermione. He's always been ready to tease her, to defend her, to rile up and calm down and talk her away from working herself to death.
"Would you just - look, let's just try and guess our way in. It's worked for me before now."
Draco stops, turning back so that his gaze falls across Harry on the bed. Without any preamble, Draco extends his arm to slide a smooth palm along Harry's cheek, his thumb tracing the edge of Harry's cheekbone, fingertips lightly tickling the shell of his ear and into the fringes of his hair. The way Draco is
than okay?"
Harry recognises their routine enough to despise it. They secretly work on the boggart together and then Harry returns to Ron and Hermione while Draco slinks away to his quiet dormitory and the company of himself,
Their journey progresses faster with Hermione in front, even with new snowflakes falling heavier than before. By the time they reach the cover of the rickety bridge, all three of them are dusted over with white and shuddering in heavy, damp clothes, the path Hermione had forged already lost beneath a fresh blanket of snow.
With the three of them gone, it's only going to be Harry and Ron in their dormitory this year. Harry watches Malfoy smooth out the front of his robes at the Slytherin table across from them and wonders what his prospects of sharing dormitories will be like - if anyone will even be
“Who?”
to be a Malfoy."
"Potter, it's like this at my mother's insistence. We let go of the rest of the staff because - " Draco cuts himself off, glancing at Harry with uncertainty.
"Maybe if you applied yourself - "
Harry is first to break the silence, as he knew he would be.
"Muggles make do without magic in these situations all the time." Hermione points out, adjusting the purple bobble hat - one of her better attempts from the S.P.E.W. days - on her head. Harry, despite Ron's gentle ribbing, is wearing a matching one in dark green. "They'd have to shovel their way through this."
Things hadn't worked out with Ginny but he wishes they had. He tries out a small smile for her as he takes his seat and is relieved to receive one in return.
"Mental." Ron settles on, exchanging glances with Hermione. "Absolutely mental."
"Am I the only one who thinks it's weird that if he's been this scared of his dad, why was he always threatening to grass everyone up to him?" Ron pushes back his wet hair with both hands, until it's slicked smooth and flat against his head - until it resembles the way Draco wears his hair. Harry gets a sinking feeling in his gut, anticipating Ron's actions and he can feel Hermione's hand balling into a tight fist at his knee, knowing that she's reaching the same conclusions.
When Draco remains silent, Harry assumes Draco has said all he wishes to on the matter and pushes on.
Against his own wishes, his body betrays him and draws him in. With a rusty creak, the gate swings open under Harry's light touch.
"Potter has always been a sore spot, from the very first moment he rejected you. I should have expected as much from you, unable to attract even the attention of someone as worthless as a mudblood loving half-blood."
"You know me." Harry shrugs, grinning, revelling in the ease of their banter. "I like a quiet life."
"I don't know what to do anymore," Harry admits. He heaves a sigh, lacing fingers behind his head so he can tip back and stare miserably at the ceiling. "Everything is just a mess."
Draco remains silent.
"And that I think everything you do is wonderful. Look, if you think it's a good idea, I say go for it. This lot could benefit from an extra bit of studying."
"Good."
"You'll be sure to pass my regards onto Weasley, won't you? I'm positive that will brighten his Christmas." Draco teases, tucking his feet beneath himself neatly.
“It made me feel loved. Wanted,” Harry admits, face scrunching. “That’s weird, isn’t it? It’s definitely weird.”
It seems as if he's always going to be chasing after Draco in one way or another, Harry reckons as he dashes down the steps and outside into the grey day. Will he always be looking out for the glint of blonde hair in the darkness, listening out for fading footsteps that seem to persistently evade him? Pinning down Draco is like trying to hold onto starlight but Harry is quite unable to keep himself from attempting it.
Lucius Malfoy falters the second his eyes land on Harry, taking a step closer but he doesn't fire any spells. Every muscle in Harry's body is straining against the confines of his skin, waiting for the opportunity to spring into action. Harry has bested Lucius before, he can do it again.
“Draco? Is everything okay?”
Harry can’t help the quiet gasp that escapes his mouth. He can’t help the plunging, ice cold shock of it as he stares down at a version of
"AND I HAVE THE SCAR TO PROVE IT! I got what I deserved!" Draco yells, scarcely caring about the rest of the school winding down for the evening in their common rooms or the prefects that may be patrolling nearby. Draco reaches to pull up the sleeve of his shirt, revealing an expanse of stark white flesh and then, there: the Dark Mark emblazoned on his skin forever. Draco's eyes lift to seek out the lightning bolt scar snaking out from beneath Harry's hair, his gaze as physical as a touch from a finger. "You have yours and I have mine, never forget that. You're not the only one he marked."
It isn't a demand, it's an opportunity for him to slip away to the common room if he wanted to. He stares at his friend, at the concern in her brown eyes and the way she's twisting a curl around and around her finger, to the well deserved Head Girl pin secured neatly into the folds of her school robes. He knows that she's just as scared as he is - Ron, too - and finds a genuine smile tentatively creeping onto his face. Smiles have been hard to come by, these days.
"I couldn't sleep, I decided to take a walk." Harry says coolly, not about to bring up the Marauder's Map. "I heard a noise and came to see what it was."
He looks across and sees Hermione peering around the doors of the Great Hall, the sound of low chattering spilling out with the warmth from behind her. Torch light from the bracket mounted on the wall casts a golden glow across her dark skin, orange wisps rippling through every curl in her hair when she steps closer.
"Heads up, Potter."
"Maybe you Slytherins should learn to calm down a bit." Harry breathes, pulling at Draco's chin to press a clumsy kiss to the sharp lines of his mouth, feeling them turn pliant and willing at Harry's touch.
"Yours?"
"That's how I won yours." Harry points out, failing to see how Draco could need the reminder of that day in Malfoy Manor.
flying. I miss the simplicity of it. Flying for me was always more than just the match, it was - it was about being free. I've spent so long always stuck in one cupboard - one room -
“The whole house felt like a tomb.” Harry says, chewing on the piece of slightly charred bread he’d toasted over the fire. “I don’t know how Draco stands it.”
"See you around."
Harry reckons his best chance of catching Malfoy is just after dinner, where he's prone to slip away before pudding arrives so that he can beat the rest of the school out of the hall while they're distracted. It's not exactly the best plan, he highly doubts Draco will be thrilled at being cornered but he has no other choice - the boy just can't be found alone throughout the rest of the day.
"STOP!" Harry leaps out from behind his cover, not for a second thinking about the fact he's rushing to
Anyway, thank you to those who have subscribed, left kudos, bookmarked this, and for commenting. Many of you have honestly been very kind. Lots of love x
Draco seems to have recovered marginally; gone is the expression of tender bewilderment, now he traces a finger around the rim of the mug, affecting a nonchalance too practised to convince Harry. He's been caught off guard, Harry knows it.
Every corridor bears garlands nestling twinkling fairies and shiny holly berries, wreaths hang from every classroom door, piles of Christmas crackers two feet tall sit like small mountains on the tables. The suits of armour had even proffered candy canes to students until Peeves tampered with them and caused them to launch the sweets at anyone passing by, sharp striped missiles cheerfully ricocheting off walls, bags and unlucky heads. It became so bad that students and teachers alike began avoiding those particular corridors altogether, too wrapped up in the Christmas spirit to do anything about it.
"My mother. She's...she's not very fond of visitors. She's aware you're here, of course, I would never dream of intercepting her privacy like that but - but the parlour is the one room she respectfully requests you keep your distance from." Draco explains, eyes downcast. His chest heaves as if his body is loathe to reveal any more of his family life. He coughs out the next words regardless. "It's always been her place, it's where she feels most at peace."
"Don't bother, Potter. The last thing I need is you getting a complex right now."

"Oh, it's nice that you're giving me permission!"
to find ruin wherever he goes, had buried itself in his brain like a seed years ago and finally bloomed into something incapacitating after Voldemort's death. The reason for his sleepless nights, the nightmares, the lingering trepidation that flares up if he's left to his thoughts long enough. The cruel irony that he should be always looking over his shoulder now that danger is behind him.
and yet here he was, howling like Draco was even worthy of seeing him this way after everything he'd put him through over the years.
It's no guarantee but it's the only thing Harry can think of to entice Draco into the offer.
, a menace who had blagged his way through school due to the influence of his infamous father. His trial had been reported in minute detail, barely a day went by where his name was not printed side by side with Harry's. Comparisons between the glaring differences in their traits had been continuously made, none of them in Malfoy's favour.
Draco doesn't say another word, instead gently resting his hand on Harry's right shoulder as if in an embrace, applying the barest amount of pressure that sends Harry's stomach into a flip until the sudden, unexpected Apparition forces it into a tailspin.
"Do I need a reason?" Draco shouts over his shoulder, assuming Harry will comply and follow.
"Hug?"
"Don't." Harry snaps, temper flaring. "Don't do that. You don't know what he's been through."
Thrown by the question, Harry nods. "Uh, yeah. You’ve mentioned that to me before but what's that got to - "
"Why didn't you try out for the team again this year?"
The stunned silence that follows is an exceptionally awkward one.
"Yes - thank you - tell mother I'll be there shortly."
Draco's face flashes from shock to confusion to anger in a manner of seconds, "P-Potter?"
"I shudder, Potter, at such breathtaking incivility."
, and Harry can't help but notice the anxious twitches spasming through Draco's taut body on the occasions where they overhear the gossiping drifting from the train.
"Hmm, yes - hmm. Ron, my mistake." Slughorn blunders, looking mildly embarrassed. "Ah, and Harry? Tell Mr. Filch to bring that mop of his, will you? I rather believe we're going to need it."
Draco's buoyancy leech away.
Harry had worried that Draco might not want to continue after their disastrous first lesson but he'd shown up for the next one his usual thorny self but without another word about it. In fact, they haven't spoken about Lucius again at all, the only change in their routine is that Draco has approached these lessons freshly invigorated. Airing his feelings towards his father has helped some, has pushed him into finding deeper pools of determination he didn't think himself capable of. He's made headway with confronting the boggart but he can never seem to push back hard enough. In the end, the boggart always gets the better of him.
Outside of the Muggle Studies classroom, Harry sees nothing untoward, testing the handle to find that Malfoy had the foresight to lock the door behind him. It's easy to sneak through with a whispered
"Ron - "
"I dunno," he says awkwardly, glancing towards the window. Chunks of hail are hammering down on the pane of glass and he briefly sympathises with how miserable the conditions are for playing Quidditch. Even in spite of it, he tampers down the yearning ache in his heart for the thought of wind biting at his cheeks and cold rain creeping down his neck, the flash of a golden snitch inches from his outstretched fingers. "Ginny is a great captain, she knows her stuff. She motivates the team, her strategies are well thought out, everyone loves her. She has the makings of becoming an incredible professional player some day."
"I had no idea - I didn't think it was like that for you!"
"Sorry," Draco says gleefully, not sounding the least bit sorry at all. "I suppose years of pent up frustration and the chance at a rare opportunity does that to one's Disarming spell, even with a borrowed wand. I'll remind you that you did ask for it, Potter."
"There's not much to see," Draco says, his voice sounding as if he's speaking through a distorted microphone. "The Ministry confiscated most of our possessions after my father's arrest. They seemed to think it reasonable to test everything on the chance they may find dark artefacts - oh, I've no doubt they found something to justify their search but I can't begin to imagine what they think we'd have done to turn a set of antique silver spoons lethal." he adds upon seeing Harry's sceptical expression.
"What d'you mean?" Harry says quickly, letting Ron help him to his feet.
It had been difficult getting Malfoy to accompany him to see McGonagall but it was a necessity; Harry had dropped a note in Draco's porridge that morning detailing the plan, only to be tracked down and whispered furiously at by Draco in the boy's bathroom about secrecy and boundaries. It had taken the entire fifteen minute break before the bell rang again for lessons to convince Draco that it would only work if the both of them showed an amicable front to McGonagall or the deal would be off.
Draco comes to full attention, his voice sharp enough to cut air. A glance over in his direction informs Harry that he's stopped finding the ceiling so interesting and has turned all his efforts onto Harry instead.
"Talk?"
Harry takes the wand from the desk, feeling Draco's hungry eyes eating up the transaction. Harry tests the weight of it in his hand, feeling far more comfortable with it than he anticipates. He and this wand still share a bond, it feels at home in his grasp. Harry looks up at Draco's envious face and knows they're both aware of this intimate connection between them.
"I just thought that by now you'd have learnt how to take proper notes. I think this is a lesson long overdue for you, Ronald."
“So I suppose this means that you’ll start getting your work done early more often?” Hermione suggests witheringly, brows knitting together over a particularly stubborn spot.
"You - you probably shouldn't have seen that." Draco says, sounding stricken. He struggles to regain his composure, rounding on Harry in a fluster. "Don't say a word, Potter, or I swear on Merlin that I'll Obliviate you."
Malfoy turns and looks down on the short, bald wizard with faint surprise but he doesn't cast the expected withering glare which Harry has grown accustomed to seeing. There is no smarmy comment for the benefit of his friends - there are no friends around him to hear such a joke. He simply bows his head and slinks after Slughorn.
"She might." Harry says coolly. "You have to stick to it though. I'm not doing it if you decide it's not worth your time."
Draco leads Harry up the staircase, thickly and luxuriously carpeted but clearly in need of a clean. Draco picks up on the object of Harry's attention, naturally.
say yes?" he breathes, grey eyes jumping between Harry's. Harry can probably count every small freckle on Draco's cheekbones if he was inclined to do so.
When it happens, it's softer than Draco expects. Harry doesn't hug him like he's trying to squeeze their two bodies into a single entity the way his mother had when the Dark Lord had situated himself inside their home, nor the fleeting press of arms that Pansy would sometimes offer in consolation in the Slytherin common room.
"Uh, sorry to interrupt but - " Harry begins, glancing about the staff room in search of the caretaker. Beyond its large circular table and several chintz armchairs, the shelves lined with tasteful clutter and outdated Witch Weekly magazines, his eyes come to land on the familiar sight of the wardrobe they'd encountered in third year during Remus's lesson on boggarts.
"How are you, Harry?"
"What? No - no. He's just struggling to overcome his fear, he can never get past the image of his dad."
"So tell me; is that adequate enough information for you? Are you satisfied with the root of my fear so that we may continue henceforth without you accusing me of holding back? Now run along to your common room, Gryffindor. I'd hate for you to be stuck out here with the like of me."
"Is that who I am to you? Someone helpless?"
"I imagine it's going to be an interesting year ahead of us, don't you think?" Hermione asks, turning to Harry.
He's grown immensely tired of the charade. To Harry, it's as if it sets them back three months. It treats the boggart lessons as just that, just a temporary arrangement even though for a while now, Harry has started to hope for something more, something like friendship. He hasn't an ounce of resentment left towards Draco and this union of convenience has become redundant to him. Of course he still wants to
"It's a step in the right direction," Harry says firmly, pulling out a couple of chocolate frogs from his backpack. He lightly tosses one to Draco, who scrambles to catch it. "Here, eat this. I know it's not the same effect that dementors cause but you're pushing yourself, you deserve it."
Harry pulls a face. Draco's quiet jibes sting no matter how prepared he is for them. "Don't call me that."
If there's one thing that Ron is brilliant at - besides chess and loyalty, of course - it's his ability to absolutely
"Blasted students, always making messes." Filch wheezes, slamming his mug down onto the table, its thick brown contents spilling out across the surface. Harry has to dive out of the way to stop Filch from barreling right into him. "Come, my sweet. There's work to be done..."
“Yes, well…” Draco says pointedly, surprising everyone by tentatively turning toward Hermione. All humour has drained from him as he stares across the table to her. “Granger?”
"Oh - uh - cheers, Ploddy." Harry says sheepishly, reaching down to shake the house-elf's full hands as best as he can. "It's really good to meet you, too."
There's a heady break between their words, a moment where they stare at each other from across the dungeon, Draco framed by the soft glow trickling down the stairway, his shadow stretching across to the edge of the pool of light at Harry's feet - and Harry can see everything Draco is feeling because though he tries his best, he can never conceal his emotions entirely.
to study during the evening. People just want to relax." Ron counters, brandishing a spoon at her and splattering excess milk onto Harry's face. "Not everyone is as dedicated as you."
A solid trunk, undoubtedly containing the boggart, awaits rather ominously at the front of the classroom.
"What's that?"
" Hermione gasps, eyes as wide as saucers.
"One more thing..." Harry reaches behind him and beneath his pillow, and draws out a wand. 10". Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Draco's wand. "I figured after everything, you deserve this back permanently. Just, uh, do me a favour and don't mention this to McGonagall or she'll kill me. Happy Christmas, Draco."
Even after a year since looking upon it and especially this close, the Manor doesn't look homely. It's hard to imagine Draco feeling safe here at all; the way he's gazing at the heavy doors calls to Harry's mind the exact emotions he had felt returning to Privet Drive every summer. Had Draco ever loved this place? His expression suggests no.
Draco finishes meticulously folding his cloak and rests it on top of the nearest desk. When he turns back, he stares down at the juddering latch of the trunk, the look on his face close to tamped down trepidation.
"Ron - " Hermione says sharply, the warning in her voice going unheard.
They lapse into a silence - not comfortable by any means but endurable. For a few minutes, the only sound in the world is the distant rustling of leaves from the Forbidden Forest as a gale blusters between the trees. It gives Draco the chance to sort through his brain, to process the knowledge that Potter at least thinks he has a chance at redemption.
"Are you listening, Harry?"
"You didn't," Harry says. "Choose the easy road, I mean."
Draco takes an unconscious step forward but Harry doesn't react to it, entirely unthreatened by Malfoy. The both of them realise Draco's position in that instant, Draco's cheeks shifting to pink. "How did you find me?!"
Lucius's voice comes soft but undeniably piercing into the quiet room. Harry shudders at the sound, flinching against the memory of that voice goading him, demanding he hand over the prophecy at the Ministry.
"I suppose it's instinctual after the year I've gone through." he says, offering the ghost of a smile to let Harry know order was restored.
"Because I know you," Harry says with confidence, tipping his head back against the wall so that he can match Draco's stare with ease. He surveys him beneath heavy lids, rather enjoying the slow flush of red creeping into Draco's complexion, the twitch in his jaw that lets Harry know he is right. "I know how badly you want your wand back. I know that whatever is going on, you're desperate to beat that boggart and at the moment, that's more important to you than hating me."
Lots of love x
Draco doesn't say anything, the only acknowledgement to Harry's words is a muscle jumping along his jaw. Harry decides not to press the issue, instead marvelling at the long gallery they've entered into, unnaturally bright with its wide windows allowing daylight to spill in when compared to the rest of the Manor thus far.
" Hermione scolds, mortified. She looks between Harry and Ron in a panic, her voice high. "I didn't say it like that, Harry!"
"Dumbledore was already dying. It was all arranged with Snape, it was always going to end that way. What do you want me to say? That I'm mad at you for trying to stay alive? That you did what you had to do to keep you and your family safe? If you're looking for someone to shout at you and scream and tell you that you're an awful person, it's not me because I was doing all of those things but on my side of the war. I forgave you a long time ago, Draco. It wasn't your fault."
Harry presses an ear against the wood, listening intently to the low murmuring coming from within. He consults the Map, seeing that Malfoy is bizarrely still alone but talking to himself, and carefully cracks the door ajar to allow a slither of space for him to observe from.
Draco flinches at the name but otherwise ignores the mention of the Dark Lord, "When has Saint Potter ever made mistakes?"
"Ron! Fears are deeply personal. Maybe Draco doesn't want the information broadcast. It's supposed to be between him and Harry."
"Let me ask you something," Draco says suddenly, lacking the courage to turn and look Harry in the eyes. He supposes that's why he's in Slytherin and Potter wound up a Gryffindor, perhaps confronting people and looking at them is just one of those brave things Gryffindors do. Potter is always staring into his face like he's trying to pull out Draco's soul from his eyes. "Why are you so nice to me?"
"Potter, this is ridiculous." he says, not for the first time.
with the wand. Consider this a trust exercise; I want to know what times you are thinking of conducting these lessons and in exchange, I'll do my best to provide you with an empty classroom so that you remain undisturbed. I want to be updated with your progress and if I feel that either of you are even remotely shirking on your side of the bargain, no more boggart lessons. "
"You are willing to devote free time in helping Mr. Malfoy, Potter?"
"Yeah - and guess who it took the shape of? His dad."
"I'll - just - my mother. " Draco stammers to Harry, growing more scarlet by the second, his moment of bravery already faded.
"I don't suppose you had time to admire the architecture the last time you were here." Draco tells him pointedly, letting himself in through the gate. A surprise: Harry had almost anticipated servants waiting for them but there's no one else to be seen. "Anyway, don't be obtuse, Potter. Those are grotesques, not gargoyles."
When they emerge, they're at the utmost point of the tower. Dozens of telescopes are piled into the middle of the circular platform that runs the span of a swimming pool, several stools here and there ready to use for the next time students are dragged up here to analyse the stars. There's a roof, of sorts. Harry mostly thinks that this part of the tower looks as if someone came along and dropped an extravagant, giant gazebo on top of it.
owe Draco some transparency. It's not easy coming here and have Harry pull apart all the hidden histories from his brain and hold Draco's fear within his hands, completely at his mercy. He'd done it all with a grumble but he'd done it nonetheless.
"Look, I meant what I said, you know. I can leave you alone outside of the boggart lessons. I know how all of this - " Harry gestures at himself, to the wider expanse of the school beyond them and the other students hidden within. " - I know how hard it can be to take. I know that I turn everything to ash."
Harry, lost to his thoughts, jumps at the unexpected question, "Huh?"
"Here - "
Draco weighs up Harry's words and Harry can almost hear him thinking inside the silent room.
"I think it's incredibly smart of her to focus on being united." Hermione says, neatly spiralling spaghetti around her fork. "There's more to rebuilding than just stone and wood; we're rebuilding our society.  After being fractured for so long, I think starting afresh and together is the most important thing right now."
He can't help it. After the dream, he can't ignore his suspicions. Harry makes a decision, cramming the Map into his pocket and takes off through the portrait hole. Hermione definitely won't be happy with him if she finds out about this.
They play dirty and it's the most fun Harry has had in a long while. They play until the pearly clouds turn slate. Harry has no idea how long they've been outside for, he measures their time in moments; Draco's immaculate nails scraping against the back of his hand in pursuit of the apple, a desperate fumble of tearing clothes and kicked shins and bruised limbs, the whizz of the fruit streaking past his ear and into the goal, his numb fingers mistakenly yanking Draco's streaming scarf from his throat but it hardly even slows him down.
Draco bends his head, scratching at some bothersome itch or strain there at the nape of his neck, disrupting the fringes of his starlit hair. "Sometimes, it doesn't occur to me that I'm being rude until too late." Draco begins slowly. "I have to remind myself to work a little harder to be...civil towards you."
"I really don't - "
"Uh-oh," Harry says, his smirk all teeth. "Guess we're out of luck."
The boggart can’t find the gap in the hood, it seems to have stitched itself shut. It trips against the edge of the upturned trunk, falling backwards into it so that the trunk rights itself. With a wave of his wand, Harry sends the lid crashing down, the lock clicking neatly into place.
Harry wanders until his sights come to rest on a familiar passage, one that Draco had deliberately paid no heed of to spare Harry of - pain? Disgust? Terror? With measured steps, Harry takes the narrow stairway leading down toward the dungeon, passing beneath the lit brackets crackling with blue magical flames.
"It's okay. Just - just don't take the piss out of him, alright? We've all had a rough go of it this past year. I get it - I get that losing Fred - it's not fair, it's never been fair. Everyone we've lost. Don't you think we should give people a second chance if they're trying to change?"
Draco can't even bask in the glorious realisation that Harry Potter just accepted his offer of a date because he thinks he can hear a noise.
"Oh, Ron." Hermione says with a sob, reaching out to grasp his wrist.
"Are you volunteering to be bossed about then?"
"No - I - I don't - "
"I make plenty. Mistakes that have cost the lives of people I love." Harry says seriously and for a moment, all the light drains out of his face. Draco shouldn't have asked. "And I'll keep making them for the rest of my life - unless I start listening to Hermione more. You just have to accept that your choices might have consequences outside of your control. I think I'm finally starting to be okay with that."
at him makes Harry feel undone; he feels wide open; he feels translucent.
"I - " Harry doesn't seem to know where to look. In fact, it appears the only thing holding him up is the railing he's slumped against. "What - what about your mother?"
but it's okay to need
I know! I'm sorry about this taking a little longer to post! I think there are probably going to be two chapters left for this fic (originally meant to be one more after this chapter but this one would have been at least 10,000 words long so I've decided to split it.) I haven't read through this whole so fingers crossed it makes sense!
accident." Harry emphasises, dodging the playful kick swinging his way from Ron when he leaps up from his stool. Hermione is practically beaming from ear to ear, reaching across to press a hand against Harry's arm.
"It's moments like these where I really start to question why I like you."
." Harry adds when he sees she's about to argue the point. "You know I'd tell you otherwise. So what were you saying before now?"
The Slytherin is tense, one hand gripping the strap of his satchel, the other nervously wrenching at the knot of his school tie.
“She loves you.” Draco surmises, cheeks suddenly glowing pink even in the blue light as if he’s given something away about himself.
The two boys glare at each other the way they have countless times before, where threats and hexes were not only imminent but inevitable and this time, there are no teachers to stop them. Slowly though, Draco comes back into himself, taking a deliberate step back while shaking his head as if to clear the thoughts settled like dust there. Harry doesn't know what's happening until Draco starts to walk away, wand hand flexing in the absence of its weapon.
Harry pulls the hand away, grinning wildly. "Come on, we'll use the other stairway."
Harry can tell that it was once handsomely decorated but the raid by the Ministry has left much to be desired. He's thankful to at least see a four poster bed in the middle of the room, situated close enough to the window to gaze out at the expansive gardens. There isn't much else of note besides an empty wardrobe with the doors ripped off and a black lacquered and gilt desk bearing a fine china bowl filled with water and a hand towel.
The boggart doesn’t gracefully rise out of the trunk in the form of Lucius Malfoy this time, as it was previously accustomed to doing. Harry cuts a confused look to Draco for a split second, attention drawn back to the boggart as the trunk flips onto its side, the lid flinging open to expel -
"And - and I can't break out of this thing. Ron and Hermione call it my hero complex." Harry admits hesitantly. "I keep waiting for everything to come apart again - like, I can't really relax a lot of the time. I think Ginny could sense that too, she's always been able to see more than what I was giving."
. They're making important leaps in Draco's casting abilities, aren't you, Harry?"
"Yes," Draco agrees, grimacing. "Yes, I think I'm beginning to see that. You're eternally bewildering, Potter. The truth is, I
Draco tentatively takes the present, swiping his thumb over the cheerful holly print wrapping paper. When he peers back at Harry, he does so from beneath pale lashes, as if too ashamed to meet Harry's ever direct gaze head on.
doing that - "
Malfoy is fast. The ends of his robes are whipping out of sight through the passage to the dungeons just as Harry jogs out of the Great Hall. He has to take the winding steps that sink down below the castle three at a time, the temperature growing noticeably colder the lower he goes. He only catches up with Malfoy when they're in the corridor that leads to the Slytherin common room.
"You're right," Ron says earnestly. "You should be with your family."
"Oh dear," Slughorn sighs, peering across the desk to inspect the slightly smoking floor. "Ah, Harry - can you run along to the staff room and find Mr. Filch? He should have some solution for Wilson's problem."
Draco jumps to his feet, running a hand over his hair. "Right."
- who would die for us."
Coming up triumphant, Harry returns back to the bed and sees Draco staring down at Hermione's parcel in his hands.
"Let me guess, you followed him?" Ron says in exasperation, rolling his eyes. "Merlin, I thought you just needed to take a walk to clear your head or something, I didn't think you were back at it tailing Malfoy again."
, 'Mione. I swear I've done more revision this year alone than every other year added together! Come on, it's practically Christmas - good will to all men and all that."
More astonishing is the stack of records sequestered behind it, the peeling labels far too faded and weathered for Harry to make out any signifying words. Unable to resist, Harry carefully picks out one of the vinyl discs and slots it onto the gramophone, gently lowering the needle onto the spinning record with the tip of his forefinger.
"Just like that? I don't understand, Professor." Harry says, gazing at the wand as if it's a trap McGonagall has set out for them. "You just told us you couldn't give Draco his wand."
Sometimes, Harry worries that Ron still blames himself for leaving them due to the toll of the horcrux that had been hanging around his neck like a daily noose. It had bothered Harry and Hermione but its effect on Ron had sank deeper into his core, striking at the lingering insecurities he had had about feeling inferior. Harry knows Ron is past the point of jealousy - far from it - but the power that the locket had radiated may have been enough to leave a permanent scar on Ron's soul, planting a new seed of guilt and letting it fester there. Guilt for leaving. Guilt for not being able to spare Hermione from Bellatrix's ruthlessness. Guilt for Fred's death.
"I'm not like you, I can't just - I can't - it's not easy for me to say things, okay?"
Harry pushes past Ron, accepting his bag already held out for him by a resigned Hermione. "So I'll be quick then." he calls behind him, taking off into a sprint.
"What? Are we seriously playing with an apple?"
me holding your hand is."
"No offence but it's hard to imagine your dad as someone who could inspire love." Harry cuts in, remembering every encounter he's ever had with Lucius Malfoy, in the flesh or boggart.
or were you just hoping you could coast by on my notes because I'm your girlfriend?"
"The smarmy arse would never shut up about it." Ron adopts an uncanny plummy accent, reclining back ever so slightly, deploying the cocked eyebrow which Draco often favours. "Wait until my father hears about this - "
from me; to put you and those allied to you in your place. Try out for the Quidditch team - and when that failed, my position was bought with a bribe. Excel as a prefect and aim for Head Boy. I was number one in Slytherin but I always came up short next to Granger or to you - sometimes even Weasley, if you can believe it!"
"I was
“Ron’s mum,” Harry says softly, remembering. “It caught me off guard that time, too. She was embarrassed I’d seen it, thought I’d think she was silly.” For a second, Harry is back in Grimmauld Place, surrounded by Sirius, Remus and Mad Eye Moody as Molly sobbed against the wall. His heart aches all over again. “I didn’t think that at all.”
"Do you really want to know what my father was like?"
Harry may appreciate Ron's directness but it startles him regardless, "What? No, I wasn't!"
"I will, although I bet you're going to lose your mind when I do. It's completely mental - time travel and a prison break
The thought of that brings what's happening to the forefront, sinking into Harry's every pore; Draco is going to kiss him. Here. In Malfoy Manor. Harry can feel his whole body absorb that, from the thump of his heart to the very loud, very embarrassing whooshes of air huffing through his nostrils, and Harry realises how much he
Harry smiles then and Draco's cold, dead heart starts beating in a very admirable way. Perhaps a little too admirably because Draco can feel it in his throat and he thinks he might choke on all of this
Ron is unperturbed by the waves of whispers lapping around him, a resilient island against the current of gossip and awe. If his grin for Harry is warm, the one he shoots Hermione is radiant. It hurts Harry a little to witness that unadorned affection, not out of spite but of longing.
"I haven't the slightest idea of what you're referring to."
"I told you, Potter." Draco mumbles, getting to his feet, staring anywhere but at the headmistress or Harry. "I told you it would be pointless."
Draco must feel it too because he carefully extricates his hand from Harry's grasp, that all too familiar stain of pink spreading across his cheeks before he has chance to turn away.
Malfoy is kneeling in the aisle between shelves of slightly outdated Muggle appliances, a slumped figure between the narrow corridors stuffed with old toasters and ancient television sets. More surreal and disturbing is the person half concealed in the shadows before him, the unmistakable blonde hair and steel eyes turning Harry's blood to ice. Harry remembers those eyes staring back at him from the depths of a mask and is no less unnerved to see them here directed at Draco.
"Because you keep running away!"
Ron is sulking, stirring the last dregs of his shepherd's pie around on the plate, squashing peas with the back of his fork. "No! I'll have you know I've been coasting by on your notes for years now..."
they ignore each other if they see one another around school. Well...Draco makes a point of ignoring Harry's friendly wave or smile, his eyes always sliding over and past him so often that Harry figures he might as well be wearing the invisibility cloak for all the acknowledgement Draco affords him.
Harry nearly laughs at that. "What were you doing with that boggart?!"
Harry hitches his bag higher, feeling under dressed in his trainers and jeans in spite of his better judgement when they come through into the cavernous entrance hall.
"I - I try my best - " Draco whispers fearfully to the boggart, face taut. A muscle jumps in his jaw and he's eyeing the door like he's deciding whether it will be worth bolting for.
He'd not stopped to think about how Draco prefers to be addressed. It's always been Malfoy because to call him anything other would have felt too...intimate, too personal. He hadn't even been aware of when he'd started to switch to using his first name, except that the way it trips off his tongue now is entirely too natural that he's not sure if he can ever go back to his surname.
“I’d like to thank you for the Christmas present, Granger. It’s handsomely made and gladly received.”
"I let them in! I helped them - helped them come here and - and - "
Draco's grin turns a little meaner, eyes narrowing. "Oh, I'll show you
Draco stiffens, his cold words dropping rapidly to freezing. "My point is proven."
When Draco backs away and disappears to his mother's parlour, Harry fits a hand over his cooling cheek, replacing Draco's warmth with his own, thinking maybe Draco doesn't need him to be the spring after all.
"I don't think everyone puts the words
Merlin's Beard, Draco wants to drain the blood from his whole body just to keep it all from rushing up to his face the way it's doing now.
"And yet your best is never good enough." the Lucius-boggart derides, softly laughing. "You're always trying to play catch up, aren't you? Always second to Potter..."
No matter how Harry looks at it, he can't see any sinister motive in Malfoy's activities. He barely notices him in lessons, he rarely sees him around the school grounds, it's almost as if he has stopped existing; it's almost as if he's a ghost. Maybe all Draco needs if for someone to help
Hermione tuts, waving her wand to siphon the worst of the mud from Ron's robes. "Ron, don't tip your head back like that, hold it forward - and they're not
So Harry waits. He watches Draco like a hawk through the evening meal, hardly touching his steak and chips, occasionally offering reactions to conversation so Ron and Hermione don't jump down his throat for not seeming like himself.
"Welcome back to Hogwarts," McGonagall begins, purveying the students with a tight smile. "A few words before the feast; this past year has been one of the hardest in Hogwarts - and indeed, wizarding - history. We have been broken and we have suffered a great deal of heartache."
"Really?
On this occasion though - and prodded on by the possibility of being alone with Potter and a chance to confront a fear that was starting to grate on him - Draco leapt at the proposition. Besides, Draco recognised the growing tetchiness in Potter, that gnawing desperation to just get away from it all.
The world outside may lay claims at their doorsteps but Harry and Draco know who they are: They are desperately flawed. They can be brave sometimes, too. They are more
Draco wrestles with some internal conversation for a brief moment, then all of a sudden slings his bag off his shoulders and onto the floor in a clatter, marching back to Harry until he's almost nose to nose with him. Harry tries to straighten up as best he can but the top of his head still barely clears Draco's chin.
