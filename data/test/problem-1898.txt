‘Well? Get off,’ he said, impatient. Draco moved tersely, untangling their robes while Harry tried to push his erection down and button up his jeans. He gathered Ron’s voice had freed Harry of whatever spell he’d been under, that he’d go down now and pretend none of it had happened like he had before, that he’d proceed to spend the rest of the night giggling with Neville instead of talking to
Harry huffed a laugh. Over his shoulder, Draco could see Hermione’s and Ron’s spinning backs, their pace brisk as they exited the Great Hall - tired of waiting, Draco assumed; through the corner of his eye, still subtle and unsure, McGonagall’s eyes still seemed fixed on them; and closer, right where Draco could see them, a handful of students sitting at the tables had given up their lunch to gape at them instead. So many pairs of eyes deeming them true and solid - it really was for the best, since Draco, when he was the only one seeing, still had a hard time believing it.
‘I’m first,’ Dean Thomas raised his hand excitedly, ‘Fletchley, mate, if you catch the waiter ask him for shots, aye? Three each I’d say. For the tough ones, you see?’ his smile was devious, and the table laughed, ‘Okay, then: never have I ever… been so drunk I blacked out.’
Hermione regarded him with something akin to pity. Why wouldn’t she, when Draco was the height of pathetic, sputtering helpless nonsense, clinging to his lie and begging for secrecy?
Draco glared. ‘You’re a bloody tosser, Potter,’ he said, prying the bottle off Harry’s fingers and forcing himself to take a big gulp. By this point, he was hoping he wouldn’t remember this night at all when he woke up the next morning.
: he'd take what he could have, even if that meant a drunken, impulsive quickie never to be spoken of again.
All parallel conversations had descended into silence. Ron stared down at him from the moth-eaten sofa. Draco leaned fully against the coffee table, trying to maintain some shred of calm.
They joined their teams. Draco summoned his broom and shedded his coat on the grass. Back with the others, Ron gave a surprised huff.
‘Hiding in the loo,’ Finnigan shouted. His arm was swung over Hermione, whose gaze was still set on Draco. ‘He’ll never get back out here, I reckon.’
‘So that he wouldn’t fall!’ he snapped, then struggled to collect himself. ‘From higher, I mean. He would have, you know he would. Tell me you didn’t see how he was falling before. Tell me you didn’t think he was going to crash. He would have hurt himself if he kept going.’
Doubt creeped in. He murmured, half-hearted, staring at the box in his hands, ‘What the fuck do you know?’
‘Alright,’ Draco hummed. He leaned back on his chair - to compensate for the distance, he stretched a hand out, which Harry promptly took. It was a very simple intimacy, and that very fact made him giddy. ‘What do you want to know?’
It made Draco preen, the response, and he hungrily swallowed Harry's aching, denied cock again. There was something about the
'We were drunk the first time,' Draco remarked. Harry's chin was tilted up, exposing the curve of his neck, and Draco leaned down to mouth at it. 'Are we planning to defile every pub in the village?'
Next chapter the night in Hogsmeade continues, complete with Draco's signature 'I don't like you but I love you so much' attitude. And there's candy. And more alcohol. See you Sunday~
No, Draco set much lower goals. All Draco wanted were small, scattered things: to be the sole sharer of a joke Potter had found especially amusing; to be greeted just like Potter greeted his friends - with a fond hand on a shoulder and sleep-smoothed smile; to be able, in turn, to guide Potter with a hand on the low of his back, when the boy was all nerves and indecision; to know where Potter was not because he lurked but because he'd told him over breakfast; to wake up next to him so he could see his hair
The place was as small as the stall from the Three Broomsticks had been. It didn't much matter - more of an excuse to press against Harry, to compact muscles together and have him flat against the door. Oh, and the firewhiskey had made Harry impatient: he tugged at Draco's hair, carved nails into his shoulder blade to pull him impossibly closer and bit ruthlessly at his lip, a scarlet flame between Draco's palms, ever shifting and all consuming.
He withdrew just a little, to get a good intake of breath - and because he really did love to tease, and the little panicked stutter in Harry's breath was bloody precious - before swallowing him as far as he could, working him there, dangerously close to gagging and blurry-eyed with tears.
Because Draco had always felt that - he'd known ever since a child that he felt love for Potter. But his love hadn't bloomed normal, and it grew dark: old and bored, attached to all the fucked up things he'd done in order to conceal it. Draco Malfoy was not supposed to want to hold the Chosen One's hand, yet he did, ever since first year, and now the want had dulled, and he'd become accustomed to it, just as one does to a weak heart. It was a constant hurt, like a bad back, that Draco had endured for so long that he couldn't remember standing without its weight on his shoulder or breathing without its hold in his lungs. An indissociable part of him, his love for Harry, but nonetheless resigned: it was purposeless, and it was effortless, like correcting his name to Potter when he thought of him, or telling the world what he felt was hatred.
‘Keep the sleeves rolled up at all times. Name,’ the man said. Draco answered, and with a flick of the man’s wand the door opened and his coat flew in, rolled tightly into a ball. ‘Find me, say your name, I’ll give you your coat back at the end of night. Have fun, don’t break the glasses.’
‘Hey, mate,’ he said, eyelids batting in surprise when he caught sight of Draco’s reflection. Draco just stood there, frozen where he was. ‘Hermione said you weren’t feeling well. We thought you’d left.’
He walked weakly towards them, mouth dry, sight blurry, one sickening picture flashing in his mind: Harry’s limp body, so small among the grass, all swallowed in scarlet fabric, so that Draco couldn’t distinguish blood from not.
Draco went up to the library and perfected his Transfiguration essay until he fell asleep on top of the parchment.
‘You bloody idiot,’ Draco whispered before closing the distance again, sucking Harry’s bottom lip between his own as he backed him against the decrepit wall. When he withdrew - just an inch, enough that he could talk - his voice had gone hoarse. ‘We can do that whenever you’d like.’
to be the one to stretch it for the first time. He lapped at it more eagerly, sinking nails into the round globes of Harry's arse to keep him still, and heard a muffled sound as his head hit the mattress.
coat, hanging from Harry’s figure, and how often had Draco seen that in his dreams? - and disappearing between the others.
And it was so easy to revert to his old self - Harry pushed the way he’d always pushed, with fervour and unsuppressed emotion, eyes simmering and cheeks red, and Draco, in turn, pushed like he’d grown used to - with ice, with lies.
, all the more because it was Harry bloody Potter, because Draco had loved him for years and now he was here, kneeling, drooling over his cock and unashamedly wanton for it, and the symbiosis of sight and sensation was making his legs shake, his orgasm near pathetically fast. ‘Fucking beautiful, Potter, fuck- Merlin, you’re perfect, I-’ I love you, he meant to say, but the sound was strangled at the top of his throat, pushed sourly down, leaving him painfully vulnerable - and Harry looked up at him, all questioning eyes, so soft and
into the place, and the music unbearably loud, and Draco really ought to just go back to the dorms and join Pansy, who’d told him House parties were wretched and promptly refused to attend.
‘One would think, really, that it would have been fixed by now. I mean, House parties must have been going on for like… for like… Granger, oy!, Hermione, when’d they start?’
Draco snorted. If he focused past the heady fuzz of arousal, he could hear intermittent spurts of laughter from outside, sometimes a louder voice from downstairs.
‘I was just saying,’ he shrugged in half-hearted innocence. He’d hoped Harry would indulge that subject for at least a little longer.
'I remember you came quite fast last time. I'd certainly consider that flattering,' he whispered, a hint of mischief in his tone, and then, just to tease
With a snort, Harry walked away to sit gingerly on the bed. A cloud of dust lifted as the frayed mattress dipped down, swaying like fog in the chilly air.
Such were the inconveniences of loving a celebrity: even now that the war was over, he was a favourite subject of gossip. His name hovered in the air, ever slipping into Draco’s ear. It was impossible to forget him. Draco tried, nonetheless.
That at least got him a small laugh; the tension eased from his shoulders, and Harry fully drew Draco’s slacks and underwear down, making his cock jump out an angry red. Harry put one hand around it -the first time he’d done it to Draco, the first time he’d done it to
'They made us promise we'd be here. Said it was only fair that we all suffered,' Hermione explained, a huff of annoyance in the end. Draco, on his part, could barely stand to look at her without remembering that little corner in the pub, the thoughtless words that had come out of his mouth, Hermione's expression when she'd
But he couldn’t, though he’d like to, though he itched to see Ron’s expression when he very bluntly told him he’d been getting a blowjob from his very best friend, because it was clear
'I'll consider it,' he said; and, taking an apple from a nearby fruit bowl, he stood, 'Better be off, now.'
With long steps, he caught up to them. An invisible boundary was still straining the distance between them, blurring their chatter so it felt like Draco wasn’t supposed to be listening, casting him out as a passerby - thus, he hung one foot behind them, eyes lowering every so often to the ground, focusing on the lingering sting of his cheekbone. Suddenly hating the idea that Harry would see him, he remained on the opposite edge of the cluster, hopefully hidden from view.
‘Do you think he likes her?’ came Neville’s voice, unmistakably pensive. He was standing behind the sofa, fiddling with the sleeves of his old coat. It was awfully similar to the way Pike had fussed with his robes back at the common room. For the first time that night, Harry wasn’t plastered to his side.
Seamus and Dean suppressed a pair of high-pitched laughter. Neville looked scandalized, and Harry's grin was disbelieving.
Outside, it had begun to snow once more. Snowflakes settled on Draco's nose as he leaned against the stone wall. They nestled in his hair as he stared up at the sky.
It drove him crazy, this line of thought, and so, when Harry was seizing up, so near the edge, he withdrew, huffing a rough laugh as Harry's hands immediately twisted in his hair.
sake, will you stop caring about other people for once?’ he shouted. His sight swung, and in a blur he saw Ginny’s and Ron’s unimpressed expressions, and Harry, still uncaring, still regarding everyone else’s life as more
The cobblestone outside was glistening with frost, the lamplights colouring it yellow. It was quieter there, in the little street where Kettle Bottom was hidden, though Blodwyn Bludd's rough consonants reverberated still through the air, and there was a distinct, already intoxicating sound of clinking glasses digging at his ears, as if coming from every direction.
It was heaven, sucking Harry off. It was the heady, hysterical feeling of having accomplished a lifelong fantasy: he'd wanted it for so long, and imagined it, shaded and choreographed it in his mind, when he saw Harry all pink and panting after a Quidditch game, eyes shining with adrenaline, or when he'd catch him studying in the library with the most utterly bored look on his face, and find himself barely resisting the urge to crawl under the damn table and give him the distraction he was so obviously hoping for, or when he came down to the Great Hall in the morning with his eyes half-squinted, his hair untidy and his tie hanging from his shoulders, and Draco wanted more than anything to take him back to bed… It was so much of what he'd dreamt of, but warmer, softer,
Harry was drunk - that’s why he’d kissed him, why he’d let him blow him. That was it. A drunken mistake.
Harry huffed - not properly frustrated, no, too breathless for that, too shaky - and obliged, propped up a little on his elbows, eyes wild and dark as he waited for Draco to join him. Draco, however, had no hurry in doing so - how could he, when the sight before him was so delightful? When Harry was laying in
'Oh,' Harry said, and Draco could practically see, from all his years of experience, the devilish smirk that was blooming on his face, 'I fucking knew you'd liked it, Malfoy.'
‘Yes…’ Draco conceded, trying to keep the annoyance out of his tone. It was significantly difficult, however, when, in the distance, floating now at the height of the stands, Harry and Ron were wobbling in their broomsticks. ‘The other ones did, though, didn’t they? They were very drunk.’
Ron dragged his drink across the table his way. Even though they were so close, he had to talk quite loudly for Draco to hear. ‘Here, drink up.’
He turned his face and resumed his conversation with Hermione. Draco tensed his lips. He’d thought they’d ended their conversation at the greenhouse on a good note.
'Oh,' Draco snapped back to life, gaze quickly darting away from Potter's confused expression, 'Yes.'
'Merlin, Malfoy,' Harry moaned, his head hitting the wall, his throat convulsing so prettily from the angle Draco was seeing him.
‘Twat,’ Harry huffed, but he still kissed him goodbye as he left, and Draco still watched him go with the fondest, most hopelessly lovesick look the Great Hall had ever seen.
And how could Draco not, when every little confession, his or Harry’s, uttered during that wretched Veritaserum game was burnt into his memory? Oh, how little he’d known then, how skeptical he’d been, how sure he’d never get even a sliver of the intimacy he was allowed now. The thought made him hold onto Harry a little tighter, pulling him almost fully on top of him.
‘You see, it’s that- Oh, bloody hell, Malfoy, will you stop? The thing is, Ron and Harry, the idiots they are, only told me Friday, you see? Of course they would’ve, they have no tact, the lot of them. You were welcome to come, of course, you
The infirmary smelled faintly of talcum. The pale sunlight filtered through the narrow windows, tepid and bashful. Changing the sheets from one of the beds was the nurse who had been talking to Granger. A few beds after laid Harry.
Ron’s features tightened. The pruning shears swirled unsteady in his fingers - and how tragically Gryffindor would it be for Ron, who looked for whatever reason so cross, so quietly dark, to plunge them sticky and red into his thigh?
, Malfoy. Do you understand how foolish you were out there? You could have died as well, playing! You pushed Harry with absolutely no guarantees the fall would be safe. He could have fallen on his head! You could have killed him!’
‘For as long as you keep being stubborn, at least,’ Draco retorted. The potion had turned the proper shade of green now, thin silvery stems floating in the water. He eased the jar off Harry’s fingers, more an excuse to touch than anything else. ‘You’re doing Gillyweed next - one vial, not two, and disentangle them first. Slughorn’s instructions will say two, though.’
It was strange - it was unbelievable - and there was a stunned silence as Pansy and Luna gazed at each other and everyone else, in turn, stared at them. Then, with an inaudible click, movement and thoughts and
then he could add one slick finger and brush his prostate, properly abuse it, stroke his cock in tandem until he came. Steps like those to get him acquainted. Draco really didn’t mind the wait: Harry writhing on his tongue, on his fingers, on his cock, all pictures had their charm.
‘I know,’ Ron sighed, resigned, the type of tone Draco knew he couldn’t push. It was final. It was an effort. He wasn’t quite accepted, nor totally discarded. ‘Come the fuck in. But don’t say thank you. And don’t you dare tell anyone.’
Draco snorted; he took another sip of beer before pushing it back towards Ron. Then, and with his gaze trained on the wooden table, trying to get the words out in some semblance of
So he wrapped his fingers firmly around the root of Harry's dick, maybe a bit too harsh - forceful, because he couldn't help but feel illogically possessive -, slackened his jaw and set out to be the best damn hookup Harry could have dreamt of.
‘Potter!’ Draco yelled, rushing behind him. There was a cloud of dust and small wooden splinters; under the tower, inside the decrepit structure, it was dark.
With that, he fluttered off to the center of the hall, where the other ghosts were gathering, leaving Draco feeling quite mortified, Harry biting his lip in a lame attempt not to laugh, and the three sharks looking obscenely amused.
‘I look forward to it,’ Draco murmured, trying to sound less emotional than he felt. He failed: the words came out all quiet and sweet and ever patient, the humble loyalty of the lovesick. Harry, the twat, smiled something crooked and amused, like he
‘I’m sure we’d find ways to keep you entertained,’ he said gently, pressing a soothing hand to his lower back. Harry arched gratefully into the touch.
,' he murmured. Pansy waited with stubborn decisiveness, and he sighed, 'He can't see me, Pansy, not after I essentially told him I'd never step foot in that place.'
Doll. Draco would have guessed 'sweetheart' would be more Harry's type; would have put money - thought about it often enough - that he'd shy away from being called 'baby' but still blush so prettily. But apparently he liked 'doll', if Finnigan called him that - and he
Longbottom's voice made them turn in surprise. He was standing a few steps away from them, looking  absurdly proud of the words that had just come out of his mouth.
He didn’t even try it, though. Because he was soft and pitiful and in love, and Harry would have his whole dozen.
It wasn’t like Draco had never thought about it. He remembered how resolute he’d been when 8th grade started: set on making amends with Potter’s friends. He would have charmed them, first with small, honest words that would earn him a neutral state as an acquaintance, later with enough polite trivialities to be considered, by temptative eyes, as a friend. And then, when Potter heard of Draco’s redemption, he’d already be insinuated into his group.
He looked into Harry's eyes, which were wide with surprise and a sort of carefree amusement Draco couldn't even hope to reciprocate. He wanted to show him in some way that they should stay quiet, hide in the fucking stall until Finnigan's unbelievably short attention span burnt out and he went looking for another drink, and then carry on with what they were doing - every way to do that, however, seemed so saccharine, so hopelessly telling, and why would Harry even agree and choose him over his friends? Over Finnigan, who was all charm and open arms, the twat… a soulful, simple Gryffindor who'd be more than happy to suck Harry's cock just like Draco had?
Draco smirked. Slowly, he coaxed Harry’s hips until they were flushed with his and linked his hands on his lower back.
tried, he could also hear that voice scorning his name - yelling 'Draco' between fits of laughter - which perhaps meant he wasn't hearing anything at all. It was all projections; it was all his ridiculous mind, for which everything revolved around Potter and his friends.
Harry was in one of the bedrooms, peeking inside the debris of a wardrobe. A beam of moonlight bounced off his glasses. The light was white and gentle, an ethereal hue damning the house into something lost and dead. The silence seemed unbreakable. Harry broke it.
'He didn't fuck anyone,' Draco repeated, gaze now back on the grey lake in front of them, 'I checked.'
But he simply couldn't go. He wouldn't be able to stand it. All those people stumbling in the snow, cheeks flushed and robes ruffled; all that aimless happiness that had no place for him.
… Yes, yes,’ his tone became distant while he reminisced, before he looked back at the two of them with a glistening smile. ‘Wonderful for you two, if a bit of an odd match. Matters of romance, though… five centuries I’ve been here, still haven’t figured it out,’ he turned with a flourish, hovering a bit over their heads. ‘In any sense, I was meant to tell you the dance is about to begin, if you’d like to take your places.’
‘I can’t believe you don’t like these,’ he huffed, seeming blissful as he chewed it. The group had started walking back towards Hog’s Head, meanwhile, everyone excited with their indulgently filled bags, flittering between each other to swipe different pieces of candy. Up ahead, Pansy was speaking to Hermione and Alicia while they shared a handful of sherbet lemons.
But he wouldn’t share that with Harry. No, there were certain subtleties of his past that were simply too pathetic to impose on someone else. He’d bear them himself, so they could haunt his dreams alone.
‘We ought to make good use of this time then, shouldn’t we?’ said Draco, absent, impatient to get inside. The four of them walked up the uneven stone step and into the colourful store, all dim corridors and eccentric trinkets, the chandelier spinning reds and greens on the walls. Pansy drifted into an easy discussion with Luna over the colour of her dress, Finnigan was eager to trail far from Draco and down a wretched avenue of Pixie Puffs and Every Flavour Beans; Draco, on his own accord, greeted Hermione and Fletchley, who were by the door, and had half a mind to check the treacle tart corridor when he caught sight of Harry right by the counter, leaning against it, already looking at Draco with a softly pleased expression.
‘You’re fucking daft is what you are. You can’t even walk in a straight line, how do you plan to fly?’
Next came Alchemy. They made a strange few, the ones who’d chosen that elective, and the air of the musty laboratory thrummed with burst nerves and lingering tension; the test had gone wrong for a pair of Hufflepuffs, as it seemed; swimmingly for the charmless Rowena, and that’s all he’d gathered. Although he had half a mind to ask Harry, the thought fell mute at his hips, dead at his knees, and he couldn’t for the life of him lift a foot and walk up to the little table where Harry sat transmuting tin.
There was something in Hermione’s eyes, that sharpness of thought that always made her so intense, like she was miles ahead, fixing consequences of problems others were bound to make. Still, she was keeping it at bay - a half-sober thought not to meddle, most likely, and she shrugged:
‘There’s practice,’ Goyle said, lighting the fireplace with a flick of his wand. Draco groaned. Sometimes he wholeheartedly missed the days when he had lackeys.
Pansy sniggered, when she heard it. Neville’s smile, though - and how strange it was to see it, in a face usually so modest - seemed almost approving.
With a smooth swerve of his broomstick, he plunged down and forward, gliding away, to search the other side of the field.
‘In the game,’ Harry’s gaze was skittering around his figure, always a neutrino away from properly landing on Draco, ‘The game, earlier, when we were talking about the scars - the one you said, not the Dark Mark, the one on your chest. Was it the one… was it me that did it?’
Friday came. He hadn’t been invited to an outing. He hadn’t expected it - he felt disconnected not only from Harry but from his entire circle. Hermione and Neville, who’d been the most likely to invite him to anything, now resented him. There was no discernible way to breach this barrier that had settled bitter and stunted between them. He’d been cast out.
And they seemed to reach some kind of understanding, something solemnly trusting, like she’d finally accepted Draco into their lives, like she
‘It was fucking daft to agree to it in the first place,’ Pansy told him the next morning. They were by the lake again, surrounded in thick, grey fog.
, can you believe it? Though we didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, a potion that makes you laugh, why’d Slughorn ever choose that?’ Dean took a moment to breathe, ‘Anyway, Harry’s complaining that all of them are like from centuries ago, right? And Hermione, she goes on this bid about how it’s all relevant, you just have to update the practices. Of course, we all thought it a bit of a bore, then - but then the test comes, and, well, you know what it was. Alihotsy, ancient as all hell. I reckon we all remembered enough of what Hermione had said to pass. How bloody great is that?’
‘Oh, and don’t mention this to Ron, alright? I thought best not to tell him of your… outburst the other day. He took enough time as it was to come around to you.’
Now it was Harry who looked down at the small cauldron. He was stirring the brew pointlessly, some nasty habit he’d picked up from Muggle cuisine.
‘Not if the bar is full. Oy, hey, yeah, it’s ten - fuck, twelve, is it? Twelve firewhiskeys, like, in glasses. Drinks, I mean, not shots.’
'Not exactly. You see, Potter, unlike yours my hair is actually possible to style back, even if you fuck it up,' his voice was scratched up, rough and noticeably lower from arousal. He stroked Harry teasingly with the smooth slide of his own spit. 'Besides, this seems like a great exception, wouldn't you say?'
'You really do look lovely, sweetheart,' he murmured. True to his promise, he kissed Harry just under his eye, then closer to his ear, then his temple, never near his lips.
Pansy nodded a little bit, and this time she actually made the effort to school her expression while she processed it. Draco could barely believe it - he was reeling, heady with the realization that he was fucking
Draco finished his clementine. He thought of the whirlwind of insanities which had happened in that quaint little village: finding Harry at the bathroom in Kettle Bottom, that first night; Harry wearing his coat, the bloody treacle tarts, and Harry’s smile - mischievous already, as if he
The taunt, as well as the hungry dare dilating Harry’s pupils, was enough to restore Draco’s confidence. He pressed him back down against the mattress, giving in to his own arousal with an indulgent twitch of his hips, and drew a wanton smirk.
Draco smiled. He’d been smiling since he’d woken, a paradoxical little thing between sated and longing, as liquid and dazed as the pleasant ache in his bones. He ought to look like a fool, he reckoned. Draco Malfoy, the fallen prince of Death Eaters - what could he possibly have to smile about? Oh, but he felt light, deliriously so with the lingering dripping of endorphins from last night, the mesmerizing reminders of heat and skin, the thrilling thought that, come the end of Herbology, he’d see Harry again.
'Then you know what I want you to say now, don't you, Harry? Come on, love, I've wanted you to for so long. Say my name.'
'I know you do,' Draco snorted, lazily kissing his cheek. 'I also know you'd like what I'd do to you if I had enough time.'
to do this. Sober and sharp he could do it, could face Harry, could pretend not to know how his lips - how his cock - tasted; hungover, on the other hand, mouth dry and eyes teary, hair unstyled, head pounding, too raw to conjure spite or indifference, awfully human, in short, and too honest in his discomfort, he’d crumble under Harry’s gaze
more than that; secondly, next time Finnigan calls you ‘doll’ you’re going to knee him in the balls.’
Draco had completely forgotten the blasted bag - it hung neglected in his spare hand, the one not tugging at Harry's hip. He gave it to Blaise.
‘I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t,’ he said. Then, lower, staring at his shoes and gripping white-knuckled onto the edge of the desk, he added, ‘I could teach you how to brew it, if you’re that worried about it.’
, had to, because he kept letting him call him ‘doll’, and, well, Draco couldn’t hate him for that either, could he? Because Harry could like whomever he wanted; he’d never told Draco he liked him - he’d told him, moreover, that he’d only wanted to kiss him since he’d seen him come out of that bloody stall. Draco was nothing more than a twenty minutes wondering, so he couldn’t resent Harry; could only, at most, judge him for an obvious lack of self-respect, because he should bloody know he deserved better than Finnigan.
, with the fucking snow shovelled strategically into the most aesthetic corners, and touches of white snowflakes dusting everything in wonderful winter charm, Draco could swear the castle reached an entirely unprecedented level of flamboyance.
a game, and Draco really rathered being alone. He sat in the front row, slumping into the seat, folded meek and unobtrusive to discourage any God-forbidden
Hermione pinned him with a glare. ‘You knew?’ she asked, which was a bit rich, wasn't it?, considering she'd been acting as Draco's impromptu confidant for a few weeks.
They hovered behind him as he made his way to the dorms and picked out a shirt. While he looked through the piles of fabric, he thought a bit more clearly on the matter. It wasn’t necessarily that terrible an idea. Harry’s group didn’t have a claim over Hogsmeade; Draco was allowed to go there, and Merlin knew he’d appreciate the alcohol. Besides, what would he, Blaise and Pike look to drunken eyes other than a trio of blurry shadows? No one would recognize him - it would require a predisposition to think of him in the first place.
Regardless, he didn’t change his mind. Five minutes before midnight on Friday, he was planted at the bottom of the spiraling stairs, clad in one of his best suits, posture rigid, hands clasped behind his back, Pansy beside him and Blaise and Rowena whispering a few steps back.
‘Don’t think it suits me, Potter?’ he asked, aiming for disinterested, trying to hide the disappointment in his tone. He knew he shouldn’t have let Pansy dress him all in black - he’d seen the boys Potter danced with, all wide grins and bright colours, dripping life.
The question served, at least, to make him more awake. A bit later, he finally went for that tea. It cleared his head a little, dissolved the weight in it, made it easier to think. After less than an hour had gone past, and he’d grown tired of tossing and turning and clinging to the hope that he’d go back to sleep, he tried to stand. It wasn’t too hard, nor was it getting dressed. Moving all the way to the common room was tiresome - and shooing the first years that were sprawling there being unconscionably loud was worse. He forgot his book, didn’t quite have the will to go and fetch it, and so he settled for a day of looking at the waters of the lake.
There was one brief moment when Hermione’s expression cleared into something soft - Draco figured she must be seeing him as one sees a small animal crossing a busy street, all raw vulnerability and pitiful naivety, charming only in its potential for tragedy.
Draco raised his eyebrows. ‘I don’t think you are. You drank a lot, Potter, I saw you,’ he said. He could still remember the flush of Harry’s cheeks, the slur of his words, the way he’d looked at Draco like… He swallowed. The air felt colder around him. There was a new gravity in his words when he murmured, ‘You were very drunk, weren’t you?’
Harry stepped in front of Draco. His slight fidgeting had ebbed; instead, his figure had filled with a sort of humoured confidence. It rather suited him. Then again, what didn’t?
He tried, in any sense. Smoothed his features into some parody of calm when he saw Ron waiting for them at the bottom of the stairs.
‘As long as you don’t do it in front of us,’ said Ron, and the impatient tone he’d used - for he looked in all aspects like he wanted to turn around and bolt - brought an air of finality to the whole thing. A moment of curiosity, shameless prodding and ogling eyes. Over now. The faces by the door dispersed, their voices gave way to gentle music once more, and Draco and Harry were not quite alone but mostly forgotten.
‘And if I hadn’t done it - if I’d let him carry on playing, would I not have been killing him as well?’
Inside, the lights were even brighter. He’d also been right when he’d assumed the place would be full - there was barely an inch free to navigate. The music was a wordless beat, jarring in his ears, and he had half a mind to buy a shot - or three - before he went searching for Harry’s group, so he could seem at least somewhat relaxed - he'd have a fit if anyone called him fucking uptight again - but the bar was too crowded, and he doubted he could squeeze in. Idly scratching his forearm, fingers grazing over the thin lines of the snake, he went about cutting through the crowd, hoping for a glimpse of Potter.
He wondered how exactly did relationships begin. Did they stem from some clean confession, like Draco’s when they’d been under the effect of Alihotsy, which had been so bittersweetly discarded? Did they turn so quickly into open kisses and implicit commitment? Were they meant to be this foggy?
There was a rush of reckless responses on the tip of Draco’s tongue, temptingly tender words he could utter so fluidly in the honeyed moment: sentiments of desperate love and ready devotion that were the utmost truth. They choked a moment before they turned to sound, dissolving into sugar, dripping right back down his throat.
There were three stalls; a row of sinks lining the opposite wall. The mirror was dirty, the light busted, the walls graffitied. Some lanky Hufflepuff was checking on the charm that had coloured his hair butter yellow; someone, by the sound of it, was throwing up in one of the stalls. Draco locked himself in the farthest one and leaned against the door.
lips to notice yours,’ Draco retorted. He stepped closer to him, putting his own hand on the bag. ‘Let me put it on you. Please.’
hold this no one's interest? -, and this no one would instead give their attention to some unoriginal imbecile of a Gryffindor in the most standard Muggle clothes, because from what Draco had observed
‘Cheers to that,’ Ron raised his glass, ‘We’ve been robbing that place every year since we got here. It’s more the Interesting Section than anything else, by this point.’
Harry rolled his eyes. He didn’t seem even the slightest bit guilty as he pocketed Draco’s money, nor when he handed Draco the box, which Draco thought was fair: he had offered, after all.
He headed to the Astronomy tower. There was a nook there, almost on the top floor, under an arched window, bathed in a soft, pale light that was perfect for reading. It had become a favoured spot of his - no one else ever went there, and when the pages began to bore him he could turn to gaze out the glass panel, at the frosted school grounds, the front of trees guarding the Forbidden Forest, the edges of the Quidditch court, over which he could occasionally catch the quickly-shifting dots of players, and let his mind distort every little glimmer into the gold stripes on a scarf or the reflection off round-lensed glasses.
‘Your mind wanders to the strangest places,’ Draco snorted, impatient, searching Harry’s lips again.
‘You’re an idiot,’ he spit out. It didn’t come out too angry, though he’d aimed for it. More resigned. He fully faced Finnigan then - an inch from his face, with a spindley woman pushing at his back - and asked, ‘Do you like him?’
‘Just…’ he gestured vaguely at his eyes. Draco took a few steps closer to the mirror. ‘Do they look the same? At all?’
with it. Ron had told him that Harry had nightmares that day in the greenhouses, hadn’t he? That he wandered around at night because of them. Time spent in Hogsmeade’s freezing streets was time he wouldn’t have to spend tossing and turning in bed. Safer in the cold than inside his own head.
'I didn't, no,' Ron said miserably. There it was again, this strange inkling that they'd been in the Slytherin common room, but before Draco could enquire further Seamus was speaking:
He huffed, frustrated, and set his gaze determinedly on Harry, swallowing the bubbling of fear inside him.
There were a couple of unmemorable rounds. Dean and Ginny went out to get more shots after an entire turn of only nasty flavours; Pansy seemed to love the game, and asked by far the most embarrassing questions; Harry finished his firewhiskey, then sipped some of Draco’s, and as his cheeks flushed and his eyes brightened he slouched a little in his seat, settling his neck against Draco’s arm; Draco, on his part, ran absent trails with his fingers over Harry’s shoulder. His shirt, though a gorgeous grey, was too thin, and his skin was cold under the soft fabric. Draco had tried to insist that he keep his robes on when they’d reached the table, but Harry had rolled his eyes like a petulant child and shedded them over the back of the seat with a dismissive ‘fuck off’. He honestly didn’t know why he’d tried: Harry was very obviously incapable of dressing himself to match the temperatures. He’d titter and chatter his teeth if only he could move his limbs freely… or simply because he knew how much it bothered Draco to see him like that. Really, Draco ought to start sneaking into the Gryffindor dorms each morning and laying out a proper outfit for Harry by his bed. He could even kiss him good morning, while he was at it… maybe slip into bed with him, make sure he started the day properly warm.
Draco snorted. It almost hurt his pride, in that ridiculously blind loyalty one has to their House, that, after so much talk of safety and discretion, the Slytherin dungeon had been broken into by a couple of kids.
‘For Merlin’s sake,’ Pansy squeezed his knee a little tighter - he was certain that, were he not under the covers, there’d be nails sinking into his skin. ‘I didn’t see
Draco, of course, knew those were Potter’s favourite. He knew, because for years he’d watched him swipe them greedily off the Gryffindor table at the Great Hall; because he’d spied him eating them with his friends in Hogsmeade, and wished he were able to make fun of him for his obsession not in a vicious way, but in a fond tone; because, during sixth year, when they’d learnt how to make Amortentia, he’d heard Potter had smelled treacle tarts, and felt a pang of heartache, since the first scent he himself had caught was the one of Potter’s hair.
Harry came down with two more vials between his fingers, climbing down the ladder with only one hand and hurried feet. His expression, when he was finally back at floor level, was clearly pleased.
uptight he was, he turned on his heels and marched down the corridor, a chorus of murmured 'good lucks' blurring with his footsteps.
'Definitely not- fuck, Harry, come on, come on,' he muttered, pleaded, tugging on Harry's hair until he was swallowing around him again, all wet, sinful heat. 'That's it, that's it sweetheart, fuck, you're so
noise, a choked beginning of a primitive growl - and quickly sought Draco’s mouth again. Draco bracketed him between his forearms, primly ignored the dust clouds lifting around them and kissed him with renewed intensity, an impulsive vulnerability - because he got to kiss Harry now, got to feel his lythe body writhing beneath him, and it was the second time this had happened, which surely meant Harry couldn’t have regretted that bathroom blowjob too terribly, and he hadn’t even drunk that much, at least that Draco had seen, so the possibility remained that Harry was doing this purely because he
He pushed his plate away, bumping elbows with Blaise, who was animatedly gesturing beside him as he chatted with Pike and their new obnoxiously tall,
The warmth was short-lived, then. Draco didn't much care, in all honesty; he was much more preoccupied with easing the tension growing in Harry's impatient body - or maybe winding it tighter and tighter until it broke. So he let Blaise's smirk be, let it hang all pleased on his face, and stepped away without another word. Let him feel like he'd won - Draco was very clearly leaving with the prize.
The man, unimpressed, narrowed his eyes. ‘Do you not know the rules of the party, boy? Don’t tell me. Show me.’
‘The other day. He did invite her to the party, but she was working on the Transfiguration essay overnight,’ Hermione’s frown deepened, ‘I do hope she isn’t just a rebound for Ginny. She’s a nice girl.’
was there, Hermione who knew his secret and held it brazenly in the palm of her hand, and Draco couldn't begin to feel relaxed with her around. He looked at her, or heard her smooth tone over the gusts of wind, and fear surfaced inside him that she'd told someone, told Harry, told the entire school.
'Good,' Draco said, and then he was lunging down to kiss him, to compress his body down in a frenzy of heat and need, because Harry wanted it, wanted
Seeing that none did, and that the conversation had descended into something unmistakably flirtatious that not only bored Draco but
He could end the game there. Return to the dungeons, where it was cold and dark and safe. . Harry would judge him for refusing to answer, but he wouldn’t exactly be surprised: hadn’t it been well established that Draco was uptight? He could be the first wizard to lie under the influence of veritaserum. The only ways he’d keep his secret, his pet burden, just like he had for years. That was it.
The Healer did his job, left as morosely as he’d shown, and Harry was back to class on Monday. He acted like nothing had happened: ‘the usual hazards of Quidditch’, he’d say with one of his crooked smiles. He failed to mention Draco had pushed him. The school remained ignorant, and Draco preserved his quiet life in the outskirts of the castle, unbothered and absent from anyone’s thoughts.
sake,’ Harry whined, but he still laughed, breathless and hysterical, trembling in his fingers as he tried to take himself out of his slacks.
‘Have you and Finnigan never learnt to walk?’ said Draco, steadying himself against the wall. The thought came to him when he caught the lingering scent of Gillyweed in Thomas’s robes. ‘How did Slughorn’s test go?’
‘What do you want?’ Draco asked, because this was as close to a date as they’d ever be, and he planned to pay.
His voice surfaced hoarse from the alcohol. The girl that had been labouring down the stairs with shaky knees and swinging hair walked past him in a frenzy, elbowing him in the ribs.
Then, one cold and uninteresting morning, at the end of Charms class, Harry broke the silence between them.
And Draco certainly had a lot of suggestions - a portfolio dating back to around fourth grade, extending from the silliest, awkwardest fantasies to ones he’d finessed and kept prominent amid the rest, his predefined film to roll in the back of his eyelids before he drifted off to sleep. He wanted Harry to keep kissing him, insistent and openly wanting; he wanted to see him undress himself, wanted to tell him which piece to take off first and see if Harry went against him - because he always did, didn’t he?, only complied when Draco didn’t expect him to, making it in itself a rebellion; wanted to feel his deft hand around his cock, guide him through it, tell him what he liked and see - and
The bag was filled with makeup products. Draco smirked as he rummaged through it, jutting his hip against the cold ceramic of the sink.
Immediately, Draco followed, dodging the indistinct red blur that was Dean Thomas somewhat haphazardly. He had to lean his body too far to the side, and he dropped, still hanging to the broom, doing a complete spin before managing to get back up. It made his heart pound, and his breath come quick and ragged, and he didn’t even feel cold anymore, though he was the only one in his thin, black and white uniform amidst the blurs of thick, colourful fabric. He was going to fall. He was absolutely going to fall, because he was a fucking idiot and he’d drunk way too much the previous night - he’d been sucking Harry off in a filthy bathroom seven hours ago, for fuck’s sake - and he very simply
Tuesday dawned with tepid rain, and Hermione Granger followed him through an entire corridor in the morning, before he’d even summoned the courage to show up for breakfast, and it was too early, and it hurt too much, and he turned so suddenly that she almost hit him.
Next chapter, to keep with the trend, will be called The House Party III, but a very adequate alternative title would have been 'Gratuitous Semi-Public Smut'.
‘Alright, mates, I have a good one,’ Dean Thomas said, and Harry leaned over the table to hear him better. Draco missed the warmth of his arm, and stared in ill-disguised fondness as he toyed with his glass. ‘Never have I ever hid a kink from a partner.’
Liquid courage pumping violent red in his arteries, Draco let through his smirk just a fraction of his hunger, just enough that Harry would see it if he was
Draco could feel his face heat - inexplicably, really - and he looked down at last, picking up his books.
Luna flashed him a smile. Ron, who was at the edge of the seats, began hushering everyone with wide gestures over the table:
Draco glared at him from the corner of his eye. His cheek still hurt; he could feel blood crusting in his chin.
Wasn’t that a revelation? He’d spent so long obsessing over the exchange - he remembered Pansy laughing as he shared it with her, the surge of panic when she suggested they should go to Hogsmeade, the cold, rotten certainty that Harry belonged somewhere very far from him, detached from his life completely, and that this eighth year was but a torturous limbo sent by cosmic karma as one final punishment for him.
And it felt like a confession, weighed in the air like one, scarred his conscience like one, and he suddenly thought that he’d said too much - because he’d never said
Harry grumbled something, hopelessly adorable in his frustration - hadn’t Draco called him adorable last night? had Harry liked it? would he blush all pink and pretty if Draco told him again? - before heading for the smaller cauldrons. Draco took a steadying breath: he would have liked to forego all pretense of subtlety and push Harry against a wall - he had teased, after all -, but the prick did need to learn the bloody potion and, judging by his reluctant pace, Draco would clearly have to be responsible for the both of them.
. Indifferent to Harry and punishing Draco for not having told them sooner, they’d be ruthless and sharp and just on the edge of sardonic, and they’d pester the two of them, and Draco could bear the jokes that accosted him but he didn’t quite know what he’d do if Harry reacted badly. If he had a poor time, if he did get in a row, if he looked at them all together in the cold darkness of the dungeons and finally saw Draco as the irremediable Slytherin he was, and pictured him in the Death Eater robes he’d worn, and ran back into the simplistic comfort of the Gryffindor dorms never to speak to him again.
‘So is yours,’ Draco replied. It was his tone - ragged, with the obvious strain of someone trying to keep their insides together - that made Harry’s smile fall.
Hermione gave him a long look. ‘As far as the school’s concerned, Harry lost control of his broom. I, Seamus and Neville are the only ones who saw what happened. I won’t try to change their minds about it.’
,’ Finnigan sniggered. He was being wonderfully effective at killing Draco’s erection, all harsh consonants and high pitchings of his voice, none of Harry’s soft, tilting snark - and he could see, through the sliver between the door and the stall, Harry’s back as he moved towards the sink and began washing his hands; his shirt was creased, and Draco had done that, because he’d blown him, he’d blown Harry fucking Potter and he would have bloody
as he finally came in long ropes all over Draco’s sheets, and his arse clenched so perfectly, so desperately around Draco’s cock that his own orgasm followed, even as his head reeled from the bloody words he’d said
He was unsure of the etiquette, which was foolish. Draco knew Harry genuinely needed that lesson - it wasn’t a cover for anything obscene. Then again, the simple notion of helping Harry, innocent and brief as it was, brought him just as much anxiety.
With a shaky breath, he pulled his cock out from between Harry’s slack lips and pulled him up. Harry’s legs were gelatinous little things - he crumbled softly into Draco’s chest, arms winding around his neck, and laid an absent, open-mouthed kiss on his collarbone. Draco immediately pulled him closer with a hand on his lower back, ignoring the way his spent cock ran through Harry’s warm skin.
Ron took a step closer, suffocatingly close. He seemed quite capable of throwing Draco out the platform in that moment. Or perhaps Draco would fall on his own. His head hurt, he was reeling, balance was lost.
It was out of Draco’s character, but the alcohol was urgent in his bloodstream, and, from behind Neville’s shoulder, the view of Potter walking towards them emboldened him - so, swallowing the preposterous panic inside him, he brought a hand up to squeeze Neville’s shoulder for one firm moment, in a gesture he hoped would cement the beginnings of this friendship.
‘Don’t get smug,’ Harry snorted, though he trailed off into a quiet moan as Draco cupped him with a tender touch.
And with that all past tension was very simply dispeled, and Draco forgot the future at once to focus on the present.
‘It would certainly-’ Draco began, impatiently tugging on Harry’s shirt to bite and suck on his collarbone, ‘be very telling in terms of expressing your consent.’
your problem with me?’ Draco asked. He’d most likely regret the question: it was the sort of topic that would invariably lead to shouting and shoving, and he didn’t have the strength for that. But Ron had been so
'We're all here, Ron,' Hermine said, drawing another polite smile before she turned to meet him. 'Let's get moving before Hagrid leaves.'
Harry undid his jeans, hissing as he drew the zipper out. A wet spot had already formed on his underwear. It was endearing, in some way. Love truly made people senseless.
There was a pulse of silence, during which Draco was content watching Harry mesh the different shades in uncoordinated tries, and suppressing the insane urge to offer to properly help, to feel the thin skin of Harry’s eyelids under his fingers. Then, the bathroom door slammed open - a high-pitched laugh, a squeal, a groan from a lower voice; the door slammed shut equally as loudly, and a mess of entwined limbs and clashing lips stumbled through the bathroom. The couple ran into the middle stall, paying them no mind, and locked themselves inside with a hysterical fit of laughter.
Draco smiled at that, glancing at the steaming mug on the bedside table. Perhaps, when he’d regained sense of his body, he’d venture to drink it.
'Whatever do you mean?' he'd feigned ignorance, though his face had tensed, and he stood rigid where his hand still rested on the doorknob.
He closed the door behind him and went about finding the vials of veritaserum. Supposedly, they’d be like water, unobtrusive between the exuberantly coloured potions and various jars of ingredients. It was taking a while, and Draco found himself taking worried sips out of the bottle - he couldn’t bear going back empty-handed, not after he’d made such a big show out of going in there.
‘Powder these - all of them - and add them slowly. In the instructions it’ll say counterclock swirls, but you ought to use the three-ninety technique. Hadn’t been popularized yet.’
The girl turned to them, round eyes dazed. Draco tried to untangle his arm from Pansy’s, but it was in vain: she dragged him towards Luna and her friend, sweetness plastered on her face.
, bleeding warmth into each other. He wanted to reach out and check Harry’s arm; he wanted to kiss his forehead and adjust his glasses; he wanted to be
‘Always, Harry,’ Finnigan shouted. The boy was an inarticulate jumble of golden and red skin climbing over the others’ laps to leave his seat. Harry smirked, an evil thing for only Draco to see, and then he was standing, clashing against Finnigan’s side and disappearing into the sea of bodies.
‘You want me to take my shirt off?’ he asked, all faux nonchalance - a little too hushed to be convincing - because he needed to hear Harry laugh.
die?’ Figures you’d all be into Quidditch - all brawn and no brain,’ Draco said, all of him tense, spying from the corner of his eye as Harry’s joyful demeanour crumbled. Draco hated it, that he was playing the bad guy, the one who broke the mood, but it wasn’t like he had a choice, did he? He was there to help, and he’d been willing to play perfectly nice - or as nice as he could be, in his current state - when the bloody Weasleys, lap dogs as they were, insufferably loud and inconveniently opinionated, had started hounding.
'No, you stay there, love, right there on my cock,' he murmured, moving just a little forward so his dick inched further into Harry's mouth. Harry fluttered his eyelashes - like he did it on purpose, the twat, so pretty, so bloody
Harry’s attention was still on the damned tarts. Draco felt helplessly small, like every inch of closeness he’d conquered the previous night had been reinstated and stretched infinitely wider - he’d gotten a taste of Harry’s lips, skin, affection, and now, because of some foolish mistake, he’d been pushed away, a slow, lukewarm mass of resentment between them.
‘I’ve no bloody clue,’ Draco snorted. Harry met him with a smile, so lovely and wide, and in tandem they were leaning closer for a kiss.
Draco was staring at the cobblestone as the four of them walked, but, judging by the cheerful lilt in her answer, he was certain she’d smiled.
‘You know what they say, Draco - there’s no better cure for a hangover than some fresh air,’ drawled Blaise, pushing Draco’s legs off his lap and hoisting him up by his arm. Draco wavered a bit, head unstable, too heavy, slipping off his neck. Once he recovered his sight, he glared.
Harry raised an eyebrow, his lips twitching up into a skeptical smirk. ‘Do you even like treacle tarts?’
Draco set the book aside on the cold floor, staring morosely out the window. A prickly layer of ice had frozen over the glass.
Draco didn't have much practice, but he definitely had the motivation. It was Harry's first blowjob and he was going to get it
‘That boring little Ravenclaw again?’ Draco scoffed. ‘That poor soul is the most unoriginal - oh, for Merlin’s sake, Blaise, help the poor boy out before he rips his sleeves off - anyway, she’s unoriginal, is what I meant to say. Just look at her bloody name.’
it. How was it that they’d been enemies for years, then a hesitant type of acquaintances, then friends, then
From the armchair came the low rumble of Goyle’s laugh. He was bouncing his knee up and down, foot skidding on the floorboards with a persistent, infuriating squeak; all pent up energy, like he always was before Quidditch practices. Were Draco capable of it, he would have thrown him one of the silver laced pillows.
Harry snorted - and his fingers swept over the raised skin, a ghostly touch, as if asking for permission. Draco shuddered a breath; inside the stall, the couple was still laughing, and it was impossible to dissociate what
But perhaps it would be temporary. There’d been genuine want in Harry’s eyes that night, hadn’t it? Draco’s memory was a fickle thing, too twisted by a life’s worth of dreams to be properly trustworthy, but he’d
Dean Thomas came gliding out the kitchen, clearly having drunk an excessive amount of rum, and begged Ginny to build a snowman. A third Chaser, he said. Ginny convinced a couple others to go along, the few who’d been in the kitchen resurfaced with empty bottles and giddy smiles and the assembled team went tumbling out the door and into the snowy night. Draco, who had a certain fondness for keeping blood in his extremities, chose to stay inside. So too did Hermione, Sue, Harry and Neville.
‘And you’re the only one allowed to try and fix mine,’ he whispered, soft words lost in Draco’s mouth, welling in his heart. That, more than anything else, as they swept across the hall in each other’s arms, felt like a promise.
They made it through most of the potion swimmingly. It was a complicated little thing, overly perfumed and tinged pink with aconite - Baneberry leaves for no purpose but bitterness, for Merlin’s sake - but Harry seemed to get into the swing of it. Draco didn’t try to touch him again. Mostly, he kept his hands fisted by his sides. There was a brief argument over the legitimacy of the three-ninety technique: Harry, the bloody fool, was unmovable that there was no difference in stirring with ninety degree motions, like he’d never
‘What? Sod off,’ Harry managed through a surprised laugh; and he was angling away again, but Draco grabbed him by one hip and unzipped his slacks deftly. They slid half down his thighs, revealing come-soaked underwear and the subtle outline of a very soft dick.
‘Nothing agrees with Goyle,’ Pansy said, though her bite was half-hearted. ‘Luna and I are going to look for the Headless Hunt. Do holler if you see them,’ she waved, Luna did as well, they walked off in a twirl of purple and red. Blaise and Rowena were keen to find Tracey, so they too wandered away with the vague promise of returning with her. Harry and Draco were alone.
There was very little to complain about in that turn of events. Draco pressed him against the desk, slid his other hand down so he could grip both of Harry’s hips, keeping him primly tucked between the edge of the desk and his own body, and kissed him harshly, drunk on his own sincerity, the reckless feel of it, the fact that it hadn’t pushed Harry away - it’d brought him closer, and they were kissing in broad daylight, even if in the privacy of the vacant classroom, and this
The clock dotted ten. They headed to Hogsmeade, calm and spare-worded under the narrow crescent moon. Draco was clad in black and grey once more; Pansy in smooth, deep navy. They searched the streets for a trace of them. Kettle Bottom, as well as the Three Broomsticks, were clear. When they were headed to check Hog’s Head, Finnigan’s sudden chirping made them halt.
It was Potter’s voice, and Draco whipped his head to the right, and there Harry was, in black jeans and a white shirt, black hair spiked up in a haphazard way, and
Harry slapped his hands together. It made a wet sound. ‘Alright, then, I’ll be off. You should know, Malfoy, that you spend your free time in wretched places.’
already, a little spot of precum, and Draco would never think about anything else in his fucking life - fabric of his underwear. 'You know,' Harry said between breaths, 'You win for me too. The- those fucking
him, let him blow him in a bathroom, but perhaps Leanne and himself were rebounds. After all, Draco had been so caught up in his own ecstasy that night that he wouldn’t have noticed if Harry was gripping his hair and wishing it red.
‘Morning, mate, how are you holding up?’ said Neville. His eyes were squinting compulsively, even in the tame winter sunlight. The trio sprawled in the seats next to Draco, all with their sighs of discomfort
shut up?' Harry groaned, all false bite, pulling on Draco's hair to guide their lips together again in something with a lot more tongue. There was a hunger there, not only Draco's but Harry's too, like he really wanted it, like he wanted
Because it felt more and more like a dream now, as the days went past. The first morning, yes, with an awful headache, a turbulent stomach and an eyesight that spun black each time he stood, he’d had no choice but to remember the previous night in each vivid, gruesome,
Hi, welcome to a fic mainly composed of winter nights out in Hogsmeade and Draco incessantly mooning over Harry. There is alcohol, there is candy, there is fluff, there is smut - that about sums it up.
It made Harry’s gaze snap in place. Made his jaw set, and Draco could see each nerve being pushed primly into position, untangled and unwound. No uncertainties: nothing but the confident mane of a lion.
Outside, there was a bout of hysterical laughter, then some thud against one of the walls. It was duller than the wind, presumably a snowball.
Harry let out a moan, rough and broken, fingers twisting in Draco's hair. It reminded Draco of their conversation during the dance, cowardly masked with talk of their hairs, a promise there regardless: Harry was the only one allowed to break his composure, Draco was the only one allowed to take care of him. The memory ran a streak of want through Draco, and he brought his hand up to rub Harry's right nipple between the soft pads of his fingers just to hear him moan again, to feel those fingers tug at his hair.
how he felt. Instead, with every step he took forward, his hesitante ebbed, and a sudden fury grew, a crushing wave of tension and rage, like she now incarnated Harry’s stubbornness on the field.
The classroom still smelled faintly of fumes from first period when Draco got there. The cauldrons hadn’t been cleaned properly - likely first years. It lifted the question: should Draco pick one out and prepare it? Would it seem eager, were he to start before Harry got there? Was it
Between Blaise’s scornful comments and Goyle’s persistent tugs at his wrist, they managed to get him into some fresh clothes and to the Great Hall for breakfast. At such an early hour there weren’t many students around, and he was able to eat in relative peace.
Ron actually laughed. It came out a hoarse, fleeting sound - Draco reckoned his throat still burnt as well.
he was being mocked, and he was caught in the most unbearable mix of arousal, frustration, vulnerability and
I’d forgotten about that,’ Draco murmured. Over Harry’s shoulder, he could see the little swirling motions on the mortar; he repeated them with his thumb on Harry’s hip.
‘The other thing?’ Harry questioned. At Draco’s stubbornly closed lips, his face cleared in realization and he rolled his eyes with a little smile. ‘You just want me to say it again, don’t you?’
Sure, Daily Prophet and other Newspapers of their Magical community are working relentlessly to capture, remind and broadcast the new age of tolerance and open-mindedness: essential changes and community values implemented to reinvent the society and Ministry of Magic at large, like a magnificent phoenix rising from the ashes.
More furious lip biting and pinched expression follows his bewildered query. “Ah, it was the only thing I could think of that makes some sense out of this.” At his incredulity, she hurries to clarify. “I mean, the left over Slytherins are obviously glowering at you. So, I thought maybe …” Hermione carefully trails off.
“I can’t believe you actually said that, Hermione! Playing a match against another House team is vastly different from playing with friends.”
Speaking of, where is the haughty git and rest of the Slytherins hiding anyway? What the hell is even going on? It feels a little extreme for a prank and more on the lines of an actual crisis or something. At least, Harry can count on Snape not partaking in any madness his favorite students could come up with. This leaves the only option that something weird went down in dungeons enough to warranty this grade A Houdini act.
if he and Draco were to ever get hitched and Harry has the misfortune of having Lucius Malfoy as his father-in-law.
Maybe, Draco should let Potter accidentally corner him, so the guy could get his freaking need to air out his suspicious, out of the way?
They engage in a casual, no-strings relationship – comforting and helping each other to forget about the big, bad world existing outside their space, if only for some time.
Of course, there is nothing stopping Harry from ditching his arguing friends to collect the map tight now. But the slight chance Malfoy (and his housemates, yes it’s not as though Harry forgot about them) might walk in through those gigantic doors any second keeps him rooted till the last possible second. He half-heartedly chews the toast and helps himself to the fruit, Hermione must have discreetly added to his plate when he’s busy brooding.
The enchanted ceiling reflecting clear blue skies with occasional cloud or two and birds resembling dark specks flying past is no different from any other day of this week. In fact, there is nothing explicitly telling within these huge walls that suggest anything out of ordinary even took place, except for the lone table in the corner with a pitiful amount of students huddling close and being uncharacteristically silent.
He immediately rebels the thought of ghosting Icarus … perhaps, he could simply increase the time between his messages instead of completely quitting stone-cold.
In fact, Harry finds it hard to maintain a passing curiosity or even his focus on the most mundane of tasks. A wave of apathy frequently crashes upon his consciousness, alternating with mind-numbing melancholy and hopelessness, bringing along the occasional anxiety for the ride.
So, it’s just towards Harry and his friends that Draco was possibly acting strangely or simply put, ignoring their existence. And honestly, it stings. After everything, especially the moment, Harry thought they had in his manor last year, he expected something else.
And, that’s how Harry found himself sporadically communicating with his anonymous fan and gradually getting better, as a result.
Although, their situations differ immensely from each other, Harry could not help but grieve on Icarus behalf thinking about how heartbroken the guy must have been to silently bear witness, as the person he loves slipped through his fingers and settled with someone else. He wants to immediately apologize for dredging up any smarting memories but thinks better of it.
That, Draco might have outgrown his need to challenge him at every turn is an extremely hard and bitter pill for him to swallow.
So, if anyone has a chance in hell of dragging the undisclosed information straight from the serpent’s mouth, it’s the trusted and kind badgers.
And yes, Harry had faced Voldemort several times head-on: also, battled death eaters, ferocious monsters and broke into and out of Gringotts while stealing a damn dragon among other things.
Hell, the poor guy probably is unable to say no to Harry at this point, genuinely fearing for his general functionality. Maybe, he should reduce his dependence on Icarus and give him a break?
His attempts to sneak inside the hospital wing are thwarted thanks to additional security measures employed by apparently, Dumbledore himself.
Draco feels a familiar piercing gaze directed towards him and has to forcibly stamp down his habituated instinct to look up and meet the intense emerald gaze from the opposite corner of the entrance hall.
So, yeah, Harry knows Icarus is around his age…maybe older by an year or two, lives farther on the South side (perhaps France or Spain) or at least at the time of their communication, he thinks. Other than that, Harry comes up with a blank for any information actually useful to build a persona.
Hermione spares an understanding glance his way, carrying on with the still ongoing verbal battle as he spots the nondescript messenger owl flying towards him. With shaking hands, Harry detaches the disappointingly thin letter from the owl’s outstretched leg.
“What does our evening practice have anything to do with the Slytherins playing a twisted version of hide and go seek today?”
The light glinting off the few golden plates and glasses filled with scrumptious offerings in front of the meager bunch of odd first and second year students decked in silver and green scarves, food mostly untouched drives home how serious this entire situation is. Something really fishy is going on and the mystery of it is driving Harry spare.
At least, that’s what Draco derives from the bloody chicken scratches, made even more illegible through his sheer passion and terror, noticeably experienced while penning it down. That these words drip of yearning and an inexhaustible source of love for the person, Potter’s evidently pining after is clear as the fucking clouds on a stormy day.
The remaining Death Eaters were swiftly apprehended and sentenced after Voldemort’s corpse is locked up to rot in some dark corner of the Department of Mysteries.  Harry had to attend a lot of these trials as a special guest of honor along with Ron and Hermione, although he only spoke in defense of Mrs. Malfoy and Draco at their trial.
All Draco needs to do is hide his identity and then curb out certain essential elements of his personality from getting caught red-handed on the anonymous charmed parchment.
Still, it’s only a gratitude note proving Draco is successful in his quest of assembling the perfect gift. He sends a nonchalant reply back, claiming coincidence for their ownership and not deliberately acquired.
Though, to be honest all he does is rant, whine and seek advice from a patient guy, who is somehow, yet to grow sick of Harry’s never ending list of troubles.
“Didn’t you guys hear?” Lavender Brown leans forward, a few seats away from their lot, her blue eyes shining brightly in unmasked glee. “Padma Patel, Parvathi’s twin sister was saying earlier–”
The solemn moment is however shattered when Parvathi offhandedly remarks, contradicting her friend. “Yeah. But Padma also said those students were awake for thirty hours straight and counting at that time, running some experiment and prone to hallucinations as a side-effect. Plus, I heard from Susan in Hufflepuff that hospital wing is temporarily closed due to some repairs.”
Not that he’s worried the boy wonder would draw his wand on him – Potter clearly matured to react childishly akin to few years ago.
Beside Harry, Hermione murmurs rather sharply under her breath. “We all know who Padma is, Lavender.” Although, Harry is pretty sure he’s the only one who heard her sarcastic comment. Still, he is rather intrigued by Brown’s opening statement and pays complete attention to the notorious gossiper’s words.
Draco’s life is already complicated enough with all the wretched drama, plus a gut-wrenching stress of trying to get over several years’ worth of feelings for Potter within few months.
An almost wounded howl greet her scandalized words, Dean Thomas and Seamus being the loudest of the bunch.
Harry, himself couldn’t care less though, staying quiet and on sidelines of the wildly escalating discussion. He simply tunes out the outrage and frankly good points made by his friends, choosing rather to gaze at the rare clear and cloudless sky of the enchanted ceiling, mentally counting down the time.
Dismayed by the palpable refusal from Icarus, although why he is still surprised when Icarus has time and again, persisted in staying clear of his efforts to engage as an emotional confidant, is anybody’s guess?
He uses left hand to write the letters (grateful about his natural ambidextrous skill) - the fear of getting caught in the lie, always at the forefront in his mind.
Harry blurts out, wanting further validation. “Really? And no one has any idea what could be up with those lot? Not even the Hufflepuffs?”
Draco’s personal conflict and anguish notwithstanding, Potter deserves to have a happy ending, after all the shit he was forced to go through in his life. Granted, Draco himself never made Potter’s life any easier or less stressful, but god if he isn’t going to stop continuing in his younger self’s path.
All he did was end a monster’s attempt at world domination, which was not even his lone effort. So, he would rather people stop treating him as the next Jesus freaking Christ,
It appears a tiny detail has been inadvertently ignored during his hectic years of fighting for survival - his undeniable attraction towards both genders. Apparently, appreciating asymmetrical features and fit bodies isn’t a strictly heterosexual attribute. More precisely, his type happens to be jocks, strong, smart and sarcastic people, preferably playing the seeker position and is very good at it.
This unlikely yet powerful alliance of Slytherin-Hufflepuff houses is the stuff of legends on par with and sometimes even surpassing the history of feuds Gryffindors share with the Pureblood propaganda house.
He is practically a saint, with his endless patience while dealing with Harry’s erratic mood-swings, calmly and patiently laying the (vague) facts Harry provided in a rational manner, so Harry would be able to draw a conclusion on his own.
Yes, surely then Potter would stop following him around like a kicked puppy and Granger will cease her narrowed stares, while her ginger boyfriend probably still wouldn’t halt aiming his drop-dead glares in Draco’s direction.
Enclosed within the carefully put together packet is a collection of newspaper articles pertaining to his fathers’ family accomplishments, photographs, including a small book on Potter’s family tree depicting their genealogy, as well as, his mother’s seventh year charms textbook with little notes written in her handwriting on the margins.
Slowly, he gathers bits and pieces about the unidentified writer, never sufficient enough for his tastes but just enough to befriend the guy and to form a warm attachment towards him.
Draco, however, is determined to end their conversation on a positive note for fucking once and swears to do his damn best to implement this impulsive decision effectively.
He falls back into his old habits or in this case, into the waiting hands of his ex-boyfriend, Blaise.
There are no secrets between the three of them, at least not for long and this time isn’t an exception either.
“The case of the missing Slytherins, mate. Sounds like the title of a bloody murder-thriller, ain’t it?” Dean cuts in before Harry could respond, a shrewd look thrown his way, “That’s all everyone seems to be talking about. Pretty sick stunt they pulled on rest of the school. Gotta say, those snakes are sodding good at this whole teamwork spirit.”
What he needs is an impartial party to weigh Harry’s apprehensions against the possible benefits and simply tells him what to do. Someone with personal experience dating guys and knows how to approach one with positive results.
Wouldn’t be the first time – the entire house is renowned for its frequent and collective crazy prank attempts on the rest of Hogwarts students. Nevertheless, the conspicuous lack of Slytherins (third years and above) including a certain blond git is too suspicious and rather alarming to be ignored. Ten minutes inside the great hall and this anomaly is impossible to avoid. And, Harry has a strong inkling that whatever this weirdness is supposed to be, it can be successfully traced back to the evil ingenious of his arch-rival, Draco Malfoy: also, wouldn’t be the first time.
Blaise, Pansy and others are making fun of the Gryffindors for whining loudly about being excluded from the Quidditch season. Theo is doing a perfect impression of Weasley gaping like a fish, aghast at his girlfriend’s staunch replies and
After all, Harry practically begged the elusive guy in his beseeching letter to submit a solution to his quandary, a week ago. And in few minutes, he will know whether Icarus chose to rise to the occasion or not.
Observing the perfect features on the beautiful, pale face morph into a small yet genuine smile, radiating with happiness - his insides clench painfully in intense disdain; the simple action pissing him off, more than any taunt from Malfoy ever did. Not because Harry is a giant twat. Au contraire, he enjoys seeing Draco let out the occasional smile and charming laughter instead of mean or smug smirks, he’s mostly used to get from the blond. Nonetheless, the fact these anomalies are stemming from someone else (due to Blaise sodding Zabini) is what’s bothering Harry the most.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “This is our second chance at education, Ron. We are actual adults allowed to return, so we could finish our N.E.W.T.S. It’s not as though you guys are banned from playing the game, you just can’t participate in the matches. I simply don’t see what the fuss is all about?”
People talk of tolerance and keeping an open-mind as though, they belong in pages of a fantasy book and not in the real world, where adults do not forget so easily and forgiveness isn’t an unusual a phenomenon as suffering a heatstroke in middle of Winter in Scotland is.
Seamus suddenly pipes up, next to his dark-skinned best friend. “Oi, you guys interested in starting a little betting pool?” He indicates a bunch of their classmates and few other Gryffindors from Ginny’s class, who immediately acknowledge them in varying degrees of interest. Surprisingly, Neville also seemed to take part in this betting madness.
Harry will approach Draco, albeit with caution, maybe implementing Hermione’s idea of sneakily venturing past his icy defenses to ask him out before the end of this year.
After briefly thanking Harry for returning his wand and speaking in favor of his mother and him, the usually snarky and infuriating blond maintained a radio silence upon returning to school.
Writing to Potter, Draco makes sure to install safe guidelines right from the start, to somewhat avoid the whole thing from blowing up in his face.
tone coming through. “Couldn’t you stop messing around for once? For all we know, something really horrible could have happened–”
He cracks another smile, catching Blaise’s knowing smirk and rolls his eyes in retaliation. The fucker knows better than to publicly engage him in conversations regarding the golden trio.
Doesn’t take a genius to put two and two together – the mandatory therapy every student has to attend playing a significant role in Potter doing something so out of character for him. Besides, it is probable for Draco as well, to blame sessions with the crazy, old coot for indulging this lunacy, instead of on his own foolishness.
Only time will reveal if Potter is capable of amnesty, he speaks so highly of and whether the strong winds of the Gryffindor's compassion is sufficient to put out the flames on Draco’s wings.
And … Harry is back to spacing out the impromptu sermon. His mind busy trying to consider every ghastly conspiracy theory he could think and soon defying as preposterous.
After all, he has confirmation from the Lion’s mouth itself that Draco doesn’t stand a fucking chance.
Normally, he would hesitate to write to a complete stranger – one, who clearly isn’t comfortable revealing their name and gave no indication in prolonging their brief exchange. Perhaps, because of these very reasons, Harry finds it easy to express his thoughts after initial awkwardness in their letters.
He glances habitually towards the blond (thankfully now conversing with others!) and his table again, sighing every time it hits how many students have turned up against general expectations.
Although, it is relatively easy to conclude Potter finds him attractive, he knows nothing will ever come out of it.
Or maybe, Draco is too much like his pseudonym Icarus - caught up in a horde of false hopes and misplaced optimism, fanning an undying need to be close to Potter’s incandescent presence that he invariably gets too close, forgetting he is tainted with the consequences of his previous bad choices.
He had no idea how someone managed to procure all these uncommon items, but to be given this greatest gift when Harry literally never had much to remember his family by, felt like a dream come true. He penned down a hastily scrawled
“-Two of her younger housemates swear they saw Snape escorting a large group of Slytherins to the hospital wing last night. Rumor has it that Madam Pomprey even closed the wing due to full house and initiated the procedure to activate a temporary medical wing on the second floor for emergencies. It seems this kind of action was last performed when a major outbreak of Spanish flu was rampant.”
His mind healer encouraging communication to broaden horizons and to accept help from impartial third parties, somehow ending up with him reaching out to his reluctant admirer.
Not that Harry blames Ron. Sometimes, he starting to gather, it is better to remain oblivious and safe from these kinds of dangerous thoughts evading senses. He would love to trade places but knows this ship sailed a long time ago. Particularly from the exact moment a specific pompous git strolled up to him and casually offered his hand in friendship which Harry rejected, forming an instant life-long rivalry with the said bastard in all his eleven year old glory. All good, no regrets … just a major pain in ass, though.
Harry goes to his chest and pulls out a ratty t-shirt and pair of jeans, throwing them to Ron. "We're going to try the circle thing Hermione was talking about. Can you draw a bunch of circles on these?"
“Oh!” Mrs. Weasley exclaims, turning around from where she’s levitating the dirty dishes. “No, of course not, dear. You can go off and play Gobstones with the others if you’d like.”
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” Potter responds coolly, keeping his hands in his lap.
Draco rolls his eyes. “No, he’s younger than me. Sometimes he shows up during playtime, but he always disappears before Mum- Mother and Father come in.”
His socked foot touches his missing trainer as he sits down but he can't bring himself to put it back on. If his time travel works like that woman Hermione told him about, he'll be aging soon, and he'll probably outgrow everything. He didn't go so far into the past to die immediately once he got back like that Elo-whatsit lady, but seventy or so years on top of his eleven will definitely make him an old man, and they'll probably make him leave Hogwarts and live somewhere else.
"Yes! It's Professor Snape, sir. At Halloween he started walking with a limp, and we think he was injured by the three headed dog."
“The best I can do for you is to not tell you what I know about your future. One time I went to the future and someone told me I was going to do something terrible, but wouldn’t tell me what it was. He said if he told me, I wouldn’t do it, but that it needed to happen. I didn’t like it then and I don’t like it now, but I understand what he meant. Knowledge of the future is dangerous. Maybe I shouldn’t have mentioned that we’re friends, maybe I shouldn’t have gotten to know you at all. But maybe it was important. Only you will be able to determine that, and only after the fact.”
Immediately after that, the blonde began to undress. Harry's body twitched as did his dick when he saw the lean but muscular body of the pure-blood wizard. White skin in the light of the moon falling from the windows reflected on the milky complexion and evoked the feeling of meeting an angel.
He made up his to mind to seek help from his godfather. He knocked on Snape's office and didn't wait for her to ask him in.
- "It's not me Severus !! Potter parades with his bare body in front of the whole school and no one notices it! I am not hallucinating....." - he took a deep breath and looked at his godfather hopefully - "You saw him too, right? - Snape shook his head and smiled, which was not normal. The blonde felt as if the Potions Master had treated him like a child.
- "For this I urge the professor to look at what Longbottom is doing, which will most likely lead to the castle exploding, which no one would have survived." - The Potions Master did not want to argue, as he stated that his arrogance was caused by hallucinations and he was unable to determine with what dignity he was dealing with.
McGonagall, who passed by, had to wipe her glasses because she hadn't expected Lucius Malfoy to be so treated.
- " Just do it!" - Draco's low self-control went fuck. White underpants reached his ankles. At that point world could spot the 9-inch pale monstrosity with flowing veins like a river bouncing up and down and as hard as a rock with leaking pre-cum on top. As Harry spotted an enormous boner, got goosebumps at once. Draco instantly spread his legs as far as possible. Potter imagined he would get what he'd wanted so badly for the past few minutes. He was not much wrong. The pale hand gripped a huge prick and directed straight against Griffindor's tight entrance.
-"Mr. Malfoy, Thank you for presenting your sound effects and I would ask you to go to the hospital wing to see if your limbs are fully functional " - Pure-blood huffed and stood up saying:
- "You look more sinful than usual" - Slytherin pushed further, and green-eyed felt his hole stretched slightly and opened for a tall young nobleman. - "Ohh God! You are so tight and perfect."
Immobilized Snape did not register it and obeyed the godson's will. When they got there, Draco saw Potter leaning against the pillar. His brain registered an image of Griffindor's shapely hips. This view should be banned. Malfoy looked away from the captivating sight, as he felt his prick begin its activity. Ohhh how he would like to put his paws on them and open those legs properly. Then Draco spoke:
- "I am all yours, pleaseee.." - The last time Prince of Slytherin used his belt, it hit Griffindor's flushed back as hard as possible.
The Slytherin followed the visually impaired griffindor as if mesmerized. His eyes were glued to his firm cheeks. Slender and lean calves, as well as shapely hips, caused arousal shivers down pure-blood's spine. These parts of the body just begged to be touched with their appearance. Malfoy had to hold back from lunging and raping him. Slytherin's dull eyes registered that they were at the bottom of the castle, where they could easily reach the dungeons. Everything was working as planned.
It was too much for an excited aristocrat. His crush, which he has been dreaming about for the last three years, wants to suck him off. He couldn't miss it. Draco bit his lip when he saw Griffindor's ass. He couldn't take his eyes off his firm cheeks.
Harry was almost breathless as he saw Malfoy's hand begin to unbuckle the belt, and with a swift, sweeping motion, the pants reached the ankles. Potter felt his saliva drip from his face, his cock slowly vibrated and the hole was about to itch.
Harry held his air. The mask of emotionlessness collapsed and Severus' face showed consternation and disgust. Fortunately for him, the bell rang. Ignoring the students, he ran out of the classroom, his robes waving majestically and hitting them against the faces of Hermione Granger and several Griffindors, leaving and contemplating a change of profession.
Malfoy's hand stopped squeezing the cheeks and tightened around the boy's head. He pushed the chosen one down. Harry tried to slow his heart down, but knew this would be impossible with pure-blood.
- "Draco, I understand that you are a teenager and at the time there is a hormone storm and you are obsessed with Mr. Potter. But I don't want to be heard about your sexual fantasies."
The green-eyed man leaned forward almost lying on the desk, when the blond stopped at the edge of the pieces of wood, and the hard prick stood calmly between his legs.
- "Malfoy, stop ..." Harry muttered as he felt the Slytherin's cold lips make wet kisses against his neck. He did not have the strength to push off the attacker. His legs gave out on him, and he could swear it was the best feeling he had experienced since he was born. Eager Draco flung weakened Potter onto the nearest desk and climbed on the top of him. For the next seconds, Harry's shirt was torn apart by skilful hands, so that a certain nobleman was able to make out a slightly muscled stomach from Quidditch practices. Keeping in touch with reality became mock as chalk-white teeth were digging into his collarbone leaving red marks and emotion beyond words. His hands tightened around the edge of the desktop, and skin burned with live fire, along with dried throat.
How he regretted that Veritaserum game - it would have been much safer to say he’d hated him as well and leave it at that. Then again, Harry surely ought to know by now that he had
. It made Draco ache with the wish to be the one to introduce him to everything and to assure his first times were the best they could be, because no one in the world would ever care for him as much as Draco; because Draco knew him better than anyone, better than Granger and Weasley, because he’d seen his darkness; because Draco didn’t have that much experience but no one loved Harry as much as him, no one would strive to please as much as him, no one would kiss him as urgently or touch him as sincerely. Because Draco had been wishing for a chance for years, and if only Harry granted him it, if only he allowed Draco to
that was, to make sure he spent his money wisely instead of wasting it in his most ferociously Gryffindor accesses of inconsequentiality.
Potter would know. Right now, in ten, twenty seconds, he'd know. He'd surely look at Draco, and Draco daredn't look at him, which meant he'd be with his back turned as he was subjected to the brief scrutiny, and Potter would see only the grey of his peacoat and the slick silver in his hair - and with no chance to show him any warmth, any mildness through a stare or a tweak of lips, what could Potter ever think besides Malfoy, dark, death?
‘Well, good luck with that,’ Harry snorted; then, with something amused twinkling in his eyes, ‘Oh, and watch out for Ginny. She really is cross.’
The hiss of the whistle was heard; the commotion of broomsticks above them stopped in abrupt silence.
'I'm gonna head back in,' Potter shuffled between his feet, staring at Draco in that little amused way of his, 'Will you join me, or are you going to stay here and freeze?'
The other part of him - a twisted, proud part - wanted to parade Harry around the room, their arms primly entwined, and show all those ghosts the most mesmerizing person they'd seen in their centuries of existence.
‘Yes, it did,’ Draco conceded, his tone softer. He looped Harry’s waist completely, linking his fingers on his lower back, and spoke a shivering inch from his lips. ‘We should do it again. In school. Let everyone know.’
Draco sighed. It was a much less charming apology than he was used to, all stunted, awkward sincerity, and he really should have insisted on doing it in a more appropriate time.
Kettle Bottom was the same as always, immersed in its unwavering aesthetic, dipped in photographic permanence. Red lights, Blodwyin Bludd’s rough vocals rumbling like tight waves near the floor and up the dark walls, uncoordinated bodies pressed together and the heady scent of alcohol sticky in the air. Draco had quite warmed up to the place; it felt natural, squeezing his way through the crowd and planting his elbows on the bartop.
The following Sunday, a Healer arrived on the train. He was old, severe, a hunched shadow swallowed in black robes, and it was the shared opinion of the school that, judging by his solemn appearance, Harry’s injuries were awfully serious.
But dark roots don’t smother themselves. They fester. Draco could never turn back. No, he wasn’t that selfless - he’d cling tooth and nail until Harry cut him off himself.
‘What on earth was that about?’ asked Dean, at the same time as Finnigan said ‘That was a lot more than one question.’
They’d left the bottle on the vanity, however. Draco bit his lip, released it with a hiss as he caught the swollen flesh, and maintained his gaze resolutely on the rotten ceiling as he spoke:
His smile was slow and curious; he probably expected some mildly amusing truth, something quick to move on from. Draco wanted to provide him that. Wanted to make him laugh with something innocently awkward. But he thought about it, looked back at the moment they were all gathered in the Tapestry Corridor, and there’d been only one reason he’d gone, one reason that made him the one who’d spoken first, broken the circle and volunteered. He hadn’t wanted to do it - it was, like Harry had said, a fucking
that,' Draco snapped, batting her hand away from his hair. When he looked up at her, she was smirking.
‘You’re terribly uptight, Malfoy,’ he said, and then he was standing, shrugging off of Draco’s coat and leaving for the dancefloor, Dean Thomas’s arm flung over his shoulders.
Draco sighed. ‘All potions have downsides,’ he uttered before coaxing Harry up again - by the hair, always by the hair, because there was nothing he loved more than to graze fingers across Harry’s scalp and hear him moan as he felt the slight sting; moving him around like that, seeing that oxymoron of pliant and rebellious, feeling Harry’s
'Well, first we open you up,' Draco smirked, pressing one last wet kiss to Harry's painted lips before pulling away. 'Which means your slacks need to be off.'
‘Are they-’ she trailed off, laying a bejeweled hand on Harry’s shoulder. ‘Hi, everyone. Hi, Pansy. I love your hair.’
Seriously, the amount of headcanons I have about the night life in Hogsmeade has taken over my life.
‘They don’t. They resent you, they like you and they have no bloody idea how to act around you unless they’re drunk.’
‘I won’t be a selfless tutor,’ Draco indulged himself by kissing those lewd lips softly, almost reverently, swiping his thumbs over sore hips. ‘I’ll expect you to suck up to me.’
,’ he urged, but he was laughing himself, reeling with the insanity of the situation. He ought to be in some kind of dream, really, unfolding like a comedy in his mind. It was dreadfully inconvenient for his arousal, and he tried to muffle himself against the warm skin of Harry’s neck.
‘Such terrible, terrible moods,’ Blaise sighed, long and pronounced, and then he was opening the door, revealing the spectral bustling inside.
'It's alright, I don't like some of your friends either,' Draco replied with a smirk. 'Did you like your date?'
No. Discomfort brought by pessimism. Draco had pined for years, and he was used to the frustration of unrequited love. But he was
He thought of how near Harry’s face had been to his, how challenging his eyes had been, because he’d always needed some motivation before admitting to his mistakes.
Draco, who’d been inspecting the little lumps that had formed on the surface - Harry had been too rash in untangling the Gillyweed - looked up at him.
Draco shifted in his place. He could see a stripe of gauze wrapped tightly around one of Harry’s biceps, disappearing under the covers.
told anyone?’ Harry snapped back. The potion had gone neon pink - past its point. Draco didn’t feel much inclined to take it off the flame.
It was like something burst; something Ron kept primly contained. Suddenly, there was red fury, unwavering, jaw set, eyes that pinned Draco in place, and Draco finally saw how he fit with Harry and Hermione.
His coat was still dangling limply from the other stool. The idea of putting it on, of sharing Harry’s warmth, was so decadent he daredn’t do it. Instead, he simply stared at it, picturing the way it had contrasted against Harry’s pale skin just a moment ago.
'They haven't looked,' she noted, glancing at the group before taking a sip of her drink, 'Shall we go and greet them?'
The conversation went on - Luna, Draco thought absently, had asked some question. But Draco wasn’t listening in the slightest, because his body was nearly entirely faced towards Harry, and he was trying with all his strengths to reign back the longing in his voice and replace it with something akin to amusement when he spoke:
Thomas finally noticed Draco, then. There was one distinctive second of confusion, and Draco schooled his features, were he told to leave, but Dean simply nodded, once, twice, and stretched an arm toward him, showing him a jumble of cans.
Meanwhile, in the game a new round of firewhiskey had been ordered, and an awfully embarrassing question must have been asked, since half of the table was either blushing or choking on hurried sips of their drink, but Draco really didn’t care what it had been. He turned his attention to Sue, whose bronze-charmed hair and electric blue lipstick easily branded her a Ravenclaw.
‘Alright. Alright, yeah, I’ll forget about it,’ she said, voice still overly gentle, clearly trying to suppress her curiosity. She didn’t move either; they drank their wizard’s brew in tense silence.
? But Harry had a strange aura around him - he made Draco’s world small and focused, and every concern washed out faced with the sheer frustration, the unexplainable comfort, the unique
‘Harry, I wonder - I was asking this to Draco just the other day, actually - who’s planning to fuck whom in this darling relationship of yours?’
‘You’re the teacher,’ Harry reminded, running a spoon through the viscous pink fluid. ‘Is it too bad, do you think?’
Draco stayed quite far from the infirmary, but Pansy passed by and told him it was littered with nosy twits. Visits had been cancelled, yet they loitered by the door all the same.
Draco snorted. ‘You do know that there’s a whole world outside of Hogwarts, don’t you? I mean, you saved it, love, you’re allowed to live in it now.’
He handed Harry the stupid bag, and started towards the door. Harry’s voice, somewhat rushed, as if he’d spoken on impulse, made him pause midway.
'You said, the night I blew you, that alcohol and sex didn't mix well,' Draco reminded, a gentle hand taming Harry's hair. It was hopeless: the boy looked incredibly dishevelled, and obviously in post-orgasmic bliss. Draco wasn't sure if he wanted to share this side of Harry with the crowd downstairs; no, he wanted to keep Harry in his arms and kiss him until his fire was back and his hips had stopped twitching. 'Do you feel ready to go? I can tell the arsehole to wait another minute.'
‘Will you say please then, too?’ he teased, tone pitched low with hunger. The vision formed before him so perfectly: Harry panting with his legs spread, burning and wet - so wet, because Draco would open him up slowly, carefully, memorizing every filthy sound from the lube on his fingers and Harry’s hole. Harry begging so sweetly, trusting him so completely, a lion choosing not to bite but to be bitten, to relish in the bruises, to wait until the pain spiralled into pleasure. And Harry convulsing around him; moaning in the crook of his neck, thighs shivering, hot and tight and all for him. Draco would make it so good, an unforgettable first time, the fucking best Harry would ever have. Years to come and they might be apart, but Harry would fuck and remember how he himself had taken it so sweetly; be fucked and remember Draco’s hips pistoning into him.
Pain thrummed inside Draco; a clench of muscle, a high-pitched agony. He stared at the stone walls, the reckless tower of bottles behind the bar, the round Adam's apple of some stranger quivering as he finished his drink in a succession of inelegant gulps - everywhere except Pansy's eyes, who seemed now, with the dim, red lighting of the pub, bottomless black.
‘Slytherin,’ Draco answered. Honestly, one ought to think the Malfoy legacy would at least save him from silly questions like that.
Harry pulled away further, a little grin on his face, his cheeks flushed from the cold, and tapped Draco’s chest with both his hands.
She grinned widely, redirecting steam from freshly heated water through a series of pipes and heard the satisfying whistle and even more satisfying thump of Draco falling off the bed.
Luckily Flitwick just nods and continues giving out the homework assignment while Harry makes his escape. He barely reaches the corridor and throws on the invisibility cloak before the discomfort reaches its peak and he disappears. Luckily Ron or Hermione know to take his things with them when he doesn't show back up.
"Can I...can I hug you? At home when someone's sad we kind of, lay on top of them?" Ron says. "Or d'you want to be alone? I wish 'Mione were here," he adds, almost to himself.
"Harry," he murmurs, and Harry picks up a handful of rocks to present to this new adult. He's seen a lot of new adults in the past week, and this one seems nice.
which looked like it would never clean anything, a regular broom, a bucket full of rags, and some jars labeled cleaning solution. Besides that were the stairs up to what Harry presumed were the bedrooms.
"Nah, Dad'll be fine," Ron says. "You've seen how he is with his work. Though I s'pose we should tell Mum at least, in case you disappear during dinner and she worries."
“S-sit down?” Dobby whispers. “Sit down?” Dobby turns away from Harry, sobbing so loudly that everyone downstairs must hear it.
Harry recoils as if Draco has hexed him, and Draco looks up to notice that his scar is indeed missing. He’s probably glamouring it so that Draco won’t recognize him, like the liar he is.
“Well, not very far in the future. The furthest I've traveled into the future was two years or so, and that’s already in my past. But I guess most of my life is in your future.” He runs a hand through his messy hair, messing it up further. “It’s quite confusing.”
"I'm not incapable of other magic, and Pansy is particularly good at cursebreaking by nature. But," he sighed. "You're welcome to go elsewhere to find someone better to break your curse." He was surprised to find that he didn't want Harry to leave. He'd grown used to having the old man around, and although he knew he'd leave when they broke the curse anyway, he hoped he wouldn't leave earlier.
Their eyes go wide when he tells them about younger Dumbledore who was already a Hogwarts Professor, and what 1920s Paris was like, not that he saw much of it before he was pulled back into the present.
"Blimey, I thought we'd starve before you came back. Do you know it’s already halfway through lunch?" Ron says, and then sees Harry's face. "What happened? You look like you need to sit down." He guides Harry back to the chair he’d sat in what feels like ages ago, and Harry can feel himself trembling in Ron’s grasp.
"Right." Harry relaxes and listens to Ron talk about the Chudley Cannons, pointing at the colourful moving posters lining his walls.
Harry looks around the room, trying to get more context. The room is covered in richly coloured flowery wallpaper, complete with bees buzzing from flower to flower against the dark backdrop. There's a fancy, marble fireplace on the wall near him, a low fire burning even though it's very warm in the room. And, there, in the corner, is that-? It looks like Dumbledore! He's talking to some other wizards and witches Harry doesn't recognize. They're all holding drinks, but again it doesn't seem to be a celebration. He remembers the wizards near him talking about "our side." Is this the war with Voldemort before he was born? Another one completely?
The professor barely glances into the boy's cauldron before declaring, "A smashing success, my boy." The room quiets expectantly as the professor continues on, gesturing expansively. "Of course, I could expect no less, now, could I Tom, after you saved us all."
Harry shakes his head and settles down in the chair facing Dumbledore’s desk. There are a lot of interesting things to look at in order to avoid the Headmaster’s piercing gaze.
. The old man had found a working broomstick and was doing loop-de-loops fast enough to stop Draco's heart.
“But you said we were friends in the future,” he points out, disappointed that Harry doesn't recognize him.
Once the crowds have died down he decides to head up to his dormitory to write this all down in his journal before he heads to Herbology, where Ron and Hermione have hopefully taken his things. It was a pretty boring trip, but he thinks the professor or the student, Tom, are important somehow. Or what he did for the school. Does it have something to do with the Philosopher's Stone? Or a dark wizard?
Behind him, Pansy made a face at Teddy. Ever since Harry's curse had lifted, Draco had become a complete sap. Teddy had seen them kissing in the upstairs hallway when he'd come back from visiting home early one day, but they didn't know he knew, and were still careful not to be too lovey-dovey in front of him.
Most worrying is the sound of a beast snarling, and Harry can all too easily picture its eyes glaring angrily and its jaw snapping. Part of him wants to help whoever is being snarled at, and although he's wandless and in an unknown corridor, he takes a few steps forward. Before he can go too far, he hears a deep voice cursing Hagrid's love of ridiculous creatures and a door clicking closed, silencing the beast.
“Merlin and Morgana!” Draco exclaims, turning to face him. “Weren’t you ever taught not to sneak up on people who were clearly busy?”
His dad opens his mouth to respond, but his mum elbows him in the side with a grin and gestures towards Dumbledore, who's starting to address everyone.
“And this has nothing to do with the fact that you could remember this in the future and bet on the score with your friends?”
"No!" Harry exclaims. "I--Dumbledore told me not to tell anyone about it, not even Ron and Hermione. But we thought, in case I need to travel while I'm staying here..."
"It's beautiful," he declares, still turning the ring round and round Harry's finger, watching the emeralds emerge from the wand again and again.
Harry nods. It makes sense, and once he can do those spells things will be much easier, except... "What about my shoe?"
"He's not supposed to change the timeline, Ron," Hermione reminds them, as if they've forgotten the fifty other times she's said that. Well, Harry hasn't at least. It's ingrained in his brain now.
Draco’s dorm-mates seem to have no trouble sleeping, but he is still lying awake, missing the comfort of home and wondering how Potter could have rejected him. They are supposed to be friends, best friends. It’s something he’s looked forward to as he grew up, the time he’d meet Harry and be practically guaranteed a friend. They know things about each other, they play well together, Harry said they’re friends, but he just doesn’t understand what went wrong!
"A week ago, sir. When Master is going to Hogwarts, sir. Dobby is not returning with him. Master is angry at Harry Potter."
“I can’t change the past,” Harry says, and a few tears escape his eyes, their paths shining in the wandlight. Malfoy men don’t cry, but apparently Potters do. It seems that Draco is finally seeing the real Harry Potter, the one who lies and demands his attention and is weak, undeserving of all the special treatment he’s gotten just for his name.
, Harry tells his body, but his skin hasn't started feeling tight-loose by the time the wand rounds the corner, Professor Snape attached to it.
"I'm afraid the headmaster has been called away on urgent business to the ministry. You'll have to speak with him when he returns."
"There's so much to catch up on," Hermione says, breathless. "I can't believe exams are only a week away."
“But Harry wears a belt all the time,” Ron points out. “So I think he wouldn’t even have this issue if the belt was the key.”
“Fine, do what you want,” the wizard replied instead. “It’ll take more energy to get rid of you than I’m willing to allocate. And it’s Draco,” he added, sweeping out of the manor door without so much as a look back or a goodbye.
Things were a little awkward after that, because Harry had fixed up the whole manor and didn't have much to do. Sometimes he learned magic right alongside Teddy, but he had a knack for sweet-talking the spell into doing what he wanted it to do instead of following the instructions, so Teddy told him to go do something else.
“It says you need him to remind you you’re beautiful and he needs you to remind him he’s young. Maybe if he wakes up with you in his arms you’ll both get the reminders you need.”
“So, what, my magic’s gone rogue? Shouldn’t there be, I dunno, some way to control it? Make it so I can travel when and where I want, and not have it interrupt a study session?”
Harry's skin itches. He squirms in his seat, trying to stave off the inevitable, but he always travels relatively quickly after the symptoms start.
Harry didn’t come for his birthday, after all. Suddenly he wants to cry, but he blinks really hard to stop himself because
“Offend Dobby?” Dobby says, turning around with glistening eyes. “Dobby thought that Master Harry was kind when Dobby first met Master Harry but never has Dobby been asked to sit down by a wizard.”
, not the chimney or the hearth stones or the grate. He ignored the kid openly laughing at him, and hobbled over to sit back down in the chair. Up close he could see a face in the flames, red eyes and blue-white grin. “You knew I was under a mmm- what happened to me. Last night. You said.”
Harry crouched down in front of Draco, his knees cracking and popping like pine logs. He reached up to grasp Draco's wrists and pulled them away from his face. "I'm sorry," he said, more openly than Pansy could ever remember hearing anyone apologize before (although maybe that said something more about Draco and Teddy than Harry, she wasn't sure). "I should have known you would be sensitive about those kinds of comments. Teddy told me they all came from some miscommunication with his dad and that you let them be so you wouldn’t have to deal with comments from Godric’s Hollow as much.”
With that reassurance, he begins to look around himself in interest. The classroom looks similar in some respects, enough that Harry knows it's the potions classroom at Hogwarts, but none of the students nor the professor look familiar to him. It could be the past or the future, for all he knows; the professor is a tall, portly man dressed in an expensive looking waistcoat, similar in style to Flitwick's outfits. He has light coloured eyes, blond hair that's darker than Malfoy's but just as shiny, and a strawberry blond mustache. He's going around the room checking over everyone's potions and giving out either encouragement or pity, depending on what he sees.
Harry pauses at that, and snakes a hand out of his cloak so that it looks as if it's floating with his head. "Well we know it's not Snape. I guess it could be Flamel or Dumbledore. Dumbledore would've given it to me when we met, though, wouldn't he have? In case I traveled again before Christmas?"
He tries to whisper a word in Parseltongue but it doesn't come. He guesses he has to be in front of a snake for it to work.
! His eyes alighted on the shelf behind him. The suspiciously new looking shelf made of a fresh plank of wood and no longer tilting precariously.
They'd never had such fun days before Harry, Teddy thought. There were days off, but they were for going home or for staying in the manor to answer the door when Draco was out on business. They'd never taken a day off to just relax like this, and Teddy couldn't help but be excited over how much their little family had grown and changed over the past few months. Yes, the Lord of the Waste was still out there, but Teddy was coming to understand that there would always be bad people in the world, and it was his job as an apprentice wizard to put good magic into the world to combat it.
There are footsteps, and then an old man with dark robes and wire rimmed glasses is staring at him from down the path.
“I’m old enough to call the house elves now,” he warns. “And my parents are just outside that door.” He brandishes his quill like a wand, pointed at the intruder menacingly, although the shaking in his hand ruins the effect. “Who are you?”
“Buying my supplies? Erm, well, I had never been to London before, so it was my first time at Diagon Alley, and it was amazing. I had no idea you could buy all of those things. I didn’t have a cauldron or anything, so I got everything on the list, oh, and Gringotts. It was my first time in Gringotts. Um… It took a while for my wand to choose me, but don’t worry about that, you’ll be fine.”
“What?” he said as Pansy coughed out a shower of sparks. (“I just cleaned those bricks,” Harry tutted at her.) “I
Thankfully, no one present comments on it, and he leads his friends back to the common room to show them the hilarious clipping of Arthur Weasley and discuss the Heir of Slytherin.
“Then how am I supposed to change the future? If everything has already happened in your life, then mine is predetermined, at least up to the point of however old you are, if not longer.”
He met her eyes with a little self deprecating smile. “He reverts to his real age when he’s sleeping. His real hair color is black, did you know? He’s- he’s beautiful, and he doesn’t even try, Pans.”
“Are you Wizard Malfoy?” Harry asked. The man didn’t answer, even as he moved toward Harry, flicking a hand toward him which pushed him and his chair away from the hearth. “Hey!” he wheezed, hands clutched on the arms of the chair as his heart thumped erratically.
"I…" He screws his eyes shut to avoid looking at his seemingly normal hands which feel anything but. Maybe if he just sits still and focuses on his breathing, the feeling will pass. He thinks his friends are saying something else but all he can hear is a rushing, staticky sound in his ears.
?" They remind him somehow of Harry's and he does not want to be reminded again of the other timeline in which he and Harry are friends. Somehow his mouth keeps talking as his thoughts go down a gnome hole, and he stupidly adds, "I didn't know you could read."
Teddy approached him, pushing his hair aside to stare at his curse scar with a kind of terrified wonder.
Pansy's waving became frantic pointing, and Teddy turned around to finally catch them kissing in the open.
Harry carefully folds the cloak and returns to opening his presents. In addition to chocolate frogs from Ron, a wooden flute from Hagrid, and a 50-pence piece from the Dursley's, he's also got a hand-knitted jumper with an H on it from Mrs. Weasley and a journal from Hermione. Hermione's note says that he should use it to write down what happens when he travels, in case something happens that's important but he doesn't realize at the time. 'The journal will only open for the magical signatures you tell it to,' her note reads, 'so it can be as private as you want.' She goes on to say that of course, it's probable that a highly trained witch or wizard might be able to open it, but it's more private than a muggle journal. Harry guesses he'll take her word for it, as he never had one before.
"I just like fixing things," Harry told him a month into his business, after Teddy asked if he ever got bored doing the same projects all the time.
A quick summary of his summer: his friends haven’t owled him all summer, and he’s always hungry. He’s only time traveled once, to Tom the Slytherin again. Tom was somewhere Harry didn’t recognize, a bit younger than the previous time Harry had visited him, and he was crouched in the grass, talking to a snake. Harry wrote the conversation down in his journal, but it was boring and he still doesn’t understand what information he’s supposed to get from that.
"There you are," he drawls, trying not to sound as if he just spent twenty minutes looking for them. "Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall this whole time? I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny." Speaking of that newspaper clipping his father just sent him… "And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
"This is the best house I've ever been to," Harry tells Ron, looking around his friend's bedroom. He arrived at the Burrow early that morning when Ron, Fred, and George rescued him from his barred up room in their father’s flying car, and Mrs. Weasley has just let them go upstairs after spending the morning de-gnoming the garden.
And he looks just like Harry - his Harry. The same messy black hair, brown skin, glass bottle green eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, and he must have missed the scar before.
Harry sits down with a sigh and half a smile that grows as he keeps talking. "You always ask such difficult questions. Being in love is like… always wanting to be around them even when you don't. It's laughing at bad jokes and telling them to make the person you love laugh. It's sneakily casting warming charms even when h- they insist they're not too cold, because you want to make them happy. It's a warm feeling in your heart when you see them or think about them. It can be difficult, but so far I have to say it's worth it."
"Not very long, I'd imagine. She felt the effects immediately and-" she hesitates, "she died within a day. Harry, when did you travel to?"
Harry's stomach turns over. "I'm going to bed," he tells his friends, but he lays awake even after all of his roommates fall asleep.
He knows he did not live up to his father's expectations last year. Granger took top marks in their year, Potter refused his friendship and made the quidditch team while Draco wasn't even allowed to try out. Draco did lead the Slytherins in his year, but that was hardly impressive; he's ruled over most of them since they were babies.
"I call a rematch!" Harry declares, and Draco doesn't wait for him to get up before he releases the snitch and runs after it, blocking Harry from passing by him.
Harry's in the common room with Ron and Hermione, trying to finish up the foot-long charms essay due tomorrow when it happens. His chest starts to itch, and the itching spreads across his skin like a wave. Suddenly the skin on his fingers and toes feels like it's simultaneously too big and too small, and when he looks down at his hands he expects to see - well, something that would explain the feeling. But his hands look the same as they always do, even when he clenches them into fists to stop himself from scratching.
Draco frowns, trying to remember. “Yes. You were wearing a really cool wedding ring and said you were married and in love with her. So yeah, you definitely have a wife."
"Well...you're terrible at potions but you're good at cooking, you're a Gryffindor, obviously, you've seen a Welsh Green and Hungarian Horntail in person, you play quidditch, your favourite position is seeker…" Draco is relishing in the look of astonishment on Harry's face. "Your handwriting is terrible, you like treacle tart more than cake, you take your tea black, you want to have children, you’re friends with me and you know Pansy and Greg, you never had a birthday party when you were growing up, and you're in love with your wife. Who you haven't married yet I guess. There's more but I can't think of any off the top of my head."
“Well, yes, but if that was Snape, they just moved it closer to him if he wants to try again. Which he obviously does.”
It's starting to seem like his most boring trip ever when he notices the professor pause in front of an attractive Slytherin boy with dark hair. If his trips have meaning, this interaction has to be the point of this one.
Hermione looks concerned. "I suppose you can't really help where you end up, but please be careful and try to only observe what you see, at least until we have more information to go on. And you've still gone much further into the past than anyone else has in the past ninety years. And without a time turner.
"You're just lucky you didn't have to see those giant spiders Hagrid has in the Forbidden Forest," Ron says.
The first thing that jolted him out of his half-asleep state was the drain in the bathtub. Between Draco and Teddy’s hair, it was almost always clogged, particularly when Draco had been gone, as Teddy hadn’t learned that spell yet. He should probably teach it to him soon. But now, the water was draining perfectly. He blamed his sleep deprivation on the fact that it took him so long to think of Harry and his ‘handyman’ guise.
"So what, school's out and you don't have to be on time any more Moons?" Harry's dad asks one of the wizards, clapping him on the back. He's thin with wavy brown hair.
This mystery solved, Harry turns back to Ginny, trying to lift her up. “She’s cold as ice, you have to help me Tom, there’s a basilisk around here somewhere, we have to go--” He reaches for his wand, but it's not there. When he looks up, Tom is playing with it.
“I don’t really remember. I think I went to someone’s house? I played with another kid, but I don’t remember their name.” All he does remember is being happy and well-fed, something he became increasingly grateful for as he got older and had to hide food away to eat when Petunia and Vernon weren’t looking.
Harry has an entirely different concern on his mind. "Will it, er, will it be okay if I, y'know, travel while I'm here? Your dad works for the Ministry, and Dumbledore told me to keep it a secret..." He doesn't add how scary Mrs. Weasley is when she's yelling.
Harry's vision blurs and he pushes his glasses up onto his forehead, wiping fruitlessly at his eyes. He could
"This is my manor," he muttered under his breath as he trudged back up the stairs. He really was tired; every step felt like a mountain.
Ron shakes his head. "I heard you speak Parseltongue. Sounded like ssSssSSSS. Looked like you were egging the snake on, mate, no wonder Justin looked terrified."
“Snape’s evil,” Ron says loyally. “I bet whatever he thinks you did, he’d give Malfoy points for doing the same thing.”
"Are you serious?" Draco had asked, gesturing at the giant mess, but Harry only replied, "I'll clean it up before dinner," without turning around.
Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking out of the Great Hall with Hagrid, a day before Hermione leaves for the holiday. When they mention going to the library for a half hour before lunch, Hagrid expresses surprise at their dedication.
Once he stops panicking, Harry realizes that Professor Dumbledore is not participating in these spells. He's watching Harry curiously.
It's odd, being in Potter's presence and not feeling the force of his full attention on him. Whenever Harry visited before, he was Draco's from beginning to end - he would do, say, or listen to anything Draco asked of him, barely questioning anything about their time together. Now, Potter only spares him fleeting glances in class or in the halls. It's...odd.
They spend more time in the second round blocking each other from getting near the snitch than actually catching it, but after a while, the snitch hovers in the corner near the ceiling where neither of them can reach it.
"It's good to be back. Congratulations, I can't believe you solved it! Did your ability help at all, Harry?"
“There has to be a clue somewhere,” she mutters, levitating various articles of clothing and spinning them around.
When he's fully dressed, he winces at his reflection. There are various sized circles drawn on his t-shirt and jeans in one of Dean's marker's, his laces are tied around his ankles, his belt is twisted and tucked into his jeans the way he wore it at least one of the times it traveled with him.
“No, it just happens, and then a little while later I come back. I think I used to go play with a kid when I was little. This time I just went to some hallway in Hogwarts, d’you think it’s some kind of teleportation magic?”
“That’s because I am Harry. That Harry was me when I was younger, just after I had gotten cursed. It slowed down after a while, but then I got hit with the same curse again a few years ago, and I’ve been traveling a lot lately.”
Across from the stairs was another door, which Harry thought might go to another part of the mansion, but was only a pantry. He supposed it made sense with the table right there, but on the other side of the table and all along the wall opposite the hearth were shelves of glass jars full of what looked like magic ingredients. Not that Harry knew what magic ingredients were, but -he held one out at arms length in the light from the window- wormwood, the elegant writing on the label said. He put it back, not knowing what it could be used for. What if it was poisonous?
Hermione hums. "Could be. Anyway, Madam Pomfrey said she just needs to do one final check on your hand and we can go down to the feast!"
When he enters his room with a promise to keep quiet and stay out of sight, there’s a creature sitting on his bed, wearing what looks like a thin, dirty pillowcase.
"Harry. Harry Potter." Harry's eyes dart between the men, certain his name will garner a reaction, but it doesn't. He must be sometime before Voldemort's first defeat, then.
“Least they’re not charmed holes,” Ron says brightly. “One year Fred and George charmed a few pairs of my socks to grow bigger and bigger holes the closer it got to Christmas so mum would have to buy me new ones as a present.”
"Let's go," Draco whispered to him. "I found a nearby patch of yarrow, I'll teach you the proper way to harvest and prepare it."
Draco throws up his hands and stalks away. "If either of you get hurt, it's not my fault!" he shouts.
"It’d be great if you could travel to the future and find out who it is," Ron says when they get word that Justin Finch-Fletchley is petrified now too.
Soon enough his skin starts to itch and feel both tight and loose, and he prepares himself to be transported inside.
“My name is Harry,” he said, trying and failing to get up. Teddy came over and started fussing over him, but Harry continued talking to the wizard. “And I’m here to fix things up.” He stood successfully, intent on getting in the wizard’s face, but Teddy led him to the table instead.
"I don't really care if it goes with me, as long as I have my wand. I'm definitely trying to take it next time."
Despite himself, Draco is getting a little worried about Crabbe and Goyle. They left the feast ages ago but they hadn’t been anywhere in the Slytherin dungeons, or any of their usual haunts when he’d gone out to look for them. He decides to circle back to check the Common Room again, and breathes a silent sigh of relief and a loud sigh of exasperation when he finds them near the entrance with what looks like a prefect. A Gryffindor prefect. Trust the two of them to find themselves in a situation like this.
"I'll keep that in mind," Harry tells him, wiping his eyes before putting his glasses back on. He feels a little better already. "What did I miss in Herbology?"
The clock’s just chimed midnight when Draco hears a soft pop through the curtains of his four poster bed. He rips open the curtains to see Harry turning on the spot, still protected by his Protego. Normally, he immediately tears it down, but he’s not in Malfoy Manor like usual. And if Draco could cast anything confidently, he’d be shooting hexes that would make Harry wish he still had his shield up.
Harry practically runs back to Gryffindor tower, but when he gets to the portrait hole, he hesitates. He instinctively knows that his body will return him to his place in the common room, but what would happen if he was already in place? He imagines being shoved into himself painfully, and decides to wait for his body to do whatever it does. If Filch comes around the corner he'll use it as a last resort, but this will be fine for now. Some part of his subconscious is curious as to why they haven't learned about this yet; it seems important and a little dangerous, but then again hasn't everything here been like that so far?
“Yeah.” The snitch floats towards them for a few seconds in a taunt before heading back to its unreachable position.
"I love you too." The man's voice breaks and his hands tremble as he turns to bury his face in Harry's wild soft hair. "So very much."
"Wait." Harry maneuvered the broom between Draco and the manor. "If your specialty is potions, then how are you working on my mmmm-. You know."
Harry frowned. "You're right. He talked to me over tea until I fell asleep, and when I woke up I was in his bed and he was gone. And he was upset earlier, over nothing. Unless someone said something to him?" He stood up, all righteous indignation, and Pansy had to calm him down.
"Oh, like you were much earlier," one of the others answers. He's dressed in black muggle clothes, his dark, curly hair almost to his shoulders. "We almost tripped into you when we came through. Bad manners, Jamesy! Wait til I tell mum!" he sing-songs.
fault,’ huffed Draco. On Harry’s bottom lip trembled a perilous drop of his blood, stark red against the slick flesh. It was sort of charming, in a very twisted way. He licked it clean, feeling Harry shudder beneath him. ‘You did tell me the vampire look suited me once.’
'The contest,' Draco occupied himself with kissing down Harry's throat so he didn't have to meet his gaze. He had no idea what had possessed him to say it, 'Who better showed their House.'
'We ought to stop doing this in places where we can get interrupted,' he said, catching Harry by the arm to pull him against his chest.
Harry smiled. Idly, with gold-stained fingers, he gestured at the snakes writhing in Draco’s forearms.
‘I don’t pay for everything,’ Harry huffed; but his features softened into something self-conscious when Draco just stared at him with an expectant gaze. Then, he frowned. ‘How’d you know, anyhow?’
- he pressed a hand to Harry’s hip as he stepped behind him to grab the jar of preserved flitterby moths.
When he couldn’t take more of the excited, erratic chatter of his table, couldn’t bear faking another smile nor utter another polite word, he leaned closer to Pansy to murmur:
‘You really are dreadful at intimidation, Zabini. No wonder Bellatrix never taught you how to torture.’
Draco didn’t much care, and saw only that she’d taken a frankly sketchy dark purple bean from the pile before he was leaning down to purr into Harry’s ear:
‘Hermione. It’s not true,’ he swallowed, and met her gaze at last, ‘It’s not true. But don’t tell Potter. Please.’
He shook that picture from his mind - though it was difficult, seeing the delectable wavering of Harry’s Adam’s apple as he drank.
‘D’you remember what I did to you?’ he said instead, voice a bit shaky as he stared at his own dick in between Harry’s fingers. ‘Do that.’
It almost broke his resolve, overwhelmed him with the blind urge to oblige, but he held himself off with one hand on one of the posts, hovering just over Harry. There was an order to things - an order dictated by thousands of ghosts he'd embodied throughout the years, who'd laid in that same bed and dreamt of that precise moment.
‘It doesn’t work by drinking it away either, and Harry’s surely eager to try that,’ Pansy said. ‘All I mean is that we all have nightmares.
, if only to prove to his friends that he could be a good boyfriend - partner, friend, whatever he was. As it was, no solemn change had been felt in his world, the colours hadn’t seemed brighter nor had the air felt warmer, and he’d been waking just like he’d always woken - slightly disillusioned -, so it felt unlikely that Harry
The peculiar shout came from a winding street to their left. Finnigan and Luna stood by the door of Honeydukes; a short man was scurrying down the the cobblestone.
Draco couldn't very well deny it, so he simply kissed the corner of Harry's smeared lips - and he wondered how much of that lipstick was now painted on his own skin - before asking:
‘For fuck’s sake,’ Harry sighed, patting Draco’s shoulders before stepping away. Draco very pointedly noticed the deliberate way in which he draped his robe over his crotch, and he smirked darkly at the sight. ‘Alright, come on, then,’ Harry said, dragging him by the arm and into the shop. ‘And stop looking so damn pleased, Draco.’
Gryffindor fell to his knees and carefully took the blond's dick.  Moments later, the boy who lived's body was shaking with pleasure as a thick and hard penis disappeared into his mouth.
- "And only I have the right to fuck you. Only I have the right to have you" - Draco got tired of tapping his buttocks with his hands, so he made up his mind to change the slapping tool. He pulled out his trouser belt and swung with all his strength towards the now red, firm piece of skin.
Draco moved his hips, and tears welled up in Harry's eyes. The blows were strong, fast and very deep. Harry couldn't catch his breath. He was choking and didn't want it to end. The groans that escaped the Prince of Slytherin's mouth were melody to his ears.
He swallowed hard and only now realized he was hard. His hand slid uncontrollably over the bulge in his pants and began to gently massage his prick through the bottom of his clothes.
He was close now, so close that he felt unimaginable pain. He grabbed his cock to make it easier to come but then he felt a firm grip on his hands and heard the growl against his ear.
- "You have a boyfriend, Slytherin Prince" - he couldn't be angry with them. He just got what he wanted
- "Everything is fine. My limbs are fine and my work is going great. I started getting along with Potter." - The classroom's jaw dropped. The only verbal response that could be heard was:
- " Shove it deeeper! Ahhh! " - He gasped heavily and pressed his hands around the edge of the desk. Malfoy let out a loud groan that made his chosen one's heart leap with joy. He did not want the blond's penis to ever come out of it. He needed this fulfillment.
