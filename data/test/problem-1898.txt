“No one’s ever told me that before.” Harry whispered, he felt tears gathering at his eyes. His heart hurt a little, but it was also soaring. He had wanted what Draco had just given him for as long as he could remember; love and acceptance. He didn’t know what to do, feeling like he couldn’t do anything. He had never said it to anyone either. He didn’t know what it really felt like. He knew he liked Draco, a lot, but was it the feeling that people get married over?
Harry looked around and recognized he was in the dungeons. He usually ended up there when he went wandering. He figured he was searching for any reminder of Draco. He hadn’t gone to their special room, couldn’t stomach the thought of being there without him, but the familiar hallways helped remind him of Draco.
Harry found his throat rather sore as he padded over quietly to Draco’s form. He was just so gorgeous, even from the back. He fell to his knees, he would hate to wake Draco, but the potion was so incredibly important.
“Does this mean you don’t want my number?” The hostess asked as they passed her. She recoiled from Draco’s glare.
“Why don’t you send me an owl with when you can next meet up?” Harry followed him to the door, trying to get a word in, but Draco shut it behind him, cutting him off quite efficiently. Harry walked back to the sofa, buried his head in his hands, and wondered.
“So, what? You’re saying you’re not even sorry?” She didn’t answer. “I lost a month of my life because of you, Hermione! I might never see Draco again, and I didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye to him. Maybe I would have been there when he disappeared. That doesn’t matter, though. I thought you trusted me, but it’s obvious you don’t. Just get out.” She didn’t move, her eyes wide, tears in them again. That didn’t sway Harry. “Get out!” He yelled. Ron winced, but Hermione finally moved, practically running from the room.
Draco grinned back. “Great. Thanks for doing that. Want to help me unpack?”
“Harry?” Ron’s voice came from somewhere above him, “are you awake?” Harry was laying down in his bed in the dorm. It was Christmas morning, and he hadn’t slept well, if at all, as he had been since he had heard about Sirius Black. He didn’t answer.
“You’ll think of one. I know you will. And I’ll love it whatever it is.”
“Good point.” They started walking again. “Whatever you have in store for me, thank you, Draco. You are so sweet, and I’m so lucky to be with you.”
“I tried to move on, like you said.” Mandy said quietly. “I dated Luna Lovegood last year, but we decided to be friends at the end of the year. I thought that with time, I’d be able to find what we had in someone else, but I don’t think that will ever happen, because what we had was special. I still think about you every day, and I’ll never love anyone else like I love you.”
“What happened?” Seemed to be the most popular question, Harry heard it repeated, echoing all around the room.
Harry took a deep breath. “Draco, I still have a bad feeling about this, but I understand that you feel you need to do this. I don’t fully understand why, but I can see that you do. I just want you to do one thing for me, ok?” Draco raised his eyebrow as Harry leaned over and grabbed his bag. He had brought it specifically to give his present to Draco.
Draco chuckled. “I’m snogging my gorgeous boyfriend, or trying to at least. How do you think I’m doing?” He leaned forward to kiss Harry and pulled him closer to his body. Harry moaned as he got lost in the kiss.
Harry hummed. “I love you.” It was answer enough and he was tired.
There’s not much known about where Malfoy Manor is located so I made up a bunch of stuff. We know it’s in Wiltshire, I chose Castle Combe, which is a real place, for it’s name. The neighborhood of Palisades is a real neighborhood, though not in Europe. It’s near me, and it’s known as being the richest neighborhood of the area, so I thought it was fitting.
“I…I don’t want to stop.” They stared at each other, both breathing heavily, then Draco leaned forward.
“I bet you enjoyed that. How did you meet, anyway?” Harry grabbed the handle of the frying pan and shook it back and forth to make sure it was slick enough before flipping it. The pancake landed smack in the middle of the pan and Harry smiled. That was his favorite part of cooking pancakes, flipping them without a spatula; it had taken him several times and subsequent punishments to get the hang of it.
He got a response a couple minutes later.
Draco bit his lip. “I guess that explains that ugly sweater you had, I wondered. See that just proves my point. Muggles don’t understand our world and, how could they? They can’t explain it to their magical children and then we have all these ignorant people with wands and magic, power to kill, maim, make bad choices, even do seemingly harmless things that are actually bad, because they were never taught differently. Whoever put you with Muggles really dropped the quaffle.”
Two relationships ended that night, although Harry wasn’t there to see it. Ron and Lavender as well as Ginny and Dean broke up. Ron told him about it the next day after Harry shared what he had learned the night before. Later that day, Katie returned to the castle.
Previously: " “Good night, Baby,” Harry mumbled. “I love you.”
“So you just lied to us instead? And why couldn’t you have told us before then?
He decided to lay down on the couch, the stresses of the day overcoming him. He was face down in the cushions, groaning, when he felt the pressure of Draco climbing on top of him. The groan turned into a moan as Draco covered his body with his own, leg on leg, arm on arm. He felt a couple kisses on the back of his neck and hummed.
“Sirius said I don’t have to go back.” Harry was still feeling elation over that.
“What?” Harry asked disbelievingly.
Harry raised his eyebrows and patted the bed. “I was thinking right here.” He was suddenly glad Sirius had insisted he get a bigger size than twin, despite Harry’s protests.
“Alright, well, is there something you want to talk about?”
Draco hummed in interest when he took his first bit. Then he took another. “Good?” Harry asked, rather unnecessarily. Draco nodded, and they lapsed into silence, chewing thoughtfully.
This chapter made me particularly happy. I didn't realize I was doing this at first, but Harry's bi-experience and thought process was very similar to mine and writing it out really helped with processing. It wasn't until about 3 weeks ago that I fully accepted that part of myself (though I've known to various degrees for years) and it was very freeing. Byyyyyyy the way, I'm bi. (That's how I came out to my sister and best friend.)
Sirius laughed. “For me, it was the same. I was a bit of a free spirit as a teenager, didn’t stay with anyone for too long. Except…” He shook his head. “Anyway, if you’ve been together a year and you’re still happy, you’re doing something right. If either of you feel like you need to talk to someone other than each other, feel free to write to me. I know how complicated relationships can get, and it can’t be easy having a secret relationship. How does that work anyway?”
“Where are we?” Harry asked as he looked around. They were standing in the center of a very large room that appeared to be made entirely out of wood. Looking further, it appeared that it was several rooms combined; there was a kitchen area, lounge room and bed. He took in more details and realized there was a very salty, yet clean, flowery smell in the air. A strange sound grabbed his attention, coming from glass French doors behind him. His jaw dropped as he took in the sight of a beach and ocean just outside the doors.
Also, that thing where random chunks of the story just don't appear is still going on, so if you see anything missing, please let me know.
with you,” he said threateningly. She nodded, nose in the air, and he departed again. There were times when she needed comfort, so she made her way gracefully to her vanity. She did not rush, she hastened.
Cedric shook his head. “Well, I was hoping I could write to you over the summer, maybe we could meet up and go out sometime?”
“What?” He asked stupidly.
He gently wiped the tears away and placed a gentle, light kiss on his lips. “You’re right.” Draco whispered against his lips. Harry pulled back slowly, hoping for more, but Draco continued, “but I can’t tell you.” Harry closed his eyes. “I
She had almost stood in the way of that.
Sixth Year is going to be hard, and definitely darker, but I hope I have written an original and likeable tale that does the original story justice. I think you can tell from that last bit in the chapter that things from here on out will not follow the plot as closely, seventh year I’m planning on being completely different. As for Draco, he is in for some hard times, his canon ark will be different, but he has Harry and we know those two can handle anything together. Who else was cheering him on when Harry tried to break up with him? I know I was! I know it’s a different reaction than Ginny had, but in my opinion, one reaction doesn’t make either of them more fitting for Harry, it’s just that it fits with a different part to his personality. I’ve kept Draco as in character as possible, at least how I see him, and I don’t think he’d ever let go of Harry. At least we’ve got that out of the way.
He grabbed the portkey he was working on and placed the homing device in the center of his bed. Hopefully, no one would move it. His hesitant plan was to get in, grab Sirius, and activate the portkey, bringing both him and his godfather back. It was similar to what had happened last year with him, Pettigrew and the Cup from the Triwizard Tournament. With any luck, Voldemort wouldn’t kill him the moment he walked into the room.
Harry sniffed, it wasn’t that he was afraid of crying in front of Draco, but he still didn’t like crying in general. If there was a time to, however, it was now. As his shoulders started shaking, Draco pulled and Harry was in his arm, crying into his chest.
“No!” He was screaming. In the background, Voldemort had disappeared, and Dumbledore turned towards Harry, terror etched into every line of his face.
Remus cleared his throat. “What about you, Harry? Have any girls you’re sweet on?” Harry startled. He wasn’t sure what to do.
There was no response. Harry sighed and tried to get to sleep.
“No, he’s not. He was forced into this by Voldemort. He never wanted to be a Death Eater, and he doesn’t even have the mark.” When were they going to cease the incredibly annoying glances? They were driving him mad.
He hadn’t expected it to be Draco that would be the distracting person with all the children around them. He found it enchanting how excited Draco was, but the couple people around them turned around and shushed them. Two groups got up and moved closer to the screen. Harry was actually somewhat proud of that; Draco had to be rubbing off on him.
Mary MacDonald was a student in the '70's, so I didn't think it was too far of a stretch to say she went to school with Harry's parents. I just wanted someone different for her role, and I've never come across her in a fic before.
They sat cross-legged, facing each other, lengthwise on the bed. “Open this one,” Harry said, placing the medium sized present in front of him. Draco gave him a look that said he was excited and expecting, set his plate aside, and began ripping the paper apart. There was a cardboard box, and when he opened that he gasped upon finding two engraved wineglasses. One had his name, his birthdate, and the date of his seventeenth birthday. The other had Harry’s. “They’re beautiful!” Draco breathed.
“What?”
“Harry. This is something that I have to do. I promise you, I will be alright, and if it looks like there’s danger, I’ll get out of there. That’s the most you can ask.”
“Thanks, Sally.” She snorted very un-lady like.
He was in a hallway, and he realized that. He was waking up, just a little.
He missed Harry so much though. Seeing the look on his face when he first saw Draco, that melted into betrayal, hurt him so much. He hadn’t known how to deal with it, so he hurt him back, and watched as Harry was pushed further and further away. He reminded himself that it was for the best. Harry would have learned who he was anyway, and would have told him to leave him alone at some point. It was easier to be the one pushing, it probably hurt less.
“How do you know where Gryffindor is?” Harry asked.
“Hmm.” Draco took the letter to read again. “I still don’t know. Maybe it doesn’t matter. Why would someone try to hide their identity within a sealed letter?”
“I’m not sure about Snape,” Harry admitted. “Dumbledore says he trusts him, and I’ve been wrong about him before. There’s just something about him I don’t trust.” Draco hummed in thought, then shook his head.
McGonagall rolled her eyes. “I’ll believe that when I see it, Potter.” Her lips twitched a little. “If you will follow me, the students are sleeping in the Great Hall tonight. I will escort you.” Harry nodded and hopped out of bed, grabbing his wand and slipping on some shoes for the walk. “Incidentally, is that all Mr. Weasley told you, Mr. Potter? That Sirius Black would try to find you?” McGonagall asked as they left the dorm.
The next week was among the best week of his life. He and Sirius took a portkey to Paris then apparated to their resort. It definitely was a resort, not a hotel. They spent the next week eating expensive meals, riding every ride, and generally having a blast. Sirius was a lot of fun, which Harry knew beforehand, but he seemed to come alive when they were playing at the park.
“The park closes at six.” Draco added, standing next to him.
*** Last night
.’ Harry didn’t look up but made eye contact in their shared class and briefly smiled.
Harry felt squirts of come hit his hand and chest as he grunted and panted. He pictured Draco on his own bed, feeling the same things he was.
“Harry’s stubborn, so he didn’t let me escape without his friendship, then our relationship. My Father has means of keeping me under his thumb. I really would more than appreciate you not speaking of this.”
Harry frowned. “Who?”
“Oh, no. Should I take you to the hospital wing?” Harry asked concerned. He put his hand over Draco’s forehead, he did feel a little clammy.
They continued their staring. “I get that this is a lot. You’re picturing Malfoy, the boy who bullied us, but that isn’t who he really is. Once you get to know him, the real him, I know you’ll like him.”
Draco went on. “I suspect you’re also upset at
“Wizards just use sticking charms. It’s so clever what they’ve managed to do without magic.” Harry laughed, so in love with the Pureblood wizard that found muggles fascinating. He tried not to think of Arthur Weasley.
“Thanks.” He squeezed Draco’s hand and smiled lovingly. “What do you feel like eating?”
Harry felt the moment Draco let go and couldn’t help but tense in response. He felt the typical panic whenever he felt Draco’s hardened outline but tried to remember that this was a perfectly natural, healthy thing that was happening. He let Draco continue for several seconds before he experimentally moved his hips out towards Draco.
“Don’t be stupid, Harry.” Draco disagreed. “If we both go, Dumbledore will start to suspect something. Nosy old coot is one of the last people we need knowing.”
“There’s not. It’s just you and me.” Draco started pushing him backwards lightly, and Harry went, trusting Draco not to lead him into anything. “The wards will tell you if there’s anyone around. There’s nothing to be nervous about.”
“They wouldn’t let us in the meetings, we don’t know anything about anything!”
“Oh yeah?” Harry yelled, placing his arms around Draco’s neck. “As many as we can get away with.”
Draco smirked and threw him a wink, throwing his hand over his heart. “I would never.” That didn’t help any.
Harry nodded, trying not to look too pleased.  He slowly made his way vaguely towards the front doors until Ron was out of sight before making his way towards the Dungeons. He found the room they had decided on pretty easily, having paid extra attention as he was leaving.
Draco struggled for a minute, like he wanted to argue again, but he resisted. “I think I’m fine. Pomfrey fixed me up in a snap, but I don’t want to leave you, so I’m going to play up the pain.”
“Alright,” Sirius said slowly, taking a seat across from them and rubbing his face tiredly. “That was really stupid and dangerous. You know that, right?”
After a while, he got up and decided to work out for a while, he had never run in such a pretty atmosphere. Draco barely mumbled out a response as Harry told Draco he was leaving, and Harry felt a twitch of annoyance. When he got back, he made dinner, which Draco ate around a book. Harry rolled his eyes and tried to ignore the fact that he was essentially talking to himself.
“Hush, Harry. It’s ok.” He pulled his head out of his hand so he could look into Harry’s eyes. “I’m not angry at you. I know you, and I know you’d never cheat on me. You told me right away, so everything is ok. I’m pissed at Chang, how dare she, but when you get right down to it, everyone thinks you’re single. You are a hell of a catch, Harry, I’ve been expecting something like this for a while. You are so handsome, intelligent, funny, sassy, and everything I’ve ever wanted. I think it’s likely that something like this will happen again.”
Harry wasn’t tired but couldn’t think of anything he would rather be doing than holding Draco close as he dreamed. “Sounds good to me." Harry knew Draco was still having trouble sleeping, but Draco always seemed to sleep fine when they were together.
He used his sleepless nights to dive into
“Why?” Harry asked after several minutes of trying to fathom a reason.
“What can I do?” Draco asked quietly. Harry hid his face in Draco’s neck. He wasn’t sure what Draco could do. He knew he wanted to help, but he was feeling pretty chaotic, and didn’t know what would help. “Do you feel like talking about it?”
After a moment of feeling the happiness he had, he moved on to Draco’s other gift. He opened it just as reverently as his other gift. It was a cloak, dark black with silver fastenings, and were those diamonds? They had to be fake. The material was soft and smooth, silky. Harry wrapped it around himself, admiring the way it flowed down his body in the mirror. Said mirror whistled at him as he came closer, and Harry blushed.
Then Draco opened up his eyes, and he smiled at Harry.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, trying to sort through memories to figure out what had tipped him off.
Harry laughed, feeling the last of his panic leaving him.
“Huh?”
Harry kissed Draco’s shoulder. “I don’t know. It was just…this feeling I had.”
“Sorry, Dearies, what can I get you?”
“What?” Draco asked softly, a pace ahead of Harry.
“What did you think of all the singing?” Harry asked. He had found it a bit interesting but also annoying.
“Oh. I see. Well, I actually have an idea about that. Can I still do it if I lose?” He smirked at Draco, raising his eyebrows quickly in suggestion.
“Good. Hold onto him, then. Do you have any questions?” He did, actually, about Sirius’s dating life, but now wasn’t the time. He shook his head. “Well then, I guess that’s it for now, we covered the most important bits. Write me if you have any questions, about anything—actually, I may have something that will be better than writing. Let me see if I can find it.” Sirius bustled off, leaving Harry to make his exit.
“Whatever. Why don’t you go cry about it to your pen pal? Maybe you’ll be a better friend to him than you are to me.”
“Your mysterious pen-pal as well?” It was barely a question.
“Someone tricked the Goblet?” Crouch asked.
“Yeah, yeah. It still leaves my fingers sticky when I try.” Draco shook his head at him before leaning over to trail kisses from his cheek to his lips.
“You have a boyfriend?” Ron called out in confusion a couple couples over. He was dancing with Hermione, and Harry was pleased to see that. Hermione was looking back in forth between them with a look of astonishment, curiosity, happiness, and disbelief.
The day of the final task, Harry woke up feeling strange. On the one hand, he knew he had prepared as much as he possibly could and felt plenty confident about his abilities. On the other hand, he was facing unknown perils against three other students that had three years of magical knowledge on him. Plus, they had all grown up in the magical world, and that experience was incalculable.
Draco smiled, though his eyes were worried, and Harry pushed him back against the door, grabbing his wrists as he thrust his tongue down Draco’s mouth. He hummed in confusion at the liquid suddenly pouring into his mouth, but Harry kept kissing him until he was forced to swallow or choke.
Ron had done a 180 since the beginning of the year. He was calmer, friendlier, didn’t jump on him when Harry didn’t want to hang out with him…
“I love you too, my son.” She looked up. “I hear noises outside. I must go, lest they find this. I’ll contact you again when I can.” Her face disappeared. Draco buried his face in his arms. He had to do this, he had to. He really did love her.
Draco slid to one knee in front of him, and Harry protested the position, but Draco waved him off. He held up the velvet box to Harry and took both of his hands in the other of his. “Harry James Potter,” he said, and Harry melted. “I love you more than anything else in this world. If you will have me, I swear to love, honor and cherish you for the rest of my natural life. I promise that you will never be alone again, for I will always be by your side as your best friend for the rest of your life. I will take care of you, protect you, love you, always. I want nothing more than to worship you for as long as you will have me. Will you give me the greatest pleasure of my life, and be my husband?” Harry didn’t realize or care that he was crying.
While he was doing that, something happened to Draco. There was an altercation, and Draco was suddenly floating in front of Snape, unconscious.
“No! It must be Draco! He has to be the one to do it! Go ahead, Draco! Prove to us your worth.” The was a manic gleam on her face.
Sirius stuck his head out into the corridor, then immediately pulled it back. “Fuck,” he swore. “There’s a whole group of Death Eater’s in the hallway.” Draco and Harry both swore as well.
Ron sighed, then slowly nodded his head. “I didn’t like the last couple weeks. I just wish we didn’t have to keep secrets from each other.”
Two hands touched his knee gently, surprising him enough that he opened his eyes to meet Draco’s. They were like liquid silver, swirling around. Harry had never seen eyes like that. “Harry.” Draco said quietly. He looked like he was in pain.
Harry spit first, Draco immediately following him, then they both swished Harry’s mouthwash around. Harry cleaned the sink as Draco took a look at the shower.
They had taken innocent showers together before and that was exactly what Harry needed. Draco washed Harry more than himself, so Harry had to make sure he was clean too.
“I guess it really doesn’t matter who it was. I’m not sure I want a friend amongst the Death Eaters.”
“I’ll see you around, Harry. You’re a nice bloke.” With that, she left, blowing her nose on that handkerchief. Harry turned after a moment and headed towards the loos, feeling like he needed a nice Draco hug.
“You alright?” Harry asked as he offered a hand to Diggory.
“Yes, I’ll get you something, stay here.” He made his way to the kitchen and rustled up some food. He tried to rush as much as possible, while still remaining quiet for Sirius, who was presumably sleeping.
“Sure.” Neither got up or moved much. Draco waved his wand and Harry felt the stickiness disappear, replaced by a nice clean feeling. Harry ran his hand up and down Draco’s back, caressing softly.
Draco had made the experience a lot more fun than he was expecting. He quizzed Harry on which one he like, or liked better, or thought would go better. He explained why one shirt went better with different trousers, and why there was only three acceptable colors that went with others. Harry never would have thought he would care about fashion rules, but he found himself paying attention to what Draco was saying.
“What was my dad like?” He finally asked. Sirius and Remus smiled sadly at each other before launching into their tales.
“He’ll be alright, his mother said so. Said Kreacher did the right thing.”
“To understand that, Harry, you need to know about the Death Eaters. They are the group that-.”
Draco softened slightly, and he whispered back, “I love you too.” Harry closed his eyes in pain. This was going to be hard, but it had to be done.
He told his bracelet.
Draco sighed. Harry felt worry settle in his stomach for the umpteenth time. “Harry, there’s something you need to understand about that. To most pureblood families, continuing the line is more important than any feelings of love. To Purebloods, blood is sacred, marriage, family, children, it all comes second to purity.”
He felt Draco lie on his side next to him and run a hand over Harry’s bare arm. Draco nuzzled his neck, placing a few tiny kisses there. Harry sighed happily, giving him more room. He felt Draco’s smile before he kissed his way to Harry’s nipple and sucked on it. Harry carded his fingers through Draco’s hair, keeping him there for a moment, before he let Draco go to the other one.
“I agree, considering I’m going to be the one making them. I’ll make you a list of things I’ll need, and the apothecary in Diagon does do bulk orders that we can renew for every couple months.”
“You got rid of your fleas?”
Harry shook his head. “Sorry, it’s just that it’s a really depressing play, not to mention a muggle one, I’m surprised you’ve seen it.”
They sat in silence for a long while, the minutes stretching out. Finally, Harry burst out, “Look, I’m sorry I made other plans on our date day. This secret relationship thing is hard, Draco.”
“No, I don’t really see anything else. Oh, actually, the twins might like these.” He pointed to a shell collage that had been made to look like two singing frogs, complete with top hats and canes. “But if I’m getting something for them, I’ll need to get something for everyone else.”
Hermione launched immediately into a detailed break down of the test. Ron and Neville quickly lost interest, looking off into the distance, as Harry tuned her out. Now he thought about it, if Sirius went with the rest of the Order, and he was sure he would, he had reason to be worried about him. Would there be a fight at the Ministry?
With a squeeze to his arm, they made their way to the door.
They were so close. They just had to wait a little bit longer. “We should…we should wait until after. Right?” Harry nodded. He felt like his emotions were all over the place, and he couldn’t centralize a single one.
There was shag carpeting in the living room, and the couches were an outdated burgundy that reminded him of the ones in the Gryffindor Common Room. He was surprised there was a television in the corner, he hadn’t seen one that old in years. He wondered if his parents would have watched cartoons on the carpet with him on Saturday mornings. He bent to run his fingers against the fibers, and couldn’t help but think they would. Unlike at the Dursleys’ house, the fireplace mantle had framed photos of him.
“Not all Christians.” Hermione sent a look to Harry. “My parents are Christian, as am I, and they are fine with me being a witch. It’s rather outdated to be scared of witches. Most believe magic doesn’t exist. It’s only certain denominations that say either is wrong.”
“Can you tell someone?” Harry asked quietly.
“How could you forget? And why is that bad?”
“Potter, unless you saw him make the purchase, I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do. Draco Malfoy was in detention, with me, when the incident took place. There’s no possible way he could be in two places at once.”
“We must stop meeting like this,” Harry whispered, somehow recognizing the lips as Draco’s.
Lucius Malfoy was much closer to the double doors, and he didn’t appear to have seen Harry. He entered them, and Harry pushed past Ron and Hermione to follow.
Draco reared back. “Just what are you saying?” He suddenly looked positively terrified.
“Let’s do this.” They nodded to each other, and slipped under the invisibility cloak. There was no one around to notice the door opening of its own accord. They made their way to the lifts following the crowd, taking notice of their surroundings.
Harry tried to look at her face, but he couldn’t manage it at his angle. “Yeah. I’m happier than I’ve ever been, Ginny.” Ginny nodded but didn’t say anything more. After a moment, Harry relaxed back against her. He even forgot he owed her for pushing him.
Then Ron walked up to him, turning redder by the second. “Don’t like it when people keep things form you do you? How do you think it makes us feel?”
So, we have some hints for what's happening to Draco, any guesses? Like I've hinted before, it's not the exact ark that happens in canon.
Her departure masked the pop of another departure, so it was a surprise when Draco turned back to his bed, only to see a silver tray, decked out with all his favorite breakfast foods and a single red rose in a thin silver vase. The cutlery was all silver, and it made quite the ensemble. Draco picked up the note on the side and swooned.
“Not everything.” Hermione agreed. Harry felt his jaw drop. “Then again, we have a couple secrets too.” There was the sound of chuckling, and movement, and something very quiet, but recognizable.
She sighed. “I suppose Gryffindor house’s honor isn’t totally spoiled, today. Mr. Potter, it is admirable you tried to prevent a physical fight. Perhaps things would have gone differently if there had been someone there to help you, or perhaps used magic, but that could have easily been a different conversation. I’m very pleased that you did not take part. Twenty points to Gryffindor. Unfortunately, I have to take them away for you, Mr. Weasley. As well as—” she was cut off by a tiny cough.
“I was wondering if you wanted to join a club, Harry.” She said. “Sally and I talked about starting up a union our fourth year, but it fell through, what with her leaving and all. Luna and I were talking about it over the summer, and we got permission from Dumbledore. Said it was a marvelous idea.”
“This is your pen pal?” Hermione dove onto the information. “Does he realize how important it is for you to be safe right now? For that matter, do you?”
Sirius frowned. “I don’t blame you, Kiddo. Can you tell me what happened?” Harry looked back down at his bloody and torn-jean-covered knees. He shook his head again.
“I’m not saying he’s a fully-fledged Death Eater, I’m saying he’s doing something for Voldemort.” Mr. Weasley winced at the name.
“Oh, I see.” Draco said coldly.
Draco chuckled. “That was brilliant. I think my favorite part was that song that Meg sang with the muses. It was so romantic.”
“Please!” Harry begged. “I want your cock more than anything, baby, please, please, give me your cock or I’ll die! Please, my gorgeous, strong, wonderful, sensual, lover, please let me have that beautiful long, thick cock! I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t suck it, please, let me have it.”
Harry squirmed. He wasn’t great at going against Draco’s wishes. “This is just so important. I can’t be doing research for horcruxes and Transfiguration homework at the same time.”
It took a minute for Draco to reply, but he was glad he did.
Just then, Sarah returned with a basket of fresh bread wrapped in a clean white napkin. “I brought you some bread!” She said cheerfully, as if she was doing them a favor. “Have you had a chance to decide?”
“I would have thought you’d be happy.” Harry said, ever so slightly bitter. “You said you wanted to win.”
“You absolutely are,” Harry murmured back through his lips as he started working on Draco’s shirt.
Harry snorted. “I’ll do my best.” Draco patted his head mockingly.
“I suppose, if that’s all you’ll afford us.” Harry ignored that.
to happen, but nothing ever did. He wanted to leave, had been begging in every letter to his friends but they always said, as vaguely as possible, no. He had even asked Sirius if he could stay with him, wherever he was, but Sirius had also said, much kindlier, no.
He would tell Draco before they left, but as long as they were alone and safe in their little room, there was no reason to say anything. He rather liked Draco’s hair like that. He couldn’t stop thinking about the time over the summer when he had seen Draco’s hair after a shower.
“Yes! That’s it exactly.” It was, too. Once Draco was of age, he would be out from under his father’s influence and they could be together. If they lasted that long, and that actually was the plan. They hadn’t discussed the future beyond the hypothetical, and Harry suddenly wondered what Draco’s plans were. Would he ever go against his father?
“Well,” Sirius said, perhaps trying to shake the fear off of them. “You have to get up pretty early in the morning to pull one over ol’ Sirius Black. They never knew what hit him.” Draco chuckled, although it sounded somewhat forced. He climbed over to be right next to Harry. “I just wish we could have arrested them. At least in the first war, the Ministry at least went through the motions. Today, it just didn’t matter. It was quite the wake-up call.”
“Ah!” Harry grinned. “I’ve been to the Disney in France, it was a lot of fun, I’m sure you’ll have a blast!”
“I don’t need that talk, I already know about sex, Sirius.” He was gratified that he could say that without blushing too much. He had already done stuff with Draco, he didn’t need to hear anything else. His heart rate picked up.
Harry sighed and got up, waved at his fellow champions, and pulled Draco up by the hand. “Do you want to come?” He asked, looking off to the Slytherin section.
“You mean the first time he strangled me? Yeah. He hasn’t tried that before.” Sirius stopped to look at Harry.
“I think they would’ve had the same effect on me regardless. Lupin says it’s because my past is so horrible.”
He got a response a couple minutes later.
“It’s just…” Draco shook his head. “Here.” He handed the letter to Harry, who read it, brows furrowed.
The moment stretched, and Harry realized they had somehow gotten rather close.
“I never get what I want! I hate this, I hate it! Fuck—!” Draco broke down, sobbing hysterically. Harry pulled him into his arms. “Why? Why, Harry why? Why did she have to die?” Draco pushed against him before collapsing, boneless. Harry caught him and gently laid him down on the bed, not removing his arms from around him.
“Don’t want to see you at the end of harmful, untrue gossip.”
“You should have never been allowed in.”
Harry stopped. For one moment, he was horror struck, completely frozen, as waves hit him. He couldn’t handle anything else happening, he couldn’t process what had just happened. Draco was bleeding, he was hurt, badly, and Harry had hurt him. Harry hurt Draco.
After all this time, Sirius was finally free. Free.
Harry broke.
Kreature just gave her a disgusted look before he left muttering so none of them could hear. Harry and Ron tried to cover their snickers, but Hermione still glared.
“I love you, too.”
Harry sighed. “I don’t think I will. Don’t wait up, alright? I’ll come if I can.”
“You know what? Let’s worry about that later. For now, let’s celebrate you winning the tournament.”
Suddenly, he started coughing, unable to get air in his lungs. He was choking! He tumbled forward, hands scratching at his throat, as if hoping to find another way in. He was dying, he knew it.
“Yes, you do,” said a voice very close to Harry. Ginny had joined them on his left on the sofa, and they were a bit squished together. Harry scooted closer to Luna to give her more room.
Sirius asked if they were hungry when they passed one of the in-park restaurants, but Harry and Draco were in agreement that they wanted to go on more rides. Sirius muttered that it was probably a good thing since they were obsessed with roller coasters, but they were already trying to find the next one.
With that, he was gone. Harry collapsed back against the floor, a huge shuttering sigh escaping him. Sirius was safe. That was the important thing. Whatever Voldemort’s plan had been, it would not come to fruition, now. He had taken on Voldemort, again, and won.
Draco sighed. The woman turned to look at Harry, winced, and looked back down at their table. “Oh, I’m alright. Just gave me a bit of a fright. You look so much like James Potter. But you have no idea who that is—”
Draco hummed in thought as they went down the stairs. “I definitely want you by my side all day. I’ve got to admit, it’s nice not being in school for my birthday again. I’d rather not than have what actually happened, of course, but it’s nice.”
They backtracked and found their way to the deserted park that did indeed have picnic tables. Draco insisted on a cleaning charm before they sat. “It’s dirty.” He explained. Harry just shook his head.
“This is incredible,” Draco commented. “Fantastic bit of magic.”
Draco eased his hold but didn’t let go of the most important thing in the world to him. That had been a religious, spiritual experience. He felt more connected to Harry and the universe than he ever had before. It could be his imagination, but he could swear that Harry had left a mark very deep inside Draco, a piece of himself. He actually was still inside Draco, but he meant more than in a physical sense, although it was a very difficult sensation to describe.
“I can’t believe you bothered her with your insane theory, Harry.” Hermione said the moment she saw him. “Draco Malfoy didn’t have anything to do with this, and you know it.”
“Late night?” Sirius asked with a grin as Harry entered the living room, finally ready. Well, mostly; he was still trying to do his cufflinks.
Draco took a swig and moments later, the blood stopped. Draco let out his held breath. Harry waved his wand and the blood vanished. Draco pointed to another bottle. “That one’s a salve. If you wouldn’t mind putting it on me, I think it would be good if we bandage this thing.”
“What’s gotten into you, mate?” Ron asked half-seriously half-jokingly.
She shook her head, tears springing to her eyes, as she took more steps backwards. “No,” she said in denial, as she realized that she had been wrong. Harry didn’t love her. He didn’t want her. He might not even like her.
“And to you, my husband.” Harry smiled and went to take a sip, but Draco gently grabbed his arm. Without saying a word, he showed him how to clink their glasses together, then intertwine their arms as they took their first sip.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco breathed before he spoke. “I’m not.” Harry tried to look at Draco’s face, so he sat up until he could look at Harry. “Don’t you realize what this means? My father is in prison. He might have to stay there. I’m free! I can go home this summer! If my Father isn’t there, there’s no one to force me to join the Death Eaters or hurt me. I don’t care in the least that he’s arrested, this is good news!”
“Think your friends are going to be ok?” Draco asked quietly. Harry attempted to find them in the crowd. He noticed a couple of people he would consider to be friends first, and they all smiled when he met their eyes. That made him glow from the inside, and think that maybe, everyone would be alright with this.
“Beautiful.” Draco breathed. Harry stared. “You are so beautiful, my love.” Harry felt heat fuel up inside him. He didn’t want to believe him. “You are, my beautiful Harry. I love you so much.”
My oh my, this is soooo sappy.
There were murmurs, gasps, sobs. Harry didn’t care about any of the noises made, he just hoped they’d leave him alone.
The rest of the Order all had something to say to him. There were many well wishes, and his hand was almost aching by the end of it. Finally, he got back to Sirius. “Here,” he said, pushing a small, hand wrapped parcel in Harry’s hands. “Open it when you’re back at school, alone.” He pulled Harry into a tight hug. “I’ll miss you, pup. I’ll see you at Christmas.”
Ron and Hermione both needed a pet store, so Harry showed them where one was, and on the way told them he had to visit Gringotts, and he would hate for them to have to come with him. Hermione agreed quickly, but Ron’s forehead crinkled a little. Harry said he’d meet them at the bookstore and waited until they went in before almost jogging back to the Leaky Cauldron.
They repeated their actions several times, and each time, Harry felt his emotions start to calm. Draco started doing something with his wand, Harry wasn’t sure if he was summoning the glass figurines or creating them somehow, but the higher-pitched shatter was extra satisfying. Finally, Harry laughed, and the last figurine went unbroken as Harry hugged his fiancé for a long time.
“Must be nice.” Ron muttered sourly; Harry wasn’t sure if he was meant to hear it or not. He would have offered to share, but he found himself oddly protective of his gift. He didn’t want anyone else to have what Draco had given him, they were just for him. He wasn’t used to feeling that way and didn’t know why he did.
“Yeah, it is.” Draco agreed. They sat in silence, looking at the stars and moon and ocean. The wireless played quietly in the background, the soundtrack to their happiness. “Want to go for a little midnight swim?” Draco asked.
So, they started punishing me whenever I got better scores than Dudley. For a while I just cut back a bit on how well I was doing, but Dudley got worse too because enough time had gone by that he was seriously falling behind. Then they wanted to hold him back a year and I got a beating-- Harry scratched the last word off until it was completely illegible-- punishment worse than any of the others, for that. So, I decided to start doing Dudley’s homework for him and letting him cheat off me in the tests. He got better, and I had no time to do both of ours, so I got worse.
“What would you like to do today?” He asked instead. It niggled in the back of his mind that they maybe should do some work on the horcrux hunt, but another voice told him to shut up and one more day wouldn’t hurt.
“Rude.” Harry commented, looking around to see where they had ended up. They were in the backyard of the Burrow, and wedding preparations were already underway. There was a large tent being erected, people were running around carrying flowers and chairs, and Harry spotted Mrs. Weasley directing. He probably would avoid her while she was yelling at anyone who got near her.
This chapter: The wedding and fallout
“What is it?” Harry whispered.
“Harry, you said Draco Malfoy was planning something.” Hermione cut in.
“I think I’m probably pants at relationships. And if you haven’t noticed, I’m pretty thick, so if I ever do something stupid, just say so, alright?”
“You want to break into Malfoy Manor, just to get Malfoy?” Ron asked, staring at him.
He knew it wouldn’t last, but Ron was trying. “Thanks, Ron.”
“Alright, fair enough, tell us about him.” Parvati said in challenge.
Harry took a deep breath, unable to completely contain his smile. “You’re free.” He said simply, a little choked up. Sirius stared at him, open mouthed as he took several deep breaths.
Previously: Draco is mad at Harry for freeing Dobby. Third Year Begins.
“I bet with those cameras they already know. But yeah, to be safe,” and a second later, red sparks could be seen above the maze.
Draco had his eyes clenched shut, head thrown back as he rode out the pleasure that was being pounded into him. He couldn’t have seen or cared about anything happening outside of the love they were making.
They both giggled again, and Harry blushed, but pretended he hadn’t heard. Mandy said at a slightly higher volume, (and Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to hear or not) “that one’s special though.” His blush deepened.
Sarah gasped and moved closer to him. “Why no, I don’t, but I’d love to hear some!”
things.” Now it was Harry’s turn to scoff.
“Will you look at the time? I really must be going.”
Eventually, Draco whispered that it was time to go. Harry nodded but didn’t move. Draco cupped his face and kissed him, and it was absolutely wonderful.
There were murmurs, gasps, sobs. Harry didn’t care about any of the noises made, he just hoped they’d leave him alone.
“You haven’t told her anything, have you?” Harry asked hurriedly.
“Sirius!” Harry coughed. “Where’d you go?” He had been mysteriously absent for quite a while.
“I just mean that it’s ok, and everything’s going to be fine.”
Draco released his relieved breath. “Thanks, Sweetie. This is actually attempt number four.”
“I’m not falling for that. What do you want, Malfoy?” Draco pouted. He looked around the room as he thought.
“Harry, you know that we are your friends, don’t you?” Hermione, relaxing her pose but the tense look in her eyes didn’t leave.
Draco blushed. “A bit, maybe. Why?”
She had made up that story she told at the first meeting, well, half of it. The part about liking a boy had certainly been true, but she didn’t have a special girl in mind. At least, she hadn’t going in. She thought about Luna, the girl had just popped into her head, when she was telling that story. It wasn’t in a romantic way, just in a friendship sense, she didn’t feel that way about women.
(See the end of the chapter for
His relationship with Draco could be hard at times. It was difficult hiding things from his friends, acquaintances, even strangers. He wanted to shout from the top of the astronomy tower that he had the best boyfriend in the castle, but he couldn’t. He wanted to scream that Draco wasn’t the arsehole everyone expected him to be. He was a true sweetheart, as he called Harry, and it killed him when they had to fight to protect their secret.
Draco
“You know…” Harry said slowly. Draco raised his brows again. “I could be Harry Malfoy, and you could be Draco Potter.” He laughed at the expression on Draco’s face.
“Yeah. I mean why not? It’s not like I have any other prospects at the moment.”
I need a couple more days to finish up year 6, I'll have it done by the next update. I'm really liking how things are turning out, even if it was a bitch to figure out then write. I think you guys will enjoy it! It's even longer than year 5. Year 7 is going to be totally different, have I mentioned that yet? I'm really loving the outline.
“Yeah,” Harry answered, at least he had found his trunk. It was silent as he got dressed in his pajamas and got into bed. He turned over, and it was quiet for a while before Ron spoke.
“Well, yeah.”
Cedric laughed. “Yeah, when we weren’t fighting for our lives. Anyway, Happy Christmas, if I don’t see you.” He walked away, and Harry couldn’t be more relieved. He hurriedly ripped his invisibility cloak out of his bag and ran to their room.
a whole movie? There aren’t any actual people in it?” He asked, looking closer at the poster, as if looking for flaws.
There was dead silence in the kitchen. Harry felt like he was being split in two. He didn’t even want to consider that Ron might be serious. Then, there was a loud pop, and Draco was standing in front of him.
He wondered if there were others that weren’t dancing, for whatever reason. Maybe they hadn’t even attended the ball if they couldn’t be with their chosen partner.
He was shaking as he stood, but he didn’t want to just run away with his tail stuck between his legs. He wanted to make it very clear to everyone there that they were leaving of their free wills, because they couldn’t stand the company, not because they felt ashamed.
“Well, that’s fine by me, I don’t mind waiting, especially considering how long I’ve made you wait. Why do you want to be on the bottom?”
Hermione looked stunned. “Why ever not?”
Draco gasped, and Harry let out a breath in return. Draco blew air against his ear again and Harry let out a strangled moan. He loved kissing.
There's a reason for the way Draco and Harry started out and now it's different, and I like this way better. We're seeing the beginnings of their romantic relationship in this chapter, but the groundwork has already been laid with their friendship.
Still, he would keep trying, because he needed to get out of here.
Umbridge appeared confused as well. Draco shook his head, deciding to ignore Harry. “I found him in the alcove, Professor. He wasn’t anywhere near the room.” Harry wasn’t sure whether to punch him or kiss him. Neither was a good idea, so he did neither.
“You thought he cheated too, Ron!”
Harry used his own wand to conjure a blanket and draped it over the both of them. “Good?” Harry asked, not feeling like using more words. Draco hummed positively, apparently not wanting the same.
Draco sighed wistfully. “Not this summer, Sweetheart. I want to live with you as soon as we graduate, though.”
“Yum.” Harry said, he was rather hungry, he and Draco hadn’t ended up eating last night. There was silence as they all dug into their food.
“Oh yeah. I’m safe there. I’m real safe.” They all looked at each other, yet again, and his temper was above the surface.
Finally, there were more couples on the floor dancing. Harry caught Sally staring yearningly at Mandy one time too many and lead her over to the table she and Ron were at. Mandy sprang up and hugged her the moment they were close enough. Harry smiled at the sight and sat next to Ron, who was staring at Hermione dancing with Krum.
Draco nodded. “We may have to check with Sirius.” He pointed out, but Harry shook his head.
“I think…we need to wait, and make sure he’s not going to get out any time soon. As soon as he’s convicted, we’ll have our coming out party.” Harry grinned and kissed him hard.
Merry Christmas, or whatever you happen to celebrate, if anything. I wish that Christmas could have been covered in this chapter but *spoiler* it doesn't really go into it much in the next chapter anyway. This chapter is the first Beta Read chapter, I think the quality has definitely improved! I'd like to take a moment to thank her for all the work she has put in so far. This chapter is dedicated to her.
Draco snorted, and shook his head with his eyes closed. “Harry, you are very lucky you have a boyfriend already.”
“You have thought of everything, haven’t you?” Harry pulled his bag up to his lap and handed Draco his main present. Draco raised an eyebrow as he took in the professional wrapping.
“What?” He asked stupidly.
“Objection, relevance, again.”
“Well, I guess I’ll see you in a bit.” Harry said to Sirius, who looked at Mrs. Weasley with reluctance.
“Let’s not listen to Harry. He’s only risked his life every damn year he’s been at Hogwarts when something inevitably happens. He has no reason to be believed.”
“Hagrid, McGonagall, Flitwick, and the Minister?” Draco whispered. “Let’s go.”
“Harry, I love you.” He said. Harry sucked in air. “I know you’re not ready to say it back yet, but does it hurt you if I say it?”
As he was staring, Draco made eye contact with him, then gave him the once over, then spun on his heels, taking in his surroundings. Ron and Hermione had lowered their wands, but when they saw Draco, they raised them again.
“You’ll be wearing clothing under the robes,” the seamstress pointed out, perhaps trying to gain favor in the conversation but Draco didn’t acknowledge her.
Harry choked on his cake. “Really?”
“Just in case, you go first, I’ll follow in a minute.” Draco nodded and gave him a quick kiss.
“Harry, what are we doing?” Hermione asked as they moved forward together.
Draco sighed and squeezed Harry’s hand. “If you didn’t exist, if we didn’t fall in love and get married, if things had happened a certain way and I was a good little heir, I would probably have been engaged before my eighteenth birthday. It’s actually a bit unusual to wait so long, I’m considered pretty old for someone of my ‘nobility,’” he used air-quotes, briefly letting go of Harry’s hand. “Most of the Slytherins in my year are already engaged, matched ideally. You have to remember, it’s not about what’s best for the couple, it’s about what family will bring the most honor to the name. I’ve heard of families trading contracts in later years, when it was discovered they were too closely related or something.”
Ron took a step closer to him, pointing his finger in Harry’s face. Harry didn’t flinch. “No, he fucking isn’t.”
“We don’t have to,” Draco assured him, hand on the door handle, pausing. Harry swallowed again and nodded. Draco pulled himself off Harry and grabbed the wireless before leading him out the door, down the stairs and over the sand towards the lightly lapping water. “This is where we became husbands,” he told Harry unnecessarily.
“How romantic,” Harry whispered back. Draco snorted as he repositioned to the headboard where Harry had made room for him. They kissed once more, and Draco looked down at their clasped hands. He was rubbing his thumb lightly over Harry’s.
“I just had a very interesting talk with Hermione and Ginny. They seem to think that you think you’re possessed.”
Harry was enjoying the moment, the closeness, but as he looked away from Draco’s intense eyes, he caught sight of his watch. He couldn’t hide the wince. “What?” Draco asked, looking down.
“How long does it take these girls to get ready?” Ron asked. Harry shrugged. He personally didn’t mind waiting, he wasn’t keen for the Ball to start.
Despite the rocky start, they had a lovely time over Christmas break, and before Harry knew it, it was time to go back to school. The only bad thing that had happened was Snape informing him he was going to be his Occlumency teacher. He had read up on the theory and thought he had a reasonably good handle on it, but he was not looking forward to it, or going back to school. He was going back to Hogwarts for two things, the DA and Draco. He had fantasized about staying with Sirius and not having to go back, but he couldn’t be separated from Draco that long. He just hated Umbridge and her methods of taking away everything that was important to him.
Draco stared at him. “Where are the tables?”
Harry pulled him into another hug, swaying him gently back and forth. It was funny, not really, but seeing Draco completely panic was actually helping him calm down. It was also wonderful having an advocate that truly cared about his wellbeing, especially after that meeting. Another year, another plot to kill him. That was how life at Hogwarts was.
He couldn’t quite put in to words what he wanted to say, but as he was struggling, opening his mouth ineffectively, Draco shook his head and placed his finger against Harry’s lips. Harry closed his eyes, nodded, and kissed the finger. He wasn’t sure who moved first, but he found himself encased in Draco’s arms. They stood there for a long moment, swaying gently, Draco offering his comfort and Harry drinking it up greedily.
Draco took a deep breath and pulled Harry closer to him with his free arm. Harry made a hum of appreciation before turning his head, so it was closer to Draco’s. Neither woke.
One good thing the article did was dissuade girls from talking to him. He had noticed that the amount of girls giggling around him had dramatically increased. When the Ball was announced, the number seemed to double. He on-impulse said no to the first several that asked him to go with them. The problem was, there was only one person he would want to go with, and it was the one person he couldn’t.
He trusted Draco to tell him that something was wrong, but he was concerned that Draco didn’t know he could. Something was wrong, something bad, and he needed to help Draco. Draco needed him.
He was still rubbing his eyes when the words registered. The screams outside the tent had turned from celebratory to panicked.
Mandy took Luna off to her compartment, and their next visitor was Dean Thomas. “Ginny.” He said, and there was a note of anger in the tone.
“So, you lied to us? Over a nightmare? We would have understood. You could have woken us up.”
“Can we get wine, Harry?” Draco asked, looking down at the menu.
He took Draco’s hand and pulled him out of the Hall. Draco caught up quickly and began pulling him in a different direction than what he expected. “Where are we going?” Harry asked.
Draco may have started it, but the other Slytherins joined in, and soon there was a yelling match. To make things more even, Harry started slinging mud at the Slytherins. He avoided Draco as he didn’t want to make things worse than they were already, even if he was slightly miffed that Draco had reacted so badly. Chaos ensued for several minutes, with one of the boys saying the shack really was haunted. Draco’s lips twitched as he tried valiantly not to laugh. That only spurred Harry on.
“Ah, but the rules clearly state that it’s ‘whose name comes out.’ Not whose name who has placed it in. I suppose this is a flaw in the magic of the Tournament that hasn’t been discovered yet. Regardless, I fear you will have to compete, Harry.”
“And here’s Weasley!” He announced loudly, “with his girlfriend.” All the Slytherins laughed, but Harry alone heard the cut for what it was against Harry.
“But you’re my boyfriend!” She wailed loudly.
He was tired as the weeks went by, made worse by his tough nights. He kept having this strange dream where he was running down a long hallway, the door forever stretching ahead of him. It had been happening since the summer, and he was sick and tired of it. He awoke still feeling tired.
Harry didn’t realize it was Valentine’s day until he arrived in the Great Hall to see it decorated with pink hearts. It wasn’t nearly as bad as two years previous, but it still sent a spasm of dread up his spine. He had completely forgotten the holiday, and he had a boyfriend who was probably expecting something. Not daring to look over to the Slytherin table, he wiped off flower petals from the seat at Gryffindor table before sitting down.
“Coward?” He screamed back. “Coward, am I, Potter? Your father—”
“As important as I’m sure it was,” Hermione said tensely, “it is very much like you to not think through a dangerous situation. Who knows how many people you could have endangered with whatever it was you were doing?”
They enjoyed their dinner, and quickly dubbed it a date that would need to be repeated. Afterwards, Harry escorted Draco back to his common room, received a kiss, and headed up to his.
Professor Dumbledore always seemed to have a way of making Harry feel guilty. He had a feeling that he knew that Harry had been in Hogsmeade, but for some reason he was willing to let Harry get away with it. Harry nodded, trying to fight the nausea he was now feeling.
A very silvery blushing Myrtle let out a wail befitting to her name and exited through the toilet in the corner.
“You promise?” Harry asked, intertwining their hands. Their arms were wrapped together around Harry’s torso.
He went on, however. “What house do you think you’ll be sorted into?”
“You’re…really scared about that, aren’t you?” Mandy asked quietly. “I knew you were nervous, but I didn’t realize…” This was quickly getting personal, and Harry felt a bit out of place. Luckily, the song that had been playing had drawn to a close, so he had a reasonable escape.
Harry whispered it in his ear. Draco raised an eyebrow. “A little conceited, don’t you think?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry tried not to feel betrayed, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t say anything. “Harry, I know that you heard the talk at St. Mungo’s. I wish you hadn’t, but maybe it’s a good thing. I was always in favor of telling you everything, but Dumbledore is a lot wiser than me. But I’m your godfather, and my first priority is you.” Harry still didn’t look at him or say anything. He had never been an adult’s first priority before, it was hard not to get choked up.
He waited to see what Draco would say. “I was working on homework and got caught up. I didn’t see your message until five minutes ago.” Harry really wanted to believe that, but he had a hard time with it. “Did you have a hard time with the charms essay? I had to look in five different books to really get the concept…” Harry listened, but Draco went on and on about the stupid charms essay for what felt like forever. He was still curious about Draco’s behavior recently. Was he sick? Had something happened to his mother?
“Hey gorgeous,” Draco said when Harry was right in front of him. Harry let out a relieved sigh, Draco was meeting his eyes and hadn’t looked down. Harry sunk further into the bubbles, alright with postponing that conversation. He had decided not to lie to Draco if he asked where the scars came from, he already knew most of it.
“No,” Harry said, taking deep calming breaths. “Sirius, something just happened. I was taking my History of Magic O.W.L., and I fell asleep.”
“Alright. I’ll close the curtains and bark if someone comes over here. No funny business, I’ll be right outside on the ground.”
Their walk down to the Great Hall was silent, both of them on full alert. They ran into no one, though Harry wasn’t surprised by that. At the doors to the Hall, he was attacked by a bushy-haired girl and red head, not to mention a hoard of Gryffindors. He tried not to tense up too much at being more surrounded than he was used to being.
Defense Against the Dark Arts was even worse than Harry had hoped. Umbridge, the teacher, was refusing to let them use magic, and was spewing the propaganda that Voldemort wasn’t back. Harry got detentions for a week for that. On the plus side, he had a very pleasant conversation with McGonagall.
“Sorry, Severus, I thought you were choking.” She said crossly when he turned to glare.
Did he have time to write him a farewell letter? Draco would kill him either way if he died, but maybe a letter would help soothe his hurt. He shook his head. He had no time, he had already wasted enough checking to see if he was right about it being a trap. He was obviously wrong, and Sirius was being tortured, right now.
“Part of being an adult means acknowledging your mistakes and taking responsibility for them. I had you in my arms, Harry. That night, after your parents died, I was holding you when Hagrid came up to me. He said he had instructions to take you to Dumbledore. He convinced me to hand you over, and I never should have done it. But I did want to be the one to find Wormtail. I wanted to look him in the eye and ask him why he did it. I don’t know even now what I was planning to do when I got him. I never should have given you up, and I’m sorry for that.” Harry had been looking down at his knees, it was getting harder and harder to not let out a sob.
“We don’t need to be together constantly.” At Ron’s continued look, he snorted. “Alright, he made eyes with one of Fleur’s relatives, and they went off alone.”
Sally raised her eyebrows. “I’m not one for gossip. Mandy is, but we have an understanding that we don’t talk to each other about our friend’s secrets. So, whatever you want to tell me, I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“You fucking bastard,” Ron snarled. “My mum cried she was so upset you didn’t want to come to her party. Thought she had done something wrong. What was so damn important you couldn’t stop by?”
“That’s the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard! Oh, Harry…” She gave him another weird look, looking up, blinking slowly but frequently, and swayed from side to side. A lot of girls had been looking at him that way recently, was there something in the water? She looked like an airhead like that, therefore less attractive in Harry’s opinion. Then again, what did he care what she looked like? She could walk around looking like a complete dunderhead and it wouldn’t concern him. He left pretty quickly after that, regardless, even if Filch hadn’t had come in accusing him of mailing dung bombs. Cho had saved him from getting detention for that.
“Alright.” Harry said, still hesitantly. “So, you came to warn me about Black?”
“Can we take a nap?” Draco asked sleepily. Harry kissed his neck and set an alarm for a couple hours later.
“Yeah, that’s the general idea.” Draco laughed and sat back, putting his head in his hands.
“Well,” Draco drawled, “Slytherin is the best of course, then you have Ravenclaw, bunch of know-it-alls, Hufflepuffs are dunderheads, then you have Gryffindors. They’re the enemies of Slytherins, all brave and noble.” The last part was said in a mocking voice.
Really, he was still dreaming, his conscious mind locked away.
“Thanks for coming, Harry.” Bill said as he closed the door behind him. “We didn’t want you to have to come out of hiding, but I promise it won’t be long, unless you want to stay for a bit, and we’re about as protected as we could possibly be right now.” He led them into the sitting room, where the Weasley family sans Charlie, and Hermione were gathered. Percy was laying on the longest couch, his left hand clasped in Mrs. Weasley’s hands.
Was this supposed to happen?
He walked to the counter where the kettle was and busied himself with making tea.
“It’s your day, you decide.” Draco smiled at Harry, lightly bumping his shoulder against Harry’s, when the door opened. They both quietened as a head poked out, looking both ways, before the rest of the body came through.
Sirius shook his head. “I want to explain.” He was silent for several moments then said, “I really messed up when I went to Azkaban, and I’m still paying for it.” Harry opened his mouth, but Sirius went on. “I missed so much of your life, Harry, I just wasn’t expecting for my time with you to end before I was ready.”
“Can—” Harry’s voice caught. He cleared his thought and started again. “Can I see their…graves?” Sirius’s carefully controlled face crumbled, but he nodded. Harry wasn’t sure what to say. “You don’t have to—”
Angelina, who had been made quidditch captain, was most displeased he would be missing the tryouts, but there was nothing to be done for it.
“No,” Draco said with only a little bit of tenseness. “I’m just disappointed our time was cut short, that’s all.” Harry couldn’t help feeling like that wasn’t all there was to it.
“Sirius, I promise nothing untoward will happen. We just want to be near each other. After the day we had? Please?”
“I am the only one allowed to help you do anything in the shower.” He snarled.
They ended up walking up and down Diagon Alley just once, stopping on occasion to look at the store fronts. It wasn’t the Alley they were used to. More stores were boarded up than last summer and shoppers were in even more of a hurry. They left quickly.
“Never mind, I’ll rephrase.” Mr. Morgan looked pleased, almost doing a Malfoy smirk. Harry wondered if that’s where he got it, it was like a cheap knockoff. “When Mr. Black confronted Mr. Pettigrew and you bore witness, did Mr. Pettigrew have a wand?”
Draco considered him. “How would you feel about me staying?”
, do you?”
Draco nodded in approval, then moved his arm up and down in the air in front of him. Another good idea, Harry rubbed her back. Draco nodded, then opened his mouth and opened and closed his hand in front of it, as if he were speaking. “I’m sorry?” Harry asked, then realized he had spoken aloud. Mandy however, sniffed, and calmed down.
“Nothing. Just…you can come talk to me, about anything, alright? I really would like to try and be friends, just friends. If you were serious about that."
In the morning, Hermione was waiting for them in the Common Room as usual, but she and Ron continued acting strange. They were very purposefully not mentioning anything that could be related to Draco. Their fixed smiles had become incredibly creepy. They continually stared at him, making sure that they were on either side of Harry. It was useful when someone came up to him, as they couldn’t touch him.
“Mmhm.” Draco said around him, sending vibrations down his dick. He moaned, one hand going for his sheets, one for the top of Draco’s soft hair. He didn’t often see it without gel, he really liked it.
He laid down on the bed next to Draco’s, not bothering to find pajamas for himself. Harry looked across the small space, staring at Draco as long as he could before his eyelids finally closed, not opening again until morning.
Harry giggled, blushing lightly. “It’s called a vibrator. You turn it on and it vibrates.”
“I’m fine,” Dumbledore returned, and Harry thought it might be like all those times he said he was fine and wasn’t.
“You poor, plebian peasant.” Harry smiled and kissed him. It was slow and sweet, filled with fondness and acceptance.
Conversation echoed around him, but none of it mattered. He fell to the side, the warmth, where Sirius was. Sirius let him, and Harry curled up with his head on Sirius’s thigh. He felt so sick. He would never be well again.
“I love you too, despite your horrid naming abilities.” Harry leaned forward to give Draco another long, lingering kiss.
Harry nodded, that was the smarter plan. He picked Draco up again, wishing he was just a bit lighter, holding his wand aloft. It was a struggle while holding Draco and hoped that he’d be able to take the majority of the spellcasting.
The kiss had been perfect, everything she had ever wanted. Was it not what he was expecting? She took another look at him, and really, really saw him, perhaps for the first time.
“Yes. I’ll tell you as many times as you need, since you’re so thick it takes forever to get through your skull.” Harry laughed in surprise again, as Draco pushed him down and kissed the center of his chest. Harry fought with him for dominance, feeling a little frisky.
They said a quick goodbye, sans a kiss, and Draco left under Harry’s invisibility cloak.
“Stole.” Madam Pomfrey muttered.
Randomly, a thought entered Harry’s head. Newton’s Law of Motion.
“Harry, aren’t you concerned?” Draco asked as he followed behind his husband.
He looked at Voldemort, was he awake now, where was he? Voldemort was yelling, the Death Eaters were shouting at him, he had a massive headache, and his feet were cold. He just wanted to go back to bed. Whatever had happened to him, was ending, as was his life, he thought.
“Yes. May I owl you during the course of the rest of the summer?” Harry was confused for a moment before remembering how Hagrid had communicated with the Headmaster.
“Because I’m angry with them.” They had barely talked to him all summer, and when they did, they bragged about how they were together or told him to stay out of trouble. Harry hadn’t had that great of a summer. Harry knew most of this wasn’t Ron and Hermione’s fault, but he couldn’t help being cross with them for their part.
"Then why--"
Harry stared at Moody.
He looked up into Draco’s eyes, swimming in his emotions. He ignored the tear tracks on his own face, cupping Draco’s instead and wiping at his face with his thumbs. Draco sucked in a breath and did the same to Harry.
“I’m sorry. I just wasn’t sure how you’d react.”
Other times, when I’m lying in bed waiting for sleep to come for me, I think about the good times we have had together. Ok, so they have been few and far in between, but I like to think upon them fondly. I also think about all the good times that we will have. I think about us flying together, sometimes we are playing quidditch on opposing sides and sometimes we are chasers working together on the same team. Other times we are simply flying side by side in the country side, maybe across the grounds at my manor. I’d love to go flying over the ocean some time. I think it’s against the rules to fly over the lake, but perhaps we can try it one of these days when we’re feeling reckless.
Draco was the king on Valentine’s. He decided when each new stage came. He helped Harry out of the tub and their muddy footprints lead a trail over to the shower.
“You promised me a clothing optional honeymoon. Well, I’ve decided I quite like having you naked and ready for whatever whim might have me.”
“I do.” Draco said. Harry expected him to go on, but instead he pulled on Harry’s shirt and was kissing him. Harry smiled into the kiss and just let it happen.
“What were they doing in there?” Harry asked suspiciously as they called forth their own room.
Draco threw an amused look as he gestured for Harry to precede him. Harry rolled his eyes, he had a feeling Draco was going to try to out gentlemen him.
That made some people start trying harder, but not all of them. Draco gave Harry a long-suffering sigh and look then start moving about the room, correcting people on their holds, stances, or pronunciation. The first couple people Draco corrected did not take it well. Angelina Johnson called Draco Death Eater scum and to stay away from her. He reacted with a raised brow and said fine, if you can disarm me. She couldn’t. After that, people were politer but almost everyone was cold.
“Want to keep looking around?” Draco asked knowingly. Harry nodded.
Hermione sighed. “I was afraid something like this would happen.”
He had decided that he really needed to talk to Harry, at least a little. He had been testing the waters, but it was time to at least dip his toes in.
“I don’t know, Baby, maybe it would be good if we could have a spy on the inside. If it is Snape though…” A rush of anger pulsed deep within him.
“Give them a minute.” He said quietly.
“We should check him for dark magic,” Ron said to Hermione. “Who’s to say he hasn’t hexed him to make him think this is all true when he really is trying to take advantage of him?”
Mrs. Weasley appeared to disagree with Sirius. “You can’t be serious! He’s just a boy, he can’t be asking anything he wants!”
Draco merely raised his eyebrows up and down and backed away. Harry wouldn’t say he exactly ‘enjoyed’ the solo shower, but it was nice to get a minute to himself. His emotions were swirling around inside his chest like a storm. Away from his fiancé, he felt his nerves come even more alive, but he was able to sort through his feelings a little easier.
Draco shuffled to his seat in between Vincent and Greg, looking around nervously, though he was skilled in hiding it. All around him people were finding their own seats excitedly, the bastards. Draco just wanted Harry to finish the damn task quickly and get back into his arms. These vultures were hoping to see some carnage.
Harry and George didn’t talk as they walked. Harry thought it was a bit unfair that he was in trouble too. They had just made it to McGonagall’s office when she came storming up.
“You wouldn’t understand, Scar-Head. Let me go.” Draco pulled once on his arm, but it wasn’t very strong.
Harry shrugged. “You’ll have to ask one of them.” He grinned, that had felt good to say. The girls laughed in response to that.
He decided to talk to Sirius, this was a bit over his head, and he could use some advice from an adult who knew about them. He mentioned the idea to Draco, who sighed and agreed they could use some help. Harry kissed him in thanks, he knew it was hard for him to give up that control. Harry told Draco about the lifelong ban, and he was suitably angry.
Harry hesitated. “Technically, the plan doesn’t rely on the both of us doing this. You can still go home, and wait for me there. Actually, yeah, why don’t you do that, and I’ll—”
He hummed, “this is good. Excellent job, Baby.” Draco beamed; it was true too, the cake was a little bit dry and crumbly, but the chocolate taste was perfect and the icing spread evenly.
Almost immediately after he and Ron had cautiously made up on a contingency basis, McGonagall returned his firebolt. It was with his firebolt that he won them the game with Ravenclaw, which meant they were competing for the Quidditch Cup with Slytherin. Harry was nervous about competing against Draco, the earlier loss had really shaken his confidence. He did feel unbeatable with his firebolt, however. He just didn’t want anything to come between him and Draco. Draco seemed to think Slytherin was doomed to lose, and he became a little despondent and moody as a result.
Draco only lasted until they were out of the Great Hall before he pushed Harry up against the wall. There were times when Harry reacted in fear to such treatment, but this was not one of those times. If anything, his eyes started gleaming, and his breath caught.
Draco continued.
Previously: "Draco hummed in delight. “And miss going out in public with you on our first date? No way. We’re going. It’s my birthday. Anything you want to do to me will have to wait until after we eat.” He said with a cheeky grin.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, turning in his seat to follow her progress. There was an overweight man wearing a suit and tie in the back near the kitchens. Sarah took his arm, whispered in his ear and the two went into the kitchen.
Draco nodded, closing his eyes as if picturing it. “Anywhere specific?”
The door opened behind them, and they both jumped. “Everything ok in here?” Sirius asked doubtfully.
He pictured Draco being hurt, tortured, alone, scared. In his more hopeful times, Draco was just being kept at his manor, away from public eye and not treated badly. He had an awful feeling that wasn’t true, however. It kept him going, reading when his eyes were tired, eating to keep his energy up, sleeping when he collapsed.
Harry took a deep breath, unable to completely contain his smile. “You’re free.” He said simply, a little choked up. Sirius stared at him, open mouthed as he took several deep breaths.
As it was, however, Draco was floating asleep under the lake, where the second task of the Triwizard Tournament was happening. Apparently, Harry was supposed to rescue Draco. He really hadn’t expected that to happen, Draco was the last person he expected to be chosen. He had no idea how the judges had even found out about their relationship.
Harry leaned over to kiss him on the cheek and neck a couple times, but Draco didn’t get involved, too entranced by the movie happening to focus on Harry. He chuckled lightly and tried to focus on the movie, but Draco was so distracting. He kept gasping, jumping, cooing, squeezing Harry’s hand, patting him on the arm to make sure he was paying attention, muttering to himself, screaming and cheering.
Another finger joined the others and Harry squirmed a little uncomfortably. He had never been stretched so far. Draco kissed the inside of Harry’s thigh in sympathy and hit that special spot inside him. Harry arched and let lose a screech of joy. “That’s my man,” Draco whispered against Harry’s leg. His cock was twitching, wanting more stimulation. He reached down and started stroking it lazily, wanting to get to the dildo before he came.
Is anyone wondering why Draco is ok with saying he's gay but not that he's in a relationship with Harry? I see it as the boys in his dorm probably suspect it, Blaise is there so he already knows, and Draco isn't really afraid that it will get back to his father, though he'd rather avoid it if possible. That would be next to impossible if he told them about Harry.
Draco was alive, and that meant he wasn’t dead, and that meant he was living. Draco was alive. Draco was alive. Draco was alive.
This was exactly what Draco needed. It had been hell recently. Starting with Harry’s coma, then his awful time at Malfoy Manor, and his time under the Imperius curse. He was unable to respond, or even move since his father had ordered him to sleep, but he had been somewhat aware of what was happening around him the entire time. It had been pure torture. He hadn’t been in his room for long before he was rescued by Dobby, but the panic that had been cleansed by his rescue quickly returned after learning his father refused to lift the curse. He wasn’t sure how he had come out of the curse. That was something to figure out later.
“Where have you been?” Hermione seemed to think was a more important question.
Draco nodded seriously. “That makes sense. I know you’ll be at the center of it, and parenting takes one hundred percent of your focus and time. You mentioned when we would do the ceremony?”
“Draco.” Was all she needed to say, in a scary mother tone of voice, for Draco to quieten.
Draco pushed Harry to the floor, moving his robes aside to see the damage. Harry was wearing a thin t-shirt under his robes, which Draco pulled up to see the long cut along his side. Hermione appeared on Harry’s other side.
Harry bit his lip. “I’m jealous of him too. I get it. It’s like… he has no clue how lucky he is, and I just want to hit him over the head to get it through his thick skull: your family is brilliant, and you don’t get to bemoan them unless your family is nonexistent. Or cruel.” He added. They had danced around the issue of their families before but only some superficial stuff.
“Alright, Harry?” Cedric asked, looking at Draco. Cho was gaping and didn’t seem to care that she was.
He was in so much pain. So much pain.
Ron and Hermione had grabbed his arms, pulling him up, shouting their joy. A smile slowly spread across Harry’s face as he finally realized this was real.
“Nope, that’s a surprise too. We might want to give it an hour or two to get settled in.”
“All better.” He declared. Draco rolled his eyes but smiled.
. It’s them that needs to change, not us.” Harry nodded but still couldn’t help but feel like he had done something wrong. He knew, intellectually, that it wasn’t his fault. He saw the looks in the eyes of the people who had judged them, and couldn’t get it out of his mind. “Harry, look at me.” Draco could always see right through him. “We didn’t do anything wrong, sweetheart.” Draco said it so sincerely, so earnestly, that Harry found himself believing him.
He was beautiful, absolutely gorgeous. His sweat stuck to his skin and reflected the sun, creating a glow around him. There was a smile stretched across his face, and it made him look incredible. His hair was windblown, downright crazy, and she wanted nothing more than to kiss those lips, running her fingers through that hair.
He never would have suspected these two were close, much less friends, much less lovers. For a brief moment, he was happy for both of them. He was reminded again of him and Gellert, and he was ecstatic that love had triumphed for at least one of them, temporary as it may be. This did mean a change of plan was in order, however.
He got dressed in a hurry, not wanting to keep Draco. He tried to match Draco’s level of style, but he was sure he managed it. Still, Draco turned from the center of the living room, and stared. Harry was happy with the reaction.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on?” McGonagall asked.
He took several deep breaths as he held the sword almost reverently. “I can’t believe it,” he said quietly. “Godric Gryffindor held this sword, Harry. Who knows all the things he did with it. And it survived. All this time. This is…” He apparently didn’t have the words to complete the thought.
They continued, their voices intermingling, each trying to be louder than the other. Harry sat back a bit, an odd arrangement of emotions playing inside him. Despite expecting something like this, he was a bit surprised, annoyed, angered, nervous, relieved, and happy. He could understand most of the emotions, but the last two required some thought. He realized that he was relieved to have finally gotten that big secret off his chest, and happy that he no longer had to keep it. He also felt a bit vindicated at their reactions. He knew more than ever that it was right to keep things from them based on their reactions.
He put his hand into the closest pile, coming back with a bottle of sherry. That was strange. There were books, broken pieces of furniture, random objects. He went further into the room, looking around in interest. Ahead of him was a bust with a tiara on its head. He strode forward, something about the crown calling to him. His vision tunneled strangely, and he heard strange whispering. His fingers reached out, about to touch the odd thing.
“Really? That’s fantastic! He made up with the Weasleys?” Despite his problems with Ron, none of the others had really done anything to him, and he wanted the best for each and every one.
“There’s no chance for us, is there?” Ginny asked, sounding more resigned than anything. “I really thought there was something between us, but I guess I must have imagined it.”
Draco caught his lips with his own. “Come back inside.” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips. Harry was powerless to deny him.
Ron looked around the Great Hall and shoveled another fork-full of food into his mouth. Hermione usually bugged him not to talk around his food and for once, he was using the opportunity to do some thinking. It wasn’t that he never thought, he thought all the time, despite what certain Slytherins (and brothers) thought. It was just that he enjoyed the quiet for uninterrupted contemplation. Not that it was quiet, just his friends weren’t talking.
Harry smiled at Draco’s bashfulness, giving him a light kiss to the cheek.
“You really are amazing, Harry.” Draco said quietly. Harry tightened his hold.
Harry looked down. “What about…I have a fear of intimacy, Draco. It can’t be easy, and we should be having sex by now, but we aren’t, because of me. I’m tired of my own mood swings, you have to be too.”
“I have not,” Draco acknowledged. “I will, however, be using invisible ink, I’m not entirely sure why no one else did.” As he got out a quill and ink well, Hermione scoffed.
Harry blushed lightly, eyeing Draco from the corner of his eye. “It was nothing. And that’s not what I meant about the heaviness. Well, not really, I don’t know how to describe it. It’s just…off, somehow.”
Harry shook his head. “That doesn’t make any sense. I know Draco, and I trust him with my life. He would never do anything to hurt me.” At their horror stricken looks, he continued. “But if you want an answer to the question, I was the one to come to him, not the other way around. If his Father wanted to hand me over to Voldemort, or whatever, he could have kidnapped me when we first met. It doesn’t make any sense for him to want to hurt me. Believe me.” He added, at their disbelief.
“I can’t believe it! He’s choking! Move aside, I’ll do it!” The one that wasn’t holding the other stepped forward, but the one on the left held him back.
There was more silence. Then, a response, and Harry could practically feel Draco’s sigh and scorn.
Harry grinned. “Well, I’d hate for you to drink alone, and I figured you’d like having a matching set, for when we have special occasions.”
“I’m doing great. And you?”
After she caught him by the door for the third time, she had force fed him a sleeping potion and he had been knocked out. When he awoke, he was indeed strapped down to the bed. It took several hours of wiggling, but he managed to make it out of the straps. Madam Pomfrey had been upset to see him free, but he had promised not to try to leave before she said so if he could have some books from the library. She grudgingly agreed and summoned a house elf to bring him some.
“I’m going to be ok,” Draco told him.
“No, it’s a truthful assessment of your tastes.”
Harry wasn’t sure where to start his questions. “I thought most wizards were half-blood or less? Doesn’t that not make sense if there aren’t a lot of Purebloods left?”
The next person, who looked terrified at the prospect of going after Dumbledore, was the first year. He started shaking slightly, but said clearly, “I’m Jamie Henderson. I think my situation is a little different. I'm a girl, trapped in a boy's body." Harry was surprised. He didn't know very much about trans people, had never knowingly met someone like that before, but he was curious to know more. "I like boys, but since I'm a girl, that would make me straight, so I don't know if that means I shouldn't be here."
“So am I!” Harry exclaimed.
Ron and Hermione exchanged pain-filled, sad looks. “Because we’re your best friends?” Harry swallowed. The silence stretched on.
“Hmm.” Draco hummed. “To be honest, I had a crush on The-Boy-Who-Lived as a child, I think every kid our age had one at some point,” he added at Harry’s horrified look, “but we both know that that person and you are totally different. So, at some point they blended, and I developed a crush on you. You, Harry. My friend. No one has ever treated me like you do. You’re so special.”
Once he was done with that conundrum, he had no other choice but to wonder about Draco. Was Draco even gay? That was worth considering. It had seemed like he had taken homophobia personally, which was promising to him. Were there any other indicators? He replayed their every interaction over and over, taking note of little nuances he hadn’t noticed before. He compared them to other couples he had seen. He talked himself into it and right back out. How could Draco—who was nothing short of near perfect to Harry’s eyes—possibly have feelings for him?
“I tried it earlier, it doesn’t work.”
“So, what are we going to do about Crabbe and Goyle?” Harry asked, after they had both awakened. They had laid back and cuddled for a while, but it had been weighing on his mind as he was laying there.
“I knew you would,” Harry said, sticking his finger in the mountain of whipped cream and bringing it to Draco’s lips. Draco licked it, then smirked and picked up his fork. He put it near Harry’s mouth loaded with pancake and Harry took a bit. “We’re definitely going to need it after this sticky breakfast.” Draco continued.
“Not just any Death Eater, Potter. His most loyal servant, and I shall replace Malfoy in the ranks when he finds out about you and his son.” Moody started laughing, slightly hysterically, just as the door banged open.
“I helped her give the potions to Harry.” He said quietly. Hermione could have kissed him.
“Er…Ok. So, back to bed?” Harry grabbed the bottle of expensive Elvin wine rather than potentially damage it with magic.
Ron glared back before turning back to Harry. His body language was very standoffish. He refused to meet Harry’s eyes. Harry could feel some of his euphoria from winning quickly draining from his body. All of a sudden, he was fatigued. He didn’t care how this would go, but he was tired of fighting.
Draco snorted, but Harry reached his hand out for Draco’s, looking at Sarah. “A couple things, actually,” he said as Draco took his hand. “It’s this one’s birthday today, but it’s also our first real date away from school. We’re also got engaged a couple days ago, so I suppose we’re still celebrating that.” He smiled at Draco.
People had started giving him sympathetic looks when they thought he wasn’t looking. It was almost enough to make him regret his outburst. Almost. The result was simply too satisfying.
be ok. Still, he knew he had chosen the harder path by revealing his relationship to the world, and it went against his instincts. He just hoped he wouldn’t regret his choice too much.
“How do you know?”
They yelled out their ecstasy as they came, holding each other close and tight. Harry kissed Draco just as desperately as Draco kissed Harry. Around them, there was a silent explosion as they were completed in more ways than one. The light had turned gold, and sprinkled down, disappearing in twinkles.
They did so, and Harry realized immediately he had been wrong when he thought her house wasn’t pink. It was like her office, only about ten times worse. The color of her office had at least been somewhat soft, but these walls were more describable as a ‘hot pink’ that was absolutely painful to look at. Harry’s eyes watered and he looked down to the carpeted floors, hoping for respite already. Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust as he levitated one of the dozens of doilies littered on every flat surface up. “Don’t touch anything,” he muttered to Harry. He had a brief moment of wondering if that was so they didn’t leave fingerprints, or if he just didn’t want Harry to become contaminated. He didn’t ask.
Draco sighed. “Well, I grew up in the Pureblood circle, and marriage isn’t always taken as a ‘one-and-only-for-the-rest-of-your-life.’ Affairs aren’t encouraged, or anything like that, but it’s more common than you’d think. Pure-Blood marriage isn’t about love, only about producing an heir, and once that heir is produced, pretty much anything is alright. It all depends on the marriage contract, however. Sometimes only the male is allowed ot have affairs, other times neither cares, sometimes the families want to at least maintain the image of propriety so it’s decided between the couples privately, and then there’s the time when there actually is love in a marriage and neither seeks it elsewhere.”
“Er…” Harry started, unsure what was happening.
He would always love him. Always. And forever.
Draco looked stunned. “Not really. Maybe, honestly, I’ve looked at someone and my brain jumped to picture it. But no matter what, it’s never as good as what we have. I would never want anyone but you Harry. From what I understand, it’s a healthy thing to look on occasion. I would never betray you, but do you think it’s wrong, if my mind jumps to something without consciously thinking about it?”
This chapter gave me so much trouble, for a lot of reasons. It went through changes weekly and I'm honestly still debating a couple parts, but decided to just go ahead and post, especially considering how long it's been since the last update. My laptop also went through a slow death, so finally gave in and got a new one that is soooooo much better.
Draco tightened his hold and Harry felt safe.
“I wasn’t!” Ron blushed, avoiding her eyes. “You just don’t understand Hermione, it’s a pureblood thing—” That was Harry’s cue to leave as they were off arguing.
“How can you tell?” She asked.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered when Draco asked what house he was going to be in. “What’s the difference?”
The LGBTQ club Mandy had started had its first meeting on a Saturday in an unused classroom in the Charms corridor. Harry was surprised at how many familiar faces he saw, and there were more people than he was expecting. The room had been fitted with comfortable couches and armchairs, there were even a couple beanbag chairs. They were positioned in a circle, at the middle was a table loaded with assortments of bottled beverages and finger foods. Harry took a seat next to Luna on a long sofa and asked how many more people were coming.
“Sorry,” Draco whispered. “It’s just a little hard to hear sometimes. I’ll get over it.” Oh. Harry smiled sheepishly and kissed Draco’s forehead. “I always want to hear everything about you, Harry.” Draco smiled, and kissed his forehead. Then the bridge of his nose, then the tip. Finally, he got to his lips, and kissed those too. He spent much longer on those than anything else, then moved down to his chin, and lowered them to his neck, following the line. Harry let out a breath shakily. It felt amazing.
“I don’t know what to say.” Harry said after a while, referring to the incident that he couldn’t quite get out of his head.
Harry raised a brow. “I used it against Voldemort. It saved my life when I dueled him in June.”
