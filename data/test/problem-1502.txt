Including, Preety Shah, a young Ravenclaw who just joined their ranks. She was on death threat duty for the past week, and Harry can see it wearing on her. Still, he realizes he should have said something sooner when he sees her in an abandoned hallway crying.
Draco takes a deep breath and knows that no one in the building will cut him any slack if he’s rude to her, so he smiles and says, “terribly sorry.”
“My parents had already been married, had a child, and died by the time they were my age,” Harry says.
“But,” Draco adds because he can never quite help himself around Potter. “I will say that this is Charpentier 25 year, and deserves better treatment.”
He doubts they would find it funny, though.
Harry hesitates, as if self-conscious and bites his lip.
Draco feels Harry smile and presses down, “and your smile. It’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It makes me want to see you smile all the time.”
Harry doesn’t answer the question, instead he turns around and presses his shoulders to the mattress while arching back. The view is undeniably spectacular, even more so when he adds a snarky, “Better get to it then.”
Draco pulls Harry gently in the direction of his bedroom. It’s as coolly modern as the rest of the apartment, with a large bed in the center and a not-insignificant chrome and black amount. It always made Draco feel a bit like he is on another planet.
Harry rolls his eyes, finally making it to the bedroom and all but ripping his shirt off. Draco gazes intently at his chest. "You really don't have a scratch on you."
-----------------
"From the necromancers?" Harry says, slightly confused by the seeming non-sequitur.
"It sounds perfect."
“Does that make me your knight in shining armor?” Draco asks flippantly.
"I'm not very good with kids," Draco says eventually, after watching the pair in the picture for a few more minutes. "But I'll try my best."
He takes a breath before sliding his want in a complicated pattern, allowing the elegant, cool blue symphony to rage behind him while he carefully wipes down a glass by hand and places it in front of him, for the liquid to fill. He had it down to a science.
“Head home, we can keep looking through the threats tomorrow.”
Buffy gives him a severe look, “because he is making you happy. Be honest with him.”
Harry stares at him for a second before his face splits into an unbelievably radiant smile. “I like you too.”
Potter responded by showing up to his house, yelling at him, then inviting him for a glass of wine. All around, it had been a hectic day. And it all started because Ms. Weasley decided she wanted some other man. Draco wouldn’t be in this miserable position with Potter if she had simply held up her end of the bargain and married the man after he won a bloody war.
Still, Draco is helpless in the face of Harry Potter and always has been. He slows down though, he’s wanted this in the back of his mind for so long so he takes the moment to savor it. Running his pale finger along Harry’s plump bottom lip, which opens immediately into a startled gasp, Draco can’t help but smirk.
Draco sits up a bit, hitching Harry’s legs more firmly around his waist, and reaches down to grab Harry’s hand. With one arm resting on the bed, keeping him upright, and held tight in Harry’s unrelenting grip, Draco thrusts into him. Firm and hard but slower than he usually does. Without thinking, Draco brings Harry’s hand to his lips and presses a sweet kiss to the back of it, where a nasty scar is etched into his sin.
Harry glances around frantically and sees a table filled with hearty, delicious foods he loves, a no-fuss, but delicious-looking cake, and even a pick-up Quidditch pitch.
"Those songs are really about you?" he asks idly.
“Why not? They’re doing trivia this year, and I have a sneaking suspicion you’ll win, the prize is a brand new MiriPhone.”
on me."
Harry looks up at Draco's gray eyes, and feels the restless tendency of his mind and heart steady and clicks into place. "Yeah, I'll be right here."
Harry shrugged, "okay. Who do we think it is?"
“House-elves always know.”
Draco feels great finally saying it out loud. It’s something he’s felt for years but has had no one to say it to. His parents ran off to France, his friends don’t speak to him anymore, his life is the patrons of this bar and he can’t say that to them.
“Oh,” Harry says, and he sounds completely overcome. Draco wants to spend the rest of his life ripping these vulnerable noises from this invulnerable man. “Oh, Draco, please. I’m so close.”
“You should be thanking me. That elf of yours was muttering about throwing a pitcher of water over you while you were sleeping.”
“Hm,” Harry hummed, pressing a light kiss against Draco’s jaw. “’And then everything ignited, and they were both lost in a furor of need.’ All that from a kiss? I want what he’s having.”
“Oh, right, yes. In the end we let him get a little bit ahead of us and then used a quick tripping jinx. No more breeding dragons for that old coot!” Ron took another bite of the cake and leaned back against the gate in pride.
“I ran into Neville yesterday,” Ron finally started. Harry raised his eyebrows, focused on the damned shelves he was trying to install. He wasn’t ignoring the redhead, just needed to get that project done soon so he could go meet with Neville about the new shop. “Said you were having a few pints with Malfoy earlier this week.”
Harry spelled a large circle of dust away and sat heavily on the floor, leaning forward to pour the tea. Hermione and Ron joined him and drank in silence. The biscuits came and went as did his thoughts. He wondered how much effort it would take to redo the place, as it clearly has seen enough destruction that even ancient household magic couldn’t fix it as soon as Harry walked in the door. And it did not go unnoticed by Harry that all the damage could not possibly be simply because of a lack of dusting. Something happened there. And Bippy was the key.
Later that night, when Wood had made his exit with only a sly smirk sent his way, Draco couldn’t help but think of all the things — well,
Ron and Hermione popped into the lounge right behind him, and he busied himself making tea in the kitchen. They sat in silence around the table as the kettle heated. Harry pulled the scroll towards him and opened it again, eyes lingering on each word. He desperately wished it told him something about the Potter family. An itching in the back of his brain distracted him from his reading, and he knew that he had to be the Master. It was in his vault.
Harry snorted, but Malfoy didn’t laugh. “Are you serious? Would that have worked?”
Potter glanced back into the kitchen and replied, “I mean the cutoff was supposed to be a few days ago but if it’s not a big order we can probably squeeze it in.”
He and Draco stared at each other for a moment, not sure what was passing between them, but before he knew what he was doing, Harry rushed back down the hall, pushed at Draco’s chest, and slammed the office door shut. Draco let out a short, excited laugh that made Harry grin so wide he could feel his cheeks stretching and his eyes crinkling. He pulled Draco in, their smiles fading as they leaned closer and closer. His arms wrapped around Draco’s waist as they kissed, their lips slotting together just right and Draco letting out the most deliciously surprised noise.
Slightly cold fingers wrapped around Harry’s wrist, pulling him out of his thoughts. “Hey,” Draco said softly, “I don’t have to tell him, but I know my mother will.”
“I’m assuming that means you’ve never been to said manor?” Harry just nods. “It’s in Surrey.”
Harry had the best time of his life.
“You’re saying you don’t?”
Harry dug the scroll out of his bag and held it out. “I found this in my vault last week, and was wondering how it had come to be there.” He stood up straight as the goblin’s long, spiky fingers reached out for the parchment. His black eyes scanned it, before handing it back with a pointed look at Harry’s forehead.
Draco agreed and before he knew it, he was ushered in, pushed down into a soft chair, and had a nice glass of goblin wine in his hand. Harry sat on the floor between Draco’s knees, sipping his own glass and sighing when he felt Draco’s fingers run through his hair. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes, feeling utterly relaxed.
Harry could tell something was up. He wasn’t sure what was coming, but he hoped it wasn’t as serious as the negative thoughts that had immediately sprung to his head. What if Draco didn’t want to spend time with him anymore? Nothing was really official yet, but Harry could already feel the disappointment that would come from it. But if Draco had intended on not-quite breaking up with him, why would he kiss his cheek and make him breakfast? Or maybe Harry just wasn’t good enough for him. He hadn’t exactly chose the best place for their dates- a pub and a restaurant with terrible service and worse wine. Maybe he was fucking all of this up. It’s not as if he had much dating experience to begin with, just that one disastrous one with Cho in fifth year, a couple with Ginny before they decided they should remain friends, and the one with that Muggle bloke on his construction crew a couple of years ago. All of which weren’t exactly his best, most romantic moments. Yet he could already feel despite their terrible dates that Draco was different than all the rest of them. He just felt different about where they were going.
“It won’t work, Malfoy,” and before Draco had a chance for rebuttal, Potter continued, “Look, I can’t deny I’ve thought about it before when I’d had a few drinks. A
Draco found himself in this place often.
The streamers were up, the harpist had arrived and was setting up in the corner, and Draco was pouring these interesting Muggle candy called “conversation hearts” into different bowls around the room. Before he knew it, Harry Potter was knocking on the threshold.
“Stop yourself from,” Malfoy paused, watching Harry, “what, exactly?”
Potter finished setting up and took a glance around the rest of the room. “It looks nice, Malfoy. You might have that party planning gene after all.”
Harry turned to face Draco. “Come in?”
Fresh drink in hand, Draco wandered over to the group. The stack of glasses was dangerously close to toppling over at this point. No one was touching the table any longer, most likely in fear it would do just that. He stood behind Thomas, off to the side, and cleared his throat. “May I join?”
The bottle that sat next to Harry was slowly drained into each of their glasses until there wasn’t a single drop left. The two men were quite drunk. Draco couldn’t stop rubbing the velvet fabric of the chair he was sitting in and finally leaned over to rest his cheek against it.
“Potter—,” Draco started, sitting up as well.
It wasn’t until days later that Harry went back to the wizarding bank, after staring at the scroll sat on his kitchen table for hours at a time. The blue glow around the parchment, he later found out, was a preservation charm, which led him to believe that it had been written hundreds of years ago.
For now, he settled on lounging on the sofa and watching the muggle telly.
This was not a perfect world. But it was damn near close, in Harry’s opinion.
Hermione, however, has taken no time in moving up within the Ministry. She began as a secretary in the Muggle-Worthy Excuses division of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, and her muggleborn status quickly became a tool for her to use and she became part of the committee within months of starting the job. Less than a year later she was already moving up to the DMLE, acting as a liaison for the Improper Use of Magic office. She spent a year and a half there, before applying for a position as part of Minister Shacklebolt’s support staff. Shacklebolt, knowing how hardworking and intelligent Hermione was, hired her without an interview. She now works closely with Shacklebolt and his team.
Morning came and nearly passed before Harry was prodded awake by a gruesome face. Kreacher was standing over him on his bed, face inches from Harry’s. He merely groaned, too used to the elf’s strange actions.
“Are you having me on?” Harry asked finally, lips turning up into a smile. His serious voice faltered when he said, “because I would like to get into my house, if you’d be so kind as to help me.”
Weasley smirked at him and then returned to the safety of his office, leaving the rest of them to return to their cubicles. Draco walked back to his desk, sighing as he sat down behind the pile of paperwork.
Harry, caught up in the memory of holding Malfoy in a headlock, struggled to come up with a semi-intellectual response. However, speaking to Malfoy without sounding like an idiot had never been his strong suit, as he simply blurted out, “I have a house!”
He placed a hand on the table, experimentally giving it a shake. The tower of glass wobbled dangerously, almost tipping over, and Draco backed away instinctively.
Harry also spent over a year on a muggle construction crew. Being able to build something, even just a wall, from the ground up without the use of magic helped him relax. He built up his strength and made quite a few friends along the way. He didn’t do it much lately. He wanted to focus on Grimmauld Place. He had made quite a few changes already, like getting rid of those horrid house elf heads and that noisy portrait of Sirius’ mother. He had opened a new vault in Gringott’s for the Black family heirlooms that he found. He didn’t necessarily want to keep them, but the thought of the latest generation of Blacks coming at him for destroying their family history made him shiver.
“Of course you focus on that part,” Potter sighed, swirling the ice around in his glass fast enough that if it weren’t for the pounding bass of club music, Draco would probably hear it clinking against the glass.
Harry, whose collection of Neville’s salves and solutions was steadily growing too big for the medicine cabinet in his loo, wondered if he’d be able to grab some before the crowd outside bought out the entire store. Before he could even finish the thought, however, Neville had set down his quill and smirked at him from across the desk. He gestured shortly to the corner of his desk.
“Of course I have,” Draco argued, knocking Potter’s finger out of the way.
“How would you even know that? We’ve barely spoken since the war. Hell, we never spoke then, only fought. Who are you to say whether I’ve changed?”
“Gather ‘round, fucks,” Head Auror Weasley’s clunking boots announced him before he even spoke. “To increase department morale, or whatever, we’re supposed to have a few office parties throughout the year. As you know, Valentine’s Day is in three days and one of you is in charge of planning the entire party. Now, pick a straw.” He held out his hand which was wrapped around a bundle of straws.
He’d not really been interested in becoming an Auror after their eighth year at Hogwarts, but that didn’t mean he would let something like this slide. He was determined to discover what happened in what he thought would be one of the safest places someone could be, full of long lost memories and decades worth of protective magic. Though, logically, he conceded, some of those spells most likely disappeared when their owners died, much like Dumbledore’s had released him when he’d fallen from the Astronomy Tower. Still, curiosity got the best of him and he was determined to know.
“Says the man who had twice the pints as me and even stole my last one,” Draco quipped, turning his hand so they could press their palms together. They strode out of the Leaky, leaving behind a few galleons for the barkeep, and towards Gringott’s. Draco casually let go of Harry’s hand, only to have the green-eyed wizard link arms with him.
Draco woke up to sunlight seeping in around his curtains. He forced himself to peel his eyelids apart, then immediately shut them again. He tried to reach for his wand for the time, but his head swam. He settled back onto the pillow, letting out a pathetic whimper.
Draco wasn’t ashamed of his list, no. In fact, he was quite proud of the collection he’d acquired, even the ones collected by mistake. Drunken mistakes. The first Gryffindor had been Oliver Wood, who’d had an affinity towards Slytherins ever since he and Marcus Flint had been rivalling Quidditch captains. That one hadn’t been planned or expected, and yet Draco would soon rely on fucking Gryffindors, even going so far as to plan his days around it. Wood had said something during their night together which resonated with Draco. In the throes of orgasm, Wood had whispered breathlessly into Draco’s ear, “Doesn’t it feel fucking fantastic when Gryffindors and Slytherins shag? Almost feels like something we shouldn’t have, but gods, I can’t get enough.” And then Wood had proceeded to ride Draco so hard he felt like he’d have bruises on his hips for weeks.
Settling down in a chair at his dining table, an egg toastie and cup of tea set to his left, Draco reminisced on the past twenty-four hours. Longbottom had left in an embarrassed rush at around three in the morning, barely muttering a goodbye before the door clicked shut behind him. He remembered Longbottom absolutely sloshed at the pub the night before, dancing with anyone and everyone he could get his hands on. He was a terrible dancer but somehow Draco hadn’t minded while several glasses of Ogden’s finest in. After downing the last of his current glass, Draco had sidled up to the Gryffindor on the dance floor and snaked his hands around the front of Longbottom’s waist, grabbing hold of his hips as he ground back against Draco to the beat of the music. Draco hadn’t been expecting anything to happen with the man. Figured once Longbottom turned around and realised who was touching him, feeling him, he’d break off and run straight out the door.
The party was in full swing and his coworkers, even the Head Auror, seemed to be having a good time. Draco was thankful this didn’t end up like that secret birthday party he tried to throw for Pansy a few years back. This one actually seemed to be going over well and he was pleasantly surprised. The harpist in the corner was playing beautiful music that really set the friendly mood, and Draco didn’t think he’d talked to this many of his coworkers in one day before this. He did hope that the success of this party didn’t automatically qualify him to plan the rest of them, however.
Draco scoffed, pressing a light kiss to Harry’s forehead and backing away. “Don’t lose your position on my behalf,” he teased.
It was Ron’s first full year of being an Auror. For a couple of years after they’d finished Hogwarts, Harry had helped Ron train for the exam. Ron had been disappointed to learn that being an Auror-in-training was dramatically different than being a full Auror. He was only allowed to observe cases most of the time, which seemed to frustrate him more than anything. Now he can actually lead a case, investigate, and even weigh in on other people’s cases. Harry noticed he’s definitely a lot happier now.
Neville’s shop was crowded when he got there, so much so that he caught several elbows to the ribs on his way from the door to the counter, blueprints held up high in the air, over everyone’s heads so that they didn’t get damaged. He could feel his mood start to change for the worse as people either whispered to their friends about being in the presence of Harry Potter or shot him angry glares over his lack of respect for the line.
“Er,” Draco began, trying to mentally count how much food he would need. “I’m in charge of the office party, so I think that’s 26 aurors and some have partners. Plus the head auror and Unspeakable Granger. Oh, er, I know they’re your friends so would you like to attend the part as well?”
He wasn’t sure how long he should stay, or whether he should try the gate again before he left. He knew it wasn’t an exact science, that this was the first time he’d spent more than ten minutes here and this time he wasn’t angry or frustrated at all. For all he knew, the gate may choose to open by itself when it trusts him.
The burrow was as crowded as ever when he arrived, with the usual crowd of kids running in and out of the house and a pickup quidditch game going on in the backyard. Harry opened the door as Victoire, followed by what looked like a harried Fleur. She stopped to give him a kiss on each of his cheeks and a hug before running after her daughter.
Merlin, did Potter look good that way. Lying underneath Draco, tossing his head from side to side and gasping through his orgasm.
Draco almost wanted to argue that it wasn’t his fault he was so late. That he drew the short straw and was forced to throw this party. However, he honestly felt incredibly glad it was all working out. The arrangements all looked fantastic and soon his coworkers would be arriving.
Someone took the bottle of wine he was carrying, but he didn’t remember who as he was greeted by what seemed like every Weasley in existence. He finally made it to the living room and collapsed beside Ron, who seemed to have broken into the wine early. As the night went on, the whole family talked, ate, laughed, drink, and played numerous games, but mostly drank. It seemed like every room in the house was going to be used as a bedroom tonight, as no one was in any shape to apparate home.
It had been quite a while since Harry had felt so… energized. He felt like he could handle five of the most intense quidditch practices in a row or start a charity or reinvent the wheel. Something big and magical and amazing. Part of him felt like he was starting a whole new life. Something about kissing Draco, having genuine fun with Draco, instead of the low-blow insults they had exchanged in what now felt like their previous lives. Something about that made Harry unconditionally cheerful.
The grass on either side of the path perked up near his foot, suddenly changing from the sandy brown, dead color to the lushest, most vivid green Harry had seen in his life. Each step resulted in more color, more plants that recovered from more than twenty years of absence. The trees immediately began to bloom as he passed them, pedals sprinkling down like the gentlest snowfall. The whole experience was, ironically, magical. Harry could hear birds chirping across the yard, a breeze rustling through the leaves of the- of
The response was instantaneous. Potter’s fingers tightened themselves, clutching onto Draco’s shirt and no doubt wrinkling the fabric. His head tilted, slotting their lips together just right so that his tongue met Draco’s when their lips parted. Draco’s hand drifted lower, grabbing hold of Potter’s arse and turning them, so Potter was now the one pressed against the wall. And then they were off, Potter’s nails scratching against Draco’s skin in his effort to unbutton the fabric. Draco’s fingers followed the waistband of Potter’s jeans until he reached the button, undoing it with a flick of his wrist. His hand drifted lower, pressing his palm against Potter’s groin through his pants.
“You invited me,” was Malfoy’s reply, “and I wanted to come.” On a whim, Harry grabbed his wrist and pulled him behind a tree.
It was at this point Draco realised they still hadn’t spoken, so he set his hands on the table in a businesslike manner and cleared his throat. Potter’s eyes flicked up to meet his own and he slowly set down the menu.
“On Monday,” Harry replied as he stepped onto the path and continued further onto the property, Ron following in awe. Halfway to the mansion, Harry veered to the left and pushed through a line of trees to find an open meadow.
Harry stiffened. In the month or so they’d been seeing each other, Draco hadn’t mentioned his father once, and Harry hadn’t asked. For the past couple of years, Harry had been making a valiant effort to let go, to forgive what happened during the war. But Lucius Malfoy was one area in which he was struggling. It wasn’t as though Harry was scared of the man, but-- hell, Harry was scared of him. Lucius had tried to kill him on several occasions to please Voldemort, or even please his son at the time, and maybe Harry hadn’t quite gotten over it. Especially now that Harry was certain he and Lucius would cross paths again at one point or another. He was a little apprehensive.
Harry sighed and opened his mouth to speak, but Neville beat him to it. “I know, I know. You ‘didn’t ask for it’. What did you expect, Harry? For people to forget about Voldemort after all their friends and family were buried? Everyone is grateful for you, and you’ve already paid them back a thousand times over by defeating him and being alive.”
Harry shook his head. “Not bad,” he breathed, “just long.” The blond nodded in understanding. They sat in silence for a long while, Draco’s attention turning back to his book and his fingers still running through Harry’s hair. Harry’s eyes had closed and Draco suspected he’d be falling into a light sleep any second. Draco turned a page.
“So how’d you open it?”
“Care for another?” Draco offered, standing for just long enough to switch to the empty barstool next to him, leaving an empty seat right where Potter was standing.
“I was quite sloshed,” he admitted, finally making eye contact with his friend.
Draco jumped when something fell in his lap. He marked the place in his book with his fingers and, looking down to see Harry’s head resting on his thighs, let his free hand find the tangle of black hair. Harry’s lips curled into a satisfied smile and he sighed in relief.
Harry heard Draco scoff next to him, and when he looked, Draco only said, “Of course the door is red. Bloody Gryffindors.” Harry laughed and gave the blonde a friendly shove, catching him when he almost fell backwards down the front steps. Harry’s hand slid to the knob, fingers circling the brass and feeling the shape of it in his palm.
“’His arms went around her,’” Harry started, letting his free arm curl around the nape of Draco’s neck, “’wrapping her in his vast strength, holding her against the hardness of his body.’” He jerked Draco forward, pressing their chests together. “Mm, it’s a little bit unrealistic. You might have to imagine I have the eight-pack.”
Potter shoved him again. “I
Harry had tried to tame himself, but thoughts about Malfoy infiltrated his every day. He eventually gave in, letting himself think, imagine, what it would be like to be friends with Malfoy. Maybe even something more.
Harry nodded and stood, delicately placing his chair back in the corner where he dragged it from. “Thanks.”
“What are you, going off to war now?” Harry asked jokingly, and then laughed at his own jest. If there were two people in the entire wizarding world that could joke about war, it would be them. Draco broke out in a grin, staring down at the shorter man.
“Yes, sir?”
The living room furniture was replaced with cushy sofas and recliner chairs. The wood from the old kitchen table was repurposed into frames of pictures of Harry, Hermione, and Ron, the original Order of the Phoenix, the Weasley family, and a picture of his parents., all of which were hanging in the living room. Harry had wanted to keep the table, but it was falling apart. He replaced all the showers, toilets, and doors (except for Sirius’ and Regulus’). Harry made sure Kreacher was permanently placed in the Hogwarts kitchens while he did these renovations, otherwise he was sure the old elf would die on the spot.
saying that, you fuck.” Draco’s back hit the corner of the wall, sending a slight pain shooting down his spine. Potter walked closer, one of his hands twitching down by his side. Draco wasn’t sure if Potter wanted to punch him or pull out his wand and send a hex Draco’s way. “Any and all attraction I felt for you is long gone, Malfoy,” Potter stated almost formally, like it was a speech he’d recited to himself while lying awake in bed every night. But despite Potter’s declaration, he was still inching closer.
Anyway, he needed focus on the task at hand — shagging Neville Longbottom.
Draco really didn’t want to continue this conversation, not with the direction it was heading. He pursed his lips, trying to think of something to say, anything. He wondered if this was worth it, worth the pain of thinking about his past, his mistakes. Every other Gryffindor he’d been with had pointedly ignored having this conversation, avoiding addressing Draco’s role in their suffering.
foy, let me introduce you.”
Bippy vanished on the spot, the resounding crack ringing in Harry’s ears.
the world to bow down. He wanted Draco to notice him, like him, go out with him.
“Sitting? Talking? Inquiring about your—”
“I’ll skive off.”
thanks for all the comments and kudos! i really appreciate it and hope you guys like this update.
Leaning forward and ghosting his breath over Draco’s cheek, Harry read, “’Each strike of his breath on her cheek was a shock of heat.’” Harry’s nose traced Draco’s stubble-covered jaw as he read over the blond’s shoulder.
“Hey, Harry!” someone shouted, who must have used a
“Come back to my place and we can—” Draco began, but Potter’s sharp bark of incredulous laughter interrupted him.
Draco kept a list — several, in fact — in a little blue pocketbook that kept him company throughout his days as a… Well, he didn’t exactly have a job. He’d inherited the Malfoy fortune, after all. Manor, peacocks, history, and all. The house-elves took care of that, while Draco lived in a penthouse flat in downtown London amongst the Muggles.
Draco laughed, hands finding their way to Harry’s hips. “You’ll have to imagine that I have size double-D breasts. I guess we’ll both make sacrifices.”
Harry shook his head, watching a cloud that faintly reminded him of the Hufflepuff mascot, the badger, roll across the sky. It’s head was slowly morphing into something different, and after a moment it had taken on a completely different shape.
“Lunch, yes,” Ron agreed, following Harry down the staircase and into the kitchen. They quickly packed up a basket full of sandwiches and pumpkin juice and proceeded to side-along apparate to the gate of the manor.
“The sand–”
Before he made contact, Potter shot up. “I have to go,” he said simply, without emotion. He stood up and found his pants, tugging them on without grace.
The question caught him by surprise. “I… I guess I forgot about that, to be honest.” He chuckled softly, realizing that he hadn’t thought about the manor since he’d left it the previous day. The past 24 hours had been unstoppable, meeting with Neville and his date with Draco and then lunch earlier that day had made him completely forget about what he’d been obsessing over for the last month. “I’ve been a bit distracted.”
. What more do you want me to say?”
“If you buy me another drink, I’ll hex you,” Potter said, almost passively, as he grabbed his full glass and walked across the bar, away from Draco.
Ron gave him a wary look, then patted Harry’s shoulder a couple of times before resting his hand there briefly. “You don’t have to stay, mate.”
“I could have figured it out on my own,” she quickly defended, and then softly, “but yes Ron told me.”
A house elf appeared in front of them with a loud crack, and then squealed at the sight of him. “Master Harry Potter, sir!” She curtsied low, her floral printed tea cloth dragging across the floor. “I is Bippy, Master’s elf! I is yours to command!”
“It’s no use,” Harry had said, “I’ll need to use the muggle wash for it.”
If this had happened several years ago, Harry would be too weirded out to stick around in the dark room. He would have stoked the fire, illuminated every candle, just to feel some semblance of life in the house. Now he could honestly say he felt comfortable in every room. He wasn’t being stared at by the heads of Black family house elves or creepy portraits of distant relatives, and Kreacher didn’t roam the halls as much, scaring Harry when he appeared in a room with a loud Crack! It was better now.
Malfoy’s smile faded and he eyed Harry for a few moments, a thoughtful expression on his face. Suddenly he was up out of his chair and pulling a couple books off the shelf, flipping through them quickly. Harry briefly admired the plains of Malfoy’s back. The wide set shoulders cascading down into his small waist where it curved out slightly. Malfoy began mumbling to himself, which knocked some sense into Harry, but all he could decipher was the word “abandonment”.
As they packed up to leave, Harry took another long glance at the house in the distance and whispered, “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
“I’m telling you!” Ron laughed, “He had to have been about one hundred and fifty! And he tried to run away using one of those muggle razor blades!”
Hermione stepped forward. “Could you make us some tea, Bippy?”
“Nothing,” came the very unhelpful reply.
“You have to pay the tab,” Thomas said offhandedly, standing behind Draco and bouncing excitedly. “No magic, go on!”
The restaurant was packed, to put it simply. Harry had put their name in a half hour ago and they were still waiting for their table, shoulders pressed together as they squeezed into the only free space on the bench. Draco was becoming increasingly more impatient as he crossed his legs and sighed several times in the span of two minutes. Harry was rather relaxed, but he was steadily getting more worried that his date would end up bursting at the seams before they were even sat.
What was that look? Salazar, but he could stare at it all day.
“I reckon so,” Thomas answered, the sound muffled through his fingers.
Ron and Hermione both approached him. “Mum’s making a roast for dinner. Says if you want to come you’re welcome to.” Hermione shot a meaningful glance over Harry’s shoulder, and he turned around to see Malfoy still there, but looking more impatient and uncomfortable by the moment.
Having visited his vault what seemed like a million times, Harry began shoveling coins into his small, drawstring bag without even a second look. It was only when a large pyramid of coins toppled over that he spotted it among the glittering gold. A piece of parchment was coiled up among the pieces, a slight blue glow surrounding it. Harry reached for it and the parchment emitted an orange spark once his fingers connected. He slowly unraveled the scroll, eyes flitting across the page as the words registered in his brain.
“Nev’s cool,” Harry insisted as they reached the steps to Gringott’s. “I’ll let him know.”
The pub was packed the next time Draco found himself there, a local Wizard band Draco vaguely recognised gracing the stage and filling the pub with music that automatically made one nod their head to the beat.
When the front door slammed closed, creating a bitter end to Draco’s train of thought, he stood up. It hadn’t even reached eleven o’clock yet and Draco was unsure of what to do with himself. He wandered around, as if lost in his own apartment. He made tea, but left it to cool in his cup for too long and it grew cold.
“Alright Harry?” Barnaby, the keeper, questioned.
It’s fine, he told himself. He could do this. He was skilled at balancing on a broom, he’d handled priceless vintage vases before. He could balance a measly glass, no problem.
When he finished the tea, he repacked the basket and stood. He considered tugging on the gate once, just to check, but instead decided to merely rest his forehead against it for a moment before apparating away.
If Malfoy had been annoyed by his frequent visits, he never expressed it. In fact, he was more than pleasant every single time Harry was in his office. Harry never could have fathomed that he would actually enjoy spending time with Draco Malfoy, especially after everything they had gone through.  After all the times they had fought, dueled, thrown insults at each other, how could Harry so desperately want to reach out and touch that blonde hair, run his fingers along the curve of Malfoy’s jaw, and maybe even interlock their fingers together.
Hermione sighed and plopped on the sofa by Harry’s feet. “More than ever. And I don’t know why considering I’m less than qualified for it.”
Draco was a collector of sorts. His specialities included vintage crystal vases, keys to unknown locks, trips abroad, and, most recently, Gryffindor men. He’d had most of them in his bed, the queer ones anyway, but there was one he hadn’t quite gathered the courage to pursue yet. And, unsurprisingly, it happened to be the lead Gryffindor: Harry Potter.
The book dropped off the back of the couch and Harry’s newly freed hand grasped the back of Draco’s shirt, holding on tightly.
Gringotts was nearly empty by the time Draco arrived. It was late on a Friday afternoon, the bank closing in a mere ten minutes or so. Most of the employees were gone, leaving a few scattered across the lobby, conducting last-minute business before the week was out. Draco was escorted down to his vaults, where he filled a few pouches with Galleons.
“Budge over,” she commanded in a whisper. He rolled his body towards the wall to make room for her and she laid beside him. They faced each other, sharing the pillow. “When are you going to tell him?”
“If I’m honest, I don’t remember that night much. And it’s just talking, I swear,” Draco insisted. “We can do it in public if you like. Hell, we could Apparate to the middle of Auror headquarters right now so if I try to hex you they’ll arrest me. I don’t really care where it happens, just that it does.”
“Look, do you want to go somewhere and talk?”
Draco watched Potter through half-lidded eyes, leaned back against the wall and waited as the Gryffindor approached. Potter’s hands came up, like they wanted to shove at Draco again, but landed on his chest instead. His fingers felt hot through Draco’s thin button-down and Draco thought if they were left any longer he’d burn. Draco could almost guess what was running through Potter’s mind. He still wanted Draco. He wasn’t happy about it, but those feelings were still there.
He absently ran a finger across his lips as he made his way out of Gringott’s and into the flood of people in Diagon Alley.
“Er...yeah, I suppose,” Harry replied, pushing himself off the couch. “I’ll go change.” He shuffled to the landing and heard Hermione vanish the nearly empty bag of chips.
“Fuck,” someone groaned, stirring Draco from his half-sleep. “Fuck, is that Malfoy? Bugger…” they said and Draco felt movement on the other side of his bed. He pulled the covers down to reveal his face, hoping he didn’t look as unattractive as he felt in his current state.
“You’re going to have tea at your manor?” Harry nodded and finished packing his basket. “It’s an interesting idea. Mind if I join?”
seen together.
Potter was calm, taking slow sips of his whisky, licking his lips every time he set the glass back down. Draco couldn’t help but reflexively do the same. He knew at the back of his mind that the silence was dragging on too long, that Potter would probably scurry away if Draco didn’t say something soon, explain himself, or even make a move.
Potter had been writing furiously on a notebook behind the counter, and when Draco leaned forward to catch a glimpse, he slickly covered his writing. “Ron did mention it, so I may stop by for a bit.”
“And for Merlin’s sake wear some quieter shoes next time.” Malfoy’s tone was almost… teasing. Harry’s smile grew as he walked down the corridor.
When he arrived back at Grimmauld Place, he barely had time to set down the basket and grab the blueprints he made for Neville before he was apparating again, this time to Diagon Alley. Friday lunchtime seemed to be coming to an end, as the heels of businesswomen clacked down the paved alley hurriedly, followed by the thick steps from their male counterparts. Harry headed in the opposite direction of the flow of people, further in rather than out. He checked his watch again as he was passing Gringott’s. Sometimes apparating took longer than expected and he couldn’t be late. Well, he probably could, but he thought that rather rude.
Draco, having watched this scene dozens of times before, suggested, “Living room? I don’t know. Look, Potter, you don’t have to rush—”
Pulling a magnifying glass out of a drawer, Malfoy took a closer look at the magical parchment.
“I’ve been meaning to drop by, anyway, because with the new shop opening, I can’t exactly run both of them myself. I was hoping you’d help…?” Neville trailed off, a hopeful hum at the end of his proposal.
“Have you been inside yet?”
On Monday, Harry had quidditch practice. It was hot outside, the sweltering sun beating down on him during the whole practice. He knew he smelled terrible, could barely stand the scent of his quidditch uniform by the end of it. Sweat dripped freely down his face as he bounded off the pitch, robes caked in mud.
“No thanks,” Draco grunted, “I’ve got to go to Diagon to get these party supplies, I guess.” Charles let out a short laugh and nodded before leaving Draco behind. He supposed he better get it all over with and grabbed his traveling cloak.
The group chatted away happily over wine glasses that drained and refilled over the course of the meal. Harry always felt an ache in his heart when he came back to this house with his family. They were his family. They would never
“Merlin, you really are an arsehole,” Potter sighed.
“Tell me,” Harry said as he stepped closer to where Draco was sitting.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco said politely. “I was hoping I’m not too late to place an order for Valentine’s day.”
Wordlessly, Harry wandered out the French doors to the backyard. It was rather easy picking Teddy out of the crowd of pre-schoolers and parents. Harry silently wished Teddy’s muggle friends weren’t around, so that his hair could flash every color imaginable. He always loved seeing his godson so happy and excited.
“Of course not,” Draco lied immediately, easily.
Thomas… Draco set his drink down behind him and reached into his breast pocket, finding his little blue book where it often was. He flipped to the back, eyes scanning the list of names. Thomas wasn’t on it, but Draco had heard rumours at Hogwarts of Thomas hooking up with girls and boys alike. Most famously with the youngest Weasley before Potter supposedly stole her away. Draco wasn’t opposed to trying; Thomas was mildly attractive. Not what Draco would typically choose for himself, but, hell, he’d try anything for one night. Thomas had grown at least another few inches since the war, making him loom over a majority of his friends, only rivalling perhaps Potter’s Weasley, who’d long surpassed his peers in height.
After nearly a half hour, Draco set two plates on the table, one in front of Harry. Harry responded by laying down his book and smiling gratefully up at Draco. “Thanks.” Draco stood for a moment longer, staring at Harry’s face and seemed to be considering something. He finally leaned down and pressed a light kiss to Harry’s cheek before sitting in front of his own plate.
“’Seduce Me At Sunrise’? Wow. When did you start reading cheesy romance novels?” Harry teased, reaching a hand up to prod Draco in the chest.
The blonde didn’t answer, just took Harry’s hand in his again and led him down the path. Eventually, they turned a corner and Harry immediately recognized where they were. On either side was number eleven and thirteen, but Harry waved his wand and number 12 Grimmauld Place appeared before them.
“I’m great,” Draco responded. Silence followed. Stupid, awkwardly silent silence. Draco was generally pretty good at avoiding this kind of thing, but Potter was different from all the others. Draco couldn’t pinpoint what it was, and resigned himself to watching the man next to him in search for answers.
Harry was so proud of his friends that he sometimes wished he’d joined the workforce with them. He knew, however, that being an Auror was not a good fit for him. He still had nightmares from the war, and what the healer described as PTSD. He isn’t a deadbeat by any means, at least that’s what he thinks. He spends his time with his friends and his godson, often taking Teddy out to experience Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, since Andromeda did not like to be seen in public. His favorite place to take Teddy was to quidditch matches, where Ron often tagged along if he could get away.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered. He had to make a decision. Either he could fly to the ground and pause the game, or he could keep playing with only one arm.
“I can’t have you two sacrificing your jobs for me.” He shrugged, pulling at a loose thread at the bottom of his jeans. “Besides,” he started, jokingly, “who else will take care of me when I’m old and crusty?”
Hermione flooed in hours later while Harry was being a self-proclaimed lazy slob. All he wore were joggers and an oversized t-shirt that was either one of Dudley’s hand-me-downs or one he’d stretched out so much it could now fit two of him. He was lounging on the couch, one leg swung over the back and the other foot firmly on the floor. A bag of crisps sat on the floor next to his hanging arm, nearly empty.
“I pay for stuff!” Harry defended.
Draco sighed again next to him, tapping his fingers on his knee rhythmically. Harry looked at the blonde. His hair was voluminous on top of his head, swooped back from his forehead but not caked down with gel like it was at Hogwarts. His lips turned downward slightly and his eyebrows raised every time the host gave them an updated wait time. He groaned in frustration a couple of times, but mostly it was sighs and body language that told Harry he was sick of waiting. He looked beautiful despite his mood and every time Harry saw his fingers move he wanted to grab that hand and hold it. He agonized over that for a few moments before mentally saying “Bugger it”, reached over, and pulled Draco’s hand into his own.
Harry scoffed and pulled the ice pack off his shoulder. He thanked the healer and apologized for his bad language while she was fixing his arm. “I don’t think I care much about winning,” he started as the two walked out of the pitch and towards the apparition spot nearby, “I like to play and I like being on a broom in the air. And it’s the minors anyway, so a lot of us are here just for fun.”
. Luckily he still maintained some form of self control and quickly came up with an alternative response.
The world at two o’clock in the morning was riddled with silent beauty. The rolling fog under the yellow street lamps, endless wonder when looking up into the darkness of the black sky. The feeling of contortion, though everything was in place. A body, heavy and hot underneath him, bringing him back to reality.
Harry’s smile didn’t falter. “Pretty fitting for us, I’d argue. Draco, I don’t really care how the date went or what happened during it. I got to hold your hand and make you smile and that’s all that matters to me.”
“Don’t fall asleep on me next time,” she warned. “When are you going to tell Malfoy that you’re in love with him?”
" Look I can owl for Hermionie to come by tomorrow if that'll make you feel better. Headmistress Mcgonall Hired me and trusts me. And while I know right now it seams crazy, we're engaged to be married Harry."
----------------
On one side he felt a leathery almost bat like appendege and on the other what could only be feathers. Are those wings? The base of his spine tingled and Harry was afraid to find any other strange changes. This had to be a mistake, some curse or hex that hadn't activated till now.
She and Ron had often planned to kidnap Harry from them but were always convinced by Harry that he was safest where he was, Dumbledore had told him so, or it wasn't really that bad, and they backed down.
If he wasn't so useless he might have gotten to the cup before diggory or gotten them out of the graveyard. He should have run to the cup as soon as he realized where he was. He barely got out of there himself, but he did get away. Maybe if he had fought back from the start.
" Well. That's one good thing then."  They stared at her with worried looks.
" I...... Will it hurt anyone who touches it?" Harry asked.
" I heard, you lead them down right after the announcement because they wanted a challenge . and the troll would still be wandering the castle today if you hadn't ". A third year hufflepuff came up excitedly.
" What's all this? " Draco crouched as he asked Harry who was sporting an adorable wizard's hat and a small excited smile. He just held up the books reverently and beamed happily glowing pink and orange as if to say, 'its books isn't it wonderful!'
“No, I mean how did we end up..” Harry trailed off, when he saw Draco blush fiercely.
With love,
" Dumbledore." Severus replied.
" Where's your loyalty to Harry, Neville!"
" Of course" Harry to the surprise of everyone except myself and welling walked around to my mother and hugged her. She quickly and gently hugged him back. He pulled away and smiled at her.
" The both of them were too stubborn and prideful to apologize until it was too late. Lilly was my friend too, and I know they must have missed each other terribly. And I didn't even bother to look into how her son was doing." He looked sadly at Draco. " I'm sorry son." Draco, for his part, swallowed, and resumed his pacing. The glitter thankfully had mostly vanished.
Harry rushed forward as well and put himself between the shaking potion and miss Robinson. Draco only managed to put out the fire before it exploded. Harry pushed Draco out of the way and was covered in the red potion. Draco quickly
" Maybe Hermione would have ideas. We should go to see them the feast should still be on" Neville said while Draco was still trying to figure out what a wengeral was.
Creature Inheritance, that would explain some things. Harry thought. But what kind of creature had two different kinds of wings and a bushy tail. He looked at the letter and  decided he didn't have the time for vaults right now
We headed down to breakfast after assuring Harry that the toys would be there when he got back. He held my and with one and his book with the other.
"The end of fifth year James potter confessed his love for Lilly. She didn't believe him at first of course, but he got into her heart, nearly romanced her to death, especially over the summer. Your mother could never forgive James for the things he and his friends had done to the Slytherins, particularly to her and Severus for being friends with Lilly. They had been particularly cruel more times than she could forgive. They fought after the entrance feast, Lilly was always headstrong and Narcissa couldn't figure out how she had fallen for the hotheaded griffondor. Soon Severus joined her and they were shouting so loud you could hear it all over the castle. They wanted her to reject his advances and she refused. The whole school took sides so that even if they had wanted to reconcile the other students, myself included wouldn't let them. Years after they graduated Severus and Lilly made up, though he still hated James and questioned most of his decisions. "
" She didn't send you to the hospital wing first? you just fought a troll?", Evan a Ravenclaw who had come in halfway through asked.
"yes!, pay up James." James for his part dramatically groaned and pulled out a handful of candy and sickles.
" I'd forgotten how small you were in school. " Draco smiled, when Harry glared at him again.
" Most ancient and noble houses are older and usually richer, than an ancient and noble house. But I think there are several more houses you will inherit due to vengeance clauses in the older houses. Many prestigious and worthy houses were wiped out by... hmf well, you- know-who." He pulled on his tie to loosen it and straitened.
" I'm Draco, " he said. Harry looked up and moved towards him. Then with out any warning dashed up to Draco and hugged him. The little four year old had he face in draco's neck.
" I didn't say anything, I didn't tell them anything. I didn't" Harry whispered frantically as though he were trying to convince himself.
" Thank you for the book." He said and smiles at her. My mother grinned at him.
Harry was busy playing with draco's long blond hair so he didn't notice when the adults left the room.
Harry was holding his new book bag close at the griffendor table. He eat there for a few minutes before Ron asked, " what's wrong mate?" Harry looked at Ron suspiciously for a moment, until Neville prompted him too, as Luna came over and sat with them.
"Severus Snape. Severus and Lilly met just before their first year of Hogwarts, they met your mother, Draco, on the train. Even their houses couldn't keep them apart they were always cooking up some potion or pranking the marauders in retaliation."
" familiar transport laws, cross-reference for the american and the British ministries and bylaws, treaties, and negotiations for Romania, Greenland, Canada, Nepal, India, Afghanistan and Morocco. and finally, familiar rights relating to endangered and protected magical species and possible bans on dragon species in a school setting even if they are a familiar, with examples."
" so, we've sent our replies. now, tell me what you said! Did you accept!" I dragged Draco to the couch
" He's inverting, his magic is reverting his body back to when he last felt completely safe. Normally I would count this as a good thing, but with everything thats happened Potter mayl a few years. " Just as madam pomfrey said Harry began changing while his creature featured stayed we all watched as Harry grew shorter and worryingly thinner. By the time Snape had entered he looked as he did in our first year at Hogwarts.
Of all the hurdles that Harry thought he would have to overcome to become an Auror, he felt that not having his NEWTs would be the one that ultimately tripped him up.
“How can you stand it?” she asks miserably. “I can’t wait until none of this bothers me anymore.”
The small circle chatting is quiet for a second before it erupts into laughter. Cho Chang cackles as she brings her drink to her lips. Draco finds this, somehow, the most challenging. When they’re not discussing pain, or trauma, or anything terrible, but instead the day to day life of a person on the run. They have these funny stories, and they’re okay to tell because, ultimately, they were on the right side.
Draco nods and leans across the bar when Harry meets him halfway for a kiss. "I'll see you later then."
Draco doesn’t wait to see what threat Harry can come up with. Instead, he slicks himself up and pushes in gently. True to form, Harry lets out this little shocked gasp when he’s all the way inside. It’s so wet, and hot, and goddamn tight that Draco quietly loses his mind for a moment.
Potter looks up as Draco waves wand, “so you’re done then?”
“Do you want to have another drink at my place?” Draco offers before he can think it through fully.
Draco jumps, “what are you doing here, Buffy?”
“Will you fuck me?” Harry asks, straightforward and brave.
Draco likes fucking Potter; why can’t that be enough for the stupid man? Draco loves the way his brown skin gleams in the moonlight and the way his bright eyes glow without his glasses. Draco especially loves that little, almost surprised, gasp he lets out when Draco first pushes inside. It’s a shockingly vulnerable, almost innocent sound, and it drives Draco absolutely mad.
"Actually," Harry began, offering something he seldom does. "Why don't I cook for you?"
Harry ignores him, "so you'll come."
He hears Andromeda's quiet, "oh no."
Almost no one knew the reason why he had quit the Aurors. Well, technically speaking, he had been fired, but since he walked out of the meeting, they had recorded it as leaving.
“Well,” Draco says fairly, “the Knight Bus doesn’t take three hours.”
She gives a wet laugh.
“Are you okay?” Draco says again, “was this a bad idea? I can pack everyone off--”
“I suppose I wouldn’t say no to a birthday shag,” Harry says with a leer that makes Draco chuckle.
“You didn’t have to see your body,” is all Draco says, simply. “Are you even planning on going this year?”
Harry makes a distressed noise and twists himself back so his head is resting on Draco’s chest again instead of looking at him. “She… Well, as you may remember, I fucked off for a year on the run… And, well, she and Neville ended up spending a lot of time working together, helping each other, bonding. By the time I came back, she was in love with him… It was pretty heartbreaking, to be honest with you.”
“I’ll get the special,” Potter replies.
Draco laughs with the others and says something about getting another drink. He hadn’t seen Potter in at least a half-hour when he disappeared with Granger to the kitchen. He crept up and heard Potter’s unmistakable voice.
Of course, he can’t sleep. The stupid idiot Potter, with his big, dumb, hurt eyes and the fact that he thinks that Draco doesn’t
Draco offers his hand to pull Harry from the ground. “Busy tonight?”
"I just," Draco says, "you're my priority. I want to take care of you… I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love you."
Harry can't quite help the glowing gooey feeling that enters his limbs, so he flings himself without much dignity into Draco's arms. He'll be embarrassed about it tomorrow, but now, still groggy from his nap, he feels quite overcome.
“We should get drinks,” Potter shouts, looking for all the world like he wasn’t completely sure he meant to do that.
“When I was talking to Hermione?” Harry asks, surprised. “When was I…? Oh! Oh.” His voice turns from confusion to embarrassment in record time, Draco can feel Harry’s cheeks heat up under his palm.
"My cousin?" Teddy says, his sweet face looking sharply away from Harry to the new person in their midst. Draco is standing awkwardly stiff, his back straight with his hand stretched out.
Draco says nothing but looks pointedly at Harry before turning to another patron at the bar. Harry likes hanging out at
Draco smiles and pulls away gently with a tender kiss on Harry's head. "Yeah, stay. And if you want… Stay until I come back. I'd like to go to sleep with you in my bed tonight."
when he spoke to Draco about him. "Oh, sorry, Teddy is my godson. I'd like you to meet him. I mean, you're family."
It was merely how he wanted to get to know Harry separate from all of his drama. Harry wasn't exactly, precisely sure who he was without it, but he presumed someone existed, and that was a person Draco seemed interested in getting to know.
“You’re so beautiful,” Draco says, kissing above Harry’s heart. His hands are still gently running up and down Harry’s flank. He kisses a circular burn shaped scar in the center of his chest. “And brave.”
It’s that thought that forces Draco to a halt.
Harry looks nervous, but nods.
And outside the large windows, a sea of geraniums danced in the wind.
Draco takes a deep breath, slides his eyes to the corner of the ballroom where his supervisor is watching him like a hawk, and says, “Hello Mr. Potter. What can I get you this evening?”
Harry went to help Draco undress when he shook his head, "no. I want to take care of you."
Draco can’t help the laugh that bubbles out of him, which causes Potter to stare at him like he’s never seen Draco smile. Which, is unfortunately, possibly true.
Harry looks at him, very quiet and very serious. Before he leans over, slowly, giving Draco plenty of time to stop him- and that is when Draco realizes Harry Potter is about to kiss him.
Draco reaches forward, and Harry finally drops his arms and lets Draco pull him into a tender kiss. Draco intends for it to be passionate and sexy, but the second he’s cradling Harry’s skull, gently cupping it with his hand, he can’t help but soften.
Draco speeds down the hall as he hears them walk out of the kitchen towards the bathroom in the back of Potter’s apartment. It’s a penthouse with large floor to ceiling windows in the center of the city, London’s glittering lights laid out below Potter. Draco, personally, finds it somewhat terrifyingly modern- far away from his ancient grounds.
However, in this particular moment, with this particular audience, all it does is serve to remind them--
"By yourself?" Draco asks, alarmed.
If there is one thing Harry simply cannot tolerate, it is false accusations. The image of Sirius being dragged into Azkaban, falsely accused, still burnt so close to his skin. So he bullied Ron into helping him crack the case. Ron had not been as reluctant as Harry had imagined he'd be.
Draco relaxes, “oh, you big git. Stop sobbing on my shoulder then and go see your friends!”
“Draco,” Harry says, his voice is deep and breathier than Draco has ever heard it. “Draco, please.”
"Oh?" Draco asks, "what does he like? Should I bring him something?"
Potter nods, “Yes. in the neighborhood. This is a coincidence.”
Potter doesn’t look like a person who hears things like that regularly though. His mouth has dropped open, slack-jawed. Unfortunately for Draco, he has one of those faces that is cute even when absolutely stunned stupid,
Draco was astonished to find that Harry was already trembling against him, the gentle touches doing more to drive him out of his mind than any of Draco’s previous passionate grabs. Draco bites back a smile; it seems so fitting that Harry would respond better to gentle touches. After all, how many people have touched him gently?
“What can I get you?” Draco asks, instead of saying anything. He’s too old to get into fights with Harry Potter, who Draco is not even sure really knows anymore.
He can’t quite help the moan he lets out when he finally lowers his stiff body into the chair beside Potter who smiles at him.
" Draco, I'm worried about him. "
When Harry opened his eyes he was on his stomach and filled with pain. His back ached and his head throbbed. He had the most peculiar sensation on his back.
" Or doesn't need them anymore, it could be the inheritance."
" Of course, Raven. Why don't you have lunch with Hermione and Neville while I get this looked at and I'll see you after. " Harry looked up towards Hermione, who seamed suprised both by the suggestion and by my familiar use of her and Neville's names. When Harry finally nodded, he turned to follow her, but stopped and ran back to hug Draco tightly. Draco wrapped his good arm around Harry.
" When can I see her?" He asked.
Severus paced in the hallway. " What are we supposed to do with him?" Snape asked as Minerva McGonagall entered the area. Lucius was conflicted, as much as he would have liked to pass the child off to his master who had finally gotten some of his sanity back he couldn't.
Draco crouched down and knelt in front of him. " Harry. " He waited until he looked up at him. " This is a very special bookbag, can I show you why?" Harry cautiously nodded and held it out to him. " This is a present my aunt be---" Draco stopped completely. Before smiling again. " My aunt gave this to me, because my things kept getting stolen from me when I was little. Anyone who isn't you that tries to
" Because child, if Harry reverts much further he will be a danger to himself. If you take the magic of a 15 year old wizard and put it in the body of a ten year old he won't be able to control it." Snape stepped to the bed but after several attempts was unable to get within a foot of Harry. " I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. " He stood with the rest of us as Harry got smaller and smaller.  We waited several minutes before approaching after he had stopped glowing.
---------------------
" Harry don't play with the glitter, "
" Calm down, Harry they're okay. you scared them pretty good though. Albus ran through the floo by himself, while James was trying to get through to you and Lilly was tearing the place apart to find some potion." Harry ran a shaking hand through his hair, staring at the rising swarm of memories that had started crashing into the shield of the wall. " Harry, occlomancy is not the was to deal with your problems, especially like this! it's just avoiding them!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Also thank you for reading
" Thank you mother." He smiled up at her and her eyes danced with mirth at his formal words.
Harry-
"Oh no you don't!" Harry was tackled to the ground. " I'll teach you freak!".Harry felt the beafy hands grab on to his.left wing. He scrambled to get out from under him. A large crack filled the room and Harry screamed in pain as his wing was broken. His uncle made quick work of the other wing. Dazed Harry was focused on not passing out from the pain, he didn't notice his uncle getting up and learning over him.
" Yeah, m- mum could usually get him to wake up, told us to use the potion if it happened while she was gone." All my scans came back negative, I couldn't find out what was wrong with him.
Harry blushed under their praise. It still felt like he was breaking the rules. Harry was breaking the rules. He had read nine books today and he was learning. Really trying and letting his freakishness just go about like it was normal. Magic, they called it. A lovely word for something so horrible. He had tried to hold it in at first. But everything was so different and new and loud. His freakishness was so big now! and he had wings and a tail and pointy ears. These people were still pretending to like him, he knew it couldn't last long, wouldn't. He didn't know the rules here and barely anyone told him to do anything. The only things he had been told to do was to go to one of the teachers or older students if he got lost or scared, and Draco had told him he needed to eat last night. It had to be a dream, Harry sighed. He knew he didn't deserve this and the fact that he was dreaming it and liked it meant he really was as ungrateful as the Dursleys were always telling him. A part of him kept whispering that this was real it had to be, because when he crawled under the bed Draco had given him it was cold. When he "woke" up from a "nightmare" and hit his head on the bed it hurt, there was a bruise, then just like normal it disappeared before Draco got up. Whatever it was, a dream or real, he Hadn't felt like this since before he was last thrown in his cupboard.
Harry wasn’t sure who exactly was the man Neville was sitting next to, engaging in conversation with, but he figured he might as well wave his fellow Gryffindor over. Neville’s head perked up and he waved back at Harry, but raised his eyebrows and stared pointedly at Draco when Harry beckoned him to join them. Harry just rolled his eyes and jerked his head to indicate that Neville better get over here soon or else.
A bludger suddenly broke through the cluster of people and brooms at the other side of the pitch and looked like it was heading their way. Harry shouted, “Look out!” but the ball was coming too fast. Barnaby, who had been trying to clear his glasses, couldn’t move in time. As a last resort, Harry steered his broom in front of the bludger. The ball struck him in his left shoulder, making him cry out, and then bounded off for the other side of the pitch. Pain bloomed in his shoulder, all the way down to the tip of his index finger. He hunched over on his broom and tried to breath through the stabbing sensation.
“If you want,” Neville replied. “Take some time to think it over if you’re unsure. Come by the shop on Friday so we can put those blueprints together like you mentioned, alright? I’ll see you then, mate. Draco.” Neville stood up and patted Harry on the shoulder, nodding towards Draco, and then retreating back to his previous seat across the bar.
“Magical Deeds and Realty. The left corridor, at the end.” Harry nodded his thanks and backed away towards the corridor, before turning completely and disappearing from view. He walked down the hallway, wishing that it hadn’t been raining outside as his trainers were now squeaking against the waxed floor. Every step could be heard echoing through the corridor.
“Not really.”
Harry was busy pressing his forehead into the gate like he’d done on numerous occasions in the last few weeks when Draco urged him to turn around. When he did, he was met with another pair of lips on him. Those soft, familiar ones that he’d imagined so many times in the past month. The ones he had just kissed moments before. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and tilted his head to slot their lips together, trying not to smile or laugh in excitement. He finally had to break the kiss, unable to contain his wide grin.
“Where’d you find that?” he asked, looking up and passing the deed back.
They walked in silence for a few moments before Harry spoke up. “You didn’t have to come.”
The blonde smirked, “We have dinner every night.”
“You really should invest in some curtains.”
A pleasant, deep, woodsy scent clung to Harry’s senses, pulling him in further until he realized just how close he had leaned. His arse was barely on the chair anymore, and if he moved any further forward he would surely end up on the polished floor. He forced himself to move back, just to avoid that situation, despite something inside him telling him to move closer.
. Potter was seated in the back corner at a small table set for two, a good distance from any of the surrounding tables. Draco sat primly across from Potter, spreading his cloth napkin across his lap purely on muscle memory alone.
That caught his attention right away. “Really? I’m surprised it’d be that close to…” he trailed off, looking off to the side. A silence grew between them as memories seemed to float through Harry’s head. After a few moments, he snapped out of it.
The smile that stretched across Draco’s face was blinding and contagious. Harry felt his cheeks burning from being stretched so wide. The fact that Draco felt comfortable enough to talk to him about his mother and ask his permission to tell her about them felt like a huge accomplishment, despite Harry previously being unsure about whether there was a
“Okay, right,” Potter murmured, his curved lips lifting in a small smirk, almost hidden by the sip of whisky he took directly after.
After noticing he still had about twenty minutes to spare, he turned around and took the stairs up into Gringott’s two at a time. He hadn’t seen Draco since Monday, but they had written back and forth several times. Mostly about the manor’s defensive spells, but Harry tried to throw in something about how attractive he found the blonde or something along those lines in every letter.
The aurors stepped forward to draw, including Draco. He made eye contact with the Head Auror and pulled a random straw free, groaning when he saw it was only half the length of the rest. He desperately wished to bang his head on the wall. He didn’t have any time to plan a party, especially in three days.
He gave his best friends a quick hug and insisted that he was going home to clean up and then he’d join them. Once they were all headed for the apparition point, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm. “Thanks for staying. And coming in general,” he quickly added, looking nervously up at the blonde. They began walking to the apparition point together, in silence at first.
Hogwarts had changed, as well. Draco had reinstated his parent’s position on the Board of Governors, though he frankly thought himself too young to be a part of it. Muggle Studies was now a required course. The four houses remained, but all competition between them ceased. No more House Cup, no more point system, et cetera. The Quidditch teams were now voluntary, that is — students could pick the team they were on. The castle was still being repaired now, even several years later, but the structure never seemed stronger. Draco had been wary of returning for his eighth year at first, expecting people to point fingers, hex him, or even intentionally get him expelled. But most of the returning students and professors seemed too tired to place the blame on anyone but Voldemort. Most would rather focus on recovery.
Harry reluctantly pulls himself off and is immediately hugged by five more people. There isn’t a single photograph of him anywhere, and no one makes a single joke about Harry Potter Day, not even George.
This also, Harry thought, was

actually managed to get several pictures of Potter crying while buying a tub of ice cream and
You're a trainee."
“Happy birthday, Harry!” Draco mutters in his ear.
“What?” Draco asks he’s ready to sleep the entire day away.
"I do have a plan," Harry said, power walking to an alley where they could apparate to his place. "I have a desk full of letters asking for help. And I say, you and me… Why don't we answer them."
Harry tilts his eyes up from where he’s resting and gifts him another sweet, shy smile and says, “goodnight, Draco.”
Strangely, Harry can't help but feel like no one has ever known him better despite knowing almost nothing about him.
"Why don't we order from the pizza place down the street?"
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Edward," Draco says, his rich voice seemingly even more stiff with the way he's carrying himself.
Draco clutches him closer, “I’m sorry. Though, I am surprised. I didn’t realize anyone could be stupid enough to leave Harry Potter.”
Harry shrugs, “maybe some of it is about that. But some of it is… Maybe I’m a bit lonely. And you seemed lonely too. I feel like no one else is lonely anymore, they all settled down.”
Harry told himself. It was essentially breaking and entering, and though he often walked a thin line of legality, he didn't want Draco to think he had lost his mind,
Adrian hummed a smile on his face while he tipped his head back to look at the clouds. “It's really rare only my family know how to achieve it. I don't why its just the Greyback's my dad hasn't given me that reason yet even though I've asked him a bunch of times.” He glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eye, “would you like to see?” Draco nodded eagerly, “have your wand ready to erect a shield just in case…. I need to strip I’ll be back.” Adrian stood to his feet walking gracefully around a tall hedge completely out of sight. Draco picked up the faint sound of rustling clothes following by cracking and shifting of bones then silence. Grey eyes were glued to that hedge and they widened as a beautiful white wolf slowly prowled towards him.

Fenrir Greyback: February 23 1965 (age 47)
The twinkle his Albus' eyes sparkled brightly as he opened one of his desk doors pulling out three letters. With a groan he got to his feet going over to his faithful familiar. “Please see that these arrive to our friends Fawkes.” He said running two fingers along the bright red and gold feathers of the phoenix. With another trill Fawkes disappeared in a burst of flame while Albus returned to his desk to resume his work, a smile on his face.
Calmly the Boy Who Lived told his mortal enemy that with the help of his most ‘loyal' servants they had found the items that he stored pieces of his soul in, his horcruxes and destroyed each and every last one leaving him mortal once again. This bombshell turned the tide in Harry's favor as this caused Voldemort's spell casting to become more desperate and erratic, and after barely dodging a killing curse Harry sent a powerful Sectemsempra slicing old Snake face's head clean off. This apparently was so funny to Harry that he collapsed into a fit of giggles before passing out from mental and physical exhaustion.
Chapter 1:
During their searches the three of them talked about everything, rehashing old wounds and apologizing slowly healing scars until a friendship started to form, it wasn't perfect Ron and Draco still fought from time to time but it was more light hearted than mean spirited. Also Draco had opened the Manor up for them to live in after he had overheard Ron telling his girlfriend that they needed to move out of the Borrow.
“Stop pouting you're still a whelp Adri,” Fenrir stated folding the Prophet he had been reading so he could focus fully on his son, “it's only natural for someone your age to want comfort while sleeping from an elder. I'm a little sore that it wasn't me but since you haven't seen Thayne in a few days when you were used to being around him all the time in the last 5 years I can understand.” Leaning over he took Adrian's bottom lip in between his fingers and started to tug on it until he smiled and batted his hand away. Still even with those words Adrian still felt embarrassed at the fact that he tried to make a puppy pile with Thayne, thank Merlin Sirius had told him to make his own room last night before slamming the door in his face and locking it. If he had woken up in between them…. That would have been absolutely mortifying. “You will move past this phase trust me…. And may I remind you that you never seem to bawk at the idea of sleeping in a puppy pile when its with Katra, Darius, Ella and Michael.”
“Sirius' patronus has always been a big black dog and the one we just saw was clearly a wolf.” She looked at Adrian, “that was your Uncle's wolf wasn't it?” she asked and he nodded smugly.
The blush returned to Adrian's cheeks as two distinct memories came to mind one occurring the summer before his 4th year after they recovered from the events of the Quidditch World Cup, nightmares had plagued Adrian during the night waking him up really early in the morning, still half asleep he had gone to the room where Bill and Charlie had been staying in and fell back asleep cuddled in between them. Adrian had been incredibly mortified when he had woken up later to see Charlie's concerned blue eyes so close to his face and he started to apologize but Bill waved him off stating that it was something both Ron and Ginny had done when they had been younger. “You're family Harry.” Charlie added with a smile, “don't worry about it.” The older men had promised not to say anything though and it was a promise they still kept between them.
Ron and Draco both snorted into their pumpkin juice while Hermione tsked and smiled at Adrian “I'm sure that was adorable, I can't wait to see your wolf form in a few days. Ron and I have our animagus licenses so we can join you.” She said the redhead nodding while Draco looked a little flustered. “That's great Hermione but dad thinks it would be best if at least for one or two moons that it just be us.” Adrian gestured between him, Fenrir, Thayne and Sirius, “you can watch if you want but just make sure you're behind a shield just in case. Once my wolf knows you guys are pack then you can join.” He explained smiling apologetically at Hermione who looked put out but understood all the same.
A/N: Hey guys! Thank you so much for all of the kudos I'm so glad people liked the prologue. So quick message before going forward with the story, this chapter isn't a rewrite from the original draft. One of the things that bothered me when I read through the story was that I did not take the time to lay out the  background of the disappearance, five year gap etc. Also I moved the original book timeline by 10 years so the war ended in 2007. So this is the start of it. So I hope you enjoy it.
later then regained his composure.
“Merlin I know we shouldn't get our hopes up but this is the first lead we've had in a year.” Ron said just as excited as Hermione was helping her from the loveseat and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. Draco nodded though he didn't comment grabbing his dark suit jacket because of course Draco wore a suit even while at home. The three left the library traveling the short distance to the family room where Lucius and Severus were waiting then departed the manor to the Headmasters office via the fireplace.
“Sorry Dray this is really hard to explain to someone who's human. Mentally a werewolves wolf side is a separate to them with the human side in control most of the time except for the full moon when it’s the wolf's turn. So imagine having an image of a wolf in the back of your mind.” He paused here to check that Draco was still following before he continued, “the more someone fights against that wolf the weaker the connection is causing the wolf side to lash out and lose control on the full moon, accepting those baser instincts strengthens the bond and brings balance. It took me maybe about a week of meditating to find balance with my wolf and my transition didn't hurt at all.”
“Just wanted to say thanks for the drink,” Potter said to him, before turning to the girl and seeming to size her up.
“Just one moment,” Draco claimed, writing a few more words and then signing his name at the bottom. He folded the parchment delicately and slipped it into an envelope, using the Gringotts seal to close it. “Now, what can I help you with?”
Draco nodded, looking down as Harry faced him. He couldn’t help but smile when he saw the way Harry was looking at him. As if in awe, although Draco didn’t think he’d done anything quite worthy of that reaction. He cleared his throat and gently unlocked their arms. “I’ll write you then,” he said politely, unsure of what to say.
But Hermione wasn’t listening to him. “Harry, do you want us to come with you?”
“Have a passionate affair in dark corridors?” Harry sat up, grinning, and grabbed the book off the table. He flipped to a random page. Draco tried to pry it out of his hands, but gave up after a moment’s struggle with a sigh. He leaned back into the couch. Harry straddled his waist, eyes scanning the pages of the book.
Harry nodded and quickly shut the door before the woman could make any more eyes at him. Draco’s glare rivaled even Snape’s. He felt like he had just received a month’s worth of detention. He assumed Draco was just being professional and didn’t really appreciate how Harry kept barging in on his workdays, but then again, when it was just the two of them Draco never really seemed to mind.
“Alright, fine.” Ginny replied, scooting closer to him. “Give me some more blanket, you complete arse.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Well you two weren’t exactly discreet. I’m surprised the Prophet hasn’t gotten wind of it, considering several people saw you and Malfoy holding hands in Diagon Alley.”
He’d successfully avoided the Weasleys for the past few years, and frankly he intended to keep it that way.
Harry apparated directly into Ron and Hermione’s living room, startling the pair, whose bodies were slightly more visible than Harry was comfortable with.
Several Gryffindors took up a table meant for two, surrounding the surface in a wide circle. Empty glasses were piled up in the middle, a cheer emanating from that direction every time one of them added another glass to the top of the pile. Potter was absent from that group. In fact, the only one Draco could name was Dean Thomas; the rest he recognised as Gryffindors from years below him.
Monday morning left Harry stirring in bed, throwing the blanket over his head to block out the bright sun shining straight through the window. Somehow the square of light hit his face perfectly every single morning.
“That’s the fun of it!” Seamus yelled, giving him a friendly push.
They both leaned in, eyes closing, but before they could press their lips together, Harry heard someone say, “Harry, dear! There you are!” They both pulled back quickly and Harry reluctantly let go of Malfoy’s arm. Draco’s fingers lingered on Harry’s elbow, but retreated as well when the source of the voice arrived.
When he arrived on the landing outside the kitchen, Kreacher was lingering by the doorway, muttering about ungrateful Malfoys. This made Harry smile and he walked straight in to see a mug of hot tea floating towards his head. He grabbed it out of the air and took a tentative sip. “So you just came for breakfast?” He asked casually, taking a seat at the table. Draco didn’t reply, and didn’t seem as if he intended to, yet Harry waited for it all the same. After several silent minutes, Harry pulled the book he’d been reading over breakfast for the last month closer. It was just some fictitious wizarding novel with a predictable plot, but it still entertained him nonetheless.
“Well that was the worst date in history,” Draco said casually, grinning down at Harry despite his proclamation. Their hands swung between them as they walked, no destination in mind.
Ron nodded. “Of course, mate. You could have told us earlier.”
Harry glanced past the gate onto the grounds. It was quite foggy, and he could barely make out the shape of the mansion in the distance. He’d hoped bringing his friends for tea would help the house trust him, but he didn’t notice any changes in it. He sighed and sipped his tea as it grew colder, tuning back into the conversation.
“Certainly n–”
“Are you sure he… er, won’t come after me when he finds out you’re not destined to marry the pureblood woman they’ve chosen for you?”
“Abandonment? You’re saying the house has…depression?”
Harry looked to the ceiling, desperately hoping it held the answer as to why things like this always happened to him. All he had wanted to do was buy his godson a birthday gift, and now he’s suddenly a property owner. How does that even happen?
Weasley placed a hand on his shoulder and leaned in to whisper. “Harry is in my office and he wants to talk to you.”
, and yet Draco just wanted them more. He wanted them all.
Harry apparated home and the worry immediately set in. What if the house was in such disrepair that his presence wouldn’t be enough to fix it? Obviously he’s handy and he can renovate it without an issue, but the memories of what the property used to be would be tarnished. Just look at what he did to Grimmauld Place. He completely changed it, barely keeping anything that reminded him of what the house used to look like, aside from his memories of course. Most of it was either locked away at Gringott’s or destroyed. Harry briefly wondered if he had desecrated the House of Black by changing everything, and then reminded himself that most of that family had been awful to him, with the exception of Andromeda, Draco, and Sirius. He wanted to keep as much of the memory of the manor as possible, but doubt was starting to kick in.
Not many, he discovered. Pansy was in the corner, a man on either side of her, right where Draco knew she wanted to be. He watched as one of the men leaned in to whisper in her ear, her lips curving up in a silent laugh. The other man was brushing kisses and licks down the slope of her neck and shoulder. Draco would have to owl her tomorrow to see how that went.
“We have to reset it,” she informed him. He had tried to reply, had tried to ask what that would entail and how much it would hurt, but she jerked his arm up and back into the socket before he could. “Fuck!” He shouted, glaring at the healer for putting him through this. Though he knew he really had done this to himself. She placed an ice pack on his shoulder and told him to stay put for ten minutes.
He nodded. The quaffle was at the other end of the pitch and the two of them watched the chasers fight for it. “It’s good to be back on the pitch,” Harry said conversationally.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, alright. My trousers, where did they go?” Potter was frantic, muttering to himself while on his knees, desperately trying to gather his clothes.
The couple finally bid goodbye and Potter, in turn, ordered another drink for himself, eyes once again travelling around the bar and landing on Draco. Draco, luckily, had still been watching Potter out of the corner of his eye and was absentmindedly chatting with the woman next to him. Her name was Rebecca, or Rachel, or… something. Draco had been letting her do the majority of the talking, considering she hadn’t even stopped to allow him a response anyway. Potter watched him until a fresh drink was placed in front of him, then seemed to revert back to his previous loner state.
“Clearly everything that happened when we were children still bothers you, considering how little you can stand to look me in the eye, so why don’t we just talk about it so we can both move on?” Draco had given Potter a wide berth when he was trying to leave, and he closed that distance, now only standing a few feet away.
“And then you’ll stop showing up wherever I am and harassing me like this?”
Draco shook his head, “Not necessary. I know she’ll be happy.” He paused. “Can’t say the same for my father, however.”
“Can we talk about something else?” Harry grumbled, laying the blueprints he’d been fidgeting with on the desk.
Ron, Hermione, and Harry said their goodbyes to Bippy and the manor house nearly an hour later, Harry with the vow to return and not only investigate but try to clean up the place and see what he would be working with. He wasn’t going to let the house sit and look like that. Especially knowing that he himself was capable of getting the place up and running.
“Should I… D’you think I should come with you? To tell her I mean?”
He weaved between tables and out the door. Potter was rounding on him before he even had a chance to blink, pointing a solid finger in his face. “You haven’t changed at all,” Potter declared, his eyes bright with fury and something Draco wanted to say was attraction, but couldn’t be certain.
Harry pecked him on the cheek and wished him a good rest of the day at work, and then apparated on the spot.
He was silent for a moment before he turned around and they made eye contact. “Okay, don’t laugh.” A smile was already starting to form. “I said don’t!” He passed her one of the pages Malfoy had given him.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “We usually deliver them.”
Harry reached out, gripping Draco’s elbow and pulling him closer. Backing himself up against the fence, he continued to reduce the space between them until he could feel Draco’s breath ghosting across his face. He looked up into the blonde’s eyes and then down to his mouth before finally, gently pressing his lips to the other man’s. After a moment, first their lips parted and then their bodies did.
Draco pushed until he was fully seated inside Potter, head hanging down to watch himself. Potter squirmed below him, panting, silently encouraging Draco to move. Draco took the hint, gripping Potter’s hips as he pulled back and fucked into him again. When Draco finally looked up, Potter was watching him with a heavy stare, pupils blown. Draco came to a momentary halt, entranced.
This was a date, right? He had asked Draco out for dinner after they’d made out in his office for quite some time, so that was the assumption. He’d specifically chosen this semi-fancy muggle restaurant so they wouldn’t be recognized and they could dine in peace, but with every ticking minute gone by, it seemed to be falling apart.
He pulled the usual blanket out of his basket and opened it up, spreading it on the grass under a tree nearby and placing the basket in the center. So far, this was his favorite tree. It was more wide than it was tall, and the branches cast wicked shadows on the grass below, but when he looked closer at the trunk there was something that nearly brought tears to his eyes when he first saw it. Etched into the bark, with a knife or maybe even magic, were the letters “LE + JP”. His parents. He briefly wondered if his father had been the one to carve it out of hope for a relationship with his mother, or if they’d done it together. He imagined a day where they spent hours on this very lawn, laughing and watching the day go by.
“Malfoy!” Thomas laugh-shouted, his chair scooting back several inches as he stood up and thumped Draco on the back, forcing him to stumble forward. Draco, shocked and just a little bit suspicious, nodded as if Thomas had asked him a question. Thomas wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him up against his side and giving Draco a strong whiff of his cologne, mixed with the scent of alcohol and sweat lingering in the bar. “Mayfoy. Shit—,” Thomas laughed, “
“That’s what the deed says, Harry,” Hermione replied, then quoted directly from the document, “
“Oh, hey,” Harry said casually, and then chuckled. “Yeah I guess I have a habit of saving people from pain.”
Harry focused on trying to read Draco’s face, but Draco was looking straight down at his plate and merely frowning at it.
“Not in the wizarding world, you don’t.” And it’s true. For the past five years, Harry had barely paid for a single thing when he went to Diagon Alley. He was guaranteed bottomless drinks at the Leaky, and ice cream for life when Fortescue’s reopened its doors. He was technically the main investor in the Weasley’s joke shop, but that’s already paid off with the amount of merchandise George sends him every month or two. Several times he resorted to sneakily paying for things. It didn’t seem fair that he got everything for free when he had plenty of gold to pay for it all. Especially when there were witches and wizards like the Weasley family who couldn’t afford much at all.
Potter’s free hand flew to the back of Draco’s neck, tugging him back into a snog. Draco went willingly, his hips grinding deeply against Potter’s arse, over and over. He pressed his weight into his forearm, reaching down to grip Potter’s cock in his fist. The both of them groaned into the kiss, moving seamlessly together. Draco felt his body go hot, felt the telling stir in his lower stomach as he thrust into Potter. His hand tightened around Potter’s prick, stroking in time with his own hips. Potter broke the kiss, gasping for breath underneath him. Draco pressed his forehead into Potter’s shoulder, breath hitching, the friction between them threatening to send him over the edge. The heel of Potter’s foot dug into the back of Draco’s thigh, keeping him in place as Potter’s back arched, coating Draco’s fingers in his sticky release.
“Yours is there, of course,” Neville told him, “you think I’d let them sell out and not save one for my number one customer?”
He could have sworn he saw a white-blonde head turning to stare up at the Weasley clan right before he took off.
Harry definitely thought he needed to find a way to make the gate move faster, rather than spending a whole minute each time waiting for it to open wide enough for someone to slip through. He supposed some oil on the hinges might do the trick. Ron waved his goodbye before apparating and Harry followed suit short after, picnic basket in hand.
The first thing Harry saw was the pale blonde hair, combed into a neat, respectable style just as it had been in their 8th year at Hogwarts. Malfoy sat behind a large wooden desk, leaning back in his chair but not lounging by any means. He beckoned Harry to come in and he did, standing awkwardly. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy barely looked shocked to see him standing in front of him. It had been several years since the last time they saw each other at Hogwarts. Though the Wizengamot was not particular to throwing Draco Malfoy in Azkaban, they were rather hopeful they could secure house arrest for him and his mother. For four hours he had argued with the court, insistent that they let Draco and Narcissa Malfoy go free. The former because he was merely a teen at the time, still heavily influenced by his father’s political views, and the latter because she had saved his life in the forest. After those tiresome hours, in which Harry had drank so much water to clear his dry throat that by the end he desperately needed to relieve his bladder but refused to on principle, they had finally cut a deal. Draco Malfoy would return to Hogwarts for his eighth year, after which he would be off scot-free, and Narcissa would be placed on a loose probation. All things considered, Harry assumed that was the best he would get so he agreed.
“Wicked. Do you think your dad--” Hermione sent a swift kick to Ron’s shin and he yelped. “Bloody hell! What was that for?”
Draco started to turn back in protest, but Thomas just turned him back and the rest of the crowd cheered again, leaning forward in their respective seats. And Draco understood. This was like a sport to them, a game to play when they got together. Draco could hear a quick wager being made between a few people beside him.
“I did,” Harry confirmed, finally screwing the first shelf into place before he had to start the next one.
— he could’ve had if he’d only thought about it the way Wood had framed it. The Gryffindors, Wood had said Draco
“What was that for?” he muttered, reaching down to rub his leg.
He hoisted himself up, sighing. “If you and ‘Mione aren’t busy tomorrow, I’d like to try.”
Somehow Harry got roped into playing football with Teddy and his friends. Him, Teddy, and a little girl were on one team, much to Teddy’s pleasure considering it was his birthday. Harry was making his way down the makeshift field in the yard, dribbling the ball between his feet, getting so close to the goal when three of his opposing team ganged up on him. His foot slipped over the ball and he landed flat on his back, quickly covered in five- and six-year-olds.
“No,” Potter said firmly.
“Well…are you dating him?”
But they weren’t dating, technically, so Harry had to admit it was rude of him to appear so often and expect Draco to immediately be available. Draco had a job. A
Potter’s shirt came off next, getting caught on his glasses and sending them clattering to the floor. They stumbled their way to Draco’s bedroom, taking turns pressing each other against walls and furniture. Draco was thankful his precious vase collection was housed at the Manor, because Potter was not being gentle in the least. He pushed Potter down on the bed, grabbing a hold of the hems of Potter’s trousers and yanking them down his legs sharply.
Harry flushed and broke eye contact with George. “He’s fine,” he mumbled, not really ashamed but not exactly thrilled to have his love life broadcast to the entirety of the Weasley family, though he had to admit they hadn’t exactly been hiding the fact that they had been spending quite a bit of time together in the last few weeks. He knew the Weasleys loved him but he was sure they had some residual qualms about the Malfoy family. He just hoped he could convince them that Draco wasn’t like his father. Not that Harry even knew that much about Draco’s family life of late.
“Malfoy,” Weasley beckoned him over.
Draco wedged his shoulder between a broad man wearing a plaid shirt, who eyed Draco as if sizing him up, and a woman whose form-fitting dress looked as if it was one movement away from slipping down and revealing more than Draco wished to see. When his hip connected with the bar, he sighed with relief, quickly flagging down the bartender and ordering himself something strong. He threw a couple of Galleons on the bar and turned so he could lean his arse against the counter, peering around the place for a recognisable face.
Draco nodded. “Right,” he replied. He set his drink on the nearest flat surface and weaved his way through the cubicles to the Head Auror’s office. He knocked on the slightly ajar door and poked his head in. “Potter, I apologize. I forgot about the payment, but I can write you that check no—mmf.” A pair of soft lips pushed against his unexpectedly. Draco stumbled back against the door from the force and quickly tried to balance himself by leaning onto Potter, wrapping his arms around Potter’s waist. They took time with the kiss, a chance to really feel each other for the first time, until the need to breathe dominated.
Smiling, Potter reached for an order form. Gods, he was beautiful when he smiled. “Hmm. A cake for that many people would probably take too long. I think we would be able to make some assorted cookies if you think that would work for the party. All Valentine’s themed, of course.” He began filling out the form while Draco just nodded along and took in the rest of the store. A few sets of tables and chairs were cleaned and empty and there was a small stage set up in the corner which looked like it was only big enough for one person.
Potter rolled his eyes, switching his pile of files from one arm to the other. “Of course you are.”
That Friday, Harry had been putting the finishing touches on the bathroom on the fourth floor, setting up a couple shelves to hold towels and such, when he heard a familiar woosh from several floors below.
“Why, Potter,” Draco teased out of habit, “have I finally convinced you with my wiles?”
He leaned his elbow on the counter, facing Potter. “How are you, then?”
“Just put your fucking prick inside me,” Potter insisted, his fingers curling in the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck and tugging sharply. Draco didn’t hesitate. He sat back up and coated his prick in the remaining lube, tugging Potter’s hips closer and lining himself up. Potter’s hand slid up Draco’s thigh, nails digging in when Draco began pushing into him. “Yessss, Merlin,” Potter hissed.
Harry and Ron ended up in Ron’s old room, the garishly orange Chudley Cannons posters beginning to fray at the corners. Hermione arrived to the room a short while later and laid down with Ron on the opposite side of the room. Harry had some brief, nostalgic feelings, remembering how they spent months in a tent together. Ron and Hermione both fell asleep quickly, the sound of their rhythmic and slow breathing making Harry’s eyes drift shut. Before he could fall completely asleep, however, the door opened.
After a pint and a half and a lull in the conversation, Harry chanced a look around the bar. Most of the inhabitants were at tables with their mates, laughing and drinking the day away. At the table closest to the exit, a group of tall men in button down shirts and slacks were shouting and laughing with each other. Harry thought they looked like a group on lunch from the Ministry. Harry’s eyes continued to scan the place for anyone he recognized until it landed on a familiar sandy-brown head.
Approaching a random goblin, a rather new one it looked like, Harry cleared his throat. The goblin set down its quill and gazed at Harry blankly. “Yes?” It’s beady eyes seemed to glare at him and he briefly wondered if they still hated him for breaking into the bank, stealing from a vault, and escaping on the back of their protective dragon.
Bippy popped back into existence, startling all three of them as she set the tray on the dusty floor.
“These look quite delicious,” Draco said politely, shooting Potter a small smile. “Thank you for letting me place the order.”
“It could have. Some gates are harder to break out of than the cells in Azkaban, unless you ask it nicely. I know my- Malfoy Manor has a particularly difficult gate, which is why I usually just apparate directly inside.”
“Hello Harry,” he greeted. “Draco,” he nodded at the blonde when Draco turned to look at him.
He walked around Draco’s desk and asked, “Do you trust me?”
“Bad day?” Draco murmured, taking a second to pull off the glasses perched on Harry’s nose before returning his fingers to the unruly hair.
Potter’s distrusting expression did not change. In fact, Potter didn’t seem to react at all, so Draco decided it would be best to continue the apology. “I was a right pillock back at Hogwarts. Especially fourth and fifth year, I know. Look, I’m not asking for forgiveness, I just want you to know I’m sorry for what I did. I’m sorry for what Voldemort made me do.”
The space at the bar was still sticky from spilled drink, but they both took a seat and leaned their elbows on it anyway. Harry’s uniform was still caked in mud, despite even Draco’s attempts to freshen it up.
The war had changed things. Many house-elves were freed in the aftermath, but most still preferred to be employed. The Malfoy elves were offered freedom when Draco became the head of the Malfoy estate. He’d stood in the kitchen of the Manor, the lot of them staring at him with wide, bulging eyes as he’d begun speaking, but in an act of disloyalty — or perhaps an overabundance of loyalty — they had merely turned back to their work and ignored the rest of his speech. Draco had resigned to giving them each one day off per week and a small salary. Most of the elves kept their money in sacks under their thin pillows, without the thought of ever using it, but Draco had given it to them and that was all that mattered.
“My vault.”
’. He wanted to grin. No, he wanted to jump up from the table and scream from the rooftops that he and Draco were together. He wanted one of those Muggle contraptions he’s seen at protests in downtown London, the ones like the Sonorus charm that make their voices louder and more grating and more annoying. He wanted to tell everyone he crossed paths with on the street, stranger or not. He wanted to kiss Draco in public, in private, wherever they wanted. He even, dare he say it, wanted to see what kind of reaction the Prophet would have if they found out. He wanted to see himself smiling and happy with Draco Malfoy on the front cover of an admittedly speculative newspaper, but he didn’t care. He wanted them to be seen together everywhere and he didn’t want to hide it.
An elbow to the ribs ripped him out of his thoughts and he looked to Ginny who sat next to him. She just stared back. His gaze moved around the table, noticing everyone watching him in anticipation. The sudden focus of attention on him made his palms sweat and he smiled nervously. “What’s happening?” he dared to ask, trying to nonchalantly wipe the sweat that had gathered at his brow.
?” He had laughed so hard he started to hold his sides from pain.
“Mm,” was Draco’s only answer. His eyes shut again, covers pulled up, drifting in and out to the sounds of Thomas gathering his clothes.
“Do you think you’ll stay? I mean… If you’ve got other deliveries, it’s okay, but…I’d like it if you stayed.” Draco didn’t face Potter when he said this, his cheeks exponentially heating up with each word out of his mouth.
“I figure I should start,” Draco said in a firm voice, though a hint of question came through. He wasn’t normally this nervous; generally, the men he pursued were already half-drunk and up for most things. But this was different, almost intimate. Draco realised he hadn’t been on a date in over a year; hadn’t even been out to eat with friends for nearly that long.
Draco stared at him incredulously, seeming to search for something in Harry’s earnest expression, and finally stood up from his chair. Harry offered him his arm, hoping that he’d take it. Draco’s fingers felt soft and rigid at the same time as they wrapped around his elbow. Harry gripped his wand and apparated them.
Draco watched him, waiting until Harry was a mere inches away from him to respond. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft and slightly vulnerable, though he’d never admit it. “Thank you.”
“Harry?” He heard Ron call.
Draco apparated off to work with a sharp
He didn’t know what to expect, so obviously he enlisted the help of his two best friends. Of course, unlike him they both worked full time jobs, so convincing them to ditch work tomorrow to help him was pretty shallow of him. If anything, he should wait for the weekend. And if he couldn’t wait....well, then he’d just have to go at it alone.
Harry whirled around, staring at Hermione and Ron with a mixture of shock and panic on his face. When his friends offered up no help at all, he turned back. “Erm…Bippy? How long have you been here?” The elf made a delighted noise at the sound of her name and sunk into another curtsy.
One of Malfoy’s eyebrows rose slowly and his lips twitched, as if fighting off a smirk. Harry mentally kicked himself for being so ineloquent.
“Only when you’re around,” was his verbal reply. It was said in the same jesting tone as before, but had some sort of finality to it as well. Seriousness. They didn’t dwell like that, however, as Harry quickly spoke again, “I’ll go to practice if you have lunch.”
“And he didn’t invite Ron? Is he still dropping hints that he wants you to replace him?”
“How’s the training program?” Draco blurted out, startling Potter and himself in the process. Potter looked at him as if he’d grown a few more heads, not bothering to answer Draco’s question.
Something, maybe Draco’s pride, forced him to follow Potter. He couldn’t just allow Potter to slander him, threaten him, without some sort of retaliation.
Draco hailed to the barman, who immediately wandered over. “Another for me and he’s drinking whisky on the rocks,” Draco half-spoke, half-shouted.
Harry was silent for a moment as he screwed it in tight, holding the shelf in place. “I don’t think so. We’ve only really gone for drinks at the pub.” He threw the rest of his supplies back in his toolbox and urged Ron out of the loo, following behind him. “Are you only here to interrogate me or are we going for lunch?”
“You haven’t. You’re still the same blood purist, attention-hogging little brat you were at Hogwarts.”
“Master is gracious,” Bippy said at last in a shaking voice. She composed herself and proclaimed, “Bippy will make biscuits!” and popped out of the foyer once more.
Potter laughed at that. “I’m fine, Malfoy. How are you?”
and expecting the whole world to bow down. He didn’t
She nodded quickly. “Yes, I think so. Oh! I’d almost forgotten why I came over. Ron said you wanted us to join you at the manor today.”
“Are you alright, Hermione?” He asked, leaning forward to set the bag down on the low table.
“Gonna fuck you,” Draco whispered hotly, teeth scraping against Potter’s earlobe. Potter spread his legs in response, allowing Draco’s body to fall between them. Potter muttered a lubrication charm, aimed at Draco’s hand, and the pad of Draco’s middle finger swiped against Potter’s hole. His finger slid in easily, Potter shuddering underneath him, and he wasted no time in adding another digit. Potter whined, pressing his arse down against Draco’s fingers.
oof guys i wrote a whole lot today and it's crazy but hopefully this chapter makes you guys happy like it made me and sorry it's been so long since updating! school's about to start and college really is hell let me tell you but stay in school cause it's supposed to be worth it (we'll see) anyway yikes i'm sleep deprived love you goodnight
Neville spent a moment talking to his table-mate and then excused himself, heading towards the bar.
“Here,” Potter placed something in Draco’s hand. It was another heart shaped cookie, but this one was different than the others. While the ones at the party were sophistically, generically decorated, Draco could clearly see that this one had been iced by hand. The background was the same soft pink, but this one has a bright yellow bee iced onto it and big, black letters that spelled out “BEE MINE”.
Draco’s eyes darkened critically, fingers tightening around Harry’s wrist. “He couldn’t if he tried. He’d have to go through the entirety of wizarding Britain to get to you. And he’d have to go through me.”
Harry wondered if he was forced to say that to every customer. “Er,” he started, “Well I tried to get into my house, er, my manor, and the gate wouldn’t open. I didn’t know if there’s something else I should be doing to open it…?” He trailed off, hands wringing in his lap as Malfoy merely stared at him.
“Sorry for barging in” he mumbled, leaning his head back on the plush couch.
Draco’s arm snaked around Potter’s waist, pulling them flush together. Potter glanced up, making eye contact. He was still angry, that was obvious, but there was that small bit of uncertainty in his expression which made Draco lean down and touch their lips together.
Minutes went by, Harry pressed up against the bookshelf, hands tightly gripping the back of Draco’s dress shirt, wrinkling it between his fingers. Draco’s tongue was insistent against Harry’s lips, prying its way inside. The blonde’s hand slid down to rest against Harry’s hip, thumb hooking into the waistband of his jeans. Harry attempted to pull Draco closer, but they were already pressed so tightly together that nothing changed. Harry had just had the thought to slip his hand down over Draco’s arse when there was a short knock on the door. They pulled apart, panting.
“Tell her,” Draco finished, staring curiously across the table. “Yeah?” he asked after a second. Harry just nodded and forked a huge chunk of egg into his mouth.
“If you’d let that bludger hit the keeper you probably would have won,” Malfoy pointed out.
“Welcome back.”
Grinning fondly, Harry reciprocated, but with a lot less wetness. “Hey, kiddo.”
“No problem. Procrastinators need to help each other out,” he laughed.
The wait wasn’t long, but he was growing more and more impatient by the minute. He tapped the tube of paper he was carrying against the wall in a rhythmic pattern out of boredom. After ten minutes, he’d resigned himself to just go to his meeting with Neville and he’d write Draco a letter explaining why he left. And, he thought, next time I’ll make an appointment. He checked his watch once again and sighed, pushing himself off the wall and beginning the walk back to the lobby. Halfway down, he heard the door open and both Draco and his client emerged. The woman hustled down the hallway, throwing Harry a sultry grin as she passed him. Harry eyed her warily and cleared his throat, gaze finally locking with Draco’s at the end of the hall.
that we can go back to my place so if you want to hex me no one would be around to stop you.”
, he told himself. Harry tried not to stare at him the whole time, awkwardly looking around the office again until Malfoy had finished.
“What?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised.
Malfoy’s lips were moving wordlessly as he focused, a strand of pale hair falling in his eyes as he hunched over. Harry briefly wished he could push it back, then shook those thoughts away.
“Well I think it’s wonderful that you’re putting yourself out there Harry darling,” she replied with finality, shocking Harry into silence by her easy acceptance. She hadn’t exactly been pleased when he told her he was gay, probably holding onto some hope that he and Ginny would end up together, but it only took her a day or two to come around. He was grateful as the conversation veered in another direction now.
“Can’t really classify that as a conversation. You were sloshed, wouldn’t listen to anything I said.”
Draco nodded. “We haven’t exactly avoided being seen together, yet somehow the Prophet hasn’t gotten wind of it. Still, I would rather my mother find out from me than a newspaper.” Harry had to use all the muscles in his face to keep his expression casual instead of grinning like a loon. After studying his face for a moment, Draco seemed to force himself to continue, “She deserves to know what’s happening. I would feel a lot better if I could-”
. Though, Harry was never comfortable being addressed quite so formally anyway. Malfoy’s tone was merely professional, not a single hint of sarcasm or anger in sight. Harry was impressed, considering how he and Malfoy had gone toe-to-toe several times during that eighth year at Hogwarts, nearly getting them both expelled at one point.
“Hi,” he finally croaked out, alarmed by the amount of sleep in his voice. His feet slid across the hardwood floor, a profound lazy feeling preventing him from picking them up properly. When he reached Draco, he threw his arms around the taller man’s neck and planted a sweet kiss on the corner of his mouth. “Won’t you stay for breakfast?”
After sitting for an hour, unable to sleep despite the rhythmic sound of Draco’s breathing, Harry stood up. The alcohol was still coursing through his system, but he was slightly more stable than he had been and he debated whether he wanted to carry Draco to the bed in the guest room or just crash on the couch across from him.
Harry sighed as he touched his wand to the cool metal of his vault, his breath slipping through his lips in wispy puffs that curled upward before disappearing. The heavy door lurched to the side, allowing him entrance. He took a moment just to stare at his fortune, which was beginning to look depleted and significantly different from the mountain of gold he remembered from when he was eleven. It used to be taller than him, but now only came up just above his knee. He was in no means struggling for money, and he really didn’t have to change anything about his spending habits at all, but if he wished to save money for the future he’d need to get a job. The only issue was that he quite enjoyed the time he was spending focusing on his hobbies.
As he feared, fucking Potter would certainly be a difficult task to achieve.
“Oh shove off,” Harry punched Ron in the arm. He checked his watch and then stood up. “I’ve got to go meet with Neville about his shop.”
This certainly must have looked odd to passersby, but the nearest neighbor seemed to be more than a mile away from where Harry sat. He attempted to clear his mind, pointedly trying to erase thoughts of how stupid having tea outside the locked iron gate of your abandoned mansion would look to someone strolling by. He drank slowly, methodically, and took a bite of biscuit precisely after every third sip of tea. He needed to be present for this.
“You opened it?” He questioned immediately, watching as the trees bloomed beyond the gate and the path formed.
Harry gave her a peck on the cheek and a hug before grabbing his basket. “I’ll floo you with any updates,” he said as he made his way to the front door.
Ginny nudged Harry’s arm and he forced his eyes open. “Hmm?” he asked, watching as she pushed at his arm again.
“Neville? Of course not.”
Potter seemed to weigh his options for a few seconds before declaring, “Fine. Meet me at Rosita’s, by the owl emporium. Seven o’clock.”
The other Gryffindors eyed Draco at first, but seemed to calm when Thomas took Draco in so easily, as if they were old friends. Draco couldn’t even remember a single conversation he’d ever had with the bloke, but he’d take it.
He squeezed it lightly before letting go, but found that he missed the physical contact. Harry found himself leaning closer and decided to place his hand on Malfoy’s outer arm, close to his shoulder, for balance. At least that’s what he told himself.
Scoffing, Draco slid a hand onto the back of Harry’s head, fingers pulling the hair tight. He pressed his lips against the brunette’s, hauling him in closer at the first touch of soft skin. Draco tried to put everything he was feeling into the kiss. Love, admiration, fondness, exhilaration, and exasperation alike.
He had repainted the entire house in white. Despite having very few windows, it felt much brighter in each room. The dungeon-like kitchen now felt like a normal kitchen, with new cabinets and even a muggle refrigerator.  Sometimes Harry felt he had replaced the whole house, that there were no longer any memories lingering from his youth in this house, but other times Harry thought he needed to make this house the complete opposite of what it used to be. Maybe it was just for his peace of mind.
