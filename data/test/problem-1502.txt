Draco gave a curt nod and linked his arm over Harry’s.  Within a few seconds, they were standing in a shabby living room.
In the dining room, he made the food disappear, not wanting Draco to have to face it later.  A romantic gesture that Harry had callously used against him.
“Would we be here, together, if it wasn’t for that time together at that drafty old castle?” Draco said, waving a hand in the air for emphasis.
They both got busy finding the right rocks, a bit of competitive spark already forming.  Pretty soon, they both had a small pile.  Harry showed Draco how to stand at a slight angle to the pond, and do a sidearm pitch with a flick of the wrist at the end.  Many rocks disappeared with a big splash with no skipping, but Draco clenched his jaw and threw rock after rock.  He watched Harry throwing his, modifying his technique, getting better.
Was he actually going to do this?  Try to seduce Draco Malfoy?  He was a virgin, and there was a very good chance Draco was too.  Would it actually have to be full sex?  More than once?  How far was Harry willing to go?
“Thanks,” Harry mumbled, and picked up the breakfast tray.  Had Draco done that before?  Scorgified Harry clean when he had been unconscious when they first arrived?  In the days after when he was sleeping heavily?  The thought was strangely disturbing.
Just touching Draco sent a spark through him, especially after so many days apart.  Harry was tempted to shove Draco in the sofa and kiss him senseless, but he held back.  This was going to be so good.  At least he hoped it would be.
“I want it,” Harry replied, and proved his words by taking Draco back into his mouth, letting him slide along his tongue even deeper than he’d dared before.  He sucked harder, bobbing his head a little, his motions restricted by the bars.  And Draco’s hands, back into his hair, clenching whenever he hit a really good spot.
Draco was perched on the top of a huge pile of furniture, looking around in desperation and coughing from the smoke.  His skin was shiny with sweat from the heat of the fire climbing all around him.
“Look, I appreciate the time and effort you put into all of this, but I’m not really into floral patterns and scented candles.  Not really into B&Bs,” Harry said, throwing a pillow with an oversized daisy on to the overstuffed chair.
Gathering himself, Harry clenched his teeth and walked unassisted to the cell.  It was slow, but he managed it.  He sunk down on to the bed, holding back a sigh of relief.
Harry kept him at a slow pace, not wanting him to get hurt and ending up in a muggle hospital.  But as they travelling away into less crowded areas, they were able to pick up speed.  Harry loved the expression of wonder on Draco’s face the first time he coasted down a small dip in the path.
Collapsed together, they slowly recovered.  Harry traced lazy patterns over the sweat damp skin of Draco’s smooth back with his clean hand.  “You totally seduced me.”
“Along with vegetables and herbs for the kitchen,” Harry added, able to picture them working outside together, shovelling soil.
Harry thought of those years, trying to be invisible around his relatives.  If Aunt Petunia saw him, she gave him a task to do around the house.  If Dudley saw him, he would be teased or thumped on the head.  He hid in the garden under bushes, letting his imagination go as he watched the clouds.  Or escaped to hang out in parks.
“So, you aren’t sorry for kissing me, you are just sorry for kissing me if I didn’t want it?” Draco asked, his eyebrows raised in disbelief.
He looked very young like that, fumbling for what to say.  Unsure, instead of his typical cocky demeanour.  They were still virgins after all.
He immediately regretted letting that comment slip out, as he saw the shock on Draco’s face.  “What?  No toys?”  The concept was completely foreign to him.
Harry had never made out with someone before, but he was pretty sure that was what they were doing.  They shared soft, light kisses, building into harder, deeper ones.  Draco teased him with the tip of his tongue, tracing along his lips, and into his mouth.
Draco stopped, glaring at Harry at first, but then his expression eased.  He tilted his chin at a proud Malfoy angle.  “All the men I’ve dated do that,” he said dismissively.
Standing in the department’s lobby, he glared at anyone who came by, making most of them scuttle out of sight.
His eyes landed in Draco again. His enemy, no matter that he was being relatively kind, bringing Harry his meals, letting him be outside like this. He wouldn’t stop his father when he arrived, wouldn’t stand in the way when he came for Harry. Just like he hadn’t stopped Snape from killing Dumbledor. Maybe he wasn’t evil enough to kill the headmaster himself, but he had facilitated it. Let Deatheaters into Hogwarts. Students and Order of the Phoenix members had been attacked.
But under one hand, he felt something hard.  Draco’s wand, tucked up his sleeve like most witches and wizards did.  Harry didn’t let himself think for even a second.
Draco shifted away, pushing Harry on to his back and climbing on top of him.  It seemed to work best for him like this, able to control the speed and the angle.  Harry loved watching him, stroking his cock, wanting to see him cum.
Eventually he gave up.  “Never mind.  I never had much of that stuff anyways.  I had no toys of my own.”
He awoke, feeling warm and lazy. The sun was bright but not strong enough to burn. It was only March, and sunny days were rare in England this time of year.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Draco pulling on a suit jacket, and knew he’d need to step it up a little.  He pulled out a paisley printed tie, and fumbled with it in the mirror.  Swearing softly to himself as the knot came out lumpy.
Pure instinct lead him to a plain wooden box.  The diadem was there, a large blue gemstone making up the body of the Ravenclaw eagle.
Draco pushed a hand downwards, into Harry’s loose jeans.  He pressed firmly against his erection, the tight material of his underwear all that was separating them.  He was moaning too, moving against Harry’s ass.  Harry felt him freeze, and then groan, shuddering against his back.  It set Harry off too, his eyes squeezed tight as he pressed into Draco’s hand.
The boat was fairly large and steady, as it moved quickly along, waves lapping against the hull.  This time of year, it got dark quite early, and Harry could see the sky changing into rich golds and red, reflecting against the water.  The tall buildings along the shore were silhouettes, with some starting to glow with lights inside.
Harry gathered his nerve, and sunk to his knees.  He pushed Draco’s clothes out of the way, finding him fully hard.  Perfect.  He leaned forward, kissing the tip.
Draco locked him in and left without a word.  It wasn’t until he was fully upstairs that Harry realized he still had the binding around his wrists.  Had that been intentional?
There was no denying he had been attracted to Cho, and then to Ginny.  Had liked kissing them, being with them.  But Draco had always been on his radar.  How often did he glance his way during meals or in classes?  Fly against each other in games?  Spy on his movements in the hallways? Had part of that been an attraction that he hadn’t been self aware enough to understand?
It was a while later Harry was lying beside him, a goofy smile on his face.  “So, when you say you cared about me for ages, did it start in the robe maker’s shop?  The first day we met?”
So that is what Draco was doing besides picking up the basket. About half his plans went up in smoke. “That makes it a lot more fair, actually. I can probably win if we fought.”
Seeing him spread out, naked, against the dark grey bedsheets, made Harry pause and blink.  “Fuck, you are so gorgeous,” he murmured before leaning down to kiss Draco.
If he knocked Draco out, there was no way for Harry to escape. He couldn’t enter the house, that it was warded to only let Malfoy’s to enter, and the others that they allowed. Could he tie Draco up, and force him to enter the castle? Force him to tell him where the wands were?
He stripped and washed, dunking his head under the tap, grateful the water was warm, at least.  He used his hands to sluice the water off his skin and hair, and slipped his clothes back on.
“Selfish because I cared about you, Harry.  More than I cared about my family’s honour,” Draco clarified.
It turned out, Draco didn’t know much about airplanes.  He had taken their lunch trays inside and brought out some paper, and they had been working at folding them for at least half an hour.
Draco scoffed, passing the dish to Harry. “We went to the same school for six years, Potter. You think I could avoid noticing the way you stuffed your face every time it was served?”
The direct statement took Harry completely off guard.  He searched Draco’s eyes, and could see the determination there, plus maybe a bit of hurt.  It said a lot that he could read him better now than a few months ago.  How many dates had he gazed at his face over a table at a restaurant, or at a bar or a game?  How many times in a bed?
There were iron bars, and beyond that a figure wearing a dark grey cloak, a thick hood pulled up over his head, shadowing his face.  A pale hand pushed the hood back, revealing Draco.
It was a long night.  Harry was up for most of it, reliving every delicious second, usually with his hand under the covers.  The rest of the time, he wondered what this could mean.
“OK, OK, drop dead gorgeous, on your side at least,” Harry amended, chuckling.  “My point is that there aren’t many people I’d want to snuggle with afterwards.”
Harry laid in the bed, feeling a bit stunned, as he heard the shower start up.   Eventually he sat on the edge of the bed, pulling his clothes back on.  He stood, rolling his shoulders, feeling a bit achy from the bonds.
Harry couldn’t help but smile widely.  He has put a lot of work into this dinner, and he was happy it seemed to have paid off.  He had gone to a muggle market early in the day, picking up fresh produce and the best spices he could find.  He had chopped everything by hand, crushing the spices with a mortar and pestle, leaving it to simmer at a low temperature for hours.  Letting the flavours fully blend.
At the door, there was an uncomfortable moment.  Harry wanted to kiss Draco goodbye, but was afraid he’d pull away.  Despite what they’d been doing half the night, Draco could be skittish when Harry initiated things.
“Is this really necessary?  You have a wand, after all,” Harry grumbled lightly, but followed the orders.  As Draco said the words of the spell and waved his wand, Harry felt his magic on his skin, sending a tingle up his arms.  “Or maybe you just have a thing for tying me up?”
Even if he hadn’t, Draco had to admit his own failure to his father.  A son, just barely an adult, wanting to prove himself.  Given this big responsibility.  Maybe he had even asked his father for it.  Harry thought back to overhearing Draco talking to Snape when he had been ejected from Slughorn’s Christmas party in their sixth year at Hogwarts.  Saying he had been chosen.  That this was his chance.  Had he said similar things to his father?
OK, they were intensely attracted to each other.  All night, Harry could only think of kissing and touching him everywhere.  Making him pant, shudder and moan.  And the thought of Draco’s long, pale hand running over his skin...
There had been times after sex, they had actually cuddled, basking in a mutual afterglow, and Harry felt relaxed enough to fall asleep.  Almost.  He had deliberately resisted it, partially because he wasn’t sure if Draco wanted it to happen, not wanting to screw things up that way.  But also to extend his time with Draco, especially in that state.  Rumpled, relaxed, happy.  So fucking gorgeous Harry wondered what they were doing together.  Feeling lucky to be in such an intimate state with him.  Naked together, sharing it all.  It was the times he felt the closest to Draco.
It was a good response, but Harry wanted even more.  He stuck out his tongue, doing long strokes over Draco, savouring his first taste of cock.  It was even better than his frequent fantasies of this moment.  The tip was wet, and Harry swirled his tongue over it.  He opened his mouth, taking it in, sucking for more.
He doubted Ron would be much help here though. Should he seek out some gay or bi men?  Charlie?  Talk it out with them?
“We have to go back for them,” Harry shouted at Hermione and Ron, turning his broomstick around.  He had said ‘them’ but there was only one man he headed straight for.
Funny how this felt strange after all they had done.  Harry had rarely been the one to kiss Draco first.  He edged closer, admiring how gorgeous Draco looked like this.
Harry stepped into the empty cell, putting the bars between himself and Draco.  He stuck his hands through the bars.
Unable to stop the smile spreading across his face, Harry stole a quick kiss.  “Go out in public together, as a couple.  Hold hands.  Talk about everything.  Go to restaurants or Quidditch matches, or drinking with our friends.”
Harry shook his head.  “I have to.”  Looking away from those beautiful eyes before he changed his mind, he shouted out firmly
Harry was stopped nearby, one foot on the ground to keep upright.  He tried not to laugh at Draco’s unsteady progress, but was glad that everyone was distracted, watching Draco and trying to keep him from falling over.  He slipped his wand down from his sleeve slightly, and did a quick wave with a soft spell.  It straightened Draco up, helping him balance better, and Harry could immediately see him grasping how to pedal and steer.
Harry was almost up against the bars now, just wanting Draco to be able to see his face, his eyes, and to know he was sincerely sorry.  “I want to say sorry for what happened earlier.  I read the signals wrong.  I’m an idiot.  I never should have-“
Trying not to chuckle, Harry passed him the rock he was about to throw.  “A good first try.  But you need to look for flat stones about the size of your palm, like this.  Find a few, and then I’ll show you how to throw them.”
"That's my wand. I dropped it!" He exclaimed. Diggory reached out and handed it over with an eyebrow raised. Harry grabbed it from him but the wizard didn't let go immediately. He looked Harry directly in the eyes.
Ron was munching on one of their Never-Ending Cotton Candy sticks which a man had guaranteed would last all game. Hermione had already learned the name, age and skill set of every player that was planning on touching a broom via a booklet purchased at the information booth. Harry was just soaking up the culture.
"What the bloody hell was all that?" Dean blurted out. He was leaning against a tree, sitting away from everyone.
He was so excited for school that he packed his trunk as soon as he got home along with Ron and Hermione. They brought them downstairs to set them next to the door.
"Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Today's the day. Come on, it's Quidditch day get up!!" A loud voice bellowed, interrupting his cozy dreamland. Harry's eyes shot open as the words being shouted through the room caught up with his brain.
"Watch yourself, there!" He grumbled through the clothes. Harry laughed out an apology and jumped the last few steps.
Harry had a million questions burning through his mind. Until now, he had never seen Voldemort's mark. He knew almost nothing about death eaters. He remembered his very first conversation with Hagrid. That same feeling of disbelief and confusion had overcome his brain.
"Good, really good. So much better than it ever was at Privet Drive. Sirius is an Auror for the Ministry. He loves the job. It was hard at first, since he's been gone so long but he's adjusted to work well. He's dating a muggle right now. She owns the coffee shop down the street. Her name is Alma. She's pretty sweet but she knows nothing about the magic world. We've also been catching up on all the Wizarding World's news and sports since both of us were kind of isolated. The house already came with Kreacher, the house elf, who was foul but he's getting better now. It's been a bit lonely here by myself though. I mostly just spend time in the gym we put in on the second floor." Harry explained. Overall life had been going pretty well for Harry and Sirius.
"Ginny? Harry? That you??" They heard a voice call. Harry dropped Ginny's hand at the sound of his best friend's voice. She looked at him confused but instead of explaining he ran in the direction of Ron's voice. Ginny followed. He broke through the edge of the forest and onto the path. His friends all stood together, pale and shaking.
"Um, hello? You're all in big trouble. That means no laughing or fun of any kind." Sirius interrupted. He had a stern look on his face but Harry knew he was joking. He had that twinkle in his eyes that he would always get when playing pranks.
Harry told himself he would make things right with Ginny before they left but as time slipped by, it started to fade to the back of Harry's mind. It didn't help that she avoided him at every turn, even going so far as to go back home with Mrs. Weasley for the last week of summer. Out of sight, out of mind, Harry had enough to worry about.
"Oh, just to warn you kids, there have been a few threats of Death Eater attacks on the Cup so I arranged to have my old friend Kingsley accompany us to the game. He'll be staying in his own tent, in the site right next to ours so he can help me keep an eye on the three of you." Sirius said. Harry knew the only threats were the ones he had dreamed up but he was glad his Godfather was taking them seriously.
Harry looked down the table to Ginny. She was staring sadly at Hermione. Maybe she wanted to be the one cuddled up to Harry. Though it seemed intimate Harry, Ron and Hermione were just close friends. He could understand why it may seem differently. They had all grown up isolated and now that they had found total acceptance in one another, the three were close.
"I mean I get the general idea of the game. I just needed a more in depth understanding of it and the book wasn't expensive." She responded. Ron had broken into a fit of laughter. When he caught sight of her death glare his mouth closed almost immediately.
That seemed to catch Draco’s attention, his head tilted slightly to the side as he looked back at Harry.  “I don’t know half of those words,’ he admitted.
The carriages swayed and creaked in the wind but they did their job. They wheeled the returning students to the castle in which they were spending their school year. The gargoyles greeted them excitedly as they filed up the steps to the large double doors. They were already open and students were pouring in to escape the rain. A few of the sixth years stuck behind them were trying to use umbrella spells to no avail. Harry and Ron pushed ahead while Hermione followed in their wake.
Winky came around with drinks and treats for everyone before disappearing back behind the door. Ludo Bagman's voice echoed through the stands.
Fred and George led the way through the station to the barrier to Platform 9 3/4. They went first, Hermione followed behind. Harry and Ron ran together.
"You tell no one about this. I mean it, no one." He hissed. He still had a hand gripping the hair on the back of his head. Harry grabbed his wrists tightly and easily removed them from his head. He was confused about all this too but he hadn't felt the need to threaten the other boy until now.
A green light burst from where he stood and rose into the air. He thought maybe it was another giant leprechaun but he soon realized he was mistaken. A glittering green skull with a giant snake hung ominously in the air above them. The shadow that had stood below was gone.
"Threats? Who would be stupid enough to plan an attack when the entire Ministry will be there?" Hermione asked. He wondered if she had heard any of the conversation from last night. If she had she would already know.
The leprechauns had formed the words "HA HA HA" in the air. This upset the Veela who got up and started to dance again. Harry put his fingers in his ears to avoid being put under their spell but not even seconds later Hermione was yanking one back out.
"Tonight in Dungeon number 006 the fourth years are having a welcome back party,  round half past ten. It's Hogwarts tradition for all Fourth years to be there. Will we see the Gryffindors?" He asked. Harry swallowed his bite of biscuit and looked to his friends. Hermione has a disapproving scowl but the boys had a mischievous glint in their eyes.
"Good, good. I went to the cup with my godfather. It was a historic match really. I'll see you around then." He replied quickly scurrying away. When he got to his compartment he quickly slammed the door behind him. The noise spooked Hermione who looked up from her book sternly.
Harry was stomping up the last set of steps when he saw a familiar blonde head. His stomach dropped and he let out a small groan. The boy with the slicked back hair in front of him turned around. Unfortunately, the adults and older teens had fallen behind, leaving just Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny to deal with the pain in the ass from Slytherin house.
"See something interesting, Potter?" Draco drawled behind him. Harry finally turned around to face him. He was leaning against the door, probably trying to put as much distance between them as he could. Harry couldn't help but stare at his lips. They were so pink compared to his pale skin. He couldn't tell if it was his state of drunkenness or how attractive Draco looked in this lighting but his face was suddenly feeling quite hot. Draco raised an eyebrow, questioning the silence that had fallen. Harry was sure he was expecting some witty reply but his brain was on a completely different track.
After the game had concluded, they stayed in their booth for awhile celebrating the win. Ludo Bagman had come by to hand over their winnings. The twins won the most and were ecstatic. Even Arthur had to give them props.
"Honestly Hermione, why do you bother? He's a nasty git." Fred said chuckling. George joined in. They grabbed plates from the counter. Ron came in after them and got two plates for himself.
"Damn them!" He shouted before Disapparating in the night. The pop scared Ginny who jumped closer to Harry. Their arms brushed against each other.
"Cho Chang in the hall. I dropped everything." He explained. Hermione snorted. Harry slouched into his seat, feeling embarrassed.
Harry didn't bring much for their one night stay. He had barely unpacked too. Gathering his belongings took about five minutes. Once he was done he was directed to wait outside with Kingsley. One by one the other's joined him. Charlie and Bill got the tents put away when everyone was out. They were set. All of them ready to leave the Quidditch World Cup.
"Somebody keep time for them. In the mean time let's pass this bottle round again!" Johnathan yelled. Harry wasn't sure if he could take much more. He looked across the circle and saw that Malfoy seemed just as drunk. He was leaning heavily on a Slytherin girl sitting in a chair behind him. She didn't seem to mind though. She was lightly scrubbing her fingers through his hair. He passed the bottle to her and she chugged a few gulps before passing it along.
"Come here and give me a kiss, the both of you and stop pestering me." She snapped. They shuffled in for hugs and then turned for the train as well. Harry and Hermione stood by awkwardly while Ron got smothered with love from Mrs. Weasley.
"What's a celebration without some magical fireworks?" He asked back. The boys started down the stairs even more excited than before. They were out of sight now and almost to the bottom. Anticipation and excitement built in Harry's chest like a bomb ready to explode. He imagined this is what normal teenagers felt like when sneaking around with their friends. He thought back to when he was forced into primary school with his cousin Dudley. He sat alone everyday. He was tormented everyday. He didn't want to trust this new feeling of kinship but damn did it feel good to have friends.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry son it just seems so amusing to talk girls now when our usual talks consist of life or death material. I'll tell you your father's technique and how he got your mum." Sirius said regaining control.
"We were about to look for Harry's wand. We think he dropped it in the wood when we ran from the camp." Seamus interjected. Harry understood the secret message he was giving all of them. Nobody could know about the fireworks being them, not after what had happened.
Draco pulled away again, snapping Harry back to reality. This was the boy who had called one of his best friend's a mudblood. This was the boy who regularly insulted his other best friend's family. This boy believed in the superiority of purebloods. He felt disgusted with himself and with Draco too.
"I'll miss you kid. It'll be lonely in that big house. I won't be offended if you want to stay at school over the holidays. This year will be unforgettable for you. Write me, especially if you have any more of those dreams. I'll send you care packages every few weeks." He explained. Harry felt his eyes start to sting and closed them tight. Saying goodbye to his new found family was harder than he'd anticipated.
"That's alright, I'll be right there." He responded. He looked back to Sirius as Hermione left. He wanted to talk more about what his Godfather had said but with Hermione waiting it seemed best to end their conversation there.
"Right, thank you Winky and that he is." He said in response. The house elf beamed and bowed herself out of the room. Hermione gazed after her.
"I'll accompany you." Arthur responded. He put an arm around Ron and Hermione and gently pushed them in the direction of the camp. His entire head was a shade of red that Harry thought probably wasn't healthy. He looked up at his own guardian and realized Sirius was just as angry. He wasn't red in the face but a wrinkle had appeared above his brow that Harry was concerned might now be permanent. They were silent as they marched back to camp.
"There's too many witches and wizards in the area for them to track us." Fred responded. They practiced the spell for a short moment and then they were off. They marched out one by one into the field ready to carry out their mission. Harry could feel every cell in his body coming alive. He saw Seamus stop at the front and came to a stop himself.
"I had a nightmare about Voldemort." He told him. Sirius furrowed his brow. Then he got up and went to his desk in the corner. He pulled out a quill, ink and a notepad. There was a small end table to Harry's right. He set the items on the table's wood top.
The forest that they were hiking through was dense and beautiful. The light barely shone through the canopy of leaves, casting a greenish light on the tree trunks around them. They saw a few bunnies on their hike, as well as a herd of deer and even a skunk that sent Ron running into the woods for fear of being sprayed. Hermione spotted a few bowtruckles that Ron insisted were only stick bugs. About an hour into their hike Ron started to complain loudly about the amount of walking being done. Harry admitted the hike was starting to wear on him too.
"There was an old man... and he was eavesdropping. They were in a big mansion. Voldemort, Wormtail and another man were talking... About the Cup. They were saying something bad was going to happen at the Quidditch World Cup. They mentioned a woman too from the Ministry. They said she was dead. Then they killed the old man too." Harry explained as he wrote. He tried to remember what the man looked like but nothing significant came to mind. He remembered brown hair, a long flicking tongue like a snake. He wrote that down too.
The sorting went by quickly after that. Little Colin Creevey's brother got sorted into Gryffindor as well. Now there would be two of them following Harry around and bothering him. He impatiently awaited the end of the sorting. When the final name was called and the first years finally sorted, Harry and Ron snatched up their forks.
"Alright, everybody up the hill. Let's go, move it people." Ron shouted as he started to race Harry to the top. Soon all of them were sprinting up the hill, except the adults, and Hermione of course. When they reached the top, the teens were surprised to find nothing but rolling hills for miles. The only item in sight was a dirty, rotting left boot. They all crowded around the boot waiting for the adults to tell them if this was indeed what a portkey looked like.
"You should write it down. That way we can remember it and if it's something very serious, we can inform Dumbledore." He explained handing Harry both the pad and the quill. Harry did his best to write it down. He was starting to lose details already. He closed his eyes and tried hard to think. An old face swam to the forefront of his mind.
"Drink up! I went through a load of trouble to smuggle this in here. I've got plenty of bottles too." Johnathan bragged watching the bottle get passed their way. Harry took a generous swig and immediately regretted it. He managed to swallow but immediately started coughing as it went down. He could feel the drink burn all the way down to his stomach. He passed it to Ron who was laughing at his coughing fit.
"Good morning! Bagels are waiting on top of the stove. Eat quickly and then get packed up. We have to get going soon if we want to make it to the Portkey on time." Sirius called out. Harry looked toward the Stove to see him spreading cream cheese on a bagel of his own. He and Ron rushed over and split the last of them between each other. Harry sat next to Hermione and leaned her book forward a little bit.
"Everyone at the Ministry calls him Mad-Eye Moody. He's looking right at you." Ron whispered. Harry elbowed him in response. Harry looked down at the table breaking the intense eye contact between the two. He wanted to vomit. Something about the stare made him uneasy.
His door opened and closed again quickly startling him and Hedwig both. The light was still off but Harry could already tell who was standing at his door.
"What? What in the hell are you kids doing out here in the woods? It's not safe." He shouted almost panicked.
"So!" Dumbledore said smiling warmly. "Now that we have enjoyed our feast. I must once more ask for your attention as I make a few announcements concerning the upcoming year."
"We should probably split up. We can go find our group. You three could retrace Harry and I's steps back to camp." Ginny suggested making gestures between them all.
"It's good to see you again, Ron, Hermione!" Sirius said grabbing them each into a quick hug. He grabbed their suitcases and picked them up. He smiled at a neighbor and then came inside. Since they removed the hiding spell from the house, it had become a lot easier for visitors to find them. They weren't quite as worried about hiding anymore.
He paced the cell, thoughts coming faster now.  What were Ron and Hermione doing now?  Dobby and Luna?  Had they notified the Order of the Phoenix?  Were they trying to find him even now?  Could they trace him?  Would Dobby be able to help him escape here like at the Manor?  Wards didn’t seem to work against house elves.  The Malfoys had seemed so shocked by Dobby’s defiance that perhaps they hadn’t warded this castle against them?
Harry’s heart was thumping by the time the door locked behind them.  Shut in their own private room.  He kissed Draco, just needing him.  Draco returned the kiss, just as eagerly.  They stripped, helping each other, working their own clothes off, between heated kisses.
They found a rhythm, slowly getting faster and faster.  Harry rocked up into each thrust, finding the perfect angle, moaning out Draco’s name.  Feeling so connected, so good.  At a certain point, Draco couldn’t hold back, moving faster.  Harry stroked his own cock, lube everywhere, just needed a bit more to get over the edge.
He heard a mumbled spell, and the blindfold was gone.  He blinked at the sudden brightness and then felt it, Draco licking the tip., circling it.  He looked down, their gazes catching and holding as Draco opened his mouth, taking Harry in.
That got him a long look, Draco wondering if Harry meant it.  Evidently his act was good enough.  “Put your hands through the bars.”
Shifting upwards on the bed, Harry put a finger under Draco’s jaw to tilt his head upwards.  He lowered his mouth, kissing and sucking up the juice.
Nodding, Harry stepped closer.  “Um, yeah.  I’ve been working on a few wandless spells.  To be safer at work, you know...”  As an auror, you could drop your wand or be disarmed in a fight, and it was useful to be able to make a quick getaway.
“Yeah, I guess it was,” Harry chuckled lightly, and ran a hand through his hair.  Why was he saying so much?  Just pure boredom?
Draco was wearing black jeans that made his legs look endless and his ass amazing, but Harry had only been able to watch, not touch, when he was lying on his back.  Draco crawled over him, looking absolutely delicious, his eyes dark and intense.
Harry was grateful that Draco had not commented on what had happened. Had just helped him as he needed it.  Left Harry with as much pride as he could.
“Oh really?” Harry said, feeling a bit amused, but also irritated.  It was their private business, after all.
“I wasn’t acting, Draco.  At the castle,” Harry said, fumbling for the right words.  “We were spending all that time together, and you were being fairly kind to me...”
These past few days had shown Harry other sides to Draco. He had not been sneering, no sharp barbs. They had actually had conversations and even laughed together a few times. Skipped rocks together, for fuck’s sake. Was he starting to see Harry as a friend? After all these months of being around Voldemort and the Deatheaters, was he enjoying being away from all that? With someone his own age, even if it was his old school rival?
Harry went along with it all, just trying to figure it out what Draco had in mind.  Walked with him through the park, admiring a fountain and many wild birds.  Chatted with him over a delicious meal at a tiny Italian restaurant.  Strolled back to their lodgings as the stars started appearing in the mild night.
Tempted, Harry had to pull away.  “No, not until you can call me by my first name and I know you are happier.”  He stood up, tugging Draco along with him.
Harry closed his eyes, excitement curling through him, as Draco’s face drew nearer.  He wanted this so badly.  He could feel the warm breaths against his mouth.  Draco was so close.
Draco scoffed.  “Well, there are some amusements.  Watching you just now running around like a headless chicken, for example.”
From what Draco had said, Harry was pretty sure Draco was alone too.  No family members or other Deatheaters.  Some house elves doing the chores, under his command.
-Yes, Harry is being a bit of an idiot here.  But he’s young & not that experienced with relationships...  Here’s hoping he smartens up.
Shrugging a shoulder, Draco turned his face to look out to the high hedges that surrounded the grounds.  “Like it or not, we are both stuck here for the time being.”
Bellatrix peered at him closely, her dark, beady eyes lingering on the swollen areas disfiguring his face.  Harry almost felt a tinge of hope, but then the snatcher’s grubby hand pushed his hair back from his forehead to show his scar.
They had a long bath, and then a nap.  Harry woke up first, and just laid with Draco in his arms, stroking over his hair, or over his back.  Feeling happy and relaxed.
“You look great.  Let’s go,” Draco said, stepping back and grabbing Harry’s hand, rushing him out of the room and down the stairs.  Mrs. Owens waved to them as they passed her in the main floor.  Harry could see her ‘Awww, aren’t they a cute couple’ expression, and felt a stab of unease.
Harry stood, and slowly walked closer to Draco.  His heart was pounding in his chest, but he had to do this.  He stopped behind Draco, and laid a hand on his shoulder lightly.
The thought had him burrowing his face into his pillow, trying not to get emotional.  To lose it.  Feeling so sad and lonely.  This was just a sham.  He would make an excuse tomorrow and go back home.  Get away.  He couldn’t take another day of this farce.
He had started a seduction at the castle.  But both of them had been caught up in it.  Captivated.  He wanted to continue it now, let them both get to know each other.  Date, like a normal couple.  He didn’t want to rush this, finally having the time to give a deeper relationship a chance.
Harry scoffed.  “Hardly.  This is far too small to put a dent in that melon.  But it’s perfect for this.”  With that, he flicked his arm out towards the pond, and the rock skipped along the surface three times before disappearing into the water.  “Hmmmm.  Not too bad considering I haven’t done that for years.”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “No.”  He tried to look irritated, but Harry could see the corner of his mouth twitching, trying not to laugh.
Draco pulled back, his heavy-lidded eyes dark, his lips a little swollen and wet.  Deliciously aroused-looking, in a way that made things tighten even more low in Harry’s body.
He glanced over at Draco. He was lying on his side, hands tucked under his cheek, still napping. He looked younger like this, and it was a reminder that they were both just barely adults. Draco was a few inches taller than Harry now, slim and athletic in his build. His face had slimmed down, showing his cheekbones a bit more, and his jaw a little less pointy. He was looking more and more like Lucius by the day.
Instead, Draco stepped over Harry, a foot beside each of his hips, and lowered himself right down to straddle him.  Harry could feel his heart rate getting faster, as Draco leaned forward, looking right into Harry’s eyes.  “Hmmmm.... what should I do?” he said softly, and then he glanced down at Harry’s lips.
“Let me go.  Give me a fighting chance.  Already it is one of the most powerful wizards in the world against me, a drop-out who is barely seventeen,” Harry continued.  “Please, Draco.”
It really hit him when they reached their destination.  A charming cottage at the end of a tree-lined lane, with a hilly park beyond.  Draco rushed them into the Bed and Breakfast, being immediately greeted by Mrs. Owens like they were old friends.  She soon had they assigned to her best couples’ room, with a view of the park.
For all the times they had been in each other’s beds, they had never slept the night together.  Harry had never done it with anyone.  And to do it like this, fully dressed in pyjamas, not even touching the other person, was not how he had ever imagined it.
“It’s too nice a day to stay inside,” Draco said quickly, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes. He took out a blanket and started spreading it out, and Harry got over his shock to help him.
Scoffing, Harry reached over to his jeans to pull out his wand.  “You don’t exactly look like someone who knows how to cook.”
“But I do look like someone who can order delicious food from a deli, right?” Draco said, sitting up and plucking the wand from Harry’s hand.
With a bit of a shrug, Draco stood and ambled across the large lawn.  Harry followed him, a bit surprised that he had tucked his wand away and seemed unconcerned about Harry attacking him.  Was this trust, or did he just doubt Harry would even try?
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry said to his retreating back, following him back to the castle.  “I shouldn’t have done that, Draco.”
Draco turned his head to look at Harry, his grey eyes seeming enormous in his pale face, shiny with unshed tears.  “I want to... but I can’t.”
“It’s never felt like that with anyone else.  You do a scorgify spell, and it sends sparks along my skin,” Harry said, trying to make a gesture.  His bound hands didn’t help in that.
“Mmmm kinky,” Harry said softly as he passed Draco.  He heard him gasp, so he knew he had heard it.  Or maybe he had, but it had been too soft for Draco to be sure what he said.  That was what Harry had wanted.
Harry sighed.  “Well, might as well put my notoriety to some good use.  Would you just take the job, Draco?”
Draco gave him an exasperated glance.  “We have dinner reservations.  Quick, get your clothes ready while I jump in the shower.  We can’t be late!”  He rushed off, slamming the door behind him.
Kissing along his jaw, Harry laughed too, feeling happy.  “That part is incredible too.  But I think that part is easier to get with other people.  This part is just with you.”
He watched as Draco dug heartily into his own plate of food. It was nice to eat with someone, and he wondered if Draco felt it too. He’d been stuck in this castle just as long.
“Taken you to the flashiest restaurants, got you a bit drunk, flirted with you shamelessly,” Harry drawled, trying to lighten the mood.
He had used that name several times during this trip, but this was the first time it had seemed natural.  It hit Harry hard, and he moved closer.
He barely had his clothes out, running over them with a spell to de-wrinkle them, when Draco rushed out, a towel wrapped around his waist.
”Woah,” Draco said, turning quickly, his arms out for his own balance.  But his stance was tense, his eyes wary, and he checked Harry quickly.
Draco tutted at the wine dotted all over both of them.  “Can’t take you anywhere,” he murmured, and grabbed Harry’s hand, yanking him into the bathroom.  “We better let these soak in some cold water right away.”
Harry grabbed his wand back, and dropped it on his jeans.  “Are you done now?”  It was a bit disturbing seeing someone using his wand so easily.  In many ways, it was like an extension of himself.  A part of his magic.
It was almost a relief to have the cell door swing closed behind him, and to feel the tingle of Draco’s magic across his skin when the wrist bindings disappeared.  Harry went to his bed, lying on his side turned away from Draco, and only heard him walking away.  Leaving him alone.
Draco moved the pillows, and sat up beside Harry.  “I was hoping this weekend would prove that I’m over the past.  No tying you up.  Calling you Harry.  All the rest.”
Two days later, Draco was at the Ministry, sitting on the edge of the fountain in the main hall.  He stood up as Harry was walking towards the floos, his normal route after his shifts.
“Wake up, lazy bones,” a soft voice near him cajoled. Harry opened his eyes to find that Draco was awake now, leaning on one elbow as he peered down at Harry.
“Well, it depends a bit on you, Potter. I can lock you up in your cell right away, since you’ve had time outdoors as you so eloquently demanded.”
“My manager is like that too.  He gives zero fucks that I’m Harry Potter.  Just sends me on tough assignments like any other new auror,” Harry said, taking another sip of wine.  It was going down very easily.
Draco shrugged.  “There were times I wished I could have been left alone like that.  My parents were always watching me, training me how to behave, sending me to lessons.”
“Some things concerned me.  Made me wonder if I was more into this than you were,” Harry confessed, the words coming out in a rush.
“It had its moments,” Harry agreed, and laid down on the blanket. “Oh, I’m so full. Is this part of your evil plan, making me almost sick on good food that I’m too lethargic to move?”
Was this Draco’s version of that?  Trying to give Harry what he asked for?  Acting like a couple in public?
Draco chuckled.  He pushed a tray of food through the gap at the base of the door.  Harry could sense a stasis charm over it, keeping things at the correct temperature.  He felt a pang of hunger now that his head didn’t ache as much.
It was longer, and farther than they had ever gone before.  Harry loved it, but he was getting close to the edge.  “Um, Draco,” he panted, between kisses.
“Pick a restaurant you want to try.  Owl me the time and date,” Harry said, pushing Draco out the door before he gave into temptation and took him up to his bedroom.
Even though he was pretty full, Harry couldn’t resist taking a generous helping. He sighed with the first bite. “This brings back memories of those days.”
Harry gathered his courage.  “Um, can I kiss you?  I promise I’ll stop whenever you want, and then you can tie me up...”
Rolling his eyes, Ron let out a scoff.  “The whole world knows.  Your first dates were covered by all the papers.  But they haven’t reported much for a while.  Is it still going on?”
“Let’s go inside now,” Draco said, taking Harry’s empty glass and setting it on a table.  He guided him through a doorway, and staff led them to a table near a large window, elegantly set up with a white tablecloth, fine china and silverware.  Candles flickered on all the tables.  The room was able three quarters full.  Harry thought it was likely packed in the summer months, when more tourists were in London.
The next few days were awful.  Harry was scheduled for five night shifts in a row, and it was completely opposite to Draco’s work.  He got home, exhausted usually, had a quick shower and crashed.  Barely finding the energy to eat a quick sandwich.
“What happened at the Manor?  It was such a blur,” Harry said, lifting a hand to rub over the tender spot on the back of his head.  He wouldn’t be surprised if he had a little memory loss from the concussion.
“Come on.  I’m curious.  Hermione was raised as a muggle too, and Ron… well, you know things weren’t typical at his house…”
“Thanks,” Harry said, and meant it.  Although strangers had sometimes shouted unkind things at him, his friends and co-workers had seemed unfazed when articles about dating Draco had first appeared.  It relieved him of the need to come out more directly with them, in a way.  It wasn’t treated as a big deal by most people.
Harry awoke to a dim room.  Sunlight was creeping around the thick curtains, but it felt early still. The inn was still and quiet.  No one walking in the hallways, whispering to each other.  No distant sounds from the kitchen.
There was a sliding sound, and Harry was instantly awake.  It was Draco again, pushing a tray beneath his door.
Scenario after scenario had played in Harry’s head until he fell into an exhausted sleep, only to have them interrupt his dreams.
But Draco moved away, kissing over Harry’s hip bone.  Leisurely licking, kissing and sucking at the skin there, before moving to a new area.  Teasing.  Making Harry pant and  arch up off the bed.
Harry couldn’t respond, of course.  He could only watch as Draco covered him with a blanket, tucking it snugly around him, and then leaving the room.
-A/N:  This is the first thing I’ve posted since the pandemic started, so I’m feeling a bit rusty!  It feels good to be writing again.
Draco just smirked at him.  “Come on.  You’ve said all along that I need to learn to trust you, right, Potter?”
By the time Draco settled between his legs, Harry was fully aroused again.  He passed Draco the lube.  “Prep me?”
Harry tried to relax, keep his breathing slow and steady.  Being unable to move was making this difficult, as it seemed to trigger his fight or flight reaction.  His heart was pounding and he could feel sweat beading on his forehead.
He pushed off, wobbling a fair bit until he got his balance, pedalling and trying not to run into anything.  Luckily, it was pretty empty of people where they were.  After a minute or two, he was slowly biking back and forth near Draco, letting him learn by watching.  From all the things they had tried at the castle, Harry had found that was how Draco learned best.
Opening the door, Draco sent Harry outside once his bonds were off, and closed the door.  When he came out with his own tray of food, Harry was already sitting below a tree.  It was flowering, pink petals occasionally drifting down to scatter in the grass below.
In the end, he could get away, save himself, help others.  Hopefully kill Voldemort.  Draco’s feelings may be hurt, his pride stung, but those were things he would recover from.  There was no doubt he had to do this.
Of course, Draco seemed to be bringing him his meals, likely three times a day.   Could he work on Draco?  Get him to let him go somehow?  Lure him close and grab his wand?  Were there keys for the door or was it unlocked with a spell?
Sighing, Harry ate his breakfast.  Draco was at least being attentive, seeing that he needed his clothes cleaned.  He was never late with the meals either, and the food was tasty.  Harry was a prisoner.  It could have just been bread and water.
Draco shifted to being on his back, his hands keeping Harry near, rolling on top on him, taking his weight and liking it.  His legs spread, letting Harry settle between them, and even through all the material between them, they were rocking together.  Kissing the whole time.
If he couldn’t physically attack Draco, could he convince him instead?  Work on his good side?  Did he have a good side?  Was that why he hadn’t identified Harry to his family?
The server came by just then with their main course, and Draco released his hand, leaning back to give her room to set down the hot plates.  Harry dug in eagerly,  savouring the tender chicken, mushrooms cooked in red wine and herbs, and creamy potatoes.  A rich chocolate cake with raspberry sauce finished off the meal.
He reached downwards, the only warning Harry got before that warm, slick hand was wrapped around his erection.  It felt amazing.  Perfect.  But even better when he started moving it.
Draco looked skeptical, so with a sigh, Harry picked up the receiver on the phone and dialled the front desk.  He told one of the staff about the late check out and hung up.  “There.  As much time as we want.”
“Says the man who was fighting with me only a few days ago.  Saying no more kinky stuff,” Draco whispered back.  He took a half-step away from Harry, still dancing, but not pressed up together.
It didn’t take long.  It had probably been a week, maybe longer, since he had taken some alone time from Ron and Hermione.  He would find a quiet place in some bushes, cast privacy wards, and take care of himself.  A bit of pleasure, some stress relief.
Again and again, Draco’s face flashed through his mind.  That frozen, hurt expression.  The way his eyes seemed to dim, his posture slump.
Harry had felt how Draco had been kissing him just now, and knew as young men, it wouldn’t take much to go for a third round.  Maybe even end up sleeping together, staying the night.
Draco sighed, closing his book.  “So, you want to know what wizard families with money are like?  Kids go to school, the parents work, same as you.”
This could be something.  Draco already seemed to be letting down his guard around Harry, acting more like friends.  What if Harry tried for more?  Could he get Draco’s trust?  Get him to care for Harry?  Convince him to let him go, or just get him to relax enough inside the castle so Harry could grab a wand?
Harry slept very soundly that night, not waking until Draco was shoving his breakfast tray below the door.  He had taken the last of the headache potion, knowing he needed his rest.  He needed to be stronger, be able to escape if he saw an opportunity.  Draco had a fairly secure system going, but he couldn’t be on guard every second.  And the more Harry could do to assist that the better.
Ron shrugged.  “Well, feel free to talk about anything.  Ever since Charlie came out to the family a few years ago, I’m used to hearing about things like that.”
He closed his eyes, feeling exhausted even though he had hardly done anything physical today. A wave of hopelessness washed over him, almost like he was still wearing that foul locket, the horcrux.
Harry hugged him.  “No, no, your heart was in the right place.  I really liked the idea of getting away with you for a weekend.  Having lots of time together.  The food tour was really fun.”
Ron and Hermione tossed him a basilisk fang, and Harry stabbed it into the diadem.  They tossed it back into the burning Room of Requirement, hearing the screams from that part of Voldemort’s soul scream as it died.
Draco sighed, looking up towards the ceiling, considering it.  “The idea of designing healing potions is appealing.  She seems very experienced.”
A few minutes more about how to brake, and general safety, and the staff stepped back.  Draco was already setting off along the wide pedestrian pathway, and Harry pedalled fast to catch up.
This felt so right, so natural.  Kissing, touching.  Being naked together in the large bed.  Nothing held back.  The lube came in handy rather quickly, sliding against each other in a way that quickly spiralled out of control.  It had been too long since they’d been together to go slow.
Finally, Draco arrived, looking great in a lavender dress shirt and charcoal grey trousers.  Harry swept him down to the kitchen, giving him an IPA to sip as he finished the meal.  Draco seemed bemused, watching him chopping up cilantro and parsley by hand.
Tentatively, he reached out a hand to lay of Draco’s shoulder.  The other man shuddered under his touch.
Draco jumped slightly at his touch, his breath catching, but after a moment he seemed to calm down.  He turned towards Harry, his eyes downcast.
“No,” Harry snapped, and had to calm down a surge of emotions from the memories.  “My cousin was a bully, so other kids stayed away from me.  Didn’t want to make him mad.”
Wrapping his long legs around Harry, Draco reached for the lube, flipping the cap and pouring a generous amount in his palm.  “Give me your hand,” he said, his voice rough.
Harry walked around the Room of Requirement, the buzzing hiss of the horcrux in his ears, in his scar.  He could feel that it was close.
Harry grinned at the idea of a wizarding daycare, full of toddlers playing with toys like that.  “And when you got older?  Like 8 or 9 years old?  Did you play sports or games with your friends?”
It was a first step, and Harry happily launched into explaining each thing, with Draco asking lots of questions.  It was clear Draco had never taken Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, as Harry found he had to explain things like electricity.  It wasn’t easy.
Draco scoffed.  “As that traitorous house elf made his little speech to Bellatrix, we snuck around behind you.  I tackled you right as the rest apparated,” he said with pride.  “My father grabbed both of us and moved us here.”
The pond was in an area that sloped down gradually from the smooth lawn, and was surrounded by bushes and slim trees.  Looking through the foliage, he could see the glint of water.  As they stepped into the copse, he could see it was a fairly good size.  The shadows from the surrounding greenery didn’t cover the whole smooth surface of the water, and the spring sunshine allowed him to see the jade green tint of the water.
The shower was maybe a bit too hot, but Harry didn’t care.  He had been shaking, feeling a bit cold, when he had floo’d home.  And if his face was a bit wet, it was just from the shower, right?
But Draco was taking his hand, leading him back in.  The servers had been busy, clearing away a few tables to make some space.  A singer had joined the pianist, crooning out some old tunes Harry vaguely remembered from his childhood.
“Yes, of course,” Draco snapped back, looking down his nose at Harry.  “But you don’t exactly see them up close like that.”
When he finally kissed the tip, Harry almost came in relief.  But Draco sensed it, and kept teasing him.  Pulling away when Harry got close to the edge, just leaving his still hand, and then resuming exploring Harry with little licks and kisses.
After a lot of touching, exploration and kissing, Harry had his hands on Draco’s ass as they shamelessly ground together.
How long had he been away, leaving Harry to dwell on his thoughts?  He felt stiff from not moving, so it must be at least an hour, maybe two.
Draco was just as competitive though, and leaped at Harry, arms spread wide, tackling him from behind. They both landed hard, the thick grass the only thing that prevented bones from breaking. It still knocked the breath out of both of them, and left them a bit stunned.
The kisses were light, exploring Draco’s lips and then going along his jaw, his neck. Nuzzling in and inhaling deep.  Tasting his skin.  Feeling Draco squirm at having his earlobe nibbled.
Draco chuckled lightly, no doubt noticing that Harry’s voice had been a bit rough.  He gently bit Harry’s earlobe, flicking his tongue over the trapped skin.  Savouring Harry’s gasp.  “Hmmmm.... gags, ropes, paddles, whips.  All sorts of naughty things.  Would you let me try them on you?”
Hearing his name now, like this, was almost too much.  Harry moaned, shifting off to the side with his lower body, turning his head to rest it against Draco’s chest.  Trying to catch his breath, to keep his head from spinning.  Too much.  Feeling too much at once.
Closing his eyes, Harry tried to bring up his last memories.  Malfoy Manor.  The Snatchers.  Fighting over the wands with Draco.
But there was a world outside the high hedge of this castle, and Harry had to use any means to return to it.  The sooner the better.  The longer he stayed, the deeper they would both get pulled into this.  This, this... whatever it was.  Harry knew he could easily lose himself in it.  Dive deep and not come up for air for a year or two.
Draco stood and shook it.  “Thank you for the interview, Ms. Redd.  I hope to get an owl from you soon.”
Although this wasn’t really Harry’s kink, the fact that Draco had put the items out, had planned this all out, was incredibly hot.  He nodded, climbing on to the centre of the bed.
Harry swallowed hard, clearly feeling uncomfortable. A bit nervous.  “Um, at the castle, what happened... um, between us...”
Draco put the blindfold on him first, so snugly that no light bled around the edges.  His hands tilted Harry’s head up for a deep kiss, before urging him to lie back against the pillows.  The rope was made out of a smooth material, maybe even silk.  It wrapped tightly around Harry’s wrists, holding them snugly, but not digging in or irritating his skin.  Draco attached the ropes to the bedposts, leaving his lower body free.
Draco was blinking hard, his eyes suspiciously shiny.  “I’m the lucky one.  I’ve made so many bad choices in my life.  I don’t deserve this.”
This was new, and Harry loved it.  He hugged Draco back, his head tucked against the taller man’s neck.  He always smelled so good.
They went outside afterwards, the sky fully dark and the lights of the city reflecting on the water.  The fresh air helped clear his head, a bit fuzzy from several glasses of wine.
“You are giving me potions and saying you are sorry.  Maybe you could just let me out of here if you feel so bad,” Harry said, with dry humour.
Maybe it was just being together a longer while?  Being adults with busier schedules?  Maybe sex would be like this sometimes, a bit more rushed or one-sided, just due to lack of time.
Reaching out, Harry tipped Draco’s chin up so their eyes met.  “I did work at getting you to trust me, hoping it would relax your guard and I could find a way to escape.  But when we kissed, that wasn’t part of the plan.”
Several other wands shot towards him, and he caught them with his natural seeker skill.  All the wands from the skirmish at Malfoy Manor.   He got off Draco, standing with shaking legs.
Draco was watching him closely, his expression smug and far too pleased with himself.  It reminded Harry of Draco in their Hogwarts days.
But Draco looked completely uncomfortable.  His legs were splayed out on each side of the bicycle, bearing most of his weight, instead of sitting fully on the bike seat.  His arms were straight, leaning back so his hands barely touched the handle bars.  A guy from the store was patiently trying to explain how the bicycle worked to him.  Harry had told him that Draco had never learned how to ride one.
He scrambled to his feet, pure adrenaline helping him, and ran along the imposing hedge.  It was thick and full of thorns.  Despite this, he tried to push through it, only to be zapped back again and again.  Undaunted, he kept trying, running along the hedge and trying again and again.  Searching for the tiniest gap in the defences.  Eventually, panting and exhausted, he dropped back on the bench.
Draco’s mother settled her husband down, and his aunt urged Draco to look at Harry again.  “Don’t be shy sweetie,” she cajoled with a surprisingly soft voice.  “Come over.  Now, if this isn’t who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he’ll kill us all.  We need to be absolutely sure.”
“I thought over your... request,” Draco said with a wry tone.  “I think it’s only fair to let you outside for a brief period each day.  We need to keep you healthy, after all.”
He looked amazing, dressed in a black cashmere V-neck and black jeans.  He held a bottle out with a smirk.
Draco let out a huff of frustration and started pacing again.  “She just seemed amazed at everything I did, took lots of notes, and smiled at me.  A lot.”
trays,” with a flick of his wand.  Both the empty and full trays were soon nearby, and Draco passed Harry the lunch tray.  He put the empty one on a table, for a house elf to collect later, presumably.
These weeks of dating had been good.  They had weathered the storm of paparazzi, but after the novelty wore off, they weren’t in the paper that much.  After the trials, the wizarding world really seemed to want to move on.  Harry was happy to be out of the public light more than he had been for the past ten years.
Harry shuddered at the screams and gasps of pain coming from upstairs.  Ron looked a bit crazed.  Despite this, they soon had the other people in the cellar apparated away with Dobby’s assistance.
“Next time, we will have to make it a contest,” Harry said, rubbing his hands together to get some of the mud off them.
Smirking slightly, Draco pulled out his wand and apparated them into his bedroom.  They were aroused enough to not hesitate striping each other, clothing coming off almost magically.
At the top, there was a bright, open living space, with large windows showing the busy streets below.  Draco rose from the sofa, smiling, and enfolded Harry in a hug.
Harry wasn’t holding back, loving how responsive Draco was being.  Sometimes he shied away from Harry being on top.  But all the signals were that he was just as into this.  His hands were even pushing up Harry’s top, running over his bare back.
“Surely you have noticed them flying above you?” Harry asked, a bit bewildered.  He had already made five planes that successfully flew, although not very far.  All of Draco’s had crashed like they were under a jinx.
Harry sighed, closing his eyes.  “This is completely my fault.  I thought if we dated a bit, took things slow...”
Harry felt a surge of emotions for this man, seeing him waking like that.  He shifted closer, moving in to give Draco a light kiss.  Pulling back a little, wondering if he had gone too far.  If he was taking advantage of the situation.
Harry played with him, slowly slightly like he was getting tired, letting Draco think he was about to catch him, and then turning sharply with a burst of speed. It reminded Harry a bit of his manoeuvres on the Quidditch pitch. He had been quicker there too.
He could recall thinking that those girls had been very pretty, and seeking out ways to be alone with them.  He really couldn’t remember having similar thoughts about Draco until the castle.  Seeing him lying on a blanket in the sun after they had eaten, looking relaxed.  He could remember noticing his skin, his eyes, his hair.  Feeling the urge to touch him.  It was mixed up with talking, and doing those silly things together, like skipping rocks.  Hearing Draco laughing with him, instead of at him.
“Um, well, maybe a rustic cabin in the woods with a big fireplace.  Or a modern room in a boutique hotel.  Eating out at unusual restaurants.”
“No, of course not,” Draco said, stopping and slumping down on the edge of an easy chair.  “But it’s enough, Potter.  You saved me then, you saved me at the trial, and now you are trying to get me a job?”
Harry walked down the twisty side street and found a door with the right number on it.  There was a bell pull on the side, and Harry gave it a small yank.
Draco stood up, walked a few steps and paused, facing away.  “No, of course not.  I swore the house elves to secrecy and just told him you got away.  He was furious.”
Harry wasn’t one who hid away from things though.  He straightened up, squared his shoulders, and took a deep breath before he opened the bathroom door.
Harry sighed and stared up at the clouds. Anger burned hot for a few minutes, then faded. The warm sun and full belly were very soporific, and he drifted off as well.
Wrapping his hands around the warm mug of tea, Harry sipped it as he watched Draco go.  Could he really do this?  This half-formed plan?
Harry’s heart beat faster.  Was this it?  Draco setting him free?  Acting like the doors were left unlocked somehow?  Not taking too active a part in his escape?
What else had Harry said that night?  He had questioned why Draco tied him up so much, and it led to him basically refusing to have more kinky sex with him until they had figured things out as a couple.
Harry stepped even closer.  Within kissing distance.  “Did you like it?”  He knew he liked Draco’s magic, the tingle over his skin.  A zing of power.
His hand moved into his hair, probing at the swollen lump that was still tender under his light touch.  It felt hot, pounding with its own separate heartbeat, pangs of agony splitting through his skull.
Pleasantly full,  Harry laid back against his cot.  It was a simple bed with a thin mattress, but at least it seemed clean and had a warm blanket.
By the time Harry stepped away from him, brushing the floo powder from his clothes, Draco was practically spitting fire.  “Tell me what the fuck is going on, Potter.  You aren’t leaving here until you talk to me.”
Walking through the doorway, Harry felt overwhelmed with how bright it was, and almost stumbled.  Draco caught his arm, steadying him, and guided him forward.  Maybe he took it as a sign that Harry was weak.  It was more that Harry had been in the darkness a few days, and his eyes took longer than normal to adjust to the light.
A hand went into his hair, pulling him against the bars.  Draco kissed him, hard and urgent.  Obviously just as affected.
-A/N:  Thanks for reading this story so far.  I’m still feeling a bit rusty writing after not being able to for most of the pandemic.
Sighing, Harry lowered himself, lettting his head rest against the pillow and trying to settle into a comfortable position.  “Ok, Draco.”
“Shove it, Potter.  Do you want me to yell at you here, or should we go somewhere more private?” Draco hissed, looming over Harry.
It was a jolt, seeing the contrast in his own dark, sad emotions to the sleepy, soft expression in Draco’s light blue-grey eyes. He seemed relaxed and unguarded.
“Actually, it’s in the castle. That way I don’t have to worry about you grabbing it off me like you did at the manor.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Forgive me for not packing a suitcase before you kidnapped me.”  He immediately has reverted to snapping a reply, like when they had exchanged insults at Hogwarts.
Harry thought back on their years together at Hogwarts, and the times he had seen Draco with his parents.  They both saw him off on the Hogwarts Express, with hugs and fond looks.  Draco often received generous care packages at breakfast by owl, sharing the treats with his friends.  His father was always at the Quidditch games, his head at a proud tilt as he watched his son and the whole Slytherin team whiz around the field on the brooms he had bought.  Draco worked hard on the Quidditch pitch, and in his classes, top of the class.  Except for Hermione, of course.  A fact they all loved.
Draco screwed his lips together as he pushed the lunch tray under the door.  “The food?  I thought it was pretty good.”  He picked up the breakfast tray, it’s dishes completely empty.  He gave Harry a mocking look.
The whole house smelled wonderful, and Harry had taken a long bath.  He shaved carefully, wanting his skin as smooth as possible.   He hemmed and hawed looking over the clothes in his closet, chuckling at himself.  This was getting ridiculous.
“You said you liked the feel of my magic.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt yours that strongly before,” Draco said.
But he had never expected anything like this.  He was able to dismiss the first few signs, but eventually he clued in.  Draco, being just a bit too nice, carrying his suitcase for him, opening doors.  A kiss of the cheek in greeting, and a big smile.  Cuddling together in the back of a black cab as they travelled through muggle London.
Harry turned, leaning against the wall, feeling awful at the expression on Draco’s face.  They had come too far, done too much, for Harry to ghost him now.  Leave without talking.  Maybe whatever was happening would be the end to this fragile thing they had started, too much for what they had built up.  It couldn’t withstand much of a storm.
Harry could feel Draco relax then.  “We made it.  That was close,” he said, giving Harry a genuine smile and guiding him forward.
A dozen ideas flashed through Harry’s mind, like Draco apparating them somewhere quite public and leaving Harry there.  Maybe watching from a distance until Harry was found and the spell ended, chuckling to himself the whole time.  That was the most benign scenario.
It ended quickly when Draco stepped back.  “Goodnight, Potter,” he said before sweeping out the door to apparate home.
It reminded Harry of the bounty of foods at Hogwarts feasts, and he felt a pang of longing for those younger, simpler days. When the only thing he had to worry about Draco was if he’d beat him to the snitch in the next quidditch game.
“It has about three doses.  It should last the rest of today.  I can give you another bottle tomorrow if you need it.”
Opening his eyes, Draco peered down intently at Harry, his expression hard to read.  It wasn’t that bright down here, Harry’s wandlight putting half his face in shadow.  He moved around the bars, urging Harry to stand, backing him up until he fell.
It was hard to put into words what he’d struggling to figure out himself.  “Well, I think men are more comfortable having a casual relationship.  They don’t push for it to be more serious.”
It was a good five minutes before the door opened, and a dry Draco waved Harry to step forward.  He waved his wand, his wrist binding and scorgify spells running over Harry so fast they left him gasping.  “Get downstairs.  Now.”  His tone was icy.  Haughty.
“There’s lots of room for you to have your own potions lab,” Harry said back.  He had been half joking by suggesting Draco move into the house, but Draco agreeing to it sent an excited thrill through him.  Accompanied by dozens of images of how it could be.
Harry returned the smile a bit stiffly, and turned on his side, away from Draco, and blew out the candles.  “Um, Goodnight.”
Was this what it felt to be an old, married couple?  Being together, but not really?  Didn’t sex drop off as people got over the honeymoon phase?  The novelty of it wore off?  It certainly hadn’t for him.
Harry turned on his side to face Draco, and leaned in for a kiss.  “Well, that was incredible, Draco,” he said, feeling so much for this man.
“Perfect,” Harry said, rolling Draco on to his back.  He did a slow grind against Draco, making them both pant.  Grabbing Draco’s wrists, he pinned them back against the sofa as he gave him a deep, dirty kiss.
“Says the guy who is into bondage,” Harry shot back, chuckling.  “It was mostly about when you tackled me, having your body against me, hearing your fast breathing...”
“Good point.  OK.  March 15th,” Harry conceded, a happy glow spreading through him.  This was mostly just playful banter, but the fact that Draco was talking about marriage so easily was making his head spin.
Draco pulled away then, taking a step back.  He was breathing hard, his face flushed, his eyes dark.  Harry was sure he looked pretty much the same.  Destroyed.
Pulling at his wand, he apparated to the Ministry of Magic. Pretty soon, he was getting off the elevator for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.  He marched in, and glared down at first wizard he saw.  “Get me Auror Potter.  Now!”  The young man jumped, and then scrambled into the offices.
Sighing, Harry picked up his tray and took a pull of potion first, needing the relief.  Then, he dig into the breakfast.
Standing up, Harry rolled his shoulders.  He had no idea how long they had been up here, but he knew he’d have to do some stretches later, maybe even soak in a hot bath.  So worth it.
Harry chose to ignore the slightly derisive tone that he heard whenever Draco said the word ‘muggle’.  “Um,” he said, thinking back to what Dudley and the other kids in the neighbourhood and school had done.  He hadn’t had friends, had mostly stuck to himself.  “Ride bikes, visit the playground, play football, watch TV and movies, play with computers…”
Harry shrugged a shoulder.  “It’s a bit different dating men instead of women, I think.  Not that I’m that experienced with either.”
Draco gathered Harry in a tight hug.  “We are both new to relationships, and despite all that’s happened to us, still young in many ways.  You are too important to me to rush into something like marriage.  It’s a life long commitment to me, Harry.”
“Are there fish in there?  Bloodsuckers?” Harry asked, a bit enchanted.  The water looked inviting, and if it was a warmer day, he could see that it would be nice to wade in and splash around, float on his back.
That had Draco’s eyes zipping to Harry’s, who made sure his expression was one of teasing.  Maybe even a bit flirtatious.  At least that’s what he was going for.  It probably looked like he had indigestion, for all he knew about this.
“It’s my mother’s. It’s powerful, but not the same,” Draco said. “Doesn’t quite understand me.  Know what I mean?”
This kiss wasn’t soft.  It was intense and deep, and Harry could only sink into it with a pleased hum.  He had been craving a kiss like this for weeks.  Nothing held back.  Draco pushed his tongue past his lips, teasing and playing, and Harry could feel his body responding.
Harry could not kill easily either. He always tried to disarm or stun his opponents, usually able to defeat them or escape. But this was war, and the stakes were extremely high. He was an adult now, and the other side hadn’t been pulling its punches. That massive snake had almost killed him at Christmas, at Godric's Hollow.
Looking for signs of imminent attack, Harry thought, and sighed to himself.  He held his hands out, just wanting to give Draco no fodder for his suspicion.  Not wanting to reverse the trust he had been building.
Instead, there was a dining room table covered with a dozen different foods.  Pancakes, strawberries, whip cream, sausages, bacon and eggs.
Tonight, they had crossed some kind of threshold.  Crossed some line.  There was a new comfort between them now that had come with being naked together, being so open and intimate.  Harry had never felt like this before with anyone.
Draco was thorough, kissing up the side of Harry’s cock as his lubed fingers gently pushed in and twisted.  Licking and sucking, as he found that really sensitive spot.  Tapped and stroked it, until Harry was arching off the bed, begging for more.
Taking a deep breath, Harry sat up and methodically ate his whole breakfast.  He would need his energy to escape, whenever he got his chance.  He had to commit to this plan and just do it, no matter how distasteful.  This was war.  He was a soldier in it.
“Um,” Harry finally said, feeling confused at all his thoughts and emotions today. “do I have to? Do we have big things in the agenda today?” He attempted an easy smile. It came out a bit stiff.
There were a few other cells, similar to Harry’s, and windows covered with iron bars in the passageway.  The stairs were made of stone, and led to a thick, oak door with metal braces.  It took another spell to open it.
“Well, it got pretty relaxed after a few drinks,” Draco said, chuckling now himself.  “They were complaining about their husbands and girlfriends, and I might have contributed a thing or two.”
The words struck Harry, and he gazed at Draco’s profile, his thoughts whirling.  “Where are we?  Why am I here?  Can’t you leave?”
“Now you,” Harry said, tugging at the light blue material.  He couldn’t wait anymore.  Shifting, Draco was breathing fast too as Harry stripped him.
“I sent them to the store.  Told them to come back in two hours,” Draco said, his leg slotting in between Harry’s.
Harry washed his hands after completing the search, and with a shrug, stripped down and washed as well as he could.  There was no towel or facecloth, but he managed with the warm water, soap and his hands.  He cringed pulling his dirty clothes on over his damp skin, but it was the best he could do.
Harry was surprised at the remark, but tried not to show it.  Ron thought Harry liked Draco back then?  Had that been part of it?
So many normal things disrupted this year. Draco hadn’t returned for his seventh year at Hogwarts either, after his involvement in Dumbledor’s death. Harry had heard rumours that Voldemort had been staying at the manor quite a bit, but he obviously hadn’t been there when Harry had been brought there. How much had Draco been around him? Eaten meals with him and other Deatheaters? Harry shuddered at the thought.
In the bathroom, the shower was already running, the air getting steamy.  How many times had they been in the Hogwarts showers together, and Harry had known just a shower curtain separated them?  That he could just sweep it away and see Draco, naked and wet, and then claim he’d made a mistake?
Draco just waited, knowing Harry had more to say.  This confrontation had been a long time coming.  It was time to lay all the cards on the table.
Harry tipped his chin up, loving the caresses.  “They might need some work. Add some other implements to play with.”
Looking pleased but also irritated somehow, Draco let himself be led.  “What the fuck are you up to, Potter?”
“Draco, I’m so sorry that I did this-“ Harry started, but was interrupted in his apology by Draco kissing him again.
That he used that name after Harry had said it bothered him felt like a slap to the face.  “No,” he said firmly, stepping away from Draco’s touch.  “I need to feel more comfortable with how we are.  As a couple. Not just some guy you have kinky sex with.”
When he opened his eyes, Draco was still close, his grey eyes warm.  He waved his wand, saying a soft spell, and Harry felt the tingle of his magic again.  The bonds were still there, but a bit looser.  He could breathe easier, and open his mouth.
Draco fell with him, onto a mattress on the floor.  Harry barely had a chance to catch his breath before Draco was working his jeans open.  “Do you know how often I fantasized of you like this?”
“Maybe.  Or maybe it could be on our first wedding anniversary.” Draco haggled back, that corner of his lips definitely curling upwards despite his mock stern expression.
With nothing else to do, Harry ate the rest of the meal.  Spicy vegetable soup, roast chicken, potatoes, and even chocolate pudding for dessert.
“Yes, they have lived here for a century, at least,” Draco drawled, with a condescending tone Harry recognized from their time together in school.  “But I didn’t visit much, as charming as it is.”  He was glancing around at the dirty, jumbled mess.
“Oh,” Harry said, his voice scratchy.  He sat up, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed, and ran his hands over his sleep-mussed hair.  Feeling a bit embarrassed that was Draco seeing him like this.  Usually he woke up early enough to wash a little, and run his wet hands over his face, straightening his hair as much as he could.  Draco froze, his eyes scanning over Harry, and he braced himself for a derisive comment.
He heard the shower turning off.  Draco would be out in a minute, likely pushing Harry to get ready.  Sighing, Harry crawled out of the bed and got clean clothes out of his weekend case.
“By the end of the night, they were all telling me how to fix things.  They suggested this place and a whole bunch of other things,” Draco finished, still looking embarrassed.
They must have been the last guests to arrive, as the metal ramp was soon retracted and the boat moving down the river.  Harry could understand why Draco was in such a rush now.  They had to be here before the boat launched.
Had Draco felt it too?  Felt that zing of awareness when they had been in such close contact just then?  Felt the pull when they had been talking and goofing around on the blanket?  Draco had laid out a picnic for them to share, after all.
Draco was getting so comfortable around Harry he almost forgot to bind Harry’s wrists before entering the castle.  Harry held his breath as Draco opened the door, ready to follow him in.  Draco stopped so suddenly Harry almost ran into his back.
Harry felt a surge of feelings at seeing Draco, a confusing mess of them.  Excitement, his heart pounding a bit faster, wondering why he was there, and what he wanted.  Attraction, as Draco looked very good in a teal dress shirt and black jeans.  But also an urge to avoid him, make his excuses, and leave.
“Here, let me,” Draco said, standing right behind him.  His arms came around Harry, working on the tie with deft fingers.  Harry could only stare at his attractive reflection in the mirror, feel the warmth of his body pressed against him, take in the spicy scent of his cologne.  A wave of feelings for this man almost making him dizzy.
Looking downwards, Draco seemed to be searching for the right words.  “Um, I think some things got mixed together.  Being around each other, getting to like each other more, but still having to bind you every day.”
Eyes gleaming, Draco slowly pulled out his wand.  With a few flicks and a softly mumbled spell, Harry felt the invisible bonds pull his limbs in tight to his body.  It was so tight he couldn’t really move at all, and even his breathing felt restricted.  It wasn’t painful, but felt so unnatural.
Draco seemed to being feeling it too, and when they went outside, he quickly got rid of Harry’s bonds and stepped back into the castle for a brief minute. He returned with a basket that he set down on a sunny patch of grass.
Was there something there, or was it simply teenage hormones?  Being the only people around each other?
With a small smirk, Draco held his glass towards Harry, who clinked his against it.  “So, this helps you get ‘lucky’?  Do you really need much help in that area?”
“Sheesh,” Harry groaned, pulling a blob of mud out of his hair.  Shaking his head, he just stood up and walked deeper into the pond.  When he was waist deep, he took a deep breath and dunked below the water, scrubbing the mud off his hair, face and clothes.
-A/N:  That’s it!  Thanks for reading!  It has been fun writing again after a long dry spell, so thank you for supporting me.
Harry took another bite of his sandwich, not really feeling that hungry but needing time to decide how to reply.  “Um, yes.  You know we’ve been seeing each other, right?”
Harry had been taking his first sip of his wine when he heard that, and it didn’t end well.  There was a bit of choking and sputtering, and red wine ended up places it didn’t belong.
Draco’s eyes flashed, and he sat up straighter.  “My turn now,” he said simply, grabbing a handful of blackberries and rubbing them down Harry’s chest.  His mouth followed, licking up the mess and eating the fruit.
Suddenly there was a flurry of motion.  Harry realized that Bellatrix was attacking the snatchers for some reason.  It was over in a flash, with her ordering Wormtail to put the boys in the cellar.
It must have signalled to the suite above, as the door lock clicked and Harry was able to open it.  He walked up the stairs, heart beating faster in anticipation.
Draco chuckled, seeming pleased at this response, his hand not moving as much now, just cupping him.  He kissed down Harry’s neck, his chest, lower and lower.  Making Harry groan in anticipation.  “Yes, yes, please...,” he gasped.
Bellatrix’s lips twisted into a smirk.  “Get Draco,” she commanded, likely to a house elf or some other servant nearby.
Rolling his eyes, Draco squirmed a bit under the close scrutiny.  “I was upset... after we had that fight.  It felt like I was screwing everything up and I had no idea how to fix it.”
“Most kids have magical toys, things they can play with in a safe way.  Small brooms that only float a few inches off the ground and go slowly, dolls that say simple words when you talk to them, pretend wands that send out small sparks when you wave them around.”
It seemed like a blink of the eye and Draco was over him, straddling his hips, his wand in his hand.  “Put your hands up over your head, near the headboard,” he instructed, eyes already growing heated.
He sensed a presence beside him.  Draco, a tentative smile on his face.  “I wanted to do something special...,” he said, a flicker of self-doubt coming across his face.
Draco eventually moved off Harry, both breathing hard.  Harry assumed it was another break, but then Draco rolled him on his side, facing away, and spooned up behind him.  The binding above his head allowed for such movement.
“No more for me, I’m stuffed,” Draco replied with a smile that seemed too large for his face.  “But give some to Harry.  His appetite is bigger than mine.”
The voice jarred him out of his thoughts, to find Ron giving him a bemused look.  “Sorry, just feeling a bit confused about it all.”
-I think this will have about six chapters and be around 20K words. I will try to post at least once a week.
This was much better, and they made several variations before heading to the pond.  By then, the sun had come out and it was a very warm spring day.  Launching their boats, most stayed upright and didn’t sink.  They tried to get them to move, waving their hands or the unfolded paper sheets to create some breeze.
But Draco’s eyes warmed, a smile curving the corner of his mouth before he leaned into Harry, kissing him back hard.  Harry gathered him in his arms, holding him tight, kissing, lost in the feel of him.  Of this.
Harry sighed.  He strongly doubted it.  Draco had been a loyal son his whole life.  If he hadn’t split from his family and Voldemort over his task to kill Dumbledor last year, he wouldn’t do it for a few (incredible, amazing) kisses.  And Harry couldn’t stay here for weeks, waiting for those feelings to develop, never knowing if they would get there.
That warm look made Harry smile back, chuckling. He jumped up. “Enough of that. How about a game of tag? You are ‘it’. Catch me if you can.”  He tapped Draco’s shoulder once.
Harry was a Gryffindor, and sometimes jumped into things a bit too rashly.  Getting up, Harry looked down at the rug.  “Just lie down, right here?”
Draco sighed.  “I’ll tell you on our tenth wedding anniversary, OK?  If we both live long enough to see that day.”
Between Draco saying that and the cheek kiss, Harry could only shake his head and crawl into the bed with a heavy sigh.  Draco had obviously made plans for this weekend and Harry was half curious, half dreading what else would happen.
They continue down past the ground level that has the kitchen, down into a true basement.  It was noticeably colder and darker, and Draco’s hand tightened on his own.
After at least ten minutes, Harry Potter finally strolled out, his scarlet uniform robes marked with mud and some burn marks.  “Oh, it’s you.  This is a nice surprise, Draco.”
Draco’s hands went into his hair, combing through it with his fingers.  Occasionally getting a bit caught on a tangle and undoing it.  It was a wonderful feeling, having Draco almost petting him.  He had dug his hands into his hair before, even pulled on it sometimes, but never stroked through it.
Draco was here, but who else?  The food had been good enough that Harry knew there must be at least some house elves.  Preparing food for Draco as well, taking care of his needs.  Were his parents or crazy aunt here too?  Other Deatheaters?  Why were they keeping him here?  Why hadn’t they turned him over to Voldemort?
“Draco, I know you have mixed feelings about this.  It’s why you didn’t identify me to your family when I had the stinging jinx, right?  You knew it would mean my death,” Harry implored.  “We have been rivals at school, maybe even enemies to a point, but not that far.  You don’t want me dead.”
Grabbing a pink throw from a plush armchair, Harry draped it over Draco.  Feeling a little tired himself, he crawled into the bed, spooning him gently from behind.  It had been a busy day, and neither of them had slept that well last night.  Harry found it didn’t take long until he drifted off himself.
Draco picked up a couple items from the bed stand, holding them out for Harry to see them.  A blindfold made of silky black material, and a deep red rope.
Lying on his back in the centre of the bed, Harry stared at the ceiling in disbelief.  All that kissing and touching, alone together in this big, comfortable bed, and that’s it?  He was still hard, almost aching from being aroused so long, and considered finishing himself off.  Just for the release.  But the idea of doing that was too depressing.  Within a minute or two, his erection faded.
They headed inside eventually, and Harry was feeling even more confident in his plan.  He had made some good progress today, getting Draco relaxed enough to talk fairly freely.  Draco was bored enough to let Harry entertain him, with talking or whatever else he could find to do in this remote location.  The more time they spent together, the more relaxed Draco would become.  It would only take a second to grab his wand and escape.  Harry doubted the grounds were warded to prevent people leaving, just from entering.
Draco came out a few minutes later, changed into deep red pyjamas that looked good against his fair colouring.  He smiled at Harry as he got in his side of the bed.
It was hard to say who moved first, but they were on that bed a minute later.  Kissing, touching, completely tangled up.
“Fuck, this is cold,” Draco complained, as he walked to stand by Harry, dunking to clean up as well.
Harry stood up slowly, rolling his shoulders.  He was still a bit stiff.  He held his hand out to Draco, and was happy when he took it and allowed Harry to pull him upright.  “Next time, let’s do that on the sofa.”  Or on a bed, he thought to himself.
But Draco wasn’t doing more.  He had pushed Harry’s jeans down, his shirt up, leaving him exposed.  A flick of his wand freed his wrists.  Harry peered at him from under his heavy lids, still breathing hard.
What was the alternative?  At any moment, Lucius could take him to Voldemort, and this slim opportunity would be gone.  All was fair in love and war, right?
“I hope you eat more of this than you did your supper,” Draco said softly, sliding the breakfast tray beneath the door.
There was a frantic minute or two more, full of panting, groans and swearing.  Ending up in a sweaty heap of euphoric exhaustion.
“I could ask you the same,” Harry said, wanting to pull out his wand.  He was probably better in a duel than Blaise and Goyle.  Surely there was a way to get out of this without hurting anyone.
It took Harry a second, feeling Draco’s arms tight around his chest and his warm breath against his neck, panting hard. Their legs seemed tangled together, and it suddenly struck Harry how intimate the position was. They had crashed together during matches, but had never been like this.
Harry shifted, letting his upper body rest against Draco’s as the kisses deepened.  He pushed a hand into his hair, savouring how the smooth strands felt.  Loved it when Draco’s arms came around him, stroking over his back.
Draco nodded, and pulled back.  “I hope you don’t mind, but I think I’ll jump in the shower now.  I have an early start tomorrow for work.”  He rolled off the bed and was heading to the en suite before Harry had a chance to respond.
Harry rolled over on the bed, his eyes heavy from lack of sleep, and was grateful  for the dim light of the cell.  Draco looked normal, picking up Harry’s barely touched tray from the previous night.  When Harry didn’t reply, he gave a frustrated huff and left, leaving him in peace.
Harry shook his head in frustration, and felt grateful at least it didn’t ache as badly today.  “Aren’t there some wizarding laws about how to treat prisoners?”
He had to decline sharply to get through the doorway, and the weight shift made them lose their balance, crashing to the stone floor in a pile, the broomstick skittering away.  Stunned and breathless, Harry tried to grab hold of Draco.
“Yes, like an apprenticeship,” Harry said, letting his cheek rest against Draco’s shoulder.  “I am sorry for what I did to escape, Draco.  But I can’t let things get more, um, physical between us until I know you forgive me.”
Seeing them, Harry swallowed hard, and his eyes flitted to the bed.  The only bed.  The one they apparently sharing for the next two nights.
“You like what you like,” Draco replied with a warm look.  He picked up his own cup, taking a sip.  “What do you want to do now?”
Pulling back, Harry met Draco’s gaze steadily.  “Will you take the job?  I know I pulled some strings to get you in the door but I think the job will suit you.  I won’t interfere again.  How you do in the job is entirely up to you.  Olivia won’t keep you around if you’re shite at it.”
“So your father could appear at anytime to take me to your Dark Lord?  To be killed?  Like a lamb to the slaughter?”
Returning the kiss, Harry let his hand slide down Draco’s bare back, stopping at the towel tucked around his waist.  “I’m not saying I didn’t like how tonight went.  I’m just saying you don’t need to do elaborate schemes.”
Draco saw the other tray was empty, and met Harry’s eyes.  “Oh, are you feeling better now?  I was wondering if you were getting sick.  I have some Pepper Up potion, if you want.”
“Well, well,” Draco said, coming around a pile of furniture with Goyle and Blaise, all with their wands drawn. “What brings you here, Potter?”
Could he grab a rock or a stick and hit Draco hard on the head? Leave him unconscious and get away? He didn’t relish the thought of hurting him, of hurting anyone, but his life was at stake. So much was at stake. Voldemort was gathering more power by the day, and without Dumbledor, could the Order of the Phoenix fight him? Defeat him? Was the prophesy correct? Could only Harry defeat him?
Draco chuckled softly near his ear, and went back to kissing, licking and nibbling along Harry’s neck.  He seemed to be mapping out every part of his skin, noting what made Harry moan, pant and whimper.
He looked around, a bit frantically, his head buzzing. It took a few deep breaths to calm himself down. Trees, hedge, grass...
Wand still drawn, Draco waved Harry out of the cell.  Harry walked slowly.  Here was a chance to look around, get his bearings, look for weaknesses.  Get Draco comfortable with doing this, and Harry might find a way to get away.
Harry said softly, and it felt like a piece of his heart was dying as the magical bonds went around Draco, even covering his mouth.  Harry pulled a blanket over his still body, tucking it around his neck, wanting to give him some comfort.
This time, Draco was the one eventually passing the lube to Harry.  He seemed to enjoy the prep just as much, and got on all fours.  “Like this, OK?”
Feeling a bit foolish, Harry picked out a long, thick blade of grass. “Um, pick one like this,” he said softly, showing it to Draco.
That made Harry turn away too, looking at the ceiling but his thoughts far away.  He luckily had no memories from his baby or toddler years, with the first thing he could remember was a lime green ball Dudley had been playing with in the garden.  He had been called inside and Harry had a few blissful minutes playing with it before it was snatched away.  He had no memories of his aunt using a cloth to wipe his face or hands if he was a messy toddler, and certainly none of his actual parents using a scorgify spell on him as a baby.  It all made him feel a bit sad.
Draco eventually finished his drink, and stood up, stretching like a cat.  He strolled over to Harry, looking down at him, still looking quite smug.  “Totally at my mercy.  Whatever shall I do with you?”
His kiss was light, and Harry closed his eyes.  He wanted to kiss back, but couldn’t even move that small amount.  He could still feel though, as Draco leisurely moved over his face.  Soft kisses along his jawline, near his ear that almost felt ticklish, on his closed eyelids.
Sitting up, Harry leaned against the headboard.  “So, are we in a good place now?  Are there things lingering from the past we need to deal with?”
Finally, Draco set his spoon down and stretched his hand across the table to take Harry’s. “Upstairs?” he drawled, arching an eyebrow.
“And grow ingredients in the garden,” Draco said.  Obviously ideas were zipping through him as well.
They gathered around Dobby; Griphook, Hermione, Ron and Harry, ready to apparate far away.  Bellatrix howled in fury, and threw her dagger.
Harry felt the urge to reach out and push that hair back. To feel it’s silky smooth texture, so different from his own. What would Draco do if he did that? Would his eyes warm even more? Heat up?
“Hold on,” Draco panted, moving off Harry to reach into the bedside table, pulling out some lube.  “Is this OK?”
Harry chuckled.  “Yeah, I was just teasing you.  Do you mean it was true?  You were into that then?”
Harry desperately wanted to look away.  Sink to his knees, beg Draco for forgiveness.  Kiss him, hug him, make sure he was OK.  But his duty came first.  Before everyone and everything.
Closing his eyes, Harry felt the tingle of magic along his skin, from his hair down to his toes, his clothing rustling like it was in an invisible breeze.  His breath caught at the sensation.
“If it leads to kissing like that, yes.  Seven days a week and twice on Sundays,” Harry said, stepping closer to kiss Draco.
Laughter mixed with irritation, a feeling he really only had around this cocky git.  But it killed his nerves, and he stepped into the shower like he’d done this other people dozens of times.
Draco must have heard the doubt in his tone.  He huffed, and tossed a throw pillow onto the rug.  “Fine.  Your head can go there.  I’ll even tuck a blanket over you.”
Without even knowing what he was doing, Harry took a step closer.  Draco opened his eyes, a flash of confusion in them at seeing him standing so close.  But then they flicked downwards, to Harry’s mouth, and he took it as an invitation.
“Shut up!” Draco shouted, and jumped to his feet, wand pointing steadily at Harry.  “Back to your cell, now!”
“Good,” Draco said, stopping right in front of Harry to glare down at him.  “Far too good.  Suspiciously good.”
It was the most blatantly sexual thing they had done together so far, and Harry moaned, pushing back, matching his rhythm.  He could hear Draco’s fast breathing, and knowing it was because he was aroused turned him on even more.
“Why don’t you use the bathroom first?” Draco said, opening his suitcase, and pulling out some light blue pyjamas.
Like with everything else, Draco was competitive, kneeling and hanging on to a bush at the edge of the water in order to extend close to his boats, blowing on their fragile paper sails enthusiastically.
Within a few minutes, they were both breathing hard.  Harry’s bound hands went to Draco’s jeans, and soon had them undone.
“Thanks to you,” Draco said, pointing a long finger at Harry.  “You just had to save me, didn’t you?  Just like in the Room of Requirement!”
“It’s an old family castle.  Malfoys lived here before we built the Manor.  It dates back to some of the fiercest wizarding wars and has incredible defences,” Draco drawled, with a proud tilt to his chin that he always got when talking about his pure blood family.  “No one can come snatch you from here, not even house elves.  Only Malfoys can get through the wards, or those they permit.”
Draco chuckled, pulling his hand away and rubbing it.  “You did that wandless?  Shit,” he said, giving Harry an impressed look.
Shrugging a shoulder, Draco took a bite from his buttered roll.  “From Olivia, and  people I know from work.”
Harry could have sworn he felt Draco licking his skin, and that was the final straw.  He shook, panting and gasping in pleasure.  Making a mess and not caring at all.  He sunk into the mattress, completely drained.
Draco stood beside him, taking it all in.  Harry had been busy down here, moving the clutter away, cleaning it thoroughly.  Along the one wall, there were three jail cells.  One had an open door.
Too aroused to argue, Harry did as bid.  The binding around his wrists attached to the headboard, but weren’t that taunt.  Draco kept kissing Harry, and they were soon lost in it, often taking short breaks to cool down.
With a frustrated huff, Draco jumped up from the sofa.  He paced around the living room, clearly agitated.  “This is so dumb.  You’ve said you were sorry a dozen times, and I know you mean it.  You saved my life, helped me at the trial, helped me get a job.”
Things felt a little awkward then between them.  Draco standing there, not saying anything, Harry waiting….
He apparated to a forest Hermione had taken them to last fall.  It had trees close together, lots of places to hide.  He made a pile of leaves, put up some protective wards, and waited.  If there was anyone following him, they would do it within the first day.  He didn’t want to lead them to anyone on his side.
“I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl to girl,” she barked, her hand latching on to Hermione’s arm.
That shut Harry up for a while.  “Tenth anniversary?  How about the tenth anniversary of the day we met instead?  My 21st birthday?”  That was less than three years away.
Draco pulled back and stepped out of reach.  “Well, not right now.  We both have to work in the morning.”
But through all that, he saw Harry coming towards him, his sharp eyes finding him and holding him.  He stuck him arms out, getting ready to grab hold of anything.
-Thanks for reading ‘Captivate’ and this sequel.  I have had a harder time writing due to the pandemic, so really appreciate your support.
This was accompanied by resting his hand on Harry’s forearm, a small display of affection their hostess noticed and beamed at.  “You two are so cute together.  How long have you been a couple?”  She placed a large scoop of the eggs on Harry’s plate.
“Harry,” Draco said, drawing out the name, kissing down his chest.  He took his time, teasing him, exploring everywhere.
Draco’s eyes heated up, and he pulled out his wand.  A quick spell, and Harry’s wrists were bond tight.
Maybe Draco saw this last emotion flit over Harry’s face, because he pressed his lips together, stood a bit taller, and walked briskly to him.  “You’ve been avoiding me.”
Reaching over, Harry took his hand and gave it a squeeze.  “I get it.  It was a strange situation.  Small things got amplified.  Like I thought a lot about that time we played tag.  Like, um, several times during the nights.”
It was only then that Harry noticed he was stepping onto a metal ramp of sorts, bridging between solid land and a large boat nearby.  Smiling staff greeted them, passing them a glass of white wine.
It was hard to tell time in the dungeon, but Harry was famished by the time Draco finally arrived with the supper meal.  It was at least a couple hours late.
“What?”  Harry’s eyes widened, and his breath catching a bit at that.  Wasn’t that a step backwards?
He could feel the bed shifting as Draco got into a comfortable position.  He seemed to be kneeling quietly at Harry’s side.   It was a surprise when his lips touched Harry’s, a light touch that deepened.  Harry gasped against his lips when Draco’s hand wrapped around his cock.  He stroked it slowly, leaving Harry gasping and writhing against his bonds.
OK, they liked each other.  Had interesting conversations and enjoyed doing things together.  Harry loved Draco’s competitiveness and his intelligence, his sharp tongue and quick wit.
Harry threw a final rock over the pond, pleased when it skipped a few times, satisfying his competitive nature.  “Fine.  Let’s go.”
Lucius clasped the back of Draco’s neck with a large paternal hand, looming over his shoulder to peer at his only offspring.  “Draco, look closely, son,” he implored.  “If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven.  All would be as it was, you understand?”
Harry completely got that.  There were so many unasked questions between them.  He started with the main one.  The one that still stuck in his mind all these weeks later, when he had gone over things again and again.  “Why didn’t you tell her?  Bellatrix.”
“Not that!” Draco snapped.  He waved his hands around, clearly still incensed.  “They don’t treat me nicely.”
Smirking a bit, Draco turned towards Harry.  “Most older wizarding houses have holding cells.  Part of our long, violent past.”
Harry sipped his tea.  “It’s tasty, and not that much different, but...,” he said, shrugging a shoulder.
“Fuck,” Draco panted, moving away to lie on his back.  He pulled out his wand and released Harry’s bonds, and then did a quick scorgify spell over both of them when Harry shifted to lie beside him.
“Do you know this house well?  It belonged to relatives on your mother’s side, right?” Harry asked, pulling Draco down the hall and down the stairs.
Harry unbuckled his uniform, slipping off the thick red robe and hanging it on a hook on the wall.  The snug black long sleeve t-shirt and slim fit trousers he had worn beneath were a bit dusty.  He ran a hand through his unruly hair.  “I’m going to make some coffee.  Want one?”
“Um, it’s very nice,” Harry said, trying to relax into it.  “So, where did you hear about this?  And the B&B?  Everything?”
Harry sighed.  The pain had returned every few hours, waking him, and he had been glad to have the potion last night.
Harry walked slowly, feigning weakness again, trying to look around as unobtrusively as he could.  Draco occasionally prodded him with his wand to keep him moving along.  He headed down the stairs back to the dungeon, and felt a sudden wave of dizziness.  His bound hands scrambled to steady himself against the wall, but it was Draco’s firm grip on his shoulder that stopped him from pitching down the stairs.  Without a word, he moved to Harry’s side, an arm slung along his lower back, the stairway luckily wide enough to allow them to continue that way to the bottom.  Draco released him and stepped away, his eyes watchful for signs Harry was still unsteady.
“So, you are stuck here too, just as bored as I am,” Harry chuckled dryly, liking that.  Misery loves company.
“But...?  Obviously there is something wrong, something-“ Draco started, his anger fading, a pang of hurt coming through more.
Draco’s eyebrows rose slightly.  “So, you are kind of claustrophobic now?  Is that why you were so insistent I let you come outside?”
What would it be like to have a relationship with a father, and mother, like Draco had?  Loving, but following such an evil path?  Harry knew Draco was conflicted, wanting to please them but less engaged in helping Voldemort in recent years.  Lucius already had lost favour by the failure to get the prophesy at the Ministry of Magic.  Had he told anyone that they had Harry Potter?  Would he have lost face again to Voldemort and the Deatheaters?
He took in Draco’s surprised expression before he turned and sprinted across the wide lawn. But in only a few seconds, Draco was on his feet and narrowing the distance between them.
Harry felt the bed move as Draco jumped out of it, rushing over to his case and yanking out clothes.  He propped himself up in one elbow.  “What’s going on?” he asked sleepily.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed when he heard Draco return later with his supper.  “Why?  Are you giving me more potion?”
Laying back in the bed, Harry went under the blanket again.  Was Draco doing the same thing?  Whacking off?  What was he thinking about?  Who?  Was there someone in Slytherin he liked?  He couldn’t recall Draco with any particular girl at Hogwarts.  Or was there a certain guy?
Drawing back the covers, Harry crawled into the bed.  Draco was fumbling around for something in his case.   “I don’t need scented candles or anything.  Just you, Draco.”
“You’re welcome,” he said, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips and then meeting his.  There was a good amount of heat in them, and Harry felt an answering pang of arousal.  He was always horny in the mornings, and waking up beside Draco made it even more intense.
Chuckling, Draco put the leftovers and dirty dishes back in the basket, and stretched out beside Harry. “Exactly. It’s exhausting having to guard you all the time. I’ll take any advantage I can get.”
Harry felt bored and restless by the time Draco finally unlocked his cell door, and guided him upstairs with his hands bound. How many days had he been here? It was getting hard to remember....
Harry chuckled, grabbing hold of his shoulders and pulling him back down. “Why the hell would we do that?”
It was a blur after that, his heart pounding in fear as they were pushed and dragged into the cold, dark manor.  He could here Hermione gasp in pain, likely from the man twisting her arm, and Ron pulled away from his captor instinctively to try to help her.  But none of them could do anything but ineffectively squirm in their bonds.
It was wonderful, stepping close behind Draco, rubbing the sponge over his shoulders and watching the bubbles as they descended down his wet back.  His hair was already damp, a darker blond shade and slicked back off his face.  Harry moved the sponge down his spine, and gave it a squeeze, sudsy water running over his small round ass.
And Harry had just left.  Spun on his heel and marched over to the fireplace.  Escaped.  Only to be haunted by every second.  Replaying it over and over in his mind.
