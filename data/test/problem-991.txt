He had to find him. No idea as to why or what he could do, but he just knew he had to find him and reassure him that everything was fine.
Life was good as it was, both of them on their little cocoon without any exterior input. Draco wanted them to stay like this forever, but he knew things would eventually changed. With each passing day, his sentence grew shorter which meant he would eventually have to
"We will" Harry pushed his plate to the side -it was empty, thank Merlin- and got up from the table. "Draco?"
moving away. "It's only ice, and thanks to your spell we can slide right over it. It's not as fancy as proper skates but..."
And there it was, that distant tone that clearly said: I don't trust you anymore. He had been using it ever since their fight and it was really annoying. Harry sighed and turned away from the old closet, facing Draco.
"Crying is good for you" Draco spoke, touching Harry's cheeks as if to dry some forgotten tears "You might feel like shit right now, but tomorrow you will feel better. At least that's what Mother used to say"
He was unable to hear, his head heavy with fear. Harry had died before, but his mind was screaming at him, saying that he was going to die right then and there if he didn't try and breathe harder. But he didn't feel any air inside his lungs.
"No, I think I see an empty table" He pointed, and he was right. Right at the back, there was a round table with no one occupying it. And even if it was reserved, Harry was sure he would be able to convince Rosmerta to let them dine there.
She spoke again, his voice a bit sharper. Sheppard had stopped walking around and was now frowning. Harry could see him clearly from the little gap on the door.
Harry moved closer to him, almost hugging him but leaving enough space for both to be able to write down. He could see how much restraint the Gryffindor was using not to speak ill of his father. Draco didn't blame him for how he felt. Sometimes, he also hated Lucius.
Oddly enough, Draco was a little ball on the bed, and didn't seem to have moved since the last talk Harry remembered. He looked defenseless, and even tiny. Harry had a weird urge to move forward. And do what? Hug him? He was being ridiculous.
there, but Harry seemed anxious. He didn't know how to bring it up, but he suspected it had a lot to do with his upbringing.
They stared at each other and started laughing. True, joyous laughter at the absurdity of everything.
"Hey!" Draco frowned at another student, that had suddenly hit his shoulder with his own in passing, almost as if wanting to get his attention.
"I am not trying to save you" Yeah, that was a lie but Harry wasn't going to back down now. "I just... This is unfair. Did she say you were a suspect?"
Draco frowned and looked at him as if he had gone insane in those seconds. "Talk to him? About what?Â  Oh, how you doing? you got cursed and almost killed, probably because of me"
Hermione got up, dragging Ron behind "We'll leave you two alone" They didn't even bothered waiting for an answer. With the passing of the days, his friends had grown used to their new dynamic, to the way he interacted with Draco... And they had grown used to Malfoy as well.
Harry felt slightly revitalized but he knew he would crash soon as well. In a quick movement, he got on top of Draco, hands right next to his head. He opened his eyes, staring at him with a smile.
Draco knew his mother would prefer a duel, or flying or practicing dark arts, anything other than those stereotypical housewife chores. Not that there was anything wrong with it, Draco didn't mind, but it was worrying to see on Narcissa.
Draco looked up at him and tried to imitate Hermione's concerned and slightly angry expression. It got Harry to laugh so it was probably accurate. "She's angry I don't push you to get a job"
Draco lowered himself, allowing the water to cover all of him, even his head. It felt good, water all around him, silence, peace. He couldn't die like this, he already knew it, but he didn't want to die. He only wanted the peace and quiet from the in between.
That first night he had ran away from that place, from him and from the night sky only to return after a couple days. And Malfoy was there.
He had no idea where they were going, the Room of Requirement was definitely not an option and he didn't know of any other safe spaces...
day in that bathroom, the way Malfoy had been sobbing like a child.. And how mad he had felt. He remembered that day perfectly well. It was the first time he thought he killed someone. It had been terrifying.
"Your mother and I... We knew you were different" Draco flinched, looking away "We tried to raise you right, Draco"
"Don't you ever say such nonsense. Your father was... He loves you so much, Draco" She sighed "Do you think I would still be with him if he didn't?"
Draco stopped digging his teeth on his lip and stared at the auror as if he was about to kill him "I- I love him. You have a problem with that?"
Sadly Draco didn't show any signs of wanting to kiss him, he was just walking next to him -and still under the cloak- with a small frown on his face. Harry almost hated how good he was at concealing his emotions. And yeah, Harry knew him quite a lot but he had no clue how he was with... relationships? Did this mean Draco liked boys? He had so many questions and so little answers.
stars" his stone was sarcastic. Harry said nothing, and eventually heard a groan "Pansy only gave me the key today, alright? After our fight, she thought I needed a safe space"
There were times when Harry felt like the magical world was his home and everything he had, and there were other times when he couldn't understand half the things that happened in said world. This was one of the latter. Taking magic from a place? Putting said magic inside someone's body?
Harry half groaned, sitting up and pulling at the food tray to eat a small bite of bread. It made him chuckle, but he only got up from his spot on the floor and walked towards the double bed, opening the sheets and laying down. It was soft, and they were together.
"Of course" Draco knew how much Harry deserved it. Still, it was hard to think about what to get him. Harry didn't have anything but he didn't put that much weight on material things, which made it all the more complicated.
they didn't want another student in there in case she tried to harm herself. Or something like that.
The paper in front of him was only that: paper, but Harry kept looking at it as if it had all the answers of the Universe. He wondered how long it had took to write and how long it had traveled to find him.
"Sure, whatever" His best friend didn't even look at him. Harry didn't want this for them, but he wasn't going to start shunning Draco simply because Ron was being a prat. His friend was better than this.
Draco knew it wouldn't be hard to get lost in the house without any human contact for the rest of the day, but he didn't want that. The one thing he wanted was the thing he would've been dreading years back. He wanted to talk to his mother and explain, to have an honest talk. Like the ones they seemed to be having more and more. It was partly due to selfish reasons: he wanted to know if things could work out with the three of them, or if they would fight and hurt each other incessantly, making their living situation unbearable. But his reasons weren't all about himself. He needed to know if she was alright, if he had hurt her. He wanted to apologize.
Hermione nodded after a small deliberation with herself and started to explain everything that had happened after the first attack. Harry chimed in to add what he had learned from McGonagall and other things they had been discussing.
Right. He had questioned her about the Chamber of Secrets once. He had, also, asked her questions about her death. That had not gone well, but he was truly curious and... well, he wanted to know. Eventually she told him, through tears and sobs. It was awful.
It was as if someone had slapped him. The hot rush of humiliation running through his body. How dare he? How dare he say something so vile...?
Harry had not stopped to think about why Hermione or Ron had truly came back to Hogwarts with him. Herm loved studying but Ron despised it. Harry's stomach turned picturing the talk they probably had about him and about how sad he was and how they should go with him.
Lucius placed his hands on Draco's shoulders and pressed hard on them. It made him feel more desperate, his lungs trying to breathe but unable to. Was he going to die? He knew it was just a panic attack, but his heart was beating faster and faster and his terror was increasing rapidly.
Draco had no memories of any of it, but not everything had been bad with them. "I shouldn't have allowed our beliefs to get in the way of your happiness" She frowned "I-... I wanted a better world for you, Draco"
They could play a quick seeker game on a riverside, or along the mountains. That could be incredibly fun... and dangerous, considering how competitive they both were.
After finishing up with the plants and whatever the subject was, Harry dragged himself to the Great Hall to get something to eat, to his bedroom to change into something more comfortable for their free hours, and then back to the Great Hall to see if he could catch Draco there.
"Oi!" Harry stole the pillow from one of his hands and slapped his side with it, chuckling as well. Draco laughed this time, moving away from him but unable to get away -unless he wanted to fall off the bed.
When they were a few steps away, a boy from the table next to it got up and occupied one of the empty seats. He smiled at them, raising an eyebrow.
Dumbledore... I got him killed, in the end" He looked away, tormented. Harry wanted to speak but memories flooded his head and his throat fell shut "My aunt killed my own cousin, Nymphadora" Had they ever met? As cousins? Harry had so many questions "My Father is Lucius Malfoy, a bloody D-..." Draco closed his eyes, unable to keep talking, he seemed small even though he was taller than Harry. Sadness will do that, Harry thought, moving forward and hugging him very tightly. It was hard to know what was going through his head. How many of those things haunted him? How much of all of that did Draco believe to be his fault? Every single one of those things had happened, it was all true, but it wasn't the whole truth. And Dumbledore... Harry sighed, not letting go.
She had her hands over the desk, holding them together. Her lips pressed into a fine line and she sighed, pointing at the chair in front of her "Please sit, Harry" He did, feeling a bit small in that office "You were burdened from a young age, I know that. There is no need for you to worry about anything, Harry. Am I clear?"
"Draco" Harry tried again, tightening the grip on his hand "if there's one thing I am sure of is that your parents love you"
Harry wanted to say something nice like "maybe they will get together again' or 'he could get better' but he knew how badÂ  Neville's parents' state was and he was sure there's no coming back from it. So instead he held Draco's hand over the blankets and allowed the silence to fill in the empty holes on their souls.
Draco didn't know if it was having seen Harry moments ago, the warmth of his hand still on his cheek, or being fed up with his father's attitude but he fisted his hands and turned to him "Would you
Harry walked through the open door not knowing what he was going to find, or if he was allowed up there. A well lit bedroom welcomed him, with Draco sat on the edge of a bed. He had his back to the door, and seemed to be holding something in his hands. Was this his room? There were no poster's on the wall, no furniture other than the essentials although Harry noted scratch marks on the floor, as if something had been dragged and rearranged. The one thing that let him know this was Draco's room were his initials carved on the beds frame. The bed barely dipped as he sat next to him, and yet Draco didn't seem to register his presence.
Draco almost wanted to smirk, but he didn't like aurors in general, one nice one wasn't going to change that at all.
"Hey, hey"Â  Draco gasped a bit between their lips, hands holding him tight against his body "Show me around?"
Draco looked down making it more obvious and Harry thought about moving away. He was crossing a line, wasn't he?
"Hm, perhaps Potter isn't" Narcissa scoffed, placing the cup between her lips to give her tea a couple sips. She had perfect manners, and he had never seen her lose composure. Not even when Voldemort was at their house.
When they rolled up his sleeve and his white bandage came to view, still hiding away his biggest regret, he started to truly panic.
Suddenly he wished for the night to come quickly, he still had lunch, and more lessons and maybe after all of that he could evade all of his friends and hide up in the Tower with the one person who he should be avoiding.
"Are you alright?" The young auror smiled at him, reaching for his shoulders with a calming presence.
Detention was bothersome, yes, but at least he would have something to do and keep busy. How old he felt right then and there, how far away from his teenage years he was.
Tomorrow? Oh, yeah. Harry nodded, the last few days after his fight with Draco had been a blur. He had felt terribly alone, and even more angry than usual. He knew he was tiring his friends, but he couldn't help it. He was just so... so... He couldn't describe it but sometimes life felt meaningless.
The old man sighed loudly, rubbing a hand against his forehead before extending the parchment towards Harry. He moved closer and signed it quickly. He didn't need to read it, not really. He wanted Draco to live with him, and even if he had to sign his soul away, he would.
"Yes. Can we talk?" There was a small sigh, and she pointed at the empty space on the sofa. He gladly took it. "I'm sorry for what I said"
Did this mean they were boyfriends? Oh, fuck. Harry wasn't sure he was ready for that. His hands started to sweat as they walked towards Gryffindor Tower, his mind on his friends and everyone that knew them and... Maybe kissing him had been an impulse reaction.
"Mr. Potter" A completely unknown auror greeted him, without a smile and hurrying him inside his office. "I suppose you are here about the job?"
âHe'll use us as collateralâ Draco whispered, but he was sure Bell could hear what they were saying to each other âtaking so much magical power can kill anyone, so he'll use one of us as... some sort of...â
Harry thought very highly of them. They were like magic cops, weren't they? Keeping other people safe, making the world a better place. Yeah, well, now he wasn't so sure about it.
It wasn't only the panic attack, it was the memory. He remembered going through that maze with Cedric, he remembered that night in vivid detail. He remembered the soft dew and the dampness in the air, he remembered walking with wand in hand and not knowing if something bad was going to happen.
"Yeah, I get the idea, Ron" Harry tried not to smirk "I don't think his Patronus is a doe. Wait, is everyone betting on this?"
"No... No, I don't know... He said there was blood and..." Elliot frowned "he was so stressed and sad. Pomfrey gave him a sleeping draught"
"It is a happy memory" Draco bit down on his lip and looked at Harry "Or it was. Before everything changed so much... I think I don't have a happiest memory, Harry"
The moment he entered his bedroom, he kicked his wardrobe so hard he almost broke one of his toes. Why did it hurt so much? He had always, in his weirdest dreams, stood up to his father. Then why did it hurt so much?
The aurors could deny his application and force him to finish his sentence in France with his parents and no one could do anything to change it. If that happened, they would have to find a way to maintain a "long distance" relationship. Not only that, but living with his parents also meant there were bigger chances of Harry crossing paths with Lucius and Draco didn't want to see that happen. Not in a million years.
The hand left his shoulder and Harry wondered if he had said the wrong thing, cold creeping up his arm.
Harry nodded and followed his friends into the train, they were adults now even if their bodies were still those of teenage boys. People were still talking loudly on the train, running through the hallways trying to find a place to sit and it was refreshing. Most of those students were younger, first or second year ones but at least someone had some light in their lives.
"I'm staying" Draco could barely hear his own voice, but it was enough to stop his father. He looked up, but straight to McGonagall, not being able to look to his parents faces. He couldn't handle more looks of disappointment.
"No" Malfoy looked at him as if he was a child "Merlin, Potter, there are certain things I still believe in... But I do not think killing is the answer, or torture or..." he shivered and Harry had the sudden need to give him his cloak. "I
There was another kiss, intimate, a kiss that they would never do in public. A kiss that was for them alone.
If Draco had considered talking to McGonagall the idea of her calling Lucius made his stomach turn. "No, thank you. I don't want to escalate this. It was just... It was nothing"
Growing up the idea of being Marked just like Father was seemed an honor, something to make his ancestors proud. It had been received in a blaze of agony and fear. No glory there, and no pride in his Father's eyes either. After that, everything had gone downhill.
"Are you? Harry, you snap all the time. You avoid us, Ginny... You ditch class and, listen, I know you are trying to be friendly and leave the past behind but befriending Malfoy in this state is not helping you" What the fuck did they know about what was or wasn't helping him?Â  "Harry, you need to go back to therapy. I'm sure McGonagall would allow you to leave once a week, or maybe the therapist can come here and..."
"You don't owe me anything" Draco's hand was drawing slow unidentified shapes on his waist, right over his waistband. "Alright?" Harry could only nod, pressing himself against him a bit more, lacing their legs together. "Besides, I feel much better"
"I think we should talk about the other night, the room of requirement?" Sometimes Harry wondered if Ron was brave, or really stupid. Well, he wondered that about himself if he was being honest. Draco crossed his arms and looked over to him, clearly unwilling to speak about it.
"Wait..." Draco was staring down at the paper in his hands "we have the upper hand right now, you and me"
When he looked up, Draco was smiling, even though his breathing was still erratic and Harry was sure they were both half hard still.
Also: what? Harry could not understand what made Draco so insecure. And with that, he realized a simple truth: Draco was jealous. Simple as that. Harry smiled at the realization.
Hermione was startled for a second, before opening her eyes wide. He opened his mouth and then closed it a couple of times, because his enthusiastic 'no' had been a clear 'yes' and now he was caught with no good explanation and no plan and Malfoy was going to be so angry when he found out they knew...
of the desks. Ron and Hermione, not surprisingly, sat together in front of them and the other two next to them. "We're here to talk about what happened, what progress have we made and what's our next step"
Going back to his bedroom would mean thinking the day over and over and possibly crying, so he made his way to the library. It was the worst time to be there, since almost all tables were already taken and he had no one to sit with. When had that stopped a Malfoy, though? With his head held as high as possible he walked towards a table at the far end, the one that was most secluded from the rest of the students.
"It is not like that, Father" Draco felt about to break, his magic a turmoil inside his body. He had always been excellent at hiding and controlling his emotions, but right then he was surprised he didn't shatter the cups on the table.
Harry turned around because not doing so would be foolish, she was already there and things were only going to get worse before they could get any better.
She touched his cheek "Yes, yes, you being... Gay. I will not lose my family... But this is not easy on your father, you must understand"
"What else?" He asked, in a tone that no one should use with a headmistress.Â  If McGonagall was annoyed by it, she didn't show.
Harry laughed loudly at that, trying to imagine Draco -and all the Malfoys- completely dying of heat but trying to keep their straight faces.
younger after all and he is not a Death Eater so I didn't really have a reason to know him well but... " Draco was breathing more slowly now, calming himself, it was amazing the level of control he had on his own body. Harry couldn't shake off his need yet, but he had a feeling the conversation would certainly cool him off. "When the war... When
"Dare" It came so quickly it almost scared him. Hm. Sirius would have been proud... The thought made him drink again.
Harry didn't linger at the train station for long, he never did. Why would he? No one to say goodbye to. No parents to hug before going back, no siblings. The place was packed with families saying goodbye and kissing and hugging and it made the holes in his chest a little bit bigger.
But what could he do? The only alternatives meant hurting his relationship with Harry and he didn't want that. He wasn't going to publicly make a scene where he insulted or mistreated Harry, and he wasn't going to go around pretending to be in love with Astoria. So the only other option was to embrace it. To... Be unapologetic.
"Auror Bell" McGonagall sounded annoyed at best, furious at worst "I'm afraid the only thing we have accomplish bringing you here is stress my students. I can handle this school on my own. I think it's time I have a chat with the Head of Aurors, Mr. Bell. Now please, I would like all of you to stop terrorizing the students"
At that, she turned with anger in her eyes "Oh, you are one to talk... Or are you not going to marry at all? I don't see you going against your family's wishes"
Harry wanted to say he wasn't so sure about that, but only nodded. He remembered all the times other people had told him he wasn't actually okay and yeah, it sucked.
Draco pulled his head back and had to bite down his lip to handle the way Harry looked. Disheveled and intense.
"I read a little bit about the castle and... you know, the old times" He knew better than to say 'when you died' "I... If you wanted to I could try and find your parents. They might still be alive" She got up, floating away from him and starting to sob. Draco imagined that was a horrible thing to remind her of, but he had to try. "If you wanted I could try to give them a message! I'm sure they miss you"
There was something soothing about a small space like that room, it made him feel safe and in control. Something he didn't feel in a crowd, or out in the open. Right there he couldn't be harmed, no one was going to jump at him. He was safe. But not alone. At least not this time.
"You have no idea" He whispered, his words a bit muffled against Harry's shirt. "Mother is... Nicer"
Harry turned, his wand barely illuminating a couple of meters ahead of himself. He could see two shapes, and his heart almost stopped. Feeling powerless wasn't something he enjoyed, and seeing someone he loved in a situation like this was... one of his worst nightmares.
âThey need something from the victims, or well, sacrifices. You are not missing a tooth or anything like that, right?â
There was a low sound in between kisses when Draco's back got pressed against the old wardrobe and Harry placed a hand next to his face, kissing him more deeply.
"S-so do you... like ice skating?" Draco spoke, and it was odd to hear him so nervous and insecure. Was this him out of his comfort zone? It definitely wasn't Harry's comfort zone. Touching other people? being warm and nice? Harry knew very little about that. He thought about Molly's hugs, and Hermione's and yeah that was lovely but it was different, wasn't it? Molly was the closest he had ever come to having a mother -even if it petrified him to say that out loud, for fear of being rejected by someone who already had a family- and Hermione was his friend, like a sister. This felt different.
Elliot nodded "She's not good. Apparently he told her he was capable of taking a curse that runs in her family off of her. And... other things"
"Feels like old times" Ron said with a smile, allowing Harry to cover both of them with the cloak as they made their way around the Castle trying to find a way in.
Draco was looking at him, with a serious expression trying very hard not to laugh at him. "Oh fuck off"
Draco took some courage from deep within him and turned to face him. The Gryffindor quickly - and awkwardly- pulled out a small tray with bread, cheeses and some grapes. It looked delicious, perhaps not a full meal but... It was perfect. Draco's heart was beating fast, his ribs barely containing it in.
The boy seemed surprised to be chosen but nodded, taking a sip before looking around. Harry held his breath, half hoping he wouldn't pick-
think we are getting weaker, losing our traditions and risking being discovered. And I do not plan on burning on a stake, Potter"
Harry had managed to enchant a piece of parchment -two, actually- to show the location of the room he had found. There had been a lot of repairs done to the school after the war, and some of the advantages of that were the empty rooms that weren't exactly finished. Or empty storage rooms that the wizards and witches had used to keep certain equipment. Apparently not everything could be done with magic.
"You wouldn't want to know" Astoria smiled a bit wider and placed a hand on Draco's shoulder "It's good to see you so happy"
"Just calm down" He said to himself, not quite sure as to how much time had passed. There were no sounds coming from the corridor, so he imagined he had been in there longer than expected.
"Enough" Harry groaned, grabbing at Draco's arm and making him walk towards the headmistress' office.
"Aha" Harry said in a teasing tone, following him inside. The room was small, clearly an old classroom or storage room that had been abandoned a long time ago. The posters on the walls were definitely Pansy's since he was pretty sure Draco had no interest in wizard rock bands or anything of the like. There was something like a bed filled with cushions taking over one of the corners and almost half of the space.
?" Draco looked down, a small frown on his face and then he chuckled, closing his eyes "Of course he did, of course he knew he was going to die while saying he could
"No, it's okay. I don't want to... think about that night. Not right now" Draco moved his arms, placing his hands on Harry's shoulders for lack of anywhere else to place them. He looked at him and there was a long pause, neither moved but they both wanted to. Harry knew what he wanted to do, it was a clear wish inside his head, but he was scared Draco would push him off. At least Draco was letting himself be hugged so maybe... maybe a kiss... only one, wouldn't hurt anyone. "He lied to you?" His question was a whisper and Harry didn't want to answer, didn't wish to think about that. Dumbledore had been important in his life, extremely so, and he knew he hadn't been
"Lumos" now that there was some light, Draco started walking towards one of the bookshelves, his slender fingers touching the back of one of the books. Harry couldn't see if it said something on the cover, since it was all black. Hell, all of them were black. This felt wrong. Terribly wrong.
âI know we should be ready but... we are not making any progress, are we? Whoever is doing this only has two more nights with the right moon phase or they'd have to wait one more monthâ
They had been left alone after Harry and Malfoy decided they should all meet after breakfast to try and find the symbols Noah drew. Of course Elliot noticed how Harry was going to spend the night in the Slytherin's bedroom but didn't comment. What they did or didn't do wasn't something he worried about.
"I know... But I meant, like, in the future" He moved closer to Draco, snuggling a bit against his hair. The slytherin intertwined their fingers, and he felt his heart skip a beat. He hoped this wasn't too much. Offering to live together had clearly crossed a line and Harry was petrified at the thought of coming on too strong again. His brain kept telling him Draco would get tired of him eventually, and if he kept pushing, that would be sooner rather than later.
"No, Potter, you are not right" His voice was shaking with anger. Fury, even. Yes, this was good. Harry wanted to be hit. Wanted to feel pain, he deserved it. Maybe this was why Draco had wanted
Draco became tense but relaxed after a couple of seconds, nodding against his shoulder. Was he tired of fighting? Did he believe it to be his fault so much so he wasn't able to even argue? "And you weren't going to do it, I was there. You were lowering your wand..."
Draco nodded and pulled out his wand, it was so simple he could hardly believe it was the right wand for him. Wasn't Draco a loud and attention-seeking brat? Harry almost wished he was the Draco he had painted in his mind so long ago, and not this really interesting young man.
She nodded and after giving Draco a small glance, she focused on the clouds and the night sky above Hogwarts. They should be helping Harry and Ron, they both should be outside and yet, here they were. Inside. Useless.
Harry laughed, slapping his back but pulling him closer. He didn't know if their five minutes were done or not, but he didn't want to let go of him, not when Draco felt like the one thing linking him to the real world.
There was a soft knock on the door and he turned, Aurors had been given rooms inside the castle to sleep in. Nothing fancy, of course.
âI betâ Draco moved towards him, not quite knowing what to do. His hand almost touched his arm, but he dropped it. âIf you think this is a good call then... I trust youâ
The map showed people walking all over Hogwarts, but no one around Draco. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Harry walked faster, avoiding groups of people and trying not to push past anyone. Being under the invisibility cloak felt amazing, he was capable of moving around without being seen, without being bothered. Sometimes he worried he would end up using it too much.
Draco left the boy's bathroom -he had gone to wash his face, trying to relax a bit- and decided to walk towards the Great Hall for dinner.
"Who's there?" The girl said, worried, shaking as she tried to sit upright. This was clearly different, all the other victims had been passed out, completely gone.
"And that's good, right? I'll always call you out on your... stupidity" Harry nodded, blushing when Draco's hand touched his cheek drying his tears. "It's alright"
A little voice in the back of his head told him to go back to his room and leave it be, but he ignored it.
Studying had been a priority all his life, and it had been put to the side for being around Potter and... He couldn't let that happen. Harry wasn't going to take care of him if he didn't find a suitable job, and having his side lost the war his chances were slim. The ministry was almost ruled out, unless some people there were still loyal to his father. Of course, that would mean
Something softened Draco's expression, making him uncross his arms and take a step forward. "Look, Potter, this is all very polite but there are things we are never going to leave behind. It's best if we accept that. Our... There is no future to this"
By the way, I know sometimes people don't like it when you add 'original characters', but I kinda had to for the plot! I hope you like them!
Harry had no clue what she was talking about. They had the potions test and then a couple hours to prepare for the Charms one and...
The door opened with a small cracking sound, and Harry stepped in, finding a burnt down room. There was nothing inside of it, not the bookcases they had seen, not a monster, nothing. Everything was burnt, the walls, and floor were dark and in the middle of it there was a drawing. Harry couldn't quite see it properly, but he was sure it was made with chalk and magic, the same one they had been searching in all of their books.
There was a sad expression on her face, almost as if she didn't want to tell him a hard truth. He had seen her like this a lot in his life, but it had usually been about silly things. "Have you spoken to them recently?"
And so Harry leaned in, taking Draco's lips in his own, his free hand sliding in between their bodies to feel his cock, to touch him so he could feel as good as he felt.
Finding a way to be together and still be who they were had been tricky, but they had agreed on having at least one meal alone together per week, and the rest of the days they would take turns dining on the Gryffindor or Slytherin table. The nights were equally complicated, with Draco wanting to abide by the rules and have them sleeping on their separate beds. Some nights were different though, and they found their way into each others' arms. Those were Harry's favorites.
"I don't think Malfoy is going to be joining us" Harry used a hand to rub his face. He had screwed up. And he knew he had to go and apologize.
"We know" Hermione was calm but firm "Is this the only place we have to talk?" they were up at the Astronomy Tower and Harry didn't feel like sharing their
He knew they should try and sleep as much as possible, but they didn't. Instead, they talked and laughed until the sun came up.
And that had been it. For almost a month, they both sat in the same place at night, staring at the same stars, as physically away as they could be.
Deep down he wished for it to be simple: to simply go to his parents and tell them the truth and not have it blow up in his face. He didn't want to give up his name or his family or... well, his money. It's not that he wanted
"Before that" Draco said, his voice low "the room was filled with books, and they were all about the same thing"
Astoria nodded, thoughtful "When you decide, I will see if I can help you. Will you tell me why this change of heart?"
Harry buried his face in his neck, shuddering and doing the most arousing sounds Draco had ever heard. He wanted to cause more of that. So much more.
Harry felt a bit proud for having planned it, and for how it had turned out "I... I think this is the first time I've had a good date"
Draco looked up, a bit surprised and startled and it truly made Harry's morning. The boy was impeccable from head to toes, dressed all in black as usual, his green and silver tie the only strong detail. Well, not the only one.
Draco nodded and started folding his parchment, as well as picking up his books. Neither said a word.
"Morning" Draco muttered without any feeling in his voice, the last few nights had left him drained. The nightmares were still there, but they were different. Voldemort and Nagini weren't the main attraction now, but Harry leaving him. Or dying. Or telling him how he could never love someone like Draco.
"Me too" The Slytherin finally said, his words calculated. Hermione could see he wasn't giving any information. He was secretive, closed off, cold. Was this what Harry wanted? She thought about Ginny and how different they were - in more ways than one.
At least his essay was done -not perfect as he wanted it, but kissing Harry had seemed much more interesting than getting that extra grade.
"What does it matter?" Malfoy stopped suddenly, turning around to face him. Harry had to give a step back. "They are calling in the aurors, Potter. It's pointless."
"Mr..." She started "Elliot" Her voice was sweet, comforting. She placed a hand on his shoulder "Do not allow anyone inside this room but me and professor McGonagall. Am I clear?"
"... I like it when you are honest" For some reason, Draco punched his shoulder. Not too harshly, of course, but it took him by surprise "Hey!"
Elliot wanted to get up and cuddle up next to Noah, but it wasn't like they were thirteen anymore. Back then they were friends and he had no weird feelings. Right now? If he moved closer, he would be wishing for a kiss.
"No, not us" He allowed a bit of honesty, knowing they were friends even if they tip toed around the information they were able to share with each other. "How's
Defeated, they made their way back to the Tower. It was getting late and nothing was going to come of it. The aurors were still running up and down the castle, blocking important places they could go. And Harry was still unsettled by the chat they had had with the new 'victim'.
Harry had heard people say he was a good teacher, and he took pride in that, but Draco was really...
"I'm just... I'm not ready. I'm eighteen... I've been doing what others wanted of me all my life and now that I have my freedom I... I just don't know what I want"
Bell tilted his head and laughed "Of course, I'm not keeping you here. But can I give you some advice, Draco?"
And then he pulled his shirt off and Draco couldn't stare into his eyes anymore. He was sure the air escaped his lungs as he sat as well, touching the skin that was all for him. With the warm light of the fireplace Harry was
"We need to talk about this" Narcissa finally spoke, staring at her husband in bed next to her. He pressed his lips into a thin line and moved to turn off the lights, but she quickly stopped him. They had been avoiding the topic all day. Draco hadn't left his bedroom, not even for diner and they were both slightly worried. Of course, Lucius was sure Draco was too tired from coming back from school and... their talk, but Narcissa was worried about his wellbeing.
It had been truly terrible, sitting there with all of those wizards giving him disapproving looks even after he had saved them all. He remembered showing up at Narcissa and Draco's trials because... well, because it wasn't fair for them to be judged like everyone else. He hadn't slept that day and his mind was foggy from the battle but people didn't care, didn't know. The only one that looked as jagged as he was had been Draco, sitting there and looking way too thin.
There was no point in delaying the moment, so with a heavy heart Draco started walking towards the living room.
Their breakfast resumed its usual rhythm, or at least the one it used to have before the war. They ate and talked and laughed. It was strange seeing Ron and Hermione together. He had always been a supporter of his friends, and known this is how they were going to end up. But still, weird.
She smiled again and made a small 'tsk' sound with her tongue, looking around. Noise came from the front of the pub, but everything seemed to be in order. Rosmerta made them a small 'wait' sign, before talking to one of her employees. When she came back to them, she seemed pleased.
Harry got up, that hadn't gone well but it could have been much, much worse "Sure. Meet us tonight after dinner to talk more?"
Getting inside was tricky, because he had to press as much as he could against the professor while trying not to touch him or anyone.
about him and he was a bit embarrassed by it. Yes, he didn't know essential things about Draco, but he had observed him so much on their sixth year that he did know
attacked Bea and he didn't know what to do. Pomfrey had come to his bedroom and given Noah a sleeping draught, to help him calm down. They had moved all of Elliot's roommates to another bedroom to make sure Noah would get enough rest.
âIt always is. My parents weren't happy at all. At first they had no idea what I was telling them. They went through all the stages...â
had, but it was... too much, too hard. Sometimes cleaning brought him back memories or Privet Drive, of a time were cleaning was the only thing he was allowed without being punished for existing.
"I guess"Â  Harry imitated him, laying on almost the same position "I don't care about money. I know it's important to live, but I have lived without it most of my life"
"You have gone through a traumatic experience, yes, we've been told" Lucius said, almost dismissively, his eyes on both of them. Harry could see his anger, but something more in there as well. He was sure their expressions were similar to the ones they had had during the Battle, while they desperately tried to find their son. For a split second, Harry thought they were going to rush in and hug Draco. They didn't.
"Your mother and I believe we could be able to find a good pure blood girl, one that no one wants to marry. She could allow you to have a child and we would pay her a good amount for-"
There was a sigh and Draco carefully folded the piece of parchment, placing it between two books before sending them all flying into his bag. Then, he laid down next to him.
Draco moved his hand to his pants' pocket, almost as if searching for his wand and the kid bolted. He saw him run out of the library. Draco closed his eyes, breathing again. Thank Merlin that the student hadn't known he didn't even have his wand.
Harry wanted to say he had no idea how something like that could make a wizard more powerful, but truth was he had had special abilities thanks to his past connection to Voldemort so... that was the one part he understood.
It was weird how gentle he was for a guy, how caring. Harry'd have imagined him to be rough and maybe cold, but Draco was loving and soft and sweet and everything he needed to feel warmth inside his chest. He knew it made no sense. And it wasn't fair how fast his heart was beating, or how his skin was starting to burn with desire.
Draco looked back at him, almost at a loss. It was hard seeing him like this, disconnected from his emotions. Harry was sure he had more than one good, happy memory, but somehow Draco seemed unable to find them.
âOf course I-â The door swung open and two familiar faces came running in. Ron looked even more disheveled than usual, and Hermione was carrying a pile of books â a normal amount, by her standards.
His eyes fell on the blonde again and anger bubbled inside of him. Malfoy looked tired yet calm. It wasn't fair.
Harry truly wanted to say everything would be alright but he wasn't sure. At the beginning of the year he had read that book about pure blood families and he had found out how strict they were. He had seen the things for which they would disown someone. And he could only imagine that loving someone of your same gender would be enough to get you burnt from the family tree.
Draco looked at her, confusion written all over his face. He probably wasn't used to people doing kind things for him without expecting anything in return. Harry only smiled back, feeling a bit bad for not being able to plan a better date.
"I-... Thank you" Draco wasn't sure he wanted to work there at all, but it was better than nothing "I still don't know what I wish to do. Freedom is... An odd concept, don't you think?"
"Don't give me the whole hero of the wizarding world shit, Malfoy" Harry didn't want to sound angst-y but he didn't feel exactly great at the moment and the idea of Malfoy seeing him like a
With a brief sigh, he pushed forward into the party, scanning the room for both his parents. The last words they spoke to each other in person hadn't been the best and he wasn't sure if he should apologize or not. If he thought too much about it, his head started to hurt.
"Why are you asking me that? You can just say what you think" Harry wanted to reach out and touch his arm, but didn't "Just speak"
"If anything goes wrong or if you feel threatened by the prisoner, there'll be aurors outside the house"
And then he stared at him, as if he had only said he liked cats and ice cream and bunnies. He had just... Harry tried to remember what he knew about him or... what he didn't. Lucius Malfoy was a death eater so it would only be reasonable to assume his son had followed in his steps.
The mattress dipped for a moment and he opened his eyes to stare at the movement, the boy had turned and was staring at him. In the dark there were no grey eyes, only a glimmer in the shadows.
He relaxed, a little voice telling him she wasn't the enemy. Or at least she didn't seem to be. Things could change, but for now they seemed... more accepting than any other pure blood family.
The door opened and they both stared as the young girl rushed to Bell's side, carrying vials in her hands. Harry wanted to scream, the vials were filled with dark red liquid.
He thought about his parents, how in love they had been when they left Hogwarts. Perhaps this was like that. Either way, Harry had started to feel they were a team.
Draco swallowed hard, grabbing at his school bag with trembling hands and ignoring the other eyes on him. The first few steps were slow, but after a moment or two he... Practically ran from the library, a horrible sensation on the pit of his stomach. He wanted to puke. Merlin.
"Of course we will" Draco said, looking back at Elliot "I was about to go talk to Myrtle. Would you like to come with?"
Draco reached for one of his books when realization hit him. It wasn't as clear as he wanted to and it didn't make him feel as good as he hoped. Across the room, Bell was talking to Elliot and guiding him outside of the classroom.
"No, we can't" his voice was hoarse and Harry wondered if he had been crying. Was he covering his face because of that?
And him... well, let's just say that the first time he went in public and had a panic attack it ended up on every single newspaper. At least back here, even if he didn't feel protected and had nightmares every night, people would leave him be. And he had his friends. He wouldn't be alone.
"I mean..." Draco moved to see him, propping his head on one of his hands. "would it be just us? Or, you know, uhm... Pets?"
Suddenly the air decided not to go inside his lungs. He was inside a maze again. A dark maze. He was in a maze with another boy. Two of them, again.
Walking back to Slytherin he carefully avoided hallways crowded with people, he had investigated the castle enough during sixth year to know where to go if he wanted to be sneaky. He still wondered how Harry managed to... Find him so many times that year. Hm, maybe he could ask him.
He pulled the piece of parchment from the envelope and straightened it, trying to keep his heartbeat normal.
Draco folded the pieces of parchment he had been using to write his notes and placed everything inside his bag. The worst part about zoning out was how fast time seemed to go by, how fast and yet how slow he was. He got up from his place, students leaving the classroom as fast as possible.
Maybe this, maybe that. The one thing he really knew was that every time he got a glimpse of Draco he wanted to do it all over again.
"I am starving" He said, and sat down next to his friends with a smile. Both Hermione and Ron were extremely pleased with how he was behaving lately and... He was as well. Nothing had changed, not really, but perhaps all he needed was time. Time to heal.
"They made me sleep under the stairs, in a really small... thing. I used my cousin's old clothes. They never fit well. I had no toys, nothing was mine in there. They always told me to pretend like I didn't exist" It was almost as if he couldn't stop now that he was saying all of this "They never hit me. They would shove me, or tell me I was nothing. Once I broke my arm and it took them t-..."
Harry leaned in, kissing him very softly. The other boy kissed back, and for a couple moments nothing else mattered in the whole world. Harry could understand why Draco didn't want to be vulnerable, he felt the same way sometimes.
"We are not doing that" Harry whispered, but he wasn't sure. "We talked, we-... we are going to fix things" He gave a step forward, placing a hand on Draco's cheek "We'll fix it"
There was a groan, and Harry got up from the tree trunk. They would have to go back inside sooner rather than later.
and brewing potions out of school. No surprise he was so annoyed at Hermione's grades. Hell, she would probably be pissed if he were the best one in class.
Lucius was staring at him, his long blond hair loose. Draco never allowed his own hair to get that long, the idea of looking more like his father...
There was another silence, -because everything between them seemed to happen in between silences- until a low familiar voice spoke.
Harry sighed and let go of her hand, touching his forehead but nothing hurt. Voldemort was dead and he had to get used to it.
Everyone's eyes were on Draco and it clearly made him a bit self conscious but he didn't allow that to stop him.
"Nothing. My three facts: I read muggle books, I actually liked aunt Andromeda as a kid, and I still have the same beliefs"
And not only the cities, he wanted to hold his hand and walk through some lost forest in the middle of nowhere. He wanted to hold his hand without a care in the world, surrounded by shades of deep green, both of them suspended in time. That's how he felt in the woods.
"Uh, I kind of... wanted to talk to you" Elliot said, barely raising his voice above the murmur in the Hall. They were sitting in the Hufflepuff table. Where to sit had never been a problem for them, not really. They would dine at Hufflepuff's or Slytherin's and if anyone had a problem with it then fuck them.
"No" Harry answered so quickly he surprised himself. Sometimes he forgot simple mundane things were not so simple nor clear for Draco. His parents had fucked his world view so much for so many years that Harry wondered if he would ever recover. Of course he had changed, and his views as well, but would he ever get rid of all the emotional hurt?
Draco said nothing but Harry could tell his whole body said 'oh really?'. One day he would change Draco's mind about aurors, but that day wasn't anywhere near their present.
Their last sleepover had been... So long ago. Before the war, during the holidays. Their families had always been very supportive of their friendship, even if they were fundamentally different. Elliot had been raised by wizards, and Noah had been raised in the muggle world (his mother was a witch, his dad a muggle). It made no difference to them, well, the only difference was that Noah knew what a television was and Elliot had had no idea when they met.
"And placing him in front of absolutely everyone in this school with a little bow that screams 'Malfoy' is not your style either. You are clever, you would have retaliated in a private, more personal way, I guess" Malfoy looked amused by that and clearly tried to suppress a smirk. "So yeah, I don't think you did that. You might've, but I don't think so, no"
"You are quiet"Â  Draco whispered, hands on his pockets ever since leaving the lake. Was he afraid Harry was going to try and take his hand again? Was he disgusted?
"Yes I do" His voice was shaking, and he sat not turning on the lights. He didn't want to see his face while talking about this. "I know families don't throw people out for things like marrying a muggle or whatever"
"Fine" Harry finally said, because his curiosity was screaming inside his head and he couldn't handle it when it was about Draco.
Harry's answer was a small kiss on the top of his head, pulling him a bit closer to his body. There was something indescribable about being in between his arms, so he moved closer despite his better judgment.
"You and I... I don't know how long this will last... And I'm not used to being so open with someone... I wanted to regain some control over this"
They weren't hungry like the night before, just soft, caring. Draco was sure he had never felt... So much love for someone as he did in that moment. He remembered something his father had told him once about Narcissa, how she had made his life bright, so much so it sometimes scared him. Draco had been young at the time -so young- but the words stuck, and now he understood. Sadly, he doubted Lucius was the father he had idealized during his childhood. Had that man ever existed? Yes, he had been cruel at times, harsh more than caring but he had loved him, had he not?
Great. Now he was fucking moody. Harry pursed his lips and decided to leave, he didn't know how to deal with Malfoy and honestly he didn't want to. What was the real reason they were playing that game or even going up there? He couldn't trust Malfoy, he couldn't.
rude to them. The check ins were daily, and some stayed outside to protect them. The Ministry had assured them this was only during the first two years, to make sure no one would hurt them. Narcissa knew the reality was they didn't want them to escape. Why would they? They weren't born to live as fugitives.
Draco looked at him, with an expression he hadn't seen before. It was sadness, but something else. Something Harry couldn't put his finger on.
Draco's breathing hitched and he closed his eyes, barely relaxing the hand on his shoulder. He didn't seem in pain but there was a frown on his face. Harry kissed his neck, in the places he knew he loved, while his hand moved in between his legs, trying to make him moan again. There was no guide for this, but he felt like he knew what he was doing. Some of his Gryffindor pride, perhaps.
"Granger. Weasley" Draco said before sitting next to Granger, leaving a space for Harry in front of him and next to Ron. Harry wondered if he didn't really mind Hermione anymore, or if he truly hated Ron more than her. Or maybe it meant nothing.
"Shut up" Harry drank too, feeling the strong taste burn through his tongue and throat, leaving a warm sensation after. It was nice. Now that Voldemort was dead and no one was actively trying to kill him perhaps getting drunk would be fun. At least once. It wasn't going to happen that night though, definitely not.
A warm fluttering feeling moved through Harry's chest. Was it having someone else in the world to talk to? Was it not feeling completely alone and forgotten? Or was it because it was Malfoy? He had no clue, but he felt good.
The first class they shared after the talk on the Tower was potions, because of course it was. Harry had no idea why he was taking it, maybe without Snape - he thought- he would actually learn something, but so far it had been pointless.
It was clear the slytherin was trying to make him feel better, to make him smile or laugh. Harry felt wrecked.
-via Ron and Draco- that she had figured out what was going on between him and the slytherin. Of course it was one thing to suspect and another to have confirmation.
"I know you are only sleeping because of the potion" He whispered, but didn't dare to hold his hand. That was for... boyfriends and family members and he was neither. What was he, anyways? Just a friend, at best. "But you have to wake up... alright? This school sucks without you" Elliot bit down on his lower lip and looked around the room, Pomfrey was supposed to check on him "You know I'm bad with words" He whispered, not sure if he was hearing him or if he was just making a fool of himself. Both? Probably both.
Lucius Malfoy was a dangerous topic. They shared no love, and it was clear Draco loved his father. He doubted he'd ever understand why.
The castle was already in view, but neither seemed to want to rush in even if the silence became tense and weird.
"How's Ginny?" Harry finally asked, looking at Hermione for answers. It was one thing being friends, but it was another trying to be friends with someone that had feelings for him, someone he had probably hurt.
Ron was clearly having a bad day, and he couldn't blame him. Not after all he had lost. After what everyone had lost. Harry knew exactly what loss was, it was all he knew. Draco got up, looking like a statue: cold and unreachable.
Everyone seemed to tense up when he was included in the conversation, so he focused on eating. That way everyone could go back to what they were doing and ignore him again.
The others nodded, nobody wanting to draw attention to their little gathering. As they all started to disperse, Harry gave him a look. They hadn't been able to talk about what had happened the night before, but he didn't want to.
"You didn't want to come back" Malfoy said, this time more serious "That's obvious" Potter sighed, what was the point of this, again?
"No. It's filled with the same book, this is not a library" Draco pulled some more books and let them fall to the ground, leaving breadcrumbs for them.
Harry pressed his lips together feeling curiosity creep up on him. It was impossible not to feel like that. Since sixth year he had wondered why he had such an interest in Malfoy. Yes, that time he had followed him around with a good cause and he had been completely justified but even he knew now how
"I think he's at the Tower now"Â  Ron said, shrugging but it was clear they were trying to leave Harry alone. Or maybe Harry was avoiding them. Or... something. Noah had no time for other people's drama.
He had realized how hard it was for the savior of the Wizarding World to make simple choices about their home. To remedy that he had gotten a much more direct approach. Usually, he would pick two or three things he liked, and then he would make Harry choose one.
Hermione looked annoyed at him "We studied that, Harry. Transfigurations? How are you planning on passing this year's exams?" Silence. She gave him a disapproving look "Nothing can create food or a living thing. You can transfigurate a living thing into something else but not the other way around. It's one of the laws of transfiguration"
She sobbed, loudly and frantically. Her pain knew no ends, really, and Draco wanted to do something more. Try and soothe her or say the right words, but he never had the right words. Well, he knew what to say to Harry but... that had ended badly anyways.
He had lived most of his childhood and teenage years in fancy dinners and balls and parties. He knew about gossip and manipulation and overindulgence.
help the heat on his skin. He kissed him again, biting this time, pulling at his lips and doing everything that came to mind. And what came to mind next was Draco's skin. Without thinking, he let go of his lips, catching a glimpse of how swollen they looked and moved a bit down, to his neck.
There were more people in the common room than he would have liked, without making eye contact with anyone he walked quickly to his bedroom. He needed the comfort of his bed, and the soft green shimmer from the lake. Draco's heartbeat was quickening, afraid of closing his eyes and seeing the face of that man again. He had tried very hard not to be haunted anymore by what had happened during the war, he had even stopped seeing Voldemort's face before falling asleep, and he was afraid that what had happened that night would hinder all of his progress. What if now he started to dream about being tied up to that chair? Or about the things Bell told him
"Of course not, Potter. I still think it's giving us what we need, in its own way... " Draco allowed his fingers to touch the rows of books while they walked "You know, when I used the Room... it let me do what I had to do, even if it was... a terrible thing. It didn't punish me then. Why would it punish us now? The only explanation for this is that it's hurt and it is not working properly. Or the magic is corrupt"
Harry didn't know if he had hit his head or if Draco was speaking a different language but he wasn't being clear. Not at all "You... Faked...?"
"No, it's not. He could still be a potential victim and... I don't know what his parents were thinking sending him back" Draco shrugged, parents was something they hadn't discussed at all. Hell, the only thing they had talked was how Draco's mum was going insane with the whole house arrest and no magic thing. "If he works with us, maybe we could protect him too"
Harry moved back as if he had been punched by his own words. His whole body tilted forward, trying to hug himself, trying to cover the deep wound that was inside his chest -the one no one could see. He didn't want to cry, he really didn't and he didn't feel like he was going to cry. He felt something much worse: he felt as if he was going to scream and break absolutely everything in that room.
Perhaps he should just close his eyes and doze off... No, that would be a terrible idea, falling asleep with him would mean that Malfoy would hear his screams and probably get a good idea of what his nightmares were all about and he could not allow that to happen.
"Excellent" She looked over at Malfoy for a moment and then back at him "Just you and me, okay?" And then she kissed his cheek. Harry could
Harry rolled his eyed, but smiled at him. That had sounded very much like the old Draco, which probably meant he was nervous or terrified. Or both.
He wanted his godfather, he wanted Fred, he wanted all of them back. His hand had left Draco's at his request. It would be easier for him to get inside the house on his own, and he knew Draco felt unwanted there. Which probably was the case from some of the Weasleys but not all of them.
"For me" There was something in the way Draco said it that made Harry want to deny it, he didn't "Yes, I know"
He took a deep breath and moved away from both of them, trying to focus his attention on the ingredients covering the classroom's walls. Potions had interested him once, the first day of class, and then it had been the worst class. Harry pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes, and for a second he was sure Draco was going to go talk to him but the classroom's door opened and everyone turned their attention to the new arrivals.
Narcissa, but he felt some sort of respect for her. She had been willing to do what his mother had done many years before, in a way. And he had no doubt in his mind she would die for Draco. He wasn't so sure about Lucius.
He knew better than to say 'no', so he simply closed the book and got up, feeling like a zombie. His father started walking towards the backdoor, to the garden, and he followed. He tried to keep himself calm, focus his thoughts but... It was hard. He had too many skeletons in his closet, too many regrets and he had too much to think about. His whole future was a blur.
Draco moved his fingers over Harry's but said nothing else. Had he heard his nightmare? Did he care? Harry closed his eyes and hugged him tighter, not really wanting to hold back. He... Had needed to touch someone. To be hugged. And his mind was foggy with sleep.
"I don't really eat that much. We were on the road for a while and there wasn't much to eat, really"
"Mr. Malfoy will spend the night here, no one can leave the dormitories. It's an order. There will be aurors stationed outside every house in case some of you need something"
Maybe, deep down, he had hoped all of this were done in an attempt to take a curse off of someone. Maybe if that had been the case he would have been able to sympathize.
âShut up, Ron. I make my own choicesâ She walked to them, and stared at every single one âAlright, who's going to tell me what I missed?â
Harry had been waiting almost all of his free period for Draco, and he was starting to believe the boy wasn't going to come. Why? Had anything happened? Harry was pretty sure they were boyfriends and things had been perfect that morning -and the night before-. Draco wouldn't get cold feet, would he? Harry bit his lip and paced around the empty classroom.
He didn't want to feel scared again, he didn't want to hold his breath expecting people to say nasty things at him. What if they try to hex him? He didn't have his wand outside of class, he wouldn't be able to defend himself!
Harry stared and he realized they weren't exactly moving. Tsk. He wasn't going to make it easy, was he?
Malfoy chuckled and threw himself on the bed, half sitting. "Sure, Potter. Merlin, can you relax? It's not so bad. At least she didn't mention Elliot. Clearly she has no idea what we are doing" He looked down to his hands, playing softly with the crumpled sheets.
was one of those people. He had been worried about Bea for a couple days, until her parents took her off the school to take care of her. And he had cared about Elliot, really, but they had never been friends. So after a couple weeks everyone went back to their usual schedules, sharing a simple
"And you wondered why you took so long doing all the things you did" He said, but only looking at Harry. It almost felt like Draco would only talk directly to him.
And like that the group dissolved. The headmistress disappeared with Pomfrey inside the Infirmary and the teachers all left, probably to their own bedrooms. But this wasn't enough, he... he needed to know what they were talking. Harry gritted his teeth, he didn't know who to follow, or who would have the best information available.
The living room walls were already painted and clean, which made it the first room to decorate. Harry had promised him painting walls without magic wasn't as horrible or dirty as he thought it was, and was going to teach him how to do it. Getting his clothes and skin stained with paint wasn't something Draco was waiting for, so he had made them start with the easy rooms first.
They would have to be very careful, unless they wanted to get caught and end up... Harry had a brief realization: what could they do to him? Expel him? McGonagall was a fair woman, and she would probably punish him just like any other student, but it didn't matter to him anymore.
They walked with her back to the kitchen, where she stood with her hands on her hips, giving them a look. Harry realized he had no idea if she had children or a husband or, well, a wife.
"I'm just... It's not what people might think" He moved a bit closer, staring at him "I haven't been in a room so full of people in a while, what if I-...?"
Fear struck at his stomach and he started closing his books and notes, like a scared cat. It made his cheeks grow slightly pink, how come he was being humiliated like this and couldn't retaliate?
"Sorry, it's... I move a lot now" Elliot tried, laying down again and turning so his back would be to him. It was better this way, if he closed his eyes he could almost pretend he was alone in his room.
Harry gave a step forward, but he could see it in his eyes: he didn't care about Draco. He was willing to hurt whoever he had to hurt. That was the slight difference between Voldemort and his followers. Back in the day, Harry knew Voldemort would kill whoever stood in his path but his objective had
"Nah, it's fine" Harry nodded, and grabbed both the bowl and Draco's arm, pulling them to the living room again.
"It's not alive" Draco said, standing straight and looking at the thing "Nothing will truly hurt it"
With everything that had happened he couldn't risk it. Not for someone that was a stranger. For Elliot? Or Bea? Maybe.
There will be another chapter tomorrow, but it will be a short one. I thought about putting both up tonight but I wont have the time to check the spelling and stuff.
"He's around, don't worry about it" She placed a hand on his arm, standing next to him and looking around the room. It was filled with good looking people, some he knew, most of them complete strangers. On the other side, Harry looked nervous as he waited for two drinks to be made for him. Draco wanted to walk to him, place a hand on his back and let him know that everything was alright. That they were alright.
Draco's eyes showed everything, he clearly understood what Harry was referencing and was clearly affected by it was well. That was a bit surprising.
What if the love his parents had for him wasn't enough? Having a gay son was not in their plans, he knew that, but... perhaps...
Gryffindor Tower had never felt so far away, the door had never opened oh so slowly and Harry had never gone up the stairs to his bedroom so fast. He opened the Marauder's map and scanned every room trying to find him, but he wasn't there.
An uncomfortable silence fell between them and Harry started to feel anxious and awkward. He quickly sat up, knees pressed to his chest like he had seen Draco do so many times during all those nights together and how he had done all those years living under the stairs. Maybe he should just leave, forget that night ever happened and go back to his room, fall asleep, have nightmares, rinse and repeat.
Harry nodded, speechless and a bit surprised at his words. Of course, something inside of his brain was screaming that he had never tried to appease anyone, that he didn't care about his heroics, but he knew it was a lie. Perhaps he had tried to prove he was... worth something. Perhaps he was still trying to prove it.
Before Draco could finish his sentence, the books started to fall. But they weren't just falling from the shelves, they were being thrown at them with such force it would leave bruises on their skins. Harry tried to cover himself with his hands at first, before creating a magic shield around them. The books tried to break it but failed.
"Wait" Draco moved a hand, pulling at some of the blankets Harry had placed on the floor for them and used it to cover both of them with it. Harry didn't complain, kissing him on the lips again and trying to undo his pants, clearly fighting with the first button.
Again, something like marriage seemed to be too much too soon. But they weren't getting married, were they?
"I am aware, Harry" He closed his eyes, tired. They were laying side by side, but not close enough. Harry wanted to be closer. "I don't hate him, not really. I just... He knows my 'secret', he mocks me. He hasn't said a word but he
Harry smiled even if his attempt at making him feel better failed "I guess I just want my life out of them, you know?"
âYes, Hermione and Ron will keep an eye on Beatrice. Noah and Ginny will look after Elliot. And you two will try to find the place where this is going to happenâ
Draco, without knowing about that but realizing something was wrong, moved a hand through his chest to calm him down. He failed, but at least he distracted his thoughts enough to allow Harry to finish speaking.
"What the fuck are you talking about?" He frowned "Is this what your father told you? We agreed we were going to write to each other!"
Harry was kissing him, but he couldn't concentrate long enough, his breathing quick and shallow. In a moment of clarity -and need- he ran a hand down Harry's chest and down, down feeling the little trail of hairs and... He didn't want to touch over the clothes, he wanted...
The auror laughed at him "Young love, truly adorable" He got up, walking across the room and opening some strange books. "Don't worry, even if he manages to resist... I'll still get my way. I have done so this far, have I not?" He chuckled "Did you know I was stationed in Bea's house after the war? A lovely family, they really trusted me with their daughter"
Draco looked away from him, but he didn't look sad, he looked furious. Almost as if he were trying to restrain himself from cursing the man.
...!" Draco stopped, looked at him... and started laughing with him. It was ridiculous how exhilarated he felt for something like that. Harry wanted... He wanted so many things. Somewhere, deep down inside of him, his younger self couldn't believe someone loved him. Truly loved him.
He left a hand on his wrists, moving down to kiss his neck, feeling his short breaths and quiet sounds. There was something incredibly special about Draco giving in, asking nothing in return. Perhaps his brain was as shut down as his own.
"I hope you are not dragging anyone into this, Potter" She said, staring at him coldly. He knew she was a nice woman, but Minerva could really scare someone.
There was silence between them, thick again and uncomfortable. Harry hated when it went like this. Draco swallowed, opening his fists and looking down for a moment. He was... Harry couldn't tell what he was feeling.
Elliot wasn't looking at them or the papers, he was looking at some far away point. Was talking about the attack too much for him? Harry could imagine how hard it was.
A long pause, Harry groaned causing them both to chuckle and break the awkward silence. They could all disagree about his friendship with Malfoy
"If you get it wrong, then you won't know which one is a lie. I would drink if you had anything on you but I assume you don't have any alcohol?" Silence "Of course not, why would you?"
Draco didn't go back with him, which was to be expected really. How could he ask him to face Ron after that incident? It would be insensitive. It was already hard for himself to do this.
Harry knew Narcissa had no love for him or his friends, but he owed her and... She had always seemed to be a good mother to Draco. And that's what mattered, right? For a moment he wondered if she was marked too, ugh, he was going to be sick.
No, she surely had a partner. There was no way she would just appear outside their door right after what had happened. There was no way.
Harry wanted to say how sorry he was for reacting like that, and how much he wanted to know what was going on. He also wanted to know if Draco had been avoiding him, if everything was good between them.
"He was with me" Harry quickly chimed in, worried this would escalate. The thought of Draco not being allowed a day off was... troubling, and it made Harry angry. Really angry. "Nothing happened"
Harry sat next to him. They were both tired, waking up at five in the morning to try and train a bit before everyone got up was... exhausting. But it was worth it.
Noah seemed completely surprised, both eyebrows raised and a small 'o' for a mouth. Elliot wasn't someone who would blush or hide or anything like that, but right now he felt like cowering underneath the table. He wasn't sure if anyone else was eavesdropping in their chat, but he didn't care. Not really. He -they, actually- had never been too social. It had always been both of them against, well, the world.
So Harry had gone to see Elliot, who seemed incredibly pissed at the world. Their talk had been short, Harry asked where Draco was and Elliot said he had no idea, and something a bit rude about him. Which prompted Harry to lose some of his patience and ask where he had seen him last.
"I won't hurt you" Harry whispered, pressing a kiss on his shoulder, squeezing him a bit tighter. "You don't have to protect yourself from me"
"Tired, Draco? Tsk, and here I thought we were having a good time" Bell ran a hand through Draco's hair again and Harry was, without a shadow of doubt, going to harm him.
"Thank you" Draco said, being polite to the auror assigned to make sure he would make it to his home from school. He would have liked to have been able to say goodbye to Harry, but he had had to leave before all the other students, just to be able to use McGonagall's fireplace. It had hurt to leave like that, without a warning or anything. They gave him his grades and then he had to leave. It was a cold reminder that there had been a trial, and he was 'serving time'. One way or another.
Harry looked up, wanting to know if this was okay, if Draco was okay. There was a nod, and a small smile, and then they kissed again.
"Hey, Harry" Ginny smiled at him, sitting next to him during dinner. "We missed you during New Years"
Harry tried to understand, but he couldn't, so he simply placed a hand on his lower back and waited for clarification.
They both knew this would be hard, they had discussed it the night before as they cuddled in their double bed. It was shortly before midnight when he brought it up, them going to the party and what it would mean.
This was not going to go well, but it had to, or they wouldn't be able to help and Harry wasn't sure how he would take that.
"Not while being a student, Mr. Malfoy" She gave him a look that would intimidate anyone, but Draco kept his bored expression. This was the Draco he knew, and it made him glad to see him back. Even if he didn't have his wand, or his prestige anymore. "Do I need to remind you that you are on house arrest? I could-"
Malfoy seemed to think about it, frowning with his eyes closed but he shook his head "Maybe. I have been in a lot of houses"
make a face or say something against his father, he wanted to. He really wanted to. He hated the lot of them, all of those murderers and fascists.
. He recalled the whole world acting as if nothing had happened after Cedric's death. Or Sirius'. Not everyone, of course, but those who weren't involved? It was like they didn't even know what had happened, like they didn't care.
"Alright, that was unexpected" Draco chuckled pressing himself closer to Harry "Do muggles do that?"
Potter bit the inside of his lip quite hard, knowing they were touching dangerous territory and it would only ruin the one moment he felt at peace. Damn it.
Ah. Harry nodded, still trying to focus his eyes -he was going to end up with a head ache but he really wanted to know him more. And he... Maybe it was time to let someone else know him as well? He was terrible at sharing anything about his life, or his feelings or dreams... Did he have any dreams? Merlin, he had tried not to have any as a child but they had been there. At first his dreams were all about leaving the Dursleys, maybe having a nice job and a little house. After discovering the wizarding world, his dreams had been much more loud, giving him hope for the future. At least for a while. At least until Sirius died.
Draco cleared his throat, clearly realizing he was distracted and Harry decided he had to come up with an excuse. There were things too shameful to say out loud. Luckily, there was a couple furiously making out in one of the far corners of the room.
"And we are doing this because someone, kind of, targeted Malfoy" She was trying hard not to smirk and Harry wanted the earth to swallow him whole. "But now you are kind of thinking that had nothing to do with anything"
The bedroom was still light up, and even though they were behind thick curtains, they could clearly see each other. This wasn't like last time, when they had been safe in the dark. Draco didn't seem bothered by it, moving his hands through his chest and back as if he was feeling the world for the first time.
"We are alive. But I-... I suppose I can see your point" he sighed "And of course I love him, Narcissa. Just because I don't approve of this doesn't mean I suddenly hate him"
Draco didn't know what to say. He didn't know if that was true, or if it was another way to manipulate him, to coerce him into agreeing to something he didn't want to do. So instead, he kept quiet, tense, staring at the letter in his lap with a seal and handwriting he recognized almost instantly.
Dinner was brief but civilized. Draco was tempted to ask who cooked, but preferred not to. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't feel like the one the house elves produced back at the Manor.
"I just knew. Always known, actually" He was whispering, clutching at his hand now. "It's just something you feel"
"I met them, Draco. Neville was ashamed, I guess he still is... I respected him so much more after that" The blond said nothing and Harry didn't push, they were both shaken by the mixture of pleasure followed by the despair that seemed to rule their lives.
They had been foolish. They shouldn't have done this alone. Harry looked around, trying to find a way to save both of them. Hells, he even wanted to help Bea. She was only a kid.
"I can't just..." Draco groaned and looked back at him, frowning "People already think it's weird we are friends and once they know they'll think I'm only trying to influence you and-"
Harry opened his eyes to find a hand on his face. He wondered how that had happened, they had talked almost all night long in what Harry could only describe as a game of verbal chess. They both wanted to know more about the other giving as little information about themselves as possible. Draco was reallyÂ  hermetic about his feelings and experiences and Harry simply wouldn't open his whole soul to someone that wasn't going to do the same. But it had been fun, Harry had laughed and slowly forgotten about the kid that got attacked or the idea of aurors detaining Draco for something he, surely, hadn't done.
Oh. Of course. Harry wanted to slap himself for being so stupid. Draco wasn't talking about pure blood relations, he was just hurt at his dig at his Mother's family.
. He will tell me how disappointed he is, how he's never been proud of me, how disgusting I am" Draco sounded broken, his voice a small whisper as if he had tried to hide his pain for too long. He knew this was one of those important things you don't speak with a stranger. So he quickly sat upright, reaching out and finding his glasses. Harry put them on again and focused on Draco. The boy was looking down, frowning at the sheets "He'll probably tell me I won't have my inheritance or their support if I..." he closed his eyes "Mother will be silent. She usually is. Once it's all said and done she will tell me to go clean up and never speak of it again"
Walking back towards the castle Harry realized he had to come to terms with what was happening to him. It wasn't just that he wanted to be friends with Draco, was it?
Malfoy moved his arm away from his eyes and stared at the ceiling. Harry had never wished so much to know what someone else was thinking until that moment.
He had gone up there to face his own demons, he had gone up there because his own bedroom felt small and crowded and even though he had never minded small and crowded places, right now he needed to be alone. Maybe the war had changed him beyond repair.
"Don't you fucking touch him" Draco stared at him, and even though he was sitting just as he was, he seemed ready to jump at him.
"One of the aurors helped him, it's fine" Ron said, pulling Hermione close "I'm sure he forgot about it already"
Harry Potter's friends shared a look and then stared at him. It was a bit creepy how they understood each other. Noah wondered if he and Elliot looked like that sometimes.
Elliot nodded laying back on the couch, of course he was going to wait for Noah. He didn't like going to class on his own, really. Not since the attack. He had tried to disguise it as being a good friend or whatever, but truth was he felt his heart quicken every time he turned a corner.
Narcissa sat right next to him, placing a hand on his back and rubbing it softly "I can't convince you to change your mind, can I?"
That was enough. Harry grabbed at his shirt, raising a fisted hand ready to punch him right in his smug face. Malfoy kept his eyes locked in his not even flinching at his violence and that alone made Harry feel... weird. Like a
His free arm kept Harry close, so close. He needed to feel him on top of him and around him and all over. He was coming undone and he needed Harry to keep him grounded, to keep him
"You are really good, Harry" She moved a bit closer and placed a kiss on his cheek "You don't deserve to be alone right now..." She smiled and grabbed his arm again "Let's sit by the lake?"
True, the house needed repairs and that was the one thing that helped him get through the days, although he wasn't putting any true effort in them.
Harry frowned, she was being... incredibly unusual. Maybe it had been a suicide attempt, and they were bothering the poor girl. No. It couldn't be... could it? He remembered her of something, of somewhere but he couldn't put his finger on it.
" Draco didn't look at anyone "You have to figure it out on your own, or trick someone to tell you. Haven't you learned anything?"
"I-..." Harry had had a small fear their talk would go there "I have thought about it, yes. I almost didn't come back, thought about working with Kingsley"
Harry nodded but decided to lay on his side and for some reason Draco took that as a cue to do the same and... Now his back was to his chest and Harry had never wanted to hug someone so badly. So he did. Draco's back was warm and he could smell his hair from where he was and feel his breathing and...
He wanted to send her, but Hedgwig's wing would never fully recover from that dreadful night. "Hey, girl, don't be mad" He smiled when the white owl tried to tear a piece of the letter with her beak, demanding more seeds "Alright, here, special for you"
outside Hogwarts with him. Harry stopped in front of one of the doors and opened it, pulling them inside.
"Can you please let me finish, Harry?" She frowned and Harry pressed his lips together, looking back at her. "Noah told us he was at the library, alone, and saw an... altercation"
"Yes, I know who you are" The boy said, looking at both of them with a small frown. He looked a bit younger than them, but Harry wasn't exactly sure of his age. Surely Draco knew, they were in the same house and they had had a small... incident.
"I never killed anyone." He said and cleared his throat. "I can say you-know-who's name. I love my Father"
Harry nodded after a few moments, letting go of Draco's hand "Yeah, I can. I... it won't happen again" He pushed up and grabbed his wand again.
There was a long pause after that, and Draco wasn't sure how he managed to maintain eye contact without cowering in fear. His father had only hit him once, but he had never really needed to. He always knew what to say to undo him.
Draco moved his feet under the desk, placing it behind one of Harry's. It was so subtle but it felt as if he had been struck. Harry swallowed, heart racing and palms sweating. Fuck. Did this mean he accepted his apology? Had he just said something good? He probably had.
Harry frowned, McGonagall couldn't possibly think Malfoy of all people had done this. The whole attack reeked of magic and he didn't even have his wand. True, Slughorn wasn't the most capable keeper of said wand but he would've noticed if it wasn't there.
"Oh, shut up" Draco smirked, moving his chair to sit next to him, and pointing at a group of stars. Harry had never had the time to sit around and look up at the stars, but he could imagine old wizards having nothing else to do. He tried to follow Draco's finger and see the shape, but to him it looked like a weird rhomboid figure and then more stars down like... a tail?
"How come you are such a bad student? I know you study, I've seen your books and notes" Draco frowned, his hands pressing softly against Harry's back to move him closer to his body "And now you don't have an excuse"
, it was more like Draco was throwing some left over books to it to try and distract it. Thank Merlin.
Hermione frowned for a moment "After everything that has happened, I think I would believe you if you said the sky is actually hot pink"
Harry tried to feel bad about it, but couldn't. His insides were a mess, and this wasn't new. He felt empty and sad when he should be happy (the war was over so why wouldn't he be happy?) and then he felt calm and loved around people he shouldn't be with -well, only Draco. He knew something was off, and different and perhaps he had changed forever. But he didn't know how to figure it out. How to know for sure.
"I'm not saying they are" He sounded more frustrated now, but the grip on his arm was strong "I'm just saying that I trust you to keep a secret, not precisely them"
Knowing there was no way he could change Narcissa's mind, he finally spoke "No, we do not. You told me to speak to him and I did"
"Elliot" Noah said, placing a hand on his friends' arm "I think these are all very good points. We can't just trust them. But we can't accuse them. Actually, they weren't even here when you were attacked... but they could've been working from the outside"
Draco stopped and stared at him. For a couple of steps Harry didn't seem to notice, until he stopped as well, turning to see the blond boy. "What?"
I am sorry if this is short or something, I truly tried. Once May is done I will have more time so it will be back to normal!
ghost that lived there. He didn't mind. Not at all. His mind was somewhere else, somewhere dark and there was no way to come back from it.
There was a small tense silence, but it wasn't an unbearable tension, it felt as if they both wanted to do the same thing but neither had the courage to just do it.
Harry knew exactly how he felt, but he didn't have a solution. "Me too" He was about to say something when Draco started eating, so he guessed he had said the right thing, or helped in some way. So he decided to do the same and eat. After all, they were there to enjoy themselves, not to focus on what other people thought of them.
There was a slow pause before the boy uncovered his face, his eyes weren't red and he wasn't actively crying but he looked sad.
His eyes focused on her almost immediately. They were grey, the color of ice through a cloudy day, and yet she saw the fire behind them. Draco was furious, or determined, it was hard to know which. Hermione barely remembered the eleven year old she had met so long ago, the boy that was horrible but easy to read. Perhaps there had always been more to him than she thought. Did Harry see that?
"They are not going to leave you alone" Draco said stretching on the bed like a cat before sitting with his back against the wall. "It's not a big deal, Potter, let them. You are avoiding them anyway"
Harry sighed "I did that" his voice was filled with sorrow and Draco forced himself to open his eyes.
Again, sorry for the delay, I tried to update the weekend before taking my plane but... I couldn't finish and I didn't want to put something half-done. ANYWAY hope you liked it <3
"Everyone knows about that map. But nobody believes it to be real..." Draco barely shifted to look at it a bit better "Did you steal it?"
Sobbing, and not the quiet ones he had allowed himself. This was loud and shameful and he didn't want Draco to see it, he didn't want anyone to see it.
"Him? No. He wasn't. I don't think he even wanted to" Draco crossed his arms "Do you think that's why? Because they both weren't death eaters and they knew my family? Do you think someone wants to make me look bad?"
There was no one expecting him when he arrived. The only greeting he got was silence. Draco wasn't sure what was better, to find an empty house or his parents. For the time being, the quiet was better.
He was right, and Harry knew it. They started walking slowly through the first row of bookcases, trying to find their way through the maze. Draco was pulling books from strategic places. Leaving marks in case they got lost? Smart.
"... I am angry" And that was more honest than he expected. "And hurt" The last part was a whisper, Harry only heard it because he was paying close attention "I say things I regret in this state"
Draco only gave him a short nod, rubbing one of his wrists. Not that he had had real handcuffs or anything... Harry wondered if the magical ones hurt. He suddenly wanted to reach out and rub it for him.
The Tower windows were not supposed to allow students to "jump" or fly down, but surely Hermione had done something to them as well. Or perhaps they had been damaged during the war and changed. Harry didn't know and didn't care. Whatever helped them to get done with this was good enough for him. They dropped on the grass outside the school and Harry managed to shrink his broom so it wouldn't be bothering them.
"We are not trying to push you away, but we are worried. You must know this will do no good to your reputation, yes?"
Saying goodbye to Harry was harder than he thought it would be. They spent the two hours he was allowed to visit cuddling on the couch, catching up and sharing soft kisses he would carry to his grave.
Being at the library was not a good idea and Draco should've been much more aware of his surroundings, if he had been maybe he would've seen a group of people glaring at him and getting more and more angry at his presence with every passing minute.
"Draco, you are allowed to leave the room if you want to" There was something in the way she said it that made him think that perhaps she didn't hate him.
Harry felt a weight on his shoulder. Draco. They had been researching for hours and it was getting late. Had he not noticed how tired Draco was? His eyes were closed and his head rested on his shoulder. They weren't exactly alone, Harry felt a pang of fear.
It was a smart move from his parents, but it didn't put his mind at ease. If they were worried about their social standing, they would be worried about him and Harry, which was something he didn't need.
Draco hadn't mentioned his father or how he was doing, which was a clear indicator that he didn't want to share how bad he was.
And the same day he had been bullied in the library in front of everyone. The same fucking day they decided to kiss.
Her eyes drifted back to the fire a few feet away and she dropped her hand back to her side "I still love them.
"Well, our classmate's lover was tortured to madness. I think you can find him right next to Neville's parents" Yeah, the conversation definitely turned Harry 's blood cold. Every little bit of desire and need and giddiness he had felt was long gone now, replaced by bitterness and frustration. "And then the other one was attacked here and his state is unknown" there was a long pause "perhaps he was happy"
True, he was someone who valued his personal space, got moody more often than not and was prone to isolate himself from everyone. Despite that, he still wanted Harry close by.
"Please do not think about my father" He finally looked up, pulling away from the hug "That's for me to handle... And for you to avoid during Christmas dinner"
"...Back to bed" he heard Malfoy's tired voice... Soft too. Harry pressed his back against the mattress again, opening his eyes and trying to see him through the shadows. They were close, he was pretty sure of... Oh. Alright. Draco was hugging him. Alright, cool. It was... Normal.
The old room was so silent it was eerie. The door had closed behind them which was... worrying. Long rows of bookcases lined the walls and created hallways as complex as a small maze. There were some empty corners and holes where the room was clearly too burnt to ever work again.
The Dursleys had said the most awful things... And yes, they always said the most awful things about anyone different but he had never seen a man kissing another or anyone speaking about this as a... normal thing. So maybe the Dursleys weren't so off about this. Maybe this was the one topic were their ideas matched the rest of the world's.
Oh, he recognized that voice. It was the auror that had found them coming back from Hogsmeade. She was... She wasn't the best one of the bunch.
âWhat, her? She's a fun little thingâ Bell said while placing strange artifacts around the circle, before taking some of the blood and drawing in the center of the circle. A smile was always on his face, as if he was getting exactly what he wanted.
Narcissa would never say that to Lucius, but she knew the life of her only son was worth a lot more than how she felt about mudbloods. Besides, she never imagined Draco would stand up to Lucius in the way that he did. It had made her proud, in a weird way, seeing him with a strength she doubted he had. It made her believe that perhaps her son would survive all of this unscarred.
He was about to use a binding spell, something non-lethal -even if he wanted to harm him- when the door opened violently behind him, and voices filled the room.
Draco stared at him, moving forward and pressing himself against Harry, almost pleading for a hug. He reached out and placed his arms around his slender shape. If he was being completely honest with himself, his heart had pounded incredibly hard and his whole body had turned at their words.
They both stared at each other. Harry wanted to be angry, but he felt sad and guilty for screaming the other night instead of saying how sad and weird he felt. "Alright... I will"
Lucius opened his mouth but closed it, he knew that was true. It didn't matter what he said or what excuses he came up with: his own son feared him. Sometimes he couldn't understand why, he had been much better than his own father. How could that not be enough?
If his application was rejected, he would be crushed. True, at first it had all been about himself and his feelings and his fears... But after seeing him? It wasn't just that he wanted to live with him. The thought of Harry all alone in that home made his heart hurt. He couldn't allow that.
The last few nights had been boring and lonely. He had not seen Draco since their "sleepover" and he wondered if something was wrong, if he had said something bad or what. He had tried to talk to him that day after waking up the second time and going to class, but Draco hadn't paid any attention to him. And to make things worse he hadn't been able to check his wand to know if it had been used in that horrible attack. Without that he couldn't be at peace, or "just relax".
"Calm down" Noah said still reading his book. "Fighting is pointless and if you get into more trouble your parents are going to send you home for the rest of the year, Elliot. So be nice"
"Yeah? We need to tell the others" Harry frowned, not quite sure as to what his boyfriend -Merlin, his
Alright. He would have to say it in the middle of the corridor and he wasn't sure if Draco was going to like it, but he would have to deal with it. "Harry birthday, Draco"
Harry swallowed "Thing is the Christmas break is coming and we don't have much time. Tomorrow we will examine the wand and see how much time we truly have before the aurors arrive"
Harry sat down on one of the empty chairs and rested his head on his hands, trying to breathe slowly to calm the beating of his heart. There was nothing wrong with taking some time for himself. There was nothing wrong with falling in love.
They were still panting when Draco pulled some sheets over his body, up to his belly. Harry didn't know why he was so self conscious or whatever. It was obvious he was beautiful, how could he not see it?
"That's terrible" Harry moved a bit closer, not knowing what to do or say. What Draco had described was... Well, exactly how he imagined Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. "But... Are you sure you are not...?"
He wasn't sure why his father was standing in front of him, he hoped he didn't want to have another talk. The past three weeks had been filled with conversations that didn't end well for him. He had tried not to 'pick a fight' with Lucius, but sometimes it was unavoidable. Especially when he felt so confused.
Draco seemed uncomfortable and looked around to make sure people weren't paying attention. Truth was, people were paying some degree of attention to them, mostly because Harry Potter was in the small group. Great.
Harry moved slowly back from him, sitting on the bed and waiting for Draco to do the same. When he did, they both stared at each other, hungry and desperate to jump at each other again.
Draco planted a kiss on his neck, leaving his lips over his skin and Harry lost track of what he was saying. "The hat was right, you sound like a Slytherin sometimes"
âIs that how you treat your...?â Draco said, trying to cause a small distraction and give Harry some more time. Harry wasn't sure if their restraining spells would wear off, but he wasn't leaving anything to chance.
"Myrtle?" He whispered, walking around and trying to find her. Sometimes the ghost would hide or simply be slightly out of sight. "Myrtle it's me. I won't hurt you"
Draco gave her an intimidating look before looking back at Elliot "I guess we will have to talk later"
"Perhaps our name should die, Father" Lucius reacted as if he had been slapped, tense all around, anger in his eyes.
have, in the past. He seems... He doesn't like this, don't get me wrong, but he has been... supportive? In his own way"
Harry proceeded to explain what the headmistress had shared, whispering when students got way too close. It was a delicate matter, and if it got out it would create panic. They didn't need that.
"We saw something odd on the map... Well, Draco thought it was weird that someone was talking to Myrtle"
There were things Harry had lived he had no idea, and others he didn't know how he endured. And to top it all off the war had left them both a complete mess. Draco knew the following... months? years? would be filled with screams, and crying and nightmares. If he was going to go through all of that, he wanted it to be next to Harry.
"You always broke the rules and suddenly being scolded by McGonagall turned you into a well behaving citizen?"
Moving in such a small bed wasn't easy, and Harry quickly realized that, as their legs clashed when Draco tried to lay down on the bed underneath him. It didn't detract Harry from kissing him even harder, the soft brushes of tongue sending electricity through his body, waking pieces of skin he had never felt before. Harry could feel Draco's flat chest pressed against his own, hell, he could feel all of Draco pressed against him and it was driving him insane.
"She's fine. She's... fine" Harry said, convincing no one. The girl was at the infirmary and that was all they knew about her, really, but it would have to be enough.
The silence seemed to last for a whole minute, before Lucius decided to speak again, this time he sounded tired. "Whatever it is that's going on with you... It wouldn't have lasted if the Dark Lord lived"
he told himself turning the page but not quite sure he knew what he was reading anymore. Harry hadn't shared much: something about his nightmares and how Hogwarts brought back bad memories. Maybe if he were still 13 years old he would capitalize on that to make fun of him, but humiliating Harry had lost all appeal a while back. Something else kept him up at night: the simple fact that Harry did not hate him. It was odd how much his reality could change with a simple fact.
There was a brief pause, Harry moving to get his cloak and the map. They couldn't just walk blindly around the Castle -they would probably get lost, or caught. And he didn't know which one was worse-. While he grabbed everything they needed -Cloak, wand, map, the broom he had left in a hurry after meeting Ginny- Ron cupped Hermione's face and kissed her goodbye. Something moved inside Harry's chest and he looked over at Draco, who seemed completely unaware. The slythering was looking out the window, without a care in the world. Or at least that's what he was trying to show. Harry wanted to do the same thing his friends were doing. It was a simple gesture, just a small kiss goodbye. Just in case. It was strange, feeling like he had someone to come back to.
He had seen how boys -sometimes even his own cousin- would harass other boys for being too feminine. Hell, he had never seen anyone in the whole wizarding world that was gay. He had no clue what Wizards thought about it, but if it wasn't an everyday thing then... It was something to be hidden away, no?
Draco felt sick. Sick at what she was saying, yes, but the thought that truly made him want to puke was how she was trying to manipulate him through her 'comforting' presence. Was he just a pawn to them?
The next time they appeared on a magazine it would be on their own terms. And if they ever wanted to shout to the world how much they felt for each other they would decide when and how.
Harry tightened his jaw and didn't say a word, giving her space to speak. It was clear she knew more than she was saying. Was she in on it? It was hard to imagine someone so petite harming a student like Elliot.
That night Draco was laying on his back, one arm behind his head and a hand over his stomach. Harry stood there like a tree until his body decided it was time to stop being a coward and sit next to him. And so he did.
âIt was difficult to find this placeâ Harry tried to make conversation, catching how Draco's face softened.
Bell shrugged âThat's none of my business. I saw an opportunity to get what I wanted and I took it, dear. I only had to do a couple of things for them, you know how it is. You had to do some things back in the day, did you not?â
Silence. Should he? Leave? Harry bit his lower lip and gave a step towards the boy, curiosity and worry killing him. He sat on a small portion of the bed and stared at the pale boy.
Harry tried not to shudder at the thought "Andromeda says those symbols mean blood or bones or pieces from the...
"Okay" Draco closed his eyes, still half resting against the wall, his knees up to his chest. "Are you leaving?"
Harry sighed. Alright. Draco was being a bit difficult. Harry took his tie off, and decided that he really should relax more around him. So he sat up and called for his sleeping clothes, it wasn't anything fancy but it was comfortable and he was sick of sleeping in his uniform.
Muggle London was not as loud as he thought -although ambulances were incredibly high pitched and it hurt his ears every time-, and people were always hurrying somewhere. The lights were incredible, right when the sun started to go down, the cute little stores illuminated the streets. It reminded him of home, but different, like staring through a looking glass.
"I don't care. Never did. I just... My aunt raised me" He was frowning "at least for a while, and your Father..." Rage filled his voice and Draco didn't feel scared.
Draco sat up so fast, his hand went to his wand as a reflex. And there was no way the blonde hadn't noticed that. Damn it.
After a couple taps on the book, he managed to push down and focus. He knew he was quite smart, but studying to get what you want is part of being a Slytherin too.
They had shared kisses and some moments during the rest of the week, but it hadn't been enough. Luckily that weekend was the last Hogsmeade trip and they had already decided to have diner there. Harry wanted for them to spend the night there, but it would take some sneaking around. Nothing too difficult, considering teachers and students slept late on the weekends.
Beatrice tried to obliviate him but did a bad job. It didn't help her that your friend tried to protect himself. That's why he was so confused" There was a small smile on the old woman's face. Elliot realized she disliked Bea as much as he did. He could only imagine the havoc that girl was causing in the Infirmary.
"No" Draco crossed his arms, frowning "Do you want to talk or do you wish to interrogate me instead?"
"Are you sure it's okay if I stay here?" Draco nodded while taking off his shoes and climbing onto his bed.
to him. No one. Not once. A deep shame burnt right through his chest, pouring down his stomach and rising through his neck. He pulled his hand from between Draco's.
Harry looked at him, trying to focus on his grey eyes and not on their surroundings. Everything looked so menacing...
thing that no one had told him about not having a family and living while a lunatic tried to murder you was how little he cared about what people thought of him. He had no one to disappoint, and no expectations to live up to, only his own.
"We never knew you felt that way, Draco" He gave her a look, and she smiled. It was a sad type of smile, but it was there nonetheless "I suspected it, yes. Tsk, my boy..." Her hand found her way to his cheek, and she caressed it for a couple moments. "Our family is a complicated one, is it not? But-"
Did he really need to go have dinner? It would be better to go back to slytherin. He didn't even want to look at Harry's eyes and say he didn't get the information they needed.
"Fuck" He whispered, his voice hoarse and his throat hurting. A hand found its way to his face, cleaning the remaining tears from his cheeks. Harry saw him as a Death Eater, and a coward and nothing he could say would ever change that. So why try?
It wasn't particularly late and yet the library was almost empty. This tranquilized Harry, who had been really stressed at the idea of going inside a room filled with students that would glance at him and whisper. Some tables were packed, but it could be much worse.
I promise I meant this chapter to be happy and not angst-y but... hey! at least there's some progress? x)
Bell turned from Draco as if someone had slapped him. His whole face was twisted with rage and Harry realized he wouldn't doubt killing them. There were a lot of thoughts running through his mind, but they usually seemed to quiet down during a fight.
There was a long pause while they both stared at each other. Noah finally gave in "Fine. I need to go put on my binder, wait for me"
Ugh, he didn't want to get rid of his scarf, even if it had those terrible colors. Draco sighed leaving it to the side before laying down in the big bed, he was truly tired.
he had some other ways of making Harry choose, but he wasn't going to say that "I like that painting you got, the one with the landscape... I think it should go right there"
And apparently, Harry wanted the same thing. Which had been made clear by his insistence. So why resist? Why not try it?
"Ah, hm. I figured" Harry looked around and realized he hadn't set the silencing spell so he proceeded to do so. "Do you think you could talk to Myrtle?"
"Am now" Draco's voice was but a whisper, his eyes closed, his face inches away from his own. Harry didn't think it twice, moving close enough to kiss him. The rhythm had become familiar by now, and his lips a new warmth his body ached for. At first Harry didn't know when it was okay to kiss someone: do you wait for them to kiss you or do you kiss first? do you have to ask every time? How do you know someone wants to be kissed? But right now, with Draco, he knew exactly when and how. He knew Draco desired him, he had
"They are looking for you" Draco said, looking a bit past Harry's shoulder, where his friends were sitting -
"For what?" one of Draco's hands found its way to his and then he was... Holding the hand Harry had over his stomach. He closed his eyes again, feeling warm and happy and safe.
Hi everyone. First of all I'm sorry for how long it took, there's no way to apologize enough. Truth be told COVID was hard, and I am in healthcare so it was even harder. And even when it was not, I wasn't in the right mindset. I'm sad because this epilogue was much better in my head, it had been in me for like half the fanfic and I knew how I wanted to end it, but then things happened.
"Merlin, it wasn't a real question. Ah, well, I guess it's the serum. Fantastic little thing, isn't it? Honesty is so important. Especially in a relationship. Bea tells me everything. She's such a good girl"
There was a small pause in every moment from Draco's body, his eyes focused on his face as if trying to see if he was lying or mocking him. Harry frowned, why couldn't they be friends? Never in his wildest dreams they had come to this, but it was for the better. Being enemies and rivals almost cost them everything, hell, he almost killed Draco once. And Malfoy would've probably hurt him too.
"But we weren't... I mean, before... I..." Harry was dizzy from his lips, yet trying to figure it out. Oh. Of course. "Oh, it's... that you like...?"
âI know it sounds like a lie, but it's not. And I know you... might want things to be more than 'just fine' but you'll have to give them timeâ
"No! Surely you would rather be trapped with Potter!" Elliot was gritting his teeth, the veins on his neck pulsing. Their bodies gave in just a little, but the adrenaline made them push back with greater force. The thuds did not stop.
Draco crossed his arms, looking away from him. They didn't have much more garden to walk around in, so he simply stopped. There were a couple benches outside, but he wasn't going to sit there to have a heart to heart with his father
Noah nodded, looking a bit colder than usual. "I'm going to the library"Â  He started walking back to the Castle but stopped a few steps away. Elliot was staring at his back without moving. "Well, are you coming?"
written, a couple of days ago. He was careful with his words but we have a specific code" She smiled, loving the way she could understand his son. Even if sometimes she couldn't even recognize him from the baby she had held so many years ago "He would like to know if you know anything about the attacks that have been happening at Hogwarts"
"I-..." he shook his head, taking classes with the true seventh year students made all of them feel slightly stupid, but it wasn't as if they had repeated the year on purpose.
True, if he had been told he would have to live with Draco a couple years back, the first thing on his mind would be to sleep with his wand under his pillow and expect some sort of betrayal. But now? He knew him too well. There was too much trust there. And Draco was loyal.
The young slytherin smirked at him, and it chilled Harry to the bones. It was odd, seeing someone so young look so... menacing. "Nobody did this to me. You should go back to your bedroom, Potter, or I might tell the Headmistress someone came to see me"
"Ah, yes. Weasley" He focused on Ginny and Harry had to drink again. This game was going to get them all in the Infirmary.
Harry had experience pretending not to exist; the thought bringing a bitter taste to his mouth. He was sure Malfoy wasn't being mean, he actually seemed at ease now. Which made no sense. He remembered when, in third year, Malfoy got a scratch from Buckbeak and almost got his Father to sue the school. And now a kid had gone through his things, thoroughly humiliating him in front of other people and he was... Calm? Yes, he wasn't a thirteen year old anymore, but the Malfoy he knew would've been furious.
Still holding onto the mattress, he used his free hand to help himself. His heart was pounding when he finally pushed his cock inside of Draco. He didn't mean to moan, but he just did, his head pressing against Draco's shoulder. The slytherin, instead, was breathing as slowly as he could, one of his hands digging into Harry's shoulder. Harry couldn't think, his mind felt dazzy for a couple of seconds.
The piece of pie was soft and incredibly delicious, Harry didn't remember when was the last time he had enjoyed something sweet. When it had became clear that Draco wanted to go to Hogsmeade for breakfast, Harry felt unsure about where they would go. Would people stare? People always stared. And not only that, but they were breaking the rules by being out of school on a Tuesday on their own. Draco didn't seem to worry about it one bit though, going straight for the Three Broomsticks. It was one of the most decent establishments out there.
"Hermione and I... We have been talking about it. About you" Ugh. Harry tried not to be mad, but he was stressed and confused and talking of himself wasn't exactly something he enjoyed.
Malfoy felt steady enough to hold onto, so he did. Harry stopped feeling like he was going to fall in any moment and looked up to the other boy. He really wasn't expecting to find such a fond look on his face, one that was quickly replaced by a cocky smirk.
Harry gathered all of his Gryffindor strength and looked at her, trying to read her face. Nothing. Was she angry? Hurt?
He looked down at his own hands, feeling guilty at the things he had called his father moments ago. People would never understand them. Not even Harry, not really. They would forever be Death Eaters at worst, cowards at best. No one would ever see the love, would they?
"Yes, quidditch, sure" He said, realizing there was an uncomfortable silence and three pair of eyes on him. "After breakfast?"
"'s alright. I never even considered..." Harry looked down at the red sheets. Did they really need to be so serious about this? It would happen or it wouldn't and... There was no rush. Harry breathed out and smiled, more relaxed "It's the red sheets, isn't it? Not good enough for a Slytherin"
"You can fix it with magic later" He heard, the words mumbled over his own lips. He couldn't even get angry, not when they were kissing like that. A wave of heat ran through his belly and downwards when their tongues touched, incredibly soft, incredibly intimate.
"Thank you, my love" She said, thinking of how to write all of that to Draco. The aurors would read her letter, and she had to be careful.
Neville nodded and went back to his work, so Draco took it as a cue to do the same. He had a lot of studying to do if he was going to do as well as he needed, but once he got his mind into something it was very hard to get in his way. Of course, this lead to some... Overworking, but it was fine.
vulnerable and could become dangerous to students. We were rebuilding steadily and fixing the wards without any big impediments before the school year started. After that..." She waved her hands around for a moment.
Harry tried to find an empty table, pushing through and trying not to feel out of breath. Big crowds were a problem, even when said crowds were sitting and minding their own business.
He nibbed at Draco's lower lip, feeling the softness of it, the way his breath hitched and his eyes closed. Merlin. How could someone be so beautiful?
"Son" Narcissa tried to follow, holding the sides of her dress very slightly Â "this is something we need to discuss, do not leave"
"And why's that?" Draco arched an eyebrow, trying to decode what was going on in her head. "Are we that popular?"
"No, you didn't. I understand that before you... Had an important role to play in something much bigger than all of us. And even then, I voiced my concerns to Albus" She frowned, and Harry felt a weird mix of feelings run through him. He tried to think he was alone with McGonagall instead of observed by two other pair of eyes.
"Or a bear" Draco was starting to sweat, fire burning in his lower back. He didn't know what it was and if it got in they would have to fight back... And he didn't quite trust Elliot to defend him or help. Not like Harry would.
