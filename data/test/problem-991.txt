Harry knew that the nurse was well-meaning, but he was so tired of the hero-worshipping. He knew that it was easier to simply do what was being asked, rather than fight against their wishes.
"Only a little bit. And it's okay, it's your first time." The train came to a stop and the doors opened, letting a few people off, and a few people on.
Colin Creevy is the unfortunate soul that finds Draco Malfoy's corpse. His pale skin has taken on a grey tone and his eyes are frozen open. There is blood at his lips, much like there is everywhere else in the tiled room. Creevy's first instinct is to snap a photograph, but he thinks better of it, running off in terror to find Mcgonagall, to find Pomfrey, to find any teacher that can help… Because Draco Malfoy has been murdered in the 6th floor toilets.
Dumbledore continues his dangerous game...
bad idea." Ah, Ron. He was so wonderfully predictable. It was a little sad. Honestly, it irked Harry just a little bit.
could help you with?"
“What exactly does low-rise mean?” Draco tried to look between the two of them, frowning as he looked around. What sorts of shoes were these? Bas nudged his ankle with his own foot.
"So, my dear, we know you are an auror, with all your exciting adventures and tricky cases… but what do you do outside of work? What are your hobbies, who are your friends?"
He stopped walking. “We’re going somewhere muggle?”
“Harry,” she said suddenly, giving him
like.
Especially since now it seemed that… That if anything were to go wrong… He could easily turn Harry with one single bite. He wouldn’t ever wish that on him. Not that he wished it on himself, but… Oh, this all had gone to hell, hadn’t it?
“I was not in the room when my son was branded, Mr. Potter. I was held in another room, where my sister
“Y… Yes,” he said quietly. He felt himself go a bit pale and October sat down beside him, placing a steady hand on his shoulder.
“What
Also… please show me off in Diagon. Or Hogsmeade. Or wherever we are. Am I to be your trophy husband? Want and worry for nothing while my gorgeous partner spoils me? Except for the moons, darling, then I get to spoil and pamper you. I'll draw you a lovely bath with healing oils and wash your hair, feed you little bits of fruit and cheese and nuts, bring you fancy chocolate bonbons as I spread you out over the bed and spend an hour making you come so you're nice and relaxed and can finally fall asleep. I'll take care of you, Draco, I promise. Just like I know you'll take care of me.
Narcissa was laughing at him, now. “No, no, I think you should keep them. They make wonderful decorations.”
After Harry had waited for what felt like hours but was most likely only a few minutes, the dragon relaxed once again and slowly moved its wing back up. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and started to inch away again. This time, the dragon made no noise, but simply turned its head and gave Harry a look that would have made even Hermione Granger shake in her boots. Harry decided to stay put after that.
Draco nodded. “I did, yes, thank you.” Glancing to Sapphire, he smiled. “Sapphire mentioned lunch?”
Have you given any thought to my request since our last meeting? If you decline, please owl me with a list of people you think can best fit the positions.
Heading down the stairs, Harry looked at Narcissa. “Do you know a Gwendolyn Malfoy?” She put down her book and looked at him.
"Aha, but I did get your number, didn't I?" He leaned in again and kissed her cheek. As he did so, little miss Morrigan, who had alfredo sauce around her mouth and on her hands, basically latched herself onto the front of her father's shirt.
I accept, Harry love.
and… And he felt like he was in pain. Not a pain from the change, but from something else. It felt like he chest
Pity that you don't want the greater Paris area to know how I'd torture your sweet arse for hours with my tongue and fingers. I suppose you're a more private man than I thought. I'll work on the charm so my voice will stick to the parchment. But in the meantime…
For years. What a wonder. "One could argue it's against my will," he couldn't stop himself from muttering. The likeness was shocking, though. He wondered if Alistair even realized. To Draco’s surprise, Alistair laughed, apparently having heard his utterance.
“Go ahead, I won’t keep you from your breakfast, Draco,” she teased, picking up her mug of honeyed tea and taking a sip. Her toddler squirmed out of her lap and made his way over to Gwendolyn, holding up his little arms, asking to be picked up. Draco watched as she beamed down at the little one.
Draco stared at the menu, unable to properly take it in. “I… think I need a moment.”
“It sounds like Gabriel and Devin in school, doesn’t it? My son used to write almost every week, complaining about this boy in school, for about the first three years… We were quite surprised when Devin started coming by and asking where Gabriel was, once he’d left for Beauxbatons. I think he was heartbroken, really.”
“When I find him, I’ll be bringing him back, that’s for sure.” Draco continued to amaze and terrify Harry. Even he would never run from the hospital with a werewolf bite. Taking a look around the room, Harry noted how everything was clean and tidy, and none of Draco’s personal effects were left in the room. He’d definitely left of his own will.
Cheers!
“Shoes, definitely,” Bas said with a nod. “You own any trainers, Draco?”
Jeez. McGonagall didn’t pull a single punch, did she? “Yes, ma’am.” If it was for Draco, though, Harry would do anything he had to. Even if McGonagall had him do nothing except sit still and quiet for the entire hour. He would do it for Draco. The key for him was motivation, as it had likely been for his dad and Sirius.
Harry is positive he's just passed a test, although he wasn't quite sure what the test was. "Make it where, ma'am?"
(P.S. I know France probably has excellent chocolate, but this was Remus’ favorite kind… maybe you'll like it too?)
It was a good day for flying, and Harry was glad for it. He much preferred broom travel to Apparating for work. After a few hours, he touched down, perhaps an hour or so outside of Salisbury, within walking distance of a wizarding town called Garmsby. The whole county and surrounding areas were magical and therefore not on Muggle maps. He'd need to find a room for the night, and ask some locals about recent creature activity to see if the dragon had been spotted.
“Sapphire,” Draco called without turning his head, still envisioning so many different images in his head, all featuring Harry and the gorgeous necklace.
again. Maybe he’d reply to Draco’s letter.
Harry,
Yours,
On a happier note, I can’t bloody believe we’re engaged! Betrothed! Intended! Affianced! I’ve had the biggest grin on my face for days. Pretty sure all the Diagon shopkeepers think I’m an absolute loon, but I couldn’t care less. It’s a bit funny, isn’t it? We’ve practically been dating for years and just didn’t acknowledge it.
He grabbed a piece of stationary and began to compose a reply.
He glanced between the toddler munching on his lunch and his cousin standing at the counter. "...whatever your accident was, I hope you're healing well, Valerie."
“Because it’s none of your business, that’s why.”
Hello all!
And yet, here was his husband, sprinkling blueberries and cranberries onto the stuff and tucking in like it was a completely normal occurrence.
Harry approached the bar, where a tall, freckled witch was polishing glasses, greying blonde hair braided and twisted up atop her head. “Good afternoon, ma'am,” Harry said with a smile. He hoped the townspeople would be accommodating. “I was hoping for a bed for the night, and to ask if there have been any dragon sightings nearby—”
Draco
“You can tell him yourself, you know. But he figured you were anyways.”
” Devin grinned until Gabriel elbowed him in the ribs.
“Just— you don’t have to, I’ll tell her.” What could he tell her? That her son was injured, bitten by a werewolf, and now missing? She’d hex him where he stood. He was partially to blame for this whole thing, wasn’t he? “Fuck… he just disappeared? He was fixed up to be able Apparate?”
with magic. “A ring.” Harry moved closer, peering down at it. Not only did it swirl with magic, but it sparkled.
I’ll be home tonight. Have dinner ready?
Sirius.
Queer Eye because the youngest two Weasley’s absolutely shameless pleasure. Multiple episodes had had the pair of them in tears on the Burrow’s couch. Every man (and the lovely lady Miss Tammye) had deserved all the Fab Five had given them and more— confidence, healing, organization, and the tools to take care of themselves.
to taste, all of a sudden. Even the smell of it was amplified. Citrusy, bittersweet, pear and apple notes came through as if written on the wall in front of him. He could practically taste the barrels the wine had matured in. Realizing October was expecting a response, Draco nodded. “It’s good,” he managed to say. It practically had him drooling.
Truly, Myrtle had been of more comfort and use to him than anyone, especially since his… untimely death. He sat between two sinks, his knees pressed up against his silver-stained chest. He wasn't much for hovering above the stalls like his friend.
“I’m sure I would. You’ll have to bring her to visit someday. Then you and I can laugh over Devin making the crude jokes and October giving everyone far too much wine.”
“It’s gorgeous there. Just being out there, the smell of the earth and the grapes under the sun… they make some excellent wine. We usually go in August, but it’s wonderful this time of year, too,” Valerie said, handing off the apple slices to her son and grandmother. Draco watched as Gwen fed him.
He’d obviously made a mistake in coming here. There was a gentle hand on his shoulder, and Draco realized that Gwendolyn was standing behind him.
Remus Lupin and Draco's cousin sat near the end of the hall, sharing a blanket and looking a bit worse for wear-- she'd have a scar or two to match his, no doubt.
“You had better.”
Harry pulled out his field notebook and pencil, ready to document whatever information Doonan could give him. “A friend of mine was out near Salisbury yesterday about a dragon—he's a dragon expert, world-renowned—and it attacked him on sight. I need to know if you've seen it, if it passed this way at any time in the past week.”
They Apperated into Hogsmead and Floo'd to Mcgonagall’s office from the village, since she had sent the letter. The older witch had an expression that Lucius couldn't quite place, though he was sure his appearance was part of it. Honestly, he looked like he'd escaped Azkaban and he knew it.
Get back to me soon. New moon just passed. I'd never felt more myself.
What on Earth and between these worlds has been going on? Draco speaks of you so fondly, and looks so absolutely stricken whenever he reads a letter from you, and yet he seems to believe the situation hopeless, and that there’s no chance of the two of you becoming an item together.
Merlin, his parents.
Draco turned to look back at her. “What? Sapphire, no-” Ugh, as he’d turned his hair had seemed to float into his eyes. He blinked rapidly to try to resolve the situation. She just chuckled and shook her head.
“I know. Come on, now, I believe that it’s time for lunch.”
More than half an hour had passed before Narcissa settled, placed the letter on the table, and drained her teacup in one go. Harry immediately went to refill her cup, and she nodded her head in thanks. “I’m sorry, Harry dear, you were saying?”
“Now with the introductions done, shall we eat?” Sapphire gave a little nod to Draco, almost sensing how he’d like for the attention not to be on him for a while.
“Enough, Peeves. The boy has been through enough without your vibes at his colouring,” the Baron practically purred, sliding through the wall of the corridor. Peeves went rather quiet, as if disgruntled, and vanished.
"Yes, ma'am?"
She folded her hands in her lap and was silent for a minute. “...blood wards, of the kind Dumbledore described to you, do not work. Your mother’s sister would have needed to agree to them, as well as offer her own blood and magic, neither of which she did, I assume.” She looked up at Harry, calm as anything. “Do you know how magical godparents are officially chosen?”
Sweetheart,
"Is that so, darling? What do you expect
Harry hummed around his bite of sandwich. As much as he hated to admit it, the whole pureblood culture and traditions around marriage, the courting and the alliances, fascinated him. Odds were, his own father hadn't done much of it, because his mother wouldn't have known about it. "So my question is… why now? Why wait six years after Voldemort is dead to try this? Shouldn't they have, you know, joined up when they could?"
"Those damn-- and you're sure you want that bedroom?" She nodded and he sighed. "Alright, okay. We'll take care of the pixies."
Full moon is this weekend. How about we save the celebrations for when I'm at home, yes? It'll be soon, Harry. I miss you, too.
The wards easily allowed them onto the grounds. They picked a place under the apple tree on the edge of the gardens, a nice distance away from the manicured back lawn of the estate. A few flicks of her wand and Narcissa dug a grave and lowered the body and so buried her baby boy. A headstone was erected in pale and perfect marble. ‘Draco Lucius Malfoy. Born June 5, 1980, Died May 8, 1997. Beloved son.’
Sensing the sudden change in mood, Harry wrapped his arm around her and pulled Narcissa in closer, so she could rest against him. “...he’s never not going to need you, you know. He talks about you all the time, and it’s always with the sweetest tone I’ve ever heard him use.” He rested his right hand on top of her left. “He loves you so much, you’re the one he loves most. Please don’t doubt that.”
Ancient Runes
“He’d forgotten to take his potion, I can assume.”
risked what they had when he'd kissed Draco, and when he'd left, neither had brought it up that following Monday. They went about their lives as if that otherwise enjoyable evening hadn't happened.
"No silver, my love," she said as she stepped behind him and fastened the chain around his neck. Draco glanced into the nearby mirror and smiled. He did adore it… It would be a shame to have to leave the shop without it. "Do you like it?" Sapphire asked, smile on her face. He hadn't even realized he'd reached up to gingerly touch the pendant.
Narcissa smiled as she held out a vial. “It’s already set, dear. Let’s go, then.” They watched as the silver strands pooled and curled around each other in the vial, and they went upstairs to where Narcissa's pensieve was set up. She poured it into the shallow bowl and took Harry's hand in her own, giving it a comforting squeeze. They both bent down and were submerged in the memory.
Harry couldn't hear what Snape was saying to Dumbledore. He didn't know if the Headmaster had used a Mufleato on him as well. He was helpless to save his mentor, his friend-- Then Snape pulled his wand on the old man and cast the curse.
I spent the entire night as a wolf, from the moment the moon rose. As such, I didn't read your letter until this morning. You sweet thing… This past moon might be the last you ever have to spend alone, depending on when you decide to come home. I'm glad that your potion put you more at ease. I take it you had very few problems brewing it, no major disasters or Finnegan-level explosions? Hah, made myself laugh there.
“He does not know much of your pre-Hogwarts years, but I’ve been able to guess a few things from his letters over the years.” She cleared her throat and suddenly a box appeared on her lap. Opening it, she pulled out a few letters.
Harry spent the night out in the waiting room, long after the receptionist had left and security had asked him to leave. He hadn’t left, curled up in a ball on the worn leather sofa, and security had left him alone. He needed to know Draco was alive and doing alright, even if that meant waiting until normal visiting hours opened at 10am. “Mr. Potter?” Jolting at hearing his name called, Harry looked up to the healer that was standing next to the sofa. “You… ought to come with us.”
Still, the dragon was calm, and was paying attention to him, and seemed to like his voice. Now was as good a time as any to get that collar on him, now that he had his trust. Moving towards his bag, Harry kept talking. “You know, that’s something that Ginny and Hermione both smacked into me a few months ago. I like Quidditch players that care about their family. Isn’t that something? Guess I like a person that can handle a big piece of wood between their legs.”
“I’ve heard tales, of course, of all the legendary skipped meals between the both of you.” Draco Malfoy, that dirty little
“They're the same picture from the same book, I'm pretty sure they're matching.”
Draco grumbled with his arms crossed as he followed them. “Don’t see why it’s so difficult to just bloody say my name.”
Think about what kind of collar you’d prefer, love.
Her smile warmed the room, it felt like. “That’s a very lovely gesture, Harry.”
A quick tap of his wand to the broom restored his Firebolt to its original size. Seeing that Harry’s plan was to fly, the dragon snapped its teeth at him, making Harry jump back, and then immediately onto his broom.
“We're having a baby?” Harry nods. “But you aren't on any potions for conception-?”
“He says that he’s safe and taking care of himself, and that he needs time away.”
Narcissa was frowning at him in the mirror. “You don’t know your family?”
Draco smiled. “This… This was nice. I’d like to do this again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm trying to keep all the characters as true to the books as I can, but keep in mind it's been a while since I've read them. If anything or anyone seems OOC, let me know! Or if I'm doing a good job, please comment!
I hope you come home soon, sweetheart. I miss you terribly. Prepare to receive a 'big big hug' from me, too.
Harry paused, looking at her through the mirror. "Ah, what do you mean? What potion?" Potions ran in his family, besides his mum?
Sincerely,
“Oh, you’ve never been on it? That’s okay, we’ll get you used to it. I’ll get your tickets, okay?”
There was a knock at his bedroom door. “Draco, my love?” It was Gwen. “I have breakfast. I wasn’t sure if you’d be up to coming downstairs…”
“Oh, should we talk about the time then that you got on Dean because he wasn’t folding his clothes right?” Ron’s ears went bright red as his wife and best friend laughed at him before he chuckled alone.
“Here, I’ll tell you something. How about-”
“It is, yes. Sirius was… He was a fire, ever burning, and consuming anyone in his path.” Before Harry had realized it, he’d teared up, watching the photo loop a few times. He took off his glasses and wiped his eyes, sighing shakily.
Harry decided he would finish the hunt for Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes, as Dumbledore had been. He would assure that the Headmaster did not die in vain… He would see this through, and he would kill Voldemort. One scrap of soul at a time.
Harry watched the dark forest form around them and had the briefest thought that this was a bad idea. He had been a scared thirteen-year-old and now he was going to show Narcissa that his favorite professor/pseudo-uncle had nearly killed him? Sure, her cousin/his godfather had saved them, and Snape had also sort of been required to save them…
“Not at all, Harry dear, come in, come in! Oh, it’s been ages since you’ve called around. The house is so
That does sound lovely, when I eventually come home. Taking time for myself right now feels as though it's helping me in ways I didn't know I needed. Let's go back to that earlier bit, though...
"I was endearing as hell," he said, like it was a known fact. "I picked them up-- most of them, and I paid for my strawberries, my ego only
I had no idea there were other Malfoys, as Draco told me a number of times that he was one of the last. I’m glad to know that this is not the case. How did he find you? How was his transformation? Was he in a lot of pain? His mother and I worry for him every day, so news that he’s being cared for by family is the best news I could get. Thank you for keeping his, ah, condition a secret.
I am curious to say, how has your animagus training been coming along? Have you discovered what your form will be, yet? I’m ashamed to say I don’t know much of that branch of magic. You don’t get to choose what you become, do you? I have to say, I would be beside myself with laughter if you were to become a cat. Or, say — a peacock? They were just so awfully fond of you at the Manor, chasing you whenever you stepped foot in the yard.
Welp! Hope you're on the edge of your seat! From here on out, it's all chaos. Abandon canon, all ye who enter here!
“I look ridiculous,” he repeated. Bas came over and fiddled with Draco’s shirt a bit, undoing a third button and exposing a bit more of his pale chest.
She lets you call her “Aunt Andy”? Mother lets you call her that? I still have to call her “Aunt Andromeda”! Of all the indignities! Apparently you get to be a real part of the family, don’t you. And I’m not even there for it. Of all the wrongs of the world…
“Of course I will, Molly. Thank you.”
His parents would’ve only been seven years old. That was a very strange thought. Narcissa flipped a few more pages, showing him pictures of her parents, and her sisters, until… the photo was blurry at first, the person in it not staying still like the other subjects were.
His long tail dragged on the ground and his wings drooped. His entire huge pearly body went still and his head drooped, looking down at the clawed up earth in front of him. Harry was easily able to slide from his perch at the dragon’s neck onto the ground, now getting nervous.
You're absolutely right that things aren't fair, and that you (and every other werewolf) would be treated differently in almost any workplace. I'm not sure if you're following Hermione's ongoing fight for creature rights and equality, but she's making headway. She's been writing and revising bills like a fiend. (Honestly I think she would benefit from your ideas. Maybe send her an owl? Or you can just pay her a visit when you return.)
A dark blush crept over his face and neck and he nodded, thinking of his father and godfather's blatant disregard for the Ministry rules. "Yes, ma'am. To be fair, I'm also not doing this at 14." That would've been impossible, with everything going on at the time.
“I’ve… I’ve got a cousin. He’s six, now. He’s a metamorphmagus. Teddy Tonks. His grandmother was a Black.”
“Just a wrap,” Draco hummed as he looked over the file again. For being such a priss that probably used to love having grand banquets, one of Draco’s favorite lunches seemed to be a chicken wrap.
Instantly, he was in Auror mode, ready for an investigation or a fight. Was it a dark artifact? Some sort of ritual that could bring Voldemort back, or give unspeakable powers to another dark witch or wizard—? “Come on,” she told him with a smile. “It’s down in the sitting room. I thought we could look it over together.”
"You're an odd thing, aren't you?" Harry asked, continuing to pet the great beast like it was a large cat or a particularly sweet dog. "I mean that in the best way, of course. You're a very good listener. Could talk to you about anything, couldn't I? And who else gets to say they've napped on a dragon and lived to tell the tale? Not bloody many people, that's who." He paused, looking back at the bandaged wing. "...Where did you come from, I wonder?" He hummed a bit, wondering if he should contact a few foreign reserves or dragon ranches. There was no way this dragon didn't grow up around people. He was too… social not to have been.
felt like another day at the office, with the wit and snark between them. It… gave Harry a great idea.
See you soon, my love.
She laughed, patting his arm as they set up the stairs. "Harry, dear, you flatter me. I'll be turning fifty this year, though."
Harry nodded along and hummed.
Draco knew war was coming and he had a strong gut feeling that it would be coming to Hogwarts. And he couldn't help but worry, living or not.
"So I don't end up being the Boy Who Lived Thrice," he said, with a wink. He finished his coffee and closed the file. "Right. Six pm, Auror Malfoy." He always liked to tease Draco, calling him that.
“Harry, what brings you by this morning?”
“Oh. Well… Well, if you insist,” he finally agreed. Window shopping might be fun… especially if both he and the clerk knew that he wasn't engaged or on his way to being bonded. “Do you specialize in any particular gems or metals?”
Draco nodded to them. "Draco Malfoy."
While Harry had heard of Celesti Alley, he hadn’t had much occasion to shop there. It was a bit out of the way, a side street or two off Diagon, and tended to have fancier, more expensive shops. Hermione and Ron had gone to a fancy restaurant there to celebrate their first anniversary, that much Harry remembered. Ah, what had it been called… Sorcery Soiree? Something like that, at least. The shops at least were supposed to have really good quality stuff. Maybe he’d ask around a bit more before popping over there. “Thanks, Molly.”
his choice."
Draco
“Oh, yeah,” Harry said with a nod. “I’ve never been able to smell my own magic before though.” McGonagall waved her hand and shook her head a bit.
“I didn’t topple,” he huffed.
until it was done.” She placed the box on the table. “My own sister tortured me while my son took the Mark, and he was told Lucius and I would be killed if he did not take it. This was also when my son was ordered to kill Dumbledore.” She smoothed her skirt over her lap. “I suspect ee knew my son would not succeed… likely, he wanted us out of the way at that point.”
He chuckled despite himself. “No, no. Draco.”
Don’t think you can just get away with buying clothes with the intent of giving them to me. I’ve got a keen new werewolf nose. It has to be yours, or it just won’t do. How did Teddy do with the moon, speaking of? Anything we should be worried about?
Baby,
“I can’t imagine how painful that must’ve been, being branded like that,” she said, beginning the sketch. “You don’t have to worry, this one won’t hurt nearly as much.” She’d had been right; he hadn’t teared up, even during the shading.
Tears began to come to his eyes unbidden. “I- I didn’t come here on holiday. I ran from home. On our latest Auror raid, it all went wrong, and… And I was bitten.”
Harry didn’t know what to focus on. But Draco— he called himself ‘darling’. That was the first time he’d reacted well to a pet name. ...maybe Gwen was right? That seemed like it was Draco’s subtle, backhanded roundabout way of saying that he wanted something with Harry. Wanted Harry to call him those sweet names. Harry grinned to himself.
Hope you enjoy!
"He's, ah, taking his holiday in France. He needs a bit more rest and relaxation than I do. He's the one that was injured." He rubbed the back of his neck again. "When he gets back, I plan on courting him, though."
The last time a student had died in the castle, poor Myrtle Warren had seen the Heir of Slytherin's basilisk head-on and perished on the spot. Albus had only been deputy headmaster at the time, and he knew the decision to keep Myrtle’s death a secret had not been an easy one for Headmaster Dippet, but widespread panic through the student body had to be circumvented.
“Was he a good baby? Did he, I don’t know, cry a lot, or was he fussy?”
“Oh, don’t worry, I lost plenty of weight afterwards. I dropped about nine stones of deadbeat weight, after I found out I was pregnant.”
"How could I forget?" He grinned up at Draco and took another sip of his coffee. "I have the most meticulous and prepared partner in the DMLE. That might be why they gave you to me in the first place."
” This wasn’t making sense, though it was true, he did have a stellar record with the Aurors, but… This was something else entirely. The waiter was grinning at him, even as he summoned a pitcher of water and a glass for Draco’s table. Watching him carefully, Draco slowly poured himself a glass, taking a sip and whetting his lips.
“I knew you were more clever than you made it seem.” That… No wonder Draco gave such left handed compliments. It
Harry shrugged. “Probably because Dumbledore was too busy worrying about horcruxes and an impending war to focus on my clothes or my shoes.”
"Well— erm, when things get busy, it's usually the first thing that slips my mind… I don't mean to forget, you know?"
“Just about, yes.”
[[included with this letter is a pair of red and blue tartan sleep shorts. A bit comfier and softer than boxers, it’s obvious Harry has been wearing them to bed for at least a few days. The scent is nice and strong… different than the tee shirts he’s sent before]]
and before he knew it, he was whining quietly, but for what, even he didn’t know.
“No way to tell for sure. I tried to get close, the thing looked at me and it was scared, but then…” The older man shook his head. “I don’t know. It’s like he recognized me—definitely male. He really looked at me, and decided just like that that he
Thank you for the chocolate. It’s fine here, but having it sent from home makes it taste sweeter.
She glanced back at the body and closed her eyes, leaning against Albus’ great desk. “We-- what do we tell the students? The staff? Severus? The boy's parents?” Her tone had taken on a steely quality. The Malfoys would not be so easily Obliviated.
He’d be working from prickly square one again, but that was okay. Harry had all the time in the world, and this time he would be easing the way past Draco’s defenses with courting gifts and grand gestures. “Is that Draco’s newest letter?” Just like Molly, she was. It was terrifying, really.
"Oh excellent! Miranda's family owns and operates a vineyard in Tuscany. This is a lovely
“They’re wizards, the lot of them.”
I'm sure I can convince Teddy that pastels are better for walls, and the bright colors can stay in his hair. I think the purple and turquoise will be nice. He'll need a room similar in Hogwarts, too, you know. I'll leave the decorating of our quarters to you, so long as everything isn't emerald green. Pastels for us, too? And of course you're a cuddler… the thought of snuggling you and Teddy by the fire warms my heart. Oh Draco, can you imagine our first Christmas with him as our son? I imagine we'll end up spoiling him, won't we?
Though there was no light, the diadem sparkled high above the mess as if lit with moonlight. Silver-white light illuminated the large blue stone and Harry grinned. Hogwarts made it easy; Hogwarts wanted him to win.
That all really does sound lovely, though, and helps to calm my temper down… You’d like if I pulled on your hair, wouldn’t you? Used it to guide you around the room, or up and down the bed. Up and down my cock? Of course, if it pleased you, I’d like the reverse, as well… Would you like that? Having me at your beck and call, then? But you know I’d fight you at every turn… Maybe you’d need to put a little collar and leash on me to prove who I really belonged to?
"My pleasure. Now!" She clapped her hands once. "If we can pry my husband away from his watch repair, maybe we can go get some lunch."
Defense Against the Dark Arts
“Hey Elise, is he in the back? Drawing for someone?” Valerie walked towards the back of the shop, and Draco followed her. Naturally, the buzzing got louder as he approached, and he was just a little entranced. “This is our cousin Draco, from England, by the way. Bas and I are taking him out for the day.”
“Oh- Oh, no, I wasn’t planning on-” But she was already waving her hand and shaking her head, tutting at him and cutting him off.
Speaking of clothing, you're not getting your pants or your shirt back. I've been wearing them to bed, they're incredibly comfortable.
Now it seemed like the dragon was barely listening to him, his wings spreading out on either side of him. He was growling and snarling at Harry and alright, alright. He needed to be careful here, if he didn’t want to end up right next to Charlie in the hospital. This dragon could breathe fire, if the smoke coming out of his nostrils was anything to go by, so he needed to be careful about that.
"Cause he's a spoiled little brat that's already got you round his finger. All he needs to do is crook it and you're there."
And you berk, you know well enough by now that my working isn’t about the money. If it were, I’d be like my father and stick strictly to business and to politics, as that
“Got some… strawberries. Why?”
“Oh, you were together?” Harry paused, looking at his friend as she took a long sip of her tea.
"Draco, lovely to see you." She gently held his shoulders and greeting him with cheek kisses. Draco begrudgingly smiled at the greeting that was starting to grow on him.
“Yes, I’d say about a third of our family doesn’t have magic,” Gwendolyn said, shifting Felix up onto her shoulder. He made a little noise in his sleep and settled. Draco watched the babe for a moment before slowly letting his eyes float up to make contact with Gwendolyn’s.
“Gin?”
Running after Snape had done him no good. Even Sectumsempra hadn't taken him down, and Snape then revealed that he had invented the spell. Snape was the half-blood Prince, and he'd set fire to Hagrid's hut for good measure as he fled the grounds.
“He was my mother’s younger brother, and she thought of him fondly and often.” He gently squeezed Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh, no. He’s the type that would have confronted me about it, if it had mattered so much.” Harry rushed headfirst into everything, why hadn't he done that with him? Draco had fully expected a row that morning, and instead Harry had just followed his lead, stiffly saying nothing. “I don’t have much hope for the situation.”
It wasn't every day that an international letter came for Karamo Brown via an official MACUSA owl. It was a weighty thing, with a thick envelope made to survive international travel, and sealed with the dark plum wax of the British Ministry for Magic.
a term for a person’s magical core reacting violently to suppression of the person’s magic.” She paused, and Harry noted a look of sadness pass over her face. “When magical children were born into homes or cultures that persecuted magic, they often tried to push it down or bottle it up, and they developed what was called an
He nodded and entered. "Thank you for having me."
Sorry for the lack of our ghostly lad, I promise he's coming up! (Still taking name suggestions, btw.)
The Aurors Internal Affairs office was empty except for Belinda that morning when Harry arrived. He'd done this on purpose. Belinda looked up from her Shifting Sudoku, cat-eye reading glasses perched on her nose and secured with a long beaded chain. "Oh, hello, Harry. What can I do for you this morning?"
"Well, the way you charge into danger, I can certainly see the likeness,” he chuckled.
Though Harry’s letter was a bit brash and blunt in places… it was obvious that he cared for Draco and his comfort, as well as his general safety. Draco did have to admit that it was rather sweet, even if he did completely and blatantly ignore Draco’s attempts to get him to leave him alone. Couldn’t he see that it would be better for everyone involved if Draco was left to wallow by himself? Still, that Harry would consider such a difficult level of magic for Draco’s sake… Only in another life, it seemed.
“Yeah, you’re right,” he nodded. “I figured that part out.”
“Well, my mother is a Malfoy. Or, well, was. She was disowned long before you or I were born.” He tilted his head a bit and focused on Draco’s face. “Abraxas was my uncle, though I never met him.”
“It’s better for all involved if he doesn’t.”
“Of course,” Draco said with a smile. “I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur.”
You already know what the answer would be.
The thought of Bellatrix as a young child threw him for a loop, as did the thought of Andy and Narcissa even younger than her. He led her into the cozy breakfast nook where their tea was set-up. "Do you have any pictures? Of anything from when you were a little girl?" The underlying question is
She leaned back in her seat and Harry ate some more of his food just to have something to do. “Draco, ever since he was a boy, has always been incredibly nervous. Even shy, sometimes.” She must have seen something on his face because her smile broadened. “Surprising, is it? He’s gotten incredibly good at hiding, since he’s grown up.”
Just because I'm not well-versed in BDSM doesn't mean I'm not a Gryffindor. I was a bit busy fighting a war and catching bad guys and not realizing the two of us were dating to experiment much. Please forgive me, darling. I'll definitely take those books from Pansy.
“My offer stands, Mr. Malfoy’s current condition aside.” So even if he said no, even if he washed his hands of the idea of teaching… She was still going to teach him. He bit his lip.
Albus frowned slightly, but nodded his head. He could not force them to abandon their son, no matter how dead he was. “Of course, Narcissa. We will be ready when you decide to return.”
My love,
Dear Draco,
"Just, um. I do have
“Me- No, no, I- I have no need for anything such as that,” he quickly told them, shaking his head before sipping on his wine to hide his blush.
"None of your business," he growled, voice tight with emotion. He didn't have to share his entire bloody tragic life story with them, blood relations or not. "I think I should go--"
Grinning, Draco quickly sat himself down and opened up the letter.
Ta for now babes. Hope you enjoyed.
Draco frowned, looking down at himself. "I am comfortable." Dressed in black tailored slacks and a light blue button-down shirt that Blaise had recommended, he was dressed much more casually than he normally was. He owned exactly zero tee shirts… except the one that Harry had sent. He didn't see that there was anything wrong with the way he was dressed. He preferred his higher quality materials to those you could get at any shop. Maybe he could find a way out of it.
He watched for a second more to see what the dragon would do next, but it seemed that he—was it a he? Harry couldn’t tell from where he was—was down for good. The dragon was making strange whuffling noises, but wasn’t trying to get up or fly away.
If Harry didn’t love him so fucking much, this would be a lot harder to bear.
Draco thought it over for a moment. “R… Right.”
"How- How did she reach out?
You’re so absolutely over the moon.
With the moon waning, I’m feeling more and more like myself. Those days of and around the full moon — it felt like someone else was trying to take control. Or maybe some small forgotten part of me that had been shoved away. I didn’t recognize it, if that’s so.
“Silly you, I haven’t got magic like you or Bas do.”
Draco’s nose wrinkled. “I think I’ll be more than fine watching, ta ever so.” Tristan, between shoving apple slices in his mouth, looked at Draco and began giggling terribly. Draco frowned at him. “And what do you think is so funny?”
Draco scoffed, looking back up at Harry. “Do you even know who you’re asking?”
"I suppose I am a small amount peckish." They rounded the corner and Draco was suddenly faced with a dozen people, all cooking or setting the table or discussing which wines they would have that evening.
I could only imagine Great Aunt Walburga rolling in her grave. Mother’s told me horror stories, of course, so such a thought only warms my heart.
“Yeah. My core is a magic heart. Is it… Does that mean that something could hurt it? Can I get, like, a core attack, or something?” Minerva looked a bit surprised, like she hadn’t expected Harry to ask a medical question.
The halls were practically deserted, most of the time. The students abandoned the castle each May and returned on September 1st, leaving Hogwarts with precious few residents over the summer. That year, the students and staff seemed to vanish all at once, what with the death of the Headmaster and the infiltration of Death Eaters so close to the end of term. Were he in his usual mind, Draco wouldn't have blamed them at all… however, being freshly murdered and undead weighed heavily upon his psyche.
He arrived at the entrance to the Hogwarts grounds and hummed to himself as he made his way towards the greenhouses. He hoped Neville wouldn’t be too cross with him about needing another leaf. “Harry, mate! Out here!” Hearing his name called, he looked over and saw where Neville was waving to him from a garden. Harry grinned and walked over to him.
If I use your name, I'll dedicate the chapter to you!
He blinked a few times, but shook his head. "Not at all, I've just put the kettle on." He opened his mouth once more to ask her about the luggage, but thought better of it. "Why don't you leave all that here, and we'll go to the nook?"
“Wonderful. Come by any time. Maybe Remy and I could take you to lunch.”
What on earth was that supposed to mean?
Karamo sat back at his desk, amazed at the heartfelt and heavy letter in his hand. There was so much information to sort through… but he knew what he had to do first.
Sincerely,
"Only temporary hallucinations, Mr. Potter, and like I said, you have nothing to worry about. Now, like I said, the next step requires meditation. You need to keep the leaf in your mouth for 28 days, while spending at least an hour each day meditating and trying to visualize your magical core-- the glow, the color, the feel of it, sometimes even the scent or taste."
“Is everyone else here, yet, I’m starved,” Draco’s inked twin remarked as October handed him a glass of wine.
About a year and a half ago, Draco and I finally finished a long and very high profile case. We’d worked dozens of hard hours to put it to bed, and were exhausted when we solved it. So I invited him to mine, to celebrate with dinner.
taken a potion that wasn’t crafted especially for him, since the moment of his birth, every potion and medicine had been tailored to his needs. No wonder Snape seemed to like Draco so much. He must have known him since we was incredibly small. If Draco had never once had an over-the-counter potion, did that mean he took potions as a baby, too? Did the Wizarding World have anything similar to vaccines? He guessed not, as no Healer had ever brought them up, not even Pomfrey.
” Storm tipped her head back and laughed before shaking her head.
Hope flared hot and bright in Harry’s chest.
“In other cases, I think you following him would be his goal, Harry,” she added, standing up to get the plum tart from the oven. “It’s just about… knowing what he needs from you.”
It wasn’t long before Draco and Harry were at the raid site, Draco setting up the wards, and Harry securing the perimeter.
And promptly came in his pants.
Luna and I mail frequently, actually, it seems that they’ve been considering it, but want to wait and be sure, same as we do. Though they seem to have been putting much more thought into it together than we seem to have.
At least she seemed to take delight in the mix-up. “I do. Tristan’s dad. He didn’t stick around long after the announcement came.”
“Luna, you definitely weren’t there to see it happen— it was on our last raid, there were no civilians—“
“Probably around the end of fifth year, when he shot up,” he joked, smiling down at the photo. “He’s… he’s tiny.” He rubbed the back of his neck and glanced up at Narcissa. “Was it- was it difficult? Having him?”
Yours, with love,
He would have to make sure his own wolfsbane was strong and perfect, which would take a few tests, and only once it had gone correctly a few times could he even consider going back home. Sure, he and Aunty Gwen had been fine this past moon, but it had been an off-the-shelf potion.
“Right, well, if he comes round, send me an owl, yeah? His mother and I are looking for him.”
“Oh alright, that’s good.” He had no idea what the fuck a trimester was. Apparently Hermione was out of her first one? He didn’t know. He looked up at Ron and gave him a deprecating smile. “Alright there, mate?”
The rest of the family was quiet, though grins were spreading across each and every face. (Except Felix, he was very much asleep.) Gwendolyn cleared her throat. “Have you thought of asking to be reassigned partners, if he infuriates and antagonizes you so?”
"Perhaps give it a bit of time before you try again… you might he more comfortable trying this at home. And use the sticking charm." Harry nodded and pocketed the leaf. "Oh, and Potter?"
"No, I didn't. He wasn't with Pansy or Blaise, and he didn't go back to St. Mungo's. They've all said they'll owl if he turns up, though."
With all he and Luna had ended up talking about, courting traditions hadn't been one of them. There was only one more functional couple he knew of that might have any idea about courting traditions. He just hoped it wasn’t too embarrassing.
“Oh.” He said quietly. So… So it was possible. If they’d done anything a little different, he really could have been an Obscurial. He wasn’t entirely sure what to do with that information, only looking to McGonagall. She was Headmistress, she
“You don’t have your license to Apparate?” She turned to look at him just as the train rushed into the station, moving her halo of bushy hair with the wind from it.
“Thank you, Harry. Not many would say the same about my darling Draco.”
Draco was up on his feet— paws?— in an instant and padded over to her, his tail wagging. He approached her, almost whining in question.
Opening the door with a smirk fixed on his face, he let one arm hand at his side while his other hand was tucked into one of the pockets. “Well?”
-magical hijinks while the guys are helping him! Karamo definitely has his work cut out for him boi, they're dealing with a reclusive abused war orphan turned hero.
And she was right. Harry was tired of apologies, by now. He was tired of people he barely knew saying they were so sorry for everything he had to go through, right before they practically threw themselves at his feet. He was tired of the people who’d stayed so firmly in the middle give half-arsed apologies to try to win their way into his good graces. But most of all… He was tired. He said nothing in response, and after a while, McGonagall simply nodded once and changed the subject, saying he was welcome to stay for tea, if he desired, but their lesson was finished for the day.
“Hi there. You must be Draco. I’m Ametrine, come on in. October’s been going on and on about you.” The young woman grinned at him, and gestured for him to enter, which he did. “Gosh, you look like you’re freezing— come to the kitchen, you’ll warm up nice and quick.” Her thick mahogany braid swayed a bit as she walked, leading him towards where the conversation and delicious smells were originating.
Narcissa smiled. "Just perfect, darling. You just might be able to make it."
“No… I don’t know if I even am, yet. We had an… incident, a little over a year ago.” They both zeroed in on his face, attention solely on Draco and his story.
Overall, the information Harry collected after that didn’t seem too relevant or important. But what he’d gotten at the beginning. Of course, living in the Wizarding World, and what with the Deathly Hallows, Harry had learned never to doubt legends in the Wizarding World. A line of wizards that can transform into dragons at will? And they weren’t animagi, so that meant they weren’t registered. But then, why would someone attack Charlie? Okay, he couldn’t let himself get carried away with this. First things first, he needed to focus on a dragon that was probably lost and scared.
“Poor ickle dragon, his fires don't burn so hot now, do they?” Peeves stared at him from the ceiling, grinning like some cat that got the canary. “Our little Slytherin prince has gone all silver!” He cried, and Draco frowned slightly.
He was glad that he hadn’t shifted in the hotel… he would’ve been much worse off, hadn’t even thought about food for the morning of. He was glad Gwendolyn had spent the night with him, painful and frightening as both transformations were. Sighing softly to himself, Draco supposed that he had ought to head down to the table for lunch.
that animal. The first few serious attempts will feel like learning to Apparate, from my experience."
Oh, another letter. Today was a busy owl day, wasn't it- Oh! McGonagall!
Draco nodded. “That, I understand, otherwise there’d be no reason for the family history to have been erased.”
I will take Ginevra's wager, as well, and counter it with a Quaffle Puncher win by seventy points. I’m sending this to you and Luna so there’s two instances of accountability. How much is she placing down?
Fourth year.
I couldn’t even function and I still can’t, it feels like it did something to me. My heart hurt and
Hooray, new chapter! It's midterm season for a lot of us, so why not take a short little break and read our new addition? :) -M
“We were all young, and foolish. Some of us grew out of it, though.” She turned to the next picture, which showed Andromeda holding the camera, taking a photo in the mirror. She looked to be nearly the same age as Bellatrix was in the previous photo. “Some of us… took a little longer.” The picture was of Andromeda in what looked like a muggle dress. It was…
Harry nodded and finished off his sandwich. It would be nice getting home at a reasonable hour, maybe be able to push the paperwork until tomorrow morning… he could already imagine the little lie-in he'd have… Now the raid just had to go right. Right. Cause everything was just that easy for Harry bloody Potter.
“Yes I did. We had a good talk about it, too,” Gabriel mused, leaning over to kiss his husband’s freckled cheek. “But in the end, I just did what felt right. Besides, Uncle Alistair took his wife’s family name.”
I also received a letter co-written by my mother and my aunt. They’re both happy for us, though are threatening you and I simultaneously to take care of one another. That means that mother adores you.
If I were to come back I wouldn’t be able to keep my job. My nerves will be shot the closer the moon gets just thinking about it, the day and night of the full moon will be out completely, including the day after. But Merlin do I want to come home.
” Brushing them to the side nearly silently, he heard a thick crack and the same sound as before followed immediately after.
He followed her out the door and walked beside her, noticing that she kept walking past perfectly fine Apparition points. And they hadn’t taken the Floo network either. “How… are we going to be getting there, exactly?”
“And a piece of advice. If you ever need a bit of space, pretend to go out for a smoke. It’s worked for me since I was 16.” He gave him a wink and a nudge in the arm with his elbow before he walked off. “See you around, cousin,” he called, before disappearing through the Floo the same way he’d arrived.
He followed her, wary as to what it might be, pausing in the doorway as he spied a thick white and silver book on the table. ...Surely this wasn’t a spellbook. Narcissa sat down on the couch in front of the coffee table and glanced to the seat beside her before looking back up at Harry with a raised eyebrow. Right. Apparently he had to sit there with her. He took his seat and bit his lip. She pulled the large book into her lap and moved a bit closer to Harry, so he could easily see.
“...well she certainly
“And that’s okay. You’ll adjust to them just as they will adjust to you. Right now, you’re shiny, new, and the most interesting person in the room.” She patted his cheek. “I promise you, time mellows us all.”
Neville nodded. “Yeah. Try to visit more often, alright? The papers don’t add up to the real thing.” Harry laughed and give his friend a little salute as he headed towards the door.
“There’s a chance he’d go to his mother.” That momma’s boy. “That’s the first place I can think of.” If he was with Narcissa, Harry would be bringing him straight back here. “Thank you so much for saving him… he scared me so much.”
Draco smiled at everyone as they all seemed to begin to have their own conversations- “So, Draco!” Oh dear. He’d spoken too soon. October had, once again, turned his sights on Draco. “Tell us some of your Auror tales, I’m sure you have a number of fantastic adventures with Mr. Potter.”
He gave a small sigh, nodding his head as best he could. “Yes, I’m fine.” She gently rubbed over his cheekbones with her thumbs, trying to comfort and soothe him.
Harry stared, putting a hand on the dragon’s snout. “You… Want me to keep talking?” It didn’t nod, but it seemed like that was what he wanted. “Alright. Alright, okay. I can keep talking, don’t worry. What do you want to hear about? My Auror training? Most people get a laugh out of that. You know Ron did better than I ever could have? I think because he’s big on chess and strategy, and I…”
“That’s what I’ve been told.”
My darling readers! Thank you for voting on which option you liked the best.
Draco couldn't help a smile at the letter, already beginning to reread it before he was shaken from his thoughts.
"If my theory is correct, this just means you have more magical power to manipulate into your Animagus form. Assuming you learn how to reshape your core, the transformation should be incredibly easy for you. It might even take less time than the average witch or wizard."
Harry
“You want me to sit there?” he asked incredulously. This had quickly moved from simply being on the top 10 list of strangest interactions he’d had with wild creatures to being the strangest encounter. The dragon looked at him as if Harry was the one that was crazy, as if to say, you wanted to sit down—so I made you a place to sit. What’s so hard to understand about that?
He took a few hesitant steps forward before settling in on his bed. He could already catch whiffs of the shirt… He couldn't help himself. In all of a moment, he was naked and the door was locked, wards up to prevent anyone hearing him. He carefully lifted the soft fabric up to his face and breathed in.
Tapping the quill to his tongue briefly, Draco set the letter aside to dry. Now for his letter to Harry…
It was good that she had a plan, really. And they were already visiting each other pretty much daily anyway, and Grimmauld had more than enough rooms to spare. Plus, she was his future mother-in-law (hopefully) and a Black besides. "Do you already know which room you'd like?"
"Perhaps you ought to inform him, then, my dear. If you want him to court you, that is." She sighed dreamily and sat down between the two of them. "My sweet Hudson, gods rest his soul, he courted me right without realizing it. Sure, he didn't know the specific words… but he did it all the same."
"Quite literally, dear, but thank you for noticing," she replied, tucking the necklace-- Harry's necklace-- into a little black box for safekeeping. She attached a note reading 'For Draco's Bonding' to the box and vanished it to their vault.
All my love,
The dragon just grumble-growled at him and turned it's big horned head away from Harry. Huh.
Dinner with Narcissa Malfoy… does one dress up for it? Robes, or would nice Muggle clothes do? Christ— Harry would be getting an earful from Draco right now… He'd ask Blaise or Pansy, but they'd just take the piss or give bad advice on purpose. Harry could already hear Hermione’s voice in his head. ‘
Narcissa only leaned over and patted his hand. “So? Tell me, then. What are your intentions?”
“He’s brilliant at potions and charms, I don’t see why he wouldn’t be. And if he got me to do my paperwork every week, he can definitely handle the homework.”
“We have to explicitly say that they'd be making over a fellow wizard, and therefore the episode wouldn't be going on muggle television.”
He felt the hairs pushing up through his skin, and his teeth changing and reforming in his mouth, and he hated every moment of it.
For now, I’ve bought myself an over-the-counter bottle, but soon I will be brewing my own, a practice which in Britain is frowned upon. Yet another reason to stay away.
“That was many years ago. I only remember that I had numbing spells on me, and it lasted around six hours.” Wow, six hours. And then, baby Draco.
Hello again, love. Hope you enjoyed yourself there, and that I didn’t overdo anything. Let me know if I overstepped any boundaries.
“Sometimes. Not often, but sometimes. Not even when I’m having a bad day, just…” He didn’t know how to explain it.
"He has… almost never seemed shy. Anxious, sure, but I always thought he had a sort of… theatrical personality? I thought he liked being the center of attention."
Draco felt his cheeks flush. “No, no, really-” But the bottle was already floating towards him. Damn their hospitality. He was doomed from the start.
“Right— this is Valerie and Tristan’s room, they’ve got a bit of flu, so we’re letting them rest. Any other room is yours for the choosing, my lovely, except the master bedroom. I’m just at the end of the hall, if you need me.”
“Right, I guess he was…” He took another deep breath and met her steady gaze. “Any pictures of you in Hogwarts robes, then?” And they turned the page.
Harry couldn’t help but to laugh as he shook his head at Ron. “You turned into your mum.” Ron put his fists at his waist and scowled at Harry, doing one of the best ‘Cross Molly’ impressions he’d ever seen. Luckily his wife cut in.
“I thought not,” Gwen huffed, smile on her face as Draco came downstairs. Tristan was already in her arms, and Valerie was putting a bit of lipstick on in the mirror.
“Dresses can be washed, Harry. Now come here, this is only the first album.”
Narcissa still sobbed over the body of their son, but the two men were silent. Lucius slowly stood and approached his wife and child. Though Draco may not have died at the end of the Dark Lord's wand, he was still responsible for his death.
She blinked a few times, then drew her wand and cast a
Oh, he was talking to the Mandrakes. Harry had only seen them as babies in second year, and boy could they scream then. Could… could Mandrakes talk once they reached adulthood? Maybe he should've paid more attention… It definitely didn’t seem like they could talk. “Georgina, I’m gonna just prune one little leaf, alright? Alfred, don’t worry, I’m not planning on moving either of the two of you, just one little leaf.”
“Ron… you’re so bloody clever.”
“I… I mean, yeah. Yeah, I just would need to find a Pensieve, somewhere.”
I think you would have been a great Quidditch player, but ultimately, you’re right. I think you would have gotten bored of it. I saw you, near the end of the academy, though. You’re a brilliant teacher, even to your peers. I think it’ll really do you good.
“Couple tattoos, like the snitches for you and Harry.”
Yours always,
To be fair, he had also mistaken Andy for Bellatrix when they first met, back during the war.
The 'winning' name was submitted by lovely reader X... If you're reading this, thank you!
“Not going by normal email submission then?” Ron scooched his chair a bit closer to his wife's, peeking over her shoulder and bushy hair to study the bullet-pointed parchment.
“O- Oh. Is it?” So they did know him, then… Still,
"No no, don't take offense, it's only a joke. Gisele has told us multiple times that it will never, ever happen. The going joke is even Sebastien will marry before she does."
If it means so much to you, then I suppose I can send you a little present. Just do try not to get your spunk all over it, yes? That’s an
Narcissa laughed. “Oh, he does do a bit of that, yes. But you know he means well.” Well… Sometimes, yeah. How often did Draco make an insult into some roundabout compliment? Left-handed compliments were deeply embedded in upper class British society, and apparently that weren't for Muggles and magical aristocrats alike.
The spell caught Malfoy straight in the chest and threw him backwards. Instead of creeping closer to investigate what the spell had actually done to Malfoy, Harry turned on his heel and left the bathroom, adrenaline coursing through his system. He didn't return to the Great Hall for breakfast, instead going back to his dormitory to think about what other evils were quickly coming to get him. If Malfoy was bringing cursed objects into Hogwarts, who knew what would happen next.
[[Enclosed is a sealed box of chocolates, the writing written mostly in French. It’s a variety pack. Included is a picture of Draco laying on a bed in an unfamiliar room, a towel is wrapped around him and his head is hanging off the bed looking at the camera, his hair dripping to the floor. One can assume he’s just come from the shower.]]
“Alright, then.” Though… Maybe it would be a better idea to go in with her. He didn't appreciate some of the looks being thrown his way. He shuffled into the shop after Valerie. The shop itself was… intimidating, but not scary. He definitely noticed the loud metallic buzzing noise before he noticed anything else. There was a man — in his 30s probably — lying on his back on the covered leather table near the back of the room, a woman hunched over and seated on a rolling stool beside him. Black gloves on and device in hand, it appeared she was laying out the outline for a larger piece.
are you talking about?”
He doesn't have a shadow, he noticed as he sat in a window looking out at the Black Lake. The revelation coaxed a small laugh out of him-- the first in so, so long-- and it attracted attention.
“Um… Madam Malkin’s, actually. He was getting measured for Hogwarts robes and he just… started the conversation. Didn’t ask who I was or anything.” He smiled at the memory. Gods, they’d both been so tiny back then…
"I get it, I get it-- I know you two haven't filled out form 817-C--"
His smile widened before it began to drop. “I would like that, however I don’t plan on going home anytime soon… May I tell you something? With the understanding you won’t speak a word to another soul?”
Please continue to give support, comments, and suggestions! They help a lot!
“Bonding jewelry? Anything particularly interesting, there?”
-Harry is the same person he is, magical savior, BWL, ya know, but he can't tell the Fab 5 cos they're no-majs
"Thank you so much, prof- Headmistress-- I can't thank you enough--"
“Maybe not… but he might know more people to recommend to her. If we can’t teach, I’d like to help McGonagall how I can.”
“Hi Molly, it’s just me,” he called back, brushing a bit of soot from his tee shirt. Luckily, his hair was still alright. “Are you busy?”
He shook his head as he watched the dragon. “I tell you. Workaholics. He and Hermione are too alike for their own good. If they both ever teamed up for something, I think I’d run for the hills. I’m gonna take your wing now, alright? I’ve got a nice salve, it’ll make whatever’s hurting feel a lot better. It’s right here, right? At the joint?”
“I wanted to ask, um… about when you and Arthur were dating…” He took a breath. “Did he court you?”
He looked down at the other side of the hill, and his eyes widened. Well. That certainly looked like signs of a dragon, if there were ever any. Trees cracked and broken, in a trail that looked like it’d fallen right out of the sky and down the hill. Poor thing was probably hurt then. That wouldn’t help. He’d need to be careful.
his dad had grown up, or
When Harry followed Malfoy into the 6th floor bathroom, he didn't entirely know what he was going to say, only that he's finally going to confront him.
Percy Weasley caught the minister with a nasty hex and grinned. “Hello minister, did I mention I'm resigning?” The twins laughed-- and Draco used all his concentration to push Fred Weasley out of the way of Dolohov's killing curse. The green curse scorched the ground where he stood only moments before.
“Studying?”
“Very good. Will that be all, Harry?”
A letter is received...
That was another issue… all three of them were certain that Harry would be uncomfortable with so many cameras around… so they'd have to come to a compromise with the producers about it… if it would be shown to anyone, afterwards, as well.
“About as bruised as all those strawberries,” she laughed. “It took him a
Harry sighed and put his glasses back on. He looked up at Draco, seeing how focused he was on the file. "Okay. Six it is. You'll be ready?"
“He was found in the toilets this morning by a 4th year Gryffindor student… We believe it was suicide. His wrists were slit, and not by magic.” He paused as Narcissa wailed, burying her face in her son's neck. Of course… this is a lie, but the Malfoys didn't need to know that. Albus saw this as an opportunity to sway two more powerful people towards his side. If he could gain two more spies like Severus, it could be the turning point of the war. Riddle wouldn’t know what hit him.
"Bit of a debrief-slash-planning session with Ron, nothing to worry about. I won't go out there early and on my own." Though he's done it before. Really, Draco is the more responsible one of the pair. "Might get a bite after. Can I bring you back something?"
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. What— what a sweet picture. He cleared his throat as he felt tears well up. He caught Narcissa’s eye and she nodded. “I know… he’s gorgeous, isn’t he?”
I would love to take him in, have him live at Grimmauld with us and your mum. Hell, Andy could come live with us too, Merlin knows we have the space for it. And the five of us are all that’s left of the House of Black, you know? And when we go to teach, we’ll come back for the weekends, or bring him to Hogwarts with us. I’m sure the castle could make room for one more little boy, don’t you think?
“...Well, I’m sorry, but that was the side you and your family chose.”
Something was wrong, here. Something was very wrong. Was this a dragon that had been raised on a foreign reserve? Or maybe on one of those ranches that he and Charlie hated because they skirted the law? Yes, technically they were legal, but only barely, seeing as the point of half of those ranches was to create half-breeds, or new breeds in general. It almost had Harry convinced that that old man had been
Really, Harry, don’t worry so much. Yes, it is quiet, but… I think I needed time to myself. Time without you, or mother, or Blaise or Pansy, or anyone else. Time to reflect.
We are on the precipice of war...
-also he's bi as hell
"Oh-" She paused, taking a moment or two to blow on her nails, pausing for time. "Right. He must be worried for you, if you left that quickly."
“Okay, I’m going to try and be gentle, but I need this on you. The last thing I want to do is hurt you, or get myself killed,” he added under his breath. The dragon let out a particularly threatening hiss and Harry swallowed thickly, quickly reaching into his bag and withdrawing his shrunken Firebolt. He needed to get up behind the dragon’s head to be out of range of the teeth and flames, but still had to be very careful of its spiraled horns, huge wings, and tail.
Might as well get it all out there, Harry. If she knows Draco's side, she should know his.
“What? Merlin-
Harry was stunned for a moment. Had Draco’s mother actually… kissed his head? Cupped his face? He wasn’t entirely sure what to make of it. (He hadn’t thought she’d actually liked him very much. More like tolerated him for Draco’s sake.) “I’ll do my best. I want him home, too.”
"It's important to have role models," Sapphire remarked, mirroring Draco's expression. "And I take it you are definitely not in her line of fire, in the way of possible future husbands?"
“Believe me, I have a few words of my own for him. Thanks for the tea, Narcissa… I’ll tell you if I find him. Send me an owl if he shows up here first? Just to ease my mind, you know?”
Rather than correcting her, he only smiled. “Thank you.”
"I do," she told him, her voice whispersoft. He beamed at her in response, and it seemed to completely light up his face.
“For normal guests, yes,” the nurse conceded. “But your guest is special.”
“Draco? No, we were supposed to do brunch tomorrow, why? You two fighting, again?”
Bloody well hoping your answer will be yes… I’m very much focused on becoming a Potter-Malfoy, you know. Now, I’m not proposing we become bonded and married by letter, or that we do it immediately. Your mum said it’s important that the one doing the courting “make their intentions clear to the other party”. I think I’ve made my intentions with you very clear, Draco my love.
“Enough! Don’t scare the boy off, now!” October boomed, the rest of the family quieting. He grinned at Draco and pulled out the chair beside him, so that he would be at the right of the head of the table, where a matronly woman sat, a baby on her lap and a smile on her face. Oh… was this..?
“Precisely lad! Supposedly the first Animagus was an Ýdr'yiòs descendant that skipped the dragon gene, but still learned to control the transformation, see?” As much as Harry hated to admit it, that made quite a bit of sense.
come home—”
Take- Oh. The collar was still around his neck. This was… Okay, this was
“You didn’t know? Your grandfather. How else did you think the Potters had such a fortune?”
[[a smaller letter seems to bloom from the paper, once Draco has finished the particularly smutty request. It is labeled
“Oh. Well, because when Draco comes back, I’m certain that he’ll come here first. So it’s only a matter of waiting, now.” Oh, when she put it that way, it did make sense.
But Draco had saved a good number of lives that afternoon… Fred Weasley and his twin brother were quietly talking, away from their family, each asking the other what exactly he had seen; who had cast that killing curse?
"No, I don't believe I do. Abraxas' wife was named Marianne, not Gwendolyn, and Septimus' wife was Cressida, if I remember correctly… why do you ask, dear?"
“Well, I needed time to myself. To get myself together.” She nodded slowly, focused on the next layer of pink polish. She couldn't just ask him if he was a werewolf, as that was just as rude as asking if she was a squib. “Excuse me, I’m going to go put this away.” Draco took the letter and ascended the stairs.
“Thank you, Dumbledore,” Narcissa clipped, her mouth drawn into a line. Her dark eyes shone like wet slate. She stood, not looking down at her baby’s body any longer. “Obviously… We need time to grieve… to bury our son. Alone. Because this will be kept between us.” Ever the politician’s wife, Narcissa was only ever as polite as she needed to be. Beneath that, she was steel.
Tears rushed to Lucius’ dull grey eyes. He looked up at Dumbledore, breath caught in his throat. He couldn't breathe-- he couldn't breathe. “What-?” He croaked, tears slipping down his gaunt face. “No-”
He had to sit there and wonder, if Harry were to court him, what would he get him? Maybe he would get him a necklace. Or perhaps he would think Draco full of himself enough to get him a circlet. Draco laughed to himself. Oh Merlin, he didn’t know of Harry’s taste in jewelry, and didn’t know if Harry could guess his… but in his little fantasy, Harry knew exactly what to get him, and how to present it. He would say all the right words, and it would be a very thin chain of white-gold, because he likely didn’t react to silver well anymore, and there would be a small emerald pendant, and he would clip it around Draco’s neck for him and say-
"The real question is 'what haven't we got', darling. Let's go in, shall we?"
Derrick cleared his throat. “Yeah, I don’t. And neither does Valerie. And four of us married non-magies. But I’ve always thought Ametrine has enough magic for the both of us.”
Narcissa stood. “Come on, I’ll show you.”
“No, you weren’t bad for a boyfriend. You were bad for Ginny.”
"We aren't staying on very long. We change lines in a few stops. Besides… it's fun to stand up. When Tristan is with me, I have to sit down or he'll topple over like you did."
"What! You know I'm right, that's why you're not denying it!"
"Sometimes, yes. Though most of the time I worked with magical heirlooms and relics. Like magic mirrors, enchanted weaponry, bonding jewelry, that sort of thing."
How dare you, Harry James Potter,
“I can’t say I’m terribly surprised. He must have written the last one just the morning after.” Harry thought that was the case. This letter seemed… ashamed of being vulnerable, even via letter. Hadn’t Draco trusted him? Well, maybe not so much now, after he was turned? But, well… He had repeated that he missed Harry. He couldn’t have been a completely lost cause. He was just… misguided. That was a pretty good word to describe Draco in general, really. Harry would just have to work a little harder. Nothing he wasn’t already used to. “Harry, I found something while I was at the Manor recently… I thought you might want to see, as well.”
Searching desperately for something, anything to say, Harry found himself saying to the dragon, “You know who I bet would love to see you?”
Harry shook his head softly and blinked a few time, trying to process the new information. "So you think I… you think I made him anxious? Maybe I overwhelmed him..?" Harry
Please, don’t compare me to my father, I’ve had plenty enough of that for my lifetime. As I’m sure you have, as well.
Oh, but wouldn’t it be something magnificent if he accomplished it? Such a feat of magic. Such a… romantic gesture. He shook his head and internally scolded himself.
always wondered if he'd done something to make Draco flee as he had that night. After all, he would've absolutely stopped if Draco had been uncomfortable or against the kissing… but he had seemed like he'd wanted it.
Please write back soon.
Overall, the situation had been handled both gracefully and callously. Myrtle Warren had been buried quietly and her Muggle parents Obliviated to think their poor daughter had died in a car wreck. The students were told it was suicide.
“Right.” Bracing himself for the taste, Harry put the leaf in his mouth and had to immediately fight the urge to gag. The taste was terrible, bitter and bad. The texture made it worse-- fizzy and almost prickly. “Right. Okay. Leaf. Done.”
“Well… he’s basically told me to fuck off, and that he’s safe in France. Fantastic.”
She’s upset and worried for you,
What do you think would look best on me, Master?
I think you would've liked wearing my Quidditch jersey, even if we hadn't gotten together. Maybe you'd have come by the locker rooms and asked for a signature, and we could've had a nice shag in the showers. You'd have been screaming my name at one point or another, darling.
Harry
Miranda shoved him away. “You’re still just as
“Enough of that, or I’ll file against you. You know I will.”
Perhaps, he fleetingly thought, they might have a chance.
Wouldn't have to rhyme, necessarily. Please comment if you have any ideas.
“Don’t you come near me unless it’s to take this
Maybe he could even find a place to eat, perhaps somewhere with a nice steak tartare. It was a rumor that werewolves tended to prefer raw or bloody meat, and Draco found it to have a bit of truth. He felt like he could eat three of his usual chicken wraps. Hm, maybe it led to an increase in metabolism, causing him to need to eat more to keep up? That may require further testing…
“I know the feeling. I just wanted to remind you about my invitation to come by the store for a tour, if you were still interested? No rush, and Mum has the address, so you can ask her.”
Harry
Harry winced. "You're practically having pudding in your tea, Draco." Disgusting. Painfully endearing. "Are you done with your sugar?"
"Oui, perfect, I am starved. I've been repairing an antique since five this morning. Only two cups of coffee, can you believe it? It's a very bad habit, I know, but this watch is amazing. 1847, Draco! 1847 this watch was made."
It took them at least a half an hour to find shoes he didn’t absolutely loathe on sight. They were the ‘high tops’ that Bas had told him about, but they were a simple jet black, rather than the blue Valerie had tried to convince him into. He.. actually liked the way they looked. They make his ankles look slim, and he had to admit, there was something attractive about the shoes. Bas and Val each gave him a thumbs up when he glanced at them for approval. And just like that, he bought his first pair of muggle shoes.
"Oh just come with us, sit and watch the people go by, have some wine. Humor me, Draco." Remy came out at that moment, removing his protective glasses. He beamed, seeing the younger man in his show room.
Mrs. Gwen Roots,
He positioned the wine bottle carefully on his desk, away from his letters and Blaise's bird. Wand in hand, he very carefully pictured Blaise's kitchen in his mind and waved his wand. The bottle disappeared.
“Oh, bugger off. What’d this dragon look like, anyway?”
“I think you like him a lot more than you’re letting on,” Sapphire said, brow arched like she was daring Draco to challenge her. “I think you quite like him, even if he’s terrible with paperwork and all.”
Merlin
I'll let you know how it goes.
He frowned, sitting back a bit in his chair. “Really? That’s… I guess that makes sense.”
“I’ll do my best to bring him home. I’ll write to him later today… Um, could you tell me about Sirius? That
Harry fell from his broom as he reached the hallway. The high shrieking was still coming from the Room of Requirement, and Harry assumed it was the horcrux. Acting on instinct, he kicked the diadem back into the room, and the door closed on its own.
Letter written, he set it on the table. “Be a pet and take that back to him once you’re rested, yes?” He smoothed down the owl’s feathers as he smiled to himself. The owl nibbled at Draco's fingers a bit and blinked one eye, then the other. Curious little bird, Blaise's owl. He'd have to sort out the wine, perhaps a timed, unmanned portkey? He didn't want it to discolor, and he didn't want to tire out the poor bird. Perhaps, if he focused hard enough, he may be able to Banish it to Blaise’s flat? Well. Nothing for it but to try.
"I understand, Harry, but I'd still like to see it all the same."
"Oh yes, that's mostly what I do now. Complex charms, but very satisfying work. I do love seeing young people in love," she mused, smiling at him. "Are you interested in bonding jewelry, Draco?"
Dear one,
“...Well he can’t be worse than Snape. Or practically all our Defense professors.”
“Oh! That’s what they look like when they’re-? Interesting. I’m allergic to strawberries, you know.”
I've not received a letter from Mr. Malfoy. Have you passed along my invitation?
At first, Harry just prattled on about whatever came to mind, trying his best to stick to light, easy topics, not wanting the dragon to sense any tension coming from Harry. He told the dragon about the trip he had taken with Teddy last summer, when they had camped in a clearing a little like this one.
“Yes, ma’am.” She let him go and walked him to the door. Halfway down the wide gravel path, he focused hard on Pansy Parkinson’s lovely little house by the sea in Brighton. A moment and a pop later, he found himself striding up to her front door.
He wandered downstairs to find the bell for his Floo ringing madly. "Request to Floo from Narcissa Black, at Malfoy Manor," the tinny feminine voice announced, when Harry got close enough. "Request granted, Master Potter?"
“Thank you, Sapphire. You’re a gem.”
“No, no, it is all in the past, I suppose.” He sighed and looked at Draco again. “But what are you doing in Paris? Here on a holiday? You
cooking. I like it a lot more than I did when I was little.” She looked up from the letter and made eye contact with him.
“She looks great. When was this taken? How old?”
Merlin
Harry took a deep breath. Easy enough. He just needed to turn in their holiday forms. They both had plenty of time off that was going unused, so much that is was kind of a running joke on the force. He'd filled out a form for each of them, using a spell that duplicated Draco's writing from a test copy. All he needed to do was hand it over to Belinda, and it would all be squared away, and by the time Draco came back, everyone on the squad would be complaining about how long they were away.
"Well! I didn't know you owned any casual clothes!" She held it up for him to see. "It's a good color on you. Shall I wash this, too?
He approached the cot, which was out of immediate sight from the doorway. A simple flourish of his wand removed the cloth that covered Draco's body.
Thanks ever so to our Beta, Ibelieveinahappilyeverafter! ~Kas
She’d gently held his wrist and examined his arm. “I’d prefer to use a gun for yours… might avoid some painful memories for you, what do you think?” He’d rubbed over his arm, glancing up at her.
Draco
She's not the only one worrying. I haven’t said anything about what happened to you that night… But you need to owl me back or I will. It’s been a bloody fucking week.
“It seems easiest. And I think… I think I’d like people to know I’m married as well as bonded.”
"I did, if you'd be willing. I found a pensieve, as well." Well, that was convenient. He supposed that would be best, though, he didn’t know any other ways.
Hogwarts was already at war, the sounds and explosions of duels rang through the grounds. For now, the wards held, but it wouldn't be for long. And then the school would be swarming with Death Eaters.
They were outside, perhaps in the Black Manor gardens. It looked like summer. A little boy dashed into the frame, holding up a frog to Andromeda, who was behind the camera. His huge grin was missing a tooth or two and his dark hair was an absolute mess. His eyes were alight with mischief and joy, and that’s when it clicked for Harry.
In a world without Voldemort, a world with just a normal half blood Tom Riddle, what might his life been life? Naturally, his father would’ve gone to every Quidditch game, with Sirius right beside him. His mum… He had all these different accounts about his dad, and Sirius, and Remus, but there was still so little he knew about his mum, just the fucked-up visions he’d gotten from Snape. He knew that she was wicked smart, very loyal, and didn’t put up with nonsense, but that was about it.
Laughing quietly, Molly nodded. “I did, yes. You can typically find any wizarding jewelry store and they’ll do bonding jewelry as well.” Wizarding jewelry stores… did Diagon have any? He hadn’t paid much attention. “I would recommend Celesti Alley. A wonderful shop up there.”
“Just like my son. He puts off Sunday dinners til the last moment. There’s a lot of… interaction, one might say. He’s better off in small groups or pairs. I wonder if you’re the same way.” Right, then. Draco was officially uncomfortable with these people who seemed to know him like the back of their hand after only having met him once. What was with that? There was no possible way he was so easy to read.
“Oh, hello Harry,” Luna said, when she answered the door. “Ginny is in Moldova, and she won’t be in for tea. Come in, I’ve got a plum tart in the oven.”
"Erm, and what might that be..?"
Have I ever made you a promise that I haven't kept? Of course I'll make good on everything I've said, in our bed or out of it. (Also I quite liked it when you used my full name.)
“...Is that it?” He wasn’t quite sure if he liked this duplicate, yet, or not. Bas laughed and shook his head just a bit.
“I took the liberty of having the house elves pack his belongings, Lucius,” the old man said, folding his hands behind his back. The other man only nodded mutely, staring down at his wife and child. There was nothing he could do for his boy, now. No spell can reawaken the dead.
Draco allowed himself to be pulled away, now faced with another person, definitely a Malfoy, and someone else that looked to be Irish, if he had to put a guess, especially going by the red hair and freckles.
"Do you need my help with anything? Expanding the closet or moving furniture?" Truth be told, he was fine with her moving in. He figured they were both rather lonely, in their huge empty homes.
He could only shake his head. “Is that some muggle term?”
Narcissa smiled at him. “I liked the name. And Geminus Lucius Malfoy doesn’t roll off the tongue so well.” Harry paused for a moment, before he started chuckling. All that mystery, and his mother just liked the name. “Well, that, and as far as I could trace back, there had never been a ‘Draco Black’.” That made sense, then. She wanted him to be unique. That was… Wow. That was interesting. He’d keep that in mind.
were a horcrux. We have a theory… that Voldemort’s soul attached itself to your magical core, which is one of the reasons you were able to speak Parseltongue. When he carved the piece of his soul from you, we believe that it left a vacuum in your core, and your magic slowly began to fill it.” Harry looked like he was having trouble following, and McGonagall sighed. “Simply put, Potter, you might have a reservoir of magic in your core. A ‘core and a half’ worth of magic, if you will.”
I’ve been starving!” That got a chuckle out of everyone, even Draco. Large bowls of seafood pasta, salad, and buttery garlic bread were passed around the table and served family style, not at all what Draco was used to at dinners with his mother.
need a haircut," he mused, running his hands through his hair, making sure it was pixie-free. It came down to about his chin, and could be pulled back with pins or an elastic.
"We are surrounded by our own magic at all times, we become a bit blind to it. Nose-blind, if you will." She smiled at him, dark eyes sparkling. "Go ahead, Potter. Leaf in your mouth at your leisure."
"Well, he's nice. He would've been just as attentive and helpful as I was, would've helped with your wing and everything…" He sighed a little and rubbed the back of his neck. "He puts you guys first, you know? Dragons, I mean. You lot are the loves of his life. Might've broken his heart that you didn't like him." Another huff from the dragon almost sounded like '
Ta, darlings! xx
“Hey… I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you, I just needed to get the tag on you”— He tried to rub the dragon’s belly, to soothe him, but was surprised as the beast seemed to flinch away from his touch.
“Avada kedavra.”
be able to describe, really. But I want to learn more about it. With you. Maybe I can even experiment with the Wolfsbane to make it sweeter. Though I’d have to wonder at the after-effects of that… Remind me to test that out later.
And no, you dare not say. I’ll have you know I was never soft.
Harry frowned and crossed his arms over his chest. “So I can’t dote on the people that I love? I can’t do or buy things that I think will make them happy? Because it will just turn them into brats? What about Teddy, or your baby? I can’t dote on them?”
"You consider a career at Hogwarts. I'd like you to extend the invitation to Mr. Malfoy, as well. Even if you decline, I am open to suggestions for several positions."
And no, you dare not say. I’ll have you know I was never soft.
-most true-to-canon option
Harry's pendant would need a ruby, for sure. Looking around the shop, Draco found the jewelry of rubies. Perfect. Now… Gold would certainly fit him best. Gold for his golden boy. It would look so lovely against Harry's darker skin, and of course Draco would have to touch the metal, to be able to put it on Harry for the ceremony. Staring at the pendant that most caught his eye, he smiled. It wasn’t overly large, or adorned with much, simply a ruby pendant held in a gold setting, on a thin gold chain. It was perfectly tear-drop shaped and perfectly cut, for the maximum amount of sparkle. Draco could imagine kissing the jewel as it hung in the hollow of Harry's throat, or lower down, against his chest. He could imagine mornings in bed, playing with the chain around Harry's neck as he waited for him to wake up.
She seemed surprised at the suggestion before finally smiling. “That sounds like a lovely idea.”
Harry nodded. “Right, right…” Looking over the letter again, he sighed. “I still shouldn’t go try to find him, should I?”
Harry sat up a bit straighter, brow furrowed and jaw set stubbornly. Draco liked to call it his Auror Face. “What does he say? Is he alright? I sent Porthos with a letter around noon…”
“Nice to meet you, Storm. I do have one question.”
Yeah, I get it, I’m technically rich too, but I never grew up rich. Even Hermione doesn’t get it the way that Ron does. I mean, both her parents were dentists. Do you know the kind of money dentists make? Because most wizards don’t.
Derrick gave a loud groan, “
Draco gave the letter one more glance over, tucking it close as he breathed. Just… Sunday dinner with the family he never knew he had. Easy enough. He ascended the steps and knocked on the door, letter carefully tucked away. It only took a moment for the door to open. "Draco, good to see you again. Come in, dear."
Of course I'm over the moon for you, darling. In fact, you're my moon and stars. (And I've always been adorable, ta for finally noticing, yeah?) We can keep this to ourselves (and your mother) as long as you want or need to. I'm yours and I'm not going anywhere. At least nowhere without you.
“Come on, you’ve known my cousin for what, 10 minutes, and you’re talking about our sex life?” He shook his head and frowned. “I’m very sorry about him, boundaries have never been his forte.”
“Mum, everyone is- Oh. Are you… Are you two having a moment, here?” October looked between the two of them, his voice softer and more tender than it usually was.
“Ah. That does sound like Draco… Walls up and on his guard. It’s a good thing you won’t give up on him easily, won’t you?”
P.S. I can't wait to tell you about the rest of my family!
Hermione gasped and Harry’s mouth dropped open. “Ronald!” She smacked his shoulder and glared at him, while Harry still couldn’t quite find the words.
Surprisingly, it didn’t take them long to get there. Though Draco still didn’t think he liked it that much. Off the train and up the stairs they went, emerging into the early spring sunlight. Only a few streets away, they approached a building painted in royal blues and blacks, with a neon sign reading 'Tatouages et piercings' in the window. Ah, so his cousin worked at a tattoo studio. Interesting. Draco’s nose wrinkled. “I see.” Very interesting. At least now they were going to be going back to the wizarding shopping districts.
on his part.” Devin winked at his husband and two spots of pink blush appeared on Gabriels cheeks. Did— was that a sex joke?
But then things got even weirder.
The dragon was clearly in pain, and Harry was incapable of leaving an animal injured when he knew he could help. But based on his earlier reactions, he wasn’t sure the dragon would let him near enough to heal his wounds.
Well, they don’t necessarily have to be pastels, they just have to be coordinated. And really, Harry, I’m not the child I was at Hogwarts. Do you honestly think that my tastes don’t vary beyond the representative colors of Slytherin house? You’re absolutely incorrigible. We can take a look together when I come back home.
“Hm… Could use a bit of work,” she finally assessed. He blushed and led her to what had become her seat. The teapot poured itself, and the sugar bowl scooted towards her cup. “Thank you, Harry. Have you heard from Draco?”
“Oi! Let the boy get a room first, Doonan, before you talk ‘is ear off!” The barwoman said, smacking the man's shoulder with a rag like one would an excited dog. She turned her attention to Harry and raised an eyebrow, appraising him. He unconsciously stood up a little straighter. “Well, I'll eat m'hat if you're a poacher or potioneer, boy, too straight-laced and kind-faced for that.”
Whoo hoo! New chapter when I should be sleeping! Best time to post, imho.
He got up and stretched, groaning as his back and shoulder popped. He threw a bit of Floo powder onto the small fire in his study. "Hogwarts, headmistress' office."
“Right, well, I guess we’re doing this.” Harry had reached the place where a
“Actually, I love chocolate wine the most. Though I do love a nice sparkling wine.”
“I think… that’s probably a good idea.”
The dragon started to shake and writhe where it stood, jaws stretched wide. Harry was about to run forwards, ready to risk his life to save the dragon from whatever pain it was suffering, when suddenly the air around the dragon shimmered, and then the dragon was gone.
Slowly, everyone else left, leaving just Draco and Gwen alone in the house with one another. A few flicks of her wand had the plates stacking themselves and floating towards the sink, which had filled itself with hot water and suds. That taken care of, she turned her attention to Draco. “You had quite a bit of wine tonight, young man. How are you feeling?” He’d practically had two gorgeous bottles of white wine to himself, much to October’s delight.
Where the hell have you gone?
Harry recognized Sirius' writing from the letters he'd sent in fourth year, but he was able to guess pretty quickly that James' writing was the darker, slanted font, as if he'd turned the book in order to see better, so he could also write. Before he realized it, he was crying, and the tears were dripping onto the pages, blurring some of the writing. He quickly set the book down, wiping at his face. He… His dad. And Sirius. Back when they were kids.
But there are two photos of Harry wanking himself off, head tipped back, lips open in a soft but silent pant, hair a wild mess. The final picture shows Harry cumming over his own chest and abs. These are definitely not teasing photos. These mean business.]]
off.”
“Hiya, Nev. What have you got growing here?” He stood next to his friend and put his hands on his hips, looking over the garden.
A moment later the Floo flashed bright green and Narcissa was stepping through… With bags. "Harry, dear, wonderful to see you again. Is it too late for tea?"
Sincerely and Dearly,
“Well, if you insist…” Draco let her lead him in, and immediately his eye caught on gorgeous emerald jewelry near the front. Sapphire hummed and led him over to the emerald display, opening the case with a flick of her wand.
"There were articles written about you, since your war. Your tragic story, your trial— oh we were so pleased when you were acquitted. And then your sparkling Auror career, paired with Harry Potter no less!"
“Alright, fine,” he sighed. He would need to pick up some more his own tone, though, while they were out. He was certain that her makeup wouldn’t match his skin tone. He might be able to steal a lipstick or two, though.
“I think that Draco was frightened, yes. Frightened of what could be, and what it could mean. Don’t you often think it’s much safer to remain comfortable, rather than to risk anything?” And honestly, Harry didn't know… because he
“No! No, I'm not ill. Well, I was last week. Got sick just after breakfast on Tuesday, you'd already gone home and I didn't want to worry you.”
Draco couldn’t help to roll his eyes. “Chosen Git, more like.” That had Derrick chuckling into his wine glass, making eye contact with Draco. “Rushing off into danger, flirting with baristas… not doing all his research. Really, he’s an idiot.”
He knew four things for certain. One, he was dead, and Harry Potter had killed him. He was a ghost. Two, someone had cleared away his things. Three, Albus Dumbledore was also dead. He'd heard that from the portraits. Four, dark things were coming to Hogwarts.
“No, no! I’d like that, very much. If I don’t find him today, I’ll just worry myself sick about him at Grimmauld. Dinner with you would be much more enjoyable.”
“See, a long long time ago, before you or I or even ol’ Winnie were around, this place was special. Lots of magic in the Earth and the trees and the like. Legend has it that a small band of infected wizards migrated from Greece into France, and then from France to right here, during the dark ages. See here boy—it's said they were cursed by the Gods, to become an Ýdra, a sort of dragon, when they reached a certain age—cursed to roam the lands as a terrifying beast. But with their magic, they would learn to control it; they could shift from beast to man at will, if they wished.” Doonan paused, impressively finishing off the rest of his drink.
"Hey wait—how come you let me nap on you and you wouldn’t let Charlie help you? Why did you attack him? It can't just be because you don't like redheads," he said, only partially joking. (Sure, there were certain breeds that were very sensitive to colours, but he had a hunch this dragon wasn't one of them.)
now, this is getting a bit ridiculous.
. Not to mention that Draco had absolutely atoned for his sins with how many cases they'd solved with his quick thinking. Some people just couldn't
"You're many things, ma'am, but an old woman isn't one of them." And even if she was, he wasn't bloody likely to agree with her. "I'll gather them for you, though. I'd like to help."
Darling
That had Harry frowning. "I got a letter from someone claiming to be Draco's great aunt from his dad's side." Narcissa’s features sharpened and she held out her hand, silently demanding to see the letter, which Harry immediately gave her.
Harry
allow it to be a garish travesty upon which I must suffer daily. Maybe when I come back, we can go to the shop and decide together.
“Of course, my love. I’ll bring you lunch and dinner as well. We’ve got to keep your strength up. Stay safe.” She was so kind… He would love to stay here indefinitely. She so reminded him of his mother. Oh his mother… He knew she would be worried. Certainly both her and Harry knew what tonight was. But he didn’t want to put either of them through this. They would insist on  being at his side, which meant they would have to watch, and… He couldn’t do that to them.
Husband and wife made eye contact, having thought of the same thing. The Dark Lord had been using their son as a pawn against them, to keep them complacent and in line. Now, there was almost nothing the Dark Lord could do to hurt them. What more could they lose, with their heir dead? Lucius stood and composed himself as best he could.
"Marvelous! Perhaps we take a little trip to the Loire Valley? Tour the wine caves, get you to try their sparkling wine. A wonderful day trip, I must say." Remy sipped from his glass and Sapphire cleared her throat.
“I’ve been through war, mate. I went up against Volde-No-Nose a bunch of times. Up against Snape, and went on plenty of raids. I’m Deputy Auror. Nothing got me ready for being married with a kid on the way.” Harry couldn’t help but laugh, especially with Ron brandishing a spatula like it was a wand— bits of scrambled egg flying off the end.
Harry relaxed as their plates vanished and Mimsy brought out two lovely platters of chicken cordon bleu. He had survived. They each tucked in and after a minute or so, Harry cracked a smile. “You know, a lot of Aurors don’t have as good interrogation skills as you do. I’m quite impressed.”
Yours,
Malfoy's light grey eyes stared up at the ceiling, terror clutching at his chest as hot tears slid down his sharp cheeks. He was dying. He would die on the floor of this bathroom, not at the hands of the Dark Lord for failing to complete his unwanted mission. But he was still scared, he didn't want to die… He didn't want to die.
Why couldn’t Harry see that he couldn’t come back? He would wait to write his return letter. He just… Oh, his poor mother.
I love you,
“Because it seems we're going to match,” Draco said, red in the face and nervous. Harry paused for a solid 10 seconds before blushing and rubbing the back of his neck.
“In a bad way, or a good way? Should we find a softer pair for you?” He gave a nod.
Harry’s eyes went wide as he took the seat across from her. “Wow— that’s more than just few photos…” It was a proverbial goldmine of information, really. He leaned forward a bit, trying to see.
of the family. “I- I’m sorry, exactly how big is your family?”
Harry laughed a bit at Draco's expression and summoned the little bowl of sugar from the Aurors' tea set in the break room, wandlessly and wordlessly. "There you are, dear. Sugar for the sweetest." He knew Draco would never admit it, but Harry took a certain kind of delight in the pink flush he saw creeping up his neck.
Harry blushed, but didn't mean to. (Blaise was a handsome man, sue him.) "It's fine. Um, you wouldn't happen to have Draco hidden away in there, would you?"
“No, that is not a part of your courting,” she laughed. “But as I said, it’s very lovely.”
Those pictures--
Yours,
Allow me to introduce myself, first. My name is Gwendolyn Roots, though I was originally Gwendolyn Malfoy. Please, feel free to call me Gwen. I’m Draco’s great aunt, from his father’s side. I believe that this picture may prove the family resemblance.
[Enclosed is Harry's shirt, smelling much more like Draco than it ever used to.]
“Sure, star dragon,” Bas said with a wink and a pat on the shoulder. The two siblings chatted while they steered Draco in the right directions, and they ended up at a shoe store not like any Draco had ever seen before.
And the door opened.
” She turned to Draco with a smile. “I was working at the market. He came over to weigh the bag of strawberries he wanted to buy. He stared at me and dropped the bag, and the strawberries went everywhere. He couldn’t even say anything. ‘Sorry. Uh. Sorry. Wow. Uh.’”
“Yeah. I can go for lavender. How’s… You know. Life?” She smiled her sweet serene smile and conjured the cup he always seemed to use when he was over at their flat. She poured the tea and hummed a bit to herself, wiping her hands on her multicolored apron.
SO HERE WE GO!!
“Bisexual? Attracted to both men and women? Well— his own gender and

He headed home, mind already turning back to the topic of the research paper he was currently working on, a dissertation on the social behaviour of fire dwelling salamanders.
We had dinner with wine, and dessert with whiskey, and I was feeling that tension between us more than usual. I was riding a high from the case, and the alcohol, and I thought I was reading the mood right…
She looked at him, eyes bright with righteous fury. “If your schoolboy nemesis noticed all these things, why didn’t Dumbledore?”
"I'll just get him, you can wait outside if you'd like. You don't have to come in, if you're uncomfortable."
A shrill cry left the dragon’s great gaping maw as Harry struggled to hold on and get the collar to expand at the same time. A frantic, wandless
does any of his paperwork on time. He’s probably used to Granger doing it all for him at the last minute.” Of course, they might not know who Granger was, but that wasn’t the point. “He’s terribly unorganized, his half of the office is an absolute wreck. And he’s unprofessional, all the time! Do you know, he goes out of his way to constantly torment me! He calls me these names,
Mine,
“I thought a nice bath might help after the moons… to relax, relieve the tension and aches?”
The room transformed before Draco's very eyes. Vincent and Gregory were lost-- already gone-- and the Room of Lost Things became a simple stone dungeon. Anything that was on fire in the Room of Lost Things came there, complete with the diadem of Ravenclaw. Draco watched as the 5th piece of Voldemort's soul was destroyed.
“Definitely,” she said, agreeing with whatever that meant. “Come on, Dray, we’re gonna go shopping for shoes first.”
“Alright, alright, enough out of the both of you. Mate? Eggs?” He looked to have made half the carton of scrambled eggs, a block of cheddar cheese grating itself liberally over the eggs in the pan.
Yours always,
After a while, it felt like N.E.W.T. studying with Hermione, and he needed to take a break. Harry sat back in his chair and groaned loudly, the simple action already making him feel better. Did he know anyone that was an animagus? Certainly they would be able to help him figure this all… Of course! He was so stupid!
"Neville?" He closed the door behind him and took a few steps towards his friend.
required to track him down and register him yourself. Thankfully, you and the law seem to have a very funny relationship."
“It wasn't a big deal, Draco, and I'm fine. I had Healer Màvros look me over to make sure I was okay.”
Isn’t he supposed to be the Chosen One? That should be plenty exciting!”
Harry looked down at his bowl, then flicked his gaze up to meet Draco's. He blinked a few times, as if not understanding why he was being asked the question. “Um-- it's oatmeal? You've had oatmeal before Draco--”
“I didn't mean what I said, either. About you letting him get branded. I know you didn’t want that for him, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Ah, much better. It's not so much my full name… it's you saying it. I love your voice, and thought it was obvious. How many times did I bait you into going on a rant or ramble in our shared office? I quite like hearing you talk, even if you're angry.
Harry grinned, rubbing the back of his neck. “Like you said, the craziest stuff happens to me. To us. We're gonna be parents.”
You don't have to do this alone, I can help you. We'll find someone to brew wolfsbane potion for you so the full moons aren't as bad. I know that Remus had a hard time, and he had my dad and Sirius
did wine always taste like this? There was a lot
"Yes, ma'am, thank you," he said, standing back up and smiling at her. "I can't wait to get started."
“Well, sometimes it’s got sentimental value, like you’re getting the piece done for someone or to remember something. Sometimes, it’s for the aesthetic, you like the way it looks, or the overall tattoo style. And sometimes… you just do it for the hell of it.” Draco felt as though he'd never understand these people. He clutched at his arm where the scar of the mark still laid. Getting one for someone? He had a feeling she meant of your own will, for someone special, not like what had been done to him. “I’m sure he can explain it much better than I can. If you’re interested, he’ll talk forever about it.” She nudged him, and they both took a seat to wait for Bas to finish.
“Enjoy, my darling,” she said with a grin.
Hermione laughed. “Trust me, Harry. I know the stories.”
Harry,
would develop one, before you even got to Hogwarts.”
On that day, on the first of June 1998, Harry James Potter left the Queen of Wands with a square of muggle plastic wrap surgically taped over his left pectoral, upon which was inked ‘James and Lily’, in his parents own writing.
"First, I have to get him back… and when I do, I'm going to make sure he knows exactly how I feel, so he doesn't have to be afraid of us being together."
Draco gave her a nod as he began to scrub at his face. “Yes, ma’am.”
Harry waited until they were seated in the parlour to explain. “The raid, it was to break up the Crowling family. They’re one of those ‘Revive Voldemort’ cults.” Narcissa winced, as Harry suspected she would. It was more than a sore subject. “It was the full moon and, well… We didn’t know one of them was an unregistered werewolf. If I’d known, we wouldn't’ have gone last night, we would’ve waited for the new moon—”
to report Draco’s turning and bring him in to be registered. If he was deemed dangerous, they could even brand his registration number into his arm with silver, or even put a tracker on him, like he was a dog.
She smiled and showed him the golden ring on her finger with a gem in it. It looked orange, but it looked like it was
“Oh- No, no, we’re not on holiday together. He went, and I thought that maybe a break away from work was a good idea-”
The thought of him taking notes and doodling in the same room that Remus taught almost brought me to tears. He belongs there, just like we do. We'll make it our home as much as Grimmauld is, I promise.
Albus Dumbledore stood in front of his desk, facing the Malfoys as they entered the room. “Narcissa, Lucius, thank you for coming so soon… I’m afraid I am the bearer of… the worst news imaginable.”
“Call me Minerva.”
The twins were momentarily stunned.
“No, of course not.” So… So then…
"Think about it logically. That's exactly what someone like you would expect. You'd be ready. This way? They may stand a chance, if we didn't already know." He did have a point. Harry was really desperate if he was lingering on how Draco's lips molded around his glass..
Harry huffed a bit, because he knew she was right. There were still some idiot people that said Draco was no good, that he couldn't be trusted, even though none of those people had stood up to Voldemort or fought the Death Eaters, or
-the Fab 5 are also no-majs and work their wonders with him
Walking back to the lobby, he bee-lined for the Floo network. He needed to find Draco.
offer him my tailor? He refused, of course, but the gesture was made in good will.
“Isn’t it too early for guests?” Charlie responded from where he lay on the bed. Harry winced at the bandages still covering much of Charlie’s body. Even spending a night with the most skilled healers in the UK hadn’t entirely healed him? This dragon attack must have been much worse than usual.
Professor Draco Malfoy-Potter
I couldn't wait, so here's chapter 2!
Harry thought about it. “I… don’t know what he needs, though. We’ve been sending letters back and forth, and most of his letters amount to ‘fuck off and leave me alone.’”
Then Harry started to talk.
“Of course, Mr. Potter. I’ll see you next week for your lesson. And do mention my offer to Mr. Malfoy as soon as possible.”
"I believe she got my work address, that would've been the easiest for her to find. Charmed Artifacts and Antiquities Department of le Ministère de la magie pour la France," she explained with a smile. "Of course, at the time, I didn't have great-grand-babies, and my husband was still alive. I only do consulting work for them now."
“Well no, er, we weren’t. Aren’t? But I feel like we were moving that way. I mean, I kissed him like a year ago, and he ran off, but… things were looking okay for a while.”
“I- I’m afraid I wouldn’t know where on Earth to go-”
“Hold on a moment,” he asked Narcissa, getting up and untying the letter from the huge owl’s leg giving him a few treats for his hard work. He recognized the small neat scrawl of his last name on the outside and broke the wax seal. “It’s from Draco!”
needed a session of retail therapy.
"Oh, no no. Not Blaise. We're much better off friends. He's got his eye on a pair anyway, though he won't admit. He claims he enjoys the life of a bachelor."
stain to try to get out of cashmere. Though I do expect a return gift, of course.
“Draco?” he said in shock, “What just happened? Are you okay?”
“It runs in the family. That was the first time I’d ever transformed.” Draco said, clearly still uncomfortable talking to Harry about it.
"Absolutely. I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to achieve your Animagus form. However, this process requires immense amounts of concentration, self-reflection, and meditation. And you and I both know, Potter, that you are not the most patient of men."
“And are you? Okay?” Something had to be wrong, if Harry was eating that paper-and-glue mix with berries in. He watched as his husband once again shifted in his seat.
Doonan stroked his beard, humming. “We see a lot of beasts and creatures in Garmsby, fae folk in the forest and nymphs in the river. But dragons—Dragons are something special.” He paused as Winifred sets down two pints of ale and good-naturedly smacked his shoulder. He took a long drink of his ale, prompting Harry to do the same.
Harry,
was a total disaster, and we were incredibly underprepared for when things went wrong… I had no idea it was a full moon…
but he still felt
Derrick shook his head. “Not a bit. Well, not anything I can use to conjure something. I’ve got a great immune system, hardly ever get sick. And the weather, I’m comfortable in all sorts of weather.”
Harry missed him. His mother had brought out the baby pictures. They had both viewed Harry's memory of Lupin's shift. He groaned and covered his face with his hands. They weren't making it easy to stay away, and that wasn't even taking into account the fact that his mother had made up a room at Grimmauld Place for him… which was right next to Harry's. That was absolutely a courting step, and his mother knew it.
When you come back, we'll talk with Robards, the two of us. I'm certain they'll still want you, we have the best case stats in the department, after all. Or you could become an Unspeakable? And still work closely with me? Fuck, we'll figure it out. Just come back to England.
“You have a family house, don’t you? The Blacks have the Ancestral home, the Malfoys have the Manor… What have the Potters got?”
Draco slowly walked over to sit, giving her a nod. “Ma’am.” She tipped her head back and laughed, though he didn’t feel like she was laughing
“Well, see, we kinda weren't going to tell him until after they'd accepted and gotten over here. Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, yeah?”
And Blaise didn't have to tell me. I saw how you flushed and swooned whenever I did wandless magic, especially when it was more than just summoning a book or something. I'm not quite as unobservant as I seem, my love.
“...I did wonder about that,” she admitted, finally getting up and leaning against the counter a few feet behind Harry. “Do you… have many of those days now?”
“Oh.” Right, then. He was on holiday in Paris. New experiences. He followed her down the street, and down the steps under the lovely Art Deco Metropolitan sign. She bought a booklet of 10 tickets for him and handed them over, taking out her own card.
Wait, what? Picking up the tome properly, Harry stared at it. There was… He saw notes sticking out of the books. He… He hadn’t noticed that, before. Looking through the book, his eyes widened when he saw all sorts of notes. Notes from Sirius, and Pettigrew, and… And his dad.
“Darling, it is my pleasure to take care of you. How are you feeling? Should you be out of bed?” She wrapped her arms around him in a gentle hug, not wanting to hurt him if his body was still sore.
The dragon now had an expression of disbelief, and Harry couldn’t help but defend Charlie. “He really is, and I will not let a dragon besmirch his good reputation.”
He called out to Malfoy, something accusatory about the locket and Katie Bell, and quickly dodged a stinging hex as Malfoy went from broken to defensive in the blink of an eye. They duel, hiding behind rows of toilet stalls and sinks, some wordless hexes, some Dark spells. An Unforgivable was on the tip of Malfoy's tongue when Harry let loose a loud cry of “Sectumsempra!” The Prince's book had said ‘only for enemies’, and Draco was, in this moment, Harry's greatest enemy.
“You wouldn’t happen to have Draco over, would you?” Although guessing from the robe, Harry already knew that Pansy was either alone or entertaining someone who definitely wasn’t Draco.
“Oh, enough now, lovely, and call me Winifred.”
“Don’t I know it,” Charlie laughed, wincing after a moment. Still in pain then. “You leaving me already?”
He groaned and put his face in his hands. Things had been going so
He took a few shuddering breaths and wiped his eyes. “I think— it must’ve taken a lot out of him, for him to write this afterwards…” He closed his eyes and offered the letter to her. Narcissa took it and soon had the very same reaction as Harry, slowly sitting herself down.
You’re too thin by half.” He grinned at her sheepishly and adjusted his glasses. Everyone was always trying to feed him, jeez.
He climbed over a pile of half-broken Edwardian furniture, beginning his climb to claim the horcrux. And Draco Malfoy kept the diadem shining for him, wearing it atop his ghostly head like the silver prince he was, though his visage was hidden inside the mannequin head.
would be a good candidate?”
Well… All that was left was to tell everyone else the news of his new love interest. It was very important to tell the Weasleys about his intentions to court Draco… without telling them that he'd been turned. Well, maybe he could tell Bill, at the very least. And maybe Ron. Unless Ron already knew. But it would be the courting bit he had a problem with, knowing him. And he'd probably take more of an issue with the old Pureblood tradition of courting than him going after Draco. Ron knew how well they worked together, and how they had a solid friendship.
Draco closed his eyes, buried his face in the fabric, and took a deep breath in.
“You’re getting a few new little ones, don’t worry… and most of us aren’t very far.” He felt bad… she was probably as lonely as him and Narcissa. Probably even more so.
AND of course the end-game pairing will be Draco and Harry, don't worry folks.
“I’ll see you two later, I have studying to do.” Maybe he’d reread the first couple chapters of
Oh. Oh, he loved it. It had a nice walk-in shower in one corner of the room, toilet on the other side with sink and cabinets nearby, and there, in the middle of the room, was a
“Story of my life.” Harry put aside Charlie’s jokes as he left him with his sorry-looking breakfast.
Draco nodded to her, taking her in, as well as the babe she was trying to keep still in his own seat. “Draco Malfoy.”
"Be that as it may. I will hold you to your word. Weekends at noon, I will give you a private hour." That was more than he was expecting she'd give him, what with her schedule and responsibilities, but he was delighted.
Draco still had to decide on that part.
Not every update will be this quick, but I'm excited about this fic!
“Certainly not,” Draco scoffed, shaking his head slightly. “With my awful luck, I'd be stuck with something like ‘Dead Draco’ for eternity.” Merlin, that would get old fast. His statement drew an even bigger laugh from the Baron, who hadn’t been nearly this friendly with him while he was living.
these days!” He turned the corner and grinned when he saw her, halfway through someone’s new Christmas sweater. She let the magic needles take over and pulled him into a tight hug.
“Great aunt, that’d be…” Harry thought it over, trying to put the pieces together in his head. “His grand-dad’s sister?”
Mr. Potter,
One, he knew that Helena’s mother's diadem was in his Room of Lost Things. It was placed high atop a wardrobe, crowning a mannequin head with a musty wig. It marked the spot of a few treasures-- most notably a ratty old potions book.
I promise I was a good boy for you. The question is: will you be a good boy for your Master? Will you be good for me, baby? I do hope so… I'd hate to put you over my knee as soon as you come home. Unless that's exactly what you're hoping for.
“Oh. That sounds good. No Ginny? When’d she leave?”
“Hm?”
Draco quickly shook his head as Valerie handed the letter off. “I haven’t got anything of the sort.”
the right way. How’s that sound? Would you like that, Harry dear?
it did make sense. If suddenly Draco's feelings were returned, quite a lot would change very suddenly. And Draco had more to lose now with Harry than ever-- a good work relationship and friendship were all up in the air… And now he got it. "Yes, ma'am. I understand now."
Did you tell the headmistress of my condition? She’s willing to accept us both, with the full knowledge of what I am, and the risks she would be taking upon herself for me to teach at the school around the students? If so, I’d love to use the dungeons for my own brewing. They have an atmosphere that not even the darkest Malfoy cellar can hold a candle to, wouldn’t you agree?
“If he doesn’t, then who does? He’s never treated me like some celebrity or hero or any of that.” It had made dating difficult, the very few times he’d tried, most of them before the war. His track record of partners was nearly laughable, and the handful he’d dated after the war had done it for that reason: because he was Harry bloody Potter, and not just Harry.
“Thanks, Charlie. This is really gonna help. You know it’s bad if they’re calling me in.”
Now the dragon’s eyes were really sparkling, and Harry was struck by how beautiful he was. Nature had a way of creating some pretty stunning creatures—he had a soft spot for the bright fire-dwelling salamanders—but there was something otherworldly about this particular dragon.
come to dinner and meet everyone!”
He couldn’t be late for his first lesson with McGonagall, and he still needed another leaf from Neville. He’d have to hurry. “Um, sorry to run off, Narcissa, but I have an appointment with the Headmistress and I can’t be late.” He stood up and grabbed his leather jacket. “I’ll be home for dinner, though.”
She smiled, and squeezed his hand. “Good answer. Now, Mimsy, if you’d bring out dinner?”
Harry
And yes, I do believe that is completely rash, irresponsible, and childish, despite the sweet gesture behind it as well as the implications. Do you realize just how long those things last? As long as you don’t have them removed. What do your Weasleys, think, then? Have they declared you a traitor to the family?
Darling
“You- You know my Auntie Droma?” How on Earth- They were supposed to be Malfoys! How on Earth did they know Andromeda
it mean? All that was coming to mind were thoughts of being Draco’s perfect match, running with him during the moons and caring for him afterwards. A mate was a partner, weren’t they? And that was exactly what Harry wanted to be for Draco. Which meant—
"Hoho! The boy knows his wine!" Remy was obviously very pleased. "Yes, Pinot gris. French this time, too."
Harry thought as he reached for his bag. “Ah, fuck, what was it they said? I ‘barrelled headfirst into danger and the only thing that would come of that would be disaster.’ I think that was what they said. I didn’t
Baby Draco was unhappy to be in his foamy bubbly bath water, sweet little face pink from the warm water and the fit he’d thrown before his bath. Harry couldn’t help but smile. “Not even when he was little?”
such a thing were to happen… Yes, I would hyphenate. And my name would be first. Naturally.
“I will, I promise.” He resisted the urge to call her ‘mum’ to tease her.
“Coq du Vin,” Alistair told him. “Come on, come sit.” Bas ended up taking the seat across from Draco, with Gwendolyn at Draco’s left, at the head of the table, and Derrick at Draco’s right.
“You mean the kissing? Oh, you get used to it, I promise. It startled me, the first hundred times or so, especially when friends of friends would do it when they met you. But it’s… nice. In comparison, English greetings seem a bit… stuffy, don’t they?”
Bloody Merlin, don’t say things like that. You can’t
And he had these horns on his head—bit of a long muzzle, too—wicked sharp claws.” Taking careful note of it all, Harry finally nodded, managing to give Charlie a smile.
Harry didn’t know what to do, had never seen this behaviour before, and was wary of doing anything that might make the dragon even more enraged. An angry dragon was a dangerous dragon after all. Instead, he simply watched, revelling in the chance to observe this unusual behaviour.
Harry shook his head. “No, I figured I’d try here first. And you needed to know. I… I don’t know if Draco would want me to tell Blaise and Pansy. He’d want to do that himself.”
"I can't stop by to see my two best friends in the world?" Right, be cute.
(See the end of the chapter for
When he got down to the kitchen, he bowed his head. “I wanted to thank you. Again. For… everything.” She approached him, wiping her hands on her apron.
“Thanks, Ron.” He took a few deep breaths. “Also, his mum’s moved in to Grimmauld.”
Harry chuckled to himself and nodded. "Of course, dear. Back in a tick." And with that, he swept down the hall to his best friend's new office.
You shouldn’t have to go through it, either. And I know my mother is firm, but I still want to protect her. She certainly doesn’t deserve any of this.
“...right.” Was being friends with her still bad? Should he stop coming around as often as he did? He’d always felt like they’d had a good break up, all things considered, but maybe he was wrong? He put his empty mug down on the coffee table.
“Let them, my love, it’s alright. We can make more.”
“No. No, the only people who know he’s here are me and Ron, um, the Deputy Auror… we were on a raid, and it went wrong. I called for backup and brought him here. Have you alerted his mother, yet? She’s his emergency contact.”
“So proper and formal, my goodness. You don’t have to call me that, my darling. Aunty Gwen is just fine.”
Finally, Draco turned to face Harry.
Narcissa only nodded and cast a wordless levitation charm on the body of her son, the sheet carefully reshrouding Draco both for privacy and his parents’ sake. With another flick of her wand, Narcissa summoned her son’s belongings to them, shrinking the trunks and hiding them away in her robes. She took her husband’s hand and the two of them approached Dumbledore’s fireplace. She kept a tight grip on her husband and son as Lucius took a handful of Floo powder and threw it onto the flames, muttering ‘Chateau Malfoy’ under her breath as they stepped through, leaving Albus Dumbledore alone in his office.
"Hm? Oh- yeah I have." He paused. "Did you still want to see it?"
“No, trust me, the rest of the family would definitely agree,” Valerie laughed. “I see your eyes though, eat, before it gets too cold. You’re practically drooling.”
Forgive me for the comparison, you're nothing like him. And I doubt I'm very much like mine. But enough talk of people with big shadows, hm?
“She liked to write the dates on all her pictures.” Narcissa turned the picture around and pointed. “There we are. ‘1967, summer.’”
Sincerely and Dearly,
“Thank you, Poppy… and please, keep this to yourself for the time being,” Albus said quietly, dismissing the distraught medi-witch. She descended the spiraling stone staircase and Minerva turned to face the Headmaster.
That had Neville’s eyes widening. “Oh. Oh, jeez, I knew you two… I- Alright, then.” Harry grinned sheepishly and tucked his hands into his pockets.
“Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, bringing him into a hug, though she was a few inches shorter than him. “You’ll be alright. I know you’re scared and worried, but you’re going to be fine.” Her fingers ran through his hair as she held him close.
it. Wow, alright—”
“Is there… more wine?” Miranda chuckled and popped the second bottle of that gorgeous sweet-bitter white wine.
“Scuse me?” Hermione shook her head and produced a handful of MACUSA document copies for the redheads to peruse. Ilvermorny graduation confirmations… hair potion patents… a St. Augustinia’s mind healer license… a Hogwarts graduation certificate.
It’s nice to know that you did it. Believe it or not, that does make me feel better. Like… When I go back, I won’t be alone, even on the moons. I do appreciate the pictures, as well, don’t worry. Especially that second picture. I’ll put it to good use, no worries about that.
“I need to get a Mandrake leaf to start out, so I was thinking I’d go visit Professor McGonagall tomorrow, maybe get a leaf from Neville.”
Draco
“Lunch, please!” He grabbed two handfuls of Gwen’s skirt and held on tight, looking up at her with a smile and bright eyes.
The 5th anniversary of QoW was fast approaching and Harry and Draco had sat in on each others’ tattoo appointments more often than not since Draco's dragon. Draco had been there for Harry's twinkling sirius star, as well as the phase-shifting moon. Harry had sat in on Draco's constellation on his other shoulder, as well as the runes across his ribs.
It got pretty-- erm, steamy. I got so hot and bothered my bloody glasses fogged up at the thought of my mouth on your cock, or yours on my hole. I have to wonder, because ever since I've been able to achieve the Animagus shift, I've been more randy than a, well, a dog. Maybe my wolf needs its mate, hm?
Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts
What Harry didn't see was the damage his spell had done. Large cuts had appeared on Malfoy's chest and torso, like he’d been flayed open with a sword, and he was bleeding. He lay on the flooding floor of the toilets, choking as he began to bleed out. His shirt became a frightening ruby red, and his blood tainted the water around him.
Ron frowned, just before taking a bite of sausage. “Court him? Like all the old traditions, getting specific gifts and being all stiff and proper court him?”
Yours eternally,
“Why couldn't I  have just bloody died?” he asked the room and, by proxy, Myrtle herself. “Couldn't get any peace in death either?”
“If this is a holiday for you, then indulge just a bit.” She put a hand on her hip and fixed him with a look. “Come along, Mr. Auror, let your auntie give you sweets for breakfast.” A gorgeous tower of crêpes floated over, one at a time, and layered themselves on Draco’s plate. “I have a terrible sweet tooth, myself… are you the same?”
Harry let out a little sigh of relief and shrugged a bit. “I’m not sure yet… He’s got good taste, and I want him to like it, so I’m asking around… for inspiration, I guess.”
got a hero complex,” Harry griped. “He does realize that I’ve seen the shift before, doesn’t he?”
"He's just finishing one up back there, go on ahead. This one was a fainter." Oh… Draco had nearly passed out while taking the Mark… He wasn’t sure why someone would do that to themselves, especially voluntarily and for the art. Valerie tapped his shoulder and broke the trance.
"Oh. I like to experiment with potions in my free time, or read up on magical theory. My friends since childhood are Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. You've heard of Starling Zabini? Her son."
“That sounds nice,” he said, relaxing into the touch. It was… nice. Warm. Not shocking like the cheek kisses. He quite liked that.
“As time passed, the curse began to fade. Not every child was a son, and not every son was cursed. They say the Ýdr’yiós have died out, too much inbreeding and blood dilution, but I say different. I think they've just gotten good at taking other forms!”
“Yeah, but Bas does magical tattoos as well. He’s one of the only ones in Paris that does both, you know.” She was obviously very proud of him. “And it’s very close to the Opéra station, so I just use that. Here we are.” Draco hadn’t even realized they’d come to the edge of the wizarding neighborhood.
Option Number 3:
We had a lot of fun writing this! For a majority of the exchange, neither of us knew who the other was, but we still were able to write this amazing fic, and now we get to share it with everyone else! We hope you guys enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it. ~Kas
“Why are you laughing like that?”
"Me neither. And yet," she gestured to Gwen, who was still holding the sleeping Felix. "Voilà. You can join me, Bas, Val, and Gisele in the singles club. We're thinking of getting jackets made."
, dating is good but--" He cut himself off. "It's clear I'm not going to get that. So I just want him home and safe."
"What've you got, then? Something from home?" Valerie's voice cut through Draco's daydream of Harry's voice, and the fantasy came to an abrupt end as she stole the letter right from his hands.
“I suppose I’d have to think about it. When Draco makes a decision, we’ll have a more serious conversation about it. But I’d like to be around him quite often, and if I’m at Hogwarts and he isn’t… I probably wouldn’t see him as often as I’d like.”
That is a nice room for mother, though I’m surprised to be frank that she’s put me in a separate room. Not that I would want to impose, or assume, I had just —  Well, it’s most likely for the best. That bath does sound absolutely luxurious. Though I don’t expect I’ll be back soon. Harry — I would hate for my mother to have to watch, month after month. Going through it is awful enough, I can’t imagine what it must look like, what it must
