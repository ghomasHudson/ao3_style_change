Anthony frowned. “I thought she’d gone for Ancient Runes.” He said. “She was banging on about it at breakfast this morning, how she wasn’t sure she’d done enough preparatory reading.”
“Excuse me. Your conversation is a little embarrassing. Because we can understand it, actually.
“Well he was harassing Draco.” He snarled, admitting it.
Then, little by little, things started going wrong – at least they did for Hal.
Ron actually burst out laughing; Percy glared in their general direction, and they both cracked up again. Later, Hal went to bed a little less worried about how his school year would turn out without Ley by his side.
“It isn’t something I’m saying because I’m looking for congratulations or commiseration.” She added. “It’s just who I am. And I’m telling you because…” She took another deep breath, as if that was somehow just as hard to say. “You’re my friends.”
Hal felt ill. He had never known the details of his parents’ death, only that it had been untimely – he’d always just told himself it had been ‘an accident’, which meant everything and nothing. But they had been
“I know, love, you told us that. And I for one think it is very reasonable.”
“Mate, how did you get that?”
The room was spotless – the elves would keep it so – but it was musty from disuse. Draco had been in awe, almost afraid of the room for several years, but he cast a look on it now and realised it didn’t feel so sacred anymore. The shadow of his father was mostly gone, and it no longer felt like he’d anger anyone or be disrespectful if he, say, opened a window.
He lifted his hand to brush Hal’s hair out of his face, and Hal batted it away as a reflex.
“He’s obsessed with Muggle tech.” Ron told him when Hal could get away without being rude. “Sometimes it’s fun – like he’d got this old car and we’re trying to make it fly!” His excited beaming died down. “But mostly it’s just annoying.”
Lockhart is exhausting to write.
He decided he wasn’t going to accuse the teacher of stopping him before, but he wasn’t going to let him stop him this time again. Even if it turned into a Dementor, he wouldn’t faint this time – he’d face it. He had to prove to himself that he could face it.
“Good luck with Hermione.” He glanced back. “Her face when you split was not a happy face.”
“Sounds like a good compromise.” Hal agreed.
“Crap.” Hal breathed.
“I don’t want to go to the shops.” He blurted out.
“Unbelievable.”
“Yeah.” Neville shrugged. “I guess he just wanted to make sure a student hadn’t died on his watch. He didn’t say much, he was here like two minutes, but I heard the Mediwitches talk about how he cast a spell that meant I didn’t bleed out on the spot.”
“Not all Slytherins are evil.” Hal said more gently.
It had been a long day, with a higher emotional toll than he had anticipated. He decided not to mention to his cousin how he felt about meeting people who knew him, had known his parents. Not that he had figured out yet how he did feel about it.
“He sleeps in his bed!” Hal cried out, not processing anything else right now.
“Put your things away, Potter, you are a danger to yourself and others.” The man ordered.
His good mood hadn’t abated, and he’d not
?” Ley asked with glee, holding out a handful of thick gold coins out of the standard-issue thin leather pouch Hal had been given at the bank. He hadn’t had the heart to ask Petunia to go into another shop, after the wand and the books and the cauldron and the robes, to look for a nicer one. “Is that real money?”
His mother shook her head quietly, in the end, looking disappointed.
and had left him terrified and looking for synonyms for years after that – until Luna spoke out of the blue.
This time, it was his godfather who looked back at him, finally, instead of the angry Potions master.

. They were – according to their friend Lee – the biggest pranksters the school had ever seen. To that the twins were emphatically modest, made shady references to someone called the Marauders, and cracked more jokes than Hal would have thought possible in a single minute. Ley would have loved them. Ron, Hal could tell, what trying his very best to pretend to be exasperated. He could actually understand how the boy felt, he’d seen it happen in friends who felt excluded by his and Ley’s closeness, their inside jokes. It couldn’t have been easy to be the sixth brother in the family
Soft, but still enough to startle Hal – he was sure there had been nobody else in the room, there was no hiding place in there apart from the pillars several feet away. On the other hand, the high-ceilinged space echoed like mad, and he’d heard no footsteps.
The realisation that had filled Hal in the waiting room earlier only seemed to his aunt as she tucked him into bed and started saying they’d see Ley tomorrow.
McGonagall’s mouth opened in shock, but Hal ploughed on before she could comment.
“Alright, but… did she just slip you her number?” Neville pushed.
He wasn’t sleeping well, he couldn’t remember where he’d been sometimes, like he’d fallen asleep during the day or something. It wasn’t like him, but so much had been changing and happening lately, he didn’t know what to attribute it to.
“Glad you’re okay.” He said quickly, already detaching from them to carry on down the opposite direction they were going. “See you around, Harry.”
“You don’t know that.” Draco argued.
. It became simply ridiculous. Twenty minutes after he’d left the infirmary with Draco, they had been accosted by at least a dozen people, all of which had offered admiration and congratulations, three of which had asked for his autograph, and, quite memorably, one of which (a second-year Hufflepuff) had asked him to marry her. He’d politely declined while Draco choked trying not to laugh too openly.
“Draco.” Hal simply said as he let himself fall back onto his pillow, closing his eyes under his aunt’s hand, looking exhausted.
“Well, not really.” Anthony conceded. “He saw me about to open my gob about it and he said
Hal couldn’t exactly say what happened next, he only knew that he saw Draco’s pale face go even paler than normal, he heard Anthony scream, and he thought
“I suppose it is not impossible.” Dumbledore answered. “The founders lived a long time ago, and their descendants could be many. But as you can see for yourself, the lineages have been lost along the centuries, and no witch or wizard nowadays can confidently claim to the illustrious inheritance of any of them. We would know about it.” He added with a chuckle.
“Look.” Draco added. “A broomstick.”
“Oh.” Draco winced. Way to put his foot in it. “I’m sorry.” It didn’t feel appropriate mentioning his father, so he didn’t. “Are you here on your own?”
“And if they don’t?” Pan scoffed, clearly expecting that was the most likely outcome.
Ron, Hermione and Neville were waiting for him outside the door, bless them.
Ron snorted. “You
My CoS rewrite is under way, but it might be a little while before I start posting, as I am a little reluctant to start sharing when it's still a WIP. I don't plan on leaving it unfinished, though!
“Lockhart says a lot of shit.” Hal retorted – having personally been the subject of some of that shit, he tended to dismiss anything that came out of the man’s mouth even more promptly than before.
!” He cast.
“Oh, shush.” Her mother rolled her eyes at her, but Dora could tell she totally agreed.
“No, professor. I apologise.”
“For Merlin’s sake.” Pan muttered.
Draco was startled into a laugh, rolled his eyes, and followed him, resolving to write to his mother. He hoped telling her about his amazing friends would make her feel better seeing he was as happy as he could be.
you had turned eleven. It had felt odd to see her turn twelve when he was only just eleven, but she wasn’t the only one.
“Yeah, it’s Saturday.” Anthony said, looking a little dazed. When Pan just frowned, he pointed to his head, where Pan just then spotted the kippah. His father was wearing a similar one. “Synagogue.” Anthony specified.
Nonetheless, he honestly didn’t feel he was being completely reckless. Well, he was being mostly reckless, but there were a few things that made him confident he wasn’t just walking to his certain death. It wasn’t that he was underestimating Quirrell, even though he didn’t seem very threatening, but Hal had an inkling the helpless stuttering professor act was, well, an act. But he had brought this to Dumbledore, and while he didn’t trust the man as far as he could throw him, he was still in charge of hundreds of children, and one of the greatest wizards alive, and Hal thought maybe, somehow, he was keeping an eye on him. He certainly had shown an interest.
“No?” Hal attempted to lie in a small voice, but the matron’s piercing look made him babble on. “I mean, it hurt a few times before. Since I’ve been here, mostly, never really back home. Hum. In Defence class, mostly. I think. In the Great Hall a few times. I don’t know.”
Draco just wanted to
“They were parasites.” She asserted. “And that is what you are too. Leeching on your aunt’s generosity. Taking what belongs to your cousin.”
“He’s my mother’s cousin.” He informed him. “Sirius Black. Actually, I mentioned him before, he’s the one who got burnt off the tapestry for being a Gryffindor. He was best friends with James, I think he actually spent the summers at the Potters since his own parents didn’t want anything to do with him anymore.”
Hal felt immensely relieved for the distraction, as they enjoyed the ice cream Dobby brought (twice as they went for seconds, and Hal was proud of himself when he didn’t jump the last time he
“You should be able to be whatever you want.”
On top of everything, with Quidditch practice kicking in and the arrangement of their classes this year, Hal barely got a chance to spend time with Anthony and Draco, and he missed his friends and the easy dynamics they’d had the previous year. Those dynamics had changed a bit anyway with the addition of Pansy, though Hal didn’t mind her. She was mean, but quite funny a lot of the time, and Hal thought she was using insults to cover up some serious insecurities, so he was willing to let her protect herself that way until she felt more confident and trustful around them.
“I don’t know what that means.” Anthony pointed at Ron. “But he’s right.”
I’ve made it so they start studying the Boggart in October – it might be in September in the books, can’t remember, but that chapter was getting too long ;) (honestly we’re almost halfway through the word-count of the first two books and we’ve only done three months!)
a boy.”
“But…” Draco started, and stopped himself when hearing how small and childish his voice sounded.
Most of them looked startled by the sudden question, and Draco dropped his cup of hot chocolate, which smashed into the plate underneath it and splashed the brown liquid everywhere. He looked too shocked to clear it up, so Hal did it for him without really a second thought.
“Hagrid… what was Aragog?”
Hal, realising she was talking to him, actually edged closer to Sirius. Instinctively, Sirius went to put a hand on his shoulder – and the woman went berserk.
looking like that, too. They knew the man, here. Not so much for any familiarity, and maybe it wasn’t that kind of establishment anyway, but it was definitely not the first time they’d seen him.
So he took a deep breath, raised his chin, squared his shoulders, and spoke to the door.
“Could we learn how to do that spell?” Hermione suggested.
Ley made a face. His father’s sister, Aunt Marge, didn’t visit very often, but neither of the boys liked it when she did – Hal even less than Ley, as at least the woman doted on her actual nephew. She had nothing but scorn and slurs to offer Hal.
“No, I can’t, not casually if it’s to ask for his opinions as a Potion Master about how to go about a sex change.”
“I’m sorry.” He squeaked.
“It’s because you have the same eyes.” Hal had told him.
“I can compromise by holding Mister Hagrid in the cells within the Ministry. We shall see if there are any further attacks – which I dearly hope there won’t be – before deciding on our next course of action. But Albus, you should know…”
-	Obviously, the minor character deaths are Vernon and Lucius, and they have already happened before the story really starts.
“Go away.” Nils tried again.
It had only been three days, he didn’t see the point of acting tough and proud. He’d almost been poisoned to death by a mythical serpent and Obliviated by a teacher. He was allowed a bit of downtime.
“Yeah, right.” Blaise scoffed. “You’re just jealous because Draco beat you to the clever move that was befriending him.”
“That thing is yours?” Hal asked, clearly shocked. He pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing up his glasses. “Again, in a
“Marge, it’s so nice to see you. Come on in – the boys are out back.”
At any rate, Flint did not make any kind of attempts towards any of them, so that was something. But it didn’t make it particularly easier when other students with no personal history with him glared at him, or gave him a wide berth in the corridors.
“Yes, mom.” Hal teased.
“He knows?” Daphne realised. “What is it? If he knows, you have to tell me.” She demanded.
“You think I’d hang out with all of you misfits if I didn’t care?”
Just outside the common room, however, he almost ran into Luna Lovegood, who seemed to have just started reading the riddle that would, if answered right, grant her access. Her lower face was covered in blood, clearly from a nosebleed that had been carelessly smudged across her cheeks.
More cheers sounded around them, and a shout of
“Mate, you can’t go around wearing Slytherin colours.” Anthony insisted.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Anthony interrupted him. “You can stay here.”
Pan had a shaky laugh, but when he looked up to Mr Goldstein, it was with the full confidence of his education.
go after what the dog is guarding!” Hermione tried to reason.
“Hi!” Hal welcomed him happily, before freezing in his tracks. “What happened to your face?”
The atmosphere in the school was that of exhilaration. The happiness of those closest to the victims, from getting their friends back, was nothing if not catching, and the entire school celebrated. It might also have had something to do with the fact all remaining exams were cancelled for everyone but OWL and NEWT years, which had caused a great generalised uproar of joy. Even Hermione had been willing to admit she was relieved, though in her case it was because she thought she hadn’t studied enough, losing the time she’d been petrified, and couldn’t possibly offer her best performance.
They all shared stories of their Christmases, showed some of their presents – Hal had gotten a mobile phone from his aunt. She’d said she’d considered a camera like he’d mentioned, but thought this would be more useful. Ley, true to himself, had gotten him a fart spray, and less true to himself but actually quite thoughtfully, a sketchpad and some good pencils, which Hal had already put to good use. He rather loved drawing, actually.
better equipped for the purpose. “Why are you stressing about first year exams? Nobody stresses about first year exams. If you were
“Sleekeazy was invented by your father’s father.” Draco informed him. “It’s really popular. Made him a fortune, and he had only one child, who had only one child, so… That’s a lot of your money, right there.”
“I think he likes me.” Hal replied calmly. “I’ll be alright.”
“Harry.” Came another whisper – Hermione’s this time. “Does your scar hurt?”
Pan jabbed her elbow into his hand resting on the table.
“Some of my classmates are afraid of you.” She added. “But that’s silly.” She looked at him for a moment longer, her head tilted to the side, and pushed on. “Are snakes friendly?”
“Do you have nothing better to do?” Pan challenged, schooling his features to make sure he didn’t look as pleased as he felt.
“Yeah.” Rolf frowned. “I mean, I don’t see what else. They don’t have specific magical abilities or properties otherwise, as far as I know. What’s going on?”
But that thing didn’t have hands, let alone a wand, and in the meantime, Quirrell’s back was turned, so it took something out of the whole threatening situation, and Hal couldn’t quite think straight as his mind was reeling to grasp the surreal turn of events that was somehow reality.
“Who doesn’t want their dad’s old blazer, cane and Head Boy badge.” Hal teased.
“What’s your favourite place?” Hal challenged him, clearly giving up on the rest of the tour.
“You alright mate?”
He wasn’t in Slytherin. That was all he could think, though it wasn’t sinking in. His entire short- and medium-term expectations were getting completely reshuffled, and he could hardly wrap his head around it. Oh Merlin, he was his family’s new Sirius. Had his father still been alive, he would have
“I didn’t throw my shoe.” Hal rolled his eyes. “I fell down the stairs.”
“How was your day?”
“This will.” A voice behind them said.
“Harry Potter.” The flat face spoke in that same hissing voice that has sounded before, and ew, gross, gross, gross, was all Hal could think, because it truly was even worse when that thing moved.
“If you
It wasn’t entirely accurate of course, as only Draco had understood them, but it was enough to make both girls flush, look utterly mortified, and even get up and leave with muttered apologies. They were barely out of earshot when Ley laughed loudly.
Hal didn’t seem to notice, or at least he didn’t find it odd.
“Won th’egg at a game o’ cards.” Hagrid confessed into his beard.
It made sense; apart from shopping in Diagon Alley, they probably hadn’t had a chance to visit many magical places before. Draco had never been to Hogsmead itself, but he could imagine it based on trips with his mother to other towns and villages that were a hundred percent Wizard (Narcissa had opened up recently, but she was still a Pureblood, and she had standards regarding her leisure and shopping environment, and what she exposed her son to, at least when Draco was growing up).
“As soon as I can.” Sirius promised.
“It is a little outrageous.” Ron still mumbled.
“Not exactly.” Hal grimaced, looking extremely uncomfortable. “Do we have to talk about this?”
“Thanks.” Hal snorted.
But Hagrid simply looked sad, and grave, and he put the kettle back down, and let himself drop onto his seat – which somehow miraculously did not break under his weight.
Ley shrugged, genuinely not bothered, easygoing as he always was. He was only curious – and that prompted him to carry on questioning.
But it achieved the intended effect, which was to make everyone laugh. When Pan spoke again, however, it was with dead seriousness.
“Not a social call, I’m afraid.” He replied in the same overly polite fashion. They had both been raised with the same manners after all, and some of those were hard to shake.
In the meantime, hope you enjoy this one!
“I thought maybe you would want to look at it privately. I’ll go grab a shower and get dressed, and we’ll make waffles when I’m back, okay?”
“Totally, mate.” Ron was suddenly there, dropping almost on top of Hal in an attempt to squeeze onto the small sofa. “I don’t know what we’re talking about, but you’re totally not alone.”
That sounded a lot more like a curse. So the real question here seemed to be: was someone trying to sabotage, injure or even kill him?
“Worry not, Harry!” Lockhart told him as he threw a handful of Floo powder in the flames. “Your first class is with me.”
“Hey, at least you’re famous for a good reason.” Draco reminded him.
Ashamed, was the honest answer. Weak. But Draco forced himself to smile back. “I’m okay.”
“Oh, pleaaase!” Ley backed him up. “That will work, won’t it?”
.” Pan threw her hands up in the air.
“Eitan.” Ron repeated, as if trying to get used to it.
“You’re not.” Hermione assured kindly. “But that’s not what I meant – I meant the fact they became Animagi. That is really difficult magic, and it takes a lot of dedication.”
“Oh.” Petunia laughed. “No, mine are over there.”
The look Lupin gave him was a little bit like he’d just opened a treasure chest full of gold – wonderment and disbelief.
. I’m okay.”
Out of sight, presumably casually peering from the kitchen to check nothing (and no-one) was on fire, Mrs Weasley held back her son.
He took a breath.
“Very well. I will meet you back at the club at five.”
“I really didn’t do much.” He said eventually.
“Yeah, I guess you turned out alright.” Hal teased.
Draco had had a lovely time, his words, with his mother, going around the Manor and spelling each room a different winter decoration style, while the house elves left treats and little gifts everywhere for them to discover. It had been days of magical winter wonderland, and finally a time to reconnect, without the pressures of social events – not this year, Narcissa had decided, and she’d even declined the invitation to the Christmas ball, held at the Goyles – and without the stress Draco had been under these past few months. He’d left the diary in his dorm room at Hogwarts, and he’d felt so much better for it, granting some credibility to his friends’ assessment that Tom’s confidence hadn’t been all that good for him.
He knew if he mollycoddled him, he would get no answer. Hal was stubborn that way.
” Several voices cried.
“Harry!”
He’d met Harry Potter. It was probably the most exciting thing that had happened to him in a long time, but he somehow did not want to share that with his mother. Not just yet. He wanted to process it on his own first, revel in the possibility that maybe, if he didn’t mess up, he could be friends with the boy who ended the war. It felt like redemption.
Severus had an almost non-existent facial reaction that was his version of an eye roll.
“No sudden movements.” Anthony breathed.
It seemed to be a given Hal would be going forward.
He felt the sudden urgent need to find Hermione and apologise, or give her a hug, or just check she was okay.
Hal walked on, wondering with a small amount of dread what the professor could possibly want with him. Quirrell hadn’t been threatening, or anything, he’d pretty much ignored him actually, and Hal had come to think maybe Hermione was right and he was being a little paranoid in the idea that the man may have some kind of vendetta against him or his family name. But he still wasn’t comfortable at the idea of being alone with him in a small office. Maybe he should have brought back up. Was it too late to turn back and ask one of his friends to come with?
“Ant, that’s a long time. I can’t ask that of your parents.”
That was… a dreadful suggestion, but one that didn’t actually make zero amount of sense. It certainly was more likely than the idea that Hal had some sort of super-power and had single-handedly defeated the man by like, staring at him or something, at one year old.
“No.” Hal agreed. “Weird.”
Anthony had a serious look on his face. “You promise?” He asked rather solemnly.
“I don’t think my nickname is what we need to focus on right now.” He pointed out. “Hagrid.” He said firmly, looking straight at the man. “We won’t tell on you or anything, but you can’t keep a dragon in your hut. Think about it. Even as little as he is now, he almost burned your house down. He will need more and more space. He will grow
Draco laughed.
“Draco, yes.” Hal confirmed.
“Mate, are you alright?” Ron asked.
*             *
“Errr…” Hagrid repeated, and it was as good as a confession. “Let’s go back inside.”
manage it, however.” Snape continued. “You’d do well to remember it when you are older, and out in the world. In a real duel with real stakes, it might just save your life, because even if some good wizards are skilled enough to perform wandless magic, the truth of the matter is that a lot of them are pretty useless without their wand.”
“Fred and George Weasley are how I made the team.” He replied.
. He did not fancy living through anything like that again.
“Did this ever happen before?”
That seemed contradictory to Hal, but then this was a magical household – Hal didn’t know any summoning spells, but maybe Draco had ways to-
Hal also seemed more freely fascinated with magic when they were outdoors. He loved practicing spells, having the space to do so, and though he had originally started learning a few basic things to ‘catch himself up’, he’d said, compared to Wizard-born children who would naturally acquire them at home, he’d just carried on, and Draco suspected he now knew about as much, if not more, as a third-year would.
Draco gave him a look.
“No, I’m sorry.” He said, forcing some patience into his voice. “Do you need something? I need to get to class.”
Which was not good. He figured now was the time to run. With a bit of luck, the potion would still be in effect for him to walk back through the flames, if not maybe
She sighed. The words ‘You’re a wizard, Harry’ sounded incredibly silly.
“I plan to try out for the team. As Seeker.” Draco specified. “So we might end up fighting one another for the cup.”
Draco was breathless from impatience as he stood at the bottom of the stairs from the garden (a swooping flight of wide white marble steps leading up to the Manor’s main doors, a little ostentatious if you asked him, but he kind of loved them all the same) waiting for the Portkey to pull Hal, his cousin and his aunt from thin air. His mother was standing a few feet behind, by the door, watching him with some amusement, but also seemingly looking forward to their guests’ arrival. Draco knew she’d exchanged a few letters with Hal’s aunt, not just to organise their trip but also just to chat, and he was glad his mother could talk to her new friend freely. He wondered if they talked about them – he was sure they did, after all they were all they’d had in common as a starting point, but he’d decided not to dwell on the idea.
“You should get a boyfriend.” He mused.
“He’s so cute!”
“Eh, les jeunes. Tout va bien?” Someone called at them from a distance.
“Bit of a fight in you, innit?” He sneered. “I did think you looked all grown up after the summer.”
There was silence for a moment, before Vince and Greg laughed, Theo vaguely snorted, and Daphne let out a little squeal.
You’d better, having had seven kids, Hal thought.
It took a few seconds for Draco to put two and two together. A boy his age with dead parents and raised by Muggles. Enough of a well-known wizarding family that people would know his name. Hair that looked like a couple of small birds could comfortably nest in there. Very, very green eyes.
“Why do you not like Harry?”
“What?” Hal spat out his pumpkin juice – it was gross, really.
There was a long pause, and Draco saw on her face the exact moment Pansy understood what he meant.
“Water on the floor.” Hal remembered.
“It could have been a ghost.” Neville suggested. “Every now and again, apparently, a poltergeist gets in. Well, Peeves lets them in. I heard Professor Sprout talking about it, apparently they had to call an exorcist a few years back.”
“Okay.” Hal nodded. “So, we make our way quickly to the dorm, grab the map, use to see where the nearest teacher is, go give it to them, take cover wherever makes more sense. We’ll come back here if possible, but don’t worry if we don’t, we’ll stay away if it’s safer.”
“He’s dead.”
I don’t have many headcannons for what my characters look like, except:
“Well, go on then.” Daphne prompted again when Pan said nothing else.
“Why?” Draco suddenly had a vision of Flint and his mates, and gasped at the idea that Hal could have been in the same situation – though he was sure Hal would have handled it better, he’d actually shown that. He still had to ask. “Did he… bully you?”
Love you all, hope you've enjoyed the ride!
So he made it his strategy to approach the Slytherins first years every now and again in the following couple of days. His friends found it odd, but it would look less suspicious this way than if he simply started following Pansy and the others around during the holiday. He just shrugged it off and argued he’d known them for years, and there was no reason he shouldn’t stay friendly.
But as he said it, he reconsidered it for a minute. It
“You do need a new name, mate.” Anthony agreed.
Distracted by the pain, he missed the first jerk of his broomstick. With the second, he thought he’d momentarily lost control while he was clutching at his head. The third one, however, was unmistakable, like someone had grabbed the tip of Hal’s broom and shaken it. As Hal was sharply pulled in one direction and then the opposite, he knew clearly it was nothing he was doing.
“I was never mad at you.” Ron said. “But no, I’m not mad at them either. I get it. It’s a brother thing.”
heard that witches and wizards with a stronger magical core tended to be healthier and heal faster, or that traumatic experiences could on the other hand damage someone’s ability to cast certain spells. So it wasn’t that much of a stretch that magic in a child would develop alongside their body, feeding the energies back and forth and thriving alongside one another.
“This is just as intolerant as anyone looking down on me for
“Please, call me Hal.” He told him without really thinking, with a hint of desperation. Suddenly he couldn’t bear the name Harry. “Please.”
“Come on.” Anthony encouraged them to pile into the compartment. “It’s this or stand in the corridor.”
“I c-came across this, and I thought it m-m-might interest you.” He explained.
“Oh. Well, not right now.” When Pansy frowned at him, he added. “His cousin is in hospital, he won’t be on the train. But he’ll join later.”
One of the newly-sorted Gryffindors was Thomas Lowe, the kid Hal had met with his family in Windermere the previous spring, and after saying hello to him (very much like an over-enthusiastic puppy) he immediately latched on to Colin Creevey, who seemed quite happy to take on the role of big brother at Hogwarts a year early – his own brother would be starting the following year.
Hal held back any reaction as he forced himself to keep his face neutral.
“That’s not what I meant.” Hermione sighed, before she frowned. “Wait, why couldn’t you sleep?”
“Let’s just have lunch.” Petunia sighed.
do worse to him than punch him in the face (and he would, too, if he threatened or approached Draco in any way again) or because he thought there was a chance Hal was either the Heir or some dark and powerful wizard regardless of that particular legend – while the whole ‘attacking students’ accusation was more or less fading, Hal had not shaken the fact that he
“Draco. When you said you liked
“Oh.” Hal startled – both at the statement, and at the fact it was so rare to hear someone say the name, he’d started thinking of it as taboo himself.
“Draco, it’s not…”
She walked away, only to be replaced almost immediately by Dumbledore, who had probably been politely waiting for her to be done.
“What about that dog?” Hal carried on. “I mean, what the hell?”
“I’m… I’m not uninterested.” He fumbled. “By boys. That thing I told you about…”
“I never hoped he wouldn’t be a twat to the end.” Hal commented. “He’s too full of himself to even realise what’s good for him.”
He put his head back in his arms, though he looked up again when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Lupin was leaning over him, looking kind, but serious.
“Honestly, beats a rat.” Blaise said drily. “Even if yours hadn’t turned out to actually be a man.”
“Pan.” Neville, surprisingly, intervened. “I think if you’re going to hang out with us, you’re going to have to get over the fact that Harry’s famous. It’s not by choice, and he doesn’t like it, alright?”
“Very good friends.” Hal said with a little insistence. “Is that a problem?”
“Draco.” He greeted him, as always a mixture of pleasantly surprised to see him and impatient already, like he was ready to tell him he didn’t have time as he would have most people. “Everything alright?”
“Oh my god.” Anthony was clearly trying to be a good friend and contain his glee. “Did she make some for us?”
“What an idiot.” Hal sighed.
.” The ghost inclined his head – which looks dangerously close to tipping over. “But I suppose you can call me Nick.”
“My eyes were starting to bleed.” Draco replied jokingly. “Watching Ron attempt to dance.”
“Mom, move!” Ley barged in impatiently.
“Hello, Draco.” She smiled back.
“Who?”
He knew she was right in a way – it was illegal to give Veritaserum to minors, and while using a Pensieve could be an option (though it was also considered to be a bit of an ethical grey area), children’s memories were often easily thrown out on the basis they were too “emotional.” Draco, however, was about to point out Severus would also be a witness, having caught Lockhart right in the act, but his cousin interrupted his upcoming rant with a snort.
Ignoring whatever concern would surely show on their faces, he flew from the compartment and set off down the corridor, just to put enough distance between them that they wouldn’t try and talk to him until he had processed this new gem.
“You are soft.” Marge snarled. “You’ve let him trick you, a delinquent posing as a helpless boy, you-”
Draco watched her disappear into the common room before he started for the library again. He still thought he might as well find Hermione, though his spirits had been considerably lifted from talking to Luna – and, he suspected, worrying about someone else’s problems, focusing on someone who needed his help, potentially, rather than on someone who could help
He’d have to Polyjuice, too, having been in the Muggle news as a dangerous criminal over the summer – better avoid that can of worms.
“So you don’t remember either?”
He turned around at the whisper, and saw Neville peering at him from his bed.
Hal still wished he could do something. Maybe he’d be a Healer when he grew up. Petunia worked in an office, and that didn’t appeal to him at all. Ley wanted to be a pilot – or something that involved him having his own private jet, it wasn’t always clear. With a jolt, Hal peeled himself off from his aunt to ask her what he’d suddenly realised he didn’t know.
“Yeah, it wasn’t so long ago.” Ron said. “I mean, it ended when I was, like, one year old, but my parents still speak of it. Lest we forget, and all that.”
He liked Harry T, and he knew Ley did too, and he was touched his cousin was prepared to deny himself that friendship (and the prospect of Harry’s great house and swimming pool) but he really did not think that was necessary.
Draco nodded. “He was your dad’s best friend.” He felt on the verge of tears. “They trusted him with their hiding place, and he… He sold them out.”
That was, until a first year in Gryffindor colours sprung up in front of him and snapped his picture, jumping up and down and repeating his name excitedly.
“So they… they treat you well? I saw you with them, I thought you looked alright, but I wasn’t sure…”
“That’s usually what I try to do.” Hal quipped.
“We were two minutes late.” Hal recalled. “Maybe he’s already gone down.”
They reached the point where they’d have to part ways, and Anthony darted towards the stairs leading up to Ravenclaw tower.
The train ride was a great deal of fun, Hal and Anthony having somehow managed to come up with a whole new game loosely based on exploding snap but using chocolate frog cards – and the increasingly ludicrous rules they were making up to use all the cards was testament to just how many of those frogs they’d eaten between all of them.
“It’s perfect.” Draco commented softly, reaching across Neville and Anthony to give Pan’s hand a short squeeze.
“Alright, so maybe he’s always been in rubbish health and it’s stopped him from going through the Animagus process?” Neville surmised.
“He’s my friend.” He pointed out.
“Yeah, it’s somewhere in the Midlands.” Hal provided. “That’s where my mom and my aunt grew up.”
She hadn’t come to Malfoy Manor in years, now that Draco thought about it, probably long enough that she was too young the last time she was to remember anything specific.
“I know, isn’t it fantastic!” Lockhart entirely missed the sarcasm. “Now, come along. The wards are set to let you in. Hogwarts, Defence office!” He shouted as he walked into the flames.
Hal remained silent, and Draco really hoped he wouldn’t ask what for. But as the silence stretched, he couldn’t stand it and volunteered the information – well, the safer part of it.
She remembered the one magical friend of Lily’s she had met as a child, and that seemed more than enough. She knew the friends Lily and James had made at school could not possibly all have been as unpleasant as this boy, but she wasn’t interested enough to seek them out.
deserve an award.”
So instead, he dived, and sure enough, Draco followed. Then, at the last moment, Hal pulled sharply on the tip of his broomstick to make a hairpin turn back upwards. He heard Draco swear and crash into the soft grass behind him, as he flew right back up, and caught the Snitch just left of where he’d spotted it a minute ago.
“I guess…” Draco started hesitantly. “It doesn’t stop people from admiring you for it. In the same way you didn’t do much ten years ago – but still managed to end a war.”
The atmosphere for Ravenclaw games always seemed to be less intense than it was when other teams were playing each other, like they were more interested in the
Hal nodded. “How did you know…” He wasn’t sure how to finish that sentence. What was going on? What to do?
“I may have.” Hal admitted. “Wasn’t sure she’d heard.”
Hal sagged back in his chair. “That’s a lot.” He breathed for his own confirmation.
Maybe people like you, Hal thought. Then, immediately after: fuck it. He wasn’t going to stand for this.
“Yeah.” Draco sighed. “I wonder what kind of crazy the new defence Professor will be this time around.”
“What the hell was that?” Oliver all but shrieked.
Hal snorted. “Yeah, weirder things have happened in the past three days.”
In the commotion, Hal ducked, and whispered to his friends. “I’m going to find Draco.”
That was not him. Those were not his thoughts. They were not. He might have thought like that once, years ago, years and years ago, when his father was still alive and shortly thereafter, but he had changed, he had opened his mind, he
The room was filled with hundreds of ghosts, just as Nick had boasted, all of them together spanning centuries going by the various fashions of their garments – unless ghosts were into fancy dress (could they even change outfits? Hal thought not, they looked to be stuck in what they died in), but that seemed unlikely. Hal was pretty sure he glimpsed a Roman centurion, and one girl hovering in a corner looking sulky was in a Hogwarts uniform that only looked slightly outdated compared to theirs. Difficult to tell which House, seeing as all of her was a silvery transparent colour.
He wasn’t so sure. But he could tell this logic would reassure her – and it would have been sound, if he’d felt like the old wizard applied any logic at all.
And it worried him, because what if Hal didn’t miss him as much either? What he wasn’t even thinking about him? He had his cousin, he was surely having a much more exciting summer. He’d probably barely even noticed Draco’s absence at his party, since everyone else was there. His heart probably didn’t beat faster, louder, when he thought about Draco, the way Draco’s did when he thought about Hal.
“Better?” He asked.
“He’s just a baby.” Hagrid argued, and he looked like he had tears in his eyes. Maybe Hal had a point, not being afraid to give him sass.
They’d come to a locked door. Hal made extra sure by shaking the handle and kicking the bottom of the door a few times.
He choked, and his aunt immediately gathered him into her arms, where he broke down in exhausted sobs.
Two minutes later, she was covered in rashes and struggling to breathe. Thankfully her fellow Ravenclaws reacted quickly – although including, unhelpfully, a Muggle-born sat next to her who was shouting some nonsense about epic pens? Draco decided to ignore that completely as he urgently escorted her to the infirmary.
Draco was rubbing at his neck, looking unamused, but he was the one to point at the door at the other side of the room – the one and only door in the room.
Anthony snorted loudly, and he shook his head when they all turned to him with some confusion.
“Quite.” The wandmaker said. “Yes, quite. How curious. Wand magic never ceases to amaze, Mister Potter. Never ceases. The wand chooses the wizard, did you know? There is so much we still do not understand about wands, they take a life of their own after they are made. How curious.”
“Did Hermione seem weird to you?” Hal asked Ron in an attempt at changing the subject.
He pushed into the shop ahead of Draco, and kept up a constant chatter, pointing at the various items, the whole time it took for Draco to make his choice – a delicate ebony flute that could play itself if you used a specific spell. It had ten recorded tunes and then you could teach it more, which he thought his mother would enjoy too.
“You’re doing it again.” Hal saw right through him. “Stop it. It’s not your fault.”
Hal turned around, coming face to face with two older Hufflepuff boys – seventh year, he’d say, though he wouldn’t have put money on it. He certainly did not know their names.
“He’s fine.” Hermione repeated. “Riddle is gone, completely.”
“Don’t be sorry, my Hal.” She told him. And after another pause: “Do you want to come home?”
“It’s weird and gross, don’t get me wrong.” Ron had added. “But nothing ever happened, you know? He was just a rat. I don’t see the need to start freaking out about it.”
coat that was quite eye-popping. As for Hal, he pulled on a green hoodie that just looked Slytherin and
“I’m with my aunt, but she’s getting a cup of tea with the DAMSELS lady. I think she was a bit overwhelmed.”
“Oh, come on.” Hal groaned. “What is this, Crackerjack?”
“Guess not.” Greg shrugged.
“Mais il est trop mignon!”
“What? I’m too young to drink.” Ron replied airily. “It would be entirely irresponsible.”
“You’re completely safe here.” She shook her head, as if that was meant to be reassuring. “Have you eaten? I can make something else if you don’t like this? What’s your favourite?”
“Because… because!” Draco said eloquently. “We’re friends. We’re friends in a large group of friends. He doesn’t feel the same way, and it will be incredibly uncomfortable and ruin everything. No.”
“Thanks, guys.” Hal offered them a tired smile. “He’s not entirely wrong, though. I was useless today.”
“You are never going to believe what we just saw!”
Hermione had a pout, but she didn’t push. She was, after all, very protective of anyone’s phobias (alongside inclinations, identity, psyche, you name it) within her ongoing campaign that mental health was something that was too often ignored and should be more cared for.
“Parseltongue has been associated with Dark magic ever since.” He explained. “Not that it had a clear reputation before that. The
“We can’t start running around.” Draco immediately said. “I know it’s Lupin and he's a great teacher and we like him, but right now he’s a wild beast, Hal, you know that.”
“I’ve heard that too.” Neville backed her up. “But from there to say that he was trying to throw Hal off his broom, isn’t it a bit of a stretch?”
“The phoenix tears have cleared the poison, but there is only so much the body and the magical core can take. The exhaustion and your other injuries alone would have earned you at least a day in here. You need rest, potions and monitoring if you don’t want to end up with serious nerve or brain damage.”
He imagined he looked quite shaken, and he did hear a slight tremor in his voice as he told his friends what had just happen.
He’d chatted and laughed with Harry Potter, a boy he could only have dreamed of being friends with considering both their heritage. He couldn’t say having ran into him on the train was lucky – he’d pretty much kept walking down the carriages until he’d reached him. But the way the boy had taken him in stride was… unexpected. Not surprising, because Harry didn’t know anything about their world, or the Malfoy family, so why would he be prejudiced against Draco. But unexpected, maybe because Draco had prepared himself for the worst (a lonely year at school where he didn’t fit with his house, but still had to bear the stigma of being a Slytherin, unable to really connect with kids from other houses – the prejudices would be there, this time).
He exchanged a look with Blaise, which turned out to be a mistake.
He also realised he felt incredibly sluggish, his head spinning as he moved. Whatever she had dosed him with the night before, it hadn’t left his system yet – or she’d drugged him again during the night. At least he was still dressed in his own clothes, so whatever her deal was, she wasn’t interested in anything like
He gave him the tour, all the kids’ bedrooms – up flights of stairs that each felt more precariously steep and narrow than the previous one, the attic that may or may not be haunted, the large messy front room, and the most wonderful kitchen Hal had ever seen. He paused in front of the clock, grinning at the hands – at the moment all pointing to
-	I can’t unsee Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen as Draco (except not Danish)
“Hello, Harry.” The old man smiled, eyes crinkling, as Hal tried to sit up straighter.
“I don’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed.” Anthony mused.
McGonagall glared at him, and turned to Wood. “Who’s your reserve?” She asked.
“I swapped them on purpose. Giving Greg the woman.” She winced. “That backfired a bit, but…” She shrugged. “I love it. Being a man. The way people look at you, the way they treat you, it’s so… You wouldn’t know, you’re a boy. You should try being a girl, maybe you’d understand. I want…”
“I had a sword.” Hal dropped.
Draco snorted. “That’s quite the change of tune.” He noted.
It was still only the middle of the afternoon at most, but it was as if night had fallen early. The sky was so heavy with dark grey clouds that barely any sunlight filtered through.
Hal looked a little like that time he’d had some bad lamb at the Indian takeaway and had ended up throwing up all night. He didn’t say anything for a minute, then he got up, picking up Silver as he did so.
to pretty much be their dealer).
That wasn’t the only unpleasant thing they had to deal with following their involvement in the recent events; they had to fend off a lot of attention and accept they would have to be telling their story to various people repeatedly – or debating rumours; no, Salazar Slytherin himself had not been in the Chamber, neither mummified nor because he was immortal (did people really think if he’d uncovered the secret to eternal life, he’d have been hiding away in a moldy underground chamber this whole time?). No, the snake did not grow back two heads when Hal cut one off. And no, Draco certaintly had not briefly turned into a ghost before coming back to life.
“Introductions are indeed overdue.” The man smiled. “I am Remus Lupin, you new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. It is lovely to meet you all.”
like?
“I’m bisexual.” Sirius added with a shrug.
Draco turned to her with a smile, and echoed her thoughts.
Christmas actually came around a lot quicker than expected – before they knew it, they were packing to go home for the holidays. It had been snowing for three days, and there was an air of excitement about. Draco did his best to pretend he was as wired up as the rest of them; in truth, he dreaded going back to his great empty home, he dreaded having to rack his brain to try and make conversation to his disinterested mother, he dreaded the ball, and he was going to miss his friends.
“And your end will be my new beginning.” Riddle relished.
“Locked.” Ron called from the other side of the room, having tried the door.
“I can’t-” Draco choked. “I never told him-”
Hal shrugged. “So I punched him in the face.”
He knew he hadn’t done anything himself to wrong Quirrell, but he was Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, so having an opinion about him was basically political positioning in the wizarding world. He’d legitimately seen an article questioning if the rise in ink and quills prices was due to his starting school, so who knew what national disaster the professor deemed he was responsible for.
It took another minute of Anthony’s piercing gaze before he nodded.
“Come on.” She spoke to him like you would a little child. “Let’s get you some breakfast.”
, Draco had been to his ancient, and therefore deep underground family vault often enough, he knew that sound. Not to mention the pointy, leathery wing that slipped out from under the cloth.
“I’ve known I like boys since I was five.” Draco confessed. “Maybe not so consciously, but… I told my father I wanted to marry Felix Rosier when I was older and I got a belting for it.”
She shrugged. “It’s the right decision.”
“What if he had.” Ley insisted, looking sombre. “Either way, he was taking advantage. No one takes advantage of my little brother.”
“You are and will always be our little girl.” He’d said. “And it’s our job to protect you. While we think it’s
They didn’t stay long, because it was bloody freezing and the snow intensified rather than the opposite, but Hal was grateful to Ron for getting him out of the castle, and allowing him to forget everything for an hour.
“Hermione.” Ron interrupted, looking somewhere between amused and appalled. “Do you really think he cares about the classes he’s missed right now?”
Okay, this chapter is just about feelings.
“Ssh!” Hal flipped a hand up, and Ron’s mouth snapped close. “Hear that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ley was excited about pretty much everything he saw, and while more contained, his mother looked at her surroundings with no small degree of awe either. Draco could relate; his small prior experiences of the Muggle world had been confusing in their own right. He could imagine it took some adjusting, even the things he thought as completely normal, such as the water carafe levitating across the table to refill glasses that were almost empty.
It didn’t stop him from playing along, and they spent the next hour discussing possible candidates. None of them were realistic, and Draco was certainly not going to approach and ask out any of them – or anyone at all – but it did make him feel better to laugh about it.
“Yes.” Hal pointed a finger at him, nodding. “Also, we should stop Quirrell, like, now.”
“The Boggart.” Lupin announced somewhat proudly after they’d made their way into an empty, dusty classroom that day. “Has anyone ever encountered one or even hear of it?”
They were not particularly standing out either – lots of students were gathered in groups of mixed houses so they could be with their friends, Hufflepuff games tended to be the friendliest in terms of the crowds even if the team gave it as good as they got. On top of that, they were sitting right behind the Patil twins, identical except for the colours they were wearing, who could have been the poster girls for inter-house unity.
And he didn’t suspect how very much like James Potter he was in that moment.
“I don’t think so.” Petunia said softly, looking up and taking Hal’s hand. “Your father was an only child and his parents passed...”
Black looked both surprised and hopeful at that.
“I don’t know.” He admitted eventually. “Part of me feels like I’m betraying my heritage, my father’s memory, and losing the right to be the Malfoy heir. Part of me… doesn’t want to be the Malfoy heir. My father was
Ron looked like he didn’t really like the idea of that, but he nodded.
“I think we have to play the game.” Ron guessed. “Win it, I’d wager.”
“Oh, that’s great.” Hal smiled in relief.
*             *
Obviously, that was when the other end of the corridor filled with students coming out of the feast, and the first screams started sounding.
in your Transfiguration essay”), and Hermione was happy with herself on the whole, though critical of some minute detail she could remember not getting quite perfect enough.
“I’m okay.” He groaned. “Go!”
She grabbed him this time, and with a parting nod towards Anthony, Hal followed her through the next door.
“It was
“Good.” Anthony beamed. “With all the love I owe Hal and you guys, of course.” He added, turning to the Gryffindors.
“Here.” Hermione stepped forward, and waved a spell over the girl to remove the blue mess from her. “I’m Hermione, nice to meet you.” She added, holding out her hand.
He wrote to Tom.
Sirius’ eyes widened, and Hal realised he had, in fact, not mentioned his nickname before.
“So, are you interested?”
Right to Hal’s left was Ley, grinning and waving for their friends in the distance (past and present) to join them, and on his right, the vision like a punch in the gut, was a little girl of seven or eight, holding Little John Silver. She looked exactly like Lily, except her curls were as black as all the other Potters. A sister.
“You have a phone!” Hal noted enthusiastically as she stopped moving long enough so he could see what she was holding.
a girl.”
“I’ll try not to disappoint.” Hal resolved.
“Let me briefly give you a little bit of context.” The Professor addressed all of them long-sufferingly. “Mister Potter here, apparently unbeknownst to himself, just spoke Parseltongue, which is the language of snakes.”
It came out in Parseltongue, and he had little hope he would actually turn the Basilisk against its established master, but it still seem to give the serpent pause and it briefly stopped in its attempt to either crush Hal with its head or catch him between its fangs. At the very least it gave Hal a brief moment of respite, enough to take a breath, and an opening to run back across the room, even as Riddle laughed coldly that the creature would only answer to him. If he only could get Draco out of the open space, and as close as possible to the door…
The second theory people seemed to favour was that
-	This fic redeems Petunia and Dudley, be prepared to (hopefully) like them. They’re truly Harry’s family.
“Basket.” Hal said.
“Oh dear!” He jumped off to the side, away from the reptiles. “See what I’m saying? Unexpected danger! Potter!” He grabbed Hal, who was closest to him, and placed himself behind him like a shield. “Now let’s see what Professor Snape has taught you!”
Hal saw a breach in the crowd and disappeared into a corridor, confident he hadn’t been seen. There were footsteps following him but he suspected one of his friends, going by the lack of angry shouting for him to
“It’s there.” Hal nodded, before realising how stupid that sounded. “I mean, I didn’t get to use it much, obviously, but it feels strong. Back to normal.”
She said as much to her mother, after the meet and greet.
“Well, no, I mean.” She babbled, flustered. “Not exactly, but there isn’t any harm in getting some information, is there. Anyway. What I was saying was. James Potter is really highly ranked in a lot of them, he was brilliant. And Lily Evans was best in her year in Charms for OWLs
He had in fact very carefully remained at the back of the class, because when Lupin had announced the exercise, he’d suddenly had a very clear vision of what his Boggart may be. Probably a crowd of his friends and other Hogwarts students, pointing and laughing because they’d found out about his hopeless crush on Hal. With Hal in the middle, giving him a disgusted look and telling him he was gross, and he’d ruined their friendship, and his feelings would never be returned. He knew it in himself that the real Hal would never actually react this cruelly – but the likelihood that he would turn him down with kindness and pity was high enough to fuel this irrational fear, and that had a very high chance of being what the Boggart would feed off.

“I’ll sort it, arite.” Hagrid pledged to the two boys.
Snape gave them a moment to absorb the shock before he carried on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s your Head of House.” Draco reminded her. “You can talk to him at any point.”
“Oh.” Pan let out a sigh of relief. “So it’s… as simple as that?”
“We just wanted to look at it.”
This time, Hal felt like the wood was warm, calling something inside him, and he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
It did not reassure Draco.
“Oh.” Draco breathed.
Another woman sat down next to her, looking exhausted.
birthday, so the others aren’t invited, I don’t want them to feel like...”
“If my parents disinherit me and hate me for ever, got it.” Pan completed.
Severus muttered something to himself, Draco only caught the words
“She went to the library.” Neville said.
“Excuse me.” Draco suddenly got up from the table – he seemed to be shaking – and made his way out of the Great Hall.
He’d first thought the twins were mad, but they’d convinced Hal to play catch with enchanted potatoes for a bit of a demonstration, and he’d had to admit they were on to something.
“Miss G-Granger, anything you would like t-to share with the class?”
Draco’s heart clenched – he knew he’d given her the worst scare she’s had since that illness that had almost killed him years ago. She did not deserve that. He should be the one buying her comforting gifts, and he resolved to send her something from Hogsmead as soon as they had their first weekend outing there.
Desperate to change the subject, he started: “Your mom is…” He realised he had nothing to say about Draco’s mom, but it was too late to backtrack. “Nice.” He finished lamely.
Anthony chuckled. “You guess?”
“Hal.” The boy nodded – Draco, he remembered. An unusual name. “Are you alright?”
“What the
“You… sorry, what?” All of them asked variations of the same.
“What?” The others all reacted.
“The Demel what?” Hal interrupted.
“Right.” Hal nodded. “I think-”
“So get this.” Blaise dropped his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “It’s not the first time the Chamber has been open. This happened before, about fifty years ago.”
“Sev asked me to tell him how the exams went.” Draco said, as the others nodded and expressed commiseration. “I’ll walk with you.”
“Professor?”
Hal spotted a number of ginger heads; Fred and George who seemed to be playing catch with garden gnomes with the rest of the Quidditch team and Lee, two older boys he assumed were Bill and Charlie, from Ron’s accounts, Ron’s little sister screaming encouragements (or maybe abuse) at the lot of them, and Percy trying to look cool reading a book straddling a windowsill higher up.
He fought against sleep for a little bit, reluctant to fall back into a bad dream or feverish delirium, but he didn’t have enough energy to keep that up, and before long, he was dropping off again.
“Of course he’ll be okay.” Hal had replied the previous times.
Draco waited, and when nothing further came through the page, prompted.
Draco felt quite proud of her, in that moment.
“My girlfriend.”
Hermione seemed satisfied by that, but Draco noticed Anthony was now looking at him sharply. And sure enough, when they left the table to head out to their respective classes, he grabbed his arm to pull him to the side.
“What’s going on?” Ron spoke out, looking completely lost. They all did.
“Sometimes?” Anthony laughed as well.
“Do you know, this year will be my five-hundredth deathday!”
The first meeting of the Duelling Club happened on the first Friday of December, and the turnout was phenomenal. It seemed like over half the school was interested in the event, in spite of the fact that Lockhart was heading it. Hal had very little hope that they’d learn anything from him, but since Draco had mentioned Snape was the other professor who’d agreed to supervise the evening, he trusted they had a chance of going away with something useful there.
away from Silver.”
“We love you.” The Hufflepuff girl blurted out, then blushed an intense shade of red.
“Colin!” Someone called, and Hal spotted Ginny’s flaming red hair slicing through the crowd.
Hal did not feel particularly stressed, but he assumed she meant that in a medical sense. McGonagall came nearer, in the space vacated by his friends as Pomfrey shooed them away, in spite of their protests – except for Ron, who hobbled to his own bed, his broken leg needing some rest too, though magically mended.
“No.” Hal pulled back the other way.
The conversation was cut short as a voice started echoing down the hall, beyond the doors, accompanied by hurried footsteps.
“I just don’t want anything happening to you. You’re completely safe here.” She repeated.
Final part at last! This one is smaller but I wanted to wrap up properly. At some points I was really struggling with this fic, and now it’s longer than the first book...
“Of course I trust you.” He pledged. “I- I didn’t think it was that bad, I didn’t want to burden you guys.”

“As soon as we possibly could.” Hermione confirmed, claiming the chair next to him and taking his hand. “Oh, I’ve taken notes in all classes for the past two weeks, so you won’t-”
Flint hadn’t done or said anything to that, though that probably had been because the rest of the Slytherin teams had started filling the corridor and Draco had skedaddled as fast as his legs could carry him while maintaining dignity. He’d had the mad hope that that would be it, for a couple of hours. He was able to enjoy the game, cheer the Gryffindors on, watch them get well on their way to winning. He didn’t think much of it when Slytherins multiplied fouls, because that was they always did, Flint wasn’t the first captain to encourage that. They only got nastier as the game went on – it wasn’t unusual.
“Sometimes.” Neville said in a very small voice. “I feel like you’re the lucky one.”
“Boys!” Draco’s mother eventually called them after hours of zooming about on brooms, both attempting to explain the rules of Quidditch to Ley and to play something called ‘football’ when they were on the ground (Draco remembered Hal, Dean and Seamus going on about it once, it sounded very complicated) and all in all just having the time of their life.
He hadn’t intended to sound sarcastic, but it somehow came out just that level of dryness, and Black barked something like a joyless laugh.
Quirinus Quirrell was faced with a decision. The Dark Lord was quiet. The Dark Lord only spoke to him when he had specific orders to give, or – Morgana forbid – some discontent to express. The Dark Lord would not want to be disturbed because Quirinus did not dare make a decision. The Dark Lord did not think the Potter boy was a threat, young as he still was – but He had not seen him. He had not heard him. The Potter boy was up to something. He knew about the Cerberus, he knew about the Stone, no doubt, and the rest of its protective measures, he was scheming, he was plotting, he was waiting to thwart Quirinus and the Dark Lord in their plans. Like Albus, like Severus, he was in the way.
It was only a bit later that Hal’s day considerably cheered up, with a combination of waffles, a very hyper Dudley finally awake and raring to go, a showing of
“Are you okay, Draco?” Hermione asked him a bit later. “You look tired.”
“Do you believe him?” She asked eventually.
“Oh.” Hal winced. He didn’t say
“No.” Pan admitted. “I think he’s burying his head in the sand a little. But that’s why I think, if Draco told him, it might kick him into gear. Make him think, as well. And it’s not like there’s nothing to think about, I mean, come on, do you remember how they were at the end of last year?”
“Draco?” A soft knock on the door pulled him out of his thoughts, and he turned to see his mother smiling softly at him, two pieces of parchment in her hand.
“I know, love.” Petunia kissed him on the forehead again. “She’s gone now.”
“You’ve been dead for twelve years.” He threw back, breathless and starting to feel dizzy. “Swings and roundabouts.”
He took a few moments – and a couple of deep breaths – to collect himself, and let his education kick back in.
Hal shrugged it off, because everyone was telling him so, but it was empty words as far as he was concerned. Ron, however, didn’t leave him be. He planted himself in front of him and grabbed both his shoulders.
The room was larger than any of the previous ones, and empty but for a large mirror, so Hal’s gaze could only be drawn to it. He recognised it instantly, and his heart did a little summersault as he couldn’t help but think
“Alright, in my defence, I was in the hospital for half the holidays, and my nan did everything in her power to keep me lying down or sat down for the rest of it, so this is the best I could do.”
She took a deep breath, let it out, looking at him gravely.
“Yes?” Hermione encouraged him.
Hal laughed at the
Ron had apparently appointed himself Hal’s breakfast coach on match days, and was lining up everything he thought he should be eating for maximum energy and flying performance, without weighing him down, while Had shook his head at him, amused. He complied and drank his kiwi juice, ate his brown toast with egg and beans, but Ron couldn’t stop him from snatching a few bites of blueberry pancake to top it up.
Timid footsteps seemed to come near, then hover behind the curtains surrounding the bed, which Petunia pushed aside. Draco was on the other side, Little John Silver cradled in his arms. The young cat tried to jump off as soon as it saw Hal.
“I just guessed.” Anthony nodded slowly. “It wasn’t said outright, but… yeah, it’s kind of obvious once you’ve got it in your mind.”
He was still hazy about what was and wasn’t possible in terms of magic, but it seemed one of the only limits was your own skill and creativity. It wasn’t uncommon for wizards to just go and invent spells (to varying degrees of success), magical items (case in point right there) or potions (Hal’s grandfather being a solid proof of that and, from what Draco had told him, Snape too, though less commercial about it).
“Congratulations.” Hermione beamed. “That’s such a big step!”
“And when all the first choices are gone and the only ones left are people like you who are just
“I was interested to notice you were friends with Mister Malfoy.” He mused. “It could be a very good influence on him.”
“Hal…” Draco did not know how to act, what to say. “Don’t look him up.” He only advised with a hint of desperation.
Ley and Petunia had made their way from the kitchen and were both eyeing the man with a mix of curiosity and wariness, though Hal's aunt was better at hiding it, and waved him in with a pleasant smile
Thankfully, he sunk through the floor looking tormented without waiting for an answer.
So in the end, he’d spent the entire night covering page after page with drawings of this parallel reality, unwilling to lose it, but just as unwilling to get sucked in, and he’d let it go, trying to forget about the mirror altogether. He’d not told anyone about it, even when they asked about the bags under his eyes.
“How are you feeling?” Draco asked with more evident worry.
Oh Merlin, there was going to be a murder. Hal panicked, running frantically after where he thought the voice was coming from, which was made difficult because although clear to him, it was only a faint hiss, and his own footsteps covered it as he followed it.
“Do you need to see Pomfrey for this?” He added, waving at Luna’s face.
Sirius laughed, and clasped Hal on the shoulder.
She was probably right, Hal thought. He knew there were Healers in the Wizarding world, which was proof not everyone could just wave their wand and make it all better. Even the fact that they had a school infirmary – it wasn’t just about doing a spell, or administering a potion, otherwise the teachers could do it, and they wouldn’t need Madam Pomfrey.
eviscerate one of them if they lost. Maybe the rain had let up a bit – or maybe Hal was just a bit more confident he wasn’t going to die, and he was projecting his feelings on everyone else. At any rate, they dominated the second half.
Some concern always prevailed, though, and Draco would have smiled, but he forced his features to remain stern.
“Does that not make me a true Gryffindor or such bullshit?” He challenged.
. You can’t keep him this close to the school.”
.” She sneered. Draco could tell she was quoting. But then she looked down, and she almost looked like she was going to cry. “But I want to.”
“He doesn’t hate you.” Draco sighed.
He didn’t have to spell it out – the entire school was still on occasion talking about Flint’s encounter with Hal’s fist and full-body bind. Draco, in fact, suspected it was also part of the reason why Flint hadn’t tried it on again. It wasn’t particularly, or only, that he was afraid of Hal’s retaliation – the idea of people laughing at him would be an additional and maybe even a stronger deterrent.
And his mother, he thought. He did not really want to think about how she would react. He knew she loved him, and probably still would. But he had a feeling she also would be disappointed, worried maybe, and sad. And he had no intention of telling her, not in the near future at least.
.” Hermione corrected.
“And you can?” She raised an unimpressed eyebrow at him. “I’m not one of the Ravenclaws in the room.”
Hal couldn’t help but snort. “Are they?” He asked, tongue-in-cheek.
Hal was getting a bit fed up with this convenient
“Wow.” Ley commented. “Never seen an adult whose spelling was worse than mine.”
“Phoenixes can carry extraordinary weights.” Draco said, as if reciting something from a book.
He spotted Pansy when they arrived, trying to look older than she was in a long green dress, high heels and careful makeup. She wasn’t entirely succeeding, but she looked nice. She was flanked by Daphné and Gregory – who had taken to following them like a guard dog in the past couple of months – and clearly basking in the slightly envious looks they were getting from Astoria, Daphné’s younger sister, and the Carrow twins who were the same age.
“It fell right on top of James too.” Sirius recalled with one of his barks of a laugh. “It was in his ears, everywhere. He was washing the stuff off his hair for weeks.”
“Don’t be.” Hal shook his head. “It’s not your fault, and… thanks for telling me.”
“Oh.” Hal breathed. “It’s amazing.”
“I wish they’d just leave you alone.” Remus admitted.
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “Was that a pun of some kind?”
“Better make it more challenging for me then, will you.” He teased.
“Many questions, yes.” Lockhart’s lawyer jumped to his feet. “Thank you, Judge.”
“Minerva.” Severus interrupted her. “We need to contact Albus for him to return right away. I fear what he suspected is true – Quirinus has gone after the stone, and we know it isn’t for himself.”
They both cracked up, and started laughing so hard they actually had to stop for breath, doubled over and leaning on each other for support. Once their hilarity had subsided, and they carried on walking towards the castle, Draco looked back thoughtfully at the (still faintly smoking) hut.
“It must have been quite overwhelming, at first.”
“Same, then.” Pan mimicked his shrug.
“Lily…” She continued. “Your mother got a letter just like this when she was your age. We found out she was one of these people, she had magic. She went to this school to learn how to use it.” She pointed at the letter. “She met your father there, and you… you are like them. I wasn’t sure you would be.” She said again in way of an apology, for not telling him sooner this rather significant piece of information about his parents, about himself.
“You’re kidding?”
Draco said he’d come, and Hermione pretended she would join only so that someone could keep an eye on them and make sure they didn’t get into trouble, but Hal could tell she was almost thrumming with excitement at the idea of speaking to ghosts, which were only second to books in terms of sources of knowledge – and only because there were no intricacies about getting the knowledge from a book, as opposed to ghosts who Hal presumed, some of them, might quite tetchy about being asked about their past life. This being said, some magical books had a mind of their own too, and Hal did know of some that would only let you read them if you asked nicely.
“He’ll be okay.” Hal’s aunt whispered in his ear for what must have been the thirtieth time, carding her fingers through his hair.
2. I didn’t include a scene for Pan coming out to Blaise, but he’s cool with it too. In fact, his response was “That’s okay, Pan, I never thought of you as a girl anyway.” I apologise if I’ve misrepresented things in any way – truth is I don’t personally know anyone who is transgender or has struggled with their gender identity so I’m making it up from second-hand information from friends and the Internet. I do know things in real life aren’t that easy. Pan has good friends.
“Wait, I was teasing.” She grabbed his arm. “You’re in
or what-have-you.
to reach that level of comfort, he’d spent hours on a broom whizzing around the Manor from when he was about four years old. Hal had first touched a broom at eleven and it’d been effortless ever since.
Draco winced at that, and Hal bristled.
“I think his great-grand-parents may have been Greek or Italian.” Petunia conceded non-committally.
“Bonus is.” Anthony added, pleased with himself. “It eats spiders.”
“You could always visit.” Ron suggested. “We’re always having games in our back garden. Mom would
“No.” Draco said shakily. “We’re leaving. Right now.”
“Sometimes…” Lupin started carefully. He cleared his throat when all the children directed his attention to him. “Dementors are known to make you feel hopelessness and despair. In close proximity, that can translate into reliving your worst memories, or the time in which you’ve been at your most vulnerable. If those moments were particularly strong or traumatising… you can be rather affected. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.” He added.
He ran out of his office, heading straight for the Headmaster’s.
“Poltergeists can have some corporeal strength.”
.” He urged Anthony.
Hermione flushed a light red.
As Hal could only gape at him, he carried on chattering.
He tried to ignore all of it and focus on Quidditch, because their first game was coming up, and Hal realised that if he’d thought Oliver had been intense the year before, it was nothing compared to his attitude when the team was playing Slytherin. This year, he seemed particularly incensed, for reasons that Hal came to understand had nothing to do with Quidditch.
“I've got money at stake here.” Pan reminded him. “Think of your friends.”
“And that’s when your head hit the wall.”
Another breath, resiting the urge to rub at his wrists and neck where he could feel phantom ropes.
. Draco lasted another seven seconds before he turned around.
But he looked down, and saw the phoenix’s red and golden head resting on his arm, and where the puncture wound had been… nothing but a round scar. A last couple of silver drops fell onto it, before the bird raised his head off to look at Hal – the silver drops where his tears.
“We noticed you yesterday.” Nils said.
“What?”
Draco didn’t really get a chance to further comment, as they turned the corner to the corridor and came into view of Hal and Anthony, who came running towards them.
“Mister Potter.” Pomfrey suddenly added, sounding startled. “You should not be awake yet.”
“I know, it’s ridiculous.” Draco admitted. “I only started realising that after my father died, you know. I probably wouldn’t be… well, anything like this, if he hadn’t died. I probably would be in Slytherin, and quite proudly so.”
“Pretty shit.” Hal admitted.
Petunia took a deep breath. This was another hard pill to swallow.
He wondered if he should broach the subject, and ask her how she’d feel if he had a boyfriend instead, but he didn’t really want to do that on the phone. And he thought he probably needed a little more time to think about it himself, to really understand what he felt like, what he wanted. Talking to Draco hadn’t really helped, if he was honest, it probably had made him even less sure than he’d been before.
“You could have stayed with us again too.” Anthony said.
to learn some respect.” He spat. “Say ‘Yes sir, I will learn some respect’.”
“It’s always a weird time.” Hal was saying. “Having so much fun with Ley, and the anniversary, and seeing my aunt all sad and… and now neither of them are here. And I love it here, but I want to be home.” He confessed.
“Problem, Potter?” He scorned. “Something that didn’t get through that thick skull of yours properly, earlier?”
As his heart rate went back to normal – and no he still wasn’t
“So, Harry.” Percy Weasley addressed him when the first rush had calmed down a bit. He seemed in a good mood tonight. “What did you think of you first year at Hogwarts?”
“Must be nice.”
“Again?” Rolf asked quietly.
“He’s the only who knows.” Pan quickly confirmed.
“It’s fine.” Hal said without lying.
She was looking at that tin now, back down from the loft, sitting on her bed. She had opened it once before, when the bundle that was Harry had shown up on their doorstep, to recover the bank details she remembered James had mentioned. It had been her main argument against Vernon to justify raising her sister’s son – sentiment would not have swayed him, but money definitely could. The Potters had set it all up so that they would essentially be paid monthly child support from the account after confirming Petunia accepted to be his legal guardian.
“Exactly why you should talk it through with your brilliant and knowledgable cousin.” Ley nodded solemnly.
“I’m not eating anything from you.” Hal spat out – both the words and the porridge, when she tried to push the spoon past his clenched lips.
That last one was Draco, brushing mud off his knees, but looking unhurt and smiling.
“Oh, that’s what we’re calling it.”
“But you’re right.” He added. “I could spend more time with them.”
As the Headmaster got up and left, he realised it wasn’t true. It had been extremely awkward, and he’d be happier if he never had a one-to-one with Albus Dumbledore in such fashion ever again. Surely he had better things to do than chat to first-years? From all other evidence, he did. As far as Hal knew, he didn’t go around visiting students in the care of Madam Pomfrey this randomly. Hal always felt a little resentful that this was not standard treatment, but rather a ‘privilege’ reserved for Harry Potter, Defeater of Dark Wizards. Couldn’t people just get over that?
“Both of them.” Hal confirmed. “They made it into a game, I don’t know. It’s no big deal, I just… It was weird.”
“They have similar opinions regarding what we would call intellectual property. And they have taken it upon themselves to reward the true owners – the makers, the inventors – of many things. Royalties, if you will. So in your case, Mister Potter, although your grandfather sold his company before retiring, the Goblins are still redirecting some of the profit to his vault. Well, yours. His heir.”
Draco had never heard Hal sound so insincere, and though Nils certainly did not know him as well as Draco did, he still took the hint.
“Pretend what?” Ron prompted, oblivious.
Hal snorted, feeling some history there – he’d gotten the impression, from Sirius’ Hogwarts tale, that Remus had been a bit like the Hermione of their group.
“Alright, stop being smug and go to class.”
“It’s a real shame you’re not in Slytherin.” He said. “You seem to get along with the kids there alright.”
“Yes.” Sirius confirmed. “But-”
“Don’t you dare.” He threatened.
Once dressed in their new attires – and even Draco had to admit, he’d gotten as caught up in as the others, and they were having a lot of fun – Pansy distributed the hair and they drunk the potion, which was honest to Merlin the most disgusting thing Draco had ever put in his mouth (and that included a snails and sprouts purée he’d had to stomach when once staying with a distant French relative of his mother’s).
“Ha, well, yes.” George confirmed. “Ollie flies for the other team.”
Anthony rolled his eyes, but let it drop, as they were about to be admitted into Neville’s room.
They didn’t do a full tour, they didn’t have all day, but Draco showed Ley some of the main rooms. He left out the library with the lovely balcony – that was his space, and he’d wanted to share it with Hal the year before, but that was… Hal was different. And Hal noticed, of course, as they walked right past the staircase that would have taken them up there, but he didn’t say anything, and when Draco caught his eye, he simply smiled understandingly.
“Let’s imagine I’m
“Our next class is Divination, I can live with that.” Anthony said. “What do you guys have next?”
know the pressure there is on families like
“What kind of monster petrifies people?” Anthony frowned, looking like he was going over a list of creatures he’d heard of in his head.
“He won’t be happy here.” Hal delivered the final blow. “Think how much happier he would be running and flying free with some friends.”
He grabbed one of the photos to hand it to Petunia; it was a large one of Lily, looking straight at the camera as if she was challenging them, a little looped quirk in her eyebrows the only movement.
“So what’s your plan now?” He enquired.
Hal put his finger on the figure of a younger girl, delicately drawn, wearing dungarees and welly boots and her curly hair down.
“I mean, he’s got a point.” Ley piped up.
“I’ll fly there if I have to.” He said ferociously.
The look on the other two boys’ faces told Hal they immediately saw that it was completely something they should do, and at the same time an absolutely terrible idea.
I know James’ parents are meant to have seen him get married to Lily, but I like the idea (so to speak) that he matured in his seventh year at Hogwarts partly because his parents died…
When Hal mentioned that he had several days of visits lined up, all his friends wanting to see him but having decided they probably shouldn’t all come at once, Sirius bounced back and announced he’d also be seeing Draco the following month.
“Alright, well. I guess that’s me. Enjoy your day, yeah?”
“How is that not unrealistic?” Ginny protested. “It contradicts my prediction!”
“You’re joking, right?” She checked.
“I- No, I mean.” Sirius babbled. “I just didn’t expect that.”
He pushed a small parcel towards Hal, wrapped in cloth. When he unravelled the fabric, Hal found a hand mirror.
“Oh, Lana will be thrilled.” Gabriel commented happily before skittering out of the kitchen.
When they were settled there, with a little reluctance, Draco told them about the diary – omitting the parts where he confided in Tom for just about everything, including his confused and confusing thoughts about some of the boys in this very room – and what Tom had showed him regarding the events fifty years ago.
It was true, Hal had gotten into the habit of keeping the Invisibility Cloak on him at all times, thinking that if he ever heard the Basilisk, he wouldn’t miss that chance to follow it just because he couldn’t be seen running after it without getting in trouble. The solution was just to not be seen. However, that did not mean Draco’s sudden request made any more sense. Something seemed off with him.
They repeated their introductions, expressions of mistrust and non-promises of friendship when Hermione and Ron found them, but Draco’s friends – and he marvelled a little at that – seemed to just accept that Pan was going to be part of their group now, sometimes, maybe.
And there was just no getting used to that.
He still felt a bit odd about that, and he didn’t want any special favours or anything, but having been selected against the rules for his skill… that was nice. He wanted to be proud of that. He explained the friendly game – he had to go into a little detail about Quidditch, such as the fact that it implied flying on broomsticks – and Fred and George convincing their head of house, and the other player quitting…
They had to go as their five minutes were up, and Pomfrey gently showed them the door. McGonagall escorted them back to the Ravenclaw common room first, dropping off Anthony and Draco, then to Gryffindor. The mood in the common room was subdued, the few groups of scattered students who were still around having clearly heard the news. They shot Neville, Ron and Hal looks between pity and encouragement, and the three of them didn’t have to discuss it or even look at each other to decide they’d rather go upstairs.
Draco got a bit lost in the subsequent explanations about who this Sherlock was.
“Why would you want that?” His father prompted further.
Gryffindor had won the House cup again, courtesy of the 200 points Dumbledore had awarded Hal for that little deed of besting Voldermort, again, saving Draco’s life and potentially countless others that would have been on the line if Tommy the Teenage Dark Lord hadn’t been stopped. After the award, Hal thought it was all a bit over the top to grant him that huge amount of points as well, but he wasn’t going to complain when everyone was so happy celebrating.
“This mirror shows your deepest desires.” Quirrell conveniently explained. “I see myself giving my master the stone, I see him in glory, rewarding me for my service…” He lost himself for a moment, looking dazedly at the pane, then seemed to remember Hal was there. “What do you see?” He pressed.
Ley, who had been fully briefed by Hal (Draco wondered if there was anything Hal didn’t tell him), was explaining the situation to Dora in stage whispers. She made approving noises, her hair (probably unconsciously, she’d explained to them how it happened sometimes based on her emotions) turning striped: blue, pink and white. It was a good thing they weren’t in a Muggle area right now.
Anthony shrugged. “Fair enough. Then let’s go.”
“What was it supposed to achieve, me getting the stone out of the mirror?” Hal challenged.
“Alright.” Snape pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a deep breath. “I will speak to the Headmaster about this, he may want to see you.”
“What do you see?” Quirrell asked.
“I’m just saying it sounded more like a gang feud than what we would call a war.” Hermione said, oblivious to his distress. “Only going by the scale of it.”
“Did you feel the cold hand of Death’s grip you before He released you back among the living?”
“You already knew Black was one of your parents’ mates and that he was in prison, but with this happening… I thought maybe you’d want to hear the full story from a friend.” Draco explained. “Rather than read it in the paper. Merlin knows the
He put a hand on the back of her chair, and leaned in casually, in a show of keeping this conversation private, though he was still speaking perfectly loudly and clearly enough for everyone around the table – who were hanging to his every word – to hear everything without strain.
“That does
“D-do p-p-pay attention.” The professor instructed somewhat weakly, before carrying on with his lecture.
The caught-red-handed look on Hermione’s face told them he wasn’t wrong.
Draco could just picture him playing havoc around the neighbourhood with his cousin in previous years, as he had so far demonstrated he could run for Britain (he wasn’t only fast on a broom), climb just about anything and squeeze into the smallest spaces. He’d even threatened to go for a swim in the lake once or twice, but Draco had so far managed to remind him that this was Scotland – it could be as hot as it wanted to be outside (for about two days a year, on good years), the water would still be freezing cold.
“Isn’t he like, a hundred years old?” Ron asked.
He spent five minutes trying to direct the pieces, until he moved into a square already occupied, and the piece moved off to leave him take its place. For another few minutes, he tried to start the game with no success.
The argument carried on all day, Hermione urging Hal to talk to someone if his scar was suddenly hurting, Hal insisting it wasn’t and wanting to hear no more about it, Ron and Neville staying carefully out of it. Anthony and Draco were only filled in at dinnertime, their respective classes having kept them separate till then.
“Not sure I’d eat one if I did.” Hal replied quietly.
Anthony grinned like she had paid him a compliment.
The game was great fun. They’d managed to borrow training Quidditch balls, so it was as close as it could get to the real thing, and Hal truly discovered the exhilaration of flying for the sport, like he hadn’t been able to fully explore during their rather limited lessons. He found out speed didn’t scare him, rather the opposite in fact.
She vaguely remembered one of Lily’s letters mentioning something like that – she’d honeymooned with James around the Mediterranean. Marge made a derogatory
Hal shrugged. “I guess it would be pretty cool, if it didn’t make people think I’m the kind of person who goes around attacking whoever I can find in the corridors.”
, and attacked him in the same fashion, only to get annihilated by what looked from here like sheer dumb luck. He had been a baby, for God’s sake. How did anyone even believe for a second he’d had any kind of special power, any choice in the matter?
“You pick on him constantly.” Draco argued. “Maybe he would do better in class if he wasn’t spending it in a constant state of terror.”
“You don’t have your magic toffees on you, do you?” He asked in a low voice.
So I’ve decided the attack is meant to be at the start of the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game; the March and April chapters will be freestyle, and shit will still get real when it makes more sense to start wrapping it up, in May. In canon the long gap in attacks is explained because Harry has the diary, and Ginny only gets it back later. Here, Draco is just more cautious about using it, and probably a bit more resilient to the possession, now he feels more confident about himself, so things will take Tom a bit longer!
“That’s what Draco said.” He grinned back.
Hal rolled his eyes. “It’s just a colour. And it’s not like it’s going to be a statement, out in Surrey.”
“Why does it matter?” He retorted.
“They tend to be pretty fierce.” Rolf informed. “But they can be tamed, some magizoologists have knacks, you know? A bit like Muggles with lions.”
“Draco, Nev and Rolf will be getting backup.” Hal reminded her. “We might as well carry on and slow him down. It’s not like he can Apparate out.”
“Oh, shit.” Anthony commented as all three of the dog’s heads started to stir.
Hermione flushed. “I don’t mean anything morbid by it.” She said. “But I suppose the ideologies are… foreign to me.”
The hardest part about exams had probably been managing Hermione’s stress, and the fallout of comments such as “it’s only exams”; although if the boys were honest with themselves, her intensity had probably helped kick them into gear a little, and they all most likely did a little better than they would have had without her inflexibility.
Things got a little hazy from there, but Draco could tell he was hit by a series of jinxes, and that he just needed to hold on and wait for it to be over. At one point, one of the four boys got a little overeager, and the bottom of Flint’s cloak caught fire. He put it out, but he looked furious.
“Sorry mate, but…” Ron started.
Tom Riddle, if Hal remembered the name of Draco’s diary friend correctly. He could see the cursed book now, down at the boy’s feet.
He could see the surprise clear on Sev’s feature for once, if only fleetingly before he composed himself. Draco still allowed a few seconds for that to sink in before he continued.
Having heard what the twins were up to, he came foaming at the mouth during breakfast, the morning after they’d tried for the second time to convince the Head of House to let Hal on the team. His screams were hardly fully strung sentences, though the words “going behind my back” and “only because he’s Harry Potter” were recognisable – at which point Oliver Wood himself started shouting back.
Draco had a dilemma on his hands. With three days to go to the Easter holidays, he had received a letter from his mother that morning, informing him that she had been invited to visit her dear friend Michelle in her villa in the south of France, and would he therefore mind terribly staying at Hogwarts over the break. Yes, Draco minded, but what choice did that leave him with?
“He’s the best Seeker in the world.” He told them all with conviction. “It's a foregone conclusion.”
“Sure, great.” Hal said under his breath.
“Don’t do it again.” She chastised. “Ever. Honestly, you boys. Trouble has a way of finding you.”
“Can a Squib brew magical potions?” Hermione enquired.
Draco did not have a chance to argue, before he and the others were pushed out of the room, as Severus disappeared inside the trap door.
Hal sat there miserably for the rest of the hour, staring down at the table vacantly, trying not to fall asleep, as his classmates finished their potions and wrapped up. Ron patted him on the back on his way out, Neville gave him a weak smile and Hermione whispered
Hal gave him an odd look, but he seemed to take the opportunity to stop with the doom and gloom, and answered in a much lighter tone.
“Back off.” Hal told it. “Go back to your friends.”
Draco tried to communicate telepathically, ‘I can’t believe you almost said
“I- yes.” Neville assured. “Though I thought, maybe, I should sit at the front.”
, impressed. Boys were reckless, she had always known that, and once it had become clear Hal was unlikely to walk away or wait for teachers to be found, and the others were compelled enough by his sudden show of leadership (and she had to admit, it was somewhat magnetic) to follow him blind, she had thought the best thing to do was come along and at least see if she could do something to ensure the band of
“Could be anything.” Neville concluded.
“Intra, something.” Hal replied. “It’s not a spell I know, I can’t remember the word, but it was something like that-” he waved his hand in a loopy fashion to indicate the wand movement “-and it made ropes appear and ties us down.”
Looking up, Draco realised he was by the library, and he’d walked right past Hermione.
A startled laugh pushed past Hal’s lips, and Draco felt a little smug. It was like a superpower, making Hal laugh.
Neville paused at the entrance of the Potions classroom, looking in warily, as if he was going to see a pool of his blood still on the floor. There was, of course, no evidence left of what had happened, not even a stain or faint marks from the runes the St Mungo’s staff had used to transport him.
“Yes?”
This year was different. He had been feeling a lot more depressed, in the run up to the date, and while he realised that he was probably a little (a lot) homesick and that not being able to dress up with Ley and stuff their faces full of sweets watching horror films did take a lot of fun out of the holiday, he wasn’t sure why it mattered so much. Sure, being in the world his parents had been a part of made a difference, he had been hearing their names a lot more, and that was part of it, but that was a constant. So he wasn’t sure why exactly he felt, now specifically, on the verge of a panic attack, affected by the date to an extent he had never been before. It wasn’t as if he remembered being there.
Hermione came forward to pull Hal back slightly, who was right up in Ron’s face.
“Come on!” Ron dragged him into the house. “Let me show you around before we join the others.”
“So you’ve been chosen. You don’t want it, well, tough. You’ve been dealt this lot, there’s nothing you can do about it but chose what to do with it. You’d rather be ordinary? You can’t. What does that leave you with? Do nothing, which is an option, sure. Or would you want to make the world a better place with whatever tools you have?”
“I promise.”
“No I don’t.” Hal defended himself immediately.
“Okay.” He assessed. Then he clapped his hands, all cheer recovered. “Alright, Transfig!”
“Anyone giving you trouble?” Snape asked more explicitly.
would work? Cross that bridge – he bolted.
Quirinus Quirrell made a decision. Like Albus, like Severus, the Potter boy would have to be removed.
“I love her.” Hal giggled once it seemed safe to do so. “But sometimes, she’s so intense.”
Sirius was in the main room of the pub, three empty cups in front of him, as if he’d been waiting down there since he’d been awake – which, really, Hal wouldn’t really have been that surprised. He must be going a little stir crazy by now, stuck here on his own, though Sirius had let slip that he’d received visits from Lupin. The man sprung to his feet when he spotted Hal, a smile breaking onto his face, fuller now, healthier than when Hal had first met him. He looked younger, and a lot more like the heir of a massive fortune than an escape convict, precisely the angle his lawyer was working very hard on.
“Mate, I have
“Okay.” He shrugged. “But you know, I’m twelve. I feel like things have time to get serious. I don’t worry about it too much.”
“And the first of November…” Hal eventually spoke again quietly. “That’s when I came to live with them.”
It took Hal a few beats, but he resigned himself to the only conclusion that was obvious.
Hal was not in a good mood. In fact, Hal was just about ready to commit murder. He had
“There’s been odd coincidences.” Hal provided helpfully, turning back to his aunt. “It actually makes perfect sense that it was magic.”
“Hey.” A voice called behind them. “You coming or what? We’re playing Quidditch.”
“What about the Potters?” Hal insisted.
His next words almost made Draco’s heart stop.
“He’s still asleep.” His mother provided, with a knowing smile this time. “It will take a little longer for him, his physical injuries were more serious.”
It was Draco’s turn to look surprised. “How do you know that?”
I just have to undertake the process of proofreading each chapter before posting, I don’t have a beta; this whole instalment is over 60k, and some of it was written many months ago. Also I suppose I may tweak some aspects based on comments and feedback!
“Fair enough.” Snape admitted. “As long as you’ll come to me if anything happens that could get more out of hands?”
“You’re not asking, we are.” Gabriel’s voice intervened behind them, before Anthony could do more than open his mouth (presumably to react to the fact that
“She’s not dead.” Neville reiterated.
“Don’t you want it to come from you?”
“Every time I think about ‘getting over him’, about a possible future when I’m not close to him, I…” He put a hand over his chest. “It hurts.”
After they’d dropped him off again, Hal went straight into the kitchen to check on the cat – though his aunt sternly asked him to go put his things in his room instead of leaving them in the middle of the corridor, so he had to make a quick run back and forth. The little creature looked healthier already, and it trotted up to Hal on the table to nibble at his fingers as he tried to pet him.
“We just found out Lily’s pregnant.” James had said, and looked down at her belly. She was barely showing, but she knew he knew. “She’s only… maybe a month behind you. I know she wishes your parents could have met the baby. I’m sure you do too.”
“What?” Hal reacted with alarm. “What things?”
“Fair enough.” Pan smiled back. “So I have a compromise.”
and had plonked him in a bed telling him he’d have to wait because she was all out of Pepper-Up potion. Hal thought whatever that was didn’t sound very serious, but he assumed it would sort him out quicker than paracetamol when he finally got it, because all the care he received in the meantime was a glass of water and a stern command to stay under the covers.
We went up one chapter in the total count! The last one was running away with me so I split it. Things have not left me with a lot of time to write IRL but I'm almost done with this book - then on to the next one! No rest for the wicked.
“That’s not what I asked.” Draco frowned.
“I find the cold grounding.” He said quietly. “It might help. Just take deep breaths.”
The name of Potter had been spoken with scorn in his household for as long as his father had been alive, and not at all after that. His mother had carefully removed herself from anything she called ‘political’. You know, like the murder of people most of their current acquaintances had called friends.
He allowed a small pause, and silence actually fell as the school waited with bated breath to hear any snippet of ‘official’ information about the whole showdown.
“Because you’re going?” Anthony asked, surprised.
“What?!”
He didn’t want to let go of Draco, the touch of each other’s skin their only lifeline, but he pointed his wand at the young man with his other hand. That only made him laugh, a cold, joyless laugh that echoed in the Chamber.
“I had something to tell you, actually.”
“Such a shame.” Riddle spoke quietly. “It was a great effort, Harry. But you’ll be dead in under a minute.”
It wasn’t much for clarification, but somehow that seemed to be enough for Sev to put the pieces back together and start rushing in the direction Draco had just come from. Draco scurried after him.
Hal had been gutted that he couldn’t make it, but the gift, if not making up for it, had certainly distracted him from the dejection, as had the plan a few days after that that he would visit the Manor and see him soon.
, which was what he’d learnt from his father and circle. Nobody seemed affronted by the question, so Pan considered it a win.
“To be fair.” Ron pointed out. “There was a giant three-headed dog at the door. Maybe the rest was a bit of an afterthought.”
“So I’m going to ask politely.” He carried on. “But a friend of mine gave me another example of how to deal with bullies like you or your brother, if you prefer a different approach?”
“A scapegoat!” Hermione realised.
He was wrong. He was so very, very wrong, and nothing could have prepared him for just how much worse things got in February. More specifically, by the end of the first week, when The Idiot – as they’d taken to referring to the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher – decided the student body needed cheering up, and what better way to do this than a bit of Valentine’s Day spirit.
Hal hadn’t called in weeks, and now he felt like the worst son in the world, as he’d only called thinking of himself, because he needed to hear her voice and feel as close to a hug as he possibly could. He burst into tears.
“I’m a girl.” She proclaimed. “And I am straight. I like boys.”
“Hey, what about me?” Ley piped up. “Maybe I have magic too?”
“You looked scared.” He argued.
When they finally could leave without being rude, having greeted the host, Ron was regretting his life choices. All they had been surrounded by was dead people and rotten food, and he was pretty sure now they had missed the feast.
“Many times.” Severus nodded. “Because you are not. Lucius was…” He shook his head. “Never mind.”
Hagrid explained to them how, when he was himself a Hogwarts student, the events currently unfolding in the school had been happening too – which they already knew from Blaise’s gossip, but somehow getting a first-hand confirmation made them all feel a lot more uncomfortable. And as another student had caught him with ‘Aragog’, he’d believed it was him attacking the student, and Hagrid had been expelled. Incidentally, the attacks had stopped after that, but Dumbledore had never believed Hagrid had been guilty of harming anyone, and had offered him a home and a job on the grounds.
“I thought he was a Pygmy.” Hal pointed out.
“I mean hurting myself.” She told him reassuringly. “Sometimes I honestly just fall. My father’s been teaching me about first aid since I was just a little girl. He always says you practically have to be a Healer before you can reasonably become a Magizoologist.”
“That’s easy for
“Oh.” Hal frowned, surprised. “Really? I mean, I didn’t want them anyway, and I figured Ron’s brothers and sister would need them.”
Hal briefly wondered what it said about him that he saw a big, loving family, with his parents still alive. He guessed at least it said something better than if he had seen himself covered in fame and riches. Which, come to think of it, he already was. Didn’t feel so desirable. Dumbledore continued, stopping his thoughts from spiralling.
It almost surprised him when Anthony brought it up, just as they were getting into bed.
– looking somewhere between surprise, awe and fear.
Pan headed to one of the operators, and showed them the parchment.
“Well, no.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “But we’re not saying just anyone could have taken whatever it was from Gringotts to put it here. It would be something a member of the faculty, probably even Dumbledore himself, wants to keep close.”
Severus was silent for a moment, and when he spoke, he changed the subject – which was as good as an admission that Draco had had the last word on the previous matter.
“What?” She settled on, less than eloquently.
Ever since the fact that he was going to a ghost party had sunk in, since he’d realised he’d be surrounded by hundreds of ghosts (if Nick’s excitement when he talked about it was to be believed), he hadn’t been able to get his father’s words out of his head. He still had the letter, tucked at the back of the frame in which he’d put the moving photo of his parents, on his bedside table.
“Real food.” Lupin chuckled. “Come on. Let’s head down to lunch.”
“I thought you couldn’t escape that prison.” Hal said tonelessly, as if he was forcing himself to focus on something, anything else than the fact this gaunt, crazy looking man on the front page was one of the only links to his dead parents out there.
“No, I suppose not.” She mused, considering. “But then your problem is a huge crush on the Boy-Who-Lived. Very wise choice, as far as being gay goes.”
of gold.”
She’d disappeared back before they could thank her, and so Hal and the girl turned to each other.
“What was that?” Hermione was the first to recover enough to ask, her need for knowledge clearly overcoming any emotions felt in the past few minutes.
He kissed Hal’s lips again, and pushed his lower body even closer. “You into this?” He asked. One of his hands moved from Hal’s hips to his crotch, and pressed down. “You are.” He grinned.
. “I think the DAMSELS can Apparate him to Hogsmead, or he could Floo… I’m sure McGonagall will know. Surely it’s not the first time a student has had a family emergency.”
“I was going to stay at Hogwarts.” Pan said. “But I got an invitation from both Draco’s and Blaise’s mothers, so I’ll spend a week with each.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus had suspected Quirrell would go after the stone, he hadn’t exactly been subtle all year, and it had been a tricky game to play, dealing with this blubbering idiot while being keenly aware that every word he said came back to the Dark Lord’s ears. He had to maintain his cover, do his part as a double agent, while stalling the man. Albus had only given him two instructions: keep an eye on the Potter boy, and don’t let Quirinus get his hands on the stone.
“I never-” Peter stammered. “The Weasley boys have been good to me, I have been a good pet in return, I-”
She pointed to two young boys closest to them, playing quietly together.
He thankfully skirted around his wand, and only took out a few pieces of silver – Draco didn’t really need to have money on him, but his education had ingrained in him that it was good practice to be ready to tip staff or place a friendly bet – and a watch, one of the many watches Draco had, actually, and one he didn’t particularly care for, it just matched his outfit on this occasion – and handed the lot to Flint.
One of the new arrivals was Luna, so they went up to her to see what that had been about. Another girl was crying, and the whole group seemed pretty shaken. Before they could ask Luna, however, one of the older students among the newcomers hopped on a table.
.” Nils argued. “You… you were looking at us.”
Hal wasn’t sure if he should speak to Draco. Pretending nothing had been disclosed seemed wrong, like he didn’t care, which was far from the truth – but at the same time, he couldn’t just casually start mentioning his sexuality and say… what? That he was cool with it, and that he was wondering if he was the same? He didn’t want to make it about himself.
Hal jumped a foot in the air with a yelp, and the… goblin? thing gave him a distressed look.
“Harry-” Dora started, and Draco could tell she was about to launch into something like apologising, or talking about how Black had ended up in Azkaban in the first place, and no, just no,
“That’s great.” Pansy said sarcastically.
He wasn’t provoking him, Hal reasoned to himself. He was simply biding his time, until reinforcement arrived. This has been the point after all, to slow Quirrell down. Even though from here, it looked like he had stalled all by himself.
“Wow, seriously?”
(Draco thought) showing that some of his brain cells were connected. But the damage was already done, and Draco suspected he mirrored the look of surprise he could see on Hal’s face, jaw dropping and eyebrows shooting up.
“And you could have decided not to testify at the trial to spare yourself having to live through it all again.” She continued. “I know it brought back some of the nightmares. It was very brave. So I wanted to say well done.”
“You know, I saw Sirius before Christmas.” He said, and he spotted how Remus’ face lit up a little. “And he said several times how my parents would have been proud of me. I don’t think they would.” He finished wretchedly.
It wasn’t a question, and Pan immediately saw in both adults’ eyes that they understood that. That they understood he was dead serious, and there would be no negotiation. They remained silent for a long moment – Pan expected an explosion, any second now…
“Okay.” She rolled her eyes again. “Okay. We’re friends.”
The next morning, they had gathered enough people for a four-a-side game – one in each position. Fred and George remained as Beaters, and the rest was decided a little haphazardly – Ron and Lee Jordan ended up as Keepers, Draco and Harry as Seekers, and Anthony and a third year Hufflepuff called Rosie who may or may not have been Lee’s girlfriend (the introductions had been a bit jumbled at best) as Chasers.
“Wow.” Anthony reacted. “That’s a big decision.”
“Muggle studies and Care of Creatures.” Neville nodded.
In spite of how drained he had felt, Hal had had a fretful night, and he felt like he’d only finally gotten off to sleep when it was already getting light outside. By the time he woke up again, it was the middle of the day – going by the sunlight through the windows – and his aunt was by his bedside. She lit up when he stirred.
“Think of the Quidditch supply shop.” Anthony offered.
After two dozens of cards – several of which chimed and sung upon opening, and one of which memorably squirted confetti at his face –, four bouquets of red roses, twenty notes saying variations of
“You do?” Hal’s eyes widened. “Because Hermione thinks I’m mental.”
They both got distracted when Hal’s phone vibrated with a text – Hermione, asking him if his aunt liked chocolate, even though Hal had told her repeatedly she didn’t need to bring anything when she visited – and Hal showed the device to Sirius and explained how it worked.
“No.” Hal said sombrely. “They looked worried.”
“She’s got a hero crush on you.” He said like this was absolutely normal. “Don’t worry about it.”
A garden party was a little too casual for full dress robes, but nicely tailored suits certainly made an appearance, as did bespoke dresses on the ladies. The thought of parading in yet another new dress made Pan slightly nauseous, but the idea of a new
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry.” Hermione said gravely. “You can’t just say that.”
“I am willing to help you.” Sev was telling Pansy. “But I want you to come our first.”
“Let’s go flying.” He suggested.
She laughed, but then gave him a serious look.
“But we did it for Colin, too.” The boy added.
At that, Draco became very still, and with all the cold snobbery he knew he could put in his voice, he said very calmly. “So am I.”
“Trust me, I have no interest in your sister.” Draco rolled his eyes. “But you guys
“Do you have options during the summer?” Snape probed.
Hermione scoffed. “Yeah, because that’s not what we’re already doing here.” She rolled her eyes.
Pan dropped sullenly onto a chair, as if she had been the one to get called for a telling off.
“What’s Blaise up to?” He asked.
The train journey was fine, and Hal had no problem finding the Leaky Cauldron. He gave his aunt a quick call, as promised, and with ten minutes to spare, he accepted a hot chocolate from Tom-the-Landlord (“On the house, Harry Potter! It’s an honour!”) and sat down at the bar, waiting for… he thought maybe McGonagall, as his Head of house, or was that something they asked Filch to do?
“It would not have made any difference to how much I love you.”
“You are just like your mother.” She commented. “See that you do not hurt yourself or others, Mister Potter.”
.” Hal was still wired up as well, though his exhaustion was starting to make itself felt.
“Wronski. Feint.” Ron corrected. “It’s a move. A dangerous one, at that.”
She knew Hal had not
“This is going well.” Anthony said sardonically.
“So, do you plan on doing anything about it?” She asked.
Ignoring the question directed to Hal, Lockhart started blabbering happily, and Hal understood he had been expecting this. He had
“No, no, no!” Lockhart’s cheerful, booming voice made them both jump as he was suddenly, somehow,
“Can we sit with you?” Ginny asked.
from Draco, which had an introduction explaining Roald Dahl’s character had been, unbeknownst to the author himself, inspired by a young witch who lived next door when he was a child, and proceeded to tell her (allegedly true) story.
“You will do nothing.” Hal sighed. “Because it was no big deal.”
“I hate you, you Gryffindor heathen.” Anthony said dramatically. “How dare you rob us of this victory!”
other than I was born a Muggle.” She said sharply. “Do not generalise.”
“So what exactly happened before?” Anthony asked, in spite of himself interested in the story even though Blaise was telling it. “I mean, obviously they sorted it out at the time, right?”
What followed was deafening chaos, as all of Gryffindor realised the new point distribution meant they’d won the cup, beating Slytherin for the first time in years. The banners changed colour as Dumbledore clapped his hand, and everyone was still cheering as the food appeared on the tables – but the delicious offerings were enough to soon distract everyone, disappointed Slytherins included, in favour of stuffing their faces.
“I wouldn’t worry too much about her predictions.” He told Hal. “You’re well placed to know, about every day is the end of times according to her.”
He’d launched into raving about waffles and their various toppings until Hal had laughed and forgotten about the trial for a bit.
*             *
Draco cast him a questioning look, which Hal answered by explaining.
Severus stayed silent for a minute, before eventually letting out a sigh.
He tried to crane his neck to see Hal, but his body still felt like lead. It was hard to move.
Draco still wasn’t there.
They all started talking at the same time excitedly, and it took the best part of the next two hours to unravel everyone’s holiday stories.
Although, Draco realised now he thought about it, Hal was catching them up. When he’d met him over the summer, he was this pint-sized firecracker. Now, he seemed to be almost of a height with Draco, who wasn’t small for his age.
! This is exceptional.” He beamed. “Unfortunately of course, the shock and trauma caused you to be a little confused as to what happened. But I am sure you will be very grateful for my heroic actions even if you can’t fully remember them.”
“Harry, come up!” Lockhart did not seem to care about anything else but his little performance. “Let me show you – I won’t hurt you of course, there is nothing to worry about! – let me show you how I defeated the great sorcerer, when, towering over me-”
“Unbelievable.” One of the twins repeated. “The bugger has never played Quidditch in his life, he goes and does a successful Wronski Feint.”
They said goodbye until dinner, and Draco set out towards the dungeons. He didn’t know the password to the common room – no Slytherin in their right mind would share it outside of their House, not that it was an attitude exclusive to them – but he was sure there would be enough comings and going that he could slip in, and most of the students recognised him (from hanging out with Pan and Blaise and the others, or in all likelihood just from being a Malfoy) and wouldn’t kick him out.
Draco had been a little shaken at the sight of Harry’s scar. He hadn’t ever given it much thought – like Ron and every wizard alive, he’d heard the rumours too, but he hadn’t pictured it. He didn’t think he’d have imagined that if he had tried to. Harry – Hal – had called it ugly, and Draco wished he could say otherwise, but… no, it wasn’t pretty. It looked painful, even though Draco suspected a ten year-old scar wouldn’t be, and Harry hadn’t seemed bothered. Well, not by that anyway, because he clearly wasn’t a fan of its aspect.
“Oh, yeah, when I was about… nine?” Draco shuffled, uncomfortable. “I got really, really ill over the winter. It was touch and go for a few weeks… Anyway, I think it was from this point on she became more… detached. Like she didn’t want to care too much about me anymore, in case I was taken from her, like everyone else.”
He had collapsed onto the compartment floor, barely propped up against the edge of the seat. Draco was crouching next to him, his face full of worry, and a second later, a larger hand landed on Hal’s shoulder.
It didn’t seem to deter Hal that on his last game, he had ended up bleeding half to death. Draco was sometimes a little worried at his apparent lack of self-preservation.
“Don’t think I can use these here though.” Hal snatched a galleon – he’d learned the terms and which was which earlier – back from his cousin.
Draco realised he was still wearing the blanket, and hurried to unwrap it from his shoulders and leave it on the back of a chair, making sure to leave the common room and run back to his own quarters before Flint changed his mind about being civil (that had weirdly sounded more like a compliment than a jab, even though it had made Draco’s skin crawl).
Waving his wand (and his entire arm) with exaggerated scope and unnecessary fanfare, Lockhart made Hal’s truck levitate behind them – Hal made sure to hang on tightly to Little Silver’s bed – and pushed them towards the fireplace.
“It’s practically in his blood.” The boy smirked. “Lucius Malfoy was such a proud supporter of the Dark Lord.”
Hermione walked up to the table and caught the boy’s attention, obviously eager to do her part if there was anything she could do to help, and they started discussing if the charms that had been in place the previous year (when all students had to be escorted due to the attacks) could easily be reactivated, and would they reach the professors if they needed to call for backup.
, Hal thought – and thankfully, even in his tired state, did not say out loud. He simply blinked at the professor, unwilling to interrupt.
It was Rolf that slipped through and pushed the door open.
Maybe the reasonable thing would have been to leave it, because he
1. As Pan’s announcement was in a scene from Hal’s point of view, I only switched the pronoun once he himself changed his perception. I hope it wasn’t too confusing.
He’d noticed boys and girls hanging together with no apparent fear of being called gay, something that he didn’t think would happen in the Muggle world, as limited as his experience was in the matter, but he’d not particularly seen a trend towards more Ravenclaws doing that compared to other Houses.
“Oh, alright.” Hal tried to sound casual, but he actually felt like a big weight was lifted off his chest, and that made him realise he’d been more anxious, afraid even, than he’d thought he was. “That’s good. Didn’t really fancy another rodeo in this rain.”
“I’ve not said anything yet.” Sirius pouted.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, hello Draco.” She greeted him pleasantly, as if she hadn’t even noticed.
Hal winced. “Not that great.” He admitted.
It was getting creepier by the minute, and Hal was now pretty convinced he was going to end up in a doll. Or locked in his room and drugged up, which wasn’t much better.
“Love you too, Auntie.”
His friends had been allowed ten minutes, and then the unyielding Matron had insisted only
It came again, and Hal knew for sure he hadn’t imagined it the first time. It was chilling, a barely human whisper, but the words themselves could turn out to be a good thing. If he had a use, he wouldn’t be disposed of as quickly as possible.
“Well, people don’t necessarily know as early as you and me.” She shrugged. “I suppose you’ll find out when he starts showing interest in having
Towards the library, no surprise there.
Keeping an eye on Luna was one of those things. There had been no sign that Millie had gotten anywhere near her since Draco had his words, but she seemed to generally be thought of as an easy target, and Draco couldn’t help but feel a sense of responsibility towards her, since he’d first stood up against one of her bullies. Maybe it said something about himself, too, but he’d rather not dwell on that.
“POTTER!”
“FREEDOM!” Ron shouted with a ridiculous little dance when they were out of their final test.
“Yeah.” Hermione admitted with a sigh. “So we’re no closer to figuring this out.”
“Was it awful?” Anthony asked him worriedly.
to the moving bundle of dragon.
“It was.” Hal found his voice. “Draco and I are just friends.”
of them believed the rumours (which Hal had heard from Fred and George, who loved spreading them with great dramatization around first years) that the job was cursed?
Hal was too stunned to even glare at her, which Draco compensated for as he hissed – it wasn’t even words at this point, but Hal did appreciate the sentiment. It always made him smile when Draco jumped to his defence, especially after their little fallout the previous month. He never wanted to feel like Draco wasn’t on his side again.
“This is amazing.” Hal admired. “Where does it come from?”
The news about Black and Pettigrew had spread through the school like wildfire. Blaise swore he hadn’t told anyone much too vehemently to leave any doubt that he was the source of the ‘leak’, but they didn’t hold it against him – it’d be in the papers soon enough anyway. Draco had written to his mother immediately, thinking it’d be nice for her to hear it from him first rather than from the
“They won’t let us in at this time, with the new curfew.”
“Or Mary Poppins.” Hal piped up.
“Are you nervous about the judgement?” Hal asked him, going back to the other matter tied into Sirius’ announcement.
“Fine.” He sighed. “Keep it to yourself.”
She crossed her arms. She actually crossed her arms, and Hal wanted to roll his eyes, but he burst out laughing instead.
“There’s information.” Hal showed her.
“Was that-”
“Not Hal.” Draco corrected. “Neville.”
“Let’s assume for a moment that You-Know-Who is a descendent of Slytherin.” Hermione exposed. “And, let’s imagine, so are you.”
Two hours in, both of them had managed to get chocolate
Petunia had been making the appropriate soft, comforting sounds as he spoke, but she paused at this.
“No.” Draco snorted. “Absolutely not. I do have some of my dignity left.”
“I’m going to find Flint.” Hal said sharply, and Draco had never heard a tone with less room for negotiation.
“It’s that little wizarding village that’s next to the school.” Dora told them. “From third year, you have Saturdays where you’re allowed to go there, there’s shops, cafés… You should get a permission slip with your letter.”
“Now then, Petunia-”
Hermione glared at him, and at Hal next. “Well, if you are quite done suspecting our
. So what do we do?”
“Guys.” Ron tried to step in.
The decorations for the party were lavish, as expected, and Draco almost rolled his eyes at the unsurprising colour scheme – emerald green and silver. He briefly wondered if his mother would have done the same, had she been hosting, if he’d been sorted into Slytherin. He’d have liked to think she would be more subtle than that. At least there was no chance she would do their house in blue and bronze, when her turn to host came around.
“What?” Hal encouraged her.
Hal couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re shit at this, aren’t you?” He told his friend.
started well for Gryffindor. The team had been absolutely battered in their first game, just after Halloween. According to Ron, the twins were incredibly frustrated, the team’s captain, Oliver, was a nervous wreck, and the new Seeker (a fourth year called Douglas) was a waste of space. Hal wasn’t sure how much of that statement was an objective assessment of the boy’s skill, and how much was due to the fact that another of his brothers, Charlie, had been Seeker in the previous years.
Draco was hardly surprised. The Manor was full of secret passageways, chambers and shortcuts, a lot of which had been the grounds of many an adventure when he was younger. He knew his father had kept some pretty dark stuff hidden from his younger self for safety – or from the law, and probably often both.
As he had taken to do since earlier that summer, Draco did not let any of that show, and poured his feeling into the diary instead.
“Of course, of course.” Fudge nodded gravely. “This is why I am here on official business, you children will be quite safe. Nothing to worry about.”
“Come on then.” He led the way.
Woopsie doops, they went back in time and changed things so Hal never had the realisation he wanted to kiss Draco and officially like him back. Afraid it’ll take him a little longer to get there! But don’t you worry, it is most definitely in the cards. In fact, since I don’t know when I’ll be able to write Book 4, let alone the rest of it, here is a long-term spoiler to soothe your soul in the meantime: they will get married one day. Because neither of them have a father, they will ask their respective godfathers to give them away. There will be wedding planning involved. Sirius and Severus will have to get along. It will be epic.
speak to a snake in front of half the school.
“I was going to say.” Neville gave her an unimpressed look. “You could go by Pan. It sounds cool.”
Hal had gone pale, and silent, and after a moment he took a shaky breath, and Draco realised he wasn’t incredulous, or annoyed, or frightened by Draco’s revelations. He was
He flipped it over before emotion overwhelmed him, and turned to the rest of the box. There was a key, he wondered what it opened, and a letter. With another deep breath, he opened it.
“Secret passageways?” Hal repeated.
“I’d tell you about how advanced this charm is, but I’m sure Remus had explained that to you already. At length. With diagrams.”
“A snake.” She breathed after a moment.
Tom had been very patient with him, considering, and he had helped him admit to himself that what he felt for Hal was not simply friendship. It was too consuming, verging on slightly obsessive, and he certainly didn’t feel this way about any of his other friends.
“She always treated us the same, if that’s what you’re asking.” Hal said. “I think maybe when we were little, before my uncle died, it was a bit different, because he didn’t like me much, but I don’t really remember those years.”
“Yes.” Draco said blankly. “You have the Cloak. Come with me.”
“What happened?” Draco crouched down to help him sit up, since he seemed intent on doing so, surreptitiously checking for any broken bones or open wounds.
In the evenings, the four long tables were replaced with smaller ones where students from any House could study, play, organise clubs such as the chess one… It was perfect for them – Pan’s coming out had catalysed for him and Blaise among the Slytherins, and they spent a lot more time with them now than they did with their housemates, though Blaise was still friendly with Theodore Nott and at least tolerated by the others. Understand: too influential to be dismissed – similarly, they were cordial to Draco, even as they had stopped talking to Pan.
“We weren’t trying to break in.” Draco spoke, and Hal felt grateful, because he was in all likelihood the only one who would be able to appease the man, if anyone could at all. “It was a call for help.”
, which made Ron comment it was no wonder she couldn’t make friends. Anthony told her to ignore him, and proceeded that day with using all the most obscure words he could slot into normal conversation (though the conversation quickly stopped being normal, and at several points in the day Hal couldn’t breathe for laughing too hard).
“He must already have gone back.” Hermione added more gently, repeating it for Draco’s sake.
(Meanwhile, Hermione was using a
“Who’s Caroline?” Hal frowned.
“My condolences.”
“I just thought you should know.” He muttered. “I didn’t want it to… I don’t know, erupt in an awkward way, or at the wrong moment, or someone else telling you, or-”
“Great advice.” Neville retorted drily. “Is that what you’re doing?”
Ron laughed with him. “Yeah, I really am.”
They walked some of the way in companionable silence, until Draco had to take a turn down to the dungeons, and Hal carried on up the stairs to the DADA office.
“Your life is so hard.” Hal teased drily.
Draco waited for him to expand, which he didn’t. He sighed internally, preparing himself for a very long journey indeed. It wasn’t that he disliked Gregory. He was just incredibly dull, and had never shown signs of great intelligence. Draco remembered his father saying the same of Goyle senior, years ago –
“Harry Potter!” He boomed again. “What a delight! What a pleasant coincidence! For two famous wizards such as ourselves to meet!”
“It’s a him.” Ley pouted. “And we’ll name him, and he can be our cat.”
It was lunchtime, now, or at least it would be once this hour was actually up, so they wouldn’t need to go to their next class for a little while longer. And he had time to find Minerva and the other professors, in the meantime, to inform them of what had happened.
“I heard Professor McGonagall tell Professor Sprout over lunch. He’s been called away on business.”
.” The guy on the table went on. “We just need to stay here, they’re clearing the corridors.”
“It’s only first year exams, ‘Mione.” Ron moaned from where he was sprawled on the other side of the table. They were studying in the Ravenclaw common room, which was
Whispers ran across the hall, and Hal looked down at the table as he could see several heads turning towards him. It wasn’t hard to guess what the ‘events’ could possibly be.
Draco would even say Hal had become too quiet, often withdrawn and almost gloomy. He found him outside one Saturday only a couple of days to the end of the month, on the banks of the Black Lake, and he sat down beside him in spite of the cold, pulling his scarf tight around his neck.
“Pansy had something to ask you.” Draco dumped her right in it. “If you have a moment to talk?”
She had a shocked look on her face, her hand stretched out as if she’d been holding something in front of her face. Anthony spotted a round pocket mirror on the bedside table, and when he tried, it fit perfectly between her frozen fingers.
“Honey, it will be very cold.” His mother tried to temper his enthusiasm.
They’d split up for a bit to get Christmas presents for each other and their friends, wanting to keep it a surprise, and Hal had also grabbed some gifts for his aunt (bath bombs that made the entire bathroom look like a planetarium, and a shawl that kept you warm in cold temperatures and pleasantly cool when it was warmer) and for Ley (a selection of wizard sweets, and fireworks that created different flying or galloping animals – though he wasn’t sure how they would get around to using those).
Draco had looked into the steely grey-blue eyes of the little cat, and strangely the first thing that popped to his mind was that if he decided one day to become an Animagus (McGonagall’s little stint at the beginning of the year always had effect on many a first year), he’d be a cat.
“No.” Hal argued. “
Hal took a tentative bite, and was surprised to find warmth flooding his limbs again, clearing the fog in his thoughts. He eagerly ate more, and he could see his friends doing the same.
“Is just a friend.” Hal completed, rolling his eyes.
“He’s my cousin.” Hal corrected. “And yeah, there were like five Harry’s in our year group a few years ago so him and our friends started calling me Hal, and it worked really well because of the comet.”
His legs locked and he fell forward, tried to spin and landed hard on his shoulder and the side of his face.
“He’s carried a torch for the new Seeker since second year.” Fred informed Hal at the end of one training session.
“Don’t get cocky.” Hermione slipped in.
“I guess she told you what happened, then.” He said sullenly.
“Not the same?” Draco cut him off, still in a chilling tone. But he saw the flash of regret and affection in Severus’ eyes, and he softened. “How many times have you told me I’m nothing like my father?”
“You know, the worst part about all this?” Ley commented. “Is I can’t tell anyone about this. I can’t boast to my friends that my cousin is a
.” She said forcefully, dragging her classmate off with her.
Mostly he told them about Draco and Anthony, about Ron and Neville, about Hermione – Ley, obviously, asked him if he liked her, and he just punched her in the arm – and about the Weasley twins and their friends and their little Quidditch games.
“You have become very protective of the boy, Severus.” Dumbledore noted.
Part of her was really proud of them for standing up to the bully, but she couldn’t commend Hal on his reaction.
After two days of steady, heavy rain – they had baked, played games, read books and watched TV, and it had been equally lovely – they finally woke up to glorious sunshine.
“Indeed, Mister Potter.” A much boomier voice sounded. “It is almost a shame.”
Then, suddenly with complete clarity, Hal knew what, or rather who, was in front of him.
“Oh, hi.”
“3e sexe” is a rather progressive song from 1985 and there’s a new version Nicola Sirkis (the Indochine singer) made with Christine and the Queens which startled me at first then really grew on me, I think it’s great :)
“Is the House you’re sorted into really that important?”
“I have a feeling.” Hermione piped up with a sigh. “That it’s all going to be stories about their many mischiefs.”
And Anthony, after going through most of his holidays enjoying some family time and inventing crazy worlds and games playing with his little sister who, at four years old, missed him dearly and still couldn’t understand why he wasn’t there for most of the year, and needed to be reassured it was not in any way because he didn’t love her to bits, had spent Christmas with the Scamanders, which led them to their next topic of conversation.
Also, this comes up in this chapter and I made a note about it in Book 1 already but just as a reminder, I know in cannon James’ parents are still around to see him get married, but I’ve got my own headcannon timeline that they died in his seventh year which partly accounted for his personality change, and made Lily see there was more to him than an obnoxious brat.
“Don’t move.” Neville suddenly said.
“I don’t know what to say.” Pan admitted.
“Sev.” Draco interrupted sharply. “Hal is
“Did you agree to them doing that?” He wondered.
He broke eye contact, looking down and shuffling some dried bird droppings and feathers with his foot.

Suddenly possessed by his inner Ronald Weasley, Draco changed tactics and punched him on the upper arm. He almost laughed out loud at the look of outrage on Hal’s face as he turned to him, mouth open, cradling his shoulder.
“For a remarkable game of chess with extremely high stakes, and for putting himself in the front line rather than his friends, fifty points to Ronald Weasley.”
“I suppose she is known to have made one actual prophecy.” Lupin mused, surprising Hal somewhat, but he didn’t get a chance to ask as Lupin placed a hand on his shoulder. “I’ll mention it to the Headmaster.” He committed as if to put Hal’s mind at rest. “Shall we get started?”
, five boxes of chocolate, a bottle of… something sparkly, which may or may not have contained alcohol, which was just wrong regardless, all delivered by sulky dwarves, Hal had lost count, and was very much beyond fed up.
But he did hear, and he turned thoughtful grey eyes to him.
“Yeah…”
“They’re not that common.” Rolf let out as she paused for breath for more than half a second.
“I’ll go.” Anthony said with determination. “Distract it.”
“I was just trying to tell Hal…” Sirius started.
“He’s also
“Snake!” Hal cried out, jumping off the bed and startling everyone. “I bumped into those two Hufflepuffs and we talked about the Duelling club, and the snakes – she – it’s a snake!”
She dropped the paper on the table, and Draco saw the moment it happened. Lockhart
His father looked over the Daily Prophet, one eyebrow raised.
“Yeah.” Sirius nodded. “What-”
Now that Hermione mentioned it, Hal realised he
“It’s mostly you.” The boy said. “Colin mentioned you wanted to show your family. But he thought he’d start with one of your parents, because… well, he wouldn’t exist without them, you know?”
An older girl on a nearby table shushed them, and they spent the next few minutes in silence again.
“Why not?” Pan insisted.
She shrugged nonchalantly, once again affecting a careless demeanour. Severus seemed to be satisfied enough, as he nodded solemnly.
, making this whole thing a publicity stunt. No wonder he had bloody volunteered.
“What?”
“You are not what I expected, Harry Potter.”
It seemed to pull Hal out of the state he was in, and he jumped to his feet, even as Dora was assuring the man they were fine.
“You have no idea.” Hal snorted.
Another chunky one for you, with more headcannons/world building of my own.
“Isn’t that a bit cruel if she’s in love with you?” Draco wondered.
The next days passed in a bit of a haze, and before they knew it, it was the end of year feast. The Great Hall was in Slytherin colours, their House having come top of the ranking in spite of Gryffindor winning the Quidditch; but when Dumbledore got up (which everyone accepted with a repressed sigh, hoping the speech would be quick and the food on the table soon), instead of offering customary congratulations, he surprised everyone by saying:
Hal almost shouted, but the man spun around as he entered, and snarled before Hal could speak.
their favourite cake – which Ron told him changed every year, and obviously they claimed it was never the same between them.
“Yeah.” He smiled back. “I’m Draco, by the way.”
Hal snorted. “Yeah, I’m not sure how I feel about the
He remained silent for a few minutes, long enough that Draco started to wonder if he should suggest they go back to the party, but just as he opened his mouth to do so, Hal spoke again.
“I’m sorry.” He hiccupped. “I am so sorry.”
Draco had not particularly been looking forward to going to Hogwarts before. He liked teaching himself from the books in his family’s extensive library. His mother often took him on her visits to other families, so Draco knew most of his future classmates already. Some of them were alright, but Draco felt like seeing them every now and again was enough – he had not made close friends out of any of them, though he’d been told many times this tended to happen easily within your house at school.
“Have a great time, darling. Be good, learn a lot. Don’t forget to write.”
“Can I show you something?” He asked his cousin.
to the most evil wizard in recent history?” Hal picked out, horrified.
