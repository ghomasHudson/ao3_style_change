Harry had gone pink and tried to reiterate the point. “It never came up, no. I mean, sure, we talked about our fantasies, and she did tell me that she likes both men and women, but we never discussed what it might be like to have a threesome.”
Their next argument was the thorniest yet. It involved telling Draco’s mother about him and Harry.
“Try not to think of him as famous, Mr. Malfoy. Try to think of him how he would like to be.”
Hermione shook her head. “No, then you won’t be able to explain the dittany, the potion or the magical bandage. I’ll tell you what, I bet Ginny has connections. Her team gets injured all the time, they have their own personal squad of Mediwizards on call.” She sighed and brushed Harry’s hair aside as she wrapped gauze around his head several times before securing it with a spell. “Honestly, it’s at times like this that I wish the two of you were still together.”
“D’you mean that?” Draco’s mouth was set at a vulnerable angle, and Harry bent in to kiss it.
Draco snorted. “I think my days of milk-drinking are over, Potter, unless I’m pouring it in my tea. But not to worry, I brought something with me.”
Draco was still smoldering with discontent, and Harry braced himself for unpleasantness, but to his surprise, Draco put one of his hands over Harry’s. His grip was warm, gentle with a touch of firmness, as if he wouldn’t let go if Harry tried to pull away.
“See you tomorrow, Draco. And thanks for the tea.”
Draco shrugged and pulled up a pen and paper, which Harry took. His writing was little better than a scrawl, but it was readable, and that was what mattered.
The prospect both terrified and elated him, which was why he found himself dragging his feet when it was finally time to meet Draco outside the museum. He tried on all of his new clothing before settling on a cream-colored v-neck jumper over a cobalt blue shirt, then Apparated to Bankside. The weather was bright but chilly as he ran across the street to the museum, narrowly avoiding being run over by a tour bus.
Hermione tossed back her hair, unsure as to whether he could be believed. “I already applied some Wound-Cleaning Potion of my own, thanks. I’m not sure if a Draught of Peace is a good idea yet, he might be a little concussed.”
” His tone was scornful. “Is that your new nickname for me? If I’d known that would happen, I wouldn’t have mentioned my Muggle alias earlier.”
They did indeed have an entire section devoted to such works, and Draco led them to it, engaging in small talk with Ginny along the way. “How did the frock work out for you, any comments on it from the press?”
Draco inclined his head in agreement. “What do you know, maybe there’s something to be said for this friendship deal. Now that we are – you know – friends.” He could have cursed himself for how inane he sounded, but Harry didn’t seem to mind, in fact he was smiling.
The slight nod she gave him was not a guarantee of secrecy, but it would have to do.
The kisses moved on, from nipples to solar plexus down to the crest of his hipbones and the space below his navel, all while working his fingers on Harry both front and back. Harry had entered into a space of absolute bliss, all but forgetting that he was blindfolded as he coasted the waves that Draco brought forth with hands and mouth. The climax was upon him before he knew it, thundering through his body like a captive creature released from its pen. Harry cried out from it, his body bucking a little in Draco’s grasp.
As he switched records, he explained further. “The lyrics remind me a bit of you, they even mention your name.”
Fortunately, his wand buzzed at him, and he was able to pause the game on the pretext of answering his phone. Away from prying Muggle eyes, he took out his wand from his jeans and activated the com-spell built into it. Hermione’s face, surrounded by a shimmering green aureole, bloomed before him, and he felt a familiar inner tug of relief at seeing her.
I realize that I completely glossed over the fact that Harry Disapparated in full view of a group of Muggles. Let’s just say that in my version of the Potterverse, Wizards who are of age and don’t have Traces on them are a little more at liberty to misbehave without consequences...
They could, and they did. The morning finished in a torrid haze, and they eventually collapsed onto the bed with their clothing mostly undone and Draco’s newly conjured glasses askew on his nose. The tie was long gone.
Harry seemed to understand what Draco was thinking, and placed one hand on his leg in a comforting sort of gesture. It didn’t go unnoticed by Ron, but aided by liquor, he had grown less disturbed by any signs of affection between them, and carried on with listing Hermione’s accomplishments since she had joined the Ministry.
The stranger didn’t seem disappointed, but removed their arm from Harry’s shoulder, and threaded it through his left arm instead, smiling gently. “Why don’t you come with me then, and I can show you the sights. No strings attached, just wanting to help a newcomer out.”
“Can’t we just order out?”
It was a blessing that she picked up after a few minutes. “Hermione,” he gasped, “I need help, I’ve been Splinched.”
do - I mean, what is he doing
Harry’s hand drew away and touched his lips, still wet from Draco’s attention. “I – I’d better go. When can I see you again?”
Dinner was finally served, and Draco was impressed yet again. “Hermione, this is amazing,” he pronounced, after taking his first bite of Moroccan tagine over couscous. “You and Harry must have the same fairy godmother, to have such culinary talent bestowed upon you.”
“Actually, I’d like to take the Tube with you. Show you how it works properly so you can use it yourself, rather than relying on your Muggle posse. Not that there’s anything wrong with relying on others.” Harry felt his foot plant itself firmly in his mouth for what seemed like the nineteenth time. “You know what I mean, right?”
Harry was stirring the puttanesca sauce when he heard a knock at the door. Casting a quick safety charm to keep the temperature consistent and the spoon stirring, he wiped his hands nervously and went to open the door. “Come on in, Malf – sorry, Draco.”
“Berk,” he muttered, before pulling Harry in for one last kiss.
Harry protested, but everyone in the room was in agreement on one thing – no travel, magical or otherwise, for him. Which was how Draco ended up staying with Harry while the two medics were led on by Hermione in the final search for Harry’s ear. She hugged Harry before leaving, and whispered fiercely in his good ear, “I expect a
Ron picks up the invitation again and his shoulders slump. “Urgh,” he says, only half-flippant, “It’s bad enough that you’re dating the ferret, now we have to put up with his parents too?”
“That might not be a bad thing,” Narcissa hums, patting Lucius on the shoulder. She crosses the room to Draco and opens her arms – mechanically he steps into them, lets her hug him. “I’m glad you told us before anything formal with Miss Parkinson was announced. Does she know, darling?”
“Darling,” Narcissa says, in a tone of voice that implies she terribly resents his lack of faith in them, “why would we
experience of my entire life.”
“Yeah. It’s weird. They’ve changed so much from how I remember them. But I do.”
! I’ve heard so much about you, young man.”
“Don’t ask,” Cho says and turns away. Draco takes Harry’s hand and they begin to wander through the party, smiling, saying hi, but not really stopping to chat until they end up on the terrace, sinking into chairs and watching the knots of people laughing and chatting. Draco sees Pansy re-appear briefly looking like the cat that got the cream and then disappear again with Ginny Weasley in tow, bafflingly. He sees the others Weasleys relaxing, spread out and chatting away. Hermione and Ron have their arms around each other talking to Mr and Mrs Nott and the eldest Shafiq son. He sees his parents, glowing, moving around their guests with shoulder claps and kisses on cheeks and supernova-bright smiles.
“Ah yes,” Robards nods, “congratulations on acceding to the Malfoy dynasty, Potter. My wife and I are looking forward to the party.”
“Please keep your sex life to yourself,” Pansy groans. “Don’t want to hear it.”
“How do you even know about that,” he asks his father, and then turns to them, “Stephen, Cho, hi, it’s lovely to see you here.”
is dating Draco and I know for a fact that Draco tided his wardrobe extensively,” Pansy sniffs. “Much as I love Hermione, she is also not commonly known for her sartorial taste.”
“I had a sudden horrifying flashback to that ball in fourth year,” Pansy shudders delicately. “It’s a terrible shame I care about your pride, Ronald.”
The box was very simple, long enough to contain a wand, and that was it. Harry opened it to see as expected a piece of paper. It read "Isobel Circe Riddle". Under it was a wand. Not his wand, though.
"Mr Weasley found you in Hogsmeade a month ago. You were in a coma. There was only this with you." He gave Harry a box. "You may open it" he answered the silent question. "There is a paper, with what we assumed was your name, and a wand, probably yours."
"Pompom, would you allow this young person to leave the bed? I would rather talk with this young person in my office."
"This is not my wand, professor."
"Believe me, any other house would've been a waste for you. You'll thank me later."
'Like this.'
Harry was afraid. That is the least he could say at the moment. He had lost track of the time but guessed he had been there for at least one month. Maybe more. It didn't feel like less than a month to him. If it had indeed been less than a month, these were the longest weeks of his life. Well, maybe not the longest ones, but still quite long. Some weeks at the Dursleys' had been really long after all.
"Excuse me? Professor?"
Harry recognised the hospital wing. He was back at Hogwarts. And the voice was Ron's. He blinked, and looked at his friend. His best friend! Harry smiled.
Speaking of whom, the snakelike face entered the room. As expected, he talked. It wasn't going to be a simple 'Avada Kedavra' and everything is over, of course.
"Okay, you good?"
Harry waited a short time for her to return. It was long enough for him to realise he didn't have his glasses, and yet he could see. Did they finally think to get his vision right thanks to magic? Why do it now, why not in his first year? They should do it to everybody if they could. To see right at anytime, without needing any item, was a gift! To think most people just lived this way. People do not realise their luck most of the time, really.
Tomorrow he would have to go back to class, as if nothing had happened. As Isobel Riddle. How lost would he be, after missing two months? Maybe he would not be that lost, compared to usual. It would work. He had never been the best student, but he'd never been the worst either. Except this time he wouldn't have Hermione's help to catch on. It was weird to realise Ron was the one to be friendly. Ron who was the first one to say a Slytherin was the worst, and he'd trusted a girl called Riddle? Like Voldemort? The worst of all? Maybe now that he'd been sorted in the Slytherin house, Ron would not trust him anymore. Well, Isobel had been sorted in Slytherin, it was Isobel Ron would not trust anymore. Ron would always trust Harry, if only he knew Harry was right there... Harry turned over in his bed. It would probably be easier to lie about his real identity if Ron did not talk to him-Isobel after all.
That made sense. Harry nodded and took the wand. The feeling was unusual, but not disagreeable. He moved it, murmuring "Lumos", and the end of the wand cast a light. He turned it off, with a sad smile.
Harry opened his mouth, and then closed it again. He had been so happy to see his best friend again, only to be told he would be a stranger to him now. And to his other best friend, and everyone else. Great! Fantastic! But Dumbledore knew what he was doing, surely.
"It's working."
Harry hummed in agreement. He would not mind it.
For a month - or what he believed had been a month, - he had lived in a bedroom with a few very boring books at first glance, nothing to play with, and no contact with the outside. Not even a window to watch the sky through. Nothing to track time with. There was light during the day, or so he hoped, and the light progressively turned to dark when night was supposed to happen. If he had known it would last this long, he might have tried to count the days, but when he realised it was going to last more than a few days, it was too late. He was already unsure of how many days had passed. And then he just lost track. He resorted to reading the books. They were as boring as he had thought; but when it is the only distraction from one's thoughts... At least, he thought at some point, when he'd go back to Hogwarts, he would be able to surprise some teacher with his new knowledge. Maybe he would even get better in potions! What boredom could do to a man.
'None at all! It's good. I was just thinking I should make you discover more wizarding songs.'
"Voldemort kidnapped me, but you know that, right? I saw Ron, so he must have told you. Is Hermione alright? I don't know what happened to her." No answer came, so he resumed. "He kept me a prisoner in a sort of manor, and he told me loads about his army. I- I don't remember everything though. And then the last thing I remember, they made me go in a dark room, drink a potion, and there were spells. I don't know what they did, and I didn't have my wand. I don't know."
He took a second to feel his body, moving a bit, but nothing hurt.
"Yeah, hun-" he paused to cough, his throat felt weird, and his voice was not right. "Hungry."
'Agreed.'
A feeble of voice. Quiet, at first, becoming more and more audible as the voice spoke. Harry was waking up. Who did this voice belong to? He was still not awake enough for that. He was in a bed, comfortable, safe. Or was he? His last memories came back to him. Voldemort. The Death Eaters. The potion and the incantations. He jolted awake. Arms went near him, and the voice said "Oh wow, you're awake! Wait, stay there, relax!".
Two days later, on a Monday evening, Harry dressed up in his new clothes. In Isobel's clothes. In less than an hour, he would go to the Great Hall, sit on the stool, and have the Sorting Hat on his head for the third time. He had had time to think about this, and had come to the conclusion that hiding his real identity would be easier if he wasn't in Gryffindor. Of course, convincing the Sorting Hat that his place was in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw would not be an easy task, but he had managed to escape Slytherin last time; hadn't he?
"What happened, Harry?" the headmaster asked after having offered a sweet, which Harry had politely refused.
"Please not Sly-"
'Maybe we could escape.'
'Let's call it a day. I don't want to think about this damn wardrobe another second.'
'What?'
'As long as I'm with you, everything's possible, Mr Avada Kedavra Cannot Kill Me.'
Dumbledore remained silent for a little while. Harry kept avoiding his eyes. Something felt wrong. He had been scared of Dumbledore in the past, but he'd always trusted him, in the end. Except now, this feeling in his eyes... Dumbledore seemed the same as ever, mysterious, knowing more than everyone else, but Harry couldn't trust him as much as he used to. Something was off.
'I sometimes think it would all have been easier if we had been Muggles,' he sighed.
"That's it?"
Ron opened his mouth but closed it just as quickly. He shrugged and waged goodbye before leaving.
"I cannot allow you to tell your friends."
About a week before, Voldemort had done him the honour of coming to see him. He had even invited Harry to walk about out of his room. Then he had told him all about the Death Eaters, the names, the oldest ones, the more recent ones, their motivation, why they were Death Eaters, what position they held. Harry did not remember everything. He remembered some names, some faces, that was well enough. After all, what use could he make of all this intelligence if he never got out of there? He didn't even know why Voldemort had shared this knowledge. Maybe his plan was just to kill him afterwards, like all the villains in those muggle films, who explain their evil plan to the hero before trying to destroy them. Except Harry had seemingly no way to escape, he was no James Bond. Sure, he'd survived some very dangerous events, but it was nothing like that. To begin with, he had his wand, last times. And help, in some way or another. Or a portkey. He couldn't see why Voldemort would tell him everything and then free him. That made no sense.
He knew he had been kidnapped early October. It was the first day that yeard they went to Hogsmeade. He was with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny, but Ginny had drifted away to spend the day with her own friends. He was glad she did so before the Death Eaters had come. That was one person less to worry about, as he wasn't sure what had happened to Hermione and Ron. They were all facing Death Eaters in a small street when someone had grabbed him from behind. Next thing he knew, he'd disapparated, and then apparated in a new place. Before he could defend himself, he'd been disarmed by someone he hadn't had time to see. Apart from this, he couldn't say he'd been badly treated: he had had food, and a comfortable enough bed in a big enough bedroom. No, really, he didn't have much to complain about, if it wasn't for the fact he was kidnapped by Voldemort and did not know what had happened to his friends or what exactly was awaiting him.

His warm breath fanned out across my face, and I closed my eyes. “Yes…” I give a tiny sigh. “Do I have to? Why can’t I just spend Christmas here at Hogwarts?” Harry just shook his head a bit, and then replied, “You always spend Christmas with your parents. How would they react if you said, “Hey Mom and Dad, I want to spend Christmas at Hogwarts for the first time ever because I’m dating Harry Potter. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. The fact that I’m gay as fuck
Harry was done with all of this. With all of the feelings. With all of the hurt.
Harry’s pouring himself into Draco, more than I thought was possible. I keep waiting for him to pass out, but he doesn’t. The wounds are closing up slowly, more slowly than I’d like.
I picked up my wand, and then pointed it at my fork. It was difficult, but I managed to summon it.
How are they going to find one!
I was determined now.
I said, and then a burst of white light shot out of my hand. The door shot open, and I fell over. When I looked at Hermione, she was on her butt, staring at me, her mouth wide open.
I’m just upset.
"Don't. Just
“I tried, ‘Mione, and your healing charms are much better than mine-”
"Shh, it's okay, darling. It will all be fine." I coo, trying to make him feel better.
“That’s exactly what we’re going to do.” She responds with a sigh.
This was one of the nice things about being a Slytherin. (Thank Merlin that Salazar Slytherin believed in girls each having their own bathroom...) All girls had their own bathroom.
Of course, the first thing I noticed was the cold bed, hopeless fuck that I am. I panic a bit, drawing in a breath, and then slowly the memory of last night came back to me.
Draco walked out of the showers, feeling dazed.
Hermione's face fell a bit.
-----------
“So would I, ‘Mione. You have my word.”
When Harry had made it halfway to Malfoy, he shouted, "WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU,
Harry's the fucking Chosen One. He's the one who'll destroy Voldemort. Who will put all of the Death Eaters in Azkaban, or kill them.
He walked quickly to the portrait hole, and then after that to his dorm. He fumbled around, knocking things over, trying to find his knife.
Shoulda just died.
“‘Kay, ‘Mione”
Harry will have to kill me.
What I really want is for Harry to come in and wrap his arms around me, smooth back my hair, and for him to tell me it's all going to be ok, that he loves me, that he'll never leave me.
Maybe I can feel better about this.
(Medication, pregnancy tests, bond issues, presentation tests, etc.)
he said to himself. Again, not half bad. She'd probably be nice in bed.
She tuts, and then grabs a vile, not saying anything. I suppose she wouldn't have to, she's already figured out what's all wrong with me, I suppose. She pushes it to my lips, and I gulp down the icey liquid quickly, the taste horrible, but I know what this is. It's a pain-relieving potion, and I couldn't want one more at the moment.
“We should probably go to DADA… ugh, I don’t think I can deal with Snape right now.” Hermione said. Pansy held on tighter, and Hermione started to remove herself. Pansy just whimpered, and she held on tighter. Hermione just gave into her, sighing, and said, “If Snape asks, I’m out sick. Bad cramps.” I nod, and then sigh. Girls can
I wake the next morning to a pile of presents stacked at the end of the bed. I stare at them, willing them to be things that mean something to me, instead of the fucking expensive garbage I always get. I remember Harry telling me about the normal presents that he gets, and they're things like chocolate frogs, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, fudge, socks, and books. And his personal favorite has always been his Weasley sweater. He wears it every chance he gets, I swear.
I read a line that says something about how you have to have be sound in the head to have a good life. This is not helpful. I nudge Blaise, and mutter "Have you found anything yet?" I glance over at his book, and his chapter is titled
I will answer all of your comments when I get back, so sorry to those who are waiting. All comments are appreciated! They keep this story going!
THIS IS THE UPDATED VERSION OF THE FIRST CHAPTER.
I lay back down on my bed, sighing. I really don't want to open the gift from Harry, but at the same time I want to. It just makes it
I'm going to beat the crap out of that fucker." Harry stood up, his head whipping around, looking for the blonde-headed boy.
"Go to fucking hell, you bitchy fucking ferret," Hermione said, and her voice was like liquid nitrogen, and then she helped the ginger pull Harry's shaking form out of the Great Hall. The Hall was dead quiet, no one was moving. Not even the teachers. (You'd think they'd been Confunded.) It stayed this way for a bit, and then Ginny stood up. She walked over to Draco, and then kneed him in the balls. He fell to the ground, pulling his knees into his chest and wrapping his arms around them.
The mirror was steaming up, and the air was nice and warm. I striped slowly, put my clothes on the counter, and then eased myself into the warm water.
time. You are special, Draco. I believe you are ready. Or, of course, if you refuse, I will kill you. So, I suppose it's this or death... Or I suppose your parents would satisfy my need to kill, too. Your choice, Draco."
Sobbing my eyes out as I wrote this... REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW!
I've gotten a bit better. I've gotten to the point where I can eat a bit, sleep a bit. No more than two hours, though. Mostly a mix between nightmares, memories, (Mostly of being deflowered) and, well, just Harry. Mostly nightmares that involve Harry, though. Fuck.
A house elf comes into my room.
Literally.
Or not so strange...) to give him a hug. And to- well, do some
I just want to end it at this point.
YAYAYYAYAYAYYAYAYYAY! *finally, it happened guys, it happened.* I’ve had this chapter planned since the beginning of the fic, so IT HAPPENED GUYS, IT HAPPENED!
no. This just keeps getting worse and worse.” Blaise nodded slowly, and then replied, “What are we going to tell the Golden Trio?” I sigh, throwing myself down next to Blaise dramatically.
I've been thinking about how I'm going to break up with him. I don't want to come back and kiss him, make him think things are fine. But I don't want to break up with him the second I see him. So... I could... I could...
There's no debating the fact that she responded immediately, and with passion, too.
Harry says exactly what I’m thinking.
I listened to the song Home, by Cavetown the whole time I wrote this chapter, so go check it out, it’s a great song. (Sad, though.)
I say quickly.
Of course, he had found scents that were quite pleasant, so pleasant that he wanked off to them, and he knew that if he didn’t ever find the right scent, he could easily be happy with these people. They were always a back-up option.
FOR ALL PURPOSES DRACO IS STILL ON THE QUIDDITCH TEAM. ALSO, DRACO WAS NEVER ASSIGNED THE TASK OF KILLING DUMBLEDORE. OKAY? Okay.
“Morning,” he replied, reaching automatically for his glasses. “Fancy seeing you here.”
“You’re excused,” Draco might have muttered, but she was already gone.
Draco looked away from Harry, toward the door. “They’ve been gone a while. Maybe you should spell Hermione first to be sure they haven’t gotten lost or anything.”
, which, I’ll remind you, is not something I’m used to doing with someone who has – “
Harry appeared to be counting to ten again. “Draco, I don’t feel comfortable with those types of questions, in fact I’ve been actively avoiding them for the past several months. Don’t you think you could – I dunno, tell Nigel I’m traveling incognito right now, or something?”
“It’s simply not up to us to govern the Muggle world for them,” Draco insisted. “I may have given up on my family’s Pureblood views about interbreeding and taken an interest in the course of Muggle history, but I still don’t think that means we have to take responsibility for how they run their lives.”
unique, Draco thought to himself. “The fame might have gotten to him when he was younger, but I don’t think he feels the same way about it now.”
“I’m sorry,
“I wish my parents could see him that way.”
They had amassed a healthy pile of clothes for Harry to try on, and were on their way to the dressing rooms when they ran into a small gaggle of young women. One of them looked at Harry, and her eyes lit up in recognition. Harry felt the bottom of his stomach lurch unpleasantly, but it was too late to dodge her gaze.
Harry realized his mistake too late, but it felt beyond awkward to explain to a generous stranger that he was on the wagon, and really, the thought of having a drink while he and Draco were on the outs was so very tempting. Surely one beer wouldn’t make too much difference, not like the Ogden’s he practically swam in during the nadir of his partying days. Besides, Draco was probably out drinking himself right now, looking for his next Muggle boy toy to take home.
Grabbing his shoes in one hand, Draco made the climb, with Harry close behind. It was but the work of a moment to put on his own shoes and help Draco upwards through the skylight before lifting himself through and reaching down to collect his beloved broom.
Potter whistled. “Blimey, I’d forgotten. But yeah, I do remember seeing something about it in the papers.” He paused a bit too long. “I just didn’t know it would be so close by.”
he thought to himself, but she didn’t need to know every gory detail.
Harry’s response was to close the distance and pull Draco into a long kiss. They fetched up against the wall, Draco’s arms providing support while his hands entwined themselves into Harry’s hair, the messiness of which no longer bothered him in the least. If he didn’t know better, he might think that he was falling in love with the Boy Who Lived.
Since then, he hadn’t had much luck in finding anyone new, despite the not-so-subtle hints from his friends that he ought to move on. He had reached out to Brandon, the American he’d met at the gay pub in Camden Town, but that had fizzled after only a few dates. Following some trial and mostly error in online dating, the only chance he felt he had at starting anything resembling a proper relationship was through work, which had become like a second home to him. He liked his co-workers well enough, but none of them at the moment had the allure he was looking for.
“Don’t worry, I’ll pay for it,” Draco reassured him.
Shaking off the conflicting mental images, Harry searched through the robes by hand, feeling the pockets for any telltale stiffness. He found it in a set of deep purple robes, and drew out the wand with relief.
“That’s wonderful, as long as you’re being safe about it.” Harry wasn’t going to ask for more information, but she gave it to him anyway. “There should be all sorts of spells for protection against disease, not to mention charms for lubricating, stimulating, massaging... I can find you a book on it if you want.”
When Harry went back to Bedknobs and Broomsticks Book Emporium the following afternoon, he was disappointed to see that Malfoy wasn’t there. He dithered about for twenty minutes before deciding to buy the book on Quidditch, and chanced a question of the clerk who helped him buy it.
“Hey, Ginny.” Harry had returned, with a glass in each hand. He gave one to Draco before leaning in to kiss her on the cheek. “Looking good, as always.”
“Let’s – not. Talk about it. Right now. I’m not saying never, but honestly I could use a break from thinking about anything Draco-related.”
“All right, good. Next step, getting to the roof.”
Morning was heralded by a sustained staccato of knocking at the front door, and Draco stumbled blearily downstairs in his purple velvet bathrobe to answer it. Philippe was on the doorstop, along with a squadron of stylists, and Draco remembered in a rush of adrenaline that today was the day of the Christmas Ball.
“Is that a yes to going then?” Draco’s tone was soft.
“This Patronus thing. What if I taught you how to cast one, so we can find out for once and for all what form it would take? Plus of course it would be helpful for communication, or if you ever run into Dementors, once you can do magic again in public.”
Draco did not seem convinced. “We are here for your aesthetic improvement, not for some fangirl distraction.” He steered Harry toward the clerk guarding the men’s dressing rooms. “We don’t have a moment to waste.”
Before Harry could attempt to engage her in conversation, Draco emerged from the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel. He had the grace to look a little embarrassed when Hermione laid eyes on him, although not as embarrassed as she did. “Morning Granger. Excuse me while I – “ The rest of the sentence was lost as he darted into the bedroom and shut the door.
“Hiya Harry.” Ron appeared in the row behind them and plopped himself down in an empty seat. “Sorry I’m late, I had to walk Ginny through some last-minute stuff.” He looked around cautiously and leaned in to whisper, “She’s having a bit of a meltdown, to be honest.”
In which everything is wrapped up and tied in a neat little bow…OR IS IT?
“Adorable? Draco, I was a mess.”
Harry boggled to himself.
Luna nodded and produced a tape recorder from thin air, fixing her large blue eyes on Harry’s face as they began moving toward the building entrance, which still felt a long way off to Draco. Her first question was all but lost in the roar of the crowd that had increased exponentially at the arrival of another guest behind them. Draco, distracted, craned his neck behind to see who it might be.
“It was nothing. I ought to thank you, really, for putting up with me and my nonsense at Harrods. I feel like I become a different person when I work there, much snarkier than usual. I didn’t mean to offend.”
Harry had all but forgotten about calling emergency services. “I don’t want a Mediwizard, not if it’s going to call too much attention to myself. But if it looks really bad, maybe I should have a  Muggle doctor take a look at it.”
After much back and forth, Draco wrangled Ginny into letting him split the difference on the dress for her. “Consider it an investment in your team’s image. Besides, I’ve taken up with your leavings, I might as well do something to make up for it.”
“Understood.” Draco was smiling impishly as he removed Harry’s glasses at last and wound the scarf around Harry’s head, covering his eyes completely. “Come on, let me take you to bed.” He took Harry by the hand and kissed it before leading him on a slow journey up the stairs. It was interrupted a bit on the landing, when Harry nearly tripped and Draco stepped in to catch him. “Easy there, Harry, I got you.” The feeling of Draco holding him close while blindfolded was almost too much to bear, and Harry contemplated jumping him and having it over with right there. But Draco boosted him back up, and they were on their way again.
Hermione shook her head. “That shouldn’t make a difference, the wards should guard against Muggle weapons and unarmed Wizards as well.” She twisted her hands together in frustration. “Sometimes I wish I’d gone further with Comparative Muggle-Wizard Studies.”
The bedroom was much quieter than the rest of the house. “Silencing wards,” Draco told him when he asked. “I have trouble sleeping without them. The bed is straight ahead, why don’t you lie down on your front.”
Draco swallowed. “Harry, I-“ Whatever he wanted to say was clearly taking an enormous amount of effort, and Harry paused, aching for him. “Please don’t leave me alone here.”
Harry grabbed at her arm in sympathy, and she closed her eyes for a moment, accepting his touch. “Just last week, I got some more death threats by owl, to the point of seriously considering not coming tonight.” She opened her eyes again, bright with unshed tears. “Fer wouldn’t hear of it though, she thought it was important to show the world that we’re not afraid.”
Draco had to think back for a moment. “Probably when I first learned about something called the Philosopher’s Stone. Have you heard anything about it?”
Harry whistled. “Well, isn’t that the million-dollar question. It’s a Muggle TV reference,” he explained in response to Draco’s blank look. “I don’t really know how to answer that, to be honest. I mean, sure, on the one hand it’s easy, if I had the opportunity to do my life over and have my parents live to take care of me without being famous Harry Potter, I would do it. But with Voldemort, and the way things were in the Wizarding world when I was born, I don’t think it would have worked any other way. So from that perspective, no, I would still choose to be Harry Potter. I’m not sure if that makes any kind of sense.”
“I wouldn’t try any healing charms if I were you, they can go wrong very quickly when self-administered. Don’t worry about it, I’ll be right over. You stay put, all right? I just have to put on some warmer clothing and grab some supplies.”
“That bloody Gryffindor scarf. Some things never change, do they.”
Draco bristled at the tone of incredulity. “I might ask you the same,
Harry opened his mouth to protest, then shut it, considering. Draco did have a point – the last time he had gone shopping was right around the time he had sworn off drinking, and his judgment might have still been a bit clouded. Besides, it could not be denied that Draco was a fine dresser.
Harry smiled then, a small, sad one. “What makes you think I’d wait?”
Draco’s eyes rolled skyward and he struggled against the magical bonds she had placed upon him. “I swear to Salazar, Granger, I am not going to hurt him. Just let me help him, please.”
Draco couldn’t resist rolling his eyes. “Harry, get over yourself. I’m really hot, you’re fucking gorgeous, and we’re both horny young men in our twenties. Besides, you’re protected by the runes I painted on your back, and so am I. I don’t think the stakes are very high.” He punctuated the rhyme by rolling over, leaving Harry to have his way with him.
“You never know, maybe she’ll even be pleased. It might boost her social standing a little, to be associated with the so-called ‘savior’ of the Wizarding order.” Harry didn’t really care that much about his mother’s social standing or about being hailed as a hero, but in the interest of understanding the rules of the Malfoy family game, and at Draco’s encouragement, he had started to become more outspoken about himself and his legacy.
Hermione looked sharply back at Draco. “Surely you’ve heard that with great power, comes great responsibility. Enjoying it doesn’t really matter, in the greater scheme of things.”
Harry paused. “All – all right. How do you want me to do it?”
Draco seemed to be in a similar condition, and pounced on Harry at the end of the bed as soon as he had landed. “Enough of this,” he growled at him as he went about the serious business of pulling off Harry’s shirt and trousers, all while kissing a line along his collarbone, and ending with a possessive bite to his shoulder. “You have the weirdest imagination, I swear, but that little trick was really – “
Harry was uncertain about this idea. “Don’t you still work on weekends though?”
Harry’s expression was mischievous, and Draco wondered whether he’d overdone it with the Felici-Fizz. Who knew how it affected these foolhardy Gryffindor types? But that ship had sailed already, so he might as well find out where it was headed.
So there he was, walking into the Three Broomsticks, hoping to see Harry.

I stuck my hand out, and then said, “

I practically apparate over there, and I pull him into my lap, holding up his head and his shoulders.
AHH VOTE FOR WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN! I'll consider all of your votes, but overall I have to choose. ;)

Why me.
Anyway, please keep reading? It’s gonna get better, and the last few chapters have been quite boring to write. So, please? I appreciate all u guys being like ‘WHERE THE FUCK IS DRACO’ and I’m like ‘DAMN GUYS YOU’RE RIGHT THIS STORY HAS BEEN SHIT... SO I’M GONNA FIX IT!’
Just maybe.
I'm a coward.
"Thank you, sir." Draco said, and then got out of his chair, climbing over the bar, and heading up the stairs that were to his left.
"So, what do you choose, Miss Parkinson?"
Hermione shook her head a bit, and then stopped to rub her temples. Ron made a miserable groaning noise, and then muttered a no.
Harry's the fucking Chosen One. He's the one who'll destroy Voldemort. Who will put all of the Death Eaters in Azkaban, or kill them.
I walked into the manor, looking around. I had forgotten how big it was. Harry was right. I am a lucky fucker. I through the house, and a house elf came and took my trunk upstairs, presumably to my bedroom. I strolled through the many rooms in the house, vaguely heading towards my mother's favorite sitting room. I walked through a room full of big oil paintings. I knew that they were priceless, and we had at least ten the room. I don't think that you can get much richer than that. Harry's made me realize just how good I have it. I open the door to the dark sitting room that my mother spends most of her time in. It's a big room, all dark and made of dark blues, reds, and blacks. It has a huge fireplace, and I have yet to see it

"Love you, Pans."
He stopped outside the portrait hole.
“You… you weren’t… weren’t supposed to… to find me…” he said, and then coughed.
"Oh, fuck fuck fuck! What are we going to tell the Golden Trio?"
I was snapped out of it by Harry grabbing my leg and slinging in over his hip. It took all of my self-control to not start humping him.
“Do you remember anything about last night?” I ask, wondering if they did.
I laughed, and thankfully, so did Hermione.
Hello Guys! Welcome to my fic! It's going to be long, and I swear to God I will do everything in my power to finish it. I already have it planned out, and it should all come together. SO, BEFORE WE START THIS! WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS IF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, CUTTING YOURSELF, AND DEPRESSION ARE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T/SHOULDN'T READ!!!! Really, turn back now if that make you uncomfortable/triggers you. So, after that dreary warning, welcome to my sad little fic where Draco and Harry are super happy, Draco gets his dark mark and feels like he is complete fucking shit, and pushed Harry away. LOTS OF ANGST. Anyway, enjoy!

“Okay, Harry, just concentrate on what you want done. Concentrate…”
They then put the chocolate in the box, and then set it at the foot of his bed. They put some green ribbon on it, and I know that he won’t miss it. I shoved the box under Blaise’s bed. He’s currently sleeping, but he should be up any minute. I flop down on Blaise’s bed, and he sits down next to me. Crabbe and Goyle sit on theirs. We start talking about small things, but we all keep an eye on Draco.
He wasn't surprised by the absence of the Slytherins, as they always went to Hog's Head, where you could get drunk off your arse and no one would care, even if you were thirteen. But the Gryffindors always came here. Gryffindors practically lived here when they were in Hogsmeade.
Most of all, I’d do everything in my power to get Harry back. He might not want me, but…

was overwhelming. Ron tugged Harry out of Malfoy's face, and muttered "You can do so much better than this, mate."
” I say, and the quill hovers for a bit, and then falls back to the table.
Just a really, really, really sad fucking chapter which made me cry and I am now tearing my own heart out SOMEONE HELP ME! Just sad, guys. There’s like under ten more angsty   chapters in this fic, so please... just try not to cry. I fucking dare you.
Harry was surprised that she didn't faint right then and there. She collected herself, and smiled at him. Harry, in response, winked. Why Harry did this? It was fun to just casually flirt. If the new Omega didn't work out, she wouldn't be half bad.
"The St. Mungo's healers are looking desperately, along with an Auror or two, a few people from the Ministry, and some of my own, including the Centaurs and Hagrid. We're doing everything we can."
The curtains are suddenly drawn away, and I want to hiss. The sunlight stings my eyes, and I try to throw a hand up to block it. Tiny hot streaks of pain shoot up my arm, feeling like it's going to fall off because of the pain, or if not, I'll rip it off myself.
I open my eyes a smidge, finding myself looking at Madam Pomfrey.
I remember that I have other presents to open. Maybe they're some from my friends?
I'm sitting on the ledge of the Astronomy Tower, thinking about jumping off, and cutting, and how I can't see through my tears, and about my parents, and being a fucking Death Eater, and about that fucking boy who I love, with his stupid green eyes and his stupid scar and his stupid broomstick and stupid savior complex. And his stupid ability to fuck me senseless.
“That’s great, Harry!” said Neville.
“But she also said she was 100% sure that he wouldn’t come. So. Uh, yeah. Stop worrying, Harry. He mostly likely won’t come.”
scent.
It brings almost instant relief, and so he gets up, knowing he only has about five minutes till the spell wears off. That’s the thing about this spell, it wears off quickly. Draco tried using it multiple times in one day, once, and it had dire effects. (Including nausea, sore throat, and every other terrible thing you can think of.) (Okay, not
“What, that I’m not jumping at the chance to marry you? I think Potter would murder me if I tried.”
“Do you even know your boyfriend?” he hears and looks up to see that Pansy has finally made it in, swishing her very expensive blue velvet cloak off her shoulders. “Draco doesn’t

Draco blinks, winded. “Excuse me?”

Harry stares at him, evidently baffled. Delighted had definitely
“Kindly, fuck off,” she responds, and then she’s gone, and he watches her slip into the circle next to Astoria, lean slightly into Astoria’s side. They’re the kind of exes who never seem able to keep their hands off each other and ah, yes…when he’s done refilling her champagne and exchanging pleasantries with Harry’s boss, he spots the pair of them disappearing through the side-gate, hand in hand. Typical.
Draco pouts at him, affects a swoon into Pansy who pinches his side hard. “Ow,” he says to her, and then, “I’m hurt, Nott.”
” Harry says, and Draco wishes he had a camera to capture the hilarious expression on Harry’s face, feels the smile invade his own.
“Your whole
“There
“Darling,” Draco had replied seriously, “I wish I could.”
“Narcissa, the son’s gay,” he announces, loudly. Narcissa looks up from her own magazine, rises gracefully to her feet. Draco hovers in the doorway, unsure, but she meets his eyes and smiles.
“I heard you the first time,” Lucius says. “Who is it?”
“But you do?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Ron interrupts. “All that later. Look at it.”
“No harm,” Theo replies, kisses her cheek. Daphne pinks, and smiles – all dimples and newly-engaged glow. It would be utterly sickening if Draco wasn’t so pleased for them both; in any case, he’s had a long time to get used to their lovebird act.
“Your sadly broken heart over the marriage that’s no longer going ahead?” Harry suggests, and Pansy barks a laugh.
With that, he shuts his door and Harry, stunned, face-palms. “I think,” he says from behind his hands, “they’ve invited the entire population of wizarding Britain.”
Narcissa is nodding. “We’ll have him for dinner soon, and then perhaps the two of you can come and visit us when we go on holiday. Has Harry been to Rome yet, darling?”
“I mean, you are kind of misleading,” Daphne says consideringly, twirling a blonde ringlet delicately around one of her fingers.
Draco excuses himself silently from the little circle listening to Vince and Greg’s latest adventure story, turns to see Cho Chang and her nonplussed husband, who is shaking his hand, glancing at Cho as if to say
“I have my sources,” his father says. “Tell me, young man, I want an honest answer. Did you really fight off a mob of Parisian gangsters with nothing but your wits and your cello?”
“Lucius. We talked about this. Supporting his community and finding him a partner are not mutually exclusive.”
“What’s this?” Ron demands.
“They’re fine,” Ron mutters. Harry sits back, folds his arms, knows he could rescue Ron if he really wanted to, but is enjoying the show far too much for that.
“No, he hasn’t,” Draco says. “He’d like it.”
“Really. I can’t believe he didn’t tell us. We could have had an arrangement with the Notts or the Shafiqs by now, I hear the second Shafiq son is of that persuasion though he might be spoken for. We might have to look further afield.”
“You don’t mind?” Draco asks, tentatively returning his father’s embrace. He can’t remember the last time they’d hugged. This is
There is a long silence in which Draco swears every molecule of breathable oxygen in the garden inconveniently disappears. He digs his nails hard into the palms of his hands.

ago – Harry would have agreed, would have written off the whole lot of them as stuck-up blood supremacist pricks not worth the time of day. But then he and Draco had had to work together on that case, and there had been so much
“I think wits is pushing it,” Cho says at the exact same time, and Lucius laughs, delighted.
“As long you’re with me,” Harry says, face very close, “I’m ready for anything.”
“You heard me, don’t pretend your ears aren’t working,” Lucius snaps, dropping his newspaper onto the table. “Honestly. What do you have to say for yourself?”
to hide.
Draco is standing at the stove in their apartment when he hears the door slam. Like clockwork, he can hear Harry’s boots hitting the skirting board where he always abandons them after a day at work as if they’re not
“It could be worse,” Pansy says, coming over to loom over Harry’s desk as well. “They could be the Greengrasses. At least Narcissa has class.”
“I think,” Ron echoes, “that you might be right.”
“Pansy’s known for years,” Draco gets out.
He talks to Cho for a bit about her part-time archival qualification, and then suddenly an arm slides around his waist, and he hears Harry say, “Hi! Cho! Mind if I borrow him?”
“Of course,” Narcissa says, kissing Draco’s cheek and gliding back across the room to pick up her notebook. “What’s that emblem all the young gay people are using today? Miss Granger was explaining it to me at the last board meeting – a rainbow? Perhaps we should get one of those flags…encourage donations to a gay charity…”
“I didn’t say
“Yeah. Me too.” Draco sighs. “I never thought it could be like this, you know? Everyone here.”
“By your standards or society’s?”
“I can’t believe your father thought I was gay,” Theo says into the considering silence, “I mean, how has he missed…” he trails off, gesturing between himself and Daphne and the rock as big as Venus on her fourth finger.
Afterwards at home, Harry had crawled into Draco’s lap and put his hands on Draco’s shoulders, met his eyes seriously and said: “Tell me you Obliviated your father because that was the

only three-” Stephen begins, demurring.
“Good morning, Harry, how was your weekend?” Harry replies, picking up the envelope. “It was great thanks, Ron, Draco…”
The first thing Harry knows of it is a gilt-edged envelope dropping onto his desk like the world’s prettiest stink-bomb. He looks up from his early-morning in-tray to see Ron standing above him, all scowl and folded arms, his freckled cheeks pink.
“Merlin, Parkinson, why aren’t you getting on Harry’s case about this?”

“I am not. My mother is already picking out colour schemes for the wedding. I told her we’re not even engaged yet but she is very good at not listening to things she doesn’t want to hear.”
eligible match.”
“Father, I have to tell you that…well, the reason that…I’m gay.”
“I…why?”
“Draco, I’m very disappointed in you,” his father starts, and Draco’s stomach sinks like a Muggle trading ship in a monstrous hurricane. It’s going to be like he thought. He was a fool to expect anything different. He raises his chin, waits for the worst. Then, “for Merlin’s sake, boy, why didn’t you tell us sooner? All that effort your mother and I put into finding you a future wife at those garden parties when we should have been looking for a future husband!”
“Yeah. Sorry.” Then, “Why are you looking at me like that?”
Lucius gets up and smooths down the front of his green silk lounging robes, and gestures abruptly at Draco before turning on his heel and marching back into the house. Draco, dazed, follows as his father strides down the corridors to his mother’s morning parlour, knocks and shoves the door open.
“I’m as confused as you are. I had no idea they could be so accepting.” Draco tilts his nose up and does his best impression of his father’s voice, “It doesn’t matter that you’re gay, Draco, it matters that you make an eligible match. And Harry Potter is a
“What do you mean?” Harry asks, eyebrows crunching together.
“Well, good,” Draco says, kissing the top of Harry’s head. “I’m glad.”
Draco snickers to himself, moves over to insinuate himself into the conversation. It’s well-known amongst their friendship circle that Stephen is an MI6 agent, a Muggle who stumbled across wizards at university and was promptly recruited to be a spy. Draco’s sure his handlers weren’t banking on him meeting and falling head over heels for Cho, and equally sure they weren’t expecting their covert mission to turn so upside down, but that’s the way of the world. Now everyone kindly pretends to ignore what Stephen is up to and Stephen – relaxed guy that he is – plays along.
“I’m glad to have given them an excuse.”
“Morning, Parkinson,” Harry replies. “And he can be quite funny when he wants to be.”
a lovely young man, I’m sure,” Narcissa adds.
“I already have a-”
“You are too, now,” Draco tells him. “I hope you’re ready.”
“Sorry,” Draco mouths in Stephen’s direction, and Stephen smiles at him, turns back to Lucius. Perhaps Harry’s onto something. Perhaps Lucius really has been obliviated. He doesn’t think he’s seen his father like this
Okay, what did I know?

I recognize Blaise's handwriting. It just says,
"What can I do to help?" I say quickly.
His warm breath fanned out across my face, and I closed my eyes. “Yes…” I give a tiny sigh. “Do I have to? Why can’t I just spend Christmas here at Hogwarts?” Harry just shook his head a bit, and then replied, “You always spend Christmas with your parents. How would they react if you said, “Hey Mom and Dad, I want to spend Christmas at Hogwarts for the first time ever because I’m dating Harry Potter. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. The fact that I’m gay as fuck
That's really all that I have to live for.

She cuts him off, and I want to flip the bird at her. “No, Harry, you don’t understand. You need to heal him

"Mate-" Ron started, but was cut off quickly by Harry.
I'm probably saying 'fuck' too much. My mother has drilled it into me for
Way too much of it.
“That I am. Anyway, I’m going to invite Draco, but is that just a suicide mission? Speaking of which, have you seen him recently? I’ve been gone…” She looks at me worriedly. I swear, she’s such a mother hen…
“What the hell just happened?!” He asks me in a violent whisper. “I don’t know! Maybe you didn’t put enough of the potion in?" I hiss at him. Blaise frowns and shakes his head. “I put two drops in every square of chocolate. That couldn’t be it.” I frown, remembering the box.
He finally found it, tried to push his sleeve up as quickly as possible, and sunk his blade straight into the skin. He tore quickly, trying to work out his pain. The blood had soaked through his clothes, was dripping on the floor, and he somehow got it in his hair. (He actually pushed it back with his bloody hand.) No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get his Dark Mark to disfigure. No matter how many times he cut, he just

good." she spits out in her insane voice. I kneel down in front of the chair. I don't make direct eye contact with the Dark Lord, but I watch as he draws his wand. I glance over at my Mother, and her expression is pained as ever. I glance at my Father, who's expression is blank. Auntie Bellatrix's is excited. The Dark Lord pushes up my sleeve. His hands are cold, and I want to recoil instantly. His hands feel gross on my skin, and it repulses me. It takes all of my will to stay were I am. I am replaced by a blank numbness, there is nothing in my heart. It's like my insides are filled with ice. The Dark Lord puts his wand to my left forearm. My last thought before the pain is
We met up with Pansy and Blaise on our way out of the Great Hall, and they both looked the same as Ron. Speaking of Ron, he had yet to talk this morning, and was moaning miserably every few seconds.
"Gentlemen, I said,
It'll hurt. A lot. For the both of us. I think it will hurt me more, though. He has a life. And a gigantic hero complex. And a saving people thing. And friends. And a bunch of girls that would marry him in a heartbeat. (Don't think about that, Draco...) And a house. And any career he wants. Anything he really wants, he can get. Because he's our savior. I know he'll be the one to do Voldemort in, if anyone can. (I'm starting to think it's impossible, though...) And the fact that you can throw anything at Harry, and he'll get over it, with time.

I had a black bra on. It was plain and simple, but it gave you a good sense of what I looked like underneath it. That’s why I like it. I was wearing a black, see-through, long-sleeve, mesh top, and a orangish-pink skirt that stopped mid-thigh. My black combat boots were well loved, but they looked brand new. (I cast spells on them after every wear.)
“Who’s gonna be your Maid of Honor and Bridesmaids?” Harry asked, honestly curious.
“Do you guys remember any of last night?” I ask, wondering if I was the only one who didn’t remember everything.
My head was consumed by two words.
Or more so shadows of them.

Ron ran over, looped his arm through Harry's, and said "He's not worth it, mate" coldly. Harry was shaking, the rage in his eyes clear. Hermione was on his other side now, holding him back. The dark-haired boy's hands were clenched so tightly that it was painful. His expression was terrifying, no one had seen him this mad in awhile. Ron and Hermione were scared, the last time that he was this mad it was not good.
Hey guys! I’m really sorry, I’m going camping again and I won’t be back until Saturday. HANG IN THERE! Normal updating will resume after I get back.
Harry’s face fell.
Draco was surprised. Really,
that ‘Mione’s right. She always is. (I’m serious. She literally hasn’t been wrong yet.) No one in our group has gotten pregnant yet, but I’m pretty sure that all of the Omegas or Beta girls are on birth control. (We’re a bit young for children…) (Nineteen and twenty is still pretty young.) Anyways, Harry was remembering how he’d become friends with, well, if he was going to list them off, he might as well. He’d become friends with Ron, Lav, Pansy, ‘Mione, Gin, Lu, Dean, Seamus, Theo, Daph, Blaise, Parvati, Nev, and Cho. Honestly, it sounded like a big group, but in reality, it was only fourteen people. That’s not very many, when you think about it. Most of them were at Harry’s house right now. Lav was out with Parvati, Daph, and Cho. Pansy was in rut right now, so her and ‘Mione are back at their flat with Crookshanks and Precious. (Who’s Pansy’s pitbull. Long story.) Gin and Luna decided to skip the girl’s night, in favor of hanging out at my house. Gin, like I said, she’s close to her rut, and she’d probably scare the other girls. (We’re all scary and more dominant than usual when we’re close to a rut.) (Like, super scary.)
I think I might have to live off of all the things I've stolen from him.
“Moring Ron, ‘Mione.” I said miserably, sitting down on the table.
“You- you were gone, and I- I don’t know why I freaked out. I just- I just... I just did. That isn’t normal, Pans.”
(Knowing him, he will.)
but I just couldn't.
And it'll kill me.
I mean, I know that the world doesn't revolve around me. (I may forget it at times, though...) But really. Come on. I just got added to the biggest group of fucking bullies. Against my fucking will.
“Nooooooooooo” Blaise said, the ‘o’ going on for a long time.
Draco mind worked slowly, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Eventually it clicked.
Like he promised, it's a huge box of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. He mentioned something about having a lifetime supply... but this was a
He wasn’t supposed to.

These are the thoughts that run through my head. Constantly.

“Morning, Harry.” Hermione said finally, after looking up from her plate.
It felt like I was drowning in emotions.
Blaise had a small smirk on his face.
I pull Draco close, stroking his back, and muttering sweet things. He sobs on my shirt, soaking it with tears, but I couldn’t care less right now. “What’s wrong, Dray, darling? What happened?” I say softly.

So this is what this is. Blackmail. I don't want this. But, no. My family must not die.

Hermione’s eyes went from scared to determined in a second.
Blaise drops down on the floor, and he ruffles around for a bit before coming back up with the box. He starts to read the back and so do I.
I muttered a quick incantation for dreamless sleep, and Ron made a move to pick Harry up once the hurt noises stopped. I helped him pull Harry into his arms, and then stepped back. We walked through the halls, not saying a word. My emotions were swirling around, and I couldn't sort them out. It was a ball of emotion, all knotted together and impossible to sort out. Form the look on Ron's face, that was how he was feeling, too.
"Can't you see how much I've done for you? Don't you realize that you should

I laugh internally, Pansy really was something special.
Pansy frowned, and then grabbed Blaise's hand and started tugging him away. "Wait." I managed to choke out, and Pansy stopped and looked at me. "If... if Draco doesn't want to be with me... tell him that that's fine. I'll get over it, probably. And promise me that we'll all still hang out and be friends. Please." Pansy nodded quickly. "If that fucker doesn't want to stay with you, that's his fucking fault. He's missing out on one of the sweetest boys known to mankind. He'd be an

The odds aren't in my favor.
I think I might have to live off of all the things I've stolen from him.

He wanted to know where they were.
I swear on my life I would die to be a normal kid who gets normal things and has a normal family that doesn't roll around in gold and they aren't worried about table manners and parties, but playing Quidditch in the backyard and doing housework.

He turned on his heel, dragging Harry along with him, pulling the raging boy away from the haze of his angry, furious, violet thoughts, as well as away from the blonde bitch.
“Harry, you need to heal him.” Hermione said, kneeling down next to me.
Thank you!

going to get drunk off his arse. He ordered a bottle of Ice Vodka, (A whole fucking bottle, because that's what you could do when you were richer than the devil himself) which had a distinctly peppermint taste, and was icy cold. He sat in the corner, drinking straight out of the bottle.

) the Quidditch matches...
“Dammit, Dray! Stay with me, come on!” I shouted.
I sigh softly, stroking his hair. “A panic attack, baby. It’s okay.”
“Harry! Yay! This is amazing!”
Draco was only there because he didn't want to abandon his team right before a match, and they likely couldn't have try-outs and train in the new Seeker in time for the game. He should've just quit. Any player could have been better than him right now.
My though is cut off by the cold voice. "It is an
But that will mean hurting his feelings.
"How are they paying for it?" he asked rather quickly.
"Yes, Professor Snape."
She examines her long, crimson red nails.
Definitely not me, that's fucking who.
"That's for hurting Harry," she said, her voice angry and it was almost like it her words were burning Draco's skin. She then walked out of the Hall gracefully, tossing her hair over her shoulder.
This is what I deserve.

inside your finger.
Hermione just wanted to leave with Harry and Ron, and to not come back. Studies be damned. To be safe, leave the war behind, and live their lives a little. Right now, the way things were going, Harry was being raised like a pig for slaughter. That wouldn't happen. Not while Hermione was alive. She thought about running to the Shrieking Shack, and apperating them away. To somewhere that was warm, with white sand and an ocean so wide that it went on forever. To somewhere
Pansy laughed, and then said, “Fine. Best Man it is.”
Pansy looks down at her shoes.
I’ve also been wanting to try something.
"I wasn't kidding about that shag."
“Oh, I was wondering if you wanted to sneak out and go get drinks with Hermione, Ron, Harry, and I? We were thinking about going to Hog’s Head.”
Harry will have to kill me.
This is one hell of a hangover.

and here she is, sending me food and a cozy sweater. I really don't deserve it. I realize there's a note in the bottom. I pick it up and read it, and it says:
Neville, Dean, and Seamus are talking about how Quidditch is going to start soon. Harry misses Quidditch, it’s the off season, and he can’t wait to get back to it. He can’t wait to get back to his team, the Magpies. He’s the #1 seeker in Britain right now. That’s nice, and all, but he’s getting sick of all the awards. Ever since he presented as an Alpha, the Daily Prophet has proclaimed him ‘Sexiest Alpha Alive’, three years running. It’s a lot, having girls throw themselves at you, hoping that their scent will be the one. Harry was just sick of it.
Well, this is angsty.
"I just wish that you were back to your old self, Sweetheart."
There’s so many things I want to say to him, but I can’t find the energy to.
that it left Harry breathless. He immediately picked out the minty scent, which confused him, because
After a bit, Draco woke. I smiled at him, and I watched as Crabbe pushed his face into a pillow to keep himself from smiling visibly. Draco just yawned, stretched, and rolled out of bed. I went back to talking to Blaise, but he wouldn’t participate in the conversation
“What’s- Harry? Draco?”
Draco shook his head, not wanting to believe Seamus. Ron was talking about
His eyes were dull and he looked like he was looking at me and not seeing anything. And then they close.
It kinda comes back in a flash.
"That's really nice of her."
I mean, I know that the world doesn't revolve around me. (I may forget it at times, though...) But really. Come on. I just got added to the biggest group of fucking bullies. Against my fucking will.
(See the end of the chapter for
I feel my eyes widening.
He pulled the sweater on, careful to not get blood on it. (Or tried to not get blood on it. There was too much not to.)
I nodded.
"My sister-" she stopped to draw in a quick breath. "Samantha- she accidentally consumed poison, a very rare one- and the only cure is Unicorn eye! A fucking Unicorn hasn't been seen in years!
He stared at the tattoo that was etched into his skin. He started to scrub the skin raw, and it hurt. But Draco felt like that’s what he deserved. So he kept scrubbing, scrubbing, scrubbing…
” I paused, and Hermione rattled the handle. The door didn’t budge. “Nope.”
She rolled her eyes. “I’m aware of the fact.”
I watch with a cold expression as they dump the love potion into some of Draco’s favorite chocolate. The guys are laughing, and I want to stomp on their feet. (They always complain when I do that.)
Harry's out of my life.
Pansy. Loosen up!” I glare at him, and mutter, “You are just
Harry stormed over, his face angry, his robes billowing out behind him.
Oh, fuck you, parents. I probably would be being fucked senseless right now, if I had stayed. Really, Harry probably would have had to carry me everywhere. Oh, those were the times. I had a brief flashback to the first weekend that we had fucked so much that I couldn't walk, and I was so sore that Harry carried me to all of my classes that Monday.
Draco went back downstairs, and decided that he
Draco shakes his head, trying to get the memory of seeing Harry's Patronus for the first time out of his head, and asks "Where are they?"
“Oh.” I say, my voice blank.
He was now feeling a heavy wave of depression washing over him.
Harry was actually interested this time. He’d always liked to date people with lots of personality, (Hence dating Ginny and Cho before he presented) and this sounded like they had exactly that. Angelina had said to come right away… He really should get going.
and I start to stand up, carefully hiding the title of my book as I set it down on the chair I were I was sitting. I straighten my tie, and smooth my robes down with a hand.
It's satisfying, cutting. I watch the blood drip down my arm and onto the black sheets. No one will notice the stain. I feel the pain, and I enjoy, almost. I feel like I got what I deserve. I do it again. And again. And again, again, again, again.
I know how much Dray needs Harry. Dray's more helpless than he seems. He has issues, and Harry made him a lot better than he used to be. The depression used to get to him, and the need to please his father. Harry fixed that. Harry made him better. I'm thankful for that. Dray needs a constant in his life. And, according to Hermione, Harry was a fucking
Draco felt the need to figure out what had upset Harry, and he said impulsively, "Do you know why he was upset, Seamus?"
Oh, the
I reach over and pick up the knife. I wince as I stretch the skin on my left arm.

What about Harry?! This is going to break him!” I exclaim.

hopeless. I can't even make a dramatic exit without grabbing my boyfriend. I'm so needy. We eventually made it to the train station in Hogsmeade. It was filled with students, all chatting, and some were clutching there cats so hard I thought that they might die of suffocation. Harry leaned down and kissed me quickly, not making a scene of it. I pulled him into a hug, and he whispered, "I'll miss you. But I'll make due for a bit. See you soon. Enjoy Christmas with your parents." I pushed my mouth up to his ear and whispered, "I'll miss you, so much, baby." I stopped, unsure of what to say. "I wish I didn't have to go." I muttered under my breath. Harry gave me one of his famous smiles, and said, "Enjoy it. Not everyone lives in a mansion." I smirked a bit, and then I heard the boarding call for the train. Harry leaned in to kiss me once more, squeezed me hard, and then stepped back. I got on the train with a sad smile. I got into a compartment towards the back, hoping no one else would decide to come in. I stared out the window. My thoughts were running along the lines of
“That I am.”
I'd forgotten about Christmas. Wasn't that the whole reason that I came back to my fucking house?
things with him, if you know what I mean. (*winks*) He wanted to find out who made Draco this way, and to deck them in the face. (
"No."
Draco’s eyes flutter open, looking around, and I watch as he sees Harry.
He was definitely quitting after this. The second that Marcus Flint could see past the red in his eyes after they lost, Draco would quit.
He slowly untied his tie, then unbuttoned his shirt and chucked it off. He stared at the big bruise on his chest, and hesitantly poked at it. It stung. He leaned over and dug through his trunk, looking for-
"What?"
Which I swore I would never do.
"I... I, um..."
I miss Harry.

"You aren't up for a quick shag, are you? I'm feeling quite stressed, right about now."
I stopped for a moment, my anger stopped in it’s tracks, (A very rare thing) and my mouth hung open. Draco looked up at me, his eyes wide.
"Good job, Mate!" Ron said, and then gave him a thump on the back. Harry was smiling so hard that his mouth hurt.
tries to upset Pansy in any way when she’s mad. Or annoyed. Or on her period. Dealing with her during her period is the worst. That is something to avoid at all costs.
he was solely looking at Harry because he could, and no one would notice. He could stare at him all he wanted, and no one would care.
I sigh, and then look at Ron.
So I keep thinking about Harry, because I’m going to die someday. Someday soon.
Yeah, Harry could do this. He could hide his feelings. For Draco.
“A... a
I'm going to have to break up with him.
Hi everyone! I am back, and I would seriously like to apologize, I haven't updated really since August, and that's a horrible thing in my mind. I will, drumroll please, be revamping the fic! And finishing it! I’m going to go back and fix up all the old chapters, and if you want to reread them go ahead, since the plot might change a bit, and my writing has gotten better. I promise, swearing on my fucking life, that I will do everything I can to finish this fic. I’m only going to be updating weekly (with a few exceptions), and I hope that’ll help me get back into the hang of things. Y’all have been so sweet, and I can’t wait to read more of your lovely comments and get to know you again. Here’s a little sneak peak into what will come after I update the old chapters!
The bartender walked over to him and grunted.
So Harry lost himself in it.
out of the Common Room, his robes billowing out behind him, I follow, and shoot Blaise a nervous look.
"Well, go on ahead," said the girl, her voice noticeably lower.
Draco!
*Cough* 394 *Cough*) he said, picking up a big pile of textbooks. He then proceeded to drop them loudly, and Ron groaned almost as loudly.
I start thinking about everything again, and all of the sudden the panic wells up sharply inside me, and I-
And finally, more Obsessed_with_drarry, who has been such a wonderful commenter that I can't even start on how lovely she is. Anyway, thank you guys!
“Hey, mate, what’s that?” asked Ron, staring up at him from his place on the couch.
I look through the packages, and I finally come up with a few.
. Sometimes, if I close my eyes, I can almost smell the warm smell that is Harry. It's hard to explain, it's just warm. I want to wrap myself in a blanket of it. My pajamas don't smell like him, though, no matter how hard I try to imagine it. I stole this weeks ago. I don't honestly know why my Mother grabbed these certain ones. They're the red and gold of Gryffindor. But I don't give a fuck as to
"WHAT DID I EVER DO TO HIM?" Harry roared, quiet enough that the rest of the hall couldn't hear, but loud enough that some of the Gryffindors turned their heads towards him.
I woke up to a cold bed, warm light, and a horrible pain in my body.
that can't be right. It isn't. We haven't fought seriously since Draco said that he was worried about all of my fucking brushes with death. And I told him 'who else is going to save the fucking world?' That was the first time we broke up. We got together at the beginning of the year... and it was in October when we broke up the first time. It's basically been smooth sailing from there. Well, we got in shouting matches sometimes, but no one agrees on everything, and we didn't ever fight on such a major scale. According to Pansy, Draco had a harder time with breaking up with me than I did, and he was fucking scared because I went back to the way things were, (Aka 3rd year hatred of each other) and I acted like everything was fine and I was fine and I didn't give a fuck about him. I made sure to tell him how much he meant to me after I heard that. But I never told him that I knew about that, though. We try not to keep secrets from each other, but we can have a pretty rocky relationship. After the break up, we've mostly been all lovey dovey, though. I like that much better. He's shy, and always is scared that I'll push him away. (Not that that would
honor, Draco. You should be running over here to get your mark! There is no refusing the Dark Lord." I just stand there. It stays like this, and then there is a soft hissing noise. I watch as a huge snake glides to the armchair. Oh. It's Nagini. The Dark Lord's snake. I nod stiffly after a bit. It's Death Eaterism or death. I want to live. But I don't want to become a disgusting Death Eater. I walk over to the armchair, and my father smiles. "Good, Draco," the Dark Lord says. "You have made the right decision." Auntie Bella gives a high-pitched squeal. "
He starts to fall backwards, and I whip my wand out, casting a cushioning charm. His head hits the ground, and I silently wish for Madame Pomfrey to show up
I nearly peed myself when I named this chapter, but I didn't want to explain that early, cuz y'all didn't know what was in store for you. Anyway, this is my first REAL sex scene, and I hope it met your expectations. (I know I put that one in the first chapter, but that wasn't good. At all.) So, please comment! Tell me what you thought of it! Anyway, love you guys, xoxo :)
Hermione squealed, and then said, “Practice tonight, at 9:30? Pansy has to go back to the hospital at nine, so I’ll be free then.”

nice of you to show up!" my aunt said quickly, in her high-pitched, girly, over-excited manner. I nodded at her, still unsure of what I was seeing. I pushed my face into a cold mask. My father turned and faced me, as did my mother. When I looked at my mother's face I gave a small gasp. It wasn't audible, but I did it anyway. There were dark circles under my mother's eyes, and her face was creased with a worried and pained expression. "Draco." my father drawled in his cold manner, his eyes blank. I nodded, walking closer. "We have a very esteemed guest here, today." I nodded again. The tension was so thick in the air you could feel it. Everyone was tense, except for my Aunt Bella. She was smiling, seemingly excited. I wondered again who was in the chair, but I kept silent. I was polite, like I was taught to be. Then, a high, cold, voice broke the silence. "Draco." I felt dread wash over me in a wave.
I have a horrible headache, and I can’t remember much about last night except being hammered.
Ah, Hogwarts.
It stings, and is raw and red and screams

Harry watched as Draco slumped against the wall, and pushed his face into his hands.
He sat down on his bed.
I'm singing a chourus in my head that consists of "Fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck-" and so on. Really sorry about this chapter. It hurt to write it but, for the story to go on, this has to happen. I apologize. I also apologize for the last two chapters. They weren't very good. Also, PLEASE REVIEW! I've only had TWO reviews, from the lovely TweetArya and Goblet_of_fire4. THANK YOU GUYS, SO, SO, MUCH! (If you're reading this. I will put all reviewers names up here! So, just REVIEW! IT KEEPS THIS STORY GOING! A minute of your time and make someone's day! Please! Also, thank you to the people who left kudos! Bless your heart! Anyway, enjoy this shitty, rip my eyes out, stab me in the fucking heart chapter!
I AM BACK, EVERYONE! And in full swing, too! I want to thank you guys for being so supportive :) and OMG, I’VE BEEN WANTING TO WRITE THIS CHAPTER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS FIC!!! I’m SO excited (!!!) to finally share it with you! MUCH LOVE GUYS, MUCH LOVE!
I’m dating the Chosen One.” I scowled and leaned in to kiss Harry. He responds immediately, as always, and slips his tongue into my mouth. I graze his bottom lip with my teeth, and he pushes me into the wall. I have a quick flashback to my first time with him.
When we get back to the Common Room, I follow Blaise into his Dorm, just to check on Dray. When I enter, I find Draco culled up in a ball on his side, crying. I rush over, thanking Merlin for the fact that Theo, Crabbe, and Goyle are sleeping, and wrap my arms around him. Blaise casts a quick
Maman is French for Mom, if you don't speak French.)
Haha, I think the first notes were longer than the chapter. LONGER CHAPTER WILL COME SOON! Okay, just wanted to get a few things out of the way. Pansy was sitting in the library, and if any of you have watched the movies, can you remember back to when Harry is looking and Romilda Vane and being like, “But I AM the Chosen One.” Hope you can. That’s where Pansy is sitting. K? Ok. If you guys haven’t watched the movies, it’s basically just a slab of wood built into the wall of the library. Haha. Okay, also, Draco has shortish hair in this fic, I guess. Hermione’s hair is more curls than bushy, also. Harry’s is black and curly and messy and it has a habit of always sticking up. Ron’s is just... Ron’s? Yeah. Anyway, IF I GET FOUR COMMENTS I WILL POST A CHAPTER EVERY DAY! YOU CAN DO IT! Love you guys!
“G’luck, mate,” said Dean.
Harry was circling the field, looking for
I frown, and say, "No can do, Pans. I wish I could, though."
I hear the door open loudly, and I crack an eye open and see Granger and Weasel. I hear her ask something, but I don’t bother to listen closely. I know I’m going to die at this point. I don’t have enough let for anything. Except Harry. I’ll do whatever I can to stay. For Harry. Just for Harry.
I'm going to have to break up with him.
the way around my eyes. I had dark eye shadow, and it stuck out against my creamy white skin. My dark read lipstick was a stark contrast to my dark eyes, and I rather liked the look of it. My black bangs were plastered to my forehead, and my longer bob was deflated. My rose-gold hoop earrings and diamond studs were tangled with my raven black hair. My body still looked spectacular, though.
Anyway, Hermione’s engagement ring is right above this.

I said quickly, but I was really bad at healing charms. I suddenly remembered that Draco was, too.
Well, my life's already fucked anyway.
Harry Potter had been looking for a compatible scent for a long time. He was nineteen, and he still hadn’t found his mate, and he’d been an Alpha since the age of sixteen. That was
of when Harry and him used to play Seeker's Games. Just them and the Snitch. Draco would never admit that Harry was better than him. He was, though. He won almost ever time.

You can see his files because there’s an off chance that your scents will be compatible, but if you weren’t an Alpha, Merlin forbid that
Her dark hair was curled, hanging around her face, and her dark blue robes looked lovely on her. Her face- her face... was pale. Not the normal, beautiful face that I love, but a pale, shallow face with heavy bags under her eyes. This was very, very, concerning. My Mother always took pride in her appearance, and never went anywhere without looking perfect. So this was a sign in itself.
“So you’re telling me that, after all this time, the motherfucking ferret just
Not really though, because it’s just one thing.
I glance back at Blaise, and his face has harden, as if he was preparing for battle. I suppose we are, so I harden my face, too. I storm into Draco's room. And he's sitting on his bed, all balled up. He sees me, and jumps off his bed, wiping his face and then hardening it. I drop Blaise's hand and then storm over to him. I grab his shoulders and shake him. (Maybe I was trying to shake some sense into him?)
“I’m going to ask him to Best Man, but I’m almost 100% sure that he won’t even go, so I figured that you could be my back-up. Sound good? Oh, and on the off chance that he

The guy shook his head, and said "We're fresh out."

"I... I was just wondering why you were all getting drunk off your arses today, instead of last night?"
"This is a very long list, Pans," Blaise sighed.
Draco was pale, his face gray, and his eyes were dull and red-rimmed. His cheekbones were prominent, much more noticeable than the last time Harry had seen him. The skin was hanging off him, and the shadows under his eyes were dark. Harry had the strangest urge (

“I… I think so.” I choke out eventually.
I relax, and give her one of my smirks.

After a few minutes went by, Blaise stood up and walked over to Draco.
Fuck. I'm going to be a completely lost cause once I break up with Harry...

No joke.” Harry nodded, yet again, and then said, “It’s a fucked up system.” Angelina seemed glad that Harry agreed, and then said, “That it is.” She opened up a folder, and then said, “I think that you should read the files after you figure out whether their scent is compatible with yours.

We all sat in silence, which was quite unusual. I munched on some bacon, trying to will my headache away.
I had a goal. Make Dray see sense, and kick his bitchy ass. There was
“Uh-”
Harry looked up at me with the possibly most terrifying expression I’ve ever seen.
He didn't really notice when he left the Three Broomsticks, and walked down the streets, hands shoved deep in his coat pockets. His only intention was to go get drunk as hell, and hopefully forget about all of this. In the moment, he couldn't remember if he was a happy, snuggly drunk, or a sad, depressed drunk. His eyes darted to left, and then the right, and then back to the left, and the right again. He scanned the windows of the shops, looking for a sign of Harry, not even realizing that he was. He turned, pushing open the door to the Hog's Head. It was dark and dirty, and they windows were thick with grime. He walked in, and was comforted by the green and silver ties, and sat down at the bar.
I don’t have a shirt on, and I need to cover my mark.
Blaise told me about breakfast, and you've been crying and moping and lost in your own head! I don't even know what to do anymore! I have to leave today, I'm going to going to be at school for a week and at the hospital the next! How are you going to live without me?"
Draco, for me to except you at sixteen. No one has had the privilege of this for a
” I say, staring at him from across the table that we were seated at in the library.
I feel shock wash over me as I realize that he’s right. “Oh,
be called a ‘Maid of Honor’.
"Yeah."
Maybe I can feel better about this.
"Shake hands." Madam Hooch said, and Harry watched as the other Captain looked at him, waiting for him to stick his hand out. No way in
It's going to be the end of the Wizarding World if he comes to full power. So, uh, yeah. Sorry bro."
"I'm sorry about your sister, Pans. We'll miss you around here."
"Fresh Unicorn eye."
I don't think that I'll ever be warm again.
I'm sure your parents would just
My disgusting, fucking, badness will rub off on his innocent, pure, goodness.
I give him a look that says,
Just maybe.
I really,
Please don't hate me? (I'm a little upset with myself, tbh.) It's all part of my plan. (Which has 60 parts, btw.) (It took me forever to come up with a rough line for the story to follow.) Please, guys, REVIEW! It makes my fucking day! Also, I promise that it'll get bet soon. And there'll be fluff galore. (At least for a bit.) (Then some more angst, I guess.) Also, I'm very, very sorry for breaking Hermione and Pansy up, I'll fix them in a bit. I just need a few minutes of space. Maybe I'll throw in a bit of Ron and Hermione? Idk. Maybe I should just put Pansmione right back together again. Idk, guys, idk. Anyway, REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW!
Merlin’s fucking balls. Was that
And I'll be left with my parents and I will be a fucking follower of the person who is going to tear the world down for power and no will to live.
"Pansy! You should have told me! I would have listened to you! I'm going to miss you tons, yes,
No...
I’m trying, Dray. I really am. I’m pouring as much of my magic into you as I can, but the wounds are closing too slowly. Much too slowly. I’m going to pass out soon. This is too much.
Their need to fight, to run to
I still haven't changed my pajamas. Did I mention that they're Harry's? Well, I suppose I've been too suicidal to think about my pajamas.
But anyways, what ‘Mione and Pansy are doing reminds me of a time Draco was drunk.
I'm numb inside.
But that really wasn’t what Harry was thinking about. What he was think about was
"Whadya doin' 'ere, blondie? Ya're a Sly- Slyther- Sly-ther-in, righ'?"
"Thanks, Blaise."
Harry happened to notice that Draco's eye flickered worriedly over to him.
I snarled at him, and said, "No
I accidentally fell out of my bed, trying to get out. I stand up, groping around the nightstand for my glasses. I slip them on, and then find that I have a potion sitting on my desk. There’s also a note.
Draco always thought that it would be the other way around, if anything.
(If he finds out, that is.)

(See the end of the chapter for
Now he’s going to save me like he saves everyone, and I know that it’s not because he loves me. It’s because he saves everyone. It’s his thing. Huge savior complex. So it’s nothing personal. Just saving me because his conscience wouldn’t let him leave me here. It’d torture him. Again, it’s nothing personal.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa.
magazine. She's my little sister, who I spoiled and loved on. She was six. She looked enough like me that we could have been identical twins when I was her age...
She gives me the death glare.
Harry was pushing against them, straining himself, his anger telling him to punch the ferret into the floor, to scream words at him that would have made Mrs. Weasely have him stick a bar of soap in his mouth, to jinx him into next week, to leave him bleeding. To make him feel
This is like fucking torture.
His left arm, to be exact...) He recoils so quickly that if I had blinked I would have missed it. He walks even faster, and turns to the left, which is the way down to the Slytherin's common room. Pansy looks shocked, as the rest of us do, I'm sure. "What... what just happened..." I manage to choke out. Everyone turns their attention to me. "Mate, did you fight before he left?" "No!" I reply quickly, and then I feel something sink into my bones, like I've had a bucket of ice cold water dumped over my head. Draco, ignoring us... because of me? No...
*cough*
The quill floats up, and stays put.
Hermione paused.
“So, Harry, I was thinking.” ‘Mione paused to rub her temples, and then continued. “You should practice your wandless magic. It’s an amazing skill, and I would kill, well, not really, to be able to do that. I researched it a bit this morning, and only powerful wizards and witches are able to do it. It’s a rare skill, and I think that you should practice it. It’d be quite useful. It’s almost like casting a non-verbal spell. Speaking of which, have you guys been able to do those yet? I’ve got mine down.”
DRACO IS BACK
“Yes, Ronald,
What the fuck does she mean
“Yeah-”
” she shrieks viciously.
“Dammit,
He'll have to kill me.
Ron had his face on the table and wasn’t touching his food,  and Hermione wasn’t reading. Which says a lot.
A few third year girls were here, but no others.
Draco grabbed a sponge, dumped some soap on it, and started scrubbing his chest. He moved to his shoulders, and then down his right arm, and then to his left-
"Fuck yes."
” I practically shouted.
ticklish
Pansy moaned, shoving her face into ‘Mione’s shoulder.
“Blaise! You could have overdosed him! It said that a single drop would get full effects!”
I give him a look that clearly states
He stands up and runs out.
She squealed, and then said, “Do you guys want to sneak out to Hog’s Head tonight? We could celebrate, if you know what I mean.”
'Yeah. Next time we go to Hogsmeade, you bring a bag with your stuff, me with mine, and we leave. We leave Hogwarts, the magical world behind, start again, new lives, among Muggles! I could learn all their customs. Don't laugh, I could!'
A Death Eater whose name he didn't remember - Mulciber maybe? - came to his room. Harry followed him through the house, down some stairs. It was a big house, as he'd seen with Voldemort, maybe what they call a manor. But he had not seen anyone else than Voldemort and this man. Maybe it was maybe-Mulciber's manor?
"SLYTHERIN"
At least he'd tried.
"Er, may I have something to eat, and some water, please? I don't know when my last meal was but I'm kind of hungry."
'It's just unfair!'
"I understand it is not your wand, but wherever your wand is, we cannot get it back, now. Would you just try this one? If it doesn't fit, someone will go with you to Ollivander's."
'Hey!' Draco screamed while falling on his back. 'Why are you attacking me! It's true!'
"There you are, finally woken up! Let's see!" She took out her wand and cast some spells. Harry did not know what she was looking for, but she looked happy enough. "You" she said pointing to Ron. "Go tell professor Dumbledore."
They entered a room. There was a table, and that's all he could see in it. Before he could think of anything, such as 'What the **** is going to happen to me here?', he was pushed again, and put on the table. Why bother fighting? His last day on Earth, Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the hero of the magical world - he was sure to be about to die, fifteen years later - he resigned. He retired. The magical world would need another hero. Good luck to them. Defenceless, he couldn't do anything. The man tied him to the table, magically. Harry tried to move, just to see how strong the ties were. They were strong enough. He lied down. Nothing to say, nothing to do. His thoughts, that's all he had now. He thought of his friends. Of the Weasleys. Molly, she would be sad. He doubted Petunia would shed the smallest tear for him, but Molly? That pained him. Then he thought, maybe he'd finally join his parents. A bit early, but a slightly comforting thought. He would have liked to know what had happened to his friends. Maybe Voldemort would deign tell him, at the last minute?
Dumbledore joined his hands. He was looking at Harry. Harry, waited. He had many questions, but none came out. A thought was making its way in his mind, a thought he tried to ignore, but a thought he was starting to trust against his will. Dumbledore didn't believe him, and he did not trust "Miss Riddle".
"What is it, professor?" asked Harry, understanding that was what Dumbledore was waiting for.
It was not very difficult to make links and find explanations, but these explanations could not be real. Harry refused to believe it. Him? A girl? What had happened to him? Could anyone bother to explain anything? And "Riddle"? That was Voldemort's name, but why by Merlin would Harry be wearing this name? What was Voldemort's plan? And why was Dumbledore keeping the secret? Did Ron know? Harry looked at Dumbledore hoping for an answer, but instead Dumbledore wasn't saying anything. Something nearly imperceptible changed on Dumbledore's face. Harry felt something. He couldn't point it really, but he felt something, and that something was not nice. He felt uneasy. Dumbledore was looking right in his eyes. Harry didn't have anything to hide, so he was looking back, for a few seconds. He was really uneasy. He looked down, short of breath. What was that?
"Well, there was some incantation, and they made me drink a potion, and it hurt. I can't tell you anything else about the spell or the potion. Then I blacked out and woke up in the hospital wing. That's it."
The man barely gave him a look. He pushed him in the back. 'We're nearly there, don't worry about small talk boy.'
They walked out of the Room, only to come back a few seconds later to find it had changed into a very cozy nook, with a seemingly natural light. It felt safe. It was Harry's idea of a normal evening, in the life they could have had, if only everything was different. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him next to him on the couch. Draco naturally intertwined one of his legs with one of Harry's and rested his head on Harry's.
'Oh shut uuup!'
'Hmmm I'd kidnap them. And then I would… make sure you couldn't tell anyone else.'
Soon they got to the gargoyle, Dumbledore gave the password and on they went. It was all silent. The walk had passed without a word being uttered. Harry felt more and more uneasy with every second passing by. Finally he sat at the desk, on Dumbledore's invitation.
'It was too sweet.'
Professor McGonagall took the hat back and Harry sighed. He looked at Slytherin's table, and then got up because he did not want his former Head of House to grow too impatient. She could take the stool away and go sit down. He did not have to run to Slytherin's table, and he did not. But he did go. Against all his will. When he was about to sit at the end of the table, Malfoy stood up and smiled at him. At her. Malfoy smiled at Riddle. It was a weird sight to hold, Harry thought, Malfoy's smile directed toward him. Oh, it wasn't a so friendly smile, more like a politician smile, but it was quite different to what he was used to. Knowing his life in Slytherin would be easier if he had Draco on his side, he walked to Malfoy, and shook the hand offered.
Again, Dumbledore looked right in his eyes. Again, Harry did not feel at ease with this piercing look. Again, he ended up looking away. The box was very simple, quite boring, but he'd rather look at it a whole month than in Dumbledore's eyes one more second.
Harry pulled out his best fake smile, one of those he had to make for the Dursleys, and sat next to Malfoy. The rest of the evening happened, somehow, but you wouldn't want to count on Harry to tell you how. When he lied down in his new bed, in a dormitory under the lake, trying to fall asleep, it was as if he'd only blinked. He had shaken Malfoy's hand, sat down, and then he was in his new dorm, or rather Isobel's. It was very dark, and green. No window to look at the park through. The only window looked onto the lake, and sometimes one could catch a sight of a merfolk or another of the creatures inhabiting the Dark Lake. No way Hedwig would find her way to him there.
'A complaint to express, maybe?' Harry laughed.
'Oh that's only for you. Nobody else can know.'
"I could go in more details, I guess, but that's pretty much it. I was locked in a bedroom with only books, no window. He told me about the Death Eaters, but I don't remember much of that. Sorry. I didn't think I'd get out to tell you, actually. And then, the last evening, there was someone else, and he told me I would not die, but that Harry Potter would not be my name anymore, and that's it."
'Is this your house?' he tried, as they turned in another corridor.
He was having soup when Dumbledore appeared.
"Do you understand, Harry?"
"Yes, sir." he answered, resigned.
"Hmm!"
"Glad to know someone recognises me!" Harry thought, smiling.
'How?'
"We will see that later. Do you remember something else, something you might have forgotten to say?"
"Welcome in Slytherin Riddle! I am Draco Malfoy, your Prefect, and I'm in Fifth year too. Please, sit with us."
"Good afternoon, miss Riddle."
"Excuse me?!"
If he were to share his thoughts, Harry would say this was now the moment where he was about to - finally - die. But nobody invited him to talk, so he remained silent. He had no wand, did not know where exactly he was, nor when. He had rarely felt more pointless.
"Alright, er, I'm not sure I can give you anything. Just wait two sec!" Ron went to look out, probably for Pomfrey Harry guessed. Except he did not disappear long, and went back quickly, walking backward with Madam Pomfrey already coming.
Some music was playing in the background, from an invisible player.
Draco put his hand around Harry's face and pulled him down to kiss him. Harry answered most willingly. Laughs echoed in the room, only for them to hear…
"Good."
"But-"
Harry had opened his mouth to say hello, ready to ask many things: how long he'd missed, how he'd come back to Hogwarts, what had happened to his vision, whether he knew what was wrong with his voice. This greeting stopped all these questions at once.
