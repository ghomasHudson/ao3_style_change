"Are you still resented because Draco didn't join you on a date a year and a half ago?" she asks me, her eyes glinting with evil.
Well, I don’t know the real answer like Mione do. But I did my homework back in seventh year.
I hope you can enjoy this one. I was a step away from crying when I ended this chapter, I think is a throat infection effect.
"Who is your Auror parent?" asks a plump man.
"Ah, you mean Draco Malfoy," she says dismissively and immediately put each hand on the shoulders of each of my children.
The remaining members of the orchestra take their seats and I listen to a typical London tune: Seventy-Six Trombones. Teddy doesn't stop bouncing on my tights. Hermione offers the little wizard a pacifier, and Teddy immediately opens his mouth to start biting the rubber with his gums.
"Are you going to eat that, mate?" he asks Harry, looking at said guy's fries.
"This is the Cancer treatment wing, Harry," I tell him, trying to keep the tears at bay. “Magdy was here for a few years. It was difficult, but we survived. As a way of showing their affection, my friends in the orchestra decided to do a little concert one Christmas, just so Magdy could see me before I was eight. And we never let tradition go. During these dates we distribute ourselves between the hospitals of the city, and we bring all the joy we can, before one of them dies."
“Is he awake yet,” Hermione ask me while I pull together a simple breakfast. Winky helping me to fry the bacon.
Hermione nods excitedly.
Left kuddos and comments, those makes my day.
"Nothing," I say, returning his smile. "I love you."
I roll my eyes just remembering what kind of a dick was Gilliard Goldenheart and his obnoxious father. I was a little shit towards Harry back when we were at school. But, Gilliard Goldenheart… He was a fucking walking nightmare since Elemental School and his father. Ewwwk.
"You're wasting no time, Potter," one of the Extraction guys tells me, looking at the photograph of the Prophet. The last thing the Dray in the picture does is stand on the toes of his shoes and left a kiss on Photography-Harry's lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's right, my partner is Muggle," I reply to Kingsley, wondering what he is trying to accomplish with this. "How do you know?"
“That’s the part that makes no sense at all,” he says breathing deeply, trying to swallow his own sobs. “They knew what I did at the end,” he says, his voice wet with unshed tears. “They knew about what I did. That’s the only reason why they…”
The letters are glowing now, a shade of sad and dull grey.
“Nothing too much, dear nephew. Just a new…” she stops to think. “Improvements. So, you can stop doing the muggle stuff with the muggle apparatus that makes music. That’s so unbecoming of a powerful being like you. Because you are not even human. You are a freak that have magic, but can’t do magic really. You are a little freak that is so old, and yet… So slow.”
I shuddered. Last night something extrange happened and Voldemort was able to enter my mind. And I poked into his. His cold, hard and cruel mind.
I smile softly remembering the amount of trouble I used to drag Hermione and Ron into. The number of times Voldemort tried to kill me within these walls. And the number of times my best friends ran to my rescue.
HARRY
"Because of the little girl, Arabella," I say. "She was sick. Terminal sick."
“Because I know family is not an easy topic for you,” he says, caressing the spot he kissed a few seconds ago. “And I want you forever happy.”
"Panis Angelicus?" however, I am not quite sure and that is reflected in my voice.
Aberforth Dumbledore.
January 2
What a twisted life.
I shrug my shoulders.
And the most beautiful sound escapes from the lips of the silver-eyed blonde.
"Not really. It's not about how you plan an attack, is about how you keep your cool while someone else is attacking you. How you can plan the counter attack while defending yourself," his fingers plays with mine and I feel happy.
"Hey, is that your doing?" I ask him, looking at how the whole room is destroyed to levels that I'm not sure I can fix with my next-to-useless house cleaning spells.
Hannah's words leave me cold. That is not an acceptable thing for my husband.
“I am using my sense of smell because I am a werewolf,” he says seriously. “And through the full moon, while being high on Wolfsbane, I smell a few things Fleur left in the basement and I listen to Victoire’s clinking toys…” He stops talking suddenly. “I am anchoring myself with things that remind me of the people I love the most through my most dangerous self.”
Enjoy with coffee or something as hot as that and a muffin.
"Benjamin Bones could have made fun of the birthday cake the twins sent me for my birthday," he said, taking a bite out of his triangle.
Draco separates from me.
I shake my head gently. Pacience blooming in my chest.
"It is when a person has no husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend," I say calmly and Scorpius laughs.
“He is being warded by five houses of wizards,” I murmur to him softly.
Draco’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, even if we are in the middle of August. He sits up too fast, and a dizzy spell hits me, making him topple to my side of the bed.
"Harry," Draco tells me.
"Then, thing got complicated because purebloods never let their kids wander around Mungo's." Ron murmur and I feel a bit sorry about that. "So, there is not much on their healing records. Even their Hogwart's ones are next to bare."
"Harry," there is something in Dray's voice that makes me pause in the preparation of our drinks, to rest my eyes on him. “I thought about putting a little tree in the room. But…” Dray blushes furiously and his fingers begin to play with the hem of my sweater. My sweater. Dray is mine. "I used the wooden stick that Albus gave me and I just wanted to levitate a couple of Christmas balls and..." And he lowered his beautiful face. And when he looks up again, I can see how the blush begins to travel up his neck. "Everything started to levitate, and they're still levitating... The balls for the tree, I mean," he tells me in a serious tone, but his cheeks are still stained red.
I stop again.
“Who’s this diary?” I ask him, remembering second year and the Chamber of The Secrets.
My universe is fine. Everything is going to get okay.
"You are so perfect, Dray," I whisper against his ear and he shudders, a needy moan reverberating around my fingers. "So beautiful and so perfect."
Maybe a few more.
I turn on my heel, trying to engrave in my memory the image that my eyes have just witnessed. Trying to engrave it for all eternity with fire in my heart.
“You may not like this, Harry, but they are searching for ways to turn me Rogue,” he whispers, his voice is barely there. “Argenti are known as dark creatures because must of those were turned rogue. He is going to turn me into a weapon and I refuse to be the one to deliver the final blow for your own death.”
"Hey Henry," the barista tell me, giving me a smile.
Once we're back in the hall, I smile at the blonde-haired witch.
"He's Harry, Vanya," but, he doesn't specify anything else. "Hot chocolate for me and a Happy Day of your Death, for Harry," he says to the woman with his eyes shining with... wickedness?
"I only know that all children have a magic tracker and it tells the ministry where an event has been held that includes accidental magic outside of Hogwarts." He pauses and I look directly at the name of Bellatrix Lestrange. "The only place in the whole of the UK where minors can do magic is Hogwarts," Ron tells me and his eyes shines with understanding. "I'm going to the International Magical Cooperation Department." Ron tells me, as he puts on his Auror's robe and adjusts his wand in his forearm.
the letters forms and fades. I can see hesitation inside his eyes, his posture is all wrong and he is subtlety nibbing his lower lip.
"No, the boy is on the balcony talking to a piece of black square," everyone looks at me, even Arthur.
The door opens and I see Mrs. Weasley enter through it. She looks at me with her blue eyes full of pain and I quickly nod, because I can't deny this to her. Not her, who has loved me as her own son since the day she met me.
"It is..." and all the children look at each other, while some scream with excitement. "It's... a marsupial!"
I smile behind my hand. Kingsley Shackletbolt is a fucking genious.
I hope you can enjoy and forgive me for the delay. It is a bit hard with all the rain that's falling in the country.
"That you need more friends?" he says sincerely. Curiosity distilling from each word.
“Bathroom and walking closet,” I say to her and I don’t care really.
"And ..." Draco presses, taking one of Teddy's hands.
"Brainiac, me?" he points his thumb at himself and I see him deny quickly.
I roll my eyes deeply and run my hand through my hair, from my forehead to the nape of my neck.
Naggini looks at me, like she's challenging me. But unfortunately she cannot do for our Lord what I can. She cannot make him win this war. At least not like I can do it. Naggini is nothing more than a small snake that she cannot protect herself. A little snake that needs protection.
“He can be sick,” I say again. “He is a potion master,” actually, he is the only safe bet the Ministry have. No one is as smart as Draco Malfoy in potions. A little prodigy, the Prophet said once, along with the same line as Torturer. “Something could have gone wrong and he could have faint. Potions do that to people.”
“Harry Potter,” Greyback smiles back at me and I feel a shiver running down my back. “Maybe, were you here looking for the moon child too?”
"Hagrid is different, Harry," Hermione tells me in a serious tone. “He is a half giant. Giants are not magical creature or wizards. They are just another form of humans with a little low intellect when it comes to being in the city, but very intelligent left in their natural habitat, like any other living creature. "
OCTOBER 27th, 2002
Hemione hums her positiveness and I try to keep walking forward in the middle of the woods.
That was the night I made the decision to stop being a victim of the world and be a hero to the world. Not for the world, but for me. Because I wanted to keep dating this guy and keep listening to his laugh and know his mind, body and soul as if it were my own, and let everything good that exists inside him change everything bad that is inside me, and it will heal the pain that years and years of abuse left in my heart.
"Blaise Zabini, Reena Shacklebolt and myself," Hermione tells us seriously.
“I want to tell you, Harry,” I say softly, waiting for the lights of this sacred garden to start dancing, like the first time I was here with Harry. “That I obliterated Bellatrix’s soul. I have no idea how I did it, but I felt free in that instant. The one that was with her was starting to be corrupted by the selfish desired Voldemort put in him. It was such a shame, because he could’ve been more. Now, he is not.”
“Yes,” I say softly, not even sure what I am saying yes to.
Draco discovers Harry is a wizard. Harry discovers whom Dray's father is.
"Uh ..." Dray says softly, his cheeks turning red. "Sorry Harry, I didn't..."
Dray nods softly, his eyes turning a lighter shade. I'm sure this isn't the first time I've seen them change color in seconds. Or in spirits...
Does Dray think I look stupid wearing a tie?
And even though I'm hanging on to every word Dumbledore says, I can hear footsteps in the distance, coming from the staircase that connects this floor to the one above.
His cheeks are flushed to a painful level. And I capture his lips between mine.
Date, Harry, this time is a date.
"It was never our intention for any of you to find out in this way that Draco Black is alive," Zephora Zambroni's voice echoes through the room and I can feel the terror within me. "Or what he is." She is not someone you want to piss off. "Much less that the bond between young Potter and Dray forgging under such an aberrational situation." Zephora opens her eyes and I can see the white of her iris contrasting with the brown skin of her slender body.
"Exactly, because I studied at Aiglon," Dray tells him.
I nod and I let my self feel better, surrounded by the love of my best friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
Enjoy with warm milk and cookies.
Her body is mangled and bloodied but she is still alive. I know her because she is the sister of Theodore Nott, my own nemesis and the only child to ever took the dark mark. The same kid that was murdered by Voldemort himself so his family can be absolved of whatever shit was happening at the moment.
"Santa Claus doesn't exist," the memory-Harry says to the blonde again. "It's just something parents make up for kids to behave."
"And what are you going to call it?" he asks her, while he conjures a blanket and puts a thick blanket over her.
"I lived in France," says Zephora. "My late house was in..."
There’s no fucking way in hell I can forget about that night. Draco was spying with Severus for that moment. Days after we found the cup of Hufflepuff. It was chaos and Voldemort were as angry as always, but worst. He wasn’t acting reasonably and a quarter of his Death Eater ended dead in a whim of their master.
I laugh softly, as I sit on the couch, although it could very well be a cloud, with how soft it is. I take a sip of my drink and immediately all my taste buds come back to life. It is sweet, but at the same time it has a bitter touch that makes it taste like a piece of heaven.
Green garlands with red balls adorn the mantle of the chimney, red cushions with the letters LOVE are arranged on the armchairs, and a huge red blanket with gold edges is on the back of the largest armchair. Soft pale brown furniture contrasting with the red, gold and green of the decorations. The whole room seems to glow under the light of lights that are in different parts of the room.
"Do you think Narcissa could have had contact with her family from her mother?" Hermione asks.
I put on my gloves and stick the jacket of the aurors to my body, while I put on a coat for the infernal cold that it is burning my bones. I can feel the cold once I leave the office and even though I am still inside the Ministry. I close my eyes briefly, trying to retain my magic within me and remind myself of the reasons why I like Kingsley Shacklebolt alive and not dead, even though what he has done has felt like a direct threat to my soul mate.
“Now the word is exotic,” my Father mumbles.
I nod softly, then it strikes me that she can barely see me in the middle of the night and I hum my answer.
Less suffocated, less unstable.
I take a deep breath, trying to contain my nerves. After all, I'm not this brat's boyfriend. But Harry is... And if I don't do this right, the brat is going to get mad, and if the brat gets mad, Harry gets mad, and if Harry gets mad Molly gets mad.
"I didn't mean it that, love," I tell him, taking his face in my hands, and wiping away the remaining tear trails. “You are not invalid, but you are hurt. And the least I want is for you is for this to get worst. I know cramps are normal, but the doctor said not to try too hard. Dray, I need you by my side and I need you safe and sound."
His presence seems to command the attention of everyone in the room and I find myself with my gaze glue to his frame.
“What’s wrong?” I ask him, leaning on him, the Patronus ready on my tongue in case I need Smart-Healer and Goldstein.
"So he has magic inside him," I whisper. "He is not a squib," I say in a louder voice.
"You made my first wooden horse," Dray tells him. "And then my little music box, when I graduated from kindergarten. My lamp when I went to The King's College and my cello,” Dray tells him. "My cello has your name on it, in the back of the neck."
And the owl takes off for Hogwarts. Deep down I hear Draco throw an enchantment at our children, a soft tergeo to clean their faces and hands.
The pain doesn’t stop.
Harry nods and a smile falls on his lips.
"He wouldn’t hurt Draco," Parkinson tells me, while lifting something heavy off the floor with her wand. "Maybe this he was working onto some potion?"
I see Robards sigh and then his gaze moves to the other side of the room and his eyes are right on the body of the unspeakable's head.
"No, Papa loves me too." James says sulkily.
However, I'm don't mind his attitude and I bend over to capture his lips between mine, a brief second of magnificent joy. And when I pull away, Draco's eyes are still closed, lost in the moment. His cheeks flushed, showing his affection.
My hands are itching to touch him. I look into his eyes and I can feel his pinky finger interlocking with mine.
"Moon-haired human in pain," Nesha hisses. "Snake human, help moon-haired human."
“You are going to let him free around the manor?” I ask in a soft voice.
"Hello Luna," I say with a smile on my lips. It's always good to see Luna. "How have you been?"
The door opens suddenly and a shield of shadows is over us.
She bites her lip and I know this is not going to be all flowers and sunshine.
“Why did we wake up in the same bed?” I ask, feeling lightheaded. Stupid courage floating back at me.
“Whatever you need,” I whisper to him, because we have a conference press to release.
"This is not right," Hermione tells me. "We need to tell Kingsley that we found Draco Black."
"Love," however, I can't say more, when I feel the whole room around us darken and the magic grows stronger.
Harry looks down and I can see the tiredness in his face.
“I will do as you want, Master Severus,” I say dutifully.
But, the blazing-red of new letters are blinding enough for Smart-Healer to shut up.
“How is he?” Hermione asks me while extending a hot cup of coffee for me to take.
I was thinking hard about cutting open a vein or something, and then Linking Park blasted on my sound system and I felt good enough to come gift you all with a 3000 words chapter.
"Well, I'd look for things that smell awful, as long as it ensures that you and that little guy eat enough to be healthy, both of you," he says and takes a plate full of puree and fish with lots of sauce.  "Just be healthy," Regulus says to Narcissa, setting the plate on her lap and stroking the woman's cheek. “I will take care of you both. Always."
"Draco," she whispers softly. “If it's a boy, his name will be Draco. And if it is a girl, it will be called Adhara,” she says softly. "But, for all the trouble it gives me at night, hI am sure its name will be Draco for sure." Says the black-haired woman with affection. "And the tradition will continue, Regulus."
"Hello again, little Dray," the headmaster says as if greeting an old friend, and I force myself to remember that yes, Albus Dumbledore and Dray Black have known each other for many decades, prior to this. "I trust that Harry has already explained what you are."
I nod, softly.
“I promise you this, Mister Dark Lord,” I say to him. “I will never serve to you or your nefarious plans to kill innocent people. Did you ever do your homework about Argenti?” Zephora, the woman that took me away form my house, my daughter and my boyfriend is standing at my left.
"And when will I be able to listen to your work?" I ask him, feeling curious.
“I think I will find something of my liking,” my smirk sharpens. “If you have a dick to match your ass, I surely would find something to look at.”
“Don’t worry, I will do the same to that boyfriend of yours,” she cackles and then she is gone.
HERMIONE
“What was it?” I ask her, taking my own plate out of Winky’s hands and going to sit in front of them, while Winky hands them both their own plates. Bread, fried bacon, cheese and eggs all over the plates.
I carefully open the door to the children's room and see the twins in the same bed, back to back, head to head. They both need a haircut soon. I approach them and put a kiss on their heads, thinking that they are a perfect Yin and Yan. My little universe.
"I'm horrible," he tells me and pouts. His gray eyes filling with tears. “I have scars, and I am so pale and thin. I am the most hideous person in the universe. And you are still the sexiest in the world." And his lips pout.
"Come back from the darkness, Cissy," Kinsgley says, dripping Dray's blood onto the painting. The reddish liquid glows silver for a few seconds and then the canvas sucks it up until it is as good as new.
"Do you remember me now?" the wandmaker asks him.
"When did you three took that?" I ask the children.
"I'm Dray," he says, closing the distance between himself and the redhead. I swallow deeply, when the boy's blue eyes turn as gray as a stormy day. What the fuck?
Without thinking twice I attack his neck with my lips and hear him moan obscenely. My cock is quite awake now, filling inside my pants.
"I need you to understand something tonigth, Harry," he tells me, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. When his orbs reopen I can see they change color every second. Gray, blue, purple, green, light blue... What the hell is happening to Dray?
Enjoy with popcorn, because this is the path to madness.
December 29
I chuckle.
"No, Harry," I tell myself. "You want him for the way he is, not for the fabulous sex that has ruined you for anyone else." I nod decided and finish spooning myself quickly.
The teenager laughs at the twins' occurrences.
I let my parent’s voices lulled me and I close my eyes, just feeling everything around me. My next door neighbor’s cat is mewling softly in the window sill, and the warm sun is hitting me in the face from the window. A soft breeze is passing and playing with my hair and I feel oddly alive.
Smart-Healer massage her temples, she exhales like if she is conjuring patience from somewhere.
I feel my entire body compress, vanish and then reassemble and when I open my eyes I can see that we are in an alley.
"Why?" I ask, interested in learning about this phase of Harry's life.
Kingsley nods to her softly and she takes a step forward.
This is Draco having hope and my hear throbs inside my heart for whatever it is to come at him. I squeeze his hands softly with my thumb. A silent gesture of comprehension and companionship.
"Oh, the enormous one," he answers me taking the little hamburger between his long fingers. "And the soda is yours, too."
“He will take down five Horcruxes,” she says. “You will take down two. The last Horcrux is in the Ravenclaw common room.”
"He is a squib!" the cup that I left on the table shattered spontaneously. “You have no idea what something like that spell can do to a human. You had no right to cast an enchantment on him. I brought Dray here because Rowle almost hit him with a Cruciatus when he saw him with me yesterday morning, I thought he would be safe here. I believed that good people would protect him. I thought… ”
I turn my attention back to the children and see them smile as they finish inhaling their breakfasts.
"He's ready for us to wake him up, briefly," someone in the room murmurs.
“That will eradicate humans,” I whisper to her, unable to find my own voice right now.
Hugs,
"Enough games, honey," I bite hard where his neck meets his shoulders and I hear him groan. Draco tries to separate himself from me as the pace becomes faster and more punishing, his hand reaching for his cock. And without thinking, I take his wrists with my hands, and I carry them behind my husband's back. Trying to glue our bodies together again “No love, no hands. You're going to come just from this."
And immediately Hermione nods.
But, she looks at me like if I am some kind of stupid moron.
Dray gives me a smile, his slander, elegant hands on the car trunk.
A sick person, who is not interested in anything, Draco, was what Harry told me a couple of nights ago in the bathroom of our room. A magician who uses magic to torture muggles, witches, and dark creatures simply because he feels he can.
"Ouch," I complain because it's the proper thing to do at a time like this.
Potter is going to raise hell and something else.
I nod softly, walking over to the bed, preparing myself for whatever is it to come. I can feel my own muscles tensing, my anxiousness skyrocketing. I shake Draco gently, since talking to him is not an option anymore. This is going to be our ritual for the seeable future.
I smirk.
(See the end of the chapter for
“If something fails… Do you know if you could die?” she whispers softly. “And with you, Harry too?”
Well, here is another chapter. This one was a bit late due to concerts and conerts and being at the Studio recording like crazy.
Draco tries to contain his laughter at our twins' attempts to write, but fails with dignity.
"Most likely kidnapped by Death Eaters," I hear Moon mumbling.
"Teddy, elbows off the table," Draco tells him, in a serious tone and I even check that my elbows are not resting on the table. Afterwards, my gaze falls on all my children and it is the funniest scene. The three of them are looking at each other, trying to figure out if the other has any other bad posture and I see them sigh in relief when they realize they are okay.
Hair as white as snow and eyes as blue as a summer day. Immediately, his hand closes over Harry's and the biggest smile I've ever seen on a human appears on the new boy's lips.
Hermione looks at me seriously and I can hear the gears in her brain shifting disproportionately.
What a bunch of cowards.
"He's ... he's just a boy I met some time ago," I tell him and I'm not sure my voice is the strongest right now.
"Harry," she tells me, following in my footsteps and pulling something out of his pockets. "This is Draco's," she smiles at me and hands me Draco's wedding ring. "I'll give you ten minutes to tell him, until tomorrow." She tells me and walks away.
I need to be ready to protect my soulmate.
Magic is sucking me, reacting to whatever is happening at the moment. And when I land, I can feel all my blood draining from my face.
"Yes there was," Hermione tells her. "It's just not a conventional wand."
Hannah smiles softly at me and nods.
I look at my watch again and indeed, it is eleven at night. However, something feels… Wrong. I pull out my wand and grasp it tightly between my fingers, while letting my magic escape. I go upstairs and the first place I go to is James' room. Usually it's Scorp who sneaks into his twin's room at some point in the night to sleep back to back, feet to feet, head to head.
"I need food for a baby Occamy," I tell her, looking at the cages and remembering Hedwig.
"Teddy, no," I tell the little wizard in a playful whisper, as I hug him and pull him away from the lady's hand. "I am sorry," I tell her and she just smiles at me.
"Are you still stuck with the thought that all that looks good on you is your old school uniform?" she asks me with a mischievous smile.
“You live with him, so…” he hasn’t started when I feel the need to stop him.
I feel fear inside me. His eyes are shinning like a rose moon. A bad omen. The omen of the end of the everything.
"I'm like M.I.6," Hermione looks at Harry, like she's asking him something and the boy just shrugs. "But, for the magic."
"Riddle is not a pure-blood surname," Ron tells him after a moment. “The wizarding world is not that big here in Britain. It's like Zephora said, families here don't mix well with other creatures, which makes us a very small society. Compared to the magical population in America, we are an almost extinct group. To some extent all wizards in the UK are related."
“I cannot make him go away, because whomever cursed you, place them inside your head,” I whisper to him. “I think we are gonna have to leave with them for a while until you are all better.”
“Is he ok?” she asks me, waving her wand this way and that.
“I love you too, Weasley-Son,” he says and I let the warm engulf my heart, looking up to the soft, non-competitive and foolish quidditch game that is unfolding in front of my eyes. “Don’t you ever forget Harry Potter, honorary Weasley, this is your family and we forever will love you.”
"It feels warm," I tell her, trying to put words to what I feel on my chest. However, Hermione touches it like she's looking for the nonexistent tree fever. “It feels like… I don't know. It's strange. It feel like him."
I see Albus nod from the corner of my eye and I watch him advance until he is by my side.
Dray nods softly, trying not to jolts Nesha, while trying to keep my pillows in a steady stack.
“What is the mean of this?” she asks eying the clothes there.
The afternoon passes peacefully, while the orchestra continues to perform music from each European country and the audience applauds with each of the pieces performed, some people get up to dance, and Ron and Hermione dance a waltz together and I am happy to know who are enjoying themselves, forgetting for a moment the imminent war that awaits us in the magical world.
"Why cry moon haired human?" Nesha asks me, spreading its body and hitting its head against the blonde's cheek.
"Is Dray sick?" I ask Nesha, picking her up off the floor, as I watch her curl into my hand and start walking towards the living room of the house.
"Hello, brother," Regulus greets him from afar, scanning the entire room with his eyes. "Where's my brat?"
Draco
(See the end of the chapter for
And I rush to get into a fireplace before anyone else has time to hold me back. I think about my destiny and the fireplace spits me out in a place I've never been before.
So, I do as Harry tells me and I lean into him, avoiding to touch the black orb hovering over his chest. Until the sensation of his astral body is all faded and I open my eyes to be meet with a room full of bright spots everywhere and threads of gold magic.
I lean across the table and left a kiss on Harry's cheek. Ron turns red and Hermione looks at me like I'm the president myself.
I pull away from his chest and raised an eyebrow.
“Do that again,” the healers say and I poke Draco in his other cheek.
But this is Auror’s protocol.
"A rogue," someone whispers at my right.
However, before I can release them...
"I told you just that before yesterday, yesterday and that's what I told you just now," he says, unimpressed. "Now, Auror Potter," he tells me once we are both in the room. "Undress."
"Are you threatining me, brat?" his voice is a low growl. "I have years figthing Wizards that are worst then you."
I enter the room followed by the nurse and my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, while I see my husband lying on the bed. I carefully approach his body and refrain from touching him. However, I feel a tear run down my cheek and my eyes itch. He's bloodied and too pale. My husband is sick pale.
I nod softly, trying to glue us together.
That got my attention immediately.
"Harry," I extend my hand and he receives it. "Harry Potter."
"This is Dray Black, Kingsley," I tell him in a serious tone. "The son of Narcissa Black."
“I don’t think Voldemort will massacre a place where his great death eaters are being kept, Mione. Not even him that much people to spare. Magical population are just as much people as a small town can take,” he says. “There aren’t enough wizards in his side. Not with policies as crazies as his.”
“Not at you, never at you,” I say to her. “Just to whomever took your daddy,” I say to her. Because right now, I don’t have a daughter. She is the asset’s daughter. Not mine. Not now.
"Andromeda Tonks?" I hear him ask, like he wants to make sure it's the correct name.
"We are not assigning the case to you, Mr. Moon," Robbards says in a serious and unfriendly tone. "I'm assigning it to Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley." And with that I know that this case is ours and it will be difficult as hell.
"It was just a bug," she tells me softly, starting off again. "Who is the boy that came with you?" she asks me, looking in the direction where Dray is playing with a snake.
NOVEMBER 6th, 2002
Ron looks at me and immediately writes the name next to that of Bellatrix Lestrange and under the name of Sirius the words "Guilty For Treason". I force myself to bite my tongue and not make a mess out of this, although my chest hurts a little because, despite the years, I still have not been able to clear Sirius' name. But, I feel glad for he must be at the moment in one of the Order's houses, somewhere in the world, magical or non-magical. He's still alive and I feel grateful for it. "Don't forget Regulus, Sirius' baby brother."
Greeney.
I just cuddle against they both, trying to enjoy my free Saturday. Draco is laughing at something and Nesha is flapping her wings once in a while to keep her balance. She pushes her little head against Dray’s neck and his fingers travel up to caress her scales.
"Because ..." I try to invent something that doesn't reveal Teddy.
“Venom of Basilisc,” I murmur to him. He shakes his head. “The diary was never destroyed, was it?” I ask him.
"No," he tells me, while taking a deep breath. “The seal could only be broken when the time was right, and I'm sure it's not yet because its magic pulse was as light as that of a fetus. However,” and he bites his lip. "When he met his soulmate the seal would break, trying to be magically worthy with his other half."
"Dad wasn't lying when he said you worked in 'Controling hysterical crowds,'" Dray tells him, as he walks around the room, his eyes staring at everything.
I stop in my tracks.
"We're still searchin' that though, 'cause Daddy never missing a piece of face," James says seriously. “So we don't understand how Papa can like something that you can't eat. Because wizards don't eat other wizards. But, aunt ‘Mione is never wrong. So there must be something."
"That's because she made a demeaning comment about Draco this morning, the twins seemed to take it well," I tell him in a serious tone.
I can see Harry’s favorite blanket when he was a toddler and his whale of a cousin. I can hear his giggles of joy whenever he is swinging in the park’s swing set. His little hands closing around an old toy, maybe passed down from his selfish cousin. I can feel a soft hand between an endless sea of pain. The hand of a person Harry feels sad to see. I can feel his joy when discovering of his heritage as a wizard and his peace when he arrives at Hogwarts. I can see him trying to practicing Winguardium Leviosa and Lumos.
“Legilimens,” I whisper and then there are.
“I cannot promise you that, Mione,” I say to her.
"Dray," the male voice causes Dray to turn in the direction of the sound. And I see how the man extends his hand to the blonde. "Excellent work today," he says, shaking the blond's hand. "Take care of these little hands, I doubt that there are others like them around here," says the man, shaking his hand one last time and releasing him.
“But you cannot kill him,” I whisper/yell to him.
The aroma of hot chocolate with peppermint filling the atmosphere, while my heart swells with pride, knowing that I am changing someone's life. And when I lift my eyes and meet Harry's green ones, I know this is the perfect place to forgive, to heal… To change.
"He's fine. He is just sorry," I tell Nesha. "Can you help her?" I ask Hagrid and immediately the half-giant nods and ushers us into his house.
"Are they all magicians?" ask the room.
And when the doors open, I can see the little quintet already there.
“The world wishes that. But no,” she replies. “A lot of Death Eaters have roots in France, Germany and Italy. From what our spies has gathered while being undercover, Voldemort is planning to take over all Europe for the Wizards to bind to his very whim.”
“Or the kitchen,” I say, making room for Parkinson to go out. “Potions is similar to cooking.”
Neville Longbottom was born at the end of July too. I was born hours apart from Neville, not a fucking whole day.
I take several deep breaths, trying to reign over my emotions. Zephora looks at me with her eyes open, a rare occurrence these days.
“Is this out yet?” I ask Kingsley.
After all, I'm not one of the most wanted thanks to the way Lucius Malfoy faked my innocence a couple of years ago. Patience, said the Dark Lord. Lucius will fix it, were one of the last words he whispered through the brand that unites us. And Lucius fixed it.
Dray's hand stops on one, but his head shakes gently.
The power of learning how to take my Asset back, the Original's soulmate.
“He bears in his being the strength of a lot of houses. You must remember Patsy: The house of Black, the house of Rosier, the house of Avery, the house of Malfoy and… The house of Prince,” I repeat to him, feeling my magic going highwire inside me.
And the little lamia, the son of the vampires that can be exposed to the sun without dying, welcomes me. She is still in the clothes they required in her school. Red skirt and white shirt with a black vest.
"Is he going to be ok?" Parkinson asks to Goldstein, her voice cracking a bit.
Scorpius steps forward, fills his chest with air, and his cheeks are puffing too, then he let the air out and look at the boy.
"What does this have to do with Voldemort?" asked them.
“You are a really talkative pet,” she says softly, smiling and showing me all her yellowing teeth.
I love when people say HI. Please, left a comment or a kuddo, they make my day all better.
I open my eyes and the first thing I see is Dray's head hidden by my side. His almost white hair reflecting the faint sunlight streaming through the window. His skin is no longer bluish, but a bit more human, and when my hand rests on his forehead I can feel the heat coming, washing over me like a calming wave.
Dray's gray eyes stare at me and I can see the storm raging inside him. Four days ago I built Dray's magic while we were making love… And the next day, in our apartment, Zephora, Regulus and Albus were ready to launch questions and demand answers, that not even we understood or has an answer to.
"Dray," I say softly. "Dray, it's just a nightmare. You have to wake up now. ”
I smile at Robards.
“Riddle isn’t a fan of destroying wizards, Dray,” I caress his cheeks softly, trying to commit to memory this feeling of warm. “He likes to destroy muggles, like Magdy, because they are defenseless and vulnerable against magic,” I whisper to him. “And I cannot just stand looking from the sides when I can be there helping save someone’s life.” He looks up at me with tears in his eyes. “Just like you just cannot stop from helping people. And I love for that, because that you.”
I swallow hard. I look at Parkinson and she seems paler.
"And what are your names?" another girl asks, her eyes on her notebook.
I open my eyes and look at my two best friends.
Then, his face is relaxing a bit.
Slytherin descendants were born with it.
“As you can see, dear Severus, the young Argentum is too greedy,” he says. “I think Bella broke him, even wen I told her to be soft with the child. But, you know Bella,” he pauses. “Always using her brute magic. In someone so young, I think it was bound to break his mind. She uses way too much legilimens with nothing to extract, just moments with Potter and more moments with Muggles. I am hundred percent sure that Dray here, doesn’t know how to use magic.”
What the hell was Zabini doing to end up without a part of his arm? Unspeakables are not this tacky.
There are tables with food, desserts, cheeses, drinks and… Many children.
"Harry," Fleur's voice, strong and strange, fills the room and immediately the girl stops in front of the strange blonde. "Is he?" Fleur asks.
I lift my eyes from the memo Robards just sent regarding all the cases that were ours, mine and Ron's, to give us the list of new Aurors that are going to deal with those investigations. Immediately, I see a manila folder in the corner named after Narcissa Black and I immediately feel cold inside.
“I am fine, mom,” I whisper, sighing contently. “I am just going to take a nap.”
“But, that doesn't make sense, Hannah. Scorpius only has a broken arm and… ” I choked on my own tears. "Draco... His body is so broken."
“Where’s Parkinson?” I ask to Hermione seriously.
"Just two nights ago," Hermione replies and my eyes return to a strange object.
"One more time, love," I tell him, closing the blond's hand over the wood of my wand. "Just... Just believe in yourself," I tell him, wiping a tear from his cheek with my free hand.
"I brought what you asked of me," I tell her carefully, as I move the wand towards her, letting the bag float in the air and drop right onto a small plate with powders that I don't know what they are and I don't want to know either.
"You should follow your own words, Moody," I cross my arms on my chest. "Next time it won't be a stinging hex."
"Come on, I want to show you something else," I tell him, as I pull him into the Hogwarts trophy room. "Here it is," I tell him, pushing open the door and making room for the blonde to enter. “This is the room where every Hogwarts championship is kept. Medals and trophies alike. In that corner is Quidditch, and in that other the dueling club,” I tell Dray, as we walk there. "There are other clubs too, like Exploding Snap," but Dray's first stop is at the Quidditch corner. A huge album floats in front of him.
"Sorry," Dray apologizes and lowers his head.
"Yes," he says in a serious tone. "I know Teddy is misbehaving sometimes and still Daddy sends him shapeless chocolate chip cookies, and you always send him Quidditch supplies, even if he hasn't always been good."
Here's the chapter.
“I need you to remember a few things, Harry,” he says softly. “I am in a kind of old mansion for snob people mixed with dark magic things,” he says softly. “But, there is this kind of estrange, bald elf that dress with a bright pink bow in her head. She says her name is Patsy. I am wherever Patsy is,” I say to him softly.
"I assure you that my intentions are honest," he replies with astonishing serenity. His voice making a chill go down my spine. "I don't mean to hurt Harry or play with his feelings," he tells me, blinking every so often.
“I hope so,” he says softly, not paying any attention to my threats. He isn’t peeing his pants like some other healer I know. He takes his wand in both hands, casting the spell with soft, long practiced movements.
Hermione keeps directing everyone, until the room is almost empty, save for Ron and Hermione, Neville and Pansy, me and Harry.
Her spells hit the ceiling and it starts cracking.
I need my soulmate. I will tear this universe apart if needed. And I will take my soulmate back.
"Harry," he says, taking my hand and heading somewhere. My heart flutters inside my chest at his touch. "Have you ever tried the best burgers in the world?" Dray asks me, joy dripping from his voice.
"It's not just that, 'Mione," he tells me almost in a whisper. “It is what I feel when Voldemort's eyes become the ones of that person. It feels like he's taking care of me in some way, preventing Voldemort from seeing inside my head. It is as if he's preventing Voldemort from seeing within my own soul.”
"I'm fine, 'Mione," he assures me in a soft tone. Harry doesn’t seems tired, so maybe he took dreamless sleep, and if so, I have to know.
I walk from outside Hogsmeade to the castle where I spent most of my adolescence, rejoicing in knowledge and sharing with my two best friends. If it hadn't been for this place, I would never have met Harry or Ronald. Although, even if the world may not believe it, they are the two most important people to me, apart from my parents.
Dray's hair has grown out since we first spoke to each other and now, it curls neatly around his ears. From this distance I can see the black sleeve of his cello and the pile of heads that are on it.
"Draco," is all I can whisper before capturing his lips with mine and laying him, tenderly, on my bed.
"No. I'm in a very serious relationship with my cello,” he tells me, but I see his playful gaze and I relax. "But, yes Harry," he says stroking my cheek. "I do want to be with you, although Ginevra Weasley has the most acidic comments to give me, I do want to be with you."
“Deward?” I repeat.
Well. Now with my husband.
Instead of speaking, he just pulls me towards him, encasing me with his arms and his magic.
“Stop looking at me with those baby puppy dog eyes,” she says softly. “I know where is Potter.” She says roughtly.
He looks up at me and I feel my breathe catch in my throat, because Harry is beautiful. Not just in the sexy way you see guys in magazines, but in the way you see them in passing through all your life. He is real and he is so much alive.
From one moment to the next the room begins to fill with "Awws" and "how cute he is". And it takes a couple of minutes until the room calms down again.
The door opens and I cast.
I nod softly.
"That's not what bothers me," I tell him calmly, as I think of Dray. "This is your job and I'm sure I'm not the first to walk through that door and see you with her," I tell him, looking him straight in the eye. "You are on the opposite side of Voldemort in this war and, if you really loved her, you would be careful about who you let see her, especially in this place where important things tend to get lost ... Or perish, as the case may be."
"Shapeless Chocolate Cookies!" I hear them yelling in unison.
"This is it," Dray tells him, holding up a straight, simple wand.
“Sure,” he says softly.
Harry was a kid. You don’t thrust so much into a kid’s shoulder and expect him to attend school and extracurriculars activities just because you are enough of a coward to do the dirty job yourselves.
“I need to remember him,” I whisper to no one in particular. I am sure I have seen him, before. Before… In my dreams.
And I am not so sure myself if I am talking about cancer patients or my own peers. Because none of us are gonna live for ever.
"Breakfast?" I ask him, while I approach him and extend my hand.
“Do you think…” but I cannot bring myself to end that sentence, because Hermione is banging the door open. And a second latter, Bill is all nice bundle up in one of Fleurs light scarf and a glint of gold is peaking from his shirt.
And Draco fall in pace with me a few minutes later.
“I need to know about a crest with golden flowers and deep blue like background,” she says softly, kneeling in front of Kreacher.
I roll my eyes.
“I wish Burbage was the same,” Rowley says.
"Go brush your teeth," Draco tells them and the three of them run upstairs. "What, Potter?" he asks me softly, while giving me a smile.
Coming from trauma, I know I don't like to read stuff related to my own, because it makes me really sad for days, and it takes time to get back on track. So, please.
He nods softly. The silence let us here even the smallest of the insects roaming around the threes.
Her eyes widens and suddenly I find myself being guiding by my hand by Winky.
"Excuse me," I stop in front of the man who is sitting in a chair, outside the theater where Dray said he would be. The man looks up and smiles at me. "Do you know where I can find this?" and I hand him the piece of paper that Dray left for me this morning.
I nod calmly. A smile returning to my lips.
And every single time, it just looks like cowardice to me.
I will close this letter letting you all know that you are loved, because you really are. Remember that all emotions are valid since they are not hurting other. Remember that lovev can cure and heal and help, so, let yourselves love with everything, because in doing so, you are actually changing this cold world.
If we have it though, then Voldemort too.
"Uh..." I stutter. "Here, they are gloves," I scratch my neck nervously. "They are for the cold. Winter. Autum."
I take the sheets and took him in, trying to cover his body with the heavy blanket. He has loss weight in this last tree days and I am unhappy about it.
“Why would you that, Dray?” I brush the hair that is falling over his eyes, making him look extremely young, adorable and soft. My heart stutter inside my chest when his lips caress softly my cheek.
"What will happen when the seal is broken?" I ask fearing the worst.
But, how can I confess to the wizarding world, that unlike Harry, I did those sacrifices out of the selfishness of my heart? I didn’t passed information behind the Dark Lord’s back to help The Order of fucking Dumbledore.
My husband. Ten years of marriage and I feel like we don't have more than a couple of weeks of dating. Every time I see it butterflies flutter in my stomach. However, every time we have an argument I remember that this man is my husband and we can make everything work.
"Theo was in love with Draco back when we were at Hogwarts," she says. A smile appearing on her red lips. "Now he is married to Susan Bones. And I know he loves her," Parkinson says with conviction.
“He loves chocolate cake,” she says, squatting down by my side.
“I am going to need to know the truth in order to help you,” she says, reaching over the table to take his hand.
I open my eyes to see tears in her brown eyes.
“What I need to do?” I look at her, lifting my hand and putting away a strand of her hair.
“I don’t think so,” he points out. “My father told me once that basilisk where amazing creatures, they can be linked to someone with a blood ritual. Just like necromancy is linked to blood-rituals. I learned of them in tales.”
"Take Mione, she has access to the house," I tell Ron.
"Are they dead?" Ron asks in a whisper. "Did you kill my mum?" The grip on his wand tightens and I know he have a nasty curse at the tip of his tongue.
Until, they didn't.
I shake my head gently. As if I could deny him something.
"Okay," he tells me in an amused tone. "I went to Auroring Days for a lot of years, Pap," and I see him start to eat.
“A prodigy potion master,” I say trying to appease Mione. “And he was working on something. I am pretty sure, if we start dewarding from front to back, there a better chance to not kill him in the process,” I say. “Assuming he is unconscious from a potion going wrong, then we have to be careful with the dewarding. We can make a hole in his wards and extract him without risking something worst. He lives amongst muggles now. There can be seriously repercussions if we handle this poorly.”
I hold him against me, as I comb through his hair. His body relaxing under my touch.
I immediately wonder what the hell Robards is thinking, but a glance from Ron makes me keep quiet.
"Wait," says Hermione, and everyone at the table stops eating to pay attention to ‘Mione. "She said he is an Argentum and that they are not like... Dark creatures. A kind of elf,” and her eyes sparkle, as if a planet is being born within them. "However, he does not have pointy ears like house elves."
The Dray of the memory sticks out his tongue at me.
"His spleen, did you manage to save it?" I ask the nurse and I see her leaf through some papers.
Ugh, sometimes I hate house elves.
Dray is strong and I force myself to trust in his abilities, in what he is… And in his love. Not only for me, but for all those who have ever crossed his path and managed to be better, just by knowing him. I force myself to believe, to have faith, that we'll go home after the war is over and be will be okay, because we will have each other.
Harry is there to take his hand.
“Maybe other colleague will know?” Hermione offers. “I will keep researching.”
Around me, people shine and make me think that after all, the world is more beautiful than they could ever tell me. And that, in some way, we are all connected with others somehow. And even if we think we are alone, we never will be. You just have to look around to find one more reason to forgive and love.
I stay in silence, just watching him pass the page of his book. His hands are delicate,  with long and pale fingers, and I wonder if they will feel as soft as they look. I smile while thinking that this muggle is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.
“This is not right,” Bill tell us, closing his eyes and taking deep breaths.
"Then let me fight by your side, Harry," I tell him, wiping his tears away.
"That my birthday cake was horrible," he replies seriously.
I nod stay a few steps behind, synching my steps with Hermione. We are Ron’s backups after all. He stops at the entrance gates.
“Because they ripped us apart,” I say to them. “The void inside my chest while Dray was gone off my mind eye and my magical core was similar to being back at the Dursley. Like being sad and depressed, but worse.”
"What are you humming, Dray?" Harry asks me.
"I cleaned it up." Zephora answers. “She was only found dead, with no trace of Dray, because to Death Eaters, Draco Black died that night in Wales. Do you know what happens if you throw an Aveda Kadabra at such a small human being? ” Zephora asks and I shake my head gently, because it is horrifying knowledge to have that information. "They become magic again. With no body to bury, magic consumes them because when a magical child is born… ”
I accio a quill and sign my name in the parchment.
I nod remembering Harry’s immortality.
“Hey, guys,” is the only thing he can manage before a blush start appearing in his cheeks, spreading down to his neck in a fast way. “I, uh…” He fidgets with his hands and I look down, so no one can see the fond smile in my lips. “Thanks for coming.”
“That,” she winks at him. “I am.” And then, a stream of purple light hit him straight in the neck, making him bleed.
I say back, knowing this since elementary school.
"You can tell Auror Potter whatever it is right now, in this room," Robards tells him. "You just interrupted a very important meeting."
Truly yours,
, that's all my own tells me.
And I know where he is going.
"Isn't that dangerous, Papa?" asks me.
I roll my eyes, avoiding looking at my husband.
Without thinking twice, I start to do as Hermione said. I know what I have to erase to stop looking like Harry Potter. Moody was so rude when he taught me, that I'm sure, I can even do it in my own dreams.
I nod softly.
"Torturing Mungles," Scorpius completes, and my jaw drops.
"What's going on?" I ask him and look where Dray is looking.
“Are you sure we have this right, mate?” Ron asks me for the third time in less than half an hour and focus my mind in just breathing.
We pass in front of Eyloops, and I have to stop in my footsteps.
"Stop harassing me, Mother," I say to her, letting a giggle scape my own mouth.
"Oh, Dray," she says knowingly. "I assume today it will be two hot chocolates instead of one." And the woman's eyes sparkle.
"Ah, Hufflepuff," he says as if he doesn't like it, but still all he does is make McGonagall roll his eyes and Pomfrey laugh.
"I assure you the party is near," Harry tells me, as he detaches himself from me.
"You were one of the last people Narcissa Black visited before leaving the country," I say seriously. “Can you tell me something about that? Was someone chasing her? Was she pregnant at the time or maybe with a newborn baby?”
Her eyes move under her pupils, as if she is seeing with her eyes closed. And I know it is so, I know she can do it. I'm about to stand up, when Zephora's hand stops me completely.
I can't help but laugh, my eyes on my children.
“Why?” I ask her, pouting a bit.
“But, it is actually worse, Harry,” she says in a whisper.
“Well… Severus wasn’t aware of his betrayal, either.” He points in a whisper.
"Like Harry when he cracked his arm, and then our professor left him without his arm bone," Ron says, and confussion makes a home in Dray's features.
Zeph nods, while a sweet smile, one of those rare smiles to see in someone like her, appears on her lips. I watch her place her hands on the black glove and begin to whisper words in an almost dead language, even to magicians.
“You must be the necromancer,” he says too sure of himself. Then, he removes his hoodie.
"You look miserable," I throw my best glare at him, until a new wave of nause makes me close my eyes. "Sorry," Harry adds over my groan of misery. "Really, I am very sorry."
Dray nods, his blond-white hair combed beautifully to one side, exposing his face. I take a deep breath, completely destroying the monster that threatens to show its ugly head and pull Hermione's hand away from Dray's arm.
"What's Name?" it asks me and sticks out its tongue, tasting the air.
The man, a former headmaster of Hogwarts, just smiles and sits in his chair.
For me to enjoy.
However, I shake my head.
Dray looks at me and I know he's about to say something strange.
"Because I like his company and I want it to stay that way." I tell you in a serious tone. "See you tomorrow, Mione,” I tell her, as I wrap her in a hug and kiss her cheek. "Don't let these two kill each other with the force of their great ideas."
However, I know what Teddy is telling me is not the complete truth.
"Do you still want to go celebrate Auror Day with me, James?" I ask him, giving him the option to choose. "Or if you're feeling really bad, I can leave you with Grandma Molly and then we can have ice cream in the afternoon."
"Who else will join us?" I ask him in a serious whisper.
I look at Kingsley trying to understand his true intentions. However, this could not be Kingsley's plan, he would not put Narcissa's child in danger, not when Narcissa and him are beyond first-name basis. They are nick-name pals, for God sakes. But, Dumbledore... Dumbledore is another story.
I open my eyes and everything is dark.
"That's not true," I say, stopping my travel. "I am not in love with Harry."
I block their voices, trying to reach through my bond with Harry. And then, slowly, images from Harry childhood are dancing in front of my mind eye. I can see the world through his eyes and I smile.
"You were saying Moody.”
Enjoy with hot chocolate and cookies.
"Harry," Sirius tells me, as he pushes me until I am sitting in a chair. "I need you to calm down." He tells me in a serious tone. "I know it hurts, but you need to breathe."
Magdy strokes my head.
I stand in front of an old building with red walls and a huge black door. I look both ways and my eyes immediately fall on Albus Dumbledore, the man who escaped death.
My mother turns on her heals, her scheming face looking straight to my soul.
"Mistletoe?" I ask him and let my eyes fall on the most beautiful person who has ever entered my life
I nod.
“Maybe because Occamy’s smell magic?” the Unspeakable Granger-Weasley says, so fast is giving me a headache. “I mean, they don’t really have a nose, because bird really don’t have any need for those, just to breathe air but, she can taste it just the same way a snake can. It makes sense, really.”
And then the Terrier is gone in white smoke.
Fuck.
“I talked with the healers, and they said it will do you good to see them both,” she says. “So, you can have… Peace.”
He extends his hand towards me and I pull him to my side, keeping close and safe. He glares at me like if he is ready to hex me into next century.
The smoke begins to disappear from the wide window and I realize that there is a woman next to me who may be perhaps the same age as Molly Weasley. She looks at me and smiles at me, then turns her attention to a point in the room in front of us, his eyes fixed in the other person in the room. A kid, maybe Teddy's age, trying to lift some weight.
I tap on my own memory, recreating an old encounter with Bellatrix and I project that one in the air. This is Unspeakable magic, and a pretty bad hard at that. This is not even closer to Narcissa’s magic or the one the Asset will be able to do one day, when he matures enough. This is below.
The man with her appears in my view.
“Are you ready to obliterated Voldemort?” Pansy asks me. “Because I have been talking with my soulmate, Neville Longbottom, and by the sound of his howler this morning, Potter is growing antsy with you being away from him.” Her smile suggests bad omens.
"How was your day, Harry?" he asks me and his eyes are completely focuses on me.
Scorpius gives me a smile full of pearl white teeth as he finishes gobbling his breakfast. James looks at him with a disgusted face, his little nose wrinkled and immediately turns his face away from the image of his brother, while Teddy just tries not to laugh.
"I don't want you to assist me, Dray," I tell him, looking into his eyes and into his soul. "I just want you to be yourself. I don't want your eyes to ever see death or for your soul to writhe in pain from the wounds of another," I tell him, caressing his cheek, in a mediocre imitation of what the blond is doing to me, because my fear is too great. "I love you as you are. With that air of innocence that only disappears when we make love, with each warm smile that manages to warm my soul or with your refreshing words. I don't want you to be a soldier, just another figure in this war."
"Or maybe he won't go," I say to Draco, as I put the piece of paper on the next table.
I look at the clock and thank Merlin that it is already seven thirty at night.
“I hope I can hear Nesha’s soft hisses soon and listen to you talk to her and laughing at her silly sense of humor,” I say, laying down on the soft grass. The lights are starting to dance. The garden is starting to disappear and I am in the surface of my own magical core again. “Harry?” I call him, because maybe Harry is trying to reach me somehow. “Love?” my core is growing angrier. “Harry?” I whisper in the middle of the silvery sea that is my core.
“It is okay, Patsy,” I say to her, pointing my wand at her and murmuring a soft, nourishment spell. “I need no help now. I will call you latter for you to help me make more potions.”
Once the two of them are satisfied with their work, they stand next to me and in a wave of Kingsley's hand, the table expands and two new chairs appear out of nowhere.
I feel terrified, but once I understand that the voice is not really directed at Dray, I let peace invade me momentarily.
I nod one last time before letting go.
Kingsley.
“What the actual fuck?” the man screams and I stand up.
“The Horcruxes?” I ask him.
But, now instead of aiming his cheek against mine, he aims for our lips to touch. And it feels so fucking good to finally taste him, even if briefly. His lips are soft under my own and I feel like floating. Then, suddenly, Draco’s lips are going away and I let the sensation go.
Whatever he has thrown at Moody is followed by Albus Dumbledore's magic permeating the room. I close my eyes trying to visualize my next destination and I can't apparate.
And his voice is not wavering. I can just hope he is alright.
It was not a dream. Dray is alive.
"It doesn't matter how much blood has been spilled in your name, or how many lives have vanished in front of your eyes, Dray," I tell him taking a step forward and I feel extremely happy when his magic doesn't repel me. "The important thing is to keep walking together, even if there are dark valleys and extra cold days," and finally my fingers reach his cheek and I touch them carefully. "The important thing is that we continue to choose each other as many times as necessary." I take a deep breath, understanding better. "I know now that Lucius saved you and your dad a lot of times, but here is not really the place."
“In there, magicians can seal the power of another magician,” Ron mutters. "If Narcissa Black was there, she didn't leave because her family didn't support her," Ron says seriously. "If Narcissa Black was in that place, it's most likely she was trying to hid from someone."
“I would have said yes a thousand times,” I mumble feeling heavy and weak. “Because I have been in love with you for a long time,” my words are slurring and I am not really sure they come out so well.
"As long as you are by my side, I always sleep well," he says, sticking to my back and placing a kiss on my neck.
Or maybe, I am confusing the fairy tales again?
"Why is there a stranger in this place?" Moody asks, standing up and raising his wand at Dray. "Especially one that reeks of black magic."
So, we helped the twins to set up the tent. An Impervious Charm latter, the snow is falling softly and lazy over the place.
The woman, Bellatrix, sighs softly.
"No, but it's important to Potter," Severus replies after a heartbeat. “We saw them in a hallway kissing Potter. This action, although completely disgusting, also made us see that the boy is important to the boy. If we caught this person, we could make Potter come straight for us."
Draco's gaze is on Hermione and a pang of jealousy hit me square on my chest. It is the most uncomfortable I have been in this entire morning. Not even Healer Morris knowing shit I didn’t know is up there.
Which leads me to wonder, what was Rowle doing at Lauren's inn?
“Nice to meet you,” his eyes are shinning with something equal to adoration. Unlike smart-healer lady that will hex my balls off if I ever try to stand between her and an ill Draco. “I am healer Davidson and I treat mind curses.” He extends his hand to me and I shake it quickly.
Healer Mason helps me to disconnect him from the IV, then the both of us cast an extasis charm on Draco’s body and I put the hood of the invisibility cloak over his blond head.
Draco raises an elegant eyebrow at me and I look down at the ground. I really don't like interfering with my husband's career, but every time he's in a completely muggle place it makes it a little difficult for us to communicate magically and although Draco handles Muggle technology pretty well, the magic of the ministry makes their appliances malfunction completely.
He looks cute like this, all fluffy and warm and confussed. The light of the chimney making his eyes alight. And I feel like falling in love with him all over again. Butterflies and hyppogriffs stomping in my stomach.
"And that's how you like it, Potter," he whispers against my ear, the warm air along with a kiss and a bite on my neck making me moan once, and my cock twitch between my legs. The shadow of a caress passes my neck and I shudder. "Focus Harry, I want to finish washing your hair tonight." He tells me and I can hear the laughter in his words. However, Draco's voice is as distant as the phantom caresses that run through my chest.
HARRY
I laugh at the kid's antiques and finish making my way to my family. I am so happy that Teddy is home that I can't stop smiling.
The Shelter
"Harry," Hermione calls me. Behind her Kingsley, Neekeal and Robards appear, closely followed by Ron and… Alastor fucking Moody. However, when Hermione's eyes fall on my guest's silhouette, her steps freeze. Her eyes setting on us and I feel a slight blush cover my cheeks.
Luna nods and then her eyes fall on me.
“Love, I miss you,” I sob pitifully, because I feel empty, broken, wrecked.
I cannot help it, and I end up hugging my mother. The months before the war were the worst, but then... Everything was done and Harry won. The Aurors told me they didn't know anything about my parents. They went missing. But, now mother is here and I am happy for it. I don't want to look for Father just yet, I want to enjoy my mother for myself just for a fewer hour.
“You are late,” Parkinson tells me while throwing at me something.
"Remember not to let Scorpius near the Bonitas," Draco tells me.
I swallow opening my eyes again and suppressing my own need.
Good.
“No one is trying to hurt you, Harry,” Robbards says.
"Where?" Ron asks me.
What a fucking sick word. Fuck.
And I can see recognition in his dark eyes. The eyes of a Death Eater that has seen the person Voldemort has been searching.
And with that, I see them take my husband, my universe, away. Suddenly I feel cold and so lonely.
"Or dead." Murmur Ron.
“I know this is a hospital,” he says seriously. “And yes, I know this is St. Mungo’s alright,” he says moodily, but I can see it in his cloudy eyes. He is tired and vulnerable. “I have been here before. Or have you forget I work as a potion master?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"New conquest, Potter?" Lion Moon asks me. "A bitch eager to kiss you. Why it doesn't suprise me?"
“Granger,” Draco calls her, his face buried in my neck. “Did I finished the last project?” he ask her with sadness tinting his voice.
And once I am free of the shackles, with two broken wrists, I think of Harry and his face. And I aparate home, noting my missing foot once I land in front of Molly Weasley.
"He needs this, otherwise, he is going to die. The Replenishing potion will do nothing if he keeps bleeding. Specially if we are causing something worst."
"Ritta Skitter, the famous reporter from The Daily Prophet," says the Lord. "And what can you tell me about this Dray boy?" the Dark Lord asks him, as he makes himself better on his throne.
“That can mean whatever,” Ron says.
Hermione nods softly.
I raise my free hand and wipe the tear that has escaped from his eyes.
She smiles all happy, even if the only thing she does while being in the lab with me is cleaning the droplets of potions that might fall from a bubbling cauldron.
“Boyfriends can sign for the surgery, right?” I ask Goldstein. He nods.
“Noooo,” I think about the meme of Bugsbunny. And I start cackling. Gosh, these are my genes talking. “The only way I will ever obey a man is if they are offering free sex, and I am not sure you got a package to satisfy me, not after having Harry Potter filling me. So, I am not bending for someone with a smaller dick then Harry’s.”
Ron chokes on a chocolate frog and his face turns red. I smile briefly.
The wall of ice retreats from my head, and Severus' dark eyes stare at me in pain.
Draco hands me the photograph and my heart stops beating inside my chest for a few seconds.
he says, letting me rest my head against his shoulder.
My eyes fall on James again, but his gaze is riveted on Draco. I give my full attention to my oldest son and I see him redden immediately.
My magic engulfs us both and from one moment to the next, we are gently spat on outside of Hogwarts. However, it's rare that my magic is so controlled. Hermione usually says that my magic is like a whirlpool out of control.
And, here it is, the last update. Sorry guys, but I am not really good at writting sex scenes, so I will not write about that thing in here.
"Are you being serious?" he asks me like I'm the stupidest person on the planet.
“Obliterium,” I whisper, golden light streaming off my wand.
“What?” Ron sputters. “How can he?”
"Argenti are warriors by nature," continues Dumbledore. “However, they are not looking for fights. They are calm and quiet, although Dray being raised by certain humans and other creatures is quite... Exotic and a little different. His power is similar to yours Harry Potter, but Dray doesn't need a wand to perform magic. No Argenti needs it."
"Yes, I swear," I say breathing deeply, my magic thrumming inside me.
“What is happening?” I ask him, my auror training kicking in. This feel as a hostage situation and I cannot help, but compare the to of them in order to gain insight.
"I know, Harry Potter. You don't have to apologize,” he says seriously, and I don't feel prejudiced in his voice. "I need you to show me where Dray is." And his voice is a bit more then a calm whisper.
Ewwk, that is the Original.
“This shouldn’t be happening,” Hermione mumbles beside me. "Curses shouldn't be tranfered to the real person to the one Polyjuiced."
"That's right, Mr. Potter," he tells me firmly. "We will kidnap someone who may be alive, dead, or kidnapped, so I hope you both will be ready for that."
"Sappy, sappy," Scorpius says between giggles.
At me.
“No, you don’t,” he leans back and I feel the loss instantly.
“He is awakening,” Goldstein says.
And she just nod, and then says, "Room 297, ask the front desk nurse for directions. I will find the papers to discharge your kids."
I hadn't notice, but I am still wearing my auror robes.
A Patronus comes barreling in the room. Hermione’s voice comes out of it in her usual fast, no time to breathe, voice.
This is why they moved us. Neekeal is trusting in Wardwood and so is Kingsley. And I may too, but Dray is too precious to me to risk him. If I have to waste time searching for this soil, then be it. But, I am pretty sure Voldemort is not looking for such thing, he is actively looking for Draco Black, the wizard. Which led me to ask myslef: is Voldemort aware of Draco's real father? For all I know, he could be. Still, there's someone that knows, even if that person is not alive.
Most likely, I am here to keep my soulmate in one piece. I don’t give two stones about Megalomaniac prick. My temper is raising while the seconds pass by.
“How can you ask that to a child?” Healer Mason says offended in behalf of Draco. “He survived a war, his parents maybe with whatever he is having,” she says, her face growing red. “Don’t you feel the bit sorry for him?”
From here I can see the bruises that still furrow the skin of his collarbone and neck.
That’s not good.
Damn. I feel how the heat runs from my spine to my crotch.
"Right, Hermione said you're a celebrity," the blonde tells me, his eyes shining with amusement. "And that someone disliked you for being more handsome than her or his?"
"Hey, Blaise. Mione," I call her, seeing her completely distracted with some books. "Is there still a way I can talk to... her," and I just shake my head forward.
I feel a hand connecting against my abdomen and the air leaves my lungs.
"I love you both," I tell them in a serious tone, as I took the bowl and put it into the oven. "With all my heart." I tell them once the oven is on. I placed myself behind Draco, careful not to crush him, and whispered in his ear, "But, you are my universe."
"Great," he tells me, once he sees himself in a mirror that I have conjured for him. "I should dye it like this."
Redfern is young, yes. But, his eyes, even while an exact copy of a kaleidoscope, they held the shinning light of a person that has seen way too much in this world.
"I'm scared," I tell him softly, closing my eyes and letting his warmth envelop me.
I reappear in the alley of the elves. This is the market were elves and other dark creatures buys the things they need. I head straight for the apothecary that I know is run by a vampire. She is a really old lady, but she looks really young.
"He is Draco Malfoy," I tell her, trying to seize her reaction.
“You should know by now, Draco,” my father tells me. His hand on my shoulder. “You shouldn’t argue against women. They can remember things that happened decades ago with the clarity of a thousand burning suns.”
A plump woman appears and a smile is painted on her face when she sees Draco.
This smells like Harry: sunny warm and apple sweet.
"Master Draco left today before lunch and he is yet, to come back," Kreacher says, pursuing his lips. "Did Master Harry do something to displease Master Draco?" here is the glare again.
"Was his mom on your first date, mate?" Ron asks with big eyes.
"Right, you're Dray or Draco Black," Harry tells me, bringing our clasped hands to his lips. "But, you are also an exceptional cellist and an incredible singer," he tells me, leaving a kiss on the back of my hand. "However, you have to remember that you are of magic, Dray," his voice is a low whisper that rides on the breeze. “You are an incomparable dreamer, everything that surrounds us is you. Our magic is a reflection of who we are, of our own actions and a total reflection of our intentions and thoughts. Our desires."
“Your soulmate is alive, young Draco,” he says softly. “But I wish for you to recover in the best way there is,” he looks me in the eye again. “You should stay here with us and learn how to really control your own magic, amongst the ones that are your kind.”
“Where are you taking us?” I ask her, because these wards are not gonna let us left. Not even with a portkey.
“Nothing black is ever good in the wizarding world,” Hermione says, her voice thin and whispery.
I hear two knocks on the door and I feel the frozen lake that is Dray Black's magic. For some strange reason, I am not able to say his full name yet.
"Draco," I moan his name, as my cock aches between my legs.
“Hey, Mione,” I cross the distance between us, while Hermione enters the room.
He is still groggy.
"It's actually six miles, but on a day like today, at this time, almost nobody is in the street." He removes the instrument from his back and carefully deposits it in the trunk of the car. "It will only be half an hour. If you are hungry now, I can take you to a place where you can buy something extremely fast and then…” His eyes are fixed on the sky and his face looks like porcelain when the light caresses it. "We can enjoy the best hamburger in the whole world." I laugh at his tirade. "It's open, Harry. Are you going to accompany me to eat the best hamburger in the world or not?”
He let his head fall into my shoulder.
I nod, moving the knife up to my elbow. The blood start to rush out and down. And I can feel my mother’s arms guiding me to sit down on the floor.
"Why?" Dray asks, not really grabbing the wand, barely playing with it, making it spin between his long, pale fingers.
Severus has always been a man of few words, and the few he says can shake your soul. And this is why I consider him my friend, this man has saved me more times than I can count. He has saved me even from myself.
I feel like a burrito right now. My husband's body is cold as always, but his limbs are wrapped around me and I feel happy.
"Yup," answers the girl with curly chocolate hair. "Coke, please."
"Voldemort doesn't know about Dray doing this, its better if they think it was a group of people like us breaking in here and taking him away." I say looking around the place and leaving ghost magical signatures all over the place.
“But why would it be broken?” Ron asks.
"Almost two," I tell him and I feel his forehead separate from mine. Instead, he rests it on my shoulder and wraps me in his arms.
“Don’t doubt it, Harry,” Mione whispers back. “We have an oath to keep.”
"Love," Harry's voice snaps me out of my thoughts, snapping me back to reality. "Are you well?" he asks me, while he lifts my chin with his fingers, softly.
He uses his free hand to make a symbol and he doesn’t move his hand until I cover his soft fist with my open hand. A symbol of solidarity.
The object descends and the celestial light unfolds.
And yet it doesn't feel evil. It is a warm feeling that makes me shiver. A smile falls on my lips as I walk down the stairs to the old Black house and the first person I met is Alastor Moody. Without thinking I throw a stinging hex aimed at his hand.
"Just don't tell Dad you had one," I say in a funny tone, starting a new sandwich. "Everything okay at school, buddy?"
"I thought the seal would not be broken until he received his inheritance," my voice sounds strange even to my own ears.
The Pansy Raising Cult.
"It eats cockroaches," I tell Dray rather than look at him, I hear him sigh and I know he's wrinkling his little profiled nose.
"Harry Potter," the woman calls me. "You have to open the curtains so that the moonlight comes in through the window," she tells me in that ethereal tone that makes the hair stand on end. "And then you will have to call Dray with your power."
"I've never seen your children attack anyone like this, Potter," Cooper tells me seriously. “They don't want to be Aurors like you? Surely, with that character and the magic they must have inherited from you and Malfoy, we would have two excellent agents. "
“Why?” I ask her, looking at her and taking her from Dray’s hand.
I watch the blond boy shiver from the cold, although the place is warm enough. Without thinking, I cast a soft heating spell on him, as I watched him pull the sleeves of his jersey down. Immediately a smile grace his lips and I am proud to know that I put it there.
Molly practically knocks me to the floor with the sudden hug. Dray and I wrapped tightly in the arms of a woman who has so much love that it never seems to end.
I nod gently. I get up and head straight for our room. I look in our bathroom for Draco's potions and when I go out, I find my three children in front of me.
I nod as I start to put on the auror uniform.
The magic ward is shattering around us and I realize too late that I wasn’t withdrawing enough magic. Even if for me this feel like normal, this is not normal. My magic has been weird, I have been feeling more powerful since Dray made the hole in my immortality orb.
I smile at the girl, thinking that is the only way not to be rude to her right now. I feel weird, like I want to yell at her for looking at me so much and blushing for everything I say. Although it is not the first time, I know that I must listen to Mione. The last thing I want is for the wizarding world to have reasons to follow Voldemort, being a half blood, it is very easy for me to know that I will give reasons to pure bloods to feed lies to other wizards and end up losing a crusade that I could have won and will win.
“I am sorry, Harry,” she says caressing my cheek with her hand.
Oh, and if anyone of you love Marvel... I will be posting something about Spider-man soon.
"Okay," he tells me, closing his eyes.
“I apologize for my tardiness, my Lord,” I say, kneeling softly at Voldemort’s chair.
"Severus didn't need your help, my darling," she says, turning on her heals and starting the journey again. "He managed just fine for sixteen years before you."
Draco turn his head, hiding his face in the crook of my neck. I hold him against me, feeling how my shirt is starting so soak, I am pretty sure, with tears.
HARRY
“Com’on,” I say softly, his eyes trained on my lips.
I ask him, inhaling the smell that has been scorched inside my head. The smell of Harry Potter. The heady scent that comes from long minutes under the shower spray.
A cold sweat runs down my body when I see the huge black cup that has a red star outside. I conjure a smile, trying to make all the panic go away.
“You still have me,” I say in the same whisper he used a second ago. “You still have me, Draco. They didn’t leave you alone, they left you with me and Greengrass, and the ever-nosy Parkinson.” I erase the tears track in his face. “You still have us, and we still love you.”
She steps aside and Draco drags me into the room, the light coming alive while the ward ripples around our bodies, casting shades over the bodies laying on a bed. Charms and lights are burning around them.
he’s letters from in a metallic red blood color, while he looks up at Hermione, behind me.
I look Harry straight in the eye, trying to make sense of his words. This doesn't feel like a class where they explain something to you, and this doesn't feel like everyday Harry. This one feels like the Harry I've rarely encountered, full of devotion and love. A Harry that rarely comes to light, much less when we venture close to the magical world.
“I will be back,” Madame Pomfrey says, leaving the main wing. “Don’t try to stand up yet, Potter.”
“Be careful, Patsy,” he says softly. “We are living in dark times.”
“What are we talking about?” I ask her.
I smile at him, because Harry has no idea what beautiful memories his reaction brings back. Right now, I'm not standing in front of Harry Potter, but in front of James Potter on his first date with Lilly Evans. And I can't help but laugh at the resemblance, at the gestures, and at the meaningless sentences that come out of his mouth.
He says, crossing his arms.
“Harry,” Hermione says, still looking at Draco’s face. “It will be good if you come with us.”
"We don't know, we only know that Dumbledore introduced him to some classrooms as Dray, many times leaving his last name blank." Severus's words are soft and hateful. "No one really remember, though."
"Do I look like some kind of old man with a stick stuck up to his butt?" he tells me, crossing his arms and lifting his nose in the air.
“I dunno, Mione,” I answer he fast. “The only thing that I know for sure is that Regulus has the locket, which is still a Horcrux.”
“Why this thought?” Hermione asks.
They have been long days and yet the wait has been worth it. Everything is worth it, if my family is happy and complete.
The dark-skinned woman takes my hand and begins to drag me to where the stairs are. I see her move around the house with her eyes closed. Without stumbling even once. I feel like in a trance, where the only thing I can do is follow this stranger through my godfather's house.
“Maybe his bedrrom,” Goldstein says, steeping back.
God, this man is going to be my death.
"I'm sorry," he says to me and his cheeks turn red. At some point, the Muggle lights came back on. "Let me make up for the scare you just got," he says taking my hand in his and pulling me towards our room.
Harry makes a warning sound with his mouth.
"I can't breathe," I tell Molly, feeling the pressure on my ribs.
I like it a lot when you guys left comments, so... left a few, I will be waiting to read what do you think.
And so, Kingsley's panther disappears from everyone's sight, leaving the environment a little calmer.
In a matter of seconds we are in front of the headmaster.
“Today we were awarded with information of another cottage that fell under the radar of the vigilante wizarding community,” she says softly, making a picture of a little cottage appears in front of all of us. She moves her wand hand and the image float to us. “This is Malfoy’s Cottage, in the outside of Bretagne.”
"I will love you forever," I whisper to him once I made my mind. "It doesn't matter if you don't love me back, Draco. I will devote my heart to you."  I kiss his temple, clossing my eyes momentarily, caressing the soft locks of hair. "And maybe, one day, my love will be enough to heal you. One day."
“Healer, Head Auror, what can I do for you both?” I am still in my auror robes and I feel like a little kid.
There’s that noise again. He is laughing, and it is a really, really soft and low noise.  Nonetheless, I am elated to hear it again.
She huffs.
he whispers back.
“No. But my boyfriend’s father might be there,” I answer his question softly.
My ring says on the back: From Harry. While Draco's says: From Draco.
His voice yanks me out of my safe place, but Harry’s magic is still draped all over my soul and core. It is like he is here, because that’s what my muscle memory wants. And musicians… we are good at that one.
Parkinson rolls her eyes so hard I am pretty sure she could see her sharp pug-faces ancestors.
"No one keeps venomous snakes in a store, Harry," he tells me and his eyes fall back on the snakes. "Besides, they deserve love and pettings too," he lifts his eyes and pouts his mouth.
Hannah Abbot stands in front of the microphone and I tuck the cello between my legs, letting the unique calm that Amazing Grace emits seep through every fiber of my body, as my hands move in time to create a flower bed for the night. melody that Hannah sings.
"Well, your Papa should be proud that I can do a Scourgify without a wand," I say seriously and Scorpius laughs a little harder.
I cannot help but feel proud of my soulmate. It will take a few months training his magic so he can control it better, but we will be ok. He will be formidable and now, he has a way to defend himself.
Shit, this is going to be complicated.
“You will both be over this soon,” she says to me and I force my self to believe in her words. Right now, Draco have no one to look after him, just me.
Here is another chapter of this... Whatever this is.
I am Harry Potter the orphan. I am not scare of her; I wasn’t even afraid of fucking Dudley and his gangs of junkies. She has control over the other Harry, and he will stay the fuck down, because the Asset isn’t in need of him.
"I took Dray to Hogwarts a few days ago," he tells them. "The sorting hat thought it was a good idea to put him in Hufflepuff," he tells them and smiles at me.
Dray nods softly, his body leaning gently forward along with his head. Softly bouncing on the soles of his feet.
"Auror Potter," says a nurse, whom I haven't even heard enter. "Your husband will be awake for just a few more minutes." The nurse tells me, as she begins to guide me to some other room. However, when I get to the door, I can't take my eyes off my three children. "They will be fine, don't worry."
I feel shame creeping stronger on me and making me feel dirty. “I know I am the last Horcrux to be created,” I whisper to him. “And I know it never was supposed to exist, me or this last Horcrux. What I call my orb of immortality is the residual of the magical thread that helped to make the Horcrux inside me.” I lower my head, feeling dirty. “I am sorry I didn’t tell you soon.”
"My husband is a professor at College of Cambridge," I tell them in a serious tone. "The only torture he imparts is leaving tons of homework to his students."
HARRY
I hug Dray to my body and think about my destiny. And I appear at the edge of the forbidden forest. And there he is, Hagrid with an orde of third-year kids.
I am too scare to open my eyes right now. My connection with Harry is gone. The fear is making the illusion created by my own muscled memory fading into nothingness.  Even if I try to tap in my core, there is just the silvery strands… Slowly becoming a shinning grey, like sparkles. What is happening to me?
Draco's Point Of View
"That's the reason why Voldemort want him," says Ron. "It makes sense. He doesn't need a wand to make magic. He protected Harry from Voldemort in his dreams, maybe now it is in an unconcious way, but still he can. Voldemort use a kind of Legilimency to put lies in Harry's mind, and latelt it hasn't work because Dray is in Harry mind. If you have a device that can make Occlumency, then I am pretty sure Voldemort may wants it, because the Ministry is not stopping at Veritaserum when they can get their hands on Death Eaters," Ron's voice cute deep in the silence of the room. "Voldemort is craving the power this kid has inside him."
"Dray," Hannah Abbot's voice snaps me out of my thoughts and I detach myself from Harry, making my way to my companions. "We are not late yet, but it is better to start before seven o'clock at night."
Blaise hits me on the shoulder, playfully.
I stand up and look through my drawers for pants that will accommodate the cold of autumn and go out in search of the blonde.
“He knows about Dray,” I say to him, running my hand through my hair. “I need to check on him, Kinsgley, please.”
Out of curiosity I reach out and touch the golden wings that Hermione said formed yesterday. If this is the memory of Narcissa Black… Who is giving her new memories?
I focus on Dray and how the room starts to rise, steadily, in temperature.
"And what is the paper in your hand, love?" Draco asks curiously, again, as he hands him a frog-shaped cup of tea.
"Thank you for having us today, head of the Unspeakables," I say looking at her, then nodding gently in the direction of Blaise Zabini and Hermione.
I'm completely sure I've heard that somewhere: The Dark Lord. But, I can't say for sure where or from whom. Aida Garifullina's voice snaps me out of my musings and I focus my gaze on Harry.
He left a kiss in my cheek.
“Refrain yourself from laughing, Mr. Potter,” Madame Pomfrey chides, handing me a vial with a sick-green substance.
"Not by blood," says the girl I assume is Hermione. "But, yes. We are sibblings of feelings."
"This is crazy," Wardwood says, rubbing his hands over his face. "I have not been in this case for more then twenty-four hours and I already feel that I want it to end. I thought the cases Harry Potter was assigned were the best to work on."
He pats my knee softly.
“Let’s see if Dray here can catch the quaffle,” she says all smug and I can see Sabini’s smile breaking in his lips. These two bastards are really a match for each other. For being a Weasley, Ginny has a lot of things that I am always going to attribute at being the youngest. For example, her constant need to prove she is the best.
"But never face off with another wizard," he tells me, too sure of himself. "I need you to stop thinking that Lucius Malfoy is going to do something to me, because he won't," he tells me too sure of himself. "I know you consider him a dark wizard, capable of doing the same things as Voldemort, and perhaps you are not so far from reality..." Dray's eyes turn white, until he blinks again and his eyes return to the same blue color as always. “This is a school though, and I need to get closer to him in order to understand and experience the way he teaches,” he tells me with confidence. "If you interfere with this false mission that is not so false anymore, many wizards and witches will have an uncertain future, because Hermione is not going to do anything now that her job is to be Unspeakeable, not to look after the good of stupid children like me. Her job is to unravel mysteries, not to wipe the snot out of terrified children's face in this place,” He takes a step forward and I take a step back. What the fuck? My Dray is not like that. "Finite."
Still holding the cello firmly in his left hand, Dray takes my wand in his right hand and I close mine over his. The tips of my fingers caressing the dark wood.
So, is Bellatrix whose breathe smells like a pig has gone inside her mouth and died there. She needs a feew mint tik taks, or a bottle of Colgate Plax Ice. Maybe a gallon, because a bottle wouldn’t be enough.
This is a beautiful place. Then, whatever it is, starts to change. White light and incommensurable pleasure flooding my veins. This feels so fucking good.
"A-an Occamy?" she asks me and suddenly her eyes land on Dray.
"Time for what?” I ask him again.
"If you wake him up, I'll sew your your eyes shut as well," I say, as a cruel smile appears on my lips.
But, love is magical on its own way, Harry. Reminds me the voice of Hermione inside my head.
“He is one of the informants for the Hit Wizards, Aurors and Unspeakables,” she answers me, “And he works in potions, down in the darker level of the Ministry.”
Enjoy with hot chocolate because this weather... Brrrr. It's cold!
My blood get cold.
“Sure,” I hear the words getting out of my mouth and falling deep between my heart. This is a weird feeling. I turn around to look at the other Auror, the Weasley and his wife, Unspeakable Granger-Weasley. “I need a magizoologist.” And then, I am walking out of the cottage.
Sirius pulled me to his chest and I feel really exhausted to continue this battle with Moody. the only thing I wanna do is go upstair and watch Dray sorrounded in the Extasis bubble. Even if it is a bit masochist, I will cling to whatever thing I can hold to keep him. A necromancer can bring him back if I keep his body intact, I will know all about the process, I was the one who keep Dumbledore's body intact until Snape took him away.
From where I am I can see the stunned gaze of several students, some looking at each other, and then looking at Scorpius, who is a faithful copy of me, but with Harry's emerald eyes.
This is why they need me. I am one of the two persons that can deward here in London. The other one might be dead, aparently.
And while that line of thoughts is swirling inside my head, I can see how raw magic lashes out to anyone standing in the way of my soulmate. His magic is a fierce silvery color. One lonely strand of fiery orange is consuming itself between the endless stream of white light and angry feelings.
"Master, Harry," he says in a serious tone.
"Just don't be all over Harry," I tell her again. "Harry said the boy doesn't feel so comfortable because Harry is a wizard and he is a Muggle," I tell little Weasley. "Sometimes."
I really don’t want to go.
"Why?" James asks me.
But, my body hit the hard floor anyways. And I feel by bones cracking and the pain erupting in my body. If I die I will be close to my parents again? Maybe Luna is with them in heaven. If I die, will I be with them?
"Reggie," his hand moves the person bleeding to the ground. "Fuck," I hear him mutter something, but nothing I can make out, and the blood runs back into Regulus Black's body. "Don't go to die now, child."
I wake up drenched in sweat and I feel hot and cold at the same time. Tears are streaming down my cheeks.
"Yes, we did," Hermione tells him again.
Draco nods, and I feel the twins' little hands pulling me toward the fireplace.
Albus lets the air out.
"You are a nuisance," I tell the animal.
"Rehabilitation doesn't just have to be physical, Mr. Potter". That was what the mind healer told me after his second session with Draco. "Draco is used to having responsibilities, being a father, being a husband, and being an educator. I think that if we gave him back two tasks of each of them, we could get him to recover faster. Sometimes patients take longer because they cannot see their goals getting close enough, as their families cut them off from all daily activities, thinking that they are doing them good, when, in fact, they are not. I want to avoid this for Draco."
"Harry, no one apart from us, Kingsley and the guardians of Dray himself know who he really is..." she tells me, fixing her black robes. "Besides, there's something I want you to see," Hermione tells me, as she drags Ron and me downstairs where the Minister's office and the Unspeakables headquarters are.
And suddenly, everything around me goes completely silent. Even a waiter with an already empty tray stops and sets her eyes on the blond. And I feel it in the air... Draco's magic, enveloping those present, filling their hearts with a love so great, it hurts. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see the man with the Spanish flag, still on his shoulder, hugging his wife, while the piece continues to play. Dray's fingers dancing on the black neck of his instrument.
Teddy nods, lowering Scorpius off the kitchen island and then taking both twins' hands in his.
Parkinson looks at her with her mouth open and her eyes shining with hope. Goldstein looks at both of us, and then, he is pinching Malfoy with the syringe.
I open my eyes to see Draco gloriously naked in our bathtub. His body lowered until he is straddling me and I immediately claim his mouth. My hands gripping his waist hard and pulling him towards me, until our bodies are so close that I can feel my husband's member between our stomachs, and I stick him closer to me. And I swallow the moan that tries to escape his mouth due to friction.
Hermione gently shakes her head.
"Ready!" Teddy's voice echoes in the dining room and within seconds, I am surrounded by little hands and childish hugs.
"Bella, cease your thoughts at once and for all," and the Dark Lord's claws close over my hair, making me lift my face. "Don't make me repeat it, Bella."
"You don't leave the crime scene without checking in a bit first, Goldstein," Parkinson is quick and sharp with her tongue. "We don't know what happened to him."
But he doesn’t care either, because he keeps drinking. Until he is not, taking a few steeps backwards, he puts distance between us.
It’s weird. He is on edge right now, his body is tense, his eyebrows are drawn together, his jaw is clenching so hard is a miracle he hadn’t manage to dislodge a tooth with that amount of pressure he is applying.
"Come on," he says, taking the light blue mug that the woman placed next to the black one. "You will love it," and then she blushes. "The drink, I mean. You will love to die.”
I smile to hear her talk about Dray like that.
, nice. Now my evil twin is here, tied to the dark strand in my core. Because my magic is freaking fiery orange. A mutant orange.
"I know so, Reggie," and then he kisses the other's cheek. "Thank you."
This is here a bit late but I am happy nonetheless. I have been at hospital recently, but i think I am doing better now.
"Everything is fine, Dray," I whispered against his ear. "We are in a safe place now. I promise."
Dray doesn't know what is signing up for.
“And not just that one, but Dray’s as well.” Ron chimes in. “I mean, all of us knows he was learning how to control his power and his bond with you,” and then, his finger is poking me in the chest.
“I feel like sleeping forever, Harry,” he says. “I am tired.”
"Daddy, no!" James says to Draco with a chuckle.
So, Harry is red when he is upset and a dull grey when he is sad, a strange shade of baby blue when he is thinking things through. A soft shade of lavender when he is surrounded by family if The Cranberries are something to goes by.
"He is amazing, he has blonde hair, almost as blonde as Luna's, his eyes are gray and he is really sweet," Harry finishes saying with such a big smile that I think his face will split in half.
"Anything is possible when we talk about magic, Auror Potter," he looks at me with his glowing eyes. "After all, you managed to survive an Unforgivable."
Most of the things you are reading right now where things I never understand before going to college and seeking professional help. In fact, it took me years to reach the conclusion that I wasn't broken, even if the scars in my wrist, from multiples suicides attempt begs to differ. I am a lot of things, but broken is not anymore one of those.
"Well, time to educate your palate," he tells me a few seconds later when my eyes fall on the monstrosity that the waitress left over the table.
"It's a good house," Hermione tells me.
I open the door, since Dray doesn't seem to want to or can't open it, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I open the door and watch him go under my arm. However, what I see reminds me of the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade and I immediately feel at home.
“Yes, mother, I know,” he says irritably. “I just…” And then, he is lacing his hands in front of him. “Yes, I know. I love Luna…” I listen to him, and he is so close to the window I can feel my heart thundering inside my chest. “I know Harry is a good person, but I am not try… I hate this stupid house!” Draco says furiously, his toe crashing against one of the healer’s cabinet. “Why is a vase table in the middle of the foyer?”
Ron rolls his eyes and Hermione accompanies him.
Harry laughs, and this time is a light, short one. He laughs, but he leans into me and when his lips cover mine, I close my eyes and focus on feeling the moment. My chest shrinking, as something overflows into it. The sadness to know Harry Potter is broken.
"No," I hissed back. "You are gonna left him as he is. Sweet and caring, and full of love," I feel irrational but something inside me is screaming to protect my mate. "You can train him to heal, he have those. But no one is going to teach him how to spell an AK or any of the unforgivables."
"You cannot know that," I say, looking at the stove. There's something odd with the way the kettle is arranged.
"Uh," he tells me and I can see the Loading Circle on his forehead. "In chess?" Looked at him. "Chess." He answers me safer. "I'm good at it."
He nods a few times, slowly.
A bad decision was he in the eyes of the ancestors of the Young Master’s mother. However, he didn’t last long amongst of the ones that magic chose to be her own children. Instead, he was chosen by nature to be one of her own. A muggle in love with a child of magic to sired a child of magic.
Voldemort didn’t and a little glimpse at that scene was enough for him to demand to know. But, Draco denied it softly, saying all of them had to learn the basics of the charm back there.
“His neural connections react really good to light,” he says softly. “It is reacting to the touch in general, and that is really good,” the healer looks down and he shakes his head slowly. He pauses, maybe rearranging his ideas. “I am pretty sure his mind is intact. I saw glimpses of his childhood, teenage years and recent ones, if a dark room is something to go by,” he says, then he is biting inside of his cheek. “But he is not really reacting to the sound around him,” he says. “His neuronal net didn’t light up when you started talking, but when you touched him, it was like seeing a blinding sun,” he says softly. “Whatever he was processing when I first casted the spell wasn’t related to the sound inside the room. I think it was processing your touch and the magical sources that might be crashing against his brain.”
“Dude, ever herd of toothpaste before?” I ask her, recoiling in the iron-cage, trying to make a point. “I am pretty sure there’s a rat dying in your throat.”
"He is not quite lucid," she tells me in a serious tone, as she moves her wand around my body. "This is just to ensure that no germs sneak into that room or your husband's body" I nod slightly as she continues to wave her wand. "This is going to take a few hours, Auror Potter, your husband surgery I mean." She tells me in a serious tone.
"Control your little bugger," I tell Dray, pulling away from him, a pained smile settling on the blonde's lips. "Chu. Let's go. Or it will get late and then your bug will have to wait until night to feel better." I see him enter the apartment, the boxes are still scattered around the space.
Draco smiles and sits in his usual position, at my right hand, while Scorpius is next to him, followed by Teddy and James, Scorpius is in front of me.
"That's not just any kid, Albus," Moody replies, his eye moving madly from side to side. “That boy has the part it takes to win this war. He cannot be considered as a human, because he is not! Even if any of you like it he is a weapon. One that Voldemort can use against us if he can find the brat."
My stomach churns.
I shake gently.
I wrap Draco in my arms, trying to make him feel all the love I feel for him. I press him a little more against my chest, when I feel his body begin to shake uncontrollably. His sobs tearing my heart to pieces.
“You see, Harry Potter, the thing with being so good is that, you always lose,” she says, then a body flew to her. “And now, I am gonna go. Not just with your beautiful boyfriend of course, but with his daddy as well…” she is holding Regulus mangled body.
Severus
“The truth, my dear Harry, is that you cannot protect Dray from death forever, especially not when he himself has tasted her, flirted with her and emerged victorious. You see him as one of the purest people to ever come into your life, Harry, and that's fine, because he is,” Dumbledore replies, his eyes twinkling with knowledge. “However, that is not due to the fact that Dray has not been exposed to madness and chaos. In fact, it is due to our beloved boy's ability to subdue his emotions and his actions,” Dumbledore's blue eyes shine brightly, as if we were talking about Merlin himself. "Dray has seen, heard and lived things really horrible, things very similar to yours, more terrifying, since you have never had to witness the torture of someone, but he has. Dray lived through dark times, and he was victorious. Somehow, he absorbed light from the darkness and achieved what many believed impossible: life."
But… A war zone against who?
She nods again, opening the door with her wand and a soft Alohomora.
"There is nothing wrong with being a know-it-all," he tells me in a serious tone.
“I was a beater, not a bitter loser,” the older Black in the room says, trying to hide his pout.
“Draco,” she speaks softly, sitting down in the bed. I stand up, fearing this contraption might go down under the weight of us. “How are you feeling?” she asks, letting her hand rest over his knee.
Greeney.
"Do you think I faked their deaths just for a couple of stupid Death Eaters to find it after three years?" he asks the black-haired man, as he helps him to his feet. "You have to start trusting Dumbledore, Reggie, or the boy won't live much longer. You may know Zephora, but she cannot teach him how to stop from turning into an Obscurus."
I go down the steps one by one and just as I enter the room all eyes fall on me. Hermione's curious gaze, Ron's ever-thinking eyes, Kingsley's intense gaze, and Moody's suspicious gaze bring me back to the real world.
Or maybe, Dumbledore knows more than any of us will ever know?
“When is Parkinson coming back?” I ask Hermione.
A noise of pain left his lips. Can an emotion hurt someone physically? Now I know that is possible.
He looks so adorable in my clothes and I can’t help but feel annoyingly happy.
"Because apparently he can come back from the dead," the redhead tells me and I immediately choke on my drink. “They have tattoos on their arms and they enjoy torturing Muggles. And his wish is to kill Harry."
"But, they are not animals, mom," one of them replies.
“What did you do to me?” I cry out, feeling the tears falling from my eyes.
I take his hand in mine and lead him to the main entrance, the one that adjoins the corridor that leads to the Great Hall.
“I trust you, Harry,” he whispers that words one last time against my chest and I take a deep breathe, vowing I will move earth and heaven if I have to in order to make Draco happy again.
“Were we even their priority along those decisions?” I ask him, feeling myself numbing again.
HARRY
“I think, Mr. Malfoy lost his hearing when the magic attacked the intruders planted inside his head,” he says softly. “We don’t know what spell he used to attacked them, it could be whatever, but whatever usually includes maim and…”
Teddy looks around with big green eyes. His mouth open, sucking on one of his fists. Teddy is so small, almost a year and a half, his first teeth are showing and I am really happy that I was chosen to carry the title of Godfather, while Ginny wears that of Godmother.
"Because to be immortal, my beloved, first you have to kill, and then you have to die," I tell him, removing his hand from my scar and kissing the palm of his hand. “I refused to die Dray, but in magic when a ritual calls for a sacrifice, the sacrifice will be made. My mother refused to die for an unjust cause, as did my father. And when he tried to offer me as a sacrifice, my mother's magic collided with his and killed him,” I tell Dray.
“Wow, mate,” Neville says, taking a steep back from us and taking Pansy with him. “Keep it down.”
“Interesting,” Smart-Healer says. “But, I don’t buy it. I want to see your bedroom.”
She throws a hex his way and it lands, making a blister appears.
I look back at my best friend and with an apologetic smile, I undo my tie and throw it on the couch in the living room. An armchair that still has the cover from the move on.
All thanks to bloody Goldenheart and her big mouth.
"That's because you've never tried to be serious with a girl or boy, Sirius," the older replied. “What's scary isn't whether he likes your family or not,” he tells me knowingly. “What is scary is that that person has the power to make or destroy you. And when we realize we have given that power to someone, we really begin to fear. That is why it is so difficult to meet the family of someone you have romantic feelings for,” he tells me, stopping at the door. “They can make or break you. A friend, it doesn't matter. But, a person who has really entered your heart…” and he shakes his head gently. “When we love people, we let them into our hearts, Sirirus. We give them a knife and a map which point the right place to cut to hurt us. And that..."
