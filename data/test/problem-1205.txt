James looked at Severus like he had lost his own mind, but Lily nodded. They excused themselves to talk privately. While they were doing that, Harry looked at Severus.
“You’re good at a few more things then Herbology, Neville,” Zabini had purred. Longbottom’s face turned red, and Zabini looked smug. Draco was surprised that the two boys were apparently already an item, but quickly shook the feeling away. “Are you sure it’s a good idea to have all the houses in the same session?” Zabini was looking at Draco while asking this.
Harry acted before thinking, and deflected the curse. Mrs. Malfoy had turned and saw the curse coming too late to act, and braced herself. However, it ricocheted towards the train, glancing around she saw that Harry had deflected the curse and said, “While unnecessary, your help is appreciated Mr. Potter. We will be more vigilant, so don’t bother keeping an eye out for us.” Harry nodded his head at her, and put his wand away. Malfoy glanced at Harry with suspicion in his eyes again before resuming his path towards the train..
“Yes, well, I’ll make this quick. Filch has asked me to remind you that the Forbidden Forest is off to limits, as well as any products from the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes shop as well as over 400 other different items. Magic is not allowed in the corridors, which most of you dunderheads would do well to remember. If any member of the staff or Prefects see you hex another student, regardless of house, it will be an automatic 10 point reduction and detention. Eighth years stay behind, but the rest of you, find your dormitory.”
Draco and Harry both stood up to leave when Snape did, but Snape softly said “Mr. Potter stay behind, please,” when they had taken a few steps. Harry stopped and turned towards Snape slightly wary. Snape was regarding him with the curious expression again, and Harry realized that Snape hadn’t been a git during the whole conversation. Then he thought about the times he had traveled into Snape’s office to go to his therapy sessions, and realized Snape hadn’t been awful to him for a couple of weeks now.
“Well I don’t feel comfortable living with a bully, Hopkins. Leave Draco, and the rest of the Slytherins alone.”
“It’s alright, Draco, I think your pointiness suits you.” Harry followed up his statement with a swift kiss on the cheek.
“Yes, I do know,” Harry sighed deeply. “Well you know how Severus had me go through some of the CV’s for the temporary professor position? One of them was a man from the United States named James Waller. When I interviewed him, I had the wild suspicion that he was my father. I convinced myself I was wrong, but then Severus and I called him. I wasn’t wrong. Dumbledore found a way to protect a person from the killing curse. He used the charm on my parents and then hid them in the United States all these years.”
“No he has not. It is very inconsiderate as the new school term starts in less than two weeks. I would not be able to find an adequate hire if he was to turn down the position at this point.”
Patricia sneered at him, and seemed like she was about to talk back again. Harry wondered if he was this hot-headed as a student. Harry thought back to a few of his interactions with Severus as a student; yes, he was as hot-headed as Patricia.
Harry nodded and took Snape’s arm; they apparated to a street in Muggle London that Harry did not recognize and walked to a building that did not stand out from the rest. Harry took care to remember the street name and number of the building before walking in. Snape pointed out the name on the directory “
“That’s not true! It’s a misunderstanding, and Ron drew his wand first.” Weasley sent a betrayed look to Hermione, but nodded his head to go along with her story.
Snape sneered as he said all of this, as per usual; any hope that the war ending softened Snape was dashed after that speech. The Great Hall cleared out leaving the 30 eighth years and Snape alone, he glared at them all and then spoke,
“Congratulations are in order to you as well then. However, that is not the reason I asked for this meeting.” Harry nodded and bit back his excitement; it left anxiousness in its place. Severus continued, “Minerva informed me that she would be taking a sabbatical this year, as will Madame Pomfrey. I know Madame Pomfrey is asking Draco to fill in her position for the year.” Harry nodded, she had asked Draco a few days ago; he was on the fence at the moment, but Harry knew he wanted to take it. “I need someone to fill in as the Head of Gryffindor House for the year, which I intended to ask you to do the day Minerva informed me of the sabbatical. However, now I am also going to extend the offer of filling in for the Deputy Headmaster position to you.”
Harry turned around and remembered he had a message for the Wallers, “Oh, before I forget again, Draco might have made a bit of headway concerning the charms. He wants to call a meeting within the week.”
Harry didn’t give himself time to think about it, or for the group to answer, before plunging into the Great Hall. He wanted to stop and turn around, he felt himself start to shake. He knew this was an extremely bad idea. He noticed that the hall was very quiet, and people were staring. His legs were turning into jelly.
“Brilliant! The Charms classroom on the third floor. Flitwick is more than happy to let us use it, so it should be unlocked.” Draco forced a smile and nodded. He gathered up his things and walked out of the library without another word. He felt Harry walk beside him, and then reach for his hand. Draco thought he made the movement subtle enough that Harry wouldn’t notice his evasion, but the Golden Boy had. “Is everything alright, Draco? You seem off; you’ve seemed off for a bit now.”
James and Lily looked at each other and then nodded. Severus stood up with Lily, James, and Harry following suit. They walked outside, and James pulled out a smoke. Lily softly admonished him when he lit the cigarette, so James put it out with a shrug and a grin. Severus stared at the interaction with an odd expression before clearing his throat.
Then he heard a “Fucking hell, Potter!” and the same voice cast the counter-curse to stop the blood flowing. Malfoy must have seen his rage, and said
“Indeed? Well, next year I will have the professors single out talented sixth and seventh years to ask them. The professors, with one exception, all agree that the program is extremely beneficial now. They, admittedly, were not fans to begin with.”
“I can’t find Patricia Batson. She’s the fifth year Prefect for Gryffindor, and we were going to have her take the newly sorted first year Gryffindors to our common room tonight after the feast.”
Harry looked through the temporary Transfiguration applicants and had narrowed down the pile to around fourteen, which he thought was pretty decent compared to the pile of twenty rejects. He only had to cull another six, and then start calling the eight that made the cut. He put his forehead on his desk and cursed accepting the Deputy Headmaster job for approximately the fortieth time in the last three days. He heard a deep chuckle and looked up at his husband standing in the doorway.
Harry knew Ron tried to cheer Mrs. Weasley by saying that Harry barely talked to Ron and Hermione as well, but Harry wasn’t sure if it worked. Harry couldn’t figure out how to distance himself from Ron and Hermione, since both of them had decided to move in with Harry until the start of term. Ron had officially sent his owl to Hogwarts, changing his mind and wanting to get his N.E.W.T.S. Snape had written back a schating letter about it but accepted Ron’s request. Ron was told he would be welcomed back to the Auror program once he finished the year, as would Harry. Hermione was extremely happy that both of them were going to be finishing school, and bought Ron an expensive quill to celebrate.
The rest of the group nodded at Draco’s words, and fell silent. A few minutes later, Draco broke the uncomfortable silence with his own story from work. The heaviness lingered over the conversation, though, and Harry decided to drink just enough to forget about his problems for the night.
“McTavish, what in the hell are you doing?” Draco had never heard Longbottom’s voice sound so harsh and grave. The boy, McTavish, said, “Well the second year Slytherin was walking alone, like she owned the place, and I decided to teach her a lesson. She ran away from me into this compartment, and I found more snakes. Did you two want to help me make them regret coming back?”
Draco looked at the Gryffindor and felt terribly guilty over forgetting Pansy’s birthday; he hoped that Blaise had told everyone else about her birthday before yesterday so that she received gifts. He would have to look at a catalog later to buy her an appropriate gift. Then he thought about his group of friends being worried about him, which was unusual. Before this year, Goyle and Crabbe just followed him while he talked to Pansy when it was convenient; they never cared for him as more than the Prince of Slytherin, on top of the social hierarchy.
“Very well.” Severus flicked his wand and a tall pile of parchment fell on his desk. “Take half of these,” the pile split in half, “and narrow it down to your top eight. Then telephone each of the top eight and have a short interview, and bring your top four back to me. I will do the same, and we will interview the remaining eight together.”
“5 points from Gryffindor for your attitude, Ms. Batson. I’m not requesting for you to go find Ms. Rogers, I am telling you.”
Lowering his wand, he found that he could no longer bring himself to end his life; this would have been more of a comfort if Harry was not so miserable. He deserved to die because he only ever hurt the people he loved, so many people died in the war because of him, and he had somehow survived the killing curse twice while more noble people never breathed again. Pointing his wand at his wrist for a third time, hoping that he was brave enough to do what needs to be done, he started to cast the spell that would end him.
“What happened last time?” Harry sighed at the question he knew was coming, but wanted to avoid for as long as possible.
Draco could not believe that he said all of those nasty, horrible things to Harry; he knew how it would affect him, but he could not seem to stop himself. Merlin, he was an awful human and he deserved to be expelled followed by being thrown into Azkaban. There was no way he could apologize enough for that horrendous blow up. Suddenly he was hit in the arm, and looked over to Pansy who was glaring at him furiously.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feeling nervous, Harry walked to the elevator and pushed the button for the sixth floor; the Dursleys had talked about psych wards often while Harry was growing up, and he was afraid of being placed in one. Vowing to not mention his suicide attempts so that he wouldn’t be committed, Harry walked into the office and smelt lavender. The walls were a soft purple, with flowers painted along the wall, and the receptionist had a calming voice which made the whole office very non-intimidating, but Harry was still extremely nervous. He walked up to the receptionist and said that he had an appointment, to which she handed him some forms. After filling out the forms, he sat down and waited.
Harry was stunned. He had not expected to be in the running for the Deputy position, since Severus was big on seniority and ensuring that Harry was treated like everyone else. He thought Severus would ask Filius or perhaps Pomona; Madame Pomfrey had told Draco about Minvera when she asked him to fill in. He must have looked surprised because Severus’ lips twitched.
“Then you came back and the little bit of respect I had for you was lost. I could understand that you would be upset the war happened, and be upset for all the people you knew that died. I could not fathom how you could be so arrogant to believe that everyone who died was because you. Sally and I did not choose to fight for you, I chose to fight to stop wasting magical blood, and she fought for what was right. Sally did not choose to die for you, she died for me! Stop blaming yourself for the actions of a lunatic and his followers, you arrogant boy! It’s time for you to realize that the war might have revolved around you, Dumbledore, and the Dark Lord, but the rest of us didn’t fight just because of you three! We fought because innocent lives deserved to be saved, and if lives were lost, we chose to lose them to save someone who didn’t have a choice! Sally chose to fight for people who would never have a choice to fight against oppression! ”
Zabini shot Draco a look of disdain, then schooled his features into the emotionless mask all Pure-Bloods are taught. He nodded his head slightly, and Draco nearly let out a sigh of relief. He placed his trunk in the compartment, and walked towards the Prefect’s cabin. There were already a handful of students there, none that Draco recognized, but three evidently recognized him, judging by the three hexes and curses that flew at him. Draco couldn’t stop all three, so he deflected the two he didn’t recognize and let the stinging curse hit him in the stomach. He wanted to wince and rub the spot, but he wouldn’t let himself show any sign of pain, he wouldn’t give the bastard the satisfaction.
Harry took a deep breath, fought back all of the thoughts telling him how horrible of an idea this was, and gathered his Gryffindor courage. “I was hoping to move from friends to something more.”
Harry just nodded, but thought Neville was probably the only Gryffindor who would be able to live with Malfoy. He knew Pavarti, but Harry did not think he had ever interacted with the other girl in Gryffindor robes. Hermione followed his gaze, “That’s Lily Moon. She only talked to Sally Smith, as they were both Pure Bloods; Sally was Zacharias Smith’s younger sister. Sally died during the battle, taking a curse to save Lily’s life. They both fought to protect Hogwarts.”
“I never thought I would be doing this, but I believe it would be foolish not to. It does irk me that I am showing the same disregard of the rules concerning you that Dumbledore did, but I will swallow my ire. Mr. Potter you are an extremely talented wizard in the field of Defense Against the Dark Arts. I am also very impressed by your teaching skills, both this year and when you led ‘Dumbledore’s Army.’ Don’t let it go to your already over-inflated head, Potter. What are your plans for after this term?”
“You will need to have at least five N.E.W.T.S., the first three years will be probationary years to avoid another professor like myself or Hartley, and you will need to spend at least four nights a week in Hogwarts. However, any future spouse or family will be permitted to stay with you here on those nights.” Harry was surprised by the list.
“I didn’t know Draco was the one asking Dobby to bring me food, because Dobby wouldn’t tell me. I haven’t told anyone why I don’t go to the Great Hall, sir.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bell rang dismissing the class and everyone raced towards the door, but Hartley’s voice rang out. “Mr. Potter, I have a note from the Headmaster here. Take it so I’m not tempted to read it.” Harry bit back a sigh and walked to the desk; grabbing the note, he said a quick word of thanks, and walked out of the classroom. Ron and Hermione did not hear Hartley telling Harry to grab the note, and hadn’t noticed that Harry wasn’t walking with them anymore. Harry was ok with that as he didn’t want to make an excuse for why Snape wanted to see him; his friends only spoke to him while they were walking to breakfast, and seemed to forget him throughout the day. Harry’s plan to distance himself was working, but he still felt a pang of sadness when his friends forgot about him.
“Honestly, you three, do you think I agree with his decision to keep those people out of Azkaban? No, but there’s nothing we can do about it now. He’s gone through enough, so we shouldn’t hold his decision against him. We’re the closest thing he has to family, and you need to let it go.” Mrs. Weasley’s voice was harsh, but Harry felt numb that even Mrs. Weasley hated him because he testified for the kids their age and Mrs. Malfoy.
James and Lily had recently glamoured their features so they wouldn’t be recognizable until their memories came back. Harry, on the other hand, had taken off most of his glamour last week in front of James and Lily; he had left his eyes a few shades darker than Lily’s, though. Lily had noticed right away that Harry looked very similar to her husband, and the cover story he came up with was that he was a distant cousin to James. James was delighted to have family, so twice now he had tried to convince Harry to hang around so they could get to know each other better.
Again Potter was staring at him with that strange expression. “You reminded me of my bully of a cousin when we first met, so I instantly disliked you. I’m sorry for implying you were the wrong sort, I mean you might have been but I don’t really know. Anyways, you’re definitely not the wrong sort of wizard anymore. So, um, friends?” Potter’s cheeks had flushed and he was rubbing the back of his neck with his left hand. His right hand was held out.
She raised her eyebrows, “My mother disowned me after the Battle because she did not agree with my stance, so I stayed in Muggle London until the beginning of this term. I volunteered because it wasn’t fair that I wasn’t ordered to do community service. I picked up a bit of slang when a few children poked fun at me for my dialect.”
Then Draco whispered into his ear right before placing a hand at the small of his back, “Breathe, love, it’s business as usual. They’re not staring at you because they hate you; they’re staring because you're gorgeous.”
“Mr. Potter, I was waiting for you. Walk with me.” Snape turned around and Harry had no choice but to follow.
shows an echo from the wand's last spells, and Voldemort did cast the killing curse at your parents. It wasn’t ghosts coming from the wand; they were merely echoes retaining the appearance and character of the victim of the spell. The Resurrection Stone appearance was made by a charm of my own invention. When I finally had the stone, but was not able to use it, I created a charm that would seemingly allow me to talk to the people I had lost, though they were also just echoes with the appearance and character of the loved ones.”
Draco’s mouth opened and closed a few times before he took a deep breath that he released in an audible sigh. “I didn’t think you would want to talk to me ever again; I was terrible to you.” Draco still wasn’t looking at Harry.
They had decided on using a surrogate mother for the first two, and then adopt at least one more; the first surrogate mother would be Lily Moon, an old friend of the couple and a pureblood. Neither Harry nor Draco much cared about the pureblood part, but Draco’s mother did so their first child would be a pureblood to avoid an argument. Hermione agreed to surrogate for the second kid, but she was busy settling into her career to do it within the next couple of years. Harry was relieved to have someone else tell them to wait, as he would probably want the next kid within a year and that would be a lot of work.
Hermione hesitated, but said, “No one really understands how a man that looks just like James Potter showed up at the Three Broomsticks. They’re even more confused as to why Severus was the one talking to him; their rivalry was more notorious than I expected. At least the Daily Prophet didn’t put it on the front page; Ginny suddenly leaving the Harpies to write for the sports section was more newsworthy.”
When I first started writing this story, Harry leading a study group is what I had in mind to start to bring him out of his depression. I thought it would be a way for him to feel needed without being the "Chosen One."
“Hullo, Draco. Thanks for bringing us food, even after your aunt hurt you. We heard your screams for hours after the first time.” Draco felt his cheeks blush at the blunt honesty of this girl, and his throat closed up. He nodded and looked out the window to avoid the girl’s penetrating stare. He didn’t deserve her thanks, he was just acting like a human should;
“Thanks. Yeah, I hope it’ll work out. I also wanted to talk to you about moving into Grimmauld Place with me after this year. Lily, Pansy, and Blaise too because I have the room.”
Harry looked at the ceiling above him. He was lying on his back in his room at number 12 Grimmauld Place. The whole room was dirty and dusty because he had forbidden Kreacher from entering. He gave the order and then took out his wand to cut his wrists with the intention of dying again. However, Kreacher ignored his order and rushed in saving Harry’s life. Harry had been so angry that Kreacher saved his life; Kreacher had croaked, close to tears, that house-elves could disobey their masters in matters of life and death, and he wasn’t going to let Harry die. Harry felt bad for upsetting Kreacher, but couldn’t help be resentful that his plan failed.
“I barely passed, Granger; did you pass with an O, then? Is that why you’re attempting to help?” He snapped at the bushy-hair girl. He felt ashamed immediately for the harsh tone, but could not find it in himself to apologize. She sighed and started packing up her bag. Draco shoved all of his items into his own bag and stormed out of the classroom without waiting on Hermione.
Draco waved off Harry’s comment; true he could barely afford adding another thing, but he wasn’t going to not help Harry when the boy was excited about something. “I find that helping others study, helps my own studying.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“You are quite literally your own house, and as such will be permitted to qualify for the House Cup, although there will be a significant disadvantage. Since this is a temporary measure, I will be the head of your house. Now, onto the matter of Quidditch, if there are not enough people who would like to play then we won’t have a team, but if there is a team, we will be entered into the Quidditch Cup. The Quidditch captain will be, as much as it pains me, Harry Potter; speak to him if you want to potentially join/try-out depending on the interest of your chosen position. Your Prefects are Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger. Any questions?”
“Severus, you have a wonderful life now, and you wouldn’t have your family if the damn snake killed you. Besides he might not take the position when we tell him about the charms, which I think a dinner tomorrow would be the perfect opportunity to do so.”
Draco stared at the essay he had just been handed back in despair; he could not believe it, he looked again to verify his initial glance had been correct. He felt pure misery bubble up inside him. He watched his hopes and dreams fall apart as the last little bit of hope left him. He could not stand to look at the essay, but he could not look away.
“Why were you so easy to forgive my father?” Harry blurted out the question without thinking about it.
His mother looked surprised at this information, but schooled her features to show no emotion like a proper pure-blood. Draco had decided in Azkaban that he no longer would be a proper pure-blood, and his mother did not know how to deal with that.
On his first couple of days back, Harry wrote a thank you note to all of the professors who had helped him throughout the years and delivered most of them with his first batch of homework. He had even gone to Snape and requested to be enrolled in the Care of Magical Creatures class so he could do the same to Hagrid. After a lot of pleading, Snape relented and allowed him to join the class. Harry had worked out how to create a charm so that Snape’s, Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Mrs. Weasley’s were delivered once he died, as they would be suspicious of the motive. All of the professors had pulled Harry aside and thanked him profusely for the note, and were a little teary eyed.
Harry was quiet for a spell. “I don’t think it’s silly,” he whispered. He cleared his throat as he watched Lily close her eyes. “Why do you use Muggle slang?”
Harry still couldn’t move his head to look at her, or any part of his body. The feeling of uselessness was too strong, and made it impossible to do more than blink. He heard Hermione sigh, and then felt her sit down on the bed beside him.
“No. They can replay the memories of this room and see that I followed you in here; I have no intention of going to Azkaban with my father, Potter, so I will stay here until you leave and then follow you until we go back to the common room.”
Severus sneered, Hillary laughed, and Marcus started chattering excitedly about everything he saw on the way here. Hillary was a Muggle, so they rode the bus to get to the restaurant apparently. Marcus was in the middle of telling Harry all about a random lady’s hat when the Waller’s approached. Harry knew the fact he was holding Marcus was the only reason his knees didn’t give out when he saw his mother, and he saw Severus pale at the sight of her.
Harry had been back at Hogwarts for almost two and a half weeks, and had been leaving the Eighth year common room every night at midnight for the last six days with his invisibility cloak on. He had rushed through the corridors to an abandoned classroom, the perfect place in his opinion as it was never used and not close to anything a student might stumble into, and pulled out his wand. He never uttered the first syaball before a “Stop, Potter” was said into the room, and Malfoy would light up his wand. Every single time it was the same thing, and Harry was starting to get irritated.
Draco shook his head to dislodge the bitter thoughts, and reached for another piece of fruit. The morning owls hadn’t come yet, which was strange. He did not mention it to his mother, though, because she was very angry that every piece of mail in and out of the manor was being read. It was because both of them were on probation, and the ministry was worried that they were talking to some of the escaped Death Eaters. His mother thought it was a waste of time and resources, and resented the invasion of privacy.
The group’s outraged looks turned to one of pity, which put Harry on edge. He hated being pitied, and he barely avoided getting angry at them.
Harry wanted to roll his eyes, but Severus would be very cross with him if he did. He went back to silently watching the door. Three minutes before the interview was scheduled to start, James walked in. Severus’s breath hissed through his teeth, and Harry felt his heart drop. He looked like an older version of Harry, except he had different eyes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Did Trelawney say that, or did the universe speak to you?” Draco snorted. For the first time since the beginning of the school year, Potter shot an angry look at Draco.
“I think it would be fun to try out for chaser,” said a girl Harry was sure he had never seen before. “As will I,” said Ernie Macmillion. “I think I’ll try out for a beater position, Harry,” said Seamus. Harry quickly became overwhelmed as so many voices started telling him how good of a flyer they were, or what position they wanted to try out for. Finally Harry backed away from them, and Hermione reigned in the crowd.
“I know it seems insane, but nobody else really wanted the position that would help. Also, when he gave out the punishment, it seemed like it made sense. Snape does hate children, so it would be a punishment. The Minister made sure that Snape wouldn’t be able to bully the students anymore, and he can’t show favoritism.”
“Mrs. Weasly would never recover from seeing this, especially knowing why it happened. Give me the potion and convince her not to come up.” Ron nodded and handed her the vial.
“Due to this new policy of inter-house unity, none of you will be sharing a room with someone from your house. If I learn that any of you have vandalized someone else’s trunk or possessions, I assure you, you will be expelled. There are ten rooms, meaning three to a room; five rooms in the female’s wing and five rooms in the male’s wing. Each room has a small separate bathroom attached that you have to share with your roommates, so be conscious of time. Your trunk has already been placed in your room, and there will be no moving. The room assignments are:
Severus cleared his throat and Harry knew he was fighting to keep his face emotionless. So Harry took over to give the man time.
“Thanks for agreeing to help. I really appreciate it.” Harry looked slightly uncomfortable but was staring at the entire group.
“I’m a growing boy, Malfoy! I also don’t want to be all pointy like you.” Everyone laughed, and Draco sulked.
“No, but my husband, best friend, the Charms professor at Hogwarts, and Severus have all agreed to look at the charms to see. We have heard that you are very talented with charms yourself, and were hoping that you would assist. Only if you two want to try and break them.”
Severus cleared his throat and said, “I actually have some information concerning that, but I believe it would be best said in private.”
Harry nodded more enthusiastically this time as he was on more familiar ground.”I would like you to keep your ear to the ground about a assistant caretaker as Mr. Filch is requesting help. We are also still accepting student applications for the exchange program in various countries but have a few already, and here is the list of our students who would like to sign up. Please start going through the applications to see who would be a good fit.”
Draco relaxed his hand when he saw it was a second year in Slytherin robes, but wondered why she had a look of terror on her face. Pansy asked her what was going on, and the girl stammered out about a Gryffindor boy trying to hex her. She had barely gotten the words out, when the doors opened again. Draco pointed his wand at the sixth year, and saw Pansy and Zabini had their own wands out but hadn’t pointed it at the intruder.
For the remainder of the session Harry would deflect one of Mira’s questions with a question about her personal life, which she would answer then repeat her question. Harry felt smugly satisfied when the woman seemed relieved that the session was over, but then listened to her say that she wanted to meet with him once a week for now. Harry paid for the session and scheduled the appointment with the receptionist who seemed a little too interested in Snape. Then he apparated back to Snape’s office, leaving a note with the next time and date for his session and the bank card.
“You old fool! How did you think this would ever be a good idea? You saved their lives, only to ensure their deaths by your hand! Go to another painting, or I will remove this one from Hogwarts!”
Harry tried to find Draco in the celebrating locker room, but the blonde boy slipped out as soon as he changed from his Quidditch robes. Harry ignored the celebrating and started out of the locker room to find Draco. Outside of the locker room, though, he ran into Snape. “Oh, hello, sir.”
Draco and Severus shared a look, before Severus stalked away. Draco cleared his throat and turned to Lily who seemed to be losing her patience at being left out of the loop.
Potter laughed softly at that, but it trailed off as sudden as it started. “That was my first time laughing since before…” Harry, no Potter, didn’t need to finish his sentence for Draco to understand; what Draco didn’t understand was the feeling in his stomach when Harry, shit Potter, admitted that Draco made him laugh for the first time in months. Draco cursed himself, he had a childish crush on the Saviour before he met Harry Potter, and then ruthlessly squashed the crush when the prat refused his handshake. He could not start crushing on the Golden Boy again.
Lily Moon was staring at him with a concerned look on her face, and a hand unconsciously resting on her stomach. The stomach that was housing his child because Lily agreed to be a surrogate for him and Draco. She deserved the truth, and so did everyone else at this table. They had been there for him so often throughout the years, and, after all, they were his family.
Granger walked into the cabin shortly after Draco, and everyone stood a little straighter and tried to talk to her. She was polite to them all, but was visibly uncomfortable; Draco wondered if she enjoyed the fact that Potter received the majority of the spotlight, so she could stay out of it. Draco felt the train start to move, and realized that the only “Eighth Years” in the cabin were him and Granger. He expected at least one from each house, but then he didn’t know how many eighth years there were or how they were going to be sorted this year. None of the letters had mentioned, Draco just assumed they would stay in their regular dormitories due to Slughorn sending him a letter.
“Hi, Draco. I’m revising the tutoring schedule because Luna’s friend, Macy, can’t lead the fourth year Charms session tomorrow night.” Draco felt his eye twitch as he knew that Harry would ask him to cover the session if he had no other obvious solution. It was obvious that Harry was toning down on asking Draco to tutor since so many sixth and seventh years had volunteered. Him volunteering his time to Harry had caused him to produce such vile work for his Astronomy essay, but he could never say no to Harry.
“I understand. I wish I could promise that I won’t kill myself, but I’m not supposed to be alive. Nothing anyone can say or do will change that, and until I die, the universe will be unbalanced.”
“I was thinking of having a rotating tutor for the other subjects, as it is quite a big commitment; I know you will want to take every year, Harry, but maybe think about sharing the responsibility with at least one other. You still have your own classwork and Quidditch to think about.”
Harry couldn’t believe he had almost let himself feel happy, he didn’t deserve happiness. George, Percy, and Ginny were right, he didn’t deserve their forgiveness either. Harry felt disgust rise up so violently, that he nearly vomited right in the Weasley’s kitchen. Harry ran outside to avoid the possibility of vomiting in the kitchen, and heard the remaining Weasley’s and Hermione call his name. Bill and Fleur heard the commotion, and asked Harry what was wrong; he just shook his head and started dry heaving.
Severus, James, and Harry negotiated a date and time until they were able to reach something that worked for all three of them. When they hung up, Severus and Harry looked at each other; both were white and visibly shocked. Then they both turned to the portrait of Albus Dumbledore, who was still wearing the sorrowful expression. Severus whispered very lowly, “Explain Albus.”
Harry nodded his head slightly, and Hermione let out another small shriek and hugged him. Then she started talking about getting food, and walked out of the room. Harry felt slightly bad that Hermione was excited about him joining her, when he was only doing it to make it easier to kill himself. Hermione walked back in with the food and an anxious look on her face.
McTavish glared at the pair of Gryffindors for a few seconds, and then Potter shoved the boy away. Draco heard footsteps down the corridor, and Longbottom stared at Potter for a few seconds. Draco couldn’t tell what the look was about, but was waiting for the duo to turn their attention on the Slytherins. He then saw a purple light fly past Longbottom, and heard a crash and yelp. Longbottom looked behind him and said, “There was no reason for that, Ron.”
“For the deception to work, Dumbledore needed to put memory charms on them. He said they shouldn’t be failing, and if my parents continued regaining their memories the way they are currently remembering them, it could cause their minds to collapse. I’m assuming something like Lockhart’s curse from second year.”
“Zabini saw your wrist on the train, and we have been monitoring ever since. Not that we care,” Draco sneered this and ignored the pang of guilt, “but we would rather not be blamed for the Saviour of the Wizarding World’s death. Which we will be as we are here in Hogwarts with you.”
Harry nodded, and the two were silent once more. After what seemed to be an intense conversation, Lily and James came back over. James still looked shocked, but seemed to accept the information.
“Bloody hell, it’s already time to decide where we’re staying for the holiday. Where will you be, Harry?”
The crowd wasn’t praising Harry anymore, and Ron and Hermione looked at Harry with an unreadable expression. “Why did you protect her, mate?” Ron asked with an accusing tone, and Harry merely shrugged in response. Hermione looked away without saying anything. Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasly, and Ginny had seen it happen, as well; they didn’t say anything either, but Ginny sneered at Harry. Harry felt a hand clasp his shoulder suddenly, and looked back to see Neville.
Her voice was pleasant and she spoke in a manner that put Harry on edge for an unknown reason, “I’m Harry Potter, and I’m eighteen. I lost my parents when I was one, and the man that murdered them, Voldemort, tried to kill me as well. The scar it gave me made me famous, and Voldemort targeted me almost every year at school after I turned eleven.” Mira looked shocked and wrote down something in her notebook.
Snape stared at Harry for another minute before glaring at Ron and Hermione, they both repeated that they understood. Ron called Snape a git underneath his breath while the man was walking away, and Hermione hit him in the arm. Then Ron looked at him and said, “Well, I reckon I want to be the Keeper for the team, Harry.” Harry just inclined his head towards Ron without saying anything, but Ron had said this fairly loud and people had started walking up to Harry.
“Oh, good. This house elf,” Mom glared at Kreacher while saying that, “wouldn’t let us up. What’s going on? Is Harry hurt?”
“I have to tell the headmaster, it’s school rules Mr. Potter. He won’t make it worse.” Harry could tell that Madame Pomfrey didn’t believe her own assurance, but he just shrugged his shoulders. “You can go to class today, and now that I know my thank you note was because of this, I wish I never received it. Nobody should live this way without trying to get help; I understand your hesitation to go to one, as I subscribe to the Daily Prophet, but there should be one that’s different than that slimy -.” She cut herself off and looked embarrassed, then cleared her throat to continue.  “I’m not a licensed Mind Healer or I would offer to help. Goodbye, Mr. Potter.” She hugged Harry quickly and he walked towards the library as he had two free periods this morning before Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“I don’t understand why we are waiting on Granger, her and Weasley won’t be coming down for a while. Nev and I nearly didn’t come down to join this fun party.” Neville turned bright red and Draco raised his eyebrow at the Gryffindor who turned impossibly redder.
Harry drank deeply from his glass, and Draco raised his eyebrow at his husband. Harry had not told Draco about his parents yet, and it was weighing on him. He kept making excuses to himself, but none of them truly made sense. It had been over a week, and James’s next interview was in four days. Harry suddenly realized that Draco could help with potentially breaking the charm if his parents wanted that.
After finishing that, Snape stalked out of the common room. Harry almost felt amused that two of Ginny’s ex-boyfriends were going to be sharing a room, but that was all he knew about the Ravenclaw boy. Which was more than he knew about Zabini, he had only interacted with the boy once. He looked over at Ron and he clapped Harry’s shoulder, “Bad luck getting stuck with a Slytherin, but better Zabini than Malfoy. Poor Neville.”
“Keeping someone safe from harm is more important than school; it’s obvious that you’re not inclined to keep yourself safe, so I’ll keep intervening. That doesn’t mean we’re friends.”
Hermione found him there about twenty minutes later, and tried to hide her concerned look. She smiled at him gently, and said that the food was ready. He thanked her, and went with her back outside. More people were there now, including Minister Shacklebolt, Andy and Teddy, Hagrid, and Dobby. Dobby instantly ran over to Harry and wailed about how honored he was to be invited to the celebration. Harry gently reminded Dobby that he had saved Harry’s life quite a few times, and he deserved to be there. Dobby started crying loudly at this, and Hermione tried to calm him down.
The ancient armchair by the common room exit was slouching under Harry’s weight, Draco noticed. He noticed a lot of other things too as he emerged from the stairwell: the way Harry’s flying kit clung to every muscle and dip, his casual smile as he chatted to a nearby Ravenclaw, the way nobody watched Draco as he walked – not until he stopped dead in front of Harry. That caught a significant amount of attention, several people not so subtly brandishing their wands in preparation for a confrontation. Instead, Harry grinned at him.
Instead of giving into Draco’s touch in an exposed corridor, Harry turned in his hold. His fingers slipped under Draco’s shirt easily, finding the matching tattoo embedded in Draco’s hip and leaning down to press a long kiss to it. If only to return the favour. If only to watch the way Draco arched towards him, his entire body stretching as his head tipped towards the ceiling with a blissfully sinful moan.
Fletcher was relentless, nudging him eagerly. She had a grand conspiracy concocting inside her overactive imagination. Those were excellent for solving cases, but Draco had heard her track record for fucking up her personal life with false deductions. He would prefer not to be on the receiving end. Those situations often became… messy.
Granger narrowed her eyes, tossing several glances between Draco and Potter. His cheek was squashed against Draco’s thigh as it had been for 20 minutes, sleeping soundly with the blanket tucked around his shoulders. He looked at peace. So, Draco challenged Granger’s suspicion with a loaded glare. She caved and backed away, keeping her eyes on them until she reached the stairs. Then, she was gone.
The voice that emerged was fierce and confident, a powerful lull falling around them.  The birds seemed to stop singing outside. That wasn’t why Draco paused, rather it was that the voice had a hint of sympathy.
“No, you don’t,” Harry mumbled. His fingers slid beneath Draco’s shirt, skimming the cold skin and lighting it up. Draco shifted his body automatically, remaining on his back but moving ever so slightly closer to Harry. “Stay with me, please, for a little while. Let’s not leave yet.”
He grabbed his wand as he swung himself off the sofa and tentatively stepped towards the door, reaching for the handle. Preparatory inhale. Then, he yanked the door open.
He left half an hour later, once he’d finished several chapters and Potter was fast asleep, his fringe splayed messily against his forehead. The floorboards creaked under Draco’s weight but Potter didn’t stir. As Draco slipped under his covers, he wondered whether Potter stayed there the entire night. Nobody could blame him; Weasley’s snoring was shaking the tower tonight.
He was quickly swatted in the arm and hushed as Potter indicated towards the two suspects. They’d straightened up, stood together, admiring their handy work. Their heads tipped to the side as they stared at it. Then, the two subjects were gone.
“That, I can.” Harry’s voice cut in. He slipped around his friends’ sofa and sat himself down at Draco’s side, curving into the gap Draco had prepared for him.
He pressed against Draco until he could practically feel the soul mark against his body, and he guided one of Draco’s lazy hands to his own forearm, where sure enough his skin was ignited by a grazing touch.
“You should know that the conversation Fletcher and I were having earlier…we didn’t— she acts like that sometimes,
He made a mental note of the artists mentioned, vowing to give them a try later. Fletcher would be proud; she might even try to drag him to a few concerts. She did attend those rather frequently, rocking up to the office the next morning, a grin stretched across her worn-out face. Perhaps, Draco did already have a brilliant tour guide, if he’d only ask.
It was only when Fletcher caught up to him in the Ministry hallway the next morning that Draco spoke another word.
The atmosphere was stilted as he entered, although there seemed to be no correlation or causation. The beginning of the week was always rough. Fletcher offered a tired smile as she slumped behind her desk and began flipping through her files. Worker after worker piled in, the last stumbling through the door twenty minutes late with a small coffee stain on their sleeve.
“Here we are,” Potter remarked as he rolled to a stop in a roadside parking bay. He pulled a long lever upwards and the engine fizzed off.
Fletcher offered to buy him dinner if Draco closed the case in six weeks. She said this through a mouthful of chocolate and washed it down with swig of the tea she’d brought, so Draco was a little sceptical of her genuineness.
Pansy and Theo attended, offering condolences and well-meaning words of support. They only made Draco feel emptier.
Harry hovered over the spread of his body for a moment, lingering, creating a moment of suspense in the air between their almost-bare bodies. His hands were planted on either side of Draco's shoulders. Then he dropped with an
The cult was nameless as far as they knew. The department had managed to pick up some malicious whispers and chatter over the past few months, mere suggestions offered by other case suspects they’d brought in for questioning, who were desperate for an inch of leeway. There was nothing significant to evidence the rumours, the chatter was merely static on an undercurrent of the overall black market.
“This doesn’t mean anything,” Draco said, promptly following Potter as he set off in a slow walk upon the response. He caught up in a manner of seconds. “I’m simply curious.”
“For the love of Slytherin, tell me it’s not true.” She hissed at him. Draco pressed his lips together as she stared at the side of his face. “Draco. You did not scream at Harry Potter like… like an
Nothing that couldn’t be drowned out by other thoughts. Draco was well trained in dismissing the flashing alerts in his head, the searing memories. Wasn’t everyone after the war? Ignoring, moving on, pretending, silently suffering.
under his breath and Draco caught sight of a glimmer in the air, although it vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
Anyway, Draco was somewhat content with the uninteresting life he led without any unnecessary and pointless dreams to juggle. He had plenty; he had his mother and his studies and his friends and Potter, he supposed. Although, in the eyes of the world, nobody truly had Potter.
“I just had a conversation with one of the suspects.” Said Draco as he lowered himself back beside her and took his place once again. It was damp.
“Harry, I owe you an apology,” Pansy said from his right side. Her voice was charming and light, precisely designed to win over even the least susceptible recipient.
? Draco knew how to play the innocent fool, he knew how to feign disinterest. It would be no trouble acting as though nothing had happened. Even still, he had an uncomfortable feeling settling in his stomach. Because Harry made him want to be 99.8% honest, which was an accomplishment for almost any Slytherin.
As they explored each other’s bodies in the back room, Draco walking Potter against an overflowing bookshelf, the world seemed to still. He found the dips in Potter’s hips and the Adam’s apple in his throat and the sharp inhales when his hands dropped much lower. There, bodies pressed against pointy book spines, came the moment from all the modern fiction stories he’d been reading - a wash of emotion, an animalistic need to please, coated in a chant of
knows Shacklebolt is up for the Minister position. Didn’t he already turn down the role after the war? They’re going to force him up on the highest pedestal eventually; nobody else wants the job, let’s face it.”
Draco requested the bill sometime after their plates were wiped clean and he had mere droplets left in his wine glass.
Potter waved half-heartedly, his attention elsewhere. The moment Draco took a step towards the door, Potter had already hooked a neighbouring customer into a conversation, swinging back on his chair with a smile.
can be hidden from the eyes of the media and the courts when you contribute to the deaths of thousands of people.” He said, folding his arms and staring out of the window. Perhaps the darkness would calm him.
“Harry, there’s no place I’d rather be than by your side,” Draco replied against his neck, pressing a chaste kiss to the warm skin.
He didn’t return one, instead discarding Fletcher’s touch and striding across the room to deposit his notes on the desk. The owl hooted at him again as he brushed past, narrowly avoiding locking eyes with Potter. Now that would be unfortunate after the smiling incident, Draco could already feel the heat snaking up his neck ready to pounce on his cheeks.
“Hey! I do not pay him that much--!” Draco began to argue, but Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office door had opened, and he halted. “Forget it. Good morning, sir.”
The music floating from some sort of radio in the centre became the only sound within the interior of the minibus. It was muggle music, strange tunes and raspy vocals repeating in different versions.
Draco didn’t want to let go of Harry after Hogwarts. Even if they had still been rivals, it would’ve been true. Some part of Draco had always been tied to Harry, just as their combined actions somehow led to the Dark Lord’s downfall. He didn’t believe their connection would be constrained to a school rivalry and friendship. Harry was more than that, they were more than that. And so,
Harry’s eyes narrowed slightly, swinging to the faces beyond the pair of them. He turned and led the way into the slightly darker corridor.
One day turned into a weekend, spiralling into a week bedridden, open-mouthed kisses on firm thighs, until it had been a month, dancing around each other in playful circles, the rest of the world delightfully oblivious.
Draco looked back, finding friendliness where it had never existed a few weeks ago, and felt his lips twitch upwards.
Potter stared at him like Draco’s remaining intelligence had slipped out of his ear overnight. “And if they see us as a threat and attack?”
The three of them rolled onto their knees to peer down at the camp. Two of the elder members were huddled around a tree on the far perimeter, wands in their hands as they traced symbols in the air. If Draco squinted hard enough, he could almost see the blurry outline of the runes in the bark.
Draco laughed drily, only the once. “Especially if I couldn’t take Fletcher. She is a pain in my pompous arse for forty hours a week.”
“Did they diagnose Mr Griffin with anything specific?” Draco asked the lingering nurse, as they both stared through the glass.
Then, a wave of dark magic washed over Draco as he stepped over the threshold. It must’ve affected the other two in a similar way; they both shivered, unable to combat the chilling feeling that trickled down their spines.
Draco reached out for it, his fingers shaped to clasp it, but then he stopped himself. There was an urge to do something irrational and out of character, it consumed Draco in a tenth of a second and he couldn’t overrule it.
Then, they sipped the steaming coffees over their work, legs stretched out so far that they almost met in the middle. The heat warmed Draco from inside out.
He returned the next week. She greeted him with a smile and a cup of tea. Draco listened a little, but it was mainly him talking, sifting through the influx of damaging thoughts that cropped up at each subject. He left once they’d conceived a plan to continue their discussions during term time.
. It was the spitting image of a sixth-year’s disastrous attempt at a draught of living death. Draco knew to avoid suspicious substances like these; he’d learnt that the hard way in the summer of fourth year.
Perhaps twenty members, Draco counted as he crouched behind a large boulder, and they were all dressed in robes barely thick enough to stay naturally warm. A few that had strayed from the centre had long muggle coats dangling off their shoulder. The wards shimmered in the air a few feet from his position; they would be enough to subtly deter muggles from the area, but any half-competent wizard would be capable of detecting the diversion effect.
Harry looked backwards at their intertwined hands, at the overlay of white and brown skin, then up to the portraits of his family - his family with the same dark skin as him. He looked back again to see Draco smiling at him softly, his winter coat draped over his shoulders, chin nuzzled in the hem of his ridiculously expensive cashmere jumper.
“The lack of witnesses proves otherwise.” Draco retorted almost instantly, his eyes swinging to the shadowed flocks of trees.
Here, Draco could see a life - he could see love and family and bickering and Potter. He saw the history of Harry Potter in the very walls of this house, and the future.
Fletcher pulled a chair up next to Potter, and Draco subsequently beside her. The room filled up around them, co-workers taking their seats in a large circle (another of the Ministry’s many post-war initiatives, inspired by the infamous legend of King Arthur). Shacklebolt appeared one minute late, a number of files tucked beneath his arm as he swept in and took the only seat reserved at the head of the room.
Draco carefully headed back to their spot, remaining hidden in the shadows and edging from one to another. He saw nobody else as he did. The two group members had merely strayed, it seemed.
Patting his hair as he sat up, Draco blinked across the room. His eyes adjusted slowly to the sunlight, drifting in and out of focus, and fell upon Potter.
Potter didn’t seem to care whether he received an answer and instead kicked them headfirst into a normal conversation.
So, with nothing useful left to read, Fletcher set to work perfecting the application of the tracking spell to a map. She had applied it the day before and despite the challenges of consistently tracking this number of people under a single spell, nothing had collapsed yet.
“So, you just need to hold this,” Potter said, lifting some sort of nozzle off the wall and plugged it into the compartment. He grabbed Draco’s wrist and tugged until Draco took hold of the blasted thing. “And squeeze. It’ll stop automatically. Just put it back on the wall when it’s finished. All right?”
Potter was rising to his feet, so Draco turned his attention back. There was an amicability present as Potter left the room, a wave bidding him goodbye. Whether they had received the answers they desperately wanted or not, he had made an impression.
“Brilliant,” Potter set off in a brisk walk, glancing over his shoulder expectantly until Draco caught up. “They have this fantastic risotto Hermione has been raving about for weeks, I’ve been meaning to try it.”
The pair of cult members were crouched around a particularly average tree, their wands tracing the same symbols in the air that he’d seen before. His suspicions had been correct. Now, he just had to unveil the truth. Whatever that entailed.
“You’ve never told me a secret either!” Draco blurted, a little childishly, a little pink in the cheeks.
The victim of his natural gaze was leant against the kitchen counter, his own china cup clutched between two palms, lips pouted as he cooled the contents with gentle breaths. He looked tired, sleepless even.
But it was a fool’s prediction. Tarot cards were used by the uneducated, the wizards and witches who failed to see the inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Forecasting life events that never happened, foreshadowing apocalyptic disasters that had not yet come to be. It was child’s play in the complications of fate.
A large bottle of orange liquid was shoved in his direction, without much of a choice. Draco took it hesitantly, eyeing the plastic lining, and read the printed words.
Draco knew it was unnatural that they were colleagues, bound by labour contracts to slave away at desks in the same room.
The glass was empty within ten minutes and another was poured, swirled, and drank. Draco slid into his bed sheets a little later, sufficiently numb, avoiding the prospect of the upcoming week. Sleep came in waves of distorted dreams and broken hearts.
Her face scrunched in disgust and she turned away to fake a quick vomit. Draco noticed she had pins clipped into her hair, small symbols of love and equality, he hid the small smile they summoned.
“Not at all. Only for people like her—” Draco exhaled audibly. “People like her didn’t deserve to be demonised. They made a number of ill-informed decisions. Maybe they were trying to save their families, trying to save their own necks, Merlin knows. But Fletcher should be allowed to live without the unbearable torment.”
Despite the many, many reasons he didn’t deserve such an easily achieved peace, he wished it would return. If only so Fletcher didn’t continue casting sad looks interwoven with a hint of sadistic pleasure.
Potter stood up, brushing his jeans quickly as he did. He rested against the trunk, if only for a second,  long enough for Draco’s gaze to skip up his toned body and settle on his glasses.
He hadn’t even quizzed Potter yet about the insane reasons they weren’t travelling by portkey or the floo or standard old Apparition. All in all, Draco was a little too bewildered to comprehend it.
He watched Draco from his narrow half of the bed. It was another ten minutes before either closed their eyes. Draco spent the time scouring Harry’s face, memorizing each slope and shadow and curve. Harry looked back at him.
Draco never trusted anything Potter touched to be harmless. He had a long list of references to back him up.
“I’ve already got approval from Kingsley for a three-day visit.” Potter continued, his gaze floating lazily between them. His eye bags were particularly prominent today. “So, as long as neither of you have any plans this weekend…?”
The interior was much nicer than the outside, Draco decided, as he settled into a leather seat and laid his bag at his feet. There was a long, smooth platform of grey plastic opposite him, which connected to the large window that he could stare out.
“It’s been five fucking years since the end of the war, you know?” Draco continued with indignation as Fletcher fixed him with a pained expression, which read ‘
“What is this place?” Draco asked hesitantly, still eyeing the back of the vehicle as the engine jumped to life again.
He climbed quickly out of the vehicle, dropping to his unsteady feet. Solid ground, thank Salazar. Draco could kiss it: gravel, chippings, and all.
Draco made a move to stand up, to usher himself out of whatever alternate universe he’d stumbled upon. But Potter rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, it was a hard, foreign weight on his shoulder that somehow didn’t feel out of place, and Draco paused. His mind listed all the possible schemes of Potter’s this action could be linked to, eliminating the least likely. Only a short list remained.
It was curious though, Griffin’s behaviour. Had it existed before the cult? Or was the cult responsible for the damage to his mind? The latter seemed most likely, on the wide spectrum of possibilities.
Through his laughter, that notably lasted throughout the entire lunch, Draco could see genuine happiness in Pansy’s eyes. He was relieved.
Fletcher tugged him to Case 341’s specially allocated room a couple of times a day to discuss another theory of hers. She had a hundred and one suspicions about the group’s activities and their grand plan. Draco shot down approximately 60% of them. Meanwhile, Potter occasionally appeared to offer a comment or two. Sometimes he was already in the room, curled up behind his desk, reading the same case file over and over again. In those instances, he didn’t seem to hear Fletcher or Draco; they might as well not be there. Potter’s mind seemed to be elsewhere anyway.
“My name is Margaret Bixley. During our sessions, I will not judge, criticise nor will I reveal any of the information disclosed to the outside world. Everything you say remains in these four walls
“They walked.” Potter remarked when they’d gotten comfortable and Fletcher was handing around the first round of chocolate snacks.
“Here you go.” Fletcher passed over something wrapped in coloured plastic and nudged Draco with another. “I wasn’t sure what you’d like, so I went with the safe bet.”
“And I was quite enjoying my free period,” Draco said pointedly, looking away with his chin lifted high. It was awfully dusty in here, the particles were crawling under his skin (and his freshly washed robes). “What do you want…
“Is Juniper asleep?” Potter asked, his eyes flickering up to the mirror that was positioned to hang from the ceiling.
“Hang on,” He replied, yanking the map out of his pocket and flipping it open. Upon the image of Great Britain, a cluster of red dots blinked in the south of Devon, except for the missing two. In their place, red dots flashed somewhere between Manchester and Nottingham. “They’re in the Peak District? Somewhere in the north.”
“Certainly more than I used to.” He answered, wary of where his words may land him. Potter’s perception of him seemed to be continuously fluctuating, and Draco was the only one who could steer it vaguely in the right direction.
They meandered back to the original site, checking the path for any evidence they might have missed, and then split up in three directions with the aim of checking out the wider area. They managed to increase their investigative radius by fifty foot each hour. Draco, though not acclimatised to field work, joined Fletcher crawling on their knees to check out any mysterious symbols on trees. The majority seemed to be sleazy muggle graffiti, including several
They set off, Potter’s hands clutching a circular, cushioned pipe of sorts as the car’s engine roared to life. Draco had read that much about the muggles’ preferred means of transport – for his own safety really – but he still couldn’t quite figure out how the thing worked. They were propelled forward, merging into the rest of the cars with ease, with a constant tremor that must stem from the engine he’d read about.
“Juniper wasn’t kidding about swearing in her sleep.” Potter said as he packed a few items into the cupboards and began fixing up some sort of breakfast for himself.
“Mum, you know he wouldn’t like that. St. Mungo’s doesn’t respect his healer/patient confidentiality, and the Daily Prophet would make it into a Death Eater attack. Hermione healed us just fine when we were hunting Horcruxes, he’ll be fine.”
“That’s not how this works, Ms. Batson. You have additional responsibilities now, and you need to follow through with the commitments added to your schedule from those responsibilities.”
“What’s one more blow to my life by Dumbledore? It has been six years since he sent me to die in the Forbidden Forest by Voldemort’s hand, so I guess it was time for him to deliver another devastating blow.”
Zabini sighed, “Well this provides a problem. If Potter kills himself, we will certainly be blamed. The Wizarding World will most certainly not accept that they missed the signs”
“Potter, don’t be foolish. You possess a mediocre amount of talent, as much as I loathe to admit it, and have been captain before. There will be no further discussion on the matter.” Snape bit these statements out so harshly Weasley opened his mouth to retaliate. Before he could say anything, Granger elbowed him in the ribs. Snape sneered at the Golden Trio and led the students to the dormitories they would be sharing.
He thought of the pile of homework that he needed to do, especially with the three hour chunk of time he had dedicated to Quidditch tomorrow. He was relieved though, that they only had one three hour practice a week and still managed to be an unbeatable team. He was sure that Ron would try to force them to practice more if they weren’t so good; their third game would be in three weeks on Sunday, so hopefully they beat Gryffindor like they beat Slytherin and Ravenclaw. It would secure their claim to the Quidditch Cup, and he would have an additional three hours a week.
“I don’t think you were going to do it; you started finding your own path not forged by people forcing their expectations on you and realized it makes you happy.”
Harry stared at Dr. Johnson, not quite believing her. He took a deep breath and decided to trust her anyways. He wanted help, which surprised him, but he was terrified to ask for it. “I feel like I should be dead, and I wanted to die for a long time. Now I still feel like I should die, but I don’t want to. I want to continue tutoring, talk to Draco, build a friendship with Blaise, Pansy, and Neville, and apologize to Hermione and Ron. I want to laugh and smile and be angry and be sad, not just these ghosts of emotions all the time.”
“Well, I see that all of you that owled back did come, I’m surprised. As you can tell you will be eating separate from your house for the remainder of the year; you will also be staying in a separate dormitory which I will be leading you to shortly. Since your sleeping and eating arrangements differ from your house, any points you earn or have taken away will come from a new communal hourglass.” Draco looked up as Snape’s hand waived in the air, and saw a new hourglass with the Hogwarts crest above it appear amongst the other four.
Harry was trying to process everything Snape had told him, but shook his head in response to the question about the bank card. Snape sighed and flicked his wand, and a small rectangle flew at Snape. “This is mine, I will be reimbursed by the Hogwarts fund. I would recommend looking into it, but should you pay with your own funds, you will be reimbursed for up to three sessions a week. It is a fund I set up new this year, and you will not be the first taking advantage, Potter. See how many sessions a week you need, and then I will take down the Apparition Wards for my office only at those times. First you will go with me since you do not know where to go. Ready?”
“Indeed.” Harry and Snape had reached the gargoyle leading up to the headmaster’s office. “I believe that I will set up office hours for the students to voice their concerns to me and to be more accessible next year. What do you think, Mr. Potter?”
James grinned and shook Draco’s offered hand, “James, please; nice to meet you. This is my wife Lily, my oldest daughter Alice who just turned 17, my son Sirius who is 14, and my youngest daughter Minerva who is 11.”
Harry knocked on the door and heard a silky voice say, “Come in.” Snape sat behind the Headmaster’s desk and regarded Harry with cool, assessing eyes. Harry shut the door behind him and walked to the desk, warily. “Sit, Potter.” Harry sat down and wondered if Snape would start or end with saying that Harry was attention-seeking, or would he sneer at Harry and say he wasn’t worthy of having Lily’s eyes. After an intense stare-off, Snape finally spoke.
“Well, you see, Longbottom, he is a Death Eater. And I, frankly, don’t feel comfortable with him still being here.”
“You know, the last people to comfort me like this were probably my parents. The Dursleys despised me and it would be too awkward for my friends to do this.”
“I don’t know, but I would check the room that he tutors DADA in.” She nodded and grabbed Weasley’s arm, pulling him in that direction.
“It’s Valentine's Day, Draco. I’m surprised you and Harry aren’t still in bed too, now that I think of it.” Draco felt the bottom of his stomach drop; he could not believe that he had forgotten Valentine’s Day. He glanced at Harry who was looking at him in amusement, he then glanced at the rest of the group.
“I was afraid that it would be too much responsibility, but I seemed to have judged you aptly. Now that this commitment has ended, I would like to present you with another one. It will last much longer than one Quidditch season, though. I will not pressure you into a decision though.”
“I know that,” Potter sounded frustrated, “but you’re a bloody good flyer. I know that three out of five of the people interested in a chaser position are awful flyers. Please be a chaser for the team, I know you're decent at it.” Draco sighed as he remembered that he went and played with Potter, Blaise, Pansy, Thomas, and Longbottom on Saturday.
“Of course, Mr. Waller. I will need to consult my wife, and I have a three year old who will be upset to be left out. Thank you for the invitation, though. Shall we get started?”
“If this James Waller is telling the truth, then he would be the most qualified. However, why would someone from the States want to teach for one year here?”
Harry forced himself to stop his mind from going there, and nodded to Severus. Severus had put James Waller’s file to the side; James would be the last one they called due to the time difference between the States and the UK. They called all the other applicants and scheduled an interview for four of them, three took their names out of the running for various reasons. When it was time to call James Waller, Severus and Harry looked at each other; all Harry could think was this was the moment of truth. Would Severus recognize the voice?
The beginnings of Draco’s own crush on Harry had wormed its way into Draco’s heart, but he had been ruthlessly ignoring it. Draco knew that Harry needed a friend more than a potential boyfriend, and Draco thought Harry would probably never like the blonde boy like that anyways. However, his heart was ignoring his head’s frankly reasonable explanation. Then Harry had comforted the Slytherin girl and said all of that shit about Slythernins not being bad, and Draco had fallen in love with the messy haired, insufferable, wonderful Golden Boy. He groaned and walked into the common room.
Only one hand lifted into the air and Snape looked like he had swallowed a lemon. He kept glancing at the other students, ignoring the hand in the air. Finally he sighed and barked, “Yes, Potter?”
“I’m doing well. And yourself, Mr. Waller?” Severus’s face had paled, and Harry knew his suspicions were correct. He was speaking to his supposedly dead father, James Potter.
He found her in a cabin with her typical following; Harry did not understand why these bright children followed her around and looked up to her like she personally hung the moon and stars. Harry would also never understand why Batson seemed to enjoy her fellow classmates looking up to her.
Harry looked at Blaise in shock because he was absolutely sure that he was really good at hiding his infatuation with Draco. He had been hiding it from himself for awhile. Harry thought about saying something over Blaise’s obvious infatuation with Neville, but he didn’t think the Slytherin would be embarrassed.
Draco shrugged in response, and Harry understood what Draco was unable to say. Draco was slightly hurt to be treated as if he was already gone, but he was also thankful to not need to worry about leaving a delicate case in the hands of another healer when he did leave. Harry wrapped his arms around his husband’s waist and placed his head on his husband’s shoulder. Draco sighed heavily and then patted Harry’s hand; Harry let go and waited while Draco finished picking his tie and cufflinks.
“Oh, I forgot to mention. The new Minister of Magic decided an appropriate punishment for Snape was to force him to continue being Headmaster of Hogwarts. Much like most of the people our age, he’s on probation for the next five year, and the Minister is looking for good and substantial changes in Hogwarts to keep Snape out of Azkaban.”
“Nobody wanted to say anything, because we knew that you didn’t mean to and it would make you feel horrible. You’re just so busy with everything, that details are slipping through the cracks. It’s fine, nobody is overly hurt. We are just worried about you.”
Draco idly wondered what he would do today; he should probably start looking at the jobs the Ministry was demanding he do to help improve his character. His mother did not approve of this either, but Draco was more than happy to spend five years at a job with Muggles when the alternative was Azkaban.
“It was your responsibility to go to the Prefects’ Carriage. You need to go find Ida Rogers to learn your assignments for the day as well as your patrolling schedule.”
“He’s mean, but he also deserves to understand our lessons.” She shrugged while saying this, like it was obvious.
“Why am I cursed? First you were the obvious choice for the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor position, and now James Potter is the obvious choice for the Transfiguration professor position. That damn snake should have killed me,” Severus seethed.
“You, Potter, know that I have to make as good of grades as possible to have any chance of being awarded a Healer apprenticeship. Although you know this, you are constantly asking me for time! Try out for Quidditch, Draco! Tutor this session, Draco! Don’t spend so much time in the library, Draco! Sleep more, Draco! Eat more, Draco! Well it’s too much and I don’t have time for it all! I don’t have time to think! I don’t have time to study! I don’t have time to write to my parents! All because I have been so focused on you!”
“I believe he intended for you and Weasley to lose your memories that drastically, but possibly. I could take a look at the charms with Professor Flitwick, Hermione, and Severus. Your mother was gifted in Charms as well, yes?”
“Yes, well, it was a long time ago.” Harry looked over at Severus, shocked; where was this stance when Harry was being blamed for his father’s attitude in school. Severus narrowed his eyes at Harry, and motioned with his hand to keep Harry quiet. “I was not exactly kind to you and the rest of your gang either.”
“You should go to sleep, I’ll stay with him. Will he be ok?” Hermione nodded and said, “Yes. He’ll just need a couple more blood replenishing potions, which I can pick up tomorrow.” Then she left the room. Ron studied Harry closely, and then looked at his left wrist. There were about three scars, plus the three cuts from this attempt.
Harry saw Draco sitting in the library and walked over to the blonde boy; he had just finished his weekly session with Mrs. Johnson, and he wondered when the older woman would decide to stop the sessions since Harry only talked about unimportant things during the sessions. They had met five times now, and Harry had still not told her the name of his godfather. Truthfully, Draco was the only person he really talked to now; neither Ron or Hermione had said a word to him in weeks.
“Not to professors that she thinks can help her with her future ambitions. She does not see herself continuing with DADA after the O.W.L.S., so she does not particularly like me.”
The opportunity presented itself at the end of dinner when Lily said, “Severus, you told James that we were friends, but I don’t remember that at all.”
“I did assume that you wanted to keep an outward appearance of Slytherin Unity, Zabini. Especially since you will also be targeted this year; nobody will care that you stayed neutral, they will only care that you are a Slytherin Pure-Blood.”
“Draco, I’m so sorry for the late notice, but Andrew, the sixth year that was going to take the Charms session, had something urgent come up. Will you be able to take the session? It starts in twenty minutes.”
only seconds before Harry screamed. Harry pointed his wand at Malfoy, who just raised his hands instead of trying to defend himself, and Harry wanted to cast some curse to cause Malfoy pain. The rage was replaced by grief almost instantly, and Harry lowered his wand and while dropping to his knees; he was screaming again. Gradually the screaming turned to sobbing, and Harry was too overwhelmed to care that he was doing it in front of Malfoy.
Neville narrowed his eyes at his boyfriend before looking at Harry with compassion, “Harry, how are you handling this?”
He felt a hand on his back and knew he didn’t deserve the comfort. He stood up quickly and almost fell back down from the sudden lightheadedness. It wasn’t wise to apparate when he was feeling so emotional, but Harry didn’t care. In fact, he hoped he splinched himself; he deserved every bit of pain the world had to give him. He apparated to number 12 Grimmauld Place and ran up to his bedroom.
“Isn’t it lovely that the N.E.W.T.S. are over and Draco isn’t studying all the time? Too bad he’s using his previous studying time to snog Potter.” Draco pulled away from Harry to shoot a glare at Pansy. Harry laughed and distracted his boyfriend before he insulted the witch.
Hermione stopped reading to look up at Harry and smile. She was visibly thrilled to have the opportunity to get her N.E.W.T.S., and Harry braved a smile back. It must have been a better reaction than she was hoping for, because she let out a small shriek. “Oh, Harry! Isn’t it wonderful? We can come back for a year without the threat of...,” she trailed off and looked less excited. Obviously worried about how Harry would respond to her almost saying Voldermort’s name, Hermione looked at his face anxiously. Harry acted like he didn’t catch the slip-up and kept his face blank.
Harry didn’t need to think about it before saying, “I meant every word I said to her. Had the rivalry not existed, I might have been friends with Draco, Blaise, and Pansy much longer than a month.”
Draco rushed back to the common room after Snape’s discussion with his thoughts swirling around his head. Harry was taking up more time than he could afford to give, but Draco did not regret a second spent with Harry. His grades were still second best in most subjects, and he had actually out-performed Granger in Potions during their last class. It had taken quite a bit of restraint to not rub it in Granger’s face, but he had remained civil even when Weasley had loudly whispered to Granger about Draco probably cheating. Granger had thrown many concerned glances at Harry during the last month and a half because the Saviour had stopped sitting with his best friends in favour of sitting with Draco. Draco didn’t think Weasley had noticed his best mate’s absence for a few weeks, but when he did realize that Harry had apparently abandoned them for the Slytherins, his hostility had grown.
“Indeed. Well as I’m sure you know, typically Hogwarts requires three years of real-life experience before becoming a professor.” Snape paused and Harry nodded to show that he did know that. “Well, I am prepared to count your experiences during your schooling as that experience, as well as last year. That being said, Hartley is not coming back next year; I will not tolerate a professor who treats students as nasty as I did.” A look of regret passed over Snape’s face, but he continued. “So, Mr. Potter, I want to ask if you would consider being a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor; I believe it could be a good fit. However, I will require a few things.”
