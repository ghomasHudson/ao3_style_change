“What would you do at Hogwarts?” asked Draco, his eyes flicking across the board as he laid out his next moves.
“I’m fine,” she said, waving her hand weakly. “I always get this way in the winter.”
. “Wait, nevermind. It sank to the bottom of the sea aboard the ship Formosa.”
A sudden change in the music dragged Draco out of his thoughts and back to Aparecium, where Gemma was still chattering away and laughing at something she had just said. He absently massaged the back of his hand at the memory of the black quill and realised that his whiskey glass was once again empty. As the room around him came back into focus, his eyes darted around for another waitress to order a drink from. How many was that again?
Harry was overcome with the urge to bury himself under his covers and never show his face again. He stared resolutely through Snape, hyper aware of the warmth emanating from the man at his side.
McGonagall’s head was tilted forward, her hair falling out of its usually tight bun in messy waves.
Harry huffed a breath of laughter. “Good. I hate secrets.”
Instead of going back to sleep and risking another horrible dream early that morning, he’d curled up on his window seat and watched the dark sky outside. Somewhere in the castle, someone else must have also been awake because when he opened the little door where food appeared, there was a piping hot mug of cocoa waiting for him. And if he squinted hard enough out his window over the far field, he could see black shapes like large swooping bats floating and diving around a grassy pitch. He’d smiled wearily and wondered at how long he would still find all of this magic stuff completely novel.
“I’m sorry, Professor, but I have to object to the Occlumency. We don’t know enough about him to be training him to close off his mind. It may interfere with interrogation in the future.” Cedric looked agitated.
“No?” Dumbledore echoed, his white eyebrows raising all the way up and his spectacles slipping to the end of his crooked nose.
“I forgot that was how it ended,” said Harry, breathing heavily but finding a smile on his face. “It’s honestly one of my favourite memories.”
Ignoring Draco’s thinly veiled attempt at derailing his endgame strategy, Harry moved his knight forward and Draco let out a disparaging sigh. “Your funeral.”
“Is something wrong with it?” Harry asked, gazing at the strange instrument in his hand.
“Ollivander won’t recognise someone he’s never met,” said Malfoy. “Give it a rest, look.” He pointed his wand at Harry’s hair, which rustled but didn’t otherwise feel any different.
“Oh really? She’s probably just a fling for Harry. I wouldn’t think anything of it,” said Pansy, attempting to dismiss this line of conversation.
“It’s not about me anymore. Not on balance with everything the world stands to lose if we fail at this,” said Harry, staring pointedly into the faces of each of them. “I’ll take you as far as I can, but if something happens to me, you’ll at least have the Horcruxes. You can finish the mission.”
“Are you speaking from experience, Pansy? Only Angelica told me you and Blaise were looking cosy after I left that night.” Draco shifted his head slightly to look at his friend while remaining in a reclined position.
“And you believe Potter will show you that willingly,” said Snape, placing sachets of dried waratah petals in a small drawer.
“I’m not trying to trick you,” said Harry, sitting as still as possible so as not to agitate his restraints any further. “But I would at least expect you to be interested in any information I could share about Horcruxes for mutual gain. My Hermione would see the logic in that at any rate.”
The one piece that would have been useful would be to have seen long enough past the moment of the flash to know what had happened after the Dark Lord attempted the curse on Harry, a mere infant. The strange thing was, as far as he could tell, there were no protective spells on the child, or even in the room. Lily, for all her wisdom, had not even fired a single spell which might have injured him.
Though he was keen to keep focus on the task at hand, Harry couldn’t help being awestruck by this strange and wonderful shop. He ran his hand lightly across a few boxes which vibrated with different frequencies, as Hermione marched up to the till and rang a silver bell. The sound of creaky wheels could be heard as Ollivander rolled into view, standing halfway up a tall ladder propped up against the ceiling-high shelves.
He didn’t even know how much time had passed before Hermione came knocking tentatively on the door frame, asking where Harry was.
Hermione moved defensively in front of Harry, which was pointless because he was only slightly obscured by the bushy cloud of hair. “Well, Professor McGonagall said—”
Tonks pointed her wand at the padlock on the door and said “Pygmy Puff,” at which the lock vanished like a mirage. She put her hand on the door, but then turned back to Draco. “Put on a brave face when you meet the assets. They need to trust you to follow you.”
“Who doesn’t?” said Draco, with a look of misty eyed remembrance – something he was used to seeing on the faces of other pathetic souls when they reminisced about these times.
“Did you send an owl to Tonks to tell her where we’re going?” asked Harry, pulling on a jacket and zipping it up.
“I still
“Don’t be jealous.” Draco wound an arm around her waist and drew her close. “Quidditch isn’t the only thing that can keep me up after hours.”
Harry felt a rush of relief, and he smiled appreciatively at Draco.
“She said the same thing, actually. I saw her in the library with a gigantic pile of books on dark magic. She’s really worried about it, and about you, too. And she came round to remove the wards off your door – says it’s ‘a violation of your civil liberties,’” said Luna.
Harry jumped to his feet and scrambled through the trunk till his hands closed around the familiar shape carved in glossy marble. He pulled it out, noticing again the strange shield it held made of a black gem like onyx. He took it to the board, reset the black side of the board, and took a deep breath.
As Draco approached the Room of Requirement for the second time that day, he felt a sting of guilt. It was an annoyingly uncomfortable feeling, and he kicked himself for it. Why did it matter to him what happened to Potter?
“I thought you’d be happy to see him!” she continued, toying with the hem of her pleated pink skirt. “Besides, we need a fourth player to make it even.”
The rest of the group spent so much time in Harry’s room over the next few days that when they left to Transfigure it back from a hospital wing to a flat, it had expanded in size to include several more squashy armchairs by the fire and a full kitchen table in the corner by the elf shelf.
“Oh but I am.” Dumbledore’s pale blue eyes flashed in her direction. “I must insist we protect Harry’s location under a Fidelius Charm. And as I have already been duped by one Secret Keeper, I will bear the title myself.”
“Of all the people to wander across your path, you had to go and get saddled with Loony Lovegood,” said Draco, coming to sit by the fire as Ivy made herself cosy in the folds of his collar.
He had planned the day trip to Scotland with Angelica and her father for some carefully curated bonding time. They were to spend the bulk of the day engaged in one of Edgar DuPont’s favourite pastimes — golf.
“But how do we even know what’s possible in our world?” asked Hermione. “In every case, the vision showed us a world where Voldemort was already in power. Whereas here, he’s still in hiding.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw the great snake Nagini slithering towards the door. Draco reached for his wand but Harry put a hand out to stop him, the thought of Ivy swimming to his mind.
“Well, he wound up dead so we’ll never know.”
“Yes, I can see that,” said Draco, gesturing to Rodolphus’s signature. “However, it may be quite some time before my father experiences true death.” He could feel his voice catch slightly at the thought.
The group hesitated, looking at Hermione who was still gazing at the note, lost in thought. Harry hoped she wasn’t feeling the urge to turn on her heel and run straight to McGonagall.
“Strictly speaking from a numbers perspective it doesn’t sound like a viable way to amass a following,” said Hermione.
Harry laughed incredulously, but Draco could see the anger rising in his face. “It’s not about me, it’s dangerous for you! Meddling in Lucius’s affairs is dangerous, meddling in my affairs is dangerous, the whole thing is mad.”
“Now, now, this is a strange turn of events. The prodigal son returns only to partner with a usurper,” said Voldemort, continuing to chuckle heartlessly. “What do you think of that, Lucius, hm?” The silver-haired Death Eater did not move.
Harry didn’t even seem to register the rest of the contents. His eyes were glued to a letter written in a delicate, slanted hand.
It was a long shot, but there wasn’t much to lose at this point. Maybe it would unlock something for Harry. Maybe it would build some trust, as Granger suggested. Whatever happened, if he wanted to access the green flash, Draco’s hours were numbered.
He even allowed himself to feel a flicker of hope at the notion that Draco might return his feelings, but as they emerged from the memory, laughing awkwardly as a Queen record played in the background, he forced the thought away. Which was easy enough to do when Cedric arrived home from the run with an assortment of Muggle clothes of highly dubious fashionability.
“It’s all rubbish, Harry, don’t think twice about it. Wizards have no desire to really learn what Muggles are like,” said Hermione, waving her hand at the offending book and focusing her attention on Harry’s programming text.
“Mr Longbottom, a victim of sustained Cruciatus damage, was not only mobility-restricted but also cognitively impaired. While considered a witness in the disappearance of his wife earlier this summer, Longbottom could not provide testimony usable to the investigation. The Auror department acknowledges the possible linkage between the case and has declined to reveal any further information at this time. ‘Our sincerest condolences go out to the family,’ says Healer Marina. ‘And we at St Mungo’s will continue to cooperate with the investigation in any way possible.’”
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Harry, nodding at Pansy. And he was. “Look, I’m not sure I’m any good at speeches, but let me tell you what I know. It’s really easy to draw lines between what is friend and what is foe. But if you let those lines be drawn blindly, before you know it you’ll find yourself on the wrong side of one.”
“Enough,” said Umbridge, spinning on her heel, her expression hard. “Now you really are testing my patience. Where are you keeping it? I had to ruin a perfectly good junior Auror to find out you’ve been hiding it from me, now give it up!”
“You know as well as I do he intended to kill the Potters.”
Snape let out a long breath and rubbed his hands over his face. “It may surprise you to learn that not everything exists on your timetable.”
Harry brightened. That had to be Charlotte! If she was asking about him, then she had to believe he was still alive. And she would have known to tread carefully around someone suspicious like Cedric, maybe even guessed that his disappearance had something to do with his unexplained powers.
“I was being stupid,” she said, with a sincerity that he would not have believed if he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes. “Chalk it up to competing with you for the last six years or being too nosy for my own good or whatever, but you didn’t deserve it.”
“If you please, sir, we’re of age. And about to be junior Aurors,” lied Hermione with a dead serious face. “If you prefer to speak with our supervisor, I could send an owl to Auror Diggory, though we’d be taking him away from a live investigation.”
Hermione stepped forward to start organising the group and sharing their plans for the attack on Wisteria Hall. Harry, grateful that the eyes were off of him, stepped to the back.
“You’d think the wizarding world would have invented a spell with search functionality,” said Harry. “Maybe there is no cure for it. It’s been a lot more under control lately, maybe it’s just something I have to live with.”
“Provisions, cash, everything,” she said, holding up a duffle bag. “Who’s Luna, by the way?”
Kreacher told them an unbelievable tale of Regulus Black and his secret mission to find the locket and defeat the Dark Lord. He told them how he had been loaned to the Dark Lord for the purposes of setting the real locket in the Inferi cave, and how he was left there to die. He told them too of his journey to the cave with his master, and how he was forced to watch Regulus drink the elixir as Neville had been. And, just as Dumbledore had done, Regulus had also perished from his encounter with the cave.
After his father’s visit to the castle, he had written her to see if she was in any danger from his idiotic tip. But she had merely responded that she was doing well and had only wished she could have come to the match herself. “Your father couldn’t take his eyes off you,” the note had said. But Draco had read it for the warning that it was:
“Breaking Potter won’t help you in your current position,” said Snape, resuming his teacherly tone. “You and I are both in the grips of a rather robust Fidelius Charm. Even if you knew all of Potter’s secrets today, there’s nothing you’d be able to do with them. Besides, our Lord is still weak. He needs more time to regain his true form.”
That was it – the spare king!
“And unicorn hair,” interjected Hermione, “Is what you had told me. Remember, Dudley?”
“Is something the matter?” he asked, holding the facade together as best he could.
“He is brave to the point of idiocy,” said Draco.
The letter in question was an attempt at writing to his mother about Potter. He knew, of course, that the Fidelius Charm would keep him from revealing Potter’s existence as well as his whereabouts, but Draco knew that even a good spell has its loopholes.
“Yeah, wouldn’t think so,” laughed Draco, immediately regretting the lapse in judgement that made him lose his composure in front of Blaise. He wasn’t even sure why Granger came to mind. It wasn’t like they were friends or anything. Too much exposure to the would-be boy legend and his gang of student teachers, no doubt, but he wouldn’t have to be worrying about that anymore.
“I do, and it’s terrible,” said Draco, eyeing Harry’s knight as he reached for it.
“Well done, Angel!” said DuPont in passing, a crisp Scottish breeze whipping around his clear nest of flyaway hairs. “Alright boys, best to keep a low ball with this level of wind. Watch and learn.” Mr Dupont made contact with a comparably loud crack, sending the ball sailing. Draco could have sworn the ball course-corrected in midair, as DuPont jerked his head to urge it towards the centre of the fairway, but he turned around beaming just the same.
“The match was abysmal,” snapped Lucius. “Your broom alone could outstrip that Hufflepuff Seeker and save us all the trouble of standing in the rain.”
“You will not distract me that easily,” he replied through his teeth, eyes glued to the door.
“Why not?” asked Luna.
to give Harry later for Quidditch scores. “As I say, there’s quite a lot on my mind these days.”
and remove any chance of that happening, but he hesitated. He had long ignored an itch to learn more about his dark master, and here was Dumbledore saying that he had once been no more than a boy himself. As well as corroborating Snape’s recollection of the prophecy.
Using Labyrinthos for Tarot references
He looked at Harry, dark hair falling into his eyes, who was so terribly hopeful it left an ache inside his chest.
“Daddy,” she said in mock exasperation.
“It’s hard for people in my parents’ generation to forget there was a war going on when we were born,” he said finally, his grey eyes finding Harry’s. “One that claimed many lives and changed the wizarding world forever. My parents wanted to make sure that all-out war never happened again; that the correct leaders were in positions of power and the public were governed by a just set of rules. But if that failed… They also wanted me to be ready.”
“Listen, can we talk alone for a minute?” Draco asked. He was practically pleading.
“Why are you saying this?” asked Harry, his throat tightening.
By the time Draco made it up the stairs, he felt like he had been through one of the longest days of his life. And yet, he could not fall asleep in the master bedroom. Thoughts of Horcruxes and RAB and lightning bolt shaped scars danced around in his head until he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Do you want to go have a chat down by the lake after this?” asked Pansy.
“Well, the curse is discernible enough, as I say,” said Borgin, frowning down at the ring. “But the stone has some property I don’t recognise, and the ring itself is imbued with latent magic, possibly blood magic.”
But as Harry turned the corner and spotted the man in the tweed suit gazing thoughtfully at a chessboard and stroking a white beard, Draco’s stomach dropped. Sitting in broad daylight in a Muggle suit and smiling warmly at Harry through half-moon spectacles was Albus Dumbledore.
“Well, of course you are,” said Luna, balling up a piece of parchment to try for herself. “Up here in this room all alone. If you can’t enjoy learning magic, what’s the point?”
“I guess so,” said Harry. “It just seems like a waste of time. And I can’t even practice without a wand, which means I’m not getting any closer to the sort of spells I really need. I’m starting to wonder whether there’s really any danger and if I even have a chance against it if there is.”
, but he carried a letter in Luna’s distinctive blue ink that an owl had delivered by spotting him on the street.
“Neville gave us the wrong locket. I doubt he knows what he’s talking about,” scoffed Draco. “Not to mention you’ll have to get pretty close to Voldemort to try and destroy him with venom. And there’s no doubt he’ll fight back.”
As a child, Draco had been shocked his father didn’t turn the repulsive man away point blank, but the man held a secret; a twisted, strange second face on the back of his head. Whatever the face had said, it more than convinced his father, and the stranger had been invited to stay. From that moment, Quirrell only grew weaker, while Lord Voldemort grew stronger.
“Alright students, I think that settles it,” said Lockhart from the front of the class as he withdrew a long curl of parchment from a desk drawer. “This calls for a letter to my editor. I think it’s high time we print the next edition.”
He recalled the memory of a banged up red bicycle that he’d inherited the summer Dudley got a mountain bike for his birthday. There was a bent spoke that made a twanging noise each time the back wheel turned, and the handlebar grips had been pulled off by Dudley out of spite. But Harry loved this bike just the same.
“But Albus, what of the danger? The prophecy,” said Minerva earnestly. “They will come for him.”
“Maybe in this version of reality,” said Harry with a shrug.
He turned back to Cedric to side-along with him to Oxfordshire, and right before he got yanked away, he heard Pansy say to the others, “He could definitely do worse.”
“Very well, sir,” said Draco. “All the allied families have maintained cover at Hogwarts. I don’t think anyone at the school expects our involvement—”
“What the hell are you teaching him, Granger?” demanded Cedric, as he knelt next to the other two, grabbing Draco by the shoulder to steady him.
“And pray to Merlin it’s in one of those places,” muttered Cedric.
“Isn’t it obvious?” said Voldemort, with a sigh of exasperation. “I will have to destroy you. The choice is simple.”
The rest of the group fell silent at this. “What?” he asked, looking around at them.
Harry considered this for a moment. He’d been friends with Charlotte for a while now, and she’d seen him do some weird stuff, but he’d never told anyone what he was considering telling her. He glanced up at Charlotte, her eyes meeting his quizzically. The presence of Malfoy seemed equally puzzled.
“For another, if there’s at least one example of another misdiagnosed case, that makes me more optimistic that someone has studied this strain of affliction. I found a footnote about one that was cured, but I just heard from Flourish and Blotts and they’ve never heard of the book that describes it.”
As he resigned himself to make his last stand, he heard a blood-curdling scream. Charlotte.
Hot tears rolled down the side of his face. He wiped them away furiously with his sleeve. He hadn’t cried like this in years, not when they dragged Alice Longbottom away, not even when he was at his mother’s bedside a few days ago. But now, coming clean, it all came rushing back to him, like he’d forgotten how out of touch with his own humanity he’d become.
“No, no, I’m sure Lucius doesn’t need to hear,” said the old man, wringing his hands nervously. “Is there anything I can offer you? 15% off anything in the shop as a gesture of good faith?”
“What do you know?” she asked, leaning towards him, her voice dropping.
“I agree,” Draco said, but the other two had turned to each other as though he had disappeared.
“My father is a smart man. He inherited the company from his father, and he did exceptionally well with it. He placed bets in the right places. He took calculated risks, and they’ve paid off. But he lacks vision.” Angelica’s expression sobered. “And like you, and so many men, he was quick to doubt me. He doubted I could lead DuPont Industries. Despite my education and my inclination to take over the family business, he was reluctant to put me in a position of power. So I had to find other ways to influence him.”
“We must discern that separately, but it doesn’t change the circumstances for Harry,” snapped Dumbledore, betraying a hint of emotion behind his words. “If Voldemort’s followers know he’s alive and set out to kill him, there’s nowhere he’ll be safe. What wizarding family would stand a chance of protecting him where Lily and James failed?”
“You told me my parents died in a car crash,” said Harry, feeling a hot tear roll down his face.
The house-elf’s weathered cheeks pulled up in a smile as he left the rest of the biscuits on the table and turned to Draco for praise. Draco nodded appreciatively and Kreacher beamed with pride, toddling off to the kitchen to inevitably begin on another snack.
Hermione beamed, reaching for another biscuit and settling into her chair, changing topics to ramble on about all the artefact research she’d accomplished over the break and how little she could find on Horcruxes in the accessible dark magic texts. When that ran out, they were soon on the topic of the growing fear in the broader wizarding community and Hermione’s strong opinions on the current political climate.
He buried his face in his hands and let out a long sigh.
Draco could feel the panic rising in young Harry, and was surprised to find that he seemed genuinely concerned for the other boy’s welfare. Wasn’t this the same kid who had thrown rocks at him? Draco would have let the boy go to teach him a lesson. If you can’t keep your head above water, you shouldn’t be swimming.
The next morning, the
“No,” she said, almost to herself.
“Whatever you say,” said Harry, thoroughly unconvinced. “Can’t imagine it’s that easy to find something a powerful wizard wants to conceal.”
“Let’s see,” said Draco, coming to lean over Harry and look into the cup. Harry twirled the cup nervously, and Draco put a hand on it to steady him. “Hm, could be a bird. Signalling a fortunate journey.”
Draco leaned back instinctively. Surely the boy-legend himself couldn’t have been raised in a cupboard.
“I hope you have good news for me, Miss Granger,” said McGonagall. “I only have a few minutes before I need to be en route to the Ministry. The Wizengamot is holding a preliminary assembly on the replacement of Albus’s seat on the council, and I’ll be damned if I let it go to one of Fudge’s hand-selected candidates.”
As she smiled up at him, he felt the flutter of something warm and comforting in his chest. This Tonks was like a sister to him, a best friend, and right now the only person in the world that cared about him like family. He struggled to think of some meaningful parting words to say, knowing he might not get another chance before the vision was up.
“Enough of this,” said the voice of Carrow through the fog. “The Dementors will find him easy enough.”
Hermione’s face darkened. “She died, unfortunately, caught in the crossfire of a duel,” she said. “But it got me thinking that Dumbledore seeing this trait in you is probably more the reason he wanted to protect you.”
“What’s she talking about, Malfoy?” asked Cedric, looking back and forth between the two like a tennis match, his hand ready to grab his wand at a moment’s notice.
“Hey, yeah, she was wearing something gold when we saw her. Though I hardly stopped to look,” said Harry, perking up and glancing back to Draco.
“I’d destroy it…” said McGonagall between shaky breaths. “Before giving it to the likes of you.”
And that was just fine. Muggles kept to their lot, and her kind kept to their own. Which was exactly why she was on this particular street on this particular day. She was waiting for a member of her kind who would know exactly what to do after the horrible events that had taken place in Godric’s Hollow.
Draco put a comforting arm around the small Ravenclaw and she smiled.
“I just have a feeling about this one,” said Harry, pointedly. “His soul is in them, but he’s not connected to them. Otherwise, why not move them somewhere safer. As soon as the ring went missing, he could have come for the diadem.”
Dumbledore shifted Harry in his arms, withdrawing his wand with his free hand and pointing it delicately at the baby, casting a nonverbal calming charm. Harry’s gaze fixed on the end of the wand, and his eyelids drooped sleepily. Before long, he was out again, clutching the corner of the letter in a small fist.
. He could almost hear Malfoy’s voice saying, “Is it normal for Muggles to live in wardrobes?” and chuckled to himself.
“Well, I guess you’ll need a bit of all three in this line of work, eh?” said Fred, slapping Draco on the back as he passed by.
“He’s dying from the burnout of the regenerative spells. He needs me to survive, he’s going to try and take my form somehow.”
“I was just trying to get out of there, he put his face under my shoe,” said Harry, which sent Charlotte into further peals of laughter.
“Yeah, I realised,” said Harry, who was standing by the couches with books strewn about, all opened to different spells. “I hadn’t looked up the counter-spell, and then the smoke got too thick to read anything.”
“You have no idea,” said Hermione with an eye roll.
“You’re talking about… my father,” said Draco, furrowing his brow.
After the locket incident, Kreacher was a changed elf. The team woke up to a mountain of breakfast the following morning and he became a constant presence around the group, usually just around the corner with a piping hot mug of cocoa or coming to tidy something in the room they were working in just to be nearby. He wore the fake locket with the chain looped double around his neck, next to Narcissa Malfoy’s brooch pinned to his tunic like a badge of honour.
“I’m trying to help you here!” said Hermione, jumping to her feet. “Do you want to learn magic or not?”
“Yes, of course,” said Hermione, sounding confident, though Harry could see her fingers fidgeting nervously. “The thing is, we’re in an advanced class for dark magic identification and prevention. Dudley and I are training to be Aurors.”
“As to whether the danger is real,” said Draco, his eyes darting away. He shrugged. “Who can really say? But if McGonagall and Dumbledore said there was something to fear, it’s better to play it safe. It makes sense for you to ride out the next few weeks here at least. Did she say when you’ll be ready?”
They didn’t owe him anything, and yet they were still coming back day after day to help him. That had to mean more than a stupid book on breaking spells, didn’t it?
The memory of the afternoon’s meeting came back in an icy rush, like a winter wind under the collar. Should he tell Potter the new information he discovered or tell him to mind his own business?
“Of course she did,” muttered Draco. “Goes to show, you can’t learn everything from books. Even if you can Occlude, a skilled Legilimens can force a recollection with sheer strength, though it can be very painful and sometimes damaging to the subject. From my experience, having strong recollection control can help you divert an onlooker as well, to distract them from finding the memories you’re most keen to protect.”
“Yes, thank you Garrick, it continues to work just fine,” said McGonagall, taking the wand back with a bit of force and returning it to a robe pocket. “Ah, here is the student I was telling you about.”
“What was that all about?” asked Malfoy after the door had closed behind her.
“We need to create a profile about what we actually know,” said Harry. “Where he was seen, what he did during the war, who his other victims were.”
Hermione held the book out to him, titled
Pansy fixed him with a sisterly look of reproach. “If you say so,” she said, “If I didn’t know better, I’d say this has something to do with Potter. Or is he really just settling the score over a golf bet?”
“But Professor—” started Draco. Was she really going to stay here alone with this untamed wizard on some kind of rampage of uncontrolled magic?
Hermione turned her head with a jerk and scowled. “You’re not supposed to talk about him, there are rules.”
“We’re better off believing it is and preparing for the worst,” said Luna. “Harry’s visions have to mean something.”
Harry thought for a minute, scrutinising one of the many motorcycle posters that dotted the wall rather than look at Draco. “On the run for my life with someone who’s never seen a decent film in his life? Yeah maybe not.”
Harry screwed his eyes shut and tried to picture Draco in this timeline. A sneering, pointed face came into view, leering over him on a train, taunting him in front of a giant winged horse with the head of a bird, pretending to be a Dementor to scare him.
“You’re not half as bad as you make yourself out to be,” said Harry, returning the smile and relaxing back on the couch, like a mouse that didn’t know it was in the lion’s den.
“I agree,” said Cedric. “It’s a security risk.”
Draco drummed his fingers on his knee in thought. He’d never been particularly close to the Headmaster personally, but it couldn’t be denied that he was one of the greats.
Shrub’s ears drooped and she nodded, Apparating away with a crack.
once more.
“Someone who knows you’re of more use to us working on the cause than on homework,” said Hermione, betraying a hint of a smile and sounding very much like Charlotte – Quickly dragging Harry out of the friendly environment and reminding him of the serious nature of the task at hand.
“What an absolute tosser,” said Hermione bristling, but Harry could see the wheels of her mind turning. “Did you manage to see anything?”
“Of course, Professor,” said Draco. He wasn’t entirely sure of Snape’s true meaning, but given the way this news affected him he knew he’d figure it out at some point or other.
“The small Lockharts,” said Luna.
!” he shouted, and the tip of his wand ignited with a bang, sending a stream of sparks careening down the length of the room and bursting upon impact, sending chunks of rock hurtling up in the air.
“Alright. It’s your time to kill,” said Cedric, turning his attention back to Harry. Draco summoned a stool and took a seat next to Hermione, who still looked very put out about the unexpected shift in the schedule.
He looked back down on the street, but he couldn’t see anything in the cloud of debris that appeared there. His heart beating in his ears, he could feel his throat tighten as a cousin he hardly knew he had was ripped away from him.
“I will let you go… this time. But there is only one way to prove your loyalty to me.”
“There’s loads! Everyone loves Quidditch of course, but there’s also clubs for Gobstones and exploding snap. And a few weekends a year we’re allowed to go down to Hogsmeade where there’s all sorts of bookstores and cafes. Sometimes I just like wandering around the grounds and sketching plants in the greenhouses or talking with the school ghosts.”
A bolt of terror ripped through Draco and he pushed the door open, spotting a black robed figure hunched over the desk. He sprinted across the room, cursing himself. He should have told McGonagall this was a problem, why had he trusted Snape to kick the habit so few were ever really able to escape from?
He considered offering a few consoling words, but Harry didn’t respond well to overly emotional displays. No, what he needed was a plan of action, a way to unpack all this information and make use of it.
Harry felt a shiver down his spine. He was acutely aware of the folded picture of his parents in his pocket.
Each day Draco saw Voldemort for more of what he was; a megalomaniac with the power to destroy the world for his own selfish ends. And yet he was forced to smile and play along when the Dark Lord requested his presence to assess intel or be tested to show his power or loyalty.
“Alright, fine,” said Hermione, “I’ll be back tomorrow to work on your switching spells, and how are you doing on that chapter on matter transfer theory?”
They were so caught up in a memory of his final encounter with the Potions Master, that Draco missed a supply run he was supposed to go on with Cedric. And Harry was shocked to discover that the Professor he had met briefly had been so close to his mother, but he was even more surprised to hear Draco vow to protect Harry himself.
“What if he’s been apprehended?” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together nervously.
Before he knew it, he could feel the sense of something pressing in on his thoughts. Unlike the well-travelled passageway into his thoughts that Malfoy had taken, this was a cold sensation, like water down the back of his neck. Could it be this person was trying to enter his mind as he was doing now?
Hermione’s hand had shot back up in the air again. “I was wondering, Professor. How are we to teach Harry when he hasn’t got a wand?”
“Sorry I’m late, I just saw—” said Hermione, stopping when her eyes locked on Draco. “Oh, you’re here.”
“Oh!” said Gemma, springing up and clomping precariously away.
He clamped his hand down on Snapes shoulder, yanking him from the surface of the Pensieve, which he emerged from with a gasp of air.
“And is it just the one object, or are there multiple—”
Greenacre chuckled at this. “Yes, it is, but we at Greenacre Capital deal with both magical and non-magical alike. Private equity is a type of investment where the capital is not publicly traded. Meaning the investment is either with a private company, or in buying out a public company and taking it private. Then the business can be rebuilt or acquired and delisted. Do you follow?”
Voldemort darted from thought to thought, bursting in on each as though he were knocking in doors. Draco could feel the collar of his robes growing damp with the strain as he tried to dodge and feint to thoughts without Occluding. The Dark Lord saw Quidditch practice, classes, a kiss shared with Pansy. He lingered on a tense moment Draco had not bothered to hide, of Snape breaking down at the Pensieve. Most likely wondering whether his servant would be fit for duty after prolonged memory exposure.
He glared down at the Mark on his forearm and cursed himself for being a spineless idiot for so long. For never taking the million opportunities he had to pull his head out of his arse and question his own selfish motivations. Maybe if he had, Potter would be in his arms right now instead of running for his life.
“Come here so I can see you,” said Laverne. “I get so awfully lonely here at night.”
“I said a simple memory, Potter.”
Draco nodded. “Right, well, that might be the problem. Try focusing on a discrete memory rather than just a feeling. Show me a memory where you remember the day exactly.”
So they were somewhere that Harry felt safe as a child. But where? Certainly this dusty cupboard was nowhere his guardians would want him to be. Draco had once hidden out in a wardrobe as a child and fallen asleep in his own imaginary world, only to be wrenched from the cosy space by a hysterical Narcissa who thought he’d gone missing. Vanishing cabinets were not uncommon in the Manor.
“Did I ever tell you how my mother died?” asked Luna, as lightly as if she were asking about the weather.
Draco pulled sharply on the wire and the other end popped loose as well, sending a shower of sparks to the floor which he stamped out.
Snape began to fade, cloak shimmering around his frail form, the puncture wounds on his neck subtly gleaming.
“I don’t know,” said Harry, his eyebrows knitting together. Draco didn’t have to use Legilimency to know that Harry must be thinking of the conversation they’d had earlier in Sirius’s very room.
Harry navigated them both out of the memory, no longer requiring the small room as a pit stop. And by the time the two of them were back in the castle, he was beaming.
Luna was fixating the object in question, delicately prodding it with a spell or a cleaning charm every few minutes. Harry couldn’t tell whether the uncharacteristic silence meant Luna was thinking very hard, or else caught in a daydream.
“Idiot boy,” said Snape. “I should have known you wouldn’t last long in life, despite the trouble I went through—”
Draco glanced at the desk, where a familiar phial with an etching of a doe sat unstoppered and empty. He looked back at Snape.
“What is it?” asked Harry, letting go of where he’d been holding Draco’s side.
The regeneration draught called for a very specific ingredient; the blood of the enemy. This woman had defied the Dark Lord on multiple occasions and her work had led to the capture of instrumental members of the brethren.
“Oh, well in that case, let me drop off a few of these then,” said Hermione, pulling out
“You’re back,” said Petunia, in not much more than a whisper. Harry couldn’t tell if it was a question or a statement.
“Can you hear me, Snape?” said Draco, a little more harshly. “My mother is in danger over this. It can’t go on any longer.”
“We simply tell the Minister if he doesn’t comply, we’ll see to it he’s replaced,” said the austere voice of the blond man. “Fudge is too stupid not to—”
“So he should,” said Draco, taking his Prefect tone. “And you ought not to be lingering in the halls between classes.”
“The sister is bound by a blood oath. She will take him. She must.”
Besides which he had a Quidditch team to run, Head Boy duties to take care of, and a fake girlfriend to keep entertained. And, most importantly, when would he find time to figure out how to break this damn Fidelius? So far he hadn’t broken through anything meaningful to Pansy or to his mother, but he was confident there were weaknesses in the charm worth exploiting.
Draco turned the map over in his hands sceptically. “Sir, it seems to me that this might be a trick map. You
“Good evening, Potter,” said McGonagall with a false cheerfulness Draco had only seen her use with nervous first years. “I wanted to introduce you to Draco Malfoy.”
As the Order descended on the Death Eaters, many began to Apparate away. Some of the newcomers began tending to the wounds of students, while others continued to battle. Cedric and Tonks met to converse briefly on the side of the room as he pointed to the crowd and they split back up to begin apprehending the remaining supporters.
Pansy burst into laughter.
Draco held up a hand, and the man fell silent immediately. At least his pull outside of Hogwarts was still as strong as ever.
He knew exactly what this was – temporal dissociation, a common symptom of progressed Pensieve abuse. He’d seen it before, Death Eaters who had suffered the Cruciatus Curse enough times that their nerves were damaged tended to relapse into a heavy combination of re-lived memory and neutralising potion. It tended to not go well from there.
and handing it to him. He sat up in his chair, unfolding the paper to a garishly large headline reading From Auror to Horror: The Rise and Fall of the Ministry’s Golden Boy next to a photo of a particularly bedraggled looking Potter stumbling down a London street with a familiar-looking party crowd.
But no matter, for one day he could suck it up and play golf if that’s what it took to please this family. Besides, it wasn’t as though he looked like he didn’t fit in with these people. He did, however, feel ridiculous in the muggle outfit that Angelica had picked out for him, which included a cable-knit sweater vest.
Draco had literally no idea what Tonks could be talking about or whether she was even sane. The uncivilised way she was shovelling down the last of her toast was making it seem unlikely. Still, the diadem must have sent him to this timeline for a reason.
“Ooh, I can’t wait to see it,” squealed Angelica, coming to sit on the ottoman near Draco and handing him a firewhiskey, leaving her hand to linger on his knee.
Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance though he looked green. He opened his mouth to respond, but Hermione turned to Harry like a barrister making her closing argument and said, “The one spell that Al gave his life to protect. The one thing keeping Voldemort from finding you.”
“Sorry, yes! Yes.” Harry said, but was too distracted to move.
The little green head lifted off his arm and bobbed in his direction.
“What the hell, Diggory?” demanded Draco, pushing up the sleeve of his robe to reveal a dark red mark like a welt.
But what was strange about the memory was that unlike any of the others they had seen, Dumbledore was not present. Stranger still, when young Riddle stayed after the meal to ask Slughorn about something called a Horcrux, the room filled with a dense white fog like a
Draco was still trying to collect his thoughts when there was a rustling from the couches and a very sleepy looking Potter sat up with the diadem in one hand.
“That’s alright then,” said Luna, pulling the door open. “Everyone’s at dinner. And besides, I know a secret way out of the castle. Oh, and grab some of the spare roast.”
Draco froze. How much had Harry sensed of his apprehension about the Dark Lord’s presence in the Manor?
Harry’s heart stopped beating in his chest as Voldemort reached out with a pale, grey hand and caressed her cheek, tucking long fingers under her chin to tilt Charlotte’s face up towards him.
“There better have been more to it or that would have been pretty weak insight from an ancient relic meant to imbue knowledge,” said Hermione, handing him a cup of tea.
He froze, his smile fading as he remembered why he was befriending Potter in the first place.
“No, but I’ve done just as bad. I could show you worse.”
From her spot on the floor, Charlotte’s shoulders were shaking with silent laughter. Her head lolled up towards him and she shook it, laughing all the while. Harry could feel Voldemort grow tense with anger.
Draco shot a glance over Pansy’s shoulder at the onlookers, and all three heads whipped back around as they started whispering furiously. All the better for him. He was determined to make sure everyone in the school knew how madly in love he was with a girl.
Hermione wheeled around to face him, colour blossoming in her cheeks as she bit her lip in concern. “I can explain,” she said.
Of all the insanity of the last few weeks, at least there were a few victories worth celebrating — the Manor would remain his home. Mother would be provided for. Even father might yet get his shot at redemption. Only time would tell whether the outcome was worth the price.
“A friend who helped me get back here. Why?” said Harry.
“Quickly, Ganger,” said Draco evenly.
“Excuse me?” Harry said. “Do I look like I know what’s going on?”
But Harry, unaware, just smiled. Something about Potter’s stupid grin, and the eager way he leaned forward out of his chair made him particularly hard to say no to.
“Only I wish to understand what I can do to prove
“What, not as pretty as you’d imagined?” said Draco, leering over her, backing her against the stone wall. “Well, let me tell you, it wasn’t licked on by pixies either.”
“What’s Granger got you working on now?” asked Draco, glimpsing some advanced charms work in a book open on the desk.
“Look, I don’t care who goes or who stays, but I’m getting tired of standing around here,” said Harry, grabbing his glasses off the desk and jamming them on his face. He squinted and pulled them away again.
over the entire memory of their conversation. He could feel his throat closing up but stifled any tears as his mother’s eyes fluttered open and she said, “Darling!”
As they crunched across the frosty grass out towards the forest, Harry took one look back at the grand castle. He’d miss the friends he’d made here, but it didn’t do to dwell, as Luna would say. The image of Malfoy’s trademark smirk swam to mind but he pushed it away. Who knew, maybe their paths would cross again in the future.
At last he came to a memory they both already knew. A ceremony. Draco of the memory was brimming with pride as he was ushered into the drawing room at Wisteria Hall, along with a dozen other children of Death Eater parents. It was almost his 17th birthday, he would be of age soon, and there was nothing more he wanted in the world than to prove his worth to the brethren.
“Sorry darling, Potter was in an absolute state. You didn’t have to wait up for me,” he said in a soothing tone.
“Trying to. But somehow I think I’m losing,” said Harry, resting his chin on his hand.
“I’m doing a bit of research on your bursts of magic,” she explained. “There are some consistencies with accidental magic, which occurs sporadically in magical children when they become stressed or angry.”
Harry could hear his heart beating loudly in his ears and he glanced nervously at Hermione to see if she could hear it as well.
“Like Thestrals,” said Luna, nodding.
she repeated, hoping she’d misunderstood the word.
Luna was rattling through the long list of artefacts she’d been amassing as Hermione poured out three cups of tea when she said, “Wait, say the last one again?”
“I hate when Angelica’s predictions are right,” he said, leaning back into the embrace, as Harry laughed.
“Better than last time, at any rate,” agreed Harry. “Do you think we’re ready to move on, then?”
“Oh nothing,” said Hermione, “Just something I heard about Parkinson the other day.”
But almost as if the shadow figure had heard Harry’s own thoughts, he turned to gaze into the mirror and Harry saw the same crimson eyes. But the face, which had been whole, was deteriorated, sagging and torn off in strips like a cadaver out of an anatomical textbook. Harry raised a hand to the peeling skin of the cheek, and the face smiled.
The trio were in stitches as they paged through the rest of the book, pointing out incorrect assumptions or hearing Luna’s thoughts around the true purpose for a laundromat. They were just on a hilarious section illustrating current Muggle fashion trends when Cedric and Draco walked in.
“Is Malfoy alright?” Harry found himself asking before he knew the words were coming out of his mouth. “It was just an accident. We were duelling and—”
“Sparks?” Harry asked, looking between Cedric and Hermione incredulously.
Harry reached across the table to wrap his hand around the offending wrist, drawing a thumb over the edge of the Mark. He knew Draco hated the thing, but Harry didn’t think it was something to be ashamed of. It was a sign of what he had overcome.
“Thestrals, my boy! Thestrals,” said the bard, dropping his lute dejectedly. “Creatures that feed on the blood of the innocent. A face like a skull, vicious fangs like tusks to rip and tear—”
He didn’t even stop to consider that Harry’s assumption could be right. After all, it wasn’t as though being “saved by love” was real. That was just a fairytale that mothers told their children to keep them feeling safe. Wasn’t it?
“What I couldn’t get out of my mind was that scrap of a letter you were trying to write your mother at the start of term. Something about a boy. And a secret. Something the Dark Lord would want known.”
“But you didn’t kill.”
Draco locked eyes with his friend. He wouldn’t be able to tell her anything about the secret, he’d tried before. But she had definitely noticed something; there was a chance that she’d picked up on the breadcrumb trail he had been leaving her ever since the very run in with Ganger in the corridor. Maybe she’d started filling in the gaps on her own.
Harry loved flying; the feeling that at any moment, he could take off and never look back. It was as liberating as the dream of Edinburgh had been to him the last few years with the Dursleys. Plus, it didn’t hurt that his flying instructor looked unreasonably good on a broom.
Snape lunged at the basin, and his face had nearly touched the surface of the memory when Draco hit him with a Full Body-Bind and he fell like a rock.
“That’s it,” said Harry, his eyes lighting up suddenly as he jumped to his feet, hobbling a bit on his injured leg.
“Is this your snake?” asked the girl, holding up two cupped hands with Ivy coiled in the middle.
“Dudley,” he blurted out. “Dudley, er, Dursley. Sir.” He ended with a graceless smile.
Taking a deep breath to steel himself to face the old wandmaker again as the group turned into the classroom, Harry was surprised to see that the great trunk of wands from his last visit was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a beaming Ollivander stood at McGonagall’s desk with a small, flat chest like a Muggle briefcase.
“McGonagall would sack you if she knew you were living in the Pensieve,” said Draco. “You might not make it out next time. What could be worth it?”
Draco followed her gaze to the wall behind Lockhart, which was plastered with framed newspaper clippings, signed photos, and book covers, all bearing Lockharts beaming face. Some waved frantically at the students, some grinned ear to ear in a way that looked almost painful. One was looking away until Draco realised it was just waiting for the right moment to throw a dashing glance over its shoulder.
he asked the snake.
He flipped through a few options in his mind, each one growing hazier. He let out a huff of laughter. “It seems I can’t bring myself to tell you.”
He almost laughed to see the ridiculous number of locks on the door that had clearly been added since his departure, but he simply cast a quiet
“Just because there isn’t a battle doesn’t mean lives won’t be lost,” said Harry, “A cold war is still a war.”
“So modest all of a sudden.” Tonks rolled her eyes “If I didn’t keep an eye on him, they’d already have him down at HQ with the rest of them, planning the next wave of the resistance. But he knows the front lines are where we can make the biggest difference today.”
“Oh, it’s exceedingly dangerous,” said Luna, swinging her arms as she walked. “There are all sorts of deadly creatures in here; Hinkypunks, Hippogriffs, even centaurs will kill a wizard who wanders into their domain.”
A crystal clear memory of a confrontation in a bathroom floated poignantly to mind; Draco pointed his wand directly at Harry with pure malice in his eyes, began to utter a curse, and Harry slashed the air with a jinx, sending ribbons of blood spurting from his face and chest. And then, a moment that made Harry turn ice cold: Malfoy in the astronomy tower. Pointing his wand at an unarmed Dumbledore.
“None of your business!” said Harry, standing up suddenly and pacing to the other side of the room.
“Enter,” said McGonagall in a clear voice, and the door burst open to reveal a round, pink woman who looked very much like a toad.
“With all the strange energy in the castle these days, I just knew that I was missing something. And wouldn’t you know it, I was walking up and down this hallway here, wondering what was wrong with the castle, when this door appeared!” she waited till Ivy had fully slithered off her hand before offering it out to Harry for a shake. “I’m Luna Lovegood.”
“Thanks,” said Draco, disconcerted to find that his voice was as shaky as he felt.
“And this,” said Luna, turning to Harry with enormous eyes magnified by her strange glasses. She placed a copy of a magazine titled the
Harry turned back to Voldemort, who stood alone, watching the battle between Dumbledore’s Army and his Death Eaters unfold in front of him. Only the snake, which coiled around its master’s legs, was by his side, as all others were occupied with the fight. Harry squared up to him, tuning out the noise of the battle behind him as the buzzing in his ears began.
“My lord, he is away.”
“What did Charlotte think?” asked Draco, finally advancing a knight. “She seemed to be the brains of the operation.”
The plan to skirt the Fidelius had been simple in the end; it was all a matter of order of operations. First he’d done all the research to figure out the best Muggle route of departure from Harry’s town, and then planted the seed of interception with his mother. Only then had he floated the plan to Potter, getting him to agree to use the station as his point of departure; unwittingly walking straight into a trap.
. “I pulled this out of the library for you. I figured maybe it’d give you a leg up on your lessons if you know what to expect.”
He had to laugh to see it. Thestrals. They were sneaking Muggles out of London on a herd of Thestrals.
Harry could feel Draco move next to him under the cloak, withdrawing his wand to have it at the ready. Harry’s mouth went dry. He’d been lucky to make it out alive against two Death Eaters, but against five Ministry wizards, he and Draco wouldn’t stand a chance if they were found out.
“Yeah, but we’re not talking about a single split,” said Cedric. “Seven pieces, the note said.”
“Definitely,” said Harry, seeing his opportunity. “In fact, I’d be keen to hold on to the wand this weekend to practise. That is, I think I’ve got my magic under a decent amount of control at this point.”
“Little good it will do the boy,” said Snape, evading the question. “With no other magical ability, Occlumency will not be much more than cloud coverage.”
He was about to leave it at that, but he made the mistake of glancing at Luna who responded with an emphatic eyebrow raise.
“Luna’s right. We can’t fall apart now, not when we’re so close,” he said, keeping his voice as level as possible. “But I think we better call it for tonight before things get out of hand.”
“Try to suppress your enthusiasm,” said Draco with an exasperated half smile. And as soon as their eyes locked, he was in Harry’s mind.
journalists waiting at the 18th hole to cover your win? ‘Putting Potter Mystifies Malfoy’?”
Whenever he thought of squashing old arguments, Potter’s annoying face came swimming into view. He’d replayed their conversation at the statue over and over, wondering if his longtime foe had really grown past their old differences. Wondering why it was he thought Draco would do more with his life than marry rich.
But there was no one in the sitting room or the attached kitchen, which had a kettle bubbling away merrily on a small stove top. Even looking out the window at a pasture that backed up to a forest edge, Draco was at a loss for where he could be. He’d never seen this place before, much less been in a home as far below his station as this clearly was.
“Don’t hurt her,” said Harry. Charlotte’s eyes flickered to Voldemort’s. She had a faraway look about her, but she was still there. Had she recognised his voice?
For his part, Harry was coming to terms with the loss of Charlotte, though the pain was still constant. If anything, he craved time with his friends over the echo chamber of his mind when he was alone. He was more than ready to make amends, but he wondered if he’d get the chance. They hadn’t all been back together since the night of the fight, and Draco hadn't come round at all.
“But how could he believe it? Potter isn’t even named in the prophecy, it could have been anyone if the dates lined up.”
“So you’re just after a name,” clarified Ollivander, nodding.
“Is it true?” he asked, an incredulous smile tugging at his freckled lips. “You’re Harry Potter?”
“It does though,” said Hermione, scanning a medical file. “The autopsy showed high levels of unicorn blood.”
Draco mused.
“I’m trying to figure out what could cause his magical flares,” she explained, cracking open the enormous book in her hands and holding it out for Draco to read. “I started reading up on Obscurials, a rare condition of parasitic dark magic which sounds a bit like Harry’s bursts. An Obscurus forms in a child who suppressed their magical energy, and can take the form of a gust of wind or, in the worst cases, much more destructive qualities.”
“You can still resist it,” said Harry, emotion rising. “He can’t find us here, you said so yourself.”
How could this be possible? Potter was protected under the charm. And if this man had seen Harry, had he seen evidence of Draco together with him?
He was wearing a different set of Muggle clothes today, Draco noticed; dark trousers and a burgundy jumper. Muggles normally looked stupid in their strangely fitted clothes and garish patterns, but this somehow suited him.
“Didn’t think I’d be back here so soon,” muttered Harry, wincing with pain all over as he spoke.
Harry’s brow creased deeply with disappointment and he clenched his fists, feeling the hair on the back of his neck stand up in the now too familiar sign of his magic welling within him.
Harry took a few steps towards the desk where McGonagall fixed him with her wand and cast a detailed incantation to remove the Fidelius. When the spell lifted, Harry felt a strange awareness, like a sense had been slightly dulled for some time and was now fully awoken.
“What house do you think Harry would be in if he were sorted?” asked Luna one night over dinner.
In Sirius’s room that night, Harry lay awake. The lingering tendrils of the wine left him feeling fuzzy around the edges, but the nerves of what the following day held kept him alert.
“Who knows you came?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still turned away.
“Nothing, just thought I’d see if I could offer my services,” said Draco with a shrug.
“I think I’ve seen it,” said Cedric. “Umbridge has one. A big ugly thing, she wears it all the time, always saying how valuable it is.”
He could feel Harry’s presence laughing as the Eagle started pecking at the students in the row behind Luna, trying to get at the snacks they held, so he showed him another one. Luna in the Herbology greenhouse reorganising plants so they could all meet each other. Luna following a cluster of caroling ghosts through the halls at Christmastime and singing along.
Not bad, thought Harry.
Draco stayed with Kreacher for a little while longer as the others headed for bed. When it became clear that he would not let go of the locket for anything, Draco told him he could keep it, which started him crying all over again.
is the least of their worries.”
“No? they must have been too busy intimidating a group of unarmed minors to have been looking very hard.”
“There’s nothing I can say to add to this account,” said Draco, honestly. He thought he saw Snape’s lip twitch.
“What did you say?” Harry looked up and green eyes met his earnestly.
“I can’t allow you to leave, Potter,” said McGonagall evenly. “Not until I deem your magical skills ready.”
“I suppose… If it’s in his best interest.” She withdrew her wand to begin preparations for the spell, casting a nervous glance back up at the squat windows and glossy shrubbery of number four. “Promise me we’ll look after him?”
Harry could feel the familiar tingling in his hands, knowing that his temper was about to amplify whatever magic came out of him next. All the better to show Malfoy and the rest what he was made of, if he could only figure out where to aim it.
“What the hell was that?” he hissed.
“She was experimenting with magic. It was quite awful, really. I was nine when one of her spells backfired and I saw the whole thing.”
She might as well have hit him with a Blasting Curse. Harry felt like his heart had been ripped from him. He turned away from the group, leaning on both hands over his desk to keep from falling.
“There’s more than two if I’m not very much mistaken,” said Dumbledore.
Draco reluctantly accepted the glittering crown, regarding it with a look of scepticism, before placing it on his head, and falling into a deep sleep.
“Mind your own business, Blaise,” said Pansy, kicking the back of his chair.
Harry took a few steps toward the door, kicking the Muggle battery and stubbing his toe, which he silently cursed.
“Professor, I can explain—” started Draco.
Wise words indeed, thought Draco, turning away from the door. Perhaps his designs to get Potter turned over to the Ministry were premature. The only way he could retain control over the situation would be by keeping Potter close. And if that’s what it took, he could make himself indispensable.
Harry trailed off.
“You recognised him, didn’t you,” said Harry, leaning over the chessboard. “I could feel it.”
“We’ve got to be careful,” said Harry, taking a step over the threshold and raising the invisibility cloak. “If anything happened like the damage the ring caused, I wouldn’t be able to help.”
The house-elf Apparated away with a crack as Snape struggled in vain to get back to the swirling marbled surface.
He considered taking the opportunity with McGonagall to ask some of the burning questions he had ever since his first night in the castle, but decided against it when he saw how flat-out exhausted she looked. She tried to remain austere, telling him and Hermione about the conflict in both the Wizengamot and the International Counsel since Dumbledore’s departure, but the added stress of the late Headmaster’s duties was clearly taking its toll on her. Noticing the deep bags under her eyes and feeling perhaps some sort of misplaced pity, he determined it was best to wait for a better time.
Draco was about three glasses of firewhiskey deep when Gemma came and found him at the table. It had become clear that Gemma was a true socialite at heart, and was most interested in valuable connections. So when someone had finally tipped her off about the identity of a few members of her group, Draco officially passed from unimportant bystander to potential social ladder rung and she was determined to leap into his good books.
This was interesting. For as childish as Angelica was on certain topics, he was surprised to detect no hint of jealousy.
“Not yet,” said Hermione, coming to grab a seat near the others by the fire and clutching a light blue book. “But I found something that might be useful regarding your burst magic. I remembered I had this biography about Dumbledore that was published a few years ago when the Ministry was on a campaign to discredit him. In it, there are mentions of the sister he refers to in the letter.”
“And that’s when I followed the HinkyPunks on tour for an entire year. I mean, I was practically part of the band. I travelled on their tour bus and everything. Well, for bits and pieces of the year, anyway. And you won’t believe, they asked me to weigh in on the lyrics to ‘the magic words,’ and I told them to do the line about stirring clockwise for love..”
“I guess Daddy doesn’t tell you everything after all,” said Blaise as Theo grabbed at the letter. “I had hoped you would all be there. Now I don’t know what to make of it.”
Harry tore himself away from the thoughts, looking back up into Hermione’s face. “Maybe this really is just a vision. You could be a trick from the diadem meant to confuse me.”
Snape scratched out an entire paragraph with such force that he snapped the tip of his quill. With a sigh, he looked up at Draco, who raised a taunting eyebrow.
“Son of a Mudblood—”
our future.” Lucius brushed a lock of blonde hair out of her face, tucking it behind her ear. “Don’t you want what’s best for Draco?”
“I know,” said Pansy, pulling an orange off the breakfast platter in the centre of the table. “You’ll be up late brewing my draught of Dreamless Sleep if you don’t help me get started on it before Wednesday’s double Potions.”
Al’s trunk toppled over with a crash as hundreds of small memory phials spilled out, dozens shattering on the floor. The chess set lay hurled among the books and broken glass, the grey sack of fabric that Fawkes had given him the last time he’s seen McGonagall fell at his feet.
But Ivy didn’t move to coil around his wrist like she usually did. Instead she turned her diamond shaped head towards him, flicking out her tongue gently.
She was working down the buttons of his shirt, a drunk smile playing at the corner of her lips as she rubbed a hand against his chest
“The room must be vacated to reconfigure.”
“A gift of knowledge,” interrupted Draco, casting a diagnostic charm that glowed blue. “Everyone knows the stories, it’s a load of rubbish. Luna falling for it, I could see, but what were you thinking? You saw what happened to Dumbledore.”
Now that he was paying attention, Draco’s typically immaculate appearance was long gone, and in its place was a rumpled silk pajama set, a tuft of blond hair sticking straight up, and the faint line of a pillow crease on his cheek. Harry felt a little like he’d inhaled a helium balloon.
Dumbledore paused for a beat as though considering this, casting his eyes into the bag of lemon sweets on his lap.
“Relax, Granger, it’s still the middle of the period, everyone will be in class,” said Malfoy.
“Wise words.” Harry noticed Luna’s plate was still empty. “Aren’t you going to eat anything?”
Harry looked around an opulent room. The walls were a light periwinkle with ornate, black trim, like a widow coming out of mourning. The space was illuminated by the flickering light of candelabras dotting the room. Dark figures moved slowly in oval-framed portraits, glancing at Harry every once in a while with mingled looks of fear and reverence.
“I mean it, Pansy,” he said in a more serious tone. “We’re nearly there. Just help me get through tonight and I’ll make sure you’re in the wedding party.”
Draco picked the black king off of the board and rolled it in his hands. The stone piece was icy cold.
“Keep your musings to yourself, bard, or I’ll tell McGonagall to move you to the astronomy tower,” snapped Draco, annoyed at the pointless delay.
Still no response.
“Oh you know, looking for something of Riddle’s, something that holds a soul, something of great value hidden away.” Luna waved one hand lightly as she turned again. “The room gets it.”
The Potions professor did not look up, he merely kept his gaze fixated on the desk. Only by the time Draco approached, he realised there was nothing there.
The game carried on overhead with Hufflepuff scoring another goal while the Slytherin Beaters tried to run interference with Summerby on his pursuit of the Snitch. Draco could tell they were backing the Snitch into a corner, and it’d have no choice but to make a sharp turn soon if it wanted to evade them. Summerby would be slow on the turn, and Draco could overtake him if he knew which way the blasted thing was going to fly.
“You trying to end my reputation around here, Granger?” joked Draco through gritted teeth. He was smiling as they made their way to the door, but his face was drawn tight.
“Yes, Ivy,” said Luna, nodding. “She’s terribly clever for a snake. Harry can speak to her, you know.”
Harry’s ears were ringing with anger and confusion as he took this in against his will.
This was interesting. If he’d been able to reveal there was a secret, maybe he could describe the Fidelius Charm.
said Ivy from near his ear.
What was happening? He’d come out on this balcony to find Harry, and possibly to tell him something quite personal and vulnerable, and here they were in a stupid spat again. In the same breath, he was feeling gutted by Harry’s disapproval and determined to prove his superiority. His heart was beating in his ears, or maybe that was just the ridiculously loud music.
After a brief discussion on whether Floo powder had an expiration date, Draco was the first to step into the flames which shot up around him and he was gone. Luna stayed behind to keep an eye on the fire so they could get back, and Harry, glamoured as he had been on his first wand fitting, shoved his invisibility cloak into his pocket and followed suit.
“That didn’t breach the International Statute of Wizarding of Wizarding Secrecy?” asked Draco, taking a sip of the horrendously bitter coffee and trying not to grimace.
The woman who Snape had loved, whose life he betrayed, was Lily Potter.
Harry winced reflexively at the title. His upbringing at the Dursleys was something he’d spent his entire life trying to hide, and something he’d done a pretty good job of at that. But Hermione could read him like an open book. The realisation didn’t scare him, as it had done with school guidance counsellors and corrections officers he’d dealt with before, but it surprised him to realise how well his friends had managed to know him in a short amount of time.
“No, I mean it,” she insisted. “You’ve never given us a reason not to trust you. We’d be crazy not to put your mind to good use in all this, and I’m not about to let some stupid prejudice get in the way of that. And so… I’m sorry.”
“Hear me, Potter,” he spat, staring up at him with malice, his breath wheezing. “You will never be rid of me. I will haunt you till the end of your days. I will become a very part of you and you will forever wonder when I will return to end you.”
“Harry knows the dangers, it’s not like him to make a decision like this without talking about it first,” said Cedric, blameful eyes snapping to Draco. “What the hell did you say to him to make him leave, Malfoy?”
“There is nothing,” said Draco, with a tone of seriousness. “That I wouldn’t give to be listening to Muggle records in this attic with you right now.”
“There’s a difference between optimism and delusion, Harry,” said Hermione. “I’m not trying to detract from the plan. I only want to make sure we’re taking reasonable precautions and it doesn’t sound like we are. If we lose you to Voldemort, there will be no ending this thing. Not to mention we have no idea what he intends to do with you.”
“She already left,” said Harry with a laugh that smelled faintly of fire whiskey and mint. “With some quidditch player or other I’m told.”
“I’d imagine he was complicit in some way. After all, Voldemort was certainly able to possess him for long enough,” said Hermione, ticking items on the list. “And we might even know the remaining two; one is the diary that Harry’s vision mentioned, and we have good reason to believe the other one is Hufflepuff’s cup.”
“Not so fast.” Hermione crossed her arms. “If we’re going to keep up a lie to McGonagall that we’re still teaching you, you’re going to need to keep up your studies. There will be no overthrowing of the dark regime unless you stay on curriculum. Deal?”
“Who are these guys?” asked Harry, pointing to a picture of an orange-clad team flying in formation.
Draco stood there stupidly for a few moments, doing nothing but processing the information he’d just received. He’d need to have a serious conversation with his mother for starters, and probably a serious recalibration of his long-term plans. But he wasn’t in the mood for planning. He suddenly wondered if Lucius’s planning and obsessive control of his piece of the world had ultimately been his undoing.
“That’d be too easy,” he called. Though he was beginning to think he might not stand a chance against Draco after all. Dodging a Stunning Spell, the realisation occurred to him that if he couldn’t best a friend in a closed environment, he might not really stand a chance in the real world after all. And if that were true, what good would he be at keeping Charlotte safe when the time came? He nearly got hit by a Full Body-Bind, distracted by the worry of it.
Draco started, caught off guard by the question. “I guess we’re just a different sort,” he said, taking a sip. “I keep to the Slytherins mostly.”
Harry wheeled around on the spot. The portrait of Dumbledore smiled down at them benignly.
By the time he was alone with Angelica a few holes later, Draco was thoroughly paranoid about what she and Harry could be talking about behind his back. He brought it up nonchalantly, or at least he was pretty sure he did.
“I think I know what you’ll like,” she said with a smirk, as she trailed her hands down his chest where she unbuttoned the last few buttons of his shirt. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, imagining that the hands belonged to someone else. Green eyes flashed in his memory.
“Merlin. Well, it helps that you have excellent memorisation,” said Hermione, putting the list to the side and probably suppressing any instinct to crack open the
“I’d love the company, thanks,” he said, rising to clear off the table by the elf shelf. “What’ll you have?”
Neville glanced over his shoulder and, realising Luna was no longer there, turned back to smile sheepishly at Draco. “Oh uh… nevermind, then.”
In fact, he hadn’t been able to get the bespectacled idiot out of his head for days. He kept mulling over the bizarre conversation they’d had — the circumstances around his exit from the Auror force, his conspiratorial riffing on Lucius’s business dealings. And then there was something about this foretold betrayal. Further to Draco’s annoyance, he’d had a dream where the Knight of Wands, the third card in Angelica’s spread, had come riding up to him over a golf course and raised his visor only to turn out to be Harry bloody Potter.
“Of course I’m serious!” said Hermione. “And a lot of help you bloody well were, walking us straight into your girlfriend. She almost caught us in a bind there.”
“Oh?” said Harry, rising from the trunk to take a seat across the table from Luna. “Hope everyone’s alright. I wouldn’t want them to think we were calling things off.”
“I can’t say I fully understand it, but it was a direct request of Dumbledore’s,” said McGonagall. “It is quite fortunate we have Mr Malfoy as an expert. And perhaps each of you will find other ways to impart – yes, Miss Granger?”
As Harry entered the shadow of the porte cochere, the black double doors swung inwards to reveal a wood panelled hallway lined with coats of arms and tall candelabras. Two Death Eaters, one scraggy woman and a stout, blunt man, flanked him silently on either side wearing engraved silver masks. Silently, Harry understood he was to follow.
“He can’t Apparate, which means he’s within walking distance,” said Cedric in a low voice.
“Luna!” said Harry, turning the corner down the last flight of stairs as a familiar blonde head poked her way into the hall.
Lily hadn’t even fought, she’d barely spoken. The Dark Lord had given her an out. She refused, and he killed her. It was more simple than the papers made it out to be.
“I wrote to one of my coven sisters, Violet, and she said it’s even more exclusive than the old prohibition clubs in New York,” Angelica continued, looking around at the others with excitement. “She was absolutely dead with jealousy.”
A jet of green shot upwards through the smoke, bursting in the sky like a firework. Harry looked up as the shape of a skull with an undulating serpent crawling out of its mouth materialised as the two men cackled. Before long, an inhuman shriek could be heard.
Draco stumbled, at a loss for words. He had been pushing Potter rather hard. There had been a lot he was willing to show, more than Draco had been looking for even, but now he worried that the trust he’d spent the last few weeks building was wasted. Harry’s walls were back up, and stronger than before.
“Slytherin catches the Snitch, and the game goes to Slytherin, 180 to 40,” said the announcer amidst the moderate cheers of the crowd. Draco sped to the ground, taking a few running steps onto the pitch and slapping teammates on the back before heading straight back to the locker rooms to change. As he ran past the Regents box he glanced up, anticipating the familiar expression of disapproval, but his father was no longer there.
“Hey, are those my jeans?” he asked.
“This is no good, we’ve got to get him to the hospital wing,” said Hermione, as the healed portion of the cut split open again. “The charm is sticking somehow, it’s deep. I don’t know how to heal this.”
“I didn’t realise it was something that had to be discussed formally. Seeing as you killed my parents without much negotiation,” said Harry.
The inside appeared exactly as Draco would have expected an abandoned Muggle establishment to look. Banged up chairs were still gathered in clusters around tables, waiting for beers to fill their dusty coasters. But as the two of them wound their way through the room, a head poked out from behind a kitchen door.
“Sorry I’m late,” said Draco, pushing through the door of the Room of Requirement and hastening over to where the others sat. “Did I miss it?”
Harry was not convinced the scroll contained anything that might be an item of value to Voldemort and if it did, they were fresh out of luck because every object Luna had read aloud was either locked up in a private museum collection, buried with the dead under heavy protection, or in a location lost to time or the elements.
Hermione was trying to put on a brave face but was struggling to mask the worry in her eyes. And she wasn’t wrong. Even if they had backup, they would still need a miracle to pull this off. It was the one time he wouldn’t be annoyed to see a deus ex machina.
Looking at the chest, Harry was struck with a funny thought.
Hermione leapt up to vanish the broken teapot and she and Harry headed to the kitchen to brew a fresh batch. When Kreacher had calmed down enough to be moved, Draco walked him over to the fireplace and seated him on the armchair. Hermione handed him a cup of tea which he held shakily in one hand, gripping the locket hard in the other.
“I’d imagine some mutilation or disfigurement for anyone who tried to wear it?” suggested Draco, remembering the description of Dumbledore’s blackened hand.
Suddenly he felt something whiz by his ear. He followed the projectile to spot a rock smacking against the pavement ahead of him. He looked over his shoulder to see Dudley and his crew of pudgy faced mates on thick-tired mountain bikes, racing after Harry and laughing as they hurled another rock in his direction.
“My aunt and uncle, were they alright?” he asked, turning back to Cedric.
Draco glanced back at Gemma, slightly impressed by her endurance, but mostly wondering how she was still going on about herself. At any rate, he wasn’t dying to go anywhere else at the moment and at least he could think through the issues presented to him at his afternoon’s meeting while simultaneously tuning her out entirely. He sensed a pause in her babbling and smiled and nodded in her direction while signalling a waiter for another whiskey. She carried on about the difference between casting spells in Greek versus English, and he turned his mental energy to the problem at hand.
“When the Dark Lord has selected you to join his inner circle, you will know it,” said Lucius, reaching for his own glass of Bordeaux. “For me, it was the honour of protecting an object he held most dear. One of the only items in the material world that he cared about above all else.”
said the small snake.
Angelica would have been a saving grace, but he’d refused to go on the dance floor and she’d befriended a few of Gemma’s acquaintances who had taken her to dance. He could see her sleek ponytail swishing about in the throng of people as the band got to the chorus of some ear-splitting, heavy beat. At least she was enjoying herself. That was one less thing to worry about.
As she stepped back, he could see she had plastered on an expression of excitement, but there was a crease of worry between her eyebrows.
The wand tip glowed with a brilliant white light, like a star. He looked up at the others, beaming. Ollivander looked on with a knowing smile.
“Did I just hear Hermione Granger insult a lesson plan?” said Draco, raising his eyebrows appreciatively. If he didn’t know better, he might start to think there was more behind the insufferable bookworm than he’d been led to believe.
“Though I need some assurances. After all, if we are to trust each other we should enter this agreement on good terms.”
Angelica smiled broadly, but did not laugh in her usual way. “No my dear, it’s written all over your face,” she said, then cocked her head to the side, “And in the findings of the detailed investigation I commissioned on you.”
“I heard you took down a pair of Death Eaters with nothing but a
“Yes,” said Draco, more quickly than he had intended. Leaning in to kiss him again, Harry kissed him back.
“Nevermind, don’t let me stop you,” said Draco.
Draco hesitated. Less at the request of the painting and more so at a loss of where to go. The common room was out, as was the Great Hall. He couldn’t bear to see any of his friends in his present state. Snape would probably turn him away cold. He could always go to the astronomy tower and avoid everyone, but with his luck there’d be a special meeting of the star gazing club already there.
“Right, let’s do this,” said Theo, shoving the paper into his robes’ pocket and loading up his plate with breakfast. Draco, unsure whether he’d be able to keep food down, excused himself to head early to the pitch.
On Sunday evening, Harry was surprised to hear a light knock on his door. He quickly covered his experimental charms research as a blonde head poked through.
“At least we can take some comfort in the fact that he’s twice the mortality age of most Obscurials on record.”
The flames crackled quietly in the grate, casting dancing shadows on the group.
“Er, this is my living room?” He winced as his voice trailed upwards; somehow the presence of his old professor made him still feel eleven years old.
But the bard merely scrabbled to get his papers in order, jotting down what he’d just said. “Fears… secrets… laid bare, yes yes, that’s good.”
Borgin let out a small noise of admiration as he pulled the final layer of fabric away to reveal the golden ring with its rough, black stone sitting menacingly in the middle of the cloth. He whispered a few diagnostic spells and fiddled with the dials on his spectacles while the ring sat motionless; reflecting the sinister shop in its thick golden band.
“Huh,” said Malfoy.
“They’re a fun crowd, but not the most interesting chat,” said Harry, following his gaze. At that moment, one witch spilled her drink and another wheeled on her.
“The Collective,” said Draco, under his breath. He had assumed this man was the Collective, but of course his father’s acquaintances would be more careful than to let themselves be found by direct means. Greenacre was merely a middleman. Perhaps intentionally chosen for his inability to use magic.
“Outrageous,” said Cedric, warming his hands on one of Kreacher’s hot cocoas. “Can’t everyone see what’s happening? It's not a school anymore, it’s a prison.”
“Yes,” he said. Then picked his head back up to look at Pansy, who met his eyes with a look of hesitant concern.
He was just about to tell her off when a defiant voice from over Draco’s shoulder called out, “Hey! Leave her alone.” The two of them turned as Neville Longbottom rounded the corner and took what he probably intended to be an imposing stance between Draco and Luna.
“Don’t be coy with me, Snape,” barked Draco, losing his patience. “Potter has some connection to the Dark Lord. I know you know something about it.”
A folk rock song started with a slightly melancholy guitar. Draco turned around, looking proud of himself to have successfully figured it out.
“Well, you’re obviously not playing it right,” said Draco, feeling his lips quirking into a smile as he anticipated Harry’s reaction to what was about to unfold. As one might with an adorable puppy, Draco told himself sternly, and not with an incredibly attractive wizard. “Pawn to E4.”
“So you and I were best friends with Ron Weasley,” said Hermione, twirling a lock of hair and looking uncharacteristically flustered. “And we’d separated from the others to go Horcrux hunting on our own because we were the only ones who believed Voldemort could be defeated. Sounds oddly familiar.”
Draco paused for a moment, considering whether he should write this question off as another gap in Potter’s Muggle-raised brain and plough forward with his plan to look at early memories or stop and correct him. One might even say it was his duty to the sport to make sure Harry knew what he was missing.
“This is no laughing matter, my dear,” said Umbridge, leering over her and twirling her wand. “Where is Harry Potter?”
“Fuck, that scar is a lot of trouble,” he said, reaching up to move a lock of hair across Harry’s forehead.
“The point is, she’s alive! She’s at Wisteria Hall with other prisoners,” said Draco, rising as well. “It’s not like Alice.”
“The Dark Lord is requesting your presence,” said Wormtail. Lucius quickly rose to his feet. “Both of you.”
“I understand my father used to partner with you on investment opportunities,” Draco continued hastily. “What exactly was the nature of your arrangement?”
“See, that’s what I find hard to believe, Professor,” said Draco. “You were in his inner circle. You know exactly why he went looking for Potter. And in order to do my job well, I expect you to tell me whether he thought Potter was a threat or an opportunity.”
retelling of the events, and she wanted the truth.
“This doesn’t have to end the same way,” said Voldemort. “Just tell me where you are. I’d very much like to meet you, face to face.”
Harry recognised a few of the more outlandish memories, and he and Draco swapped stories; Harry retelling the mundane version Al had told him and Draco recounting what had actually happened until the light from the window faded away entirely.
“It’s fine, Draco, really!” said Pansy, putting her hands on his shoulders and squaring up to him. “I won’t tell anyone. I know what you’re afraid of – the Dark Lord will want you in a partnership eventually that can produce pure-blood offspring, so you’re right to keep it hidden for now, anyway.”
“Well, his family are known to trade in that sort of thing,” said Hermione, levitating the ring into a cloth napkin that had come with breakfast. “The Malfoys have been tied to the dark arts in the past, though their records have all been expunged obviously.”
“Oh! Didn’t see you there, my boy,” said the bard brightly, propping a leg up on a nearby bench and strumming a chord on his lute. “I’m busy provoking the muse, as it were. Working on my crowning achievement – though I’ve only just started. It’s sure to be legendary. Care to hear it?”
Draco pointed his wand directly at Potter, whose eyes flickered for a moment before Draco was sucked into them. “
“Hermione in the diadem told me your father has it.” Harry shifted onto his side to look at Draco in profile. “And she hasn’t been wrong about anything yet.”
“Besides that, though,” said Harry, shifting restlessly. “It wasn’t just that you weren’t on the hunt with us, we were enemies. You betrayed Dumbledore. You… you were a Death Eater.”
Of course, it was so simple. If Potter was under the protection of the charm, but he wasn’t part of it, he’d be able to spill his own secret without even knowing it. And of course he was only an infant at the time it was cast, it’s not as though he was consulted on the matter.
“I think she’d agree that our priority is keeping you out of the Ministry’s hands,” said Draco, crossing to the wardrobe and throwing a set of school robes in Harry’s direction. “Put these on under the cloak just in case.”
“So just think of the memory I want to access, any memory at all,” said Harry, thinking of the green flash.
“Yeah, she’s also brilliant by muggle standards,” said Harry with a smile. “And don’t forget, Cedric is working with Muggles as well. I’d wager our worlds are coming closer together, not farther apart.”
“You’ve destroyed the spoon,” said Draco, obligingly.
Draco leaned forward, elbows on his knees, looking like he was contemplating how to reply.
“That’s right,” said Greenacre, nodding slowly with a strange glint in his eye. “They Collective acted as co-signatories on the deal.”
“Master?” said Snape. Draco was surprised to hear a tone of amusement in his voice. “Keep your glory, Draco. If it were power I sought, I would not have become a teacher. But be careful – our ‘Master’ is not known for sharing power, and he grows stronger every day.”
“I know the type,” said Harry. He could have guessed that much from the way Malfoy held himself; his confident posture, the way he sauntered into the room and ran his hands across Harry’s things as if he owned them. “I can deal with him if it means learning what I need to to get out of here.”
It also didn’t help that Draco was looking particularly refined as he sat with one leg crossed over his knee, chin resting in his hand, perched on the arm of the chair as he looked over the plans they had sketched out. Only Draco could make a zigzag striped jumper and joggers look elegant.
He laid a gentle hand on her back as Blaise and Theo sized him up over her shoulder. “I’ll do my best.”
The battery rolled about a metre across the floor with a loud scraping noise, scattering motorcycle gears in every direction.
“Horcruxes,” said Harry. “Seven of them. A vessel to hold your soul when your human form dies so you can keep regenerating. Yeah, I know all about them.”
“That’s not just any chess set, Harry,” said Hermione, crossing the room in a few quick steps. “That’s a wizard’s chess set!”
Harry felt a sizzle across his brow. “Ouch,” he said.
“Hey Granger,” he said, quirking an eyebrow. “I bet this will look great on your Department of Mysteries application.”
“So what, you just grow up the same way as your parents then? Same ideals? Live in the same house?” asked Harry, flopping back in his chair sleepily. Draco hadn’t realised how much time had passed, but it was pitch black outside the diamond-paned window. “Sounds boring.”
Harry saw him and returned a nervous smile, waiting for him in the shadows. “Everyone’s alright?” he asked.
“He’s a Parselmouth,” said Draco. A flicker of understanding passed through his professor’s eyes.
“I don’t think so.”
“Let me go! Let me go,” he moaned against Draco’s grip.
“What if I’m not?” said Draco. “What if I’m damned like the version you saw in your vision – would you be saying the same thing if I was the one who betrayed Dumbledore?”
He was about to push past her when something in the book caught her eye. “Wait a minute,” she said.
“I was coming to give you a revised timetable to meet with you-know-who,” said Hermione, pulling a scroll of parchment out of her bag. “But if my telling you this will interrupt your flirting, feel free to let McGonagall know.”
Instead, he grabbed Draco’s other wrist, pulling him close. Draco pressed his forehead to Harry’s, and all Harry wanted to do was pull him closer.
“Fine,” she said curtly. “Though you had better run it by Harry. He trusts you, Draco.”
“I assume you are familiar, Mr Malfoy, with the events of 31 October, 1981, when a wizarding family opposed the Dark Lord, resulting in their demise and effectively ending the First Wizarding War?” asked McGonagall.
“Why are you telling me this?” He asked. “I know you want to kill me, so why go to all this trouble first? Surely you have the manpower. Why not overtake me and be done with it?”
Harry stumbled back instinctively, shoving Draco away and locking eyes with him, confusion etched across his face. Draco felt a moment of panic, like the floor had been ripped out from under him, when suddenly Harry was back in his arms. Their lips crashed together and Harry wrapped a firm hand around the back of his neck, drawing him close.
“Trouble in paradise?” drawled Blaise, who was reclined at the potions desk in front of them, reading the weekend’s Quidditch results while Theo scrambled to finish their draught.
“Sorry to interrupt,” said Draco, sauntering in with his hands in the pockets of his robes.
Snape bartered for Lily’s life, Lily bartered for Harry’s. And Draco had held it in the palm of his hand, about to give it away to the Dark Lord with no more than a second thought.
“Give it a rest, Diggory, it’s not the real locket!” snapped Draco.
As Harry and Charlotte approached Woking Station, the clock chimed quarter till midnight. That would give them just enough time to get tickets for the last departure up to London. Which was a good thing too – Harry wasn’t sure if his mind was capable of complex troubleshooting after the events of the last few hours.
“Wow, this is what it feels like when it’s in control,” mused Harry. “Normally by this point someone’s lost their eyebrows. How long does it take to grow out of the flare-ups?”
Gemma carried on obliviously, “I know right. But really, when he’s all together, he’s pretty cute. And by the time I met him at the gala, he was completely over it. We really hit it off, and I was telling him if he ever wanted to come party, I could get him into all the right places. He owled me the next day and wanted to go out and we’ve been partying ever since!”
“Harry Potter lives,” she said. “He has been hidden these last 16 years, protected under this very Fidelius.”
Only now the Fidelius had caused such a mess for him he didn’t know where his spying started and usurping of the cause ended. Not only was he teaching Harry to Occlude, he was even helping him dig into Dumbledore’s memories to discover ways the Dark Lord could be overthrown. Whose side was he even on?
He caught the boy around the elbow, which was slimy with sun cream, and dragged him back to shore, depositing him on the sand where he lay coughing and hacking. In a flash, the horse-faced woman was running at the other boy with a towel, helping him steadily to his feet and guiding him back to a beach blanket where she started pulling out snacks.
when they’ve killed!”
But Pansy had already turned back towards the house and was beckoning a house-elf to come refill the teapot. He must have imagined it.
“The point is,” Draco continued, mustering up the patience he could. “We’re going to need a suitable cover if we’re going to keep this up.”
“Good, yes. We can put that one to rest. It’s funny really that’ll be Lucius’s legacy. As far as I knew, he didn’t believe a lick of it. See, I first met your father when we were about your age. My father worked with your grandfather, Abraxas, on renewed international trade relations between the US and the UK, so we used to hop the pond a few times a year.
“Well, he was at the appeal hearing, so he would know,” said Blaise with a shrug. “I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s a skilled Auror. I’m sure he knows what he’s doing.”
“For a Muggle, maybe,” said Draco, exactly like Harry thought he would.
“What is it exactly you hope to accomplish?” asked Snape, continuing to sort his drawers rather than face Draco head on.
“It’s not a prophecy, just optimism,” said Harry, moving his queen into check.
“Tell me Potter hasn’t botched a Ticking Curse,” drawled Draco. “This will be a nightmare to clean up.”
“Oh?” said Ollivander, resting a few weathered fingers on his chin in thought. “And what could two students such as yourselves want with that sort of information?”
“And so, some debts go unpaid,” said Greenacre with a small sigh. “There was very little opportunity for recourse at any rate, and before long, Lucius was out of our grasp.” He paused and Draco looked up to meet a slightly chilly stare. “You look very much like him, you know.”
Draco was next to him, calling out, trying to support him, but Harry couldn’t hear any of it.
Mr Dupont stopped in his tracks and his magical trolley bounced off his ankles and wheeled quickly away in a worried manner. He fixed Draco with a look of surprise and let out a big belly laugh.
He threw a copy of
“Oh yeah, right,” said Harry.
“That would be consistent with Slytherin’s locket, I suppose,” said Harry. “If Voldemort chose an object from each of the four houses, that’s half our hunting done!”
, as if he didn’t remember they had already read it front to back with him last year, before he’d combined 6th & 7th year curriculums to have more time for book signings.
The smoke was so thick now Harry could only see fluffy white clouds at the end of the hall, and with the echoing in the space he could hardly tell where a taunting laugh was coming from.
“Insane,” substituted Harry. He wanted to believe it was coincidence that Draco was the one to uncover this, but the hint of nerves in his voice made Harry think otherwise.
They spent the next hour winding their way through Draco’s memory of the Manor. Each room held a distinct memory, from a different age, a different emotion.
“I’m pretty sure you saw all of them last time.”
“Damn,” said Harry, flopping back onto his pillows. “If I’m honest, I’d suspected you’d given me up for a minute. I didn’t want to believe it though.”
She raised an eyebrow sceptically. “Well, I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Pince will have your head if you try and take anything out of here without her approval.”
As he squared up for his final defence lesson with Cedric, Harry was feeling ready to prove himself. Four weeks of learning had culminated in a hobnob collection of charms, a few defensive spells, and at least a handful of experiments that were working out for him so far.
Hermione looked like she was going to lay into him, but just scoffed and rose to her feet. “Fine, let me show you the part you need so you can get it over with.”
“Well, yes, but why would you want to wear glasses when you don’t have to?” asked Hermione
The only light from the room, a sliver of moonlight through the narrow castle window, was obscured as a dark, silvery shape emerged from the shadows.
“If you want me to join you,” said Harry, taking a step forward. “He goes free.”
“You’ve got it all figured out, haven’t you,” said Draco, running a hand through his hair and blinking back the encroaching exhaustion.
wand movement for what felt like the hundredth time.
“That’s not how Al told it, but that version sounds way better,” said Harry with a laugh, dropping a few books back in the chest and turning to face Draco instead. “What was he really like?”
At the following hole, Draco had a shocker of a first shot, and his sliced ball landed somewhere in the tall grass while the others walked together down the fairway. He could see the three of them chatting animatedly, and Harry was telling a story where he was gesturing wildly, which had both DuPonts in stitches.
Cedric shook his head once. “Veritaserum,” he muttered.
Harry knew there was no point in arguing against Kreacher’s loyalty. He nodded and Kreacher dashed into the kitchen to bring food for the others and hear the end of the briefing.
“Maybe McGonagall—” started Hermione, glancing up from the note.
No sooner had it swung back into place than the room started gently spinning around the table like a carousel, the frames rattling softly against the walls. Angelica and Blaise inspected some pictures with interest, chatting about Angelica’s most recent trip to the Amalfi Coast, while Gemma looked disinterestedly at her nails. Pansy was saying something to Harry about his early retirement and Draco, looking for something in the room to pretend to be interested in, kept his eyes on the chandelier overhead, which appeared to be stretching upwards.
“To be sure,” said Draco, thinking the loss was certainly not so great for his kind. “I imagine there will be changes to my Head Boy duties to keep things under control. Should we have Padma here as well?”
Meanwhile, something squirmed uncomfortably in the pit of his stomach; something that felt very much like regret. But what should he have to regret? Sure, it was a rotten thing to do to trick Potter like that, but he’d done his duty to the brethren. It was his own fault for allowing feelings to develop. He would have to strengthen his resolve if he was going to become truly great. The Dark Lord could never know how close he had come to slipping.
“Neither do I.”
“I don’t want to,” said Angelica with a pout. “I’ve been waiting all night to spend a little quality time with my fiancé.”
“Look, this might not make any sense, but there’s something I’ve been meaning to say. It’s been rolling around in my head for ages and I just haven’t had the nerve to figure out how to tell you.”
“Never,” said Cedric, standing near Hermione at the table and gripping the back of a chair. “It’s not something we were trained on, and believe me, we learned about all sorts of obscure magic. Maybe it was just a bogus memory to throw us off the trail.”
“I’m serious! He oughta know what he’s in for.” DuPont smiled proudly.
Harry was still blinking as he pulled the robes over his Muggle clothes and rose to walk towards the wardrobe. As the room came into focus, he stopped in his tracks. Looking back at him was a sandy brown haired wizard with brown eyes and high cheekbones.
The man blinked up at him, nostrils flaring. Harry was reminded of the petulant youth from Video City, trying to maintain resolve in the face of authority.
Snape’s warning played on repeat in Draco’s mind over the following days. His waking hours were spent weighing up the merits of various plans of action, none of them satisfactory. And his nights were taken up with strange dreams of Harry, sometimes standing next to him victoriously, other times racked with a look of betrayal.
“That sounds familiar,” said Harry, looking at a moving photo of a small child getting frightened and disappearing with a pop. “I can normally tell when it’s about to happen if my temper is getting out of control.”
For once, Draco let go of any thought of strategy or allegiances or hierarchy. There was something he could do for Harry that no one else could, and he wanted to do it.
Draco scoffed. Just when he thought there was nothing else that could surprise him.
“You’re going to get more than you bargained for with this group,” said Draco to Harry as the others flagged down a passing waitress.
“Fine, I’ll go first,” said Harry, grateful that Draco wouldn’t be able to see him for this. “I was thinking a lot about the diadem vision over break. You know the one where we were enemies.”
“You’re the one choosing the memories,” said Malfoy. “If those are your best I don’t want to see your worst.”
Harry gripped the man around the throat and saw his own grey hands, the flesh peeling away at the nails. “The day will soon come, Yaxley, when excuses will no longer suffice. For I do not suffer fools.”
As the scene played out, Draco was surprisingly warmed to see his old Headmaster again. He looked exactly as he had the first time Draco had laid eyes on him at the start of term feast in first year. Sure his beard was shorter and he was missing his trademark powder blue robes, but there was no mistaking the whimsical spirit behind the pale eyes.
“I like her,” said Harry. “She certainly keeps Hermione on her toes.”
Draco’s lip curled into a smile. “This may hurt just a bit.”
“You know how it is. We have to set expectations for the new team members, otherwise they’ll just take the piss every chance they get.”
“What about the compass of the sea mage Bartholomew Roberts? It was rumoured to be able to direct the holder to any treasure they desired,” said Luna, paging through a copy of
“Fine,” said Draco. This had better be worth it. “
“If I may, Headmistress,” said Snape.
“Fine by me,” said Cedric with a shrug. “As long as you’re in the Room of Requirement. Granger?”
What? He sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. He had locked the door—he was sure of it. There shouldn’t be anyone else in his rooms. Not that he’d say no to Draco making an appearance, but that was about as likely as—
As billowing smoke filled the empty platform, Harry looked over his shoulder, spotting Charlotte taking cover by a support beam, her mouth open in shock.
“I don’t know! Charlotte wouldn’t have said it if it wasn’t a clue,” said Harry, scanning the labels on the remaining phials, desperate for something they could have missed that would tell him how to end this nightmare.
“Right, and I suppose the Muggles have got it all figured out, do they?” snapped Draco.
“I do!” said Luna, sitting down cross legged next to Harry. “What are they for then?”
“It’s not a matter of fixing, there’s nothing wrong with you,” said Hermione, smiling. “In fact, if your training with Cedric is anything to go by, it may even contribute to why your magic is so strong in some areas. And you can learn to control it over time. M went on to live a totally normal life.”
Draco reached for his wand with a shaking hand. Charlotte gazed disinterestedly around the room and blinked, looking frighteningly like Alice Longbottom had on the night Draco committed his first Unforgivable. What a cruel irony that Charlotte would be his second.
“What does unicorn blood matter?” asked Harry
“What was that?” said Draco.
Malfoy looked momentarily surprised, but his expression smoothed almost immediately. “Darling, I thought you had time with Flitwick for extra Charms prep today?”
“Why not? I’ve been replaying it over and over in my mind all day, anyway. Might as well have you along for the ride.” Harry shifted into a sitting position, wincing at the pain in his leg.
Voldemort was clearly not expecting this outburst from a mere Muggle. As Death Eaters jumped to their feet at the table behind her, Voldemort shoved her backwards where she fell in a heap.
If you’ve noticed a marked improvement in my writing since the last chapter, it’s all thanks to my incredible new beta, Honeybeet! Having written the first few chapters on my own, I’ve quickly realised how much better life is having someone brilliant driving clarity around character motivation and weighing in on my half baked ideas. Honeybeet, thanks heaps for all your help on this :)
on her lap.
Luna understood immediately, and without another word, she sat down next to him and rested her head against his shoulder.
“Puddifoot’s is rubbish,” said Draco. “I’ll take you somewhere with a bit more class.”
“You’re early,” said Harry, scraping the wrought-iron chair back and sitting opposite him.
“So, I was thinking we could have you two play together as one team and me and Harry as another,” said Angelica.
“Criminal! On what charges?” interrupted McGonagall.
He turned towards Draco and took a few paces, stopping when they were face to face, his expression unreadable. Draco suddenly realised how large he was.
He darted out an arm, stopping Draco’s path. “Wait! There’s somethi—”
Like a light switch, the rage inside him built up instantly. He could feel the tingling in his hands and the buzzing in his ears as he beheld Charlotte’s still form. The hooded creature turned to look at him through the mist as a burst of energy pulsed through Harry. He fell to his knees, straining against the pain in his head to try and make it over to Charlotte. But when he looked up, the hooded creature was still there, unaffected. It glided towards him just as a fresh, white hot pain split into his scar.
“He’s an impenetrable wall. Dumbledore would be proud,” said Draco.
“For you, anything,” said Draco, keeping his eye on Hermione and Luna, who were still talking in hushed voices.
He couldn’t remember Christmas a very happy time before, but spending the holiday running around the castle with Luna was a much needed bit of cheer. They’d even found their way down to the kitchens on Christmas eve, and the house-elves treated them to their own mini feast as Luna and Harry praised them copiously for all the amazing food they had sent up to the Room of Requirement over the year.
“I just heard it the other day when we were practising. I didn’t know it could do so much damage,” said Harry, noticing Hermione and Cedric exchange a worried look. “Fuck, I’m so sorry.”
Cedric instructed him in the wand gesture and positioned him at the end of the practice area, lining up his shoulders and aiming down the corridor. Harry focused his energy on the targets, picturing Dudley’s leering face as he and his friends pelted rocks at him.
“He is here,” said Harry. The words tasted funny in his mouth. His breath sounded like wheezing. “I can feel him.”
The wand tip lit with a beautiful blue glow. Harry was amazed. He brought the tip close to his face to see his handiwork up close as Hermione clapped her hands together and said, “Well done, Harry! This takes first-years weeks to master, so we’re already moving right along.”
said Harry, though he wasn’t sure whether he was trying to reassure Ivy or himself at this point.
The old wandmaker did not jerk in response as so many had done, but his eyes got a faraway look to them as he said, “I see…”
Harry was not surprised to see less of his friends over the following days. Cedric was called in to the department more frequently, Hermione made excuses about her class work picking up, and Draco had all but disappeared.
The bard glanced at his frame and said, “In life… surely.”
“He did it for us,” insisted Harry, willing Hermione to understand. “Voldemort would have killed him otherwise, so he took the Mark to come back to us and bring the cup. But now he’s been summoned and the Death Eaters will know he’s betrayed them. And it’s all fucked.”
“Life saver,” said Harry with a grin. “Bring the mimbletonia here and let’s get it in before Hermione asks too many questions.”
If Hermione really had taken the wards off the doors, he might be able to go find a nurse of some sort, but he had no idea where the hospital wing was, and he couldn’t leave Luna alone in case her condition worsened.
“Be careful what you say,” said Draco at last.
“I’m not interested, Draco.”
“Don’t let him get away with it, Harry!” trumpeted Luna, as the rest of the table laughed.
Harry kept to his word over the following days, focusing on Severing and Mending charms, if only because Cedric hadn’t managed to get the new password to Dumbledore’s office until McGonagall was back at the castle.
He wasn’t sure what to make of Malfoy just yet. The first day they met he thought Malfoy embodied everything he hated about elitists, but the last Legilimency session had come as a bit of a surprise. He seemed genuinely interested in helping Harry access his memories, and he’d been true to his word about letting Harry take the lead.
“And he let you out with this information?” Draco sat back, fixing Harry with an incredulous stare.
“Is everything alright professor?” asked Hagrid, surprised. He looked back and forth between the wizard and the witch, meeting her gaze with a questioning look.
Lucius’s face softened almost indiscernibly. “And look at you now. Soon you’ll have your own seat at the table.”
This was not good. Harry could feel the connection strengthening. The potion must be doing something to bring them closer together. He strained to pull away. A splitting pain ripped through his scar and he cried out. He tried pushing McGonagall away, to get her out of the blast radius if he could.
Draco narrowed his eyes at the panting. He despised riddles. “Are you giving me a warning?”
“I showed you this memory,” said Harry, his voice shaking. “I saw her die over the summer and you saw the memory and didn’t say any of this. You looked Neville in the eye today – does he even know?”
“We’re just tutoring each other!” snapped Hermione, flustered. Draco rolled his eyes. The girl had no decorum. “But we’re done now. I was just heading to professor McGonagall’s office.”
Pansy raised her eyebrows in Draco’s direction as he pushed back from the table.
“Patience, Skywalker,” said Harry. “All will be revealed.”
Hermione and Cedric exchanged a nod as Harry carried on.
“My understanding of the old family issues was that they were about political alliances,” said Draco tentatively. “Specifically, my family’s stance on magical and non-magical relations.”
Hermione looked just as surprised as he felt to hear the words. “Oh. Well, have you tried sharing a memory from your end? A bit of reciprocity might help him feel like he’s not so alone.”
“I know she takes classes in the west corridor. Everyone does,” said Malfoy, sounding bored. “But how could I have known she would be there then? I covered for us. Trust me, the only thing she’ll remember about the last hour is what we did when we went behind the tapestry of the Hippogriff migration and—”
“Why would you think I know?”
“Something tells me I won’t be sad to miss out on Transfiguration,” said Harry with a grateful smile.
“You saw the
“Let’s start with something simple to build control, like the first time you rode a broom or your favourite Christmas present or something,” suggested Draco, waving a careless hand.
“It was here!” cried Kreacher, and all heads snapped back in his direction as the elf dissolved into tears once more. “Master Regulus trusted Kreacher to destroy the locket, but Kreacher failed! Kreacher failed…”
Draco squeezed it in response, and then rose, heading to the end table where there was a pot of tea waiting.
Not bad, thought Draco. If he navigated back to the small room, this would be a decent start at memory traversing. Then suddenly a giant shape blocked out the sun. Harry turned slowly, a deep sense of foreboding as a lumbering moustached man came towards him.
“Sorry I’m late,” he said as he caught sight of them. He looked like he’d had about a hundred hours of sleep since Draco had last laid eyes on him. He was dressed in a refined sort of sporty muggle outfit with navy pants and a dark grey jumper. Draco immediately regretted Angelica’s help on his wardrobe for the day.
“Right. Well, I think we’re ready to attempt the deep recollection work again,” said Draco, dragging them back to the task at hand. “Perhaps what was different about the first time we attempted this was that I was pushing you deeper. If you trust me, why don’t I try taking a more active role in guiding the direction of your memory this time.”
This was no good. The smokescreen was clearing into the open air. He wouldn’t have much time before they found him, and on this leg he’d have no shot of making a run for it. If only he knew a blasting curse or something substantial. Diggory’s defensive magic was quickly exhausted in the face of real assailants, who had probably by now figured out that the worst Harry could do was try and dodge them.
“Funny enough, that’s news to me,” said Harry, balancing a large pot shard in place with one hand and attempting to mend it with the other.
“That’s true,” said Harry in an attempt at amends. “But without Luna’s mad scientist perspective on everything, we probably wouldn’t have found the diadem at all. It was here in the room.”
“I’ve re-thought the approach actually.” Draco eyed him evenly. “The trouble with memory is it can be an emotional experience. When I learned Occlumency, it was from someone who already knew much of my history. I had control over what I did and didn’t share. I hadn’t considered that it might be a significantly different experience to sharing your memories with a stranger.”
“No, really. I’m dying to know what you could think you know about my life. You might think you have some notion of it after a few conversations over a pint, but you have no idea.”
Right, the family dispute over muggle rights or some such nonsense.
And as he flew, the world around him dimmed before he had another chance to look back.
That evening, once Hermione and Cedric had helped return the room to his living quarters and repaired a few pieces of missing stone from the castle walls, Harry sat with his chin resting on his folded arms, gazing into Ivy’s terrarium. He’d popped a bit of raw meat in the corner of her space, hoping it would entice her out.
“You could definitely do worse.”
“It’s a terribly dark piece of magic that You-Know-Who invented to keep people in line,” said Hermione, biting her nail with worry. “It’s said he could use it as a homing beacon, to find and punish his followers if they ever betrayed him. But no one really knows if—”
“I’d back that guess,” said Harry casually. “What do you say, Malfoy? Would you bet ten galleons against the word of a clairvoyant?”
“I completely agree,” said Draco, as an idea occurred to him. “I could come along to your next lesson with Diggory if you like. See if I can’t help push things along, maybe suggest a few useful spells.”
“Cupboard under the stairs.” Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat
“What did she say?” Draco asked before he could catch himself.
“Who?” she asked quietly.
“It would appear so,” said Draco, regarding his most recent attempt with disdain.
By the time Draco arrived from practice, Cedric was already there, updating Hermione and the others on the latest news on the political gridlock of the Wizengamot. It was becoming an ever more popular topic in the general wizarding public, as evidenced by an article from the day’s
The water trickled into Draco’s mouth, but nothing seemed to happen. Harry frowned as he tossed the cup to the side, holding Draco’s body with both hands. Not when they were this close, he thought.
“Definitely not,” she said, shaking her head. “If anyone had the funds to set up a large-scale search for us it’s your parents.”
He hadn’t realised how vast the stupid venue was until he’d attempted to find his way around drunk. Only then did he discover the strange corridors and curtained alcoves that sprung off the main floor in random directions, only to rejoin the venue in another spot. After searching unsuccessfully for a considerable while, he made his way out onto the balcony, leaning his elbows on the railing and staring out at the glittering nightscape of sleeping London.
“Not in the slightest! In fact, this wand is incredibly clever, and may even act of its own accord,” said Ollivander with a laugh. “However, it takes after its owner in disposition. Holly wands tend to pick owners with a bit of a temper, you know, and they like an adventure. It’s rumoured that they seek an owner who is on a particularly dangerous quest.”
Draco grabbed a mug from the table, tossing in the alihotsy branch and filling it with an
Meanwhile the painting of the bard had tossed its parchment to the side and looked like it was about to tear its hair out.
“That’s alright, we only got back a bit ago. We stayed until the last band finished. It was incredible,” she said, flicking her long hair off her shoulders as she approached and twining her arms around his neck. “Is Harry alright?”
said Lord Voldemort, his wand pointed directly at her.
Harry scanned the faces in the foyer before spotting their group on the settee. He made eye contact with Draco and his face broke into his familiar grin. Draco felt an unpleasant tightness in his chest at the suddenness of Harry’s arrival. He somehow looked even better in his black muggle suit than Draco looked in his, and he raised his hand in an easy wave in their direction. Draco tore his eyes away, pretending to be interested in Pansy’s muttering, “speak of the devil.”
and holding up his wand. “I fixed the battery, check it out.
“Good grief, Harry, does McGonagall know?”
“Draco,” was all Harry could say. “Don’t leave.”
Harry tried to open his eyes against a feeling of grogginess, reaching around for his glasses, his hands trailing over crisp starched sheets. He was definitely in a hospital of some sort. The brightness of the room and the shape of a nurse tending to him seemed to confirm this.
“Yes, well. There’s far more in the Restricted Section than what you should be spending your time on, Merlin knows.”
And though it was taking longer than he would have hoped to get the missing pieces of information they needed, Harry was content knowing that they had a plan.
“I am honoured, my lord,” said Draco, kneeling, as the cold hand closed around his wrist and the point of a wand was dragged down the pale skin of his forearm.
“Why won’t anybody say his name?” demanded Harry, looking at the others. “Will somebody please just tell me about Voldemort!”
Harry tried to push away, but Voldemort held fast. Remembering his training, Harry attempted to Occlude – maybe he could sever the link on his own.
Harry nodded. He’d always known that Draco had skills the others didn’t, and he’d chalked it up to a privileged upbringing. But what sort of parents were protecting their son from physical harm and mental probing, alongside the more standard flying and duelling lessons?
A rock dropped in Harry’s stomach, remembering how he struggled against the wards when McGonagall told him he couldn’t leave. How he’d felt a gripping fear that he hadn’t experienced since Vernon had turned the key in the lock of the cupboard under the stairs.
“Here is where you must learn a lesson of the world,” said Snape, shaking his head. “The one thing that all men of power fear is loss of that power. They will do anything to stop it.”
“Leaving the two of you alone together is like watching a first-year Potions class. You never know what’s going to explode out of a cauldron,” said Draco, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“It’s fine, I can take it,” said Harry, feeling a tingling in his fingertips as the emotion he couldn’t control built up inside him. “You already told me once – your kind doesn’t mix with my kind. Working class, orphan, can’t even do magic.”
“Well, first of all, that’s just a preposterous deal to make over a game of golf,” she said, sitting up and collecting herself. “And second, because that’s Oliver Wood right there. He works for the Falcons now, doesn’t he?”
In his tired haze he nearly missed the turn for the lifts, infernal muggle contraptions though they were. Only a few more minutes and he could finally put this day behind him and get some sleep. The problems of following through on the deal with the Collective, establishing a dubious shell company, and investigating someone quite dangerous who was controlling the Ministry would all have to wait till tomorrow.
“This might be it,” said Hermione, tapping the page with satisfaction. “Something that looks like an Obscurus but isn’t. Though childhood abuse…”
“Kreacher has prepared refreshments for Master’s guests,” said Kreacher.
“Speak for yourself, I’m great at blending in as a Muggle,” said Cedric. “Check it out.”
“I’ve been thinking lately about Aunt Andromeda,” he said. “Why were you two never close?”
“I think we’d know by now if someone was on to our normal grocery runs,” said Draco, steering her away from the window, towards the game of chess he and Harry were playing by the fire.
“If you’ve tried to evade your attacker and you’re forced into a confrontation, a quick Disarming spell might be your best chance to avoid an attack,” said Cedric, as he paced in front of the slowly growing number of onlookers to his weekly defence class. “Malfoy, would you care to demonstrate?”
“Lay off her,” said Cedric, stepping between the two and shoving Draco hard in the chest. “You’ve made your point, Malfoy. What more do you want?”
Everything, that is, except the Mark. There were some things that were truly unforgivable.
“I’ve seen it,” said Harry. “I’ve been in his mind when he’s falling apart. Why doesn’t it work?”
“Are you sure you have to go, Harry?” asked Luna, looking up from the latest edition of the
“Thanks, Pans,” he said.
“And what makes you so sure of that?”
“So you’re Harry, then?” she said, looking him up and down. “You must be the one Draco has been spending the entire year with.”
“No, it’s Charlotte,” said Harry, full to bursting with pride for his brilliant friend. “She told me what they’re planning. In the Dr Who movie, the Master attempts to steal the Doctor’s regeneration,”
“Does that mean you’re three years older than us if you’ve lived three times the same year?” asked Luna, gazing thoughtfully off into the distance as she stroked Ivy.
What was she getting at? Best to be careful when discussing women with other women, he thought to himself.
For a split second, Draco considered blowing open the whole thing. This may be the last time he saw his friends without the presence of the brethren. He could spill; tell them everything. He’d grown up with these three, surely his word on the likely fate that awaited them meant something.
“Be that as it may,” said McGonagall, her expression growing tight, “She is well suited to the task. She doesn’t have Head Boy duties to worry about nor Quidditch practice to miss, and may I remind you she’s at the top of your year.”
“Thanks Kreacher,” said Harry, reclaiming the focus of the group. “Alright, once you’re in, Cedric will use the confusion to get close to Umbridge and swap the necklace.”
“That’s too far,” said Draco, leaping to his feet, glaring down the few inches he had on Hermione.
Harry looked over to see Ivy coiled up, her head hovering a few inches as she looked out the dark window. He followed her gaze out to the cold grounds where a crystal clear sky twinkled with stars overhead.
If anyone had asked him a few months ago where he thought he’d be sitting in mid-November of his 17th year, this was the last place he could have possibly imagined. But he felt at ease. The worry over Charlotte was still a constant presence, but this group of people had become an important network for him. And no one outside of their small group even knew that they might very well save the world.
“You take yourself too seriously, mate. You’ll have a heart attack before you’re old enough to take the Mark,” said Blaise in a joking voice, but there was a strange glint to his eye that set Draco on edge. “No point guessing what you’re doing down here, I already know.”
“What. Is it?” insisted the voice.
Harry looked up from the armchair, tossing his book to the side. “You’re back.”
Still. To lose the only person in the world who felt like family was unthinkable for him, even now. He was torn between the release that acceptance of her death would offer, and the firm, stupidly optimistic belief that she had survived. That he could still save her.
Could he have been a relative of Harry’s; someone tasked with watching over him and ensuring he had a good childhood? If so, he’d done a ruddy awful job of it. Perhaps a Ministry official, or just a local Squib who sensed his magical signature. Hopefully not something more sinister, Draco found himself wishing. Potter had been through more than enough.
The woman glanced up with one raised eyebrow. “Ohh dear. What have I done this time?” she asked with a grimace. “It’s the broom, isn’t it? Look, I promise I’ll buy you a new one once my paycheck comes through. It’s just that it was the only thing on hand and I had to do a late run for supplies. How was I supposed to know that it had a flying radius of 100 kilometres?”
“I was just getting to that,” said Hermione and a puff of cool air hit Harry’s eyes.
Draco stared into his own cup of dark, bitter coffee and completely dreaded having to get through this day.
He looked up to see her smiling as she shuffled. “So are you two together?” she asked
The two professors stood near the back wall of the classroom, looking grim. McGonagall’s forehead showed creases of worry, but she quickly adopted a teacherly demeanour and beckoned him over to the desk, taking a seat herself. Snape looked on unflinchingly. His agitation from earlier that morning was gone and his eyes had a glassy quality, perhaps a neutralising potion of some sort.
“Hey, what gives?” he demanded. “You just told me you wanted to be here with me. And I do too – I have feelings for you. Alright? I didn’t even know what to make of them at the start, but now that I know you it’s just – it’s you, you’re what I want out of this whole thing.”
“Luna, if I ever doubt you again, you have my complete permission to stupefy me on the spot,” said Harry, grinning.
He turned back to follow Luna’s bobbing head as she led him down the sloping lawn, over the thick roots of trees into the Forbidden Forest to the Thestral clearing. The strange transparent creatures were quick to find them, as they had been on the first night. And Luna even helped Harry select one to ride and make his way onto its back, even though she wore a forlorn look as she did it.
“We have to help it,” said Char. Her eyes glinted in the low light.
Draco put a hand on the door and pushed it open, spotting Snape’s long black robes slumped over a stone basin. Damn, this was not good. Draco took a few quick steps into the room, sealing the door behind him with an Imperturbable charm.
“So tell us, Father. What’s happened for the Dark Lord to announce his return so soon?” said Draco, reclining in his seat. “I saw the news about Longbottom, but I assumed it was unlikely the second regeneration attempt had more success than the first.”
“That’s the spirit,” said Harry, laying back and placing the diadem on his head. In an instant, he was out.
“Come on, Malfoy. Hit him with spells he knows,” called Cedric.
“You saw Remus?” Harry asked. His pulse quickened—maybe this was his chance, to tell him how Teddy was doing, to ask him what he would have wanted for his only son, to ask him about the letters he’d written to Sirius that he’d found in the attic of Grimmauld place….
He found the Potions Master in his dim office, slowly marking papers and drawing long lines through sections of student work. Snape did not look up as he entered.
“Harry’s magic is strong, remember?” said Hermione as she ran her wand across the edge of the gash and Draco struggled to hide a wince. Harry felt a small hand on his shoulder as Luna hovered by his side.
“I’d like to hear you try explaining this to Hermione. I reckon you’d get an earful about Gamp’s Law,” said Harry, trying to match pace with Luna’s quick steps. “What are you even thinking about to conjure the room, anyway?”
“See there, in the trees?” she asked, pointing with a small hand as she held her wand aloft. Harry squinted, but through the dark brambles it was hard to discern anything. “Hold out the roast.”
,” said Draco, clearing the mist as he entered the room. “Not bad. Better brush up on your counter-spells though.”
“I don’t know,” said Harry, as he kicked his feet into a pair of trainers. “I’m not supposed to be seen I guess.”
Draco rose and followed Tonks into the sitting room where she was pulling on a pair of boots by the front door.
“Oh?” said Draco, wondering how he hadn’t already blown his head off attempting a
“No, you’re right. We’ve got work to do,” he said, turning back towards the desk and spilling out the day’s phials of memories in front of the portrait of the man who made them.
“Don’t ask me. I think you all look ridiculous,” he replied.
“A Thestral,” she began as they walked down the dim hallway. “Is a very rare type of magical creature. Most people live their lives never seeing one because they avoid populated areas, but there’s a tame herd in the Forbidden Forest.”
“If anyone could, it would be her,” said Draco. “She has all the context.”
His hands darted to a dusty box, but he laid it to the side, instead pulling out three remaining boxes to try first. As with the last time, the wands responded unpredictably, but Harry’s
“Luna is a capable witch, she’ll be able to handle herself,” said Cedric. “The only thing we’d accomplish by going back is putting you in harm’s way again.”
“If it’s that bad, we should take him to the hospital wing,” said Harry, looking back and forth between the group. “What is it?”
The arched hallways hummed with magical energy as they wound their way through the castle. The warm sandstone walls caught the dappled light as it shone in through bevelled windows, beyond which lay sprawling grounds still green with the last life of summer. As they passed classrooms Harry could hear recitations of spells and whooshing and bubbling noises that had him momentarily forgetting why he was so quick to want to leave this place.
In a moment of lunacy, Draco thought of suggesting they leave the Room of Requirement and get out of the castle for the afternoon, but he stopped himself before he could say anything stupid. He wasn’t ready for Potter to be discovered just yet, he reminded himself. That was still too important of a card to play.
“Are we sure it’s soul magic?” Luna pushed the glasses up on top of her head, blonde hair tumbling out around her face. “Most soul magic is purely theoretical. Just because Riddle asked doesn’t mean he attempted it.”
“Oh, I know what will improve them!” said Luna, turning her round eyes on Draco, and making him cringe at the mental image of her Transfiguring his buttons into Butterbeer bottle caps or something equally atrocious.
Draco turned around to see a portrait of a bard tuning a lute, wearing what looked to be renaissance-era black and red striped attire, a black hat, and a frilly white collar.
Colour started rising in Cedric’s face, and he grinned. “Incredible.”
Harry knelt down to speak to the house-elf as Hermione and Cedric carried on organising the students. “Thanks, Kreacher, I’m sure everyone will need their strength. Your master will be back before you know it, I promise.”
“I wonder what it’s thinking,” mused Charlotte quietly, as the little snake slithered a little way down Harry’s arm.
He found the old proprietor hunched over a pocket watch of some kind, which was laid out with an assortment of strange instruments on a workbench. He looked up at Draco through thick microscoping glasses, twisting two large dials until his eyes came into focus and his lips parted in a deferential smile.
When he looked up, Hermione and the silver forest behind her were fading away as the diadem’s vision ended.
“Give it a rest, Granger,” said Draco, pointing his wand at Harry’s eyes and saying “
. Cedric and Hermione shared a tight-lipped glance.
Draco paused.
Cedric and Hermione swept through the door into the snowy street and were gone. He should have expected it, but it still hurt. Not that Draco could blame them – he would have done far worse to a traitor in the group if he had been in their shoes.
“And defensive magic has a bit of a learning curve but Diggory is pragmatic, he’ll skip to what you need to know that’s within your capability. Having a handle on your basic magic will help with that as well.”
“Huh,” said Cedric, bemused. “That could be useful.”
“Great, I’m so glad I brought you,” said Harry with an eye roll.
them to win, but Chelsea always does. That time, though, Tottenham drew,” said Harry, enjoying the look of mild annoyance on his tutor’s face. “That was the day I realised it was possible for the little guy to take down the big guy. I started playing football after that. And standing up to my cousin.”
“Missing my friends more like,” said Harry, dropping his arm. “Do I really have to keep practising with the quill?”
“Dying for one, actually. Thanks,” said Harry, taking a big sip.
“That’s right,” said Hermione.
He looked back to change the subject but was surprised to find Potter already staring at him, with a look of something like admiration. Unbidden, Draco felt colour start to rise in his face.
“Even so,” said Hermione, her eyes darting to Harry’s scar. “We don’t know how that happened. You-Know-Who’s true weaknesses were never revealed, and the only wizard he ever really feared is gone.”
“That’s just it,” Hermione bit her lip. “He’s not on a regular run. I asked him to go to Diagon Alley.”
“Mother?” he said, his hand closing around her icy fingers.
Hermione pointed out a dangling sign for Ollivander’s Wand Shop, and the two of them ducked into a narrow dusty space, filled wall to ceiling with familiar slender boxes. Even though the store was completely empty, it radiated a thick feeling of magic.
Snape shut his eyes, laying a pale hand on his temple before answering. “You sound more like your father every day.”
“I have a godfather?” asked Harry, bewildered.
“Lighten up Granger, do you really think we’ll be able to accidentally break a charm cast by Dumbledore?” said Draco, using his height to lean over her. “Besides, we’re on the same team for this.”
Voldemort let out an eerie, high-pitched laugh. “Straight to business, just like your father,” he said, stroking the head of the snake. “No, dear boy, tell me about your life. How are things in your last year at Hogwarts? Come, take a seat. Let us speak as friends.”
“Are you tracking me or something?” asked Harry, looking accusingly at Cedric and Hermione, who seemed to be hiding something from him.
“No, something’s off,” said Draco, shaking his head.
“I saw it attacking Charlotte. It wasn’t touching her but it was like it was draining her somehow,” said Harry, dreading the answer but knowing he had to ask it, anyway. “Did that thing – did it kill her?”
It was all making sense; McGonagall had said his parents had fought against the Dark Lord and fallen. She’d just omitted the part where they had been killed in cold blood for standing up for their beliefs. And the part where Harry was some freak of nature that both sides might want to exploit. It dawned on him that Petunia wasn’t the only one who’d been deceiving him.
As the room completed its rotation, pulsating music could be heard growing louder until they were surrounded by it. Finally, the room came to a stop, and the curtain was pulled open by a woman with porcelain white skin that glimmered in the dim light of the cavernous room beyond.
“I beg your pardon,” said Draco indignantly. “These robes have been hand washed by house-elves.”
“No,” said Harry, his fist tightening defiantly at his side. “That’s not true.”
“I’ve finished my sonnet!” said the bard, hopping towards the foreground of his painting and gesturing grandly as he announced, “
Hermione’s eyes narrowed and he could see the wheels turning as she weighed up the cost benefit analysis of the strange situation.
“The actions I have been directed to take regarding the ring do not involve you, other than to ascertain its condition,” said Draco pointedly.
Whether it was to share something or to peek into Harry’s current mindset, he couldn’t be sure, but it pissed him off that Malfoy would try weaponising something that was so personal to them. He threw up the strongest Occlusion barrier he could muster and tore his eyes away to glare at the door.
“Not on your life, Potter,” said Draco with a smirk.
“B-but Mr Malfoy, these are complicated affairs,” stuttered Greenacre, reaching into his pocket to put on a small pair of spectacles and rifling through the papers on his desk. “I would strongly advise you to get outside counsel on this sort of arrangement. The terms of the deal are quite binding.”
“I don’t know, but I’m sure there’s still loads more for me to learn. Once I can Apparate, it would be easy to split my time and do both.”
“It also proves that Voldemort doesn’t know when someone is tampering with a Horcrux,” said Cedric in a low tone. “The fake locket would have been in the cave for decades before Dumbledore went after it.”
“She thought it was Ravenclaw’s diadem,” said Harry, trying to give any information that might be helpful in a diagnosis. “She put it on for—”
“Right, I think you’re ready,” said Hermione, pretending she was already looking in her bag for the cedar wand. She withdrew it and held it out to Harry, attempting to look confident in the decision. “Tell me about them? Your friends I mean.”
Her head whipped around toward the sleepy cottage behind them, but nothing stirred. Dumbledore must have put up an Imperturbable charm without her noticing. Perhaps he did know what he was doing, after all.
Several weeks had passed since the battle of Wisteria Hall and the night that Harry almost lost Draco for good. Since then they had been all but inseparable, through the Ministry questioning, the various hearings, and
“Right you are,” said Tonks with a big sniff. “She’d be proud to hear you say it. She’s just as much your mum as she is mine, after all.”
A piece of Draco broke inside. The brave face they’d put on for each other for so many years had been his undoing in the end. Pansy wasn’t the Death Eater zealot she’d made herself out to be any more than he was. And she’d been the braver of the two in the end, dropping her mask first because she cared for him more than she feared him.
“Honestly, Muggles have no sense of fashion.” Draco picked up the sleeve of a puffy jacket slung over the back of the desk chair and let it fall.
Harry looked back and forth between an aghast Draco and the content little witch to his left, and said, “I like Luna’s better.”
“Oh, it’s you,” said Harry, a look of scepticism across his face. “Come to help me plan another escape, then?”
“Look, we can figure it out later,” she said, turning back to Draco with a flirtatious look. “But don’t think I’ve forgotten. I want some real alone time before I go... I think it would really help me make my decision.”
“No, I’m not,” said Harry, looking down at his matchstick, which was still very much a matchstick and not at all a needle. “What are you reading, anyway?”
“On anything that’s a matter of taste, Potter,” said Malfoy, turning his eyes back to the textbook. “Now hurry up. I’m skipping a free period for this.”
“Darling, it’s the right bet to make. There will be no stopping him when he has returned to power, he is not a man that makes the same mistakes twice. I am
“Who are you and what have you done with Granger?” said Draco as Hermione pulled her essay out of her school bag.
He had seemed to endear himself to his pupil by taking his side on keeping the wand and accelerating his magical education, but Draco wasn’t sure if he’d made the right call in doing so. For one thing, he still wasn’t sure whether the Dark Lord would want Potter to be trained up in ways that he could protect himself, and the conversation with Snape on that front had turned up fruitless.
Luna’s hand on his shoulder and the damp grass under his palms felt very far away. He tried to stumble to his feet, as Luna’s frail form clutched him from the side, trying to guide him towards the castle.
Harry steeled himself, marched to the door and out into the hall. His hand rested on the handle to Regulus’s door and paused.
But Lily did not move. She stood defiantly, and gazed up into the face of the Dark Lord.
said Ivy’s small voice from near his neck as he hastened to pack away the books that he thought would be most useful when he was on the run.
“McGonagall’s one to watch out for.” Malfoy nodded. “I wouldn’t put it past her to try and exert control over where and when you go. Just stay on her good side. Make it so she doesn’t have any reason to say you’re not ready.”
He knocked harder.
She held the cup out to Cedric, who looked around at the group as he accepted it with two hands. The others waited apprehensively.
said Harry, laying his arm on the desk so Ivy could slither into the sleeve of his jumper.
“Do you know where the diary is?”
“I don’t know anything about my parents,” said Harry, feeling for the first time not ashamed in saying this, but curious to know more. So it was true, they were students here. Somehow even the smallest bits of information about them bolstered Harry to want to learn more. And if it took befriending Malfoy to do it, he was all in.
“What about this one, Godric’s Gimlet,” said Angelica, pointing over Blaise’s arm at the menu. “Do you think it really has phoenix tears in it?”
They were so practised at it now. There was barely a barrier to slipping into Potter’s thoughts.
“I didn’t know anyone had ever managed it successfully before, but now that I think about it, my mother may have been warning me. The only way to complete the spell is to… take a life.”
Draco paused, mulling over what Harry had suggested before disregarding it as Muggle blather. “Like a library. But instead of organising by topic, your memories are organised in a structure that makes sense only to you, based on your classification of the importance of the memory. Did you have something specific in mind?”
“What?” said Draco, perturbed. “It would have been a nightmare if I had to do that. I’ll have you know. Damned Oliver Wood was supposed to be on it with him and had to cancel.”
“Um Harry, it’s getting a bit bright,” said Hermione, squinting at the
“Harry!” she squealed as she jumped up from the armchair to give him a big hug. “So glad you could make it.”
The good news was they had managed a semblance of memory navigation, using the cupboard as home base. He and Potter had walked through the memories of the few items on the shelves, including what turned out to be a Muggle calculating device he won as an award in a school maths competition, which they’d linked to a more recent memory of a Muggle computing class. Draco was bored looking at all the screens, but Harry seemed fascinated by it, and whatever he was doing he wasn’t half bad at it. Draco was just pleased they were chaining memories.
“You have the… scar?” asked her twin.
“What if the Dark Lord hasn’t actually been defeated?” she asked, leaning closer to Dumbledore and finally voicing her real fear. “You said it yourself, you’re not certain he is truly gone. Lily’s sister’s house is the first place he’ll come looking for the boy, blood magic or not. He’ll be defenceless out here with no one but Muggles around him.”
“What?” asked Charlotte, holding his gaze. “Show me.”
“I lived there,” said Harry, green eyes finally meeting Draco’s defiantly. “For about 12 years.”
“Only that you jinxed the daylights out of Lavender Brown last Valentine’s Day,” said Malfoy. “I’m surprised you didn’t make Potter here a ginger.”
“This is a completely different situation,” said Draco. “We were recruited into this group, let me remind you.”
she said.
He pointed his wand at the fireplace and said
“Two children investigating dark wizards in school?” mused Ollivander. “I’ve never heard of such a thing.”
She stopped shuffling and held his gaze with a look of complete composure. Something few people could do effectively, let alone in a fluffy bathrobe. She flipped over a card to show a delicate featured man seated on a throne adorned in grapevines, holding a sceptre of gold. The king of pentacles.
“I would have told you anything if I thought it would stop you going to that school,” she said, opening her left hand to reveal a crumpled and faded envelope of yellow parchment that bore his name in slanted green ink.
“Our Lord continues to grow stronger with each renewed attempt,” said Lucius pointedly. “But you are correct, the
“Wait,” she said, putting a firm hand on his arm, and then pulling back a few inches to look into his eyes. “I like to be in control.”
The boy looked at his outstretched hand and back, and for a split second Draco had the funny feeling that Potter was weighing up what sort of person he thought Draco was. But in a moment he’d accepted the hand in a shake. Perhaps it was just Draco overthinking things. He had, after all, spent the entire time he’d known Potter’s secret thinking about ways to divulge it to the very people who wanted to see him killed.
Draco collapsed into his chair, gazing out the window and feeling the sting of his mark through his jumper sleeve. For all the good his planning had done him, he should have left well enough alone. Now he was just like Sirius; all the tools to win on either side but losing on both.
That was something he’d missed about his sessions with Potter; his depth of Muggle film knowledge was like an archive. Why he had allocated so much space to 1960s era animation and so little to the green flash was a different issue.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realise you’d be back so soon. I feel sorry for Parkinson,” jeered Hermione, casting a few hasty spells in Harry’s direction, which felt like a blast of wind hitting him in the face as she removed the glamours. “The wand fitting obviously took much longer than I’d accounted for. And we didn’t get a match.”
“Luna said you wouldn’t have much time. The diadem is an ancient relic, it’s probably trying to give you some perspective you wouldn’t have gotten in your own timeline. What do you need to know?”
“That one’s good,” said Harry, stepping forward to set up the player, but Draco was already on it, removing the record and setting the needle. So Harry wandered over to the bed to wait for him.
Harry let out a sigh. “For the most part. It was the only piece of the world that really belonged to me, you know? Sometimes I’d go there just to get away. Other times, when I was forced to stay, it was less pleasant.”
“You didn’t,” said Harry, tensing. “They wouldn’t believe you, they haven’t got any idea about magic or any of this.”
Draco froze. He accepted the paper and unfolded it to reveal a detailed map of the castle and grounds. Beads of sweat began to form on his brow.
said Harry with a laugh.
“Great!” she said, bounding away with a satisfied air. “Oh, and if all else fails with my dad, just talk business. He seemed really impressed by that.”
“Surely you might have given me some notice. Even if Dumbledore had requested my participation, there was no immediate need to begin Occlumency lessons.”
He sat on the edge of the bed and looked appreciatively at Harry.
“You better start talking fast because you are about to be Obliviated into the next life unless I start getting some answers. Who are you and what have you done with Harry?” she demanded, her wand tip inches from his face.
“Oh dear. Deceiving an officer of the law. Restrain her, boys.” Umbridge took a few paces to the nearest bookshelf, running her hand lightly across the tomes as the Aurors bound McGonagall to the golden chair.
Narcissa’s eyes fluttered open. “Darling,” she said, attempting to prop herself up.
Draco shrugged. “Many took Dumbledore’s death as quite a shock. McGonagall has been out for much of the year so far on Ministry business. Other than that, it’s frankly been a bit of a bore, knowing that there’s so much more I’ll be able to do once I’m out next year.”
“Right, and you thought you better just mess with it on your own. After what a roaring success that turned out to be on the first one?” demanded Draco, kneeling beside her and ripping his gloves off.
Blaise was following him? He had made himself out to be the picture perfect Death Eater youth, and all this time neither of them really believed it? Draco would have laughed if he didn’t think his lungs would give out with the strain.
He now found himself in a high ceilinged, overly opulent drawing room in the clubhouse, with crackling fireplaces and floor to ceiling arched windows that overlooked an expanse of green. Every surface was covered in either dark wood, polished marble, or books. Though he had spent many hours of his life in rooms of comparable opulence, he was frustrated that for once the air of exclusivity was directed at him.
“Yes, of course,” Hermione perked up audibly. “And I could look into the strange waves of magical energy Harry is exhibiting. Perhaps I could find something to temper it.”
The two of them stood for a few moments longer, and Harry wondered if Draco would break the silence. As he was racing through something to say, Draco turned and headed for the kitchen.
“She’s alright?”
Draco nodded, unsure whether sympathy would do him any good. Harry seemed to have pieced it together already. “He was a noble wizard. He wouldn’t have come looking after just anyone,” said Draco. “How did you guess?”
“‘Just you wait!’ I yelled triumphantly. ‘You haven’t even noticed the incantation I’ve been secretly—’ my stars, Longbottom, are you alright?”
“Pretty good until the end,” said Draco, running a hand through his hair. He took a steadying breath, feeling unexpectedly flustered at the memory, and willed an expression of indifference onto his face. “The trick, of course, will be navigating back to the room. Focus on the directional flow of your memories – when they get too out of hand you lose control.”
