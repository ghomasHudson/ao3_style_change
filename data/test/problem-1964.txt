“Bitch, if you gonna serve us some ballet on the runway, you need more than just flats,” Leslie admonished. “Either put on some toe shoes or wear heels! The way you standing right now, you ain’t got no ass.”
“Why, Dr. Howser, I’m cancelling my Thursday appointment,” RuPaul replied. The judges laughed again.
“Not tonight. Ron and I are on duty. We’ll be scoping the pub on the lookout for any potential sign of trouble,” he explained. “We’re taking any threat against you seriously.”
“Thank you, ladies; we’ve heard enough. While you enjoy a cocktail in the Untucked Lounge, the judges and I will deliberate.”
“You were there when Potter sliced me open and I almost died,” he told her. “You visited me in the hospital wing.”
“That’s Ursa Minor.” Draco pointed up to the top shelf of the storage unit next to his costume rack, where the stuffed koala sat and modeled a long, white-blonde wig.
“He was a champion athlete at school. Now this one says ‘Weasley Is Our King’ — he was another athlete, I guess. But this one is my favorite — the ‘I’ stands for ‘Inquisitorial Squad.’ That was a club I helped start. I like this badge for the clean, elegant lines.”
“Hmm, is there more besides taking the Dark Mark and joining a criminal gang? Attempted murder of your school principal, serious injuries of your classmates, use of two out of three unforgivable curses?” Villareal waved her hand, unimpressed. “We have quite a file on you already in our department, but I’m always up for a good story. Please feel free to share if there’s more we should know.”
That afternoon, the Team Venus queens walked onto the main stage in boy clothes and high heels to learn their choreography.
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco muttered, and handed Intoxia over to Lorena before pushing his way in front of the others. He stood toe-to-toe with the offender, a forty-something man in a ball cap and slovenly tee shirt and jeans, overweight and looking like he wanted to pick on some easy targets so he could feel better about himself.
The morning his sentence ended, Draco left Malfoy Manor before the wedding could take place, and he never returned. Lucius sent a letter to let Draco know in no uncertain terms that he was disowned.
“Planning on it. Any big surprises that you can tell me about? Pansy is running a betting pool on who’s going to win the main challenge.”
Jones took a playing card and appeared to spin it in the air between and around his hands. Draco burst into laughter, his face turning pink.
Goldie took the mirror, looked at herself, and burst into laughter. “GIRL!” she shrieked in between laughs, “Why do I have two sets of eyebrows?!”
“I can’t hot glue this material,” Intoxia held up a length of shiny, bulky teal fabric in frustration. “I should probably try to hand sew it. It’s too big for the machine,” he whined.
“Acacia Davenport, you are one fierce queen. And I know your career is really going to cook after this.” Acacia nodded stiffly. “Now, sashay away.”
“That’s our little secret.” Aunt Aura swished her skirts dramatically. “Besides, it's been ages since she passed. She’s moved on, and so should you.”
“Lorena Gucci,” RuPaul continued, “I know this didn’t turn out the way you had planned. But I hope it makes you an even fiercer queen. Because your time here,” she paused for dramatic effect, “is not over.”
“I’ll thank you not to take my soon-to-be-ex-husband too seriously, Draco,” Pansy said, appearing from seemingly out of nowhere with a saccharine grin and a shock of blonde hair. She, too, looked like she had been using the same anti-wrinkle potions as Zabini, though her outfit was more age appropriate. Draco was horrified to look down and see that she was wearing
“Listen,” RuPaul said, “It has to be something that speaks to every American. It has to be really direct. I’m gonna let you get back to work, okay? Thanks, Draco.”
Draco held up the white fabric, which was now cut into a smaller rectangle. “I was thinking I could make this into something with a Greco-Roman motif,” he answered.
well, for all Draco had come to respect the technological advancements and artistry accomplished by those without magic, old prejudices were hard to snuff out completely.
“Everyone else has already been picked up and taken to the hotel already, so you’re our last pickup,” he explained as he opened a side door and motioned for Draco to go in and sit on one of the oddly shaped chairs.
because she shows a lot of body, and I thought I would only have to say ‘Multipass!’ once or twice. But then I got the script, and it’s like she’s speaking a kind of made-up language, and I just thought, ‘Fuck,’” Venus explained to the judges in her defense, beaded fringe shaking all over her studded purple leotard as she gestured nervously.
Halfway down the runway, Draco tore off the burqa to reveal a minuscule string bikini with an iridescent opal sheen. She wore matching stiletto heels and long, curly blonde hair that fell loosely down her shoulders, but the most striking element of this look was that she had painted her skin from head to toe a bright, deep shade of fuchsia.
Lady Cakes, Goldie, Steve, Venus, Kali, Paris, Acacia, Lorena, and Intoxia all stood in the hallway, grinning.
Paris shook his head. “Well, this is a hot mess,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Acacia’s confused, Martha Stewart’s confused, Michelle’s confused...honey, we’re
“Let’s move on to the next part of the choreography,” Todric continued, “The pole-dancing solo numbers.” He gestured towards a pole by the back of the stage.
“No, I am!” Teddy chirped. He blinked and converted his hair into short, red curls. “Draco’s planning a big show and I get to be one of the acts!”
“For this week’s mini challenge, we’re going to play a game. Oh, Pit Crew!” RuPaul called out. Half a dozen muscular men in skimpy underpants walked into the room and lined up against the wall opposite the queens. The queens preened and looked excited.
“Don’t worry, we split up on good terms. We both wanted different things, and we were too young when we got married to figure it out.”
“Well, just keep in mind that we’re expecting to see something couture,” he replied. “You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t a fierce queen. I’ll leave you to it.” And with that, RuPaul walked over to Venus Flygirl and began asking him questions about the fabric on his dress form.
Draco was returning to green room backstage when the person in the hooded cloak who had sat alone in a corner at each viewing party suddenly appeared. The figure approached her and pulled the hood back.
Draco stood in front of the microphone, resting a hand gently on top of the device, and began again. “Greetings! Tha—”
Harry snorted and wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulder and squeezed. The audience at the Bent Unicorn cheered.
“Sweet Merlin,” Harry shook his head. Greg Goyle, Blaize Zabini, and Theo Nott — Draco’s surviving Slytherin dorm mates — had all turned to Draco and glared. Pansy and the other girls were beside themselves with laughter.
Draco held up a hand. “Not to worry,” he said gently, hoping to have a calming effect on the other queen. He moved forward and untied the letter from the owl’s leg.
“You know something weird?” Steve turned in his seat so he could grin at the others. “There was an owl outside the studio tonight!”
“Calm myself,” Draco hissed back. “Do you think it was easy to live up to the expectations of my name? Do you have any idea what I’ve had to
He finally located the section with seventh-year Charms books and grabbed one off the shelf only to see the face of Harry Potter looking back at him.
The audience cheered. Draco grinned. Maybe she had more on her side in the wizarding world than she thought.
Harry looked up at the ceiling, trying to picture the inside of his vault. “I think there are about thirteen or fourteen piles,” he answered.
Once an author publishes a work, it belongs to everyone. I really see the heart of that sentiment in fanfiction. Harry Potter fanfiction especially has a rich collection of trans- and queer-positive stories that take Rowling’s universe above and beyond anything she has created. It’s helped a lot of people explore social issues in ways that they might not find in traditional fiction. And, it’s allowed me to share my vision of Draco finding an outlet for personal expression in makeup and heels. No matter what she tweets, she can’t take that away from us. Trans lives matter. Black lives matter. We can -- and we will -- do better.
Goldie-as-George-Takei waved. “Thank you! I would like to remind everybody that it is okay to be Takei!”
fuck it up,” RuPaul told them. Draco and Acacia shot looks at each other as they shook out their nerves before
“Let’s move on. This question is for Jason,” RuPaul continued. “The city of San Francisco is so gay,” RuPaul said, “Instead of flags, they hang
Paris, Venus, and Goldie had chosen similarly conservative looks, donning suits and subdued wigs. Kali was wearing an orange sari. Lorena had opted instead for a hot pink ball gown with cone shoulders and an ice-blue hair loaf. Lady Cakes had donned a dowdy floral dress with a beige cardigan, oversized eyeglasses, and grey hair pulled into a bun.
“I’m Goldie Hanako,” she added, holding out her hand before Draco could answer. Draco took it and they shook hands so gently it felt more like a limp hand-holding.
“Araneus,” Draco said to the spider in his most serious voice, “Your performance in the maxi challenge had us all caught in your web. However, your look on the runway was just...threadbare. I’m sorry, my dear, but this is not your time. Now, sashay away.” With that, he gently eased the spider into the jar proffered by the assistant, who carried it away.
Sticking out from the hem of her dress was the wand attached to her thigh with a holster which was charmed to make itself and the wand invisible to muggles. Similarly hidden was the Dark Mark on her left forearm, which had faded to an ashy grey after the war. A glamour charm luckily covered the rest of it — to muggles, anyway.
Steve looked up at her and sniffled. “Just peachy,” she muttered. “I’m probably going home tonight.”
Draco shrugged. “It’s not that type of spider,” he answered, and inspected the arthropod more closely. Never had he connected with a spider the way he did in that moment — shunned by people who reacted out of fear more than understanding.
But she would have been kidding herself if she thought that she was immune to the lure of the competition. Prior to this week, she didn’t feel the need to win, but she definitely didn’t want to
Malfoy towered above him, all long legs and slender torso, his white-blond hair styled immaculately in a short cut that flattered his face. His eyes widened in surprise when he saw Harry, but he masked the emotion quickly behind a cool, impassive demeanor.
“I can tell Lorena is still feeling a certain type of way,” Kali Sister commented. “After that last challenge, she knows she’s struggling, so she wants to see some of the other girls come down a peg.”
Lady Cakes held up her Draco puppet. Draco cringed to see that Lady Cakes had dressed it in a white rectangular scrap of fabric and a wonky eyelash. “Lady Cakes, do be sure to fasten your chair strap when we ride in the artmobile! Hash fag, safety first, ta!”
“Sure,” Harry grinned, “And maybe a lipstick table to go with it. But you were going to tell me a story. No more sidetracks.”
“So? You don’t have to know about it for it to be real. It’s not like everyone has to be familiar with your bumpy-foreheaded bint to get that you’re dressed like some kind of character.” Draco waved a hand in Intoxia’s general direction.
He picked a tiny ball of pink lint off the table and gently placed it on Araneus’ head. Proportionally, it resembled a spider-sized pink afro wig. He held the spider up to the other queens, who were timidly watching the scene.
“Intoxia Madison, you are a queen with many talents. But this is not your time to shine. Now, sashay away.” Intoxia smiled and blew kisses to the judges and other queens as she sashayed offstage.
“No, we’re not looking for Wes right now,” RuPaul said. “We’re looking for Amelia Earhart. Has anyone seen her?!”
Lady Cakes turned around and fixed a look at Draco, who sat quietly in the back seat and pretended to pick a speck of link off his shirt.
“'Love you all, no hard feelings!’” Draco read aloud, “‘And watch out for those banana peels!’ Indeed,” she snorted.
The camera ended the interview and panned back to the werkroom, where an excited look flashed over Draco’s eyes. “Will we ever win badges as prizes on this show?” he asked RuPaul.
for the Malfoy name?” His fingers gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white. He had brought this on himself. If he hadn’t insisted on using his real name to flaunt his drag in front of Lucius, he wouldn’t be in this position now.
Two men rolled a large screen into the Untucked lounge. Draco didn’t look up. She had seen enough Untucked episodes from previous seasons to get the gist that these moments were usually about some queen’s mother or boyfriend leaving a message to let her know how loved she was. Draco sighed, not really feeling in any sort of mood to support some other queen getting this type of love. Her own life was too complicated for that now.
Before too long, RuPaul announced that they only had a minute left. Goldie yelped and quadrupled his speed. Draco tried hard not to flinch.
Kali looked to RuPaul, though he was remaining uncharacteristically stoic throughout the debate. Michelle, on the other hand, pursed her lips to hide a smile.
“I was up in the Headmaster’s office talking to some portraits. Then I thought I’d swing by and say hello to Myrtle, but now maybe I’ll spare myself the humiliation. I’d rather talk to you anyway, Malfoy.” Potter smiled. Draco felt something wobble in his stomach.
Once relieved of its task, the owl flew towards Lady Cakes, who was still holding the door open. Lady Cakes screamed and ducked. The owl flew over his head, out the door, and down the hall.
Draco nodded. He had a sudden feeling that things could go completely sideways. Maybe it was the reminder that the room might not be usable. Or maybe it was because he was siding
“I love you, too,” Harry said, full of adoration. He reached a hand up to pull a lock of her wig away from her face and cupped her cheek. She smiled shyly back at him. Draco had never been easy with displaying emotions, especially in such a public venue. It was somehow easier to hide it behind a performance.
He appeared in San Adra, a small wizarding island off the coast of Los Angeles. The muggles considered it part of Channel Islands National Park — uninhabited and incapable of supporting life. For that reason it was protected from muggle real estate developers and any other muggle in a boat looking for a quiet island to explore. Of course, that was by design. A few charms around the island’s coastline helped discourage anyone from approaching or even getting close enough to see anything interesting on the island.
Draco furrowed her brows. Muggles cooked all the time. Did they not use that word? Was it a British versus American term situation?
“Tell me, is this going to be your Wonder of the World look?” He gestured toward the dress Draco was pinning to his dress form.
Goyle picked up the candle and grinned up at Crabbe. “Guess we can’t get rid of you that easily,” he said. “I would have really missed our literary discussions if you were gone for good.”
“I’m not sure what I was thinking, taking on this part,” Venus muttered. “It’s one thing to just say a long line of bullshit, but it’s another thing to have to remember when someone else says it! I thought I’d only have to say ‘Multipass’!”
One by one, the queens were tutored in the art of pole dancing and took turns practicing their lip sync solos along with the pole choreography. Once Draco got past the initial weirdness of the concept, the multitasking came easier after a few practice runs.
Draco and Potter looked at each other awkwardly for a moment before Draco looked away. He walked over to the window for the sake of a reprieve from Potter’s intense gaze and looked out upon the dark Hogwarts grounds instead.
” Blaise looked pointedly at Draco— “put on a show for him now and then. Honestly, it’s like you were trying to be seen, keeping your bed curtains open—”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Or something,” he replied. He was something of an expert at sun protection charms, especially since arriving in Southern California. The sun here felt much more intense than it had ever felt in England.
“I know, right?” Goldie was busy styling an already full-bodied, candy-apple red wig into a low braid. “I mean, I
“Well now, that was exciting,” Goldie smirked. “So, Draco, tell us for real. Did you make up this Ethel character?” She gestured at Draco’s oversized doll dress.
Goyle only laughed. “Are you kidding me? You know I was never that good at magic. Besides, that sounds more like something
“Condragulations, ladies!” RuPaul told the thirteen remaining queens. “Now, remember: if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell can you love anyone else? Can I get an ‘Amen’?!”
Goyle just shook his head and rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, I get it. It’s not for everyone. But if you’re sticking around for a while, maybe don’t be a stranger!”
“Ivana, come here, girl,” Paris said. Ivana smiled and patted Draco on the shoulder before joining Paris’ team.
Kali laughed as she wiped away the message. “Girl, don’t say that! We don’t need any more bitches coming back this season!”
Paris struggled at the beginning of her number to recover some of the energy after Venus left, but she picked up momentum as she told the audience about outlandish ways that queens in drag pageants tried to sabotage one another.
Kali Sister raised her arms over her head in victory. “I’m still amazed that I finally won something!” The other queens cheered.
“So what if you can’t sew? You were obviously brought here because you have other strengths. You’re one of the fishiest queens I’ve ever met, for one,” she pointed out. True, Draco had only ever met fourteen queens, but of those, Steve was definitely one of the fishiest.
“That’s one hell of a tuck,” special guest judge Reese Witherspoon commented. “How in the world did she hide that so well?”
“It just looked so normal,” Harry added, laughing. “I expected you to be the type with silk sheets and 300-year-old furniture at the least.”
“I would give myself one hour to make an outfit,” Draco explained. “Sometimes my boyfriend would bring home some random material for me to work with. I dare say it taught me a fair bit about sewing,” she added.
“Say, are you planning to go to the reunion for our Eighth-Year class next Saturday?” Potter asked, effectively ruining Draco’s plan by changing the conversation.
“Ugh, that was too much!” Kali Sister sighed, wasting no time before stripping off her wig and heels and collapsing on the sofa in the workroom.
“Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync...for your
Potter must have picked up on Draco’s dismay, because he chuckled. “Be glad it’s just his hair. James started collecting tattoos as soon as he turned seventeen. Those will be harder to change when he gets sick of them.”
After what felt like an eternity in rehearsal, the queens hobbled back towards the werkroom on sore feet. They entered the room to see a flurry of action as two queens on Team Paris fussed over a gold bikini.
“‘I LUV TACOS LOL,’” Harry read aloud. “There’s another post that just has a question mark,” he said. “Here’s one that’s an ad for shoes. Merlin’s beard, this is just a stream of meaningless junk! How is anyone supposed to make any sense of it?”
Lady Cakes nodded. “They’re both sprained,” he answered. “He gave me some painkillers and ice packs, but now I just gotta try not to use my hands or wrists for the next few days.” He laughed bitterly.
The man laughed. “You were allowed up to five!” He walked up to the back of a white vehicle that looked like a smaller version of the Knight Bus, then opened a door and put Draco’s luggage in the back.
The three flipped through their notepads nervously. “We’re sort of exploring a few ideas,” Paris answered.
“You should go! I bet you haven’t seen any of our old chums in years. Don’t you wonder what everyone’s been up to lately?”
“Kali’s dancing so hard, the stage looks like someone blew up a Hot Topic in the middle of Buttfuck, Iowa,” Venus narrated.
Lorena picked up a drumstick from the platter and proceeded to fellate it in the most obscene way possible.
On the ride back to the hotel, Draco reflected on the pained look on Lady Cakes’ face. It wasn’t like he’d never sprained anything before, like the other queen had thought. But every time, it only took a simple potion to heal it in a matter of minutes. He couldn’t imagine being stuck with an injury like that for days on end, let alone during a competition like
“For your final look, I want you to truly take us on a journey by designing a glamorous couture frock inspired one of the Wonders of the World. Gentlemen, start your cruise ship engines, and may the best woman...
Draco was reading on the sofa at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place when a silver panther patronus burst through the wall and sat down on the coffee table in front of him. It rolled its eyes before speaking in Dean Thomas’ voice.
“You’re going to show me how well you can see into the future as psychic operators for my new hotline, Divining Divas.”
The father-son duo stepped into Flourish and Blotts to pick up textbooks. The place was a madhouse. Draco already felt overwhelmed at the number of people he wanted to avoid. Scorpius looked up and waved.
“Hey Draco, can I talk to you for a sec?” Kali asked quietly as they stood in the hotel lobby, waiting for their ride to the studio.
“My name is Mesmer Jones, and I’m a magician and a mentalist from Las Vegas. RuPaul invited me here to teach you all some magic.” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Now! This week, we’re going to have a ball — and it’s Queens! Queens! Queens across the world!” RuPaul announced. The queens all cheered.
“Okay, let’s just start writing down some dialogue and see if it gels into anything,” Goldie said, sounding just as rattled as Draco felt.
“Venus Flygirl, Steve Donovan, and Intoxia Madison, you three will sell RuPaul’s Tuck Tape.” He picked up a roll of pink tape covered in pictures of herself from the next tray. “Just what every queen needs to turn a man into a
“She thinks it’s her show and she can do whatever the bloody tit she wants with it,” Draco rolled her eyes, “And she’s right.”
“Love you too, Steve,” Lady Cakes McMansion sighed as she sprayed the mirror and wiped at the lipstick. “Damn, this shit really don’t come off easy, does it?”
“Baker! You have five minutes left!” Draco hollered into a thick cloud of flour that had overtaken the kitchen.
When it was her turn, Draco was directed to a corner of the workroom where a small table had been laid out with a crystal ball, a deck of tarot cards, a few decorative odds and ends, and what Draco assumed had to be the phone. She had seen phones before; they were slender rectangles. This was nothing like it at all, a lumpy pink sculpture with a tightly wound cord attached at two points. She could barely make out the profile of someone sitting behind a partition screen.
Harry looked up. “Only seventy-five galleons? Wilford Woodletter charged me just as much for a short to-do list.”
The next morning, Draco thought the production assistant who was taping a wire mic onto him looked familiar.
The runway theme that week was 1940s Pinup Models. Most queens wore swimsuits, short shorts, or negligees with wigs styled in shoulder-length starlet curls.
He rolled over and sighed up at the ceiling. This truly was a terrible time for his libido to decide that it had a thing for Malfoy again.
Draco was completely embracing muggle culture. This was part of the newly metamorphosed Drag Queen Draco Malfoy. If muggles loved their rectangles enough to spend so much time looking at them, surely they could love looking at Draco, too, right? Maybe if she believed it hard enough, it would be true.
Lady Cakes had quickly become a friend, mother hen, and mentor. Draco had also warmed up to Goldie as someone who expressed empathy and joy so freely. Venus, likewise, had become someone Draco enjoyed spending time with. Kali, despite that rocky coming-out moment during the Ball challenge, was becoming someone Draco could share knowing glances with as someone who shared his secret. Even Steve — sweet, dumb Steve, sometimes reminded him of Crabbe in terms of mental faculties and disposition (if not in looks, thankfully).
Draco did the most mature thing she could think of at the moment and stuck out her tongue at the ginger.
“Remember, you’re in the running for America’s next drag superstar,” Michelle chided. “You’re beautiful, but we also want to know that you can think on your feet.” Draco nodded solemnly.
Trigger warning for Lucius Malfoy being homophobic / transphobic / Lucius Malfoy. If that’s not what you’re here for, then skip the scene just after the one with Harry’s patronus and scroll ahead to the scene after it, or Control + F / Command + F to “Yeah, the owls are a problem.”
Draco was relieved to not have been picked last this time around. Steve picked her right away, followed by Goldie, Paris, and Acacia.
A few queens snickered. Lady Cakes raised a shaky fist and finished, ”Vote for Ol’ Lady Cakes, and Imma take a switch to Washington and give those whippersnappers a piece of my mind.”
She changed into an iridescent green dragonhide bodysuit, a large pink feather boa, and black thigh-high boots. Her wig was a shoulder-length mass of wavy curls.
“The fish are a bunch of pervs,” Draco muttered. She could hear some confused chuckles from the audience.
“Oh! Well,” Draco slipped out of her Trelawney voice as she contemplated this request, her accent growing rougher. “What kind of ghost would you like? Ancient Roman soldier, creepy child, or maybe a Victorian whore suit your fancy?”
Harry looked back down at Draco’s unlocked phone, then frowned. “Which one of these is Titter again?”
“Okay, Kali is Tank Girl,” Venus nodded. “Lady Cakes, Carmelita, do either of you want dibs on Deloris Van Cartier?”
The rest of the queens seemed to have forgotten Draco as they gushed over the new girl, who was apparently a big name in the Los Angeles drag scene. Another queen might have felt slighted, but Draco was relieved to lose attention from the previous line of questioning.
“Oh, you know, I’m going to keep writing songs, but instead of writing about ex-boyfriends, all of my songs will be about my cats.” She giggled.
Lady Cakes gripped the podium and shook slightly, affecting an arthritic look. “I’m old as dirt, so I’ve seen a lot of ugly, ugly people in my day. And you know what? I’m at peace with that.”
don’t know you’re using magic to keep your wig on and your junk tucked, it’s not a crime. It might be cheating, in my opinion—”
RuPaul laughed. “Okay, Mary. How did you answer the question? Those sexy Kardashian sisters are starring in a new sci-fi epic, called Star
“So Draco comes back from her photo shoot, covered in chocolate frosting, her wig half off, one eyelash completely gone,” Lady Cakes McMansion laughed. “Girl, she look like she got hit by a cakenado! Ohh, HURRICAKE!!!”
“Vince was a very supportive friend while I was working on my degrees,” Goyle said. “Once I set him up in a room with audiobooks, we found we both liked to discuss classics of the English canon. Though I’m more into Shakespeare and he’s clearly a Dickens man. We almost came to blows once over
“What with the way you have with animals, I thought you’d go for Danaerys or some kind of Disney Princess of the Damned,” Lady Cakes said.
Mariah laughed. “Oh, sweetie, you’re going to have to stay connected from now on. Haven’t you realized that you’re
“Welcome, Racers!” RuPaul greeted them cheerfully through the screen, wearing a black top with a low neckline and frizzy honey-blonde hair. “Can you dance like a she-ro, or do you just like going down on a pole?” The queens shot each other puzzled looks. “Are you a pretty woman, or just pretty in pink? This week, we’re going to find out which queens are a real sister act, and which of you are just plain
Draco frowned thoughtfully. Dismembering an animal wasn’t anything he had in mind when he wanted to be on
“Bugger!” He threw the brush at the mirror. He was still too upset to even keep his exclamations drag relevant.
She reached out to Lorena and the two of them grabbed at each other in an imitation of a sloppy lesbian porn scene — within the limits of American censorship, of course. Draco grabbed the chicken platter before they fell on each other on the floor.
“STUDENTS WILL RAISE THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY SPEAK IN MY CLASS!” she continued, then giggled girlishly. “You are all here to learn about muggle culture in a safe, risk-free environment,” she cooed. “Now, we shall all sit back and observe this lesson with passive decorum, or I shall begin assigning detention.”
? Sad, my ass! Does she think we forgot how she read Steve for filth in Untucked just a little while ago?”
“Now, for your maxi challenge this week, we’re going to play a different kind of game,” RuPaul continued. “Wait for it… wait for it… SNATCH GAME!”
“Maybe Neville would know an accountant who could help you?” Ron rubbed his sore arm. “He’s taken over managing things at home for his gran. You should try asking him.”
“Now, it’s important to stir the mixture counterclockwise for exactly thirteen rotations,” Draco continued. “And then you can add your grated smurf. Now, fresh smurf is best, but dried will do if you add another centilitre of water—”
!” Leslie Jones looked like she was about to have an aneurism. The judges applauded. The queens in the back raised hands in tribute.
you even here, anyway? You don’t even perform, so it’s not like this is your career or anything.” Acacia asked.
“Don’t mention it,” he answered quietly as Lady Cakes pulled away and wiped a tear from his face. “Literally, actually. I’d appreciate if you didn’t tell people about it.”
At that, Draco really did scowl. He chewed and swallowed out of spite, glaring at Potter the entire time.
Venus executed a very impressive backflip to avoid a ball. RuPaul’s jaw dropped. The queens cheered. Then another ball ricocheted off the back wall and hit her in the back of the head with a sad “
“I think we’ve found the last remaining queen in the entire world who had no idea how microphones work.”
“Welcome to Draco’s kitchen!” she spoke to the camera. “Today, I’m going to show you how to make a basic hangover potion.”
“I do! She really came through tonight, and I finally feel like I know who she is now,” Michelle explained.
“Once I saw how the other girls were wearing lots of jewels, I did switch to some sparklier jewelry.” She pointed at her diamond choker and earrings.
convention to get my hands on this prosthetic forehead! I paid four thousand dollars for that alone. I should be in the top this week because I’m giving them Kim Cardassian realness!”
Then he blinked as a light bulb metaphorically appeared over his head. “Wait, is that what she thinks
Draco was trying not to notice Rita Skeeter among the audience, however, not sure she was ready for one of Skeeter’s style of newspaper write-ups. Looking at the reporter across the room, Draco noticed a hooded figure sitting nearby at a table in a far corner. Something about the figure reminded Draco of someone, even though the person’s face was invisible and Draco couldn’t put her finger on what seemed so familiar about them.
“I actually liked the ‘slag flag’ concept,” Kumail added. “Did she have a great outfit? No, but she can think creatively to try and bullshit her way past it, and that has to count for something, right?”
. As popular as your little parties have been, your critics’ voices are starting to get louder. Seems like you could do with another drag performer to take some of the attention off of you.” She smirked.
Harry scrambled for a quill and parchment, ready to jot down a name and floo address. Just as his fingers found the quill in his pocket, it leaped out and skittered across the floor under the adjacent chair. Harry ducked onto his hands and knees to reach for it.
“For the love of Ru, it’s Courtney Act!” Draco exclaimed, overcut by footage of Draco and Courtney squealing and embracing each other in a delicate hug borne of drag etiquette.
“Hmm, sorry, not a match. Let’s turn now to Mary Berry. Are you all right, there, Mary?” RuPaul asked as Draco swayed in her seat, sloshing her giant glass of chardonnay. The contents had dropped considerably since the start of the game.
“It’s okay, you can spit it out if you don’t like it,” he said. “At least you tried it. It was worth it just to see your face.”
“Really!” Kali now turned to smirk at Draco. Draco was taken aback when the other queen winked at him.
“Goldie Hanako,” RuPaul began, “chanté, you stay. You may join the other girls.” Goldie nodded in desperate gratitude. She hugged a despondent Lorena before walking back.
Who’s watching Drag Race UK? I’m trying not to let it influence this work, since I started working on it long before I heard of the show. But I’m watching it anyway, because Drag Race UK. What are your thoughts on the show? Got any favorites? With more British queens, Draco’s got more competition for Snatch Game characters. It’s not like he knows that many famous muggles… :-D
Here’s a short article on the mask designs for the movies. They’re really beautiful with a lot of subtle details, though it’s difficult to see them for very long in the movies themselves. (And I might have enjoyed playing on the idea of why the masks changed between fourth and fifth year… :-) https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/death-eater-masks-and-costumes
“And that she wasn’t sure if it would have been worth all the trouble for him, until he came in a week later with a shit-eating grin and that giant bouquet.”
?!” Draco cried as he continued to pace. “We don’t know the full extent of what muggles can do with this technology! What if the flames start shooting out of the phone? There are too many
!” RuPaul enthused. His smile slipped as he fixed Draco with a serious expression. “Tell me, what are you going to do to make her
She nudged Harry and pointed toward the other person just as the commercial break ended. Harry looked over and nodded. Draco could always trust Harry’s Auror senses to pick up on any potential threat. There was definitely an advantage to having the Saviour of the Wizarding World as a boyfriend.
He could feel the change. Bones lengthened; skin split; muscles stretched to accommodate new limbs. Fabric extended to cover the new appendages. He was close, and getting closer, when suddenly Blaise Zabini unceremoniously walked into the room, holding a newspaper.
“Ta,” Draco said. She perched on the edge of the couch in her 1940s pinup ballerina outfit. Lorena frowned.
, and now we have hot, sexy manmeat and balls flying all over the place.” He laughed. “How are we supposed to concentrate on the rubber balls again?”
“So, hangover potions and cauldrons.” She shot him a pointed look, maintaining an otherwise nonchalant pose as she flew alongside him.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called as he reentered the werkroom. “Now, we’ve taken a look at all of your photo shoots, and the winner of the mini challenge is...Lorena Gucci!”
The Voynich manuscript that Draco mentioned is a real medieval manuscript that people are still trying to decode and make sense of, and it’s every bit as WTAF as it sounds. If you’re interested in falling down that rabbit hole: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript
Venus pondered this issue. “Hmm, Lady Cakes.” Lady Cakes placed a hand on his chest and mock curtsied.
PSA: Bubblegum snow corn snakes are pretty. http://www.allaboutcornsnakes.com/cs_bubblegum_snow.html
“HI, RU!” Lady-Cakes-as-Nicole-Byer chirped loudly. Next to her, Draco jumped in her seat, not expecting the extra volume.
“I must have been watching all the wrong movies.” Actually, the only movie Draco had ever seen was something Harry had taken him to. It had been loud with a lot of fast-moving vehicles and explosions.
“That was an option?” Draco sputtered in disbelief. “I really don’t have hardly any experience cooking. Certainly not enough to teach someone else.”
The wizard took it, inspected something on the bottom, and gave it back to him, saying, “International arrivals for non-US citizens in that line over there.” He pointed at a long line toward the far right of the room. “Be sure to have your passport, portkey, and luggage ready for customs inspection.”
“Ohh!” Lorena whined. “I want some!” She took the chicken platter from Draco. “I laaaahve this chicken!”
.” Lady Cakes held her by the shoulders. “You can do this. Just make some shit up. Think of Beyoncé like a blank slate and just do something totally outside the box. And if that fails, we gonna pray.”
“Draco, I know this reading challenge is going to be a struggle for you because it goes against British manners, so let me help you,” Lorena said, then switched to a high-pitched British accent before continuing, “Lorena, I couldn’t possibly read you!”
. They referenced everything. It was at times overwhelming for Draco to stay afloat in conversation and the challenges without knowing the tiniest fraction of what they were talking about. If nothing else, he kept adding to his notebook of movies, television programmes, and songs to acquaint himself with after he returned home — and improved his skills in pretending to follow along.
“It’s not like they believed me,” Draco said, defending herself. “See?” She gestured towards the screen as the rest of the judging scene unfolded.
“I’ve brought my good friend, United States Senator Elizabeth Warren here today! She’s going to help give you some pointers for the Frock the Vote debate,” RuPaul continued. The queens cheered.
“It’s about talking to the audience,” Goldie explained. “You need to talk to the camera and give instructions so people who watch the show know how to make your recipe."
Draco Malfoy, pureblood descendant of a long line of proud pureblood wizards, had been treated with anything less than the utmost respect —
This week: The queens get ready to impersonate movie characters in an epic lip-syncing, pole-dancing Rusical! How will Draco get along in a group challenge?
“And my look is also demonstrating what would happen if I didn’t cover up. Consider this a public service announcement for my pale brethren,” Draco continued. “Don’t neglect your skin!”
. The whole piece was so heavy she had had to cast a lightening charm on it just to lift her head up. They slithered around her head in shades of pink and pale green, fanning out in every direction and cascading down her shoulders and torso over a nude illusion, never stopping their movement — except in the muggle photo. Muggles would only see a very realistic-looking imitation.
“Madame Inkwell wrote in to tell about the one time she’d had a customer come in and ask for a snake on his cock, because he was dating a Parselmouth,” Harry continued, then grinned at Draco. “She said you cried like a baby, even after taking three pain-numbing potions--”
“All right,” Harry told Draco and Millicent once they were backstage in the green room. “I suppose I can live with knowing you’re using me as some sort of theme for your drag show...
The only problem was that she was already standing and talking with Weasley — who still gave him dirty looks — and Potter — whom Draco could barely glance at without remembering how he had made an arse of himself mere minutes previously.
“Morning, Children,” Lady Cakes sang as the queens boarded their ride to the studio. “Any more owl sightings?”
“Yes, notes. For things I want to look up later.” Draco jotted down a few words and looked back at Lady Cakes. By now they had caught the attention of the other three queens.
“Chin up,” Draco said, “We’ll watch the episode together tomorrow. Then you and I can plan a performance that you can be in, too.”
“It’s down to eleven of us this week, and we each have to come up with three looks on the runway,” Goldie summarized. The camera switched to show the werkroom while Goldie narrated a voice-over.
“For this week’s mini challenge, you’re all going to be models!” RuPaul told them. The queens cheered. “Produce section models, that is.” A few queens shot him saucy looks.
“Okay,” Paris agreed. “Which sorority? We need to come up with one that doesn’t already exist, or else we’ll get a bunch of Beckys coming after us when the show airs.”
“Draco looks cute as a boy!” Intoxia Madison exclaimed. “I wonder if he’d notice if I just snuck up behind him and licked his neck…”
“It was Harry’s 54th birthday,” Draco began the story for his grandchildren, “and I thought I’d treat him to some Gryffindor-style sex for a change.”
“I’m helping a lot of the other girls in the werkroom. I don’t know why, when I should probably be cutting their bra straps instead,” Ivana laughed. The camera switched back to the werkroom, where Ivana was showing a nervous-looking Draco how to operate a sautering iron.
been groomed for Ministry politics from an early age. But what with the war and his coming out on the losing side of it, all those plans for career success had failed. He hadn’t even made the
don’t have the numbers backwards,” he said slowly in a soft voice that made Harry shiver involuntarily. “But I’m beginning to understand how you could fail Potions so badly.”
“Welcome back, Ladies. I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul began after the queens reassembled at the front of the stage. “Lorena Gucci, you are safe.” Lorena nodded her thanks and retreated to the back.
Potter leapt up and approached them at the table, followed by Weasley, enthusiasm written on their faces.
Draco wished the judges would bloody well hurry up with judging the unsafe queens so they would come back and distract the room from Draco’s muggle studies notes.
mad!” Michelle retorted. “Look, it’s been three weeks, and you’ve given us the same shape every time you come out here. I’m starting to get bored.”
Potter held up his teacup. “To Professor Binns — may he take that train ride to his favorite destination.”
Draco could sense what was coming next. His inner Slytherin detector was beeping madly in the back of his mind.
And with that, the screen switched off. Draco was practically vibrating. She barely registered that a few tears had slipped past her eyes.
“Very well,” Harry’s Slytherin accountant finally sighed, “You should be able to write to the Ministry and Gringotts and request replacement forms. Now, I’m going to go out on a limb and assume you’ve been burning your monthly bank statements as well.”
Lady Cakes laughed and shook his head. “Whatever! Just let me know when they start probing people. I wanna be around for that.”
“Wait,” Harry said, clinging to a faint memory. He did remember getting more than the usual number of letters on lavender-colored paper in February, but--- “Were they also lavender-scented?”
“You’d be about the right age for it, since you stayed back for an ‘eighth year,’” Aunt Aura looked thoughtful, then barked a laugh. “Whoever heard of students going to Hogwarts for eight years! It’s mad, but there it is. Anyway, you should go. There’s also that prophecy to consider, isn’t there? You need to get out more so you can fulfill it.”
“Bugger,” he sighed, and rubbed at his eyes. The ceiling looked down at him unforgivingly. After a quick
Intoxia and Kali entered the werkroom in poor spirits that morning and remained quieter than usual as they prepared their runway looks.
That was Draco’s cue to shrug at the audience in her yellow plaid suit and whip her long, sandy-blonde hair around. “I’m like totally buggin’!”
“See you, Albus! Mr. Potter,” Draco could hear Scorpius calling back before catching up with him. “Nice, Dad.”
“I’m Harry Po— oh, you know, don’t worry about it,” he said, seeming to change his mind. Maybe he hadn’t completely forgotten how badly Draco had embarrassed himself in her bathroom earlier.
Draco leaped over the bale of hay that each queen had danced in front of. She began shifting her weight from one leg to the other as she hopped up and down.
your obsession with corn? You don’t need to glue it onto your outfit. You have enough on your feet as it is.” Kali stuck out his tongue, then stuck out a sandaled foot as if to defiantly model his corns.
“When I call your name, please step forward. Lady Cakes McMansion, Venus Flygirl. Condragulations, you are both the winners of this week’s challenge.”
Pansy and Zabini failed to notice when Draco snuck off, thankfully. He made his way to the second-floor girls’ bathroom to pay Myrtle a visit. She had maybe-possibly loved him. The least he could do was stop by to say hello.
Venus shrugged. “Lorena, come on over here, girl!” Lorena beamed and skipped over to join the other three as Kali’s smile faded.
Draco cringed. He needn’t have worried, however, because very few people turned their heads in their direction. What was even more disturbing, as he looked around the hall, was seeing how everyone he had gone to school with looked so much older than he remembered. It was like all their faces had partially melted.
“FATHER!” Scorpius had entered the room levitating a cake, and gave Draco a horrified look. “No one wants to see your penis!”
“Anyway,” Malfoy continued breezily, “I think I have all the information I need to proceed. I will send you an owl when the tax documents are ready for you to sign.”
“All right,” RuPaul said. “Now that we have concluded the opening statements, our first question is from Rachel Maddow.”
.” Paris raised her eyebrow. “I still remember when you said you could work with Hair of the Dog in our cooking show challenge. Are you sure you can turn this out the way you think you can?”
Draco had wondered why he hadn’t seen Villareal at the quidditch park lately. She hadn’t exactly been his favourite person, however, so he didn’t let the news bother him. Kong seemed like a friendlier replacement as far as he was concerned. He tucked the letters into an inner pocket of his salmon suit and returned to the workroom to get into makeup for the challenge.
Queens scrambled to get to their makeup stations. Goldie dragged Draco over to his station and sat him down in the chair, then studied his face before reaching for some foundation.
“Oh! Yes, thank you, we are all very honored. All right, are you all ready to play Snatch Game?” RuPaul switched topics. Everyone cheered. Mary Berry lifted her glass in salute and took another drink.
“I was nervous,” he explained. “I— may have gotten a little carried away,” he admitted, “but I certainly didn’t mean to jump quite so high. I meant to jump and do a single flip. The second flip just...happened.”
And as sad as he was at the unknown stretch of life and loveless years before him, he could at least find comfort in having at least known something about love, however short.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called out, descending down a set of stairs in a striped pink and white suit and matching striped fedora as the queens cheered.
“I suppose I should consider taking on some muggle gigs, maybe. Mariah and Dean have been pushing me to create my own video show for muggles. Have you heard of something called The Tube?”
Draco ignored the rebuke and set about collecting the rest of his son’s books as quickly as possible. One might say that he fled the store after paying. But he was already having such a rough time with things, so I’m going to be charitable and let him off the hook this time.
“That’s thirty-three different looks, and they told us, ‘Here’s a pile of random stuff you can use to make your Wonders of the World outfits.’ So we’re all dashing towards this pile and climbing over each other, and it’s like, complete chaos. And then I see Kali lift up this giant bag of unshucked corn and I have no idea where’s she’s going with that. Don’t she know that corn don’t help anyone on this show?"
The screen showed a photo of a seemingly naked Paris standing in an election booth, holding the curtain in front of her with a scandalized look on her face as if she had been caught in the shower.
“Lemonade! Sorry, not a match. Now, let’s ask Amelia Earhart. Wait, where did Amelia go?” There was an empty seat where Venus had been sitting. “We lost Amelia Earhart!” RuPaul cried. “Again!”
“For this last trick, I’m going to make light come out of the magic wand,” Draco explained, then shimmied, waving her hands dramatically.
“Lady Cakes, you are a divine comedienne,” RuPaul said, “But tonight, your performance was a tragedy. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
,” she continued, emphasizing the final words by speaking them even louder into the mic. It got a few more titters from the audience.
This is likely my last update before the new year. Thanks for staying with this story, and have a happy holiday of your choice!
“Yes, he mentioned he’s visited you and your brother.” Draco didn’t feel any jealousy or resentment there. None at all.
“Of course,” Harry smiled at him. That was his Draco. They were both in their nineties, but some things never changed.
In the last few months he had metamorphosed into Theoretical Drag Queen Draco Malfoy. At least, it was theoretical while Draco still practiced in the privacy of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place for an audience of Harry, a couple house elves, and Dean Thomas’ muggle sister who had been willing to help him prepare his
on a landing pad in the TSA Portkey Office at Los Angeles International Airport. After the initial dizziness subsided, he began to get his bearings. The room was large, noisy, and noticeably warmer than the portkey office he had departed from in the Ministry of Magic.
Draco was surprised to feel a pang of loss at Cindy’s departure. She hadn’t gotten to know Queenie Q at all at the beginning, and really hadn’t warmed up to Carmelita Corazon — but Cindy had been an upbeat, cheerful presence in the workroom.
“Here we go, four queens of color, and only one non-white part,” Carmelita muttered as he looked at the script with dismay.
“Steve Donovan,” RuPaul continued, “You are a showgirl of the highest caliber, and I’m sure we haven’t seen the last of you.”
“Welcome, Draco!” RuPaul greeted. “This is legendary photographer Mike Ruiz. He’s going to be taking your photos, but
Draco shrugged and handed it to her. “I don’t know, Crabbe. If it hurts, it should only be for a moment.”
“Oh, hon, I think you’re beautiful just the way you are,” special guest judge Dolly Parton cooed. Draco smiled and winked at her.
Draco rushed to figure out what a muggle psychic would look like, then shrugged and threw on a mishmash of shawls and scarves with a ratty cardigan and skirt.
“Now, here’s how the game works, ladies! I will ask a series of questions, our celebrity contestants fill in the blanks, and you will give an answer that you think will match theirs. First up, Emma. Dirty Diana is so dirty, she uses
“Oh—okay,” Acacia responded uncertainly. Behind the camera, Michelle and Martha made odd faces, but said nothing. Draco continued. Americans were so weird about the metric system.
Unfortunately, that didn’t stop anyone else from laughing. Letting Lady Cakes look at her notebook now ranked at the top of Draco’s long list of regrets in life.
By this point, she was up on her knees. She gracefully sank backward with one arm covering her eyes until her back hit the stage. She was going to emote these lyrics for all they were worth.
“Have you seen the medic?” Draco asked. The show provided a medic to handle any injuries that happened on set.
“Honestly, I don’t know why she’s here,” Intoxia told the judges. “She’s not a performer, so I don’t know what she hopes to get out of being here in the first place.
“There’s a spell I’ve found in the Manor library,” Draco said, setting the book on the table and opening it up to the right page. “We bring him back to life for just a few seconds, then he dies again and moves on.”
After everyone had changed and left the studio, Draco found himself riding back to the hotel with Lady Cakes, Kali Sister, Venus Flygirl, Steve Donovan, and Goldie Hanako.
“Everybody’s getting out of drag in the workroom, and Draco has to go take a shower just to wash all the cake off,” Acacia Davenport laughed. “So then later, in walks this tall, blond drink of water looking like he just stepped off a yacht or something, and I’m like, ‘Who the hell is this?’”
“I waited to send this until I was sure you would be alone. I’ve found a lawyer, and she and I are going to work together to fight this stupid lawsuit. Don’t come back to London — you’ve worked too hard just to give up now. Stay in the race. I love you.”
That night, Draco made it back to his hotel room and threw himself on the bed, ignoring the file left by Simmons and wishing he could obliviate the entire day from his memory. He wasn’t there for more than five minutes before there was a knock at the door.
decorated the walls of an otherwise bland, corporate setting. He felt out of place, awkwardly wearing a black silk dressing kimono without a shirt, face covered in contouring makeup patterns and hair taped back. Draco wasn’t wearing enough drag yet to feel like a woman, and too much to feel like his male self. Fluid as his gender expression was, he had never completely gotten comfortable with the in-between.
“Thank you, ladies, I think we’ve heard enough,” RuPaul told the queens on the stage. “While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.”
“Girl, I’m shook,” she answered. “I really felt like I was on top of my game, but I psyched myself out. I kept thinking that I had to nail this challenge to prove myself as a comedy queen, and I just got too far into my own head.”
“Of course!” Draco shot back. “It’s just that— well, I suppose I was a bit distracted, what with the court case and all.”
The next few hours passed in a blur of neon lights, tequila shots, and male go-go dancers. All thoughts about the Wizengamot, his father, the Malfoy name, and the disastrous kitchen challenge faded from Draco’s mind as the night wore on, the queens all laughing and having a good time.
At some point during the queenstorm, Ivana Mann rolled her eyes and smiled at Lady Cakes McMansion and Draco. “Well anyway, congrats to the two of you on your win! I guess I’ll have to congratulate Lorena later after the shit settles.” She laughed.
“Darling, we need more designers in the White House!” Lorena answered passionately. “Gucci, of course! And Chanel, Gaultier, Versace, Mark Jacobs, Vivienne Westwood…”
A glittering silver heel on the right foot peeked around his left leg, revealing bare skin from the slit in the feminine gown. The leg curled around the left knee, then the whole body swiveled until Draco was facing fully front, showing both right and left sides to the judges.
Harry cleared his throat, attempting to steer the conversation back on track. “So, how do we address this situation?”
“All right, they would hang bears outside their windows, because they’re so gay! Let’s see if we have a match from any of our celebrities. Jameela Jamil, how did you answer?”
“Arf! Arf!” Goldie Hanako barked playfully and laughed even as she tore off her ginger wig and flung herself onto the workroom sofa.
“You know how he is about photographers,” Draco added. “Getting him adjusted to having a camera in his face is going to be an entirely different challenge. Once he’s comfortable baking within the time limitations, Millicent and I will put him through rigorous television personality training by bringing in a camera and asking him question after question about his baking.”
” Courtney reached around Draco, picked up a small handful of cake and smashed it right in the middle of Draco’s face. “See how you like it!”
“This is the most fascinating book I’ve ever read. Under ‘Technology,’ you have ‘Chair strap,’” Lady Cakes continued, then squinted. “‘One must fasten a chair strap while riding in an artmobile.’ What’s an artmobile?”
“Now, just between us girls, what do you think? Let’s start with Draco—,” RuPaul began as the judges conferred.
Several members of the audience laughed along with Draco. Harry, who had been monitoring the pub for any sign of a threat, worked his way back to the side where Draco was sitting and whispered in his ear.
She closed her eyes and breathed slowly. After a moment, she folded the letter back in the envelope and stuffed it into the half-heart-shaped slit in her gown. There would be time to process this news later.
Last week on DDR: Draco has a lot of social media followers, Millicent wants to see women in drag, the queens talk about seeing owls, Draco has to stop using Malfoy in her drag name, Draco makes up song titles for Seduction, Ivana is too helpful to the other queens, Draco adopts a drag spider and talks about fashion accessories he designed at Hogwarts, Kali asks Draco to use magic to fix her costume, the queens show off three looks in the ball challenge, Ursa Minor debuts the runway, Draco has a muggle studies lesson, and Ivana sashays away.
Goldie, like Paris, had trouble at the beginning of her act in following such a popular number, but quickly picked up steam and received plenty of laughter for her jokes about being a “gaysian” in Chicago.
“I don’t wanna have to send my Latina sister home,” Carmelita told the camera, “But there ain’t no way I’m going home so early. Bitch better start packing.”
Goldie tapped a long, pink fingernail against her chin in thought, then shrugged. “Hmm, I don’t know! I guess I would wait until I found out if I was nominated before making a choice?”
“Steve Donovan, you are safe.” Steve fell to her knees and sobbed. Kali and Ivana both sighed in resignation. Draco couldn’t help the small smile at seeing Kali in the bottom two.
“And, last but not least, Lady Cakes McMansion, Draco—, and Lorena Gucci, you three will create an ad for RuPaul’s Thick-n-Juicy Chicken.” He picked a piece of chicken off the fourth tray and held it up to his face. “Deeeeelicious!”
Crabbe shrugged, gazing longingly at the toast. Draco couldn’t feel too badly about eating in front of him — he deserved as much for arriving over breakfast. And there was that other small matter of Crabbe almost killing him, Goyle, and the Savior of the Bloody Wizarding World and his friends in the fire he’d died in. What
“Americans, I know you are all frustrated with the politics that have divided your country. So I am extending an olive branch. Let bygones be bygones and forget this silly nonsense. Come back to England. We have all the things you love — dreamy accents, castles, rolling hills dotted with sheep, and quaint little towns with names like Ramsbottom.”
“Now, I can make that light...disappear!” She waved her hands dramatically again, then slid the hand not holding the wand from the base to the tip, seeming to grasp the lit tip.
The next morning, Draco rose late enough that Scorpius was already in the kitchen when he went down to make tea and breakfast. He could hear Aunt Aura and Professor Burbage chatting in the dining room.
“For your main challenge this week, I want each and every one of you —” he looked each of them in the eye dramatically — “to run...for the highest office in the land! America is finally ready for a drag queen president. Because after one reality-show president, what more could go wrong?”
to have a reason to use my skills on a hateful little tosser like you. Just give me a reason.” He flashed his teeth in a sharklike smile.
As the song ended, Draco folded the letter and tucked it back into her bra. She looked up to the stage lights, holding her hand over her bosom where the letter rested.
Potter just looked at him in surprise, a look that quickly morphed into one of speculation. Draco blushed and turned away.
“Old age. Or maybe it was the boating accident. Bit of both, probably. There comes a time when old wizards aren’t meant to magic their way through the Bermuda Triangle in a rowboat during hurricane season, if you ask me. But he had a young fellow as an apprentice. I can’t remember his name, but he’s taken over the business since Dunlap passed away. Let me see,” Pendleton began rifling through a large stack of papers on a desk in the corner. “Ah! Here we are!”
, we’ve had bitchy Beyoncé, Sleepy Farting Beyoncé, and Boring Beyoncé,” Intoxia counted on her fingers. “And they’ve all tanked. What’s Paris gonna contribute?”
Steve as Ellie Sattler was dressed in a sloppy button-down shirt and jeans, her hair in a messy blonde bun. She lifted two toy wingless dragons up in the air and lip synced, “Dinosaurs eat man, woman inherits the earth!”
“Hmm. And you think that your talking about potions and cauldrons on national TV is safe because muggles don’t know any better?”
Draco wasn’t aware how much time had passed like that. Eventually, he pulled away to breathe, his eyes wide.
“Indeed,” Draco repeated, and cringed again for a completely different reason. Could he not think of anything more intelligent to say? He contemplated what would be the best way to tease Potter about being an old fuddyduddy who complained about his kid’s self-expression without Potter turning the teasing back on himself.
“Whichever one of us said it,” Harry continued, rolling his eyes in a way that indicated he still thought his first statement was the correct one. “Draco really seemed to like this idea, so I decided to test it.” A few of the girls grinned at each other.
“Come on,” Steve tugged on his hand and smiled. “We need to get your makeup finished so you can tell us all how to cure a hangover.”
“Calm yourself, Draco!” Villareal hissed. She quickly cast wards around the room to prevent more of his accidental magic from escaping.
“No, he’s over there,” the ginger pointed across the Great Hall. Sure enough, he could see Crabbe’s ghostly form laughing with Theo Nott at the bar, his hands waving wildly. Draco slapped his palm to his forehead and grimaced.
RuPaul looked around thoughtfully. “Courtney Act is a queen who can turn even a tiny bit of fabric into an outfit,” he commented. “You’re both fishy queens. Are you planning to serve us some body-oddy-oddy?”
“So you see,” Potter said, sliding closer to him on the giant potato, “You don’t have to fall in love with a ghost to fulfill your little prophecy. Or vice versa.” He grinned.
“Right, because ghosts have a great sense for the passage of time,” he scoffed. It had, in fact, been five years, three months, a week, and two days. Not that he was counting.
“In her defense, she didn’t get as much from her Secret Santa as some of the other queens,” Ru explained.
On the set, Acacia interacted with each queen in turn for Smells Like Fish, alternating between chatting with the cooks and asking questions about the steps in the process.
And, thankfully, they had let him redesign their robes, too. Draco felt he had made a difference there as well. He hadn’t been allowed to design anything
“Very mature,” Pansy made a face. “Draco, did he tell you that he cheated on me with an eighteen-year-old? She’s a friend of our daughter Begonia’s. She’s barely out of Hogwarts!”
“That was terrible,” Lady Cakes sighed. “Can we just erase that performance from the tapes and pretend I went home sick with the flu or something?”
“Thank you, Salmon Buffet!” Venus loudly exclaimed as she painted her face with bright purple glitter.
“I am a pageant queen. I understand competition, and working with backstabbing bitches. I believe the pageant circuit has molded me into someone capable of standing up to Washington insiders,” Paris answered.
Draco walked into the sitting room in Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, where his boyfriend was watching something on television. They had been dating for a few months before Harry had introduced him to the muggle concept of television shows. At first, he had thought the whole idea of a wizard watching “telly” terribly silly, something Harry did to make up for what he’d been denied as a child in a muggle home. Draco usually made a point of reading a book while he sat next to him on the sofa, feigning boredom as Harry watched people on the telly kneel on the floor in front of ovens and fret over the state of their Genoese cakes.
“Right, we all know you were expecting some sort of Malfoy dark arts sex dungeon.” A teenage girl with brown hair snickered.
The queens team up for a battle of ‘80s and ‘90s movie heroines in a pole-dancing-themed Rusical! On the runway, we get to see their “Red Carpet Realness” looks.
An hour later, the queens walked into the werkroom in boy garb, most of them in jeans and T-shirts or tank tops that advertised drag queen personas. Draco wore a wide-sleeved white button-down shirt with ruffled cuffs, tucked into a fitted pale blue waistcoat and light grey trousers. He had tied a grey silk ascot around his neck, fastened in place with a sapphire tie pin.
rubbish, by the way. The only thing it’s useful for is teaching someone how to create a horcrux, and frankly, we don’t need another Voldemort on our hands.” Draco paled. “I think Harry’s right — we should burn it.”
“I’m going to write down the form numbers on a little sheet of parchment,” Malfoy continued, scribbling with his quill. “Then all you have to do is go to the relevant offices and point at the numbers with your greasy little finger.” He shoved the parchment at Harry. “We’ll try again tomorrow.”
“Your portkey arrived just as American flight 135 from Heathrow sent passenger luggage to baggage claim,” she explained. “You’ll need to go out that door—” she pointed to an Exit sign beyond her kiosk— “and you will see people coming out of Customs and heading toward Ground Transportation. Follow the flow of traffic and you will eventually see airport exits. Do you have a ride picking you up?”
She sank to her knees and lifted her face and hands heavenward as the Pit Crew stopped throwing balls. “WHYYYYY???!!” she cried.
“That was it,” Draco answered. “Really, it’s not a very realistic prophecy at all. They’re just teasing because they want to laugh about me getting my jollies on over a ghost.”
“The only ones relevant to the prophecy would be those who died young and continued on after death,” Draco corrected, then shuddered. “But not Crabbe. Myrtle can have him.”
“Really. I think you’re rather clever and handsome,” she replied. Her coy smile turned mischievous. “Would you care to come and visit my toilet?”
“Dickens thought Bob Marley was spending his afterlife in total misery, but he didn’t know what he was talking about, any more than your precious Shakespeare did when he wrote
“Good God, I’m glad that’s over,” Lady Cakes sighed and mopped his brow. “This challenge just about killed me.”
it’s funny.” Goldie cried. She frantically waved her hands in front of her face. “Oh my god, I’m gonna mess up my eye makeup!”
Lorena turned to face the back of the set and wiggled her well padded derrière. She looked over her shoulder and said in a sexy voice, “Chicken butt!”
The queens dashed to their stations and began tearing through outfits and makeup. Draco wasn’t sure exactly what constituted “country realness,” so he started slathering on eye makeup and lipstick while watching the other queens for ideas. Eventually she decided that she had a pair of jeans and a button-down shirt that would work if she tied the shirt ends together at her midriff.
When he was back in his hotel room, he quickly read through letters from Harry, Pansy, Blaise, his great-great-great aunt (of all people), and a crayon drawing from Teddy that showed himself and Draco with matching turquoise hair and purple dresses.
“Now, for your maxi challenge this week, we’re going to play a different kind of game,” RuPaul continued. “SNATCH GAME!”
RuPaul doubled over in laughter. “That’s okay, Taylor, that’s okay. Just shake it off,” he told her. Taylor shook her arms and head.
So here Draco was, getting herself back into drag — this time for a magical audience. And Teddy — Harry's godson and Draco's little cousin Teddy, who was way too young for the gay nightlife, was still very much excited about drag. Draco guessed it had something to do with being a metamorphmagus and finding a potential outlet for his natural gifts. In any case, Draco was talked into letting the boy keep him company while he got ready for the show. Draco liked Teddy, but he hadn’t anticipated how much
Draco blinked. None of them actually took her seriously on that statement. They thought it was just talk.
“I think maybe you might have relied a little too much on the visual gag,” special guest judge Amy Schumer told Lorena.
Draco moved away from the desk to sit next to him on the sofa and took both Harry’s hands in his own. “Harry,” he started, “this is something I need to do. I’m going to be a drag queen, and I’m
“Right,” Weasley looked at his watch. “I’m going back to the party. You coming, Hermione? Harry?” Granger-Weasley nodded and walked with him towards the door.
The stand-up comedy routines varied drastically as each queen tried to play to their strengths. Venus opened the show with a story about growing up in the barrio of LA, making the audience laugh as she talked about her first attempts to do drag as a
Steve flashed her the stink eye. After accusing Lady Cakes of coming for her in Untucked, Steve still appeared to hold a grudge.
Draco reacted the way she did with Courtney Act? He had been raised with better manners than that. No, it wasn’t a question of whether Draco knew any better. It was more accurate to say that Draco’s better judgment shut itself off as soon as someone bruised his pride. Impulse control had never been his strong suit.
Draco buried his face in one hand. “I knew the first challenge was going to be a sewing challenge. I was prepared for that,” he confessed as he lifted his head again. “I wasn’t expecting to fuck it up before getting to the sewing part.”
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called as he entered the werkroom and descended the stairs in a suit patterned with eggplants over a green button-down shirt.
He frowned in confusion, but put down his brush and stood up. “Yes, of course,” he answered, and followed her out of the werkroom. The other queens looked at each other in confusion.
“Come on, Malfoy. Eat a weenie.” Potter speared one of the tiny sausages on an equally tiny toothpick and placed it on a napkin, holding it out to him. “
“Yes. If he took his medication, maybe he wouldn’t feel the need to be so violent anymore. We should
RuPaul laughed. “I see! And you have some metal plates over here,” he picked one off the work table. “Is this going to be a stone?”
Finally, YAY! I must confess that it’s been difficult for me to focus on this fic while sheltering in place. I did my best writing at work and got most of my inspiration while walking to/from work. But if ever I needed a kick in the pants, it was seeing the teaser for the next episode of Season 12. Would you believe I’ve had this chapter planned since last summer?! Gotta get my version out before RuPaul does! ;-)
Draco had no control over what was revealed in future episodes. They had been recorded in the past, of course. Draco knew what was coming; he just didn’t know how the wizarding public would react as a result.
,” Draco purred, pointing into the saucepan suggestively and trying to infer as much double entendre as queenly possible. She stirred a wooden spoon and wagged her eyebrows at the camera. She gasped and exclaimed, “Ooh-ooh! It’s my cauldron full of hot, strong love!”
“For my pinup look, I am working my ballet skills for the judges. And for the record, I have a twenty-two-inch waist, no corset required,” Draco looked smugly at the camera. “You are welcome to hate me.”
“Now, for our main challenge, we have a special holiday treat in store for you. Oh, Pit Crew!” Ru called out in a singsong voice, and several muscular men clad only in red underpants and Santa hats marched into the werkroom, each carrying a large box wrapped in holiday paper.
“Hey, I like it!” Venus declared. “We make art. We should get around in an artmobile. I’m calling it that from now on.”
Draco sighed and nodded in relief. She squeezed Goldie’s hand before going to the back of the stage.
“All right, Jiggly,” RuPaul grinned, “Thank you for joining us today! Now, it’s time to introduce our next celebrity. She is the 2019 Woman of the Decade Award winner, Taylor Swift!”
The queens ran to their stations and hurriedly began rifling through wardrobe options. Draco had no idea what Election Day Eleganza was meant to look like. Fortunately, he had decided to dress in a more simple outfit for the workroom that day — just a salmon pink suit jacket and trousers, cream-colored shirt, and opalescent bow tie — so it took less effort to change clothes for the challenge.
“It’s going to take a lot of work, too. You know I love you and support you one hundred percent,” he added quickly. “It’s just that learning how to be a queen and submitting an audition video in less than three weeks is going to take a
RuPaul gasped at the reveal. Draco smirked, hand still raised to the right shoulder, and quirked up his eyebrow at the judges. Draco’s entire left side was in male costume — matching grey trouser leg and shoe beneath a silver-grey suit jacket with a high collar. He wore his short, natural hair on the left, and no drag makeup.
“Let me get this straight,” Draco responded. “You’re asking me to cheat in the competition by fixing your costume for you, and do magic in plain sight of the cameras and everyone else, which means breaking the law and risking a prison sentence. All so I can have someone to
“I’m so excited — this is my first mini challenge on the show!” Draco gushed as the camera switched to footage of Draco stepping onto the photo set towards RuPaul and a man with salt-and-pepper hair who held a large camera. The set was designed to look like an overly decorated room full of Victorian furniture and framed pictures of queens from previous seasons on the walls.
“Now, sign here to allow Gringotts to forward the tax payment directly to the DOUR,” Malfoy continued as Harry scribbled his signature. “Sign this form to tell Gringotts to mail your bank statements on plain instead of lavender-colored parchment, and this other form to tell the Ministry the same.” Harry scribbled.
I’m not usually one to write fics with non-fictional characters, but this story wouldn’t leave me alone so here we are. Apologies to Courtney Act in particular! I think she’s fierce and an amazing performer. I don’t really think RuPaul would let other queens have that much power over one of the contestants, though.
Draco peered into the mirror and raised her eyebrows. “Nice work,” she told Goldie, honestly impressed.
“Especially not him.” Draco felt his face heat. He wasn’t used to spending this much time in a Floo.
“Whoa-whoa whoaaaaa, caught in a bad romance!” Teddy sang, whipping metamorphed long, turquoise hair over his shoulder.
Kali continued on the blond theme. “Draco, with your hair, when you wear green, you look like the world’s largest ear of corn with daddy issues.” RuPaul bent over in laughter. Draco spun in a circle to model his green-and-gold suit and flipped Kali a two-fingered salute as he finished.
. It means you won’t get a hangover if you drink too much of it. I’ll thank you to send me a case when all is said and done here, on top of my professional fee, of course.”
“Really, Queen?” Intoxia raised an eyebrow at the camera. “Carmelita is...fishy and effeminate. We’re talking about Trinity from
After both teams performed, the queens changed into their runway looks. The theme was “Red Carpet Realness.” Draco proudly stepped down the runway in a peplum jacket and pencil skirt. She was confident that she understood the challenge better than the other queens, who were oddly dressed in sequined and beaded gowns that had nothing to do with carpet.
Harry Gryffindor just laughed and began dancing. He removed his tie, then slowly, sensually, unbuttoned his shirt while thrusting his hips forward. Breasts had been spelled to the sides, the leftover curves translating into pectoral muscles. A glamour charm on the rest of the torso presented six-pack abdominal muscles. He continued dancing, giving Draco and Granger smoldering looks.
The good news is that I’m pushing through and getting back to work on this fic, because I really want to see it through to the end. Thank you all for sticking with this fic. And without further ado, here’s chapter 9!
“Whatever we do, we gotta make it funny,” Goldie added. “Maybe one of us could do something like Hair of the Dog for a hangover or something…?”
“Nooooo!” Goldie cried. “I’m devastated, but it’s time to get on with the lip sync, because I’m not ready to go.”
“Come on, Girl! We’re doing male street glam. Just a little bit of eye makeup and highlighter,” Goldie said, smearing hot pink eyeshadow above and below her eyes.
The queens looked back nervously as RuPaul and Warren exited the room. This was going to be a rough challenge.
She’d been using RuPaul’s name in the werkroom and in the interviews, but not in front of the actual queen herself. She breathed.
Lorena looked around the room, too. “I think Blondie’s in trouble,” he said, nodding his head in Draco’s direction. Draco sat at his worktable, still glaring at the stuffed koala in front of him. The koala stared back at him with vapid eyes.
“Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have anything to do with these runway decisions,” RuPaul added, “so please don’t send me any hate mail about cultural appropriation.”
About the flame war: apparently there is a vocal segment of Drag Race fans who have been harassing black queens from the show. This article shares some of those experiences: https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/rupauls-drag-race-fandom-racism
Draco sighed in relief, glad to see her go. He flew another lap before descending and returning to the hotel.
When the music finally ended, Lorena and Intoxia posed, breathless, and looked expectantly at RuPaul.
Draco checked her direct messages. “GIRL! LOL WHERE YOU BEEN??????” Goldie had sent. Draco sent off a quick reply and navigated to her page information. Her jaw dropped.
“I get that you have to keep it on the down-low, so I covered for you in the van earlier.” Kali leaned against the wall nonchalantly.
After Steve screwed up the same cue for the tenth time, he sat down heavily on a stool and whined pitifully. “I just feel so stupid,” he confessed, starting to cry. “I’ll never get this choreography!” Suddenly, he was enveloped by five queens, each wrapping an arm around him.
“I beg your pardon,” Draco huffed. “She could have been in love with me. She was rather supportive of me in Sixth Year.”
The audience at the viewing party had been laughing and making snide commentary about Kali’s attempt at a British accent. Harry and a few others with a bit more exposure to the muggle world laughed at Draco’s Mary Berry impression.
Suddenly, he was caught up in a river of muggles. They all appeared to be walking purposefully in the same direction — and admittedly, looking just as tired and annoyed as Draco felt. Draco summoned his courage and joined the flow of traffic down one long corridor after another until he came into a larger area with glass doors to the outside. Beyond the doors, he could see muggle vehicles starting and stopping. What were they called again? Art-o-motors? Carmobiles?
Eventually, the queens began shedding their wigs and dresses and taking off makeup. Draco’s head turned abruptly when he heard Lady Cakes gasp in pain at the clothing rack next to his.
a wonder of the world?!” Venus laughed. She stroked her Christ the Redeemer beard, which was covered in blue glitter.
Draco barely registered the hands of queens on either side of her reaching out to touch her shoulders.
“We’ve had to get in touch with the British Aurors because transporting animals across international borders without going through customs is a violation of international law. And no, before you ask, your boyfriend’s not coming over here to deliver them himself.”
Draco jumped backwards in shock, hitting his back against a shelf of books on personal care. A book titled
Sure, Draco was no slouch when it came to strategy, but how well did he understand how each queen would influence each other’s performances in a comedy challenge? If Draco wanted to make the most out of this opportunity, he would need to channel Shangela’s ability to play the other queens’ abilities against each other. What would Shangela do?
“Setting aside for a moment that I think living with a Gryffindor has rubbed off on you in a frightening way, would you say that you have a...
Draco had opted to wear just a simple button-down blue shirt and grey trousers that day, which allowed him more time to slip into a lilac tank dress, ice-blue wig, and basic makeup. She made it to the nail station before most of the queens descended upon it like locusts in the most chaotic frenzy she had yet experienced on Drag Race.
RuPaul laughed. “Well, Draco, I’ll leave you to it,” he finished, and headed over to Goldie’s work table.
“Corgies?” RuPaul asked. Kali-as-Jameela nodded. “She uses Welsh Corgies as birth control? I see you’ve chosen an unusual spelling there. Why did you use a mix of numbers and letters?”
Yet there was more to it than just getting something out of helping his drag sisters. The more time he spent with them, the more he genuinely
“You can do it over there,” she pointed at the end of the table, completely unphased. She then turned her attention back to the line. “I can help who’s next!” she barked.
she exclaimed, and pulled out her deck of cards. “Now, I’ll make these cards fly!” She held the deck between two fingers and squeezed until all but one card flew out and landed on the stage. The audience laughed.
“—But technically legal. And I wouldn’t worry about any ‘tangible threats’ around here. It’s not like you don’t have a team of Aurors following your every move, right?” She smiled at him. It was a wide, toothy, predatory smile that made Draco feel like the wampus cat had found him after all.
“Excellent! That’s a great answer. Now, let’s turn to our celebrity panel. Ariana, how did you answer?”
A chuckle echoed across the tiles from behind him. Draco swiftly spun around and caught Potter smiling at him. Memories of their last encounter in this bathroom unnervingly flitted through his head. He couldn’t reconcile the angry sixteen-year-old Potter with the one standing in front of him at this moment. This one was a handsome silver fox and radiating ten times the confidence that he ever had in school.
Draco grimaced. “Too orange,” he said, then cringed. He had never worn makeup a day in his life and felt no urge to start any time soon.
Paris squealed and jumped up and down excitedly. RuPaul told her to join the others at the back of the stage.
RuPaul gave him a blank stare. “O-okay.” He looked at the other items on the table. “And how do you plan to incorporate some of these other gifts?”
“For your first look, you’ll be serving up Beach Blanket Realness. And by that, I mean you should wear a swimsuit, not a blanket,” RuPaul looked pointedly at Draco. The queens chuckled while Draco served her best sweet, innocent look.
Draco huffed as he went to work transfiguring three suitcases to match the original and repacked his bags. He felt his face burn with humiliation as he moved flashy gowns, wigs, accessories, and dozens of other items the average man wouldn’t be carrying into the newly transfigured luggage.
“I’m really sad to gooooooo,” Steve cried to the camera. “Being on this show has definitely meant a lot to me. I may not be a winner, but I definitely deserved to be here, and I think I did my best. Come see me when you’re in Vegas!” She waved and smiled.
“This is insane,” Lorena Gucci lamented. “Normally, I take four or six hours to beat my face. How can I do it on someone else in just thirty minutes?!”
“So, what do you think they’ll have us do this week?” Paris asked. That was the cue for the television screen to turn itself on.
Or, if the non-Drag Race scenes are getting to be too much, use your search function to find “Morning, Racers!” to skip ahead to the challenges. I know I’m padding a lot of this fic with behind-the-scenes bits… :-)
“Your performance as Cher was on point,” Todric said, and Draco was grateful for the change of the subject. “You knew your choreography, you knew your lines, and you got the Alicia Silverstone facial expressions down.” Draco smiled.
Of course, having arrived dressed in such a multitude of buttons, a tie, and tie pin meant that Draco took longer to undress, and was barely able to throw a long blonde wig on her head before the time ran out.
So, no, Draco was no stranger to ghosts. Once he had become a widower, a part of him had hoped that his wife would become a ghost, too.
“Ooh, I wouldn’t mind seeing your cat sometime,” Venus-as-Amelia-Earhart said, waggling her eyebrows. She turned to RuPaul. “Back in my day, we used to call that a
Draco grinned. After the day he’d had, a pub crawl sounded perfect. The queens poured themselves into his room.
“Oh, like you’re any better?” Draco gave her a pointed look. Kali and Goldie gaped, looking delighted at the prospect of more drama.
Draco scowled, though she pretended not to notice. “From now on,” she continued, “any more mail will be relayed through LAAD and I’ll pass it along to you. We can’t just let all these owls fly around delivering mail in front of no-mags. We managed to obliviate Ivana and Steve last night. Plus Kali and another no-mag who saw the owl in your hotel,” she added.
“I could have done better in the challenge,” Intoxia said as she held a figurine of RuPaul backstage. “I’m sorry that I didn’t do right by Carrie Fisher, but I’m not going to dwell on it. It’s time to look ahead to what’s next in my career.”
“Draco is out there nailing every single word,” Goldie explained. “She’s not even looking at that piece of paper. She don’t need no cheat sheet!”
Luggage mishap aside, this was going well enough so far, he thought to himself. Draco’s first solo venture among muggles wasn’t the horror story that his family had warned him about as a child — nor was it the cause for stress that Harry seemed to think Draco might face. He chuckled to himself as he wondered why anyone would think a wizard needed to take a class for muggle studies.
Lily sighed, shook her head, and poured herself another drink. “Dad, don’t you two have any stories that aren’t about sex?”
Draco wasn’t sure how many of those critics had been attending the viewing parties and seeing exactly how much (or how little) Draco was revealing about the existence of magic to a muggle audience. Rita Skeeter was still writing a weekly column with a synopsis of each episode, and as a result, more people came into the pub to watch the next show on the Bent Unicorn’s enchanted screen. Beyond that benefit, Draco frankly hadn’t given the criticism much thought. If he hadn’t been caught by the MACUSA Aurors for his behavior in LA, he had nothing to fear from a few old grumps with nothing better to do than shout into the void. And he certainly didn't lose sleep over Dolores Umbridge's offence at Draco's impersonation of her.
“Right,” Draco replied. His mind was spinning with vague recollections of American news and retorts that he thought it would be wiser not to say.
Draco stepped onto the runway in the doll’s dress. She had styled a blonde wig into ringlet curls that dangled above her shoulders and wore Mary Jane low-heeled shoes with knee-high white stockings.
“Welcome, ladies!” RuPaul addressed the queens as they lined up at the front of the stage. “Based on your three ball looks, I’ve made some decisions. When I call your name, please step forward,” she instructed.
!” Draco argued. “Anyway, It was going well, up until Harry starts pushing at me and yelling, ‘Get down, get down!’ And I think this is just him getting excited, so I keep going, until he shoves me really hard and I look up and see this massive muggle airplane come barreling right at us. It was so close I could even see the muggles staring at us through the window, and I think, ‘We’re going to die.’ We managed to dash out of the way just in time, but I’m shaking and scared out of my mind.”
’s prestigious list of 20 Under 20 Most Successful Wizards and Witches of Britain. And with that went all ambitions for a career in the Ministry, let alone Prime Minister.
With that, he fled out of the bathroom and down the corridor in the opposite direction of the Great Hall.
Kali had repeated everything Draco said, word for word, under her breath. Draco put down the contour brush and glared at the other queen.
Draco ran her free hand up one long leg and pouted. “Chicken thigh,” she sighed in her sultriest voice. Merlin, this was stupid.
Draco ran her free hand up one long leg and pouted. “Chicken thigh,” she sighed in her sultriest voice. Merlin, this was stupid.
“My aunt is a witch,” Kali said. “So I know a little bit about the magical world. Owls sending letters, people suddenly losing memories — kinda sounds familiar, you know?” He flashed Draco a wide grin.
“Did you know that koalas have one of the smallest brains in proportion to its body size of any animal?” Draco asked. “It’s literally one of the dumbest animals in the world. So, whenever you’re feeling like you’re not good enough, just remind yourself that at least you’re smarter than a koala.” She flashed her most charming smile.
Potter tapped his chin again, giving the ceiling a pensive stare. “Hmm,” he said, “You know, I might have died.”
“Now, just between us squirrelfriends,” RuPaul said to the judges, “I want to know what you have to say about my girls.”
“The Room of Requirement?” Granger-Weasley frowned. “Are you sure it’s still operational? It was heavily damaged in the fire.”
She pulled her hand off the tip and waved it at the audience, revealing that the light had gone out. Draco squealed.
“Draco,” RuPaul continued. Draco straightened her shoulders. “Hocus Pocus, you’re the witch with the mostest. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week’s challenge.”
The man got into the front left seat of the not-Knight-Bus and looked back at Draco. Draco only had time for a fleeting realization that the steering wheel was on the wrong side. Weren’t they supposed to be on the right? “All buckled in?” the man asked.
“I died on the grand staircase,” Aunt Aura chimed in. “It was rather gruesome. I could show you a reenactment, if you like.”
“Do you ever feel like your life is missing something?” Crabbe asked him. “I think they have more fun than you do,” he gestured towards the pair as Aunt Aura suddenly crowed and clapped her hands together in victory. “You’ve got to stop living like you’re dead.”
“Hmm,” she said, “You have a page labeled ‘US Culture’ and underneath it you’ve written ‘Taco Tuesday,’ ‘Dad Bod,’ ‘Red Carpet Event,’ and ‘Hash Fag: ask Intoxia?’” Lady Cakes looked over to Intoxia. “What’s a hash fag?”
“Can’t say I’m disappointed,” Myrtle spoke up. “I wouldn’t mind having a little more time to get to know you better.” She smiled coyly at Crabbe.
, you are the winner of this week’s maxi challenge.” Ivana’s jaw dropped. She beamed and nodded her head in gratitude.
One by one, each queen was called forward and given one of the boxes. Once all boxes were distributed, RuPaul said, “There’s just one more thing—you’ve already met your Secret Santas at your photo shoot! Now, go on and see what you’ve got in your box!”
On Elimination Day, the queens reentered the workroom. Draco, Paris, and Goldie had stayed up late to rehearse their act, but felt confident. At least, Draco felt confident that their act would be entertaining. He hoped the aurors would see it that way, too.
“I’ve kept a lot of boys company in the bathroom,” she smirked with a wink. “You’ll have to be more specific.”
As soon as he finished reading, the letter disintegrated into a pile of dust. Lucius had always preferred this style of communication over howlers, which he considered gauche.
Later that day, all seven queens headed to the stage to meet a magician who would teach them magic tricks for their acts. Draco had no idea what to expect.
Goldie and Draco waved their hands on either side of Paris, hyping the moment. “Magic!” they cried. The audience applauded.
choose the order in which the queens will perform. Gentlemen, start your engines...and may the funniest bitch win!”
“Draco!” A woman with smooth chocolate skin and bleached dreadlocks called to him from the counter. “I see you got our owl. Thanks for coming in! Are you performing again tonight?”
“I think this is a great opportunity for us to just be goofy as hell,” Goldie said. “I’m so excited about this!”
Draco chuckled to himself and shrugged. “Muggles need more time to tell their story.” It was as good an explanation as he could think up. After witnessing how they filmed everyone on set, Draco was still amazed at the amount of work that had to go into cutting hours and hours of footage into less than an hour for the first episode. That didn’t take into consideration all the fanciful sounds that had been added to the dialog, either.
“Draco,” RuPaul said after a few moments, from where he was standing off to one side. “You’ll need to answer the phone.”
“Sometimes you have to show a little skin,” Draco lip synced with a flirtatious grin. She twirled one leg in a knee-high white sock around the pole before spinning and swinging herself upside down into the splits, her yellow plaid miniskirt falling to reveal yellow plaid knickers. “This reminds guys of being naked. And then they think of sex!”
“He asked for a tattoo of a snake coiled around his cock. Said it had to look good whether he was erect or not, and it had to be
The paper had followed the episode initially due to Draco’s reputation as an ex-Death Eater and, more recently, the Malfoys’ very public court case before the Wizengamot. But after the story about the first episode was published, the wizarding public was swift to react. The next day’s paper had featured an unusually long Letters to the Editor section full of opinions ranging from angry screeds about Draco’s accidental use of magic in front of muggles to enthusiastic support for a pureblood (and, well, former blood-purist bigot) embracing muggle culture.
His mind whirled with dark thoughts that could only be purged by flying on his broom or by smashing everything in his hotel room. He grabbed his broom and disapparated to the San Adra Quidditch Park.
she hung a picture of it in her shop gallery. I went in sometime later to get my Hungarian horntail tattoo and saw it on the wall, so I took the opportunity to talk to it. That’s when I told her his name was Stefan. Anyway, Madame Inkwell was happy to know that her design worked out so well, even in the photo.”
“Like there was any chance of that! I just knew.” Draco smiled and grabbed Harry’s hand. Their hands were old and wrinkled now, with a few liver spots here and there. “There was always something about you, and once I had you back in my life, I wasn’t about to let you leave again.”
Lorena chimed in as she glued rhinestone-studded eyelashes to her lower lid. “Yeah, that’s great, but I’m a drag queen. I’m here to entertain and be fun, not be all serious.”
The next morning, Draco was standing in front of the hotel with the other queens and waiting on their ride back to the studio when Lady Cakes approached him.
“Crabbe, you hover above the circle,” Draco continued. Crabbe moved into place in the middle. “Next, we light a black candle in the middle.”
“You’re a good egg, Draco.” Crabbe flashed a translucent smile. He started to drift towards the window. “But if you’re out of sorts about not seeing your friends, maybe you should try getting out more,” he suggested.
Draco smirked back at him. “You and your foot fetish,” he said. “Just think, if you weren’t so hard for my bare feet, we might not all be here today.”
Draco blinked rapidly. “Thanks,” he muttered with a shuddering breath. Gradually, the queens pulled away.
Harry flushed. He should have been angry. He really should have. But instead, he felt a tiny thrill run down his spine.
As Draco watched the lip sync, she secretly rooted for Kali. Over the past few weeks, Draco had developed something of a kinship with her. It also could be noted that Draco had tired of Lorena’s belligerent attitude towards herself and the other queens.
By this point, Draco’s eyes had shut tightly and she silently screamed the lyrics as the muggle singer belted them out. She hit a tightly clenched fist to her heart, her entire body trembling.
Draco swiveled around to face the direction Steve was looking at. A large barn owl was flying directly towards them. Draco held out her arm and the owl landed.
“I don’t care how many times I have to lip sync. I will send these other girls home one by one,” Acacia said. “If you go up against me, you better bring it, because I am a lip sync assassin. And I want to win.”
“Girl, I don’t even know what's going on anymore,” Goldie laughed. “One minute they were talking about laying their edges, and now…?”
“Charity told me,” she said, gesturing to her spectral partner in crime. Draco turned to the professor in confusion.
“Draco! It’s been a while. How are you, old chap?” He took off his reading glasses and wiped the lenses with a tiny embroidered handkerchief he’d pulled out of his smoking jacket before sliding them back on again.
“What was on that paper you were waving around, anyway?” Kali Sister asked. “We all thought you had a cheat sheet for the lyrics.”
“Hey Ladies!” RuPaul’s voice called to the queens from the large television screen on the wall after everyone had assembled in the werkroom. “What’cha got cookin’? Every queen worth her salt knows how to cook up a good look. But do you have it in you to really take the cake? Why, I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a little something in my lovin’ oven!”
The passport was designed to look like a muggle United Kingdom passport, but it had additional pages invisible to muggles. A bored-looking witch behind a glass window inspected this page when Draco finally made it to the front of the line (after what felt like an eternity). She looked up at his face, looked back down at the passport, then back up at him again. Draco stoically refrained from shifting under her gaze.
Harry stared at him in shock, opening and closing his mouth a couple times while he processed this statement. Finally, he gave Draco a small smile and said, “Okay. Anything for my sweetie.”
It was fair to say that Harry Potter had aged, but the years since Hogwarts had been relatively kind to him. His green eyes now had tiny crow’s feet and his black hair showed silver patches at the temples. But he still had glowing brown skin, tanned from extra time in the summer sun, and the physique of someone who trained every day. Draco’s body, on the other hand, had never developed more muscle mass than what he had by age fourteen (not to mention the same pasty, melanin-deficient complexion), and it was bloody unfair.
“You’re the one he almost killed when he died, along with the rest of us,” Weasley pointed out. He wasn’t wrong, though Draco wouldn’t tell him that. “I suppose he can’t do any more to hurt us now that he’s dead,” he shrugged.
“You rolled right over my turn and made it sound like Beyoncé said something really funny when she didn’t. That wasn’t the greatest answer of all time!” Goldie stifled a laugh. Venus dropped her jaw, her eyes widening.
“They say that I have to figure out back taxes for the Black estate, plus the three years since I’ve been seventeen, within the next two weeks. If I don’t, they say they’re going to audit me, charge me ten thousand galleons in fines, and post a notice in the Prophet about my negligence.” Harry buried his face in his hands. “I don’t even know where to begin!”
“You are all safe. You may leave the stage.” Kali looked especially relieved and bowed to RuPaul. One by one, all five of the safe queens filed offstage to the Untucked lounge.
“Well, look who’s back,” Ivana said loudly, cutting off Cindy, who looked ready to fire back at Acacia. “How did rehearsal go, girls?”
” Draco’s head jerked back to the screen so fast that it was practically a miracle he didn’t give himself whiplash. The queens who had been taking turns strutting were now lined up along the front of the stage while people sitting on a panel criticized their outfits. One of them talked back to the panel in a deep baritone voice.
She was dressed in a Slytherin girl’s uniform that would have gotten any witch kicked out of Hogwarts. Draco had charmed the hem to a shockingly short miniskirt and shrank the jumper to be extra tight around her chest, the neckline cut scandalously low to reveal painted-on cleavage. The blouse was untucked, the ends tied in a little knot that sat high on her waist and revealed her belly button. Underneath, she wore extra padding to create a curvier figure than she normally wore. The hemline of her skirt was raised perilously higher on the thigh than typically acceptable.
Intoxia and Lorena were praised for their looks. The judges didn’t have much to say about their cooking segments on Two Piece and a Biscuit.
“Maybe you’ve been dead this whole time,” Burbage looked up from where she had been waving her arms in front of a dozy. “And you just haven’t realized it.”
Draco turned his attention away from them. Weasley and Potter were sitting on giant turnips the size of armchairs, watching the scene. Granger-Weasley had conjured herself a chair and was sitting at the table, studying the book.
The crowd grew more and more raucous as Draco stoked her Dolores Umbridge impression during the following commercial break.
“Morning, Racers!” RuPaul’s face appeared on the large television screen. The queens gathered round to listen. “My queens, are you ready for the future? It’s time for you to look deep within yourselves and find that special talent you possess. Then lift your magic wands and say, ‘Abra Cadabra! Hocus Pocus, bring this talent into focus!’ Hee hee!”
This would not have been a problem, except that the unexpected letter he had received from his great-great-great aunt was weighing heavily on his mind.
Draco shook his head and wondered what sort of damage Goyle’s newfound muggle lifestyle had done to his sensibilities. He relit the chandeliers as Granger-Weasley went back to the table. She leafed through the horcrux book, her brows furrowed.
should go to the reunion,” he countered, hoping to change the subject. “They might give you your old job back. Or maybe Binns will ask you out on a date.”
“I don’t really sound like that...do I?” Draco asked the producer behind the camera. “Why aren’t you answering?”
Courtney was caught by complete surprise when Draco smashed the handful of cake onto her cheek. Mike Ruiz captured a shot of Courtney’s look of absolute cake-smeared horror as Draco gave the camera an evil grin.
As she reached the end of the runway, she cocked a hand to her hip and spun around. Her backside was completely nude save for the chain at the nape of her neck and the belt at her waist. Below the waist she had glued the small British flag to her left cheek. Draco turned her head over her shoulder to wink at the judges before continuing her runway walk.
“My pen is broken,” Draco muttered. “Has anyone got a pen I could borrow?” The other queens ignored him, concentrating on their own joke-writing efforts.
“I must say, when I found out I was assigned to follow Draco Malfoy’s progress on a muggle reality show, I was a little disappointed.”
Draco was in the mood to be as much as he could. Light reflected off his immaculately styled white-blond hair as the queens gathered around a work table.
Lorena, who was walking in front of them, turned around and laughed. “How do you get tickets for that?"
“What, you’ve never heard that before?” Lady Cakes laughed. Lorena and Draco looked at each other in confusion.
on a rectangle, so this is my way of honoring the cycle by putting the rectangle on me.” She flashed the judges her best smile for good measure.
“No-Magic Confunding Service,” she drawled, giving him an annoyed look for making her take the time to spell out the acronym.
“Whaaaaat?!” Draco cried. He gave the magician a baffled look, his eyes popped and jaw dropped. The queens cheered and applauded.
“Intoxia Madison,” RuPaul continued, “Tonight, your look on the runway is out of this world. But in Snatch Game, your Carrie Fisher impression...failed to launch. I’m sorry my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
Draco chuckled. “Aside from my boyfriend and a very small number of friends, no one knows I’m even doing drag, let alone consorting with muggles...in America, even. I can’t imagine how any of the old blood-supremacists back in England could possibly find out.”
This week: it’s time for the queens to run for president! Draco feels a little out of place here. What’s a Brit to do with American politics?
Draco entered the runway in a floor-length, elaborately beaded silk aubergine gown with long bell sleeves and a low, plunging neckline. She had chosen not to pad this time, going back to her naturally slender silhouette, although her corset made her waist look impossibly small. Her wig was thigh-length, straight platinum blonde hair pulled over one shoulder. She had her arms behind her back, a rope wrapping around her torso and legs tying her to a stake. A small pile of twigs surrounded her feet.
Teddy, on the other hand, only had to look at Draco’s painted face in order to copy it in a matter of seconds, which he did at this moment. It was both endearingly precocious and bloody annoying.

After the end of Episode 3, the queens reentered the werkroom to find Cindy Sanchez’s lipstick message.
that fell into muggle hands. It’s full of information on herbology, astronomy, and potions, all written in Veela, and the muggles have spent a hundred years trying to make sense of it. But it hasn’t been considered a breach of the Statute because they still don’t know what they’re even looking at.”
Harry entered the dressing room in his red Auror robes, wielding a tray of pastries shaped like golf balls.
“Yes,” Draco decided after taking a moment. She smiled. “I might be better now than I’ve been in a while.”
“Forgive them, Lord,” Lady Cakes lip synced. She was wearing a nun’s habit combined with a black catsuit, launching herself around the pole and landing in the splits. “This is better than sex!”
“I must say,” he frowned, “I had hoped to avoid this type of hassle when I chose not to fly the muggle way.”
“It didn’t work, but Draco being who he is, he was happy to just let me make a fool of myself by talking dirty to his cock in English.”
And yet, this was a competition. Draco needed to compartmentalize these feelings and put his cunning to the sticking place if he wanted to avoid getting sent home in the next challenge. It was time to get back to his Slytherin roots and think strategically about winning.
“I was apprehensive about you, too,” Harry confessed. “But after we started spending time together, I realized just how much you had changed -- how much we
I almost had someone else win the mini challenge since Draco won the last one, but if Draco can’t win a reading challenge, what’s even the point?
Harry grinned. “I know exactly when,” he answered. “We were just sitting quietly in each other’s company, reading books on the couch, and then you took your shoes off.”
“Here I am!” Venus-as-Amelia popped up from behind her desk. “I found a nickel! Drinks are on me!” RuPaul laughed.
Draco blinked. It wasn’t like he could tell the one about the werewolf, the vampire, and the veela who walked into the Three Broomsticks.
“In order for it to work, we need everyone who was nearby when he died to join in a circle.” He pulled out his wand and drew a black circle on the floor, gesturing for the others to stand around it. Potter and Weasley looked to Granger-Weasley, who shrugged back at them, and they joined the circle.
“Oh, ma’am,” Goldie Hanako sighed as she took off her earrings. She paused when she looked at Acacia’s mirror message and let out a loud shriek. “Whaaaaat?!”
But there was no such excuse for cheering up a depressed Steve, forgiving Kali for attempted blackmail, even saving Goldie from a randomly belligerent bigot on the street.
She let out a blood-curdling scream and leaped behind Acacia, then swiveled her around and steered her bodily toward the exit.
“Oh, thanks!” Nicole popped it in her mouth, then cackled without moving her lips. “AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!! How old is ziss?! I ca’t ‘ove ‘y teeth!”
The rest of the pub was deathly quiet. Pansy Parkinson reached over and patted Draco’s arm. Even Granger and Weasley shot him sympathetic glances.
“No, not really. I’m from the UK. Any other Brits here?” she asked, raising her hand. No one answered. “I’m the only one? Excellent! Then I could literally say anything about being British and no one will contradict me.
This was the day of Draco’s hearing before the Wizengamot. He hasn’t heard any more from Harry, only that he had found a lawyer and they were working on the case. London was eight hours ahead. For all he knew, the case had already been settled and Draco’s fate sealed.
“What are you talking about?” Kali Sister asked. “You won the Snatch Game, and you’re not sure if you’re a comedy queen?!”
Harry hooted. Draco chuckled softly. “Right,” Harry began, “It all started with a dirty joke. Draco has always had a thing for Parseltongue, so one day he asked if it would work on trouser snakes--”
“Ivana!” Intoxia Madison cried as she looked at the departed queen’s lipstick message. “I can’t believe she’s gone. She’s such a legend.”
. More people in wizarding Britain expressed sympathy in their letters to the editor after the second episode, arguing that Draco deserved more credit for her performance and wondered what was wrong with her red carpet look, anyway.
“My fellow queens,” RuPaul greeted them with an air of pomp. “Four score and seven queens ago, I wanted
“Now, of all you mediums,” RuPaul continued, “one of you was extra large. The winner of this challenge is...Venus Flygirl!”
“Hi, my name is Draco— I’m from London, England, and I’m 25 years old,” Draco told the camera. In boy garb, he styled his pale blond hair short and parted on the side. He wore a crisp grey button-down shirt and flashed a dazzling smile.
“First of all, I would answer your question with another question,” Kali began. “Why it gotta be white? If I am elected, I will make it my mission to paint that bitch a bold new color for every year of my presidency.”
“Hi, Amelia, we’re so glad to have you back. Did you have an answer for the question? The city of San Francisco is so gay, instead of flags, they hang
fell from Draco’s fingers. His face drained of all color. He looked apprehensively at his phone where it laid on the table next to the dissipating patronus, its cheerful pink kitten case failing to soothe him.
This was exactly why purebloods didn’t like muggleborns entering the wizarding world. They inevitably told their families, who inevitably wanted
“Ah! Now I remember,” she nodded. “Last I heard, I think someone was arguing that it’s a women’s health manual.”
Harry had been horrified, of course. But Draco knew better. Obviously, it was meant to decorate a shelf, not get abused by some grubby-handed child.
It was respectful enough that Draco could forgive her appropriation of a tiara made from chunky amethyst crystals, which was the sign of a graduate of the Salem Witch Institute. Kali had probably borrowed it from her aunt for the occasion.
Draco wondered what would happen if the Wizengamot decided that she couldn’t use Malfoy as a name anymore. Would it just be a ban on professional use? Could she still sign her name as Draco Malfoy on legal documents? Would she need to sit through some complicated ritual designed to magically erase the name from her existence? Would they obliviate her?
(Probably pointless) PSA moment: Smoking is a huge problem in the LGBTQ demographic, especially in the drag community. In the off chance you or anyone you know is trying to quit, here are some resources that might help: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/how_to_quit/resources/index.htm
And just as suddenly, they had left the vehicle lot and barreled down a road in the bright sunlight. Draco only had a moment to marvel at the sight of palm trees before he noticed that there were
The queens dashed to their stations. Draco had learned his lesson from the first time they had to throw on quick drag, and had foregone a workroom outfit covered in buttons. This time, he was wearing an aubergine velvet smoking jacket, untied to show a cropped midnight blue T-shirt that revealed his bare midriff. The shirt featured Draco’s name and constellation in shiny silver detail. He had paired it with dark blue skinny jeans and purple ankle boots.
“I’m not really out to my family,” Goldie confessed. A few queens murmured their concern. “I mean, they know I’m gay, but they don’t know I do drag. I guess I’m gonna have to tell them before they see it on TV.” She sighed.
After the judging, Draco and the other “unsafe” queens — Lady Cakes, Lorena, Paris, Acacia, and Cindy — were sent back to the Untucked lounge while the judges deliberated.
When we were filming Star Wars, I went through the crew like wildfire. I slept with everyone, down to the last stormtrooper.”
The lip sync song is “Bad Romance” by Lady Gaga (not Goggle). I abridged the lyrics, though you can find the full lyrics here (https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ladygaga/badromance.html) and the official music video here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrO4YZeyl0I).
“How do you do, I’m Pernita Simmons,” she said, shaking Draco’s hand. “I’m the defense attorney who was assigned to your case before the Wizengamot.” Draco raised his eyebrows as she laid a thin folder down on the table in front of her and opened it up.
“Oh!” she wheezed, wiping tears from her eyes. “Stays weren’t made for laughing so hard, you evil wench!” This only made Burbage laugh more, until soon Crabbe was laughing, too.
“Let me see that!” Potter frowned. He grabbed the book and leafed through it, his jaw dropping in horror. “Malfoy, how long have you had this book?”
Draco took the small burning stick and examined it up close. The smoke fumes smelled noxious, though they didn’t have the added stale, dead-animal bouquet on the smoking queens’ clothes that occasionally overpowered her when she stood next to them. Interacting with so many smokers really made Draco wish she hadn’t inherited her mother’s sensitive sense of smell.
Lady Cakes shrugged and decided to follow Draco back to his hotel room. Once they got in the door, however, the larger queen shrieked.
Draco felt a sharp pang of loss. Being gone so long from his boyfriend had been harder than he would have anticipated. What he wouldn’t have given to be able to wrap his arms around him, or even just hear that voice for a little bit longer.
“We all gotta come out sooner or later,” Cindy commented. “When you’re a drag queen, there’s no sense in trying to keep anything in the closet. My family doesn’t care, either about the drag or about being trans. My sister helps me sew some of my outfits,” she added. “Draco, how about you?”
Draco considered his little cousin. “Why would you want to go, anyway? It’s just going to be a bunch of grown-ups sitting around watching the episode together. You and I can do that tomorrow when it’s available on Harry’s laptop.”
The Bent Unicorn was filled with a cacophony of hisses, boos, and cries of outrage from former Slytherins. Members of the audience from all other houses — but especially Gryffindors —  laughed loudly.
Her left hand, looking more masculine without the longer, polished nails of her right hand, reached up to her right shoulder and pushed. Draco swiveled with the movement to face the other direction, showing only his left side.
“Now, for this week’s maxi challenge, you will be starring in “Sheroes: The Rusical!” The queens cheered. “You will be split into two teams. Venus and Paris, you won the mini challenge, so you are the team leaders. Come forward and choose which queens will be on your team.” Venus and Paris stepped to the front of the group, standing next to RuPaul.
The smile fell from Courtney’s face. “They’re British,” she deadpanned. “You’ve really never heard of them?”
Lady Cakes sighed. “I was trying to go easy on my left wrist during the live performance, and that messed up the right one.”
This is why he was utterly surprised when he received a howler from the Ministry of Magic’s Department of Overdue and Unpaid Revenue (DOUR).
” Intoxia cried. “At this stage of the competition, we’ve all been cloistered away without any sex in, like,
Draco had no idea what she was going on about. He decided to ignore the comment and press on, however.
“Now, there’s something about you that makes me want to ask — do you feel like a dangerous woman today?”
“What are you watching?” Draco asked as he snuggled into Harry’s side. He frowned at the screen. “This doesn’t look like your bakeoff programme.”
“Yes. Well, cheers. Erm,” Draco blustered. She looked around, trying to figure out what to do instead. She looked to Acacia for ideas, but Acacia looked equally baffled.
“Ha! That’s high praise coming from you. Shall we go join the others? Maybe we can catch up over a firewhiskey. Or have you been going for those pretentious niffler drinks Blaise Zabini has been pushing on everybody at the bar?” Potter laughed again. “I hear he’s working for Highbridge’s these days, so we’re all getting a sales pitch tonight.”
“She’s a bad influence on you,” Draco told his aunt. “What does pottery have anything to do with ghosts, anyway?”
Venus and Draco smiled in relief and exited to the back of the stage to join Lady Cakes, Paris, Goldie, and Steve. Only Lorena, Kali, and Intoxia remained at the front, awaiting sentencing.
“Very Marilyn,” RuPaul cooed as he ushered Draco in front of a green screen. He held up a camera and started taking photos while Draco posed. “Say, ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President!’” RuPaul instructed.
Michelle sighed. “Did you think anything might have been a little off when you saw what the other girls were wearing on the runway?"
“And this is drag!” Michelle countered. “I get that you like being an unpadded queen, but when you come out here as half male, I just see
“Maybe the room will provide—” Goyle started to suggest, but stopped when a rubber chicken materialized in his hand. “—Oh.”
Draco reached for the metal part of the belt, trying not to show his surprise when it stretched enough for him to wrap it in front of himself and fasten it in the slot as requested.
The rest of the queens preened. Kali tried to surreptitiously cough “Draco!” under her breath. Lorena smiled extra sweetly and batted his lashes at Venus.
An hour later, RuPaul entered the werkroom. “Hey there, Kitty Girls! How are things in your Wonder of the World?”
“That information is confidential,” Kong replied. “Anyway, I’ll be lurking around the set in case you need anything. Good luck with this week’s challenge!”
Draco’s mouth dropped. She quickly corrected herself and gave a more dignified nod, albeit with delight shining in her eyes.
“I’m afraid I can’t tell you how to file the taxes,” he continued with an apologetic smile. “I usually send that information off to my accountant.”
Without another word, Draco went back inside and sat silently among the other queens in the Untucked lounge while Acacia and Cindy yelled at each other. Draco wasn’t even paying attention to what the argument was supposedly about. She suspected the ample free cocktails might have had something to do with it, though.
Who’s watching RPDR Season 12? What do you think of all the wild drama so far? I mean, RuPaul’s wearing giant hats again! OMG!!! LOL, I won’t give any real spoilers here, but feel free to comment if you want to get your own opinions out. (And should I have RuPaul wear a big, loud fedora in the next episode of DDR?)
Draco remained quiet throughout the journey back to the hotel. Steve’s mention of the letter was an unfortunate reminder of the bad news he had received from the Ministry of Magic back in Britain. He threw himself onto the bed and pulled it from his pocket to reread the short message.
Draco looked around to see what had set him off. Sitting on the desk chair next to the window was a large barn owl.
“Whaaaaat?!” Draco cried. He gave the magician a baffled look, his eyes popped and jaw dropped. The queens cheered and applauded.
kind of curveball. Everyone knows the team captain is the one who goes home if the group doesn’t pull its shit together. If we end up in the bottom, these bitches better watch out.”
“I’m not going to lie; I didn’t think you had it in you,” Acacia Davenport commented. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I got Sasha Velour!” Steve informed the room delightedly, pulling out a papier-mache crown and a few yards of various types of fabric.
to compete to become America’s next drag superstar. Ask not what your country can drag for you, but what
Draco limped back into the workroom, one heel broken from her savage cake fight. She located her suitcases and moved them to an empty station in front of a mirror. Several queens turned their heads and stared.
“We caught a performance last week, and I’ve been getting advice from some of the kings on how I might form my own act,” Millicent added.
Draco tapped his finger on a notepad. He felt too out of his depth in this conversation, not even knowing how to begin to comprehend muggle “magic.”
“They didn’t think my cornpunk concept was wonderful enough,” sighed Kali. She shot a side eye at Draco, who made a point of ignoring her.
“This bitch,” Paris rolled his eyes. “Who does she think she’s kidding? She must wanna prove something by having me go on after Venus, but she can think again, because I am going to Turn. It. Out.” He snapped his fingers on each of the last three words.
“It’s just a spider,” Draco reasoned in the face of the general chaos into which the room had degenerated. He watched as the others all shunned the unfortunate invertebrate in fear.
“I’m making the most of the resources the Manor has to offer,” Draco sniffed. “And you know my father doesn’t have much to do with me or Scorpius since his house arrest was transferred to the chateau in Burgundy. Anyway, I’m here to talk about Crabbe. Apparently the two of you have been quite chummy since he died.”
Granger-Weasley huffed. “If you were trying to recreate the room as it looked before the fire, I don’t think the room could have made that possible,” she said. “After all, all those contents were destroyed in the fire. The room is probably working exactly as it should.”
A few people in the audience murmured notes that sounded vaguely sympathetic. The whole story had been very public in wizarding Britain, so most people knew at least some of the details already. Rita Skeeter’s quick-quotes quill hurriedly jotted down notes for the next
Draco’s launch into a forward flip took her a bit higher into the air than she had expected. She flipped once, then realized she had enough momentum and flipped a second time, spinning in a little ball until she landed on her feet and slid into the splits.
After what felt like forever, the queens finally entered the werkroom to start their day of filming Episode 4. They engaged in some idle chitchat before RuPaul’s voice filled the room.
The other queen smiled. “You still look like you’re sad about something. Need a magical black woman to help you fix your shit?”
“No, Ru, and I’ll keep it real with you,” Intoxia-as-Carrie-Fisher replied. “I’m a female...in Hollywood...over a certain age...and dead. There aren’t a lot of job offers for me to choose from.”
“Oh!” Goyle snapped his fingers. “Now that I think about it, there was something about a prophecy about you at Hogwarts, wasn’t there? Maybe you could be on the lookout for Wife Number Two! But at our age, I guess you’re not going to find someone young enough at the reunion, eh? We’ve all aged out of that demographic, haven’t we?” He winked.
“Really!” Draco scoffed. “Tell us more about how unhappy you are with RuPaul while the cameras are running, sweetie. I wouldn’t be surprised if Ru sends her home just for that! Besides, I actually think it’s quite cunning, using this platform in such a way, and I’m not just saying that to toady up to the boss, either.”
“Lorena is really turning it out in this lip sync,” Venus said, as the camera showed the two queens waving their arms and emoting to the lyrics with everything they had. “But Kali’s serving some serious choreography. I think this is gonna be really close to call.”
“Let’s take it from—” Ross looked at the script they had given him “—’one bite will have you moaning in delight.’”
“Um, I just want to say that I think I would be a good president,” Goldie said. “Our country needs a makeover, and I’m...gonna give it one. If elected.” She smiled nervously and shrugged.
“We did at that,” Draco breathed. He blinked again, slowly. Maybe there wasn’t any harm in seeing where this could go, was there? Maybe he could have a fling without worrying about love.
“All right then.” Draco turned her head and called over her shoulder. “Bernadette! We’ve got a live one for you!” She turned back to the phone. “She’s interested, but she says it’ll cost extra if you want the full slap and tickle.”
“Draco, I love a slutty schoolgirl look as much as the next person, but the dark green and gray look a little drab,” Michelle told her. “I mean, gray on gray? You could have made this outfit pop with some brighter accent colors. Red and gold could have been so much more flattering.”
Within an hour, Draco had posted tweets condemning the attacks and supporting his sisters, and set Mariah Thomas up as his social media manager. He would pay extra for the service, but it was worth it to have someone else sift through the noise in order to stay on top of the important messages. Besides, Draco had started getting more paying gigs at muggle drag shows around the country, and had even had some modeling and advertising offers in the last week. He could afford to outsource some of the online work.
The rest of the ride became a blur of fast-paced vehicles and short buildings spaced far apart by the roadside as Draco gripped the armrests of his chair, white-knuckled. Dave calmly pressed a button on the front of the vehicle and music started playing. The music was equally foreign and did nothing to soothe Draco’s nerves.
His level of annoyance climbed even higher when he realized he would have to wait on the person behind him in line to finish up with the agent before she returned her attention to him.
“He didn’t mention anything about that,” Draco frowned. “He wants me to help him move on to...well, whatever happens to ghosts when they stop being ghosts.”
Draco wrinkled her nose and wiped the message away immediately. “Not hardly,” she sniffed. “I am now more determined than ever to stay in the game. Besides, it’s ‘you’re,’ not ‘your.’”
The song ended, and Lorena and Kali posed on the stage, panting for breath while the judges and queens applauded.
In that spirit (no pun intended — okay, maybe just a little), he tolerated her attention. Part of him even welcomed her concern for his welfare.
Draco sauntered into the werkroom and struck a pose, arms akimbo and looking at the camera through lavender-rimmed sunglasses.
“Fascinating. I tip my hat to you for keeping up with all their muggle names and brands. I know I can’t remember them all half as well as you.”
“I thought she was funny,” Ross commented. “She slipped a little, but she was unique and I liked that.”
“Our twenty-four-year Hogwarts reunion. I know, I know—” he held up his hands in surrender, “I technically didn't stay back for an eighth year like the rest of you, but Blaise, Theo, Pansy, and the rest are all going. Might be fun to get the gang back together.”
With the blink of an eye, Draco was no longer Draco the Drag Queen, but Former Death Eater Draco. And regardless of losing the right to legally call himself a Malfoy, he had twenty-five years of pure Malfoy attitude packed behind his icy glare.
Draco snorted. He was sure that Millicent wouldn’t mind taking some of Draco’s potential tips, either. However, what she said was true. The Letters to the Editor section of their local wizarding rag still included its own subsection of people writing in to complain about Draco’s existence on a public muggle television show.
“Draco, we need to talk about that killer lip sync! How do you feel?” Goldie asked as she pulled off her heels and threw them across the room.
Draco nodded. If the entire contraption wasn’t the microphone, then he must have meant the short, fat, wandlike stick on top. Draco pulled it out of its holder and held it like a wand, pressing the thinner end to his throat.
Draco blinked. The boys all looked at her — even Harry and Weasley had dropped their jaws and blushed. Apparently the Gryffindor boys hadn’t thought of the Silencing charm, either, which threw the girls into yet another fit of laughter.
“All right, DJ,” RuPaul announced after they all returned back to the empty space on one side of the workroom. “Hit it!”
Granger-Weasley nodded, then turned to Potter. “Harry, we’re going to burn the book. Care to do the honors?”

“Draco,” Venus approached him as he was trying on his yellow plaid outfit to make adjustments. “I was wondering if we could go over some of your Cher characterizations.”
“Wait,” Kali interrupted. “What you’re saying is that both Steve and I saw owls, and one of them did something to Draco, but now we don’t remember?”
Eventually, the queens were sent backstage to the Untucked lounge, where Team Paris were cackling madly at a silly gesture Cindy was making with her headdress. The laughter died as they picked up on the tense mood of the other queens, who each grabbed a drink and joined them in the lounge. Lady Cakes appeared to struggle to pick up her glass, and ended up abandoning it on the coffee table, laying her hands gently on her lap.
“I’ve brought Bianca del Rio here today to help give you some pointers on your stand-up routines,” RuPaul explained. The pair went from table to table and talked to each queen in turn.
was an honorific,” he explained. “I thought she was like The Lady of Cakes. But actually, it’s a descriptor. It’s the
Later, in the Untucked Lounge, the queens discussed the critiques they had been given. Kali was unable to disguise her glee at having received enough praise this week that she didn’t fear for her own safety.
Those in the audience who were either muggleborn or had some familiarity with muggle magic tricks (hello, George Weasley) burst into laughter at Draco’s reaction to seeing a trick for the first time.
He cracked open the door of his room, checking to make sure no one was watching, then snuck down the hall to where Lady Cakes was staying. It was very handy that so many of the queens had decorated their hotel room doors with performance photos so he knew exactly where to go.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t get racism,” he muttered. “Of all the things to judge someone for, why pick skin color?”
“Welcome to Snatch Game!" RuPaul addressed the camera. "Let’s meet our contestants! Our first contestant is a beauty and a little woman who’s all grown up, Emma Watson!” Emma smiled and waved hello.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, my platform is based on teamwork. Vote for me, a good old-fashioned drag queen, and I will
“Ladies, I’ve made my decision. Lorena Gucci, Chanté, you stay.” Lorena bent forward and supported her hands on her knees. When she stood upright again, she pressed her hands together in prayer. Intoxia looked at her sadly and clapped. “You may join the other girls.” Lorena hugged Intoxia before walking to the back of the stage.
been this quiet,” Venus said. The camera panned across the werkroom to show everyone seated at tables, heads bent over notebooks and tapping their pens. “Everyone is digging deep inside their brains trying to come up with something funny. No pressure!” He laughed nervously.
Draco hesitated, then finally decided that she didn’t have anything in the book that would violate the Statute of Secrecy, and handed it over. Lady Cakes took the book and began reading.
As the remaining queens closed out the episode by dancing on the runway to one of RuPaul’s latest singles (now available on iTunes), Draco’s mind couldn’t help but stray back to the letter.
“We have a winner!” RuPaul announced. The queens cheered. Draco beamed and curtseyed, slightly out of breath.
Lady Cakes sighed and held out the wrist in question. Draco gently peeled off the glove only to find a wrist brace underneath.
“Draco!” Blaise Zabini walked up to the pair of them and shook Draco’s hand. Zabini was one of the few members of their class who had managed to dodge wrinkles and graying hair, though Draco strongly suspected that liberal applications of hair-dying and wrinkle-blasting potions were at play, judging by the waxy appearance of Zabini’s skin. His robes were in the style popular with Scorpius’ age group — which would have been perfectly acceptable on someone twenty years younger, but looked just a bit ridiculous at their age. Even Lucius had never been so vain.
Draco ended the call and carefully eased out of the hearth, his knees complaining. Once he stood up, his thoughts drifted back to the idea of a Hogwarts reunion and seeing Potter again, and he smacked his palm against his forehead.
While they were talking, Granger casually strolled over to Draco’s costume racks and examined them. She held up a small red dress with a white collar. “Are you really going to play Little Orphan Annie?”
Draco sat at the vanity in the green room at the Bent Unicorn, applying makeup. After the previous episode had been reviewed in
Draco dried his hands on a paper towel and said nothing. It never occurred to him that he might meet a muggle who knew about magic during the competition. He didn’t need this kind of complication in his life.
Draco waved her off. Inwardly, she was relieved that these three aurors had let her off the hook so easily. And compared to Heather Villareal’s manners, they were almost downright pleasant.
“Right,” Draco answered. “Now, if you will excuse me, I must get back to the hotel and ready for today’s challenge.” With that, he swept back down to the ground below and apparated back.
Kali cried out in dismay when a ball hit him on the hip as she spun around. Soon, it was down to just Draco and Venus. The game intensified now that six men had fewer targets to aim at.
“Ta,” Draco sniffed and took a sip from her cocktail. “Really, you all should know I don’t hold it against you. Well,
” he commented as he painted thick color swatches across Goldie’s eyelids. The other queen’s lids twitched.
Kali nodded glumly. “That Snatch Game was brutal, but I feel like they liked my outfit on the runway, at least.” She fiddled with her beaded veil. “I’m giving them Bollywood bling realness. RuPaul even gasped when she saw my Padmavaat, so who knows? I’m hoping it helped.”
” Intoxia-as-Carrie-Fisher held up her card. “You should always take your prescription medication, RuPaul.”
“Now, you have twenty minutes to get into your most divine quick drag. Your makeup stations have been stocked with makeup supplied by Salmon Buffet.”
“I look up and I see Draco wandering around the room and playing with a feather,” Paris explained. “And I think, ‘What the hell is this bitch doing?’ We’re supposed to be writing jokes for our stand-up routines!”
After his fourth year at Hogwarts, when the Dark Lord had risen again, Draco had been given this opportunity over his summer holiday to
“Well. I’ll have these files delivered to your hotel room,” Simmons said, and got up from the table. She stopped at the door, turning back to him. “I really am sorry.” With that, she was gone.
“Oh my God!” Goldie exclaimed, sitting next to him. He placed a protective hand on Draco’s wrist, moving so quickly that Draco jumped from the sudden contact. “Are you okay?”
“Oh, good,” Vilanch drawled. “I thought for a second you couldn’t tell us apart. Though I could see how someone might mistake me for him, since we look so much alike.”
“Yesss, dear, show us the tea!” RuPaul called out as Draco sat on the couch and picked up a cup and saucer, daintily raising the cup with a pinky finger extended gracefully. Draco posed for several shots with the tea set, pretending to pour a cup, pretending to sip with lips puckered over the rim in a flirty pout. Mike Ruiz kept taking shot after shot and RuPaul shouted out encouragement.
This week: it's time for a BALL! And a lot of other stuff happens. This was initially going to be a shorter chapter.
“Old women? Hmm. Draco, you’re being awfully quiet,” Paris commented. “What do you think? What kind of trio should we be?”
Late that night, Draco sipped at his cognac as he thought about the prophecy and the ensuing conversation at dinner in the Great Hall.
“Now, it’s time for the judges’ critiques. Draco, tell us about your cosplay look on the runway,” RuPaul asked.
He sighed and downed his drink. Maybe he could slip away and take care of another reason for coming back to this blasted school.
“Condragulations, ladies! You’ve each won a $1500 gift card for custom jewels by Disco Jazzle!” Paris and Venus beamed in delight.
Underneath Draco’s pith helmet was a light-brown wig pulled into a loose braid down her back. She had attached Courtney Act’s stuffed koala to the braid so Ursa Minor was indeed along for the ride, complete with her own matching outfit, braid, and pith helmet.
“For today’s mini challenge,” RuPaul began, “I want to know which of you are the best dancers at RuPaul’s Drag Race. It is time to bust out some of your best moves in a good old-fashioned dance-off...country style!” He told them excitedly. “Now, you have fifteen minutes to get into your best quick-drag country realness. And, GO!”
Draco pursed her lips and leaned back against the railing. If ever she had a moment when she might have wished for something to take the edge off her stress, this would have been it. She looked back at Ivana and almost asked for another hit of her cigarette, before she remembered the burning and the Room of Requirement. And the stench. No, that wasn’t an option.
Kai had, to her credit, not tried to create a witch look with warts, green skin, dripping blood, cobwebs, or other nonsense that the other queens had incorporated. She had instead opted for a bohemian-chic look with billowing, gauzy fabrics.
“Get your own,” Potter answered more coldly than Draco would have expected, holding the napkin out of Goyle’s reach. And did he actually give Goyle the stinkeye?
“Oh, honey.” Lady Cakes enveloped him in a great bear hug. Suddenly, the rest of the queens piled themselves on as well. Draco had never felt himself the center of such a tight throng of people.
. Steve, who was still wearing tap shoes, proceeded to tap dance all over the stage as she lip synced. Lady Cakes chose to stay in one place most of the time, but served as much face as she could, emoting everything into her lip sync.
It had started with healing Lady Cakes’ wrists — which, while helping the other queen stay in the game, admittedly had strategic value, endearing one of the strongest queens on the show into helping Draco survive as much as he had. It was that act of niceness that had led Lady Cakes to team up with Draco in the challenge which they had won together — in large part thanks to Lady Cakes’ own comedic chops.
“Kali Sister, tonight on the runway, you command attention. But in the magic act, you...disappeared. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
The pair proceeded to go from table to table, asking each queen about their campaign slogans. Draco overheard them discussing phrases like student loan forgiveness, taxing the wealthy, and other concepts that didn’t fit easily into his reality.
“Gather ‘round, ladies!” RuPaul called after everyone was finished and changed. “Now, the results have come in, and with just a few hanging chads —” a few queens snickered — “We have a winner: Paris Davenport!”
RuPaul moved on to the next queen. “Now, it’s time to introduce a princess from a galaxy far away, Carrie Fisher!” Intoxia-as-Carrie-Fisher waved. “Tell me something,” RuPaul said. “As the star of a legendary movie franchise, did it take some convincing for you to come here on our show today?”
Her blonde wig was pulled up into a tall ponytail and she had added palm-sized rhinestone snake earrings. Her fingernails were hot pink and several inches too long to expect a passing grade in Snape’s Potions class. On her feet, she wore six-inch black heels instead of the typical flats that girls wore at Hogwarts. The knee-high socks, ironically, were standard issue.
“Oi, Uncle Harry and Draco?” A young, twentysomething boy with bright red hair gave them a wicked grin. “Grampa George said to ask you about Stefan.”
Finally, Draco, Goldie, and Paris entered the stage wearing tight pink cardigans over glitter-covered gold corsets and panties. They twirled around to reveal the backs of the cardigans, which each had a mishmash of Greek letters.
When the queens reentered the werkroom after the last challenge, they saw Steve Donovan’s lipstick message on the mirror.
Draco was given a bunch of grapes. “Ooh, pucker those lips!” RuPaul told her. “Those must be some sour grapes! Werrrrrk!”
?” The idiot blinked at him in confusion. He apparently hadn’t expected any of them to actually confront him. His friend remained silent and watched the two of them, smirking.
That night, the runway challenge was Signs of the Zodiac. When it was Draco’s turn, she stopped in the doorway that framed the entrance from backstage, striking a pose in profile. Her right side faced the judges and revealed a long, sparkling silver gown that graced the floor on either side of a long slit up to her hip, showing off leg for days. The gown hugged her lithe frame around the middle to show off a shapely backside and tiny waist. Her arm gracefully extended in front of her, encased in a long, sheer sleeve studded with tiny crystals. The gown had a high neckline that showcased her naturally long, swanlike neck. She wore her hair in a pale blonde chignon gathered just to the right side of her nape.
“Americans,” Draco began, “Whilst I have been in your country for just a short time, I must say, your democracy is a sham. Oh, yes! I’ve learned about your electoral college and it is, quite frankly, broken. You’ve gotten yourselves into a right mess, haven’t you? Vote for me, Draco, because you could certainly do worse.”
The next morning, Draco’s alarm woke him up at five. It was a miserable hour to be up, but it would give him a little time to get some exercise before he had to be on set for the next episode. He quickly got dressed, grabbed his broom, thought about the destination as it had been described in the travel book, and disapparated.
“Werk!” A young queen with Asian features and a turquoise wig snapped her fingers above her head. “Are you British?”
“Hello to you too,” he raised an eyebrow at them as he set down his contouring brush and picked up the paper to examine it. Teddy peered excitedly over his shoulder. “‘King of Clubs at Royal Vauxhall Tavern,’” he read.
Previously on DDR: Draco gets caught in a Twitter flame war, teaches how to make a hangover potion on a cooking show challenge, loses his court case along with the right to call himself a Malfoy, faces down a bigot when the queens sneak out for a bar crawl, gets an Untucked message from home, and lip syncs for her life.
There was also Ivana Mann, a fifty-something queen with a sarcastic sense of humor, Lady Cakes McMansion (possibly the largest person—let alone queen—Draco had ever met), a self-professed “drug culture superheroine” queen named Intoxia Madison, another plus-sized queen named Cindy Sanchez, Acacia Davenport (Draco practically had to plug her ears at the intense shrieking that happened when Paris found out her drag sister was joining her), a South Asian queen named Kali Sister who had a punk aesthetic, Queenie Q (Draco couldn’t remember much except that she was from Seattle), and a Texas-based pageant queen named Carmelita Corazon.
“Tomorrow on the main stage, you will have a debate so that America can decide how to cast their votes in our new Frock the Vote challenge. You should have a campaign slogan, and a strong idea what kind of platform you’re running on, so that you can field questions from our panelists in the debate.
Kali Sister guffawed. “Did she really draw a dick on the mirror?” Venus shook her head and immediately wiped it off.
“Thanks in advance,” Crabbe said. “Maybe I’ll see you on the other side — whatever that is.” He grinned, shook out his ghostly limbs, then gave him the thumbs-up sign.
. He still wasn’t quite used to it, but the more it happened, the more he wondered why he had lived so long without it.
“I’d like to think I did well with what I had available,” Draco sniffed, adjusting the skirt of her chiton.
Draco didn’t answer. He could easily think of several possible things that could go wrong by telling an audience of muggles about his life experiences. Should he tell them about the bigotry, the bullying, or the atrocities he had committed as a Death Eater?
But how to keep this queen in her place? Draco thought quickly and eyed the set around them. A thought occurred to her. It was childish and lowbrow, but so were a lot of other things she had witnessed in American muggle culture. Maybe it would work.
“Sign this tax form which will go to the Ministry,” Malfoy instructed, pointing at a line at the bottom of a roll of parchment as Harry dipped his quill into the inkpot. The desk was covered in various sheets of parchment awaiting Harry’s signatures.
“Indeed!” RuPaul laughed. “Listen, I have to tell you that I’m not seeing where you’re going with this yet.”
“Everybody has to pay taxes, mate,” Ron said, knocking out one of Harry’s pawns with his rook. Harry sighed.
He didn’t have time to process what was happening before a highly polished pair of black shoes and pressed wool trousers stepped out of the floo. Harry looked up and wished he could go back in time and never let this scenario ever happen.
This wasn’t going to work. It wasn't too late to turn around and leave; no one had yet seen him. His hand hovered in front of the door when it suddenly swung open.
Courtney raised her eyebrows. “Really, that long!” Draco frowned. “This must be quite a grand adventure for you,” Courtney continued. “Well, if you need help, I suppose I could offer a few suggestions for how we might approach this photo shoot.”
“You may join the other girls,” RuPaul continued. Draco bowed in gratitude and walked to the back of the stage. Goldie gave her a hug.
When he had first arrived, Draco couldn’t help fangirling over the reality of meeting RuPaul and the other queens. She had even fangirled over meeting Courtney Act — at least, until everything became a chocolate-smeared blur of cakefighting, sabotaged Secret Santa gifts, and poor drag choices. Hopefully, what Draco had lost in terms of Courtney Act’s goodwill would be worth it if audiences would remember her despite her lack of prior fame in the business.
Draco pulled Harry’s letter from her bosom and showed it to her. Kali’s eyebrows raised in surprise. Intoxia Madison peered over her shoulder.
Draco swiveled his head around to the source of the voice. Potter — beautiful, unfairly sexy Potter — was standing right next to him, holding a tiny sausage on a cocktail napkin. Draco blinked.
thunder,” Draco explained, then smiled sweetly. “This task is about showing I can do something that will get people to remember who I am. I’m Draco—! And if there’s anything I know, it’s how to make a lasting impression.”
“But it really felt like death, and he also said that if I wanted, I could take a train and move on — so maybe the jury’s still out on that one,” Potter continued, still having an odd, one-sided conversation with the ceiling.
“Honestly!” Granger-Weasley huffed, and raised her wand again, but Draco transfigured the chicken into a candle before she could do the honors. He couldn’t let her show him up in Transfiguration twice in one night.
Soon enough, Draco’s makeup was finished and she dressed in a tweed skirt and burnt sienna silk blouse, a honey-blonde wig pulled away from her face in pinned ringlets and starlet curls.
After what felt like an eternity of sitting around the Untucked lounge listening to queens argue about each other’s outfits, they were all called back to the main stage. Draco resumed her place at the front of the stage with the other top and bottom queens of the week. She applauded politely when Goldie Hanako was announced as the winner of the sewing challenge. Lady Cakes McMansion and Venus Flygirl were both safe.
“It’s amazing what they can do without magic,” Draco admitted. “There’s so much strategy involved. So much cunning — not just with creating the look, but in how they rise to a new challenge on the show in each episode.”
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders and answered, “RuPaul’s Drag Race. It’s an American reality competition show about drag queens.”
“For today’s mini challenge, I’m taking you to a concert!” The queens cheered. “More specifically, the concert just ended.” The queens booed. “I want you to try to get into the special backstage VIP lounge of the hottest girl group of 1990, Seduction — featuring Michelle Visage. I wonder whatever happened to her!” The queens laughed.
“Well, this isn’t exactly the first time we’ve had a red carpet runway challenge on this show,” RuPaul countered.
Courtney posed, looking directly at the camera and alternating between sultry expressions and unadulterated duckface. Behind her back, Draco picked up a handful of cake from the tea table. “You’re looking gorgeous! Keep it up!” Draco told her encouragingly.
being mean!” And before anyone could react, she grabbed her drink and threw it in Lorena’s face, then stormed out of the room.
