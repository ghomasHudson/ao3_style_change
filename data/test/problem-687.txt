Harry was taken aback when Farley gave a humourless laugh. "You are better off protecting yourselves first. He is dangerous, he can defeat your army with a flick of his wand."
"Yeah." Harry replied with a frown.
"You tell me to be careful, Farley tells me to be careful, all of that bastard's lackeys tell me to be careful. And yet I do what I wish." Harry said.
"What is?" Draco asked, his attention still on Potter's hair.
Two more deaths had been reported in the town of Purely. The residents of the town were terrified and some of them had started to leave the place but most of them didn't have enough money to buy a new one somewhere else hence they were forced to stay.
Harry gasped and twitched and writhed but not once did he scream, no he wouldn't scream, he was tougher than that. He wouldn't give his torturer the satisfaction of seeing him howl in pain, begging for mercy, damn right he won't.
It was Potter and he was a sight to behold. His hair was even more messed up than usual, standing up on every end. Bags were prominent under his eyes and his eyelids were drooping but his eyes were alert and at the moment, they were resting on Draco.
"Give me your hand." Pansy takes out something, probably a bracelet, from practically nowhere with lots of little chains, bands and spikes, sliding it on my outstretched wrist.
"Oh, no, there isn't a problem. Just…you remember the morning, right?" The guy asked, ignoring Draco's presence except for a cordial nod in the healer's direction.
"Uhhh.. what do you suggest?"
That was the Chapter! I'm sorry for the late updates but I hardly get time to write.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut against the throbbing in his head. The words were swirling around in his head; Dreadful. Poisonous. Deadly.
"So.. how's your arm now?" Potter smiled and I would've frozen all over again had it not been for the liquid courage I had gotten.
"I'm Draco Malfoy." Draco introduced himself to the man although he had no doubt the librarian knew he was already.
Draco was taken aback by the intensity the man's face held but he replied swiftly, "I didn't damage it, Sir. However, I hope we could talk in private."
"Uh- sorry." Potter whispered sheepishly. Then they apparated back to the Ministry.
They walked towards the apparition point in silence for a while. Just as they were about to apparate, Potter's loud voice broke the quiet.
Harry rolled his eyes, of course Malfoy would say that. "How very Slytherin." He mocked in good humour.
good after all." Draco hated the hope in his mother's voice.
The glare in the librarian's eyes intensified, "Did you damage it? If you did, then get ready to pay back for it, young man. These books are too precious for irresponsible men like you to ruin."
Harry nodded in reply and Accioed a file with "CONFIDENTIAL" written on it with block letters. He opened the page with the case description and was about to tell Malfoy about it but he was rudely interrupted.
"Asper?" Draco asked.
The house was partly demolished, and the Aurors found more dead bodies inside. As they investigated further, they noticed a strange red liquid in one of the cauldrons. It wasn’t enough to determine the ingredients used in the potion. After running it through a few potioneers, they had determined that it was highly fatal, and the ingredients used were unknown. Only one vial of the potion remained. Kingsley had asked Harry to search the house, look for the suspect and investigate the last vial. Harry knew that was why he needed a partner; he was rubbish at potions.
The statement activates another train of thought similar to the previous one and Draco feels himself become redder but he does as told. Taking a deep breath he tries to banish the images his mind had so kindly supplied him with.
It was true, when, during the trial Lucius was given a choice to either live in house arrest with his family or spend ten years in Azkaban, his choice had surprised everyone in the room. Draco still remembers his exact words; still remembers how they had sliced his vulnerable heart into two.
"Guys, it's me! Harry!" He shouted desperately, his voice cracking. This time there was a reply but not from someone Harry wanted one from.
Thank you to everyone who left kudos! Please comment what you think, I'd be very grateful. I couldn't wait to post chapter 2 so here it is!!
Potter laughed richly, a laugh so carefree and so lovely, I could hear it for the rest of my life.
Harry frowned. Draco was never nervous. Well he was nervous on their first date, and the first time they went to the Burrow but he mostly acted like this when something was very wrong or bothering him alot.
"I thought you were supposed to be a brave Gryffindor, yet you needed her help to make a move?" I said cleverly.
The door opened and she entered. "Harry, Mr. Shacklebolt is requesting your presence in his office in a few minutes.”
Kingsley chuckled, "I can't guarantee you that you won't have any injuries but I can assure you that you won't die. Auror P- our most capable Auror would always put your life above his own."
"Yeah, I’ll get going." Harry stood up, waving his wand to arrange the disorderly mess of files and quills on his table.
"It hurts. Everywhere." He gasped in between ragged breaths.
So to summarise Harry was very tired and very mad. He pushed his glasses on his head and rubbed his eyes. Sitting on his living room couch with a cup of Draco's handmade hot chocolate was a little more relaxing but Harry's mood was still bitter.
~~~●●●~~~
"Ripped, huh?" He gave Draco
get somewhere, Malfoy.
like Malfoy.
Malfoy sags in relief and looks at his mother with a small smile on his face Harry has never seen before. His mother smiles back then stands up.
"Your own loss."
But Harry knew it was no use to argue with Kingsley. The Minister had somehow manipulated all of them but not Harry. He had fought from being controlled by the Dark Lord; a mere corrupt wizard was nothing compared to him.
They were large, one at the pulse point of the neck and both wrists. The circular gashes were so deep Draco could see the damaged veins lining the skin. Dried blood ringed the circumference of the wound. Around it was the greenish tinge Draco had seen in the picture. He had assumed it was rotten flesh but now that he looked closely, he realized it was something else entirely.
"Harry?" Draco looked up from his reading to look at Potter as a male voice echoed through the Senior Auror's office along with a knock on the door.
about Potter. He was just...just.. well, if Potter was dead who knew what the Dark wizard would do?
"Why should they?" Potter raised an eyebrow.
"Ughh. Just shut up, Draco." Pansy rolled her eyes as we reached the drinks table. There were alot of red cups, some filled with butterbeer, some with firewhisky and others with some muggle drinks I had seen Pansy drink.
With a flick of his wand, the librarian lit a few lamps in the room.
to go. There isn't a choice."
"You owe me, Harry, remember that." Narcissa says.
How dare Malfoy suggest such a thing? Who did he think the Aurors were? Yes, a lot of them had died while serving the right cause but that didn't mean they would willingly sacrifice their soldiers for such a simple cause as testing a potion. Most of them (mainly Harry himself) were pretty reckless and served on adrenaline but they weren't suicidal. Harry wouldn't let anyone believe or state otherwise (which many people did).
"Oh..umm..well.. he kinda had a panic attack and I comforted him so we just.. ummm.." Harry had no idea how to continue.
respect Mother's opinions and suggestions.
I was about to pour myself a glass of water when my houself, Peety, hurried in.
Draco had never really noticed before but Potter's atrocious hair was actually made of black curls that looked unbelievably soft. They reminded Draco of his favourite peacock quill. He always loved to write with it because of the soft feathers it had. Draco's gaze dropped to Potter's forehead where a single curl lay innocently. It was so long that it tickled till his eyes. Potter's unbelievably long eyelashes blinked rapidly, trying to keep away the single lock of hair. Draco's fingers itched to push the curl away.
Kingsley smiled, "We, Aurors, take an oath before we start working, Mr. Malfoy. We pledge that it'd be an honour for us if we die fighting for the betterment of the Wizarding World. Our top priority is to complete our mission first and foremost, regardless of our physical condition or our amount of will to serve."
"Enter." The deep voice echoed.
Harry knew Malfoy was having a panic attack. He had experienced many of those to recognize one. Malfoy's breathing was ragged, his body trembling with tears leaking from his eyes over his overly pale cheeks. He was whispering nonsense but Harry could make out a few words such as "sorry" and "please". Harry now felt very very guilty. First he had lashed out on Malfoy due to his own feelings, then he hadn't paid much attention to teaching him and now Harry had made him have a bloody panic attack. Harry desperately attempted to comfort Malfoy. Seeing Malfoy like this and knowing he was the cause of it made Harry's heart clench and his stomach sink.
I'll try to post the new chapter as soon as I can. ♡♡
"So you want to live as a squib."
"You requested to see me, Kingsley?" Harry asked, not taking a seat yet.
He saw a tiny bit of fear creep in Malfoy's eyes. Good. He wanted him to know that it wouldn't do him any good to disrespect him or his job.
He had investigated the potion evacuated by the Ministry but it was in such a small amount that he had made hardly any progress. So he decided to solve the mystery of the green paste first instead but he wasn't getting anywhere with it either.
"Great." Harry opened a drawer, took out a random file. Anything to distract him from that expression on Malfoy's face. It made him uncomfortable, though Harry didn't know why.
Kreacher beams and disapparates. Harry turns to Draco and his Mother, "Uh-sorry about that.. Kreacher has umm... a tendency to say.. umm.. a little too much."
"As you've seen, Mr. Malfoy, two more dead bodies have been found in the same house as before." Kingsley spoke, drawing Draco's attention away from the unsettling image.
Draco's day had been going perfectly fine until a particularly natty barn owl tapped on his office window. With a frown he let it in and untied the letter from it's leg.
"Not now, Mother. Even though the aurors will be protecting me, I believe I am not that much of a weakling to not be able face any danger myself. I did survive in a house full of Dark wizards, after all." He saw Mother go pale at his words, her mouth opening to respond to his remark but Draco apparated without waiting for her disappointed chiding.
"Uh..umm.. do you want to.. uhh.. dance?" Potter stuttered out. Then as if he just realized what he had said, his eyes widened and he opened his mouth, then closed it again like a fish. I would've laughed at him had my own mouth not dropped open too. Potter was asking me to
Draco could only stare at them until Kingsley's voice brought him back to reality. "Go ahead." He gestured towards the bodies and stepped back.
He shouted everyone's names but no one even looked in his direction. He tried to run forward instead but his feet wouldn't obey him.
"I-I'm sorry, Auror Potter, I haven't come by this precious object."
Draco stared as Potter picked at Draco's food with his fork, his appetite seemed to have vanished suddenly. Draco frowned, he hadn't meant to offend Potter or anything.
Potter has changed. For the better. His shoulders are broad, his arms muscular,his tee shirt stretches over his muscled chest, showing his lean six pack and tan skin. His eyes are as green as ever behind the glasses he has changed from black to thin gold wired ones. His hair is long and is tied in a very sexy bun on his head.
"Thank you, Harry. I love it." She smiles at me and I smile back.
Draco's mouth seemed to move at it's own accord, "You look like shit, Potter." His eyes widened in realization at what he had just said and he scrambled to take it back somehow. "I-I meant that..you d-don't look well, Auror Potter."
"So may I have this dance?" Harry asked feigning boldness he wasn't feeling at all.
"Why not? This is important and
was behind that shabby wooden door.
"I believe you owe me a favour, Harry" She finally said.
"Now try to feel your magic."
"What are the details of this case?" Draco asked, hoping to get more information about what he was agreeing to (or disagreeing to).
Draco hoped Potter hadn't heard his remark but of course the git did. He was observant at all the wrong times.
"Alright. I was wondering whether we could..umm.. you know how Mother is all alone and Father is very ill?" Draco asks. Harry does know that and Draco goes to the Malfoy Manor every week so Harry literally has no idea where Draco's going with this. Harry rubs his temples then continues to write.
Draco's eyes widen as he looks at his left arm, now free of the hideous Mark.
"Come on, let's just go eat somewhere. We've been here for ages." Potter got up but didn't move forward when Draco kept sitting.
"Goddamit!" Harry's shout cuts Draco off. Ink was now covering the whole parchment Harry's report was written on.
had been saying. I felt Pansy gasp beside me but Potter took no notice of her.
Draco gave a soft knock on the door of the Head Healer. "Come in!" The reply came.
I sigh. Both of those statements are true.
Inside was a wide room, it was dark inside until Kingsley lit the lamps with a wave of his wand. Draco looked around; the walls and floor were wooden. A huge table was in the middle and at the far wall behind it was a shelf stretching from one end to the other. It had tiny vials that Draco recognized instantly as potion ingredients. Kingsley went towards a far cupboard that Draco hadn't noticed before. He traced another pattern on it that Draco didn't see and the door opened.
Potter looked up from Draco's plate, "I know. It's just – forget it. I'm not hungry anymore. We should go." He gestured at the waiter for their bill. Draco had absolutely no idea why Potter was acting this way. He had looked hungry a few minutes before.
"Potter? What's wrong?" Draco absolutely did not like the expression on Potter's face at the moment. He looked vulnerable, sad, like a child. Draco had never witnessed Potter look anything besides confident or sure of himself but at the moment, he looked the complete opposite. Back in the days, Draco would've made fun of Potter for behaving like a little kid but now all it did was unnerve him.
"So you haven't made any progress with the potion or the paste, right?" Potter stopped walking and turned to face Draco.
They continued kissing and stopped only when breathing became a problem. Draco stared in Harry's eyes, while Harry stared back.
"How is your magic now?" Blaise asked, probably trying to stop a fight from breaking out between Draco and Pansy.
"It's in the past. Forget it. Now where's Draco?" I ask and Pansy forgets the sombre mood. She runs out and instructs me to stay near the drinks and wait for Draco, then disappears in the crowd.
Draco wasn't angry. He was upset, very very upset. Harry felt his heart break at Draco's cries. He ran as fast as he could into their room and engulfed Draco in his arms.
Harry was stunned at that. It reminded him of Voldemort; the way people talked about him, as if his name alone was taboo, he was merciless, killing anyone in his way. The thought certainly wasn't comforting.
"I'll take the sayur lodeh." Malfoy handed the waiter the menu back.
"Yeah.. well both are going to be awkward." Harry says, trying to find an easy way out.
"Have you made much progress?" She asked, trying to hide her smile. She wanted her son to be happy, he did deserve it after all.
Unfortunately, his focus was disturbed by an inhumane rumbling sound. Draco jerked in surprise, looking around for the possible cause of it. Had the Dark wizard somehow entered the Ministry?
Draco scowled at everyone as he walked through the Ministry even though anyone hardly paid him attention but a man's gotta keep his reputation upright.
"Oh. Okay then. Here, give me your hand." Draco spoke but it seemed as if Potter wasn't hearing him. His head was now bent, his breathing still short.
"Y-your name?"
"I tried to apparate first, actually but when I couldn't, I thought it was because of my time in seclusion so I side-alonged with mother."
Draco looks up and tries to smile back at Harry but isn't sure he quite pulled it off.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sat in the now familiar office of Kingsley Shacklebolt, Potter beside him.
"Kingsley? Has there been another murder?" Potter asked impatiently.
"Nope." I say, backing away.
Potter, probably seeing the anxiousness on my face, said, "Nothing will go wrong. We have already done this on over 10 others, and it worked perfectly." He had seated himself on one of the chairs around the table and was looking at me with what could be a mixture of reassurance and impatience.
Draco screams in frustration. He doesn't want to show how much of a squib he is to Potter. He's had a huge crush on Potter since 5th year and even though he had disguised his feelings as hate, he doubts one-on-one time with Potter would do anything to help him. With a groan he stands up to get ready.
Harry rubbed his temples, his feet propped up on his office table. He hadn't planned on shouting at Kingsley, specially not in front of Malfoy but lately he had been feeling...different. There was a constant throbbing in his head and his blood was always boiling.
His eyebrows shot up at the Ministry of Magic seal on the envelope. He hadn't had to deal with them since the trials. After completing his house arrest, he had worked as a minor healer at St. Mungos and soon grew to be famous and known for his incredible healing abilities.
Kingsley sat back in his chair and spoke, "I do remember that you are a healer, Mr. Malfoy, an incredible one at that and to answer your question, no, you will not have to come everyday. You must have remembered that you will have to be working alongside a partner?"
Harry gave a disbelieving laugh. "The ball? He's insane if that's true. The place will be swarming with Aurors."
Draco's Mother had asked him what had happened and Draco had told her it was just a little panic attack caused by resurfacing memories. Mother hadn't pried and called the house elf for tea.
I want to squeal with delight, scream in ecstasy, jump up and down and shout to the whole world that finally, finally Dray, my best friend who I love with all my heart, is going to get something he wants. Get something that'll finally make him happy, after all the dark and tragic moments he experienced.
Harry nodded, he knew how much his friends cared for him and he was grateful for it but he just couldn't bare to see them get worked up because of
Was this really Potter or was I hallucinating?
Draco cast a Protective Charm on his hands and felt the invisible sheet of magic cover them. He reached forward and grabbed a little bit of the green paste in his fingers. Draco had been right, there were glittering pieces of jewels in a dull green paste. He had to investigate what the paste contained and if these were really emeralds, artificial stones or crystallized poison.
Crucial matter? What crucial matter did the Head of Auror Department want to discuss with
"I don't know who to bring." Harry sighed. "I've got bigger problems than that."
Harry tugged at their joint hands and moved towards the dance floor, finding the most uncrowded space and standing there. He watched as Malfoy stood infront of him, still not meeting Harry's eyes. Harry placed Malfoy's hand on his shoulder, his eyes never leaving Malfoy's face which now had a rather adorable cherry red blush on the cheeks.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle at her reply, it was such a badass way to convince a stubborn git like Malfoy.
He saw Malfoy frown in reply, and Harry realized that it wasn't the best of him to mention Malfoy's Death Eater past at a moment like this, when they were in public specially.
"Just say it." Malfoy said, his face showing reassurance.
Nothing can break us because I want to be wrapped in those arms, I want to kiss those lips, I want to hear that laugh, see that smile, forever.
"Mr. Farley." Harry nodded at the man in greeting.
Draco conjured a small glass vial with his wand and filled it with a generous amount of the green paste.
Harry gasped as a loud pop echoed in his room. He stood up, wand drawn, his chair clattering loudly to the floor.
After Harry had passed out, he had woken up at the same place with his team surrounding him. They had already captured the man, struggling against the ropes that were binding him. They were asking him a few questions, but he had dismissed them. Tentatively, they had nodded and didn’t fret over it.
"No... he didn't find what he was looking for and... he got angry. He raged and raged...shouting something about...revenge and murder. I thought he was mad so I tried to stun him, call the healers but...before I could, he was gone. As if he read my mind."
"Yes, I am working." Harry said, waiting for Draco to tell him what's wrong but Draco only nodded and went to the kitchen. Harry's frown deepened but he didn't think much about it. Draco will tell him when he's ready. Harry started to work on his report again.
"Harry.. I-I...wh-what are you doing?" Draco whispered, ignoring Harry's compliments because his mind had stopped working and his heart was racing, his breath was coming in short bursts and his hands on Harry's chest were clammy with sweat.
"Take a seat, Mr. Malfoy. Here drink this." Kingsley pushed a goblet of water towards him, which Draco accepted gladly and downed in one gulp.
"Dance, Malfoy or have you forgotten what that is?" Harry gave Malfoy his bad-boy smirk and his heart almost burst with joy when Malfoy looked like he might swoon.
He was quiet for long enough that Harry decided he should interrupt, "Er-Sir?" Kingsley's gaze turned on Harry and his distant gaze disappeared. “Harry, I have a new case for you." He folded his hands on the mahogany desk, his posture and gaze reminding Harry strangely of Dumbledore.
Then Harry shrugged lightly. "Sure. Friends."
"Yes, love?" Mother spoke in her calm and musical voice which had always relaxed Draco.
With a shared look of mutual agreement both of them went back to their own musings.
"Okay now connect with your magic and try to perform the spell." Potter says
"Who?" The woman asked.
His eyes close as he thinks of how his life would be like. His father would be back from prison. He would encourage Draco to marry a well-mannered girl from a respected pure blood family and then expect Draco to produce an heir to carry the Malfoy name. Draco would do so ofcourse, he was never strong enough to stand up to his father. His father who had destroyed his childhood and would now destroy his adulthood too. If only Potter could save him from his Father's wrath. Draco chastised himself for his thoughts. He shouldn't be thinking of "if onlys". He should be able to stand up for what he wants but he doesn't have the courage to. He doesn't want another Crucio directed at him, doesn't want to be locked in the cellar with only two stale pieces of bread. He doesn't want to hear his mother beg Father to let Draco go this time, to not punish him. Tears prick at the back of his eyes but he pushes them back. Malfoys never cry. Another thing his Father said. The thought makes an ugly dry sob come out of Draco's mouth. He claps a hand on his lips, trying to muffle his cries but he hears a ruffle near his window.
I keep backing away but soon I feel a wall behind me. Uh oh, I know I'm cornered now.
"No, Draco. Think of something happier." Harry says.
"Can we go somewhere a little quiet?" I ask her.
"Oh I don't know, a confidential auror discussion?" Ron walked forward, sitting in Harry's chair. Harry jumped down from his position on the table and turned around to face Ron, standing beside Malfoy's chair.
"It indeed is me Mr. Potter. I apologize to have disturbed you when you were so obviously sleeping or had a- rather- long night." She replies.
Draco made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat, looking around to see if anyone was paying attention to Potter's atrocious table manners. "It's called manners, Potter, manners." Draco sniffed haughtily.
"Yes, you can call me Draco." I say softly.
"I need to check on something. Stay here until Auror Potter comes." Kingsley said and left the office, leaving Draco alone with his dark thoughts.
Malfoy sat down on the chair in front of Harry's with an all too familiar smirk.
Draco's heart beat wildly, his hands clammy.
Malfoy huffed a little laugh at that, "I did more wrongs than you. If anyone has the right to live peacefully, it's you, Potter."
"You have to work with who?" Ron asked when it was clear Harry wouldn't continue.
"Yes. You have a problem with that, Zabini?" Potter thundered.
Draco's eyes widened at that. "Had you forgotten that?" Kingsley raised an eyebrow.
Draco knew that he could go back to the Manor and research there in peace but somewhere deep inside him, he didn't want to. Draco had gotten used to Potter's constant questions and even though he found it annoying and disturbing, there was some part of him that didn't want to be in the suffocating silence of his home. He wasn't homesick, he just felt uneasy there sometimes, specially when he thought about Dark magic or his father.
He shook his head and looked behind, searching for the cause of Farley's sudden unconsciousness. But there was nothing in the dark shop, no one apart from Harry.
Potter, however, seemed to be unaware of simple table adicates as he muttered around a particularly large bite of chicken, "I was starving."
Harry nodded as they entered a brightly lit restaurant. Beautiful paper lamps hung from the ceiling, the walls were painted with cream and brown stripes. Polished wooden tables covered with dark brown velvet were scattered around the restaurant. They sat a table with two chairs, a flower vase with white roses in front of them. The place was so posh and so Malfoy-ish that Harry chuckled.
"Lead the way, Potter." Draco heaved a sigh, he absolutely hated it when Potter was right.
Draco cleared his throat to get the man's attention.
"Oh- yeah not surprising at all." Ron says.
Harry didn't want to admit it but his interest was piqued. On the other hand, he was surprised why the Dark Wizard wasn't attacking Dolohov to prevent disclosure of his evil plans.
like a
"Potter?" Harry registered Malfoy entering the dimly lit office and sitting in his usual chair. "Care to explain what just happened?"
"Can I call you Draco?" He whispers and I feel my blush, which had died down, flare up again.
Turning over another page, Harry looked at the list of the candidates eligible for the case. There were many names of people along with little descriptions about the abilities of the wizards and witches. Most of them were incredible potioneers, Harry even recognized some of them from his Ministry meetings or newspapers.
Draco knew he shouldn't enjoy the way his name rolled off Potter's toungue; without any malice or hate, almost with affection, Potter's masculine scent, or the warmth of Potter's arms or the way his hand was tangled in Draco's hair. He probably felt guilty for making Draco cry and that was the reason he was comforting him but Draco wanted to believe that Potter did it because he wanted to, because he wished to hold Draco in his arms.
"I- I just ... You know how our past was. We insulted each other a lot and pretty harshly too. I don't want that in this case. It is challenging as it is. I do believe, and hope, that we are much more mature than that now." Harry said, looking Malfoy in the eye to convey how honest he was.
"N-no."
His fingers left my wrist but his wand was still on the Mark's skull. He reached in his robes and took out a glass jar that he kept on the ground. Then he grabbed my wrist again, this time so tightly I yelped in pain but Potter didn't loosen his hold. Why? I understood in the moments that came next.
"You won't because it isn't your secret to tell. We'll trace the wizard and kill him. Problem solved." Harry spoke firmly.
I wait for him to do something but all he does is stare. Then he sighs, a tired sigh, and reaches his hand forward. I grab my wand, waiting to hex him the minute he harms my best friend but all Potter does is remove Draco's blonde hair tenderly away from his forehead. I watch, frozen and transfixed in horror, as Potter runs his fingers along Draco's cheekbone, his eyelids, his jaw. His fingers inch towards Dray's lips but he shakes his head and stops himself from touching them.
Turning around, I saw her walking towards me with a grin that said she was definitely plotting something.
"I just wanted some time. For myself, my Mother. Maybe try something new."
He took a deep breath, steeled himself and stepped out of the bathroom. He walked with resolve towards the Investigating Room where the potions were kept. Kingsley had taught him the pattern used to unlock the door.
Thank you for your comments and kudos! Here is Chapter 4. Next Chapter will be up next week. I have a lot planned for it and am super excited to post it!
"Whatever. Anyways, Hermione should be free by now. I swear she is turning Shacklebolt into a workaholic like her." Ron rolls his eyes.
Draco let out a breath and stood up. He had been sitting with Potter in suffocating silence. Not that Potter seemed to mind. He paid Draco no heed, as they usually did when working together, but it unnerved Draco today. Perhaps because of the earlier encounter with Potter's fellow auror,
Potter's answer was cut off by another of his stomach's grumble. "Oh for Salazar's sake! Don't you have anything to eat?" Draco glared at Potter who only rolled his eyes in reply.
"He's fine, just fainted. The pain was probably too much for him."
The morgue smelled of rotting flesh and Draco had to cover his head with a Bubble-head charm as Kingsley had done to avoid passing out from the smell.
this was the potion he was looking for. It made sense to Draco now.
Potter grinned in reply. "I needed to know what kind of posh things you liked."
"Potter, I know there's something you aren't telling me. I promise you, this time I'll try to do the right thing. This time, you are there to stop me if I don't." Malfoy's words surprised Harry and if his surprised expression was any indication, he was too.
: released from Azkaban 1 week ago. Started working as a sweeper at St. Mungos.
"Something you would like to say, Mippey?" He asked with a sigh. Draco was too tired and famished for this.
"To the library. I need to return this." Draco replied flatly, holding up the potions book they had issued before.
P.S: Ignore any errors.
"Shouldn't someone else come with you too?" Pansy asked Potter.
Narcissa took a deep breath. "I am not sure whether you have heard or not but after-after Azkaban... Draco.. He.. His magic isn't- it isn't the same." Narcissa says. It seemed as though the words she just said pained her. Harry became curious, he didn't know something was wrong with Malfoy's magic. He didn't know anything about Malfoy's life after the trials, so to speak.
"How long have you not been able to perform magic?"
Draco wrapped his hand around Potter's arm, feeling the hard muscles of his triceps underneath. His arms felt strong enough to crush a man and Draco's slender hand looped around Potter's muscular one seemed...Draco didn't really have a word for it.
"Because I invited him."
Draco stands infront of Potter.
He saw Draco stop and close his mouth, his cheeks colouring. "Sorry." He whispered sheepishly. Harry took a deep breath to calm his anger.
Gorgeous, is the only word that came to my mind. My eyes widened and my mouth dropped open. As I stared at the guy, I started to recognize the emerald green eyes, the long black locks and the circular glasses which were no longer as hideous as before.
the bastard is!" Malfoy challenged back.
He had seen Potter a few times at St. Mungos when he came with an injury from a mission but they hadn't really talked. Potter was always either wincing in pain or scowling at people when Draco saw him but in this picture Potter was smiling. The smile was so wide Draco was afraid it would split his face in two. A deep and rather adorable dimple appeared on his left cheek when he grinned. Looking at the photo made Draco's chest feel weird, probably from disgust, and he moved back.
As soon as I realized what I had done, I pulled back immediately but before I could go far away Potter's hands tightened on my waist, pulling me back. I stared at his eyes as they looked back in mine, then he lifted his hand from my waist and cupped my face.
What in Merlin's pants happened to you?" Ron's loud voice exclaimed. Strange, Harry hadn't heard him enter his house.
He looked up and chuckled at Malfoy's stunned expression. "What? You thought that man really had something in him to become Minister?" Harry asked.
"O-out." Potter murmured. He was clutching his head again and shaking uncontrollably.
and he wasn't ready for that realization at all.
. Pansy and Blaise always said those words to him. That he was too stuck up for a 23-year old. He hardly went clubbing with them, or went on dates or slept with strangers like most people his age do. He was too busy with the war and then with fulfilling his promise to make the Malfoy's reputation better again.
He hadn't mean to but Harry's whole body shuddered slightly at that. It wasn't much but Malfoy noticed. Though he didn't say anything and Harry was grateful for that.
"Mum? Dad?" He asked, staring at a carbon-copy of his own face and another beautiful one of a woman with red hair. They didn't seem to hear him though.
"I uh- are you sure you're alright, Potter?" Malfoy sat in his usual chair in front of Harry.
"It will calm you." Harry says with that heart-melting smile of his. Draco looks away and munches on his chocolate. Casting a quick Tempus lets Draco know it is 7:30 p.m.
"Its working great. I can do everything I could before." Draco exclaimed, happy at the change of topic.
And now he had to write a report about how he had found Mr. Gavyss's cat which was reported lost, in the attic of the man's own house. Mr. Gavyss was probably the most jolly grandpa Harry had ever met but he couldn't remember anything for the life of him. This time he had lost his cat and of course Robards had to assign this case to Harry. Shab was having a "leg injury" after their latest mission. Harry called bullshit. He had fallen down from the tree and had gotten nothing more than what an Episkey couldn't fix.
"I'll be off now." Potter stands up and I am about to shake Draco, tell him to atleast say 'goodbye, Potter' or just tell Potter how much he likes him but before I can say anything he looks up.
"Er- I didn't had a choice?" Harry says though it comes out more as a question.
Then he had, thankfully, unfrozen and came to his senses. Taking a step back Draco snapped at Potter, "It isn't your business." They had omitted the 'Healer Malfoy' and 'Auror Potter' bullshit. Draco knew they wouldn't be able to keep up that charade for long.
"I need to talk to you, Mother. Perhaps we could during dinner?" Draco asked, hoping to treat his hunger.
"Harry?" Amanda's soft voice cut through his thoughts, reminding him that he wasn't alone. Amanda didn't ask him anything. She was used to his tendency to brood and get consumed by his thoughts.
He squirmed in his chair. Draco was surprised at seeing Potter's discomfort. Many people had told him he could be scary as a Healer sometimes but he never believed them. Until now, that is.
However, when Malfoy spoke, his voice was smooth, not even a tremor was present in it to show his fear; Harry was unwillingly impressed. "I didn't mean to offend you, Pott- Auror Potter. It was merely a question to help me reach the end of this case." There was no sarcasm in his voice; Harry was pretty sure he wasn't lying.
"Then invite him in, Peety, quick." I shouted, sitting at the black sofa and taking a deep breath.
"I'm sor-" Draco started to say but Harry cut him off with a "Shhh."
"No problem, Harry." Smith smiled.
Harry sits on his bed with his head in his hands. He had dreamt of Malfoy today. Malfoy in a rose garden, with Harry. He had turned around, called Harry by his name then with a laugh, plucked a rose from a nearby bush and hiven it to Harry on one knee. Harry had laughed and pulled him into a passionate embrace. The dream had left him feeling weird, mainly because it was Malfoy, the fact that he didn't know Malfoy at all and neither had he thought about him that way. Well he was obsessed with Malfoy in 6th year but that was different,right? Harry had thought he was up to something. He hadn't followed Malfoy around because he found Malfoy's pointy face attractive, or his blond hair beautiful or his long fingers magical or his grey eyes hypnotising. Yeah right, who was he kidding? He found Malfoy handsome back then and still does. There, he said it. Now what? Harry had tried to forget about the dream as well as the buried feelings they had brought out but when Malfoy had laughed like that after casting the charm, Harry was reminded of his stupid dream and he had to flee from the room before he did what he had done in the dream. He had felt disgusted with himself because he had wanted to hug Malfoy and twirl him around. He didn't have a right to do that. They weren't friends, acquaintances and they certainly weren't lovers.
As much as he hated the git, he didn't want to kill him.
Of course. Potter would talk to my Dark Mark. I knew he could speak Parseltongue, everyone knew, but him talking to my Mark? That made me feel anxious for some reason.
Harry sighed, sometimes he hated Ginny's stubbornness. "It's nothing, Gin."
"So you have performed every bit of magic. For today, I thought how about the most advanced magic? A Patronus?" Harry asks.
working on this case but this particular occurrence involves some areas outside of your expertise. Hence you will be having to work with a partner. I have a list of some candidates I think would suit best for this case, evaluate them and choose the best. Remember Auror Potter, choose who you think has the most expertise and not who you would get along with well."
"I did wrong things, bad things." Harry replied.
Draco's blush deepened and he only swatted at Harry's chest when he laughed at Draco's flaming face.
And that wasn't the only thing. Robards had replaced his partner from Ron to Shab who was shabby just like his name. The mention of a new case and the guy got a serious illness of dragonpox. Harry had to endure hours and hours of chitter-chatter of Mrs. Celena about how she was the only witch with the most beautiful toenails, all alone.
Harry's eyes widened as he realized what he had just said. He didn't want to tell Malfoy that he and Pansy had become friends because she had helped him in getting him and Malfoy together, so he had said the only thing that came to mind. But now it was done and he couldn't take it back so, fuck it,  I want to make him mine today so why not have a dance? Harry thought.
Harry looked up at the blond. "Not your best."
Draco rubbed his eyes with his palms. He had been up since dawn, trying to figure out what the blood-red potion was. After the horrific events of yesterday, sleep had hardly come to him.
A roar of frustration echoed in the dark night; a bone-chilling and inhuman sound. The people of Purely cowered in their houses. They missed the time when their town was a peaceful place but that had changed now. Now it was haunted by something dark, or rather
Mippey nodded in reply and started speaking in a hushed tone, "Master Malfoy, Mippey is being worried about the Mistress. Mistress only sits in the living room and she is staring at the box. If Mippey asks her anything she orders Mippey away! Mippey saw her crying one time also, Master Malfoy. Mippey is being so worried-"
Draco saw his mother frown at that but thankfully, she didn't push.
"You just passed out. I didn't have enough time to call for help so I apparated you here, at my place. What happened, Harry? Why did you send the signal if everything was alright?" Smith spoke again.
"I just remembered that there's a library here. It has all kinds of books. Maybe you'll find something about the potion there?" Potter spoke and Draco stopped scowling. The git was right; maybe the library had some old books with the information he needed.
..who is supposed to be your fucking
"Tea is fine, thank you Kreacher" Mrs. Malfoy cuts Kreacher's rambling.
When he did open his eyes, however, instead of his Patronus, he saw Harry. Saw the pride and ecstasy in Harry's eyes but more than that he saw what Harry had probably always kept hidden. Harry's emotions were now unguardedly displayed on his face and Draco's heart raced when he saw them. There was so much affection, so much fondness, so much love in Harry's eyes that before Draco knew what he was doing, as though in a trance, he ran towards Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, burying his face in the crook of Harry's neck.
"Non-verbal magic." Pansy smirks and comes closer to where I'm standing.
Taking a deep breath, Draco nodded.
"It's no problem, Harry." Draco's Mother says, picking up the cup of tea Kreacher served. Draco picks his up too and takes a sip.
I'm really sorry for the late update but I was a little busy..Anyways, here's the chapter:
"Oh Malfoy, it is my business when you mention it to me." Potter had leaned forward, his face so extremely close to Draco that their noses had almost touched. For a moment the only thought in Draco's head was that Potter was fucking
Harry looked around as they apparated in a lively street. Colourful banners were present around all kinds of shops. Quills, cauldrons, books, restaurants, the place was a more modern and brighter Diagon Alley.
"Can I call you Draco?" Potter asks and this time he is looking right in my eyes and I realize that his emerald green eyes have specks of yellow and gold, freaking gold, and right now they are shining with what I can only call joy, affection and a hint of nervousness. The mixed emotions send a chill down my spine and my palms start to sweat, which I'm sure Potter notices as he's holding my right hand.
"Did you try-" She started to say when Blaise suddenly walked up to us.
They all knew that it was Draco's last lesson tomorrow because he had learnt every bit of magic he knew before. Harry knew tomorrow's lesson wasn't necessary but he wanted to elongate the time he spent with Draco a little more. Who knows if Draco would want to see Harry's face again after they were done with lessons and Draco had his magic back.
"Can't argue with that." Thankfully, Potter didn't shout this time.
"Sources even powerful than the saviour?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Harry's mouth quirked at the end involuntarily; he nodded his head in affirmation.
"You mean friends?" They both spoke at the same time. For a while all they did was stare at the other.
Draco sighed, "Maybe, Mother, maybe." For her sake, Draco didn't disagree.
~~~●●●~~~
"No I cannot. Be ready by 11:30, we have to reach there by 12." Narcissa orders in her "I won't take anymore shit from you" voice and leaves the room.
"I-is Draco okay?" I ask Potter and follow him as he walks towards one of the sofas and lays Draco's limp body on it.
For a moment, Draco was speechless as he stared at the white muggle t-shirt Potter was wearing. It stretched tight over his chest and clung to the prominent and taught lines of his defined abs. The short sleeves did justice to Potter's arms; muscular and tan. Draco noticed that his shirt was covered in sweat.
"Did he find something?" Draco asked.
"Why do you look like Christmas's come early?" He whispers, a ceramic bowl in hand.
Mother raised an eyebrow and took a bite of her food gracefully. With a deep breath Draco started to talk, this won't end well.
Potter is standing near Draco, breathing heavily and staring at something infront of him. Draco is about to ask what the hell just happened when Potter turns his eyes on him and all thought leaves Draco's mind.
Even though Draco wouldn't admit it, he had developed a strange liking towards Potter. Noticing things like how rich Potter's laugh was when he was surprised or found something too funny, how sexy his crooked smile was, how lusciously soft his black curls were.
"Fine but this better be important." The librarian gave him a nasty look and turned around towards a tapestry. He moved it to reveal a dark brown door on which the old man traced a complicated pattern.
Turning promptly red and cursing his pale skin for displaying his mortification to the whole world, Draco ducked his head and spoke, "I was just..talking to..er-" He gestured at the girl, not remembering her name. Kingsley's smile widened, "I'm glad you've enjoyed the company of Sara."
"You do have magic but it is very less. You will need to be patient if you want to get your magic back." Harry finally replies.
"Mr. P- I mean Harry?" Narcissa cuts the train of his thoughts. He looked at her, now seated on Harry's living room sofa.
"Maybe if I knew why you do the foolish things you do, it'd be more tolerable to be around you." Draco thought it was a good enough reason. He wouldn't tell Potter that he actually did want to be friends.
"I-I.. I..can't-"
"Don't lie." Draco said back softly.
Draco opened the letter, not sure why they were contacting him now but he was pretty sure he hadn't done anything wrong or illegal.
"Kingsley wants you and Mr. Malfoy in his office." Amanda said.
"Save it, Potter. You are right anyway. I always do the wrong thing." He grabbed the book that was sitting on the table and marched out of Harry's office.
He reached the DMLE Office and knocked on the black door. A perky and extremely Hufflepuff girl opened it with a beaming smile.
Another wind blew but Harry kept his eyes open this time, watching helplessly as all the people surrounding him blew away with the sand.
"It might have the information I need." Draco said. Potter sighed in reply,
"It was... a mistake." Draco muttered, his fingers playing with the cover of the book he had been reading.
His tone was different than usual so Harry turned to look at him. He was surprised to see a rusty colour on his cheeks. Ron's previous remark must've embarrassed him. Little does he know; Ron can sometimes be even denser than Harry sometimes.
(See the end of the chapter for
I am about to tell him that we can just Accio the bowls, no need to go and get them but I have a feeling he wants to be alone with Draco. Why, I have no idea because Draco is unconscious but if Potter is up to something I want to figure it out.
Harry was getting irritated with Draco's rambling. Couldn't he just address the point? It wasn't like Draco to blab about irrelevant things. And Harry still had 7 more reports to finish.
"Nothing." Malfoy spoke too quickly, too defensively.
"It is."
3. Where was the cauldron bought from?
Potter's brows furrowed in confusion at Draco's hostile tone. Draco knew his behaviour wasn't making any sense and was entirely uncalled for. The raven-haired auror had done nothing wrong. If Draco was too chicken to tell the guy about his feelings, it was entirely his own fault but Draco was absolutely not about to accept that.
This is it, I am stuck with whoever is behind this door for Salazar knows how long. Oh Merlin,
: Past Death Eater. Potioneer. Lives in a Muggle town.
"I think Potter's up to something. I have a gut feeling. You go and get the bowl, I'll see." I whisper.
Asper nodded along with him, "I remember."
He grinned brightly and disappirated directly to Potter's office, the book still clutched in his hands, his face beaming with childish excitement.
Thanks alot for reading!.. Your kudos and comments mean a lot.. The next chapter will be up next week.♡♡
So that was the Chapter! Tell me what you think. Also any suggestions or constructive criticism will be taken into account and highly appreciated.
The snake suddenly hissed loudly and stretched itself. Its fangs were an inch away from Potter's fingers which were wrapped tightly around my wrist. I gasped and heard Pansy shout in horror, Blaise's hand tightened on my arm.
"How mislead you are, Potter. Tell me who was it that called you attractive again? Weasley?" Draco drawled, getting a little bit if his dignified self back.
. But then again, you were always a little child. Following other's orders like the good boy you are." A deep, cold voice spoke from nowhere.
"Oh Merlin's sake, Draco! Whatever the fuck is wrong just freaking say it. No need to ramble." Harry shouted.
~~~●●●~~~
"Yes, I think so. Now when will you ask him out?"
"You could go without a date." Draco didn't know why he even bothered with dignity anymore. His mouth had a mind of its own and was stubbornly compelled to mortify him at every chance.
The cherry red colour on Draco's cheeks wasn't gone unnoticed by Narcissa.
because that
It took everything Harry had in him to not jump up, pin Draco to the wall and snog him senseless. The way Draco's eyes shined after he performed another bit of magic, or the way his lips curved into the most beautiful and the most kissable smile Harry had ever seen, or the way Harry's name rolled off Draco's tongue drived Harry crazy. Everyone; Ron, Hermione, Molly, Ginny even McGonagall and Harry's students had noticed the change in Harry's behaviour, everyone except Draco. Harry didn't tell anyone about it except Ron and Hermione who already knew and Charlie who he trusted the most.
"Indeed a favour. I lied to the Dark Lord for you. You owe me a life debt." Harry was stunned. He did remember that she had saved him but a life debt?
"That's very Gryffindor of you to say it so crudely." Draco looked up at Harry through his lashes and saw Harry's tanned cheecks stained cherry red by a very adorable blush and a soft smile curling his lips.
"Malfoy? Are you okay?" He asked again, concern lacing his voice.
"I-I don't know. T-the Ministry ordered, I obeyed." The once glorified Death Eater now shrugged lightly but Harry didn't miss the apparent tension in his shoulders.
The last time it had moved like that was when the Dark Lord was branding me with the foul thing. I panicked and tried to snatch my arm away from Potter but he held on tight. I could feel Blaise grab my right arm and Pansy's hand was still on my back but all I could focus on was the fact that the snake was
"He means that he's going to make a scene at the ball. I know this is wrong but we can't really go against the Minister." Kingsley sighed.
Draco climbed down the stairs into the dining room. Mother was already seated, the table filled with platters of pancakes, eggs, bacon and a huge jug of pumpkin juice.
I do as told and take a shot of some muggle drink, hoping for some alchohol courage.
He saw his Mother's eyes soften at his words as she placed her hand on top of his. "I love you, Draco, but you know that I loved him too. It is hard for me to forget about him."
There was only me and the muscley guy beside me near the table and he was facing away from me, probably not wanting to talk so I didn't make a move to start conversation either. As I took another sip, the guy turned around and I got a good look at his face.
"Uh-now?" Potter blinks at me dumbly. God how much of a moron is he?
Draco stared at a point behind Potter's shoulder, not able to meet his eyes. "Just...it seems weird that you'd forcefully interact with someone when you don't want to."
"Oh, Potter. I'm hosting a birthday party for myself. Come, bring Granger and Weasley too if you want. Dress nicely, practice flirting and make a move. I'll owl you my address."
"Hey, it's okay. I know many skilled wizards who can't produce one. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll teach you."
The monster was more human than one would think but only physically. His rage had driven him to the apex of insanity and had made him inhumane. Nothing or no one could help him, not that he would let himself be helped.
"Potter! We're outside. Don't you know any manners?" Draco chastised him after swallowing his food like a
, okay? Ron or Hermione. Just don't hold it in like you always do, hmm?" Ginny's eyes were anxious.
"He...he came here." Asper spoke shakily. Draco's eyes widened.
"No." I have to shout because of the blasting music.
Draco had, actually, not been wondering that. After doing all of the evil things he had done in his years at Hogwarts, he had tried his best to make up for them by becoming a healer. Saving lives instead of being the cause of their end felt... comforting...somehow but after hearing about all of the things these Aurors had done, Draco's work seemed nothing. He wanted to be remembered, remembered for something good, for something other than being a Death Eater.
He gulped his drink, then threw the cup and held his hand out towards Malfoy.
Harry was stunned yet again.
Blaise closes the lid and I notice how he tries not to make more contact with the jar than necessary.
"I am perfectly capable to fight you if you were to attack me, which I am pretty sure you won't do. So now can we get going? I need to get to work."
Draco had noticed the guy here and there in the Ministry and had always found his eyes on Potter. Draco didn't know what their relationship was but whatever it was, it annoyed Draco. Mainly because of the way he
Draco stared at Potter. The guy was serious. Draco remembered their First Year; when Potter had rejected his friendship. It had humiliated him in front of everyone but more than that he was emotionally hurt more than he'd like to admit. Draco could do that now. Take his revenge by rejecting Potter's request of friendship but he couldn't bring himself to. Draco's desire to be friends with Potter was still kindling inside him, even if it was foolish and vain. He knew that after the war, his evil acts, Potter would never want to do anything with him but here he was, asking Draco to be his friend.
"When did this happen?" Draco asked.
"Hello! You must be Mr. Malfoy." She smiled brightly at him which made Draco's scowl harden even more but it didn't seem to affect the girl at all. Draco gave her a bare shake of the head in the affirmative.
Kiingsley nodded and flicked his wand, locking the wooden door of his office.
The place was dusty and damp like every other shop in Knockturn Alley. Shelves, holding a wide range of mysterious looking magical objects; daggers, jewellery, wand cases, cauldrons with glimmering diamonds, lined the walls covered with peeling wallpaper. Harry paid the objects no attention but moved forward with resolve. He had one reason to be here and he won't be distracted.
Harry opened his eyes slowly and was instantly blinded with a bright light. "Harry! Are you alright?" Smith's concerned voice reached Harry's ears and he sighed slowly.
"I am extremely sorry for making you wait for such a long while, Mr. Malfoy. Oh and I thank you for gracing us with your presence." A deep voice spoke. Draco whipped around to see Kingsley Shacklebolt looking at him with a tight-lipped smile.
He reached in front of a wooden door with a sign "Do Not Disturb" on it. Draco frowned, Kingsley had said that the guy was expecting him so he ignored the sign and knocked on the door. "Come in!" A deep voice answered. Draco took a deep breath and opened the door.
Harry frowned, his stomach lurching as he thought of why Shacklebolt, the Senior Head Auror wanted to talk to him. He wasn't worried or afraid of Shacklebolt exactly, they had a perfect relationship with mutual respect for the other but Harry was afraid his team had reported his episode on the last mission to the Head Auror.
Kingsley nodded once and Harry knew he was being dismissed. He grabbed the file and got up, "Thank you, Kingsley. I won’t disappoint you."
Then he nodded and replied, "Thank you, Sir Shacklebolt." With that, Draco disappirated to the office of his unknown partner.
?" Harry shook his head in reply.
." Harry hissed at the man, advancing forward as Farley stumbled away from him, his back hitting the wall, trapping him.
"I- it isn't working." He gasped out.
I grabbed it with a shaky hand and read it. All it said was that this removal was Ministry approved and any problems will be completely the Ministry's responsibility. I got worried at the word "problems".  What was Potter about to do to me?
He followed Harry into the living room and stood in the middle.
"Never kissed anyone?"
Harry burried his head in Draco's soft hair, occasionally kissing his head and murmuring sweet words. Soon he hears Draco's sobs stop and his breathing even out. Harry tenderly lays Draco on the bed, covering him with a blanket.
Draco had noticed a man staring at him, no doubt recognizing the Death Eater he had once been.
A beautiful silver leopard galloped through the halls, its movement ceasing in front of Kingsley who held a hand out to stop Draco from walking.
"Oh Malfoy, you'll regret not telling me now. You should know that I am extremely stubborn and curious so don't think you can get away with this."
My heart drops. What if she cancelled the party? Or thought I wasn't worthy enough for Draco? Or maybe Draco didn't like me back and she was just mistaken. I take a deep breath and let the owl in. The letter was short, all it said was "Check your floo, Pansy."
"Ummm- bring him here every Saturday and Sunday. At umm- say- uh ... 2? No no... 12 yeah 12 p.m."
"So how's the deal with the Aurors going?" Draco's mother asked.
The other Potion, the one the Aurors had evacuated was blood-red, it must've been made with the pure blood extracted from the Kedavra Potion.
"I suggest you keep that green paste here too. It is a safe place." Kingsley said.
Draco winced at his words. He tried to say something but he didn't know what to say so instead of making a much more fool of himself, he kept quiet.
"I just…they were terrible things, Potter. Even if I use my father's actions as an excuse, I can't really convince others or myself even. They were wrong actions; I know that now and I knew that back then too but I still chose to do them. I regret them, I really do but not only because they resulted in giving me a hard time in adulthood but because I truly regret them. I wish I could change everything I had done."
Harry strode with resolve into St. Mungo’s. The hospital was bustling with witches and wizards as always. A man with an elephant trunk in the place of his nose, a witch with green skin, a child with boils all over his face, all kinds of men, women and children whom Harry paid no notice.
, Potter. Salazar's sake! You know it's not that easy. We don't even know
"Ron!" Hermione slapped Ron's arm, though Harry wasn't sure if she did that because Ron had called Draco a ferret or because he was speaking with food in his mouth.
"I am not. And don't think I'll just forget whatever happened in there. You're going to tell me, Potter." Draco stood up and so did Potter.
being in the dark about
?" The man asked.
Potter.
"Mr. Farley! What is it? What's happening?" Harry grabbed the man, turned him over. There was no apparent indication as to what was happening but Harry had an idea. It was like that night, the way he had experienced the pain from the inside, from his own chest.
As soon as he grabbed his wand, he heard Potter gasp. Draco looked up at the Auror who was clutching his head in his hands.
~Goldhearts ♡♡♡
"Why did you floo call?" I ask.
"And now we have a special song for a special pair. I know it was my Birthday but I dedicate this dance to the cutest couple in the Wizarding World. Get it Dray!"
~~~●●●~~~
His gaze turned to Malfoy who was watching him curiously, expectantly with his chin propped up on a fist.
A part of his mind reminded him constantly that he was
He expects Potter to laugh at him or make fun of him but he merely nods and says "I see." He looks thoughtful for a while. Draco looks questioningly at his Mother who look as confused as him. A loud crack breaks the silent atmosphere.
"Oh, am I disturbing something?" Ron raised a brow.
Potter only sighed as he dropped in the chair beside Draco's. "I know, I know. Did you expect me to be dancing in ecstasy at the news of murder we just got?" He asked.
There was no denying it now, Draco did like Harry Potter. Not as a friend, not as a colleague but
Draco smirked in reply, "Of course. I wouldn't have generously given you my delicious food if you weren't looking like a starved boy."
He rapped on the table of the receptionist, a witch with brown hair and smooth chestnut skin.
Mother's demeanor instantly changed. Her shoulders stiffened and her mouth closed tightly. Nonetheless, Draco knew that she understood who he was talking about.
I hear Blaise's noisy footseps return and I undo the charm I had cast.
: works at Knockturn Alley. Could be involved.
"Well, I know you can figure it out. My dragon is the best there is." She smiled at Draco. The use of the pet name she had given him in his childhood made Draco's heart swell. Whatever the situation, he knew his mother would always be there for him.
Draco's stomach tightened further. He spoke through clenched teeth, "I thought you didn't care about the ball?"
I still remember how much of a torture it was when I had gotten the Dark Mark. I don't think I could bare that pain again.
Draco skipped the potions that weren't of his use and marked the ones he thought could identify as the one he had observed.
He turned around to see his Mother staring at him worriedly. "It's okay, Mother. The aurors will protect me." Draco reassured her quickly, he didn't have time.
His relationship with Ginny wasn't the same after the war. They had given dating another try but Ginny wasn't so invested and for Harry there was no more spark in their relationship so they decided to end it. Ginny was happy with Neville but Harry didn't settle in a relationship right away. However, Harry did mess around with random people. He went to clubs, had one-night stands and did everything an 18 year old does. Before he didn't had much freedom but now he lived his life to the fullest. All that was missing in his life was a partner who would give him the love and care he deserved.
"What do you mean feel?"
"If you touch it, it'll cast a protective shield around you." I explain.
Kingsley placed a file in front of Harry. "This file contains all the details we know of currently about this investigation as well as the list of your possible partners. Go through it carefully and report to me tomorrow."
"It could be the most important thing." Malfoy said.
"No thank you, Potter. I think I can manage to go to the library myself."
"Is this your new wand?" Potter asks, ignoring Draco's protest.
We enter the room and Potter jerks back as if he was hexed.
"Yeah, I know that." He replies, not looking at Draco and trying to complete the freaking report as fast as he can.
Harry's magic is warm and when he is too happy, too angry or too sad it becomes hot like fire. Malfoy's magic, however, is cold. It must start too freeze when he feels extreme emotions but right now it is calm and relaxed. Having done what he wanted to, Harry pulls out of Malfoy's mind and stands panting infront of him.
Potter nods, looking thoughtful again. Draco realizes that Potter isn't a professional in this field, but his questions kind of made sense. Still Draco has no idea whether or not Potter will be able to help him. Draco knows all the spells, the wand movements and everything else important to perform magic but he still can't do anything.
"You fainted while Potter was removing your Mark." I reply and move to sit beside him, offer him reassurance.
"Oh, why?" He breathed out.
"No, actually. I like blue, light pastel blue." Harry said.
Draco sighed, he knew she wouldn't like this so he cryptically said with a wave of his hand, "Nothing to worry about, Mother. The Aurors wanted my help with a case which involves potions. You know how skilled I am in this field so they asked if I'd be willing to aid them and I agreed." He didn't mention the fact that Harry Potter was supposed to be his partner, no need to worry Mother even more.
Harry cast a cooling charm on the room he was in. The events at the investigation room had left him sweating profusely. It hadn't taken him long but Harry had made the connection that was so easy to make. That didn't mean he liked it.
"Yes, I would love that." He replied and the expression on Harry's face was one of a man whose biggest wish had come true. With a laugh Harry pulled Draco into another toe-curling kiss.
"Eyeliner." Pansy grins and puts her hand on her hips. "Now take off your glasses, Potter." That means she's serious, she calls me Harry otherwise.
"Malfoy." Harry breathed the words out, lowering his wand.
Of course, Kingsley would say that. Of fucking course. Harry knew that Malfoy was the best for this case. Not only was he a great potioneer and healer but he also had knowledge about Dark Magic. He would be perfect for this job but it all came down to what Kingsley said, didn't it? Harry was thinking about his
Draco was dumbfounded. He indeed is a great potioneer and even though he isn't proud of admitting it but he does have knowledge of Dark Magic. That doesn't mean he'd want to help the Aurors. He doesn't want to participate with anymore Dark stuff. He has had enough of them to last him a lifetime.
Harry had no idea what had come over him. He knew he should've told Malfoy where to aim the Reducto but he had been so distracted by his feelings and Malfoy's tight jeans that he had completely forgotten. And when he had seen Malfoy aiming the Reducto at his precious gift, the gift Charlie Weasley, the only person who could truly understand him, even better than Ron or Hermione,he had completely lost it. It was hard for him to control his anger, even though he knew it wasn't Malfoy's fault but when he saw Malfoy crying, actually crying, he had calmed down. Malfoy looked so bloody terrified of him. As though Harry would Avada Kedavra him any minute.
However, as he stared at the lopsided grin Potter was giving him, the undying light of excitement and happiness in Potter's eyes, Draco realized that he had been living a boring life. Potter looked as if he enjoyed his life to the fullest, even with his demanding job. Draco knew he did, just recently he had gone on a trip to Italy with his friends; it was all over the Prophet. So Draco decided that he'd ease a little bit too. Even if it was just a lunch, it was a start.
"Draco Malfoy." Harry muttered resignedly.
"Well, you certainly can! Sir is going to be visiting the Dark Materials shop at Knockturn Alley tomorrow and then he'll be.." Draco tuned the girl out as she babbled on about what Shacklebolt would be doing this whole month. He had given up trying to make her stop being such a Hufflepuff which seemed truly impossible.
"I did not mean to offend you, Mr. Malfoy. It is just a precautionary measure we, Aurors, must take." Kingsley spoke. "All I can tell you about this case is that it involves a Dark Wizard, a Potion and is very dangerous." Kingsley said cryptically.
Smith's black eyes widened and with a nod he went towards the living room. Harry got up and went to the guest room Smith had pointed to, succumbing himself to sleep in the warm bed.
"Pansy!" With a blush Draco cuts her off. "I understand that I was... ummm... a little obsessed-" "A little!?" "-fine very obsessed with Potter but I can't act on my feelings. He is my teacher, for Merlin's sake!"
"We should tell this to Kingsley. It doesn't sound-" Malfoy's words were interrupted by Harry;
So Harry told him his theory; how the blood-red potion was clearly made by the Dark Wizard to be used against him. He knew it was something Malfoy could think of himself too after the events that took place but the question, he dreaded answering most was the one Malfoy asked next:
"Good. So just try to make this float." Potter says, keeping a feather infront of Draco. With his wand pointing at the feather, Draco closes his eyes and tries to feel his magic but he can't.
Harry gasped and his body continued to tremble in pain, he could feel his conciousness slipping slowly away but the hissed words were crystal clear in his head once again:
"Now close your eyes, feel your magic and hold the connection with it. I'm sure you know the wand movement for Wingardium Leviosa?" Potter asks. Draco nods in reply.
"Don't open your eyes. Focus, Malfoy, focus." He hears Potter say but he sounds so far away. Whatever Potter has cast is making him feel more relaxed, like taking a walk in a garden, a beautiful green garden. Draco tries to feel his magic but he has no idea what magic even feels like. He takes a deep breath and exhales slowly, all the while chanting "come to me. Please. Come to me." Suddenly he feels something cool hit him right where his wand is pointed, on his heart. It is like someone splashed cold water right on top of it. With a gasp he opens his eyes and removes his wand from his chest with a jerk, the feeling instantly vanishing. He looks at Potter with wide eyes, breathing hard.
Ron however was a great auror. Hermione was the Minister's (Shaklebolt's) advisor. Ginny played for the Holyhead Harpies, George ran his and Fred's shop, though he wasn't as lively as before. Bill was still working at Gringotts. Charlie had come back from Romania, because he thought life was too short to not spend time with his family. He now worked as a cursebreaker at the Ministry, occasionally helping Hagrid at Hogwarts.
Harry takes a deep breath and casts Legillimens. Chanting repeatedly in his own mind that he won't open any doors that aren't of his use he moves deeper and deeper into Malfoy's mind. After searching all around and not finding anything, Harry is about to pull back when he feels a hum of magic. Following its direction, Harry reaches where he's wanted to all along. There is a golden light, albeit not very bright, but it is there. Its hum is light too but Harry can feel it nonetheless.
I look away, staring at Potter's chest which is shaking with suppressed laughter.
that he still cared about the git.
The first thing Draco saw when he apparated into Shacklebolt's office was the picture. It showed a dark room, unrecognizable and very ramshackle. Blood covered the wooden floor, dark red and velvety. Two bodies lay in the liquid puddle, their pale bodies covered in long deep cuts. Serious wounds were present on their necks and wrists. The sight was extremely disturbing and Draco felt revolted, bile rising in his throat.
"Malfoy, I'm-" Harry wanted to apologize but he stopped when Malfoy lifted a hand.
And then I realized that this process wasn't all that simple. Potter practically pierced my skin with how hard he was digging his wand tip in and the snake was literally twitching in pain. My arm was throbbing painfully but this was nothing compared to what Potter did next.
Malfoy released a sigh of relief at that. "Good. Now as for the details?" He asked.
The Ministry had just informed me that they had found a way to remove the Dark Mark and if I wanted, I could get it removed. I agreed of course but I have no idea why they'd offer me that. Surely they'd expect something in return? But no. All they had said in reply was that the Ministry Official will come the next day at 11 a.m. at the Manor.
? He was asking me to freaking dance with
Malfoy's eyes burned, his nostrils flaring. He stood up suddenly, the book forgotten on the table. "I've been spending all of my time here, working on this case. I took a vacation from my actual job to focus better, to solve the problem, that might I remind you, was
"Have you asked Malfoy about this?" Harry finds it hard to believe that Malfoy would accept his help and let Harry see his vulnerable side.
Draco took a seat and helped himself to some pancakes drenched in syrup.
I can only stare with wide eyes as Potter lowered his face to mine and kissed me again. The feeling of his lips, his soft and plump lips, on mine is so amazing that my eyes close involuntarily and my toes curl in my shoes.
. Even thinking of that name stirred something in Draco's belly.
"Calm down, Pansy." We hear Blaise mutter as the music stops, causing a deafening silence.
"This is so much harder than brewing Amortentia and that's saying something." Draco had muttered lowly, forgetting for a second that he had company.
"Well- you c-could say I like Draco... a little." He whispers.
"Oh? Then why do you do it?" Harry asked.
When Malfoy didn't say anything for a while, Harry realized his efforts were in vain. Why would Malfoy want to forget everything that happened between them in the past? He was just putting up with Harry for this case. And from where did
I stand by the drinks table and grab a cup of butterbeer. Pansy isn't anywhere near but she'll probably be here soon. The party is at Pansy's house. There are too many people, some drinking, some dancing and some just talking. Due to the lights, everything looks blue. I recognize a few Slytherins from our school year but I don't see anyone I know.
"I wish you the best, Mr. Malfoy. You are a great asset for us in this demanding case." Kingsley nodded at him with such honesty in his eyes that, for a moment, Draco was dumbfounded.
"Not your business." Draco had muttered and busied himself with casting detective charms over the paste to determine the ingredients. So far that hadn't worked.
"You still miss him." It was a statement, not a question and was stated so firmly that there was absolutely no room for arguments.
"And how can I help you?"
"This is bad." Potter's deep voice brought Draco out of his thoughts, thankfully.
"Well, it's a neutral topic. Would you rather I asked why you joined the Death Eaters?" Harry shrugged.
Narcissa and Draco had sent him thank you letters and apologized for their wrongdoings too. Harry had forgiven them and then had hardly thought about either of them. Mainly because he was very busy in the trials and then his job as a DADA proffesor at Hogwarts.
"Er-yeah." Draco muttered as the girl gave him a grin even wider than Potter's.
I tried to tame my hair but it won't cooperate. It had been growing out and I was thinking to cut it but right now I didn't have enough time so I tried to tie it in a bun, like I had seen some guys do in the Quiditch magazine. It worked and I looked better, sexier. I thought about shaving but my stubble wasn't that grown out, it was okay, so I left it that way.
I am so sorry for going MIA. I was actually reallyyy busy but here's chapter 5. Do tell me what you think! Thank you for leaving kudos and for your comments. This chapter had alot of POV change so I mentioned whose POV it was. I will try to post again as soon as I can! ~Goldhearts♡♡
"Did you know about magical cores?" He asks. It had surprised him when Potter had told him in detail about his core. How it was cool and collected. How it would freeze when Draco would feel extreme emotions. He also told Draco about how his own magic was warm and Draco's stupid, girly side was giddy about how well of a match they were.
"Okay, great. I want you to focus on the feeling and say the incantation; Expecto Patronum." Harry says.
"Anything you'd like to drink?" The waiter asked.
I am so sorry for my reaction today. I was just reminded of something...surprising, you could say. I was actually very proud of you and thought you did a great job. Please do come on Saturday by 12, so we can progress more. I profoundly apologise once again. Don't take my reaction at heart.
I looked in the mirror again. I had decided to wear a black-button down shirt with tight black pants, to show that I had been working out. I decided that the full sleeves seemed too formal, it was a party after all, so I rolled them up to my elbows (and maybe I wanted to show the muscles on my arms too).
"What about your friends? Or the wizarding world? What will everyone say?" Draco asked.
"Why couldn't I do it before? And what did you cast at me?" Draco asks Potter who now sat infront of him.
"You teach at Hogwarts. I want you to teach him."
"Draco, I couldn't understand a single thing you said. Maybe speak at human speed now?"
"I need to investigate the house again, Kingsley." Potter spoke firmly and Draco realized
"What? I haven't eaten any breakfast." Potter said defensively.
I shuffle back and Pansy steps through. She's already dressed, wearing a blood red dress that goes to her knees. It is a type of corset at the top and flares down at the bottom. She's wearing a matching lipstick and something on her eyes too. Only someone like Pansy can pull that off.
"Okay, okay shut up." I mutter but I can't stop the smile from blooming up on my face.
He was about to start writing about how he had heard meows from the top of the stairs when he saw Draco enter the living room.
Draco read for hours until he found what he was looking for;
Draco opened the potions book he had issued from the library and started to read the pages he had marked; A Blinding Potion made with sapphires to temporarily blind a person, a Zone-kill Potion to instantly kill any muggles who smelled it made with onyx, a potion consisting opals and pearls to melt the bones of any man or woman who consumes it. All kinds of dark and deadly potions but none that would relate to the one Draco had conceived from the dead bodies.
"So? What is it? You know you can tell us anything mate." Ron said.
go to the ball and I
"Oh Draco! I'm so sorry, sweety. You know how hard it is to convince Blaise." Pansy says, finally noticimg Draco. Blaise rolls his eyes but he doesn't look offended.
Ministry.
Draco deflates. A month for only feeling his magic. He looks at his Mother for help but she only says, "It is your decision, Draco. I will support you no matter what."
"I heard words then. I couldn't see anything but I could hear hissing. I soon realized that it was Parseltongue. The words didn't make any sense at first. Mud. Green. Something like that." Harry shrugged, saw Malfoy's eyes fill with confusion but the calming reassurance was still there.
Draco's head snapped towards her.
Potter looked up at the same time and asked the person to enter.
A nervous thought entered Harry's already worried mind. He had asked Malfoy not to tell Kingsley about his relation to the case. Had Malfoy not listened?
"I'll come with you." Potter started to get up but Draco spoke harshly;
smirk, causing him to avert his eyes and turn redder.
"I see." Malfoy said and they lapsed into silence again.
The minute they were outside and the door was closed, Potter gave a huge gasp and sat up on the ground, his pain no more visible on his face. He rubbed his cheeks then looked up at Draco.
《POV Change》
"So I was thinking that.. well, I'm pretty sure you won't like this but I talked to Pansy and she said it would be alright and you won't get that annoyed because you really cared about me and all. Of course you do, you're my boyfriend. You are supposed to take care of me but-"
"It's going good, Mother." Draco smiled at her.
Draco sighed,
"Yes, he's here. And he's looking stunning." Blaise muttered.
"Fine. Tell me when you find something." Then he went back to whatever he was doing and Draco went back to thoroughly reading the pages he had marked.
Harry chuckled and ran a hand through Draco's hair.
"Why not?" Malfoy asked softly, almost as if he cared. Huh, there's Harry's wishful thinking again.
I grin at that and rub my hands together.
"I am afraid I can't tell you that until you make a Sacred Oath not to disclose this information to anyone." Kingsley replied. Draco scowled. Did Kingsley really think he would go telling people about what the Aurors were up to? He had more important matters at hand. He was about to get up and leave at such disrespect when Kingsley spoke again.
"Uh- better."
"Its no problem, Malfoy. Now that I am er- helping you, we will hopefully make more progress." Draco nods then sits at the sofa, feeling exhausted.
"Where are you going?" He asked.
"Oh.. well I was just saying that..umm.. if we could live at the Manor until Father gets better?"
"What's this, Harry?"
"So what are we to do today?" Draco asks a little shakily. He didn't want this to be his last day spent with Harry.
The small cuts that littered the arms and torso of the body were deep as if made by a small but sharp knife. Draco cast a spell but he couldn't find any kind of poison in the cuts. He had been avoiding the huge wounds at the neck and wrists but he inspected them now.
"No, Harry. This isn't about the case at all actually." Kingsley said. Draco frowned in confusion, if not then why did Kingsley want to see them?
"Potter?
It's like I flipped open a switch. Her eyes light up and she shows me a kind of tube that she had been holding.
heartless." Potter's words were spoken flatly.
"Does it hurt or anything?" Potter asks.
; one of the most stubborn person Harry knew.
A few minutes later, he saw Draco enter the room again, this time with a cup of tea in hand. Harry noticed that Draco's hand was shaking and now he was starting to worry.
Draco paid his amount; 75 galleons and Potter paid his own.
"There is nothing I can do against the Minister even if I tried. The man has sources." Harry admitted.
Draco was, utterly and absolutely doomed.
"What? Of course not mother! I- can't you ask someone else for help?"
So that was Chapter 5..I do hope you liked it..Once again constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome. I'll try to post the new Chapter as soon as I can..♡♡
"Potter? You do realize I was just joking, right?"
Draco closed his mouth and wiped his lips with as much dignity as he could muster, which wasn't much.
From the few days that he had spent in the company of Potter and the other Aurors, Draco had gathered a lot of things about his former arch nemesis. Not that he had been looking for them, mind you. It was just his tendency of being extremely observant making itself prominent.
"Just tell him you like him, Draco." Pansy said.
Harry was taken aback by the spark of honesty and sorrow that appeared in Malfoy's eyes. It was so unlike him that Harry couldn't help but stare.
"You make it sound so…heartless, Harry. It wasn't like that." Kingsley spoke nervously although it sounded as if he was reassuring himself as much as Potter.
Potter grinned in reply at him. Draco rolled his eyes at the actually happy expression on the git's face.
Draco nodded shakily and moved forward, his wand in his hand.
He glances at Mother, who is observing the scene unfold with a crease between her eyebrows. Draco was taller than Potter at school but not anymore. Now Potter has more muscle mass on him. While Draco is lean but not extremely slim, Potter is muscular but not extremely bulky. It is a good combination, Draco's mind supplies. Draco blushes at his train of thoughts then looks up at Potter through his lashes.
The man was an Auror too, a handsome one at that with chestnut brown hair, warm eyes of honey brown and a strong jaw.
Potter, damn him, having noticed his obvious embarrassment gives him a reassuring smile.
Almost half an hour later, Harry walked up the stairs, deciding it was enough time for Draco to take out his anger on the walls of their room. But as Harry neared their bedroom and the broken sobs that were undoubtedly made by Draco, reached his ears, Harry realized how wrong he was.
"You can eat at mine and Hermione's tonight. Long time since we've talked, huh?" Ron said.
"Shall we get started with our meeting then?" Kingsley asked. Draco nodded in reply and followed him to what looked like his own office. "This is my office. We won't be interrupted here. Do take a seat, Mr. Malfoy." Kingsley gestured to two armchairs infront of the desk he was sitting behind.
Draco had been very tired the night he had learnt that quality of Potter's. They were both in the hidden room where the potion and paste were kept, Draco investigating the green paste and Potter thinking about the possible suspects for the creator of the potion Draco was examining.
"Potter? He's here?" I ask confusedly. The last time I had seen him was when he had removed my Mark. I still wasn't used to the Markless skin on my arm.
"Harry, Mr. Malfoy informed me of the leads you discovered in this case." Kingsley started.
"Morning, Mother." Draco greeted her.
But this time instead of leaving me be, Potter hooks a finger under my chin and tilts my face up. I would've blushed again had it not been for the redness already on my face.
Harry knew what those words meant, knew who they were coming from, anyone could tell, but that was impossible, wasn't it? He was dead; Voldemort was dead. He couldn't come back, no. He was buried deep under the black sea, his body probably in pieces. But here he was, even in death he was haunting Harry.
"What the heck is that?" I shout backing away. Merlin knows what she's about to do. You can never tell with a girl like Pansy.
He had learnt that Potter hated, absolutely
"Don't grin so wide Potter, you'll split your face in half." Draco had smirked but he had forgotten who he was talking to. Of course Harry freaking Potter had a better reply.
"What?" Ron asked after finishing his cake.
"Apply this on your arm. If the pain or itch increases, go to St. Mungos immediately." He says and hands me the bottle, considering Draco still hasn't looked up from staring at his now markless skin. I nod to Potter in thanks and he nods back, to both me and Blaise.
"Perhaps that is part of the reason of my choice to work with the Aurors." Was all Draco said.
Inside was a huge table surrounded by chairs. A wardrobe filled with books and ancient items stood on the opposite side.
"Er- Pansy?" I ask confusedly. I have know idea why she stopped talking suddenly.
. Anything ranging from stupid and useless facts to some of the most important things the world has seen.
Dolohov kept quiet, so Harry continued, "I know, Dolohov. You serve him and help me too, because, when one day one of us wins, you'll be in favour with both. It's cowardly but clever enough, I'll give you that."
And he couldn't do anything as his whole body turned into nothing but ash-like powder.
"Oh? You haven't?" Harry raised an eyebrow.
"Probably?"
Draco's heart drops. He was never able to produce a Patronus. He had tried, of course. In hideen spots at his home or Hogwarts but he probably had too much trauma in his mind too produce a Patronus. Probably seeing Draco's inner turmoil on his face, Harry peers at him with concerned eyes.
of all people? He knew very well that I had a thing for Potter. I believe I was very... expressive.. about it, back in school. Before I could confront Blaise, Pansy grabbed my arm.
"Because we're...friends."
He had been thinking and knew he should ask the librarian
"Which man? Tell me, Farley,
Beside the dagger was a pile of what looked like powder. Harry touched it lightly but it was what he had predicted, powder. It was of a metal, bronze or copper likely.
He saw Mother's eyes widen a little, "What kind of a deal is this, Draco?"
"Yeah, I know. Come to mine and Hermione's tonight. We'll talk." Ron said. Harry nodded distractedly, the potion was rushing like adrenaline in his veins and he felt wide awake.
Draco sips his butterbeer in silence. Infront of him Blaise and Pansy bicker like they usually do, their butterbeers forgotten. Draco clears his throat to remind them of his presence.
Draco closes his eyes again and thinks. He has no idea what other memory there is so he just thinks of his first day at Hogwarts but once again only smoke comes out.
Draco closed his eyes and thought of the way Harry had hugged him, the way Harry had rocked him back and forth, the way Harry's warm hand had massaged Draco's head on the night of Draco's panic attack. Draco wanted Harry to do that again, do that and so much more. Draco imagined Harry's soft, pink lips touching his. Imagined Harry's warm hand on Draco's cheek. Even though Draco had never been kissed, involved in war and being a Death Eater and all, he knew that a kiss was magical. He wanted to experience it with Harry. Wanted Harry to be his first kiss, his first boyfriend, his first everything. So with that feeling, that hope, that wish in mind, Draco shouted Expecto Patronum and in his heart he knew he had done it this time even before opening his eyes.
"It's okay, Draco, just say it." Harry prompted his extremely nervous boyfriend.
of Malfoy.
"Its okay. Not many wizards or witches can find their magical cores at the first try. Now I want to see whether your magic has completely vanished or is very little. Since you can't find your magical core yet, we have two options. Either you take your time and find your magic, if there is any within you, or let me enter your mind and find it for you." Harry says.
It was so much more magical, as cringy as it sounds, than Draco had imagined. Harry's lips tasted like tea, mint and something that was solely Harry. His lips were soft as a feather on Draco's and Draco felt like his heart would burst any second by how fast it was beating. He closed his eyes and tightened his fists even more, wishing Harry couldn't feel Draco's shaking hands. Soon Draco felt Harry's lips move against his own so Draco tried to move his' own in sync with Harry's. It felt like centuries had passed as Harry and Draco stayed as close to each other as humanly possible. Draco felt something soft and wet trace his lips, which he was pretty sure was Harry's tongue. The feeling was so different and so sublime than anything Draco had ever felt. Draco felt Harry's tongue enter his mouth and it tortured Draco in the sweetest way possible. Shyly  at first, Draco invaded Harry's mouth with his own tongue too but when he felt Harry moan in his mouth, Draco became more confident and his actions became more sure.
Malfoy chuckled half-heartedly, "Don't change the topic, Potter. I am aware of that tactic."
Harry left him alone with his thoughts and went back to his parchment where he had been scribbling; "Possible Evidences and Suspects". So far, he had managed to write the following:
"Do you think-" Draco was about to ask Potter how he knew whether this man wouldn't be the next Voldemort but his words were interrupted when the door of Kingsley's office opened and he entered, looking sombre.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay just give it another try. Think of a more happy memory, something that was the best thing in your life." Harry says.
I posed again and still something seemed off. I thought about what it was and then it came to me; the glasses. They were too hideous so I tried to transform them into something better. After many tries, I achieved a silver frame, it's shape was round except for the top edge where it was shaped like a cat eye of sort. Hmm.. better. I am about to look for shoes when I hear a tap at the window. It's Pansy's owl.
With a frustrated sigh Harry roughly cut the names of the other two potioneers; the name Draco Lucius Malfoy glistening brightly on the page, facing him mockingly.
. It's hard not to when it is all the man demands. I can't, I
"You...you found this
"I am not asking you to forget about him, Mother. I know that you both loved each other a lot but please, for my sake and yours, don't hope for him to come back. You and I both know it won't ever happen. It will only bring harm to you Mother, if you keep wishing him to come back. It will only break your heart when he won't. He made his choice when he chose evil over his family." Draco said softly, disgust colouring his voice at the end.
I roll my eyes at his answer. "I meant you like him, don't you?"
"Drayyyy!" I heard a particularly shrill voice shout, no doubt belonging to Pansy.
"Aww, bummer. I wanted to see the Head Auror in action." Draco said sarcastically. He wanted to make that smile atleast falter a little.
Harry and Malfoy sat in awkward silence. It suddenly struck Harry how absurd it was, sitting with Draco Malfoy in a fancy restaurant, waiting for their order to arrive.
"Ron you're not helping!" Hermione exclaimed, though she looked like she was suppressing a laugh herself.
Draco rolled his eyes, "Doesn't mean you should eat like a heathen."
Malfoy sighed, "So that's why half of the Ministry hates me."
Draco thought the wizard might have done exactly that but he didn't say so. No need to terrify the poor man further.
Draco's smile vanished at that. This case was hard and confusing but he was sure he could solve it. "I will, I'm sure of it."
"You will do exactly as I say, Draco because you promised you would." Narcissa says calmy, taking a sip from her tea.
"Just let me eat, okay? I don't have time to eat with one fork and slice with the other." Potter said, his mouth still full.
Now he groaned once again as Ginny worked on his hair rather cruelly. According to her it was "grown out rather sexily" and that Harry would look "very hot in a man bun". Harry let her style his hair, mainly to keep her happy.
Draco had thought long and hard about this. The reason for finally deciding to take a vacation was not because of the case he was assigned, though that was certainly part of it. Draco had never taken a vacation before. A few sick leaves certainly but never week or month long holidays. He wanted to spend some time on himself, some time with his Mother to take her mind of Lucius and remind her that her son was always there for her and cared about her a lot. The partnership with the Aurors gave him a final push towards taking the long deserved oppurtunity.
I am caught off-guard by how much sadness and tiredness comes over Potter's face. I turn to look at Blaise who is as surprised as me.
"Even if he did, he won't call us in his office for it. It must be something important." A sense of dread filled Harry as his smile vanished. Had there been another murder? Apparently, Malfoy was thinking along similar lines if his paler face and wide eyes were any indication.
"Yes, of course." She was watching him, with an incredulous expression on her face.
"I am sorry Mrs. Malfoy. I was just thinking. Anyways....uh...so as to why you are here?" Harry internally cringed at how impolite he sounded.
With a pop, he disapparated to his office.
If anyone would've told him that he would be sitting in front of Draco Malfoy and be grinning at him like a maniac, he would've called them crazy; he couldn't have spent a single moment with Malfoy and enjoy it.
"Thank you." He says genuinely.
Harry was brought back from his thoughts by Malfoy's voice, "Do you have the potion sample that was collected?" He asked.
He sat at the chair at the end of the table; the chair of the Head of a Family while Narcissa sat on his right side. Draco helped himself to a generous helping of the shepherd's pie the house-elves had cooked.
No one approaches me for an autograph or photo, probably because no one expects me to be here and the lighting is very dark. Thank Merlin for small favours.
?" Ron asked, pausing in between for dramatic effect.
Taking a deep breath, Draco knocked on Harry's door. The door swung open immediately, as though Harry was waiting for Draco on the other side, there goes Draco's wishful thinking again.
Harry muttered, "What would you be disturbing?" Malfoy had leaned back by now to maintain a respectable amount of distance between them. Harry missed their close proximity.
responsibility." Malfoy pointed an accusatory finger in Harry's direction.
I smirk, both at the fact that I made him admit the truth and that he called Draco
At the moment, the Dark wizard was blind with rage;
"Yes, my name. Not Potter, Harry."
Harry saw recognition glimmer in the man's eyes as he limped closer, saw his eyes dart to Harry's forehead like it almost always did with new people he met. Harry ignored it all, it wasn't what he was here for.
Farley was writhing in pain beneath him, screaming for help. His hands were clutching his head. The cane he used for support clattered to the ground, his only stable leg was unable to hold his weight for long, resulting in him falling loudly to the dusty floor.
"I see. So it had nothing to do with a certain someone murdering innocents left and right?" Harry saw Dolohov flinch at the words again.
"You can't produce a Patronus?" Harry asks him.
I suddenly felt a discomfort in my arm. I looked down from Potter's face and my eyes widened. The snake was
. It was the doing of those damned Ministry aurors. All their doing.
Harry, realizing her implication probably at him not wearing a shirt, blushes involuntarily.
"Except my ego." Draco mutters but still stands in the middle of the room.
"What? I didn't do anything." She said a little too innocently.
Narcissa raises an eyebrow. "No matter what price I pay them, no professional would ever disgrace their name by helping a Malfoy."
Harry frowned at Malfoy's words, even though they were spoken in almost a whisper, Harry had heard them. "What do you mean by that?" He asked with a frown.
Draco lay in his bed, still awake. He wouldn't admit it but Potter's reaction had affected him more than he would've liked. Draco knew Potter didn't like him, he had made it all too clear at Hogwarts but when he spoke at Draco's trial, a part of Draco thought he could change Potter's opinion about himself but today, after seeing the disgust in his eyes, Draco could feel his heart break into a million pieces. Why was he helping Draco when he didn't want to see him make progress? Hadn't he said again and again how he hoped Draco made progress? Was the admiration and pride in his eyes when Draco was able to feel his magic fake? Draco hadn't expected Potter to return Draco's feelings but spending time with Potter, albeit very little had gotten to his head. He should just quit their lessons. It would be better for both him and Potter. His heart would break of course but Draco's heart was already so broken, his only hope of Potter mending it back had gone away, crushing the broken pieces to dust.
"I just..." Harry started then trailed off. He didn't know how to do this.
He was about to panic when he caught the sheepish and embarrassed look on Potter's face. Draco raised an eyebrow as Potter's stomach gave another loud growl.
"With all due respect, Auror Potter, I think your gut feeling is probably wrong." Farley's fingers tightened on his cane; a gesture not gone unnoticed by the Senior Auror.
Potter nods." Malfoy can you perform any spells at all?" He asks looking at Draco.
I recognized soon enough what it was...a spell to transform a book into one you wished. It was complicated, requires a strong magical core. I couldn't believe that he...he was powerful enough to perform it. And then he just...left."
"Why not?" Harry asked.
Harry didn't know why but he had found himself observing Malfoy more and more. Then he had seen the rusty colour spread on Malfoy's pale cheeks just because of a simple innuendo he had made or a little smirk he had given. Harry had found it amusing to continue to make Malfoy flustered, considering it was a rare sight, so he had continued the acts.
Potter shrugged in reply, "Any particular suggestion?" He raised an eyebrow at Draco who thought for a while.
"I thought you'd be more excited than that to know that we might get somewhere with this case." Malfoy spoke flatly, the ecstatic emotion no longer on his face. It was better. At least Harry could look him in the eye now.
"Malfoy- Malfoy it's okay, I-" but the use of 'Malfoy' had brought more fear in his eyes. So Harry tried again.
Draco's mouth went dry at the thought of examining those bodies but he took a deep breath and got up.
"Okay, I wanted to enhance your beauty so-" She suddenly stopped speaking and her eyes widen as her mouth drops open.
Healer Brandon nodded encouragingly, his hazel eyes sparkling, "Good for you, Healer Malfoy. Certainly a good decesion. This says you want to start your month long-vacation from today?" He gestured to Draco's application.
"Mr. Malfoy. You have now made the deal and cannot back out, I am pretty sure you knew that already." Kingsley asked. Draco nodded in reply as Kingsley slid his hand in front of him. Draco shook it, feeling the hard and callous skin underneath, the hands of an auror.
"Draco? Since when do you call him Draco?"
"What would you young men like?" The waiter who had given them the menu asked, his hands clasped in front of him.
"Harry." Kingsley interrupted Potter's screams with a calm voice. His posture showed that he was rather use to of these kinds of aggressive fits from Potter. "You know that we have a ball every year. Don't you remember the last time we-"
Draco was once again speechless. He had no idea what Harry saw in him. Draco was pale, pointy and bony. Harry could have anyone he wanted and he chose Draco? The thought made Draco's heart flutter but he wasn't sure it was true.
"What's wrong, sweetheart?" Harry asked but he turned back to his file. He knows that Draco didn't like being pampered or babied even when he was feeling sad or nervous.
"Well... Narcissa Malfoy said I owed her a life debt and then I had no other choice" Harry shrugs.
"But-" Draco spluttered, until Potter cut him off with an impatient roll of the eyes. "Oh come on, Malfoy live a little. I'm dying from hunger here; we need to do something quickly. Or the Chosen One will vanquish. Who will be there to save the world then?" Potter was grinning widely at Draco.
So he nodded at Kingsley, "I'll accept."
A sudden thought occurred to Draco, why was such a dangerous book kept freely in a public library? He'd have to talk to the librarian there about this matter but at the moment he needed to solve this case.
"Do you recognize this, Mr. Farley? Was it, by any chance, sold or bought from your shop?"
"I see." Was all Malfoy said before going back to thinking deeply again, a frown on his face. Did Harry look like that too when he was deep in thought? Probably not, he looked
Harry's vision had now gone completely black; he couldn't see a thing, couldn't even see the suspicious turn of the head from the suspected criminal as he heard the sound of breathing coming from nearby.
"Sure." Draco dropped the bottle in Kingsley's outstretched palm. He wanted to go home, eat and sleep in his soft, warm bed. The thought of home reminded Draco of how worried Mother had been when he had left and his desire to apparate back at the Manor increased.
"Mother." Draco spoke after a few bites, trying to get his Mother's attention.
"I see. What was the first spell you tried to perform, though?"
"Ancient things are always the most informative." Draco spoke in a low voice, hoping to cast some influence over Potter too.
Draco's eyes widen at that. He doesn't want Potter to enter his mind at all but he doesn't want to delay using magic.
Harry needed to tell someone about how much he wanted Draco or he would go crazy, he needed advice, needed to know how he would control himself from holding Draco tightly to his chest when he would be seeing Draco out the door of his house, not knowing whether he will ever be able to see him step in again. So Harry had asked Ron and Hermione to come over and help him. He had talked to Charlie through letters, because Charlie was visiting Bulgaria for some work but all he had gotten as a reply was to confess all his feelings to Draco, which Harry probably wasn't Gryffindor enough to do.
With a sigh he told Malfoy everything; the visit to Mr. Farley, his words and everything that had happened to him. Harry watched as Malfoy's eyes widened comically with every word he spoke and he thought about entirely omitting the connection he'd made from the discussion they were currently having. But he decided against it; Malfoy was a responsible man, not a child who'd be terrified of a threat that wasn't even directed at him in the first place.
~~~●●●~~~
"Hermione! Give it a rest. You can tell Harry about your research after dinner alright?" Ron says, getting up to go to the kitchen where Molly had called him for help. Hermione huffs but doesn't say anything. Random chatter breaks out in the living room and as Harry looks around at the the people who have loved and cared for him so much, he feels his heart swell with happiness.
Harry smirked back, "I'm pretty sure that you have agreed to work with the Aurors, that is, me?" He asked.
"But why in Salazar's name would you do that?" Draco asked, forgetting who was sitting infront of him for a second.
Scanning the list Harry found a name that filled him with both surprise and dread:
His eyes widen further. "What- me, like Draco Malfoy?...pshhtt.. no way, Parkinson. Don't flatter yo-"
"Yes, I'm sure he never hugs anyone just like that." Blaise added.
"I have recently made a deal with the Ministry. With the Aurors, to be specific." Draco spoke calmly but he wasn't feeling that emotion, instead he felt anxious. Not because he was worried what Mother would say. He was now an adult; he could make his own choices without caring about his parents' opinion but he
"Gaze up, Draco. You are making me feel ashamed." Narcissa says when Potter leaves the room to find Kreacher. Draco nods and looks around the room.
Draco shook his head, bringing himself out of his thoughts. He needed to focus on this case. He grabbed another book, Potions in the Past, and searched for the section on jewels.
"He's so stubborn, there's no point in arguing with him. But that's what makes him such an exceptional auror." Kingsley sighed. "Come on, Mr. Malfoy, let's investigate the bodies first then you can examine the potion."
He started to play with a stray lock of hair which looked very soft and silky and I just wanted to run my hands through Potter's hair while our mouths would be joined together as we- I take a deep breath to banish those thoughts from my mind and prevent myself from getting even more embarrassed by displaying a fucking hard-on.
With a trembling finger, the man traced the painting of an antique looking gold dagger, its hilt decorated with gleaming emeralds.
The next day Draco apparates at Potter's place all alone at exactly 11:48 a.m. He knocks on the door and waits for Potter to open it. As soon as Potter does Draco nods him in greeting and recieves a nod in return. Today Potter is dressed in muggle clothing. He is wearing a weird green shirt with two strings hanging on his chest and some fabric hanging on his back. Draco has no idea what the garment is but whatever it is called, in Draco's opinion it is a disgrace to respectful clothing. So when Potter turns around to meet Draco's eyes in the living room, Draco being his usual embarrassing self blurts out,"What the hell are you even wearing, Potter?!" Then he immediately claps his hand over his mouth and his eyes widen.
get the idea of getting to know Malfoy? This was absolutely ridiculous.
Ron approaced him slowly, as one approaches a wild animal. Harry eyed him warily. "You've...made a truce...with Draco fucking
Harry knocked on Kingsley's office door. Amanda had just informed him that the Senior Head Auror had wanted to see him in his office.
"And you? Don't you deserve to be happy?" Malfoy asked. He was leaning forward, close to Harry's face. Harry could see specks of blue in his grey eyes, sparkling with an emotion Harry didn't know or was too afraid to know.
good.
It wasn't like the way the Dark Lord spoke at all. Even though it was the same language, anyone could tell whatever Potter was saying was different from what
"Use some sense, Potter. Order something less expensive and you'll have to pay less." Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's remark. He knew that much.
"That's what I can't decide. Why would they want me there if they hated me?" He asked.
During Auror training Harry had learnt many spells that could be used to detect if a person was lying but at the moment, he didn't need one to confirm that this man was.
"He'll...he'll strike at the ball." Dolohov said.
Draco sat in the cushioned, white armchair and slid the piece of parchment towards his boss. "I want a vacation." He said.
"Well yeah." Harry muttered, not meeting their eyes and playing with a loose thread of his hoodie.
"Let's just go and see." Harry got up and so did Malfoy. They apparated to Kingsley's office, bracing themselves for what was to come ahead.
Draco chanted in his mind and looked at one of the bodies closely.
As Harry stood, breathing hard and staring at the expression of hurt and fury that passed over Malfoy's face, Harry realized that he had gone too far.
"Er…I'll take the...Butter chicken with…curry. Make the spice level 5." Harry handed his menu back too.
In one there is a red haired witch and a man who looks like a carbon copy of Potter, probably his parents. In the other there is the Weasel, Granger and Potter. One has all of the Weasleys and Potter. One with Longbottom, Thomas and the other Gryffindor Potter hung out with. There are many photos of Potter with his classmates, Potter in Hogwarts along with newspaper cuttings, letters and even a few badges.
Harry grinned because that was the only thing, he could think of doing and saw Malfoy grin back.
I somehow managed to close my mouth but I couldn't speak from shock.

~~~●●●~~~
"Potter...just...be careful." Dolohov said.
Draco entered the quiet library, the smell of parchment and dust hitting his nostrils. He walked towards the old aged librarian hunched over a table, his wand twirling as books sorted themselves into neat piles in front of him.
He grew specially close to Charlie. Charlie had come back from Romania, wanting to live with his family from now on. He soon came out to his family, told them how he liked boys and the Weasleys happily accepted him. At first Harry was surprised to know that two boys could be together but soon he learnt it wasn't anything different. He realized how he loved being with boys as well as girls and then, with a little help from Charlie, he embraced his bisexuality and came out to his family, friends and the whole wizarding world.
《POV Change》
with Malfoy but Harry shut that part up for good. It was only for a little fun, of course, nothing more.
Just as he was thinking that it couldn't get any worse, he started hearing something. It was not the sharp ringing that had been buzzing in his ears before, no this was something different, something so much more terrifying.
Pansy drags what feels like a brush along both of my eyes.
Kingsley's eyebrows rose and a look of surprise came over his face. "Are you sure, Mr. Malfoy?"
There was one more question I wanted to ask. Perhaps Potter saw it in my eyes, or he saw the trembling of my arm as I held it infront of him, but he said gently, "Anymore questions?"
"I want you to return the favour because I need your help now."
Harry shook his head at Ron's suggestion, "John isn't on this case."
"Yes, Harry. Do take a seat." Kingsley nodded to the two armchairs in front of his desk. Harry obeyed the command and waited for Shacklebolt to state the purpose of calling him here.
Potter rolled his eyes but Draco could tell it was half-hearted. Was something the matter?
We all wait for the official to come in and when he does, our mouths hang open. The unruly mop of black hair, the emerald green eyes and the infamous lightning scar, I could recognize Potter anywhere.
I posed infront of the mirror from every angle. Today was Pansy's birthday. I had been owling her, taking advice on chatting up a person, likes and dislikes of Draco, what I should wear, all kinds of suggestions, and because of that she was now Pansy from Parkinson.
. You shouldn't even
"Yes. That is the reason I am here. Sir Shacklebolt said that you would be telling me the details of this case?" Malfoy arched an eyebrow.
"N-no." Draco casts his eyes downwards, feeling ashamed.
Healer Brandon raised an eyebrow at him after reading the application he had been presented. "Your first vacation, Healer Malfoy? I must say it is pretty surprising but you do deserve a good rest. May I ask what brings you to take some days off work?"
Draco carefully removed the cork from the vial and emptied the whole bottle into a little dish. The potion glistened under the light, looking like the most mesmerizing thing one would ever see.
Your comments and kudos mean a lot to me..
"No." Draco replied shyly.
"Master Malfoy, someones at the door. He said they were from the Minis-"
Malfoy frowned for a long time after that, his unseeing gaze directed at the file opened in front of him and his fingers rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
"Who said I didn't want to?" Potter raised a brow.
"Trying to impress someone?" My mirror asked in that quirky voice of hers. I had always hated her snide remarks but today they won't affect me. I flashed her a charming grin in reply.
"Stop making me blush, Potter." I hiss, not looking at him.
He lifted his wand out like a person does after stabbing someone with a knife and a cloud of black smoke came out of my arm. The snake screeched so loudly that I felt like my ear drums would burst. Pansy and Blaise removed their hands where they had placed them to comfort me, to probably to cover their ears.
Love ~Goldhearts♡♡
Harry already knew that Malfoy was good at potions, second only to Hermione, but seeing him on this list was definitely astounding.
"Don't be stupid, Potter. I'm pretty sure Draco won't hex you if you ask him out nicely."
"Oh." He says, staring at me dumbly.
"Auror Potter. I wish to speak with someone from the cleaning department." Harry said.
He whispered in a cold and dangerous voice, "We are Aurors, Malfoy, we are soldiers, not sheep." All thoughts of remaining professional left his mind as he stared with blazing eyes at Malfoy. If Kingsley wanted Harry to respect Malfoy, he wouldn't be obeying until Malfoy actually earned that respect.
"Sure? You mean you want to be friends?" Draco wanted to hex Potter now. Wasn't he the one who had requested that in the first place?
"Robards didn't assign me this case, Kingsley did. And I'm not alone. I have to work with-" Harry muttered something incomprehensible, hoping Ron would just let it go. But of course he didn't, it was
"Merlin, Potter. I don't know what to do!" Draco shouted.
"Don't flatter yourself, Potter. I don't care about your ugly face." Draco had exclaimed and busied his hands with the potion he was supposed to be investigating.
"When did you brew Amortentia?" Potter had raised a brow.
"He doesn't like me and I am not going to embarass myself anymore."
"I have to go to work. I'll see you around." Harry got up. It was too early to go to work yet, Ron wasn't even up but Ginny didn't say anything, just nodded with sympathetic eyes.
"What about you?" Harry asked. His heart was racing, his palms sweaty.
We argue back and forth until my glasses slip off from my nose. I can only blink as Pansy catches them in her outstretched hands.
Potter chuckled, he seemed to be getting his old self back. "No it wasn't 1000 galleons."
At first, there were a few disappearances. And after that, a few deaths were reported. When the Aurors were sent to investigate, they discovered an abandoned house, with wards around it – And it reeked of dark magic.
Kingsley chuckled again, "That's just how the Aurors are, Mr. Malfoy. You require a lion heart to become an Auror. To choose to die willingly for your people rather than live a life ridden with guilt is a hard choice to make but we must make it. However, such life and death situations rarely arise, Mr. Malfoy and all Aurors are aware of these conditions before they choose to join our force. Anyways, you shouldn't worry about that. Tell me, are you willing to help us in this case?" Kingsley asked.
He replayed the man's words in his head;
"Did you see Dray?"
Harry looks at him, really looks at him after all these years. He looks at Malfoy's soft creamy skin, his almond shaped grey eyes, his pointed but attractive chin and his high sharp cheekbones. Handsome. As though a door snapping shut, Harry breaks out of his thoughts, not liking the direction they were going in at all.
"Let's just stop. Clearly I can't do this." Draco exclaims in frustration after his 12th try and sits down on the sofa, cradling his head in his hands.
I ran to my fireplace and stood infront of it. Soon it turned green and Pansy's face appeared.
With a nod Harry told him everything they knew of the case. The descriptions of the Dark wizard that the people of Purely had given, the house he was living in and the way the dark wards surrounding it felt, and of course the potion that was being brewed there.
And when he looked down at me, those beautiful eyes shining and those soft lips stretched in the most gorgeous smile I've ever seen, I couldn't resist it. Without thinking I reached on my toes, removing my hand from his and putting both my arms around his neck, I pressed my lips to his.
"We-uh..ummm" Potter continued to stutter until I decided to take pity on him. Seeing him flustered had increased my courage (and to be honest it was rather cute. Ugh, I'm getting sappy again.)
"Who? Who came here, Asper?" Draco demanded.
"I'm going to talk to the snake, then detach it by a spell the Ministry discovered." Potter explained with an impatient sigh.
Realizing how shitty of him it was to run away without even a "Congratulations " Harry sits in his room and drafts an "I'm so very sorry" letter. He was done with it by 1 a.m. According to Harry, it was alright.
end this wannabe Voldemort once and for all." With that, Harry strode out.
"Yes."
." Asper sounded awed and terrified.
Harry sighed and placed his head on the back of the chair he was seated in. "It's a bunch of reasons really." He started to speak; it had been a long time since he'd talked to someone. "First of all, he didn't really deserve his position. The only reason he became Minister was because the Head of the Wizengamot is someone he knows. It was all corruption and injustice. They covered him getting the position by saying that he had fought many death eaters, it was a noble act, blah blah. Noble act my arse. All he did was kill Death Eaters who had completed their punishments in Azkaban. Only, no one knew they had." Harry sighed, he detested not being able to do anything against the injustices.
"Sure, Malfoy, sure." Potter had laughed richly and Draco hadn't spoken to him at all that day. However, the 'Ignore Potter' charade did not last long since they were supposed to be partners and discuss the case together.
"Here, have some whisky. I have to talk to my guests." Pansy thrust a cup in my hand, then she poked the guy beside me in the shoulder and walked away. I frowned at her strange behaviour but kept drinking from my cup.
Then he turned back to Kingsley. "Look at this." Draco showed him the vial. Kingsley inspected it closely then raised an eyebrow.
Darkness surrounded Harry, the only sound that reached his ears was his own laboured breathing. Suddenly, the lights came back on and Harry stared at his surroundings.
"How does the potion make you feel?" Malfoy's eyes were glinting with curiosity and impatience.
"Nothing. Let's go." I whisper back. I could tell him, he knows about Draco's feelings too but he just won't understand and doesn't care enough.
"You should know not to shout in the library, Mr. Potter." The man said in a croaky but stern voice.
I whistle. "You look.."
"Pansy said she'd meet you by the drinks." Blaise said as he reached me. He looked at me from head to toe.
Harry cautiously walked towards the place where he had seen the object in the photograph, casting spells to detect any jinxes.
"Don't fear him, Farley. It will only feed his power." Harry's voice was calm unlike the panic raging inside him.
That night all Draco could think was that he had done it, he had gotten his magic back and he had made Harry his; the two things that were his biggest desires.
"What are you going to do?" I asked him worriedly as Potter stood up to move away from the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
So here's Chapter 3. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Your kudos and comments mean a lot and keep me going!
Will nodded, "Yeah. I'll be pleased to go with you." He gave Potter a small smile and Draco's stomach tightened when Potter smiled back. It wasn't even one of his fake smiles, no it was a full-on genuine smile that had Draco's blood boiling for not being directed at him.
"But, Draco, my child, you already have a job. A great one too. You don't need anymore favour from the Ministry." Draco knew that his Mother would pursue this topic for a long time but he didn't want to argue with her, besides there was something else to be addressed.
He had managed to send red sparks in the air but before he could stun the man, he had already disapparated. Smith had come running in, asking Harry what had happened but Harry couldn't reply.
"The case of course. Whoever is doing this isn't an ordinary wizard." Potter's words sent a chill down Draco's spine. "We'll be fine, though. Can't be worse than good old Voldy, can he?" Draco absolutely did not understand how Potter could take the situation so lightly or speak about the Dark Lord this way.
It was a dull emerald green but as Draco moved his lit wand around it, little green pieces glittered in the shining light. It was as if crushed emeralds were added in a slimy green paste and applied around the wounds. Or it was what had caused the injuries in the first place.
His breathing was coming in uneven short bursts. Harry clawed at his throat with pale, shaking hands; hoping to get some air in his lungs but his efforts were futile. Just then the hissing became more prominent as he felt a familiar burst of pain from the infamous scar on his forehead.
I frowned, why was Potter here at
Kingsley's praise left Harry feeling warm but he didn't show any signs of being flattered by it. On the other hand, he had never worked on a case alone in the 6 years of being an Auror. Harry was pretty sure that Ron and Hermione counted in "everyone" and he couldn't get their help in this either.
Potter grabbed my wrist gently and I felt my heart flutter at the contact. He closed his eyes for a few seconds. I felt Pansy and Blaise stare at my arm too. Their presence reassured me, told me they were always there for me.
"Malfoy?" The guy spoke and now I was perfectly sure this
Harry looked at all the other names on the list and went through their accomplishments and expertise. In the end, he had chosen three names; Stacey Smith, Ezekiel Jones and Draco Malfoy, two of them had to go. Harry rubbed his temples as he thought about who to choose.
on this case!" Malfoy replied with more insistence.
They hadn't seen each other since the war except for the few respectful nods they had shared when Harry visited St. Mungo’s. Malfoy was a Senior Healer and was widely known for his astounding healing abilities. Harry hadn't taken him for a healer but then again, he didn't really know anything about Malfoy, did he?
But here he was, stuck with Malfoy's company and actually
I see Potter nod and he reaches in his robe to pull out a tiny vial filled to the brim with a sky blue liquid.
I cover my ears from the ear-splitting sound Draco's Mark just made. I watch in horror as smoke coming from Draco's arm, connected to Potter's wand at one end goes into the glass jar Potter had taken out before. He puts the lid on but before he can close it tightly, Draco's body goes limp and he falls forward. Potter catches him before he falls to the floor.
." Harry sniffed, turning another page, not really seeing what was on it.
"Sure, let's go." Draco issued the book from the librarian who gave Potter a withering glare.
Draco had nothing to say to that. He had spent so much time with Harry and he would even call them great friends now but thinking of stopping the moments they spent together brought a strange ache to Draco's heart. He was sure Harry wouldn't want to hang out with him after these lessons. He had only agreed to help Draco to return an owed favour, hadn't he? He hadn't chose to teach Draco because he had wanted to spend time with him. As much as Draco wished it was true, he didn't want to build a false hope in his heart and have it broken into pieces. He wouldn't do that to himself.
Then Potter put the tip of his wand directly in the middle of the skull and said something in Parseltongue again. The snake was now writhing, trying to reach Potter but either it wasn't that long or Potter's wand was doing something to it. I felt a discomfort in my arm but it wasn't very painful. Potter's one hand that was still gripping my wrist loosened a little and without looking up he muttered lowly, "Don't move your arm." I nodded even though Potter couldn't see it.
"Nothing. This is just – so you." Harry replied with a little laugh.
Narcissa takes a deep breath and knocks on the door. It is exactly 11:59 p.m. as mother so kindly reminded Draco that punctuality makes a great impression. Draco doesn't know whether she knew about his crush on Potter and was trying to rub it in his face or whether it was another one of her "pure-blood rules" bullshit.
After some minutes, Potter had eaten his own food and was eyeing Draco's in what he thought was probably an inconspicuous manner. Draco had to admit, he was too full to eat anymore of his dish so he had no objection to giving some of it to Potter.
Draco's eyes widen at that. Reducto was much more advanced than Wingardium Leviosa.
This didn't explain anything about the book.
The chilly voice was his only companion as it laughed, a cruel and icy sound. "Look at yourself, Harry Potter. You're nothing in front of me." The voice whispered.
Instead he looked around the room he was sitting in. The girl was sitting behind a black wooden desk, her mouth still moving continuously. Draco gave her a disgusted look which she didn't even notice, and looked around. There were a few plants around the room. All for decoration and not one of them useful. Draco shook his head in disappointment. On the far wall, opposite to where he was sitting, were a bunch of framed articles. Draco peered closely but then moved forward to read whatever was written there.
Afraid someone might've heard him, Draco turns, wiping his eyes with the sleeves of his nightgown but all he sees is an owl outside his window, a letter tied to its leg. Who would send him a letter at this time of the night? A horrible thought worms its way into his mind. Was it sent by Father? Did he somehow know Draco was thinking of him? Thinking badly of him? Draco almost ignores the owl but curiousity gets the better of him and he moves towards the window. Even if it was from Father, he can't harm Draco can he? He is in Azkaban, a thousand miles away. With this thought in mind Draco unties the letter from the owl's leg, ruffles its feathers and sits on his bed. Taking a deep breath, he opens the letter and reads it.
"You look ridiculous, Potter." Is all he says then turns on his back and plops himself on Potter's sofa.
Potter held it in a way so that the snake couldn't see the wand. Then he said something in Parseltongue and his face was so full of anger that I flinched. Potter barely noticed, though. He was talking to the snake, practically hissing in anger.
"So you are on a first name basis now which shouldn't be surprising at all." She said with a pointed glare at Ron.
"Pretty. Gorgeous. Exotic, I know."
"I said can you feel your magic?"
With a sigh Draco nods and stands up, disappointed and reluctant.
"I'm sorry. For whatever I did back at Hogwarts." She whispers.
"Can I..uh.. c-can.. umm.. do you-uh-need a hug?" Harry asked stupidly. It was the only thing that made him feel better after a panic attack. Knowing that someone was there for him, that he was safe always made him feel better. Besides, Harry didn't had a choice, did he? He had tried talking to Malfoy but it didn't help and maybe a selfish part of Harry just wanted to hold Malfoy in his arms.
He had been noticing that his Mother seemed happier now, much more carefree. Due to the vacation he had taken from work, he had been able to spend some time with his Mother; a talk in the garden about the flowerbeds, the peacocks, wizarding politics, all neutral topics. Draco felt at ease too, it had been a long time since he had spent a while in his mother's calming company.
Draco grabbed another textbook in his hands. It looked particularly ancient, it's leather cover thawing at the edges. The Dark Arts of Potions was designed on it in peeling gold font. Draco opened the first page and gazed down the contents table. The text was divided in sections on the basis of ingredients which made it even more convenient for Draco.
Thankyou for you comments and kudos! It was the highlight of my day. I am glad you like this story. Please share your thoughts on the new chapter. I will try to post as soon as I can.
Harry stood up too and spoke with equal fervour, "I
Potter was leaning on the table, twirling the knife retrieved from the dark house in his hands. He looked up when Draco entered.
A ringing was in Harry's ears now, he desperately tried to block it as his hands shook with weakness and dropped way from his mouth. He was gasping now, trying to get oxygen into his lungs which seemed impossible as of now. Harry felt tears stinging his eyes. He couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't fucking
No one, absolutely
"This isn't about me. You-" Whatever Malfoy was about to say was lost as the door of Harry's office banged open to reveal Ron.
"You look... different." He says staring at my eyes.
"So I will be asking you a few questions and I want you to answer them truthfully. Don't feel embarassed and if you don't want to answer a question, just say so." Potter says looking at Draco.
"I-I can't teach him. You should talk to a professional."
He was brought back from his thoughts with Mother's soft palm on his cheek. "My love, don't worry about me. I will be fine and so will you. I wish you the best in your deal with the Aurors." She then got up and left the room, leaving Draco with his own thoughts.
"Oh, I don't know. To supervise? I'm pretty sure you aurors don't go about alone?"
"Ready?" Kingsley asked. Draco nodded in reply and watched, frozen in place as Kingsley used his wand to uncover the corpses.
I looked at Pansy with panicked eyes. She knew all about my feelings for Potter. I expected reassurance but Pansy looked just as surprised and shocked as me.
I did like Potter, or you could say I was attracted to him since I didn't know anything about him except what the world knew, to like but I was not sure I trusted him. The last time we met at the trials, he didn't even look at me.
"Oh stop thinking about Potter. Did you see the latest broom? I've heard it is faster than the previous Lighter 2000 they released." After that they hadn't talked about Potter at all, just enjoyed together as they did everytime.
"Oh? Since when do you care about my face, Malfoy?" Potter had raised an eyebrow and smirked. That smirk alone was Draco's undoing; He turned red and averted his eyes.
Soon he went up to his own room too but he didn't sleep, for fear of the dreams that he would see. Fear of hearing his Father's disappointed and hateful voice again.
"There's something you're still hiding." Malfoy stated. It was said with such conviction, Harry was sure Malfoy had somehow performed Legilimency without him knowing.
"You WHAT?!?"
"Hmmm.. Do you want me to be your first kiss, Draco? Would you like that?" Harry asked but Draco didn't know how to respond. Even if he did, Draco wasn't sure he could speak.
