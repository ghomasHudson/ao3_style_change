Severus stared at his glass for a moment, slowly rotating it in his fingers.  “That is for you both to decide.”
“And I had not expected to be here,” the professor said.  He then withdrew his wand and looked expectantly at Lucius.  “Do you mind if I…?”
Thus, it was on bated breath when he finally spotted her walking down the hall a short while later followed closely by a hoard of First Years.
“Yes, there is.” He rubbed his thumb in a gentle circular motion over hers.  “Just – just a minute.  Please?”
So she looked at him, and he looked at her, and before she could formulate any kind of follow-up line to say, he was striding across the eight or ten feet of floor separating them.  Then, without any kind of by-your-leave, he grabbed her by her arms, and before she could even utter a word asking him what he thought he was doing, he was pressing his mouth to hers, and when she finally did realize just what was happening, her response was not the one she thought it would be…
“I was his friend!” she cried, not noticing the Head of Slytherin House as she wailed away.  “Me!  I was the one there for him when he needed someone.  Not her!  Not that – that - “
Hattie Potter stared with disbelieving eyes at the names of the unlikely pair printed side by side on the Marauder’s Map.
Severus raised his eyebrows at him; a look Lucius was sure he employed with his students at school when they made some dunderheaded mistake or asked some trifling question they should already know the answer to.  “Precisely what I said.”
“What,” he finally forced himself to croak out in a voice that sounded nothing like his own, “are you talking about?”
It was like something in him broke – much like his pencil he had picked up absently when he had sat back down, the two pieces cradled tightly in his hand – some long-held
“Yes,” Lucius said.  “Yes.  But this is…”  He ran his hand through his hair, his fingers gliding through the long silky strands with ease.  He took a deep breath and looked once again to Severus.  “Is there nothing you believe that can be done about this?  A strict letter of reprimand…?”
“I can help you with that,” he volunteered, clearly surprising the girl as her green eyes darted from the sorry-looking item in her hands to his face, the emerald orbs widening at his approach.
Potter’s mouth dropped open. “I – uh –” she stammered, a pale pink blush forming on her cheeks.  “I just – uh…” she took a step back, her right hand reaching behind her for the door.  “I heard voices.”  She flicked her eyes toward the ghost hovering nearby then back to him.  “I recognized Myrtle’s and I just wondered –”
Narcissa rose suddenly to her feet again, her spine straight and her chin lifted proudly in the air like the well-bred lady that she was.  “And from that,” she said, “we plan.”
His hand holding hers stilled.  “It’s true.  Since that kiss…” He took another small step closer to her; they were nearly toe to toe now.  “You’re all I think about.”
Draco finished her sentence privately to himself.  A small feeling of glee danced in his belly at that thought, but he pushed it aside to think about later.
But now, as he sat there listening to one of his oldest and most trusted friends speak in an almost casual way about the scene he had encountered between his son and the girl, he had to admit it wasn’t as much of a blindside as he might have thought.
“And Draco is our son,” the blond woman retorted.  She turned to face him more fully, her face determined.  “Aren’t you the one who is always saying family comes first?”
It was as he was sitting there, contemplating the vibrant blue color for which the flower was in part named, that Narcissa with Severus Snape in tow quietly entered the room.
“Diggory then?” he probed, remembering the girl’s date to the Yule Ball in Fourth Year.  “Did you kiss him.”
Not even a full minute later, the girl found herself standing just outside of her destination.  Swiftly checking for any on-lookers and finding none, she carefully and silently opened the bathroom door and slid inside.
When the spellwork was complete, Lucius walked over to a small table and poured three glasses of water, handing two of them to his guests.  “I’m assuming whatever you are about to say is not pleasant news.”
But what were the two doing together?  Hattie flicked her eyes at the tiny lines boxing the two names in and quickly realized they were in a boy’s bathroom a floor below her.  Well, she supposed she’d just have to find out.
Lucius Malfoy reached a hand out and touched the delicate petals of a bluebell flower that sat in a simple vase atop his expansive mahogany desk.  He had brought the flower in from the garden that morning – the things were in bloom all across Wiltshire at that time of the year – and now he used it as a subject of a pencil drawing he had been working quietly on for the past hour in his private study.
And for just a moment again, like in the bathroom when they had kissed, they were just a boy and a girl.  Not a Death Eater.  Not a hero.  Not anything else but two teenagers who saw something in each other that no one else did.
She blushed.  “No.  I just…”  A couple heartbeats of silence passed, then, apparently coming to a decision about something, she straightened her shoulders and held out her hand.  “Would you give me my book please?”
Who was he talking about?  Voldemort?!  Was Voldemort going to kill him?!  That couldn’t be right.  Malfoy was a Pureblood Death Eater-in-training.  Surely if anyone was safe from the Dark Lord’s wrath…
Swiftly dispatching the baby Gryffindors with some well-aimed hexes, he sent a cutting charm at Potter’s school bag and watched with pleasure as all its contents spilled onto the floor by her feet, effectively bringing the young woman to a satisfying and lonely halt.
It wasn’t how he wanted to approach matters – skulking around in the shadows like some kind of Muggle burglar – but he had very few options otherwise, and he
But he wasn’t able to finish just what that was as somewhere off in the distance a clock began to strike the hour.  And with its ominous tolling, the magic of their meeting ended, as Potter suddenly whispered, “Curfew,” the first of the two to realize what the sound signaled, and she swiftly withdrew her hands from his.
His warm breath ghosted gently over her skin sending delightful tingling sensations coursing up and down her body.
“I knew it,” she said, her voice shaky.  “Of course it’s about Draco.  What else could it be to bring you here wishing to speak with both of us?”  She turned a pale face toward the godfather of her son.  “Something terrible has happened, hasn’t it?”
“Can’t be out now,” she muttered.  “Snape will kill me.  He’s been a brute ever since…” her cheeks suddenly flushed as she glanced sheepishly at him before quickly flicking her eyes away.  “Erm…it doesn’t matter.  I just need to go before...”
“Then why,” Severus wrapped his robes around himself and took a step closer to his student, “in all of Wizarding Europe, were you very inappropriately engaging with Miss Hattie Potter just now?”
Finally, in a voice almost practically inaudible, Potter breathed, “Later,” her eyes greener than he had ever seen them, and with a quick little turn of her feet, she was dashing toward the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
Severus Snape listened as loud angry cries suddenly erupted from the boy’s bathroom he happened to be passing by on his way to meet with Professor McGonagall.
She did.  She closed her eyes briefly first, a deep inhale of air clearly filling her lungs – perhaps to steel herself for what she was about to do, and then she directed her famous emerald gaze toward him.
The professor gave the blond woman a kindly look which wasn’t lost on Lucius.  “You really have no idea?”
The girl blinked.  No, it had to be some kind of mistake.  It – the map – had to be wrong.  Or she had to be reading it wrong.  There was just no logical explanation for Draco Malfoy and the resident toilet ghost to be sharing the same space.  It just wasn’t…likely.  She had to be looking at it upside down…
The reflection of Malfoy’s pale blond head and shoulders, bowed and trembling, greeted her in one of the room’s many mirrors; his hands, knuckles white, were gripped tightly to a sink.  The shimmery, ghostly visage of Moaning Myrtle hovered an arm’s length away from the boy.
“No!” Potter said, her forehead creasing in a frown.  “That’s not what I thought.”  She glanced again at Draco.  “I just…it doesn’t matter.”  She turned toward the door.  “I’m just going to –”
His lips were hard and demanding, forceful even, as if he was trying to impress some deep secret into her, which she supposed he was.  And they were hot, like fire, burning a trail of some unknown passion...for her.
For a moment, the girl did nothing, her delicate shoulders rigid and her hand still in place on the door, then, unbelievably, her body seemed to relax despite itself and she pivoted around to face him, all lightly blushing cheeks and slightly trembling limbs and green eyes that were desperately trying to look at everything else in the room but him.
Taking a seat once again behind his desk, the senior Malfoy looked expectantly at his friend.  “Well, let’s get on with it then.  What news do you bring?”
Late one evening two weeks after his encounter with Hattie Potter in the bathroom, Draco stood in a small hidden alcove near the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, patiently waiting for the young woman to return from the library where he had spied her at an hour earlier.
The older wizard swiftly waved his wand and locked the entrance to the bathroom.  “Explain yourself.”
The girl looked everywhere but at him, reminiscent of her behavior in the bathroom that fateful day.  “I don’t think there’s anything we have to talk about.”
Ignoring her request, Draco grabbed her hand and held it, not loose enough she could pull away but not overly tight either so as not to alarm her.  Like a pretty little doe, he knew the witch could frighten easily.
The ghost suddenly broke down into another giant sob and disappeared through a wall before Severus was able to hear the end of her sentence.
Lucius sat back in his chair, absorbing the information with dismay yet unsurprised by it at the same time; Narcissa, however, put a hand over her heart and sat down in the nearest chair, her usual perfect posture showing just the slightest hint of cracking.
Draco let out a low growl.  Sweet Mercury, the girl was so infuriatingly beautiful.  It was something he had long thought – a secret he shared with no one – but it was a fact he couldn’t deny.  He would never admit to anyone how often he wished certain events had turned out differently when he had first met her when he was eleven.  How he wished it had been him and not Weasley who had garnered her friendship…
She breathed in deeply of the light but masculine after shave he wore.  Could she possibly do it?  Could she possibly say his name like they were something more than the enemies they had been for so long?
Having secured the opportunity he had been seeking, Draco slipped from his hiding spot, his eyes raking up and down the raven-haired beauty’s figure as she examined a book that had ink staining its cover.
“Wh-what are you doing here?” the witch said in a trembling voice, a lovely sound that set the Slytherin’s blood racing.  “You – you’re not supposed to be here.”
…with a tiny sigh and a quick glance over his shoulder to make sure no one was watching, she said, “Fine.  But just a minute.”
Suddenly, all the anger and derision and scorn she had been carrying for the boy all year evaporated, and all she was left with was a woefully sad and awkward feeling of…
For a moment there was quiet, complete and total quiet; Narcissa’s hand moving slowly from her heart to her mouth, her blue eyes widening in shock, and Lucius –
“That’s none of your business,” the blond-haired boy spat, his cheeks turning a shade of red any Weasley would be proud of.
Lucius and Narcissa looked at each other.  They had wondered, of course, over the years.  About Draco and his persistent chattering on about Potter.  In fact, Lucius couldn’t recall a time after the boy had started at Hogwarts where he had not talked about the Gryffindor princess at some point.  But they had ignored it, for the most part, or at least Lucius had, chalking it up to some kind of adolescent rivalry or jealousy.
Without deliberating over the matter a second longer, the girl turned her feet immediately in the direction of the nearest staircase.  If Malfoy was up to something – and him hanging about with Moaning Myrtle was definitely something – then she wanted to know what it was.
Lucius glanced at Narcissa to see if she knew what the professor was talking about, but she merely raised her shoulders and shook her head.
Lucius leaned forward, shooting a steely eye at the Potions Master, and suddenly felt himself growing impatient.  “What
The Malfoy patriarch shook his head.  “What could be more complicated than the task he’s already been assigned?”
“I do see you,” she whispered.  And in fact, she had never seen him more clearly.  No cronies standing in the wings; no threats of a father’s revenge; no irritating superior attitude.  Just…him.  A boy with the weight of the world seemingly on his shoulders; a feeling she could commiserate intimately with.
“Pansy only does the polls for you, you know that, right? If we’re all so interested in these polls it’s because you’re our favourite lost cause.”
Draco swallowed drily, wondering when exactly Potter grew so confident and snarky. It wasn’t exactly how they had left when they were nineteen.
“Just order me to do something, fuck. Please.” Malfoy’s voice definitely broke on the word please and he closed his eyes, his hands curling into fists on his thighs.
“I didn’t! I told you, I didn’t want to do it with him!” Harry’s now sitting upright on his bed, head still pulsing. “I-I think it wasn’t him… Can we know who Confunded me, ‘Mione?”
Draco looked at him, not knowing what to say. But when Potter didn’t say anything else, he swallowed and asked, “But?”
Harry hadn’t slept that night. He was sick of Draco’s negativity. They’d be back home, eventually, Harry was sure of it.
With that, she turned on her heels and exited the room, her lime-green robe billowing behind her, wand still flashing.
Malfoy’s free hand fished out a tiny vial from the pocket of his trousers. “I, erm…This is Veritaserum. I took it from the game for… Well, you can use it on me, if you wish. Ask me whatever.”
Fifteen minutes later, they were walking together towards Grimmauld Place, half of Harry’s trunk filled with flasks of potions, feeling relaxed for the first time in days. He was happy to be talking about something that wasn’t his bond and listened to Neville’s stories about his plants without even interrupting him.
Lately some thoughts, some memories, wouldn't leave Draco's mind and when he drank a bit too much they became more and more intrusive.
“If you want to arrive sane at your dinner date with Potter, I’d put down your wine. Let’s order some dessert. Apple pie?”
He delicately sat next to her, brushing his fingers on her cheeks. She opened her eyes, muttering in her drowsiness, “Oh, Draco… Sorry, but I can’t remember the last time I’ve slept without you on a Friday night.”
“The fuck are you doing here?” he asks as if he isn’t the one who’s intruding on you. He’s not wearing a costume, but his lips are black like the thick foliage of the Forest at night.
“Of course. They’re my soulmate; I can tell.” Draco opened his eyes again, just in time to see Potter’s tongue darting out to lick his own lips and then the brim of his glass.
Malfoy looked at Harry and laughed, his cheeks again doing that beautiful thing where dimples appear on both sides of Malfoy's face.
“Pansy, please. You’re here, encouraging me to go and talk with a person I had a terrible relationship with during school, someone I sided against during the War, someone I haven’t seen in five years… and you can’t even sort your things out with Blaise.”
in Harry’s mind too. It was probably because they spent all the time they had together, Harry thought. It had nothing to do with
“No, I’m in. Sounds like fun.” He flashed a smile to Malfoy, who blinked, cheeks still deliciously flushed.
For a moment, it looked like the moon shone brighter because Malfoy’s eyes glossed over and he sank his teeth into his bottom lip.
Astoria turned her head towards Ginny, nodding silently. Ginny went on, “Good, because… this is a secret I have never had the strength to reveal to anyone, but. I guess it’s the right time to… well, Harry and I, oh fuck. We were a disaster. We always had fights and arguments, and after Lily’s birth... we never, you know. We never had…”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened them again, he was standing in the middle of a desolate and burned valley. He was also naked and screeching. Wrapped in his wings was Draco Malfoy, who was bleeding from his nose and lips and breathing hard, his face positively
Malfoy leaned to his ear and went on, “And then that’s when I realised. What better gift to give you… than me.”
“Of course. The great Harry Potter is also a certified Animagus. What do you transform into? A majestic lion?”
“Jesus Christ.” Harry dropped his head against the wall again, biting his lips so hard they bled. “Again. Say it again.”
The big cherry wood doors at the entrance were open, letting a sweet breeze come in, the smell of lilies and jasmines from the garden lightly lingering in the air. For the occasion, every single room in the Manor had been cleaned up, polished, and adorned.
at me, instead of talking to me, why you fucking went away even after I offered my help at the infirmary, why you—”
“Draco…” Harry’s worried voice slowly became clearer until Draco opened his eyes to see Harry crouched next to him, softly caressing his hair.
They started to see each other every day — “As if you weren’t coming here every day anyway” “Hey, it wasn’t for me, Lady Luck needed your assistance” — taking the time to rediscover each other, their new lives, what changed in them, what remained the same.
Then, once, something happened — Harry woke up and Draco was… having a sex dream. Harry was sure of it. Draco’s cock was hard and straining against Harry’s arse, and his breathing was quickened, soft groans escaping his parted lips. Harry turned to look at him and the sight stole his breath. The idea that Draco was turned on and aroused while not fully conscious rubbed something into Harry, a primitive instinct, animalistic. He watched mesmerised, cock achingly hard in his briefs, as Draco writhed and moaned in his sleep until he stilled and his breath caught on a single word. “Harry.”
“Sure, why not.” Harry looked amazed while Draco took his wand and muttered a spell he never heard before. With his wand still sparkling golden, he asked Harry, “I need you to tell anything, anything at all. It’s just to impress your voice with the magic in the paint of the walls.”
“Well, open it, will you?” He throws the gift your way. You take it, bewildered. When you open it, you exhale in relief.
In the meantime, Mr Serkin was proceeding with selling the first object: a rare antique book about spells and rituals no longer used in the Wizarding World. Its value was solely historical; it was the only copy left in existence in the world. Draco risked a peek to the Golden Trio: could Granger be interested in it?
That night before going to sleep, there was a question in Malfoy’s eyes, in the way he lingered briefly in the corridor.
Their entrees arrived and Harry allowed himself a second of distraction to enjoy the delectable scent coming from his spaghetti.
It saddened Harry an insurmountable amount. Not for Malfoy; this was good for him. But for himself. For how little he knew about what
Malfoy tightened his hand around Harry’s wrist in response, and raised his head, his eyes serious. He cast a wandless and wordless spell, black silk laces appearing at Harry’s wrists, bringing them together and clasping them to the headboard of the bed.
You should be running out of this situation, this mess. Potter clearly has got something going on: he’s drunk, alone in a Muggle pub. You should get out. But you can’t. You never can, with him.
He shook his head to clear his mind and tried again. “So—” He had to stop since his voice came out high-pitched as if he’d just swallowed a whistle. Panicking, he looked through the crowd again: everyone was too focussed on Potter’s arrival to mind him any attention — only Pansy’s face was buried into an ill-suppressed giggle.
He stopped his already slow pace, looking around while Pansy descended the last step and ran toward a marching group of catering people.
"Why not a coffee together? You know, I was thinking some things about this time travelling, I'd like to discuss them."
Potter squirms, moans, lifts a leg to put it behind your back. The invitation is clear. You let go of his cock, lick around your fingers, spit on them, and waste no time before swallowing his length again.
“Head Auror Potter, so serious, look at you now.” Malfoy jerked his head up, looking into Harry’s face. The feather slowed to almost stilling.
“I—” Harry couldn’t even talk. Malfoy always reduced him to that incoherent mess, only able to beg and arch to take more and more and
With the little sanity that was left in Harry’s brain, he lubed his hand with the same spell Draco used, then slicked his cock, teasing himself with slow tugs, praying he’d last more than five seconds. All these new feelings of skin on skin were already inebriating Harry and he looked up at Draco, his beautiful Draco, drinking him in, with his curls finally falling around his face, little drops of perspiration on his skin.
The waiter arrived a few seconds later, letting out a soft snort as he poured them two glasses of their favourite wine. “Upset today, Draco?”
Draco raised his eyebrows as if to say that he never freaked out. Pansy rolled her eyes and went on.
He ran without apparent direction until his lungs hurt and he had to stop, bending at his waist, legs apart, hands on his knees. Closing his eyes, he tried to control his breathing again — inhale through his nostrils, hold three seconds, exhale through slightly parted lips. That’s what his therapist taught him.
The implications of what happened were heavy, settling into Harry’s soul like a soft caress. This couldn’t be just a coincidence, they were meant to do this time travel; in some way, what they were doing now had already happened, had already been part of their lives. And Draco… of everything Harry discovered about him, knowing he believed in soulmates was the most shocking thing.
With a snort, Potter finally took Draco in his mouth again. He worked his throat around Draco’s cock, bobbing his head up and down.
Draco looked at Harry, internally begging him to say something, anything to avoid him opening his mouth instead. He wasn’t sure words would come out. Harry smiled at Astoria and turned his head towards Ginevra. “He is. We have something to tell you, girls.”
“I think my time has come.” Draco got up, amazed at his ability to stand up without falling or swaying. Pansy followed, muttering something that sounded like, “You really can’t hold your liquor, Draco.”
"I… was at a bar with Ron and 'Mione. I felt very sick, I thought it was a hangover… then I think I passed out?"
Potter’s hands roamed lower still, tracing over the waistband of Draco’s joggers as Draco’s muscles quivered under Potter’s touch.
Potter pouted and batted his long eyelashes, something Draco really had never been good at resisting. He rolled his eyes and mumbled, “Well, I guess you could if—”
All the air leaves your lungs as you bend over. He pushes you back until you hit the wall. He’s fisting your shirt and, this up close, you can see there are tears in Potter’s eyes too.
They shared a half-smile in silence. Taking a deep breath, Draco snorted, his eyes searching for Potter in the room. Finding him at a stall with Bill and Fleur, more gorgeous than ever. “You know what,” he brought his eyes back to Pansy, “I’ll go talk to him right now. And you’ll go talk to Blaise.”
“It’s complicated. We don’t know much about the spell yet,” Ron said, scrunching up his nose in an apologetic gesture. “I need to leave now. Malfoy can fill you in on the rest. I wanted to be here to tell you we’ll work on this as hard as we can.” Ron stood up, patted Harry’s shoulder and reached the fireplace. “See you soon.”
After a tense silence, Harry relaxed against his seat, took courage to say the last part: “I don’t— there’s no need for us to…
Harry looked to his left, where Boo-boo was floating weirdly silent at his side, his cheeks looking extremely more corporeal than usual… wait, was he blushing?
As soon as they stepped foot inside, all his willpower crumbled once more. Draco grabbed Harry’s arm again, making him stumble backwards. “I can’t. Let’s run away. You and me; we’ll build our lives together somewhere else, somewhere far away. Please, say yes.”
This time Malfoy positively snarled at Harry, showing his teeth and all, but his body didn’t move an inch.
Harry snorted, startling Malfoy who looked up into his face. “You’re a berk,” Harry said. And then, “Tell me to lie to you.”
“Not, not really…” Ron stammered. “Fuck. I— wait, why did you think that? Am I that obvious? Damn, I wanted to talk to Hermione before... well, and then I don’t know if Pansy, you know...”
Now, Harry's entire face heated up, while he heard Hermione snorting behind them and Ron whispering something that sounded too much like 'busted'.
“Wow.” Potter took a deep breath, taking a few steps towards Draco, his steps crackling on the grass. “That’s… a lot. I don’t know why I did those things, honestly. I guess… you’re part of my life? What I mean is that we’ve known each other for so long and we’ve always fought, had arguments, even physically attacked each other, but here’s the point: you were there. You contributed to form what I am today, for better or worse. So, I can’t help but wonder and ask myself, what’s Malfoy plotting? Why is he hiding? If only with a competitive spirit, you know? I-It’s stupid, forget it…”
Draco didn’t even have time to respond. But Pansy was right. A night out at the pub would be a welcome distraction.
Draco licked his lips and his cock jolted, hard once again. “This night is a disaster! Destiny made us meet again, but then look at this — in the ocean I was
Draco answered from the floor, barely keeping his happiness out of his voice. “I know, I’m sorry, Harry. I just… forgot some things I used to do as a kid, you know? You grow up and leave some stuff behind.” He turned and started touching the walls, his hands quickly roaming on the wood, searching behind the drawings.
Ron patted him on the shoulder, murmuring he had no idea either, and they all forgot about the dildo, moving on to different topics and starting to eat. Throughout the lunch, Harry would occasionally put his hand on Draco’s thigh, caressing it, moving up towards his groin, resting his hand on Draco’s crotch.
“We may as well talk about our sexual preferences. I’m starting to— ah, well, I’m getting off on your orders now and I think it would be safer if we knew…”
Draco glared, before remembering Pansy’s warning. “Um, it’s nothing, really. Nothing that your great food and wine can’t solve, I mean.” Draco flashed him a smile, and the waiter smiled back, retreating from their table afterward.
Sighing, Harry went to the bathroom to pull himself together. A warm shower had always helped him clear his head and he took advantage of that to think about how to tell his children the news. When he got out of the shower, he still had no idea how to behave.
Ron raised an eyebrow and smirked. “I know Harry better than you and he doesn’t like big gestures for his birthday.”
? Sure, he was training as an Auror, but he was too evil to look so hot. He even wore leather trousers, see-through shirts, and glitter on his eyes sometimes.
“No, you don’t understand! He slept at my place, cooked breakfast for me, nearly kissed me, asked me out for dinner — dinner, Pansy! — and then left without a shag, or a blowjob… nothing!”
Merlin, Harry had said yes. They were going to marry, for real. Draco felt dizzy and launched himself on Harry, kissing him, hugging him, keeping him close, making sure he was real.
Why he remained silent every time Harry would kiss him on the cheek to wish him a goodnight, making Draco’s mind go in every kind of direction.
That was exactly the one question Harry didn’t want to answer. It was also the reason he sought Hermione’s help.
Harry was staring in horror at this strange version of Draco Malfoy. He knew he had changed since the War, he’d seen him earlier that week at the restoration of Hogwarts and he’d received his letter of apology, but surely this was a step too far.
Malfoy entered some time later, interrupting Harry’s stream of conscience. “I didn’t know what you like most in the morning— or, well, if I had to go with our Hogwarts years, I’d prepare treacle tarts and pumpkin juice but there wasn’t time, so…”
“No feckin' way,” Seamus pointed at Harry clumsily, the alcohol making his Irish accent even worse. “You’ve chosen dares the whole night! It’s time for you to choose truth!”
Ginny went to get some for herself and came back, laying down on the hammock next to Astoria. She took a deep breath. “Listen, Tori. This thing sucks, but… can I be honest with you?”
“The Boy Who Flew Naked Incident,” everyone had called it. It was still Ginny’s favourite story, and she told it to every person Harry tried to date after they broke up for the sixth (seventh?) time.
They laughed, Harry finally relaxing into Draco’s embrace. He brought his face to Draco’s, his lips brushing the shell of Draco’s ear. With a purr that made goosebumps pop over Draco’s skin, he said, “Now, what if I really could give it all to you? Food, sex and love?”
Harry slipped out of him, wanting to carry on the game just a little more. He brushed Draco’s arsecheeks, massaged his back. Murmuring under his breath he cleaned them up and dressed Draco, only wearing pants for himself.
“Fuck!” Draco cried out, fisting the blankets. He could already feel his hole fluttering under Harry’s tongue as Harry’s fingers spread Draco’s arse cheeks.
Bending over, you take the fabric in your teeth and slowly roll it down Potter’s thighs. He moans, pushes his dick in your face.
“Wake up, Harry!” Ginny’s voice pierced through Harry’s ears, making him open one eye to look at her. He felt pain in every muscle of his body.
When he’s buried deep inside Malfoy again, the moonlight creeps inside his bedroom and Harry takes a deep breath, thrusts in even deeper, more and more, to the chant of Malfoy’s rough voice begging to fill him, to fill him whole.
Once outside, Draco glanced up at the sky, now a deep blue punctuated with bright stars. He turned to find Harry again staring right back at him. He showed a half-smile and whispered, “Where are we going?” when—
late, demonstrating once again how poor-mannered he was! And, and… Oh, Merlin’s tits, in what state!?
Harry itched to take him into his arms and wrap him in a tight hug, his chest feeling tight all of a sudden. His eyes watered and his voice broke when he spoke.
Between what they heard of Jacob's words and Boo-boo descriptions, they narrowed down what happened. Jacob pronounced the last part of the ritual, the one that would have sealed the bond, the wrong way and crashed to the floor.
Malfoy’s head snapped to him, eyes wide. “You’re kidding, right? Do you want to end up like Weasley begging Fleur to go with him at the Yule Ball? And yes, I was there when it happened. It was pathetic.”
They spun on their heels, hands flying to their wands secured on their thighs, but all they could see was a floating little ghost, who couldn’t more than nine or ten years old.
should have left only three dots on your skin: one on your heart, one on your head and well, one on your penis. Um." Her cheeks tinged a light red before her usual professionalism took over again.
She hung up, leaning towards Harry as if to hug him, stopping short just in time before touching him.
There had been times when Harry had hissed Parseltongue naughties to Draco’s ear till he came completely untouched, only asking Harry to ‘please, keep on, keep on,
Ron nodded and Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek. “See you tomorrow.” She eyed him meaningfully and went to hug Draco too, “Happy birthday then!” making him snort and think that maybe, just maybe, she wasn’t all that bad.
,” Ron gritted out. He took a deep breath, briefly closed his eyes. “Yes, Harry,” he said, more controlled. “You’re the only one we can trust with this. Too many people still don’t like Draco and would take advantage of the situation.”
“Stay still,” he said, and then he started blowing air on Harry’s groin, the tip of his cock, his balls. He dragged the tip of his tongue where the inner part of Harry’s thigh met his groin at the same time as the feather started flicking over Harry’s stomach.
“You never told me, Geremia! We worked on this for so many years! What did you do?!” She sounded desperate and Harry realised only that moment what that could mean for Hermione. He ran to her, catching her between his arms before she could fall to the floor, Draco now pointing his wand at Geremia.
Fuck, Malfoy was absolutely irreverent and snarky and funny and Harry couldn't get enough of him. The bond
Draco shook his head, the room spinning around him again. “No! I order the pizza and you go to the bathroom—”
Draco exchanged an amused glance with one of the waiters, trying to fight a smile. “Well, honestly, no. But this fucking Manor is so big that I wouldn’t be surprised if they find a dragon in the basements.”
You’re writhing on that sofa, pitiful pleas escaping you, but you don’t care. “Please, please, please, please,” you chant, desperate. “Make me come, please.”
They just continued a relationship that felt inevitable by then, with Draco’s stomach fluttering every time Harry would be close to him, and his lips quirking up every time Harry brought coffee to him during a lesson or lingered that moment longer in a stolen hug in the corridors.
Draco looked into his eyes and they smiled, their cheeks flushed. He pushed back and rolled next to Harry — the night was finally quiet, their panting slowly evening out.
Hermione burst out laughing, shaking her head, tears already stuck in her eyelashes. “Finally admitting your one and only true love, Harry?”
Draco couldn’t believe his ears. What the fuck? His throat dried, but he tried anyway, “I don’t…” The portrait kept on:
Ten months in, Harry and Draco had adopted Boo-boo. Not literally, but the feeling of familial affection came naturally.
“I see,” an amused voice said softly, making Draco’s head snap up. His cheeks tingled with warmth once he recognised the timbre.
“Ugh.” Harry scrunched up his face, snorting a little. “I think— I think my Veela wants to protect you. I’ve felt like this for a while now.”
Draco held up his chin and led their way to the dance floor, wrapping his arms around Potter’s waist, pulling him closer, fed up with trying to control something that was clearly out of his hands. Potter was only mildly surprised, almost instantly bringing his arms around Draco’s neck, laying his hands at the nape of it.
He leaned in to kiss Harry again, slower this time, wriggling his hips, his hole pulsing around Harry’s cock. Draco buried his hands in Harry’s hair, tugging lightly, bringing his mouth to Harry’s ear, sucking on it, “I’ll ride the fuck out of you, love, my love. I’ll ride you until you lose your mind, my love, you are mine.”
The catering people had hung signs on every wall indicating the way, but people seemed to prefer the idea of going and approaching Draco, taking the chance to ask him a few questions — was he feeling well? why had he remained isolated in the manor all those years? was he scared for the outcome of the night?
Involuntarily, Draco smiled, thinking of how naïve Potter could be. Florence had a similar smile on her face when she replied. “Harry, I had the immense privilege and bad luck to be born into a pure-blood family. Rules were even stricter during my times and I was forced into a loveless heterosexual marriage. We never had children, nor touched each other, it was only for appearance, you see? I was the shame of the family, being lesbian and oh-so-liberal. I only hope Draco here won’t repeat my same mistakes.”
Draco sighed, his face heating. Thinking about the memory had sent his body into a spiral of arousal, and—
Draco couldn’t do anything to prevent the violent shudder that ran through his body upon hearing Potter’s words, or the blood that rushed to his cock, thickening it even more.
Draco looked behind himself, seeing the albino peacocks padding through the gardens, close to them. He returned his gaze to Harry, amused. “They are albino peacocks and yes, they usually sleep at this time, but I guess the noise is keeping them awake tonight. They aren’t used to life here anymore.”
Draco settled back on his heels, huffing loudly. “I’d never come again anyway, at least not so quickly.” He looked down at Potter’s stretched form, the way his eyes were almost closed, his mouth swollen and relaxed in a half-smile. Draco bit down hard on his bottom lip, forcing himself not to lay down next to Potter. Definitely not to lay down and spoon him, wrapping an arm around Potter’s waist and pulling him close.
Potter’s messy hair was the first thing Draco saw, fanning out over one of Draco’s pyjama t-shirts. Draco’s eyes travelled lower, stopping at Potter’s round arse cheeks, hugged in too-tight-to-be-comfortable pants, not able to resist ogling Potter’s lean thighs, the hairs on his legs looking unfairly soft.
“I’m all right, love,” Harry said, and suddenly he was hugging Draco closer, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck. “Glad to be home.”
Harry stood up too, grabbing his own popcorn and shoving Draco's shoulder lightly. "You want to go only because I beat the fuck out of you down there!"
And there it was. The moment Draco was waiting for the entire night. That little detail he had come to know about Potter and couldn’t help but chase every time they were in each other’s presence.
Ron mimicked gagging and rolled his eyes. “You’re all so disgustingly sappy. Why Paris, then? It’s just a city like—”
Harry looked at him with wide eyes, thinking of all the possible replies he could give Draco without getting him mad. In the end, he went with, “I’m… sorry?”
So… no random blokes, no exciting new projects at work, no striking discoveries in the potions field, no gossip, and no trips to Sweet Prophecies in the long week of Potter’s absence.
Draco snorted when the sudden noise of a couple of hesitant feet dragging inside the lab made Draco's eyes roll up. The sign clearly said "closed" and—
“What’s your problem with food, Pottah? You are always eatin’...” Malfoy slurred, his lips purple from the wine. Harry felt a strong impulse to lick it off them.
“I bet Bill and Fleur will look marvellous, they are always so sophisticated, don’t you think Draco?”
“You’re such a good boy, sweetheart, you know? Good good good boy. I’ll treat you so well, I’ll be patient, pet, you’ll love it, you’ll beg for more.”
it,” Harry whispered. He sucked in a breath, before thousands of questions formed in his mind. He needed to play his cards well.
Little do they know that by the end of the school year, Harry will be walking back to his dormitory dreading the moment he’ll have to reveal his friends he lost his virginity to a Slytherin.
Draco sighed. “Of course it wasn’t, Harry. But… to change my Patronus so that it didn’t show my real feelings? That wasn’t a happy thing.” He huffed sadly, shaking his head. “Why? Why didn’t you tell me, Harry? I would have… I would have dropped everything for you.”
Malfoy's office was on a street of beautiful green and cream apartments. Right in front of number 7, Harry snorted at the big wooden doors so similar to the ones at Malfoy Manor, but his smile faltered when his eyes fell to the golden plaque reading,
Malfoy huffed, motioning for Harry to give him the dishes. Harry did and watched as Malfoy scooped up perfect ratatouille and positioned it in a neat order onto the plates.
It never rained in Bacalar. Since Draco had arrived, the sun hadn’t stopped shining. But he would quickly learn nothing stays the same forever.
Harry shook his head — right, the t-shirt. He threw it off somewhere by his side, and didn't take off his pants, knowing it was one of Malfoy’s favourite parts.
“That you WHAT, exactly, Harry?! Finish that, now! That you WHAT!” Ginevra was yelling now, and she raised from her seat, bumping a fist on the table. All the people in the restaurant turned their heads towards them.
"Boo-boo, if you're basing your maturity on how much time you’ve spent with us, then you're doomed."
Harry winked, the cocky bastard, squeezing Draco’s hand. Draco smiled when a thought occurred to him.
“I saw the way you were looking at that dildo…” Harry unfastened Draco’s trousers, tracing with his fingers the shape of Draco’s cock over his pants.
you to strip down,” Harry said, feeling bold— more so when Malfoy’s face reddened up and his lips parted in a shocked ‘o’. He toed his shoes off and Harry added, “I’m kidding, of course. It’s just weird to keep your shoes on, since we’re going to be confined in here for who knows how long.”
Not that Draco wasn’t used to ocean water by now, but he was surprised to think for the first time that it was a really good smell. Damn.
“Well… let’s see if Teddy likes what I bought him.” He unwrapped the package, revealing a big stuffed horse doll enchanted to gallop an overexcited Teddy around the house.
It was enormous. It didn’t even have the shape of a cock. It resembled more a tentacle with pads on its length. The tip was smaller, almost a decent size, but every 3 centimetres it grew wider more and more, until the diameter was obscene. The colouring was disturbing too; it was all green with red stripes that looked like flames.
And then there was the matter of the identity of the chef of Sweet Prophecies Remembering the clue Pansy handed him, Draco searched for a solid quarter-hour, in the pockets of his trousers, of his cloak, under the couch, inside his shoe; finally remembering and fishing it out of his blazer.
“Malfoy?” Harry called. His head felt weirdly light, his shoulders relaxed as if… Harry looked around himself again when Malfoy’s angry shout reached him.
He was late, he always was. He entered Andromeda’s running, barely closing the door behind himself and sprinting towards Teddy’s room. He almost missed her “Hi, Harry!” in his haste to reach Teddy… and Malfoy. He needed to be certain he met the real Malfoy the last time and not just a faker but kinder… well, also, more handsome, version of him. The whole thing stank to Harry.
Harry tried to answer him kindly but after a couple of hours together, finally asked Boo-boo to leave him alone. He needed time to himself. He wandered through the city, that Muggle London he now knew like his own pockets. It was a cloudy day, the smell of rain heavy in the air.
The finger on Harry’s hole slipped in, wet, til the first knuckle and then out again. Malfoy sucked on Harry’s cock, swirling his tongue on the shaft as the finger thrust back in, until it was completely buried in Harry’s arse.
A pillow flew into his face as Potter’s laughter — delightful, full, warm laughter— filled the room.
As soon as Malfoy was close enough, Harry put his hands on him, grasping his hips and nuzzling his groin, inhaling deeply. “Christ, you smell good,” he gasped, running his tongue on the outline of Malfoy’s cock.
When the waitress walked away, Harry felt Malfoy's eyes burn a hole in his face and then Boo-boo asked the worst possible thing.
He smiled beatifically at Bob when he put the cake in front of them and couldn’t stop salivating at the sight. Draco inhaled deeply, getting lost in the sweet aroma of his cake, almost forgetting he wasn’t alone. When Ron spoke, he jumped slightly but was happy to see Ron was similarly caught up in his own thoughts to pay Draco any attention.
“Alright, here’s what we’ll do—” Harry started, then stopped, shook his head. “If we’re stuck in this, we need to make sure you, err, can feel the most comfortable possible.”
“I’m assessing the situation. It’s a mess. It’s a fucking mess.” Harry scratched behind his neck as Malfoy kept looking at him with a ‘so what’ face.
Almost, because even though there are signs —you always spend the night there, Potter’s closets are now full of your clothes, you have breakfast together almost every morning— you can’t admit it.
, yes, don’t you dare stop,” Draco whispered. He felt his strength give way as his knees buckled under the power of the orgasm that ripped out of him in waves and waves of come down Potter’s throat. Potter’s tongue was firmly pressed against Draco’s foreskin, making sure not a single drop leaked out.
His head was throbbing, and he could feel an annoying itch throughout his entire body, probably due to being tied up for who knows how long and… doing who knows what.
Malfoy nodded. “Thanks, Harry. And now, on to different topics. I’ve talked with Alicia and she told me your conditions are regular now and that you’re set to go home this afternoon.”
Damn it. But Draco had become incredibly good at reading Harry and giving him exactly what he needed, what he craved.
Harry smiled, leaning into Draco’s touch until the sparks going down his spine became too strong to bear. He stepped back and glanced at Boo-boo. He was smiling but his eyes looked almost as if they were watering with tears.
Apparently, that didn’t work well for the only male heir of the Malfoy dynasty. Two wars later and several years in Azkaban can change a man, however, and now Lucius wasn’t too fussed by whom Draco slept with.
Harry joined them walking further into the forest, until Malfoy stopped and cast several cushioning and warming charms at a tree. He sat, leaning his head back on the trunk and exposing his long throat, lit up by the orange light of dawn.
With his cock still hard in his pants, Draco made a cup of hot tea and went to lay on his hammock in the veranda of his cabin. Even if it was evening, the sky was still bright and clear, and a light breeze gently dishevelled Draco’s hair, soothing his nerves.
He tried to date again after Astoria’s death, but they always ended with a blow job, rarely a fuck, and too often a bittersweet nostalgia. Even sex as an adult didn't look as great as sex with Potter had been, back then, when the thrill of trying not to be discovered had spiked up their encounters, desks and dark alcoves their uncomfortable stages of love.
— that got them a raised eyebrow from their wives, Draco and Harry could finally Disapparate back home. After everything that happened, Ginevra and Astoria were still living at the beach house to take some time for themselves and Draco and Harry would stay at Harry’s place during the weekends.
Draco snorted, finally sitting. His hands reached for the menu even though it was only a habit. He already knew it by heart.
For the rest of the game, nothing else existed for Harry except his tight chest, his ragged breathing, and Malfoy’s stormy eyes.
“May I ask what the hell you’re saying?” Harry’s tone was light and playful and Draco let himself relax again, staring distractedly at the few raindrops trailing down Harry’s chest, entangling in his hairs, gathering on his nipple.
His step-aunt snorted, shaking her head lightly. “Don’t you think he looks cute with this platinum blond?”
Talking felt incredibly hard and his voice resounded in an unpleasant way when his head hurt like this. He hoped Potter wouldn’t notice.
exactly Malfoy had felt like this. Harry certainly hadn’t noticed. Malfoy had been so self-possessed, even when Harry had started to get annoyed and directly grasped Malfoy’s hard-on under the table.
You study him carefully, nod, brush your fingers on the satin lingerie panties he’s wearing. They’re light orange, and you can see the dark tip of his cock through the lace.
“Right! The ball! I have to go, sorry. See you inside, Potter.” Draco dragged Pansy out of Potter’s reach, walking quickly, only glancing backwards once and catching Potter picking the flowers out of his hair one after the other with a half-smile on his face.
The morning after, they went to their usual pub to have breakfast together, Harry ordered Draco’s hot tea with two teaspoons of cold milk and one of sugar, and a cappuccino for himself. Boo-boo entered with them, curiously eyeing the other customers.
Just as Harry felt his balls tighten and the room spin around him, Malfoy pinched his arm, taking him out of his lust, and growled breathless, “You know, Potter—”
That’s how you find yourself wandering outside The Lewd Legs— a Muggle stripper club, open on Christmas Eve. How shabby. But you don’t have any more dignity. You don’t care. You go back there, even if you haven’t fucked anyone else but Potter in the last five months.
“Right! It doesn’t matter because it’s you and me and what’s more important than that? It’s you and me, together and this is exactly what I’d want for us for the rest of our lives. Me, you, together, forever.”
“W-when you’re in a relationship and you don’t say straightaway what you want, and especially what you don’t like, because you don’t want to disappoint the other person?”
He quickly stood up, taking Lady Luck with him. "Make sure to take something for your headache! I’d better go now. Have a good night!"
It makes Harry’s skin prickle. How easy it is for Malfoy to look so put together and how easy it is for Harry to always look debauched, just fucked, messy and scrawny.
Harry hurried to uncover himself, hoping he wasn't blushing too much, and trying to discreetly hide his bulge.
Harry was still convinced Hermione and Geremia would find a solution, still wrote on ‘The Mighty Lions’ chat from time to time. Draco thought he was delusional; they were destined to be blocked forever.
“But I have to,” she replied, calmly. She put a finger under Draco’s chin and raised his head, making them lock eyes. She smiled, soft and sweet. “It’s been more than a year, Draco. Potter already knows everything about you.
Once back to their room at the Leaky, Harry sat heavily on the bed, taking off his shoes while Draco went to shower.
"Shall I…" Draco took the box from the centre of the petals and sat down on the bed, slowly pulling the bow that wrapped it, a little smirk playing on his lips.
’d Pansy’s magazine. He was halfway through it, still dutifully avoiding the poll —someone should really compliment him for his self-control— when he came upon a paparazzo’s picture of Potter entering a library. The caption read: “Will Harry Potter’s book ever see the light of day?”
Harry pointed at his overstuffed trunk on the bed next to him when Malfoy went on. “Right. Once back home, for everything regarding your medical conditions, you’ll keep in touch with Alicia and her team here at St. Mungo’s; while I’ll only take care of your bonding situation. I have some ideas to start working on, so meet me in my office tomorrow morning at 9 am?”
She interrupted him, her voice a bit firmer now. “You loved me! Then what happened! When did you discover… you’re… gay?!”
Of course, that’s why his back and arse were hurting so badly. But all in all, Harry knew he had never experienced a pleasure so intense before.
Draco’s throat felt suddenly dry. He tried to inhale, but the air passing through felt like sand grazing his throat. He risked a peek at Astoria: her eyes were already shiny, and her fingers curled in tight fists on the table.
Draco brought a hand to his mouth, tracing his upper lip with his finger. It sent sparks down his spine it was so sensitive.
Harry tried to take a breath but almost choked on it, Malfoy’s weight still pushed against him. His cock gave a jolt at the feeling, his voice already panting. “M-Malfoy, I can’t—”
Malfoy’s eyes were a liquid silver. “I think,” he started, his voice trembling. He cleared his throat. “I think I can be lured into the life of a kept man.” He smiled, honest and open for the first time. “Regular sex, food, and attention…”
“Because after the War, I lost everything! Not only my parents, my soul, but my magic as well. I’ve been living like a squib for the last five years; I don’t remember how it feels to even conjure a glass of water, nothing! My magic completely left me! That’s ironic, isn’t it? An evil Death Eater, a dangerous boy,
“So generous,” he said, voice rough. It made Harry’s half-hard prick stiffen some more. “‘Shut up’ seems to be your favourite order to give me.”
Harry shivered — lately everyone had been so scared to hurt him that no one had come closer to him than two feet away and unexpectedly feeling someone else's body heat and breathing ghost over his ear made him whimper. Even more so, when that someone was an incredibly good-smelling, attractive blond ex-rival turned righteous all of a sudden.
They started the so-called Eighth Year at Hogwarts, and they’re all in their old houses, their old dorms, their usual roommates. Dean, Neville and Seamus have an ongoing bet with Ron about Harry’s virginity—Dean and Seamus think Harry won’t be able to separate feelings from sex and will end up waiting for the ‘
“May I?” Ginny chirps, softly padding into the room, then sitting onto Dean’s bed. “What are we talking about?”
Harry’s mouth hung stupidly. The sight was more than he could bear. Malfoy, on his knees, at Harry’s feet,
. It was almost time to wake up and Harry was restless, thinking about everything that could go wrong.
Then Draco whimpered and snuggled closer to Harry, searching for him in his sleep. And Harry couldn’t resist anymore. He slid off Draco’s pyjama bottoms and underwear carefully, slowly, just enough to make his cock fall out. It was still soft and Harry’s breath hitched — before he could change his mind again, he ducked his head under the blankets, brushing a small kiss to Draco’s soft cock.
Harry huffed as his supposed best friends kept laughing and sending silly messages on their chat. Why couldn’t he learn to just shut his mouth?
The news of your and Astoria’s incoming wedding is everywhere: every newspaper sports titles like, “Death Eater Draco Malfoy Reforms?” You want to scream, to run away, to curl in a corner and cry your soul out.
“We have to come up with good questions if we want to know the name of his gay fling.” Hermione rose from her seat and moved next to Seamus, Ron following her and Harry watched, impotent, as they started whispering, writing down notes, deciding what to ask him next.
was sleeping — gave him nausea, so he sighed and slumped on the couch, deciding it would be perfectly okay to sleep there for a night.
“It’s not surprising, I’ve worn them the last three weeks to make them slacker for you!” Tori was smoothing Draco’s suit, checking that everything was in place, perfect. She adjusted a rebel strand of hair, tucking it under Draco’s crown.
Ron took a bite of the cake, raising an eyebrow, disbelief overtaking his face. “This is actually pretty good,” he mumbled. He looked at Draco then, something too similar to amusement in his eyes.
It was a week before Draco saw Potter again. He knew he hadn’t behaved particularly well— after the last time, Draco never reached out to him and Potter hadn’t written anything either. Technically, there wasn’t anything wrong with that. They weren’t
“Did he tell you something about Harry?” As soon as he registered the way Harry’s name rolled off his tongue so spontaneously, he felt his cheeks growing warm along with his stomach.
“Chéri, I can see your concerned face. Don’t strain yourself for a good excuse to go to the loo, just go.
"Oh, I'm sorry darling, it comes so natural for me to hug you. I was on the mobile with Ron, he forgot he can't go pick up the kids from school today, can you believe him?"
She nodded, a little smile pulling at her lips. “Thanks, Harry. I can’t face this right now.” Harry nodded back; he was still trying to understand how the fuck would he behave differently to convey straightness. He was preparing the table when a loud bang made him drop a dish that shattered on the floor.
“Our safe word for sex!” the bastard exclaimed, drawing a scandalised —and, at the same time, horrified— cry from Ron.
Harry pulled out slowly and slammed in stronger, feeling his orgasm arise hard in his balls. He wanted to make sure Draco would come in his sleep too, like that first time, when Harry was woken up by Draco having a sex dream.
Pansy flushed, clearing her throat. “Still no clue. It’s fun because I swear I receive messages and guesses from all of London, every day. It’s become a bit like a national hunt, and I absolutely can’t understand how someone can hide so well.”
“Oh, you’re gonna like it.” Bill winked at Draco, while Fleur snorted lightly into her glass of punch, trying — without success — to muffle her chuckling.
"Today I saw Malfoy in Diagon Alley. He didn't even stop to say hi. What does he think, he's better than me? Always the same spoiled brat."
Draco had placed the vial on the table and stood up, reaching for him, talking directly into his ear.
As it turns out, that wasn’t the last time. Nor was the time after that, or the one after that, and—
You hadn’t realised how much you were used to Potter until he disappeared, right after the first time the
“You haven’t changed, have you, Potter?” Draco asked, searching inside of himself for the courage to ask Potter out. Just as friends, of course.
Harry stood up, reaching him, he took Draco’s hand and smoothed where he was torturing his arm. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it. I’m just nervous… I, of course, I am happy we came out. Just… maybe avoid the pink banner?”
“C’mon, Harry, take out the Cloak.” Malfoy nodded his head towards the entrance of the cottage, where Jacob and the other man were entering with a concerted effort.
A small crowd of the people they most loved was waiting for Draco, Harry standing gorgeous at the centre of it, a flower crown in his hair: narcissus and lilies. They took an eternity to decide which flower to use for their crowns but in the end, there were no doubts. Not only did they symbolise their mothers, but they made a perfect contrast one next to the other: white and yellow; while brightening Draco and Harry’s faces, they highlighted, even more, the joy radiating from them.
“You’re a straightforward person, I appreciate that in you.” Malfoy smiled. It looked so sincere, so bright, it made Harry’s chest ache. “But not everyone... look, people don’t always act according to their feelings, do they?”
His hands are now in your hair— he can untie those cords whenever he wants to, the bastard. Just like he’s always been able to untie your life, your heart, your soul, too.
Potter’s betrayed look hurt more than it had any right to. Draco just stared at him, his mind a blank page. How could he tell him it was his magic going wild, because apparently, he was having a gay crisis over his school nemesis?
“Oh really, like what? Like how he’d always supported Pureblood supremacy without being an actual pureblood?” Harry wasn’t sure if Hermione was more annoyed or angry— either way, her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were gleaming, like when she’d caught Rita Skeeter and finally had the occasion to punish her.
“So how long will this last?” Harry asked Malfoy’s back as he stirred something that smelled delicious.
What the fuck was happening? Was Potter trying to make a show of himself and scare everyone away? Was this his way to get revenge against Draco? First the portrait, now this. If it wasn’t a plot, then Potter probably really was
Draco turned and grabbed the handle of the door, lingering only a second before opening it and exiting without turning back.
As they were drinking coffee and hot tea in their hotel room — “Did you remember…” “Two teaspoons of cold milk and one of sugar? Of course, Draco. I knew how you took your tea when we pretended to hate each other at school, I know it now that I love you.” — the unpleasant feeling of guts wrenching hit them and they braced themselves for another Hop in time.
Harry closed his eyes, trying to picture what Draco would be going through right now. He was probably having a better moment anyway, as Astoria was less inclined to screaming and making scenes.
Harry sighed, stretching on the couch until he was lying on it, one leg dangling off it. “Second floor, third door on the left.”
Everyone’s eyes are on Harry now, and he feels restless. How iss he supposed to tell them the truth?
With that, they took their purses and stalked out. Every person in the restaurant was looking at Harry and Draco, whispering, pointing at them, laughing up their sleeves. Harry stood up suddenly and waved his hands angrily. “What are you looking at?! The show’s over! Mind your business!”
You lift your hands to his face, cupping it. You kiss him, tracing the hem of his lips with your tongue. He lets go of your shirt, circles your waist, keeping you close.
Huffing, Harry looked at it closely —yep, it was a cock, complete with veins and little blobs of come at the tip— and made to move to give it to Gary. “For you,” Harry said, laughing.
Harry nodded. “You must know, I didn’t intend to hurt your mother, ever. Draco and I… we just weren’t able to control it.”
Harry grasped the items from Hermione’s outstretched hands and snorted. “It’s not a problem, thanks ‘Mione!”
“Just tell me if you don’t want to talk, then!” Draco knew he wasn’t making any sense, but he couldn’t help himself around Potter.
“That I am part of his life, that I contributed to form what he is today. And then he said… he said I was being courageous tonight. I am not a bloody Gryffindor, Pansy.”
“Being woken up by sex? A dream. Being woken up by your huge cock burning through my sleepy hole? Sounds painful.”
Then, Ginevra got pregnant and Draco feared it would have been the end of his friendship with Harry. He feared Harry would have forgotten about him, decided he’d be a burden.
Draco smirked, taking off his shirt completely, sending it onto his couch in a neat rectangle. “Sex without stupid chit-chat or sentimentality? Sounds like a deal to me.”
Harry pulled Malfoy’s face close to his, sealing their lips together, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth. He trembled with the power of want that crossed him, feeling he couldn’t resist him anymore.
Harry grabbed the edge of the desk, his knuckles turning white, his stomach whirling in an unpleasant way.
He sat up straight now, not without difficulties. Ginny was right. He smiled at her, trying to look confident. “I’m fine, but thank you for caring, still.”
Draco swallowed his pride, his sexual preferences, his very persona, and married Astoria. They'd been happy, and Scorpius was the light of Draco's life, but something never felt quite right.
Hermione and Ron came through the floo right about the time that the alcohol hit Harry. He tipped over and fell back on the couch. They rushed over to check on him, a little surprised that he was drunk.
Harry yawned before letting her pull him up. He was surprised at the strength she showed. He let her lead him to his room where he made sure he was caught up on his schoolwork. It wouldn’t do to fall behind when he was almost done with school and due to start training in a few weeks. He got his assignments done and even started reading ahead when the knock came. He shut his book and opened the door.
“Yes. You don’t want to get in any deeper. Besides, you have enough saved to cover the rest of your education. You don’t really need any more.”
She laughed. “No, Harry. That felt really good. Stay just like that. You can move a bit faster now.”
“It has to be. Half-bloods and muggleborns who have that much money are few and far between. I can count them on one hand. None of them would willingly hand over that much money to anyone.”
“Oh, the rumors were constantly circulating every time you went out about how you could barely get your hand up your skirt before she shut you down,” she said, chuckling. “She was quite the prude in school.”
“Oh, yes. You wanted me to list everyone in my group, including myself. All right. Fair enough. Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theo Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Gregory Goyle, Astoria Greengrass, and Draco Malfoy.”
“I know,” she sighed. “It must be horrible not being able to see. I have my reasons. I know you will likely be furious when you do figure out who I am. I won’t blame you.”
“Just so you know, if our time together is any indication of how you would be if we were in a relationship, I wouldn’t mind it.”
Harry closed his eyes, although it made no difference. He wiped a hand over his face. “It was material possessions. They meant nothing. She was the one who had everything. Parents, several siblings. I would have given anything for that. A real family.”
“Not long after you proposed. A week or two. Apparently, she thought that she deserved your money since she grew up with nothing while you had everything.”
Draco headed over to Harry whose eyes sparkled when he saw him. Draco leaned down to kiss Harry gently. “You ready? I have to get up early to meet a potential client.”
Harry had talked Draco into attending a Weasley family dinner for the first time. He hadn’t felt comfortable spending time with Harry’s ex-wife’s family but any discomfort was worth it to see how happy it made Harry. He was just glad that Mrs. Weasley had promised that Ginny wouldn’t be there. They had bumped into Ginny a few times while they were out, and it was always uncomfortable. It did help Draco to know how scared she was of him. He hadn’t told Harry, but he had promised her that she would eventually pay for what she did. She wouldn’t know when or how, but retribution was coming.
“Honestly? I would have, too. However, I know it couldn’t be anyone else. The wealthy half-bloods and muggleborns all hate you with a passion.”
“It’s fine. I can always drop him as a client if he gets too difficult to deal with. I don’t need the money, so I can afford to pick and choose my clients.”
He struggled to get the envelope off the owl’s leg before taking a good look at it. The envelope was cream-colored and obviously expensive. It only had his name written on the front of it, and he was curious to see who it was from. He attempted to open it carefully, but his fingers wouldn’t cooperate. The envelope ripped open, a single sheet of parchment flying into the air and fluttering down to land on the floor. He gazed dolefully at it before reaching out to get it. Had he a clear mind, he would have just used his wand. However, he couldn’t reach it or make it come to him with the power of his mind, so he gave up. He decided to find out what it was in the morning. He fell into a fitful sleep, dreaming of living on the streets while a million Ginny’s laughed as they walked by.
He grabbed her hips and pulled her arse hard against him as he rubbed his cock into her in a tight circle. He thrust up hard and fast as he pulled her down into him. He heard her cry out, high pitched and gasping, just before he groaned loudly and came. They sat there gasping and panting as they relaxed in the afterglow. Harry wrapped his arms around her waist to hold her close. Harry turned his head to kiss her cheek.
“Yes. While I grew up in a wealthy family, I didn’t get to take that money with me when I left home. I built my fortune. I did so by being the top ward expert. Don’t think that information can help you with the mystery of my identity. I use an alias and Polyjuice in my career. I digress, though. I know wards inside and out. I can get in any type of ward without setting off an alarm, and I can create impenetrable wards. You wouldn’t believe what kind of money people are willing to spend on security. Of course, my wards are far superior to those that I create for clients. No one has better wards than I do. I can create wards that only affect a specific person or people, I can layer in surveillance spells to see any room in a house, and I can create wards that can withstand any kind of attack, even using muggle means. I placed new wards on the house last night in anticipation of your visit. They take away your sight at any time and in any room. The only exceptions are when I am not in the house and when you are in your quarters with the door shut. I have made arrangements for your everyday life while you are here. Your job will be waiting for you whenever you go back. Your school assignments will be sent here for you to complete along with pensieve memories from each of your classes. Your due dates for assignments will be a day or two later than the rest of the students to make up for the delay in the reception of your assignments. You are able to attend school when there is a need for it. I will be informed ahead of time by your professors when your attendance is necessary. You will be allowed to talk to your friends as often as you like. However, they will not be allowed to come here. I am very particular about my privacy. You should feel honored. You are the only person I have ever allowed here. My home is my sanctuary, and I don’t allow people to enter my sanctuary.”
“First will be disbelief. Then, disgust. Then, anger and betrayal before you go through the floo back to your life. I just want you to know that, when it happens, I’ll still take care of you. You’re mine, and I take care of what’s mine. Just…try not to hate me too much.”
Harry shivered slightly. He no longer cared who she was. He liked this woman. He nodded slowly, swallowing hard. She gently pushed him into the room and over to the bed. Harry had never been so nervous in his life.
Harry had fought against it. He wasn’t willing to divorce her until he got his money back. However, a solicitor had informed him that since they were married, it was legally Ginny’s money, too. There was nothing he could do. He could either get her completely out of his life, or he could stay married to her. There was no other option. While he didn’t get to see or talk to her at all during the divorce process, he had been told that she refused to give the money back. He found out a few months later that she had left him for another man. She married him within a month of their divorce. Eventually, with the help of Ron and Hermione, he realized that she had planned this from the start. Maybe not in the very beginning of their relationship but certainly before the wedding. To try to make ends meet, Harry was forced to take a low-level Ministry job where he was essentially treated as a house elf, forced to run errands that magic could have easily taken care of. The money he made was nowhere near enough to cover his living expenses even as thrifty as he had always been. He often went a day or two without eating to try to save his money for bills. He took care of any injuries at home to avoid paying a large bill to the hospital. He really wanted to further his education to get a good job, but he couldn’t afford tuition. As far he knew, the wizarding world didn’t offer student loans like the muggle world did.
Harry swallowed his bite. “It’s not easy to make your life good when the only job you’re suited for doesn’t pay enough.”
“Aren’t you a curious boy?” she murmured. “I’m just making sure that this goes as seamlessly as possible. You really should thank me. I’ve made sure that it’s clean and stretched for you and got some lube for you to use.”
Hermione went silent as she cleaned up Harry’s sitting room. Harry kept his eyes closed as he listened to the long-familiar sounds of Hermione gathering up clothing and dishes. He pushed away the guilt that Hermione was cleaning his ratty flat. He jumped, startled, when Hermione yelled.
“It’s only natural. She took the only thing your parents left you. It doesn’t mean you’re not good. I would have wanted her to bleed if it was me.”
She sighed. “Yes, I know. I just know that more time will make it worse when you leave. I would rather you leave with my heart still intact.”
“The fact that you could afford to send so much money every month,” Harry said softly as he thought back. “There are very few wealthy half-bloods or muggleborns. Hermione figured it out, actually. It was made easier by the fact that those half-bloods and muggleborns hate me with a passion, I think is how Hermione put it.”
“I have made it my business to know everything about you, Harry. I even know when exactly she decided to do it.”
“That’s because your friend, Hermione, was the one who got the owl that day. She took a quick glance and threw it out.”
Harry stood there in indecision for a moment. He finally started to slowly undress. He did keep his boxers on. “How do you even know that I don’t have anything to do tomorrow?” Harry asked, tugging his clothes off.
“For everything you did for Harry. Ginny really screwed him up, but you fixed him. You gave him back what makes him…well, him.”
Harry was led over to the bed where he sat on the edge. She crawled on the bed behind him before reaching over for the brush next to the bed. Harry sighed when he felt the brush sliding through his hair. He had never realized how nice it could feel. His hair was brushed for several minutes before she sat the brush back down. She began rubbing his shoulders and back as she knelt behind him, knees just resting against his sides. He groaned as she worked through the knots in his shoulders.
“Oh, I know. I heard all about your exploits,” she said. “I knew the very next school day when you finally managed to bed Ginevra.”
Harry wondered what she was doing until he felt her kneel on the floor between his legs. Her hands ran up his thighs and hooked on the waistband of his pajama pants.
“That’s because she has no class or taste. You actually have the best tasting cum I’ve ever had, and I don’t say that lightly. I hate the taste of cum. Yours, however, was quite good. I’ve learned it’s all in the diet. Most men eat a lot of processed food which makes it taste disgusting. I learned over the past few years that you rarely eat processed food. You have a very well balanced diet.”
“A little,” Harry admitted. “I don’t know you. I don’t know your name or what you look like. I have no idea what you’re doing. I mean, are you trying to get to know me? Or trying to seduce me?”
Harry followed her cues as she led him to the bed. He stopped when she did, and he felt her climbing up onto the mattress. She tugged him closer and he knelt on the mattress when he felt himself bump into it.
“I find it exciting. When done right, it’s nowhere near as painful as people believe. Instead, it feels heady and even pleasurable when the right spot is hit.” She licked the tip of his cock.
The house was dark and silent. He slowly walked through the house, wondering if Malfoy was even home. What if he had gone to a club to pick someone up? Harry knew he wouldn’t walk in on Malfoy with someone. He remembered that Malfoy said that no one was allowed in his house. He quietly made his way to the door that he knew led to Malfoy’s bedroom. It was the only place he could be. He wasn’t surprised that the magic protecting the door from his entry was gone. Malfoy never expected to see him again. He opened the door slowly, glad that it didn’t make any noise. He let out an almost inaudible sound of relief when he saw that Malfoy was sleeping. He crept slowly over to the bed. He slowly reached out and gave Malfoy a slight shake.
“I honestly don’t know. I tried asking one or two of them after why they told you that they couldn’t date, but they were dodgy about it. I couldn’t get a straight answer.”
Harry chuckled and jiggled their hands. “Part of it was that I would obey, but I have to admit that you haven’t exactly made me obey much of anything.”
“Yes, I did. I remember hearing you talk about it in school. I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop. I was in the library working on a report. You and your friends took a table on the other side of the bookshelf, and you were all quite loud. It was a bit annoying, actually. It made it difficult for me to concentrate on my work. I was about to yell at you guys to keep it down. I stopped when I heard you talking about your dream house. It sounded perfect. So, when I was about to build my house, I remembered what you said. I kept it in mind as I designed and decorated it. I quite like it. I wish things had been different for you. I would love to know how different and similar our houses would be.”
Harry tipped Draco’s head up to kiss him. “We could always run away and get married. No planning. No girly robes. No mother planning every last detail that should be ours.”
Harry woke up when he heard a knock on the door. He blinked several times as he tried to fully wake. Another knock came and he grumbled. He got up and took a deep breath to prepare himself for the loss of his sight before opening the door.
“All in good time. I need to go wash my hands, and I’m sure you need to clean yourself up and change,” she said.
“If you don’t use it, who knows what will happen to you? I think you should use it. You won’t accept any help from me or Ron. Accept this. Whatever the person wants, I will help you do whatever it is.”
“I suppose you could say romantic interest. Although, you should be warned that I don’t have a romantic bone in my body.”
“No, Harry,” Hermione said emphatically. “You are one of the best men I know. If I hadn’t fallen in love with Ron, I would have asked you out.”
Hermione sighed. “I honestly didn’t think he was serious. I thought it was a trick. I mean, our friends were horrible to him in school. I thought he just wanted to gloat about how far you had fallen. I didn’t want him to kick you while you were down. I realize now that I was wrong. I should have given you the letter and let you make up your own mind.”
“You will?” Harry asked, surprised. He hadn’t expected this to be so short. “What are your plans for tonight?”
“Thank you,” the goblin said distractedly as he scratched his palm and placed his hand flat on the parchment. “It’s done. Here you are.”
“Yes, well,” she cleared her throat. “It doesn’t matter anymore. It was a long time ago. It has nothing to do with today.”
“Mmm, I really love that,” she said with a soft moan as she pressed even more firmly down on his cock. “Now, I will show you where all you’re allowed to touch me for right now. Do not go anywhere else. You can touch me here.” She placed his hands on her thighs again. “Or here.” She placed his hands on her hips. Harry could feel how her hips flared out just slightly. “Or here.” She placed his hands on the sides of her slim waist. “Or here.” She placed his hands on her stomach.
“I don’t even know who you are,” Harry said, getting irritated. “You won’t give me any hint other than we went to school together.”
“Not one. They were never fans of yours, either. They didn’t hate you so much as they just didn’t care at all.”
“Are you sure, Harry? You’ll be completely alone with this person. You don’t know what his or her motives are,” Hermione said.
“I think I’m going to go grab my fiancée and see if we can go home, actually,” Draco said, smirking. “I think I need some quality alone time.”
“Right. I will escort you to your quarters. You will find that it has been stocked with everything you might need. Clothing, toiletries, and the like. You will also find that they are same ones you have at home.”
She laughed softly. “Just pretend it’s dark. I assume you’ve done this in the dark before. It’s no different. You feel instead of see.”
After school, life was going good for Harry. He was able to take his time deciding on his future path with the large inheritance that his parents left him. He proposed to his girlfriend, Ginny. They spent months planning their wedding or rather, Ginny had spent months planning the wedding. Harry had attempted to help in the beginning, but she never liked any of his choices. He had finally left her to it. When the bills came due, he was astonished at how much she had spent. In retrospect, that should have been his first clue. At the time, he had simply paid the bills, attributing her expensive decisions to never having anything as a child. He hadn’t minded spoiling her all that much. It wasn’t as if he couldn’t afford it. His second clue should have been her spending habits after they were married. He rarely checked his balance since he rarely spent much money. He hadn’t realized until two months into their marriage that Ginny was spending more in a month than he spent in a year. They had a huge fight over that. Ginny told Harry that he was being selfish by not wanting to share his money with her, his wife. He rebutted with the argument that she didn’t need even half of the items she bought. He had enough money for them to live a good life without either of them ever working, but she was blowing through the money as if it were nothing. He wanted something to leave to whatever children they had. Ginny had agreed to slow down on her spending even if she hadn’t been happy about it. A month later, Harry had found out she was pregnant. He had been overjoyed. He had been ready to start a family from the moment they said, ‘I do’. He had been heartbroken when Ginny ended up in the hospital a month and a half later after having a miscarriage. Then came the day that Ginny didn’t come home after having lunch with her friends.
“Yeah. I guess I might as well unless I want to lose my home. Maybe I can use some of it for school. You know, work on my future.”
“We just got home, Draco. We’re completely alone. We can take our time since you still won’t let anyone in here,” Harry said.
“Yes. While you haven’t been with anyone since Ginevra left, I know you did get drunk on four separate occasions during which you slept with four different women while you were with her.”
“You have no idea what that confession means to me. To know that you willingly shared one of your darkest secrets with me when you’ve never told anyone else…it’s a gift.” Her hand slowly went around to rub around his chest.
He heard the door shut before he could see again. He went to go wash up before putting his pajama pants back on and crawling into bed. He fell asleep reliving the fantastic blowjob that he had gotten.
“It’s a bit late for that, isn’t it?” Harry snapped. “I’ve already accepted five of them. Shall I remind you of my messages? ‘Get ready. You will obey.’ Obey what? Her? Him? It?
“Reach out until you touch my back.” When Harry’s palm was flat against her back, she continued. “Use your hand as a guide. Keep your hands to the pre-approved areas and just move your hands where you need to. You know where a person’s arse is, so you just move your hand down,” she said, sighing as Harry did so. She gasped when he dipped his finger between her cheeks. “Yes, just like that,” she said with a slight moan. “It shouldn’t be too hard to find it with your other hand now. I know you have good coordination.”
“I needed the top grades in order to gain admittance to the school that my father attended. They only take the best of the best. I suppose that I don’t mind entirely now that I’m looking back, but it was difficult to swallow back then. My father was so disappointed in me. He never said it, but it was there in his eyes every time he looked at me.”
They sat at the table, and Harry was secretly glad that she already knew certain things about him. It seemed to make her conscientious in a way that made him kind of happy. Ginny had certainly never taken that kind of care to put his thoughts, feelings, and wants first like that. After they ate, she walked him to his room.
Malfoy smiled, his eyes closed. “I always sleep naked. I’m tired, though. I worked on some of the most draining wards today. I am physically and mentally exhausted. You don’t have to get naked. You can leave your boxers on. Just get in. Let’s sleep and talk tomorrow. I promise I won’t molest you in your sleep.”
Harry told them the whole story. Beginning to end. He stumbled over some parts, partially from embarrassment and partially from having trouble forming the correct words. When he got to the part where he came home and downed his whisky bottle, he stopped and looked at his hands.
Harry rolled his eyes, still smiling. “I prefer our bed to the hard floor. Besides, this floor is marble. It’s likely to be cold. I don’t want to feel that.”
“I have contacts in the Ministry. One of them saw the whole thing happen. Sent me an owl as soon as it was over. I admit that I was looking for a way to worm into your life in some way. It seemed like a gift that was dropped into my lap. I canceled my appointments for the day to get everything in place.”
“I can’t ask you to do that, Hermione,” Harry muttered, glaring darkly at the parchment. It felt like it was taunting him every time he looked at the amount.
Harry closed his eyes in relief when his vault was opened. It was nowhere near as full as it had been before Ginny, but at least it didn’t look as sad as it had for the past five years. He looked around in amazement at all the gold. He completely ignored Hermione as she gathered up enough galleons for him to buy the things he needed and hadn’t been able to afford since Ginny left. They stopped at a grocer’s on the way home where Hermione filled a cart with enough food to last Harry for awhile. She cooked dinner for him after sending a note to Ron to tell him that dinner would be at Harry’s that night. They filled him in on everything, and Ron kept insisting that Harry shouldn’t have cashed the voucher. He swore it would come back to bite Harry on the arse. At that point, Harry no longer cared. He had food in his house again, Hermione had assured that his overdue bills were paid, and he was going to enroll in school. While life wasn’t exactly good, Harry’s outlook was more positive. He was going to make the most of this money.
The tinkling laugh came again. “Lofty words, I know. It’s how I’ve always felt, though. You are mine.”
Harry spent the next several hours working. He was grateful for dinner when it arrived and ate as he worked on his assignments. When he was finally done, he took a shower and put on a pair of pajama pants. He was toweling his hair when he heard the knock on his door. He opened the door before drying his hair some more. He didn’t hear anything for several seconds.
“Oh, that part wasn’t serious,” she said. “I knew I wanted to give you one word at a time. I needed twelve words, but I realize I only had nine that I wanted to say. That bit was really just to use up words…and I admit that I got amusement from thinking of your reaction that.”
Harry sat down, and they followed the same little ritual that they had breakfast. She fed him while eating in between his bites.
Malfoy made some sleepy noises before another shake woke him up. He blinked several times as he looked up at Harry. “Harry?” he muttered sleepily. “What are you doing here?”
“I’m glad you did,” Harry said. “Who knows where I would be if you hadn’t? Probably living on Ron and Hermione’s couch.”
Harry laughed as she pushed against his chest until he was laying back on the bed. He lifted his hips to let her slide his pajamas off his body.
“Yes, I know. That’s why you got fired from the Ministry,” she said, laughing. “You couldn’t just suck it up for another day.”
Then came the day that he had finally had enough of his crappy job. It was five years after his divorce. He was sick of being a slave to those in powerful positions at the Ministry when he couldn’t even afford to eat on a regular basis. He had gone off on his boss for being ‘asked’ to clean the man’s clothing. That didn’t fall anywhere under his duties, and it was the final straw. He was immediately fired. It didn’t sink in right away what kind of position he was in. He went to Ron and Hermione’s, but only Hermione was there. She listened to him rant and rave until he began to panic as he realized that he had nothing anymore.  She offered to loan him money until he could find a new job, but his pride wouldn’t allow him to accept. Instead, he accepted the Firewhiskey that she offered him and got blind drunk. After Ron got home, he sighed and helped Harry through the floo. He got Harry settled on the couch since he was too drunk to make it up the stairs. Harry was dozing off when an owl flew through the open window.
Harry whirled around to face him. “You’re right!” he yelled, face getting red. “I’m not gay, Malfoy! I wouldn’t have slept with you if I knew you were a man! Merlin! Why are you still naked?!”
“Oh, that. It came last night. I have no idea what it is,” Harry said dismissively before laying back down.
Harry mumbled something before closing the door and leaning back on it. His sight was instantly back. He peered around the large sitting room. He barely took in any of the details of the room. He saw a door ahead of him and walked to it. When he opened the door, he saw a huge bedroom that was easily three times the size of his own bedroom. However, the bedroom was set up the same way as his bedroom at home. The pillows and blankets all matched identically to his own. The only difference was that these were brand new. He found the closet and saw his clothes in there. Upon closer inspection, he realized they weren’t actually his clothes. They were just brand new copies of all of his clothes. Opening up the drawers in the closet showed that even brand new underwear and socks that matched his were available. He swallowed hard as he stumbled backwards out of the closet. He ran to the bathroom where he threw up in the toilet until nothing was left to come up. He sat on the floor of the bathroom for hours as his mind whirled with everything he learned. He was trying to reconcile how beautiful her voice and laugh was with how obviously crazy she was. When his body grew too stiff to sit there, he got up and headed to the bed. He groaned at how big and soft the bed was. He fell into a fitful sleep as he tried to figure out whether she was Pansy, Daphne, or Astoria.
“They were all a part of the social outcast group at school. You remember how Seamus taunted them and humiliated them?”
Another laugh. “Always so blunt, Harry. I can assure you that I am neither ugly nor deformed. There are many ways we can get to know each other. I don’t plan on letting you leave until we do.”
Harry almost laughed hysterically. She wanted to “make the most of this visit”. As if he had come over for tea. “Can I just go to my room?”
“You ever want something? Really badly? But you can’t have it? You can have anything else but what you want? You’re that for me. I have managed to get every man I have ever even kind of wanted, but I could never have you. I knew I couldn’t even try.”
A few moments later, she gasped and cried out as she clenched around him. Harry bit his lip to try to hold out for a few more moments, but it was no use. He gave a stifled groan as he unloaded himself inside her. Harry barely managed to fall to the side instead of on top of her. He felt incredible, but he was exhausted. He yawned as he felt her hand slide into his.
Harry looked at her like she had grown a second head. “First, she never wore shoes. At all. It was snowing, and she was barefoot.”
“Please,” he breathed, the confidence he had been feelings moments before suddenly slipping away.  “Just talk to me.”
His hold on her tightened just a little, the pressure of his fingers on her body eliciting feelings she had never experienced before but found she liked very much.
Narcissa shot him a furious look – she was ready to abandon the cause, he knew.  Had been for awhile actually.  The only reason she had stuck with it as long as she had was because of Draco and his future, but now, with this newest revelation…
Severus shook his head.  “If I am being honest, I do not believe Draco is any longer devoted to the cause.”
Potter took a tiny step back, her cheeks flushing.  “I – uh…I don’t think that’s a good idea right now.  So if you would please just give me my book…”
“Have you ever kissed anyone?  Weasley?”  Just the thought of the ginger-haired oaf kissing her lips before his made his stomach turn.
Abruptly, Narcissa stood up and started pacing around the room.  “Well, I like it,” she declared challengingly.  “I like her.  She’s a beautiful girl, both inside and out.  A bit headstrong at times from what I’ve been told, but I suppose anyone in her position would be.”
Great Neptune, the boy looked pleased with himself.  Annoyed at being caught, yes, but there were definitely undercurrents of satisfaction with what had just transpired between him and the girl next to him.
He whipped around, his mouth twisted in a scowl as he came face to face with the girl, his mind attempting to conjure any reason at all as to why she was suddenly standing there with him.
“Narcissa,” Lucius said incredulously, his head snapping in her direction so fast he wondered if a person could give their own self whiplash, “just what are you saying?!”
“Because…”  She turned away from him then, unable or not wanting to meet his gaze, and stared unseeingly at some nearby portrait.  “Because you’re you.”
It was almost unbelievable.  So unbelievable he could almost believe this whole past crummy year hadn’t happened.  Could almost believe he wasn’t branded with some hideous mark on his arm or threatened with imminent death.  Could almost believe he was just a teenage boy who liked a girl and the world wasn’t falling apart all around them.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” he barked, one of his hands leaping to his hair where he began anxiously running his fingers through it.
“I don’t know if ‘terrible’” Severus said carefully, “would be the word for this particular piece of information.”
“Yes, dear godson,” the professor sneered, “it is, as my life hangs on the line just as much right now in all this as yours does.”
Her voice was breathy sounding – a result of his ministrations, no doubt – and it made Draco’s mouth twist into a very pleased smirk as he said, “Good,” and continued to caress her lips with his own.
“Potter,” he barked, the girl paling visibly at his address.  “Fifty points from Gryffindor.  Go to your dormitory and do not leave there until breakfast.  One of the castle’s elves will bring you your supper tonight.”
Never one for small talk or long-winded speeches, Severus cut straight to the chase: “It concerns Draco.”
The professor literally felt his jaw drop open, and for a moment – a tiny miniscule moment – he lost all bearing of himself, then,
“Y-yes, Professor,” the girl stuttered out and turned to leave, her usual irritating confidence around him nowhere in sight.  Draco reached out to grab her hand, but Severus shot him a look and the boy scowled and watched disappointedly as the witch swiftly exited the bathroom.
Oh, how long he had privately imagined this very scenario.  Her and him.  Locked against each other in just this very way.  Well, not in a boy’s bathroom, but…
Draco watched dumbfounded for a moment as the witch quickly began gathering her forgotten belongings from the floor.
Draco stepped forward, closing the space between them again.  “Why, Potter?  Are you worried about something happening?”
“You wondered who could possibly be talking to me?!” Moaning Myrtle sniffed, the pitch of her voice rising with each word.  “Who could possibly want to have anything to do with poor pathetic Moaning Myrtle?”
A second silence since the start of their little meeting filled the room; a time during which Lucius scrambled to make sense of his jumbled thoughts – thoughts that were now kicking into survival mode, not for him but for his son.  Draco.  The sweet tiny baby he had held in his arms years ago.  The little boy that had grown into a young man and who now faced risk of death.
He set the pieces of broken pencil to the side and stared at the woman he once had called his wife, and who almost all the world still thought was so except for a very very few people.  “
Lucius regarded the slim piece of cedar in the other wizard’s hand, the usual pang of anger, envy, and regret welling up inside of him at the sight of a wand, then shook his head.  “Of course not, go ahead.”  And he watched as the dark-haired man waved his wand in the air, casting a locking charm on the door as well as a
“God, Draco, you’re so tight. So good. So fucking good. Can’t believe you're mine. Fuck.” He rams me into the wall and I’m so glad we moved out of our old apartment in London. There we had to constantly be checking our silencing spells, but here there's no one around for at least a mile.
I sit through a few short minutes of another dancer’s act before standing and making my way to the door near the back of the room. A man stands near it wearing tight trousers and a shear black shirt. He opens the door for me as I near and I make my way into a brightly lit hallway lined with numbered doors. I know Draco is in room two, his room, and I can only hope that Mia, another dancer and one of Draco’s closest friends, isn't in there with him. I would really like to peel those sinful shorts off of him before our usual stop to get take-out. I knock when I get to the door.
“I’m gonna cum, Harry,” I whisper frantically, “gonna cum, gonna cum, gonna-” I think I forget to breathe as I cum. I throw my head back as the waves pummel through me and I spurt across our chests and stomachs, hooking my nails into Harry’s slick back. Harry follows soon after, his release hot in me. He stumbles with me still in his arms to the sofa and nearly collapses on top of me.
So, after packing two absurdly large overnight bags, because apparently the twins use a lot more shit daily than I realized, we’re sending the kids off. Hermione and the three kids go through the floo first, after many hugs, and then Weasley follows with the bags. Before the light from the floo is even totally gone, Harry’s on me, pressing me to the wall and attacking my neck.
“You know I do,” he groans. I hear his belt buckle hit the ground and when I turn my head, there he is in all of his tanned glory. He’s all muscle. Where I’ve gone soft over the years, his muscles have only become more defined. A fine line of hair leads down to a truly magnificent cock that’s currently red and dripping. The sight nearly makes me drool.
My hands fly to his hair as I let out breathy whines. Merlin I don't know how he knows all of the little sensitive places on my neck but he uses that knowledge spectacularly. I thread my fingers through his curls and tilt my head to give him better access.
“Merlin, Harry!” I groan when he bites hard into the crook of my neck and sucks. I slot my thigh in between his and feel him already half-hard against me. He bites a trail up my neck so that he can properly sink his tongue into my mouth. Kissing Harry is a ride. He can be very gentle or, like now, he’s ferocious. I feel as if I need to hold onto something. Like I’m going to fall off the edge of a cliff. He’s clutching at my waist and back as he ravages my mouth, continuously sliding from my hips to my back and slipping his fingers just under my t-shirt and the band of my trousers and pants before moving back. I press my thigh against his hardness again before removing my hand from his hair and snaking it between us to unfasten his trousers and slip my hand into his pants. He pulls his mouth away from mine and buries his face in my neck when I start to stroke him slowly.
When she’s finally finished and walks off stage, blowing kisses to the audience, the lights dim to dark red and I push my chair out in anticipation.
“That's alright. There are plenty of mugs out there.” From upstairs we hear one of the twins start crying and the other will be soon to follow. The joys of twins. “Now, if you still want to help, you can get some cheerios and give them to your sister in her highchair while Papa and I get the twins.” I glance at Harry, still in just his boxers, who's putting a much happier Lily in her chair. “Okay?”
“Of course I bloody did. Have you seen yourself in these shorts?” I bite hard at the crook of his neck and shoulder and he yelps. I soothe the bite with my tongue.
“Cultured folk.” I try to push his head towards my now tented pants. “Harry, hurry up.” Harry grins and moves to nuzzle my straining cock through my pants.
“You’ll regret it when we have to wake up for the twins in a few hours and I don't want to deal with that.” He suddenly hoists me up bridal style, making me squeal. “So bedtime!” I lean my head on his shoulder and breathe him in. He smells like cheap cologne and bread from his bakery. Yup! Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world, and the chosen one is a baker! And a damn good one. In fact, he won some sort of best baker shit just a little while ago. Harry always smells like bread. Even when we’re on vacation for a week. I press my nose into that smell and let it fill my whole body. I don't remember falling asleep, but when I wake up, it's in bed to the sound of two screaming babies.
“Duty calls!” he mumbles against my temple. I groan into his bare chest. I really just want a good blowjob and a nap.
“Want you, Harry. It’s been so long. Want you so bad.” I let go of my arse cheek to pull at my throbbing cock. That’s when Harry’s calloused hands turn me around by the waist to bite at my mouth.
“Well who knew that an owl emporium of all things would be so tiring.” I lay my head back on his shoulder and let my eyes drift closed.
“God you’re beautiful,” he groans and takes me in his mouth. It’s hot and wet and he’s so perfect with his mouth wrapped around me and his golden skin and dark curls. He sucks hard and swishes his tongue with no rhythm and god how is he so fucking good. I throw my head back and press a hand to my lips to stop any sound from escaping when he takes me in deep and squeezes me with his throat. I’m there. I’m right there. I’m panting into my hand and I’m going to cum. I can feel the heat start to build in my core and then there's a crash and a shriek. Harry pulls off my cock and mirrors my wide eyed look of surprise and slight horror before we both spring up. Harry has the foresight to throw me my nightshirt before bolting out the door with me quick on his heels while pulling the nightshirt over my head frantically.
“I wanted to take care of Lily and make you and Daddy coffee so you could sleep,” he whispers. “But I dropped the cup and Lily started crying and I’m sorry, Papa!” He tears trickle down his cheeks and Harry locks eyes with me. How did we manage to get such a perfect son?
We find our toddler, Lily, sitting on the floor crying and Scorpius kneeling over her trying desperately to quiet her with a broken mug near them. But no one seems to be hurt.
“Yes please. Put it in me,” he wines, pulling me down by my hair to shove his tongue in my mouth. I wipe my hand on a towel on the vanity before separating my lips from Draco’s to yank off my trousers and pants. Draco wraps a hand around my now exposed length and gives me a few delicious tugs. I pull his legs so that his bum is just off the vanity and pull one up over my shoulder. He’s breathing heavily and his face down to his cock is flushed soft pink. I’ve never been more in love with him. I lean down to kiss his neck gently.
“Hey! Those are expensive heels!” I know he doesn't care about the heels, he’s just trying to get under my skin. He pulls me between his legs and holds me close with them so he can pull my t-shirt over my head. He pinches my nipple between his fingers hard and I grunt, then he leans in to close his lips over it. I throw my head back and moan loudly, weaving one hand into Draco’s smooth, blond hair to hold him there. When he pulls back there’s a ring of black lipstick around it. He looks up at me. His hair’s a mess, his cheeks are flushed, and his lipstick’s smudged. He’s never looked more beautiful. I lean down and press my lips to his. They’re soft and warm and perfect. He pushes a hand into my hair to angle my head and push his tongue into my mouth. I sink, our lips still connected, until I’m kneeling in front of him and he has to bend down. I pull away from him to nuzzle his cock through those tight shorts. All my blood is making its way south.
“Yes, that sounds good! We’ll have to run it by the men first.” Hermione scoffs with a smile. “I’m very certain that neither of them will say no.”
“Of course I know that! But right now I really want wine and sex but my hips and back hurt so no sex and no wine for obvious reasons!” James has started chewing on her finger but she doesn't seem to care. Her hair is a frizzy mess on her head and there are bags under her eyes.
I let out a very loud whistle and his grey eyes snap to mine. He smirks, winks, and, without breaking eye contact, sucks the end of the riding crop into his mouth while still rubbing between his legs. After sucking on the crop for a few good seconds, he pulls it out slowly and lays it next to him before pushing himself onto all fours and crawling to the front of the stage. When he gets to the very edge, he sits on his bum and spreads his legs, letting them dangle off the stage. The tables in front, which are packed much tighter then the rest and affectionately called the “sardine tables” by the staff, stretch out their arms to try to hand him galleons and sickles.
“You know I always do.” I move my hand to smack his arse hard and he turns his face toward the sardine tables with his mouth open.
He squeezes a hand between us to pull at my aching cock. I can feel my orgasm building in my lower stomach hot and fast.
