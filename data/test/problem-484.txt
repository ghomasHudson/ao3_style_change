Harry looked around the room, suddenly wondering why they didn't put a Glamour on it or transfigure it into something more homely.
“I don’t know why you keep it a secret,” She whispered to him. His eyes widened and he looked up at her in shock. “I can see it, I can tell.”
“Why are we going to the end of the hall?” He asked her. She waved at him to come with her, so he ran after her, down the hall.
Harry climbed onto the bed and waited to see if Draco complained but when the blonde didn’t say anything, he continued to crawl over him on the bed and sat himself down on top of Draco’s arse. He blushed at the plushness of it, and was rather glad Draco was facing away from him. Though if he kept having such indecent thoughts Draco wouldn’t need to see his face in order to know how Harry was feeling.
“I’d prefer if you didn’t do anything for me.”
"Ah," Harry says. "So I'm the decoration."
"Nobody," Harry laughs. Ginny's a riot.
matter? I've had my cock in you, and you don't even bloody recognise my best friend, nevermind that she went to the same school with you for seven years—"
"Potty," Draco said, his mouth never failing to fall open at the wrong time. "Not you, um. You're—Potty. Not Potty.
I gave a lazy stroke of Potter's dick. As if Potter could be just anyone to me. Years spent fantasising, and now—
He was at the library when he turned down the aisle and ran into Harry Potter. Their eyes met in a frenetic spark of recognition. Then Sickles and quills began spilling out of Harry’s pockets, and Harry was calling out for Draco to wait up.
“Why not?”
," Draco murmurs, his ear against Harry's heart as he reaches around a hand and slides slick fingers back into Harry.

Draco raises a brow. "Of course you can't. We'll buy you a dresser. One that folds garments up as soon as you drop it in because Merlin knows you won't do it yourself." He lifts his wand, and like that, the last closet in all of Grimmauld Place disappears.
With late afternoon came the shadows of a summer drawn on too long, faces cast saccharine-bright with a harshness only truth could bring. Harry looked at me, and I at him, time arrested under amber. Notice me, my silence plead. Let the seasons change. Let me prove I’m better than him.

"I dunno. One?"
Harry turned the book to Draco. "Look at this lad. Says they can spit venom into the eyes of predators ninety-nine times out of hundred."
"Yeah." Harry grins, emboldened. "You should try it."

Draco Malfoy builds a budding career in Muggle skateboarding. (606 words)
They’ve been pushing ninety-nine in a sixty-five. Harry can’t explain why he keeps wanting stupid things like this, like Draco. He should slow down or put his foot down or go and have his meltdown at home or something, but he’s too stupid on want to do anything except keep his hands on the wheel and his eyes straight ahead.
Draco's kitchen is very nice. Adult. Lots of scrubbed-white subway tiles; navy blue cabinets with brass fixtures. Everything is put in place, except for the refrigerator, which has a whole album's worth of photos stuck on it in every which way.
"Yes, but you're in

Harry peers around the bar. It's sleek: turquoise mosaic walls and solid walnut tables, modern chandeliers—the ones that look like used up toilet paper rolls painted black—hanging down from the ceiling. Ron's right, though. There are loads of paps, though Harry didn't notice them coming in. They're like background buzz to him by now. Gnat animagus, the lot of them. But it
Pansy raised a brow. "And that's working for you?"
war crimes—my solicitor built a woefully convincing case that I couldn't kill a Flitterby—but couldn't a bloke contain a multitude of feels? Why couldn't I despair with the same bloody breath I used to yawn?
Harry agreed because he doesn’t see the use in arguing in the little time he has left. Loving someone back means making concessions for the things they do that make you want to die, and yet Harry still thinks he’ll miss being in love.
"And how's that to do with me?"
"You’re not making sense."
Harry's voice is still hoarse from last night, and the smoking makes it worse. "You act tough, but you're not really," he says.

. If Harry wasn't rock hard, he would've kicked Malfoy out already.
In Draco's dreams, he is running. Running forward into the light, the skin peeling off from him until he is eleven again, then ten, then five, crawling, crying, sobbing, his skin growing wrinkled and old, his hair sprouting full-white, and he's seventy, sixty, fifty, stocky limbs willowing down, slender until he's twenty-three again, and he's run all the way back to himself, full-circle.
cw: werewolves, mild blood.
"Are you mocking me?" Draco huffs, glancing back.
"Thanks," Harry says, trying not to cringe at the mention of Draco's new boyfriend. Is it already that serious?
"You don't have to do anything you don't want to do," Draco says firmly, and that's the end of it.
Ginny's practice is running late; Neville's at a reading for a book he'll never even open. Hermione says it's
“What do they call you here? King Potter?”
“I KNOW,” the stranger shouts back, hoarse but electric: zap-zap snaps down Draco’s spine. Draco turns ten degrees per beat until he meets Harry’s eyes, strobing neon voltaic green.
So it was like this, day in and day out. Mornings jerking off, a late breakfast with Kreacher. Walks out in the neighbourhood. The occasional dinner at the Burrow, where there was always enough said to say nothing at all. "You don't owe them anything. Not even the people you love," I said when we were back in bed again. Then we jerked off, little zap-zips so good, they left us shivering. Time passed like a dream. I'd have missed my own verdict if it wasn't for a chance glimpse of the headlines from a newsstand on a croissant run.
"About what?"
—and Harry finally hears it for what it is.
“Why does that matter?”
Harry cleans up the broken glass. He helps himself to her gin and pours them another round of drinks.
"That's not a bad idea," Harry says.
Enough is enough.
"It's the bloody Room of Requirement, isn't it? And it appears I'm in need of a corporeal set of hands."
When Neville passed, he tipped his hat, but his face didn’t change. I pulled him to the side and asked if he wanted to have a drink. He was taken aback, as we hadn't spoken in years. Still, he acquiesced. The name Harry Potter still held weight, and he couldn’t afford a public condemnation.
For drarrymicrofic prompt: vibrant.
"Let me read—" Hermione reaches.
Draco’s voice was never too loud, even when he spoke normally. Harry must’ve gotten used to it, like how he’d gotten used to the clock, one steady tick after the next, counting down the seconds until it was time.
Harry laughs around the piercing pain in his chest. "Merlin, I feel awful. He asked me if I hated him."
"No," Harry says. He throws away the vial in a huff and vanishes it before it shatters against the wall. "I fucking hate money. I would give it all up for some peace and fucking quiet."
Harry bends over to thumb the sweaty bangs out of Draco’s eyes. “Looks like it,” he says.
"You have ten minutes," Hermione says.

Okay, maybe she was a wee bit in the wrong.
Does he?
“Besotted? You learn that word from Hermione?”
We were at the park because no one wanted to work—we being the three of us and Harry, who didn’t work anyway. “Working on my life” was the official stance. “Working for free” was closer to the truth, though I learned to keep my misgivings quiet. Everyone had something to prove, which was why I worked fifty hours a week at St Mungo’s, and Harry “worked” a benefit a night for his boyfriend’s political aspirations.
Harry gives a helpless shrug of his shoulders. He's learned to let Ginny do the talking, and if Dean wants to believe that Harry's "overly powerful, Voldemort-killing" magic threw a magnum of vodka over the more realistic version that it was Ginny who did it, then so be it.
The straw dangles off Ron's mouth. He chews it distractedly. "Just like that?"
“Ok, but I’m warning you, they don’t serve fancy shit. No steaks and ca-vi-ar.”
“What happened to you,” I say.
. Draco's dick was so hard, it hurt. And all it took was twenty seconds in Harry Potter's mouth—not that he was going to let Harry know that.
Eltanin hands him the blunt with a sigh. Harry brings it to his lips and inhales, letting the smoke fog his thoughts. Eltanin is chatty when high—chatty all the time, honestly—but Harry keeps his mouth shut because he's afraid he'll puke if he doesn't.
"You better put the kettle on, tea lad." Pansy rapped the paper over the table and stood up, swinging a black purse over her shoulder. "Off to work for me, then. Don't burn the house down."
"I get that a lot," Harry says with a cocky smirk and reaches out for Malfoy's arm to pull him back in.
“You tell me,” Draco said, horrified.
"It's the 23rd," Pansy said when she stepped through the Floo no less than ten minutes late to her own party. "A day of celebration. Your house was the obvious choice of venue. Good light, plenty of odd talking pieces, an eccentric recluse. That's you, if I wasn't clear. Relax, darling. Can't you see this house is dying to be seen? She's far too chic to keep hidden away."
"I was three years under you at Hogwarts." Eltanin wrinkles his nose, but he doesn't show any sign of annoyance beyond that. It's a wonder the amount of bullshit people will put up with when you're famous.
“You’re my mother,” I said, because I had nothing else left to say. It came out like an accusation.

Not much, his cock mumbles under his jeans, despondent. Harry's about to shove off when one of them asks Harry if he really went to Hogwarts with Dennis Creevy, who dropped out of Hogwarts to be a bigshot movie director after his brother's death.

Ginny pinches Harry's cheek and pulls until it hurts. "You're really quite ordinary," she says. "I don't understand the fuss."

Harry caught a rare flash of sympathy wrinkle across Draco’s brow before it flattened into indifference.
“No.” Harry grits his teeth, narrows his eyes on the road marks blurring beneath them. The car strums wild under his palms, and he feels it straining to break free like a beast chained to his own chest.
We go on a drive today, to the hills. It rained a few days back and washed the slopes green with fuzzy newborn grass, curling into the earth more like moss than the wild, wind-whipped blades come fall. I love the hills this time of year, the cold still cutting but the sky above a blazing, bright blue and every breath like a drink of spring, fresh and raw and alive.
“Again?”
“Your loss,” he says.
"I'm just..." Draco sighs. Pansy can practically see him running an agitated hand through his hair. She's tickled over how much he cares about her, however misplaced.
Draco swallowed. His hips jerked up, but his mouth remained a thin line.
"The numbers aren't looking good for me," Hermione says. It's lunch at Plow again, sandwiches again—the economical choice for lunch—ready as soon as they sit, but she hasn't so much as touched her plate. Instead, Hermione holds an unlit cigarette between two fingers and smashes it repeatedly against the edge of the table like she wants to destroy it. Like she loves hating how much she wants to smoke more than smoking itself.

“Am too.”
"Yes, the Slytherins—"
"Fuck." Draco bit his lip, straining for composure as blood pooled to his groin. His cock hit the back of Harry's mouth. It slid in an impossible centimetre deeper and Harry gagged, throat constricting around Draco's cock for a second before he struggled to pull off to breathe.
“You know.” Harry stretches an arm over the back of the booth. The morning light blinds at eye level through the slats, fat bars of alternating light and dark slicing up the hook of Draco’s nose, a harsh brow.

Harry got up from the chair and crossed his arms. He tried not to smile, though he was bursting to, inside.
"I want so badly to, you don't understand. You're amazing." Draco leans his head against Harry's shoulder, the halo of his hair tickling Harry's nose. "You make me want to be bad."
Harry rocked his hips, Draco's cock somehow sinking even deeper in him. "That's right," Harry said, his voice still composed. "I knew. It's lucky I like getting fucked, you see. You thought you won, but you didn't.

Draco moves to block her view, but Hermione's already out of her stool and walking toward the photos for a closer look. And of course, there it is: evidence of a secret she's long suspected since Harry started begging off dinners to “go home and relax."
Draco leaves the perfumed invitation on his bedside table half-folded in a paper doily, pink ribbon unknotted and crumpled to the side, the morning light a hot slice of summer lancing across the front.
Woodfire ash and glow. The warm hum of a song cottoning in the ear. A cascade of crimson silk under my fist. Laughter gurgles in my throat; boils over when the woman takes me in her arms and I look into her eyes, green as the last flash before the world goes still.
He excuses himself. I wait an hour, two. Three, and his soda's gone flat. But I know where to find him.
“White shirt, suit jacket, skinny tie. It’s all you ever wear.”
Twenty minutes passed before Harry walked Draco to the door. The rain had started up a slow drizzle down, and Harry wondered what it’d feel like to be soaked in it, so he stepped outside.

When Harry returns, they take the trail out to the lake just beyond the hills. It’s just steep enough to be hard, and there’s nothing beyond it except a mirror of their own lake. But they go, “for the pleasure of it,” Harry says, even though they both know that’s a lie.

It's not the first time he's dragged Malfoy into his delusions, though Harry would be the first to admit that Malfoy isn't even particularly fit—he's slender as bones, and Harry bets he can't give a blowjob without slipping some teeth—but that's not the point. Harry's bored of hot, perfect sex with models who know how to keep their arses tight and their mouths shut. What he can't get is someone to hate him. And Malfoy has no trouble doing that.
So, when Draco Malfoy builds a budding career in Muggle skateboarding, of course Harry Potter is going to notice even if Draco grows his hair ragged and inks his arms up in tats.
"We just need some space," Ron said before shoving her out the door.
It's like whiplash, Draco thinks. He's lost his head. Breath stuttering, he lolls forward, his forehead thudding against Harry's firm chest.
“Don’t you know,” he starts again. He’s sitting up on my bed, sheets pooled around his waist. I’m still on my stomach with my face half-pressed in the pillow. A breeze’s blown in, the kind that lingers; cold, but not enough for you to move, until it’s too late.
Ginny orders them another round and a reluctant plate of sweet potato chips after the server insists that this isn't a
“Right.”
Draco took a hesitant step through the doorframe, reluctant as though he were passing through a portal to another dimension. “You’re a good Minister. The best, even,” he said, his eyes earnest in a way that Harry’d only seen before, in his dreams, right before he’d undressed Harry down to his heart.
Was it really that simple? Harry pulls Malfoy from the Fiendfyre. Malfoy fails to identify Harry's bloated face in the dungeons. And like that, they're bound together, destined to drive each other mad for eternity.
They lose Ron between shots six and not-enough-fingers-to-count (how many does he have on each hand again?). Ginny's shimmying against Harry in a blur of denim and silver when suddenly, she freezes, her abrupt stillness jerking Harry into a single second of clarity where he makes out Malfoy entering the bar with some woman on his arm.
"Why would I, when you'll summarise it for me?"
"Don't say that. I don't think I could handle ghosts right now."
The train jerks to a halt. Pansy follows the people out and up the stairs of the underground. The sun is settling on the horizon, purplish as a bruised orange.

"It's not about the money," Malfoy says. He drops onto his knees and tilts his face up. Harry stares down at him between the vee of his legs; Malfoy's mouth is so very pink against all that milky white skin.
“I don’t.”
Eltanin lingers in the doorway, his fingers brushing the door jamb. He says, "Draco's new boyfriend sucks. You're way fitter, seriously."
“Minister…”
Ginny pulls a Muffliato on them. "Foreplay," Harry sees her mouth to Pansy, rolling her eyes. Pansy grins.
It’s like nothing’s changed when they meet again. Harry’s wearing a Gryffindor-red headband with the Nike swoosh, gaze unblinking over Draco on the opposite side of the court. Draco grinds his white shoe into the clay and kisses the ball once before he serves. The crowd hushes; Harry lunges—chasing.
“You,” he says.
She really only said that she
Get him back from
not getting fucked."
Harry smirks. "Yeah? What'd I do this time?"
"I don't want to be rich," Harry says, then laughs over how stupid he sounds. Not rich! He's no more than a line in a history book if he isn't also rich.
Ah. Of course. How had the florist known before Harry? The flowers were for Draco from the start.
Draco sighs. “All that blood is so damn pretty.” A wet shimmer coats his bottom lashes. “I’m sick, I know.”
“Open sesame,” Harry says to his favourite thieves.
warnings: reckless driving
Harry barks out a dismissive laugh. He walks into his townhouse and Apparates straight to his bed, where he jerks off slowly, imagining Malfoy swallowing his cock.
Draco had a good body, almost unjustly so, if it weren’t for his bony elbows. Sex with him bruised me up, but I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t what was good about it. It was a distraction from the nightmares.
"It's like we swapped places," Malfoy laughs after. "You're alone in the last relic of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, and I've got two roommates and a Victorian terrace in a Muggle part of town."
"We didn't
"Oh, I dunno. When's the last time you asked about me? I don't mean to guilt you—just, you were out of sorts for so long, and now finally…now finally...I mean, who knew Draco Malfoy would be the one to—"
Draco took out his own Sickle, the one he kept around because it was heads on both sides—a guaranteed win. "I'll toss," Draco said, rubbing the trick Sickle between his fingers. He tossed, called heads, and won. Dead simple. And now he was going to fuck Harry Potter.
They make a mess of the kitchen island.
“Shut up,” you say. You pull me in by the collar and cut your tongue against my fangs. Your blood burns, trickling down my chin. “Shut up,” you say. “Shut up and let’s go.”

He loves me with damp eyes and trembling fingers, with stiff shoulders and a sweat-slick brow. He loves me, though he’s never confessed in the light of day when the sun illuminates the impossibilities.
Draco took a deep breath. Pansy was right; he had no choice now but to inventory.
I step down from the ladder and wipe my hands over my apron. My hands aren’t dirty, but a grime settles under my nails all the same. From across the counter, two cuts slash down Potter’s cheek in an unbalanced cross. I recognise one, but the other is new, still puffy from a flesh-stitching charm.
“When I was little, I lived in a castle. It was a beautiful castle, the walls were this gorgeous shade of white, weird as it is to say that. My mother, she would slide down the railing on the stairs. She would wear this bright blue flowy dress, that when she landed would twirl around her waist and flutter at her ankles. She was wonderful, and kind, she would bake me sweets, even though we had elves for that. She was an amazing witch, she was a scientist too, would create potions and serums of the sort. She once told me this inspiring story of how a prince would come for me, and we’d fall in love and he’d give me a rose. At the end of her story, she created a rose, and brought it out from behind her back. I laughed and laughed. She died when I was nine.” Every word flowed from Luna’s mouth, expressing an image so terribly bright in Harry’s mind. Luna smiled sadly at the memory.
Draco led him back to the Throne Room, which was at the end of the corridor. The room was empty except for the King’s throne. The King and Queen had left the room it seemed, and it was just the two of them now. Seamus and Dean walked in, and set up a wooden table. Draco gestured for Harry to sit down on the bench seat, so he did.
“No, Malfoy just ordered me around. He made me feel like he was a good person, that I could trust him. I was wrong, he tricked me. I was stupid,” Harry muttered. He had personally witnessed Draco beating his two friends unconscious, and afterward he had the audacity to believe Draco was a good person. All because Draco had been nice to him, had smiled, had given him food?
Harry felt like he was about to collapse by the time they finished cleaning the castle. Hermione had sent him down to the kitchen to tell the elves to make breakfast for the masters. He was on his way back up to the second floor to set the table for breakfast. It had felt like an entire day had passed, but it had only been a few hours, Harry wanted to sleep, eat, something.
Harry laid in his cot and stared at the ceiling. He had the blankets pulled up to his chin. Draco’s soft breath filled the room, otherwise the room was silent. The thoughts in Harry’s mind, however, were loud. Had Draco heard him, there was no way the Prince hadn’t heard him as he’d been sitting right next to him. Harry pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes and sighed in frustration.
Draco had disappeared into the room, and Harry walked over to it. It was in the middle of the hallway on the left, with two other bedrooms next to it. There were large windows off to the right side. The doors were spread so far apart, Harry had guessed the size before even looking into Draco’s room. What he wasn’t prepared for, was the design.
When they walked into the Throne Room, Ron levitated the plates into their respective spots. There were four spots at the table, rather than the usual three, but Ron said nothing of it. Harry watched in amazement as Ron brought in the silverware using his magic. When Ron was finished he returned to Harry’s side by the door, awaiting the arrival of the Malfoy's.
“Ulysses,” Draco answered. “The English term for Odysseus, on of the most powerful men alive in Greece. Even so that he was revered among gods. He won many battles with his mighty power and won over many women. He could have had anyone he wanted, and no one would have questioned him.”
The thing is, I know you’re right, though. There’s a good chance that you wouldn’t have made it out of there if I had reacted differently.
Merlin forbid, what if you found me about as attractive as an old troll? Don’t laugh! It might happen! Then you’d spend your Christmas holidays despondent, miserable, and let down by love.
You said that Potter should stop his ‘tedious do-gooder Saviour act’ a while ago. That’s what I meant when I said that it’s not an act. You can see the indignation in his face and he’s exceptionally bad at hiding it.
This friend you’re so annoyed with sounds like someone who genuinely cares about you. So I’m sure they’ll be all right if you tell them to kindly fuck off and leave you alone for a while.
Okay, I’ve been thinking. Add a sentence in the beginning, like this:
“I don’t know why you’re showing me this,” I replied to Hermione, my anger making my voice bristle more than I would have liked. Ron looked up from his toast, immediately riled. He can’t abide anyone raising their voice at his girl, and I get that, I really do, but I was just so furious. “They’re just idiots, peddling bollocks,” I continued, finding your eyes. I could see such concern in them, Draco, but I was so livid on your behalf. “They haven’t got a single bloody clue about who I am - who we are - or what we’ve found in each other.”
You really are serious, aren’t you, about helping me master my wandless, non-verbal skills, and I love it. I genuinely do. I adore it. Nobody in my life has ever wanted just to teach me something simply because they cared about me. It was always for some greater purpose, or because it would aid them in some way. Maybe, if I practiced for about a hundred years, I might one day be as good at Occlumency as you are. Stranger things have happened in my short life.
We here at The Quibbler do not believe that Harry and Draco’s love affair is false, and we call upon our readers to think the same. We call on every reader to believe in the magic and potential of romance. Harry Potter is our hero. In the words of Harry Potter, Draco makes him the happiest he has ‘ever been.
“I’m sorry mate,” I gasped out, actually feeling rather guilty at the scene I was making, “I don’t know what happened! I was going for the Leg-Locker Curse, but I think I might have cast an Entrail-Expelling spell instead, and-”
“Actually Luna, I agree with Malfoy. I feel as though in this castle with everything unknown it would actually be safer for me to stay with or close to someone who has the power to stop something from happening to me. Not saying I feel safe with him, just that I would feel less safe away from him.” He felt himself heat at the last sentence, when Draco stared at him with wide eyes. Luna gave him an odd look, but nodded.
“You boy, come with me.” The Queen ordered. Harry scurried after her, followed by the other worried servants. The Queen grabbed him and tossed him to the floor in the Throne Room. He landed with a grunt. “Stand up.”
“Let’s go Luna, we have to make sure I look presentable for the ball tonight. Can’t have the Prince’s servant look too unsightly. Lest the Princesses decide they wouldn’t marry him. Though, who would?” Harry hoped his jab would hurt. He didn’t stick around to watch Draco’s reaction, he grabbed his bag from his bedside and walked out of the room. Luna didn’t say a word as Harry willed his tears to force their way back into their ducts. He would not cry here, for that reason. He wouldn’t let Draco win.
“It does not matter if I agree with it. The choice is not mine to make. I am fifteen years old. We will be done with this subject now.” Draco took off over the hill, leaving harry alone. He’d crossed a line somewhere. How awful, no wonder Draco had been silent for part of the trip, he was being forced to choose a suitor at such a young age. Harry never could have imagined, he wondered if the Queen love the King in Draco’s family, if maybe there was a sort of bond there rather than just power. Perhaps it explains Draco’s behavior towards others, how did his family treat him?
A girl appeared in the entrance; two guards stood at her side. She stood tall, graceful, but there was a near scariness to her. Her hair hung in a ponytail to her shoulders, she had her arms crossed, and she was wearing boots rather than heels. She didn’t look like what a typical princess would look like. She was wearing thin tight pants, and a loose-fitting blouse that hung low on her breasts. She was pretty but she wasn’t the most attractive person Harry had laid eyes on.
Harry ran down the hallway with the other boy, the girl’s screams echoing through the corridor.
“This is the servant’s quarters. My name is Ron. This is where Hermione and I sleep but, since she’s training you now, it’s your room now too.” The redhead muttered to him.
“Muggles don’t belong on the inside of the walls. You must know this. I should have you killed, but Miss Granger seems to think you’d make a good servant. I can’t help but agree.” The Queen muttered. “But know this,
Harry watched as she got up, and offered him a hand. He took it and she pulled him onto his feet. She gestured to the lowering sun. “We should head back, you’ll have to be serving dinner soon. I’ll hope to see you there.” With that she skipped up the hill and back to the barn, which had been lit up with lights from the inside.
“He instigated it by existing! He acts like he’s so great, that he can do whatever he wants, and can treat whoever, however he wants,” Harry vented. Luna set her bucket down and walked up to him. She poked her finger into his face and he leaned back at the close proximity.
“So majestic, a Prince walking down a dirt road,” Harry scoffed. He smirked at Draco who glared at him. Luna turned a look of bewilderment on him.
“I see, so I’m just some monster to you then? Wouldn’t want anyone to see me with you, god forbid.” He sneered. Harry moved Hedwig toward Ulysses, and held out a stretched arm.
“I don't know, I've never heard of it but the servants have to care for themselves somehow don't they? They don't have other jobs or anything.” Draco answered, and bit his lip in thought, his brows furrowed. “Why do you ask?”
He nodded, made sense. He thanked the servant, and walked around for a little bit watching all the servants prep their ingredients. He wondered what the meal would be tonight with all the ingredients being thrown together.
Harry thought to himself.
Draco side glanced him, “What Potter? Miss me?” His voice was quieter, but the snark weighed heavy on the sentence. Harry shrugged,
“You trust too easily,” Hermione whispered, opening her eyes to look at Harry. She pulled away from Ron's embrace and turned to sit on Ron's bed. Ron sat across from her and motioned for Harry to sit as well. They had formed a triangle on Ron's bed.
“Hi, can I help you with something?” A sweet voice called from inside the barn. The doors were open, and the barn was dark inside. He couldn't see the person who spoke, but they could obviously see him.
He could practically feel Draco staring at him, but when he looked up to check, Draco had already moved farther along on the road. He took this time to watch the prince, thighs wrapped tightly around the girth of his horse, a black steed that made the alabaster pale skin stand out in the growing moonlight. Harry wondered to himself, if he could take a risk. Draco hadn’t said a word to him throughout Luna’s lesson, no quips, no sass, no bullying remarks. He double tapped Hedwig’s sides and was shocked by how she listened to him and picked up pace. He laughed to himself and trotted up to Draco.
“You know what I see?” Luna whispered. “I see a young, kind man, someone who’d do anything for anyone. You’re a hero Harry, you just don’t know it yet. You’ll grow into yourself, you were starved, and alone. You’re not alone anymore Harry, you’ve got a family again. There’s someone out there for everyone, you’ll find that person someday.” Something in his gut told him, he’d already found that person.
“You’re what?” Harry asked, still in shock from the sudden apology. Draco looked back at him and scowled.
“Some great man, that is.” He muttered to himself, and looked up at Luna who shook her head in pity. She helped him up, and began to wipe the muck off his face with her rag. He sat down on a fold-able chair.
“No, I’m sorry. I just have a lot of questions. I’m curious about you, sorry. I was from a distant village, I’ve never been around royalty.” Harry’s hair stood on end at the base of his neck, as he remembered his home. The little cottage just outside the barriers of the kingdom walls. Draco pursed his lips, but sighed.
This chapter is 9,522 words long. That's almost 24 pages.
“I got angry, and got carried away. I didn’t mean to hurt you, I used you as an outlet.” Draco’s cheeks tinted, and Harry’s eyes trailed over the blonde’s pink dusted cheeks, and a warmth settled in his stomach. He willed the heat away and cleared his throat.
“I dabble,” She spread her fingers and twirled her wrist around her head. Hermione chuckled to herself. Harry glanced over to her.
He walked down an aisle of tables showcasing matching tops and bottoms. He wondered how he’d look in blue, or maybe brown. He grabbed a shirt and noticed it was an expensive material, he didn't have the money for that. Before he set it down, he noticed a red shirt tucked underneath the one he’d picked up. He gently moved the shirt aside and picked up the red shirt, it had a golden trim along the laces. It was a long sleeved shirt, something he could perhaps wear a lighter jacket over. It didn’t seem too expensive, so he decided he could wear it tonight.

Harry heard the quiver in the Prince’s voice and he wondered if it was a lie. Harry didn’t know how to control the anger he felt, and he didn’t understand it either. He couldn’t understand how he felt so angry over a bruise on his Prince’s alabaster skin, but couldn’t even find it in himself to be angry over the broom beating Draco had given him. Someone was hurting Draco and he needed to know who it was, for his own personal sake.
Draco began looking around at the columns of clothes they had. They were set up both on columns and on tables. Trousers, pants, and other undergarments -perhaps for women- were hung but the shirts were folded nicely on tables. Like the store he visited with Luna, they were organized by size and sorted by color within the sizes.
“Um, Draco hurt you. He, um. I don’t think he meant to Harry,” Luna whispered. Ron took an angry step forward.
“You sure it’s not you who’s got that death wish mate?” Harry chuckled. Ron scowled at him, though it was playful. The ginger reached out and ruffled his hair. Harry swatted his hands away and tried to fix his already messed up hair, but to no avail. He frowned at Ron, who simply just laughed.
“I’m sorry for staring, I just... You both look so beautiful together. Also, I was admiring your dress it’s quite lovely.” Harry explained himself. A light pink settled over Draco’s face as he glanced at Astoria. Astoria beamed at the compliment.
Harry nodded, and Cedric laughed. Harry looked over at the taller boy, and Draco did as well. When Draco glared at Cedric, the boy turned around and continued on making the dinner for Harry. Draco grunted and walked out of the kitchen. Harry followed suit.
Harry chuckled and nodded. He and Ron walked out of the kitchen and turned the corner only to run into Hermione and Queen Narcissa. They both stopped and bowed.
There was no tiled art on the walls, there was no fancy tile on the floor, the ceilings had sloped downward, and there was a slight funky smell coming from the walls. It looked like the entrance to a dungeon. The guard stopped in front of a small rickety door and pushed it open.
“Of course, I’m not a monster, you know.”
“They only allow older men and women to serve them. Those that can't fight back or are easily subdued. The Malfoy's are afraid of being overtaken, so they threaten the lives of the men and turn them into soldiers for the war. If the men were to try anything against the King or Queen, their family would be killed off one by one in public.” Ron explained. Harry's mouth hung by the end of Ron's explanation.
Contrary to the dreary inner walls of the Parkinson’s Castle, the town was very lively filled with joyous music and bright colors. There were women dancing in the streets decorated in bright clothing, jewelry hanging from their wrists and necks.
~*~*~
, the cost of your life is Miss Granger’s suffering. Leave me.”
Harry felt Draco before he heard him. The thick air filled the hallway in waves, like back in the commons, during the tour. It felt as if it had a smell, a stench of fear maybe, musk. The servants were terrified of him, especially the women. Harry was new, he knew that, and he would learn.
Harry wondered how he didn’t fall off his horse, as they came to a standstill outside some trees. Luna and Draco were bickering by the time he arrived.
Speaking of which, Hermione had told him to go meet her at the stables with all of the blankets, clothes and pots to begin packing, and setting the horses up. Harry sighed, stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets and walked outside, passed the sign, and headed to the barn.
“As long as you get a good night’s sleep ‘Mione, I’m up for anything.” Ron smiled at her.
“Loony?” Draco questioned, still half asleep by the sound of it. “Wha’re you doin’ with Potter?”
“He’s never really spoken on the topic, I assume he doesn’t really care for much of anyone in that sense. Though I suppose we may see some changes over our stay. I quite like Astoria, her sister is alright, but Draco isn’t here to court her. Daphne is already spoken for. She’ll be marrying Prince Theodore Nott. You hopefully will never meet him, he’s a strange one.” Luna flipped her fingers through spools of thread that were lined up on one of the tables, matching them to the gold sewn onto Harry’s shirt.
“What?”
Twenty four and a half pages.
“You’re right, Potter. Who would want to see you naked? Such a scarred scrawny frame, not a single person would find you attractive. Though according to your preferences, you should have the pick of the litter.”
Harry sighed and handed his clothing over to the woman. Draco paid her, and Harry tucked it all into his bag. He was surprised it had fit in there but he remembered that Hermione had charmed it to grow with what he put in it. It amazed him if he were honest. Magic had never been a huge part of his life. His father had been a pureblood, but his mother was a muggle born witch, and his parents hadn’t taken too kindly towards it. Hence the reason they’d moved out to the kingdom she’d lived in. Which was the outskirts of what was now Azkaban.
“Aren’t the stories she tells beautiful?” Hermione smiled. She hugged herself in content. Harry frowned.
“What happened?” Harry asked, his voice sounded raw, his throat was dry. He coughed, and pain shot through his body as his ribs felt as if they were being crushed by his own muscle.
“Harry, as his servant you are supposed to dress him for the day.”
Her voice was soft when she answered him, and Harry had an inkling that she was still upset. He wished he could see his parents, especially his mother. Gods how he missed his mother.
“Whoa! What do I do?” Harry shouted and grabbed onto the knob of the saddle. He heard Draco chuckle from up ahead. He flushed in embarrassment, after all he was from a farm village why would he not know how to ride a horse?
“You’re so lucky. M’lady rarely ever leaves and I love traveling,” Hermione swooned as they landed on the next floor. “I will go over what is expected of you as a servant when outside of castle grounds, and Luna will act as your guide and friend while at the Parkinson’s. Prince Malfoy will be left to woo, and you two will be left to whatever it is you’ll do.”
He couldn’t imagine anyone else in the room besides them and possibly Luna, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted to imagine any other girl in the room.
“Perhaps I could ask him tonight, before the ball. Maybe he’d tell me who he has in mind,” Harry handed his clothes to the retailer woman. Luna paid her a hefty sum. The woman smiled and patted her hand. Harry knew it was Draco’s money but he didn’t like the idea of someone spending so much money on him. He’d have to figure out a way to give something back. Though, what was he supposed to give to a person who already has everything?
“Why’re you so worried about Luna?” Draco’s question was nonchalant, but Harry detected a hint of the usual protective jealousy. Harry shrugged.
~*~*~
“Do you want some?” Harry asked. Draco eyed him, and shook his head.
“Dobby!” Draco shouted. Harry furrowed his brows, what on earth was a Dobby? A small elf appeared before them.
“Oh hello Harry! Did you find the room okay?” She closed her journal, and turned to face him. She was wearing what looked to be a long sleeved blue shirt with a long maroon skirt underneath. Harry wondered for a moment if she was as fashionably challenged as he was.
“We’re about half way there now, we’ll reach there about midday tomorrow. We should eat something we prepackaged and we’ll hunt in the morning for a larger meal. Rabbit or deer or something. We need a good night’s rest, especially with our long day ahead of us tomorrow.” Luna rolled her eyes at Draco when she spoke the last sentence. Harry rose his eyebrow at her, and sat down on his makeshift bed.
Draco settled down onto the bed and laid his arms out above his head in a 90-degree angle and tucked them under his pillow. The muscles in Draco’s back and shoulders were flexed with how the muscles stretched and Harry realized the weight of this situation he was in now. God, he hadn’t admitted it to Luna but looking at the boy next to him now there was no way that if she asked him now, he’d be able to deny it.
“Why do you keep jumping around on all the subjects Potter? Have some kind of agenda I should know about?” Draco squinted at him. Harry waved his hands in apology.
“What you’re sticking up for him? Didn’t you hear about his last servant? Is that what’s going to happen to me?” Harry raged. Luna’s expression remained calm as she listened to him continue.
The small patched hut she stopped in front of was a barber shop, and Harry stood agape at it. He glanced at her because he’d just been thinking about it back at the castle. She tied both their horses to a post out front. Wondering if she’d read his mind or simply had the same idea as he did, Harry followed her into the hut.
“How are you darling?” The woman asked, squishing the cheeks of the blonde girl. She seemed so small all of a sudden. Harry was confused but watched the interaction between the two of them, wondering who the woman was.
An outrageous anger boiled in Harry’s gut.
“Probably. I’ve a lot of wishes you don’t know about, we’ve just met after all,” Harry smiled. Ron laughed as he started cleaning the plates up and away with his magic. He turned round and grinned, saying,
Camping, huh? Harry thought. He’d never been camping, he’s never ridden a horse, let alone built a campfire. What would they be sleeping on? Where would they be sleeping? Would they all be separated, or would it be split girls and boys? Now there’s a thought. Would he be sleeping alone with Draco?
“Well I watched you too. It doesn’t mean anything.” Harry side glanced to see if Draco was paying attention to their conversation. The blonde was doing something with his pack, not showing any signs of having heard them. Harry sighed in relief.
Harry was taken aback, and very confused. “Malfoy, you and I are not friends.”
Sorry for having it up late, I ended up getting the flu for two whole weeks. I’m instead going to put up a chapter a month at least, but since this whole quarantine thing is going on I’ll see if I write more.
“I thought maybe you’d like the company. You were alone.”
“So what is it?” Luna asked him. Harry’s brows furrowed.
“Just admit it, you think he’s attractive!” She exclaimed again. Harry blushed, and refused to admit it.
He walked out from behind his divider to grab his shoes and was met with a frowning Draco. Harry swallowed thickly, his eyes trailing down the body of his Prince.
“Thank you, Cedric,” Harry beamed. Cedric’s eyes widened, as did Draco’s. The two boys glanced at each other, and then watched as Harry cut into the meat.
Harry’s eyes widened when Draco pushed the door open to the servants’ commons. Every single servant in the room froze when they saw Draco enter. Some started crying; the women, the girls. The men jumped up to protect them, putting their bodies in front of them. Harry’s eyes flicked to Draco, and then at the servants.
“And that’s all it takes for Hermione to like someone really,” Ron interrupted. Hermione jumped in surprise. “Just treat the house elves kindly and she’ll take a liking to you. Even if you’re a rich princess that may end up marrying our royal asshole,” Ron chuckled. Hermione punched him in the arm and scolded him for his loudly spoken words about Draco. Harry didn’t disagree, he was just shocked that Ron had enough guts to say something like that so loudly.
Draco smiled at his cousin. “Thank you for teaching him Luna, he needs to change unless you’d like to stay.”
The inside of the barn was smaller than he originally thought it would be. There were four giant stalls, with horses in them. A chestnut, a black, a brown and a pinto, by the look of them. There was a fifth stall, filled with equipment, and a back room of supplies. Luna had disappeared somewhere, so Harry was walking through the barn.
“You’re hiding, from Lord
Harry’s heart clenched at the sounds of the pained pleas.
They stared at each other for a moment, neither of them speaking. Harry sighed and glanced around the otherwise quiet hallway. There was no way they hadn’t been heard during their quarrel. “Fine. You first.”
“What do you mean? See what?” Harry asked, he stood up, eyes blown wide, and he took a cautious step back from the blonde. Luna smiled at him, her eyes crinkled in the corners, and she took a step towards him. She leaned in and whispered,
He made so many turns in the vaulted hallways that he wasn’t sure where he even was anymore. He squeezed his eyes shut tight. He had been so lost in thought when he left the room, he hadn’t paid any attention to where he’d walked and which way he’d turned. The second he began to pity himself he saw Astoria down the hall surrounded by some of her maids. He began to walk towards them when he was suddenly stopped by a guard.
Enjoy, and as always I love reading your comments.
“I can’t spend money on such frivolous things.” He spoke, and turned away from the window. Harry frowned and followed.
Draco walked in last, and Harry couldn’t help but notice the way he was walking. He was looking at the floor, and his arms were folded in front of him, rubbing his hands. He sat down at the table across from Luna very slowly, and Harry watched as she tried to involve him in the conversation, but he refused to talk. Eventually Luna gave up, and returned to talking to Narcissa and Lucius, making them laugh at whatever it was that she was saying. Harry wasn’t focused on them, he was staring at the blonde boy, who stared at his full plate of food the entire meal, picking at it tentatively. When it was time for the boys to clean the meal, the Malfoy's and Luna stood up to leave.
She answered with pride, “They’re muggles, they work in the village. I visit them as often as I can to bring them food and clothes.” Harry admired her for not looking down on her muggle parents, but then her admission hit him. Hermione was muggle-born, and the Malfoy’s from what he could tell, were racist.
“You like that?” Draco asked him. Harry nodded. “Are you finished?” Harry nodded again, and wiped his hands on his pants. “Good. Now clean it up.”
Draco walked over to his desk and sat down. Harry noticed the chair, it was painted black, with green buttoned velvet on the seats. He watched for a moment as Draco began writing down notes. Sweat began to form in the blonde’s hair, and his foot started moving up and down. Harry looked away, figured Draco knew he was being watched.
The girl paused her chopping, and seemed to be in thought for a moment before she continued chopping. She brushed the chopped onions into a bin as she responded to him. “This castle is a stressful place to work in, we don’t get many days off to see our families. I’d received news yesterday that my father had fallen ill, but because Prince Malfoy and a few of his people were coming I wasn’t allowed to leave to see him.”
“You’re really stressed out, so I wondered if maybe you would allow me to massage you. If you’re alright with that. Only if you’re alright with it.” Harry flushed when Draco met his eyes. Draco licked his lips and seemed for a moment to be lost in thought.
The fight was over Lucius Malfoy. He’d sold Harry to the papers, again, and Draco had done nothing to stop him.
Harry cocked his head. "How do you know what book will have the answer?"
"Suppose one of you'll have to leave," she sing-songs, knowing full well that neither of them would. So that was that. And here they were, Draco with his hair still wet from when Harry fucked him under the showerhead not an hour before, now—pointedly—not meeting Harry's eye across the bar.
"Okay," Harry says instead. "No hard feelings. I'll see you around."
“Portraits won’t take up seats,” Harry says, blurry-eyed from a mere glimpse of the seating chart. It reminds him of the Marauder’s Map, with all the names scribed in tiny print. He doesn’t recognise most of them, but he spots his next to Draco’s, at the end of the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry cradles the phone against his cheek. His heart has no business beating this fast. He says, “Why don’t you see for yourself?”
Inside Harry's mind is an ocean and only an ocean. "Thought minds were all like that," Harry says, treading water and holding Draco up until he stops choking on seawater.
Harry stretched his neck long, his face turned to the sky. He felt like he was being pushed up through the dirt, his throat thick and his hair streaked sloppy over his eyes. He wondered if, finally, it was spring.
It's wrapped up in thirty, though an exec hauls Harry aside and pitches him their new Star Athletes program for another fifteen.
Harry gathers his thoughts and begins to speak, his words slow to come. "I think what Hermione has mixed up is all these plans to fix things. Don't get me wrong, I would be dead several times over if it weren't for Hermione's plans, but plans also change. The people want someone who can see things through and do what's best for everyone, no matter what. Someone who they trust will sacrifice everything to do what's right. That's definitely Hermione, but she never says it like she believes it herself. She always says she'll keep working even if she loses, but that isn't the same as saying that she won't lose. Which I know she won't."
Harry waits for her to disappear through the Floo, before going home himself.
Last night, someone came through Harry’s mind and gave it a good scrub for his own good. When I say scrub, I mean that someone took a rag to every thought and scoured off all the lovely messy colour until every last one was plain white and cast no shadow. If you lick it, it would taste exactly like an empty room.
"Merlin, what happened to you?" Hermione mutters mid-chew. "When did you stop caring?"
"What he meant by how I ‘deserve the world.’"
Harry swivelled in his chair and scowled. “It’s only two-thirty.”
Draco crossed his arms, his eyes cast down the hall. "I don't know." He floated down to the floor and wrapped his arms around his legs, resting his head on his knees and staring at the door glimmering darkly under moonlight. "Have you been in there since?"
Harry’s shift starts early so he leaves his good mornings on the mirror in pink lippy. The lippy is one that Ginny left behind; the messages are for Draco.
Draco kneads his thumb into Harry's palm. "I can?"
"Sobering potion," Malfoy says. The black has swallowed up his eyes. His breath comes out heavy and laboured, but there's steel in his voice and it has Harry opening his potions cabinet.
"You could've just owled," Harry said with an amused cock of his head.
"Okay.
"What kind of food is it?" Harry asks.
Their flat has one of those balconies that's too small to do anything except smoke or holler down at a friend. The street below is clean and well-lit day or night, the pavement fissured from Indian laurels long outgrown their concrete confines.
Harry laughs as he sits down next to Draco, taking Draco's hand into his own. "Yeah, seriously. I had no idea what to do with the house once I got rid of all the crap. Every night, I'd sleep on that bare mattress and think about you, about how you would know. You with your nice things and your posh life. But it turns out that I didn't want any of your things or my things or anything. What I wanted in my home was you. And if you were here, then I would have everything I wanted, and the rest would figure itself out."
dancing, but he's never been more one with his limbs until
“And you don’t care that they’re listening to you piss. Watching you chortle at those kneazle vids that Weasley won’t stop sending, despite my repeated requests for him to —”
"I'm happy to do it, really," Harry says. "I believe in you more than I believe in politics. And Greengrass is bloody awful. Draco's been telling me all about him. You're going to win because you are loads better than that war-profiteering cretin. I know it."
"I don't even play Quidditch anymore, and they want me doing sponsored rides on that monstrosity like I'm some sort of pro," Harry complains to Ron later that night. They're sitting at the bar of a fancy restaurant that's Dean's new baby, or so Ginny says, as she's not getting pregnant anytime soon.
Draco nudges him again. Harry shivers, his skin crackling with static. He cups Draco’s face and counts the freckles under the eyes. Then he closes his own, feeling the water expel from his ears in tiny streams of bubbles.
Draco thought about all the things that he’d almost done, but didn’t.
for @drarrymicrofic prompt: blue
Draco laughs. “You twist me up in contradictions.”
Running off to Alazambar two years after the war should've solved all of Draco's problems, but the past keeps looping back like an LED billboard, deja vu every thirty seconds and every man looking like Harry Potter until they don't.
Love, out of time and into eternity.
They both know that Harry was coked out when he hired the wrong decorator, who furnished the place like a museum of poor taste. Whatever. The point is that it looks nothing like it did before. The crown moulding was stripped away and every last house-elf head unmounted. Marble veined with gold replaced dark wood, and floorboards were swept of memories until only cleanly lit corners remained where nightmares used to lurk. Harry doesn't use the rooms enough for comfort to matter. It's only Ginny's third time over in four years—and her last if she rags on him any longer.
Draco caught Harry's hand in his. "No, I understand perfectly." He bumped his shoulder against Harry's, and let the warmth settle between their bodies. "Did you like it?"
Eltanin rolls his eyes. "Draco's not usually like this," he whispers conspiratorially to Harry. "I don't know what crawled up his arse and died, but he can suck it for all I care."
“Err,” Harry said, looking around, confused. “The radiomagnetic repulsor, which may be recognisable by some professors at Hogwarts, as—” He scowled. “Draco, your line?”
The light is dim when Harry wakes again—not dark enough to drink, but too late to do anything else. Harry is bored again, so he picks a bar at random and watches the bartenders prep while the cleaning crew mops up the last of yesterday's puke. Ron joins him for a drink at ten but begs off after an hour for "a date".
"The wallpaper goes last," Draco says. "Call Pansy at the number I gave you, and she'll help you figure out what else to get."
I found the mirror in the dungeon cell, positioned directly across the cot where Luna had slept those grimy last months of the war. Of course, I knew what it was. The Mirror of Erised is as old as magic itself, an artefact more holy than material. I didn't touch it at first, but I looked. And that was my mistake, wasn't it? Or maybe it was my saving grace. It's hard to know pleasure from pain when I cry all the same. Maybe it was both.
Harry turns back to Draco. "What do you mean?"
Harry Apparates to Draco's door and knocks. Eltanin answers, saying Draco's out, but he'll take the bouquet and leave a message if Harry tells him what to say.
Last week, I threw a pumpkin out the window. It didn’t do much. Just kind of exploded and then laid there real quiet, like it didn’t mean to do that. Not that it mattered. It was noon. Nobody was around to get pumpkin juiced or anything. I watched it rot under the sun all afternoon until Harry came strolling home and stepped around it to get inside. He hollered up, “You threw that pumpkin out?” And I said, “Yeah,” plenty loud right back down. I heard him rummaging in the closet downstairs, so it wasn’t a surprise or anything when the front door slammed again. He scrubbed that sidewalk whiter than it’d ever been. Then he came back inside and stomped upstairs to the bedroom, where I waited with my arms still dangling out the window. He walked right up to me and kissed me, and asked how my day was. “Fine,” I said. “How was yours?”
or else he was going to cry, and wasn't that embarrassing, how losing a book felt like losing an old friend.
Harry doesn't ask why Malfoy's doing this because he doesn't want Malfoy asking him either. "Because you fucking hate me" isn't something he wants to confess aloud, even if it is the truth.
"Hawaiian, I think? With some Mexican?" Ron says. He doesn't look up from the menu.
Draco’s shadow has always crept close to his steps. Some days he thinks it has a face with the jagged cliff of his father’s nose; or Fenrir’s greedy maw. A muffled clang turns his attention toward his darkness, stretching long down the empty seventh-floor corridor. Today it wears Potter’s eyes.
"No." Malfoy mentioned it once, in an off-hand comment, and Harry's Neanderthal brain apparently decided to file it away for long-term storage. Harry coughs. "No, just, err—lucky guess."
“I have this place under Fidelius, but there are ways to get around it. Once they know the proximity, they can —”
"Yes," I said in Potter's voice. "Yes. Every word."
Harry closes the door behind him and is greeted by the blissful calm of his empty house.
Harry walks beside me along a dirt trail grooved with cow hooves, clutching a coffee cup in one hand and mine in the other. It’s easy walking today, nothing like the steep inclines of a proper mountain, and we go slowly up the gentle, rolling mounds, more a ramble than a hike. I catch him blinking, his attention in the distance as though trapped in fog, and I want to ask if he’s lost in the worries of work again. But then he turns his awareness to me, the corners of his eyes crinkling and his gaze unfaltering. Like I’m the only person in this world besides him.
It would be a surprise if he told Draco to choose: tell your father to stop, or I’ll walk.
“Death Eatery.”
Hermione brings Crookshanks with her to the cafe when she breaks up with Ron. The kneazle is under disillusionment, of course—Hermione picked a Muggle part of town, far away from their flat, and she isn't
," Ginny whines, dragging him back. "Harry,
Nails dig into Harry’s arm.
"What? That's it?" Harry asks.
"It's a good deal." Ron's thick fist wraps around the stem of his wine glass. "All you have to do is roll out of bed and ride a broom for thirty minutes to make more money than my dad does in a year."
"Daffodils are a variety of narcissus. Father used to buy them for Mother's birthday every year. You didn't know?"
"Yeah, you know? Get the bloke jealous, and he'll come begging to be taken back. Classic wingman shite."
He never thinks of me, but all my thoughts are his. Breathless, some nights when my unease grows monstrous from self-doubt… his back presses into my chest but somehow remains distant, a hollow echo in the disquiet. “I couldn’t live without you,” I say. “I’ll die without you,” I promise, a long yearn. And even in that, he bested me — his death over mine, like a challenge.
“Harry?” Draco whispered.
Harry can't have that happen. "I've sobering potions," he offers instead.
"Right? Bloody suspicious that I always end up with the same one," Harry whispers back, but Ginny's already flashing a wide grin at the bartender.
He’s my father.
Written for the December Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge prompt, tradition.
"Hate it. Don’t stop." Harry’s eyes were watering. Draco braced himself and pushed in again, pleased with the stuttered gasp that escaped Harry, that he was the one who forced that gasp. Draco was a grown man now, and Harry wasn’t going to forget it after tonight. Draco was going to erase all memory of his simpering, childish days from Harry's mind. With his dick.
"Thank you for your kindness," the woman says, and Draco pockets that for later.
"Fuck, I don't know," Harry admits. It's probably good that he doesn't catch Malfoy because he can't decide if he wants to slug him or snog him.
“Portrait magic’s not supposed to work like that,” Draco says, too-fast.
Draco likes to think that it's better that Harry lied. Nobody could be anyone's entire life. But Harry had gotten close.
. There was the red one for intruders, and the yellow one for “you seem a bit agitated sir, maybe cool off before handling dangerous equipment?” and the blue one for “DANGER unclassified uncontrolled dark artefact DANGER dark artefact DANGER DARK ARTEFACT!!!!!” The blue alarm was particularly concerning, as it sealed all entrances to the lab to prevent contamination at risk of the researcher’s own life, though a quick survey of the room showed no sign of disturbance. In fact, the only signal the sensors picked up came from Potter himself, right above the left breast pocket of his coat.
"Potter here says he'll buy us a round of tequila," Malfoy says to his friends.
“I did not —” Draco shoots Pansy a look. She taps her square-tipped nails against the back of Draco’s mobile-Floo, smirking.
Harry buys a round for a stag party and coaxes his new friends back to Nylon. One of them suggests that she's never had bottle service before with a coy glance at Harry, so Harry gets them their Dom Perignon and their Cristal, and he gets a lapful of arse as thanks. The arse is tight and the mouth hot, but that isn't saying much, is it?

I left the plastic bag up even though I knew it was bad. I liked to watch it sway in the open window. A thing that couldn’t die. Not like me, who was rotten to the core.
Harry clamps down on his rising shame, but it's hard when there's a whole kitchen island of extravagant excess staring back at him like he's some sort of tyrannical king after a barbaric raid.
"Who were you with?" Ginny asks, then demands, pushing Harry down and sitting on his chest to bully him into a confession.
"Nothing. Not nothing. Merlin, I'm jealous of your fingers," Draco says. "C'mere, Harry. Come sit in my lap."
"He has to work tomorrow," Draco says, his nose held high. Why did it take Harry so many years to see how much vulnerability Draco hid behind arrogance? All Harry wanted to do at Hogwarts was punch that nose off of Draco's face.
, wait till I tell
"You're certainly taking your time," Draco says when Harry catches him watching. Draco's shirt is half-open, and the top button of his trousers is undone.
The room has no windows, no furnishings. There is no light except the single candle that melts the minutes by in drips.
God, Ron. He was a total swot to Harry at Dean's new restaurant. Like he kept having to hold his tongue back, that's how much he couldn't stand Harry.
"I'll. I'll just—" Harry really should leave, but he can see the outlines of a living room behind Eltanin's silhouette. The walls are a creamy canary yellow, the floor the kind of lamination that does a decent job pretending to be hardwood. The couch is a lumpy moss-green fabric monster strewn with tangled fleece blankets and mismatched pillows.
"Nice."
“I haven’t flown since since since since the big firestorm incident, but this whole night’s got me thinking, if I’m going to be doing things I don’t and believing things I shouldn’t, I might as well top it off with with wi”
“He gave them a photo of me! In
How can it
I snatch my wand away and tuck it in my sleeve. “None of your business.”
“Course I liked him. I don’t make a habit of chatting up guys I don’t like.”
"That's what I love about it." Harry leaned in, heavy on Draco's shoulder. "But I have a confession. I stole my copy from you."
"It's beyond me why you believe insults will convince me to do anything for you, but even if you asked nicely, I certainly wouldn’t help you stalk your latest fu—," she coughs, "
Eltanin turns up the Wireless to something loud that is more a rhythmic pulse than a melody. Harry recognises the song as the one playing when Draco got down on his knees and sucked Harry off in his shower all those weeks ago. It's stupid how much everything reminds Harry of Draco. He can't even wake up without missing Draco in the sheets with him, and then he goes and sinks himself into a sofa that smells like Draco next to a roommate that won't stop talking about all the good things Draco's ever said about Harry. Why does Harry do this to himself?
to," she wheedles. "Harry only meant to throw his drink. But you know how his magic is when he's drunk—"
No response.
"Cool," Harry says. "I mean, thanks for not caring, I guess."
And there goes another three years trying to explain broth when all you wanted to explain was salt. And it wasn’t even about the salt. It was about the sea, and the vastness of it, all that space that wasn’t salt, and all that space that wasn’t planets or stars but was just space.
“He’s not that bad honestly, you guys held a good conversation on our way here. You’ll get used to him,” Luna stood her ground on the subject.
“He’s prepared for you to place a jacket on him, that’s why he’s posed like that. You’ve hung them in the wardrobe.”
His heart was in his throat by the time they reached the gates of the castle. The gates looked menacing, almost more so than the Malfoy’s. The gates began to open as they approached. Draco sat up straight, rolled his shoulders back and pointed his chin up. The air around him changed, Harry felt it shift and it reminded him of how Draco acted at home.
Draco watched him eat with his bare hands and nodded to Cedric, who returned a few moments later with a fork and knife. He handed the fork and knife to Harry.
Hermione nodded her head in response against his shoulder. Harry rushed to grab a shirt, and a blanket from Hermione’s bed. He ran over to Ron and handed him what he’d asked for. Ron gave the blanket to Hermione, and she sniffled as she removed her shirt, and crawled further into Ron’s lap to hide. Harry noticed Ron’s cheeks tint slightly, as Hermione pressed into him. She brought the blanket up to cover her front and held it there tightly with her arms.
“I don’t have to explain myself to you. I wanted to leave them, as I don’t want to be involved with everything dating a woman entails. I came out here to relax, so if you’re going to pressure me to tell you more, I’d have to ask you to leave me here. I’ll walk with Potter. Go de-stress somewhere else Luna.” Draco ordered her. She stood in front of him for only a moment, before glancing over her shoulder at Harry. He said nothing to her, and she sniffed.
The Prince had wide eyes, and Harry wrapped his arms around himself to hide his figure. “Sorry.” Harry apologized, looking at the floor. Draco cleared his throat, causing Harry to look back up at him.
Draco chuckled, “Can’t hate it too much, you’ve hurt me.”
~*~*~
Harry about dropped his broom, as the boy passed through the light shining through the windows. The green light hit the boy’s blonde hair, as the red and yellows and blues passed over his thin frame. He was in a dark suit, walking towards the throne room. The boy turned to look at him, their eyes met, and for a split second Harry found him to be the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. The boy turned his gaze back to the Throne room, as he walked into it.
Sorry this is out so late, I got set back by finals and then got swamped at work. Hopefully the next chapter won't take so long to get out. A thousand apologies, I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Draco inhaled and a deep flush began at the base of his neck, as he gripped Harry’s hand back for a second and then let go. The offer of comfort had been acknowledged and that was all Harry needed in order to remove his hand and smile in the Prince’s direction. ‘You can do this. It’s alright.’ Harry projected to him in his mind.
Draco stiffened, he was silent for so long Harry wondered if the blonde even heard him. Maybe he was just being ignored.
“What fairy tale do you live in Potter? I must find a good pure rich woman to take over the kingdom with me as my Queen. It is not about love, it is about finding a powerful suitor to hold power over a kingdom. It is about respect, it is purely business.” Draco snarled at him, with a not-so-hidden scoff.
“You got a death wish I don’t know about?” Ron’s voice cracked, and he cleared his throat. Harry shrugged.
“Ah yes, I think I look rather good as well, thank you. I see you’re still doing the work of servants, Astoria.” Draco preened under the praise.
Harry carefully removed himself from his position atop Draco’s back, and stood up. Draco didn’t move, he just laid shaking on the bed. Harry searches the chest near the bed and brought out a blanket and draped it over the Prince’s revealed skin. He slipped on his shoes, and walked with soundless footsteps towards the door. He cast one last glance at the Prince and left the room.
There was a rustling in the grass behind them, and he watched as Luna’s eyes smiled. He turned around to see Draco walking towards them. Harry felt his heart quicken, how long had it been?
Hermione chuckled, but pushed past him. She knocked at Draco’s door. When she received no answer she stood close to the door, her hands on her waist.
“What, Harry Potter, did you think you were doing?” Luna’s voice rattled in her throat. Her eyes flared with something Harry hadn’t seen before.
Harry’s face heated at the inquiry. He wasn’t sure how he'd handle the responsibility of dressing his Prince. He could hardly dress himself most days. He heard a rustling behind the drawing and began to feel awkward, despite not being able to see her.
Draco pulled the covers up over his head as the two continued their conversation. Harry felt strange, the royal prat hadn’t said anything to either of them, though he’d most definitely heard them. Harry left the subject be, and laid down in his bed. Draco was turned away from him, facing away from the fire, and Harry had the strangest urge to apologize.
“I was sleeping next to him. That’s all. My mother used to sleep next to me when I had bad dreams. So I thought I could help him because I couldn’t take it, hearing him cry like that.” He left out the details of him touching Draco, and soothing him, and brushing away his tears.
“Luna!” He whispered, shouting. He looked over to Draco, who stirred in his sleep. Luna dragged him back to his cot and threw him onto the bed before closing the bamboo divider behind her.
He decided to go looking for Luna, and figured she’d help him decide what’s best for him to buy and wear, or what not to buy. He figured she could also help him find some casual clothes so he could get rid of the ragged clothes he’d been wearing for half his life. Perhaps he’d actually attract some attention as he’d be wearing something fit for a normal person, let alone a common servant.
Harry turned back to walk into Draco’s room when he saw the girl out the window again. She was riding one of the horses, a black one. It’s mane was long from what Harry saw of it. The girl was wearing blue, and her blonde hair flew freely behind her as the horse galloped through the fields. He watched her go, before walking back into Draco’s room to clean the armor.
“You needn’t listen to Robards,” you said after we ate our breakfast in silence for a while. “All this nonsense… He’s no better than the bloody Prophet headlines, darling, not one iota. Only that the prick tries to threaten and intimidate us rather than to make Galleons on gossip. Our finances, our home – it’s nobody’s business, especially not Robards’.”
“Why yes I have, he’s rather nice, if not a bit strange. Though, some could say I’m rather strange.” Harry watched her walk behind a bamboo drawing, and he couldn’t see her anymore. “I’m going to change into something appropriate for dinner. When I’m done I’ll show you how you’ll need to dress Draco. You haven’t yet, have you?”
“I said, clean it up.” Draco demanded, shoving Harry down on his knees. Harry began to pick up the pieces carefully, as not to cut himself. “Come on, Potter. We don’t have all day.”
They cleaned the rest in silence, only speaking to give thanks to Cedric from Luna. The silence was comfortable as they walked into the common room. Harry heard a humming in the distance, signalling to him that Hermione as awake. Ron knocked gently on their closed door, and she opened it. She had cleaned the room, and organized all of the books into neater stacks and washed every single item of clothing.
“’Mione!” He shrieked. Hermione collapsed in Ron’s arms, her shirt cut open from the back and dangling from her shoulders. Ron pulled her into his chest so neither he nor Harry could see her nakedness. “Harry, go to Hermione’s bed, it’s the one next to mine. Grab a shirt, and a blanket. ‘Mione, Harry’s going to hand you a blanket, okay? I want you to cover your front with it, okay?”
Draco sat up slowly, Harry could tell his body was stiff by the way he moved. Draco winced as he sat up fully, looking sleepily around the room until his eyes landed on Harry. He scowled. Harry smiled warmly at him, and picked up the plate, and handed it to the blonde boy. Draco blushed slightly and tsked. Harry's eyes widened a fraction, and he looked away.
“Some people look brilliant enough without having to flaunt their wealth, perhaps I don’t have to try as hard to look beautiful as you do,” Draco taunted. Harry snorted, but took a drink. Draco preened under Harry’s laughter.
“I have a spell on him,” She whispered. Harry’s eyes widened. “He’s had bad dreams for a while now, and I cast a spell in order to track his sleep. So when it was abnormally quiet, the spell alerted me that something had changed. That's why I came into the room to check on him, and I found you in bed with him. So I ask you again, Harry, what did you do to him?”
It was quiet, peaceful even. The sun was dipping below the horizon, and the bugs were beginning to sing. The air was warm still, and thick. It filled Harry's lungs and coated them with the musky scent of horse manure and freshly cut hay.
“I’m Prince Malfoy’s new servant.” Harry sighed. Luna’s interest seemed to peak, and she led him outside to the outer barn area. She had asked him what he thought of Draco, so Harry let her have his opinion. “He’s a piece of work, a selfish prick and annoying bastard. He lied to me, messed with my head. Some king he’s gonna make some day!” Harry shouted. Luna stopped walking and turned to look at Harry. She made sure to make eye contact as she spoke her next few words.
“She has a bamboo sheet and I was turned away from her.” Harry admitted, he’d rather tell the truth than get caught in a lie. “I can assure you, again, that I’m not interested in her that way Malfoy. In any way actually, not more than a friend.”
Cedric rose a brow over his shoulder, before turning and smiling at Hermione. “Breakfast’s ready!”
“Maybe it’ll teach you not to spread stupid shit, Thomas.” Draco’s voice was dark. A shiver ran down Harry’s spine at the tone Draco used. He looked back over to Harry who was watching them all, and growled, “Don’t listen to him, he’s a git.”
“Hope you last longer than his last one. Draco likes to have fun with his servants,” Dean wiggled his eyebrows at Harry, and he felt heat rise to his cheeks. Draco walked over to Dean and clocked him one, right in the jaw. Dean flew to the ground from the impact. He grunted, and spat out some blood.
“No, sir.” Harry felt guilt settle into his system, he hated talking bad on people behind their back, no matter who they were. Draco pointed his sword at Harry’s face. Harry’s eyes widened at the tip.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry climbed off Ron’s bed and into his own. It was much better than the clay and straw bed of his home, but he missed the smell of his mom’s perfume in the pillows. He wouldn’t be able to smell her perfume anymore.
“I can leave you to be on your own then if you’d like,” Harry offered. He hoped that maybe he could stay next to the Prince. There was a calm surrounding them, perhaps because on the backs of their horses they were on equal ground. Away from prying ears and judgement, it was peaceful and calm. Luna was talking to her horse in the background, and Harry smiled at the image.
Harry’s heart sank into his stomach as he heard the anger and fear in her voice. Ron touched Hermione’s arm gently, and she looked up at him. She smiled sadly, and turned away from the boys. Harry looked at the closed door behind him. His eyes widened as Draco walked out of the room, slamming the doors open. He smirked at Harry, and walked past them down the hall. Harry’s heart seized as Hermione gripped his arm.
So Draco had been having dreams for years. Harry wondered if Draco’s mind had been plagued by some bout of misfortune, or perhaps had witnessed something in another kingdom that appeared to him in his dreams.
Luna appeared next to their side and pointed off into the distance, Harry could see through the trees a giant dark grey castle just before the sky met the land. It was close, and Harry could feel the anxiety rolling off of Draco in waves. Harry took a breath and reached his hand out to Draco’s. The blonde flinched, and looked at Harry with wide eyes. Harry ran his fingers across the Prince’s knuckles and gripped lightly. He wanted to comfort Draco, no matter what. Although the Prince could be a royal asshat, he didn’t deserve this. Nobody deserved this.
“Why were you seeking shelter in the castle Harry?” She turned her body towards him, her back to Ron. Ron pulled her blanket softly around her back, making sure it didn’t snag on the blankets.
Flirty boys.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry ran a hand through his messy morning hair. Draco hadn’t poured water on the fire yet, to  cook the meal, so Harry finished packing. He decided to go wander looking for more kindling.
“Malfoy will be left to what?” Harry asked, sure he’d misheard her.
“No, you haven’t met them yet. I believe you might sometime in the future. They are part of a royal family that doesn't get along too well with Draco’s,” Luna explains. She blushes and looks off into the distance. Harry noticed she didn’t specify which gender, but he didn’t want to push it any further, just in case she was worried about her crush being outed to the general public. If they didn’t get along well with Draco’s family, they probably didn't get along well with the Parkinson's either. So it was probably smart to keep their identity as secret as possible.
“Want to make it a race Lovegood?” Draco called from the other side of Harry. Harry whipped his head the his left and made eye contact with the Prince. There was a brightness there that Harry had never seen before. Luna, on his right whistled and her horse took off ahead of them both. Harry laughed in amazement at her speed.
Harry was appalled, Draco didn’t do anything towards Dean, just laughed at him. Harry’s eyes flicked between the two, wondering if Draco was going to do something. He’d beaten Ron and Hermione just an hour before, for crying when Harry was given to Draco. Draco turned to look at Harry, there was a bit of amusement in his eyes, and Harry realized he knew these boys pretty well.
“They are, some people set up shop when important groups come into the village because they could possibly sell more items. It’s a rather smart thing for them to do, since they've already made something off of us,” He answered. Harry wondered how many times Draco made the effort to come out and see Pansy. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know, he didn’t want to be dragged out with him every time.
“Hello Harry, I need to have a word with Prince Malfoy,” She spoke sweetly to him. He looked back at the door and heard quiet shuffling.
“Goodnight Harry," Hermione whispered as she turned off the few lanterns that were lit and crawled into her own bed. The last lantern, the one by Harry's bed flickered lightly. Feeling the warmth on his lips, Harry leaned in close and blew the flame out.
