“And a very good day to you, gorgeous. Last night, I forgot to give you this.” He handed Draco a fifty pounds tip. The man would make Draco feel dirty for taking it. It didn’t help that dear ol’ Jeffery would practically eyefuck him as he accepted the money.  He left, sneering at him, and once he was gone, Draco shuddered in disgust.
He didn’t know how long he ran, but he realized he was panting when he stopped to breathe. Covered in sweat, blood, and tears, Draco looked around with an overwhelming sensation of relief when he realized where he was. The feeling stayed and became a bit stronger when he knocked on Harry’s door. His friend opened the door and his face dropped with worry. Everything was a blur and time went by, but he finally got the familiar feeling whenever he was around Harry.
Harry laughed. As Draco left to attend to a customer who’d just entered, he missed the glint of promise and desire in Harry’s eyes.
Draco’s head sprang up so quickly, he was pretty sure he gave himself whiplash. “Harry, If you get this I will love you forever.”
“I’m sorry,” he cried out. “It’s just that Jeffery made me stay for a while to sign up as manager, and then he tried to...” Draco stopped as he continued to cry. Harry just hugged him tighter.
A man with soft-looking skin, expressive eyes that showed three emotions at once, something that he had never seen before. The man’s warm hand briefly touched Harry’s face. He’s surprised that he wants more of the touch. More of this strange man.
He pulled him into a  sloppy kiss against Draco’s neck, fortunately losing his iron grip.  Draco kicked Jeffery away from him with a final push of newfound strength before throwing a still-hot coffee in his face. The man howled and started to scream at Draco with so much fury.
Lips curled in disgust, Harry gave the unconscious Jeffery a hard punt to the bollocks but stopped at kicking his face in.
A loud crash made the two men’s eyes widen. As they left the room, he saw a pissed-off-looking Jeffery. The crazed man locked his eyes on Draco before charging at him at full speed. Luckily, before he reached him, Harry stepped between them.
Draco rolled his eyes He knew that finding unconscious drunks wasn’t uncommon in this town--it was pretty much one of the daily sights the neighborhood had. He knew that his mom would have yelled at him for leaving the defenseless man out in a dark alley so, with all the strength that he had, he lifted (more liked pulled) the man to his car.
Harry realized that the Wizarding World only cared about him as their Savior. He was sick of being him, sick of having a legacy that left him with a lifetime of trauma and pain. He was so tired of being treated like he was some sort of god to those who just worshipped him because of a story. Sick of being Harry Potter.
“Draco? What are you doing here? Are you okay?!” His darling shook his head before leaning in to hug Harry.
Nightmares suck. Draco wanted to dream about anything but that night. He couldn’t stand being alone and was grateful Harry allowed him to stay at his home. Despite his first (not that Harry knew) meeting in the messy, dark home, Draco learned to love it. It meant protection. Warmth.
“Damn. What did that book do to you?” Draco looked up, and let out a moan of defeat when Harry appeared.
His eyes felt droopy all of a sudden and he knew that he was going to fall asleep soon. He wrote a small note and put it in the drunk man’s eyesight, and sat on a small loveseat. Closing his eyes, he let the sleep take over. As he fell into a deep slumber a pair of green eyes opened across from him. The man smirked, almost pleased.
The cafe was closed, as Jeffery announced that he sustained injuries that required total bed rest. Draco didn't care. He quit the next day while his boss promised revenge. Harry made Draco block the number, but it meant that he’d lost a good job. A job that helped him with his college expenses, rent, and life.
Draco’s life couldn’t get shittier. Seriously, his life sucked. He thought his last shift was as bad as it gets but apparently, he was wrong. Very, very, very
His stupid father decided that he’ll rather say he has a dead son than a gay one. Meaning that when Draco went to college, he no longer had accessed to the money he needed to pay for student loans. So that’s how he ended up in Jeffery’s stupid presence. Draco didnt know why but even here all disaster, that piece of shit still managed to fuck up his life even more.
He remained quiet as they drove, this sweet naive dove making sure a stranger returned safely to the comfort of his home. The dove carefully lays him on his couch. Little dove, so warm, and kind. His skin screaming to be marked up.
In the end, he abandoned his promise. In a moment of desperation, of needing the memories to stop, he goes into the middle of nowhere.
On his way to work, the feeling seemed to stalk his every move. The feeling of nausea kept appearing. He tried to calm his nerves on the walk to the small cafe. He had to stifle a disappointed moan when he noticed that one of the cafe’s creepy owners was working behind the counter that morning. As the man looked up and noticed Draco, his smile turned perverted and his eyes were predatory. Draco shuttered, but he knew that he had to deal with the unwanted advances. The pay was decent and creepy Jeffery would always give him the most tips. Forcing a smile on his face, he put on his “blonde barbie” persona. Apparently, the pervert has a thing for bimbos who giggle at everything.
, and decided to have a coffee with caramel. It was still pretty early, so she decided to enjoy the morning before getting Harry. She figured she would take her nephew to the bank to get his muggle money converted to knuts, sickles, and galleons, plus whatever Lily and James had left him.
"Yeah, I don't know who from though." Harry handed the slightly singed letter to his aunt, surprised it wasn't warm from the fire. Did Rose use this fireplace to Floo?
maybe she'd go straight for the Ministry and file custody, both magical and Muggle. Rose was quickly turning into a woman scorned, an
The train docked at King's Cross and Harry bid his housemates a good break as he gathered his things and stepped onto the platform. There were a lot of families waiting for their children and siblings, so Harry had to duck his head and maneuver so no one would recognize him and want to talk. Soon enough he saw Rose, clad in black clothes and a shimmering purple cloak hanging down her back, ending at her calves. Her hair looked mostly tame and there was one braid on her right shoulder, and she was smiling down at him. "Hey, Muffin. Ready to go?"
"Your father's." She looked up at him with a weird look in her eye, like she was afraid and angry and weary all at once. "And Dumbledore's."
you're being very rude. My aunt was a Slytherin and she's a teacher at Hogwarts." He flicked his hair to cover his scar more, an act only Draco noticed.
She'd smiled at him and wished him a happy Christmas and Yule, of course. And it had made Harry's heart tight with many conflicting emotions, but he eventually decided that he was happy. But now they stared at the mystery package together.
Harry did so, hovering his right hand over the rack as Rose handed his wand back to him. Nothing really reacted to his magic until the very last piece, which was colored a light yellow-grey. "Oak." Mordre nodded and plucked it from the case, then waved her hand again to produce three different bowls of jewels. "Put your hand in and choose the one that reacts to you." Harry dipped his hand into the first bowl, in which several of the gems stung and burned him and he suppressed the urge to hiss. He managed to close his fingers around one and pulled it out, procuring a clear green gem. Mordre gingerly removed it from his hand with a mutter of, "Prasiolite." The second bowl had no painful burning sensations, but it was hard to get a grip on a gem. Eventually he clasped his hand around one and brought it back out, revealing a teal piece of crystal tinged with brown. "Zircon," the owner nodded and took it from him. The last bowl was the easiest to sift through, and he pulled out a piece of tourmaline that had clear stripes of blue, green, and pink. "Elbaite Tourmaline."
"A wizard, o'course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good 'un, I'd say, once you've been trained up a bit. With a mum and dad like yours, and Rose over here, what else would ya be? And I reckon it's about time you read your letter."
The Feast that was planned for dinner wafted the enticing smell of pumpkin and turkey all throughout the castle, and the students arrived with loud stomachs. Harry sat himself close to the staff table along with Draco and Blaise, Theo a little closer to the doors, and waited with bated breath for the entire hall to fill and the food to appear. When it did, the smells made nearly everyone's mouths water, even the teachers. Rose was seen tearing into a piece of honey-baked turkey and potatoes and pumpkin pie along with many others. She soon stood, wiping off her mouth with nary a smear of her lipstick, and Severus followed suit to gather Harry and perform the ritual in the Come and Go room, which would have all they need. Harry shoved the last piece of his pie in his mouth and made to follow them.
It wasn't until the students were well into their potions, at a point for crucial attention and stirring, that Rose stood from her chair and popped her back before skirting around the tables. Some cauldrons were the correct consistency, but some were too bubbly and others more solid. Hermione was doing brilliantly, though Rose worried around her hair getting in her potion.
Just then, Quirrell gingerly stepped out from the office. "A-and even s-superstitious f-folk use c-c-crystals f-for their b-beliefs," he stuttered out. Rose's grip on her wand minutely tightened.
The man held a face of obvious joy and delight. He tried to stand still but he was still bouncing up and down in place. "Harry Potter has returned! I overheard your name and thought I would let you know, so I've been looking all over Diagon Alley to tell you!"
. Rose walked briskly to her room and promptly jumped onto her bed when she entered her quarters. She tidied her vanity and summoned a binder full of her notes; she separated her papers into piles, working until she was burning the midnight oil, so to speak. She'd return the cloak tomorrow.
When Harry entered the common room that Saturday, he was surprised to see a note on the teachers' board saying Rose was out for the day. When they had talked last night after dinner, Rose assured him that they could meet at some point to discuss a piece of reading Harry had had trouble with. So he hummed to himself and went back to the dorm room he shared with Draco, Blaise and Theodore Nott to relax a bit before going to breakfast.
"No?" he replied, unsure. He didn't have a favorite tea; he'd only been drinking it regularly for a few months.
Rose let out another sob. Not only was Lily dead, but her horrid excuse for a sister and her family would be raising Harry as their own. “But I’m a far more suitable guardian than Petunia!” As she fumed, Dumbledore simply looked out the window, trying to make the best of what had happened. Rose sighed. “Let me pack my bags.”
Rose smirked at him. "As long as you're in my house, the Ministry will be none the wiser. Or, if you're still feeling uncomfortable, I can get you another wand to use just outside of school. It won't be at Olivander's, so it won't have the minor trace on it. Just say the word, okay Muffin?" Harry's frown melted again and he nodded, feeling slightly better. Though Rose was saying she would buy even
It was as if Rose had bought all the pens in the store, perhaps owl-ordered more, and Shrunk them to fit into the box so overflowing it was. Snape had jerked back when he opened the box, no doubt thinking the same and wishing to avoid the inevitable explosion of Unshrunk goods, but then he leaned forward once again and gave Rose a half-hearted glare.
Rose looked at Harry, at his pale, zig-zag scar that looked eerily like the movement one would use to cast the Killing Curse; not that she would ever admit to Dumbledore, the Light enthusiast, that she knew of such curses. Her chest tightened as the thought of the night Lily and James died.
Harry blushed, then asked for a few other things to keep. Rose chuckled. "I'll give you anything you want to keep, Harry." He nodded, looking down again. The train was pulling up. "Would you like me to go with you?" A moment passed, the Harry nodded again. He liked Rose, much more so than Aunt Petunia.
Now, all Draco needed to figure out is where to get a job that paid well.  His rent, student loan, and other necessities were starting to come near, and he had to find a job before the payments came.
Through the cloud of trash, where he usually wallows after a night of chasing away memories with the dripping liquid of happiness, he hears something new. Something warm, and soft with...a hint of annoyance.
Harry was shaking. In anger. In excitement. In happiness. Mostly because now he had an extra reason to kill Jeffery. A reason to slaughter him. A reason to show no mercy.
They make him promise that he’ll find another way to help ease his mind, a way that won’t make him look unhinged and out of control to the public.
He sees it every day and every night. Whenever he closes his eyes, Harry sees death. He could still hear the sobs of agony, it dripping like hot wax into his ears. The taste of fresh blood always lingering in his mouth. The hate was still fresh, too and he yearned for vengeance. No matter what he did, the feeling was always there.
Warning there is attempted sexual assault(not between Harry and Draco) and torture/death in this chapter.
Harry smiled widely at him, “Seriously, it’s no problem.  I know how stressful that class is, and the last thing I want is you collapsing in exhaustion.”
And what a show it was. Two hours after he hacked Jeffery’s account, dozens of comments promised to murder the man.
Waiting was a bitch. But people were right when they say slow and steady wins the race. After going to the cafe for the first time, he managed to catch Draco’s attention. Then he went in every evening, as his dove took his college classes in the mornings. When he heard the blond complaining about his philosophy class, he found the teacher and took what he wanted. The next day, he gave Draco the information he needed for the class. The conversation was boring, and his dove wouldn’t need this in the future, but the squeal and hug of happiness ere worth stalking an innocent stranger and getting into her office. His plan was going on perfectly.
“Draco? Are you okay?” He feigned concern since it was clear that the interaction and the exposure had shocked his poor sweetheart. Harry gave him a comforting squeeze. His dove looked around the cafe, his voice still shaky. Draco gave him a small smile before whispering silently, “I guess I was lucky that asshole just said creepy shit to me. And that I managed to get away before he hurt me.”
Laying on his bed, his mind kept on flashing to the drunken, handsome man. Draco didn't know why but he had a strange urge to go to the man. The urge was weird and intense, the man’s face consuming his mind. Even though it was still early, sleep overtook his body. The man’s image in his mind and the strange sensation in his body kept getting stronger and stronger.
“Oh yeah, you’re in Mr. Franks’ class, right? You guys are learning about logic, correct?” Harry asked. All Draco could do was nod sadly.
party, where people demand a story that is just filled with blood. Where his friends just smile and don't notice that he’s screaming on the inside.
He waited for two weeks. 14 Days. 336 Hours. 1,209,600 seconds. During that time, he devised a plan. A plan that would hopefully make Draco Malfoy
He just wanted a break, a break from that life. He wanted a break from the pity glances, the pressure, and the anger. He resented being pushed into a wedding that he didn't even want in the first place. He loved Ginny, but he could live without her constant praise. The girl seemed to be just as attached to the legacy he hated as everyone else. He hated it with all his might.
So what if he gets rid of their first meeting? His dove seemed to be scared of his magical home, and that would not do at all. He wants to keep his dove.
One of the many perks of being a wizard in a muggle area was that he would always have the upper hand.  Plus, the small town barely had a local Ministry if something were to happen. Harry smiled as he found the man’s flat and magicked his way inside. Entering as quickly as he could, Jeffery barely reacted before Harry spelled him unconscious.
A picture of a distressed-looking Harry having a pot of what looked like burned pasta. He laughed, receiving dirty looks from other students. Letting out an apologetic expression, the phone dinged again, but this time from his teammate who actually put effort.
close to dropping out of school and trying my hand at becoming a sugar baby.” Ignoring the sputtering from his new friend, he let out another sigh. Philosophy could die a slow and painful death.
Currently, he was at his college library, finishing another stupid paper. Especially because his other teammates apparently think they don't have to do jackshit. Grumbling, he took a deep breath before deciding he should take a break.  A small ping alerted him and he smiled at the message. Harry was pretty bad at cooking, and during the time where Draco stayed at his friend’s house, taught him a few things.
Not when he reads another story that casts Remus and Sirius as nothing more than a werewolf and a prisoner.
So he drank, bought a house, converted all his galleons to muggle money, drank and drank some more. Since all he had were the bottles in his hands, his reputation is now that of a drunk. Harry doesn’t mind, a bad reputation is better than whatever he had before.
It didn’t. In fact, it got even more intense. Crying out a bit, he shaky grabbed his phone and typed into his and Harry's conversation. Later he would be embarrassed for his desperation, but currently, Draco didn’t care less.
Draco smiled to himself, despite him having to work late at the cafe. Today was a good day; no rude customers, many tips, and then Harry. He had no idea why the cafe was open until 11 pm since no one ever came. Plus, if people ever did come, they were usually drunk or high and ended up sleeping, puking, or attempting to steal stuff. It was very annoying.
He continued, “If anything, me killing you would be a blessing. I mean, no one will ever hire you again now that your dirty little secret is exposed. It cost you everything, but I don’t think prison will teach you.”
Once again closing his eyes, he missed the sinister glint and proud smirk floating on the man’s face.
“Really? REALLY?!” He screamed at nobody. The stupid man just snored and buried his head further to the sofa. Taking a deep breath, Draco looked around the home. He noticed the kitchen was very disgusting. There were fucking flies surrounding the clutter of dirty dishes, the trash was overflowing, and a weird stench hung around it all.
Fate seemed to be in his favor as one night, a series of knocks flooded his ears. Harry opened the door showing a sobbing Draco Malfoy.
Draco learned that the man’s name was Harry Potter. Harry Potter liked sweet desserts. Harry Potter liked coffee when it was hot, tea when it was warm, and hot chocolate when it rained. Harry Potter would buy cookies for small kids, smiling wide when they beamed a toothless smile back at him.
“I would say ‘good evening’, but it looks like that’ll be a wrong thing to say.” Turning to the side, his eyes widened when he realized who exactly had come in.
This meant that the sight of a blond man slamming a notebook against his forehead didn’t seem so weird.
“You know. I was only going to run you out of town. I made your life pretty shitty. From making you lose your job at the cafe, making your landlord kick you out, as well as making your reputation utter shit. Yet, you are still left standing.” Harry moved closer to his prey in the chair. “You are one tough cookie to crack. Unfortunately for you, I’ve destroyed tougher things than you.”
Luckily Harry was there when the most persistent ones didn't leave him alone.  Somehow those people seemed to be hypnotized to leave him alone. Overall Draco was just tired of being reminded of what happened to him. He wished that the nightmares, the people and the stupid man who caused all this would just disappear.
He had to put protective charms over their graves after the report was released. And he had to spend a night in jail after punching the guy’s face in.
His eyes were gleaming in anticipation. The naked bastard was screaming behind his gag. Muffled curse words were all he could understand. The dark-haired man just smiled even more. His smile must have been terrifying, as Jeffery started to scream even harder.
If you ignored the smell of desperation, he was very handsome. He was well-groomed: his skin was smooth and clear, and his curly hair was cropped into an expensive-looking style
It was weird.  He didn’t know how to explain it, but he always felt strange.  Ever since he left that drunk into his home, the pressure seemed to always be there. So far, he’d felt the same sensation for two weeks. His dreams weren't any better, but at least he couldn’t remember them, no matter how much he tried. Nevertheless, the dreams left him satisfied in a way. Made him crave something. Made him crave
Harry went over to her and cast a cleaning charm on his hands. She looked up at him and then started laughing.
Right ok I actually proof read this one but that doesn't mean that it makes sense. It is when everything is found out and it's all very anticlimactic. And all that jazz.
“Body?” Hermione squeaked, looking at Ron for an explanation. Ron cleared his throat and dictated to them all that he knew about the case. They sat in silence for a small amount of time.
So they carried on walking to the flat in silence, fingertips slightly interlocked for both of their comfort. They got in, took respective showers and both collapsed onto the sofa, Harry his head on Draco’s lap, Draco’s fingers in his hair, twisting the dark strands carefully. It wasn’t long before Harry was asleep, his face relaxed and flushed from the warmth of the fire.Draco sat there and watched Harry breathe slowly, in and out for a while, time becoming something irrelevant as the night got darker and tiredness pulled at his eyelids. He slowly drifted away, his hands still in Harry’s hair.
Draco looked at him. “No.” He replied. “He wants us to stay here and check the public records of apparations and floos to the schools.”
Ok. So. Things are going to start happening. I promise. I have BIG plans. But I hope you like it and as usual, feel free to comment.
“Fuck! We are never going to be able to do this!” They were running out of theories, each getting more and more wild and based on flimsy evidence. Draco was slowly loosing hope and it was showing. A lot.
“It’s ok, It’s ok, nothing happened.” Harry said, rubbing Draco’s side, still holding him up. “It was just a dream.”
He started off with a brisk march but gave in to a run about half way. He could feel that something was wrong. Ignoring all the strange looks he was getting, he jogged through the labyrinth of corridors. He got to the white door, panting and knocked, trying not to let the panic be audible in the thumps. He waited and listened.
“Wait, what day is it?” Draco asked, putting an arm around Harry. He was met with silence as they all looked at each other to confirm that no one knew. Hermione took out her phone and gasped.
Blaise came in through the fireplace once his meeting with Head Aurour finished. It was dark thanks to the short winter days and he found the flat light and welcoming. And silent.
“Enough.” Draco expelled. Harry took this moment to grab his fingers and link them together. Draco looked at him in the eyes, breathing heavily. He swallowed.
He walked hastily with his IAmOnUrgentAurorBusinessDefinatlyNotLookingForSomeoneToTellThemThatThierFuckedUpDadIsVeryVeryVeryDeadAndBegForForgiveness.
She sighed. Harry took that as a yes.  He pulled himself together and walked to the potions department to find Draco.
They was a chorus of agreement from the living room, where everyone was placing mounds of presents into a pile near the window. Hermione was sticking up lights on the mantlepeace, fixing them with an occasional charm and Rose was in Pansy’s arms, who was swaying softly in time to some music playing on a record player in the corner that someone had brought. Blase and Ron were fixing bedding together - they were laying sheets and blankets everywhere.
“Just in case my father has more Latin knowledge than my books.” Draco said as he fluttered around the room putting presents in a bag.
Ron cleared his throat again. “They didn’t use magic.” The buzz picked up again. No magic? Holy Shit. This is bad, no trace Harry thought. And they got away.
Harry shook the wand away from his chest and handed it to a raw hand behind him. He felt his own wand in his pocket, feeling reassured by its presence so he looked up at Draco and nodded. The blond reluctantly took the wand away from the man’s temple, his brow furrowed in concern.
“I had a boyfriend for about two weeks in primary school but then he called me fat so I punched him.” She was in deep thought.  “Anyway, I find other amusements now.” She said breaking her thoughts with a devilish grin. “Have a good day Sir.”
“If something ever happened to you. Ever. I… I don’t know what I’d do.” He said to Draco, looking at him. Draco smiled softly at him - a smile that is reserved for special occasions.
“Ron’s intake of anything with taste just washes over me now. I remember Hermione commenting constantly at the table every mealtime at Hogwarts. I think that she has just learned to live with it now.”
He cleared his throat. “Aurour Weasley wanted me to ask about the Latin. He said that Pansy said that you were looking into it.”
Harry looked into those familiar grey eyes. He swallowed, knowing he was about to unbalance Draco’s whole world.
“I inhaled the vapor, didn’t I?” He asked after a moment. Harry’s face told him the answer.  “Fuck.” He said as the nausea reached a point of unavoidance. Everyone was silent, apparently in their own thoughts. He felt his body lurch.
People chattered amongst themselves until the door was thrust open and Pansy came through, taking in the fifteenish pairs of eyes locked on her.
Harry apparated to the Three Broomsticks and found the house. It was visibly rickety and old. He could already smell the mothballs. He took a breath and knocked on the door. He heard muttering behind the other side, a bit of a clatter and the door was yanked open. A small man stood there, nice clean clothes, combed hair. Essentially, not the nutcase he was expecting.
“I mean you said you would,” Draco continued, grinning. “But I didn’t think that you actually would.”
The Aurours piled into the room, all performing spells and taking samples. Ron, Ernie and Michaela were knelt by the body,  talking fixedly, signalling the corpse.
“Is everything all right? ” Harry replied. Pansy said nothing and Harry could hear the drone of the voices on her side of the call.
“Can I stop wearing high neck jumpers then?” Harry said, leaning back onto the pillow and closing his eyes.
People were finding seats where they could, some perching on tables, some leaning against bookcases. Michaela came in, followed by Pansy.
“So,” He said. “You are telling me that you, Harry James Potter.” He said, waving a hand in his direction. “Would name your son after abusive bastards? Did you lean nothing over your time with those ghastly muggles, or your years of having one glorious wizard say one thing in one ear and another howl into the other.”
A hiss filed the room, all the trained fighters itching to move, but Harry held up a hand and the whole room stilled. In his peripheral vision, he saw Draco edge closer.
Harry went back to writing whilst thinking about Draco and home. And how both words often found a place together in his mind.
“Fuck off.” Draco said from the doorway of the kitchen, bathed in light, smirking. “He was always next to you.” He added quietly after a small pause.
Anyway, good luck, I hope you like it and as usual, feel free to comment. Apologies, it took a little longer to post than usual...
Everyone left around noon to tell their families that they weren’t dead. Harry and Draco sat in their bomb site of a living room and admired their presents.
“Mmm.” Harry murmured, sliding his arms around the blonde’s waist and pulling him closer. “Will you take the case?”
“Harry…” Draco exhaled, eyes not fully open, his head lolling limply in the strong arms holding him.
Once they had finished, Harry took up from where he left off on the book. He was reading outloud with Draco snuggled next to him, smiling softly. Looking down at him, Harry thought how lucky he was.  He bent down and kissed his forehead, one of his hands stroking the blonde hair.
“You have soup on your chin.” Draco pointed out with a smirk, breaking the silence. Harry wiped it off with the back of his hand. “But I like you anyway.”
“I-we are going to the manor soon and I can ask my father. He would know. He must be useful for something.”
“Draco, what do you want me to do?” Harry exhaled, exasperation tinting the edges. Draco muttered whilst fiddling with a tea bag.
“He accepted.” She cheered “But-“ Harry interrupted. “- Under the condition that he’s only relocated for two weeks maximum-” She scoffed. “And that his furniture stays precisely where it is.” She scoffed again. “And, finally, that he can take his cats wherever he is temporarily relocated to.”
“Harry…” Draco murmured, even more weakly, but with an urgent undertone. He twisted out of Harry’s arms with the little body strength he had, supported himself on his hands and knees and gagged. Thin coils of saliva fell from his mouth before he started to vomit. He lurched and threw up, gasping and gaging, Harry holding his hair and murmuring softly. He stopped, shivering; his arms shaking and then threw up again, his head aching and his stomach churning.
“Right…” Ron said. Harry squeezed his hand. They wanted an explanation. Fucking bastards. He preyed his eyes open and regretted it instantly. It did wonders for the ache behind his eyes, nursing it and uncaging it, bringing it to a near unbearable level.
Draco heated, froze, extracted and cast spells at the potion in attempt to find out something - anything about the blasted thing that wasn’t ‘it’s black’.
Draco joined Harry in the kitchen and they both carried the mugs through carefully and placed them onto he table. They each grabbed a mug, thanked them and sat cautiously on anything soft. Pansy still had Rose in her lap as she sat on one of the futons on the floor. Hermione and Ron collapsed in to the futon opposite, leaving Blase on the window box near the mountain of presents and fairy lights. They left Harry and Draco to pick thier way to the sofa.
Harry nodded. Draco cupped his cheek and turned his face up to his. “You ok?” He asked, squinting at Harry.
“Oh Harry.” Draco said hopelessly before pulling him into a big cuddle, enveloping his body with his long arms and warm chest.
The potion was thickening and bubbling grotesquely, emitting pockets of a dark steam that filled the air. Droplets were sticking to the side of the cauldron; the occasional one rolled down the side and combined its self back into the dark liquid.
“My mother mentioned in her last letter that he has started collecting them.” Draco said, managing to have a look of both dissatisfaction and amusement.
“Hmm, I think that he’d like the one with the vegetable basket in his hand.” Draco whispered signaling a dancing figurine in Victorian clothing, carrying a variety of vegetables in a basket. “He likes cooking.” He said quietly.
“Draco?” They heard Lucius’s voice come from the study. Draco stayed where he was. Lucius appeared in the doorway.
“It’s December the 24th. It’s Christmas Eve.” She said, looking at all of them in surprise. Pansy whispered and ‘Oh fuck’, paused, stared into the distance and knocked back her shot.
“I did, didn’t I? I say odd things under your submission.” He said looking at Harry with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
Draco grabed his hand and they set off towards the flat. “You’re implying that I didn’t look like an intellectual before so you must be mistaken.”
The walls were studded with paintings and a window ran high and long up the side letting in streaks of light from the winter day outside.
He got into the office at the precise moment Ron happened to yell  “Can no one here speak bloody Latin?” As Pansy and Blaise dissolved into a mound of giggles. Noticing Draco in the doorway, Harry waved him over, greeting him a smile. Pulling up a chair and sitting, Draco pushed his papers towards Ron, explaining the potions to all of them.
“Mmmm, yes please.” So Harry wondered off.  He clattered around in the kitchen and was humming a Celestina Warbeck song to himself when Draco came into the kitchen wrapped in the duvet. He sat on the countertop behind Harry, his face sleepy, the duvet slipping off one side of his chest, exposing his pale shoulder. Harry handed him a plate of toast and butter.
“Are you talking about the minister? Good lord, that was all I heard about in the lab.” Chimed in Draco pinching the bridge of his nose delicately.  “I think people forgot it was only an elbow downwards missing.”
“He got into a bit of trouble, him being in charge of the minister’s safety and all that but they are trying to find out why the minister was splinched in the first place.”
“Hey Draco…” Harry swallowed. Draco looked at him expectantly. “I’m really sorry - about all the things I said. I’m really sorry.”
Their chatter could be heard from the kitchen. Draco and Harry clattered about, placing mugs, throwing tea bags. As they waited for the kettle to boil, Harry slipped his hands around Draco’s waist, pulling him to press his chest into his back. Draco’s put his head back on Harry’s shoulder and smiled at him.
“Youths.” She croaked, mostly to herself. “Want to break my lovely plates. I told them, I did. Not my plates!” She screeched horsey, brandishing a cracked plate far too close to Harrys face.
Harry turned his attention back to the man on the floor; he was about to push for more details but he didn’t need to because Ernie looked up at him and started to talk.
They kept the stare in mind and apparated to the ministry at 7:29, getting there very much on time. They walked through the halls, acknowledging glances thrown their way by familiar faces.
They trundled through the day, starting to feel Christmas looming over them; wrapping paper, ribbon and Celotape were big features.  Sunday passed in a blur, mostly spent in front of the fire and cursing dancing ceramics that ended up proving rather hard to wrap.
Draco huffed but complied with a small smirk on his face. Harry was pushing the trolley, slowly loosing the will to live.
“It was me.” He whispered back. It was quiet but it felt like a scream in the silent room. He looked up at Harry. “I killed those people. It was me.” And he broke down further, curling in on himself and rocking slightly as he cried
“One of my fingerings?” She asked. Harry snorted and tried to cover it up with a cough. Draco dug his nails into Harry’s palm but he could see that the blond was suppressing a smile
Blase agreed with a “That would be nice. Thank you - is that ok with you Harry?” He checked, shooting a concerned look in his direction.
“I have been alone and I thought that if… if I… set up a repellent, that he would leave you.” He said reading his eyes to meet Draco. Threatened, Harry stumbled back and Draco took a stride forward. Pushing his wand into Ernie’s temple so firmly that it forced Ernie to fall back onto the floor. He whimpered and more tears rolled down his face. The aurours shifted, unsure of what was expected of them.
The door was open and Ron pushed it to reveal high ceilinged dark hallways. It looked like a creepy house. Nothing more, nothing less.
“I’m going away for a few days.” Ernie interrupted, looking like it was an accident that he had said anything at all.
Draco agreed and they decided that they would meet a couple of hours later at their apartment after showering.
“Aurour Macmillan?” Harry urged. “Please.” He whispered. He looked up, tears running done his face and a trail of spit dribbling down his chin.
He’d forgotten about this, years of sharing a dorm and it appeared that Draco still had no respect or consideration for the awake.
“Oh, Harry.” She’d said through tears. She tried. She cast charms and gave him potions that just dribbled down his chin. But it didn’t work. He was too far gone.
Ron walked in, closely followed by Aurour Bones and Aurour Macmillan. Ernie looked at Harry as he passed and flinched. Harry raised his fingers subconsciously to his neck and offered an apologetic smile as he walked thorough the wards. Draco tried to cover a snort with a cough.
“But I meant it though. I really shouldn’t have fallen in love with you.” Draco whispered, the fear visible in the whites of his eyes.
Harry stood there at ten past four, expecting Draco. It wasn’t like him to be late in the slightest. Let alone ten whole minutes late. Harry checked his watch again, bit his lip nervously and decided wait five more and then go to the lab, just to check. Just in case.
Draco groaned and raised a hand to the crick in his neck. He listened to the voices in the kitchen with a sigh and hearing muffled sounds from his lap, he looked down to see Harry sleepily rubbing his eyes. He smiled and kissed he tip of the sleepy Gryffindor’s nose. Suddenly a flash went off, they both jump and looked up to see Pansy there with an old muggle camera. She looked at them, grined, shrugged and went back into the kitchen to join the chatter. They both leaned back onto the sofa and started to laugh sleepily until they were just looking at each other. Harry gently put a hand onto the back of Draco’s neck and pulled him down for a kiss. Draco could feel the smile on the Gryfindoor’s mouth as they kissed slowly. The taste was so familiar and comforting but there was another sudden flash as they both jumped and heard Pansy cackling as she stomped back into the kitchen, camara in hand.
“I… How was Shaklebolt about the minister’s splinch? ” Said Harry in attempt to block out the snickering coming from Draco and Hermione. Ron gave him a very grateful look and left to make more tea.
Harry reached over and silenced the alarm clock with a flick of his wand. Forms of light started to peer through the window, illuminating Draco’s skin. He was curled on his side, left arm hanging off the bed, the mark visible.
“Come on Harry” Draco murmured eventually, shooting a look of incredability at his father. “Lets go home. Thank you.” He turned towards the door and swept Harry with him with the sheer forcefulness of his strides. Only once they reached the hallway did they hear Lucius call out Draco’s name carelessly. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and turned towards his father. Harry opted to stay in the dark hallway for this one.
“Ok then, what would you call your child?” Draco asked calmly, head tilting to the side in a challenge
He pushed open the door and coughed, scrambling for his wand. It smelled burnt and the air was tinted with dark vapor. Like toast ‘a bit over done’ to a new level.
Looking down at him now, Harry say the circles under his shining eyes, his pale, his hollow cheeks. He saw the man he loved almost as far away from life as one could be. Harry took his hand, exposing a skeletal wrist from under the cold covers.
“We need peanut butter.” Draco commented as squinted at a list and placed two tins of tomatoes in a gap amongst the food. Harry took some peanut butter off the shelf.
Harry's eyes felt dangerously misty, and he bowed his head in an effort to hide it. "Thank you, Aunt Rose," he managed. "This is a lot," he added after a calming pause.
oh also fuck jkr and those who stand with her. i'm adding more trans characters and no one can stop me.
Draco said nothing and returned to his book, and the two sat in silence for a while. Then, the Malfoy said, "There's a whole section on crystals in the back here, on what kinds work best for what purpose, and the recommended crystals that First years should wear before they learn spells."
Rose hummed, not giving an answer to that because she didn't exactly know. "I became one in my fifth year, but I didn't know what it was before that. You have the book, and me and hopefully Sirius, to teach you. So, fourth year." Rose nodded, cementing the fact. "I think I'll just switch to lemon tea," she mused, looking back down at her cup. Harry rolled his eyes discreetly.
"These are the Yule logs that we burn on Yule. Those in wizarding society do this to connect with late family who could not join them physically for the holiday." Rose knelt directly opposite him with the logs between them, so Harry knelt as well. "I want you to hold my hands and focus on your magic, and I will as well. That will bring it about ourselves and infuse our very essences into the logs, which will then show us our late family when we light it."
Harry smiled at his aunt. He understood her lack of control over the situation and was grateful for her suggestions. "Right, and I will. The reading I was having trouble with is bookmarked." Harry lifted his First year Defense book.
She was just finishing up the chapter when a man came in, whooping and hollering. People looked at him weirdly, but dismissed him quickly. The man then ran up to Rose's booth, almost knocking over her coffee.
say it again, or it will be fifty. If you put as much energy into your schoolwork as you do your bigotry, perhaps you'd be getting better than an Acceptable." With that, she turned and continued to stalk around the room, giving points and advice throughout the lesson. Harry caught eyes with a pair of twins behind Hermione, and gave them a slight nod. He got one from both of them in return and they sent grueling looks at Kenneth Towler's back.
and I want to accommodate you as best I can." She raised her eyebrows and Harry was quick to nod. Being the second time his full name was used, it had a different effect on him than just Harry. "Now, I'm going to put some tea on. Flavor preference?"
Parkinson snorted herself at that. "Man's a bit barmy, my parents say. But endearing enough, I suppose." It was no secret that he was Dumbledore's pet who would defend his name to his dying breath, and it was suspected that the headmaster had given him the job more out of pity or kindness than for a real need of a groundskeeper.
"Not all snakes are slimy," Draco said, subtly sitting straighter and speaking more posh. Harry realized they were talking about Slytherins- which included his aunt and Draco's parents.
Her words were calm but pointed, and several other teachers listened in. Severus and Poppy shared the same startled look. "Of course, dear, but may I ask for which student I will be checking so early in the term?"
"Isn't that what Rose said in class?" Harry asked with amusement. Draco huffed at him and upturned his nose.
Rose hummed as she opened the letter. She recognized the handwriting and was eager to read the reply. Amelia's reply stated that she had people looking into the matter and that there would be a closed hearing after the holidays for the adoption. Rose let out a happy sigh and tacked it on the cork board beside the fireplace. "Well, I'm glad that worked out." She turned to the face of her curious nephew. "Amelia Bones from the Ministry has written to inform me of an investigation into my sister's behavior." Harry's eyes widened, so she continued. "Hopefully she'll get a fine out of her or perhaps some jail time, though I am unsure as to where little Dudley will go if she does. There's also to be a hearing of my case near the end of the hols." She crouched down at Harry's level where he still sat on the floor. "I wanted to ask you if you would stay here with me while you are not in school until you are an adult. There would be a ritual and I would become your sole magical guardian. I won't do so without your explicit permission, so I asked for a standing hearing until you agree. I'll give you some time to think about it and then we'll--"
That was the last conversation Rose had had with her nephew. Rose didn't trust his words. Petunia absolutely hated her and Lily, so why would Vernon be any different, especially with how they acted when Rose and Hagrid showed up? No, Rose made up her mind. She was going to take him to King's Cross when September rolled around, with birthday presents in tow. She had made up her mind.
Rose hummed as she looked at the letter, which had her name written on the back in slightly shaky writing. She unfolded it and let her eyes sweep the contents, feeling the tingle of a privacy charm over the paper.
Rose sighed. He wouldn’t understand this all at once. “Ya don’t know … ya don’t know …” Hagrid said, running his fingers through his hair. Rose held a hand on Harry’s shoulder. She would show him before she left, for sure. Hagrid finally said, “Ya don’t know what you
When the students were escorted to their houses, Rose ended up passing Harry and Draco on the way to the dungeons. She gave them a warm smile before breaking off towards Severus' quarters, said man in tow. Draco nudged Harry and the smaller boy stroked his necklace before murmuring his thanks; Rose threw a smirk over her shoulder before the First years disappeared further into the Dungeons.
Draco winced minutely when Rose addressed him properly. All of the professors did, but Rose was the only one who made a point of being friendly with all the students. Harry managed to lift Granger up and they all stood in front of the Defense witch.
She had just sat down on her couch when a knock sounded at her front door. She suppressed a grunt and yelled to ask who it was. “Severus,” she heard. A smile crossed her face and she got up, walking to the door and looking through the peephole. It was indeed Severus, and he was shaking a box of what looked to be books in front of the small ring of glass. Rose smirked and opened the door, ushering him inside.
So, like the loser that he was, he started cleaning the kitchen of a total stranger on a Thursday night. Sai d stranger just kept on snoring and whispering to nobody. Draco rolled his eyes and focused on the tasks. Three hours later, the plates were clean, the trash was taken out during a break in the rain, and the smell was gone.
Draco got out of his car and once again dragged the man to his front door. Luckily the door was easy to open and there was a couch near it. Sighing in relief, he practically dropped the body to the soft-looking cushions. His relief was very short-lived, interrupted by a loud clap of thunder.
By the time he was done with his fun, Jeffery was half-dead. The last thing Harry did to him was cutting off his dick. He forced it down the pervert’s throat, and Harry turned on his way to the door, took one last glance, and torched the room. From outside the building, muffled screams delighted Harry’s ears.
After the final battle, he thought that it would end. No more terror, no one trying to kill him. No more of his loved ones getting hurt or dying. He did his best to try to help the Wizarding World move on.
The man let out a groan of pain, opening his eyes for a moment before going back to sleep. While Draco debated between calling for help or taking the man to his apartment, he checked to see if there was anything on the guy that could help him. He let out a small cheer when he found a wallet and keys. As he stood closer, he had to jump back in disgust as the strong smell of alcohol hit his nose.
“Well, my luck seems to be going strong this week.“ He took in the open laptop with a smirk and began browsing through files. But his smirk quickly fell as photos of
ob. A job that he would probably hate. Shaking the negative thoughts from his head, Draco focused on the man next to him.
The way his dove smiles at him is so heavenly, with no hint of evil or cruelty. This is something he has craved. Something he wants to taste. Something he wants to keep in his home. Something that he feels he rightfully deserves.
“I love that you’re being protective, but I’m fine. If anything, him coming to my apartment will make things worse for him. Police already said that he’ll have an even worse punishment if something were to happen to me. In this town, people tend to punish creeps like him very intensively.”  Harry protested a lot so he made a compromise. Draco gave him an extra key, and that cheered the man right up.
didn’t mention the names of the people who sacrificed their lives to help him. He said nothing when people assumed that a wedding was going to happen immediately, even though the Weasly family was still grieving over their son’s death. Finally, after months of being pushed and staying quiet, he spoke out. He spoke out because a stranger, an absolute nobody, another wannabe Rita Skeeter dared to destroy the image, of the two people who had a connection with his parents, the two people who gave him the love, the care, the affection he craved so much. The two people who died for
Police told him that once they caught Jeffery, the man would have new charges against him. Draco felt a huge weight just drop from his shoulders, especially when people came pouring in with support and love. He honestly thought he would have negative reactions, but there was none of that.
“Here you go. A medium-dark roast coffee and a blueberry muffin. Is there anything else?” The man nodded in thanks and got up to leave.
The world doesn't even know the truth about them, Remus and Sirius, Harry whispered to the darkness. His magic demanded more, offered him more ways to take revenge on those who don't deserve to live. Those thoughts made him sob."
When he got home, he noticed a weird sensation throughout his body, especially in his head. He moaned in happiness as he stepped into a nice, cool shower, trying to wash away the feeling. The sensation remained, getting stronger the longer he stood under the water.
He was glad that the coffee station was away from the stand since his hands were shaking badly. Taking a deep breath, Draco prepared to face the man.
He felt bad that he kept waking his friend up with his screams, so to make up for it, the blonde cooked, cleaned, and did all the chores so a tired Harry wouldn’t have to.
“I mean, you act like a whore whenever that stupid guy enters.” Jeffery came closer, making Dracoback into the counter.
So he drank and drank. The bitter taste of alcohol helped him forget about everything. His memory became a blur. He was grateful for that, but everyone else seemed to hate him for it.
Maybe it was his head or maybe Harry was close to his university, but ten minutes later, the man was scanning the room, and their eyes met. Sighing in relief, Draco grabbed a hold of his friend’s home.
“You faggot! You did this! I know you did this. If you weren’t such a fucking tease, I wouldn’t have misread the situation!” By now, reporters entered the room. Everyone wore expressions of concern, fear, and anger.
on his dove for a few years and once it wore off, the blond would still be completely in love with him.
Rose smirked. "Very good, Harry. You see the pillars?" Harry counted three between Platforms 9 and 10.
Hermione freaking out quietly in the library like, "How do you classify wizards?! A Pureblood and a Muggleborn makes a Half-blood, but what about Pureblood and Half-blood? Muggleborn and Muggleborn? Half-blood and Half-blood? Muggleborn and Half-blood? Nothing makes sense! Everything is a lie!"
Rose whipped around to face her nephew and the others. "What in the world were you lot thinking?! I have explained that trolls
out of their home, they did," Rose seethed, only just keeping hold of her white hot anger. Feeling her magic flare with her temper, Severus took hold of Rose's left hand under the table in his support.
Harry thanked Draco. "It was actually July 31st, but my aunt could never send me anything. Oh, sorry, I'm Harry." The raven-haired boy held out a hand.
Dumbledore grew quiet. Yes, he had something to tell her, something dire indeed. “It seems that Voldemort is gone.” Rose was astonished. Really? After all this time? “But, this came at a great cost.”
Rose gave a warm smile. "Thanks, Muffin. Let's get your stuff to your room and I'll give you a tour, hm?"
Harry laughed. "I haven't got a clue who it is." Then a thought struck him. "It must've been Rose who asked Madam Pomfrey to check me out. She gave me nutrition potions to include in my meals and some ointment for scars."
Madam Pince nodded. "Ah yes, your nephew. I noticed he was looking quite ecstatic at the welcoming feast."
Rose watched with kind eyes as Hagrid reached into his pocket to produce a cake for Harry. Harry was beside himself. “Who are you?” he asked. Rose frowned as Hagrid laughed beside her. He introduced himself as Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts. When Harry’s eyes turned to her, she raised her brows. “And you?”
When Harry caught sight of his aunt at the table, he smiled even wider, if that were possible. She looked like she belonged up there, regal and powerful, and Harry found himself wishing he could become as powerful as her.
“I’ve decided to take him to your sister’s house, to keep him away from the fame he’s gained tonight. When he is older, I will send him his acceptance to Hogwarts letter. You will be able to see him again, don’t worry.”
The ear thing the twins had given him was working very well if he could hear into a closed compartment, and someone was recounting the tale of how he'd seen Snape limping and relying on his right leg more than his left. Harry wondered who would have seen if he'd only been scouting the dungeons and walked Harry back to the snake den if not a snake themself, and listening longer rewarded him with the description of a large black three-headed dog that Hagrid often referred to as 'Fluffy', of all things. It was so absurd that Harry snorted, forgetting that only he could hear what the person was saying. Blaise eyed him for a moment and even Parkinson perked up from her diary.
Harry shrugged off his cloak and set it on another stool the room conjured for them, watching in amazement, and kneeled easily. Severus had a little more trouble, and sat gingerly down with most of his weight on his right leg. Rose watched him intently.
“Yes, of course. If you can say that finding out he’s never been told anything about the magical world ‘fine’, then yes, it went perfectly,” she replied with more sarcasm in her voice than was characteristic. Severus smirked at her once more. She sat up straighter. "And I have some concerns with how Dumbledore went about all this."
“I could say the same for you, Rose,” Petunia said back. Rose looked away from her sister and back to her nephew.
Dumbledore dismissed her words. “Nonsense! You’d fit in just fine.” His smile was reassuring, but Rose still had her doubts. She thought it over, and knew that her life right now was not very exciting. Hogwarts was full of magic and talent and … happiness. Something else was bothering him, though, and she knew it.
Harry kept a few books out to put in his bag, along with a boxed lunch that appeared out of nowhere but smelled strongly of good, mouth watering food, so he didn't complain. That, and there was a note attached to the tie that was written in Rose's handwriting, so he assumed she'd gotten him something for the train (since he'd requested to ride back on the train as opposed to Flooing or Apparating) and slid it carefully into his satchel as he took to the great, grand entrance of the castle to head down to the train. He told himself that he would find something that matched his theory of the creature that had bitten Snape in his book or (if he even dared to hope) hear some kind of rumor during the train ride from some unsuspecting student sharing what they thought was a wild story with their friends.
Rose shook her head. "When I make bread, I like to do it by hand. It's something I used to do with my mother a lot, so it's nostalgic." Harry watched as she finished with the counter and went to the sink. He opened his mouth to ask something, but he was startled by a tapping at the window next to the hallway. Rose looked over at the owl trying to get in. "Oh, that'll be Narcissa's owl. Let her in, will you?"
"James wanted to name you something traditional, being a Pureblood, and Lily wanted something different." She barked a laugh, recalling a memory. "They were arguing one night and I was just downing their Firewhiskey trying to stay out of it, but then Lil turned to me and I blurted out the first thing that came to mind." She looked at her nephew, mirth in her eyes. "You are named after one of the greatest spell weavers in known history. I was researching after one of my jobs at the dragon sanctuary that I worked at and it caught my eye. Spell weaving is very complex, but masters at Defense, Charms and Transfiguration can create at least one or two spells in their lifetime."
"Wow, you're really going all out for your friends, Harry. Be careful how much you're spending there," Rose said to him with a raised eyebrow as they grabbed lunch at the café at the end of the street,
The wizard laughed. “Sharp as always Rose. That’s why I’m here,” he said with much gusto. Rose raised a fine red eyebrow. “I’ve come to ask if you would like to come back to Hogwarts to become a professor. We both know how much you love Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
The sun was peeking through the trees in Rose's neighborhood. Gentle light filled the room from the single window that spanned the width of the wall up at the ceiling. The logs had burned to cinders and the smokey magic had long settled, but pine and cider still stirred the air. Rose still sat across from Harry with her arms outstretched, hands clutching Harry's. As Harry blinked his eyes open, he realized he'd been crying physically as well, if the stiffness of his cheeks and the cracks in his lips and the crust in his eyes said anything. And Rose looked much the same, to Harry's astonishment. He wondered if they saw the same people, with her being his aunt. He wondered if the red and blonde flashes behind Lily had emerged as people in her visions, or if they had shimmered and glittered in the smoke like in Harry's.
Lily had a sister, a twin sister by the name of Rose. Her hair was a more fiery red, and her eyes more blue than green. She was hated by Petunia even more than Lily was. And after the twins got their Hogwarts letters, Petunia detested the two even more. She knew they weren’t normal, what with Lily making flowers float down to her and Rose making a fluorescent purple light with her fingers.
The black paled the freckles and made her skin look like cut marble, but not too washed out when combined with the purple. The crown-like pin was a nice touch in her hair, and the pink of her Quartz didn't clash. Rose had to take another steadying breath as she thought of her sister, who would be so proud to know that Harry was starting Hogwarts tonight. She straightened and nodded to her reflection before strapping her wand sheath to the belt on her dress and summoning the boots to her legs. She made to walk out of her quarters and pet Mewt before reaching the door. "See you tonight, Mewt," she called, and then she was a woman on a mission.
That night, the two of them headed into a room Harry had not seen in his tour of the flat. It was hidden behind a panel in the living room, behind the tree. From the first step Harry took past the threshold, he knew it was a magically charged space. It felt nearly identical to the room they'd asked Hogwarts for to conduct the Halloween--Samhain--ritual. The air was bright and dense, warm like wildfire but confined like a hearth. There was a faint scent of cider and pine as he pressed further in, though only if he wasn't expecting it. On the floor in the middle of a ritual circle, like the one used for Samhain, sat a pile of exactly three logs. As Harry walked up to it he could see the shimmering of magic in the bark, the slight hue of potion treatment. Rose closed the door and smiled at him as she squeezed his shoulder on her way past.
Rose then gave Snape his gift from her, and Remus his. Snape opened his first and Harry saw that it was filled with the same quill pens Rose had gotten him for his birthday. And by filled, Harry really does mean
Rose nodded. "He's getting on up there in years. Might have to get a new owl soon, but he's still hanging on." She smiled. "You know, Remus sent me a letter today, and he would like to spend Yule with us."
"What's your name?" Harry asked in a neutral tone, though he really didn't like how the ginger was talking to his friend.
They spent most of the day in the lab, and Harry brewed several potions that Rose was very impressed with. One was almost market-worthy, his version of a Forgetfulness Potion that was more of a nuisance than it usually was. Brewing was calming in a way that Snape's classes usually were, and that one class that Rose had ended up covering. Rose herself was laid back and while she did keep up a lecturer's tone, she also made it fun and enjoyable--just like her classes were. For dinner, Rose taught Harry how to make meatballs--specifically her favorite Classic Italian Meatballs that she usually gets down at the Donata's pizzeria. It was so wonderfully domestic that Harry felt his chest tighten at a glimpse of what he'd been missing. Rose rubbed his shoulder at one point and sprinkled cheese in his hair, and they both laughed.
The letter that got Rose the most excited was a letter from a girl named Marcy Potté, the daughter of one of Rose's former housemates. It was a formal invitation to her and Vivek Allen's wedding ceremony in the summer.
Hedwig was off with a letter in the morning though Harry had written it the night before. While he waited for his aunt to wake, he got himself a cup of water from the sink and heated up some leftovers in the microwave ( Harry still astounded by the blend of Muggle and Magic in the flat ). He struggled his way onto a stool at the island and enjoyed his aunt's cooking once more. Halfway through, Hedwig soared back through the window and landed on the edge of the white countertop with a letter in her beak. Harry wiped his mouth and took it with a smile.
"Where could they be?" Rose asked in a hushed manner as they walked back towards the portrait to leave the common room.
“Probably blaming me for ‘ruining her life’ or making our family ‘weird’. She has a habit of doing that when I’m mentioned.” Rose smirked a little, bitterly. She looked back to Hagrid. “Have you got anything for the boy to eat? He must be starving. He should eat more than cake.”
"There's no jinxes or curses on it," Rose finally said. Harry blew out a breath. "But there's a residual magical signature on it. Two, actually." Rose dropped the package and set her wand down, staring at it for another moment.
When he opened his eyes, it was to the sight of his aunt crouched over Snape, who had collapsed. "You arsehole, you
at his aunt and they touched foreheads. "I think they're drunk," Harry croaked in a stage whisper to Remus. The man gave a deep cackle and turned to the boy, eyes shining with mirth.
Rose placed a hand on Hermione's upper back and rubbed across her shoulders. "I know that some will - and have - teased you for your book habits and vast knowledge, but don't let them get to you. I was the same way when I was in school, and I was treated much the same. I'm also Muggleborn, you see." At this, Hermione's eyes went wide as she realized the rumors were true. She suddenly aspired to be just as great a witch as Rose as she started to admire her more and more. "If you ever have any more trouble with such simpletons," Hermione laughed, "you can come to me or Professor McGonagall, and I promise that we will take care of it. Bullying is not tolerated in any House." They made it to the staircase that led to the portrait of the Fat Lady, so Rose turned towards Hermione and offered a smile. "Goodnight, Hermione."
Dinner came and went, Harry deciding that he did in fact like Chinese and wanted to try something different next time ( when he thought there might be a next time, which it was looking very likely there would be ) and he found himself lying in bed with a full stomach. It seemed bizarre to him that six months ago, he had no clue magic existed or how wonderful it was. Now, he was living with his other aunt and never had to see the Dursleys again, which was almost too good to be true.
Rose blinked and reached behind her, where she indeed had a stowaway hiding in her hood. She removed whatever it was, and the class melted at the sight of her kitten. "Mewt, I thought I told you to stay on my desk." The black kitten mewed at her, causing squeals and words of affection to echo throughout the room. Rose sighed as if feeling very put out. "I suppose I have no choice but to allow you to stay." She let him crawl onto her shoulder and he disappeared back into her hood, where he quickly fell back asleep.
Harry glanced away but Rose did not look convinced. "Are you sure? Will you permit me to take a look?"
On the ride to the station, Rose thought more on the situation at hand. Harry definitely wasn't raised in the sweet, caring manner Dumbledore claimed he was. Hell, he was scarcely Rose's size when she was eleven! And
The day after Halloween, Snape was absent from breakfast. Absent from everywhere, really, as no one saw him all through the day. Harry had a suspicion that wasn't confirmed until he walked into Potions class - a double class with the Third-year Slytherins and Gryffindors - seeing his bright-haired aunt instead of the tall, brooding professor.
“ALL WHAT?” both Rose and Hagrid yelled. Rose figured Petunia wouldn’t tell him about magic, but to not even tell him about his parents? “Now wait jus’ one second!” Hagrid continued. He boomed with anger, nearly shaking the hut. Rose stayed back with Harry, knowing that if anyone insulted magic in any way connected to Dumbledore, Hagrid would have a fit. And have a fit he did. Rose’s nephew muttered about his good marks in math. Rose snorted.
Harry gazed in wonder at all the magic around him, both visible and not, buzzing to the point of tangible. Draco, who walked in next to him, smirked at his expression before dropping it as gazed up at the staff table. Many of the professors were trying to hide a sour look, and Rose looked absolutely livid in the way that Slytherins do, which is to say that the only sign of her anger was how hard her eyes were cut. She was smiling, of course, but Draco knew that look very well from when his father got angry; never at Draco, but he'd seen it often enough.
Their seventh year at Hogwarts drug by slower than imaginable. Lily and Rose, though they may have strayed during their years due to the separation of houses and the obvious rivalry between the two, were brought back together and stuck close to one another. They tried to just forget what happened, but being called a name so horrible stuck with Lily for quite some time, and Rose never quite got over the fact that her best friend insulted her sister.
She fell into a state of depression. This had happened before, of course, when he used that insult. But, now, after her years at Hogwarts, she felt like she was just … floating. She bought her own flat, furnished it nicely with the money she earned at her job tending to rescued endangered dragons from Bulgaria. Just yesterday she had taken a few thorns out of the wing of a beautiful gray and silver one. He was one of her favorites, mainly because the colors of his scales matched her mood.
on herself and sitting down at the vanity. The witch applied black eyeliner, mascara, and rose colored lipstick before standing and waving her wand. The dress swapped places with her Muggle ensemble and the material felt smooth against her skin. Looking into the body mirror opposite her vanity, Rose waved again and her hair managed to fit itself into a somewhat smooth high ponytail, with her fringe in the front too short to stay in the black hair tie framing her face. Another wave of her wand tied a sheer green scarf that shimmered with silver glitter around her ponytail. She gestured at a black hair pin that Severus had given her a few years ago and it fit snugly at the base of her ponytail. It was made from pure Jet, and she made sure to wear it to big (stressful) events, such as the welcoming feast. The Garnet and Labradorite earrings she wore hummed a bit as the crystals harmonized with each other, and Rose gazed into the body mirror once more.
The daily abuse the witch witnessed that had started the moment Harry was dropped on their doorstep and was still occurring made her blood boil. She removed herself from her sister's mind just in time to hear a door slam shut upstairs. Rose took a steadying breath to calm down.
as he reached with both hands to pick the cloth up. It was soft and almost silk-like, slipping through his hands easily if he didn't have enough grip on it. Harry found two corners of the cloth, stood up, held it in front of him, and disappeared.
He shook himself and met her eyes, smiling lightly. "Yeah, I'm fine. Your home is very nice," he said sincerely.
Rose nodded with a healthy amount of hesitation. Yeah, sure. She could help Harry brew some potions. Severus told her that he was a very attentive student and took meticulous notes during lectures. The latter she knew, having seen him in her own class ( and knowing without a doubt that Draco looked over his notes, as it showed in his own work ). If Harry had a passion for it she'd let him experiment. She could make a list of the potions she normally supplied Victor's and supervise him. "Okay. I'll let you in tomorrow and we can brew all day." The grin that overcame her nephew's face was worth any accident probable to happen.
Hagrid smiled kindly. "Don't you worry Harry. You'll learn soon enough. Just- be yourself." Rose nodded.
The hours went by leisurely despite how the day had started. Rose had gone to Petunia's to demand all of Harry's things so that she could set up his room, and they had told her he had no belongings! That they'd taken what little he had and thrown it out! Rubbish! Rose was so infuriated at her sister that the water she was boiling had bubbled over and burned both her pot and the burner. And so Rose had left for Madam Malkin's.
the Dungeons!" An outraged Seventh-year yelled. The person beside them smacked their arm and muttered something about Professor Rose protecting them.
Hagrid looked around. “Couldn’t make us a cup of tea, could ya? ‘s not been an easy journey …” He trailed off. Rose nearly apologized for her sister and her husband, but then remembered why they were there. Hagrid strode over to Dudley. “Budge up, ya great lump.” The boy ran behind Petunia and Vernon, making Rose chuckle silently. “An’ here’s Harry!” he said as he walked up to him. Harry’s eyes were big as he looked up at the half-giant. Rose smiled. He did look so much like her sister. It made her heart swell.
Hagrid showed up outside, and Rose shot him a small smile, still suspicious. Draco looked as if he were going to say something, but after looking at Harry again he shut his mouth. Odd. Rose ordered Harry some robes as Hagrid gave him ice cream, and watched in fascination as Draco left. One look at Hagrid and Rose knew he was shocked as well. Taking into account his father's views, Rose assumed Draco would be brought up the same, but he wasn't saying anything remotely racist or bigoted around Harry.
Harry decided to go ahead and get a book at Flourish and Blotts since they had time to spare, and picked out a very interesting book on potion ingredients native to America; Theo liked Potions and always wanted to know more about all the different ingredients and why one reacted the way it did with the other. He was sure the other Slytherin would love it. After picking it up and Shrinking it like Rose had with her own book, they resumed their seat outside the tea shop. "So, what's Animagius?" Harry asked.
"It comes before Christmas, if that's what Petunia celebrated. It's a gathering and ritual performed on the winter solstice that brings us closer to those departed from us. We become closer to them, we spend time with them in the form of visions and feelings, and thus become more in tune with our magic." Rose glanced down and took a deep breath. "I've lit a log for James and Lily every year, trying to do good by them."
Rose smirked wryly. She noticed Dumbledore's grunt before she replied, "He had just as much chance of being in Gryffindor as he did Slytherin. I'm sure my serpentine nature isn't
"Thank you, Mr. Lupin," Harry said with a reverence previously unknown to him. Lupin smiled and clapped his shoulder again, though the smile was a tad bit wry as the man corrected him with a soft
wow hi holy shit sorry for sitting on that chapter for over a year. it took me about a month to get half of it written and then it just. sat. yikes.
Harry chuckled. “I bet it was.” He responded as he reached into the bread bin for some more pasta. He put it to boil and leaned on the counter. Apparently being stressed is tiring. Who knew?
“We were looking at potions that were black.” Harry clarified hurriedly. “But then we got distracted…”
“So my theory makes sense. It works!” Draco exclaimed. “If the potion meant to harm, it would harm. No. This potion has another purpose. I just need to figure our what it is.” He added after a pause.
“I am fully aware but tell me anyway.” Was his reply. Harry rolled his eyes and kissed him calmly and slowly. This is probably his favorite thing. Ever. Just kissing Draco Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy kissing him. It’s heaven.
He apparated to the doorway of the flat as soon as he reached the hallway. He put his key in the door and opened it to find the it pooled in warm flickering light from the fire. He breathed in the smell as he heard clangs from the kitchen, accompanied by Draco’s gentle singing.  He walked in to see Draco wearing a shirt and his wonderfully tight trousers stirring something on the stove.
Draco grumbled but didn’t protest so, Harry thought as they went into the lab, he should take that as an agreement. In some form or another.
“But I don’t know what it means.”  He passed it to Blaise, nodding. He squinted at it but then shook his head.
“What are you doi-.” Draco said from the doorway before Harry wrapped him in a tight hug. Draco’s arms rose slowly and enveloped him in return.
“We are buying Arthur a Christmas present.” Harry explained as he grabbed a box of cotton buds and a sponge. Draco followed him to a make up isle, looking at the rows of coloured bottles. Harry grabbed a facemask and some lip balm and went to the till.
“Why the minister splinched himself.” Looking up as if expecting an answer. “I mean, he needed to be distracted.” She said, threading her fingers together and resting her chin on them in deep thought. The room was silent.
“Harry, look. It could, but it is too… precise. We never found anything that they didn’t want us to find. And it was all there. And we still don’t understand it. This isn’t a normal case Harry. It’s all too…”  He waved his hands in frustration, almost knocking Harrys glasses off. Harry opened his mouth, but as usual, was cut off.
Harry exhaled loudly. “They are killing people because of me – No, Draco, let me finish. They are killing people because of me, and you are a potential victim and here I am - right next to you – putting your life at risk.”
Harry was about to start apologising profusely on behalf of Draco when Pansy ran over to them at top speed, dragging Blase behind her.
Pansy went to the lab, Ron to the flat, Blaise to the manor just in case. Harry thought quickly. Draco. He looked the clock – he would be meeting Draco now.
Hello! I wish you the best of luck with this chapter -there are some gross scenes (Aftermath of a murder (and by that I mean a corpse)(And when I say scenes plural, I mean scene singular)).
“Hold up, everyone. They’re not using Harry’s name. They are doing it for him.” Blaise said determined.
His hair was sticking to his forehead and the back of his shirt was damp. He ignored it and referred back to the page titled ‘Mente Plumenium’ , adding two drops of an unnaturally purple liquid into the cauldron, turning the potion a swirling deep shade of blue and the smell filling the room. Draco puffed out his cheeks and tuned the heat down with a flick on his wand and leaned against the counter. Fuck it was warm.
“You would do that to an innocent child? Name it after an insect. I mean I know you are named after a reptile, but really?”
Inside the ministry, the constant flurry of people had ceased, leaving him and only a couple of other people navigating the hallways. The dark offices had always made him feel slightly out of place, like he was the only one left.
“I am going to go back to the lab to do some analysis.” He said, waving the jar of poison. “Send me the results by owl?”
He left to tidy the lab and lay out his utensils in preparation for the possible creation of an exceedingly dangerous poison used in a murder.
Making the decision to divide and conquer, Harry went into the processing room for public floo departures and Draco went to trace all the public appartaions.
“Magic isn’t everything, is it? He paused. “I mean, look at me, Harry.” He did. “I’m dying.” He shrugged.
Tear drops of light started emitting themselves from the cauldron. He watched them floating through the air. Feeling a strange inclination to touch them, he let go of the spoon and it fell with a clatter on the floor. He walked forward but his feet didn’t move and he stumbled, hitting the cauldron out of place. He turned messily, his vision undeniably wrong, his mouth too wet and sticky, his limbs unresponsive.
“You alright?” Harry murmured softly onto the blonde’s neck as he pulled him closer. Draco muttered something into Harry’s head. He pulled the dark mop closer.
They both broke into a sprint and opened the door to see what looked like half of the Aurors in the lab. Some of the shelves had been tipped over, books and bottled ingredients pooling onto the floor like spilled innards. There were burn marks on the walls like scars from an earlier fight, some of the darker ones still smoking a little.
They joined everyone from the kitchen doorway, Pansy smirking at them from a counter top, Hemionie and Blase cooking together and Ron, as usual, making tea and humming to himself. Leaning his head on Draco’s chest, Harry sleepily rubbed his eyes.
“It’s ok, It’s just a dream. A bad dream.” He whispered quickly, putting his hands either side of Draco’s face, the Slytherin gripping his wrists, still breathing heavily. He looked at Harry in his eyes and started to cry.
“They wanted me to analyze the veritasierum for the trials. The usual.” Harry rolled his eyes. “The soup is ready.”
When Ron and Hermione came through the fire place, Draco was asleep with his head on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry was absentmindedly stroking his blond hair whilst reading very softly. Ron ignored it and stomped straight to the kitchen but Hermione fumbled at her side, raised a polaroid camera, took a photo and grinned. As she followed Ron into the kitchen, she pulled the revealed the photo from the camera and put it to develop in her back pocket without a backwards glance.
“Um, upstairs I think.” Harry replied. “I am not sure, but he should be here soon. He is a bit late.”
The next days passed without incident, layers of investigating and samples and evenings flicking through books with Draco in the lab trying to find anything vaguely along the lines of anything to do with the poison. And high neck tops. A lot of them.
They were all sitting on the floor infront of the fire, the chimes from the church ringing through the open window.
“Right, yeah, ok. I’ll owl him now.”  He added, running his hand up his neck. “It’s very visible, isn’t it?”
“Harry?” he heard Draco’s voice reply from the kitchen. He felt his chest flood with relief as he stumbled blindly towords the kitchen.
“Ok, preposition.” Draco said, looking at the faces around the table and balancing some Lasagne on his fork. “You can all go get presents and whatever you need from your house and then come back here to stay the night and we can spend Christmas together.” He looked at all the faces in turn, surprise and relief on most faces.
Harry went and kneeled on the other side of the body, facing Ron, Michaela and Ernie, who were still talking and started to cast some spells.
So they left the room filled with tired people and walked into the dark night, the cold air hitting their faces as a shock and then a relief.
“Lets go.” Draco said as he got up, took the jumper off and folded it neatly and placed it on the chest of drawers and brushed his clothes down.
After many cups of tea, Ron and Hermione decided to go home to ‘save the babysitter’. Rose was apparently refusing to refrain speaking.
Harry became desparate when Draco started whimpering; sweat collecting at his forehead, hand clammy.
His mind went blank, wiped of anything even vaguely coherent. He cleared his throat. His mouth was dry with the words that he knew he had to say.
They awoke early, both preparing for the murder case. At 7, an owl flew through an open window in the sitting room. Harry took the note and read it out loud.
Only one light was left on, Harry realized, smiling to himself. And of course, it belonged to Michaela.
There was light. Far too much of it. Someone was holding his hand very softly. He groaned and reached his other hand up to his forehead.
At the ministry, he sat at his desk briefing the team on an old building in Hogsmeade in dire need of being stripped in fear of embedded curses in the walls. It should be straightforward but a rather stubborn old man lived there and was adamant to stay.
“You’ve got a little something.” Ron grinned, pointing to his neck. Harry touched a hand to the left side of his neck.
The sad jumper – It is to be noted - was formally Harry’s, but it had fallen into  Draco’s hands and was now very firmly his.
“She’s apparating here soon.” He relied from Blaise’s side. Harry nodded and looked over at Draco, who was trying not to laugh at something Pansy said that had made both her and Blaise crack up. Hermione appeared at the top of the steps, arms full, hair bushy. Both very expected. She trudged down the steps and kissed Ron on the cheek.
“Well, I was wondering if it’s true that you are dating Aurour Malfoy?” She asked, eyebrows raised and a slight smile playing on her face. At Draco’s name, Harry smiled.
“Maybe he is having an affair with the US minister.” Contemplated Draco. “I mean he is rather…” He waved his hand around, his brow furrowing. “…Pleasing.” He said delicately.
“I am quite sure you would like to hear about it, Draco.” Harry whispered trying to coax him out of the deep sleep he was in. He touched his bony shoulder gently to shake him. He shook him carefully. Nothing. He shook him again. Still nothing. He shook him a little harder and started to panic. A Medi-Witch came rushing in, looked at the scene that lay ahed and called something into the half lit corridor behind her. Harry was frantically trying to wake Draco from his sleep, shaking his shoulder. One of Draco's hands fell out from under the sheets then hitting the metal bed post with a clang that ran through the room. Everything stilled. Harry looked down at Draco and without thinking he sunk to the floor and threaded his fingers through Draco’s, still willing his eyes to flutter open, knowing it was all in vain. Time became stretched like a piece of gum, because when he lifted his head, his face was wet with tears, the daylight was streaming in and a witch in blue robes was looking cautiously into his eyes and telling him to go home, get some rest. Do you have a family member or friend to check on you? Yes. Do you need us to bring you some coffee for now. No. Ok, we will contact you for further arrangements. Yes. I am sorry, Mr Potter. So am I.
No one said anything for a while, the knowledge that they had almost let Christmas slip away in the forefront of their mind. Blase silently tapped Hermione on the shoulder, making her jump and said,
“I’d count the rows of I was you.” Harry added quietly. Confused, Draco counted and thought about it.
“Igor’s name has been scratched off the wall in Durmstrang and has been replaced with- Let me finish.” Draco said as Harry opened his mouth. He closed his mouth and scraped his hair out of his forehead.
Draco was shaking in Harry’s arms, crying. People brushed past, their eyes glued to the ground. He was shaking all over, a crumpled paper of test results from St Mungos clenched in a sweaty fist.
She hugged Harry, enveloping him in her perfume and easily towering him in her heels. She then turned to Draco and said “I have some bottles of Firewhisky under my desk. Let’s go to yours. You probably have food.”
“I numbed them with the potion. I made it so the death would be painless and easier. You have to understand that I didn’t want to kill anyone. It was the only way. It was the only way! And the potion made it ok Harry. It made it ok.” He said, his eyes growing wider as he looked at all the faces in the room. “They had to die. For you Harry. Only for you. And then I killed them. But they didn’t mind because of the potion. It killed them too but I wanted to make sure because if anyone found out that I’d done I’d be in trouble.” Harry didn’t have to look at him to know the Draco would be raising his eyebrows. “But I wanted you to know it was for you so I-”
“Good thing I’m not going anywhere then.” He murmured. He leaned down and kissed him gently. “Come on.” He said reassuringly. “We both need a shower.”
“Draco.” Harry hissed, taking the blonde’s hand in both of his as he sat up. “Draco, wake up.” He said kissing his knuckle. “Draco. Draco, come on.” He said, starting to panic.
Hope you liked it. Nothing much happens, it's mostly setting up for the next one... which I'm very exited about.
By the end of the day, they had narrowed the identity of the potion down to eight possibilities. As they sat in the pale light, books resting in their hands, eyelids drooping, they decided to call it a day and go home. The dark sky outside seemed too chilling at this point in the evening so they locked up the lab, satisfied with the work completed.
“That’s ok.” Harry replied, the relief that Draco was still alive still buzzing in his veins. They both got up to inspect the pasta. It had indeed been overcooked and was now grey mush.  They silently moved on to look at the tomato, which looked more edible. He took a fork and ate a mouthful with thinking.
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes red and tired but inevitably still beautiful. Harry kissed his forehead.
Draco jumped up and down like an exited puppy. “Ha! Ha HA! I told you! He was fucking him the whole time!” He shouted at the top of his lungs. An old lady gasped and Harry offered her an apologetic glance.
Harry decided to send an owl to Ron, telling him that the couldn’t come in today and that they’d work at home instead. Draco insisted that he was ok, but Harry would hear him sniffing quietly once he had left the room. So he though he’d go on the side of caution just in case.
“So.” He said amused, “either you look like a disco secretary or you look like me but an intellectual.”
“Potter, you’re hopeless. We can get her a tasteful blue stone bracelet.” Harry must have looked doubtful so Draco added, “It will go nicely with her hair.”
He was only in hospital for that evening. He was discharged for bed rest under the watchful eye of a mediwich and Harry. They got to their flat, drank the anti-toxin potion they had given him and he tucked himself under the covers and stayed there for several days. That is, until he finds himself listening to a clip-clop of heels that could only belong to one person.
They all started up the conversation about the ministers sexuality, each of them trading specific insider knowledge to back up their points until Pansy declared that she was going to sleep.
They were all eagerly ripping presents open and Rose was having a great time, hair sticking up everywhere and some jam on her face. They had been slowly making their way through a massive mound of toast and presents all morning.
They stayed like this, silent, tears running slowly off faces until day morphed into night. Neither knew what to say, because they had talked about this moment many times, but they had never really believed that it would get to this. Because magic fixes everything, right?
A soon as they were on the doorstep, Draco squeezed Harry’s hand without looking at him and marched towards the door. Anyone else would have seen a perfectly confident young man striding towards the door, but Harry knew better. He could see the tremble in his hands and his wide, wide eyes.
Silence. He put the phone down, Pansy’s voice still coming through muffled and distant. He needed a little space to think.
Draco quickly shook his head. “Harry,” He said urgently, placing his hands onto if the rough hands on his knees. “The potion. I know. Just hear me out.” He said patiently, silencing Harry. “The ingredients. They could be found at an extremely secure potions supplies shop at a push, but most of that stuff would be found in places like the ministry. There is some hard core shit in this potion Harry. And that can’t really be found anywhere else. Even illegally.” He added with a slight pause.
As the rest of the Aurours appeared at their side, robes flapping in the bitter wind, they started to ascend the steps.
“Merlin fucking Christ alive.” Harry muttered as he stood up and strode to the door. Draco stood there, holding a packet of rice in one hand and a packet of spaghetti in the other.
“Case meeting!” Ron bellowed, as Draco knew that he was right about the owner instaintly. He heard a clatter and thumping for which he expected to be Blaise and Pansy.
But at one point, Harry was in the kitchen and Draco was sitting on the counter silently wrapped in a duvet. As the gryfindoor was clattering about with the pots and pans and trying to create something edible, Draco looked up, and hurriedly said,
“ I don’t often work overtime if I can avoid it. I have other things to do.” He said, looking poniently at Harry who pulled a face of hopelessness. Pansy scoffed into her hand.
“Assemble the team.” Ron said, eyes shining. Harry could tell that he’d been wanting to say that since the first day fo being head auror.
“No. Yes. I mean, oh Merlin Draco.” Harry squeezed his eyes shut as he felt Draco detach himself from him. He knew Harry far too well.
Harry looked to the left at what he could only assume was the sitting room, so to speak. It had dark furniture and big cabinets the Harry was sure that if he looked close enough, he find something illegal.
Ron left, closing the door behind him. Draco and Harry looked at each other like children that had just been told off.
“That’s bullshit, but yes, I’ll cook.” Harry replied. Draco smirked and pulled himself onto a counter top.
“You have that face that you pull when Molly puts a plate of food in front of you that you really don’t want to eat.” Draco commented, unmoving.
He found the blonde leaning on the wall outside  the office door, looking both far too sardonic and attractive to be acceptable. Feeling a smile grow on his face without permission, he fell into step next to Draco and wiped the day from his mind.
They hadn’t moved at all and had no intention of doing so until absolutely necessary. Nether had said anything for a while until Draco nudged Harry, waking him from a light doze.
Once they apparated to Diagon Alley, armed with scarves, hats and gloves, they started the laborious quest to buy presents. Making their way through the snow and weaving through the people, they managed to find most things on their list with the exception of the things that needed to be bought in muggle London and Lucius’s figurines.
Draco had already made comments about the length of Harry’s choice of carrot, lord knows what he’ll come up with next.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Draco.” Harry said impatiently as he took off his glasses  and handed them to the Slytherin. Draco took them and put them on, immersing himself in the book but not quite hiding his smirk. Harry sighed and looked around the now blurry lab.
Ho ho ho it do be gettin' funky doe! And by that I mean, yes, I did actually write more that 500 words. Thank me later. Or not.
He leaned back against the counter, feeling sweat roll down his forehead. The room was too full, the heat making it feel like pressure. He wiped it away with a sleeve and took a deep breath. Blink. Blink again.
“Right, well, unless anyone has anything else to say, the I suggest we all go home and sleep on it and discuss this again in a few days time.” Ron dictated.
The moment he got into the hallway, he started sobbing, big heaving sobs that shook his whole body. He sank to the floor and stayed there. ‘I can’t do this’ he thought ‘I can’t.’ He tried to take some calming breaths, but he ended up with more haptic sobs. He thought about Draco.
“It’s just about the security, Draco. And…” He paused. “It wouldn’t harm ones reputation.” He said reluctantly. Draco was visibly fuming now but Lucius didn’t notice. “And.” He continued. “There is the subject of heirs…”
Harry looked at Draco standing above the quivering body on the floor, his face flushed and body shaking from shouting. He had a sudden pang of protectiveness over him and felt himself thinking, if anything ever happened to him, he would never be able to forgive himself.
“So, this case…” He said, wanting an explanation. There was a general murmur and Hermione for once, looked completely clueless.
“Harry, you should do audio books!” She said loudly and enthusiastically, pushing both her and Draco to burst into giggles.
“Mmmmm.” Harry replied, putting his robes on the back of a chair. He walked over to Draco and put his arms around him.  The Slytherin slowly slipped his hands around Harry’s waist, holding him tight as he rested his chin on Harry’s crazy mop of hair, breathing in his smell.
Draco took it. It was an unwrapped book, and on opening it, they saw all the photos Pansy and Hermione had taken over the year the final one being the one that she had just taken of them.
“Harry? Harry, look at me.” Draco whispered, concern taking hold of most of his face. Harry turned is face from the blond’s shoulder and looked at him, a single tear rolling down his wet face. His eyes were puffy and red, the green in his irises dulled and his nose running a little. He sniffed sadly and looked down at the floor.
“He does look a bit like Harry, Draco.” They looked at Harry who raised his eyebrows at both of them.
They were own the sofa after having made tea and grabbing biscuits. Draco was trying to read but couldn’t because the arsehole needed glasses but refused to even get an eye test because they would, as he always said would ‘ruin his complexion’, which was often followed by a meaningful look at Harry.
“I made it.” He managed. The faces looked at him. “The potion. In the murder. It’s this one. I’m almost certain.”  He squeezed his eyes shut and ignored the burning nausea in this stomach. He could feel them all looking at him.
They walked into the office and found all eyes on them. Blaise sat down next to Ron. Draco sat as far away from Ernie Macmillan as possible and pulled Harry with him.
“We aren’t here for your plates.” Draco said softly, squeezing Harry’s hand. “We would like to buy one of your figurines.”
Harry crawled under the covers, Draco climbing in too, enveloping him in a hug. Harry sighed and they both fell into a deep uninterrupted sleep.
“We have the best trained and most elaborate team on the job and we have got no where! I mean they aren’t even one step ahead of us, they are on a new level above us and taunting us.” His eyes where wide and darting everywhere. He was about to say something but a sudden tapping at the window so they both moved towards it, Draco sliding off the counter and wiping his eyes on his sleeve without thinking.
“I am almost done you impatient twat! Come in if you must.” Was what he got. Harry laughed gruffly in reply.
He put the jar of smooth into the trolley and kissed him on the mouth. Harry kissed back, pulling him in by his shirt.
“We should probably find him then.” Blaise muttered, mostly to himself, fiddling with the hem on his dress.
Draco detached himself and started pouring  the water over the tea bags.  They made the tea, carrying the mugs carefully and putting them in cold hands. Hermione had got the fire roaring softly, emitting the much-needed warmth. Draco and Harry collapsed onto the sofa, Draco pushing Pansy’s legs onto the floor, for which he gained many Slytherin level insults. There was fond silence as they all sipped tea. Draco broke it.
“Fuck.” Draco said as he flopped back onto the bed. “I’d forgotten about that.” Harry absentmindedly bit his lip and put a hand in Draco’s hair.
Harry did, truly, so he took another sip and placed it carefully on the floor before sliding down and joining it. Rose kneeled in the doorway and watched him with barely hidden glee. The first bag was mostly pants and shorts- all Muggle, so they were a mix of khaki and cotton. The second bag was sweaters of all colors, though not white or yellow, and he lingered on a dark green one that was soft to the touch. Thinking about wearing his House colors outside of classes made him smile a bit. The third bag had T-shirts, both solid and patterned, and with more logos he didn't recognize. One of the tees was black with thin green stripes; once again, he got clothes that suited his House. There were socks in the last bag, mostly white but some were darker, and there was a shoe box at the bottom. He glanced up at Rose a moment, feeling overwhelmed, and gingerly removed the box from the bag. She gave him an encouraging smile and a nod, so he opened the box to peer inside. On the tissue paper lay a pair of loafers that looked comfortable enough, even if they seemed a little too big.
He looked at her rather weirdly. "Not sure about the first part, get back to me on that." Rose nodded with a smile. Definitely the son of James, this one. "But, it's okay that it wasn't you. You're here now and, honestly, I trust you more than Hagrid."
"It's the third one," he said, pushing his trolley towards it. Rose watched him stand in front of it awkwardly, then smirked as she grabbed onto the handle.
Rose stood in silent shock. What happened that was so bad? And why didn’t her sister tell her about it? “Are Lily and James alright?” She clutched the necklace made of rose quartz Lily had gotten her as a graduation gift.
In his double classes with the Gryffindors, he noticed a girl who was being left out of practically everything. No one talked to her at meals and she was actively avoided during class, even though she proved to be quite smart. It was after a week that Harry realized it was the girl from the train that had come in with Ronald - and while the boy had made more comments about snakes he seemed to try even harder to exclude her - and he recalled her name was Hermione Granger. Harry didn't like how the lions were excluding one of their own for being different, something that hit a little too close to home for him. So he took to the library - where Granger was rumored to spend most of her free time - and sat himself down at her table. The girl had looked up sharply at him, but Harry ignored her as he took out his Charms notes. Granger stared at him for several moments before turning back to her own work. This became a pattern over the next week, until Granger got fed up with him.
That seemed like a good idea. His aunt was well-versed in sneaky offences like that, and if anyone had sent him an ill-wished present for Yule, she would be able to deal with it. So yes, he nodded to himself, yes indeed. He would get Rose after she awoke.
cloak, that shimmered with magic just like Rose's dress did. The clasp was a deep red and fashioned into a rose as beautiful as his aunt. The witch smiled warmly at her best friend and threw the cloak around her shoulders, pulling her hair up once it was clasped. The rose clasp was somehow the exact shade as Rose's hair, which made Harry grin too.
