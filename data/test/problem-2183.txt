‘– but there is a question, Severus. There is.’
Given how much time Draco was stuck in here, alone, he’d probably spent more than enough time thinking of it, thinking of nothing but it. But he hadn’t asked Harry to do anything before, in fact, he hadn’t really asked Harry for anything but his time. And that was only so he didn’t have to be alone. He wanted to just give this to him, but he had to know it was safe.
There was only one thing left to say.
The Aurors that led him weren’t gentle. They prodded him along with the tips of their wands and one or two well placed Stinging Hexes when he stumbled. Just a little bit long, just keep walking. He knew the halls well, he worked here for almost two years now, they probably wouldn’t like hearing that either.
Vince leapt forward instantly to catch the door, but Draco helped him back.
Harry pulled the Healer apprenticeship offers closer to him and slowly began to fill them out beneath Draco’s smiling gaze.
‘You can’t! You swore you’d protect him.’ He couldn’t let him just walk away, he still needed him, Harry still needed him.
‘If I’d survived the war? You can say it Harry, it’s just a fact, not an insult.’
The door seemed just as reluctant to let him leave, groaning it’s disapproval as it swung open. There were three guards ready to escort him out through the Ministry. All with their wands out, pointed at him. He could feel their magic cracking in the air, ready to go. Not a pleasant sensation.
‘-that’s barely even working in my name-‘ He sighed, they weren’t really listening to him anyway.
‘My mother,’ the line was simple, easy, he’d watched this memory a few times today, making sure he wouldn’t change it, but the conversation felt so false, so flat.
He grit his teeth, casting a wordless silencing charm around him, thanking Merlin that the Hogwarts wards had already fallen as he Apparated to a hidden corner of the room. He’d made Harry show him this memory, he’d needed those final moments of his godfather … now they were more useful than ever. He knew where to hide, he knew what to expect. He might be too late to save him, but at least he was here to try.
Through the fake window of his cell the sun began to rise. He had to assume it matched the actual time of day, at least roughly, or he would have driven himself mad by now. He didn’t know how much longer he’d have to wait. He wasn’t a priority. That’s all they would tell him. They told him it over and over again – it didn’t hold much meaning anymore.
Harry pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot. A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from bottom of it. The tiara shook and then broke apart in his hands with a distant scream. Two Horcruxes left for them to kill then. And Draco had two lives left to save.
How didn’t he remember this? He knew that waiting was hell, but it felt more … frantic last time. Time seemed to slip through his fingers as he awaited Azkaban. This time he knew he was just counting down the time until he could go home. Merlin, he wanted to be home right now.
‘Can't you?’
Lupin walked up to Harry’s side; hand clasped warmly on his shoulder as he pulled him into a hug, quickly joined by a very alive Tonks.
The castle shook as spells pounded against the defences. A great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around; he was taking in the mess of the battle still raging. The battle he was at the centre of but never quite a part of. They could hear screams from where they were, but it was hard to tell where or who they might be coming from. Harry looked panicked.
He always just looked amused.
Harry was edging back toward the tiara he’d been trying to get before. Draco knew now that it was a Horcrux, he didn’t know how he hadn’t felt it at the time, that cold, foreboding power throbbing from it. He couldn’t let him. He knew it had to burn.
‘My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends – the more, the better – but do not kill him.’
"What you are doing here"
Draco looked up. He looked directly into Harry's eyes and  said"Please what Potter? What do you want me to do" asked Malfoy .
Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own.
Harry is currently in St Mungo's . He came here to check upon Kingsley. Upon coming here he saw St Mungo's nearly bursting with people all came here to visit Kingsley . The security guards were really having a hard time in controlling the crowd . He saw many familiar faces.  Everyone either smiled or waved at him . He obviously returned the gesture.  Harry's eyes were scanning the crowd until it rested on Malfoy.  As soon as Malfoy caught Harry staring at him . He began to walk towards him.
Without wasting a single more moment Harry pushed the door roughly and walked straight and barged into Kingsley's office
"Because of you obviously . "
" Wanking you to sleep" . Smirked Draco" Save the discussion for the breakfast table Potter"
"Will you fucking talk Draco Sodding Malfoy, fucking I am missing your bloody smart mouth . Talk to me Draco."
"Err . No . Okay Potter not for long Scorpius will be waiting for me"
"Out" Draco screamed .
Harry is happy now . Ginny and he..... they got divorced . Things are not that bad . Their children really took the whole thing really well. They will stay the whole week with their dad . In the weekend they will stay in the burrow with Ginny and others. Everyone took this lightly.  But Malfoy is becoming his growing problem now . Harry looked at his cock and muttered "Literally  the growing  problem".
"Want to ask me something Potter?" Draco asked Harry as were heading towards the Head mistress's office . Draco's lips were curling into a smirk .
"How do you know everything? Harry how does she knows everything" exclaimed Ron .
"I want ... Ahhha"
Then Harry remembered he had given his memory to Draco.
"I don't know , Harry I deserve all kind of worst, filthy words why my son has to go through horrible things because of me Harry? I am sorry so sorry that I chose to be in the wrong side, but I had to Harry I had no bloody choice.  Harry. I know I deserve the worst but my son ,he doesn't . He is so much better than me Potter . Draco suppressed a sob .
"  I am fine. And so am I" both Ginny and Harry said while smiling at the boy.
*Like what."
"Draco" Harry sobbed . "He is killing all of them .. my mother, Dumbledore...Sirius..
"I can ask you the same question Potter!"
Draco took out a small box and chanted a spell within seconds the small box turned into a big box of various chocolates.
You know Potter It breaks my heart to bid Scorpius farewell. By the way nice speech huh! I never knew you could make up stories after all you are our dearest golden boy"smirked Draco .
"What a male.dic.. "
And then they say a large snake was slithering towards them.
Later Harry joined Draco in the breakfast table. As soon as Harry sat on the table Draco could smell the chocolate bodywash . His freaking favourite bodywash of all time. It makes Potter more edible than ever .
"Please talk to me Draco!? Why ain't you talking."
"Oh yes and meet Ana" Ana say hi to Draco .
"That's is why we need to open ...
"Good morning aurors. Well I have an assessment for you both . Harry and Draco you already know about the red crosses all over the city . We engaged some aurors to locate them and protect the muggles by putting anti-muggle and Muggle Protection charms . And we successfully have located all the houses ... safe houses that's what the aurors are calling them . These houses have strong dark magic and these places are full of dangerous curses. Moreover these houses are uniquely built . They are specially small houses but each contains a trap door which leads to an underground tunnel . Now presently I don't where these tunnels lead because no one had discovered because there are anti wizard protection . I mean ....
"Now before you begin the supper Mr Potter will like to share few words with us." The Headmistress addressed the students .
As they stepped inside the gargoyle
" You had a nightmare "
"Why these carvings are looking familiar to me . Hermione made me memorize something similar to this ."
Draco came running towards Harry . Harry was still trembling.  Draco hugged Harry . And then Harry could feel Draco's lips on his.
Draco started to lick Harry's cock. Harry can't stop his moans now its too much . " Malfoy please"
Draco cut him off and said" yes ofcourse you moron  I like you . Look what you did to my hair." Draco wanted to sneer but he failed miserably and Harry got a expression between a sneer and a smile.
"No! Unless she is the minter of magic mode . " Grinned Harry.
Harry didn't even finish the sentence when he saw Draco putting the time tuner around their neck made three and a half turn.
"Harry ... Harry .. Harry" he could feels two hands shaking him vigorously. Harry squeezed his eyes shut . "Please don't hurt him" .
"Thinking of tutoring you." Ana shot back .
Harry was trapped between the wall and the giant snake.
"So when you are planning to tell Ron? Harry" asked Hermione .
"Enjoy" Whispered Ginny.
"You are Scorpius's father?" Albus asked
"Tea will do and thanks."
Harry started to un-botton his shirt . After he took of his shirt . He felt Draco's hand massaging his tensed shoulder . Then he opened the bottle and a sweet fragrance filled in the whole room . Harry was feeling elated . Draco's hand was doing magic . He could feel  Draco  massaging... caressing him. Harry bit his lip to prevent a moan . He was getting hard . He closed his eyes. He could feel Draco's hands moved towards his chest. Massaging him there . He could feel Draco came in front . Draco kneeled down and started to massage his abs .. chest .... His arms . It was becoming more and more difficult for Harry . Gosh! If this continues he will have an orgasm . He opened his eyes. He saw Draco looking at him .Draco was looking at him with such an intensity.  Green eyes met the sliver . He could see Draco's eyes dilated. Harry was leaned  forward to capture Draco's lips and Draco was moving forward too . They were inches apart . Their lips were inches apart.
While Harry was talking with the giant snake Draco saw there is a small enchanted door just behind the pillar they just walked pass. Leaving Harry with the snake because there was no point listening to them and its more pointless to decipher what they were talking and ofcourse Draco didn't wanted to interrupt Harry and ask him what was the bloody meaning of every word  after each and every sentence. Moreover parseltongue creeps Draco out . Voldemort used to talk with Nagini like this and he always feared he was either planning to kill him or harm any of his family members.  So Draco slowly left Harry's side to examine the door . The door was a normal except there was beautiful carvings on it. Draco had seen these carvings somewhere . He did read about these but he couldn't remember where . Draco stepped forward because he wanted Harry to see this maybe Harry could remember something  but to his horror  he saw the big snake was slithering towards Harry and was opening one of his big giant mouth to engulf Harry . Cursing himself for leaving Harry's side   Draco ran towards Harry without a second thought pointing the wand at the snake and screaming "avada kedavra".  The big snake fell dead instantly . No one can harm Harry , his Potter and with this thought he crushed his lips with Harry's.
"This is the most filthiest places I have ever been .
"Well my dearest princess I am not a magician. But surely I am a good uncle with white hair who loves chocolates as much as you  do".
"DRACO MALFOY WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU." Pansy screamed . Then she stomped into the living room where Harry and Draco was sitting . Harry saw Draco was slightly scared. And was amused . She most probably didn't see Harry because she was focusing to glare venomously at Draco .
"No Mr Malfoy, Scorpius is the most brightest wizard of our batch . He is not only intelligent but sweet and humble."
"Exactly!" Exclaimed Hermione
"Harry" Draco shouted.
Well if you let go of me I would like you to show something since its only three and we have to report to the ministry around five" Harry made a face which was full of disgust "why can't we continue with you know .. "
And then they looked into each other's eyes.  God Malfoy had such intense beautiful silver eyes. It makes Harry breathless.
"Hi Albus...  Dad this is my friend Albus . I told you remember . Albus this is my dad Draco Malfoy " Scorpius said in a very formal way and he kind of hugged Albus back in a very aristocratic way.
PART-II IS ON IT'S WAYY SO YAAY
"Stop this ...stop" screamed Harry .
"Thank you" they both screamed in unison.
*GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM*
"We need to shift him to St Mungo's" said Draco urgently.
‘Potter, I think that’s enough, don’t you?’ There was a chuckle in his tone, even if Malfoy was resisting outright laughing at him.
He was lucky the room understood what he wanted. The junk was falling, the pile was precarious, that spell would have done nothing without the intent. Vince raised his arm to repeat the spell and Draco knew they wouldn’t be so lucky a second time.
The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with dishevelled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.
Even worse that his first stalling technique, but Draco had somehow let him get away with it the first time, so he had to again. He knew the line, even if he didn’t want to say it again.
‘Reactions and volatile combinations of basic bases and cauldron materials in healing potions. Really? You think that will be necessary in the day-to-day training of Auror’s?’ Ron snorted into his food.
‘What do I do about Grimmauld then?’ He tried to ask casually, still filling out details on forms, but Draco’s eyes narrowed as he stared down at him.
‘Ha-’ He didn’t even get the full syllable out before an Incarcerous wrapped around him, he shifted just enough as he was falling to see bright pink hair.
‘You’re … oh …. huh … Okay.’ Wherever he wanted to take the fight died there.
‘Where's Professor Snape?’ Draco glanced down the table offering the third year Slytherin who spoke a smile, loyalty, the snakes knew what it was worth.
A quick glamour and he was back to who he remembered. The gaunt, broken boy he was before the battle. The boy he had never wanted to see again.
‘I have a problem, Severus,’ Voldemort spoke softly, that was the most terrifying of all, he almost sounded … kind.
‘WHAT?!’ He wracked his mind, trying desperately to think of any twins in Slytherin.
Or … he wasn’t … he was just where a Draco Malfoy was married to this Harry Potter … but not him, not really.
‘I love you.’
One life, one life he wanted to save for himself through this mess, and he hadn’t even managed that. A bloodied cough startled him out of his thoughts. Severus’ body shifted, his wand twisting quickly as blue light shimmered and settled over his body. More blood was coughed out, but with each cough his breathing sounded clearer, his body looked stronger with each violent movement.
‘-you would have given anything to escape through the war-’
‘You have fought valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery.
‘Did-’
He was sandwiched between Vince and Greg, both of their wands were trained on Harry. Harry’s eyes saw the threats first before finally locking with his. His heart raced as green eyes met grey, but there was none of the recognition he was used to. They were hard, angry, none of the love he thought was a constant there now. He grit his teeth, he had another line here, he had to get through it.
‘-Still, if one of us was meant to die in the war it should have been me. It was bloody prophesised after all. I mean, I walked in there knowing I was going to die … you … you did whatever you could just to live.' Harry gestured hopelessly at his translucent figure.
If it was his timeline then everything he’d lived from the morning of the war was lost, being rewritten.
How was this his life? Yes, okay, with the power of hindsight along with a safe haven right now, following the Dark Lord might go into the ‘bad idea’ category. But there had been extenuating circumstances. He deserved a trial. A fine. Maybe jail time. MAYBE a tiny bit of time in Azkaban. But NOT THIS!
Then it was over.
He sighed, his form physically drooping and looked slightly paler than it had been at the start. Malfoy took another deep breath, he didn’t need it, they both knew it was habit rather than necessity, but that moment seemed to give him enough strength to look up. To meet Harry’s eyes again.
‘Do I?’
‘Ahh … Draco … I guess today’s the day then? Shit.’
‘Is that uncomfortable? Even second hand, liking me must be a novel experience.’
Draco threw it back across him.
Why did he have to save them? Why did he give a shit?
There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.
‘Nah, we couldn’t agree if it was the first or second so that would just make things confusing.’ It was just a damn name; did it really matter?
It was the first time he’d ever heard fear from the other boy and all he could do was clutch him closer to his side as they wove their way across the battlefield. He prayed to whatever power he believed in that in his rush to save the people that mattered most to Harry he hadn’t killed one of his best friends.
Harry groaned, letting the door slam behind him as he walked in to collapse on the bed. The sheets were soft, there were even bloody rose petals beneath him and the soft floral scent on the air, cut with the warmth of the log fire.
‘Anything else! ANYTHING!’
Draco tightened his grip on the metal, nodding slightly as he let Severus Apparate away. What he wouldn’t have given to have this those first years after the war. Although, he supposed now he did have it through those years- or would have it- would have had it- will have had?
He sat down at the Gryffindor table, eyes no longer searching out the silver pair across the hall. He knew where they were, he’d seek them out as soon as the others were asleep. Hermione thought this meant he was getting better. Finally over his obsession and his guilt.
‘Huh?’ Harry could see a gap down the front of his shirt. Weird concept given that all of his was see through but they were separate layers of invisible, and the collar bone through the top of the shirt was new, caught his focus in a way he hadn’t really experienced before.
Harry’s words were faint, but he could still hear him behind him.
Someone at the Hufflepuff table stood and shouted; ‘And what if we want to stay and fight?’
'What?' Draco spun around, not for the first time Harry wondered what the hell he did in this room on his own.
He shrieked and ran from the room.
He woke up with a gasp, sweaty, twisted in his sheets, clinging to his had which still felt like it burnt.
‘I wasn’t sure I’d get the chance … but I’m glad I did. It’s a portkey, will take you to wherever I am. I’m still your godfather- if you ever need me …’
Crabbe outstripped all of them, looking terrified. Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them, leaving Draco dragging Greg along well behind them. He wanted to scream out to them, wanted to beg for help, but he bit through his lip to stop himself. If they paused they were all dead. He let them fade out of sight, moving as fast as he could with the added weight at his side.
Draco gestured for him to be quieter, but Blaise just stared at him.
He should have thought this through before he made any changes. But, Merlin, they were just so ALIVE, and it was real, and-
‘Too hard to say in a rush, no matter how entertaining it would be to yell out in bed.’ Draco could have done without imagining that called out.
Malfoy had stretched out for him, slipping as the pile he was on fell away beneath his feet. He knew what had been in his eyes in the second, terror and hope. They were easy. Then there was Crabbe, scuttling up the heap of junk to his side.
‘Did you know ghosts can sleep?’ He hummed, Harry looked up to see him laying on his stomach, flicking the same page backwards and forth.
He tried to take his usual calming breath as he walked inside, but he chocked on some thicker ash, the weird breeze that flowed through the room going in just the wrong way to welcome him in.
‘Sorry Ron, I think some time alone in the castle is exactly what I need for the holidays. Get my head cleared out a bit, you know?’ He locked eyes with Ron until he got an understanding nod.
Harry closed his eyes, imagining he could feel the warmth of Draco’s skin under his touch, and lent forward. Godric, he wanted it so bad, he could practically feel the huff of Draco’s breath against his lips.
‘I love you.’ He whispered in return. ‘It doesn’t change anything though, does it?’
Ahhh … shit. Of course, that was another dig at something Draco should have. He was doing so well at torturing him about the life he was missing today.
‘You’re rambling, Malfoy.’ Harry huffed, chewing the end of his quill as he stared back at his potions homework, trying to focus.
Thankfully there was silence across from him. When he looked up Malfoy was watching him with a cocky, knowing grin. He felt his cheeks heat, the stupid grin widened, but he still didn’t speak. Harry hid his face behind a book, glad the serious conversation was over, but this didn’t feel much better. His heart was thumping against his ribs as he read the same three words over and over again, feeling the gaze on the top of his head.
‘You can’t send me there!’ He leaned against the edge of his bars as though the closer he could get to the Head Warlock, the louder he could scream the words, the more likely they were to listen.
NOT A BEDROOM.
'For starters it sounds like you’d do more with it-’
‘We're gonna be rewarded,’ or maybe they would, Vince’s voice cut through his thoughts, he sounded so excited, so proud of following the orders of a mad man.  ‘We 'ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to 'im.’
He snorted. Dumbledore’s voice, mush better.
‘Fucking leave Harry …’ Draco murmured under his breath. He couldn’t risk getting in Harry’s way, not yet at least.
His hand settles on the burnt door, swinging it open, eyes closed as he stepped inside and breathed in a lungful of the ashy air. Over the past few months this had become something of a comfort for him.
So bloody what?
That meant he was doing this alone. He nodded, walking over to Blaise’s bed. Yup, just him. He poked the sleeping boy in the ribs, ignoring the swat and the growl.
‘What-?’
Harry keeps returning to Draco in the Room of Requirement. Bit by bit all the parts of his life fall into place with his help, leaving only one, crutial thing, missing.
The swear sounded strange from his mouth, there was a slight humour in the way he mimicked Draco in the words though, a side of Severus he’d never seen. But what the hell did that mean?
He needed someone other than the precious Chosen One to talk to. Someone else to get information from who he could actually get through full conversations with. Someone worth conversing with. Someone who he didn’t want to punch after a few words and wasn’t constantly on the verge of laughing at him.
‘That’s what friends do.’ They finished perfectly in unison.
Draco didn’t move towards it, his eyes followed it for a moment then moved back to Harry, he’d get his answers directly from him.
‘Fine, fuck it, Baby Draco is fine.’
A few more days and whatever they had, whatever this was, would have to be over.
‘Save Crabbe.’ Simple, honest and making it a brutal enough question that Malfoy winced.
But he’d referred to the damn Weasleys as his friends. What other response was there?
‘And how the hell do you know that?’
Harry had walked away from Ginny when there was a chance that they would lose each other through the war. This time he’d fallen for someone that there was no option other than to lose. It was Draco. This wasn’t meant to happen.
‘Not everything revolves around food.’
‘Malfoy?’ Even over the shrieks of the flames he could hear that deferential, confused, trusting tone. But there was no fucking way he’d do it. He was here to save Malfoy, and Malfoy knew how to survive if nothing else.
Creevey, he was another name he recognised from the list of dead from today, she obviously wasn’t stern enough. He glanced back, to watch Harry settle in with the group of red hair. His resolve strengthened with that one glace. He’d save who he could, he had his list, he could do this for Harry.
Crabb was still in bed when he got back to the room. Maybe it was better if he didn’t come with him … Goyle had calmed down a lot after the war and he had no doubt that Crabb would have too, if he’d had the time. But he wasn’t there yet, he was probably safer if he just got caught up in the student evacuation with the rest of them.
He was dragged out of the court room. None of them wanted to hear any more from him. He just had to hope it was somehow enough.
‘Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.’
As Severus’ eyes settled back on Voldemort his face was set in a waxy-ashen white. He knew. There was no question of how this was going to play out. He tried one last time, but his eyes were blank, there was no hope, he was just going through the motions he thought were required before death.
Harry pointed his wand at the rampart and cried, ‘Finite!’
Slightly charred around the edges, but it was cold when he touched it. If there was once a fire on the other side, it was out by now.
He stood up, pulling his bag with him.
Harry tried not to look at the Slytherin table.
‘I’d like to think that’s what I’d do, but really, I’d probably cave to what my Father wanted. I always do.’
‘We was hiding in the corridor outside,’ grunted Goyle, thank Merlin Draco had taken the time to work on his elocution after this, he could barely handle it now. ‘We can do Disslusion Charms now! And then, you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What's a die-dum?’
Only one more person he knew for sure died after this and he couldn’t get in the way of Harry’s death.
‘They’re on holiday. I don’t even know if the owl will reach them.’ Who the hell was
His legs gave way beneath him, and he crumpled to the plush floor. Cheeks streaked with tears. He couldn’t- he just couldn’t-
Draco’s breath caught as he saw the flames roaring behind him. This was the moment of moost of his nightmares. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch. They were hungry, they were wild, they were death.
A few more stilted conversations and subtle (whatever Potter may say) observation (not admiration) and he gave in.
‘Okay, we’ll move away from that then. Draco Junior?’ That was the one missing an ear, which one was that?
‘I promise Hermione we’d look at these together.’
She glanced at Snape's body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed quickly after her then Harry with his Invisibility Cloak clutched in his arms and the flask in one hand.
‘Whatever you do, keep her away from Bellatrix.’ He hissed, shoving him out of the hideaway.
‘If you’re staying, then you’re staying for me. No questions or arguments until this thing is over. If you have a problem with that then I don’t have time for you, and you should get out of here now.’
It seemed to be enough for now though, they dropped the topic and he managed to make it through the rest of the feast in relative peace. The whole table seemed to decide as one when it was time to leave and the procession of Gryffindor’s made their way to the common room. Ron and Hermione lingered just outside the portrait.
‘Crucio.’
In actual fires you get down low. In a fire where you were counting on a boy who hated you to fly back to catch you, you climbed. Ignoring the pain in all your limbs, ignore your lungs not getting enough air, ignore the junk ripping at your knees and hands as you scramble up them. None of it matters. You just fucking climb.
Sure, Harry had missed them, but they’d been happy, they’d had a good life. Now there was no guarantee he could get back to that. No guarantee it was there waiting for him.
He sighed, waiting at the barred door while the Auror kept fiddling with his keys. As though, if he just took long enough, someone would come in to change their mind. But no one came and eventually the cut metal made it to the lock.
‘Good plan,’ Harry groaned in mock admiration, there was some of the humour he knew and loved, sarcasm from a Gryffindor was precious, he tried not to smile.
Here. Alive. Trans-fucking-lucent. A ghost then. Not alive.
‘RUN!’
How was he here? It was meant to be the war today; he was meant to be there. Not that he was complaining exactly about missing it, but it was where he was meant to fucking be!
Once the crimes were listed they asked the one question they had. The only question he was permitted to answer after his war crimes. Everyone in the room knew the answer but still it was asked.
‘We thought you might need some friends …’ Fred added cautiously.
He thought of the Room of Lost Things, but there was nothing from that he needed. It was hard to keep it set in his mind without that desire.
If they held the same idea of loyalty as Vince had then that wasn’t very promising. But he was hardly going to point that out now.
‘Fine.’ He turned, his robes sweeping behind him.
‘Potter! Shit! Breathe!’ Malfoy-ghost-Malfoy reached out, his hand sinking through Harry’s shoulder. He felt like someone had dropped ice right down his spine. No, they’d injected it into his bloodstream.
Thank Salazar for that.
‘The second you slip up, we’ll have you. Everyone here knows you should be in Azkaban and we’ll get you there.’
‘Right,’ Harry voice came out croaky and deep, he cleared his through before continuing, ‘I’ll keep my eyes out for that then …’ He could feel the warmth on his cheeks and hated knowing what that must look like, he tried to think of the next topic he could.
He wanted to tell him he didn’t need it. He wanted to tell him that it was already destroyed. But maybe Harry needed to see it to believe it. He couldn’t change anything.
Harry hummed, looking around the room. It was a terrible place really. He could admit that. He just always felt so relaxed when he was here that he’d never really stopped to think about it.
He threw the pile to the side, rolling over onto his back and staring at the ceiling. It was a good idea to update their room, this carpet was much nicer to roll over. Draco was reading each of the sheets over his shoulder and clicking his tongue or shaking his head or twenty other reactions that he deemed subtle, and Harry deemed infuriating.
‘I’ll call them. I’ve tried to contact Severus too-’ that was a weird name to hear out of Potter’s mouth, ‘-but he hasn’t responded. I couldn’t tell him everything. You were both always pretty shady on what he actually knew. I figure you’d be comfortable with him though?’
Harry had reached out before he knew what he was doing, fingertips bathed in the feeling of ice and Malfoy gliding away from him before he caught himself.
‘I wouldn’t have saved him. I was never that kind of hero.’ He tested the thought, he’d never said something like that out loud, Malfoy looked confused, but didn’t look like he was judging him.
They slid into the room, Greg and Vince as calm as anything, grinning at their success in their mission and knowing they had the Golden Trio cornered. Draco almost doubled over, clutching at his chest to try to control his breathing, his hands shaking. The first time he’d come out of the battle the one good thing he could say was that he wasn’t a murderer. A few hours on the side of light and that claim was taken away from him. Fuck! He had to be stronger than that to keep moving though. This moment was important. He could hear the movement of the other three searching the room, but better than that, he remembered where they’d found Potter.
He’d been through all this. He remembers this morning. The war. The clean-up. The hatred. The grovelling. And then … Harry.
Shit.
Our Dracos settle into their times, gain allies and find out about the baby!
‘Ginny, what?’ He asked carefully, moving slightly around so Harry came further into the room to shadow him.
It couldn’t be them. Could it?
In his arms Fred twisted around, staring at Draco’s dirty, bloodied face.
‘Invite my friends over.’ He demanded, not quite how he intended to start the conversation, but Potter just looked amused.
‘I don’t have a problem with her, that’s the issue. They keep telling me to get back together with her and I can’t think of a reason not to.’ His eyes latched back on the letter, as if it had answers rather than questions, as though he could will it to change.
‘...evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point.’
‘Why did you do it?’ His voice didn’t shake, even though his breath was trembling.
He remembered that moment, he might be friends with the man now, but in this second, Salazar he hated the boy.
Snape’s fingers were slipping against the blood at his throat, trying desperately to slow the bleeding. Harry was useless where he was, it should be Draco by his side, but this was another moment. One of the ones he couldn’t fucking stop. So, he watched, doing nothing as his godfather died.
Shit, he was already royally fucking this up. There was no time for that though. The walls trembled with the first volley of spells as the Death Eaters broke through the first barrier. He locked eyes with Blaise.
‘Ahhh … well …’ Eloquent Potter, really impressive control of the English language. ‘We kinda knew that- what I mean to say is-’
. The door appeared the first time he passed it, it knew him well.
‘Alright then. Out of the kindness of my heart I’m willing to help with that.’
‘But-’ he cut them off before they could celebrate the victory, ‘I need to know what happened.’
‘You should have died in the war! Harry and I would be together-! It shouldn’t be like this!’ He gasped out,
How could he get together with Harry from a fucking prison cell? How could he survive with the dementors draining him … how could it survive? His hand clutched at his stomach.
He wasn’t sure how long it was of throwing shields over his shoulder and flinging out any curse that came to mind at whoever was attacking him. He wasn’t sure which side he was fighting against most of the time. As long as they weren’t the one he was hunting for and they didn’t have orange hair, he really didn’t care who got hit by his spell. Blaise seemed to fling out his with even less concern for who it hit.
Harry remained kneeling at his side, staring down at him. Broken from the stupor when Voldemort’s voice echoed through the room once more. His voice ringing through the whole battle once more, those still alive at least.
‘Harry, this is our final year, you have to take things seriously. Covering all the subject you need to be an Auror won’t help if you don’t want to be an Auror-’
Finally, he heard it, the crazed shout of Dolohov calling out “Crucio” and the calm “Stupefy” from his old Professor. How this side won with their bloody morals holding them back honestly astounded him. Of course, he knew the man he ran towards wouldn’t win, not this one, not this time.
‘-now you have, and you’re just complaining?’
He should have put it together earlier. There were a lot of different theories on time travel, and he’d done extensive research into all of them. There were two basic building blocks of how it could go. The alternate dimensions theory where going back and changing anything immediately created a new reality so the one you left would play on from where you left it and a tangential one was started where you made the first change. Or looped or butterfly effect, where you step on a butterfly in the past and suddenly don’t exist.
‘Malfoy, your parents were both sentenced to Azkaban …’ He explained gently, a softer tone than he’d ever expected from either of the twins.
Draco climbed onto Harry’s broom, arms wrapped around him, clinging for his life and relishing the familiar feel of him in his grip. They’d make it, if nothing else he hadn’t killed anyone new in this room.
‘Nothing’s
After that he’d died and he thought that was fair. Then he came back and one of the first words he heard was his name.
The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams.
‘'Must mean'?’ Crabbe turned on Draco with undisguised ferocity. ‘Who cares what you think? I don't take your orders no more, Draco. You an' your dad are finished.’
He spun and practically launched himself on his friend, ignoring the thick arms trying to shove him off. He was alive! Of course, he was … that meant today really was … the day …
Ahh yes, that moment, of all the times to stand against him he had to choose now.
Voldemort continued to move around the room, almost circling Severus, waiting to attack his prey like a shark, or a vulture. When he spoke again it was in the same measured voice. From Severus’ flinch there was far more to it than that.
‘IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU, HARRY!’ A great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, but Ron and Hermione dragged Greg onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more.
‘That's my wand you're holding, Potter,’ he raised his own wand in the gap between his two guards, he hoped no one else could see how it trembled in his hand.
‘We … ahh … are just going for a little walk, okay Harry?’ Hermione managed to keep a straight face despite her blush.
-Images of his father back handing Draco, 8-yrs, in the face for ripping his clothes whilst tree climbing.  Draco crying in his room, confused about the changes that were happening but unable to stop them.
Harry had finished washing, and had just started brushing his teeth, when…
’ Harry though, coughing once as he looked away. People always said he had some shocking green ones, but he didn’t think his were anything special.
of January… five weeks away. He really didn’t want to wait that long; leaving Draco to believe that Padfoot was going to sweep him away in some romantic notion, while denying any feelings for him/Harry, was almost crippling him with guilt … but he felt that Silas was more important than his own personal matters right now, and there was no way this would work if Draco wasn’t on speaking terms with him. So… he checked his letter one last time before sending it off.
Draco held Harry, shocked to witness the raven-haired man sobbing and shattered on the bathroom floor. Harry didn’t break down! Harry was strong! But right now, Harry was sobbing on his shoulder and holding onto him so tightly that it hurt.
“At least tell me why. Maybe we can go someplace else?” Harry’s mind was working overtime to try and figure out what had spooked Draco, but nothing was coming to mind – or at least, nothing was coming to mind quickly enough.
“Mathews?” Harry asked, knowing if any of his student were so reckless it would be Benjamin Matthews.
“You’re ‘ery han’some.” Draco murmured, his eyes still closed … but then he groaned and opened his eyes.
Seamus: "'ey 'arry! 'ave you seen the daily prophet? Sickening ... really. I thought you'd be better then dat - snogging a death eater. You as welcome 'er as he is."
“No.” Harry shook his head, putting the mug back down. “It usually only happens once or twice a month, if that. I don’t know what’s up with me lately.” Harry chuckled – trying to play it off as unimportant, but then he sighed and looked slightly troubled. His brow frowned and his eyes unfocused as he thought about the increase in his episodes. He tilted his head and scratched at his hairline.
Harry knew that the next big story was a reporter’s means to put food on their table, and to provide for their family - it was a race to be the first in gaining such news worth information or risk losing their job, but Harry refused to allow this man to use Draco’s past as wages.
-Tuesday, 29th September. During charms lesson, Draco slips Harry a note. 'Fancy a walk Potter? Great lake, 4:30pm. DM.'
-Harry's hands move over Draco's scars.
-Draco looks at the news article with Harry, one last time, before leaving his room.
“That, I can do. I will write to mother tomorrow.” Draco went to get up, but then he frowned. “I never saw Auntie Walburga’s portrait during the tour of this
Harry couldn't help the small smile that donned his lips as they continued their walk. Draco didn't pry much, didn't ask many questions, and he knew when to change the subject. It was like a weight had been lifted though, having someone else know his secrets made it easier to breath - even if it was Draco that shared his burdens. For some reason, he trusted Draco with his secrets.
Not really focusing on his steps, he crashed straight into someone.
. At least Draco was no longer shouting though, not now the tables were turning onto him instead.
“Draco calm down! Breath…” Harry kept encouraging the man to mimic his breathing and calm down. It seemed to be working, Draco was responding to his voice at least… but Harry wanted to hold him and rub his back or something, take away his pain and discomfort, only, he didn’t want Draco to react badly … or worse.
Harry’s mind had gone from Regulus to Sirius in an instant: the locket, Grimmauld Place… the department on mysteries…
Harry shook his head; it was giving him a headache just thinking about it.
Draco: "Oh alright. Firstly ... Hermione ... well you and her really, were both raised with muggles. I've noticed
Draco nodded, wondering if something had changed in the girl’s home life… or perhaps it
If he agreed to meet Draco before then, to reveal his true identity, there was a massive chance that Draco would refuse to talk to him again. Yes, he
play it, and perhaps his new feelings for Potter were simply a strong sexual attraction – something enticing because it was new and exciting, and something that he’d get over once things grew with Padfoot… he certainly hoped so.
“Minerva would like to see you when we get back from Hogsmeade.” Draco shouted so that Harry would hear him.
Harry rubbed a hand down his face, sighing deeply. He needed to get back to his work, stop thinking of Draco for now, and stop thinking of the past… but then a house elf popped into his room loudly and startled him.
Draco had stopped just ahead of Harry. He regretted his last words. He'd begged Harry for a chance and now he'd ruined it. He turned to see Harry, watched as he turned around and walked away from him. The look in Harry's face broke his heart, and his feet started following him automatically.
As for Draco, well, he had helped Harry out with Kaison’s gift as promised, but he hadn’t been spending as much time in Harry’s company. He stayed for maybe half an hour when he returned from Diagon Alley on Thursday – checking that Harry was reassured in his ability to buy gifts for a baby, and yesterday they’d had coffee half an hour before attending the Great Hall for dinner together. After dinner, Draco had gone back to his own rooms, only to spend the rest of the evening writing to Padfoot.
Draco: "Are you serious? Why else would I sing in front of Potter?"
-Her foot crushed the creepy bug beneath her shoe.
Harry bit his gum, thinking it over for a moment, and then nodded. He'd come this far, it seemed safe and anonymous enough that no one would know it was Harry Potter 'The-Boy-Who-Lived-Twice'. His previous dates had been more interested in his fame then in him - a fame Harry hadn't chosen nor wanted.
“I don’t mind helping. If that’s what your mother really wants then I’ll look into it, but I’ll need your help. I really don’t know how all that stuff works.”
“Kreacher. I would appreciate it very much if you could get Mr Malfoy safely to his rooms. I fear we drank too much fire whiskey.” Harry explained. Kreacher bowed again, muttering nonsense, and then he walked over to take Draco’s wrist. Harry had fears of Draco falling down the stairs – moving stairs at that.
Harry exited the bathroom - in his black cotton, long sleeved pyjamas after his shower, and climbed into bed. He opened the draw of his bedside table and pulled out the charmed parchment and quill, smiling when another message had appeared.
-Draco uses a mild Bedazzling hex to temporarily blind Ginny, causing chaos in the common rooms.
I'll give my all to you
Traitorous tears pooled in Harry’s eyes as he blinked. He had never been thanked in such a way before; most people thanked him for being a hero, giving him credit for the things he’d never even done - and never showing their gratitude towards others who had also played a part in winning the war.
Draco: "You want to talk about..."
passing on my message first of course. It’s the Gryffindors and the Hufflepuffs that I find need the extra time to gather their wits about them. Unless Harry makes an appearance soon, I fear that there will be chaos amongst the cats this morning.”
-Draco crashes their lips back together.
"Teddy never asks for anything," Harry elaborated, "he's a good kid, and he understands that Andromeda only has so much money." They approached the desk to join the queue – only one person in front of them, a blond-haired lady in a fur coat just concluding her sale with the cashier. They were lucky, the shop seemed to be rather full with shoppers.
“Slytherins unorganised? Merlin help us the day that happens. I’m sure you will find the time to round up any Slytherin stragglers mind you …
-He then flees into his bedroom.
Harry: "I think i'd understand more then you realize."
Molly: "ENOUGH! Ginevra Molly Weasley. You're barely seventeen! I thought your father and I had raised you with more sense than this. I can't believe my only daughter would be so stupid. What on earth possessed you to-"
Councilor: "You can try and manipulate me young man, but I won't be fooled. You're lost are not? Stuck between what you've known your whole life, and what you want to become - but you're judged for your past, stuck there and struggling to take the next step forward. Might I even dare to say, scared, unable to trust, and unsure of what your are now?
-A random student appears, singing into his ear creepily.
“Mmm. Sorry for intruding on you unannounced Potter -- Harry, but there was something I wished to discuss with you. Mind you, it might be nothing to worry about.” Draco sipped at his coffee, but Harry could see the slight frown he tried to hide. Draco appeared concerned or worried. This was Draco in a serious mood.
There was no way in hell that he’d be able to go back to sleep tonight!
He finally calmed down enough to think on his reply, and he could either kill the seed of doubt he’d placed into Draco’s mind and say that his wand-work was above average, or he could have fun with it. He eventually decided to do both.
-Image of Dudley beating him badly, then behind shoved into the cupboard under the stairs like it was his fault.
Draco: "Please don't *Draco shuddered at the memory* I'll stick to Potter. If I feel so inclined to do so, am I to assume you wouldn't be opposed to Harry?"
Just a heads up my dear readers - this chapter is 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 long.
- 17th September 9am, Harry walks into herbology and stares at Draco - who ignores him, then he shakes his head and sits with Hermione and Ron in defeat.
“Yes. Right!” Auror Graves seemed to remember himself again. He sat back down and started his line of questioning.
“Unless you plan on aiding me in the shower…” Fuck – Draco thought, wrong choice of words! “Which I sincerely warn you against even thinking about, then I suggest you move away from the door.”
Draco looked back down at the catalogue. "Explain to me, why do…" His lips brushed Harry's ear as he whispered, making Harry shiver, "…muggles have multicoloured toilet seats?" He pointed to the image.
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Hermione dragged Harry by the arm and Ron pushed Draco forwards to get a move on.
Despite his worry regarding Draco’s health and wellbeing, the action of dressing Draco – even just his socks – made him think of undressing the man … and wasn’t that just fucked up! Even though it was a fleeting image, a secret desire he’d had for weeks, he felt betrayed by his mind that it would remind of that
“Draco!”
Harry was a divinity in his own right, an icon of hope, and a symbol of triumph and peace. Harry was the dawn that drove away the night, the warmth that could melt glaciers, and an addiction that wouldn’t abate.
“You invited me to get a drink, it is only customary for the one that makes the offer to pay the bill.” Draco smirked. “It is too late to revoke your offer now Potter, so I will see you at lunch.” With that, Draco nodded and closed his door.
Harry sent a boiling spell at the snow under Draco’s boots, causing Draco to lose his focus on the spell as he jumped away from the now boiling water. Harry used that few seconds, to free himself and get back to his feet – wand brandished or the next round of friendly attacks.
"…ry, Harry?" Draco knew that Harry was in one of his mind hazy episodes, but it worried him. What had trigger it this time? Was he just remembering having his leg sewed up? Could it be that 'stitches' were, despite what Harry said, just as horrible as he assumed?
Seamus: "Flipendo!"
Ron: "Oi, its Ron! especially to you, you git."
Sitting on his bed, Draco had just finished the most nerve-racking letter to Padfoot…
Harry: 'You sure you don't want to play Dray?'
It was tiring work, and he soon decided to take a break. He sat on his bed - his head against the headboard, his coffee to his left on the bedside table, and he pulled out the magical parchment and quill from the draw. Smiling when he saw the new message, he eagerly read the words.
“Sir?” Miss Leona Adair looked offended. “It was a mouse! They carry diseases, plagues, and-”
“Potter!” Draco spat as he lowered his mug with a thump. He leaned across the wooden table. “It is none of your business!” Draco’s whispered annoyance was weaved with embarrassment and self-contempt, but Harry knew no anger was truly aimed at him.
He flicked his wand, levitating and manipulating the tables and chairs once again as he tried to form a semicircle this time.
-They turn to look at each other again, taking each other's hands. Eyes only for each other.
“A mouse, actually!” Filius Flitwick added, nodding from a few seats up in his modified – raised chair. He wasn’t angry, but a little disappointed. “That was quite an unnecessary commotion from you too Miss Adair.” Filius address his first year Ravenclaw with a shake of his head.
“Probably because there is.” Harry sighed. When Draco sat on the edge on of his desk – looking down at him, he stood up. “I refused to accept him for N.E.W.T level defence against the dark arts. I knew he had the potential, but I had to give him an ‘acceptable’ in his O.W.L.s. On top of that. I always had to remove him from class – every lesson he managed to send another student to the hospital wing, and his essays where always opinionated instead of based on facts. Not to mention, that some of them, were borderline dark in nature.”
Harry: "You're a cunt Malfoy! An Ice cold Death eater, and a fucking heartless bastard!"
-Draco looks Harry up and down.
“Yes, Mr Potter!” Echoed around the class room.
Silence.
“Okay.” Samuel sighed, hesitating just a few seconds longer. “It was Mr Monero … and Mr Cray too, I think.”
Harry: "I've got it Mione, I've done it before."
Harry had cared for him, been there through his illness, and oh how he hated him for that… for now he couldn’t deny that he was doomed – he just couldn’t imagine feeling this way for Padfoot. He could settle for the mystery man behind the words, and indeed, he did feel a great attraction to him, but he suspected that what he’d deprived himself of feeling thus far, was far too great to ever let go off; his heart may never let go of Harry bloody Potter, not now that it had tasted the forbidden fruit.
Harry took a deep breath, readying his nerves for part two of his plan. Hopefully his question would keep Tau distracted long enough.
As he reached his private chamber and opened the door, he decided that all he could do was play the game. For now, he would continue to be two people – Padfoot on parchment, and Harry otherwise. He would see where it led.
Draco had just entered Harry’s private rooms at Hogwarts, and he took his usually seat in the left Armchair.
Harry sent his message. Butterflies danced in his stomach as he grew impatient for the reply. It wasn't long ago that he complained about using a dating service, feared it viewed him as desperate, but now look at him ... he was acting ridiculously. Tau might not even reply tonight, he could have fallen asleep or he might be busy.
When Harry glanced at the magical parchment the next morning, he expected it to be blank. His heart whooped childishly however, when he saw a new message upon the parchment, a smile instantly taking over his lips as he started to read.
Harry: "I don't need this! It's been less than an hour Malfoy! An hour! If we can't even last that long than it obviously won't work between us!"
-Draco turns and they softly kiss - hands cupping each other's cheeks tenderly. When they part Draco wraps his arms around Harry from behind, resuming their stargazing.
“Oh, really. I thought it was through the closet. Good thing you came and steered me in the correct direction.” Harry quipped sarcastically.
-Friday 22nd: Draco's room. Looking over parchment from the ministry regarding Draco's vaults and the manor. Draco looks disheartened, Harry takes his hand and smiles softly. Draco nods, and they resume.
I hear it all could flood
-Night time: Harry tossing and turning in bed agian - thinking of Draco.
Harry shrugged at Ron, just glad he agreed to give Draco a chance. Ron was even happy that he weren't snogging his sister anymore, but every time they were alone Ron would ask the same question - 'Why Malfoy?' In Ron's eyes, Harry was famous and could have any blond man he wanted. Harry even had to deal with the theatrics  .... 'But Harry - mate, it's a disaster. I can't have that git as a brother. It'll kill me. In fact ... I'm getting ill just thinking about it.' Ron proceeded to groan on the bed - like he was dying.  Yeah he'd had it all, but Ron had settled down to snide remarks and scoffs, with the occasional 'i'm watching you Malfoy' look.
He heard a snort of amusement from his right, and he turned his head to see the blond helping himself to the double chocolate gateau.
Malfoy was still pale, but his complexion now leaned more towards healthy smooth and fair - instead of necromancy white and straight out of a horror film. Draco also had stubble, and his hair was still platinum blond - but it was clean and almost shoulder length. It looked good on him. Perhaps the most shocking change was that Malfoy smiled at Headmistress McGonagall a few times, wasn't snarky or rude when joining in with the staff discussions, and seemed very attentive to the meeting. Harry couldn't help but wonder – 'Was this all some façade to get the potions position?'
Draco waited for Harry to come back, but he slowly grew confused. Wasn’t his father in prison? Wasn’t he just a vile, corrupted Death Eater now? Tearing back the sleeve of his pyjamas, he stared at the fading dark mark there – the confirmation that he was indeed tainted. That mark represented who he really was, the darkness that flowed in his veins, the errors of his past… he didn’t want it!
-Wednesday 20th. Harry and Draco find themselves alone in the common room. Harry blocks Draco's door so he can't ignore him.
“Hey Draco, how are you feeling?” Harry asked, unsure to which Draco he would get today.
“I suggest…” Harry stared, trying not to blush with all the attention now on him. Quickly climbing up onto the nearest chair. “…That all the Slytherins move to that wall…” Harry pointed, and used a spell to send green sparks in the correct direction. “…That the Gryffindors move to that one…” Pointing again, but with red sparks this time. “…Ravenclaws to the wall where the teachers table would be normally be...” Pointing with blue sparks. “… And the Hufflepuffs will gather in the middle.” Harry finished, showering yellow sparks over the centre of the great Hall.
Entering his private rooms near the defence against the dark arts classroom, Harry threw his satchel down on the bed.
Harry managed to make a loud noise of confirmation.
. “Yeah, let’s get going.”
They lean in closer, lips meet in an unsure kiss, and then ... a tsunami of emotions fuel their unspoken desires, everything speaking volumes without the need for words.
Light!
Draco
Harry, completely frozen to the bone, started laughing; Merlin he was exhausted! He collapsed to his knees in surrender.
Harry hesitated to describe the rest.
As he glanced up at Harry again, he couldn’t help but blame his father for dealing the cards that had inevitably stolen his chances today, to explore and admit the feelings he was developing for one Harry Potter. In fact, and he sneered at the thought, it was his father’s upbringing that had inevitable caused his rivalry with Potter in 1991; his beliefs, his holier-than-thou attitude, and his narcissistic nature … were all thanks to his sire’s misguided beliefs of what, and how, one should teach their only child.
His fingers continued to fumble together as he waited, and he wondered why he was so nervous this time around. He didn’t want to impress Draco, per se, but he also didn’t want him to have a reason to moan or insult his abilities as a host. ‘
“He’d been playing … snow … nasty Sonixies bite him they did.”
Draco: "That question is redundant, seeing as you don't.''
Harry face palmed the table, while others shouted 'You will be - screwed that is."
They laid there enjoying the colour changes of the sky, feeling the autumn breeze. It was as if a soothing blanket had been draped over him – something calm and grounding after the difficult topic of Horcruxes he’d just endured, and he suspected that it had something to do with man lying beside him now.
-Harry shoves Draco. Draco shoves Harry back - pinning him to the wall.
“Well, I’d like to see you do better! As for Mrs Black …  It was the day I was basically fired from work, due to my - well you saw why today.” Harry unfolded his arms and sighed. “I came home in a raging fit, slamming things, breaking things, and the state of the house only spurred me on. I didn’t regret breaking anything because it was all destined to be burned anyway. Then dear old Mrs Black’s portrait started screaming and insulting me and my lack of employment, and next thing I knew… I had blown up the wall – literally. That window at the end of the entrance hallway… let’s just say, it hasn’t always been there.”
-Draco looks mortified standing there being pelted with food, spat at, and hated.
Out the box
“What happened?” Draco voice startled him. “You know, prior to your mad dash to the bathroom? What did you remember?” Draco was still frowning at him, concerned or worried for him maybe.
Deciding he was far too tired to reply tonight, he slipped the parchment and quill into the draw. Maybe Tau’s message would feel different in the morning. He would reply as soon as he woke up, it wouldn’t do to try tonight; he might write something strange or embarrassing in his tiredness - or say something he shouldn’t.
“Merry Christmas Harry!” Draco nodded once. The smile on Harry’s face was worth it – he might never entertain his growing affections for the raven-haired man, might never be able to fully deny what his heart seemed to want, but as Harry’s friend… he could be there for him, and maybe… maybe he could pacify his growing desires with just that… a platonic relationship. And if he could persuade Padfoot to meet him, then he could have someone to focus his more amorous feeling on.
"Discourteous, uncouth prats!" Draco sneered as he was bumped into for the hundredth time. He would have been granted a wide berth had his appearance remained the one he had been born with, but it wasn't worth the verbal and physical abuse an ex-Death Eater would be subjected too. Yes, he would have been avoided by most, in fear and disgust, but those that felt justice had not met…
"Draco?" Harry was standing in front of him … When had he stood up? "Draco, don't be an arse, I, fuck!"
“You’ve barley eaten Potter!” Draco said before he could stop himself.
"A little nervous." He admitted, and offered her a shy smile. He wasn't about to admit how he'd been feeling a moment ago though.
Harry downed the shot of amber liquid and played with the empty glass as he turned to face Draco. He sighed. “I lied by omission. I told only enough that would make sense, yet would keep the world safe.”
“Padfoot! You really like him, don’t you?”
Harry shook his head as he removed his clothes. He walked into his bathroom and turned on the shower. The water heated fast, and after checking he had a towel to use once he was done, he climbed in and let the water cascade down his body.
Draco: "I don't get what you see in Ginger! You do know she walked into the Great Hall earlier kissing Dean Thomas, right?"
Harry laughed, waved his hand, and their picnic packed up and vanished back home. “Shall we?” Harry offered to do the disapparation, with Draco as his side alone.
“He could be you know!” Harry insisted, looking at the many carved wooden bowls and boxes on one of the stalls in Covert Gardens.
Be careful what you wish for!
Silence feel between them, the Christmas music quietly resumed playing in the background of the book shop as they exited the elevator. They made their way to the queue so Harry could pay for Arthur's gift, and the customers talked as they proceeded to brows the thousands of books on sale, but Harry couldn't help but remember the way his Aunt had sent him to his cupboard when they got home…
“It’ll be fine in a second Draco, just hold on a minute yeah!” Harry said, rubbing Draco’s arms in an attempt to warm up the man, even if just a fraction.
“Well, I’ll take that–”
“I did no such thing. I was falsely accused!” Oscar insisted.
"You're the one that keeps insisting that friends help each other out… Unless you wish to demote said friendship to simply colleagues I–"
"Erm, well ... I'm gay. I'd prefer a male. Blood statues? Magical creatures' blood?" He frowned hoping he didn't look like a complete idiot.
“Merry Christmas Harry!” Draco said, following him to the dinning table.
Luckily, Draco made no more illicit sounds, and it seems no one but himself had noticed the first one, but he did notice when Draco took a second large helping of the yule log, and soon enough … he went to take a third…
Draco nodded, so Harry went to check with Poppy that honey and cinnamon wouldn’t affect the potions that Draco had taken.
By dinner time, Harry had wracked his brains trying to figure out what the fuck had happened earlier. He really had no idea, and when he spoke to Ginny, she thought he was crazy. Ginny seemed to think that the only thing that happened down by the lake, was Malfoy being obnoxious. No song, no radio, and certainly no singing Draco, Blaise, or Pansy.  What worried him though, was that Ginny didn't seem as clingy. Maybe it was just his imagination, but he hadn't imagined Draco dancing and singing.
Draco: "Because I was scared Potter. I'm not anymore though. I want to be honest with you, I want you to give me chance."
He had to come clean, and soon! It wasn't fair on Draco to believe in a man that didn't exist, and it would be less painful for himself to know where he stood after the truth came out. If Draco didn't asked Padfoot to meet him over Christmas, he would ask him himself in the New Year.
“Mr Potter?” Madam Pomfrey’s rather unimpressed voice, startled him awake…
have the whiskey ready for 6pm.
Draco suddenly walks into a crowd of random students.
He had a plan, a plan that he hoped would pay off … but first, he had to answer Tau.
What was even more bizarre, was that it didn't feel like just a song. It was more like a conversation he'd had with Malfoy. The blond git had accused him of finding Ginny less attractive, accused him of being infatuated with him - or something to that degree, and basically admitted that he found him - Harry, attractive. Ridiculous!
Neville was the current Herbology teacher, and the only other teacher that was below sixty-years-old, so it could be nice to have another like aged wizard around. Draco was quiet, seemed unsure and guarded, but only twenty minutes into their coffee and the company was almost comfortable between them. It was bizarre.
Maybe Tau wanted to see if he would forgive Elliot, because if he did then that would mean he would forgive Tau. Again, maybe he was just reading into all this, trying to hard to compare Elliot with Tau, but he knew what he wanted to write back.
Harry: "They had faith in me to save them. Everyone believed they would be safe following me because of all that ridiculous hype - that I was the fucking chosen one."
She points at Draco's arm with her quill.
Images of his father being cold to him, and of Voldemort using him as a puppet.
Harry didn’t miss the - ‘she wouldn’t be so friendly to me otherwise’ that was left unsaid. Harry felt sorry for Draco - that he still held such insecurities, but he knew it would be ill received if he expressed it. Harry himself, used to be guilty of seeing only one side to Draco - the side he wanted to see or expected to see, but not anymore. In fact, he hadn’t been so blind since their first coffee together.
Harry put out his hand for Draco to shake, but he just sneered at it. Draco wanted Harry's friendship at the start of first year - and yes he'd gone about the wrong way as usual, but Harry had rejected him. It was probably a good thing too seeing how things had transpired once the Dark Lord returned, but he believed Harry would be better of away from him - even now. If Harry Potter - the savior of the wizarding world was caught making pleasantries with a Death Eater, well ... shit would certainly fly.
I am not this quick to update usually, but I want to make sure each chapter is good.
“What happened Reece?” Asked Harry, his hand returning to Reece’s shoulder in what he hoped was a comforting gesture.
Shaking his head, Harry wrote his reply.
Harry: "Alright. I can do that. If you really want this to work Draco, then we both need to start being more open with each other. I've never really been in a relationship, but we won't be one if we can't trust each other with our secrets and feelings. You've already seen so many of mine - my past and my issues, due to this curse; I feel you know so much more about me then I you."
After a moment of thought on all sides, the students nodded and decided to let the matter drop. Harry sighed in relief, and made his way back over to the buffet tables. As he glanced up to where he had left Draco, he saw the blond man looking deathly pale. Before he could reach him however, Draco had started his hasty exit from the Great Hall.
He watched the fire dance, burning and consuming that which feed it, and he wondered… would he be like that. Would the flames only burn until he no longer had anything to give, leaving Padfoot extinguished and cold. No, he certainly couldn’t do that a man that was kind, accepting, and wanted only to be love wholeheartedly.
“Harry?” Draco asked, in way that sounded as if it wasn’t the first time that he’d called his name.
Their lips slammed together, fiery, hungry, dirty ... horny.  They heard steps behind them and quickly parted. If their friends noticed anything, they didn't say.
“Need a hand?” Draco smirked down at Harry, holding out a hand for him to take when Harry showed no signs of getting up.
-Ginny all in Draco's face now - as Harry won't leave. Draco pushes her back, flips his hair, and walks back to Blaise and Pansy. Harry seems mesmerized by Draco, and refuses to leave.
With a deep sigh, he nodded to himself and left his private rooms – vowing to distance himself from one Harry bloody Potter, and focus his energy on Padfoot.
Draco: "It's lucky that I accompanied you. I cannot believe you were going to buy that hideous red and orange quatrefoil rug. With that equally obnoxious red quilt cover. I think my eyes need seeing to. I saved you from blindness Potter. You- "
“What about your muggle family? You never-”
-Harry turns to reply to Draco, and shakes his head.
“You were forced to take that mark Draco! Tom placed it on people for two reasons; as a sign of their sick and twisted loyalty to him, or too remind them - through fear, that they belong to him. If I suddenly marked you, forced you through fear and threats to set fire to the school, it doesn’t make you an arsonist! You never wanted this, and it’s your choices that make you a Death Eater or not, not some fucked up tattoo. Don’t you understand that?”
Harry finally decided to write Draco a letter that evening, he was going to send it with Lilsiv but decided he needed the walk. He had no idea why he felt the need to keep trying with Draco, not when the man appeared to dislike his company anyway.
Falls onto his bed, on top of his old Daily profit newspaper, and looks at Harry's picture.
A young man suddenly greeted him, so he politely nodded in response- with a smile, before he disappeared into the warmth of the pub leaving Harry outside alone once more. It was a quite morning in Hogsmeade, not many visitors today. The snow painted everything a brilliant white, and the shops had been repaired and re-opened after the war.
“Good!” Harry nodded. He would be a nervous wreck waiting for Tau to ask Padfoot that very question, and even more nervous about revealing his identity to him, but he had to take the risk too. Harry downed the last of his whisky and then stood up. “I best be going. I have to get some sleep so I can grade all them bloody essays I assigned this week. Why do we do it to ourselves huh?”
It's dark and dangerous treading
“Yeah, you’re one of our best teachers sir. The others teachers are older and not much fun in classes.” Alexander Marston said, nodding along with the majority of the class.
-Tuesday 2nd February. Harry and Draco hold hands to enter the Great Hall, then - Hermione takes Draco's other hand, and Ron, Harry's other hand.
His crash on Tau was a blossoming like wild flowers in an undisturbed meadow, he was caught hook line and sinker, and the man’s personality was so intoxicating and charismatic. Tau’s words were both witty and refined. The man radiated intelligence, eloquence, and of course, that light, playful, amusing arrogance of his -- but he always made him smile, laugh, or contemplate things he wouldn’t have before. The man also had a calm, appeasing quality to him; the type of calm that Harry could imagine in front of a crackling fire, with coffee and gentle conversation; the type of calm that was coming home from work and embracing each other.
Draco: "Where are you going?"
Harry watched in fascination now, as Draco removed the still full vial from the clasp and then reattach it, the chain magically connecting itself back together. A particular memory then slithered its way into Harry’s mind:
“I won’t be long.” He shouted, hoping that once he was done and back to his room, that Harry would allow him some solitude.
“Could you please get me a dinner Kreacher … and possibly a book that accurately explains what the Snowflu is and what Sonixies are?” He added, killing two bords with one stone, so to speak.
Harry: "No he doesn't. *He chuckled* I don't want to anger you, and you don't have to tell me, but ... I feel there's something else bothering you, something your too embarrassed or scared to admit or something."
Harry had ignored him when he knocked on his door a while ago. He generally wanted to make sure he was okay, which was very un-Malfoy like, but they also needed to speak to McGonagall.
“This house was full of dark energy, dust, dirt, and falling apart.” Harry explained as he watched Draco reading book titles in the library. Draco already held four books that Harry had agreed to let him borrow – three on potions, and one about rare plants and their uses. The library had been stripped back, cleaned, painted in soft cream shades, and divested of cursed or exceptionally dark materials.
Harry sighed and shook his head; he hated having to discipline his students - it really did stir up guilty emotions for him, but once again, he knew it was necessary. Give the student to much leeway and you’ll end up down the road to chaos. He wrote a quick note excusing their tardiness to charms, and handed it to them.
Harry: "Why should I believe you!"
Harry had eventually figured that much out – Draco’s involvement with the landlady had been hashed out in much detail during Draco’s trial. In fact, Harry felt like a royal idiot for suggesting the Three Broomsticks in the first place; he wondered why Draco hadn’t rejected the offer to drink there from the get go. Right now, however, he just hoped that if he stayed quiet long enough, Draco would go on and elaborate. His patience paid off.
Harry swore he had sighs of relief from a some of the student, prefects and teachers as he jumped down from the chair. Filius even muttered, “Yes, good idea Mr Potter, very good, good thinking.” As he climbed down off the table.
That night - long after Ron had started snoring, Harry couldn't sleep. He was eager for a reply from Draco, and he couldn't stop thinking about him, especially their last conversation earlier that day.
Malfoy’s words threw Harry for a loop. Did he just apologies … to him? Not that he wasn’t grateful for it, but the Draco Malfoy that Harry once knew would never have admitted fault. Twelve years
Their drinks suddenly appeared on the table in the common room, and Draco’s eyebrow raised when he realised there were five drinks and only four students… well, he certainly wouldn’t complain, Salazar only knew how much he needed something chocolatey right now to help settle his rampaging thoughts and feelings.
-Draco pokes Ginny in the chest before walking back to Pansy, both nodding together.
-Top-less and knocking into the chest of draws behind him, Harry fights Draco for mouth dominance. Spinning around, they move over to the bed - mouths still firmly locked, they fall onto the bed together.
-Tongues deep in familiarity hands wasting no time.
So caught up in their own battle, they didn’t see nor hear the students watching and cheering for their favourite teacher… or just egging on the battle and watching in awe. Their own snow fight had been completely forgotten about, and Filius and Neville kept them at a safe distance while they watched.
Harry chuckled.
-At a cafe in Diagonally, Hermione heavenly pregnant
Draco's screaming last words had Harry's anger rising and his fists clenching, but before he could punch Draco ... the radio popped into existence. Both Draco and Harry muttered 'fuck' at the same time, before the golden light took over them both and the entire school.
Harry nodded, hoping that Draco would trust him enough after this to share his own burdens. Right now, however, he had to decide where to start. “Have you ever heard of a Horcrux?” Harry asked, raising the glass to his lips to steady his nerves.
Draco: "It's something you want. So naturally, it's now mine."
Draco: "Here's fine Potter!"
Miss Camellia Nixon was going to be just fine, classes were cancelled for tomorrow, and he’d just noticed that Tau had replied to him from earlier. The small smile that graced his lips was instantaneous, as was the warm bubbly feeling inside – dousing out his negative thoughts and feelings.
“Draco?”
After finishing with his teeth, he wrapped a towel around his waist and blushed before he’d even left his bathroom; he wasn’t a prude, but there was something embarrassing about an unrequited love interest seeing you almost naked.
Draco’s rooms where different to his own; simple, less cluttered, more organised, and laid out differently with more space –
Harry continued reading, proud of his second-year Ravenclaw student. Sometimes his students made him think in different ways, taught
-Draco runs again, they follow after him.
“Okay fine. Harry … please share with your esteemed work colleague, the stories you never shared with the world.” Draco asked in his pompous smooth voice. Harry didn’t miss the reminder that they were work colleagues and nothing more - most certainly not friends yet.
Harry: "I don't believe that. I think this curse is ... making us reveal things we wouldn't otherwise admit, but it's not without some truth."
The students were mesmerised, excited, and they viewed this as a very rare and awesome treat. They were so glad that they had stayed for Christmas, and that they had opted to play outside this evening – no one would believe them when the other students returned, when they got to share the recount of events with their other friends.
“Don’t be ridicules Potter – Harry.” Draco spoke between mouthfuls. “I’m not some foolish child that doesn’t know when to stop.”
Harry felt bad for threatening the reporter, but he should be aware of the outstanding agreement Harry has with news reporting agencies; Harry will only talk to them if they made an appointment, and he refused to answer questions when accosted in the street. In fact, the agreement states that they would lose the right to print anything about him should one of their employees forcefully question him in the streets for example, and if that right was revoked and they still ran a story about him, they would be sued.
“Poppy won’t let you leave without an escort!” Harry explained. “If your foot freezes up, you could trip.”
-Both boys fall to sleep in their pajama trousers, facing each other as if they fell to sleep taking.
-Both of the trying to study in Draco's room, but too distracted by each other.
-Councillor opens the curtains to let the sun in, blinding Draco.
you talk about that make no sense to me, but yet even Ron seems to follow for the most part. Secondly ... and its embarrassing but ... I never had friends as close with me as you are with them two. Lastly ... It does feel awkward! I've not many things to share or talk about, and my social skills are different from yours and theirs. I've never really been allowed to have fun, well, not since I was eleven. I've mucked around, had a laugh - especially at others expense. I did a lot of that to gain my statues as the Slytherin prince, to be admired among the snakes."
“I was the one ordered to watch over him.” Kreacher finished.
-Harry pushing Draco over to the bed, shoving him down.
Harry was taken aback for a few seconds, before sighing – Here we go again! Draco had regressed in age once more.
Harry wondered if the reason he was so afraid, was because he feared that minuscule chance that he would be wrong – that in the end, he would have to choose between Draco and Tau. He wanted them to be one and the same so badly that he feared it wouldn’t be the case. Blissful ignorance could only last so long.
Draco: "You finished?"
“Something like that, yeah.” The memory of what his therapist had said nearly ten years ago, was still hard to hear, even as a memory. He quickly pulled himself together however, “thank you Draco. This is a really thoughtful gift.” Harry picked up the Lanyard, putting it over his head. He noticed that it felt weight less. He lifted the shrunken vial in his fingers, and then he remembered, “what potion is this?” He was pretty sure he already knew the answer thought, and as he expected…
“Huh! I guess I never thought about it. So, you only agreed to get a drink with me because you had to visit Ceridwen’s?” Harry asked, a sense of feigned disappointment on his features.
Draco knew it was too good to be true, that Harry would have conveniently forgotten about the Le’Amortentia parchment or decided to do the courteous thing and keep his bloody nose out. He didn’t know why it bothered him if Harry knew or not – perhaps it was a matter of pride, but for some reason he felt like he was being dishonest and he didn’t like having that feeling. Harry was ‘Potter’, his ex-rival, the impulsive golden boy, far too confident, strong-willed, and with a huge sense of morality. Harry would always be too honourable, too liked and loved to be stained by a Malfoy.
“Good morning Mr Malfoy, I have potions here for you.” Madam Pomfrey sauntered over, placing the potions down on the bedside cabinet.
Christmas morning, maybe Minerva had sent him to be fetched for breakfast.
Opening it, he couldn't help but wonder - with a surprising spark of excited anticipation, if the blond man had accepted his request after all. The letter on top was from Malaise Vixen, saying that his mystery man had indeed accepted his request, that he had enclosed his own letter, and that he was rather surprised someone had chosen him out of the surely better prospects.
“They don’t normally, no.” Draco replied. “However, Mrs Allaway will order in what you require should you ask. She has been helping to supply Hogwarts with ingredients for years, even has a tab open with the school for such ingredients, cauldrons, and other potion making utensils. Most ingredients come from the green houses anyway, but there are some we don’t grow or that end up low in stock.”
“The Snowflu is certainly sending you for a loop huh?” Harry asked, smiling sadly. This was a symptom they’d discovered that hadn’t been mentioned in the books – lapses in memory. Poppy suggested that the adult mind did so because it couldn’t cope with the fluctuations in his mental age, that the virus was temporarily affecting the brain. It made sense, was a good theory, but it wasn’t easy to watch.
