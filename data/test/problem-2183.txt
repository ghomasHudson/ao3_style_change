Ron can't believe his ears. He has just learned that his best friend could be pregnant with Draco Malfoy's evil spawn. "You know I don't need the details!" Ron huffed as he slipped on his backpack. "Will you just take the bloody test, Harry?" Ron asks handing him a brown paper bag. Harry looks down at his toes before reaching out for the bag. "Let me know how it goes?" Ron tries as he sees Harry's eyes watering. Harry can only nod.
Despite the pleasant interactions the two boys have had recently, Draco's life seemed to only be getting worse. Ever since his father had kicked him out, he has been staying with one of his good friends, Blaise Zabini. Draco always enjoyed spending time with his friend, but living with him is a completely different story. The first thing the blonde boy noticed is that his friend is undeniably messy. He has had a live in maid for as long as he can remember and mess is not something that he is accustomed to. That and the fact that it seems as if Blaise never sleeps. Draco swears he can hear him all night walking around and talking making it difficult for him to get a sufficient amount of sleep.
Harry huffs as he pushes his books away from him. He just can’t focus, and he didn’t care enough to try. He is trying to preoccupy himself until Draco gets home from work, but nothing was working.
“Draco, just call Blaise, yeah?” Harry starts, “I’m sure he’d be able to help.” Draco scoffs at his suggestion as he angrily wipes his tears.
Just as the man was about to leave the room, he turns to face Draco once more leaving him feeling as if he could drop dead at any moment.
The appointment goes rather smoothly, and Draco can tell that Harry is feeling more at ease than when the two had sat down. The two boys make another appointment for a month from now. Where would they be a month from now. Draco already feels so much closer to Harry and hopes that they can continue that way.
“Mr. Potter?” Draco asks as he slowly approached the man he was slightly scared of. “Can I ask you something?”
He kneels next to Draco and wraps his arms tightly around him. For a moment, Draco tries to pull away but he stops. After a few minutes, he starts to visibly relax in Harry’s arms and his breathing begins slowing down. He pulls his arms away and the two are only inches apart.
"Hermione, Ron, and I are having a movie night at my place this Friday and I was wondering if you'd like to join us?" Harry asks calmly as if it is perfectly normal to invite your arch nemesis over to your house. Draco raised his eyebrows in shock.
When he wakes up again, Harry is no longer in his room and he can’t help but feel a little sad. He gets up out of his bed. By the time he made his way downstairs all he found was a note written in Harry’s terrible handwriting.
“So, I’m the last resort?” Draco asks. “What an honor!” Draco announces sarcastically. Harry chuckles and runs a hand through his messy hair.
Draco realizes that Harry has a good situation here. He has two parents who are caring and understanding. His parents want to do nothing but support him, even though this extremely challenging situation.
As soon as his mother set down the banana cream pie, a recipe his mother has been dying to try out, Harry could feel his stomach start to churn. He tried to smile as his mother scooped a serving onto his plate. He desperately tries to keep himself composed, but fails miserably. Harry pushes back his chair and makes his way into the washroom. He falls to his knees as he empties his dinner into the toilet.
The three of them are sharing a comfortable conversation when his mother decides to change the topic.
"You think you're pregnant?" Draco asks softly as he made him self known to Harry and Ron. He looked directly at Harry and watched as his eyes widened. "Pregnant?" Draco starts, "Like actually pregnant?" He could see Harry becoming increasingly nervous.
"I don't need your pity." Harry stated as the car came to a stop once again. "In fact, I don't need anything from you!" Harry screamed as he began to gather his things. He opened the door aggressively before stepping out of the vehicle. He slammed the door and began to run home in the rain.
Draco’s chest is tight, and he is trying to keep his composure. “Is there anything I can get you in the meantime?” Draco asks softly trying to avoid looking his father in the eye.
When Harry finally made his way downstairs after his shower, he saw that his mother and father are already seated at the dinner table. "Sorry." Harry apologizes quietly before taking his seat next to his father.
"You didn't have to take me home, if that's what you're afraid of." Harry responded as he began to look out the window again.
Harry and Draco decided that if they're going to be having a baby together, they should at least try to be friends. Being friends meant that you actively try to talk to each other and spend time with one another. There's only one problem. How are you supposed to do that with someone that you've hated for so long. Draco isn't even sure that's the right word to use. Does he actually hate Harry Potter or has he always seen the boy as competition? The worst part is that Draco now has to tolerate all of Harry's friends. It's not like he'll be easily welcomed in the little golden trio after all that he has done. That's why it catches Draco off guard when Harry stops him at his locker.
"You called me 'Harry'" Harry states as he continues to look out of the window. Draco smiles because he knew that Harry would latch on to that. "You haven't called me Harry since that night." Draco tightens his grip on his steering wheel trying to focus on the road and not on his drunken sexual encounter with the boy sitting next to him.
Ron Weasley, Harry's best friend, finishes a few seconds later. Despite the large amount of vomit on the ground, he did not hesitate to stand by Harry's side.
“My name is Draco, I’ll be serving you tonight,” Draco introduces before he looks up. He felt as if his heart might stop at the sight of the man in front of him.
Draco takes a few moments to think carefully about his response. "I'll support you," Draco begins. "Whatever you decide, I'll be here." Draco notices that a few more tears manage to escape Harry's eyes. It's weird to think that he can make him cry this easily now. Harry has always presented himself with this strong front and it's weird for Draco to see anything else.
"I know it was stupid, but I needed to do it." Draco explains looking down as his lap. "He's the one who hit me."
“That would be great if I was still staying with him!” Draco says as he angrily unbuckles his seat belt and gets out of his car. He slams his car door harshly and pulls at the roots of his hair.
Harry Potter has officially decided that he hates being pregnant. Over the last few days, his previously flat stomach has become a distinguishable curve that made any of the current jeans in his closet uncomfortable. Not only that, but Harry swears that his arse has been filling out as well. Harry huffs as he pulls on the waistband of his jeans hoping for a bit of relief but finding none.
"That's good," Draco starts, "wouldn't want you throwing up in my car." It was supposed to be a joke, but based on Harry's facial expression it didn't come off that way.
No words are shared between the two boys. It is simply the comfortable silence that they have grown accustomed to over the last couple of weeks. Draco gets into his car and gives Harry a small smile as he goes to start the car.
“You made it!” Harry exclaims stepping to the side making room for him to walk through the doorway. Draco’s eyes travel down to see the slight curve of Harry’s stomach making his heart drop. He hadn’t really noticed before now.
Harry shook his head, "No, of course not. My stomach just felt a little off, I guess?" Harry responds not meaning to sound uncertain. "I'm fine, really."
Harry felt his heart drop as soon as the words came out of his father's mouth. He swallowed before speaking, "What do you mean?" Harry asked trying to sound as if he had no idea what he was talking about.
Harry doesn't reply but he grabs the blanket before Hermione can steal it and covers his legs. For a moment Harry had forgotten he was pregnant. Sometimes it doesn't feel real. The times it does feel real are awful. Those times are usually when he's hunched over the toilet at 3AM trying to hold back his tears. Harry hasn't told anyone about those moments and he doesn't plan on doing so anytime soon.
“It turns out, his parents don’t want to take in the faggot that is Lucius Malfoy’s son!” Draco yells. Harry doesn’t know what to do. Draco’s breaths are staggered and he’s practically hyperventilating at this point. “I just-“ Draco takes in a shaky breath, “I just need- need a second-to fuck,” His knees give out and he is kneeling on the ground unable to breathe with Harry standing frozen unsure of how to help.
"It's quite alright, Harry." His father accepted. "Your mother told me that you had to shower, so it's really not a big deal." His father explained. "However, you'll have to tell me about what happened at practice this afternoon."
"I think that's what got us into this mess in the first place." Draco jokes which earns scowl from Harry. "Joking."
After letting the water run for a few good minutes and a quick temperature check, Draco realized that it wasn’t going to get any warmer and sighed as he forced himself under the cold water. He managed to finish his shower before the bell rang, but he had to live with wet hair as the first bell rings indicating that it is time for his first class.
"Harry, I'm not saying that it's true I'm just concerned!" Ron tries to reason. "You have the symptoms for fuck sake!" Draco takes a moment to think about what Ron could mean by 'symptoms'. Could this be about the vomiting? Draco tries to lean in a little closer trying to get more information. "Why won't you take a test?"
The blonde boy knocks softly and secretly hopes that no one will answer so he’ll have an excuse to get back into his car and pretend like he was never here. Harry opens the door and smiles wide as he makes eye contact with Draco.
Harry nods before saying, "Yeah, loads." He clears his throat before continuing. "I don't have a fever so I think I've gotten it out of my system now."
“Are you okay?” Harry asks. Draco’s head snaps up at the sound of the question. He runs all the potential answers through his head. He could tell Harry the truth about everything that was going on, outright lie to him, or go with a vague response.
“Let me walk you out!” Harry says a little too eagerly causing a blush to creep onto his cheeks. “I mean if you want me to that is,” Harry mumbles trying to recover from what he had said previously. Draco nods and the two make their way out of the house.
I literally deleted this chapter four separate times which was very discouraging. Also, I was traveling home for the holidays and didn't have the time to write but I'm back and so excited to continue.
“See that I don’t believe that. If you were trying your best, you would be out there looking for work instead of sitting on my sofa letting the day pass you by!” Harry’s father yells. He immediately takes note of the terrified look on Draco’s face and realizes that he needs to calm down. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a second trying to recuperate. “Draco, I’m sorry.”
Draco shrugs, "Slightly, but I think that's normal." From the corner of his eye he can see that Harry has pulled a snack out of his bag, chocolate chip cookies.
“I love my son,” Mr. Potter whispers. “I love him, and I need to know that you are trying your best. I need to know that you can support a child because, let’s face it, that baby is coming in a few short months.” Draco nods completely understanding the words coming out of his mouth. “I don’t want to see my son suffer because you couldn’t manage to step up.”
As much as Draco hates to admit it, he's worried about Harry. He can see how much he's struggling during practice and it's making Draco a little uneasy. The two boys were always neck and neck and now it seems as if Harry's having trouble keeping up with Ron Weasley of all people. Draco isn't going to say anything nor does he want to after the last encounter the two boys had, but then he overhears Harry and Ron's conversation.
"I have an appointment next week." Harry whispers which catches Draco's attention. That's when Harry gets a good look at him. His face is red from crying, his eye is different shades of purple and slightly swollen, and he has the most breathtaking eyes. It's the first time Harry's looked at his eyes this way before. The light blue, almost grey eyes are the most wonderful thing that he has ever seen. "I want you to come with me." Harry says without breaking eye contact. "If you want to of course."
His mother sighed and ran a hand through her hair. "Alright, well go shower." She orders. "Your father will be home soon and I want us all to have dinner together." Harry nods and makes his way up the stairs. He really didn't feel like eating, but he knows that there is no way out of a family dinner at the Potter household.
Besides that, Draco is trying to keep his head up. He decides that it's best to not put any extra stress on Harry.
Harry feels awful. He's felt awful all day. After leaving Pomfrey's office he can't help but wonder what exactly is making him feel so ill. Malfoy certainly didn't help the situation with his comments. Perhaps asking Malfoy to care is too much to ask.
"Alright, I'll be there." Draco agreed and watched as Harry turned around to meet up with his friends once again. Draco can't help but wonder how they're dealing with Harry being pregnant. Anytime that he thinks about it, Draco can't help but feel overwhelmed and sweaty. He wants to be supportive, but he's not sure he's ready to be a father right now. It doesn't even feel real yet, but he's going to watch a movie at Harry's regardless.
"This room is nerve-wrecking." Draco says thinking out loud. "I mean what does all of this stuff even do?" He asks as he takes the seat next to Harry. Harry on the other hand looks like he's about to cry. Was it something that he said? "Harry what's wrong?" Draco asks quickly takes the brunette's hands.
“Boys, lunch is ready.” His mother calls from the kitchen. Draco stands and politely extends a hand towards Harry which he gladly takes. He likes the moments where he can see that Draco truly cares for Harry.
“I love it too,” Harry admits as he unconsciously runs a hand over his growing bump. The blonde boy lays his other hand on top of Harry’s and sighs.
Only the car doesn’t start. Instead, the car makes an awful noise that makes Harry jump slightly. He can see the frustration on Draco’s face as the boy repeatedly tries to turn the key hoping that the car would miraculously start.
"Not unless I am in desperate need of another black eye." Harry slaps Draco's arm playfully and he can't help but laugh. "See?" Draco begins, "already so aggressive."
"Potter, everything about this situation is insane." Draco answers with a little bit of truth in his response.
“Same to you.” Harry’s father says before walking to the kitchen table. He shares a look of worry with Harry, but the brunette just assures him that it’s fine.
Lately, all he could think about was how Draco has not been acting like himself. He could see it every time he looks at him in the eye. Harry can see how stressed he is, how his dark circles have taken permanent residence under his eyes, and how he can’t seem to stay awake during the films the two watched together on Friday evenings.
"Harry?" She asks standing up to kneel next to her son. She takes his hand and squeezes it to let him know that she is there. "What's wrong?" Those seem to be the magic words that unleash all of Harry's tears because in the next few moments he finds himself sobbing into his worried mother's arms. She rubs his back in attempt to calm him down, but he only continues to cry. His father joins in to do the same as his mother and Harry can't help but feel as if he's about to ruin the best thing he has.
Harry rolls his eyes and says, "Of course. They also think that we need to learn how to be around each other."
He sighed and started to walk home as it began to rain. An awful walk to end an awful day he supposed.
Draco has several large bruises on his back and Harry can't help but cringe at the sight of them. Hermione traces her fingers across one of them and Draco hisses lightly.
As much as Draco wants to believe that his father might feel differently knowing that his son is gay, he knows it's foolish. He might not ever be able to come out to his father, but he has come to terms with his reality.
The day passed by in an uneventful sequence. By lunch, Draco had received two glares from teachers for not having his homework complete and Draco simply took the consequences. He had spent the night in his car and would most likely have to do the same tonight, so he wasn’t in the mood to argue. When all hope seemed lost, Draco looks up and notices that Harry is sitting across from him.
He walks through the corridor of his house that leads to his bedroom, only to see his father in his office. "Draco." He father calls catching his attention. "Come in here for a moment." Draco sighs and walks up to his father.
Draco shakes his head and tries to find the words to explain what is going on. “My father,” He starts, practically whispering, “He’s here and he wants to talk.” Draco takes a deep breath before speaking again, “I just need you to cover for me while I talk to him.” Luna agrees without any hesitation and rushes to put her apron on once again.
"Yes, Father?" Draco asks trying to be as respectful as possible. He knew what would happen if he did otherwise.
Harry decides that it is her fault that his bump seems to be growing exponentially these last few days. Draco gives Harry a weird look when he sees that he is scowling.
"Do you want to come or not?" Harry asks cutting straight to the point. "You don't have to if you don't want to."
Harry wipes his mouth and turns to look at Draco. For a moment, Draco wants to help, but he feels like it would be too much. How weird would it be if he, Draco Malfoy, was seen helping his arch nemeses Harry Potter.
Harry has never felt this connected to someone before and he wants nothing more than to push his lips into Draco’s but he’s afraid. Draco on the other hand has never felt so certain. He pulls Harry in for a deep and passionate kiss. The pregnant boy is taken back, but he quickly reciprocates.
“Now, I couldn’t hate you if I tried.” He answers honestly. “When I wake up in the morning, you’re the first thing I think about. You changed my life for the better.”
Harry picked up his phone again only to be filled with disappointment again. At that moment there's a soft knock at the door which Harry offers to answer. He opens the door and is shocked by what is standing in front of him.
Draco takes both of Harry's hands and squeezes them lightly. Harry can't help but notice how soft his hands are. Draco nodded and closed his eyes.
As Draco leans back in the chair that he is seated in, Harry sees him wince. "Malfoy, shirt off." Harry orders almost immediately.
Draco clears his throat in fear that he might sound as if he'd been crying otherwise. "Draco. Nice to meet you, Dr. Nelson." Draco greets politely.
He forces himself to take a deep breath and drink some of his water. Where did those words even come from? He’s never said those words to anyone in his life, excluding his mother, and now he’s saying those words without deeply considering what they mean? How has living with the Potter’s changed him so drastically?
He only nods and goes to remove the ultrasound pictures from his pocket. This isn't quite the way he envisioned telling his parents that he's pregnant, but it feels like it has to be today. His mother and father both take a moment to look at the picture in front of them and quickly exchange a glance.
"Don't be a prat, Potter." Draco responds. "It's raining and I'm trying to be nice." Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Come on, Harry."
“You don’t seem upset, so I’m assuming it went well,” Draco concludes as he studies Harry’s features. Have his eyes always been that green?
"Harry Potter?" A nurse dressed in bright blue scrubs calls out into the waiting room. Harry flashes Draco a worried look before they both stand and make their way over. The nurse does the normal tasks such as checking Harry's weight, height, blood pressure, and temperature before telling the two that the doctor would be in shortly.
"I'm assuming you're the other father. Is that correct?" She asks as she looks through the chart she's holding. Draco nods and she goes on through Harry's exam.
"Looking a little tired there, Potter." Draco huffs as he looks over at Harry during practice. It's true, Harry didn't look his best, and Draco was going to make sure that he knew.
Draco shoots a worried glance over at Harry and answers with caution. “It is pretty cute isn’t it?” Draco responds flashing Lilly a small smile. Harry only rolls his eyes as he shoves another chip into his mouth. Draco clears his throat as he pushes his chair back to stand up. “I really should be going.”
Draco pulls into the parking lot and takes a deep breath trying to calm his nerves. Harry is already nervous enough so he shouldn't make it worse. He and Harry make their way inside the building and Draco feels his heart rate rise once again. Harry signs himself in and Draco can't help but look at all of the pregnant people in the lobby. The first thing that Draco notices is that most of them seem to be happy couples who couldn't be more thrilled to have a baby with one another. At that moment, Draco feels a strange twist of guilt thinking about how Harry shouldn't be in this type of situation especially with him at his side. He's truly ruined his life.
"Do you think that I wanted to be a lawyer?" Lucius started as he moved past his son. "No, I didn't. However, I became one anyway because I knew it was best to listen to my father!" Draco knows that he has no choice. If he tries to argue, there will be serious consequences. "You will go stay with your aunt, and that is the end of this conversation."
It wasn’t like Harry’s father looks very intimidating, but he could tell he is not completely pleased about the current circumstances. Draco gulps and takes a seat next to Harry as Lily serves dinner.
Coach Hooch sighed. It seems as if she knows that Draco is not telling the whole truth. “Well, if you need to talk, you know where I’ll be.”
"Can you believe that I'll actually get that large?" Harry whispers into Draco's ear making him snap out of his thoughts. "I mean really can you imagine me like that?" Draco chuckles slightly and shakes his head in agreement.
Harry turns around to see meet his mother's concerned eyes. "He had plans with Hermoine, and I didn't want to bother them."
"Father, I do not want to go the Netherlands this summer." Draco stated clearly which caused his father to stand up slowly.
“Nonsense, you’re our guest for the evening!” She calls out before going back to what she was doing before Draco had arrived. Draco chuckles softly and follows Harry to the sofa.
Harry can't help but be surprised at Malfoy's offer. He wants to take it because his shoes are getting wet, but he can't.
Harry doesn't know why he reacted that way. He knew Draco meant it as a joke, but he couldn't stop his blood from boiling. It just made him so angry. That and the fact that he and Draco have yet to discuss the night they spent together, and Draco has yet to acknowledge that it happened. Maybe it was wrong of Harry to assume that things would change between them.
“Oh you know, a lot of late nights and such. It’s fun.” Harry doesn’t know if he should believe him or not. Why would Draco be lying? “What about you, how have you been dealing with without track?” Harry huffs. He supposes that could also be why his figure is expanding, the absence of the exercise he was used to getting.
Draco can't help but zone out at all the terms she's throwing at them. Harry seems to be taking in the information with ease despite having a crying fit less than half an hour ago. Draco supposes that Harry has always been that way, he's able to to act without thinking. Draco on the other hand, always seemed to be unable to get passed the fact that the doctor has just confirmed that Harry is 12 weeks pregnant. This means that Draco has a little over six months to prepare himself to be a father.
Harry opens the car door to calm him down. He’s never seen Draco like this before. Tears are pouring down his flushed cheeks and all Harry wants to do is help.
Draco Malfoy always holds his head high. Or at least he did before his life turned to complete shit. It just feels as if Draco can’t catch a break. Right as he began to grow comfortable despite the given circumstances, Blaise reveals that his parents are returning from their ridiculously long holiday and didn’t approve of their son housing him for the few weeks that he did. This means that Draco is left with no other option but to find another place to stay. Last night, Draco had managed to park in a decently nice neighborhood and sleep for a few good hours.
After Harry had managed to explain to his parents that he wasn't sick the rest of dinner carried on as normal. That was until Harry caught a whiff of what his mother had made for dessert.
Harry absent mindedly puts a hand on his non-existent bump, and nods. For the first time in a long time, Harry feels like he might be okay. The only thing that could possibly make it better Harry decides, as he sits with his parents at the dining room table, is if Draco Malfoy were there to hold his hand like he had earlier in the day.
“Harry’s father should be home soon, so you two can just make yourselves comfortable on the sofa while I finish dinner,” Lily instructed as she began to walk into the kitchen.
"They're just misguided, Draco." His father would whisper to him as they passed a gay couple on the street.
Once Harry can get words out he says, "You don't have to sit with me." He wipes his mouth and leans against the wall. "It's normal." Harry tries to reason, but Draco stays sitting with him on the cold bathroom tiles.
Harry didn't really try to follow the film, and at some point he was just mindlessly staring at the screen hoping that something mildly interesting would happen to get his mind off of the Draco situation.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. If Draco isn’t staying with Blaise where has he been sleeping?
"Please don't tell anyone about it. I've arranged to stay with Blaise for a while I was just scared." Draco rambles and Harry feels like his heart might burst. "I just needed to tell him, and I thought-" Draco begins, "I thought he would accept me, but he just hit me." Draco says as a few tears of his own begin to fall.
"Malfoy sod off will you?" Ron asks thinking that he was just eavesdropping on a very private conversation. "This doesn't concern you." That's when Harry mumbled something that made Ron's eyes nearly pop out of his head. "What did you say, Harry?" Ron asks weary of what the answer might be.
"I will." Harry promised. Lily leaves the room leaving Harry alone with his thoughts for the night. He looks down at his flat stomach rest his hand in the area right above his hips.
As Draco pulls into Harry’s driveway, he feels like he could vomit. He forces himself out of his car and makes his way to the front door. For a moment, he simply stood there wondering if he should even be here. Harry’s parents had invited him, but that didn’t mean they actually wanted to meet him.
“I love kissing you,” Draco whispers as he pulls away from Harry during one of their secret snogging sessions. The two of them are in the guest room where Draco has been staying laying on the thick comforter. He runs a hand through his raven hair and smiles widely. “I don’t know what it is, but I feel safe.” Harry smiles at his words and Draco runs a thumb across his cheek trying to take in every aspect of the boy’s beauty.
Draco rolled his eyes and started his two laps. As much as he hated the fact that he had to run extra laps on top of a tough practice, he does agree that he could have been a little more helpful. However, what he still fails to understand is how not being helpful equals an extra two laps.
"I don't even want to be a lawyer, Father." Draco mumbled barely loud enough for his father to hear. Lucius lets out a sarcastic laugh before laying a firm hand on Draco's shoulder.
"Potter!" He heard a familiar voice call out. He turns only to see Draco Malfoy pulling up in his fancy sports car that Harry can never remember the name of. "Do you want a ride home?"
Draco nods and makes his way out of her office and to his car. After all, he did have a very important dinner to attend this evening.
“What’s crawled up your arse?” Draco jokes as he makes his way to the sofa. Harry follows but doesn’t answer. He doesn’t want Draco to know about the bump or how he is feeling about it. He doesn’t need to know that his clothes don’t fit either.
“Hey there, baby,” Draco whispers trying to keep from Harry waking up, “I don’t know if you can hear me, but I’m your dad. Your other dad is the most amazing person and I think I might be the luckiest person in England.” He keeps his hand there and begins to rub soft circles into the expanse of Harry’s belly. “You don’t know this, but I can’t wait to meet you. I think about you and your dad so much I can’t help but get excited anytime I get to talk about you two.” He takes a moment before finishing, trying to get his thoughts in order. “I love both of you very much, more than I have ever loved anyone.”
By the time he’s at practice, he still can’t manage to shake his nerves. He’s overthinking every one of his actions and it is evident in the extra ten seconds that are added on to his mile time.
“I’m just a little stressed is all.” Draco tries to explain. A little stress does not even begin to cover it. “You know with school, track, and getting everything ready for university, it’s a lot.”
"Of course." Harry answers without hesitation. He moves out of the way so that Draco can come inside. "Are you okay?" Harry asks, taking the bag out of Draco's hand and setting it aside. Draco nods, but Harry knows it's a lie. "Let me get you some ice." Harry says as he makes his way to the kitchen to fill a bag with a few ice cubes. He raps it in a clean dish rag so it's not too cold on his skin.
Harry is unable to speak and all he can do is shake his head. A hand begins to run up and down Harry's back in a soothing motion. Harry looks up momentarily to see Draco sitting next to him.
"Draco, who did this to you?" Hermione asks, genuinely concerned for his well-being. "These look pretty severe."
"How could Malfoy be the father?" Ron asks trying to piece together the information that has just been revealed to him. "You two can't even be in the same room for more than 5 minutes before you're at each other's throats!"
Draco nods and says, “Yeah, just tired.” Vague it is. “Don’t you usually sit with Ron and Hermione?” He asks trying to change the subject.
“Took you long enough.” His father spat as he took a sip from the clear cup that he had placed in front of him. “I thought you would be better at this given you’ve been doing this for months.”
"Potter, you alright there?" He asks trying to sound sincere. Potter doesn't answer. He only shakes his head and ends up bending over to throw up everything that was in his stomach. "Christ, Potter." Draco exclaims as he tries to not look at the vomit in the grass. "You think that you would learn to watch what you eat."
“Really?” Lucius asked with a hint of laughter in his voice. “We’ll see after you here that it involves the whore and his bastard spawn.”
He loves that Draco is taking responsibility for his actions and trying to support their newly forming family. Harry just hates the idea that Draco might be taking on all this work because he feels that he must. After all, it is not as if Harry had mentioned the fact that he was a carrier, and could most definitely carry children naturally, during the drunken night they had spent together. Now that Harry is thinking about it, he probably should have mentioned that it was his first time.
Harry flashes Draco a small smile and gets into his car because, after all, what's the worst that could happen.
Draco only squeezes Harry's hands. He feels like he doesn't have the right words. "I'm scared too." Draco whispers. "Harry, I am so bloody terrified." He admits looking into Harry's eyes. He can see Harry close his eyes trying to force the tears to stop. "It's scary, but I made you a promise, remember?" Harry nods as he opens his eyes and reveals his emerald orbs. "I'm going to be here every step of the way because it's the right thing to do."
When the clock ticked 7 and his friends were already seated and wanting to choose a movie for the night, Harry can't help but wonder when Draco is going to arrive. He did say that he was coming right? Maybe he misunderstood? Harry ran his hands through his hair trying to pretend like he wasn't thinking about how Draco hadn't even bothered to send a text letting him know that he's going to be late.
Draco sighed and rested his head on his steering wheel. Typical. He says something wrong and Potter takes it the wrong way. He has to admit though, this is probably one of the most civil encounters they've had.
Despite the fact Harry knows that it is very unlikely for him to get any kind of quality sleep, Harry still makes his way to his bed where he lays himself onto his pillow. The boy shifts and manages to slip a pillow under his bump just as his mother had been telling him. He even manages to get one of the small throw pillows that Draco deemed useless and placed it in between his knees.  For the first time in a while, Harry felt a wave of relief as he closed his eyes because he could feel sleep overtaking his body.
Draco breaks the silence with something that makes Harry feel like he could throw up again. "I came out to my father."
Draco must admit, life at the Potter household is incredible. Mrs. Potter was very quick to agree with Harry that Draco needed to stay at their house, meaning that he moved into the guest room almost immediately. It’s true, they do have their issues, such as Mr. Potter acting very distant towards him, but it is better than sleeping in his car. It isn’t as if Mr. Potter’s negative feelings towards Draco are undeserved. He did get his son pregnant, ending what could have been his ticket to university, so he just tries to muddle through.
Ron quickly chose a film that Harry has never heard of, and Harry took that as an opportunity to get a couple slices of pizza from the dining room. When he returns to his spot the previews are over and Harry is feeling satiated and happy. He can't help but think that he'd be happier if Draco were here.
A wave of nausea washes over Harry and he quietly groans hoping it would go away. He tries to take deep breaths hoping that it would pass, but the feeling only becomes worse. He kicks off the blanket trying not to disturb the people around him while covering his mouth as the familiar feeling of vomit comes up his throat. He falls to his knees as the tears begin falling down his face. As everything that he had eaten comes up he continues to cry.
“Please this is nothing! Wait until you see what I make for Christmas.” Harry’s mother tells the blonde as she begins to fill up their plates.
When Draco arrives home a few hours later with everything from the conversation he shared with his father weighed heavily on his mind, he sees Harry sleeping peacefully. The young blonde man wants nothing more than to lay by his side. Draco sighs and makes his way to the kitchen table to finish the multiple assignments, some of which are overdue, that he has to spend the next few hours with.
“I suppose we should get off of the ground.” Draco jokes as he takes Harry’s hand into his own, holding it tightly.
Another thing that is amazing is how close he’s gotten to Harry since he moved in. They’ve done nothing more than share a few passionate kisses in the privacy of their bedrooms, but Draco holds onto those moments with every piece of his soul. He truly loves the way Harry’s lips feel against his, and how sometimes he can feel his bump push into his torso as they kiss passionately. The two boys may be young and don’t have a clue how to raise a child together, but he thinks that as long as he’s with Harry he can do it.
"I'll be there." Draco states as he squeezes Harry's hands a little tighter. "For you and the baby." Harry can't help but smile at Draco's words.
When the film finishes Draco is fast asleep leaning against the sofa snoring softly, and Harry is struggling to hide his yawns. He looks over where Ron and Hermione are and notices that they're asleep too. Harry shakes his head at the sight of Hermione curled up against Ron and can't help but smile as he makes himself comfortable.
“Please, you were in on it too,” Draco responds. “I mean you had the whole track team calling me ferret for a whole month.”
In his many attempts to focus and forget the events of the day, his father’s words still circle through his mind. The seven words replay through his head like a never-ending alarm.
Lucius clears he throat before turning to face his son. "You will do as I say because I am your father." Lucius growled as he stood inches away from him. "This will be good for you. Working for the family law firm is one of the foundational steps to becoming a successful lawyer." Draco couldn't look his Father at the moment. He could feel his anger starting to radiating off of him.
“Boring,” Harry answers simply. “Who knew that life without running until you feel as if your lungs might explode could be so dull.” Draco snorts slightly at Harry’s comment and the brunette is happy to see him smile.
He catches Harry looking at him and the two share a smile. That is when Draco decides that he could get used to this. Harry’s smile, Draco decides, is all he needs right now.
“Watch your tone with me boy.” His father warns that makes Draco’s blood crawl. “Has living alongside that faggot and the abomination he carries made you forget your manners?”
The doctor enters and Harry and Draco are trying their best to make it seem like they weren't crying moments before she entered the room.
The sound of his first name catches his attention. The last time that Draco called him by his first name was the night that they spent together at Blaise Zabini's party.
Coach Hooch crosses her arms before speaking, "And you're the one who mocked their teammate instead of trying to help!" She retorted. "In fact, make that two!"
“That wasn’t mean.” Harry begins to explain. “It was just funny.” Draco rolls his eyes at Harry’s comment. “Besides, it was only because you were calling Ron ‘weasel’.”
The two share a few more stories before Harry’s father arrives. His hands are shaking as he stands to introduce himself.
Draco chuckles at the note and realizes that he’s completely alone. After he finishes reading the note, he realizes that he’s completely alone. This means that he has the time to think about what exactly happened earlier this morning.
The frightened blonde boy can’t manage to say another word and frantically walks away. “Luna?” He calls out as he makes his way to the back storage room. The young blonde girl comes around the corner and immediately takes note of his distressed state.
Draco can’t help but scoff at his father’s words. “What sort of deal? Because to tell you the truth, I don’t think I’m interested.”
"Let's get you something to eat, and you can tell us everything." His mother says as she pulls him into a tight hug.
No words are shared for the first few minutes and Draco swears he’s sweating. Harry had assured him that this would just be a dinner, but he never thought about how awkward it could be.
Harry sighs as he pulls on the closet sweatshirt before responding with a quick, “Coming!” He makes his way down the stairs and sees that Draco is dressed in the same clothes that he had worn to school the previous day, which is unusual for the lad.
Draco could feel his heartbeat picking up, threatening to break out of his chest, but he couldn’t let his father know that his words were getting under his skin. “Keep them out of this,” Draco demands while maintaining eye contact with his father.
When Draco arrives home that evening, he can't help but wonder if Harry has told his parents yet. Draco hasn't even told his father that he's gay, and now he has to let him know that he's going to be a father in a few short months. It's not that Draco's father is scary, but he's always felt like he couldn't approach him about these kinds of things. That and the fact that he knows how he feels about homosexuals.
When Harry comes home later that evening with a few new clothing items, he can’t help but stare. He stares at the swell between Harry’s hips and he knows two things for certain. Harry’s father is right. He must do everything in his power to protect Harry and the baby.
As Draco drove, he couldn't help but sneak glances at Harry. He knew that Harry isn't feeling well and he couldn't stand the idea of leaving him to walk in the rain. He might hate the guy, but he still cares about his well being.
He looks over Harry's shoulder and he can see Hermione and Weasley whispering trying to act as if they weren't watching the two boys. "Your friends are okay with that?" Draco asks continuing to put his books in his backpack.
The timer Harry had set on his phone went off and Harry visibly tensed up and reached for the test. He took a deep breath and turned the stick over.
"Hello boys, I'm Dr. Nelson." She greets shaking Harry's hand. "You must be Harry." Harry only nods and tries to avoid eye contact. "You are?" She asks extending her hand toward Draco.
Although Draco would never admit it, Harry could tell that he's been on edge lately. Ever since his father kicked him out of his house it seems like he has accepted the fact that he does not deserve good things in life. Harry hated that, but at this moment, he couldn't do anything about it.
Draco didn't respond. He didn't need to. He is several feet in front of Harry and he isn't even running at full speed. A few seconds later, Malfoy finished his lap and was able to see Harry as he finished his. As much as he hates Harry, he couldn't help but notice that the boy still doesn't look very well.
Harry doesn't know how much longer he can keep his secret. His stomach is still flat as a board, but he swears that it has lost some of it's definition in the last few weeks. The one thing that is threatening to expose him is his constant nausea. He feels as if a whiff of the wrong smell could make him lose his dinner at any moment. It doesn't help that he feels all this stress from his situation with Malfoy, school, and track-which he knows he's going to have to quit soon- all piled up on top of one another.
Harry has been noticing those moments have been occurring more often lately. He catches Draco looking at him and smiling, laughing with one another, and it seems as if all he wants to do is spend time with him no matter the activity. It is not as if these moments have been one-sided either and it’s been making Harry question his feeling towards Draco. Is it possible that he, Harry Potter, has feelings for Draco Malfoy? Harry shakes his head and sits down at the table to enjoy the lunch that his mother made for him.
"The school called saying that you had thrown up at practice." His father answers sternly. "Are you feeling ill?"
Draco clears his throat before he answers and sets his glass down on the side table near him. “I’m doing well, Sir. And yourself?”
Harry shakes his head feeling slightly relieved, "Mum, trust me. I feel perfectly fine." Harry reaches over and rests his hand on top of hers. "Don't worry." He assures her. Lily runs a hand through her hair before sighing.
“Let me explain.” He says placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder stopping the boy from walking away. “I don’t mind housing and feeding you, but I need to see you trying.”
“Honestly, Draco, working in an establishment like this is almost sinful,” His father says as he pushes the plastic-covered menu away from him. “We need to talk.”
“You must be Draco.” A red-headed woman says as she comes out of the kitchen wiping her hands on her apron before extending a hand towards Draco. “It’s so nice to you.”
"I hope you know you're not going to school tomorrow." His mother says and she runs a hand through Harry's hair.
The car ride home is silent. Harry simply holds on to the ultrasound pictures in his hands and stares at what has been growing in his belly for the last three months. The little blob that Dr. Nelson had pointed out to him is his baby. He doesn't know why, but the assurance of the baby in his stomach made him feel so in love with the idea of getting to cradle a baby in a few short months. He, Harry Potter, is going to be a father.
"I just wanted to inform you that I have found you something to do after school is out of the summer." Draco's father announced without looking up from his computer. "I have arranged for you to spend the summer in the Netherlands with your Aunt."
Harry rolls his eyes and goes to join Malfoy. "You can sit on the sofa, you know that?" Harry asks as he begins to make himself comfortable on the couch.
"That's not important." Draco groans as he stands up to make his way to the sitting room. "I thought we were watching a film tonight, not fussing over me." Draco calls out as he takes a seat on the ground.
“He has the cutest little bump, but he insists on wearing those baggy jumpers and such.” His mother gushes. “Surely you’ve noticed, Draco.”
By the time Harry walks through his front door, he is dripping wet. A few moments after he drops his bag and begins to head up the stairs he hears his mother's gasp. "Harry why are you wet?" She asks genuinely concerned. "Don't you usually get a ride from Ron?"
“Malfoy, do you have a minute?” Coach Hooch calls out as he walks past her office on his way out. Draco only nods and takes a seat on the other side of her desk. “What’s going on with you?” She asks cutting straight to the point. Draco shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “Weasley was only a few meters behind you, which is great for him, but strange for you.”
“What?” Draco asks as he begins to recompose himself. “Let me get this straight.” Draco starts. “I get you pregnant at the age of seventeen and they want to have me over for dinner?”
"Excuse me for feeling bad for you." Draco defended. As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew that he said the wrong thing. He could feel Harry glaring at him and he knew that this wasn't going to end well.
His father sits confidently, despite the fact the blonde long-haired man sticks out like a sore thumb. Draco manages to walk towards his table without spilling anything or passing out and takes a seat across the table.
"Well Ron and Hermione are going to show up around 7 and they're going to spend the night." Harry explains. Draco tilts his head in confusion trying to understand what Harry is saying. Is he inviting him to sleep over or leave once the movie is over? It really shouldn't be this confusing.
"Weasley, take him to Nurse Pomfrey." Coach Hooch orders also trying not to look at the vomit on the grass. "Malfoy, take another lap!"
Draco’s head snapped up when he heard the front door start to unlock immediately snapping him out of his panicked state. The door opens and Harry’s father walks through surprised to see Draco sitting in front of him.
"Are you nervous?" Harry asks as he begins to dig through his backpack. Draco clears his throat and tries to think of an answer that will sound like he's not completely terrified.
All of a sudden, it was as if Draco couldn't breathe. He couldn't believe the words that just came out of Harry's mouth. No matter how much Harry denied it, Ron was right. Harry's symptoms all pointed towards one thing: pregnancy. Draco couldn't hide anymore, he had to confront Harry.
The man sighed before turning to face Draco. “Yes?” He crosses his arms and Draco can feel his heart start to race. “Well?” He asks raising his eyebrows towards the terrified boy standing in front of him. He truly hoped he didn’t notice the face that his knees are trembling.
The same thing Draco felt now, guiding his hands across the expanse of Harry’s back in the dim locker room. The silence filled the air, apart from the quiet drip of the faucet. They were utterly alone. Everyone on their floor had probably long gone home.
Draco’s head fell back against the hard floor. The pain didn’t register, only the wet heat, the hands taking hold of his arse, grinding down. He knew it was going to bruise, knew Harry’s palms were going to leave a mark for him to see the next day, knew he was going to feel the phantom touch of Harry’s fingers trailing down, blunt fingernails scraping in their wake, over his entrance, knew tomorrow he would feel the force of Harry’s blazing tongue, Harry’s finger pushing inside of him, filling him up all the way—
“Hope I didn’t interrupt anything?” Draco’s eyes shone when he looked up. “Mother was much better this morning. Quite sickened of me, actually, so I caught a last-minute Portkey. Torino layover. Absolutely unbearable.”
He froze. It was one o’clock in the morning. The Ministry was bound to be deserted save for the few midnight oil burners—but Draco knew nobody ever used the DMLE shower room. That was why he liked it. It was a place for him to leave the mess of work and life behind, gather his wits, and then come back anew.
“I see you’ve met Simone,” Malfoy said just as the dog, Simone, sprinted off towards him and poked her head underneath Malfoy’s hand, tail wagging.
Malfoy’s hand stroked over Simone’s head. For a split-second a sun beam escaped the clouds and spilled over the dog’s tan and sable fur, over Malfoy’s cream overcoat.
Harry didn’t comment, if he even noticed. He was curled up against himself on the bench, sweat dripping down his back, breath deep and ragged.
“Oh, baby, how I’ve missed you,” he cooed. Where Harry would have cringed before there was now only lack. He yearned for Draco to say those words to him, badly.
“Thank you,” he said, meeting Draco’s eyes in the floor to ceiling mirror. “This—uh—feels so much better.”
“Wasn’t for me,” Draco lied. “Forensics only required Potions and Charms mastery. Saved me four more years of Healing nonsense. And the pay is better too.”
Harry, by contrast, could never sit still. At first he’d enjoyed the fieldwork, going out and catching bad guys, the thrill of the chase, but with that came the ever-so-consuming desk-bound duty. Behind the scenes, Aurors still had to figure out crimes, interview suspects, and corroborate facts. Filing had to be done regularly. And with the monotone scribble at the end of each day came Harry’s leg bouncing, stronger and stronger until Ron’s inevitable off-hand comment followed. That week it had been:
His finger pointed to the tower of tea shelves, jars, boxes and accessories stacked one on top of another, an empire threatening to collapse at the smallest push.
Draco followed his every movement out of the corner of his eye, Harry’s reflection in the mirror, the wider opening of his legs, the shudders, how utterly debauched Harry looked, breathing heavily, face scrunched up in pleasure.
. What Harry would’ve thought if Draco admitted all he’d ever done was scuffle with other men, leave bloodied and jerk himself off to completion in his shabby one-bedroom flat in Sutton. That all he’d ever been allowed was leaning against nightclub corners, watching beautiful bodies dancing, wondering what it would’ve felt like to be wanted that way, if only someone would’ve felt the same desire for his deformed body, bony and scarred in all the wrong places.
He flipped the pages at random. It was laughable, really, how ridiculous he looked. Like a poor imitation of Draco with the book, the dog; all that was missing were the past of questionable morals and the posh accent.
Draco lunged then, and despite the awkward angle this time their mouths collided in a wet mess of a kiss, all tongue, teeth, and heat. Draco’s hand interlaced in Harry’s thick hair, pushing his head back, exposing the swath of velvety skin of Harry’s neck, the sweaty patch of skin stretched above his collarbones, his Adam’s apple, pulse bobbing underneath Draco’s lips.
As he went on he became faintly aware Harry was now turning toward him on the bench, away from the mirror, that Harry was taking off his joggers, earning Draco an eyeful of his hips, his thighs, his cock, that Harry was leaning against him, touching his chest, his body—shaking with every spurt of Draco’s momentum.
Harry’s heart thumped loudly in his chest. He took Draco’s face in. His straight nose, the contour of his Cupid’s bow. The shine of his eyes when they looked at Harry.
Draco’s eyes widened, frightened to realize his orgasm hadn’t taken his edge off—that his erection was still stiff against his stomach, where Harry had tilted his head and was now dutifully slurping every inch of Draco’s come.
“I trust you,” Harry added on a breath, and straightened his back. He was so close his skin brushed against Draco’s erection. Draco inhaled sharply.
He hadn't heard a single word, too busy staring at the mirror, at the clear outline of Harry’s erection trapped against his flimsy Auror pants.
He was rubbing his wrist where Harry had grabbed him, eyes following Harry’s as he steered the water jet upward.
Simone started recognizing Harry. Every time she spotted him, she’d start wagging her tail in her lazy, unimpressed way. But he was quick to learn that was just a manifestation of her personality. She was just a very underwhelmed dog. She only really got excited for Malfoy, whenever Malfoy offered her a treat or talked to her in that embarrassing baby voice, but mostly she just sat by his side. A quiet companion.
“Do you have any pets of your own?” Malfoy asked. Harry realized with another stomach flutter that small talk was very much
The smell of semen, sweat and Harry’s aftershave was everywhere as Harry’s weight fell down on Draco. Harry’s hair tickled at his nose as finally, Draco took his hands away, but not before he tucked a sweat-darkened strand behind Harry’s ear, heart threatening to explode.
s for his liking. His eyes kept skipping lines; he kept getting distracted. Frustrated and feeling a bit silly, he gave up on Walt Whitman. What did Malfoy see in this?
“Do you feel the same about the Aurors?” Malfoy innocently re-asked the question, and Harry gave him a steely look. Speaking of Slytherins.
That emotion had been foreign to Harry, but he thought he understood it now as he looked at the piece of parchment for the fifth time:
He was fidgety and walking had become a respite from the grey parapet of his Auror cubicle. It cut his sight of everyone else in the department out by default: a no-interruptions, focus-on-your-paperwork type of design, and the immovability, the sheer drabness of it
So he decided to take it outside instead. Every day after work, ten thousand steps by the Thames. He enjoyed his walks, the timid nightfall, the brush past crowds, past absentminded couples. The days it rained he had to take an umbrella. The Impervius would’ve been too conspicuous to the Muggle eye, but Harry was anything but inconvenienced by that. On the contrary, the dampness of his clothes, the smell of wet cement and the roiling waters of the Thames always refreshed his mind after it had gotten grey, stuck like the same old Auror cubicle parapet.
“Well,” Malfoy said with finality. The newly leafed out trees shook with the steadfastness of a light breeze, the same light breeze that mussed Malfoy’s hair. He kept it longer on top now, and gel-less. “Thank you for keeping her otherwise occupied in my absence.”
His pulse suddenly beating fast, he wrenched his eyes away from Harry’s general direction. He started straightening his robes when he realized it was his turn to check if the spell had worked.
Malfoy looked a little taken aback by the interest. It was all in that eyebrow thing. He did it when Harry had guessed correctly what cauldron to use (copper) for their Eighth Year Antidote to Common Potions.
But Draco’s habit died down as fast as it started. An unexpected punch (from a stranger who turned out be an UFC fighter) had fractured his nose, and the bone had strayed so far it had perforated his right eye. That—he hadn’t been able to solve with dittany, and the downside of getting his smashed-in face fixed at the same place he studied was that his instructors had soon found out.
Harry groaned and put the crumpled paper back in his pocket. What was he to do with his entire day? He took a stab at weeding the backyard, a long overdue project. He cooked and cleaned, but by some happenstance the afternoon found him in the magically-cooled drawing room, with
“Harry.” Draco’s hand made its way to Harry’s hair. He pushed his waves up from his forehead, suddenly aware of what Harry had confessed earlier: “
In Song of Myself, he read about heroes, and Death, and martyrs and wars. He wondered what Draco would’ve made of this. If he flinched at the word Death, the way Harry did. He wondered who the heroes were, and inadvertently his mind jumped to the War.
Ron had stood in the middle of his kitchen, a little uneasy at the array of jars with their own little golden lids on their own designated stacks of shelves: Harry’s improvised tea collection. The centerpiece was, of course, a tea set from the Diagon Alley antique shop. Harry preferred not to think about the Galleon amount he’d spent on it.
But in that moment the mirth disappeared from his face. His eyes were locked on something behind Harry. Alarm overtook Harry when he realized exactly what Malfoy had spotted.
Draco had a particular obsession with Harry’s hands, due in part to the frankly vulgar gloves mandated by the Auror uniform that made half the staff look like underground doms, but mostly due to the Fingerprint Incident, as Pansy liked to call it. He’d made many mistakes after the Incident: he’d thought about it, philosophized about it, wanked about it—but the biggest one by far had been telling
“Nothing.” Ron looked him up and down with narrowed eyes. “You missed your usual body percussion concert, is all.”
“You’re, uh.” Harry was smirking, color high in his cheeks. “You’re so bossy normally. I would’ve expected…”
“Oh no, don’t leave,” said Harry, smiling still. He looked up, only to be greeted by a full, unabashed, wide-eyed stare.
” Draco had hissed. They’d been in the lounge at El Paradiso, and Blaise had covered the tab, as always.
“I just don’t like strangers touching me,” he said, so low the sound of running water could’ve drowned it.
His ejaculate shot all the way up to Draco’s lips, darted hot and wet over his chest, his stomach. It should’ve been impossible, but a second orgasm ripped out of Draco on Harry’s last stroke, heady and all-consuming and nearly painful, white bright light behind his lids, light that his injured eye could somehow withstand at full force, and the echo of Draco’s shout hung in the air.
The bruise was still there, still angry and purple in the shadows of the locker room. All the torn skin from the contusion, blood red torn skin around the edges.
“It seems like a human name, is why I’m asking,” Harry scratched at the back of his neck. “Unusual for a pet.”
Draco stepped out of the shower. Despite his tiredness, his mind was restless, still brainstorming solutions for what went wrong on his latest DNA evidence test, when he heard a grunt a few stalls down.
He’d done this before. Before he was a Forensic Specialist, he’d been studying to become a Healer, but that was a thing of the past.
Harry would never eat in the Great Hall. Draco was worried, as he was kept in the dark regarding the other boy's condition.
"Harry, we've talked about this. No dueling, ok? You don't want to be expelled when there's only three months left of school!" Hermione admonished.
His taunting grew more by the year, until he realised that these were only his ways to seek attention from a person he actually liked.
"Ok, Goodnight, everyone!" said Ginny, awkwardly. Then, she got up and left, followed by her girlfriend.
Harry knew, though, that it would have been impossible for them to be completely clueless, since the whole school knew about it.
Ginny's face was rather shocked. She gave Pansy a look, her mouth still open. Pansy was also taken aback. No one said a word, the whole of the Great Hall was still in shock.
The pizza place they were in belonged to a family friend of the Grangers, so he sat them in his best table and promised to reduce the final price.
The day she turned nineteen was very special to her, she would see her friends and brother again after months.
Draco's laughs echoed through the courtyard as he thought that these people were truly wonderful to him. He would have never been able to thank them enough.
"I love you too, Luna Lovegood." Then, she cupped her face and kissed her softly, in front of the whole bar. She wasn't afraid and she didn't care about what people thought, she had been through too much to even worry about some looks.
"Ah, Potter, I'll say it again" Mr Malfoy addressed him, livid. "You find pleasure in ruining families, don't you? My son had never felt anything towards other males, before you. You somehow put it into his head. Did you use a love potion, perhaps?"
Hermione confidently walked towards the Head Table and shook the professor's hand when she reached her destination.
Draco had never seen it from the inside before. It looked definitely old, he observed, but it had that atmosphere of cosiness that he could not ignore. It looked much like the tree house that he used to have in his own garden as a kid, for there was a lot of wood on the walls and ceiling.
For one, they would always be sitting close, they would hold hands and call each other "love" or "babe".
"... even though you'd find an unabated enjoyment in making me jealous, with Krum..." Ron continued, making Hermione look down.
"This is so ethically wrong! I wonder how you will be able to sleep at night, after this disgrace!" Draco yelled, acting like he was outraged, then the chase began.
In the days that followed it, he couldn't help feeling a mixture of excitement and terror, as the Big Day was getting closer and closer.
The room was complete with a table filled with butterbeers and snacks and there was a pouf for each person to sit on.
"Hi, everyone..." the redhead awkwardly waved his hand, then he put it back down, wiping it on his robe. "Hogwarts is where I met my best friends, but also where I met my one true love. Well, I didn't know that when I met her, but, with time, after many fights and tears, we fell in love. Here is also where we conceived a child..."
Ginny bashfully took off her hat and gave it to her. "If you cold sign this, I'd be happy." she managed to say. "I'm Ginevra Weasley, by the way."
Harry wasn't looking at his lover, not yet. He was not moving and he was merely staring at Hermione while she walked.
"Then, I guess you don't know your son at all." Harry smirked. "He likes men, all right. Because he makes love to me, every. single. night."
Ginny was often alone in her common room, but she had managed to make friends with some girls from her year.
Draco finally got up and ran towards Ginny. He then tried to snatch her camera out of her hand, but the girl's grip was stronger than his.
The six friends had VIP passes, which meant that they could meet with the players after the game. Also, two gadgets per person were included.
"Ah, what an adventure!" Arthur exclaimed while entering the house. Molly ran to him, gave him a kiss on the lips and then removed his coat. "Finally! We were beginning to worry!" The woman said, putting her husband's coat on the hook.
"See, my mother isn't so bad." Draco happily observed, pushing his boyfriend playfully forward as they stepped on the soft grass.
"It's so weird to think that this all started with Draco pushing Harry to the ground." Hermione pointed out.
"Yeah, but... I mean, this is a special occasion... You say maybe I could have gone with her? It's not like they invited me or anything." Ron complained. Sometimes, he was worse than Hermione when it came to sulking.
"You knew this was going to hurt us." Harry said. "Don't you dare sit here with us. Oh, and consider yourself out of the Quidditch team."
He would try going in the Gryffindor common room, but the password had changed, so there was nothing he could do about it.
He and his friends were in the Gryffindor common room, sitting on sofas, their trunks standing next to them, ready to go.
Meanwhile Draco, at the Slytherin table, was not willing to touch food. He was looking down at his plate, sadly, unable to get the fight from the previous night out of his head.
The man beside her couldn't keep his tears from falling at the sight of this crying baby boy, happiness and excitement taking over him, realising he had just become a father.
"Morning, Mione." said Harry. "I think Ron's trying to clean his feet with the toilet brush." He said, chuckling softly.
Suddenly, an explosion of flavour invaded his mouth. His eyes fluttered back as he took in the delicious taste of this simple muggle food.
"Mione..." Harry began. He was beginning to think that it wasn't a bad idea to have kissed Malfoy, it was a terrible one.
In that moment, Draco heard a familiar noise, it was the passage to the common room opening, therefore someone was entering. "Must be him." Draco muttered, looking behind his back.
"Um... no. Mum said that he never would have agreed to that, so... she said a surprise would be better." Ron said. He, too, seemed a bit nervous.
"Well she hasn't seen her parents in four months, can you blame her?" said a nearly exasperated Harry. Although, neither he nor Draco could have possibly related to how she must have felt.
She found it so unfair that she had been the fool this whole time, crying over Harry while he was screwing around with Malfoy. To think that in two years Harry had never touched her below the waist... and now there he was, giggling about his sexual encounters with Malfoy.
"Thank you for your services, really. Your information is crucial for the fulfillment of our plan." Narcissa said, beaming.
"Ginevra, this is not how I raised you. I was also shocked at the news of Harry and Malfoy - believe me, it is hard to accept, also because I didn't know about your breakup, but that is no way an excuse to attempt at ruining his life like this. Do you even know what that could do to a person?" Molly reprimanded her daughter. She was very, very disappointed in her,
"Well, boys, I'll leave you to it. I'm expecting you to work on what I've just told you, ok?" Miss Sivan said, then left as expected.
The lunch went on fine and it culminated with a chocolate sponge cake log called a "bûche de Noël", a dessert that was usually eaten in France as a Christmas Tradition. Fleur had spent a good amount of the afternoon of the day before making it alongside Mrs Weasley.
Every year had left him something permanent, even the year prior to his last- he had helped save the world and finally found the courage to make a go on the girl that he'd liked for years.
Before Harry could realise what was going on, his old room mate, fellow DA member and close friend, Neville Longbottom, had already cast Petrificus Totalus on him.
"Yeah, sure. I'll try not to win too much." Draco teased. "Either way, you will end up with a sore ass, as I'll throw you off your broom."
Meanwhile, at the Defence Against The Dark Arts class, the new professor for that year, Miss Sivan, came bearing results for the NEWTs mock test the students had taken a week earlier.
Harry looked at him with widened eyes. "Are you serious? You're, like, the only one who truly finds it appealing!"
Draco was unable to move, or to process anything at the moment. He was standing in the middle of Hogsmeade, no coat on. He was cold, but he didn't mind it.
"I love you, Hagrid, it's been nice to see have you as a friend here. I'm sure I'll see you again many more times!" Said Harry, tightening his grip on his good friend.
"Relax, I'm not gonna detach them from your body." Harry said with a chuckle. Then, he pointed his wand at his boyfriend's feet. A moment later, his shoes had turned into ice skates.
"I can't either! It feels like yesterday that we hated each other..." Harry responded, raising his head to look at the other boy.
"No, Harry, we can't just destroy all that we've built so far because of him. That's just what he wants. We are stronger than that, remember?" the grey eyed boy said, moving closer to Harry, holding his hand.
He turned around to look at her. "Mione, I will murder him. I can't stand him, he's touching all over my boyfriend!"
Lucius put his wand down, glaring at Harry and his son."Draco, if you ever decide to come home, I swear to you I will kill you." he said, then he left.
Luna thought that Ginny, in that moment, looked like a strawberry, her favourite fruit- her body was filled with freckles and it was embellished by her fiery red locks.
Harry had to be in character, though, so he quickly pretended to protest. "Oh, but I have Quidditch practice!"
"Draco..." his dad murmured, grabbing him by his shoulders. "Remember who you are. You can have the glory with us... you can be as rich as you'd ever imagined..."
The Room of Requirement didn't fail to deliver expectations. There was a table, dressed in a very elegant table cloth, an emerald green one that sported a Slytherin patch.
"I told you, dear, he can not always be available for communication, given his situation." His wife reassured. She walked closer to him and place a loving hand on his shoulder. "You will see, he will be here any minute."
True. If Draco had spent the whole of Christmas Break alone in Hogwarts, he would not have left his bed. He had become somewhat dependent on Harry, he had created a routine with him which included seeing him daily, sleeping in the same bed... as of now, the thought of even a week without him was unbearable, as he was all that he had.
"Hello, everyone." she said, taking out a small piece of parchment from her pockets. She began reading shortly after. "Firstly, I feel I'm obliged to thank our Headmistress, Professor McGonagall, who made this school livable again. Also, she has been a very important figure for me among teachers. Secondly, I must thank our fallen professors, Dumbledore and Snape, whose sacrifice will not be forgotten. But mostly, I have to thank the school itself for giving a young Hermione Granger a chance to study its wonderful subjects!" When she was done talking, she had to wipe several tears. Professor McGonagall was in the same situation. Hermione's words had moved her to an extent.
Her cheeks were both red, she was wearing a large hat that covered her eyebrows and her Slytherin scarf kept going left and right.
"Happy fourth month-and-a-half-a-versary, Lu. Hoping this will the fourth of many." Ginny said, smiling fondly.
It didn't take Ron a long time to get ready; Harry, on the other hand, was having a hard time with fixing his hair.
That afternoon, at lunch time, the new couple decided to use their meeting place for something different: a date.
The rest of the Christmas day was spent exchanging presents, singing and eating biscuits in front of the fireplace.
"I need back up here!" Said Harry, calling to his friends, who happily obliged and went on to participate in the tickling frenzy.
Hermione's parents, Laura and Donald, had invited all her friends over, mostly as a Thank You to the Weasleys for having given their daughter a place to stay on so many occasions.
He was beginning to consider asking the Headmistress  to make an exception for him and let him hang out at the Gryffindors' as much as he wanted, given his situation. He wondered if he could ever find peace in his own dorm again. But that was unlikely, given how much shit Blaise was giving him lately.
"Donald! Rosemary! Come on downstairs! Food's ready!" Hermione's mum called out, ignoring the wishes.
Luna was wearing the dress she had worn when they got together, it was black with blue abstract figures drawn all over. She had one of the blue gloves as a necklace - there were two holes and inside of it ran a silver chain.
"Oh um... I was just looking for Ginny..." Harry said, but Hermione must have known that it was an obvious lie.
Luna was confused at the sight of a pissed off Harry sitting next to her. "Oh hi, Harry, why are we glaring at Ron and Hermione? Are the nargles behind it?" She asked him in her usual dreamy voice. He simply nodded.
"In this life, I never knew luck." Draco continued, looking straight into Harry's eyes. "But you are the only luck I will ever need. You saved me. And every day you make me the happiest person in the world... I never want to forget how you make me feel."
The brunette glared at him slightly, but she went on, "But then Harry fell in love with him and I was forced to spend more time with him... Doing so, I was able to see that no one in this world can make my best friend happier than Draco can!" When she finished, she wiped a stray tear from her eye and cheered for the couple.
"Oh, Mr Longbottom here will not come with us, no. He told us everything. You blackmailed him into spying on his friend and later sabotaging his wedding to avoid his grandmother getting hurt by you." Auror number two said.
"Now," Miss Sivan's voice interrupted. "I say, if everyone is alive and well, that I give you all five minutes to recover from the shock, then, we carry on with this thing."
"Oh, Potter, I'm surprised you haven't noticed yet... You have got some nerve, really! Having Draco all to yourself! When we both know that he should have ended up with me!" Jean Jacques said, fury in his face.
"Exactly two and a half months ago," she said, grinning excitedly. "You finally saw the light and started dating me, forgetting about the Wrackspurts."
Draco’s heard that before, but in this case, he’s pretty sure Potter’s just huge. He goes farther up Draco’s ass than anything else ever has, even Draco’s toys. It’s thicker than any of Draco’s toys. He feels like it’s going to bulge out against his stomach, like when Potter comes it’ll burst him apart. Fuck. Potter isn’t even wearing a condom. It makes Draco shiver—he feels dirty. He tries to tell himself Potter won’t have any diseases; he’s the fucking golden boy... but there’s no way to know, and now it’s too late. Draco can feel the coarse hair against his ass when Potter gets all the way in, Potter’s balls slapping into his cheeks.
Yet somehow, the scruffy-haired, fool-hardy, scar-headed boy in front of him gets all the attention, and when the third last person leaves the locker room, he calls, “See yah tomorrow, Potter!” ...As if Draco isn’t even there.
“Shut up!” Draco’s stance has gone from casual to tense in a heartbeat, his cheeks from pale to red. He doesn’t want to admit how on the head Potter’s hit it. He’s running adrenaline now, with no control over his words, like every time they ever ‘talk.’ “You wish.”
When Potter pulls back, Draco desperately tries to follow. Potter leans away with a smirk, and before Draco can protest, he grabs Draco’s shoulders and turns him roughly around against the locker. Draco braces himself against it, head swimming. He looks over his shoulder, and Potter flattens against him, broad hands running down his lithe sides. “We should have at least half an hour before the janitor gets here,” Potter purrs, in a thick voice that almost makes Draco melt. “Plenty of time to live out one of your fantasies, fag.”
Then Potter pulls out, suddenly and inexplicably, and Draco topples to the floor. He leans against the locker, sweat slicked and breathing heavy, and he looks up at Potter with wide, dilated eyes. Potter’s spent cock hangs right out at face-level. It’s sticky with cum and lube and still tremendously hard.
Potter takes a step closer—it’s like something out of one of Draco’s fantasies, except it’s real, and he stumbles backwards. But Potter turns, and that leaves Draco nowhere to run; Potter backs him into the lockers. The metal’s cold against his bare skin, and Potter continues, close enough to make Draco shiver, “You know, I actually used to wonder why you’d always go out of your way to be such a dick to me. At first I thought it was just jealousy, since it’s obvious I’m better than you at just about everything, and unlike whatever idiots you went to high school with, no one gives a shit here about what your daddy can buy you. But then I realized it’s more than that. You haven’t gotten off my back since I turned you down in first year. If I’d really known how you wanted to be on me, you might’ve gotten another answer...”
“’Ey! What’re you two doing here?” He glares at them both, like it’s a sin for the swim team to use the pool. Why on Earth he chooses to work at a school when he clearly hates people is a mystery.
All thoughts of that go out the window as soon as he feels Potter pulling back, and he peers back to see Potter stepping out of his speedo. A lump grows in Draco’s throat, and he stares like his eyelids are broken.
Draco’s whole body is on fire. His skin is tingling with the pleasure, and it more than drowns out the pain of being stretched too wide. Then Potter thrusts into it again, and Draco’s just as loud. Potter must love that, because he keeps hitting the right spot, again and again. Draco’s hard again in no time, and it’s torture not to be touched. But it’s also heaven. If this is Potter’s idea of a punishment for Draco picking on him, it isn’t very effective.
Potter smirks like it’s all going according to plan, and what he says makes Draco’s eyes grow to saucers. “I think it’s the other way around, Malfoy. Or do you really believe I’m too stupid to notice the way you look at me?”
His ass clenches around Potter’s cock as it all pours out, and Potter bites hard into his shoulder. A minute later, Potter follows, lurching forward to grind Draco into the locker, exploding inside his ass. Draco only screams louder. If Potter weren’t pinning him firmly up, he’d be on the ground in seconds.
Potter frowns. Draco scowls and closes his locker, strolling past Potter. He walks over to the exit and grabs the handle—the door stubbornly doesn’t move.
Draco jerks his locker open and peers around it, so he can call, “I am going to bug you every fucking day, scar-head.”
He’s ecstatic when Potter pulls out just that, closing the locker again afterwards. Why Potter has a jar of lube floating around his locker, Draco doesn’t have the wherewithal right now to guess. Instead, he just moans as Potter pours an ample amount into his palm. Draco watches rapturously as he slicks up his cock. Draco’s hands itch against the locker; he should be doing that. He opens his mouth to say so, but then Potter’s fingers are slipping back to his ass and words fail him. Instead, Potter says, “Knew you just wanted my cock, you little bitch... should’ve just asked, ‘stead of following me around like a whiny puppy...”
Potter’s locker slams closed. He doesn’t say bye to Draco, because they’re not like that, and he struts out of the change room, shirtless. His loose jeans are low down his hips, the tip of the speedo peeking over it, making Draco’s traitorous mouth water. He watches Potter disappear around the corner with equal parts hatred and lust, wondering why he ever wanted to come to this stupid school.
Draco frowns at it, making a mental note to tell his father about this. The door doesn’t seem impressed. When he glares over his shoulder, Potter’s standing there. “Told you. ...I guess we’ll just have to wait for the janitor to get here.”
“So you can pull me out. I’m sure even you can figure out mouth-to-mouth.” Potter slams the locker closed, looking straight at Draco, who realizes belatedly that he’s standing too close.
But he doesn’t get anywhere, just leans traitorously back into Potter’s hands, and Potter gets the hint. He pulls them right down, tugging them right over Draco’s ass, cutting across his cheeks and making him shiver. Potter scrunches them all the way down, until his cock is bobbing against his stomach and his balls are cradled in the swimsuit. Potter’s hands are all over his ass cheeks in a second, kneading them and playing with them, squishing them and pulling them apart. Draco can’t help himself; he moans. He isn’t embarrassed about his ass in Potter’s hands—he knows he’s got a great ass, and he’s more than happy to show it off. But he’s embarrassed because it’s fucking Potter, and Draco shouldn’t be this weak...
Draco instantly jerks away, head whirling, but Potter when arches back to let him, Draco doesn’t actually go anywhere. Trying to sound more menacing than he feels, Draco growls, “Don’t you fucking dare—”
Draco’s breath hitches as Potter talks, his brain still reeling to catch up. Potter’s now looming over him, one hand to either side of Draco’s head, pinning him against the lockers like some high school girl. It takes Draco a second to really process what’s happening—that Potter’s offering ‘another’ answer.
And he is definitely going to have that inside him. Even if Potter didn’t look like a feral beast right now, Draco would be virtually insisting. Not wanting to ruin the moment, Draco decides he’ll just have to insist on other times, too, so he won’t have to face the moving on problem. ...Once Potter realizes how amazing Draco is in bed, he’s obviously not going to want to leave, either.
Draco winces but can’t say anything. He doesn’t know what to say. He wants to yell his head off at Potter, taunt him and hate him and hit him. But then this might end, and Draco doesn’t want that any more. Scrunching his eyes together, he turns back to the locker, pressing his forehead against it. Fuck. He has no idea what to do, and in the absence of his suggestions, Potter’s thumbs hook in the waistband of his swim trunks.
Draco’s knees want to buckle. Potter fucks harder than anyone else Draco’s ever had, vicious and relentless, and then his hands start moving. He touches every part of Draco, running up Draco’s taut chest, squeezing his nipples, scratching his thighs. Potter won’t touch his cock though, and when Draco tries, Potter grabs both of his wrists and pins them up again, holding him still. Potter bites the shell of Draco’s ear and growls, “You don’t deserve to touch yourself.”
Even when Potter catches his expression, Draco can’t look away. Potter chuckles darkly at him; Draco just licks his lips. Potter definitely lives up to the rumours. He’s easily got the biggest cock Draco’s ever seen in person, maybe even in porn. It juts out from his hips proudly, fully hard, arching slightly and dark with need. The mushroom head is already sporting a single bead of precum, and veins twist all down the shaft—it looks like Potter’s cock has been doing pushups. His balls are equally as well proportioned, pert and hanging under the set of dark curls. How Potter manages to stay confined to such small swimsuits, Draco has no idea.
Immediately, Draco sneers, “My father practically paid for this whole building; I think I’m more than entitled to use it.”
Draco’s swim trunks are still down around his thighs. He can feel Potter’s cum trickling out of him, and he wonders belatedly if it’s ruining his swimsuit or not. It takes a second for Draco to manage, “You should’ve used a condom.”
Because if this is what Draco gets for being a bitch, he’s never going to leave Potter alone. It’s too amazing. Even with his cock untouched, Draco can feel it coming. He wants to stop it—wants this to go on forever, but his body doesn’t get that—his balls start to tighten, his stomach clenching. The orgasm rips through him like a heat wave, and then he’s shooting thick spurts of cum all over the locker. He screams, “Harry!” and hates himself for it.
It takes him a second to be able to look up at Potter’s face, which is flushed and half-lidded, lust-clouded and confused. Draco’s eyebrows knit together; he needed Potter to explain what the fuck this was—what this changes, what this makes them. But Potter looks as lost as he does, and that’s mildly infuriating.
