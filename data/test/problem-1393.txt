“They’re magnificent.” Draco snapped his fingers, and the doors shut. He glanced around in a nervous way. Harry should have already made for the stairs, probably, but this odd exchange had captured his attention. “Where’s my mother?”
“I haven’t left the house in two weeks. I only went to collect some things from Pansy. That was the end of it.”
“We never do the same thing twice. Most places add their own touch, as well. Sides, Shield Wizards running to every school and business’ll put the whole city in a panic.”
None of it surprised Harry, but he had hoped for something more…concrete. “It does seem that way. Me being a prat.”
And they would have seen him in the papers, looking totally normal and alive. No clue as to his loss of memory.
At some point, he’d had this with Teddy. A chubby, giggling thing that spat up potato and depended on him completely. Now that thing was grown enough to go off to school, and Harry didn’t know anything about him.
“How are you reading so fast?” Dean muttered in an undertone to Élise, still on the second page. Draco sighed sharply and crossed one leg over the other.
, he slid a hand into his pants. His flaccid cock just barely twitched as he pulled a hand up over it. People did this, didn’t they? And it would certainly put him to sleep. The urge had been there the past few days, particularly in the mornings. He’d staunchly ignored all of them.
“So it’s only half illegal,” Harry said. She glared. “Come on, we’re gonna be late to the Broomsticks.”
Harry told him. He considered taking Castor with him through the Floo, but that was quite dangerous. Animals were like babies, that way. You couldn’t Floo or Apparate them without the proper precautions.
Harry sat at the edge of the cushions, flipping until he found the flower-woman artwork again. There were other illustrations, but that one seemed to stick out. “A book.
Finally, his anxiety caught up, and he opened his mouth. She held up a finger for silence, pushing open a heavy wooden door on the right. Warmth flooded out.
“Mum’s flipped, though,” he muttered, gazing into the distance. “She’s owled me five times today, wanting to come see you. She doesn’t know…well, if you get a Howler about it, I’m sorry.”
“Ms. Abadi,” Minerva cut in, enough ice in her voice to make both students straighten their spines. “With me.”
He shoved himself in front of her, backing well away so she was more on the stoop than in the house. “That thing’s
He returned her smile, casting a Lightening Charm on the bag and shoving it into an inner pocket. “I’ll just be going, then. Thanks for the tea.”
“Well...Horcruxes are only peripherally understood. If you can harness this kind of magic, the Department of Mysteries will want to know how you did it.”
“You are. You’re the problem.” With that, she strode to the door and opened it. Harry bit back a scream of rage. “I know you don’t realize it now, Harry, but this is the cruelest thing you have ever done to me.”
“If it eases your mind, Potter, I can assure you I haven’t been scrubbing floors and mending walls.” He pulled his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around. It made him look even more painfully thin. “It’s the house.”
“It won’t be so bad. For him,” she reasoned, walking a small circle between the couches and waving specific patterns in the air. “The house likes purebloods. Walburga always called Ron’s family ‘blood traitors’, but they were still fairly comfortable. I wonder what she’ll think of Draco. Here.”
“Ministry officials trained to investigate and apprehend Dark wizards.” The words sprang forth without too much thought. He just
Élise flipped it open, finding a page near the back and pushing it back to Ron. “There. Once he drinks the potion, anyone with the Mark will know what he’s done. They’ll be connected long enough for him to – “
Her smile was wry. “I won’t give you a history lesson, Potter. Now, I believe someone is waiting for you.”
“Yeah.” He shrugged. “She uses it every single day, I reckon. Some days she’ll work late, but most of the time she doesn’t. Most of the time, she comes home at exactly five, but she’s so
“It’s not working,” Draco grunted, ramming his shoulder into Harry’s as he yanked on the curtain. “What –
“Something that’s been bothering me.” If he was waiting for Draco to look back up, it didn’t happen. He was glancing between an open tome and his parchment, the black quill dancing across the page..
It was rather harsh, Harry thought. But Ron nodded and stepped back, giving him a shrug as he followed the others. And then he was alone with her.
Which seemed to imply Castor knew where he had been, and with whom. Who knew snakes could be so catty?
Dean and Seamus sat on either side of him. Debra stayed at her desk – Harry heard her quill scratching. Draco sat imperiously straight as they pored over the documents. To avoid being glared at, Harry opened the front cover. The penmanship was spiky and severe:
“Just take a picture of each page past the seventh chapter. If you can’t get it all, do your best. It’s not too enormous of a book.”
Cloak, he kept calling it. Harry only understood it very little, but he was sympathetic to the fact that it could really be considered something like a holy grail to people raised on those wizarding stories. Ron and Hermione talked about it like a useful tool.
Mud had filled his shoes, so his feet squicked and squished when he started walking. Every few meters, he would run into a tree trunk. The wet, rough bark cut at his hands when he reached out, leaning heavily against it. He had to get help. Losing blood was bad. He should…he should do something…
“You’re letters have been so nice. I – I – “ He leaned forward, pressing his forehead into Harry’s chest. “I’ve been so worried about you.”
Teddy said in a strange tone, eyes wide. The floor seemed to crumble out from under him as he realized the entire stadium had their faces turned to the Staff box.
Yet as he stepped forward off the ledge, Draco tensed, drawing his briefcase closer to his body in surprise. There was a moment where they just stared at each other, then Draco looked up at the house, his features blurred by the rain. When he walked across the street, it was with long, irritated strides.
“Nearly there,” he said out loud, patting his pocket. When he got back to his house, he set his bags down and took the bubble out. It felt hard like glass, but shimmered like soap. He turned up his central heating and Levitated it to the carpet.
Harry shook his head, taking in the subtle hardening to Teddy’s expression. His hair might've gone a shade darker, edging toward black.
Harry got through one page on libration before his eyes unfocused. Practice. “How much of the day do you work on that thing?”
“Hey-O!” An older man stepped through the garden door and peeled off thick leather gloves. His lined face was smudged with dirt. “My boys!”
“No, don’t apologize.” She wiped quickly at her eyes, sniffing. “We weren’t certain if…if he was telling the truth. I’ll go get Ron.”
He and Élise picked at the Ploughman’s Lunch in the center of the sticky table while Debra and the other guys compensated by putting down far too much beer. The muggle pub was crowded and smoky. Oddly comforting, again, to not be stared at.
Harry tapped out so Charlie could have a turn, walking over to the table on wobbly legs. A warming charm washed over him as he drew near and sat on the ground next to Hermione. Fleur had a blanket spread for Victoire to crawl about on.
“Come on.” She finished off the tea and Vanished the bottle. “Mum’ll have kittens when we show up together.”
“Sounds good. Hey – “ he stopped her, checking to make sure Ron hadn’t come outside. “Is it all good between you two?”
It wasn’t until he left that he realized she’d locked the doors after he came in, putting up the closed sign. About forty people were standing at the windows, watching him shop.
The bathroom was messy, too, but not unclean. He stepped over a pair of jeans and a crumpled shirt, almost surprised to see his reflection in the mirror. A floating cloud of confused mist would have been more appropriate, but, alas, he was a man.
Draco did raise his wand, finally, to draw down another china plate. While Harry adjusted his weird-ometer (George would be hard-pressed to best this one), he moved close again, sitting on the long bench. The eggs didn’t need any assistance, it seemed. After a moment of watching them move around on their own, Harry sat down, too. “What else can it do?” He asked.
Sometimes Ron would cut one of them off if a tangent grew too long or Harry had a question. There was just
“Everything,” Harry said, relieved his voice didn’t crack. “I’m sorry, but when I woke up I didn’t even know my own name.”
He was exactly as weird about it as Ron had been. “You two just look alike. It’s almost like you’re brothers, or something.”
Harry darted forward, remembering how Hermione had instructed him to shut her up should this ever happen. The old woman in the portrait was clearly beyond reason, wailing and rocking back and forth in whatever chair she had been painted into.
“Wouldn’t’ve put you for a cheater,” Harry sniped, they fell into an almost familiar step, circling each other. Harry’s feet moved on their own.
There was a bathroom at the base of a sharply-inclined staircase. She started yanking his sweater over his head before he’d even stepped over the threshold.
“Professor Sprout,” Hermione pulled her scarf down and gave the woman a half-hug, her smile wide as she looked up at the castle. “It’s been too long.”
“Smashing.” Neville tightened the collar of his robes, pulling his large silver earmuffs into place. “The Swedish Bubotubers just came into season. The students’ll go mad for ‘em… And the Starthistles are just starting to hibernate for the winter, so I can start to extract the nectar for shipment to St. Mungo’s.”
His bad shoulder throbbed from where he’d landed on a book. It smelled like something was burning. That got him to his feet, looking all around. The Floo flames died out, and there didn’t seem to be another source of the smell but for the cauldron.
Harry asked, trying to be quiet. Parseltongue was a pretty much one-volume-fits-all language. A tongue flicked out from under the armchair. He’d hidden away from them the night before – probably hanging out near the heating vents in Harry’s bathroom.
“I thought I’d take over. Unofficially. Just until you’re better. You can still help out around here, or not. I guess it’s up to you. “
The Slytherin leanings echoed the aristocracy bleeding from every room. The chaise lounges and ornate mirrors. The art must have been nice, as well, but since it was all removed he guessed they weren’t the kindest of portraits. And the kitchen was built for magical cooking, which meant no cutting boards, stovetops, or even an icebox. Harry was at a disadvantage. Whatever little knowledge he must have had about this stuff had been wiped away.
He made certain Hermione was still asleep before pulling on Ron’s abandoned robe and stepping onto his front stoop. The married couple next door were on their porch, huddled under a duvet with mugs of steaming tea. The basset hound ran through the snow with glee, chasing a ball that fetched itself. Neither of them waved until he did, and they shared a look that he could see was surprised, even at a distance.
– relieved passed through Draco’s posture, then he glanced at the snake and shook his head. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
began, symbols were found by an exchange student in a Swedish cathedral. Their placement and symmetry was similar, but the glyphs were Masonic in origin.”
“Harry, dear, sit. You must be hungry.” With incongruous strength, she pushed him down into a chair.
“I just told him that my perspective is shit, and he should talk to some other people sometimes. About stuff. And don’t turn this around – he’s
On the crosswalk ahead, a lorry kicked up a fine spray of puddle that didn’t touch them as they passed through it. The umbrella had an Umbrella charm over it – clever.
“You-Know-Who’s main men were our biggest concern. Avery, Nott, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle…they’re all dead or in Azkaban, now. Except for Dolohov and Macnair.”
Despite Harry’s joke, the book looked very serious. It was relatively thin, but words were packed densely onto each page wherever there wasn’t a spindly diagram to look at. If this was the
Harry clenched his jaw tightly. It looked like he had to send his cousin into battle again. The presence of Cedric in this palace would only make him feel grouchy. He will never calm down if he doesn't manage to keep the prince away from his wife.
All his life, Draco had been against sharing glasses and plates with other people. But this time, he accepted it for fear that Ares would be offended if he refused. There must be a reason why the majority of Greek poets said Ares was a cruel god.
Unexpectedly, Harry struck Alden with a single blow until the man's head leaned back, blood dripping from the corner of his lips. Draco gasped and almost screamed as Harry punched Alden repeatedly without a fight until the man fell to his knees with bruises, bleeding lips, and blood stained his shirt.
But unfortunately, Draco's gentle smile immediately disappeared when the image of his father, currently sitting in his oversized chair at Malfoy manor, seemed to be staring at Draco intently.
"He's not that attractive. I'm just not interested enough," Ares said while looking the other way. He lied, of course. He couldn't remember the last time he felt so passionate about a human. Neither did he say it because he wanted to please Aphrodite, but more to maintain his pride.
The whisper made Draco jolt out of sleep. The sky was already dark when the man woke up. He reached for his cell phone. It was getting late. The room was pitch black, only a faint moonlight penetrated the window.
Harry finally takes pity and switches their positions, gently lying Draco down on his desk and hovering over the pretty blond with a predatory grin. He slips his cock in Draco's slick-wet hole just as he kisses the blonde, swallowing his desperate cries.
"You were asleep," Ares stroked his head as if he were a child who had just done something stupid. But Draco was confused. How could he fall asleep waiting for Ares to finish talking to Goddess Hera? Was it because there was nothing she could do, and it was pretty late?
Logic forced her to let Draco go. She didn't want the prince to be the victim of a misdirection. His legs were a little weak when he was about to run. After all, Troya was a prince who has never exercised strenuously. Draco was reluctant to return to Sparta. Though he also hesitated to follow the envoy. From the start, he had decided to accept whatever his destiny was.
After tidying up the books that had just arrived this morning, Draco got ready to go home. After saying goodbye to the shop owner, Mr. Flitwick, Draco started walking towards the subway station to go somewhere. It took five minutes to get to the station.
Harry could sense the strangeness of Arabelle's movements. With his spontaneity, Harry's strong hands managed to grab Arabelle's back before it hit the still-wet grass.
"The doctor is working on him. He has fluid in his lungs. How about you, my lord, are you all right? Plunging down from the second floor like that to save that kid…”
"Why do you ask that?" asked Harry curiously when he saw curious twinkles covering Arabelle's two black eyes.
Lucius then raised one of his eyebrows before his lips pulled into a faint smile. "I trust you so much, I trust you so much, I even put you in the position of queen," He replied sarcastically.
The cold and piercing voice managed to make the girl raise her head. Her dark brown eyes collided with the grey eyes of the man who was standing proudly in front of her without wanting to help her up. She knew who the man was. He was the cousin of the man she was looking for.
Draco lowered Harry's thin robe covering his back to half his thighs with a very gentle motion. Of course, Harry noticed his wife's behavior which looked very elegant yet seductive at the same time.
"Daddy..." the blonde man began to whisper softly, begging, a small sob escaped his pretty lips. This time it was Harry's turn to take a deep breath before putting the book he was still reading on to his desk.
"I guess it doesn't matter. He'll be on Olympus forever. He can't tell any humans," Argus replied casually.
Draco had expected it, but hearing it straight from his husband's mouth was painful. He was indeed like a beautiful object to play with and then throw away when bored. Draco was grateful for constantly reminding himself never to expect to be in a real love affair with the God of War.
There was a picture of a woman standing in the middle of a rose garden, with a pink dress and long, shiny dark brown hair, laughing happily, as if she couldn't help but smile at whoever took the picture. The woman hugged her slightly distended stomach. She was pregnant. The woman looked happy… full of love, and to Draco's great surprise, the woman's face…. The woman's face... resembled Draco.
Draco's eyes filled with tears, not expecting Harry to be that cruel to tore off such a beautiful dress to show off his arrogance and power. Draco had given up his pride to be crushed by this monster, and what the result?! What a cruel man!
"I don't really like festivities, just celebrate our wedding with dinner that some close relatives attend. I'll think about the food," Draco dodged, thinking of an easier way to deal with it.
Draco smiled softly when he finally managed to read the last sentence in the book. Reading romantic novels like this tended to make his young souls feel resurrected. He somehow wanted to feel the strange feeling people called love. He wants to fall in love with the right man, and Draco wants to spend a lot of time with him.
"Offer you say?" Harry waved his hand in annoyance and snorted. "You can be prejudiced with all your unreasonable hatred, what you should know, everything you think in your pretty head is wrong."
"Hyde is the name of an assassin hired by my enemy," Harry sat on the chair where Doctor Jason had sat earlier. “He always manages to kill whoever he targets. And yesterday we managed to escape the accident that Hyde planned. The psychopath won't stop until he kills both of us."
He never felt short of a good man willing to date him, so he didn't give up easily and was reluctant to fully gave his heart. His teenage years were also busy with filming and school activities which made him miss the passionate teenage years. Draco knew that in time he would meet someone who truly deserved him. Not a man he'd only met for a day, especially when his soul was in another man's body like now!
"Don't even know what to do with yourself right now, huh? Got a cock, and it's completely useless. Like a little clit, just perfect for you to squirt all over yourself. So small and cute, barely in my hands, hm baby?"
Troya befriends Hadreda—the Centaur. Something that surprised him again. Because his lovers who had lived in his palace usually always focused on him alone. They never cared about other residents.
After making dinner, Draco decided to take a short walk in the common room, which was still covered in rags and mounds of dust. He browsed through the bookshelves and windows, then stopped in front of the fireplace. A large cloth stuck to the wall caught Draco's attention. He tried to tiptoe to remove the cloth, but his tiny body had a hard time reaching out.
"He asked me to love him. He thinks love can come suddenly and be forced," Draco grumbled, then took a sip of his lemonade.
Draco widened his doe eyes, angry at the other man. "On what basis have you decided where I should live? I want to go home!"
That statement made Draco turn his head again to look at Harry. He cleared his throat. His throat felt dry, making it difficult to speak, his stomach ached, and his head was dizzy. “You... promise?” Draco muttered weakly.
Harry sucked lightly on the tip, eyes never straying from Draco’s as his teeth grazed the tip as well. Draco sucked in a shaking breath. The blowjob he was expecting didn’t come. However, instead, Harry moved to spread Draco’s legs. Draco obliged to avoid falling over in the shower, placing a hand against the wall to keep himself steady. Harry then dipped his tongue into Draco’s crease, craning his head to get a better angle. His tongue ran across Draco’s puckered entrance.
Harry tried to remind himself again. The barrier was there, the density as if trying to keep Harry from entering it, and Harry pushed forward, claiming what was his.
Draco touched his cheek doubtfully, and the lovely figure in front of him also touched his cheek. His long hair is made into a braided low ponytail, a combination of braided hair and pigtails. Draco's eyes were frozen, still stunned by the reflection before him.
"Yes, I plan to ride a horse. The distance from this forest to the Delion kingdom is not too far. I want to enjoy this short torturous journey." Draco explained.
Draco was on one side of the vast gardens of the palace, wearing a comfortable cotton dress and a wide woven hat. The weather was sunny, and the sun was shining brightly but not hot because it was almost evening.
And as usual, Harry looked angry. Draco furrowed his brows. Why is that guy never the slightest bit cheerful and smiling? Even if he smiled, his smile was just a smile that was evil and cynical. Has that man never felt the slightest happiness in his heart?
"Find that blood, Alden!!" Harry shouted for Alden, who had actually been standing behind him. "He's going to help find Draco's blood. What's his blood type?"
Sometimes he was said to have been defeated by humans and humiliated. However, there was a strong suspicion that the shameful stories were written by poets who hated Ares. Those who despise Ares in their poetry were worshipers of Athena, the eternal rival of the God of War.
Lucius began to get drunk, sometimes screaming and crying alone on lonely nights. Until one day, his father drove their car, their only remaining treasure, and crashed into the parapet until the vehicle rolled several times. His father died instantly on the spot. The police said that his father's blood alcohol content was so high that it could be said that his father killed himself.
Draco sighed. He didn't know why everything he did always looked wrong in Harry's eyes. Because of this, Draco was very afraid to approach Harry if they weren't talking about something related to empire, politics, war, or commerce.
Arabelle stepped in as well, with her brain still raging. A luxury carriage was waiting for them. With the help of the coachman, the two of them finally managed to throw their buttocks onto the soft seat in the carriage.
Good. Draco nodded his head, followed Alden, then stunned and frowned when Alden led him to Harry's room.
And then, the perfect couple drifted away and sank into the hustle and bustle of the party, leaving Draco still standing there, clutching the business card as if it was his ticket to the rescue.
"We're on duty, Lasonas. I can't let my guard down. The Spartans might still be after us," Attica stated firmly.
Harry then took his hand off Draco, and they returned to his house. Harry's face looks a little strange, between shocked and disbelief.
Draco didn't notice. He was walking alone around the palace of Sparta. He walked past several girls who were swarming and gossiping. One of them was his not-so-beautiful half-sister. Now she was giggling and whispering an insult to him. Even though it was faint, Draco still had memories of Troya.
wife has the principle of not wanting to conceive from a man he doesn't love." mocked Lucius as he slowly walked around Draco's stiffened body.
Perhaps Ares can be equated with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president of his time. The difference was that Ares was older, more experienced, more dangerous, and more handsome.
Harry's frowned slightly when he could faintly inhale the scent of blood. Although the scent was faint, Harry was sure there was blood in the room. Harry's sense of smell was very sensitive to the scent that always accompanies him on the battlefield.
The poor blond whimpers weakly, trembling legs spread wide to accommodate his Daddy. He's much too out of it to gather a response, so a soft whine is all Harry gets in reply. He's not mad though, kissing Draco's temple lovingly.
Harry was silent and froze. When he finally looked at Draco, his eyes were cold as ice. The man looked really, really angry at Draco. "So, you admitted..." Harry stepped back again, and Draco felt immense relief that the man did not take his anger out on Alden, who had knelt helplessly on the floor.
Harry narrowed his eyes in disbelief when he heard the words. Embarrassing? Did the blonde not realize that he currently looks like an angel who accidentally fell from heaven?
In the morning, as usual, two young maids were tidying up Draco's room as if they were new. Draco still sat on the couch after taking a shower and let the maids make up his bed.
The Queen of Sparta was an obedient woman. She swallowed all the words of the Oracles and believed in them. The story of Tantalus was still fresh in the minds of the people of Greece. He was a devious demigod and king. He tried to test the knowledge of the gods by serving dishes from his own son's flesh at a banquet on Olympus. He also stole Ambrosia, the special drink of the gods, and Zeus finally ordered Hermes to bury his palace with stones.
For some time fixed to the window, Draco realized that there was something out of the usual. Several cars were seen passing in and out of Harry's house, which was usually deserted. Every day, Draco only took a sight of Harry's bodyguards and some servants passing by in the house's front yard.
"Ares isn't interested in me anymore. I might have to get out of his palace. After that, I'll be caught by a Satyr and forced to become his wife. Maybe I should meet the Cyclops first and be his meal," Draco complained.
Draco realized that he had forgotten for a moment that he was living in a primitive era. "Ah, that—my teacher at Sparta taught me," He dodged.
The presence of the prince was like an attraction for the residents there. Troya was a servant of Athena's temple and was a regular at the temple to make offerings on behalf of the King of Sparta. His regular appearance in public and his unusual beauty had made rumors about him spread throughout Greece.
"I'm not a whore," Draco hissed sharply. “Your wealth and good looks have absolutely no effect on me. All I want is your death because you have destroyed my family. But even if I don't get it, I'm satisfied enough to be separated from you!" Draco gave Harry a challenging look.
"Well, Potter is infamous for being...cruel. He looks cold and stiff, but when disturbed, he is ruthless. Sometimes I get a little bit of sympathy for his mercilessness."
"It's still alive! It's still breathing!" Draco said, annoyed, and it seemed the blonde had started to forget that the other man he was currently talking to was a king everyone should respect.
"She doesn't deserve to be side by side with Harry. I'll bet Harry will soon get sick of her and dump her." The sexy woman in black brushed her hair arrogantly. "As soon as he saw me, Harry would have liked me and threw that girl away."
Harry turned and looked at Alden with burning eyes. "Because I decided, it's not the time for him to die yet." Harry's green eyes sparkled in the dark. "And you... Why did you let him escape on purpose?"
Frowning, Harry sat on the edge of the bed and touched his fingers to Draco's forehead. The temperature was average; he had no fever. The wrinkles on Harry's forehead were getting deeper, so why did this guy say he was hot?
"Of course, Your Majesty," Draco placed his right hand gracefully on top of his husband's left palm, which had been open to welcome Draco's hand.
The bodyguard groaned and cursed, while Harry just stared at the commotion in front of him, chuckling with amusement. Draco tried to struggle, bite, and kick until he was exhausted. He gave Harry a breathless look, full of hatred, still in the firm grip of Harry's bodyguard.
Harry was surprised by Draco's behavior because of the blonde's position at this time. Harry could freely stare at Draco's chapped red lips, which for some reason, invited his desire to taste those lips.
Cedric understood. Draco accidentally reopened the old wound he had been keeping so deep. Cedric understood that the wound was still there today.
"I see. You can go back to your place." Harry turned away from Draco. He felt ridiculous. He shouldn't have had to act like this—dropping his pride in front of an Omega to attend a party of his pack mates that he attended too often in the past.
Harry immediately cast a disapproving glare at the young man in front of him, who was openly praising Draco in front of his husband himself.
Draco smiled slightly as he watched Arabelle walk in a hurry. It seemed that the young woman couldn't absorb the etiquette lessons from the teacher Draco had handpicked for her.
Draco uttered the words in his mind like a spell with trembling steps as he approached Harry, who was waiting for him like a king. He placed the glass on Harry's table.
The sound of hard metal being thrown was so loud. All the guards watching the battle held their breath when they saw Cedric managed to attack his sword right into his opponent's neck.
Carefully, he drew the arrow. After the arrow was pulled, he immediately used the handkerchief in his trouser pocket to bandage the poor bird's wings as it was starting to bleed.
"Zeus, that punishment is too much. Ares can't lose the title of god of war," Hera said after Athena left.
Real love comes to those who still hope after disappointment, who still believe after betrayal, and who still love after they have been hurt.
Doctor Jason turned and smiled to see Harry standing in the room. "Ah, the prince of rescue has finally come," Doctor Jason calmly pointed the knife at Harry. "You see, Potter. Your bitch is in the process of dying. I was going to present his dead body to you. But apparently, you came too soon."
One of the wasps made a sudden lunge toward the side of the jar, succeeding in toppling one step closer to Harry’s knee. He shuddered and pushed it away, crinkling a newspaper as he did. The
“Stay,” he said. Draco fixed him with a furious glare. But Harry knew he was afraid. Terrified, even, at the mere thought of Dolohov near the house. “You can sleep here. I’ll have Hermione double-check the wards tomorrow.”
He lifted her wand and opened his mouth. Every part of him seemed to know exactly what to do, except there was no word. There was a spell, he knew, but he couldn’t recall it. To cover for the err in memory, he tried the next thing he could think of.
“…No. I dunno.” Ron sighed and rolled his eyes. “I’m not stupid enough to ask him up front. Best let Hermione work it out.”
“I don’t pity Draco,” Hermione said cheerfully, pulling her coat tighter and brandishing her wand. “Wouldn’t stay here again for all the gold in Gringotts.”
of what he was doing, without ever having done it. But the weirdness faded after the first few hesitant strokes. He thought of Draco’s soothing voice, of firelight and book binding.
Draco turned around, cheekbones sharp in relief from the window light. “Preservation magic. Keeps them intact – “
Harry gripped his curtain and reached past Draco’s shoulders, expending massive effort to force them together. Something gave, and it worked.
Ron breathed, as the Seekers both twisted at the last second. They still fell onto the grass, but it was more of a controlled roll than a wreck.
Harry set the dog down, expecting it to run to its master. But it only darted around their ankles as they approached the cabin. Ron knocked, bemused.
“Whatever the curse was, there’s no visible reason it should have affected you this much. No head trauma, no degeneration.”
Weasley.” She fixed Ron with an uncompromising frown. “You will find Dolohov and put an end to this.”
After finishing the potion and leaving the groceries, though, he didn’t really have a reason to go to Grimmauld Place. All he heard of Draco was whatever she mentioned in passing, and those conversations were dangerous because she’d just ask him if he’d brought up the library yet, and Harry kept having to tell her he hadn’t.
As he pulled a maroon sweater over his head, he looked through the window. It was dark out, the street lit by yellow lamps. They were in the city, as evidenced by the glowing sky and nearby towers, but the closely packed townhouses were serene and quiet. A black cat trotted leisurely down the pavement.
“He’s got you helping him test things, again?” Ron snorted. “He’ll use your lack of memory against you, you know.”
Draco released him, but slowly, leaning against the headboard without pulling his feet up. “Both. Neither. Does it matter?”
He realized too late what he’d done, and the only solace in the sudden wailing from inside was that none of the Halloween crowd around him were able to hear it.
“Aw,” Hagrid blew an evasive breath. “Jus’ heard about – erm – through the grapevine, and – I, well, it’s not too often you get ter see a – “
He still hadn’t moved. His foot was between Harry’s, one hip digging to his side. Harry kept his hands balled into fists, counting down from ten until finally Draco inhaled sharply and moved away, replacing the original book and tucking the duplicate under his arm.
“As far as our interactions have gone, this one was rather pleasant,” she mused, turning them towards a warm looking diner. “I look forward to working with him.”
“No, no. You knew before.” He looked down at his tea. “I knew it wouldn’t be a big deal if I told you, because…you’re sort of – “
His back was against the wall in seconds, sending something clattering to the floor. “What – um – “ He pointed his wand, and Hagrid hurriedly pushed his wrist down.
Lee shrugged, still hopeful. “It’ll be the first game of the season. Always a madhouse – even you won’t be the center of attention. George doesn’t like crowds, either, but maybe he’d do it for a
“She’s going to treat you like a sick person. Whatever you do, don’t take any Pepper-Up.” Ron walked out of Harry’s closet with a red, knitted sweater emblazoned with a black H. “Put this on.”
“I remember it like yesterday,” Seamus said wistfully. Debra wasn’t as misty-eyed, but her frown softened as she looked at the superstructure. “And you don’t remember it at all. Weird.”
“The pain is dulled,” he said, ignoring Harry’s nervous silence. He raised his finger, showing off a faint red circle with a clear sting mark.
“Not yet. Can’t imagine it’s pleasant over there – the place already smells, and you remember how manky the Polyjuice – “
Ron looked all around, distracted. “Hm? Oh, yeah. She’ll meet us there. Where’s your Floo powder gone?”
Dread almost overpowered the pain as he drew closer to the building. The moon was out again, enough for him to see the glint of it off dark, empty windows. Thick brush grew along and up the sides of what looked to be a manor. The brick, even in night, was discolored. Aged. Filthy.
"Killing with a knife is my favorite," Doctor Jason played with the knife near Draco, making its flash dazzling in the darkness. "That's why I was called Hyde," the man chuckled cruelty at the light of fear emanating from Draco's silver eyes. "Yes, please let me introduce myself. I am the Hyde you are looking for."
"That woman is my husband's mistress. Her name is Arabelle," Draco said without being asked. He didn't want to let the silence suffocate him and the people who had entertained him.
Arabelle's words were only answered with a smile by Draco. He didn't want to give false hope to the innocent, naive young woman.
Draco was fascinated by the beauty of Ares Palace. The castle was arguably simpler than the palace where Troya lived in Sparta. There were no manicured flower gardens or artistic fountains, but Ares Palace was located in a cool valley. He allowed wildflowers to grow naturally and flourish there.
"I've only spoken harshly to a few types of women, one of which is like that woman of yours, that shameless
"So what do you want, Athena? If we want to kill each other, do it now! That bull monster wasn't strong enough to scratch my skin. Come down now and face me!" Ares challenged.
"Your Majesty, why are you still here?" Draco asked as he saw Harry sitting doing nothing on the lounger.
"Hey, Potter... Man, don't be too harsh on him. He didn't—" Greyson tried to calm Harry down, but his words were interrupted by the other man.
The Nymphs of about three people always accompanied Draco. They were always alert and agreed to Draco's requests, but they never spoke. They react by nodding and communicating with each other with a glance.
The noise from the entrance distracted Draco, his eyes searching, and…there he was! The man was there, with his furious arrival surrounded by tons of muscular bodyguards. Without realizing it, Draco snorted. Well, since he's a bad guy who likes hurting people, he must have a lot of enemies who want to kill him.
The man stepped into the room, and Draco felt Harry stunned for a moment staring at Draco's face, which was beautifully made up. But then Harry's eyes turned to Draco, who was still wearing the usual clothes he always wore in his room.
"I am a person who values time very much. Every second means a lot to me. Please take that to heart, Prince Cedric." Draco uttered coldly, again adjusting the distance between himself and Cedric.
Aphrodite looked emotional, her beautiful face filled with rage. Aphrodite did not love Ares, but all this time, the Goddess was sure—even though Ares had many other lovers—he loved Aphrodite. Having Ares disobey her had made the Goddess feel hurt. Seeing the annoyed Aphrodite, Ares immediately grabbed the woman's slender arm and then kissed the back of her hand lovingly.
"Uh, from today onwards, we'll be in trouble," Draco said, imagining how he would have to deal with the questions from his friends.
"No, I'm just trying to understand you. I don't know you that well so I don't know if I'll like you enough. Don't worry. If we don't get along, I will still be responsible for your life."
The young man was busy looking for spices in the garden, crowded with various wild plants. Draco could even find rare truffles there. But he needed more basil and rosemary for his meal tomorrow. He once took private lessons with the chef of a Michelin-starred restaurant, but he remains an amateur chef. Even so, he was sure that the food would taste better than what the Nymphs cooked. He didn't need to take this job too seriously.
"All right, try to get back to your room as soon as possible before your breakfast gets cold." Without saying another word, Alden rushed out of the room.
Draco ventured to face the man. And that is a big mistake. He saw those eyeballs gleam horribly in the middle of the darkness, a fiery red color.
"It's alright, baby, I'm here. Fuck! Daddy's here, baby boy." Harry gasps out, hips thrusting irregularly as he reaches his climax. He composes himself when he's ready to blow, slipping even deeper inside of his sweet boy and holding his position there.
Draco wiped his tears harshly. No! He had cried enough. He had to fight back at all costs! Draco slowly stepped into the bathroom. He had to take a shower and erase all the traces and stains Harry had left on his body. That monster may stain his body, but that doesn't mean he has Draco altogether. Draco is free, a free man that full of determination to destroy Harry.
Without saying anything, Harry immediately threw Arabelle's hand from his arm a little rough. The king took wide strides toward one of the unmounted horses. Obviously, that guy didn't want to be in the same carriage as Cedric.
Draco shivered, then he took a few steps back to distance himself from the pale-skinned man. "Fine, Potter, I can't just love you. It takes time and a process to love you. And not necessarily I can do that," Draco felt like he was explaining it to kindergarten kids.
Draco dived into Cedric's eyes for a moment, which looked as beautiful as the flower beds currently surrounding them. Until finally, a sweet smile graced Draco's face.
Draco nodded weakly. Alden helped Draco to his feet with his strong hands and supported Draco's limp body to the bathroom. When Alden opened the bathroom door, Draco acted as if his vomit would come out, so Alden immediately rushed him to the bathroom.
Ares looked thoughtful then scratched his chin before answering. "You know, generally, when a father accepts the dowry, it means he has given up his children. So, you have already become my wife," Ares explained.
"It's up to you if you want to believe me or not. I don't want anything from you. What I've seen and heard today has made me realize which side will work with me if your husband intervenes to finish this kingdom's coup."
Everyone fell silent, including Harry, and then professor Trelawney showed them a sketch. "Is this what you imagine? Has an ugly face and horns?" then she turned the page. "Or a demon’s face with angel’s wings?"
With the other man so close, Draco finally had the opportunity to clutch at that muscular body and stroke over Harry’s skin. Draco held the other to his chest, reaching a hand up to outline Harry's face before reaching around to claw at his back when Harry pounded his prostrate with a well-aimed thrust.
He absolutely must not reveal his true self from the future because he can be considered a magician. He also couldn't depend entirely on Ares because he could throw him away at any time. He was just an insignificant mortal and not even beautiful enough to compete with Aphrodite. His physique was now incredibly beautiful, but he can age and grow wrinkles on his skin as a mortal.
"Better to wait two years than two thousand years." Harry then walked to the couch in the middle of the room and sat down casually.
The servant was seen running in a hurry from inside the training area of the royal guards. The laughter escaping from the girl's lips, polished with a lip tint, immediately stopped. She was confused. Why was Glenice running around the royal guards' training area?
Harry was immediately filled with emotion from a very close distance. His jaw tightened hard. With his eyes already glaring sharply at his brother's back, Harry decided to get up from his seat and approach the brunette.
Daphne is indeed a very talented makeup artist and is very famous, of course, with her very, very expensive one-time make-up rates. Draco had heard her name many times in the media before but never thought he would feel this talented makeup artist's cold hands.
It wasn't Draco Malfoy who looked at him, the man who had only dressed up once in his life. Well, he was forced to do that for his benefit of carrying out a mission undercover as a waitress in a nightclub. In front of him is someone so lovely. It's amazingly beautiful with makeup that's not too heavy but fits perfectly on all sides.
Compared to discussing with the royal council members who only cared about themselves, obviously, discussing with Draco was more fun.
Draco turned on the light switch and scanned the room. Nothing unusual. But the last voice he heard, like someone whispering in his ear, was so close and real. Even Draco could still remember how the man's breath had hit his neck.
“Come on, Weasley,” Debra stood and stretched, propping one hand on her hip. “It’s a brilliant idea, and we can save ourselves a month of waiting.”
“New pet,” Harry explained, stepping back. She didn’t move until he was all the way back in the sitting room, shutting the door and pulling the hat off.
“He brought up…” she paused, wincing. “He apologized to me, when I was there Saturday. For everything that happened at the Manor.”
Yes. Right. Feeling a bit stupid, he stepped back again as the bricks rolled open like a great set of drapes, making certain his robes were fastened. He pulled his hood up for good measure as he saw just how many people were milling around. Maybe he could wear a headband, but his
A step to the left. “Alphard Black. He gave gold to the runaway nephew.” The tip of his wand slid down a bracket. “Sirius Black.”
“Here,” he said, finding the squashed Jack-O-Lantern pasty and handing it over. Teddy smiled, and it was wonderful.
Charlie blinked, and smiled wider, taking Harry by the arm. “Cider, then. And mum’s breaking out the photo albums.”
“Fine.” She disappointed him again by not rising to the jab at Ron. “I’ll be checking in semi-frequently. Weekly, maybe – “
Ron blew out a breath, shrugging again as his second beer was delivered. “Yeah, but. It’s the three of us.”
Again, he heard what went unsaid. Possible…but unlikely. If he could be fixed with magic, the Healers would have done it already.
“So did Hermione." He leaned in a bit. "She couldn’t find anything in here that explains why he could only do it once.”
Harry sat up, waving Ron away when he tried to help, or maybe stop him. No pain came from his abdomen. He pushed the thin blankets away and pulled up the pale blue shirt he’d been dressed in.
Ron nodded slowly, sniffing hard. They kept playing. Ron didn’t talk again, and Harry knew he wouldn’t. Not tonight. Not about the war and what had happened. Harry wouldn’t make him.
“That’s the drive up there,” Draco said, pointing toward a break in the trees. The cement of the road became darker and much newer. Harry could feel the magic sweeping over them already.
She shrugged. “It wasn’t in his dossier, but…I’d almost guess he was planning on using memories as ingredients in the potion, if the idea weren’t so…novel. I suppose I'll find out.” She sounded very excited at the prospect.
Quite harshly, she hushed him, setting the oven to simmer as they waited on Ron to return from the Ministry. “It’s alright. You were. Every parent acts a bit different around their children.”
“No,” George sighed. “I expect Ron told Fleur about the things Fred and I used to do to him. Has Mum been over here?”
She eyed the paper intensely for a moment, then looked up and recited something in stilted Chinese. Confucius gave some sort of answer before gathering his robes and stepping down from his perch. Ron and Harry both checked over their shoulders – no muggle so much as glanced their way, even as the stone podium silently sank downwards, unfolding itself into a set of stairs that led into a pitch dark blackness.
Harry gasped awake, sitting up so fast his shoulder protested loud and clear. A matching pain shot through his ankle. He sucked in sweet air, lungful after lungful.
“I won’t say a word,” he promised. She pushed past him and hung the sweater over the banister, tapping her fingers against the wood for a second, thinking.
The shop matron looked absolutely shocked to see him, but helped him well enough in picking out some sweaters, linen trousers, and even a few gauzy, blazer-cum-cardigan things he could wear around the house. The price made him cringe, but he had twice that in his pockets alone.
A touch of wariness entered Draco’ eyes. “Doing this incorrectly…would be catastrophic. I had to prepare. Though I do admit that Dolohov’s attack moved things along for all of us.”
McGonagall. No one had anything bad to say about her, but even the good things were tinged with respectful terror.
Teddy hadn’t really reacted when hearing Draco’s name. He seemed curious, but that was it. How much did he know? Did they even
I followed up with a counterpart of mine in the Greek Ministry, and she was able to confirm that the word means
Draco felt Harry's fingers begin to open his hospital gown one by one, then the hot hands burned on his bare skin, touching him intensely on all sides, causing a one-of-a-kind trembling, which made Draco squirm with excitement.
The young prince dipped his palm into the water to feel the coolness. He would not dare to do so in the modern era. But this is ancient Greece. No factory waste or pollution contaminates it. Draco slightly drenched his mouth and throat with clear water, and then he heard a strange sound behind him.
Unexpectedly, Harry smiled, then glanced at his bodyguard. "There's nothing that can refuse if I want to have something," He muttered dryly and gave his bodyguards a hand gesture.
With the breeze coming in through the window, Draco felt entirely at ease at the moment. He read a series of words written in the young cream-bound book with great enthusiasm.
Harry's hand then moved across Draco's naked back gently, making Draco lift his face to gaze at the other man, giving him a pleading look.
Was it because he had been secluded by his father all his life? Was that why his behavior was a little unique and often confused him?
Draco woke up due to extreme thirst. He sat on the bed and coughed a little. Slowly he looked around. It was bright. Maybe it's already afternoon. Draco carefully stepped out of bed and walked out of the room. Where is the kitchen? He wants to drink.
5. As nouns, the difference between Nephilim and Demigod is that Nephilim is a race of humans mentioned in the old testament, described as being physically impressive and heroic, while Demigod is a half-god or hero; the offspring of a deity and a mortal.
Draco was now able to sit up, and his eyes were busy scanning the room. He was in a sizeable stone-walled room. There were no lights installed, but candles were scattered in several places. Draco recognized the smell. It was beeswax, and the girl used to burn beeswax for aromatherapy. However, it seems that the candles were made manually without being printed, and they were irregular in shape and size.
“What the…” he only glanced over the article. They were speculating on a secret office romance for whom he was…
“I haven’t seen you two go at it like this in quite some time,” she said miserably, crossing her arms. Harry and Ron looked at each other, then away.
Ron. He’d heard that name. Just before he’d passed out. Back at that abandoned house, Ron had been one of the people Harry was afraid of. That seemed almost silly, now, because clearly he wasn’t in danger.
“One of my teammates needed new gloves. We shop at Side Ward over by Bond. I saw you did some shopping, as well.” She kicked out with one foot, rocking the bin back and forth. His shopping bags from the day before stuck out from the top.
Harry, unable to help himself, tucked in the edges of the covers round his shoulders. Something fell out from the fabric and hit his foot. The vial.
Draco picked his head up, eyes tracking Harry’s eyeline and just missing it. He had on his serious non-expression, but his eyes glittered with danger.
He didn’t think Draco expected him to ask that. The tops of his cheekbones turned the lightest shade of pink, his eyes taking on a far-off look. “It was surface level. I asked you who you were, to see if you'd answer truthfully or not. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular.”
“Another one, eh? Well, hurry up. I don’t want McGonagall catching us. You’re not supposed to know about this.”
When Harry looked up, Draco was giving him an expectant look. “I think she was reading it. Do you know what it's about?”
He heard it clearly in her voice – if Harry had woken up as himself, then it wouldn’t have mattered. But he hadn’t. Did that mean he was going to have to tell this boy that his own father didn’t remember him?
The student next to Teddy jumped to her feet, bending to whisper something in Minerva’s ear. She pursed her lips, and after giving Harry a very amused look, nodded. The girl – Asian features, spiky black hair cut in what he would hazard to call a mullet – squeezed around Teddy, holding out her wand.
All that was just the way he’d come; there were two more directions to explore. One was dark and hidden under overhangs – there were no people down that way. The other was nicer, and most importantly he could just see one extremely colorful roof above the rest. That’s where he was headed.
“You’re here! We saw you from the tower and ran as fast as we could – “ He stopped short, looking over Harry’s shoulder and blushing. “Headmistress!”
She fit it neatly into what little space was left in the heavy tote, then fixed her scarf around her neck. “Full moon’s Wednesday.”
He focused back on his hands, both gripping his wand and holding it in the potion, stirring very slowly. Harry set the book on a side table, hearing Draco almost silently counting to himself. His face was twisted up in concentration and frustration.
The burst of light was green, but couldn’t be reduced to a light spectrum. Not even just pain. It left
“And Draco,” Harry added, deciding not to admit he had no idea what a Dementor was. Dean and Seamus both looked up sharply at him.
“More than almost anything.” He nodded to himself and raised the bottle in a silent toast before finishing it. “To Quidditch.”
“Sure you don’t wanna call it a day?” Dean asked as Harry went to the shelves of weighted barbells. These Auror weights were particularly awful – charmed to become incrementally heavier as the lifter’s stamina decreased.
” he said, jabbing his wand. Harry didn’t get his own wand raised in time, and his tongue sealed itself to the top of his mouth. He very nearly panicked, then remembered that he could do wordless magic just fine.
“Hagrid,” Harry guessed. George said he was a half giant. It was still difficult to understand the full scale of his size. Air flooded into his lungs as he was released, stumbling back so Ron could fall victim to the next hug.
“Hm…” He may as well have spoken to the sofa. “Not the Network. Fidelus gets in the way of that.” She tapped her wand thoughtfully to her chin. “This might take a minute.”
It was all hopelessly mixed up, with her. She seemed to know so much, and yet he had a good feeling she wasn’t above a healthy amount of manipulation. Her compassion, sure, he trusted that.
Draco stared at him in a way that suggested he wasn’t entirely listening, tilting his head to the side questioningly. Harry looked right back, enjoying what would probably be a one-time occurrence, and something Draco would heavily regret. It wasn’t as though Harry
There was utter silence for a long second, then something shifted behind the shelves. He walked toward the sound, and as he passed the armchair one of the candles floated up from the stand and zoomed over to him. He was so startled he almost didn’t realize it was trying to lead him somewhere.
Harry felt a bit like someone caught in a hurricane as everyone voiced their doubt. Hermione crossed her arms wearily.
“Molly,” Ron’s mother finally said, her smile watery. “But you always call me Mrs. Weasley, no matter how many times I tell you not to.”
“What?” She looked over, then seemed to realize who she was talking to. “Oh. Yes. She was our head of Gryffindor house. Fought in the war, of course. She’s known you since you were a baby. And she’s bloody terrifying, I might add.”
“Pet,” Harry said, almost glad Draco didn’t have his wand. The way he looked at Castor made Harry sure he would have fired and asked questions later. “What did you see? Was there someone in the house?”
“No,” he said firmly. “She needs you. Clearly, whatever it is she can’t manage on her own… she doesn’t think I can manage, either. As frustrating as that is, I know she’s right. It’s always been you.”
Harry gripped his shoulder and pushed him back up. Teddy was worried about him. It felt like he’d failed, somehow. “I was going to say I have Hermione and Ron to keep me in line.
It was a long tour. Harry didn’t actually need to do that much talking – Reena and Teddy traded stories with gusto. Classes, a poltergeist named Peeves that regularly disrupted them (?), and general mayhem that surrounded a castle-full of magical teenagers. The two of them shared a dislike of Zabini, but got on fairly well with other Slytherins. There was a note of pride in Teddy’s voice as he said that.
“Well,” George’s cheer only barely sounded forced. He was probably glad to get that off his chest. It was Harry’s problem, now. “All’s fair in love and war. Even ten years after the fact. You’re good to send this lot?”
“Harry,” Élise said decisively, leaning forward. Her dark eyes gleamed teasingly as he visibly braced himself. “You’re quiet tonight.”
Harry stepped into her circle and let her grasp one of his hands. When he raised his wand and copied her incantations, the wards shimmered into view. It was like opening a second set of eyes; swirling layers of blue and green auras over the walls and floors.
Harry blinked, only mildly shocked to hear something like that. Hermione always put it much more judiciously. Harry
Two more red heads had been bent in conversation at the far end of the table. One of them looked like an older, shorter version of Ron. Thick muscles bulged under the skin of his arms. Skin marked with very severe burn scars.
Ron had taken more time to finish getting dressed. He stood at the parlor window, glaring out at the street like Dolohov would be back any second. “I can’t believe he’s in London. Especially now.”
“Do I always let people manhandle me like this?” He asked, pulling his undershirt into place and making sure no vomit had gotten into his hair. “Or is it just your family?”
He woke up the next morning to an irregular, insistent tapping. It took a minute to orient himself. Not just spatially, either – he had to recollect a rather scattered sense of self, first. Right. Harry Potter. And he was in Harry Potter’s house.
"Which one would you say was more real?” It felt a bit dirty, pressing his advantage like this. He wouldn't feel the need if she hadn't been running away from him all week.
Harry pulled the door shut behind him. The entire room reeked of tension. “Seamus was scared. What’s going on?”
“Thanks,” he said drily, setting it back down. Hermione set the pen between her teeth and straightened up, thinking.
“It’s November tomorrow, which means when it’s full it will be the Dead Moon. Or one of mourning, depending on who you ask.”
The hallway opened up into a sitting room. Every piece of furniture was a light green color, so he figured he’d found the conservatory. And there was the mahogany door. Etched expertly to depict a very tall, bearded man holding a book in one hand and a quill in the other. He had emeralds for eyes, too.
“I’m trying to find a way to get rid of it without resorting to amputation.” He shut his eyes as he said it, his eyebrows drawing together sharply.
“Not necessarily,” Harry said, approaching to inspect the remaining insects. Draco huffed audibly when he sat on the floor and picked it up. “What are these?”
If she really did figure it out in the first week, why the hell had he kept going back to Mysteries? Had she used all that time to pry through his head? For
“No one’s asking you to,” he slurred, bracing his hand on the banister as they slowly ascended the steps.
This silence was loaded. Ron gripped his fork without actually using it. “We’ll have to start from the beginning,” he realized, sounding baffled. His freckles stood out as he went pale. “We have to tell him
George grinned. “Edible Soap,” he said in a mock-announcer’s baritone. “You’ll be sneezing bubbles for hours!”
“Well,” she sniffed, disdain coloring her tone. “She’s always saying that sort of thing to me. Though usually she’s read my palm first.”
He heard his wandless Stinging Hex hit its target as he tossed soiled fabric into the bin. Getting the fluffy green dress back on would take forever, and he would only have to take it back off later, so he just picked Victoire up and left it on the counter.
. History – muggle and wizarding – he seems fine with. Magic…he knows it. Everything we learned in school, everything he learned as an Auror. He couldn’t produce a Patronus, but I suppose that’s to be expected. There were only two spells he couldn’t name.”
“That must – “ Harry stopped himself, wanting to speak his next words very carefully. “It…seems like…this sort of thing isn’t very good for your relationship.”
Castor hissed writhing wildly. Harry, shocked, dumped him and felt at his cheek. Not a bite, thank Merlin. Castor had only head-butted him. His tail disappeared beneath the armchair as Harry pulled window open for Pig, who fluttered madly before settling on his shoulder and sticking a note against his cheek, like he’d seen what had happened and was trying to offer comfort.
Ron tripped coming back out, catching himself on the doorway with a muttered curse. “D’you mean it? That might actually be…easier. If you’re not there, I’ll take the brunt.”
Castor said something, his hiss muffled by the bedsheets. He had been cross when Harry showed up in the wee hours of Monday, complaining about cold and darkness smells.
The Satyrs seemed busy joking around. The Nymphs didn't make a sound, though, but they helped brighten up the room with their beautiful look. The Titans, Demigods, and Centaurs chattered loudly while drinking wine. But there were some special tables, which the most important people on Olympus occupied. Like Aphrodite accompanied by her son Eros. As well as several other gods who were also sons of Ares, they are Phobos and Deimos. There was also Dionysius who came alone. Draco saw him place a jar of wine by the pile of fresh fruit laid out on the plate.
Hector felt hurt by Draco's words and actions. The man let the prince and his maid walk again towards Athena's temple. The place where Troya had a tragic accident that almost took his life. Hector looked thoughtful, and he wasn't in a hurry to reply to Draco's words. Obviously, he wouldn't give up easily just because of one or two rejections.
"What do you mean, father?" The young man asked. Did the King of Sparta have the same thoughts as him?
Like Luna, she is a fairy. Her sweet face and fair skin showed how suitable she was to be a fairy. She is one of the royal fairies. Both her parents held the southern fairy kingdom. But Luna said, to be able to live among humans, they also have to mingle with humans. That's why Luna was going to college.
“I just wanted to find out how far you would pretend to act as if you're reading. After that, maybe you can realize how much sexual tension between us," muttered Harry calmly, not shifting an inch from his seat but looking so menacing.
"Oh..." She pursed her lips and nodded her head slightly. "Send my regards to Draco too," added Arabelle with a smile.
"No. Tantalus made an unforgivable mistake. I'll have my troops on standby in case he doesn't want to negotiate." The King said sternly.
"Yes, you have your own room. Why? Do you want to share a room with me right away?" Ares laughed. The prince's face turned red again.
But Harry's strong arms held him, and then, Draco hunched his back and whimpered at the sensation. The sensation of the touch of Harry's lips and tongue, licking and sucking his cock, with his hot breath lingering. Heat meets heat, and he's on fire. Draco's gaze darkened with a sensation of unbearable pleasure.
But Draco's memory back to the night of the accident, now engraved vividly in his memory that Harry really embraced him that night, hugged him tightly, and endured the crashes to protect him. Maybe if it weren't for Harry's hug, Draco's body would have been thrown, and then it wasn't just his head that was injured.
"What if that's true, sir Hector? Violating the will of a god could result in the land of Sparta being cursed. The king would have chosen his people over me," Draco responded. However, he himself did not believe that he would be married to a real god.
Draco stood in front of the large mirror watching his reflection look different. He was wearing a maroon suit and brown cravat that matched his skin perfectly. His hands are wearing thin gloves. And his hair, Draco held his blonde hair gently, took a look at his blonde hair which was let down and styled so beautifully. He didn't even notice that his hair had reached his hips.
Draco's cheeks flushed red as he read one sentence after another that was so splendidly and beautifully arranged in the book he had just gotten from his maid, Glenice. Draco felt his face heat up, and suddenly, his normally cold room was replaced with stifling heat.
Draco's words managed to shift the focus of the Delion's King from Harry and his mistress to Draco. Harry's legal partner looked so relaxed, there was no look of anger or disappointment on his beautiful face, and it made the King of Delion wonder.
“Mrs. Seraphina's body was too weak to grow a baby in her womb, and she could not conceive until the child was born. That fact broke Mrs. Seraphina's heart and made her physically weaker.” Alden sighed. "Mrs. Seraphina was getting sicker day by day until finally, she can't get up from her bed. One morning master Harry found her dead in her sleep."
Draco's lips parted, his eyes were closed, and his hands gripped the man's light blue shirt, which still clung to his strong body. "I... I'm yours, Daddy..." Draco answered breathlessly. More and more delicious whimpers and moans escaped his swollen lips. "Only yours..."
Ares was the God of War. Just mentioning his name made the majority of Greeks tremble with fear. That God was known to be bloodthirsty and like to start a war. Challenging anyone to fight and temperamental. Not only that, but he also had an affair with Aphrodite so many times that they gave birth to many children.
Draco bit his lower lip when he saw Harry's reaction. He was afraid that Harry would reject his proposal because it made Draco feel that he had failed to be a wise queen to all his people.
Draco's eyes then fixed on Luna, who was scribbling her book with a pencil. Draco sat beside Luna and put down his guitar. Luna looked at him with a smile, then glanced at the guitar.
Ron was conversing with his Gamma, Dean Thomas—accompanied by a soldier when Harry arrived on the scene. Harry cleared his throat, and the three of them were interrupted.
