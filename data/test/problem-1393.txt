, would he still be doing this? He wondered how it felt to him to watch his only son wince with the pain he was making him go through.
"Professor, I understand the point you're trying to make here, but violence is violence. Draco's physical offense was only a result of Ben's
without having the faintest clue what that was.
"No. There's nothing the two of us can talk about." He rushed to shut her out just as soon as he heard her, and it was the matter of fact he truly didn't have anything to talk about with her as he would much rather keep the memory of it out of his mind's reach. He looked away, hoping to recapture the breath he lost when she walked in, and he sighed, forcing a bit more of voice into it to aver his aggravation.
He stood up, and began restlessly pacing around the room, cracking his knuckles probably more than normal, and murmuring his thoughts under his breath. "It's just, something feels very wrong, like dangerously wrong with him. I mean, haven't you noticed?" He spoke out loud finally, as if justifying his concern to his own self.
Harry’s pants echoed louder through the room when they parted for air, his chin resting on the top of the mess of blond hair. Draco’s lips dived down, caressing the skin of Harry’s neck with wet kisses all over. He settled on Harry’s Adam apple, taking the skin in his teeth in a gentle bite that slowly grew hungrier, leaving behind a mark of deep red, which he eyed with pride.
He watched as the gelid water placidly blended with blood into a pinkish colored liquid and slowly hissed at the pain it caused. For a moment, he studied his set of twenty uneven cuts with something far from admiration, the sight of them sent him into a cold sweat. By that time, he was quivering like a stick in the wind. Coming to see and comprehend what he had done took him into a whirlpool of foreboding. For once, the sight of blood adorning his almost colorless skin didn't amuse him, instead it took his breath away, and he suddenly felt frozen.
"First, calm down. Sit." Hermione mentioned him back to the sofa, but he didn't seem to be listening to her at all. "Second, I don't see why it's so important to you. You're meant to be happy that he's finally off your back."
but he said nothing as his eyes scanned the whole place, running over every face. He was now dressed neatly in his school robe, his fine black suit was gone. He was breathless, perhaps from running through the school's vast hallways on his way to get here.
was really there, bare by Harry's side without his cover of ego, if only that tenderness wasn't born of ache.
"Or what? You're gonna tell your big daddy about it? I'd like to see you do that." By now Draco was starting to get loaded, rage taking over him slowly that it scared him what he might do if he lost it, but it also scared him that he might do nothing at all. "Oh wait, your daddy doesn't care!"
"Oh thank goodness you're well! How do you feel?" McGonagall rushed to him, standing now at the side of the bed, taking his hand and giving it multiple squeezes as if she was trying to check something. He could not believe it was the same woman who insulted him before her whole class yesterday. Was it yesterday? He couldn't tell for sure.
"Didn't know you had such talent." After an everlasting pause, Harry commented, obviously as hesitantly eager to break the silence as Draco. Draco only shook his head with a heavy chuckle.
That Harry had to remind himself of. But oh how it scared him, the thought of being shut out again, now that things grew to be about a dozen times worse.
"Is that the case, Mr. Schultz?" Dumbledore looked at the boy right in the eye after Harry's statement, making sure it was the truth. The boy went pale in the face just about immediately.
them. His fingers clutched tightly around the broken piece as though it was a ray of hope that he feared to lose in his hand. He ran it over his inner forearm, slowly he started before dashing it across. He could feel that cleft vein pulsing, and leisurely he felt as the adrenaline spread through him. At that point, the jabbing pain only lasted for a brief moment, and soon enough there was no more of it, which demanded yet another cut. And so, he traced the piece over his forearm again, and then repeating that same pattern over and over until he could see the blood immersing the spot like a puddle.
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy, what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you today to?" Dumbledore greeted cheerfully as he watched Draco and his father walking up to him. Deep inside, all three of them knew Dumbledore wasn't the happiest to see him, as seeing Lucuis meant trouble to him most of the time.
"I'm sorry I kept this from you all this time," She breathed out every last bit of air she had in her, and her forest colored eyes finally opened, showing somewhat of a soft look in them, not of sympathy but of nervousness.
As he welcomed more of Harry’s cock into his mouth, he could feel the hands of the smaller boy brushing through his hair, gripping on it while his back shaped a little arch. As a reaction, he immediately pulled it out, shooting Harry with a glare. Harry’s whimper drifted in the air like nothing while Draco quickly reached for his wand which he left on the nightstand. He mumbled something, a spell, which had Harry’s hands tied up above his head with a black ribbon of smooth silk the following second. Harry groaned helplessly, yet didn’t try to free himself.
”I want this to be forever, just us two, forever...” Harry said with voice loud enough for only himself to hear, yet Draco caught every word. He kept drawing idle shapes with his index on Draco’s chest while speaking.
His lips found Harry’s in a kiss through which he tried to plant some more eagerness within the tired boy. Occasionally Harry would stop kissing back for a breath, but that energy in which Draco’s lips moved would force him back in motion. Draco loved that kiss in a way beyond sexual desire, in a way that was deeper, and he didn’t like that thought very much. He saw the way Harry’s teeth dug in his lip when they parted, and it sent him to a state of certain weakness.
"I've never really known her, but her love saved me. And I'm pretty sure, no matter what's going around, her love is still somewhere for you to feel." Harry tried to sound as serene and as unfazed as he could possibly be, for he knew that was needed. A bit more of discomfort or uncertainty would only trouble the tide more.
"Dumbledore, I'd like you to do me a little favor. You see, Draco here, he's been reckless, but he's all set and back to his senses now." Lucuis patted Draco on the shoulder, not in the encouraging father manner you'd expect. It was more of a warning, or a signal to Draco to behave as he's meant to, do exactly as his father thinks he should. Dumbledore on the other hand, he seemed to be listening very carefully, studying Draco for any silent words, occasionally nodding at his father's statement.
But that wasn't the only thing Harry noticed to be different about him. In the time of those four days, Harry found himself rather invested -
"Hey, easy there." Harry said, seeming very calm, as he saw Draco's wand in the air, pointing at him in a threatening manner. "I come in peace."
"Hermione
Big empty space it was, the manor. A word that's said echoes and returns as multiple weaker versions of itself, yet it never leaves. And there he sat, Draco, with the company of nothing but still air, staring at the nothingness deep within the house. He might have been bouncing his knee, but he didn't feel it; his mind was too busy trying to find a way out, a way through which he didn't have to hear them.
"Here." She ever so slowly, almost hesitantly, pulled an already opened and folded again letter and placed it on the desk before him without having the nerve to look up at him. She was shrinking smaller and smaller with each passing minute. He eyed the piece of paper put before him, he feared to see it in a way, hoping that there would be nothing to prove her right, there would be nothing to give truth to her words, but the sight of it shattered those simple hopes of his.
"W-well, he- he pointed his wand right into my neck! He threatened me! And I highly doubt it was but a threat!" He jumped as soon as he realized things weren't going exactly how he wanted.
He helped himself up, and then held his hand out to Draco who, surprisingly, took it, and with a bit of a struggle he was up on his feet again. He fixed his robes on his body just about as soon as he stood straight, and then let his hand reach to his face to wipe away the faded traces his tears left behind.
Draco woke up the next morning, late as his new habit ordered, to find out that half the school knew at least a little something about what happened to him. Divided into groups they seemed, those who believed, those who didn't, and those who just enjoyed the gossip of it. No matter how hard he tried to think of what gave it all away, his mind wasn't able to help give him a valid answer.
”Can I make you feel good too, make up for my disobedience?” Harry toyed with the waistband of Draco’s boxers as he spoke, his voice nearing a whisper with a tone so soft and misleading with a disguise of innocence that hid nothing good behind, like a poisonous flower that was indeed gorgeous on the outside but was sure to lead those who it entranced to their demise.
With his silent questions left unanswered, and they slowly drowned in the heavy silence of the air, Ron plodded by Draco after giving Harry one last glance, it was almost as if he was too scared to leave his friend alone with the blond.
Harry let out a moan that showed shameless despair as Draco’s kisses reached closer to his crotch area, grinding up and down in attempts to get any kind of friction, but Draco simply ignored Harry’s burning needs and passed by them like nothing, proceeding what he had in mind.
"You and the whole bloody school." Draco rolled his eyes, and almost as if he knew what Harry could spot within his eyes, he began to avoid any kind of contact the green eyed boy attempted to start. Despite his voice trying to mask it, Draco failed to hide the tiny crack through his voice as it flooded back to his mind, the memory of that other morning when he walked through the hallways and whispers of random strangers drifted into his ears, the way their eyes wandered around him, and then again his face tightened at the thought of how everyone knew. He couldn't tell for certain if he was enraged or merely hurt.
What happened next was blocked from his mind, he couldn't feel it nor could he control it, almost as if he was being controlled by something beyond his knowledge. He was only awoken by a sensation of pain like fire eating the skin of his knuckles. The mirror was now in pieces, he could no longer see the halo for he could no longer see himself looking back at him, which felt strangely satisfying, like a goal he achieved. His fingers were tainted by the deep scarlet blood, with the areas that were lightly smeared and the reddening knuckles, his hand looked like a work of art. It was quite deiform to look at, yet still it terrified him.
"Behave yourself, Draco." It did feel like ages but it was only a few moments before a settle voice broke their silent battle, settle but quite alarming. As all four of them turned to the source, the figure of Lucius Malfoy stood straight and high by the entrance, seeing him there seemed to rush cold air into the room. His hallow eyes focused on nothing but Draco, who didn't look to be quite happy with the sight of his father, if anything, his body stiffened and shrunk into the shape of a lifeless needle when he saw him.
"Get off me, Potter!" Once Draco stood up straight on his feet again he pushed Harry off rather violently, causing him to fall. Looking back at his body trying to lift himself up from the floor, Draco felt bad almost at once, and for a reason he didn't know, he actually did want to help him up again, but he couldn't.
”Aren’t doing as you’re told, are you?” Said Draco with a stern voice while he took Harry’s jaw in a firm clench.
His chances slipped from between his fingers. The messy haired boy looked up at him, and in that very moment he looked to completely abandon that conversation of his, distracted from it as his mind traveled to Draco. And his face went bright, as though a tide of positive emotions washed over his face. He couldn't ignore the memory of the night before, the sense of hands rubbing up and down his back as a gentle gesture. It was almost as if he was scared to be given the comfort of last night again.
"He had had some issues, which led him to stupidly believing that this rebellious behavior would get him somewhere." His father proceeded once the boy was out of sight, like nothing had ever happened. His father's statement filled him with the same sensation of rage he felt in that moment when his mother walked away from him.
"It keeps me up all night, and I know apologizing doesn't help either of us but still, I'm so truly sorry, Draco. If it helps, I only did it out of worry in the first place." Following her honeyed statement, they fell into deep, awfully distressing silence. He could feel her eyes burning through him in search for something to ease her mind, and she knew it was only a wild goose chase. His eyes remained fixed on the floor outside his desk, with a frown forming heavy on his face. He could hardly feel the way his teeth dug through his bottom lip, chewing on it rather violently, until a metallic taste spread in his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Falling harshly right back into that thought, Draco couldn't give a response other than silence, which to Harry signaled a yes. He was heavy again, and it showed through everything in him. His eyes darted towards the floor, and every breath he took seemed to burn its way in.
"No, it never went this far. He just lost it the other day, this happens sometimes." He straightened himself in his position. "If you kindly don't mind, I'd appreciate it if we didn't talk about this matter again."
"Mate, I did, many times actually, but you were lifeless." Draco was listening to their conversation closely enough to hear the chuckle coating Ron's voice as he spoke.
“So,” he slowly ran his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip, which had grown more tender from that kiss. He slid two of his fingers into Harry’s mouth, who welcomed them in and began sucking on them, his mind drifting elsewhere. “Be a good boy and do as you’re told?” It sounded more like a command, and Harry, so heavy with desire, could only offer a nod.
”Dra-Draco,” Harry moaned through a rush of panting, pleasure piling up on his chest and taking his breath away. “I- I’m so close..”
"Don't flatter yourself Malfoy, I'm not here for you. I need to talk to professor Dumbledore." The other boy spoke with a sigh, his words didn't fail to sound so cold. He was clearly bored, and had other things that were more important than Draco's old I-don't-want-you-around game. To admit it, Draco was a little disappointed with Harry's reply, his ego was wounded on behalf of his child self, who had his friendship offer turned down.
"Er, nothing, I'm just trying to get a bit of their conversation." He answered, probably quicker than he was supposed to. He came to notice how far they walk from them, yet he couldn't help but look back. To his disappointment, or relief, Draco was looking down at his feet, no longer interested.
? Of all people? I'd much rather let him drown in whatever he's going through." Ron replied, more in the fiirm of an attack, jumping up from his position on the floor.
Harry approached him in a snail's pace, without saying a single word, which felt intentional, as though he was a little animal Harry didn't want to scare away. But despite the quietness of the encounter, Draco, out of his control, felt the need to fight, to defend himself. So with a pair of shaking hands, he tried to reach for his robe, which concealed his wand underneath, all while trying not to let his eyes slip away from Harry, for he thought that if in a moment, for any reason, he looked away, he'd find Harry with his pointed at him.
He pushed the door open at last, a little crack, through which he could see Draco's figure sitting on the floor, leaning against one of the toilet stall doors, undressed from his vest and robe, letting them lay unnoticed on the floor beside him. Harry still couldn't make his presence known. Never had he ever seen Draco cry with such anguish, never had he ever seen Draco cry at all in fact, never had he ever heard a sound carrying that much pain within, certainly not from Draco. Hearing the sound of his sobs alone planted a kind of pain deep within his bones, as if the pain which filled the crying could permeate through the solid of the body. His elbows pressed against his knees while the palms of his hands buried his face within them, letting his fingers grip on the front of his hair. Harry felt weak at the sight of him.
”Don’t come until I say so.”
"Well alright, Mr. Malfoy, there's nothing to worry about. I will make sure to find something to satisfy everyone of us. Now, Draco, follow me, you will be late to class." Never did Draco think he would ever be thankful for Dumbledore's existence. He could feel the old wrinkled hand rest on his shoulder, walking him away from his father who stood still behind them, watching them go.
"Good morning!" Harry's cheerful and sudden greeting snapped him out of his thoughts. He looked up, trying to wear his best smile in order to match Harry's widening grin. "How did you sleep last night?"
"Anyways, I have quidditch practice now, I was thinking you might wanna come with. What do you think?" Harry sensed the undesired change in Draco, seeing his face beginning to tighten slowly and his fingers restlessly moving.
The next thing Draco knew was that his fingers were curled in a fist with a glimpse of pain spreading through his knuckles as he punched him. He thought he'd feel at ease at last, after physically pouring out his anger, but he didn't, it felt like nothing, he couldn't feel anything changing in him. And so, watching as the boy checked the area of the punch in shock, he punched him again, and again, knocking him off his feet and sitting on top of him, ready to do it again. He still couldn't tell if he felt any different.
As his vision began clearing up, and he could finally see figures of people and beings, he could see the gray covered figure of Dumbledore, standing at the end of his bed, which he soon realized was the hospital bed, and next to him stood the dark clothed figures of both Snape and McGonagall, all of whom were looking at him with silent concern, while he himself hadn't the faintest clue how he ended up in that bed.
In another moment of staring at his wilted self in the mirror, it felt as if his misery was leaking out of him like black fog, hovering over his head, almost as though it filled him on the inside that it started pouring out of him. That darkness in his face threw him in a state of agowilt as it appeared ever so vividly, it wasn't only the sight of his face looking like a withered plant left in the dark, it was also the thought of everyone being able to see it just as evidently as he could.
The sound of their growing laughter was echoing in his head, his body started stiffening, becoming too painfully stiff in fact. He could hear the beating of his heart loud and clear again, but unlike last time, it was all messy and furious. By that point he couldn't really feel anyone around him, not even the rest of the group, just him and that tall figure of a boy. To admit it, his last sentence made him think of the constant look of his father's face ever since his mother left, the constant look of shame and disapproval he gave Draco whenever he could see him. He remembered every single word, the harsh tone of voice, and how selfish it was of him to never let him even write to his mother in fear for his fragile reputation. His father
“What the hell are you doing?” Draco yelled in a whispered once he got to Harry, regaining his ability to think as the effect of the shock faded. He pulled Harry’s hand out of his pants and dragged him away through the crowd, earning a few dissatisfied groans from Harry and a few huffs of disappointment from everyone. He felt embarrassed as if it was him against that wall.
He rolled up his left sleeve, tracing the older scars in admiration for a moment. At times he did hate to see the messy lines scattered around his inner forearm, it made him feel so much shame that he would wish to get out of the body he ruined. Yet at other times, he cherished them ever so dearly, he liked the comfort he felt just by knowing they were there in the times his world gets tight. There wasn't that many of them just yet, some areas were still left empty to welcome more, which was something he was beyond thankful for.
"Why am I meant to believe any of that?" He was shooting her with a continually sharpening glare with the corner of his eye. He could hardly feel the way his eyebrow was arched too high up as he very carefully listened with a plain face without a change. He wasn't anything close to ill tempered, all that she said didn't really make him feel the things it was meant to, as he had yet to belive a word she said. He had no reason to consider anything she said true, even though it was entirely thinkable.
, and he was all willing to forget everything Draco had ever done to him in order to help make him feel better. He jumped up on his feet, fueled by the anger and disappointment he had just been given, and made his way out without the thought of looking back at all.
"You should head back." Breaking the silence, Draco's voice was heavy, yet steady. It felt as though he was finally getting himself back in little pieces, regaining his sense of the world. His voice didn't have that hint of grunge he used to have whenever he talked to Harry, but if anything, Harry assumed it was only because of his exhaustion.
”Fuck...” Draco barely made a sound through the rush of heavy breaths. It was as if he had fire running through his veins, strangely fueling him while every muscle in his body tensed up, becoming incredibly stiff with his stomach turning into a knot. He could feel an aggressive shake going from his feet and up that he could hardly keep his back straight, he couldn’t help his fingers clenching tighter on Harry’s hair in a way that hurt his knuckles. Without warning, Draco’s cum flooded Harry’s mouth. Trying not to cough it out, Harry swallowed, surprised with himself as he had never swallowed anyone’s cum before.
"Slept like dead." Harry let out an airy chuckle, his beam wide enough to touch his ears. It was something about Harry's pleasantly messy appearance, from the nest of hair on top of his head, and his uncontrollably elated gaze, to his loosely buttoned shirt and sloppily put together school uniform that shot Draco with an easing sensation of warmth, taking his mind off to a state of peace, he failed to do so on his own. Selfishly, he could watch Harry babel about whatever all day just so that he can have his mind far in that state of peace.
Walking into Dumbledore's tiny stuffed office, and being the first to walk after the headmaster, Harry had the strongest feeling that Draco, who walked just behind him, would push him off the narrow stairs. He couldn't tell why he had that thought in his head, but he took extra care walking the few steps down, holding the railing tighter than he liked. He felt as though he was the only one scared, the only one who feared the trouble they threw themselves in, and the speech Dumbledore was about to give them. The other two boys seemed to be much more focused on their thriving hatred to each other to care about anything else.
"So, Goyle came up with a plan in which we charm you in your sleep to get you to talk, for we knew you weren't to say a single word if we asked you. I only agreed to go along with the plan because I was alarmed beyond what I can tell you, I wanted to make sure I can help in any possible way. And so, we found our way into the hospital wing that night, and did what we did. I didn't foresee it being anything like it was, so I unreasonably felt angry, and as I think about it now, I don't see why I felt the way I felt. It wasn't only me who felt that way, but it was only me who decided you no longer deserved peace for it, Crabbe and Goyle simply decided to cut ties with you."
"Leave me alone for fuck's sake." He replied with his voice low and heavy. He had no power or desire to fight, or to make a scene and let the ones who didn't know know. He looked away, hoping to find them gone when he looks back, but unsurprisingly they still stood there, laughing again.
"Listen, Draco, I- I'm so deeply sorry." She proceeded, throwing what she'd just been told to the back of her mind. The lump in her throat made her sound as though she was choking on her own words, but even that was enough to get her a piercing glare from the corner of Draco's eye.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy, as you have been home for some time, I suppose you had enough time to study. So what's the counter spell for changed color?" She asked again, and her question was met with a loaded sigh from Draco, who declared that he had had it. She, on the other hand, stood still, firmly gripping on her wand as she waited for his answer.
"Draco, I am to blame for my actions, and I am fully aware that what I did to you was absolutely treacherous, and to this day I can't really give myself a justification for it and I can't forgive myself for it. But please, I know it's hard, I know it takes some effort, please do consider burying it all away." The way his eyes perforated through her made it a lot harder for her words to sound settled.
Draco’s chest went rapidly up and down in search for air, as if the air of the world couldn’t possibly fulfill his need. With breaths loud like wind, he looked down at Harry who was still kneeling in his spot, trying to meet his gaze. Harry’s eyes pierced through Draco’s as he used the back of his hand to wipe away the remainder of the cum off of his bottom lip.
"What about the one you're working on right now?" He pointed to the canvas on the stand, left abandoned.
"Father, please." He begged one last time under his breath before everything turned black, turned into nothingness.
"I don't need your help Potter!" Draco snapped, pushing Harry away from him rather harshly. Now that he knew he had nothing to worry about, he was getting irritated by Harry's presence, and his all heroic nature. He hated it, no he
what happened, and it wasn't the easiest thing to forget about, and he could imagine how devastated the boy was.
They talked, and talked until the air around them felt light, every shred of mistrust from the past five years had melted into their occasional giggles. They discussed music, Draco now had an idea that Harry preferred
to him, he could recognize her by her sharp cut short black hair and slytherin uniform,
"He took her away from me!" That very sentence drifted out of his lips many times, but every time it got lower, heavier for him to let out, and slowly it blended with the air, letting the sound of his aching cries take over once more. He was crying like a person with an open wound, as if out of physical pain, that resulted from being dry, Harry reasoned, of physical exhaustion as his lungs were drained flat, and his muscles reached a point where they felt like old rubber.
an explanation, but yet he didn't get any.
"Am- am I supposed to just trust you again now? Because you said you're sorry?" A surge of bitterness overloaded his voice, weighing down every word he said. But to admit it, he could not waste a bit of effort on hiding it, if anything, it gave him quite the satisfying feeling as it for once made him sound strong.
"She never loved you!" The next thing he felt was a constant burning sensation of pain on his upper arm as his father kept striking him with his fine wooden cane. He tried to secure himself with his bare hand, but the wood of the cane hit right on his fingers and it only hurt more. For a moment he wondered, if everything was different,
"Silence, Draco!" He said so sternly his voice actually felt like a bar of iron. His fingers clutched around the silver snake on the top of his cane as he looked him right in the eye, a sort of a threat he usually used, and it was enough to shut Draco up completely. Though he couldn't help his breaths that became heard. He felt hot like it was mid July, and he couldn't breathe, his body was enduring the pain that came with suppressed anger. He felt like collapsing.
of all people. Just in case you hadn't a clue, I don't owe you anything, and just because you talked to me once or twice does not mean that you can do it times again." He let his grim words sink into the silence that crept between them, and he took a few steps away, going back to simply turning away from Harry, hoping that ignoring him for long enough would get him to go away with him uncovering as little as possible of what he tried to hide within his eyes. He did sound cold in a way that hurt almost like a frostbite, but it wasn't nearly as spiteful as it used to be, it was a lot closer to being ever so painfully numb. This absolutely wasn't the Draco he met just yesterday's morning in the hallway, the boy whose face lit up at the sight of an apple.
nothing else seemed to catch his interest as much.
"Uh, yeah, why not." Draco was still rolling the idea around in his mind when he answered, the words escaping his lips without him having the slightest bit of control over them. It felt wrong for reasons unknown to him, a voice echoing in his head was insisting he rejects Harry's offer, as he was almost too sure the gryfinndors didn't want the sight of him anywhere near them. He knew that by going with Harry, he earned himself a troublesome encounter, but he somehow didn't mind it. He couldn't help but accept, knowing the quidditch was worth the whole world to Harry after their chat from last night. He knew it meant something to him, their newly found friendship, something that he cherished enough to ask Draco to join him in his favorite time of the week.
"Draco, I-" Pansy stood straight before him after she hesitantly made her way in. Her face tried to form a smile but all she could give was a little curve of her lip that mirrored her swelling discomfort. He gawked at her as she fidgeted with her fingers with his eyebrow arched up. But within a moment he looked away, the mere view of her around him felt like it was clutching on his guts, and it was like the walls around them were coming closer with every passing moment, until it felt like a diminutive box with every last bit of air drained out of it. "Can we talk, Draco, please?"
"What has gotten into you two!" An exclaim came from a short distance, distracting them from each other for a brief moment. As they turned to face where it came from, they spotted Harry Potter rushing up to them, in Draco's direction to be exact.
As they drew closer, and he could see them clearly, two of them were awfully tall boys, blocking the views of a girl behind them, which to his surprise was familiar,
As sleep slowly vanished from his mind, Draco began to wonder if it was all a dream. He was almost too sure that he fell asleep by accident when he was trying to gather up the will and energy to go to the room of requirement to finish his painting, and as it was his last thought before sleep took him, it came into his dream. It was lovely, comforting to have someone to talk to, but it didn't surprise him to wake up from it, nor did it upset him. And it was terrifying, quite frankly, if Harry actually knew what he knew in the dream. But apart from all, it felt pathetic in a way to Draco as he gave it a thought, of all people, it was none other than Potter in his dream.
"You have a few days to decide who you want to stay with. Make the right choice and stick to it." Lucuis walked away, breathlessly talking as if it took just as much effort from him. There was no choice to be made, obviously, his father did put two options out for him but deep inside forced him on one.
The warm yellow light from the Great Hall and the hallways he walked through faded into darkness in his eyes as he rushed into the bathroom where only a cold silver ray of moonlight adorned. Scattered and high-pitched voices from the Great Hall sank into the quietness of the half dead hallways, and by the time he was swallowed by the dimness of the bathroom, those voices were merely a trace left in his mind. That rather quick transition was much needed, but he wished it made a difference, he wished he could feel the tranquility he was surrounded by, but that simple wish was put out of his reach by his own head, as it wasn't any less tranquil than the Hall.
"Watch your attitude, both of you!" Dumbledore yelled and both of them fell silent, still throwing death stares at each other. Harry stood a step behind them, feeling a bit too relieved that his existence was completely ignored, he liked that feeling of invisibility. The more time he spent there, the more useless he felt, but it was still better than having a big role to play in all of this. He wondered for a second if he could just sneak his way out, but he knew he'd be found.
couldn't move. He had no control over himself, and he didn't wish to have any either. He sobbed, hearing himself get louder. Sobbing out of the pain that invaded his body swallowing him. Crying over the fact that his father was the one to cause his suffering. Crying for he started to suspect his mother's love for him. Crying cause he felt weak, like a lonely stick that could be broken with a breeze. He felt hollow on the inside, empty, like he was a dark cold sort of a night.
"So we read it, maybe more than a single time as it didn't quite solve the mystery, if anything, it made it about a million times more bewildering, meaning it wasn't even close to enough for Goyle, it only made him burn to know more. It was from your mother, we later came to figure that out, and it said something about wanting to come back and hold you one last time, to keep safe for she knew you'd only be your father's favorite when he needs to put out his fury. Quite frankly, I grew truly concerned, being lost while knowing something extremely serious is going on, and I'd say I was the only one feeling so, the two only grew mischievously curious."
"Father, please!" He shrieked again, even louder this time, he couldn't feel his voice leaving his mouth. His eyes were burning, tinted with deep red, and he could taste the salt of his tear as they didn't seem to reach an end. His body felt nerveless, he could no longer feel his being, almost like his body was drifting away in the air slowly, yet it still hurt.
He leaned against the nearest wall his back could touch, and he let himself slide down the wall heavily until his body and the floor beneath him collided. Then he was nothing less than a mess of fast flowing tears, and his agonizing roar-like cries subdued the silence of the place around the two of them, no longer timid, but rather agitated, carrying along the fury that came with being so deeply hurt. He collapsed, his hands dug their way into his hair, and by looking at it, it felt as though he was going to rip his hair out. His forehead rested on his knees as he brought them closer to his chest. The look of defeat he showed was rather frightening, as it looked to be paving the road for something much more worse.
When he was close enough, Harry grabbed the boy's pale arm, and his action was followed by a muffled hissing-like voice escaping Draco's pressed lips. He scanned that spot, his eyebrows meeting each other in a frown. The beat of his heart was only growing louder in his ears as his muscles tensed up at the sight, he suddenly couldn't swallow a rather large lump sitting in his throat. He felt a strange sensation of fear, not of the view itself but for Draco, for it hurt beyond his imagination to see Draco's pain reaching the point where it reflected itself on his body at last. He saw the cuts before his eyes with various stages of recovery, some of them looked to be weeks old while others seemed raw as though they were only created a few hours ago. If there was one thing too clear about them, it would be that they're nowhere close to a burn of any sort.
Draco couldn't help but look in Harry's direction, he couldn't help but observe his every action, and deep inside him he knew he was scared despite hating to admit it. He was haunted by the thought of Harry having any bit of a clue about what had happened to him, it terrified every bit of him to imagine it, thus he couldn't help but keep a very close eye on him every time he was around since the moment he saw him in the hallway when he was with his father. His eyes held questions, and that terrified him. From his seat at the end of the class, he could see him looking at Hermione who sat next to him, murmuring something Draco wished he knew. He carefully watched the way his lips moved, trying to get close to knowing what he was talking about, but it was a failed attempt. As he couldn't take his eyes off the boy, he would occasionally catch him looking back at him while he talked. Knowing Harry was talking about him, he couldn't help his growing anxiety. He could feel every pair of eyes refusing to leave him alone ever since he walked him, and he could feel himself having a spot in everyone's mind, and for the first time in his whole life, he didn't like it.
As he looked around a little bit more, still trying to get a firm grasp of what was actually happening around, he spotted the person he least expected to see at that time and - though not surely - he least wanted to see. When he looked around a little closely, he could see Harry walking up to the group of people piling up at the end of his bed. He was making his way towards his bed, he thought, and at that very thought, he felt panic rising within him like lava in a volcano. He was too busy thinking about what he was meant to do, he seemed to forget how to breathe.
The night was too good to be true, Draco was sure he'd soon wake up sweating in his bed.
Draco took Harry’s stiffened tip in his mouth, sucking while his tongue fondled teasingly with the slit, cleaning the precum off the tip. Harry’s voice broke into a fragile moan, and Draco couldn’t help the smirk the drew itself on his face, relishing that heavenly sound. He ran his tongue over Harry’s length, his eyes darted towards Harry’s face to give himself the pleasure of merely watching Harry’s lips wide apart letting out wild moans, as watching him like that gave him a sense of pride he loved to feel, knowing that it all came from how good Draco was making him feel.
Draco stopped at last, without turning back to look at Harry who kept walking up to him. Harry knew well enough that he didn't dare turn to face him, he didn't expect him to anyway, for he knew that Draco Malfoy wasn't the one to be confident enough to show his tear-burnt face.
He could see, every time he passed past him, his clothes hanging baggy on his body, which by that time had become so thin and fragile like a dried petal of a flower, as though he would break in a blow of breeze. The bones of his face had an appearance more than they used to. And looking closer, Harry could see heavy dark bags forming under his restless eyes. And his lips were chipped, covered by bits of dead skin as Harry caught his chewing rather aggressively on them often. His hair still maintained its natural neatness, yet still it felt messy in a way, he no longer cared to wake up half an hour earlier than the rest of the students to get himself in the best shape possible. Now, he was most likely to sleep in and get caught sleeping during classes, and yet still he looked restless. And according to the story everyone claimed to hear from McGonagall, he was found one night lying on the floor crying in a dark hallway after hours. Harry was able to believe that story, as he saw Draco excuse himself out of classes with his face looking flaming red as if burnt rather often, and Harry allowed himself to assume he left to cry. He was aching to know what made Draco cry that often and that openly, yet he knew better than to ask.
made me cum.”
"What-" there was evident confusion with his voice, the dumbest kind it seemed to Draco.
He wished to fall back to sleep, for a really long time, as long as it would take for everything to melt into nothing but an evancent thought of what had once happened.
He was beginning to wish that he never pulled him out of the fight, he wished he left him there to get a few punches to get his head straight. Which after some thought felt really awful to wish, after all it was Draco Malfoy, it was only right he puts at least one bit if resistance before giving in, and that was how it was when everything was well and normal. But now that life wasn't at its best for him, it felt as though everything was going the way it should be.
As a few minutes flew by, Draco was thrusting harder and faster, enjoying the nice warmth and wetness in Harry’s mouth as he fucked it. In an accident, Harry had let out a little moan while sucking, but he came to find out that Draco had actually liked the sensation of sound against his dick, so on and on, Harry let those little whimpers drift out of his lips freely with his eyes glued on Draco, awaiting for a reaction. There was an undeniable hint of pride thriving in him whenever Draco signaled that the gryffindor was doing a good job.
As the class was over, Draco was done fidgeting with the edge of his sleeve.
The next moment, he just stopped, paused as though he was forced to, and he broke their once tight clasp. It seemed to Harry that he was coming back to himself, waking up from the numbness of his mind. He looked away instantly, his gaze unfixed on any particular being, as if he was ashamed, or scared to show what hid within his eyes. His eyes looked like glass stained with the salt of his tears.
Draco let out a moan that echoed like a roar through the room, with half of his length taken in Harry’s mouth. He took a handful of Harry’s raven hair, gripping with all his might and using it to tilt Harry’s head up. Locking their eyes together, Draco tried his best to wear his most intimidating look in the eye, but the surges of pleasure that washed over him didn’t allow it. He tried to maintain that eye contact when he began slowly thrusting into Harry’s mouth, but just about as soon as he started, his eyes fell shut and his head faced the ceiling. Harry gagged as Draco’s cock hit the back of his mouth, and he was almost too sure that his neck is soon to break; Draco’s grip was far too strong as he tilted his head all the way up and he didn’t seem to want to stop anytime soon. But there was a lot more to be enjoyed, this was what he’d been imagining nonstop since the prefect bathroom.
No, every day is terrifyingly the same, one hell in an unbreakable loop, and it only gets worse if it ever changes. Draco thought. Though, he did appreciate the optimism.
“Someone has been a good boy with little mistakes, eh?” He breathed the hot air Harry let out, whose panting was heavier than ever. He could feel Harry trying to catch his lips that were a small distance away from Harry’s, but Draco only smiled, enjoying keeping his lips out of Harry’s reach.
The next thing he felt, after the warmth of his mother's embrace, was the stiff wood of his father's cane separating the two of them, slightly pressing against his ribs.
." His father read the paper out loud, clearly his hand was shaking with the paper in it, gripping it too hard out of anger.
"What do you want from me, Potter?" He spoke with his teeth firmly shut, trying to make himself sound a lot sharper, hiding the areas where his voice lost its strength to his sobs.
Not wanting to think about it for much longer, he pulled his sleeve up, wasting no time in looking at the older ones as they weren't that much of a sight at that time, he didn't want to
"Now if you don't mind, professor Dumbledore, I'd like to have a word with my son, alone." Lucuis' voice broke the silence that took over for a moment following the sight of him, as he walked up closer to Draco. Although Draco was trying too hard to look down, at nothing but his shiny black shoes, he knew that everyone around him could still see the terror growing his eyes, the terror he tried to hide, the terror he was never meant to look at his own father with. He felt his body slightly flinching away with every time his father stepped closer, despite trying to hide it. He felt like a child left alone in the dark, not knowing what was lurking in the corners, except, he knew what was waiting for him, he knew the monster awaiting for him with greedy eyes in the corner.
"I SAID LEAVE ME ALONE!" He snapped, losing his self control, not that he cared enough to keep a firm grip on himself anyway. He hoped his voice sounded violently stern enough to hide the flimsiness that was starting to take over his voice, to hide the cracks that began creating themselves in his voice as it weakened. As it always happened to him, he started losing the strength he built up for himself, faced by the fear and sorrow that dream had planted in him.
"If you need to talk, or anything really, I'll always be there, you know." He set his hand down on Draco's now clothed shoulder, giving it a feeble pat, tinted with hesitation like the one gained by approaching an open wound.
Draco offered a tiny nod of his head, which Harry could hardly catch sight of, and wore a bleary smile, though it was but a small curve of his lip, it was the best he could bestow. Nothing of that made Harry feel any single bit better.
"How dare you lie to me!" His father attempted to yell, but he couldn't, knowing that this conversation had to be quiet for the sake of its privacy. So he spoke through his teeth, not sounding any less harsh. His fingers curled around his face, constricting Draco's jaw way too hard he could feel his father's fingers cutting his skin and digging in it, it was too painful he could hardly feel it. It brought back the feeling from his dream to his head, it felt like a deja vou and he felt like crumbling. He did wish this was another dream, he did wish to wake up at the hospital wing too hot to feel his surroundings again. "What is it that you're trying to do? Why are you so determined to bury our name in the dirt?"
His father seemed to be pulling something out of the inside pocket of his cloak, and as he held it up for Draco to see, it appeared to be an envelope, still not looking back at his son. "Then care to explain this?"
"His absence was quite unusual, but we'd be pleased to welcome Mr. Malfoy into the school again." Dumbledore replied, and it wasn't like he could say anything regarding that other than what his father pleased, it was weird how his voice tone almost never changes. Not when his faking, not when he's being real, not when he's pleased, not when he's sad, if it ever did, Draco wasn't the one to notice it.
was thanking him. There was so much more to know, so many questions that had yet to be asked, but Harry knew better than to press it. They hadn't built a stable ground beneath them, and anything could break the slim air they stood on.
"I'm more than willing to be by your side from this moment forth. I guess you can say that I didn't unerringly understand how crushed you are, I focused on one side and completely forgot the rest, but here I am now, so please. "
"Leave!" It was a moment before his father's voice had a spike one more time, like a roar it sounded that it startled him. Then a moment after, he could hear his mother, sounding like wounded animal, but he couldn't quite figure out her words.
"Brilliant!" The joy that adorned Harry's face as he heard Draco's response was unmatched. A smile engraved itself on his face, the widest Draco had ever seen, with his eyebrows curved all the way up. Draco couldn't fight away the smile that began to grow on his face at the view of Harry's face. "See you in ten."
Four days had passed since Draco spoke to Harry, that day at the hospital, and since then, their conversations were mere passing eye contacts, as Draco didn't try to start any sort of interaction with neither Harry nor his friends. As though it was the thing they had no choice but do, they ended up with their eyes refusing to leave each other every time the could spot each other around, for a moment, two, or perhaps ages. As much as he tried to deny it, Harry felt a strange sensation creeping up his stomach every time his eyes met the pale blue pair of Draco's, and found them looking right back at his. A sensation of a little spark jumping in his stomach, eager it felt to turn into lively flames, which he most certainly never thought he'd feel, at least not when he found Draco looking at him.
"Why are you doing this, helping me and all? Haven't I hurt you and your friends quite enough?" He questioned despite everything in him telling him not to. The silence that took them sat uncomfortably heavy on Draco's chest to the point that he felt, if he had to, he'd scream at the top of his lungs if it was what it took to kill that silence. He found nothing better to say than to ask the question that paid his mind a visit the day Harry held him by the waist out of that fight, and it lingered whenever he was around. Something within him knew that in no way possible Harry merely wanted to help out of the goodness of his heart, he found it hard to believe that there wasn't more to it. Of course, it wasn't beyond imagination that The Golden Boy would help anyone in need only driven by the urge to, but Draco knew he wasn't someone worthy of Harry's kindness, he after all gave him and his friends quite the trouble all through their years in Hogwarts.
Harry’s legs spread wider automatically when Draco’s lips landed on Harry’s inner thigh, inching closer with the tip of his tongue over his skin. A tingle ran through Harry’s system at the feeling of Draco’s heavy breaths warm against his skin, giving his goosebumps a rise, his free hand running up and down his other thigh in a gentle massage. Draco licked the area one last time, pleased with the sight of yet another hickey adorning Harry’s skin, thinking that no one else got the chance to mark him there gave the blond a rush of heartbeats.
"Mr. Malfoy, would you please care to explain why do I see you here just now when class had started half an hour ago?" McGonagall spoke, seeming so invested in every word she said as though seeing Malfoy late had managed to offend her in a way.
About half an hour of him heavily eyeing the plate in front of him and aimlessly twisting the fork in his hand had passed. The only thing that caused him to lift his gaze up from his dull plate was Hermione muttering "
His hands clawed at a black envelope, the once neat envelope couldn't maintain its graceful fold against the strain of his shaking fingers, which had a lot more strength than his weary mind could possibly control. He could feel the tiny droplets of sweat in the palm of his hand blending with material of the paper in his hand, as it absorbed it welcomingly.
”I- I’m sorry,” Harry groaned, sounding as if he was on the verge of tears. “I couldn’t help it.”
know when everyone else did? Or was he just making sure. He flinched away at the sensation of his hand on his knee, he couldn't say he was used to such firm of physical contact.
you."
"I will write to you all the time, all the time, and I will love you for as long as I live." She pulled him into her arms, resting his head on her shoulder. Still refusing to answer. She could hear his quiet sobs getting louder, slowly carrying out his pain.
But before he could engrave another line, a tentative-sounding knock on the door disturbed the tranquility of the room. He recoiled, and in the fright of the moment he couldn't get his mind to function. The least of his wishes was to be caught by a
"Uh- have a good night, Potter. I, uh, thank you." Draco rocked back on his heels. The words felt new to him, stumbling out of him as if he had just learnt to say them. In fact, he
"I thought I was very clear, Draco, when I said there must be no contact with this woman." His father mountained on top of him, as if waiting for him to get up.
they preferred other than his family issues. He wasn't even sure how many of the people surrounding him actually knew, but it terrified him to think that most of them did, and most of them were talking about it as he walked by. He
"P-Potter!" He rubbed his hands together as he tried to wear his best smile, which only ended up as a weird looking overstretched grin. It would be a lie to say that he could feel how tense his face was a few moments ago. He hadn't the faintest clue what his actions were expected to be, or what his words should come out like, it was all too new to him to know how to react to it.
He didn't have high hopes, but it felt like heaven in the making when he could feel Harry's arms, though hesitantly, climb up his back, slowly letting his hands rub up and down his back as he sobbed in his neck. It had been quite some time since crying felt this comforting. There were so many thoughts and questions clashing to invade his mind, but he did well enough to block them away. Perhaps it was his exhaustion that built the wall in his mind, emptying it of even the mere thought of wanting to put on his strongest appearance.
Harry couldn’t balance the feeling of disappointment and confusion in him when Draco sat him aside and stood up, heading seemingly towards the door. The blond could feel Harry’s eyes burning through his back with questions as he walked yet he gave no answer. But the following minute, a surge of relief washed over Harry at the sound of the door being locked, it wasn’t over yet. Draco’s hand reappeared from the inside pocket of his jacket gripping on his wand and muttered a spell, which Harry’s heavy mind could only assume was a silencio spell. Then one by one, every piece of clothing that covered Draco’s body lay discarded in a pile on the floor by the door as he took them off, leaving nothing but a pair of pants on him. Harry’s excitement was surreal, to the point that he felt like Draco was doing everything extra slow, yet still, he let himself enjoy the ecstatic sight of Draco’s half naked body, and his hard cock shamelessly showing under his pants, leaving very little to Harry’s imagination.
Harry nodded feebly and Draco’s fingers curled around Harry’s cock, bumping up and down in an extremely slow motion, thinking he was being kind enough to give Harry more of that divine ecstasy that comes seconds before the orgasm. Harry writhed restlessly, again trying to thrust into Draco’s fist but this time Draco let him do as he pleased; he enjoyed those little moans far too much to do anything to stop them. At long last, a quiver had taken over Harry as a warm, whitish liquid found its ways through Draco’s fingers, but he didn’t stop bumping until Harry twitched in discomfort. He let go and heard a final groan coming from Harry, exhausted yet relieved. Draco took his fingers up to his mouth and licked them clean from that bitter substance, trying to relish the taste as much as he could, then charmed the rest of his palm clean.
Talking about all that spread glimpses of joy all around him, faint and hardly felt, but it was the best he had felt through these recent days. He could tell, Harry was barely following, he clearly didn't have such experience. Yet still, the look on his face, brightening as he watched Draco slowly drift into his talk, it showed interest, telling the blond that although Harry didn't exactly have a clue, he still relished the chat itself.
"I like what you said there Mr. Potter, fair point." Dumbledore's approval wasn't the only thing Harry got for his clever-sounding statement. He could feel the two boys' eyes burning through him like fine light through magnifying glass. When he looked over his shoulder, he could see Ben's lips moving in
“I- I can’t!” Only a minute later, Harry’s voice came out in an actual sob, terrified by another failure after he couldn’t do something as simple as keeping his hands away, and he thought Draco was only being forgiving when he only got him tied up, but if he fails again Draco would have no option but to punish him.
"I do. No matter how horrible you think you might be, you still don't deserve that. You need to remember that." He replied as he let go completely, letting the distance grow between the two of them and instantly feeling weird about that embrace, but not guilty.
Harry's upper arm was suddenly and quite firmly grabbed in a manner that startled him, as though Ron was trying to channel his attention to a certain thing, which left Harry is a state of confusion. And to get more attention out of him, Ron pulled on his arm, which felt like a bit of a shake. Looking at Ron, who seemed both concerned and shocked, he couldn't quite figure out what Ron was too desperate to get his attention to.
"Oh yeah, she's real nasty now. Can't blame her though, his father is one big piece of shit." A voice, far away, shouted back, following his sentence with a loud pitched laugh that sounded obviously forced.
hurt though, when you first called her mudblood." Harry added with the tiniest disturbance in his voice as he watchfully wrapped the bandage around Draco's arm. After a few rolls and Draco watching very closely as if trying to learn, Harry made sure it was wrapped around the cuts firmly enough, and with a few last touches, he let go of Draco's arm after it rested in his hand for quite some time, setting it on Draco's leg, free for him to observe.
"Oh look, Potter is here to save the day!" The boy sneered in a cheerful tone of voice, obviously annoyed by Harry's presence, which seemed to be something they all agreed on, even Draco.
He could hear the stone moving against itself, raucous sound broke the silence of the night and he so hard wished he could it stop it, in fear of anyone hearing it, despite knowing that it was half impossible to find someone awake roaming the castle this deep into the night. Elysian shapes were beginning to engrave themselves on the once plain wall, taking the form of an arch, until at last it formed a full door, after seemingly ages of praying ever so tightly for the noise to turn into silence again.
"I'm asking you for a single chance, after that you're free to do as you please if I play false." She did sound careful with her words, as if she was trying to surround him with comfort enough for him to trust her, she kept her voice low and staid with a softened tone, but it was all thrown to the ocean. As she carefully sat to his left in an assuring manner, it made hundreds of sirens in his head go off, he felt alarmed and suddenly his once dull body was burning to move, to pace around that tiny space of a room like a bird set free.
She gently tried to get his hand in hers, but as soon as he could feel her hand touching his, he jerked his hand away rather aggressively, feeling a striking pain swallow his whole arm as a result. His teeth dug in his bottom lip, and few tears rushed to the edges of his eyes. Knowing full well that she probably had the slightest glimpse of it, and that it would take a miracle for her to be oblivious, he felt the air leave his lungs all at once, and every inch of his skin tingled as if every nerve in his body worked at once.
The door gently opened, a bit too carefully that one could hardly see it opening at all, and slowly, a dark haired girl peered through the tiny crack of the door. The sight immediately sent Draco into a state repugnance and he didn't care enough to hide it.
"Yes, it's him all right. But what is he doing here?" Harry questioned without lifting his gaze off the black covered man. His question felt more directed to himself than to Ron who seemed to be focusing his whole attention on the man as well. But to admit it, he didn't exactly care about Lucius or his business in the school, it was the person he hoped to see with him that he cared about most. He hated the idea itself.
"I trusted you, of all people. I assume I'm to blame for it." He gravelly broke the silence when it was too heavy for both of them to bear. He decided that their conversation had reached an end, she said what needed to be said, and if he were to stay there for any longer she'd have nothing to say but to shower him with apologies, her feeble reasons and her crushing remorse, and he hadn't much desire to deal with any of which. So he stood up, feeling as her eyes followed his body like a pair of toddler eyes. He grabbed the letter that sat in between them for a while, and made his way towards the door, hoping that she wouldn't try to stop him.
"You don't know that." His gruff voice didn't fail to draw Harry's attention to him, which he didn't quite wish to have. Harry quickly lifted his gaze up to fix it on Draco, almost too foolishly confident that his eyes would be locked with Draco's in a questioning shared gaze. But all that turned to dust when he looked up, his eyes big in the dim light of the room and glimmering with pain as it was coming to his mind that he had no way to tell Draco other than what he already had in mind. But his eyes met nothing, he looked up to find Draco's eyes wandering around, unsettled and clearly burning with overwhelming tides of salty tears on the edges of their fall.
violence, which started it all." Harry found himself speaking, he felt big with the words he said, cutting Ben's celebrations short as Dumbledore seemed to be listening carefully to every word he spoke, with little nods of approval.
." He added, and in that very moment Ron wished he kept complaining rather than carry that news to him, and it felt as if every book related to potions had fallen on his back out of nowhere.
"But father-" His attempt to speak in self defense wasn't quite successful as his father cut him mid sentence, there was not a single thing he could do or even say.
"I'm not an idiot, Draco! I know what these are!" His voice came out with a pitch louder than his liking. He was starting to question why he asked in the first place, he knew what these were, and by heart he knew that Draco wasn't to tell the truth of his life depended on it. He marched towards the other boy with rather huge steps now, driven by a sudden burn in his gut.
He fiddled with the brush in his hand, gently biting the tip of it as he took a step back and eyed his unfinished draft in a bit of frustration. Then, as if he had been sent a message of some sort, he ran his pinky over something, wiping it away or spreading it over, Harry wouldn't know, but that little gesture seemed to give the blond some satisfaction at last. Harry swallowed, it wasn't something he got to see every day. The view gave off a sort of peace he had never imagined to feel with Draco.
Glancing over his arm, he saw the yellowing bandage wrapping up his arm, informing him that quite strangely, it wasn't a dream. It still didn't feel real to him, somewhere in his mind he refused to believe it. After years of rivalry, it was hard to imagine the two of them in a conversation that didn't involve insulting each other.
"If I hear you talking about this again, I swear I'll fucking kill you." He threatened, his voice close to a whisper through his teeth, he was growing breathless and his body felt like it was being cooked.
"Who knew anything about me anyway?" He faced away. The thought of how everyone viewed him as a completely different person from who he really was always gave him a certain sort of pain, one that made him struggle to look at the mirror without loathing the image looking back at him, especially as of recent. He himself was seeing himself as that popular loathsome image of him.
"Father, please!" He cried so loud he felt a sharp pain in his throat. His knees felt too week to keep him up, and in any moment he expected to feel his body hitting the floor as he collapsed.
He sat up on his bed, wondering how on earth it gave him the capacity to move one bit of him. His head was spinning, and it was like he had a stone for a head, it almost pulled him back right after he sat. After a battle against himself to regain his balance, he sat straight, and a atrocious feeling washed over him like ocean tides. His stomach was turning in anticipation and it felt strangely mixed, yet still even though he tried to think of how light it'll leave him feeling afterwards, guilt overflowed prior, as though there were dark figures of people hiding in the corner, their crowded whispers wiped him clean from every bit of thrill he had, and made him feel as though he was a blood thirsty freak of a sort.
"L-leave, Pansy." He so desperately wanted to speak, to sound anything near coherent, but there was not an adequate amount of air in him to carry his voice to be heard. He saw the way her lips parted in preparation to say something, but he just couldn't have much of it. "Just leave!"
His mother came out again shortly after, loaded with two suitcases. He began to understand how the world was revolving around him, yet still he couldn't figure out what led to this.
"Draco, hey!" His late greeting held a surge of refreshment, his words came out in a tone bright enough to gulf the two of them with a strange energy.
it was. He wasn't looking at him with the usual annoyance as he a "
"Of course. Absolutely." After the loss of peace, the familiar awkwardness was the only thing dominating the quietness again, Harry couldn't help but blame himself for it.
"How does feel? To live without your mother?" As he had completely cried his body dry, Draco could finally put his words in order. He looked up at Harry like a hopeful child, his eyes failed to glimmer yet they still showed a childish kind of hope, just a glimpse of it.
"I've been thinking, about something. I can't really shake it off my head. It's weird." He answered, his eyes narrowed in a squint while he looked at everything but her.
"Er, Ron, you go now, I'll be there in a few." Ron's eyes scanned Harry's face without a response, questions running in the fold of his face. Then he stared fixedly at Draco in anticipation of a cheap insult, but both of them surrounded each other with utter silence, as it was Draco who felt an insult approaching, since he excepted Weasley to already know what had happened to him just like the rest of the school.
Before he could reach for the door to open it, Harry took the largest breath he could, aiming to welcome in as much air as it would take to drown that sense of nervousness in him. It happened every time, whenever he planned on having any sort of conversation with Draco, he would sink in his own hesitation and uneasiness, as though he was one bit too scared to say something out of place, something that would make Draco only despise him more. This time, however, he wasn't hesitant, he didn't have thoughts of turning and heading back to his bed, he
y" escaped through his teeth. He was silently asking way too many questions with his eyes, or none at all, there was no way for Draco to tell for sure, but he knew one thing for certain, Harry wasn't really disturbed by him anymore, and it didn't feel like he would walk away at the sight of him again. Though, he desired for it to go back to how it was, he wished to be able to talk to him and look him in the eye without being so scared of him.
The despair that weighed down Harry’s voice attracted Draco, he stopped his sucking and traveled all the way up, his face hovering hardly an inch away from Harry’s, and he smirked mischievously.
"Why?" That one word was loaded with too much that it hardly made any sound as it came out, but it was fit enough to be a wake-up call to Draco, who took his arm back from Harry's loose grip once he heard it.
At last, Draco let go of the boy, finally giving Harry the chance to drag him away. He was now sitting on the ground, his body started loosening bit by bit as his eyes stuck at the sight of the half knocked out boy beside him. Harry could hear his panting growing louder, as if he had spent years without a single breath.
"I just got here." He replied without bothering to look in her direction. He was already starting to get annoyed by his presence at school, wishing he could go back to being locked alone in his room.
"W-what happened?" He had to make his voice sound concerned as he knew what happened.
"Not another word Draco!" His father jerked him by the arm, throwing like a puppet behind him, and using his large arm to block any of Draco's attempts to walk back to his mother. His mother still had that same smile and sparkling eyes, nothing changed, as if she was frozen in time.
"Thank you." His words soon melted into the silence, yet still it felt hard to believe that
Even though he tried to hide it, to stuff it deep under nonexistent strength, Draco's voice still held a tone of pain, the cracks of agony could still be heard through it, and his eyes still glimmered with tears even with his frown.
"What spell did you use on him, Mr. Malfoy?" He questioned, regaining the calmness of his voice. In the corner of his eye, Harry could see the taunt smile on the boy's face growing wider, taking the joy of feeling like he was winning. Harry couldn't help but feel irritated on Draco's behalf.
”Touch me, Draco,” Harry groaned heavily right in Draco’s ear. “I know you want to. I heard you the other day in the prefect bathroom, moaning my name as you jerked off.”
He lost his sense of safety as he watched her tardily make her way to his bed where he sat. The conversation was already bad enough when she was a few feet away, but he appreciated that security he had. He squirmed farther into the bed uncomfortably. By that moment his indignation had vanished and faintly turned into that increasing fear that slowly spread through him like venom, it shook his core to think that at one point she'd get close enough to see what he hid beneath his sleeve. His cut itched for his attention.
it when Harry took it upon himself to get everything going as it supposed to, which seemed to be something he couldn't stop doing.
, it was a feeling of warmth, not the heat Harry's figure emitted, but it was the embrace itself. In a drifting moment his mind was wiped clean, there was nothing that he thought of, nothing of that horror he was drowning in as he heard the gryffindor tell him all that he knew, as he watched the secrets he held so deep within his heart become known. For a moment there was nothing, and that was peace itself to him. Looking at his paint coated fingers, he didn't hug back, keeping his arms stretched behind Harry, who didn't seem to mind it one bit. It was only a moment before his precious peace faded, and diffidence crept to the back of his mind, ringing in his mind to push away as he hadn't the faintest idea how to deal with such affection, it wasn't like he was given this comfort often. Although this wasn't the first time he felt Harry's arms holding on to him as though he was falling off a cliff so high, and Draco was the edge he could only tighten his grip around, he still felt timid nonetheless.
"Oh and by the way, she said to take you with me, because you
Draco watched them walk away rather carefully, and he could hear them murmuring things to each other that he didn't bother to care about. He was waiting for them to completely disappear away from where they could see him and hear him so he could ask Goyle the question that had been messing with his mind since the moment Potter walked in, the question that caused his quite sudden and unpleasant panic.
"I'd much rather to talk about it alone." He informed, and with that they both walked away, vanishing out of sight.
The raven haired boy knelt down, his head barely an inch higher than Draco's knees. His eyes followed every little movement of Harry's, ever so closely watching him work with the kit next to him. His head was suddenly overwhelmed with a memory he never thought he'd ever cherish so dearly. A memory of when he was little, perhaps around the age of five, running in their vast space of a garden with Blaise, he ran back into the manor with his cheeks all wet with streaming tears as he found no better way to deal with the burning pain on his knee. In his mind were only flashes of that view, his mother kneeling down before him, wearing the most assuring smile he had ever seen, radiating a certain warmth he couldn't quite sense at that age, and with a flick of her wand it all faded, and he was good as new again. As a young child, he never paid much thought to his father's loud complaints in the background, yelling at both him and his mother. But thinking about it now, especially after all that his father had done to him, he was taken by a surge of bitterness overflowing within him.
Draco stepped out of the puddle of pants around his feet as he stood tall before Harry’s kneeling figure. Harry went on kissing Draco’s belly and downwards, while giving Draco’s cock a little massage. Draco was scared that he might cum from the simple touch of Harry’s, before he got the chance to feel his cock in Harry’s little mouth. When Draco’s moans became louder than mere audible breaths, Harry was aware of the blond’s needs, and so he slowly licked the flowing precum from the tip before taking in Draco’s dick in his mouth in waves, little by little.
Harry felt a weird sensation of stinging heat in his cheeks, and his desire to just walk away in complete silence topped everything else in his mind. He wished he thought a little more before opening his mouth. He blamed himself for it really, he knew it was about time Draco fucking Malfoy cuts him dead for simply trying to help, and Harry could feel that he was doing it for the mere purpose of hiding, but it didn't matter to him anymore if what he was hiding was planting daggers in him, not like it used to. He was lost in his desires to yell back or walk away, but he did neither as he stood there with his eyes fixed on Draco, who did the same, in total silence, drowning in the thickness of the air.
"I was rather fascinated by one of the paintings, the first one I laid eyes on. The one with the fountain and all." Draco couldn't help but wonder if the boy before him had always been this cheerful, if his voice had always held that ludic surge. His hands took no rest, moving around in the air as if trying to explain, pointing to one of the paintings.
Draco’s cheeks gave a shade of bright red, even brighter it appeared on his pale skin as the memory of that morning rushed back into his head, and he could almost feel how exceptionally satisfactory that orgasm felt. Yet still a hint of bitterness ran through him as he remembered how relieved he felt, safe knowing that Harry had no idea. Harry took Draco’s hand and placed it between his legs, desperate as he came to realize that Draco did nothing to grant him his simple wish of being touched. But Draco slid his hand away to the outside of Harry’s thigh, still a little hesitant. That however, didn’t stop Harry from grinding harder. Every time he rocked back and forth he looked to be more frustrated than pleased, aiming for more which couldn’t seem to come from Draco. His moans, his faint kisses left behind on random spots on Draco’s cheek and neck signalled that he needed more. Just as Draco feared, he was getting hard as well, and it was hard to fight away that lust when all he could think of was the boy on his lap, how delicate his skin would feel under his fingertips, how good he’d look riding his dick and being under his full control. But for some reason, he couldn’t shake off that sense of unease, there was something holding him back, but it wasn’t strong enough to urge him to get up and walk away.
It felt like raging fire was growing on his forearm, biting his skin and letting the pain that resulted spread through him. Only then did he seem to land back into reality. Looking down at his hand to see a thin layer of red topping his fingertips, blood finding a way into his fingernails, his body started to pick up heat like an atom bomb. To add more to his terror, he lifted his gaze to meet the pair of green eyes sparkling in the dim light, equally terrified at the sight. He could open his mouth and try to explain that he was hardly aware of what he did, but he knew it wouldn't give either of them much.
The sound of running water gently disturbed the the silence, being the first sound to be heard in ages. He gathered a handful of the icy liquid in the palms of his hands and blotched his face with it, feeling as the heat of his body slowly mixed with the coldness of the water, and for a moment that didn't last, it eased him in a way. He lifted his gaze to the mirror before him rather briskly, and that murk halo still rested there without a change. His own skin was tightening on him, he felt trapped within his body to the point in which he felt as if his soul was itching to leave.
"I do understand how hard it must be for you, right now, having to pretend to stand me. Merlin, you must be disgusted. I wouldn't blame you, it is exceptionally revolting to have me around, even as myself." He felt pathetic as his words crumbled out of him, revealing that he had reached the point where he breaks once again, a forceful urge to rupture in tears was approaching like a storm.
His eyes fell on Draco, to find him standing still as if he had been frozen in time. His ghostly eyes that he fixed steadily on Harry wasted no time in blinking. If Harry didn't know any better, he'd definitely begin to think that the other boy had been cursed. His face lost all color and went pale as dead, letting the redness in his cheeks illuminate his whole dimmed face. His eyes resembled the surface of ice on a winter day, that very same color, with that very same muted glimmer and for a moment Harry thought he could see the same rifts on the surface of thin ice. They looked to be wide enough to contain a whole edgeless universe within, and they were only widening. But then the moment that followed, he was thrown back to his body. His once apart pair of lips came together in a growing frown, and he promptly broke the shared eyegaze Harry tried to maintain, preferring to look down at where his feet stood. And Harry watched as Draco slowly circled himself with his own arms, as if trying to hold himself together for a few drifting seconds. He watched a bit too carefully perhaps, carefully enough to notice the way his hands slid down to his hips and rested there, his fingers drilling through the skin where his bruises lied.
"Does he do that often?" Harry questioned, throwing himself back into the distress of a bit more than an hour ago as his eyes scanned Draco's torso, running over the purple stains again. He got a perplexed look back from the blond, which he fixed with a quick gesture of his finger towards the bruises. "I'm sorry."
He let out a sigh, remembering Harry's wish to to see him at breakfast. In more ways than one, he hoped to find a good excuse not to go. He was starting to regret what he started, thinking that he had managed to throw himself in a groundless pit. It takes effort to build a safe ground for the two of them, the effort which he didn't have a bit of, and he knew for a fact that Harry will gladly put in as much effort as humanly possible, which was yet another reason for him to regret it, knowing that he would most likely leave Harry to do all the work he's too uninvested to do. On the other hand, he hoped to find any possible way not to see Harry for he was ashamed of what the boy got to know last night, embarrassed of the moments when he was nothing but pathetic without bothering to hide it. He was scared of what Harry thought of him, especially after the previous night, and to him avoiding Harry seemed to be the most ideal option.
"Well, you woke up - didn't wake up in fact, with unusually severe fever, and we were beyond concerned you might have gotten into coma, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore answered the question he forgot he asked right after asking. And yet again, his voice tone still managed to sound the same, but somehow it still showed concern.
"I don't know, professor. I haven't been studying." He replied once more. By that moment, his voice had gone weary, almost like he had no energy left in him to speak, or, probably, he had had enough wasting his energy on their vain conversation. Harry had noticed, with every word he said, he looked at everything but the woman talking to him, and it felt to him as though he was a trapped animal trying to escape.
"Harry, look, isn't that Lucius Malfoy?" He pointed at a figure among the crowd. As Harry looked straight at the figure, it wasn't hard to recognize who it was. He could ever so easily mark those pale blonde strands of hair, long enough to cover almost his entire back. And even though Lucuis was giving him his back, he could still recognize his costly black cloak swallowing him whole.
- in knowing what happened to cause Draco's drastic change, and he still couldn't take off him mind the question of what happened to him during the week he spent away from school. He hated how he couldn't think of anything else but him, like Draco was invading his mind with no desire to leave. He hated how worried he felt whenever he could see the glimpses of change on Draco, and remembering how he was in the past only made it worse. He couldn't help but observe the smallest details in search for an answer, but that only gave him more things to unwillingly worry about.
He quickly buried the red stained piece of glass under his pillow and charmed the blood off his arm, and with pain shooting through his whole arm, he struggled to pull his sleeve down again to cover his torn up arm. It was hellishly hot in the room around him, as though the flames of hell itself surrounded him, and by that moment he began to assimilate how lonesome he was, he finally came to see that the dungeons were already mostly empty and how there was almost nothing to be heard in his surroundings. He obhorred these moments of sudden realization.
"Now, enough about me. Let me get to
He turned back, and in the surge of a moment he threw his arms around the emerald-eyed boy, pulling him in to his chest with all the power he had that the other boy struggled to keep his balance. He wasn't thinking, and he didn't want to think, this could be his person in the world and he was inclined to hold onto him.
"Draco, if you want to talk about it, it- it's okay." He attempted to give any bit of help, and for a moment he lost all hope when Draco looked up at him, both his eyebrows arching and his lips slightly quivering. "It's fine if you, er, prefer not to talk about it. But if you do wish to speak, it's okay to tell me." He reassured as he felt the need to, after all they were enemies for years.
Harry offered the slightest nod as a response, watching as Draco slowly and with a hint of hesitation made his way away, disappearing into the dark hallway in the matter of a minute.
"Draco, please. I'm trying to help-" He sounded to be the desperate one in the room as he pleaded, but he didn't really mind it.
, Harry had explained. Internally, Draco cringed at the mere thought of muggle music, even though he hadn't listened to any of it. He did
Not focusing on the way before him and constantly looking around in anxiety, he felt himself crash shoulder to shoulder into someone, which snapped him back into real life after what felt like perpetual hours -
His vision started blurring gradually, everything looked misty, covered by a thin layer of white, pain was creeping into his eyes. He could hardly feel his feet, he felt as if he was floating, as though there was no ground beneath his feet. There was an ongoing peep in his ears, and he chuckled at the thought that this could be his heart echoing in his ears again, except it had stopped. His fingers felt full, heavy like he had stones at the tips of his fingers, the  broken piece of the mirror dropped to the floor as his fingers loosened, and shattered into two more pieces. He could feel his body pulling him back, like two large hands hauling him back with force that took away his balance, it felt as though he was standing on the edge of a groundless pit.
"How could you do that!" He spat when it all slowly crept to his mind, when it all felt real to him. He felt loaded with himself, his lungs full of thick air that he couldn't breathe, blood running like fire within him. Somewhere in his mind, he was starting to blame himself for sleeping, a part of it was on him in a way, and that thought stuck in his mind only fueled him more.
"No Draco," he was losing one bit more of his strength, both physical and emotional, with every passing second, he hated talking about it just as much as Draco did, but Draco seemed to enjoy extending their conversation. His feet took him closer to the blond with cumbersome steps, his legs felt like two crappy built columns in a hurricane. He pointed to Draco's arm, watching as his pair of gray eyes traveled all the way down to where his finger directed. "
"No idea, but hopefully no trouble with the ministry. We've had enough of those." Ron's words went almost unheard, as both of them were too distracted by Malfoy they forgot each other.
Silence gently fell over them again. This time, it was accompanied by a rather new hint of repose, something so smooth and so welcoming. Draco had almost never felt such thing, and it was safe to say that it was a rare feeling to Harry as well. Their minds completely drifted away, far into that state of peace that the events of this night had slipped their memories.
"Right." His father replied, sounding calm as he let go of him. He could finally breathe. He walked away, a few steps away, and turned back, looking at the blank stones again. He stood there doing nothing, saying nothing for a moment, a blissful moment it felt. Yet still, by that time Draco knew better than to build high hopes on a moment of silence, as it was only the quietness before the storm.
Draco opened his eyes to a blurry vision of sunlight coming from the window he assumed was above his bed. His mind still felt too numb to process anything. He couldn't clearly see anything, every sight felt like a fading beam of light. But still he could hear a few words in different voices, sounds felt too heavy for his sleeping mind to analyze, to know who said what. He felt extremely hot, as though his body caught invisible fire, or as though he was left to boil. His back felt drenched, drowning in his own sweat rather, as did almost every other part of his body. And with that unreasonable jump in his body temperature, his head was overwhelmed with the most intense headache he had ever felt, and it was almost like he could hear an endless beep stuck in his head and piercing through his ears. He groaned, proclaiming his half conscious presence with them.
He didn't feel threatened at all, in fact he never felt as safe around Draco. He almost knew it by heart that Draco wasn't meaning to do anything.
He looked at his mother, with something far from hatred or disgust, but rather with pain, and she could read through his eyes that he didn't care one bit for any of what his father said, if he believed any of it at all. She looked back at him, her eyes soft and glistening like dying stars. Tears were pooling through her eyes, making it hard for him to read her emotions through them, but if he could find one thing through her eyes, it would be the love she looked at him with, the love his father claimed nonexistent. He wished to scream at the top of his lungs.
and an occasional beg for more, Draco was expecting himself to cum from the mere sweetness of the sound. And he tried to thrust into Draco’s mouth; it was too good he couldn’t seem to get enough, Draco had to pin him down by the hips to stop him.
He knew there was something else to be done, an option a lot less strangling than the rest put on the table for him, yet he tried to roll it over in his brain until it fades out on its own. Deep inside he knew it'd linger, he knew his need for it would weaken him, and he knew he'd keep at least a part of it in his mind. Slowly giving up, he looked around, trying to catch a glimpse of anything else to think of, something else that would put that thought away, but there was nothing, if anything, his surroundings only made him starve for it a lot more than before. The excitement for it burnt him on the inside, with guilt for the most part, he didn't want to find pleasure in it, and he didn't want it to be his main go-to. He felt both exhilarated and frantic about the thought of it, like a child preparing to ask for a new present.
With a trail of quick kisses, Draco drew his way down to Harry’s chest, until he settled by his left nipple, taking it between his teeth. He sucked on the tender flesh while pinching the other nipple. He decided not to stay in that spot for too long, aiming for his bigger prize. So he licked the tip of it one last time before descending farther with more kisses that made Harry continually flinch under the effect of touch. Draco hadn’t given himself the chance enough to take his fullest of how perfect Harry looked just there, squirming under Draco’s fingers. The perfection of the sight was beyond anything he’d ever imagined in any of his daydreams, Harry’s skin felt like a cloud under his fingertips, touching it felt close to touching nothing. And he was so pleasantly tiny; Draco was almost too sure he can circle the boy’s entire waist with only his hands.
?" in an anxious tone of voice. His eyes met the back of the raven haired boy, sitting down beside Ron. "I overslept." He sounded breathless as he filled his plate with whatever his eyes fell on. "Why didn't you wake me up?"
"Accio first aid kit." At his words, a white box came floating towards the two of them, and within the next moment, it rested right by Harry's feet. Draco's stomach tingled the slightest, and he could only swallow,
Now, he was aware of everyone circling around him, and they probably had been like that for long enough to watch it all happen, but he was too blinded by his fury to see them or hear them whispering to each other in excitement. But now that he could feel them, and he could feel their eyes wandering around him even more strangely now, looking at him as the freak of the story, he felt yet another anxiety attack come to him, with the huge desire to not be seen, which had occurred to him a bit too often throughout the past two weeks he got used to it. So he ran away as fast as his half numb legs could carry him, hoping that no one could see his almost crying face as he flashed by them without a specific destination in mind.
He fell down, and suddenly his whole body was aching as if he had stones thrown at every part of him. He felt too hot, he was sure his would start evaporating at any given moment. His breath was taken away from him, as though this whole planet hadn't a single bit of air for him. At that point, he was lying down, bringing his knees up to his chin, and despite crying, he had no tears left in him, his crying was only a series of endless whines.
He sat on the bed by Harry’s side out of tiredness, rubbing his hands together and drawing in a massive breath. Harry was for once quiet, he looked to be deep in thoughts with his eyes focused on one spot in the room, refusing to leave it. Draco was grateful beyond what he could show that Harry had stopped moaning, afraid that another moan or two would get him unwillingly turned on.
Harry stood at the door hesitantly, trying to make up his mind if it was the right thing to do to walk into the bathroom where he knew he'd find Draco. So he stood there, moving his foot forward and then taking it right back. In a moment of nervousness, the idea of just simply walking away clicked in his mind, and it felt alluring. But still, he stood still, eyeing the door with worry as he didn't know what version of Draco he would get to meet behind it. He wished he knew what gave him such powerful willingness to help him, so that he could just wipe it off existence.
"Well in that case, five points from slytherin." She informed her class very calmly before she turned away from them, facing her desk again as a signal that her lesson will go on. It was surprising, how the class remained dead silent even when she gave them that unpleasant news.
"You don't really understand," he exhaled, his throat felt dry after all this talking, and this conversation seemed to be a dead end that he regretted starting it in the first place. "I just feel like we need to help him. I just have this feeling that he's not well, and like all of us he deserves to be help, you know what I mean?"
"D-Draco." His voice crumbled out, somewhere deep within him he knew where that was going, he knew that by speaking he earned himself another insult, but it was a different situation. He
"Look, I just think we should reach out and do something, to help you know." He wiped a few drops of sweat off his forehead, he wished to get a glass of water. It felt to him as though a subconscious part of him was talking, for he just didn't seem to realize the words he was saying.
"Oh yeah? How will you do that?" He replied, his voice equally low but with a hint of challenge through it which Draco couldn't stand.
They stayed like that for aeons it felt. Just like that, frozen with Harry's figure pressed tightly against the wall behind him, and Draco's figured pressed against him. He had his hand on his chest gripping on his red and gold tie a bit too firmly. Harry could see the red bruises on his knuckles. And it was unknown to Harry why he didn't even think of pushing him away. Their faces were close, maybe a bit too close that they could see their reflection in each other's eyes, and to Harry it felt as though Draco was trying to hold his breath.
His physical pain overpowered almost every other thing in his mind. He no longer felt the pain of his mother's words in the letter, he was no longer scared, he hardly ever felt anything of what was around him and there was only the soreness spreading through his bones. But somewhere in the corner of his mind, he knew there was a bit of truth to his father's words, it felt worse than all his father's beating that up to one point he wished that his father keeps going, hoping that if he felt enough physical pain it would swallow the mental pain.
"I'm so tired." A few words broke through the sobs, breathless they sounded. "I'm just so tired." He echoed as if to confirm it. His voice grew louder, clear through the sobs that sounded like a resurgent hurricane.
Against his anticipations of being let go, Harry was pulled even deeper within Draco's arms. He could feel Draco's hands grabbing a handful of his hoodie on his back, his fingers burying themselves in the clothes as his clutch only grew tighter. It felt so peculiarly exultant, the warmth of Draco's heated body radiating against his own, he smelt like faded cologne. He never thought he'd feel such pain, such affliction wrenching his guts at the mere sight of someone else's pain. He could feel warm tears against the bare skin of his neck, and the sound of sobs muffled in his neck somehow had the sensation of touch, he could feel the voice on his skin, and it sent shivers down his spine in ways no other thing did. He so desperately wanted to pull him in closer to his chest, even closer, but his limps felt too feeble, powerless, as though they were filled with nothing but water.
"Draco, we need to talk." She sounded as though she was in quite the rush. He let out the vast breath his lungs had just welcomed, and rolled his eyes, meaning for her to see his annoyance. What would go wrong if he just got up and left? "There's something absolutely important that you deserve to know, I can't keep it from you for much longer."
Silence stretched between them, consuming them whole. Harry kept his eyes unmoving on Draco, watching him collect his breaths with a struggle. He was letting himself fall in whatever his mind contained, Harry could tell, he was giving up to himself against his own willingness, letting a more venerable side of him show as he lost the battle he started with himself. His frown was no longer shaping his face, instead there was a broken look on his face, his lips quivering ever so slightly and his eyes, wide and mellow, looked to be damp already, gleaming as layers of tears pooled up in his eyes. It quickly caught Harry's eyes, how one of his hands made its way to the other arm, hoping to be unseen as it sat on where his cuts were. As if subconsciously, his fingers scratched on the cuts in a gradually growing speed, until he looked at the crimson inlaying the tips of his fingers Only then did he seem to wake up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s body fell on the bed behind him like a lifeless corpse, with one large smile he didn’t bother hiding. He adjusted his position a little so that his head rested on Harry’s pillow, which still held the scent of his cinnamon shampoo and faintly sweat. A moment later, Harry joined him, lying with his head on Draco’s shoulder.
so it's my birthday, I'm 18 now :)
"Thank you. But for now, we should really be in bed." It was strange, he didn't have a fitting reply, as he had never been told such thing. He chose to cling to the moments of this night when he felt happiest, when everything was shut away in the back of his head and there was nothing to conjure it back, hoping that the thought of the good things will invade the place where the bad took over, and so he could feel that lightness in his system all over again just by thinking of those good moments he collected. Harry's toothless smile at the end gave everything a desired turn.
"I told her I didn't want to do potions, but she doesn't care! I just hate the way Snape looks at me all the time!" Harry's complains seemed to be endless to Ron who, quite frankly, didn't bother to care as they made their way through and past heaps of students filling the school. Ron sighed, he didn't know what he had to offer Harry as a response, but lucky him, Harry didn't really seem to be waiting for a response.
"I full well deserved it." Even though Draco spoke in a tone loud enough for only himself to hear, Harry caught every word ever so clearly, it was hard for them to go unheard in such still silence. And at these few words, Harry had an unmatched urge, like thriving wildfire in him, born of both rage and ringing ache, to do a number of things. He wanted to run over to Draco and push him hard enough to knock him off his feet telling him to shut up. He wanted to go hug the boy tight enough for all his pain to ooze out of him. And he wanted to stand like a statue in that very spot until he drowns in his thoughts, until he can't feel his being anymore.
"No one ever does." The few words that Harry mouthed delicately caressed the skin of his neck, suddenly making him uneasy around the stomach that he felt inclined to push away, hoping that by doing so he might regain his breath that he lost.
The two days that followed, Draco was hardly ever seen outside the slytherin dungeons.
"Mother, what's happening?" He walked up to her in a bit of a slow pace. His mother finally turned to face him, but she didn't say a word. Looking at her, his insides were burning with the desire to cry, the desire he put so much effort into burying. He felt like exploding.
"Did I say anything?" He asked ever so hurriedly, as though he was being chased by something unknown to him, once he made sure they were nowhere to be seen.
"I know everything, a lot more than you think I do." The words burnt their way out of Harry's lips, heavy to the point that he felt like he needed breath breaks between words. In response, he only got a sarcastic sounding chuckle from Draco, who turned to face him once more, his face all so covered with a look of deep annoyance yet still Harry thought he could spot the slightest hint of pain somewhere in his eyes, as if a sensetive memory had been awoken.
"Harry!" Ron's voice broke through Harry's thoughts rather aggressively, causing him to fall a harsh fall back into reality, breaking the long maintained eye contact. "What are you looking at?"
. I just can't help but think of what might have happened to him. And I have this feeling, that it's way beyond that, and it's only getting worse." He couldn't feel how quickly he was talking, but certainly Hermione and Ron did feel it. His words didn't get the time enough for them to sound complete.
expect Harry to be into classical symphonies anyway. They talked about books, but exactly as Draco had anticipated, Harry was solely fully interested in
Before he could comprehend it, a stinging pain shot through the skin of his cheek, and his head was turned rather robustly to the side as he could feel his father's hand meet his cheek in a forceful smack. It hurt so much it brought tears to his eyes. He rested his hand on the place where he was hit hoping to lessen the pain but nothing.
It was quite the cold night that night, despite it being only early September. Draco lay awake in bed, of all the nights he had spent ever since his mother left, this had to be the hardest yet. For now, not only did he have to have to think of ways to accommodate with the loss of his mother, which had him crying himself to sleep for too many nights, but also now, he had another issue roaming his mind.
He finally rolled over, lying on his side, choosing the wall to fix his eyes on. His hands were buried under his pillow. He lost his sharp frown to a softened gaze, as though he was on the verge of tears. He closed his eyes as they got heavy, his eyes felt loaded, and he hated that feeling. He could feel a single tear tracing his cheek, cold when the air of the night hit it. Once he felt like he no longer had the enough strength it took to keep him from crying, he buried his head in the while pillow, letting everything that had ever happened ever since the moment he could feel his mother's finger across his cheek rush back to his mind.
Once he found a lonely corner, Lucuis let go of Draco, throwing him away to the wall like luggage. Draco struggled to stay standing after his father threw him, nearly falling before he hit the wall behind him. He couldn't exactly say he didn't see that coming. His father looked away, his eyes were facing the stone of the building but he could hardly see anything through his fury, meanwhile Draco kept his eyes fixed on his father in dread. He did expect his father to do so but he had no idea why, so as he looked at his father with panic-struck eyes, he silently begged to know.
He could swear he'd never felt as light as he did when he watched a slim smile drawing its way on Harry's face, followed by slight nod. The weight of the few moments spent in waiting was lifted off him, but it wasn't replaced with the relief he was expecting to feel. He felt awkward to a fault, he could say it found a way into his breaths and he could only think of a single thing:
For way too long, their eyes refused to leave each other, hardly blinking that Harry's eyes felt dry, meanwhile Draco's ghostly pale eyes felt as though they were digging right into his soul, in somewhat of a threat. But the moment that followed, Draco's eyes finally decided to break the staring battle to look at something else. His eyes descended, traveled down to look at Harry's perfectly round and tinted lips, and his gaze softened. Draco had no idea what crossed his mind in that very second, but he knew it made him burn on the inside, and he hated how
Soon enough, the thought of gratitude sank in Draco’s mind as Harry crawled closer, getting on Draco’s lap and straddling the blonde’s thigh. Draco’s chest tightened and he failed to capture a breath, he preferred to look away, hoping that avoiding the sight of Harry would help drown the the thought of how bad he wanted to bury his head in the boy’s neck and scatter hickeys all over his skin. The surge of Harry’s hot breaths against the skin of Draco’s jaw didn’t help at all, nor did the feeling of Harry’s hard cock on his thigh.
"But he didn't use magic on you!" Harry replied, equally loud. The boy's desperate need to be seen as a victim sat heavy on Harry's nerves, he never thought he'd be that annoyed by him, and what added more to his annoyance was Draco's utter silence as though he was alright being seen guilty of something he didn't do, leaving Harry to do all the talking for him. The boy only shook his head slightly in denial.
Draco locked his lips with Harry’s, finally giving in to the desire within the two of them. Harry wasted no time in surprise, and kissed back immediately, creating a messy pattern that lacked sync. If there was something flowing freely within that fueled kiss, it would be greed; they both seemed to be eager for more, trying to give the kiss more depth. Draco couldn’t help but try to bring Harry even closer in his lap, which was nearly impossible as they were too close, no space for thin air in between them, all while Harry’s hands frantically ruffled the back of Draco’s hair as he rocked back and forth even harder. The tip of Draco’s tongue traced Harry’s lips as they pleased, facing no competition.
Then in the matter of minutes, she started walking away, forced, dragging her feet out. He watched her in utter silence, but lord knows he was nothing but chaos inside of him. And then she was gone, the door shut behind her like she never existed in the first place.
"While you were staying in the hospital wing after your fever attack, a letter came, addressed to you but without mentioning whom it was sent from. Goyle suggested we open it, as much as I told him not to, he wouldn't listen to a word I said. He insisted, claiming that he was rather concerned after noticing your bizarre behavior, he said and I quote '
"Don't you ever learn?" Draco, after having had it of standing there in silence while Harry drew an image of the finest detail of his face in his mind, shoved Harry against a wall with so much force that it hurt, Harry was now aware of where this violent tendencies came from. "Why is it so hard for you to leave me alone for fuck's sake?!"
He felt trapped in his own skin, his body was gathering heat, making it hard for him to find a breath. His arm felt dull, as though asleep, he could hardly reach out to his tie to loosen it. He was sweating more than he liked, as if his body was squeezing itself dry.
"He was gone for a week, he's really
"It's something else," Harry swallowed, suddenly feeling ever so heavy as he tensed up once more, heavy enough that he felt his feet sinking in the floor beneath them. He looked away, his eyes running over the edges of the room, as though it was capable of giving him the words he lost to form his coming sentence. He wished that Draco, who looked at him with disturbed anticipation, could simply read the things he was willing to say through his eyes without him having to utter a word of it.
"How?" He so badly wished to be surprised, he wished for the news to have an impact on him but it didn't, as he already expected such thing, he wasn't that much of an idiot to not see it coming from the people who finely enjoyed the struggle of others, there was no valid reason for them not to turn against him at the end of the road. It wasn't surprise or shock that he felt, he felt rather enraged, not because they dared do him like that, but because the memory of his father at the hallway paid a visit to his mind again, remembering that his father mainly came to see him thinking that he was the one who let the word slip. It brought back the sting of his father's hand smacking him across the face again and he could almost see the hell in his eyes again.
"Excuse me, professor Lupin, I'd like to borrow Mr. Potter from you for a few moments." While in the midst of talking, professor Lupin was interrupted by the familiar old voice of Dumbledore, causing every head to turn facing the door, especially Harry whose name was called.
"What's the matter, Harry?" Dumbledore asked, as a response to Harry's wish to talk to him.
"It's alright, I guess." Draco fidgeted with his ring, in attempts to stop himself from touching the spot of the cuts. Now that he could no longer see Harry's face shining with that smile, he was feeling heavy, especially after the topic of the cuts was brought up, bringing back the certain things of last night that he was aiming to forget. If it weren't for the bandage pressing against his skin, he wouldn't feel the cuts, and that had a way of bothering him, he wanted to feel them, he wanted to have them hurting when he needed them to.
"Mother don't leave." He cried into her neck, repeating it over and over again, begging. He felt despair find a way into him, and every time he did, she repeated that sentence again. She pushed away slightly, resting her right hand on his cheek again, running her thumb across his cheek wiping away the trace left behind by hundreds of tears. She looked at him with a smile, without uttering a word. He wanted her to say something, anything, but her lips only moved in a smile. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at him, like they had a whole galaxy in them.
After ages of walking, he was out on the grounds. He didn't know why or how he ended up there of all places, but he just couldn't walk any further, his feet felt like melted rubber, wobbly and unable to hold him up straight for much longer. He tossed his bag under a tree a little further than everyone, and then sat down leaning against it. He hugged his knees, bringing them up to his chin which rested on them as he looked far at pretty much nothing. He did feel a desire to cry approaching, but luckily enough he was in a state of tiredness that didn't give a chance to do pretty much anything.
He walked through the hole in the wall and into the gryfinndor common room, followed by both Ron and Hermione who seemed to be chatting about something which Harry didn't care enough about to give a listening ear. He let out a loud sigh that felt as though it filled the whole room, drawing his friends' attention to him as he tossed himself on the sofa.
just learnt to say them, not the words themselves but to whom they were said. He felt childishly embarrassed, but embarrassment was a familiar companion tonight, he had his fair share of it. It was the ease that was new, the ease of thanking someone for help, knowing that
"I don't know. What happened?" He felt as though he hadn't said a single word for ages on end, his tongue lied heavy in his mouth, and words felt buried too deep in his brain that getting them out to be spoken felt like too much work. His muscles felt frozen, or boiled, but in any case, it took numerous whimpers of pain to get his hand up to his face in order to just rub the sleep off them.
His eyes gleamed like two emeralds in the sun, showing that same hint of innocence as he waited for answer to come from Draco, who spent far more than Harry’s liking in silence, he was at loss of words, as if his words had drowned in him or as if he’d never learned to speak. The way Harry’s eyes seemed to look right into his soul didn’t help at all.
Draco watched as Harry shoved a spoonful of food in his mouth, eating as quickly as he could since it was the last few minutes of breakfast. His eyes were unsettled, roaming back and forth around the hall, until they fell on Draco, who in return struggled to move his eyes away from the boy. Harry's face lit up with a smile of satisfaction, which he tried to hide as he got a questioning look from Hermione. Draco's cheeks gave an embarrassingly bright shade of pink.
Draco however, still lied there, motionless, as though he couldn't move, he
"Father, I really didn't do it, I swear! Don't you think I'm just as disgraced as you?" He tried to speak through his father's clutch, but his words could hardly be made out. "I hate it just as much as you do! I hate
"W-what is it Draco?" He said lowly, too lowly he thought the other boy didn't hear it, but putting in mind that his mouth was a bit too close to his ear, and the place being deadly quiet, he figured Draco heard him just fine.
with Draco, but he knew for a fact that things weren't how they used to be, Draco
The sight of him was growing rather alarming to Harry as the blond was fully turned to face him. His eyes traced the bruises, spots of deep purple scattered around his abdomen, radiant against his bloodless skin, with the edges turning slightly yellow as a sign of healing. But that wasn't the worst of it, it didn't surprise him to see those marks, even though he wished to not see them. It wasn't until his eyes fell on his arm that Harry started to look entirely dreadful. He paled at the sight of lines inscribed on the inside of his forearm, messy they were and piled upon each other. His insides were continually shrinking, and he could no longer look at Draco without losing his ability to breathe. He could hear the other boy mumbling some things as a result of being startled, but he couldn't clearly make out his words.
"Honestly, don't you know how to cleanse a cut?" He sighed with a disapproving head shake as he gave a studying look to the lively wound before him, watching it begin to close on its own.
Her response did disappoint Harry, knowing that he was the only one who was unreasonably anxious about the boy he hated most, or thought so for too long. But he somehow didn't think about it, not one bit, as though once her sentence was heard, it was thrown to the back of his head almost at once, he couldn't feel the disappointment as he was meant to, it didn't bother him much that he was quite obsessively concerned about Malfoy.
"Well then, good night. See you tomorrow at breakfast? Please do show up." On his way out, Harry turned back for a last glance. His hand was in the air, and he waved with a sheepish smile before completely focusing on finding his way out. On what earth did Harry ever want to see Draco?
"She did!" He never had that much courage to talk back to his father, but this time was different. His father never really crossed this line before, and therefore neither did Draco. Yes, he would occasionally poke him with his cane, hit him once or twice at a time, but that was the furthest he ever went. But now that this line had vanished, there was no reason for Draco to respect it.
it's September, and September is suicide prevention month :). If you are planning to put an end to it, please don't. I know it's hard and I know what you're going through isn't easy, but just know that there are people here who are truly willing to help, such as myself, and some others who share the experience. If you need any help, please don't hesitate to ask for it, I'm always here to offer all the support I can give. And remember, you're strong, stronger than you think. Self harm isn't an answer either, so don't go for it. Once again, I know it's hard, and you might think it's impossible, but there are countless ways to healthily cope with things, those you have to consider first before going to harm yourself. And know, you're worthy of all the love in the world :).
"Hey Daniel, did you know that Malfoy's mom fell in love with a mudblood?" He shouted across the grounds to someone who seemed to be standing just down the little hill he sat on, while trying to look back without breaking the eye contact with Draco.
With his eyes lingering to Harry, he traced Harry’s dick with his tongue as if he was licking an ice cream, and watched Harry’s back arching a little higher with a moan louder than the rest, which only seemed to tell Draco to do it again. And again, Draco licked him clean over and over, having that reaction doubled. Then, when he was done with that, he took Harry’s stiff cock in his mouth again and sucked without lifting his gaze off of Harry. As he sucked more and more, Harry overflowed him with moans, biting his bottom lip to trap in those who could have been far too loud, with random incoherent babble slipping through the moans, something along the lines of
Draco rolled his eyes in boredom, but he didn't look as bothered by the lack of justice as Harry, if he was bothered at all. The boy on the other hand, seemed to be very pleased with the outcome of the conversation, looking at the two of Harry and Draco with a sneer he didn't intend to hide.
Harry made sure his steps weren't heard as he followed behind Draco in silence. He seemed to be in a rush, as though haunted by his own shadow. It took Harry a bit of a moment to gather up the voice to speak, as he was still struck by what he got to see, and he knew for a fact that the blonde boy would rather die than talk to him in that very moment.
Vigorous pain shot through his jaw as he felt his father's fingers spend every last shred of power in them squeezing his jaw, he was too sure his bones would turn to dust if he kept going. His father's brows were knitted together as his eyes were burning through his soul. His teeth were clutched together that he could tell his father's jaw would break as well for how hard he clutched his teeth.
Harry's head was turned towards the door rather violently as someone stormed in furiously, catching not only Harry's attention but everyone else's. At first glance, he saw Draco standing tall at the door momentarily, and it felt to him as though the blonde boy was staring right at him and specifically him. But Harry knew for a fact he wasn't.
He wished to feel like there would be someone standing behind him when he falls, to know that there will be someone to collect his pieces and bring them all together while he's falling apart. It scared him to think that when he completely falls, when there's nothing of him left standing, he will be erased off, carried by the wind for there was no one who would hold on to his fragments. He felt adrift. Ironic, how he used show it off that his father was always there for him, yet it turned out he walked away from him before every other person. He never truly knew how it felt to have a friend, a real one, someone who didn't stick around because of his last name. And his mother, even if she had a shred of love for him, she was forced away from him. He was alone in the world.
It had been a while, ages, since the last time he spoke with such enthusiasm, if he had ever sensed liveliness in his voice, but for a reason he did not know, he felt easeful enough to talk. What was it about Harry that made him unravel himself each and every time? How could he attract things out of him just by silently staring? Was it the look in his eye, impossibly gentle, declaring safety for him to speak? Or was it simply his presence? Draco could never tell.
"Does this mean we can start clean?" Draco let himself sink in a moment or two of silence to give that question a good thought in his head before asking. He wasn't certain if he was truthfully ready, building such friendship on unsettled grounds, in fact he wasn't sure if he had any ability to put trust in anyone anymore. But he also couldn't deny how badly he was aching to have someone, someone who had yet to hurt him, and Harry seemed to be a heaven sent answer for his wishes, so what's the worst thing to potentially happen if he gave Harry a try for some time? He had nothing to lose, and a lot to gain.
He wasn't on
The lighting in the bathroom was dim, almost nonexistent, but still he could spot the tiniest little glimmers in Draco cold-blue eyes, caused by the gathering tears that worked like sparkling water. His face was broken into an unfamiliar pucker, something Harry had yet to get used to since all he had ever seen from Draco was his smirks of pride. He never really had the chance to see pain - or any other emotion - appear ever so vividly on his pale face.
"We managed to tell  her that you're just an arrogant swine, which you may or may not have been." After being done with his work, the gryffindor sat on the floor facing towards Draco, hugging his knees closer to his chest. Chuckles smoothly slid through his last few words, and Draco could only wonder how he got the confidence to talk to him with such ease, something he truly wished he had.
"Put the wand down, Draco." Draco, though hesitantly, lowered his wand slowly when Harry told him to. He seemed to feel safe at last, or perhaps just too tired and bored that he didn't bother to care even if Harry was to hurt him.
"D-Draco?" A chipped low voice came from behind, followed by a slight tap on his shoulder. He recognized that voice, and it both terrified him and elated him at the same time.
"Yeah, sure." Lupin replied with confusion all over his voice, it's not every day that he has Dumbledore taking away one of his students. He had no other option but to agree regardless of not knowing what was going around.
His father came out a while after, seemingly for a breath of air, but once he did the air got thicker. His father, unlike his mother, seemed to noticed his figure at the end of the hall, but he wished he didn't. He glared at him, his eyes suddenly so sharp, as if the sight of his son was a disaster in itself, it felt like a warning of a kind. Draco wanted to disappear.
"Yeah right, they thought your brain got cooked." Turning to his right, to where the voice seemed to come from, he saw Goyle, sitting on a stool beside him and laughing at his own stupid statement, the statement that only got him disapproved and annoyed looks from all the three teachers. Goyle and Crabb were the very last couple of people he wanted to see at that moment, anyone but them. That was a thought he regretted thinking of almost immediately.
"Right, Pansy, is it because they charmed you into doing it? Because it wasn't something you willfully did?" He was burning on the inside, and it reflected in his voice as he bothered not to hide a bit of it. No matter what he did to block that vision of her triumphant smirk, it still remained ineffaceable in his mind. Throughout all the days that had passed he tried to give it a reason he'd believe, he tried to make it feel like it was the right thing to do, but every time he ended empty handed.
Despite the blinding sunlight breaking through his eyes, giving them a kind of a glimmer, he could see a group of four people he couldn't say he had seen before, but judging by the colors of their uniforms, the gold and red, he could tell they were gryfinndors.
"Let go of my son, Narcissa. He does not deserve to be touched by a disgrace like yourself." His father pushed him back rather robustly that he almost fell off his feet. And in that moment his eyes fixed themselves on his father and refused to look at anything except him, looking at him with  somewhat of a shock, somewhat of a fear, but mostly anger. He wanted an explanation, he
He glanced around the darkness of the room one last time, to make sure that none of them was conscious enough to feel him leave or feel his absence later. He climbed out of bed as slowly and as quietly as ever, feeling the cool wood of the floor warm up beneath his feet. He picked the closest thing to a clothing item he could see off the floor, which was a hoodie, and put it on just as quietly. Making his way toward the dormitory door, he glanced back again, praying that this wouldn't be something to regret later. He didn't exactly have the best feeling about it, following Draco, but it was a voice inside of him that insisted he did so. Seeing what he saw and knowing what he knew, he knew for a fact that it would very much keep him up all night if he ignored it, it could carve in his soul deeper to ignore it than to be insulted for trying. It wasn't one of those things he could brush off for someone else to handle, as he was the only one who knew, and it wasn't a cold matter to sleep on.
