She winced. “It can’t be a big deal. If it were a big deal, Harry’d have told me.”
“New Years Eve?” Pansy shot back, raising a brow.
Draco huffed a bitter laugh. “Right. I’m so impressive.” He looked over Harry’s shoulder and scanned the room. “Why don’t you get back to Cian, Harry. You left him lonely. We can continue this incredibly depressing conversation another time, okay?”
“Harry, you can’t!” exclaimed Hermione.
He settled into Harry, making himself comfortable. “Tell a story?” he said, putting a thumb in his mouth.
“I already said I’m willing to try. I’ll make no promises regarding my intentions. I’m sure they’re convoluted. I’m sure part of me wants to be your friend so that it’s harder for you to move on. And I’m always going to want to sleep with you.”
“He’s worried. I freely admit, it’s dangerous, going in blind, not knowing what you’re up against. But by all accounts, I should retain my ability to wield Sen in every world.”
Draco settled himself between Harry’s thighs and lined up his cock. He stopped when just his tip had penetrated Harry’s hole, and asked again, as he already had five hundred times, if Harry was okay. “I’m good,” Harry promised. “I’ll tell you if I’m not.”
John went through an introduction to all the equipment, and the process. He explained how to jump and how to position yourself. He explained that Draco would be jumping in tandem with Charlie, which made Draco feel just a tiny bit better. Draco had to sign some waivers, and then Ben helped Draco into a black jumpsuit and a helmet, then strapped on his parachute, checking all the buckles again and again. Then they were boarding the airplane, which was really very small.
Harry took another gulp from the bottle as it passed.
Having Harry Potter poking around in his kitchen was one of the most surreal moments of Draco’s life. Potter was here, in his flat, touching all his stuff and sauntering about in his tight t-shirt and jeans, looking for things like spatulas (Draco had no idea where these were, and was on rather shaky ground regarding
But before the guards at the doors could open them, the air in the room seemed to shift and change, so much so that even William felt it, and looked over at Draco, his eyebrows knitting together. Everything seemed to contract for a moment, becoming tight and narrow, and Draco almost felt that he couldn’t breathe around the pressure.
. Draco was fairly certain he’d never made Potter laugh before. Or smile, probably. But laughter seemed like a real achievement, somehow. “Really? And what lucky girl has the privilege of shagging a fit bloke such as yourself?” Potter asked.
Harry rose and stepped towards him, not stopping until he was standing very close. He’d never been this fucking close to Malfoy before, so close that he could see the darker ring of gray around the edge of Malfoy’s irises, and the little scar he had above one of his arched eyebrows. Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest, freight-train fast and freight-train loud.
Harry nodded vigorously.
rather cozy-looking.
Pansy and Blaise stayed next to the coach, Blaise standing rather formally, Pansy leaning against it and winking up at Ron.
“I already told you that I have no idea,” Harry said, grinning. “I just thought this might feel good.” Then he lowered himself onto Draco so that their skin was touching everywhere. His skin was hot, his eyes hotter, as he began to kiss Draco again, grinding a bit against him.
Draco smiled, taking in the laughing green eyes in front of him. “Like to keep you on your toes.”
“I’m sorry.” He felt terrible, then. He wasn’t sure what he felt so guilty about, whether it was from getting in the way of Harry and Ginny in the first place or not telling Ginny earlier in the summer, but he felt terrible, just awful. He could hear the hurt beneath Ginny’s anger and he hated that he’d caused it.
At Glum’s Marsh, Edwin had been big and solid and strong. Not bulky, like Pike, but formidable. He’d lost weight since then – a considerable amount of it – and his coloring was terrible. He looked grayish. Sickly. His clothes were in tatters, and his face was streaked with grime. He had his head leaned back against the stone wall opposite the bars of the cell, his eyes closed. “Edwin,” Draco said softly.
Harry and Ron had settled on button-ups and trousers, and Harry had thrown on a blue blazer that he’d purchased for Padma Patil’s wedding the year before.
“Pansy said you were glorious in bed, so I suspect you know how to turn off your brain while you’re pleasuring someone. You
“I know,” Harry said. “I just…I liked her. She saved me. And I could tell that there was a lot of good in her. And I – I hated what happened. It wasn’t fair.”
“Well, that’s stupid,” said Draco, moving past him towards the door. It was stupid. And also, it was hot in this fucking room. Draco felt warm all over, and claustrophobic.
Harry and Draco were still running several mornings a week. Well, Harry was. Draco went nearly every day. One morning, when he hadn’t been planning on going along, Harry woke up when Draco was slipping out of his bed. “Running?” he asked.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and Harry nudged him again, harder this time. “I would need to run home and get pajamas and toothbrushes and whatnot.”
Draco had no idea what the fuck was happening, so he let Pansy lead him to one of the chairs that was sitting in front of the long table with shiny cubes on top.
we could move to the house in Maine. Grow our own food and fish for the rest. Live off the grid.”
with things. Possibly all of the above. “Fine,” he said after a moment, his eyes narrowed, his body tense everywhere.
Draco nodded. God, Draco was unhappy, and Harry was unhappy. This was why talks were stupid. They didn’t actually solve
Scorpius smiled and shook his head again, and then, to Harry’s horror, crawled up into his lap and dug his finger into Harry’s scar again. Harry tried not to wince – the kid’s nails needed a bit of a trim.
light pouring through muslin
Draco felt himself tense. “Oh, it’s something, alright. It’s basically mandatory membership in a fucking cult, Hermione. That legacy is what gave us Voldemort, make no mistake about it.”
, for goodness’ sake.
, because you ruined everything for me. I can’t even get it up thinking about him, which is just…a goddamned travesty. Because I should be able to get it up thinking about him, because he’s hot as hell. But you’ve broken not just me, but my cock, too. You
Not two minutes later, they were returning with a gigantic tower of a man with a black bucket hat on his head. “Come along all,” quipped Pansy, smiling benevolently over the group of them.
“How am I being a git about it?”
Fuck, he couldn’t breathe. Mother fuck.
Draco bit down his response and Potter’s fingers withdrew.
“Is ‘Mione going to be home tonight? We could talk her into making us something.”
Frankie shrugged. “No. He’s taken on the occasional woman. Lia was with his Stags initially, before she joined Laurel’s Foxes. The women just don’t stay with Edwin for very long.”
Cian was an excellent buffer, because he was very friendly and unaware, and when it became clear he wasn’t going anywhere, Dominic drifted away, seemingly tolerant of leaving Draco to chat so long as it wasn’t just with Harry.
“Sweet Merlin,” sighed Ron. “How ‘bout you sit on it for a day and see how you feel?”
Draco tromped over to his house and put on his black leather pants and his tightest white t-shirt and his dragonhide boots and a cashmere scarf and a black military-style coat and flooed back to Pansy’s, where she was touching up her makeup in the magenta bathroom. She had a tumbler full of whiskey on the rocks sitting next to her. Draco picked it up and chugged half of it before setting it back down. “Eyeliner,” he said, pointing to his face. “And shimmer.”
“No. I’ve never spoken to him or written him or had any communication with him whatsoever.”
Harry shook his head, his eyes filling. It ought to be embarrassing, to be crying, but it wasn’t. After all that Malfoy had seen, it wasn’t.
better. Make himself worthy of Harry Potter’s affections.
That led me straight to you
She giggled.
“I didn’t put that there.”
The sins of our parents
“Er…”
“That sounds incredible,” Hermione said. “I mean, really. You should do that. Fuck trading.”
“Eh, no. I can’t keep those places straight, Harry,” Draco said.
!” Hermione cried, stomping her foot. “You’re being ridiculous!”
He would have done it. He would have done it if Draco had let him. He wouldn’t have even asked for the same in return. He thought Draco probably tasted like clean sweat, and imagined what it would feel like, if Draco came in his mouth, how
“Use mine. It’s okay,” said Draco.
“You know, back in school…” Pansy trailed off, frowning. “Daphne and Theo were friends in school, weren’t they?”
“Fucker!” hissed Harry, reaching for Malfoy again, only Malfoy started running down the hall, cackling. “You bastard,” Harry mumbled, running after him. They raced down the stairs and into what Harry now referenced mentally as the drug den, since the night he’d smoked up in there.
Draco laughed. “Indeed.”
“No,” said Draco. “I s’pose it doesn’t.”
“He does. He’s like a little baby kitty hissing at you,” said Pansy.
Potter laughed again and went back to chopping celery. Draco went back to looking for the masher and then sneaking bits of carrot.
, please.”
When he’d stepped through the floo into Harry’s townhouse, Harry felt great about his decision. Ari looked hot as fuck in a white jacket with black lapels and pocket trim, his hair cropped close on the sides and in the back, the soft blond curls in front falling into his dark blue eyes. They had a glass of wine in the kitchen and talked, and it had felt very comfortable and nice.
Charlie was smiling up at Harry sleepily, and he was so handsome, and it wasn’t difficult to remember how much Harry had wanted him not so long ago. He’d always been impressed with Charlie and attracted to Charlie, with his toughness and his dangerous job and his devil-may-care attitude. He laughed so easily and looked at life like one great, big adventure. And Merlin, he was hot. He really, really was.
“You look like shit.”
Harry walked in and looked around, appearing as nervous as Draco felt. He ran a hand through his already messy hair, and afterward, it looked a bit like he’d been electrocuted. “Can we talk?” he asked.
He scowled. He had done that before, sure, but not, like, all the time. “And
On Sunday, they packed up their things and kissed Draco’s mother goodbye and apparated to the gates of Hogwarts. “I had a marvelous time,” Pansy remarked as they waited for one of the house elves to come open the gates. “We ought to live in London after school. Except, oh wait, you and Potter might be married by then and living in the Manor.”
was why it was okay to tell Draco this stuff. “Yup,” Harry said. “That’s exactly what it is. I did it on purpose so I could stand out.” Draco laughed. “There’s medication I could take, but I’m not sure I want to. Doesn’t seem to be strictly necessary, or whatever.”
The Sorting Hat was serving double-duty this term: assigning first years to Houses as it usually did, and also matching up eighth-year students with a roommate. McGonagall had explained that it had been instructed to put students with a roommate who would help them learn and grow, who would motivate them to strive for excellence.
A sudden light bloomed in the darkness. Then another. Then another.
“Not enslaved. Just pushed to a little corner of the kingdom and not allowed to own property or hold titles or any of that. William’s going to create reforms, though, once he’s king,” Frankie said. “And abolish the slave trade, of course.”
, he wrote.
“I think that’s a good idea,” Pansy said, patting his shoulder.
: you’re not texting back, so you’re either passed out or doing something stupid with weasley or you hate me
Unfortunately, it irritated the hell out of everyone else on staff. Shacklebolt had to sit them down and give them a talking-to several times, explaining that although they were both extremely hard workers with a knack for campaigning, he would fire them (and possibly hex them) if they didn’t knock it off with the constant pissing contests.
“Fuck, the way you look when you arch like that,” Harry said, kissing along his spine. “What else do you love?”
“One thing doesn’t negate the other, Draco!” Harry said, sounding more worked up than he meant to. “The fact that you discovered our breakup wasn’t as simple as you thought it was doesn’t mean all your feelings for Astoria vanished!”
“No, you’re the one who hates

on it? Or maybe a blasting curse, even.”
“You’re making fun of me for it?” Harry cried, trying to sound offended, although Draco could hear the amusement in his voice. “Have I ever told you that you’re the worst?”
“I wonder if it’s because of Voldemort,” Potter said quietly.
“It’s fine, Draco. I’ll come find you if Felix tries to take advantage of me.”
Pansy raised an arched eyebrow. “Really? We’re being glib about it now?”
Blaise was sitting with the kids at breakfast, looking exasperated. Astoria realized that Archie was clinging to Blaise’s leg. He’d always been Daddy-obsessed, but since Daphne’s death, it had gone from cute to mildly concerning.
He put his face in his hands and tried to calm his breaths, still enveloped in the feeling of horror and wrongness carried over from the dream. He thought of that other Hermione, who cuddled with him and put up with pretending to be his girlfriend. Was she safe? Was she being careful?
“I didn’t,” he said. He hadn’t. He knew he hadn’t. “It must have fallen in.”
“Mate, you talking to yourself again?” came a voice from behind Harry. Seamus.
Euri put a hand on Harry’s leg. “You feel better?”
“Maybe he’s feeling weird about you having that talk with the Weasley girl,” Pansy said later that day when Harry went to go consult with her. She was painting her nails blood red. “It’s clear you two have…
In retrospect, Harry should have seen it coming.
She nodded once and then left the room.
Potter’s green eyes flickered in Draco’s direction and stalled. Draco gave him an impervious look. Once, he’d have been embarrassed to be sitting in a pub alone while Potter was flanked by his groupies. Now, who gave a fuck? What did it matter? Everyone knew Draco was garbage, that he’d fallen as low as one could fall, that he was only here at all because Potter had declared it so. So what if he was alone on top of that?
“Why?” Draco asked. Why would Kerrick have come here?
But Potter didn’t even look up. He had his gaze fixed resolutely on the ground. And, as Draco watched him follow his friends through the crowded pub, he saw that his posture was even more horrendous than usual. He looked almost…broken. Draco found, to his surprise, he missed Potter’s usual arrogance and swagger.
, part of Draco thought, but the rest of him was itching to move, to get out of this room and find out what the hell was going on.
“You ready?” asked Ben.
Draco brought their cocks together in his hand, moving his hips and his hand in tandem, and Harry moaned beneath him. “Does that feel okay?” asked Draco.
“Oh, Merlin. I used to
“Because…?” Draco said.
“Ah, not surprised. She strikes me as being very…flexible, with her love life.”
rather exciting, the notion of being part of a real league. "We’d still have the different teams here at school, of course, but in my mind, those would become more of a rec league. The all-school team would be the competitive team. We’d have a single mascot, school colors instead of house colors, and so on.”
Ron just shook his head, looking overwhelmed. "No."
“No, that’s not…I just don’t want to talk about her.”
Draco’s mouth opened and then closed again. “Then, why?” he asked, finally.
She managed to grin at him. “As though you’d have lasted a day in training, you muppet.”
He was rewarded with a deep chuckle from Malfoy. “You’d best go, Potter. You’ll be late.”
“It doesn’t have to be me or the other worlds. I feel like you think of it that way, because I have some concerns about it. But I’m not opposed.” He kissed Draco gently, his soft mouth sending a flash of heat down Draco’s spine that seemed to pool in his hips and between his legs. “I could even go with you.”
“Then don’t,” said Draco.
Draco considered this. “It’s possible.” He thought about the strange discrepancies in magic here. Potter couldn’t work any, not at all. He said he didn’t feel his magic here, even. Draco had been able to cast with a wand, but not without. He knew that magic was often instinctual, that it happened by mistake in the case of muggle-borns before they learned what they were, and it also happened to wizarding infants. Draco, for instance, had set his nursery curtains ablaze more than once.
“Yes?” Draco prompted.
, Sar.”
“You must sit next to me, Harry,” Pansy said, patting the seat beside her. Harry sat, looking scared. “I have so many things I want to ask you,” she continued. “Like -- ”
Lia, who was, in Draco’s experience, endlessly brave, seemed wholly freaked out. She noticed him watching her and scowled. “It’s just that I haven’t been around very much magic in my life. My father was the only one who had any, and he just used it to –”
The three of them hustled out of the hotel, ignoring everyone who was asking where they were going, and apparated to the Ministry of Magic’s lobby. Sarah looked around, openmouthed. “Come on, no time to stand there gawking,” she said, tugging at her hand. “We’ve got to hurry.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, throwing his head back against the back of the sofa and closing his eyes for a moment. “I really should have.”
Although, now that Charlie’s mouth was covering his, there wasn’t a whole lot of room for squeamishness. In for a penny and all that.
him. Yes, infuriated. That felt much better.
“I’m serious,” he insisted. “Can we talk? Privately?”
“Goodnight, Harry.”
“I thought it was just fucking,” Draco said darkly. Oh, he had gotten himself worked up into one of his moods, hadn’t he? “Isn’t that what you said?”
Harry reached over and grabbed his hand, just briefly, and gave it a squeeze. “Are you mad at me?”
“Fine.”
“Daphne’s cheating on me,” he said. “And I loved you.”
“Sometimes I like to be the little spoon, you know,” Harry said, grinning. “Sometimes I need your big, strong arms around me.”
Draco looked at him with flashing eyes. “I what? Will seemed to like this.”
“Sicked up on the Knight Bus,” said Dean.
On my own, here we go
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, considering. “Should’ve known that jumper wasn’t yours,” he said. “Fit much too well.”
“Okay,” he said, lazily
“And? You’re going, right?”
Harry looked quickly over at him. “Why?” he asked, his hand stilling against Malfoy’s socked foot.
“Yeah, sure,” said Harry. Seamus produced something that Harry was mostly certain was not a cigarette and lit it with his wand. He took a long pull from it and Harry caught a whiff and decided it was
“Yes, well, you said it back. So there,” Draco replied.
“I hope that doesn’t mean I sounded too smooth?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. You never wanted to sound overly rehearsed and polished. You wanted to sound sincere, casual.
“I know you don’t believe me,” she said, barreling on ahead anyway. “But I’m telling the truth. I didn’t do any of those things. And I want to prove myself to you. I’d like you to test me, by whichever means you prefer. Legilimency, if you want, or Veritaserum. You could have Pansy do it. She’s excellent at legilimency, and you trust her. Or, she could administer the Veritaserum if you’d rather. She could supply it, so you’d know it hadn’t been tampered with.”
Malfoy looked flabbergasted. “But you. You...” He huffed. “Why are you even here, at the club, I mean? Aren’t you married to the Weasley girl by now?”
“We had a bit of a mishap,” Pansy said, when they reached the bottom. She looked at Scorpius, who was the very picture of innocence, all wide eyes and tousled white-blonde hair. “Scorpius, why don’t you tell your father what happened.”
“Harry?” asked Hermione, and Harry realized she’d been saying something to him.
Draco pressed himself more firmly against Harry. “You’re especially impressive when you put your mouth –”
“Morning,” Harry whispered.
Pansy was silent for a moment and then she burst out laughing. “Oh, it fucking figures!” she cackled. “He was always such an attention hound! It figures he’d wind up on stage.”
Draco laughed. “I dunno. Sometimes I think I’m the sort of person who’ll never be content. I’m always looking ahead, towards the next thing.”
Instead, Draco stood up and ran a hand through his white-blond hair. He looked exhausted and haunted, like he needed a hug and a glass of warm milk, followed by a few days’ worth of sleep. “I’m sorry, Harry. I could’ve talked to you, too. This is not just on you.”
“I wasn’t planning on it, but now that you’re being an arsehole…”
“But she’s not going to want to leave the Wizengamot.”
“Daphne?” offered Harry.
happy about it,” he said.
, you pig,” Draco replied, his lip curling in disgust.
Pansy said goodnight an hour later and apparated back to her place, still having done no more than snog Sarah horizontally. Why she was moving at a turtle’s pace with this thing, she wasn’t sure. But she knew that all those times before, when she had barreled ahead into love (or what she’d called love), it had ended in disaster. And there was something about Sarah that made her want to be careful. She wanted to do things right. And since she had no fucking clue what ‘doing things right’ meant, she was taking things infuriatingly slowly, and hoping that at some point, she’d figure it out. There was something in Sarah, something warm and bright and easy, that seemed to draw Pansy in and made her want to protect it, to keep darkness at bay.
“Yeah, okay. Let me get changed,” he said.
“Fuck
“What the hell’d you do to Robbie now, jackass? Why’d he stomp out of here looking like he was ready to commit homicide?” she said.
Potter looked taken aback. “What? No, I don’t –” He finally put down his wand, letting it hang limp by his side. “Of course not.”
, so I’m not even going to be
“And she didn’t do it,” Draco said. “She didn’t fucking do it.”
“No, no, no. Boys!” Hermione yelled, slamming her hand down on the table. “Disrespectful!”
Thankfully, they were interrupted by a group of women – members of the studio who never missed Harry’s classes – coming into the room, chatting. “Um, excuse me, I’ve got to say hello,” Harry said awkwardly, making his way over.
Daphne spun now, landing on Ron. She made her way over to him and looked at Hermione for a moment. “Sorry,” she said, and then proceeded to give him a very chaste, very brief kiss on the mouth. Hermione looked relieved, and Ron
“Well, Dick and Bunny Greengrass,” said Draco. “I suppose.”
Their legs tangled together, and Draco’s hand stroked along Harry’s arm as his tongue curled softly into Harry’s mouth. Harry sighed and turned his head a bit, deepening the kiss, and soon Draco was pressing his hips to Harry’s, and Harry was tilting his head back while Draco kissed over his jaw, “I missed you,” Draco said. “I missed you so much.”
Harry could use a cup of tea this time. Something, anything, to calm his nerves. “Thanks,” he said, as Draco hurried off.
The muggle behind the desk, who had silver rings all up and down her ears and one through her eyebrow and another through her lip, handed them each a card with a bunch of numbers and letters on it. “That’s your login information,” she said.
quite good at capturing passion on film,” Draco said, grinning over at him.
“Of course,” said Malfoy.
“Well, I’ll be in the shower if you come up with anything. Feel free to come in and share.”
“You heard me,” Draco said, angling his chin up into the air and pretending like he wasn’t going to die of embarrassment if Potter started laughing.
Harry replied.
Draco thought that was unlikely, but there wasn’t much they could do about it. They took off their robes and Draco transfigured them into sleeping bags, and then they collected firewood and stacked it on the beach, and Draco lit it. It felt wonderful against the chill. “It’s quite cold,” he said, when he’d spread out under the covers.
his house and the Manor and the whole fucking world. He wanted to hit Malfoy as hard as he could in the jaw. He wanted to throw hexes at him and possibly stab him in the face.
Malfoy looked pleased by the compliment, although he seemed to be trying not to smile. “I don’t mind it. I’d like to get to know Albus better. I like to know Scorpius’s friends. But Pansy tells me Albus is a very sweet child. And I’ve already decided that Lily’s wonderful.”
“I’m the bastard handing you gold, though.”
“Then fight!” Berold growled from somewhere nearby, swinging.
When Mr. Weasley threw up extra wards around the property one day and suggested everyone get their brooms for a game of Quidditch, Draco nearly cried with relief. He was not going to play, obviously, but he would have the house to himself, which was, at that point, the thing he wanted most in the entire world: a space totally devoid of Weasleys. Even Mrs. Weasley and Hermione were going, to referee.
“There’s fine,” Charlie said easily, the smile never leaving his face. He was looking Draco over discreetly, and it seemed as though he liked what he saw, his eyes skipping down Draco’s body and then lingering on his face.
, I’ve been a bad,
“I’d hoped, too,” Draco said quietly. “Especially when I returned without Harry. But my heart wasn’t free, even then. Even when I wanted it to be.”
“Okay,” Malfoy said.
“Hey, don’t be obvious about it, but look over at Charlie and Draco and tell me what you see, will you?” Harry asked.
Pansy smirked up at Malfoy. “I bet it will be now.”
“Stephens,” Potter said by way of greeting. “What’s the word?”
“Oh, Merlin. You Slytherins are such a bunch of gossips. Honestly.”
“Ron,” she said, turning to him.
Harry and Draco got into another whopper of a fight after Christmas, when Harry accused Draco of flirting with Charlie on Christmas Eve, which did not happen at all. Draco could not help what his eyelashes did, and he did not appreciate what Harry was implying. That one ended with a dramatic slap, and then an even more dramatic make-up shag.
“I don’t have much time,” he said. “I’ve got to meet Ernie.”
Soon enough, Pansy was pounding on Draco’s door. She was wearing a burgundy velvet dress trimmed with black satin at the hem. “Well, don’t you boys clean up well!” she exclaimed. “I hope you’re done primping, though, because you
“Oh, you poor boy! I knew people were being mean to you!” exclaimed Myrtle from the stall.
Harry sighed into the phone.
“Likewise,” he said. “So. I suppose I’ll see you when I see you. Say hello to your muggle for me.”
Honestly, many of them were much more interested in meeting Draco, which was fine with Harry. A few people asked Harry questions about himself, about the war, about what he’d done since, of course. But it was friendly chit-chat, for the most part, instead of intrusive curiosity.
“Lots of activity in Azkaban. I almost wish I was there instead of here with you. Although I am looking forward to watching you die, you fucking blood traitor.” He smiled. “And then there’s the muggle attacks. Should begin in an hour or two. We’re declaring war, Malfoy. War against the muggles. All over the world, wizards are going to open fire into muggle crowds. I’m talking blasting curses, Fiendfyre, even. Robes on, wands out. Very dramatic. We’re forcing their hand so they have no choice but to go after us. And then we’re going to annihilate them in retaliation.” He laughed now, a low, throaty chuckle. “It’s going to be so much fun.”
Harry made a pleased sound and sucked at Draco’s earlobe. “I want details.”
Potter took a bite of the bread and moaned. “Oh my god, this is so good. Holy shit. It’s better than Ilana’s.”
“Lovely! What excellent news!” Draco said through clenched teeth. “I forget why I like you sometimes, do you know that, Pans? Sometimes, it’s all very unclear.”
The kiss was just as tingly and heart-stoppingly lovely as the first two were, although it was tempered by the fact that all their classmates were watching and Harry was totally sober. Malfoy tasted incredible, and Harry marveled at the fact that, at this point, it felt almost comfortable, kissing him. It was the third time, after all. Although…he was counting the last instance as one occurrence, but they’d kissed like mad. If you counted all those as separate kisses, he had no idea how many it would be. A hundred, maybe.
Draco died in that moment, he was almost positive of it. Thankfully, his unending need to be snarky revived him. “You have me arse up, spread out on a desk at the bank, Potter. I’m fairly certain my cock is dripping all over the mahogany. Do you honestly think I’m going to say no?”
“Some men, I’m sure,” Draco said, patting her on the back. “Chin up, love. You’re a captain in the royal army, and a war hero besides. And you’re adorable. You’ll do all right.”
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
“Erm, came with my friend, Draco.” He looked around and saw Draco in a conversation with a woman in tattered overalls and an iridescent tube top, but Draco’s eyes were on Harry. Harry waved and indicated that Draco should come over. He didn’t want him to think…well. He didn’t want Draco to think anything, about this conversation.
“Maybe it was both?” Harry said, shrugging again.
The last time Harry had imbibed at Luna’s house, everything had looked sparkly for five days. “Definitely,” he said.
He stared out the window, and thought he glimpsed the glimmer of water under a bright moon. But this ocean was rugged and rocky, waves crashing brutally at the shore. And the ground all around him wasn’t sandy. It was covered in
Draco clenched his jaw. Harry sat by quietly, not knowing what to say, and hating the awkwardness he suddenly felt, and hating that Draco’d rushed to Astoria’s defense.
Draco hated how he asked the question, almost accusatorily, like Draco didn’t have the right to be in Hermione’s house. “Hermione invited me.”
Nobody was in the vast, manicured lawn to greet him, so he continued the seemingly never-ending trek up the drive, which gave him time to reconsider what the fuck he was doing. This was probably a really stupid idea, only now he was here, and so he couldn’t turn tail and run, because then he’d look like a complete weirdo.
“Blast it!” Berold cursed quietly beside him. “Blast it, blast it! Where in the moons is William?”
“I don’t think that’ll be a problem from his perspective,” Draco said.
“Yeah, he was…” Harry took a sip of his pint and tried to think of a way to say it. “He was quite proper and talked the way Malfoy always talked, but he was
“Draco would’ve been furious,” says the dark-haired man. “Draco
“Fuck you. You’re such a shit. I don’t know
“I had a brilliant time,” Draco said, giving him a small smile. “Can’t remember the last time I stayed up until sunrise. I imagine it was with you.”
“Draco!” called Pansy.
. Harry pressed against him, taking his mouth without mercy, going positively mad with desire, wanting to fling him back onto the armchair, wanting to crawl all over him, rut against his thighs, lick his neck and his chest, tear at his clothes.
Pansy stared at him, her mouth opening and closing. “That makes no sense. Draco doesn’t like
“I’m in charge of breakfast. And besides, you’re so good in the kitchen, why would I even bother?”
“Hang on,” said Draco, hurrying away. “Be right back.”
, and he
“You have any summer suits?” Euri asked.
“No, stay," said Draco. "Drink with us. We’re moping tonight.”
“Yeah, ‘course. Just give me a minute,” he said. “You bloody sex fiend.”
Harry leaned back against the rim of the tub and closed his eyes. “No, I know. If either one of us did anything wrong, it was me.”
She looked over at him, her softly ringed eyes wide. “He tried what with you?”
“Come here,” said Draco. Harry sat on the edge of the bed. “Give me your wand.”
Draco felt the world shiver again, the ground suddenly unsteady under his feet. He felt himself waver a bit, as bright sparks danced at the edges of his vision. Edwin was alive. Strangely, Draco was relieved to know he hadn't killed anyone. But he was also filled with a shivering, creeping fear about what came next. Edwin would not let this rest; Draco was almost certain about that.
It hit him all of a sudden, the memory of what Draco’d said, and it felt like a punch to the gut, so much so that he curled up around his pillow at the feel of that phantom pain. “Shit,” he muttered.
“Oh, nobody’s close by. I said it quietly,” she said. Suddenly, her curiosity won out over her desire to keep hating Draco. “How’s it been, anyway? Are you alright?”
“Thank you, darling,” he said, kissing his soft cheek.
“Interesting,” Astoria said, tossing her long hair behind her shoulder and crossing her ankles. She saw Blaise’s eyes flit to her legs and that was good, because maybe he’d talk if he was distracted. “I thought you were taking other sorts of risks again. According to Daphne, anyway.”
,” Draco said with exasperation.
We smoked the screen to make
“Okay,” Potter said, nodding. “I’ll help you. Or, well, we’ll help each other. You’ll help me get Katie back and I’ll help you teach Macmillan a lesson.” He made a face. “Are we going to have to snog in public and stuff?”
Draco gathered Sen and cast just as one of the karkadan – the first one – gave another deep whinny. “There! Run!” he cried, whirling.
“I’m aware,” Ginny said, winking.
Draco grimaced, and then grew curiously blank. “Well, what do you know? You’ve been around us together, what, twice? You don’t know what it’s like otherwise. You don’t know how sweet he is to me sometimes, how much he cares about me. He’s the only one looking out for me. In the whole world, he’s the only one who gives a
“I think you love me,” Draco whispered, smiling at her.
The kiss was soft and hesitant, entirely at odds with the way Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest. After a moment, Draco moved closer, his arms snaking up Harry’s chest to tangle in his hair, and Harry shifted to kiss him deeper, his tongue slipping into Draco’s mouth, eliciting a soft groan from him.
“Hello, again, Draco,” she said. “Your aura is all over the place tonight, you know. Pink, then silver, then yellow, and now…” she looked around him. “Kind of a dark purple.”
Well. That was one too many. Harry grabbed the lapels of Draco’s posh, perfect tuxedo in his fists and shoved back, trapping him against the wall. “You think this is what I
She was arriving a bit more than fashionably late – three hours late, actually – so the dinner portion of the evening had wrapped up and people were starting to dance. She waved to a few colleagues and then spotted Harry. She was hit, suddenly, with a wave of heavy nostalgia and then mentally slapped herself. It simply wouldn’t do to get all weepy about seeing Harry Potter again.
He didn’t mean to, but it was the shock of a lifetime to open his eyes and find himself faced with an entirely naked Harry Potter.
“This isn’t about
,” Draco said. His face felt hot, and he felt like he might cry, which was fucking ridiculous. He was just high, still, no doubt. Stupid fairy tears. Goddamnit. “I wasn’t sure it was you.”
“You look like you need another. I’ll grab you one.” Then Harry heard Malfoy calling the bartender by name and ordering.
Well, if that didn’t get Harry’s head spinning in very terrible directions. If Malfoy ditched him, what if he never slept again? What if the insomnia came back but even worse?
Draco yelped, but continued on doggedly. “And honestly, how did you live in America for a decade and not make the switch to coffee? Do they even
“You’ve literally
Potter asked William if he was a Senweir. He didn’t have the same distinctive coloring as the other Ethereans, but he had said his mother was from the mountains.
don’t get cheated on, especially with someone like Neville Longbottom!” He looked strangely incensed.
“Yes, saw that, too. What then? Did you get into a fight with Harry about it?”
“Of course you’d be the reason, Harry,” Sarah said, exasperated. “The big race is over. If not for you, he’d be moving on to the next one.”
They made their way down to the kitchen together, and Sarah mixed up a set of Old Fashioneds. It was her signature cocktail, mostly because it was the only one she knew how to make. They were good, though, and Sarah even ran the orange rind over the rim and twisted it over the top of the drink before impaling it on a cocktail pick with a couple of maraschino cherries. Pansy, as usual, made a nuisance of herself, buzzing around Sarah while she mixed, asking her for a dash more bitters and a bit less simple syrup. Sarah only grinned and rolled her eyes, ignoring Pansy’s requests.
“What was he like, last semester?” Harry asked, feeling apprehensive over the answer.
“I was there, when she died. I saw her fall, and I could have cushioned it. I saw Grayback running at her, and I could have stopped him. He was paying zero attention to me, I could’ve stupefied him. Easily. And then, everyone was still fighting, when she was brought back into the Great Hall, so no one was tending to her, but I wasn’t fighting, of course. Because I never did. So I could’ve tried to help her. Could've tried to heal her wounds. But I didn’t. I didn’t even say anything to her, or hold her hand. I just stood back and watched her die.”
Pansy made a garbled sound that was some mixture of a scream and a growl. “I’ll kill him,” she said in a low, threatening voice.
“We’re fine,” said Harry. “But thanks. Good luck with the pickup artist shite. There’s a cute bloke over there by the bar, by the way. He looks promising.”
Scorpius shook his head no. He walked over to Harry and stood right in front of Harry’s chair, and stared at him with his giant eyes. Harry gulped. Merlin, but children were intimidating. What did this look mean? What did he want? Did he need to go to the loo? Was he hungry? Tired? What?
Harry felt a bit like he’d broken in a wild horse or tamed a dragon when he heard Malfoy’s breathing even out, and felt Malfoy's body relax completely, as he slipped off to sleep.
Potter had not joined Draco and Laurel for lessons, but instead had thrown himself fully into physical training. He would spar with anyone who offered in the evenings, or, if no one offered, he would go for runs in the marsh, all the way down to a river, where he would take a bath. The river was, thankfully, much cleaner than one would expect, and Draco had used it to bathe, too.
Abby was Sarah’s ex-girlfriend (of five years), who’d moved to Denver four months ago, and then had promptly met someone else and broken up with Sarah. She’d been devastated.
“Yes. Every single one of them.”
Draco let out a shaking breath. “Harry, I would never hurt you. I mean, I know I have. But I care about you, I – ” he paused, unsure of what he ought to say. “I don’t pretend to know what I’m doing when it comes to you. I never say the right things or do the right things…” He chanced a look up at Harry, who was sitting still, listening.
During negroni number six, they decided to do a performance of DMX’s song ‘Party Up’. They went into Harry’s family room and moved the couch so there was room, and Harry gave them each a spatula to use as a microphone. Pansy took off her tank top so she was in a sports bra and baggy sweatpants, and pulled her hair into a tiny ponytail on top of her head. She spelled her little diamond earrings into giant gold hoops. “Nice,” Harry said. Harry put on a Pudd United baseball cap backwards and thought that was probably good enough.
She smiled, a bit sadly. “I worry he works too hard, sometimes. It consumes him. I hope you’ll try to make sure he has some balance during this whole thing.”
“That he does,” Berold agreed. “That he does.”
, Harry, not my little club girlfriend.
“Too bad. I love a nice, juicy extramarital tryst. Figures you and Ginevra would have a boring demise.”
“I think if I started getting owls here, people would have questions.”
Draco sighed. “Yes, alright. Today.”
, Harry. Fucking fill me up.”
And the damn thing had stuck him with Potter. It just bloody figured, didn’t it?
They sat on opposite sides of the couch and pulled blankets off a pile in the corner and snuggled in with hot toddies that Draco’d made. In the initial scenes of the movie there was a wizard named Gandalf who reminded Harry of Dumbledore so much that it made his stomach hurt. He felt Draco’s eyes flicker towards him once and then again, and he must’ve seen something in Harry’s expression, because suddenly he was putting a pillow on his lap and patting it. “Come here,” he said.
He took a deep breath. “Ernie’s begging for me to get back together with him. He’s taking me to meet his parents and everything. The plan is to let him do it, let him grovel a bit more, and then tell him to bugger off,” he said. “Oh, sorry. Excuse my language.”
“What, you wouldn’t want to marry me?”
They stopped in front of the portrait of the fat lady, and Harry shot him a look before leaning forward and whispering the password. He wasn’t any good at whispering, because Draco heard it loud and clear (it was ‘Fortuna Major’). He decided not to point this out.
“Sectumsempra,” said Harry.
He didn’t really know
“Oh, er, yeah. We were. He could’ve slept in
Dorthea cleared her throat. “Harry says – unequivocally – that he is happy and in love, and Draco says that he is as well.”
Stephens shook his head.
One night there was a knock on the door of the little closet of a bedroom that they’d placed him in, and a moment later, Ginny came in with a bottle of firewhiskey.
Avan was beautiful, he really was, with soft brown hair and soft brown eyes, and a gentle, honest face and a broad, strong body. He’d been sweet with Draco – as sweet as you could be in the stall of a public toilet, anyway. Draco guarded the back of his hand until he got home and could write it down on parchment. He’d stared at the number for days before Pansy went with him to a muggle phone booth to call.
It came, hard against his shoulder. “You wanker! You absolute wanker! He lost interest in me exactly when you defected last spring. Literally the very next day.” She paused. “You fucked around with him, didn’t you?”
“What’s your number, then?” asked Pansy, shooting an appraising look over at Parvati. “You’re gorgeous; it’s probably high.”
“I didn’t think anyone heard that,” Draco said softly.
“I will,” he said, and felt, suddenly, like crying. A part of him didn’t want to leave her side, didn’t want to leave her alone with his father.
“I know,” said Ginny. She looked him over, her warm brown eyes incredibly familiar. He knew all the freckles on her nose, had kissed them all many times. He loved her, still, even if he didn’t want to be with her. Harry had a sticky sort of heart; it didn’t let go of things quickly. “I wanted you to know how sorry I am,” she began.
Draco cleared his throat. “She’s pretty.”
, for Merlin’s sake. He just wanted to be with someone who made him happy. Preferably forever. “Harry with you?”
. Honestly. What the fuck. Harry was having trouble breathing.
Lia was already by the door, talking to the man. She gave a short whistle at Frankie.
“Well. I’m not sure. He’s just…”
“Well, you have to,” Malfoy said, giving him a gentle shove. “Go on. I’m not ready to answer questions about this. And Scorpius will definitely ask them if he realizes you were in here.”
because of nerves? He’d sort of settled on the idea that he would fuck Harry from behind while Evan sucked his cock, because he didn’t think he could handle another bloke actually fucking Harry, but then he’d thought it might be better the other way around, so Draco could make eye contact with Harry, so it could be more intimate between them.
Potter blinked at him. “Er, that’s not what I meant.”
My God, I'm sick of looking out for you
“But, I mean, it worked? Whatever you did to avoid sitting it in the seasoning for two days?”
“I’m not here for like, a lap dance, or whatever? That’s not…I just wanted to talk.”
Harry collapsed back onto Draco and Draco hugged him tighter. “I plan to find out, though. And I plan to fucking annihilate whoever did it.”
, he supposed, although the word made him deeply uncomfortable. ‘Affair’ suggested a tryst, a side-piece, a distraction. If anything, his marriage to Astoria seemed like the affair – something that had interfered with the relationship that he’d intended to center his life around.
– at the bright twin fires of his eyes.
They stumbled into Draco’s bed together and Potter pulled Draco to him, an arm tight around his shoulders. They slept.
“I see. That’s interesting. Well, keep at him, I suppose. Get this finished and come home tomorrow with good news.”
“Yeah,” she said. “I know. Everything seems impossible and pointless, lately. We’re making no progress, not since we got the locket.”
“Ugh, fine,” Potter said, handing Draco his wand.
Potter snorted. “Or making all those Potter Stinks buttons?”
didn’t!” cried Maddy.
“I looked again,” Draco said, smiling that same bitter smile. “I saw a flash of her in the upstairs hallway of Grimmauld Place. In the mirror behind Hermione’s reflection. Not all of her, just a bit. But it’s her.”
She was already shaking her head before he finished. “What if everything is horrible there, too? No. And besides, I belong here in this timeline. You don’t. You’re the one who should go.”
“Thanks,” said Al.
, because Harry didn’t want Draco Malfoy anymore, because fuck him.
Draco sat up and felt his nose. It felt okay, maybe a little tingly. “Did that help?”
“I don’t understand why you have to stay,” said Astoria.
The dark-haired man clears his throat. “Er. Right, so. Partying. All the time, very unhealthy. But
Harry turned towards it and saw that it was Robbie with a couple of their friends, Lauren and Jess. They were making their way over, drinking and dancing already. Robbie looked like he was in good spirits – probably drunk already, if Harry had to guess. Otherwise, he’d be glaring at Harry, or yelling. Glaring
“Humph,” said Ginny.
She sat back and looked at him, her eyes wide and sincere. “But you’re my

“You’re lying. You’re

his men.
Ron and Harry and Dean shook their heads. “Yeah, sure,” said Seamus. Dean looked at him sharply, and Seamus shrugged, then took to it like he actually knew what the fuck he was doing, which Harry knew for a fact he did not.
.” He glanced at Potter, still fully clothed and hard.
“Okay…” Draco said.
“They put something on me. I don’t know what it is. I can’t cast,” Draco said.
On their way out, though, Draco spotted Potter hovering near the Great Hall, looking rather lonely. “Just a minute,” he said to the trio on his heels. They all stumbled to a halt behind him and he rolled his eyes and silently cursed them. He didn’t remember being this annoyed by his sycophants the first time around, but now, they were irritating the hell out of him. Even Pansy, because she wasn’t even acting like herself. Instead she was fawning and saccharine, and he hated every minute of it.
Weezer /
“Good on you,” Harry said, laughing.
“That’s mad, Draco. I’m expected to become an Auror. A lot of people are counting on it. They’d be cross with me if I suddenly changed my mind.”
,” Ernie said. “Not trying to make you feel weird about it or anything, but surely they’d make an exception for you, if you didn’t do as well on your NEWT’s as you’d like.”
Not knowing what else to do, Harry trudged back to his own room.
“Let me wash up a bit,” Draco said. He must be disgusting – he’d been on the road, then Mending wounded soldiers, then passed out for three days. Frankie rolled her eyes. “At least let me splash a little water on my face and put on a new tunic,” said Draco. “Oh, and Harry’s coming with me to talk to William.”
it had been said, Harry could see that they’d both been thrown and full of nerves. Some of it probably stemmed from the fact that it had literally been the second civilized conversation they’d had in their entire lives. The first had been the summer after the war, immediately following Narcissa Malfoy’s trial. Her sentence had been read, and she’d been carted off by Aurors to Azkaban to serve out her six months (which really wasn’t all that long, but Harry knew, just looking at her, that she would have an extremely hard time of it).
Days kept passing, as days do, and Draco finally returned to pub night in mid-September. He kept his eyes away from the Auror booth – for the most part, anyway.
“Dumbledore.”
Nobody, baby (nobody)
,” he whispered, and Harry realized Draco was already half hard again. Harry reached down and took Draco in hand for a moment while Charlie kissed the side of Harry’s neck, and then Draco was turning around and spreading for him, and Harry saw that his arse was leaking from Charlie’s come and it looked so good that he almost couldn’t stand it. Harry ran his fingers over the mess, over Draco’s wet, red, leaking hole, and Draco sighed and arched up into his touch. He lined himself up and then he was sliding in, and Draco was so open already, and he was fucking into him just like Charlie just had, and it was so slick and hot and good. He reached around and gently fisted Draco’s cock, and Charlie was kissing all over his back and he felt Charlie hardening again against him.
Damnit. So, they would have six, then. It would be on McGonagall, and Draco started running through all the reasons she had to vote no. One, she was a Gryffindor. They were all rather house proud. She loved Gryffindor. She still wore Gryffindor scarves to Quidditch matches. Two, she had a very low opinion of Slytherins. She might very well want to keep them separated into houses so that she could keep an eye on them. Three, she seemed the sort to adhere to tradition just because it was tradition.
Harry was gone, suddenly, and Draco didn’t dare open his eyes. He was afraid it would all disappear. There was a splash at the other end of the tub, and then Harry’s body was pressing against Draco’s and the water was lapping against them, agitated from the movement Harry had made.
“You made me sound like some sort of monster, for Salazar’s sake!” Theo hissed, and Draco wanted to slap him for showing his vulnerabilities so willingly.
“I occasionally go overboard with research,” she said with the hint of a self-deprecating smile, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “How about you? Did you find anything?”
“Albus Potter,
Ron toyed with a strand of Pansy’s hair. “She’s feisty, Harry. I don’t know if you know this about Pansy.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. But that wasn’t true. “I’m not sorry, though, really. Cassius isn’t fit to lick your shoe.”
“It’s okay, you know,” Draco said, running a gentle hand over Harry’s hair and very obviously trying not to laugh. “I think all the shit you shoved down all those years is just, like, finding it’s way to the surface. Either that, or I’m a really, really good fuck.”
Then they were in a long, narrow space, lights flashing, bodies everywhere. There were no tables here, only one massive bar that stretched across one side of the room, and the space looked, well, like a tunnel. A tunnel that just happened to be hosting the best party of all time.
“Just…talk to Draco. Or no, talk to Charlie. Or no, Draco. Fuck. Okay, definitely talk to Draco. I’ll talk to Charlie.”
Who will fight?
The rest of the morning was Potter-free, but Draco encountered him again in Potions after lunch. Potter set up his cauldron directly behind Draco, and Draco felt the other boy’s eyes fixed on him throughout the class. Every time Draco reached for something or walked to the supply cabinet or to another table, he saw Potter’s head jerk up, saw him start to trace Draco’s movements again.
And then his heart was beating so fast he thought he might have to go to Madam Pomfrey, because it hurt, almost, it was pounding so hard, and his body felt numb and pressed in on all sides. Trapped; he felt trapped. He didn’t know if Blaise was there, so he didn’t want to leave his bed, and Merlin forbid he accidentally encounter Blaise
Harry left for Maine the day after Christmas. Ari was visiting family, and Harry didn’t want to go with anyone anyway. He wanted time to think.
Potter nodded again. “Okay. But now I’m going to take a piss, because my bladder is going to burst otherwise.”
“No, actually. I got lost in your poncy palace of a house and wandered in here by mistake,” Harry replied.
“How are you?” asked Harry. “Did you get hurt?”
On the front step was a completely lovely man, soft and sensual, with a mop of curly, brown-gold hair and big brown eyes. He looked over at Draco and sort of made a low growl in his throat. “Who the fuck is that, Harry?”
“Done what?” asked Seamus.
“Does Lubec even have a grocery store?” Linda had asked tiredly.
Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby I can't stop it
“Okay,” Ernie said. “So…how are you?”
That God blessed the broken road
“You do?” Potter said, looking surprised.
Thankfully, the lot of them settled into the next booth over.
“Erm, scotch? Always wanted to be the sort who drinks scotch.”
He chugged his lager and called for another one. “I’m glad you and Hermione are okay,” he said, sighing. “If you two got divorced, I might have to give up completely.”
I keep trying to find me
are you alright? Because you look like you might throw up. Did you and Potter have a little lovers’ quarrel or something?”
And then he disapparated, and Harry was left alone. He spun around to face the cottage. It looked utterly ordinary, not a thing out of place. Harry’s heart was pounding anyway. He made his way to the front door and turned the knob. They never locked it, of course; there was no reason to lock a door here in the middle of the woods.
“Are you getting revenge on my clothing or something, Potter? Now I’m down a robe
your cock? It’s so pretty I can hardly stand it.”
Draco thought Farley might have muttered ‘traitor’ under his breath as he recorded the vote of his fellow Gryffindor. Draco was just waiting now, because he knew how the rest of the votes would go.
But Draco was his friend, not his lover. Draco couldn’t be anything more than a friend. Not now, maybe not ever.
“Poor Potter. You just want everyone to live happily ever after, don’t you? Me, Weasley, Hermione. Everyone.”
smelled amazing, sort of like oranges with a bite of almost peppery sharpness. Did Draco sniff all the bottles at the store or salon or wherever he found these? How did one go about selecting such things?
Potter had frozen underneath him, too. “Um,” he said.
“At some point, we’re going to see you when we’re not at work, you know,” Seamus added. “I’m not always going to be holding him back.”
“He is. Because Pansy knows a lot of fun spells at this point in her Auror career, and Potter does not want to be on the receiving end of any of them. Trust me.”
, Harry. I’m different here. I don’t have all of that…that history with everyone. With you. It’s different. I understood that, and I understood why you said what you said, even if I didn’t like it.”
We both know how it feels
“Ernie broke up with me at lunch. He couldn’t wait all day to do it, I guess. Had to grab the bull by the horns or whatever the fuck that stupid American saying is.”
Hermione sighed and pointed her wand up at the ceiling and basically exploded the smoke alarm, which did, in fact, make the deafening noise stop. They all stood still in the aftermath and looked at each other, the downpour of the storm and the clap of thunder audible once more.
“I’m fine,” Draco said. “My life wasn’t on the line today, though; yours was. I’m glad you’re okay, by the way. How are you feeling?”
He was feeling quite drunk, like his wanderings had made the alcohol circulate that much faster. He flushed and washed his hands with fancy hand soap and put on some of the fancy lotion that was there, too. There was a gilded box on the sink with little red and green hand towels, all spotless and soft and rolled into neat little tubes, and a basket beneath for the used ones. Who the fuck washed all these towels? He figured there were multiple loos, probably a hundred loos, and every guest used a new towel every time, which meant…well, he didn’t have a clue how many that would be, but it would be a

“She’s mad. It’s the ginger thing, obviously. You know they don’t have souls, right? Gingers?”
you not to come with, but Draco Sodding Malfoy never listens to anyone, does he? If you had stayed back, none of this would’ve happened.” Weasley shot up off the couch and stalked over to the window. After a moment, he spoke, his voice quietly furious. “Get the fuck out of here. I can’t even look at you.”
“I always despised him,” said Pansy. “He has a smarmy face.”
As he hurried through the lobby with Astoria, Nott’s voice projecting through the televisions in the lobby that were streaming live from the auditorium, Harry’s hands clenched into fists. Nott was going to pay for this. And if he hurt Draco in any way, he would pay with his life.
Draco and Charlie grab drinks. Things go well until Harry shows up.
“Right, right. No, of course. Sorry. Go on, you were Googling…”
Oh, shit. Draco had gotten so wrapped up in Hermione’s analysis of Harry’s feelings that he’d forgotten the purpose of this whole conversation. “Right,” he began. “So that Saturday, after Harry left…I was a bit upset. Scratch that. I was really upset. And I went out with Pansy, because that’s how I tend to cope with things, and I got pissed, and then I ended up going to the Ministry at two or three in the morning, thinking I’d do some work since I wasn’t going to be able to sleep. And instead, I found myself peeking into Clarke’s office, and, ah, the Time-Turner…well, it was sitting there, under his desk.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know that I
“Bed,” Draco whispered, pushing at Harry without breaking the kiss.
Harry shrugged and kept his eyes on Draco, which made Draco soften towards Pansy just a little.
“When you came to Chicago, you told me that you loved Astoria,” Harry said, aching at the memory of that conversation. “You said that you’d found happiness with her and that you loved her.”
Frankie threw Berold a look. “We’re going to retrieve him, aren’t we? We’re going to find William and bring him back.”
But still, he needed to try. “I wish I was a better person,” he said, wondering how he’d landed on that. “I wish I’d done the right things. I wish I hadn’t said all those things I used to say to you, to Hermione. I wish I’d been a friend to you instead, back then. I wish I’d never taken the Mark or worked on the Vanishing Cabinet. I wish I’d never done any of it. But I did, and I know…I know you’ll never understand why. Because you – you don’t think that way. You’re not selfish the way I am. You don’t –”
“Can’t go wrong,” Draco said, picking up one of his own. “Cheers.”
pretend boyfriend,” Draco said softly, his lips brushing against Harry’s skin. Harry braced himself, felt his eyes flutter closed, because oh fuck, oh fuck, there was no way he was turning this down, not when Draco looked like
“Indeed,” Draco said. Several days ago, Pansy had surprised him with a Portkey to Aruba, where they would be staying for three nights, starting tomorrow. She said they needed a break from real life, needed to lounge and drink and dance their cares away for a while (and possibly fuck them away, she’d said, to which Draco had replied, “
Draco sat down on the edge of the bed – his bed, Harry remembered, wondering if he ought to feel embarrassed for coming in here. It had made sense last night, when he was half asleep and the world was dark, but now, in the light of morning, he felt uncertain.
There was a note in the (admittedly, very nice) kitchen. They were in Lubec, Maine, in a rental house on the Atlantic Ocean, only minutes away from the Canadian border. Their nearest neighbor was seven miles away, the actual town of Lubec even further. There was five feet of snow on the ground. There was no way to apparate out of the house (Pansy’s doing), and though there were return Portkeys, they would not work for three more days. There was no internet and no cell service. Draco wasn’t sure whether that was Pansy’s work as well, or whether that was merely due to the isolated location.
: I may not believe in God anymore (or like country music ever since Bro Country took over, ew), but I still believe that our lives are fuller, better, and brighter when we find someone who sees us fully and loves us anyway. And I still believe love is possible for everyone, regardless of our pasts, our fears, our bruises, our shortcomings. Love is love is love. I hope you find it, dear reader (if you haven't already), and I hope it's everything you ever wanted.
A few days later, after Pansy had very stubbornly and uncharacteristically refused to say whether she and Luna had slept together, Draco asked the same thing. “I thought you strictly into blokes,” he said.
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Draco closed his eyes, feeling stupid. He let himself open up to everything in the room around him, and then tried to focus on the energy there. He did his best to drown out the sounds, the mugginess of the air around him, the smells of herbs and roasted venison and freshly-baked bread. He tried to think of what magic felt like. It felt, usually, like heat. He thought about what Potter’s magic always felt like when he cast, a pulsing explosion of fire without flame. That kind of magic, that feeling of heat-power, was missing here, he realized now that he was looking for it. He could hardly believe he hadn't noticed before, but he couldn't sense it anywhere around him.
William shrugged and made a face. “Not especially. But that’s all right. When would I have time for  romance anyway? I’ll have a kingdom to run.” William tilted his head and looked closely at Draco. “Unless it’s you.”
Draco's eyes opened reluctantly, and he fixed his gaze on the cool, dreamy blue of his bedroom walls. He’d shower - ugh, did he ever need a shower - and then he’d go to the office, finish up his work on the chest of drawers the department received last week.
Suddenly, though, something caught his eye. Something underneath Clarke’s disaster of a desk, glinting silver in the light of Draco’s wand. He bent down to take a look. There was a musky-smelling set of robes on top of whatever it was, and only a sliver of metal was peeking through. Lip curled, Draco moved the robes aside with his wand.
“I understand,” Granger said.
“You’re such a swot,” he said, smiling back at her.
“It’s the nerdiness, I think. Absolute dorks, the two of us.”
“I’m sure, Draco. I’m sure.”
“It’s true,” she said, putting her hand on the back of his. “And I’ll always love you for it.”
Harry smiled at him for a moment before facing the ceiling again. “Well, thank Merlin we’re alright. We fought a mountain troll and won. Kind of impressive, really.”
“Oh, ye of little faith,” said Potter with an indulgent smile, and an instant later, sleep came, dragging him off kicking and screaming – at least in his mind. In reality, he probably just passed out uneventfully.
He looked so good Harry wanted to
“You’re mine,” Harry said, biting at his throat.
“Yeah,” Harry said, looking over at him. “And also, I love you.”
“The usual. Sides were chosen, battles were waged, blood was shed,” said Harry.
“Yes,” said Harry, kissing a trail down his chest. “Turn over.”
It was hardly surprising that for a long time, he’d barely thought of what he’d seen and felt in those brief moments before he'd come back.
“It’s not Potter,” Draco said, and then took down half his pint in one long, monstrous swig.
“Okay,” said Harry.
That had been an awful day, Draco heavy with the awareness of Harry, so close and yet worlds away, so handsome in his tuxedo. Merlin, he’d had the saddest wank of all time in the shower that night after Astoria fell asleep, memories of Harry flooding through him, making him feel caught up in it all again, making him ache with want. He’d come hard, and then collapsed immediately, curling in on himself on the floor of the bathtub while the hot water crashed down on him, getting cooler and cooler while he cried.
“Yeah, well, he’s gotten rather fit,” Harry said.
why –”
He would go back there, then. To the dark days of being the Dark Lord’s bitch, back to the scene of Harry’s Sectumsempra. He’d give it one more go, and if it didn’t work this time, he’d accept the way things were here. He’d accept this life. He’d get up and go to work and go out with Pansy on the weekends. He’d go out on another date with Charlie and try to carry on as best he could.
“Good,” said Potter, slightly mollified.
generally loyal, though, those Fastbrooks. Ari’s never cheated on his girlfriend so far as I know, and except for the getting herself pregnant thing, Lyris never cheats. I don’t think Euri would be a cheater either,” said Pansy.
But Draco hadn’t had the upper hand, as it turned out. Because Ernie didn’t care enough about him to introduce him to his parents. He didn’t seem to be pained over their breakup, either. It made Draco feel like, suddenly, he was the desperate one. The one who had been loved less. It made him feel rather unworthy of love altogether.
“Of course you don’t. Merlin. Okay, why don’t you come in and sit down.”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe because it’s
“I don’t – I don’t know,” Harry managed.
Hermione was grinning when Harry clicked his phone closed. “So you got a cell phone just to talk to Draco Malfoy. And now you talk to him every day? I mean, seriously, Harry, there are hundreds of texts in there. And they’re very friendly. Teasing. A bit…flirty.”
“That was really close to Daphne’s place. The one she shared with Millie.”
“I don’t hate you,” Harry said in a rather mumble-y, embarrassed voice.
Frankie was pulling at it, and Draco felt it yank at his hair a bit, but once more, it didn’t come off. “You have no idea what this is?” she asked, and Draco shook his head.
“Huh,” said Pansy. “I guess that’s okay then. Want to go to mine?”
He’d thought maybe he could make it work, with Robbie, but then after a couple of months, he'd felt the same old restlessness, the same feeling of suffocation that he always felt in relationships. Robbie's touch stopped turning him on and seemed to drag the air from his lungs instead. Holding Robbie’s hand began to feel like a prison sentence. And then, Harry found himself starting to pick apart everything Robbie did, and getting irritated for no reason.
“How are you getting there?”
,” he whispered.
Harry cried out softly, closing his eyes tight.
“See!” cried Frankie, clapping like mad even as a chorus of ‘boos’ filled the space.
Harry gasped. “You’re a traitor, Euripides. How dare you.”
“I’m not going to have sex with you,” Harry said, suddenly. Because he wasn’t. This was good, and he wanted it, but he wasn’t going to lose his virginity tonight. That, he decided, he wanted to be with someone special. Someone that he did love, or could love, or something along those lines. Not because that’s what you were supposed to do, but because that was what he wanted to do. He wanted it to be that way.
one, as a quest to preserve their way of life, to protect wizardkind, to save them.
“I want to go to Nepal someday,” Harry said, glancing at him. “To the mountains. And I want to see Petra, and Machu Picchu, and Cappadocia. Other places, too, but those are at the top of my list.”
“What?” he asked. “What happened?”
The closet door swung open, and they both looked over towards it and were greeted by Luna’s beatific smile. “Oh, hi, you two,” she said brightly. “I was wondering where you’d gone off to. Don't mind me, just grabbing my coat.”
What he didn’t expect was for her to start laughing, rather loudly.
“It’s not like that,” said Malfoy. “It’s…it’s just for appearances, really. It’s expected of him, to have a wife. I understand, of course. I would’ve done the same thing had I stayed where I was, you know, in Malfoy Manor. I’d have married a woman and carried on with someone, probably.”
“It was a hurting tune, resigned, a cry of heartache for all in the world that fell apart. As ash rose black against the brilliant sky, Fire's fiddle cried out for the dead, and for the living who stay behind to say goodbye.”
“Because I love you, too,” Draco said, tracing Harry’s smile with his fingers. “If you didn’t know.”
“Can you keep your mouth shut, Potter? Because I’m going to kill you if you spoil the surprise.”
And another part of him couldn’t stand the sight of her. It was her very existence that made Harry run. It was this marriage. And Draco’d never wanted it, not really, and that wasn’t her fault, but it still made him furious at times, that he had this albatross around his neck, that he was not free, could not pursue what he really wanted because he was bound to her. He resented her. He resented all of it.
Harry looked around Draco’s with the same sort of awe, playing with toy after toy. Admittedly, Draco had plenty. After Harry finally tired of his exploration, they played a round of Exploding Snap, and then Draco’s mother knocked. “Boys,” she said. “The guests will be here soon. You’d better dress.” She shut the door quietly behind her.
“You’re good at it. You’re fucking –
Potter looked over at him. “Yeah. Of course.”
Harry decided to drop it. Whatever Ron had going on in his head, Harry didn’t think he was the sort to ever do anything to hurt Hermione. So if he was
It took a moment for Draco’s eyes to adjust, and he realized it was the blond soldier girl, Lia. “I thought I told you to be careful,” she said when she recognized him.
He’d expected her to fall apart at that, or at least flinch or look at him in horror. Instead, she lifted her head. “Tonight?”
Malfoy leaned over him, his eyes bright. “You were the one who started banishing clothing. Talk about escalation.”
She smiled, slow and mischievous. “Want to help me test them out? I could try digging them into your back, if you want.”
Those were all things that made Harry incredibly uncomfortable, but Draco’d known most of them already and liked Harry anyway. And he’d never treated Harry preciously because of them, which was key, because Harry hated nothing more than being treated like he was breakable. No, Draco dealt with Harry’s idiosyncrasies in a no-nonsense way, even got Harry to laugh about them or shared an experience that had been similar, and it always ended up being no big deal.
“You know…” Charlie scooted closer to the tub and looked Harry in the eyes. “I think you might be lonely. You ever consider that?”
A weekend's worth of tension comes to a...er...head.
No, no, no, he scolded himself. He couldn’t think that way. He couldn’t, or he would fall apart. Harry was alive. Harry could be rescued. And he was going to rescue him, and everything would be fine.
sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”
The seeds of a pear tree
“I think I need to find her. Before we go. I think she can help.”
“I already heard what happened. It’s…whatever. It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.”
Draco stuck out his bottom lip.
“Weasley?” he said.
“Ugh, fine. I’ll try. I’m not guaranteeing that it’ll work, though.” Ari stood up, running a hand through his curls. He looked tired, too, like someone had been keeping him up at night.
“Oh,” she said, patting his arm. “You know I won’t. Doesn’t mean I don’t want to, though.”
“Career?” Harry asked, confused. Pansy wasn’t planning on becoming, like, an
“Merlin’s saggy balls, Pans, are you
wrong with that. Maybe you could’ve helped Lavender, but maybe you couldn’t have. And maybe trying to help her would’ve just ended up getting you killed.”
Potter was listening intently, and he nodded when Draco finished. “I always felt like I knew you, too. I didn’t, of course, but yeah. I was
“You were exactly right,” she said. “Down to the man.”
“Okay…” Ernie said, frowning.
Then he told her about the second alternate timeline, where he’d refused to speak against Hagrid over the Hippogriff incident, and had become friends with Harry then, in third year. And then, that he and Harry, by sixth year, had been unquestionably together, and Draco had spent all his time in the Gryffindor tower, and all the Slytherins hated Draco, but he and Hermione had worked on Alchemy together. And how, still, in the end, Harry had been dead once more, and they’d been preparing to speak at a memorial service for him. He told her how he’d gotten into a fight with Ron over it, because Ron blamed him.
Ilana didn’t look disturbed by any of it. She only sighed. “I’m sure you mean that you wanted to meet my sister. Thera was the brave one. The striking one. The one people loved.”
“I plan to stay here with you tonight, if that’s fine by you,” Ron said. “’Moine said it’s okay.”
“Are you okay with that?” Harry asked.
He looked over at the sleeping form next to him. Potter hadn’t moved an inch and his breathing was deep and even, his lips parted gently. Had Draco kissed those lips? If Potter was naked, it stood to reason that they’d kissed. Just the thought of it made him his insides go soft and molten.
“I never made you a drink,” Draco said. “You want one?”
Draco thought back to the day he and Potter had painted that room a bright (rather gauche, in Draco’s opinion) blue. Draco’d chided Potter for refusing to have Kreacher paint it, and, even more maddeningly, refusing to use magic. No, Potter’d wanted to do it by hand, with rollers and brushes, and so Draco’d agreed to help, whining the entire time. They’d eaten pizza on the floor that evening after they finished, sitting atop the plastic tarps that were spread out to protect the wood, and had slugged down firewhiskey straight from the bottle, probably in an attempt to show off for one another.
“It certainly seemed

Miami, Florida, was a fun place. Harry had eaten tacos before, sure, but never tacos like
“Yes, it’s good. It’s so good, Harry,” Draco breathed, biting down on Harry’s lip.
Harry stood and Draco rather forcefully grabbed his hand and put it at his waist, and then took Harry’s other hand. “You do know how to Foxtrot, yes?”
“Hardly. I apparated,” Charlie said.
bad side than the Dark Lord’s, I’ll tell you that.”
“I’m Alaric –” Draco began, and Potter started laughing.
– and he was
Harry looked away. “No. Not really,” he said.
He downed his shot and ambled over to Ron, who was gazing adoringly at a shot witch's arse as she leaned over a booth to hand out drinks. “Ronald
“Because things are different there. For me. For you. Because you couldn’t be with me at home, because of how things were. And, I don’t know, because of how all your friends would feel about it. Because of how
“Check on the dinner rolls, would you?” Draco said, not glancing over at him.
Then he just wished that he could stop loving Draco Malfoy, once and for all.
“Well, you are far from Septerra, I suppose. She’s managed to create an army of the things to protect the capital city. If you go close enough, you will hear the people speak of them. William knows about them, no doubt. But he keeps news of her victories quiet from his men, in case you haven’t noticed.”
“Depressing, yet lucrative,” Malfoy said, tipping back in his chair. “I’ve been damn close every time, except for Daphne’s. I’ve made a killing.”
Harry stomped back over and took Malfoy’s shirt in his fists and yanked him to his feet.
“Oh, right, I didn’t think about that.” She studied his face for a moment. “You must be in knots over it.”
He went through the events of that day in his head. The golden trio had been brought in, bruised and battered, and Harry had been glamoured. He’d looked strange, but Draco had somehow still recognized him. He supposed when you stared at someone every day for six years, you could spot them pretty easily, despite a half-arsed glamour.
“I’m not even kidding, Potter. Your pectorals are stupendous. They’ll probably stretch my jumper right out. They’re just so powerful.”
Harry laughed. Ralston seemed like a bit of an arrogant twat.
,” she said.
“Ah, an Abbott. A fine family. And I am glad to see the young ones are abiding by the old ways. The last generation of Potters believed themselves to be far too modern and sophisticated for such things.” He scanned the chairs and cast a glare at Harry’s father. “Humph. Who is it then? I see Blacks around me, and…oh, Malfoys! Greetings, Serendipita!” he called, looking over at a beautiful blond woman in an elaborate silvery gown. Serendipita gave a flirty little wave and the woman next to Ralston, presumably his wife, elbowed him in the ribs.
“You all live near here, then? Is that part true?”
He managed to make his way back to Euri, who wrapped an arm around his waist, setting his curly head on Harry’s shoulder. “Harry?” Euri said, pulling away to look at him. “You’re shaking.”
Draco tried not to smile. “So, I’m your friend, then, am I?”
He was so busy stomping that he almost missed the flash of white from behind one of the enormous trees. He stilled and looked.
“Is it because I’m another man? Or because of my age?”
“It’s nice,” said Draco. “Your family’s rather lovely, Ginny.”
One morning, when Potter was sauntering into their room clad in his towel, Draco didn’t pretend he wasn’t paying attention. He leaned back against his desk as Potter went through his usual routine of toweling off, arms folded across his chest, letting himself enjoy the sight of Potter’s arse for once.
When Draco drew back again, he met Harry’s eyes. Harry was looking at him with such bruising tenderness that it almost broke him, but Draco steeled himself and looked back at Dolohov. “Happy?” he ground out.
blurting them out immediately. But even though he always seemed to voice his thoughts, no matter how strange or vulnerable they were, Draco still didn’t understand them. There was no way anyone was this unassuming and…well…
“You’re a bit of a fucker, you know that?” Draco said.
He thought about Potter, about their short exchange last night. Merln, Draco’d acted like a complete arsehole. He’d hardly meant to, but he had. He tried to imagine how he’d have reacted if the roles had been reversed, and it made him sick to even think about it. At this point, the thought of Potter with anyone else made him want to vomit. And he’d let Potter believe that something had happened between him and William. Or at least, he hadn’t reassured him that nothing had. If Potter felt even a fraction of what Draco felt, he had to be furious.
When they were done, Harry was worn-out and quite dusty and a little sore. They headed inside, and Harry didn’t know what the plan was from that point, but when Malfoy asked Mitsy the house elf to add four guests for dinner, Harry figured it out pretty quickly. “What about your date with Euri?” Harry asked with a smirk.
“Jesus.”
Draco’s rapid-fire, gasping breaths slowed bit by bit, until they were almost normal. “Has that ever happened before?” Harry said softly, still holding him.
“Yeah,” said Harry, letting out a breath. “Probably.”
the same, Pansy,” he said.
“Because the leaders of the Etherean Council believe the Ethereans should stay out of our wars. They encourage isolation in the mountains. I suppose it makes sense if you consider all the wrong that has been done to them. I don’t really blame them for wanting nothing to do with us.”
Malfoy scowled. “Not that it’s any of your business whatsoever. But, no.” He looked at Harry’s face directly, his silvery eyes fixed on Harry’s green ones. “You? I suppose you always do.”
He tried slowing down even more, sort of a slow-motion sprint, and this, he was able to keep up for four laps before he collapsed into a heap.
Harry shook his head like he was clearing it. “I can,” he said, and stepped through.
“S’okay,” Harry said, and took his hand “Well? What now?”
He heard a voice at the floo and sighed. Probably Blaise, bitching about Draco not coming tonight. He stood and slowly made his way over, an agitated scowl on his face. But before he could squat down in front of the flames, a body was hurtling out of them and running smack into him, knocking him down.
Harry stilled. “Oh,” he said.
Draco wakes and talks to Harry and then William. Then Harry again.
Harry sighed. “Look, you were drunk. I’m not saying that makes it okay, but I get it. I acted basically the same way when I was pissed at the Christmas Eve party. I’m not upset about it. I swear I’m not.” He hadn’t loved the way Draco’d given him shit for going to a Mind Healer, but he’d written that off as drunk-talk. And as far as the way Draco had looked at him after that, and the way he’d touched him, and the way he’d kissed him…Harry was just generally trying not to think too much about that at all. Because thinking about that led to thinking about all sorts of things that he was trying not to think about, which included basically anything to do with Draco.
, Draco told himself – safe.
“Hey, Draco, look,” Vincent said, elbowing him.
She sat down in her own seat and took a dainty sip of her tea. “Don’t be. You were together for a long time. It’s natural to mourn the loss of him.” She gave him a little smile. “He was rather boring, though.”
“How do you know?” he asked.
She nodded enthusiastically, her hair bouncing across her shoulders. “Would you like help? With your research, I mean? I’ve got to finish this memorandum for Unspeakable Clarke, but after I’m done, I could give you a hand.”
“That’s true,” Ari said. “I certainly have. But it’s been twelve years or something since the war. I’m sure you haven’t been sitting around doing nothing since then.”
Draco knew how that felt. From the moment he realized he was bent, he’d known the same damn thing. He would marry for a name, for wealth that might add to the Malfoy fortune. He would marry for blood purity and for political alliances. But not for love. That was never going to happen. But he wasn’t going to think about his own predicament here, in this completely separate world. He’d consider it when he went home, perhaps. “You shouldn’t have to marry her. Could you not act as her Regent instead?”
“Well…” Hermione said. “I mean…”
“That sounds like it might strike the right balance,” Tony said thoughtfully. “Harry, you comfortable with that?”
“Hey,” Ari said, peering over at him again. “You and Harry are old friends. Mind if I ask you something?”
He left work early to go home and tidy up for Albus and Lily’s visit. He got them every other weekend, which was not nearly enough, but also totally overwhelming when it happened. James was away at school, so Harry only saw him in the summer and at Christmas.
“No, but they don’t
Euri opened the door and his blue eyes widened in surprise. “What the hell happened in here?” he asked.
“I missed you, too,” Harry said, feeling tears prick the back of his closed eyelids. It wasn’t fair, that they shouldn’t get to have this. How could anything this perfect be wrong? Why had this not worked? It should’ve worked. “God, Draco,” he breathed, wrapping his legs around Draco’s hips and capturing Draco’s mouth with his once again. “It’s never been like this with anyone else. It’s never felt like this.”
“I’m sure,” she said.
Although...maybe he
“Not too much, I hope,” said Draco, looking over at him. Harry saw Draco’s glance flit over his body, and he smiled. Pansy had told him the other week that Draco thought he had sexy calves, so Harry’d worn shorts today.
, Draco told Pike.
Don’t put that on him.”
Draco could almost picture it then, the two of them side-by-side, being measured for first-year robes. He couldn’t recall it as clearly as the incident on the train, and he couldn’t remember exactly what he’d said. But he’d been pleasant, hadn’t he? Maybe he hadn’t been
Linda liked to get up early in the mornings to go for a walk. She’d wake up and put on a thick sweater and jeans and a hat with a wide brim and her hiking shoes and go putzing around the peninsula while the sun was just coming up. They had no close neighbors (their property was enormous), so Linda never expected to see anyone. One morning, though, she heard something in the trees behind her. She whirled around, and there, staring at her, was a huge cat.
“Oi, Harry,” said Ginny, wrinkling her nose. “Too weird. Go sit somewhere else.”
“Absolutely not,” Sarah said. “I adore the rest of your body just as much. And I guess your personality's alright, too.”
Harry felt like the world’s biggest arsehole, but something about Malfoy’s encouraging demeanor was making him want to try. Just to please him. So Harry tried.
“Thank you, Captain Obvious,” muttered Draco.
Draco made himself stop thinking. Made himself stop doing anything but watching Harry’s breath. In and out. In and out. Slow. He matched it, sort of. The gasps were interfering. But eventually they smoothed themselves out, and Draco was breathing, nice and slow, in and out.
“Get out!” cries the man.
A moment later, she stepped through and peered at him. She was dressed to go out, in a horrifically short skirt and a tight blouse. Probably going to go steal somebody’s husband. She had made it a point to stop by every single day that week and pester Harry.
The next hour or so passed quickly. Ernie whispered to Harry that he was going to ask Daphne if she wanted to go to Hogsmede with him the next day, and then, later, when he was sitting on one of the couches with Daphne, he caught Harry’s eye and gave him a grin and a thumbs up. Dean and Seamus brought out a deck of cards and a few people started playing some game that involved lots of drinking. Hannah put on some music and she and Mandy and Parvati and Katie Bell started dancing. Just when it appeared that none of the boys were brave enough to join them, Neville jumped in and spun Mandy around, making her giggle, and then danced like such a goof that a few other guys, who must've decided that at least they'd look better than Neville, began dancing, too.
He smiled, that same tight, false smile. “I always land on my feet, don’t I?”
about traveling a lot, and bought a bunch of those books. I wish there was a muggle bookshop near Hogsmeade.”
When Pansy slid out of his bed in the morning in her short pajama shorts, Blaise, who was already awake, whistled. Pansy gave him a couple fingers for his trouble and sauntered out of the room. She knew Draco was gay by this point, but nobody else really did. That included Blaise, who'd exchanged a hand job or two with Draco in their fifth and sixth years. The other boys seemed to assume that Draco's reasons for engaging in those sorts of illicit activities were the same as their own, that he'd merely done it out of boredom and his inexhaustible teenage hormones. He'd never had a conversation with any of them about his preferences until well after their Hogwarts years. To their credit, though, when Draco finally did tell them (struggling with more than a little anxiety leading up to the telling), none of them had given a fig about it, and had seemed almost insulted that he'd felt the need to explain himself to them. You might accuse Slytherins of many things, but being judgmental about sex was not one of them.
Draco looked up at him in surprise. “Um, no. Not. Ah. No.”
“Yay,” Serendipita Fyce said, tilting up her chin.
“Hell no,” said Harry, still giggling.
“Don’t take too long,” Draco called after him. “Or you’re not getting any! Once I go to sleep, that’s it!” That was a lie, probably, but Draco
“So, what’s going on between you two?” Weasley asked. “Are you friends again? Is everything okay?”
Travers thought about this. “Mm. Might have a point there,” he said, reluctantly.
, though? In what sense?”
Zabini looked angry, suddenly. “I know that for you, this has been a delightful experience, but not all of us can decide that we’re bent and go skipping through the halls singing about it to everyone who will listen the next day.”
! She knows exactly what she’s doing, and so do you, so don’t play Mr. Innocent with me! I’ve known you too long, Draco Malfoy. I know how you work.” She took a deep breath, still bouncing on the balls of her feet. Nothing got Pansy worked up like high drama. “Which Weasel is this, anyway?”
“Salazar’s spunk, Potter, what did you do?”
Harry laughed. “You know, I was maybe out of line. Don’t be mad at your dad.” He absolutely wasn’t out of line, he was trying to be
“It tastes wonderful,” Draco protested. “Haven’t you ever heard of a gin and tonic?”
“Mmm, yeah,” said Harry, working his hand at the bottom of Draco’s shaft while his mouth swallowed up the rest.
“Okay,” Draco said, taking it.
Well, if that wasn’t the weirdest fucking thing ever. And weirder still, it made Draco feel sort of…good, to hear it. “Fine, you idiot. If it’ll shut you up.”
“Sorry,” Draco said when he’d gone.
“Oh, god.”
He looked over at the weight machines skeptically. They were made of cracked leather and rusty metal, and looked like they’d malfunction immediately and kill you.
“Yes, they looked very good on you,” Harry said earnestly, casting a wandless lubrication spell. Draco’s eyes widened.
“Oh, right,” said Draco, grinning. “Makes sense.”
How dare he? How dare he come in here with his fumbling words and trembling hands and expect everything to be
Harry felt like the floor was shifting under his feet. “Oh. Erm. Why do you think so?”
“Potter, please. Would you allow yourself to be stranded here on this godforsaken hill just because it was dangerous?”
“I’m fine,” he said, grinding his teeth. “Go back to bed.”
Harry felt his sleepy cock stirring. “Can we move onto slamming?”
“I came as soon as you called. I would have stayed there the whole night if you’d asked. I came every day until you kicked me out of your house. I don’t know what else I could have possibly done,” Draco said. He didn’t sound angry; he sounded tired.
“No, no, stop being dramatic. I had a huge crush on him. Isn’t that so funny? He’s fit, though, you have to admit. But I had a crush on him, so of course I wanted to –”
“Lia thinks they don’t exist anymore. But I saw one, when I was here.”
Draco huffed a laugh and tried not to dwell. “Unfortunately, yes,” he said. “You’re Laurel. Leader of the Foxes.”
fucking tell me the next time you break up with somebody? For Salazar’s sake, Harry, you have got to work on your communication skills. I emphatically do not want to have a Round Three of Harry Not Telling Draco About the Demise of a Significant Relationship.”
Harry nodded. “Why d’you think that is? With me and you?”
Their hands shifted slightly, the grip softening, and Draco let go of one so that he could touch Potter’s cheek. Gently, the way that Potter had been touching him when he’d thought Draco was asleep. Potter closed his eyes and leaned into it. “Look at me,” Draco said, his voice low and rough. “Please.”
“Er, yeah. I came to talk to you, actually, Ron. Was having one of those bad nights.”
“If you invite me in, that means you’re willing to sit and talk with me this afternoon, at which point I’ll give you this.” He held up the wooden box. “If you accept it, then we’ve officially started the process, which is, well. Basically a formal way of dating with an eye to marriage.”

“Mm. I see. Potter, you know Blaise and Draco were close, even before their…
But the unicorns did not run off, either. They would leave the road at times, but always returned. And Circe, Draco’s unicorn, and Lia’s unicorn (which she had named Frankie, just to be spiteful after Frankie admitted she didn’t believe the creatures were actual unicorns) were docile as lambs, never leaving their sides, obeying their every command, letting them set the pace.
It was nice to dance like this, to feel Ron so close. “You feel good,” said Harry.
And then he was done.
“I’m not. Both Hermione and I adore pegging and Ron’s always gagging for it. The man loves getting his arse pounded, let me tell you. And say what you will about him, but Ronald Weasley is the most generous lover I’ve ever had. He aims to please, Draco, he really does. All he wants is to make sure we all have fun and that Hermione and I are satisfied, and if you could only
Hermione laughed loudly before covering her mouth like she hadn’t meant to. “Oh, why the hell not?” she managed.
“Oh, you’re never fun. Draco’s never fun, Harry, I should warn you right up front. Don’t want you getting your hopes up, thinking you’ve made a great new friend, only to have you learn the hard way that he’s one of the most sinfully boring individuals you’ll ever meet. He wouldn’t even explore his cellar with me this summer, and let me tell you, there is

This time around, things weren’t like that.
Pansy frowned. “Blaise is not about to tell Padma he’d fooling around with a
“You know,” Draco said, applying a bit more pressure as he stroked Harry through the pants. “This already feels better than nearly every other experience I’ve had, and we’ve hardly done anything. I don’t think it’s possible for you to be pants at it. You’re Harry Potter, remember? The first time you flew, McGonagall made you Gryffindor’s new Seeker even though you were a first year -- which was patently unfair, might I add. You killed Voldemort, for Salazar’s sake. I’m sure you can figure out how to give a bloke a hand job.”
“And you’re lovely, too, ‘Mione. Isn’t she lovely, Malfoy?”
“Of course,” said Draco.
“Hullo,” he said, looking around.
He usually hadn't been pounding gin all night, though. That part was new.
There was a hand in his hair, gently tugging at strands, absently twirling pieces of it, which was something his mother did sometimes, especially when he was younger. He felt safe in a way he hadn’t in a long time; safe and cared for, and content.
Draco sighed.
Frankie told them that they were free to stay with the Rebels in their camp at Glum’s Marsh for the next several weeks, and then travel with William further north to Rodderem, which was the capital of North March. In both places, they would be under William’s protection, which, in Draco’s opinion, seemed preferable to walking around alone with a target on his back.
“Your cock’s as gorgeous as the rest of you,” the man whispered, his breath hot on Draco’s neck as he wrapped a hand around the base of said cock. “Fucking hell.”
Malfoy walked into the showers, and Harry walked back to his room. Something felt off, broken, and Harry had no fucking clue what it was.
“Yes, but my theory was
After Draco’s long, exhausting shower, he went with Harry to the library. It was Draco’s favorite room in the townhouse. It wasn’t massive like the library at Malfoy Manor, wasn’t two stories high with thousands of books. It was a single, normal-sized room, with a stately fireplace and wall-to-wall shelves. There was a desk in one corner, a relic from the Manor with a glowing, mahogany top and legs edged in ivory trim. There was also a very cozy rug in front of the fireplace, and two soft, leather armchairs to really sink yourself into.
Harry bit his lip.
“I don’t keep things from her,” Weasley protested.
Will was lanky and blond and slouchy, sort of model-esque. He had on a slightly cropped tank top that didn’t quite reach his trackies, which were pulled low on his hips. “Hello,” he said, not offering his hand. He sounded bored. Harry willed himself not to get hard.
Dean surprised everyone by pulling her a bit closer when she kissed him, and sticking up his middle finger at Ron behind her back.
Potter looked at him, his eyes big and green and sad. “I’m sorry.”
Harry frowned. “I’m just as soft and liberal.”
“Is she blonde and freckly?” asked Sarah.
“I don’t
The Dark Lord was every bit as terrible as Draco remembered: slits where the nose should be; too-smooth, too-pale skin; eyes like the devil’s.
Merlin knew Harry’d tried. He’d tried to corner Draco after meetings, tried to get him to grab drinks in the evenings, even sought him out one day in Woad Hall, only to have Draco’s assistant tell him that Draco was out of the office for a lunch meeting. Draco’d scared Harry off of sending any texts besides those related strictly to the campaign, and he’d never really emailed Draco much anyway.
Euri grinned. “That’s kind of hot.”
For some reason, he felt okay about that today, though. He flooed to his house, dropping his duffel bag onto the floor with a loud thump and setting out to look for Stormy. Obviously, cats didn’t come when called like dogs did, but Stormy tended to greet him when he’d been gone. But he still hadn’t seen her after making a quick tour of the house. Probably outside sunning herself, he thought.
“It definitely makes her laugh more,” Potter offered, which wasn’t even that funny, but Hermione apparently thought it was, because she began laughing so hard that she fell off of her chair and managed to pull Mandy down with her, and then the two of them just stayed on the floor.
Potter looked down the hall. “Lovely,” he said in a clipped tone. He looked back at Draco. “You followed through after all. Didn’t think you would.”
Harry laughed.
Draco couldn’t move or think very well. That was bad, what Cassius was saying. It was really bad and it made Draco feel bad, and he was certain his aura looked like utter shit now. The music seemed heavy, all of a sudden, like it weighed a million pounds, all of it crashing down on Draco’s head. And he wanted Pansy. Or Harry. Pansy or Harry. But not Cassius, not so close, and not saying this.
Potter scooted into the bed and Draco stayed still for a moment as Potter moved his feet around. They were near Draco’s shoulder, and then right next to his face. “Ugh, no. I can’t deal with your feet all night.”
Draco put down the brief he was looking over and sighed. “Probably. I don’t know. Has the security detail been helpful?” After the attack, Draco had assigned one of their best security staff members to Harry, to look after him full-time, not caring whether it looked reactive or over the top.
“I needed to,” said Draco.
“Ernie broke up with me,” Draco said, and to his supreme mortification, he felt his eyes fill.
Harry threw his head back and huffed out a laugh. “You want me to fuck you in the Gryffindor Common Room, do you?” he whispered.
“I love you, too,” Draco said, kissing the tip of Harry’s nose. He pushed back Harry’s fringe and kissed his forehead. “I never thought anything like this would happen. I never even imagined it. It would’ve seemed so unrealistic…foolish. I never allowed myself to think of it. Sex, sure, but not this.”
Sarah took the bag into the kitchen, her mom, her dad, Len, Seamus, and Robbie trailing behind her. Maddy and Colin were already in there eating Hot Pockets.
“Oh? That sounds interesting.”
“Hey, Draco!” shouted a voice. He turned and saw Blaise Zabini poke his head out of the next car. “Over here!”
“I’m dancing with my face two inches away from yours, Draco,” Harry said, grinning. “I think I’m already outed. Might as well give them a show.” Harry had his other hand on the back of Draco’s neck, and now he began playing with the hair there, tugging softly.
, Harry. I’ve loved you forever. I’ve wanted you forever.”
So Astoria told her. She hadn’t told anyone, and it felt strangely satisfying to detail all of Draco’s crimes against her out loud. “And now, he’s convinced himself that I engineered his breakup with Harry, that it was all part of some scheme to get him to marry me. It’s absurd!”
, for the last time.”
her. But Narcissa had insisted, constantly asking Harry over for tea at the Manor, sending him boxes of chocolates any time she sent some to Draco, insisting that Harry spend some weekends in Wiltshire with them. Slowly and with much hesitation, he’d gotten to know her a bit, and discovered that there was much more to her than the icy bitch she’d presented herself as when they were younger.
“Can I help?” asked Sarah. “I’m good at paperwork.”
Harry went out with Euri again the following Tuesday, for dinner in Bath followed by drinks and fooling around at Harry’s house.
“You’re going to sleep with him, aren’t you?” asked Sarah, looking up at Harry worriedly.
Potter’s eyes widened. “But they’re…doesn’t Voldemort
Blaise Zabini grinned lasciviously. “You three could
A little after nine, the door burst open and Charlie came in, cradling Draco in his arms. Draco looked uninjured, except that he was paler than usual, and his breaths were coming in gasps. He wasn’t conscious.
“Dolohov,” said Harry, spitting the name out like it was poison. “He’s a sick bastard.”
to Blaise’s finger.
“Perhaps,” Draco said. He hadn’t really thought about it. “
“Good morning, love,” said Draco, his gray eyes meeting hers. “How’d you sleep?”
“Harry, I feel like we haven’t finished this conversation,” said Draco when he could free his mouth for a moment. “Don’t you think we should –”
Harry gave him a boot to the arse, which was probably not how one was supposed to treat the Head Auror, but oh well. Maybe the Head Auror should try to behave with a shred of professionalism instead of telling his employees to get off with random blokes in the loo.
“I didn’t say anything!” Ron protested.
“I’ve had a crush on him since I was ten years old, Malfoy!”
Draco crossed his arms over his chest. He was hurt, Harry could tell, but Harry was the one with a friend in a coma. Draco was the one who’d been running about with his wife and his son all morning, who’d brought his wife into Mungo’s when Harry’d needed him. It was Harry who ought to feel hurt. “You’re sure?” Draco asked. “I can stay, you know. I can send Tony to the event in my stead.”
“You’re both fucking idiots, I swear to Salazar,” Pansy said after Harry was gone. “If either one of you comes in here whining again about –”
After a moment, he blinked his eyes back open. Nothing had happened.
“Actually, I wasn’t last night. Finally crashed. But you still could’ve checked.”
Draco celebrates Christmas with Harry and then does something stupid
They were laughing when they burst through the back doors of the Manor. It was cool and dark inside, and it took Harry’s eyes a moment to adjust.
“Were you jealous of him for touching me? Or were you jealous of me for touching him?”
Ron kicked at Harry’s shin. “Yeah, you’re lucky you’re so hideous, Harry. Nobody bothers you.”
Why had he been so devastated at the thought of losing his mortal enemy? Had he loved him, somehow, even then? The thought made his chest hurt. He wondered why things with Draco always seemed almost painful in their intensity, why they affected him so viscerally.
“What do you think, Harry?” Draco said, leaning forward and speaking quietly. “Which house do you want to be in?”
As for all the one-night stands he’d had, Harry barely knew any of those people – certainly not well enough to ask them to a Christmas Eve ball. In the end, Ari had been the only one he could think to ask. And Ari, eager to get to know Harry and mix and mingle with the campaign team, said yes immediately.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake. It’s not like she doesn’t do the same thing! It’s entirely open. We don’t
“Come on!” Harry yelled, pulling Draco back into the crowd, and Draco forgot all about Theo.
“Cretin,” said Draco, flinging a pillow at him.
“Erm,” said Potter, looking uncomfortable.
“I’m not. We’re rather good friends, actually. I just saw him yesterday.”
She threw up her hands. “As if I’d know! Probably not. Maybe. I think he was looking for a reason to spare Edwin. They’re boyhood friends, you know. Very close, although only the goddess knows how William could ever stand him. Edwin’s sister is promised to William, too. Their families are tied together in more ways than one.”
He laughed and it felt warm in his chest. He felt rather delightful in general, like everything in the world was good and wholesome, like everyone was worth loving, every single person. “I would never,” he said. He lifted one of Pansy’s feet up to his mouth and kissed the top of it and she grinned at him.
“Watch where you’re going, cunt,” said Edwin’s sharp voice, and Draco felt the ‘sorry’ die on his tongue.
“Good morning, darling,” Pansy said, smiling. “I’m going to hop in the shower. Join me?”
“They bloody well
He shook himself free of his thoughts as Malfoy came back into the room. Scorpius and Albus were laughing together behind him, and Lily was by his side, talking to him earnestly. “I only have a starter Potions kit, and goodness knows you can’t brew things like Alihotsy Draught with it. I’ve read all about it, though. I think I could brew it, if I had the right supplies. I know that you have to be very precise with potions like that, about the order of things and the measuring and the number of times you stir. Albus always throws everything into the cauldron and thinks it’s going to work out, but usually it just smokes and stinks.”
“So far as I knew,” said Draco.
He didn’t want that to go away. He owed it to himself and to Draco, both, to figure out the truth of what had happened.
Harry sat up straight. “Um…” he was a little bit afraid of dares at this point. “Truth.”
Finally, with nothing much else to do, Draco wandered back downstairs to get a book and maybe a cup of coffee. Harry was already at the kitchen table, clad in trackies and a hoodie, sipping tea. “Nice getup,” Draco said, and Harry flipped him off, grinning.
“Yeah, alright. Thanks. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow, then, Malfoy.”
Malfoy wasn’t kidding when he’d said he had a few tattoos. There was the one on his chest, with the Ancient Greek text, and then there were emerald-green vines curling over his hips, woven with dark pink flowers. They looked lush, almost like you could reach out and touch them and feel the softness of the petals. The vines curled into his black y-fronts enticingly, disappearing beneath the fabric. There was a sinuous, scaled dragon on his thigh in a peacock blue, and on one of his biceps was a golden snitch that looked so real Harry thought it might flutter away.
“Who else?” Pansy said, ignoring him.
“I’m really not,” Draco said, setting down the toothbrush and unwrapping the sling. Beneath the wrappings, his skin was perfectly healed without a single scar. “See?”
Draco shrugged. “Well enough. Tired.”
She giggled. “Then you’ll be like every other person who tries smoking for the first time.”
Malfoy waved the idea away. “No wand, no magic, remember?”
love lives,” Pansy corrected.
Draco regarded him as steadily as possible. He looked a little flushed and awkward, but no more than usual. Well, Draco wasn’t going to let him get away with this. He’d put on a show for Draco outside that club, maybe just to fuck with him, and Draco wasn’t going to pretend otherwise. “Hello,” he said, proud of how unconcerned and almost bored he sounded. “I’d ask you how your weekend was, but I already know you had a good time on Friday.”
He willed himself to
Potter grinned. “That’s rather the point of a crush, isn’t it?”
“So’re you,” Draco said.
what I want.”
Draco is held captive at Malfoy Manor and then Harry shows up
“Don’t know. Didn’t seem like she wanted to. I get the sense that she wants to take things slow, which is fine, I guess. I like talking to her. And she did play with my hair some more, so that was nice.” Suddenly, she grinned at Harry. “Can you get the cream out of the fridge for me?”
"Bloody hell," he murmured. They were asleep, but it was them: Chang and Peabody. They didn’t look good. Looked pretty awful, actually, pale and thin and worn. They were still in their Auror robes, which were covered in so much muck they hardly looked red anymore. “Who are they?” Laurel asked him quietly.
“Of course I do,” Harry said, pulling Draco in closer and wrapping him up in his arms. Harry began planting small kisses along Draco’s neck and across his cheek, and then he was kissing his mouth again, soft and tender, and if Draco hadn’t believed it before, he believed it now, because it was here in this kiss, in every brush of lips, in the way he was holding Draco so carefully, like he was some precious thing, like he was
“Sorry?” Draco said, shaking himself. He realized Hermione had been speaking for some time.
Draco would have to leave school if that happened. He would have to. The alternative was far too horrifying.
There's just no other way
Harry scrawled onto a piece of parchment, letting his handwriting flow from the quill loose and sloppy, just to prove a point.
“Well, for one, his Pornhub search history is full of threesomes. Threesomes and orgies and gang-bangs and spit-roasting and –”
“I’m finding it difficult to feel much of anything besides happy at the moment,” Harry said, looking up at him.
Potter didn't bring him any presents, didn't make any grand gestures. The only food he ever brought up were sacks of fish and chips and the occasional curry. But he brought tea, sometimes, and he'd sit in the rocker in the corner of Draco's bedroom and keep him company. Sometimes they didn't even talk, but it helped to have someone there. He didn't give advice or talk about how it was going to take time or how she was in a better place. He sat, and when Draco felt like talking, he listened, and when Draco didn't, he read or dozed or yapped about nothing of import.
“What do you mean? Of course it is.”
Hermione took the bottle and thanked him, and ushered him and Poppy into the kitchen. She popped open the bottle, which was an expensive-looking Pinot Noir, and poured everyone a glass. While she was pouring, Poppy wandered casually over to Harry. “Harry, this is my friend, Euripides. Euripides, this is Harry”
, Draco. Nothing. Do you understand?”
Draco felt so good under him, and Harry’s cock was throbbing as he sought relief in friction, grinding into him, feeling Draco’s cock thick and hard against his own.
Hermione jumped up. “Where’s Ron?” she asked.
“We should test them,” said Pansy. “Draco, kiss Blaise.”
“Potter’s down there!” came Xenophilius’s voice from behind the blockade. “I told you I’d give you Potter.”
I've been here
He looked back up at Draco, a deep growl falling from his lips, and then the sly smile was back on his face.
“What did he say?”
Harry laughed, and then got suddenly serious. “Pansy…nothing actually happened with Ron, right?”
Draco took Scorpius from Harry, moving him gently, in an effort to avoid waking him. “I’ll get Scorpius and Astoria home and come back,” he said quietly.
“You’re still wild,” Draco said, pressing his shoulder into Harry’s.
“What the fuck is wrong with you tonight?” Ron asks, looking at you with a fascinated, slightly terrified expression. “You are acting
Harry threw an impish grin over his shoulder, and Draco supposed that was as much of an answer as he was going to get.
“Good,” said Harry. He took a sip of his pint, and decided to order some chips. He and Ron needed to break their habit of forgetting to eat anything when they were drinking. “I hear you ended things with ‘Mione,” he said afterward.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, I was there, remember? We did win. We did it. Or you did, rather, getting those two Slytherins to vote yes. You missed a pretty entertaining final SASS meeting, by the way. Hermione was singing again.”
It picked up traction very quickly. Harry was already somewhat-known in the muggle fitness community in the U.S. and in England, and they were both famous (infamous?) in the wizarding world. Everyone wanted to read about their adventures, and honestly, they gave great advice and recommendations, too. And, everyone was in agreement: Draco Malfoy’s posts were really fucking funny.
"Get off of there, you wanker! You’re going to get yourself killed!” Draco yelled. Mustering every ounce of courage he had, which wasn’t all that much, Draco charged. He had no real plan and ended up bouncing off of the troll’s sticky body, but before he fell, he managed to kick hard as he could at the troll's knees (where the knees ought to be, anyway; it was sort of hard to tell).
“No, you’re not,” Harry said.
decided to try and forgive you. Only…I’m not yet certain how to do it. It’s been more difficult than I expected.”

“Potter, I stopped caring about all that even before the war ended. That’s not to say I would ever want anything serious with a muggle. I don't think I ever would; it wouldn't work. They don’t understand anything about me.”
bad,” he protested, looking to Draco.
“Can I sit?” Harry asked. “I’m so tired.”
He wanted Draco in his arms. He wanted to kiss Draco. He wanted Draco to see reason and to tell Dominic to piss off.
what I thought. I was wrong, you know, about you.”
“Er, I guess?” Harry said.
“It wasn’t.” She stood and looked at him again. “I don’t know that I’ll ever get over this, you know. I think I could have gotten over the cheating eventually. But this? I don’t know that I can.”
That only made Potter’s smile widen. “Honestly, Ferret.
“Well, come on, we’d better hurry.”
“Hm?” asked Astoria, pouring him more coffee.
“Hm. Interesting,” she said, considering him. “Never have I ever given head.”
“Luna, he’s not going to ask me to dance.”
Hermione, still dressed in her club clothes, was waiting for him in his kitchen. She had started the kettle. “Hermione?” he called uncertainly.
“Merlin, Pansy. No. For fuck’s sake. I don’t know that I’m ready to settle down anytime soon. I did just get divorced last year, you know.”
“Oookay,” said Harry. “I’m just going to go now.” He began inching towards the stairs.
Draco nodded, and then said the password (“lavender lilies”; it was always something to do with the color purple).
“Oh, Merlin. Draco. No.”
“So, you’re telling me...” He trailed off, his eyes locked on Draco’s. His hands were itching to clench into fists, and he wanted nothing more than to hit something. Not Draco, but basically anything else. He could feel his magic crackling around him like static electricity. “You’re telling me that it was all a misunderstanding? Bad timing? Is that what you’re saying?” His pint glass suddenly exploded, shards of glass flying.
, hm? And what if I want to fuck you instead?” His mouth was next to Draco’s ear now, his breath hot. He nipped at the tender skin below his ear. “Would you let me?”
over for tea? What the fuck, Pansy!”
people have legs that look like mine. My god, Draco! All this over
“Good. Now, tell me about the conclusions you’ve drawn regarding these adventures. What lessons do you think you’ve learned?”
Sarah shook her head fervently. “No way. Harry wouldn’t be acting like such a dick if he and Draco were fucking again. He was
. You and I can go with Malfoy-Potter. You arse.”
He no longer walked around with that sense of heightened anxiety -- in the daytime hours, at least, when he could convince himself that he was safe in this strange, post-war world. Safe at Hogwarts, in its familiar corridors and sun-lit classrooms; safe in the Eighth-Year dorm room that he shared with Blaise and Weasley and Justin Finch-Fletchley, of all people. Talk about a motley crew.
Things were calm(ish), but no one was entirely happy. Charlie was going out of his way to be nice to Draco, to talk to him and include him in everything, but he was different when he and Harry were alone. Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Charlie still kissed him when they were together. He still held him. He still said I love you. But there was a cautiousness to it that was new. It was like Charlie was closing himself off, bit by bit. Not outwardly, but somewhere inside.
“Fine, I’ll mix the drinks. You round up the children and get them washed up for supper,” said Draco, smirking.
Draco stood up and crossed his arms. “I
Ron started laughing. “Oh, that’s too good. Did he do it on purpose?”
After lunch, Harry decided to go for a run. It was hot out – the heat of summer – and he was covered in sweat by the time he got home. He took a shower and was standing in front of his closet in pants, trying to figure out what to wear, when he heard Seamus’s voice from downstairs. He pulled on a t-shirt and ran down.
“Yes,” Draco said, nodding. “In case I feel faint.”
Harry’s other hand came up to Draco’s cheek and his thumb slid over Draco’s fine cheekbone. “Harry,” Draco whispered, not opening his eyes. He was so perfectly beautiful; Harry wanted to memorize the lines of his face, just as it was now, and keep them tucked away somewhere safe.
Soon, he began to feel a little buzzed. The drink was strong stuff. Potter was talking about trying to get their hands on a map, which would be very helpful. Draco could tell he was feeling the ale as well, because he was much more animated than usual, and his cheeks were flushed, and he even reached over and grabbed Draco’s wrist at some point, for emphasis, and he had not touched Draco once since pulling him out of the lake when he was running from the Siren. His hand was rough with callouses and Draco had a sudden, rogue thought about what it would feel like skirting over his skin, and shivered. Thankfully, Potter didn't notice.
Harry, thought Draco wildly. Where was Harry?
“That’s what I’m hoping you’ll do,” Cassius said, his voice low. He laughed. “It
“Of course,” Alexander said, inclining his head.
Harry took his hands and held them over his head, pinning them in place with one of his, and began fucking him harder, their eyes locked together, their breathing in sync. “Always,” he panted. “I’ll always want you.”
Something crashed into his side, then, and the smell of wild magic, like earth and blood, filled his nostrils, and he looked up and saw a mouth opening wide – too wide – and saliva stretching between sharp teeth, and he braced himself.
“Yes. Um, yes? And…definitely yes?”
“You fucked with me. You fucked with me like my feelings didn’t matter. Thank Christ I had the sense not to fall for it.”
“Then don’t. Let me go,” Draco said, seeing a sliver of hope for the first time. “I swear I won’t tell anyone what you did. I’ll say I missed the debate because I was ill.”
Draco wanted to make some cutting remark about packing up one’s things via committee, but he refrained. Nearly all Ernie’s criticisms of Draco had related to his sharp tongue and temper, and how he was always sarcastic and occasionally cruel. If he wanted Ernie to start mourning the loss of him, he had to be smarter than that. He had to hold his tongue.
Potter had been talking to Pike, but now he stood up. “See you out there soon?” he asked, putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
less boring,” Pansy declared when they were done.
, Draco could see it in his unwavering gaze, in the firmness of his words.
Sarah started giggling.
When it's forming
“Well, smart one, I’ve got your wand back in our room.”
“Your mate’s over here,” Dolohov said, pointing to one of the back rooms. Draco gulped. The spot where he and Pansy had been chained up, in the main part of the dungeon, was open and clearly visible to anyone who came down the stairs. But there were two tiny rooms off the back where a lot of the torture occurred. And where a lot of other things occurred, too, things that nobody liked to talk about.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think I slept for, like, a month beforehand.”
!” she exclaimed. “And I’ve never felt so
“We’re working on getting a presser lined up for you after the close of veto session next Friday. You want to do it here or at Woad Hall?”
Draco sighed, his eyes shining almost silver. “I don’t know. How do you know?”
“Shut up!” Draco cried. “Shut up, shut up! You arsehole! I’m trying to be supportive here!”
. That’s not what happened at all!”
Potter heaved a sigh.
Draco turned back to blondie. “So, now that you've forced me to make an arsehole of myself, might you be able to do your job and help me?” he asked with a tight smile.
“After the election, probably.”
Potter nodded, looking a little relieved.
except for the hour in the mornings when they ran together.
“Just tell me the coordinates,” said Draco, not moving any closer. He didn’t want to offend Potter’s delicate sensibilities by forcing him to make actual, physical contact with Death Eater scum.
But it was more than that. He realized he sensed the thing, although it was impossible to know whether it was just in his imagination or real.  It felt real. He could almost hear its breath, its footsteps across the wood floor. Then he felt a flicker of something up over his skin, tickling him, and he imagined that those pale fingers with long, ragged nails from his dream were walking up his spine. He shivered, hard, and kept shivering, and the room suddenly felt cold around him. Too cold; freezing. He hurried over to the floo and intended to pick up a handful of powder and go, only his hand wouldn’t reach into the cannister. It was motionless, deadweight at his side.
And suddenly they were kissing, hot and brutal and breathless, and Potter’s body was on his, pressing him back against the door, and his hands were on Draco’s waist and then slipping under his t-shirt, sliding along the waistband of his trousers. Draco moaned into his mouth and wrapped his leg around Potter’s calf, rolling his hips, feeling Potter’s hard cock against his own.
“And there’s the problem,” Harry said, and suddenly the toast and eggs and bacon were churning around in his gut. “The
“Not really,” said Draco, raising an eyebrow. “I want bed.”
“What the fuck, Pansy,” he murmured.
“I’m willing to do other things.”
Gelou Castle was something out of a fairytale. Horror story. Whatever. It was up in the mountains, perched on a cliffside like a hawk waiting to strike. It was hidden from muggles and had been owned by wizards continually since it’s construction: a single family had lived there from the time it was built until the 1600’s, when it changed hands, and then a second family had owned it until the early part of the 20
Malfoy was standing in the doorway, his eyes fixed on Harry’s, his arms limp at his sides. He looked frightened.
“Goddess, no,” Lia said, rolling her eyes. “Thea and Thera!” she yelled.
Harry was maddening in so many ways, but Draco (and perhaps this was the moving-in-together-honeymoon-period talking) found all of his quirks a bit endearing. And annoying, obviously, but in a way that made him strangely happy.
Who can sex you like me (nobody)
“In your fucking dreams,” said Draco.
“If you don’t mind me asking, what exactly happened? I mean, I know what happened the night you and Euri broke up, but then…did you get back together, briefly, or something? Because it seemed like you were even more upset a week later.”
Harry found himself shrinking back into his seat. “What?”
them. We don’t like them anyway.” She huffed, taking a giant swig of her wine. “Honestly, I can’t say I blame you for going back. Especially with that sexy-ass Prince Charming waiting for you. Can you tell me again what he looks like?”
Harry and Padma nodded.
Pansy giggled. “Fuck off and make me a drink.”
“Oh my god,” Pansy said, staring at him. “I cannot believe you just did that.”
“True,” Malfoy said, swatting Harry’s hand away. “Although you’re a terrible bed hog.”
He pushed Malfoy back onto the cushions. Malfoy landed a bit too high up along the couch, but Harry didn’t particularly care, and anyway, it caused his head to fall back over the couch’s arm, which left his throat vulnerable again. Harry could feel Malfoy hard against him through the fine fabric of his expensive trousers as he scraped his teeth along Malfoy’s jaw, the skin there soft and hot. “You’re already hard for me, you fucking slag,” he said as he ran his palm over Malfoy’s cock.
“I can if you can,” Harry said.
Has the sweet breeze blown?
The sleeping figure shifted, and Draco felt his heart thud uncomfortably as he turned his gaze back to the book, staring at it so intently that he should’ve burned a hole in the pages.
at me for not pursuing you after
“Absolutely not!” Harry called back to her as he batted smoke away from the alarm with a towel. Another boom of thunder rang through the house.
to marry you? You might have been happy. We both might have been happy.”
A cheer was raised and a dozen cups were passed in Ham’s direction. He gulped the first and then another, and the audience cheered even louder. After the cheering died down, Draco turned to Harry. “Ready to dance again?” Harry drained his cup and nodded. “Where the hell did you get gold paint, anyway?” Draco asked, looking him over. “I
Harry slotted himself between Malfoy’s legs and began to use his cock to stroke Malfoy’s cock. Malfoy closed his eyes, and Harry knew, at this point, what Malfoy sounded like when he was going to come. He sounded a little like that now. Harry leaned forward to kiss him, and it was a bloody good kiss. All of Malfoy’s kisses were good – dirty, and wet, and soft. “Harry,” Malfoy whispered.
“As if that’s possible,” said Harry. “Seamus does what he bloody well pleases. Nobody can control him. Not us, not Dean; nobody. If you ever say anything even remotely critical to him, he freaks out at you.”
“He’s a prisoner, Lucius,” said Selwyn in his gruff voice. “He belongs in the dungeon.”
, which always felt a little naughty. Sometimes he’d wank in Potter’s desk chair, sometimes on the desk itself. It depended on his mood, really.
The courtroom cleared out, everyone filing silently past Draco and into the hall. The family solicitor patted him on the shoulder as he walked by. “He didn’t get a kiss. Be grateful for that,” he said, his blue eyes meeting Draco’s quickly for a moment before darting away.
Fucking Blaise. Fucking Blaise, he was going to kick the shit out of that piece of shit. What a complete
“I didn’t mean to fuck with you! Harry, please,” Ron cried.
Harry couldn’t last much longer. He kissed Draco frantically, pulling at him, wanting to bring him closer, wanting to merge with him completely, and then he was coming in hot spurts, wet and warm between their bodies, and Draco shuddered at the feel of Harry clenching around him and then was coming soon after, shuddering and pulsing his way through his climax.
Potter scowled. “You don’t know that. You said it might be like Occlumency.”
, much less to Seamus himself. He’d always figured it was something Seamus would come to terms with in his own time.
Draco turned and gave him his coldest glare, but Potter only smiled sweetly back at him.
Draco, wanting to cry in frustration, stood and managed to make his way to the door, and headed down the hallway to his tiny room. He sat down on his bed and picked up his pillow. Holding it up to his face, he screamed into it as loud as he could.
This much I know is true
It certainly would make life easier. Draco didn’t trust in this method like Potter did, but then again, he
“Girls are brilliant,” Harry agreed. “And boys are brilliant. And either way, it’ll be wonderful. It’s going to be so wonderful.”
If someone asked him to describe Malfoy for a muggle police sketch artist, he was fairly certain he would be able to detail Malfoy’s face so precisely that it would lead to an exact rendition of the actual thing. Every time he closed his eyes, it seemed to appear there, against his closed lids, like Malfoy maybe lived in his head now.
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter and gold
“Daphne,” Blaise said, taking her hand. “Look at me, darling. Look at me.”
“So, tell us,” Hermione said. “What’s the news?”
But Malfoy wasn’t alone. Harry could hear them, down the hall, in a bedroom, probably. Malfoy and someone. Malfoy and who? Who was in here? And why? Didn’t Malfoy know Harry needed him?
“What do I say?” Harry whispered to Malfoy.
“You could help me and you won’t,” Draco said, some of his anger spilling out. “I don’t understand.”
with them, and Harry swore there were more witches and wizards than non-mags in New Orleans.
“That’s brilliant!” Draco exclaimed. “How about,
, and it felt good.
“Fuck off,” Harry said, kissing his mouth again. “I can fuck and cry at the same time.”
“I don’t want him to feel like we’re ganging up on him,” Hermione said gently. “This needs to be a discussion between the two of you. He’d be
“I’m assuming you and the Weasley girl are no longer an item. You don’t strike me as the cheating type,” Pansy said.
The room was silent in the aftermath of his tirade, and they stared at one another.
He shook his head slowly. “No, nothing like that.”
“I was thinking tomorrow instead. It’s sort of Blaise and Ginny’s night. And it would be weird to share an anniversary with them.”
“Yeah, tell me about it,” Harry said.
Draco hadn’t seen them, or he’d have already done them. “No worries. I didn’t even notice,” he said, not really caring at the moment. He wondered, as he drifted off to sleep, whether Harry was going to turn him into the sort of person who didn’t stress about a few dirty dishes in the sink, and whether that might actually be a good thing.
It had been a considerable while since they’d eaten, and Draco realized he was rather hungry, too. He hadn’t been focused on it, but now that he was, he realized it was making him feel nauseous. “Yes, but how do we know what’s edible?”
“Well, yes,” Laurel admitted. “But we might stand a chance against the Queensguard.”
“Then we are finished,” Dorthea said. “Thank you all for your time.”
Draco looked astonished. “But – you aren’t…oh, sweet Salazar.”
Which was fine, and, given that this was Pansy, didn’t even surprise him all that much. However, it had the unintended consequence of bringing him and Potter together fairly regularly.
“Tell James I swear to take care of Harry for the rest of my days,” said Draco. “Tell him…tell him that his son means everything to me. Tell him Harry’s the best person I’ve ever known and I love him with all my heart.” Harry slumped against Draco and Draco put an arm around him. Behind them, he heard Hermione sniffling.
“Maybe it was similar to Occlumency. I’m rather good at that. Or maybe…” he broke off suddenly with a gasp, and then he started to laugh.
“Right.”
“The letter you sent on Christmas was nice,” Draco said, finally. “I was rather upset about Ari, even though I didn’t exactly have a right to be. It just…it hurt, to see you with him. And I was confused by what happened out on the balcony. I don’t know what you want, Harry, and I have no idea how you feel. You never explained anything to me, you just told me to get out –” He broke off and reached for his coffee and took a sip.
He nodded, and then Draco was rushing over and sweeping him into a hug. “Harry, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know it would be so weird. I thought it might be okay, maybe, but of course it wasn’t. And then…” he pulled back. “And then you and Weasley…did you…” He trailed off, his eyes searching Harry’s face. “Just – what happened?”
They were hesitant to eat or drink anything in the forest because of the lake water disaster the night before, so they started walking. They needed to find an end to the forest. It had to have an end, surely. And even if it didn't, Draco wasn't going to think about that yet.
“You know our numbers –” Berold began.
Harry pressed his forehead to Draco’s, his glasses bumping softly against Draco’s face. “I want them to know,” he said, and Draco could feel Harry’s breath against his lips. “I want them to know you’re mine.”
If you would've been the one
“I want to start drinking,” Ginny said.
Potter rolled his eyes. “Fine. This better work.”
― Frances Hodgson Burnett,
: No shit. Hang on, I’ll ask everybody.
Potter laughed at that. “Yeah, that sucks. It would be nice to have a reason to punch you again.” He was ripping a napkin to shreds, totally obliterating it. “You know, we’d probably work well together if we didn’t hate each other so much.”
Harry owled Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Pansy the next day and told them the plan. On Wednesday, Harry and Draco and the children arrived at the Ministry at quarter after ten and, after some quick paperwork, were married by one of the members of the Wizengamot. They took the kids out for lunch and then went back to the Manor and began discussing who would sleep where. James, Al, and Lily raced through the corridors, trying to pick rooms.
“No,” he called back.
“And it’s not as though we can fight back,” muttered Potter. “Since now we don’t even have our wands.”
Potter only laughed again. “Excellent question.”
Draco had to squeeze his eyes shut and stop the movement of his fist along his cock to keep from crying out at the sight of it. His entire body was practically vibrating with desire, it felt like he was on fire, flames licking every inch of his skin.
He tried to think again about Euri, about his broad, white smile and his dimples, and about the fact that he was (quite adorably) attempting to make duck confit, but his mind kept returning to Malfoy, so furious, and just because Harry was trying to help him.
Harry has brunch and a sleepover
“Good,” she said, nodding, and sashayed over to the bar, enjoying the feel of Sarah’s eyes on her arse. That one was adorable, and she couldn’t help but be pleased by this new addition to their cloistered set.
Ari gave him a skeptical look.
He needed to rid himself of this demon before he got out of the shower, so that he could behave like a normal person. There was no wall to lean on in here, only a curtain going all the way around, which was really fucking inconvenient when it came to wanking. He wrapped his hand around his cock and thought of Harry’s arse, and what it would look like without the swishy trousers. Without anything at all. Merlin, it was so perky and perfectly round, and Harry had a delicious dip to his back that Draco was really spending too much time thinking about lately.
She looked a little teary anyway. “Any time. I hope you know you’re welcome any time, Harry. You’re family. I don’t want you to think that just because…well…you’re still family. It doesn’t matter whether or not you’re dating our daughter. We still love you like you’re our own.”
He nodded. He could almost
They slept that night in a valley, underneath a blanket of stars, a fire burning brightly between them. In the morning they rose and continued to wind their way through the hills.
“I fucking hope so, or I’ve really let myself get carried away with the Pensieve,” Draco said wryly.
“It’s pub night,” he said carefully. He didn’t necessarily want to get into the Charlie Weasley situation with Pansy right now; she still didn’t know.
Then he began to move, slowly, like the pace his mouth had set when it was on Draco’s cock. He took one of Draco’s hands in his and wove their fingers together and held it up above Draco’s head, and braced himself with the other hand. When he kissed him again, It was needy and wet and messy, and he was making little noises as he licked into Draco’s mouth.
“Were you hoping for something else?” Potter asked. “Because this is what I thought about, what I thought we needed.”
“I did! Or, at least, I
Over and over the only truth
“Oh?” asked Draco. “Do tell. Tell me about your secret, scandalous crushes. Let me guess: you were in love with Minerva McGonagall.”
“Mm. Good to know,” Malfoy said, and just the way he said it made Harry’s stomach dip deliciously. “Now we can be friends, officially.” He raised his glass.
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready,
“Because I think I’m in love with Potter.”
“He did,” William said, nodding. “Kerrick is traveling, but he agreed to help you at the end of summer when his travels are finished. You and Harry are to meet him in Rodderem when he sends for you.”
,” but that was all.
Harry’d tried. He’d purchased a new navy suit. Nothing exceptional or attention-grabbing, but it fit perfectly and was well-made, which was half the battle, honestly. “Thanks,” Harry said. “I’m done with dad-duty for the night. Want to dance?”
Unfortunately, that had not been the only reason. The other reason was Blaise.
Draco continued to tease his way along Harry’s cock, and Harry began sighing and shivering. Draco took the opportunity to kiss along his jaw, then lower, to his chest, pausing at a pink nipple to lick across its surface. Harry groaned roughly, gripping Draco hard.
He dreamt of the tunnel, of the thing, the shadow. A scuttling, bottomless creature, the size of a ping-pong ball and the size of a large horse all at once. It was fast, faster than his eyes could move, and it had been here in the in-between for a long time.
“That they do,” Draco said, nodding. “Older than my family’s, even.”
nobody loves you. That ginger slag dumped you for Dean Sodding Thomas and now Draco’s told you he’s shagging another bloke. Poor Harry. Poor, poor Harry. My heart
“How was your weekend?” Harry asked, looking happy. Draco didn’t want to assume that Harry was happy to see
Above my brother,
“Yeah. I wouldn’t say I’m an expert or anything. But I know a bit.”
“How are you going to feel when you do?”
Draco looked around at the tables. You could see little differences at each: the degree to which they were richly dressed; whether they were populated by a mixture of races or genders; the way in which they interacted during the meal. Some tables were quiet, the soldiers conversing softly together. Some were rowdy, laughing. Lia’s Badgers were most certainly part of the latter group, even though Lia herself wasn’t particularly boisterous. He suspected Frankie’s presence as her second-in-command was responsible for it.
She waved and he watched her disapparate, and found himself getting teary-eyed, the way he sometimes did at drop off and pick up on the weekends he saw the kids. He didn’t know why, exactly – maybe he was just adjusting, still.
On New Years’ Day, Astoria sat him down at the kitchen table and told him loved him with all her heart, and she wanted a divorce.
Pansy picked up the blue satin dress and held it out to Draco. “Here, make yourself decent. We’ll levitate Potter back to the house and we can all sleep there. Luna said it’s fine.”
No, he would skip all that. He would take them to a place where the war was over, but Harry was his friend. His friend or…whatever they would be by then. If they were still friends at that point, and only friends, Draco was fairly certain he would be able to push them over the edge, and it would be delicious to fall together, to plummet into the unknown with Harry. To fall in love, together, properly.
“Repeatedly. Have I ever told you that you’re wrong, because
The wank would be worth it.
work for his sort.”
a hero. He remembered how angry Harry had gotten after Draco’d thanked him after the war and wondered, for the first time, whether he’d really exploded because he hated Draco. Was it possible that that
with Harry. “Er,” Harry said.
“You too,” muttered James, who seemed, suddenly, half-asleep.
“Goodbye, dear,” she said, giving a sassy little wave and putting out the flame. Draco sighed and slipped out of his jacket, throwing it onto the back of his couch. God, he needed a drink.
“Me too,” Pansy agreed, and went back to the kissing.
“Your cock is pointing to my thigh. Does that mean you want me to touch your thigh?”
Draco imagined, briefly, what it would be like to simply be some random bloke in Potter’s life, someone who could approach him in a club and snog the hell out of him. “And you liked it?”
Harry sighed. “Okay, that’s why you want to run
He looks at you strangely. “I asked you if there was anything else, didn’t I?”
His breath caught as he realized who was down there, pulling a tunic up over his head. It was Potter, his hair a smear of darkness against the pale glimmer of rock below him. His broad shoulders were bare as he reached down to tug off his trousers, and Draco pulled back behind the rock, breath caught in his throat.
widened your potential dating pool, have you not?” he asked.
“It would be my honor, Ronald!” exclaimed Harry, tackling Ron in a hug and then throwing him down onto the floor and pretending to punch him.
“Not our jurisdiction,” Harry said, kissing a line along his jaw. Draco felt his thoughts blurring, becoming indistinct, as desire flooded through him like a strong current of water, drowning everything else out. “But we could consult, I’m sure. Provide you defenseless little Unspeakables with muscle when you need it.”
Draco does what needs to be done at home
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
“Oh my god. He’ll hate it.”
Draco tugged at Harry, pulling him over himself, so that his body was half-draped over Draco's and Draco was looking up into his lovely, sleepy eyes, trailing his fingers over his cheek, still creased from the pillow. “How about you fuck me again, and then we’ll both be hungry enough for our own omelets and crepes?”
“Get married.”
“You’re not
“That was trippy. My god,” said Potter. “I feel so strange.”
a man other than Draco.
An image flashed through his head, of the night he was trying very hard not to remember, of Harry running a finger along his eyebrow, telling him about his eyes and his hair and how good he smelled. Telling him about the pink birthmark that he liked to kiss. Harry, falling against him in the Common Room, kissing his mouth. Harry, petting his hair until he fell asleep. Harry, telling him he was a good person. “Harry. I want Harry,” he said, and then froze and blinked. He hadn't meant to say it, hadn't thought he even had an answer. But now that he'd said it, everything seemed to click into place. It was obvious, wasn't it, what he really wanted.
Malfoy frowned. “You looked at my file?”
! I was trying to be nice, you arsehole! I was worried about you! I kept thinking somebody must’ve put something in your drink or something; you seemed so confused in the lifts the other day. I was
“Liar,” Harry said. “Tell me the truth.”
Great, thought Harry. The Weasley brother he’d lusted over was having a lot of one-on-one time with the Weasley brother he’d fucked around with. Nothing awkward about that.
No, now it was mostly horny thirty-plus-year-olds who wanted Harry to sign their posters, or their copy of that damn
They opened up one of the packages that was under stasis for dinner, and found that it was a chicken stir fry. It smelled heavenly, like ginger and soy and garlic, and Draco picked out a wine to go with it. They talked about their books as they ate. Harry was reading one of the muggle paperbacks he’d found, a thriller, and Draco was reading a thick book about the history of Maine, which looked boring as fuck. But as Draco talked about it, Harry found himself strangely intrigued, listening to how the state had been caught up in the struggle between the English and the French. He wasn’t sure if it was the story itself or the timbre and cadence of Draco’s voice that had him so interested.
in there, do you?” asked Draco.
Draco tried not to grimace. “Unfortunately, no,” he said. “The spell wasn’t included.  The plan is to keep looking today. It’s possible we might find it somewhere else, in some other text. If that doesn’t work, we’ll have to try to recreate the spell on our own. And that might take a while.”
. I can tell you’re worried about sleeping. You looked downright spooked when I mentioned going to bed. And I don’t understand it, but we seem to help each other sleep. We ought to just accept it. You have to admit, it would make life easier, if we were sleeping normally.”
“This is so shit,” Draco managed.
“I should, you’re right,” Draco said, unable to keep a straight face. It felt so good to be free of the thing, whatever it had been. “Um…” He gathered Sen and aimed it at Harry’s filthy tunic and a moment later, it was mostly clean.
have magic, don’t we, Draco? And so, when we do things like reproduce with the creatures, we might as well be mating with monkeys, because it is an enormous evolutionary step backwards.” He curled a lip. “And yes, I know about evolution, and not because of that Darwin fellow. Wizards knew about it millennia ago.”
Draco paused. “You’re mad.” He felt Harry stiffen. “You’re being serious?”
“Okay…”
The inter-house unity get-together was being held in the Common Room. The library had some libations available for those who wanted them, but Granger had insisted that they not make a big thing out of it or put too much pressure on anyone. Which, as much as Draco hated to admit it, seemed fair. Not everyone else was as keen on drinking away their brain cells as Draco and his friends.
“Please,” he heard himself whine after this had continued for too many agonizing minutes. He didn’t think he’d ever sounded like that before, so plaintive and desperate. “Please.”
Draco's eyes widened as he watched, and he grabbed Harry's hand. "Holy shit," he whispered.
slip me a roofie. I dunno. But it’s not – it’s nothing you need to worry about, okay, Malfoy?” He shoved his hands back in his pockets. He’d eaten maybe two bites of his sandwich. “And I’d appreciate it if you’d continue to keep your fucking mouth shut.”
After what felt like an eternity, the door swung open, and there stood Malfoy, in his white-collared shirt, unbuttoned, and his black trousers. His chest and his muscled abs were visible in a line down the center.
“No way.
He was in Malfoy Manor.
“I dunno. For being so kind through all this. For giving me those sodding kids. For everything. Thank you.”
From that very first year, it had been a raging success, and had helped catapult Draco and Astoria up to new heights of social influence. And that mattered to him, even though he knew it probably shouldn’t. He told himself it was for practical reasons, that being socially influential translated directly to being politically influential. But he knew, in his heart of hearts, that it also satisfied something in him, his deep-seated desire to be liked and admired. A weakness, he knew.
Harry glanced at Ari, then at Hermione and Ron and Sarah and Astoria. They were all looking pale and scared, and Astoria was crying silently, tears slipping out over her cheeks. “I think,” she whispered. “I think I need to talk to Daphne. I think she’ll know where he is.”
Their group rode south until they reached the border of Evenwood the following morning, and then camped until dusk. From that point on, they would be traveling under the cover of darkness and sleeping (or trying to sleep) in the daylight. If their group was caught on the way to Septerra, none of it would work, so they were being as careful as possible. They’d all traded their bright blue cloaks for black, to blend in with the night.
Harry shrugged. “Tired, I s’pose. These kinds of days wear me out.”
Ginny nodded. Even though they’d not been allowed to participate, they had listened in on the plans.

A look of relief washed over Potter’s face. “You grew up knowing you were one, then? A wizard?” Potter asked.

a big deal. I always slept with Hermoine and Ron when we were in the Forest of Dean. It helped us get through that. And with Ginny, sleeping with her had the same effect. It’s a thing, Malfoy. It helps.”
Niran pulled Draco up against his muscley chest. The muscles were too well-defined to have come from any natural sort of activity. Niran probably spent a lot of time in a gym. Draco didn’t usually like that, but tonight it seemed okay. Niran’s lips met Draco’s, and they were incredibly soft, and really full, and fucking hell, he tasted a bit like dessert. Draco’s skin felt so sensitive everywhere, and his mouth felt like it was bursting with sunshine where Niran’s tongue brushed against it.
Harry saw Blaise approach them afterward, and they talked for a long time.
After the kiss, Draco began acting differently. It wasn’t that he was avoiding Harry or anything, but their interactions were strange, lacking the flirty banter and easy familiarity that they usually had. Harry wanted to kick himself. He’d analyzed their conversation a million times, and had talked it over with Hermione, too, but still couldn’t fully make sense of it. Sometimes, he was sure that Draco liked him and wanted to be with him, and sometimes he thought that was only wishful thinking on his part, and Draco truly wanted to be friends and nothing more.
Dominic looked slightly less annoyed as he looked over Cian, who was wearing a very tight t-shirt.
“I’m sticking with whiskey, but thanks,” said Harry to Pansy.
“How do you two not weigh a hundred stone each?” Pansy asked incredulously.
Draco felt Potter’s breath against his lips, and Potter’s arms were suddenly wrapped around him, anchoring him. “But it’s not all bad. Because see, the thing is, despite how much I suck, I think he might be a little bit in love with me, too.”
“I believe you,” Frankie said, frowning back at him. “But there are those who are much more superstitious. Obviously.”
“I went back to first year. Before first year. I went back to the very beginning.”
They spent every summer up in Maine for the next seven years. And then Greg had to go and have a goddamned heart attack and die. Linda was so mad at him for it, she could spit. The Florida house was bad enough without him, but she couldn’t bring herself to return to Lubec. It had been Greg’s favorite place. She would miss him too much if she went.
Draco laughed a little, leaning back in his chair. “I mean, really though, I don’t hate Theo. I really don’t want him to be Minister, but it’s not as though I don’t understand why he is the way he is.”
Euri shrugged. “I don’t know. It’s been a strange few months.”
Draco just about fell over. “Sounds like it,” he said in a strangled voice. And then he decided it probably meant nothing, that Harry had somehow seen into another timeline, and besides, here was better.
“I’d take a gin and tonic, if you’ve got it,” Harry offered.
“Mother and Andromeda, they’ve patched things up,” Draco explained.
“Want to get pissed?”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And this is why we pay to keep our own security detail. Because there are plenty of psychos out there.” He clacked his fingernails against the desk. “Was everyone okay? Tell me nobody got hurt.”
“It was hardly obvious,” Potter said, echoing Draco’s earlier words and looking him strangely. “I thought he might have.”
“Uh-huh,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “Have fun getting fucked in the loo. Or wherever you two perverts wind up this time.”
him to stay?”
Then, at four-thirty, nearly an hour and a half after the last text:
He looked first at the Auror table; he couldn’t help it. Potter didn’t seem to be there and Draco didn’t know if that made him feel relieved or not. “Hermione,” he whispered. “Is Ron coming tonight?”
“You…what? Up
Pansy murmured something about, “How can I if Draco’s always in your bed,” and there was some more laughter, but Harry was already following Malfoy out of the room.
Draco sighed. “Not really. He’s very upset – obviously. And he seems all up in his own head at the moment.”
“You are,” Harry agreed. “And I love you.”
“Back at you,” Draco said, throwing up a finger, before rushing out onto the grounds.
“No,” said Harry, tugging on his ear. He was jiggling his leg even faster than usual. “A friend of a friend’s holiday cottage, in the Cotswolds.”
Pansy giggled.
Draco felt his mouth fall open. After a moment, he gathered himself together enough to cry, “You can’t be serious!”
“Well, I’m not, certainly not any time recently – nothing worth noting, anyway. So I’ve got to live vicariously through you, dear. How’d this happen, then? Did you set up a secret rendezvous? Did it feel terribly French?”
He returned to his shop feeling that it had worked beautifully. No one had suspected. Additionally, since he’d rendered his face a little friendlier, less sharp, people seemed naturally inclined to smile at him, to say hello. It was perfect.
“Then…how?” Draco asked.
“Hey, douchebag,” she said.
something, and then you told me it didn’t. Then you told me I ought to fuck the guy I used to have a crush on. So I did, and then you crawled all over
“And…well, I think that’s mostly it.”
“And he doesn’t mind about…this?”
“Draco!” Harry’s voice cried, panicked, and then the thing was yelping as a blade swung at it and forced it away from Draco.  It leapt back onto its feet, snarling at Harry. Harry lunged at it, drawing blood, and then he dodged away from its teeth. He threw himself forward again, swinging his sword, and his sword got another bite in, but before he drew back, the wolf managed to catch his shoulder with its fearsome claws, and he fell.
“Time?”
Finally, he straightened and took a swig of water from the hose that extended from his backpack. “It’s beautiful,” he said, looking around. “Even if it has way too many hills.”
“Well,” Harry said, trailing his hand over the fabric of Draco’s shirt. “At least we’re here now. Together.”
He didn’t want to think about the night he and Ginny broke up. Dear god, he really didn’t, but it the memories were swirling around in his head anyway. What there was of them.
“Well, you obviously…you used to be a lot more adventurous. Before me, I mean. And you still clearly like that stuff, right? It still gets you hot and bothered. I just don’t want…I just don’t want you to get bored of this. Of me.”
And then, after telling Luna and Hermione, he went home with Cian, who lived in a little flat absolutely covered in football posters, and let Cian put his mouth on his cock. Cian was quite good at it, and his good nature extended to the bedroom, so that they were able to laugh and joke a bit even while it was happening. Harry returned the favor, and it was the first time he’d ever gone down on a man, although he didn’t tell Cian that, of course. It was strange, but not in a bad way. His jaw ached a little after.
“I love you,” Harry said, and Draco’s serious mouth broke out into a broad smile. “I love you, and I’ve loved you since I was eighteen. I’ve never wanted anyone else, not really, and now, after
Harry didn’t end up picking up a random man that night, just as he knew he wouldn’t. He and Ron did wind up getting good and pissed, though, walking back to Ron’s in the wee hours, staggering through the puddled streets, the streetlights buzzing up above them. They collapsed onto Ron’s couches, probably reeking of booze. As they were falling asleep, Ron turned to Harry. “D’you know what’s funny? That I’m a dad. And that I’m Head Auror. I dunno what I’m doing half the time, Harry, why the fuck do people trust me with these things?”
Draco laughed and turned his head to kiss Harry for a moment. “He’s bloody gorgeous. I can’t believe you’ve kept him to yourself all this time, Harry,” he said, his voice warm and teasing, his eyes flickering back to Charlie’s body, which was now sprawled out on the bed. “It was very selfish of you.”
“Oh, well. In that case, it was…interesting, I guess. Seeing you.”
actually the worst?”
Draco found himself blinking away tears, as a hot rush came over him. “Okay,” he said.
“I KNOW!” he cried when the room had reached a fever-pitch. Everyone was quiet for a moment, and then Harry stomped out into the yard.
Well, that was fucking fast. “Good,” Harry said.
is your punishment, Draco. That feeling. Worse than death, sometimes.”
stomach, like Harry did, but he would very much like to find out at some point.
