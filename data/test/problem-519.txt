“So that’s what you think, that I’d just up and leave if I got you pregnant.” Draco spat. “Wow, you think so highly of me.”
Harry scowled. He was 18 now, old enough to make his own decisions and he was sick of other people choosing his path in life. He wasn’t about to let Snape make this one for him. He pushed Ron and Hermione to the side, and opened the living room door. The three men turned to him in shock, but he just glared at Snape, holding back tears that threatened to fall and embarrass him.
Harry nodded and hugged his dad goodnight. It was nice to have a dad, someone who’s always there for you, whenever you need them. Harry left Snape in peace and headed back the dorm, hoping he wouldn’t have to explain his disappearing act to his no doubt pissed off roommate.
He let out a shaky breath and I felt encouraged. I wanted to say more, to drive him wild with words like he can do with his mouth. But I didn't know what to say. But then I thought of something that might make him shiver. The only worry was that the slow pace, which was getting better and better, would be too distracting that it wouldn't work. I said sexy in Parseltongue. He moaned loudly and snapped his hips forward. It was harsh but good. Really good.
“Neither is hurting yourself,” Harry scowled. “You should give it a try none the less, and maybe they like you back.”
Always the mother hen. Harry tried to calm her by letting her know he’d have his wand with him, and if he could fight off Death Eaters, he could handle Malfoy. She didn’t look happy, quite the opposite really, but she let him go, and he practically ran up the deserted staircases, up to the hallway outside the room in question. Malfoy wasn’t there, and the hairs on Harry’s neck stood up. Was Harry playing into Malfoy’s hands? Pacing past the spot where the doorway should be, Harry tried to think of a setting where he could talk with Malfoy, a place they would be comfortable and he could get what he wanted out of his blonde informant.
Sirius mumbled curse words, stressing about a ‘pointless paternity test’. Harry’s world slowed as he pieced together the words, and he thought...he didn’t know what to think. On the one hand, Harry had looked up to James Potter his whole life, making him proud was the reason he fought so hard in the war. And he looked just like him. But James was dead, if he wasn’t Harry’s biological dad, maybe his dad was still alive. Maybe he had a chance to know him, to have a dad for once. He was so emotionally confused in minutes.
Hermione was very tense as he walked towards the kitchens, "I don't like it. You should just wait, or it'll encourage Ron to do the same."
He jumped out of his skin, and I chuckled past the ache in my throat at his shocked expression. He smiled the brightest I'd ever seen, lighting up his whole face and leaned in to kiss me gently on the forehead. He called out to Sirius, which surprised me enough to try and sit up, hurting myself in the process. Draco helped me out gently, using my pillows to support my back. I was concerned to see him be so tender, he was never even like this with friends, never so sweet. Sirius came up beside him and grabbed me in a forceful hug. My body ached some more, and I had to guess that it was because I'd been out for long enough to make my muscles tense.
I dropped down to sit beside Pansy, probably with the goofiest smile on my face, because she and Blaize were looking at me in confusion. I shrugged, insisting that if they were going to attempt to ask me any questions to do so before the judgemental comments, whilst I was still in a good mood. Blaize just shook his head, ensuring that my crush on Harry was my business, so he was gonna try not to say anything. That's why I was close to Blaize. He knows when not to push me. But Pansy wasn't quite the same.
. He'd only had it once at Christmas, but his dad enjoyed having Baileys in his coffee at dinner parties. Neville wouldn't own up, and neither would I. Just in case any of them were my soon-to-be pen pal.
Then I started thinking of the worst. Like he was avoiding me. Or he was with someone else, that thought nearly brought me to tears in Transfiguration. Or a death eater could have found their way into the school because Dumbledore wasn't there, and was torturing him to avenge Voldemort. Sure, it was far-fetched, but I was panicking. I held everything, but Potions was the last straw. It was his favourite subject, he was the best in the class, yet he wasn't in the room. That was as much as I could take.
"I don't want to talk about any of that. Not a lot of happy stories." He frowned, and Draco tried not to tighten his hold on the boy's hand. He was already getting territorial over the sweet omega. "I had to sneak out to come here, which isn't very proper, but it was the only way I'd be able to come. My aunt would never be seen next to me."
The only spot left was between Neville and a Hufflepuff I didn't know. The professor wasn't in the classroom yet, so I took my chances that sitting there wouldn't be an issue. He smiled as I dropped my bag, but there was a nervous undertone to his eyes. It was a look he usually only had around Snape and McGonagall. I wrote a small note, asking if he was okay. Neville probably wouldn't open up to me, but he definitely wouldn't if someone could hear. I tried not to raise my eyebrows as he scrawled a response underneath it.
"Thank you. If I'm allowed to ask, why GreenLion31? I mean, ClassicGemini was a birthday pun, since that's my sign. Pansy had shown me horoscopes and I thought 'Adaptable, outgoing, intelligent, indecisive and nosy' were traits that fit me pretty well."
Harry left the buffet table and searched around for Draco, but his boyfriend was nowhere to be seen. He asked Pansy if she knew where he went, and she smiled that Theodore Nott took him outside to speak to him about something supposedly important. Harry thanked her, and headed for the door, leaving the Great Hall. He looked left down at the empty, cold corridor, and when he turned right he wished he hadn’t.
“Wow, that’s great,” Harry grinned, talking over the huge bit of pork pie in his mouth. “I’ll go tell Draco the good news. See you later.”
I'm posting the first three chapters together because I want more of a taster chunk. So people can get into the story, but also the concept of the series. I hope you enjoyed it!!
The message then began to repeat. My aunt looked smug as she headed to the horses first, telling a neighbouring woman it was her intuition that led her this way before the announcement. Which wasn't accurate, it was her impatience and plan to go home and sulk that had led her back to the carriages. But Harry did his job, carrying the shopping and heading to pass it to the footman, Ron. He and Harry became good friends as they rode on the back of the carriage together, so he didn't have to run behind. Ron was an alpha, Hermione's alpha in fact, and it was usually these rides back when Harry gave him advice on how to apologise if he needed to. Which wasn't often, thank goodness. Someone in that house needed a little happiness.
The Great Hall erupted in whispers as Harry strode to the stool, and before the hat was actually placed on his head, it called out Slytherin. The Gryffindor Table gasped, the whole hall did, and the whispers got louder. But Harry refused to acknowledge it, as he headed over to his table and sat down next to a shocked Neville, who clearly wasn’t worried about himself anymore.
At first, Harry had worried. He didn't have the best self-esteem, the alpha was the first person to give him a heartfelt compliment. It seemed very possible to him that maybe it was just him who felt like the other scented as mate. And that was enough to break his heart and send him on a garden walk. But that was where he found his alpha, discussing wedding plans with his mother to rush everything along, and the look he gave Harry was full of adoration. And just like that, all the negativity fell away. He blushed and tried to contain how much his omega preened under his alpha's smile. Just like that, it went from a depressing walk to a joyous skip through the flowers.
When Harry woke up the following morning, Draco wasn’t in bed. He turned his head to see Draco getting his school uniform together. In his underwear. Harry’s eyes were drawn to the blonde’s ass, and how firm in looked. Harry desperately wanted to go over and grab it but restrained himself. He wanted to talk to his father about it before he acted on anything.
Dudley was sulking, biting his lip and refusing to look. Pheobe looked almost pleased, but most likely because her brother wasn't marrying a prince. And Petunia, scowl cutting across her face and vein twitching in her forehead, was the picture of anger. It reminded the prince that the estate belonged to Harry's father, and it could be returned to him as his birthright. An omega might not own land, but a prince certainly could. The three fools' faces merged to the same expression. Fear. But his omega shrugged.
I finished writing and waited. Rereading my entry, my eyes widened. I threw the journal across the room in my panic. I'm so stupid. That sounds like I would keep the card. I let my guard down and just wrote what I thought, and now he'll know. Unless I struck gold and got someone as stupid as I must be to have written that, he'll know it's me for sure.
A few weeks in, Dumbledore announced he was leaving on Ministry business, but privately warned me that he was cutting loose strings so we could be rid of Voldemort for good. He declined my offer for help but warned there was something important I needed to help with eventually, so I should take the opportunity to enjoy my first Voldemort free school year. I was grateful for that. He left Professor McGonagall as interim Headmistress, which was a relief for those who suspected he'd leave Snape in charge. The man hadn't stopped glaring at me since me and Draco went public, and Draco hadn't explained his behaviour. I didn't feel comfortable enough to ask, not that it really mattered. I could probably guess, and turns out I was right.
I threw the card to the table and grabbed the box. Ron's gaze followed me, while Hermione plucked the card up to read. I lifted the lid and was hit by a beautiful smell. The colours were soft but bright. Yellow roses, white tulips and others I didn't know. But they were beautiful and smelt divine. Wrapped at the bottom of the box was treacle tart candies. Turns out more went into his apology than I assumed.
I prepared myself for the worst, as Neville looked down in confusion. I was ready to drop things with Neville, so he could live his life and act his age when he looked back up with tears in his eyes and a huge smile spread across his face. I didn’t understand.
Harry nodded, rubbing his eyes. Draco placed the back of his hand against Harry’s head, checking for a fever. Harry slapped it away with a smile, but Draco just glared. Harry kissed him lightly, promising him he was alright. Draco loosened up, bringing Harry in for a bigger kiss. He asked Harry why he’d been cooped up in his room all day if he wasn’t sick.
Hermione shook her head slowly. "He helped, so maybe don't talk about him like that. I saw him in Diagon Alley and he wasn't that bad. He insulted me sure but didn't call me a mudblood or anything, just made fun of my hair a bit, and I'm taking that as a sign that he's grown as a person."
I'm losing my love of this story, but just leaving it doesn't seem right when I know people want to see an end to this. I know the ending is rushed but it was a happy conclusion and I might revisit to write an epilogue someday. Sorry, but this is it.
Thanks for reading, hope you're enjoying it, I'll try to update as soon as possible. Please drop a review to let me know if you like it and if you have any suggestions for character development.
"Harry maybe?" Hermione spoke up, drawing both of their attentions. "I mean, he'll need proper clothes at a royal ball."
The blonde's mouth bobbed fast and he sucked hard, fingers stretching and caressing a spot in Harry that made his toes curl. He felt his orgasm building, so much sweeter than when he's doing it himself. Except all the sensations left at once.
And Harry couldn't hold back. "What's wrong?! You can stand there and ask that after trying to pull me off to dance, not even letting me speak long enough to say no. I may just be some omega to an alpha like you, but that doesn't mean I will be ignored like that. I'm feeling enough stress as it is."
"You need not apologise, you were right. I felt you were going to decline, but I was too determined to dance with you. I'm used to things going my way, I'm not used to people saying no to me. I'm glad you spoke up. In fact, I'd rather you forget what you just heard and forget I'm a prince. I want you to be yourself, to act natural with me."
“But it still might not be true,” I said to myself. “I have to know, it’ll eat away at me inside if I don’t.”
I looked away from him. I hoped for him to give up and just leave, but after what I'd heard it was beyond stupid. He didn't push, he stayed quiet and just let me sit there looking at the rug. The only thing he did was throw his arms up after 10 minutes and sat down in one of the chairs facing me. We were sat in awkward silence for half an hour before I couldn't take it and asked him to leave. He said he'd walk out peacefully and never bother me or talk to me again if that was what I wanted, but not before I gave him the honest reason. He warned me he could tell when I lied, so there was no point saying I didn't want him anymore or some other bullshit.
It's 2:18 am, I can't be asked to proof-read this. Sorry for the mistakes, I might correct it someday lol. ╮ (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) ╭
Snape took Harry back home and agreed to meet him on Platform 9 3/4 the following day. Harry hugged him, taking Snape by surprise, and hurried back inside to the warm, and to his dinner, leaving his father stunned by shock on the doorstep.
His parting words made me chuckle. It was the sort of comment I'd expect from a Slytherin, but with ClassicGemini attitude. But when it was for Malfoy's benefit, I wasn't going to pay any extra. He likes chocolate, I'll just get those. Not like he deserves much more, not for what he said.
I tilted my head at him, forgetting what he was doing, but thankfully only seeing him snap the elastic of his bottoms to his waist. God, his skin truly was flawless. I should stop looking at his body and try to get to know him. He was right when he said I don't him at all.
He didn't respond. Only the tightening of his grip on the kettle showed me he'd even heard me. That just made my anger worse, because I was justifiably pissed over Ron and he was ignoring me. I stormed over to take the kettle out of his hands. He crossed his arms over his chest but still didn't answer me. He didn't look at me either. He asked what I was waiting for him to say, and my voice rose as I demanded he explains why he was isolating me to him.
It surprised him that Dudley couldn't carry his own shoes, then again his body was fat, not muscle mass. Harry had more muscle mass than was expected of an omega, they were usually dainty and delicate. The strongest part should be the hips if he was going to be strong enough to carry babies. But after all the housework that had been forced on him from a young age, he had built up a little muscle in his arms and legs too. Dudley was just fed nonsense whenever he asked, you might think he was already with child. Certainly not the attractive omega his mother always called him.
He pushed his robes off his shoulders and slowly started to undo his buttons. Harry’s eyes couldn’t help but follow Draco’s hands down his torso, biting his lip and groaning at Draco seductive smile. Soon enough, Draco opened his shirt, showing off his muscled body. He reached out to Harry, who stood up mesmerised, and Draco moved Harry’s hand to brush over his body.
Harry couldn't even feel himself being moved, all his senses zoning in on the hands on his waist or his alpha's breath on his ear. He needed something, something more than hands on his clothed waist. He felt like he was on fire, he needed his clothes off. Although, Draco almost dropped him when Harry squirmed to undo the buttons on his frock coat. And while he knew his omega couldn't be comfortable, the eager whining was making it hard for the alpha not to chuckle. And the panting on his neck was making other things hard.
"They pride themselves on being ordinary, my uncle sells drills or something and my aunt is a housewife and my cousin's a secret pervert who used to force me to kiss him in private, but I was the freak who reminded them there was another world out there, so they treated me like a freak. I actually didn't know my name until primary school because they never used it, I was 'Freak' or 'Boy' to them. For the first 11 years of my life, my bedroom was a little cupboard under the stairs, with locks on the outside so I couldn't sneak out to the kitchen if they punished me by starving me for a few days. That why I was so scrawny and short for the first couple of years here. They beat me, and neglected me, and psychologically damaged me. They're pretty shitty people, but I'll never have to see them again now that Dumbledore's actually seen what they've been doing to me. I'm living with Sirius now."
An uneasy combination of relief and excitement wired my body at his answer. I wasn't expecting a declaration of love or anything close, but having my interest returned made my heart race. It made it seem like endless potential leaked out of his words. I admitted to him how whenever he was sarcastic or witty my mind tried to imagine his mouth shaping the words or smirking like most Slytherins. I never thought to imagine more than his lips, meaning my mind mostly wondered to how soft they would feel if we kissed. He said he'd also thought of what a kiss would feel like between us, or the feel of my hair. He admitted the thought of running his fingers in my hair was really appealing to him.
Sirius hugged me just beside the train. We stood on platform 9 3/4, embraced for everyone to see. Apparently, they'd found Peter Pettigrew when they captured the unconscious Voldemort, so they knew he wasn't killed by Sirius 16 years ago. They knew Sirius was innocent. So, it was okay that we could act like family in public. It all made life so much happier. It was only at night when the problems started, and I was consumed by my nightmares. The nightmares messed with my minds, and they made me feel weak, so I punished myself. It was wrong and unhealthy, I already knew this. But it made me feel better. As my blood oozed from my arm, it seemed to slow my heart and calm me down. The masochist in me enjoyed it, so my nightmares were less of a problem than they used to be.
Her brows furrowed, "I know it's actually pretty common, and not widely accepted by a lot of bigoted people. But it's not a bad thing. But that's all I know really. I accept it, if you were worrying."
Dudley's face went pink, the usual colour he went when he was offended by something. Usually the buttons on old clothes not going up. Aunt Petunia stepped in, reminding them that heat can shrink. She had already drawn up a plan to fool the prince's men. They know they're looking for an omega male, so Dudley was right that it couldn't be Pheobe. And she was also right that Dudley's fingers were a little wide. So she was going to put Dudley's hands in hot water, and keep them there until the royal guard started up the hill. They were the first house they'd come to, to they'd need the extra time to prepare the garden.
It was comforting that she'd seen through my calm disguise, or maybe she knew something wasn't right because I was quiet for once. I thought that if Neville, of all people, found it in him to write out a message or reply for whoever, then I should as well. I wasn't a shy person, the kind of boy to care about what someone thought of me, but I'd turned myself into that person now. I'd built the idea in my head, so now it felt as important as cutting the right wire of a bomb. And Neville was already writing when I got in the room.
He pulled back in surprise, but his smile stayed in place as he enquired to what he was doing in my dream to make me groan. I stammered a no, and the pressure was back on my junk, and his lips were on my neck. I made another pathetic whining noise, and his lips travelled lower, so I tilted my head so he could carry on. He was getting me so heated too easily. But once again he stopped to get me to answer, and I knew I'd need to describe my dream to get him to carry on, so I started talking with the brightest blush spread across my face.
Don't forget to review, and let me know how good/bad you think it's going, cause I always seem to think it's worse than it is. I hope to update soon, but Sixth Form is a busy time, so please don't get butt hurt if this takes a while, I hope it won't either. XD
Harry woke up after hearing a loud noise, and when his eyes flew open, he noticed Draco standing at the door, with Ron and Hermione behind him, their faces covered in fear and concern. Ron tried to get in past Draco, and Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but Draco moved in and closed the door in their faces. When he turned back to face his lover, his face was covered in relief, and he came to wrap his arms around Harry.
I stood there in shock as Harry screamed in pain, and I just didn’t know what to do. Professor Snape rushed to his son’s side, just as Harry passed out. Everyone in the classroom gaped, and Snape yelled at them all to leave but stopped me when I tried. I insisted I had nothing to do with it, and that Harry had been ignoring me all day, so I couldn’t have done anything.
Fingers closed into a fist in his hair and yanked Harry up. He was being passionately kissed suddenly and pushed to his feet. Malfoy pulled him over to the bed, and Harry landed on his back. He felt exposed to the blonde, but the lust in the other boy's eyes made his skin start tingling.
Harry thought that over and agreed, they’d been as bad as each other over the years. But still, soulmate was a bit hard to believe, they were barely friends. Harry asked his dad about his soulmate, and Snape acknowledged that he’d met his special person, but that he’d never acted on it.
I shook as I headed to Professor Snape’s office, wondering what I’d done to make him want to see me. I frowned as I relived the day in my head, and I remembered he caught me staring at him, well his butt anyway. I couldn’t explain what had happened in fourth year, but since then I’ve been looking at my professor a lot more, and not just his face. When I got to the door, I knocked gently and stood there as Snape opened it.
My hands shook as I reread the letter. I stared at Lily’s elegant script, but couldn’t wrap my head around the words. It didn’t make sense, none of it made sense. He looked so much like James, he had to be his son, so there was no other possibility. James' face with Lily's eyes, everyone had said it. Then why did Lily sound so sure in her letter, so sure that James couldn’t have kids? It was all just too crazy. Harry couldn’t be my son, it was biologically impossible.
Draco came in, rubbing his left eye and carrying a glass of water. He looked me over. Tear-stained cheeks, hazy eyes and my wand pressed over old scars. He opened his mouth, probably to yell at me as his eyebrows curved down, but then the tears started again. I was relieved he hadn't felt. Ecstatic over how confused and angry he looked over seeing me this way. I let my doubts get to me, but once again he had proved them all wrong. I put my wand back on the table and held my arms open for him.
Wide eyes shot to the side, watching the fuzzy-haired maid lead a young man towards him. His hair was messier, and his green eyes glowed in nervous anticipation, but there was no mistaking it was his beautiful Harry. The omega smiles slightly and the last of the tension released from his body. He couldn't stop his actions, taking the ring from a guard and running to meet Harry in the middle. He manages to just hold onto enough control to keep up formalities. Harry raised his hand so Draco could slide the ring into place with a smile.
”Can’t blame him. All those families pictures must have taken their toll on our saintly little orphan.”
"I knew it was you, Harry. Or I suspected, what with you keeping the owl drawing." I could hear the smirk in his voice before it turned quiet. "Do be mad when you turn around okay? Just give me a chance."
He'd found Ron and Hermione out for a walk also, and asked his friends if Draco's distance was an alpha thing that he'd have to get used to. Hermione gave the romantic answer, about Draco wanting the day to be perfect and throwing himself into planning so he could marry Harry as soon as possible and be together forever. But before Harry could sit in the happy fantasy that he was soon marrying his mate, Ron added his thoughts.
I broke out in relieved laughter, kissing my mate, saying he was good for me. Neville blushed and wanted to know if I wanted to be with him forever. I smiled that I couldn’t think of anything that would make me happier, and he dropped down onto one knee.
"Okay, keep your mouth shut because I'm going to rant. You don't get to make that decision for me, I'm my own person and have my own free-will, and I want to be with you as long as you want me. Not you don't want me to lower my standards or whatever, but because you look at me and feel nothing." He smiled, brushing a tear I didn't even notice from my cheek. "Fuck my godfather and his prejudice opinions. Some people don't think I'm good enough for you, Ron beat you down for it remember? But neither of us need a perfect partner, we need someone who makes us feel happy and safe, and wanted. That's how you make me feel when you aren't kicking me out, and I like to think I make you feel like that. So fuck other people, we'll support each other, and Hermione supports us, so don't give up. We have more of a chance than you're letting yourself believe."
"Well I'm yours, and I guess now is special enough to tell you that you were wrong this morning. I wanted to make it special when I told I love you too."
I was the first one there, taking the opportunity to set down the picnic blanket and wondering what to do or say when he finally showed up. My back was to the mouth of the cave, allowing someone to sneak up on me and loop their fingers under my glasses to cover my eyes. The shock only lasted a second before excitement set in and I giggled. I heard a gentle laugh behind me and felt the familiar warmth spread through my chest.
The omega jumped at the unfamiliar voice, turning in shock to the man standing over him. He was huge, far taller and broader than any man Harry had seen before. He had wild, bushy hair that tangled with his fuzzy beard. His eyes could barely be seen and his mouth was hidden in all the hair. If it hadn't been for the neutral beta scent surrounding the giant, Harry would have started to completely panic.
Things were going spectacularly. My days were spent with Hermione, sitting together before class and during lunch, sometimes followed by Brown and Pavarti. I spent my free time after dinners with Draco. To begin with, the attraction was really sexual and not much else, but now I was getting to know him. We'd talk during our evenings together, and I'd found out more about him than what I wanted to know before. I found out how he had the house to himself because his parents are in Paris for the foreseeable future, and that he was lonely, but his friends were trying to keep him cheered up. It was cute to know him emotionally, and I felt like I could understand him better. All his reactions come from a deeply emotional place but are twisted by his mind and his father's words. But he can just let his emotions out now, with me. And he'd found out more about my opinions and feelings over everything, getting to know each other openly. Our bond was deepening. Ron hadn't said a word to me, either because Dumbledore had expressly told him not to, or the icy glares from Hermione and Draco whenever he came my way.
Snape thought for a moment, “I’m going to lock you two in here because you need to resolve your issues.”
"And," he smirked, settling behind Harry, pressing his bare front to his omega's back. "Been slick and loose from heat means I can slide right in."
"So, when did that start?" She questioned, "I didn't hear anything about you being together, your feelings requited, and that?"
I knew he meant it as a joke, but it was sudden, and something I actually wanted to hear. The redness in my cheeks showed him what I was thinking, and I felt the urge to run. But even then, I couldn't escape the embarrassment. I hated being such an open-book. His cool fingers curled under my chin and lifted my head to meet his eyes, which sparkled in the sun. His voice was low and husky when he asked if I wanted him to push his luck, which only made my blushing intensify. I did want that, and I knew he was so attractive, but I'd actually only ever kissed my cousin, and that was forceful and not something I bothered trying to be good at, so what if I was no good at it now.
He collapsed next to me. I said he loved me again and thanked me for letting him have me as no one had before.
The huge man roared, clapping and thanking Hermione for reminding him what he'd forgotten to do. He turned to Harry, with a big smile and rubbing his hands together. It made a jolt of worry run through Harry. He wasn't sure if Hagrid knew what was appropriate to wear at a royal masquerade.
I scrawled the message at the dinner table and hid the journal again. I waited until I got to my dorm room. Waited through Ron's blathering and Hermione's lecturing. Waited t get in my bedclothes and into bed. Then I read his reply.
It made me chuckle. I wasn't the only person nervous about this project, or the only one using it to be themselves without risk. I did close off when I knew he was serious about being a Slytherin, but Benylin had been right about prejudice keeping houses apart. This guy seemed nice enough. Give him the chance to be a bigoted asshole before just shutting him down for being one. I had to be a big person, like they were being. I needed to wait a moment to think through what I wanted to say. I wanted to make a good first impression.
"Harry, I won't leave until you ask me to, whether that means I'm here for an hour or a month. I'm here for you."
"It's okay, but can we not talk about it in a crowded classroom," Draco suggested. "I don't know about your friends, but I know Blaise is eavesdropping whenever he can, so we should talk later."
I felt his grin against my neck and the warmth of his breath on my skin. How was it so easy for him to seduce me? It shouldn't be, not by a long shot. But each brush of pink lips made me shiver and want more. I wanted to feel more than his lips on my neck, I wanted them across the rest of my body. And I couldn't stand the light pressure on my crotch anymore, I needed more from him. He pressed a kiss to my ear as he asked if I'd ever tried anything with anyone. I felt shame creep through me and tensed. How do I explain how forced kisses came with forced handjobs?
There was a sharp pain between Harry's legs, but he tried to stay relaxed against it. The blonde moved slowly, gently, trying not to cause too much pain to the virgin under him. That little sweet spot was given enough attention that the pain was bearable. Harry was honestly shocked by how tender the other boy was, giving him time to adjust to having something go in his ass rather than come out, but also how he moved slowly until Harry was ready. The sweet kisses along Harry's shoulder, and the hands rubbing soothing circles on Harry's thighs. It was just so nice, but not quite enough.
“Just assuming your right,” Draco frowned sceptically. “How does that have anything to do with why Harry passed out?”
I blinked, trying to stop my vision being so blurred. The Infirmary, great. My right hand felt warmer than my left, which had me turning my head in confusion, regardless of my stiff neck's complaining. There was a halo of bright blonde hair resting on my hand, the warmth coming from Draco's soft, steady breaths. I wondered if he was asleep, flexing my fingers against the soft skin of his face, not that I had much control over where I was touching. But I really liked how smooth his skin was, I want to see how flawless the rest of it would be.
"We are learning about psychology. The question was slightly different, but it stems down to social psychology."
I kept my eyes down as frowned, working out if there was enough space between Blaise and the hedges for me to slip passed him. It wasn't likely. He stepped closer to me, tipping my head up with a finger under my chin. He smirked, the curve of his lips a magnet he uses on his many admirers. I felt like a deer in the headlight, except it wasn't just fear to hold me in place.
The thought of some Slytherin's being secretly accepting seemed to cheer her up slightly. She promised to keep the idea in the back of her mind when any of them said something. It warmed my heart that I'd been able to offer her some comfort, or Gemini had. I felt weird sharing how great a guy he was with someone else, but it made me proud too. Proud I knew someone good like that. It was weird. And it reminded me of something else weird on the way to Potions.
His father nodded, turning to the steward and demanding an announcement was written up urgently. It needed to be called out across the town in the morning, that the prince would be travelling house to house, asking the male omegas to try on the ring, so Draco could determine if they were the beauty behind the green mask that he would make his bride. The prince didn't know how to react, hearing his father practically give his blessing.
I blushed at the openness of that question. I was acting so bashful, which isn't me at all, and he's relishing my embarrassment. Prick. I demanded he kiss my body, like the night before. I said I wanted to feel his lips worship my body as his fingers opened my hole for him. I turned the heat of my words on him, and he groaned.
Snape explained that because Harry had turned 18, he’d reached his full demonic growth, and now the demon half of him was surfacing. He’d already met the wings and seemed to control them well, his eyes would turn red when he was angry, scared or panicked, any intense negative emotions, but he’d also start to feel drawn to someone. Harry didn’t understand the last part, seen as he hadn’t felt any different toward anyone. Snape explained that demons had a sense for people, they could find their perfect mate or soulmate, and that person would become very special to him. He'd just want to be near them, to spend his life with them in whatever way he was allowed, though he'd want to intimate with them.
“And you’ve done the same.” Severus reasoned. “Every time he insulted you, you retaliated, and vice versa.”
My last lesson was Defence Against the Dark Arts, one I shared with Draco. It would be another chance to see him again, and it brightened my grin. Just thinking about him made me happier now, cos he gave me the hope for a happier future than I ever thought I deserved. Seeing him sat on a desk talking to Blaise, looking relaxed and cool, I blushed as I thought about how desperately I wanted him. I sat between Hermione and Ron but couldn't prevent myself from peaking up at him. He glanced my way, and we were stuck in the moment for a while before Snape stood in the way. I propped my elbow on the table and rested my head in my hand. Being so happy was making me feel drowsy.
"I know the name of this says 'Club', but I think we all figured out that this is just like a subject. Including homework." She smiled at our groans of displeasure. "But I've arranged to have the year's homework to be a special project so it works out to be more fun. Taking inspiration from the Muggle concept of Pen Pals, you will write anonymous letters to another member of the class to try and build a friendship outside your house."
The idea sounded too good to be true but excited Harry nonetheless. He nodded as they walked off, his cousins complaining as his mother brushed the idea off. It was a trap or a trick, but there was a chance he could do this. He had more of the house cleaned than they knew, Hermione had started when he had to go into town. And Dudley would be easy to get ready, Harry had had to help him enough times before. It was his clothes that posed the biggest problem, but even that could be fixed, he was sure. This was his chance, his friends would help him. Now maybe there'd be someone else in the house that was happy.
I kept my mouth shut at breakfast, and when Professor McGonagall checked our NEWT lessons, adding Potions to my list so I can be an Auror. I sat silently through Transfiguration and Charms, but when I walked into Potions and saw Draco standing with Blaise Zabini, I started to shake. He said he wouldn't tell Dumbledore, but said nothing about telling others. I stood with Ron and Hermione and pretended to listen to whatever they were talking about, but I was trapped in my own mind. I didn't even register it when Professor Slughorn called to me, Hermione had to nudge me.
Not that he understood anything I said, but he kept moving faster anyway. When he started stroking my dick I lost my mind, losing all coherency that I wasn't speaking any language. I was finished in moments. But it didn't truly end, as he kept fucking me through my orgasm and kept stroking me until I felt this warmth spread inside me and he slowed.
I grinned and agreed to anything he wanted. He shooed me onto the train, and I paced off to dump my trunk and find the compartment with Hermione and Ron in it. I was rushing between compartments when I slammed into someone's chest. I almost fell backwards, but steadying hands held onto my arms and kept me up. I looked up into smiling grey eyes, and the hands were removed from my biceps.
The paper flew across the room, placed on a pile from students who had already come up with a name. I was one of the last, but once everyone finished our professor clapped excitedly. She set an activity to group up with friends and discuss what sort of topics we thought would be fun to learn about muggles, since this was taking up our free time, so she could start bewitching. A snigger came from behind me, and I didn't need to look to know it came from Malfoy or one of the other Slytherin's. Whatever she was saying about Slytherin's didn't apply to him what so ever.
The next week became a routine, a spinning circuit of classes of listening to Ron and Hermione talk about their blind pen pals. Ron was flirting with the girl he'd been paired with. Hermione scolded that the other person might be lying, and turn out to be Malfoy or something pretending to be a girl. Hermione had matched with a Ravenclaw, so her discussions were mostly about lessons or fun facts they'd learned outside the classroom. I kept my work on this project a secret from them. I couldn't really be sure why, I guess because I wanted to keep it fresh. We weren't always talking, but we had a catch-up each night before bed. That seemed too intimate to talk to about, it had become my favourite part of the day.
I glared at Blaise, quizzing him on what happened to not saying anything about my feelings for a certain Gryffindor. He just shrugged with a smirk, making Pansy giggle beside me. Fucking assholes. The sound of someone hitting the floor grabbed my attention, and I followed the noise to the Gryffindor table.
, until he was ready to see me as ready. I just hoped that wouldn't be too long. Since I've let myself notice how sexy he is, it's always at the back of my mind, trying to crawl forward.
"As much as I want to stay wrapped up in your arms, we should get to dinner before our friends start to worry about our absences."
, Harry’s birthday. A quick detour to Diagon Alley would be necessary. But what would he want, I barely know him. Some dad I am. Well, maybe am. Merlin, it’s so confusing not knowing. And how am I meant to see him, his Godfather will no doubt stand in my way, but hopefully, Lupin can calm him down when I just show up out of blue, enough to make him listen anyway.
Neville gaped at Harry, who just comfortably settled down and started to eat. Halfway through dinner, he subtly moved one hand under the table and started to stroke Draco’s leg. Draco’s eyes widened, but he tried not to react as Harry slowly caressed his thighs. As he reached for Draco’s crotch, Draco grabbed his wrist to stop him, and subtly shook his head.
"There are so many things I can think to do to you, but I just can't decide." HIs lover chuckled, "I've wanted you so bad for a while, now I'm spoilt for choice. What do you think?"
The blonde alpha just gaped, slowly bleeding into a smile and a surprised laugh. Harry didn't quite know how to react to that. Not that he had the chance, as one of the castle's servants came running and looking flustered. He asked if his majesty was alright and if there was anything he required. While Harry became confused, the alpha in front of him became frustrated. He tried to keep his voice came as he answered that he only wished to be left alone until he wanted to return. The servant nodded and left the way they had come. The alpha turned hopeful eyes to Harry as realisation dawned.
His reaction stunned me, but our time together was drawing to a close, and there was still the most important question yet to ask. So, I asked why. Why had he turned on his family and Voldemort? Why was he now being exceptionally nice to me and the others? Why he'd changed?
I smirked at his snarky judgement of my writing, but given it was true I didn't have a leg to stand on. But I guess the biting sarcasm and attitude are big things I like about him. He doesn't hold back the truth to spare your feelings, he just makes it lightly funny to take the sting off. People keep tiptoeing around me because they think I'm crazy or lying about Voldemort. It's refreshing.
She jumped on me as soon as I sat for lunch. "So, what was so important last night that you couldn't sleep?"
“It’s ok. I promise you, it was just a fling years ago, and I don’t feel anything for him. I love you.”
He sauntered past me, fully dressed and showered, headed for our little kitchen. I didn't know how to respond, he'd just shoved my best friends away without letting Ron say his piece. All he'd have said was some nonsense and an apology if Hermione had come with him. After how he'd helped me out the day before, it made sense that he was trying. And Draco had ruined it.
"Sometimes a bond won't take if the omega is in heat," Harry frowned. "So is that going to push me into a heat?"
After descending the staircase in silence, Harry pressed his ear against the living room door, leaving room for his friends to follow his lead. They couldn’t hear much to the first few minutes until Sirius kicked off again. He was yelling about their visitor being a liar, that there was nothing wrong with James, and that Harry was the spitting image of him too.
Turns out the question was about prejudice. She told us that many muggles had studied and researched prejudice so they could discover ways to reduce it. In 1979, a couple of guys came up with Social Identity Theory. It comes in three stages: the first is social categorisation, when a person sees themselves as part of a group, no conflict involved. The second is social identification, going from seeing yourself in an in-group to overtly identifying as a member of the in-group. The third and final was a social comparison. The in-group compare themselves with others, the out-group, putting them down to raise their own self-esteem.
All the eighth years had to wait for everyone else to leave after dinner, there was no room in the dormitories for them anymore, and so they needed to go elsewhere, to a different tower. The heads of houses led them to the East Tower, where all the houses would stay together, hopefully without killing each other. The first floor was Gryffindor, the second was Hufflepuff, the third was Ravenclaw and Slytherin was last, right at the top.
The following week was the most difficult Harry had gone through. Most of his life had been labour and bullying, from the family that was meant to care for him, but even those mental challenges paled in comparison to his first week in the palace. He still had Ron and Hermione, his chosen family and first support system, but they were the only thing he had that kept him sane. Everything else turned him completely on his head.
"Hermione wanted to help me be prepared, so she let me borrow a book. It explained things pretty well. Positions and stuff like that, so I'm glad you chose this one to knot me. It's comfortable."
"I apologise, my footman has a bad habit of speaking out of turn. He will be disciplined, I assure you," the old lady hissed at the alpha. "The boy is my nephew, a servant, and wasn't even at the ball last night."
"Hold still, I'm only changing yer clothes. Maybe addin' some things. So, you's need to be still. Close yer eyes, it'll help."
Hagrid opened the big double doors, and the eighth years filtered through, feeling the gaze of the entire school on them as they walked. Harry stood by his friends, and Neville Longbottom came to stand with them, nervous but steady. Professor McGonagall explain to the school why the eighth years were there, and that to mark the new year, they’d resort the students.
After five minutes of curling up under his father's apple tree, he was still sobbing his heart out. It was the only memory he had of his father, watching him plant this tree. It was his safe haven in this place, the last plot that felt like home. He sent a prayer to that tree, to the last part of his father he could still touch, in the hopes that he could hear. Begging for something to change in his life, for him to be given a real opportunity to get himself away from the torment of his current life. He wanted an alpha to love him, at least make him feel less alone.
The lady of the house gushed at him, blathering about how honoured she was to have him in her gardens and wonderful he looked, even after travelling all day. Draco's eyes drifted to the side, wanting to avoid the foolish woman as much as he could, and saw a pair of servants at the side. Based on his clothes, the alpha might have been a footman, and the fuzzy-haired omega beside him was holding a tray of biscuits, allowing the alpha to place his hand on her shoulder. An obvious claiming move. Draco was in no way interested, Harry wasn't a sweet looking maid, but he understood the desire. All he could think of was finding his omega love and pressing open kisses along his neck and wrists so his scent covered the other man. And carrying him off to the castle to keep him safe and loved for the rest of their days.
They got to the end of the huge hill, perhaps halfway home, before he noticed the carriage walls closing in. His clothes had already dissolved into the old torn rags. He begged that it would last until they were up the forest hill, then he could walk the flat road without it taking forever. And whoever was looking down on him and sending magical giants to grant him wishes was still protecting him, because the squeeze didn't become uncomfortable until after they peaked the hill.
Harry pulled up his courage again, closing his eyes and staying still. He heard Hermione's footsteps move away and was slightly comforted that nothing bad would bounce off at her. He just kept his eyes close, even as he felt a tingle over his skin, until Hermione told him to open his eyes.
"It's not the greatest, because I'm not a seamstress. But it looks good enough. It's the red frock coat Dudley threw out a while ago, and lacing from a couple of things Phoebe did want anymore. I hope you like it."
I glared down at Malfoy as he smirked, glowing under the attention of his followers. I sneered that losing my parents was better than being raised by filthy Death Eaters. We reached for our wands simultaneously, my friends by my side as his groupies reached into their robes as well.
He shook his head, and I think he looked behind me to Draco, "I hope what I heard about your boyfriend being a selfish prick is true, you could do with learning to be more selfish."
Harry nodded, smiling brightly as he thought of how normal his life was becoming, as he stood on the platform saying goodbye to his dad. He took the note out of his pocket, explaining the whole situation to his dad as he passed him the parchment, asking if he knew who sent it. Severus scanned the note, chuckled and handed it back.
As Harry crawled along the floor of the entryway, scrubbing brush firmly in hand, he beamed at the shine. It marked the shine of him finishing the first floor of the manor, just needed to clean the east and west wing, which he'd done so many times, it had become second nature. He was believing he could finish everything in time. Petunia needed to teach Dudley how to behave properly if they were going to snag a Prince, which gave him time to get ready. It was just getting himself presentable that posed an issue.
Heat rushed all over Harry's body, "honestly, do what pops into your head first, as long as it feels good."
The doors to the Great Hall opened, and Harry walked in with his new entourage, and the whole room fell silent. Harry was getting sick of the attention, so he nudged Neville with a smile and headed to the Slytherin Table. Draco came up on his other side and asked what lessons Harry had, and Draco’s soft voice nearly made Harry forget.
My eyebrows furrowed as his fingers moved. It made me hesitate to turn around, not wanting to disappoint him if I was mad and scared to know who he was. But that was the point of today, whether he knew who I was or not, and it's not like I could leave without turning and seeing him anyway. I took a deep, shaky breath before I turned and looked slightly up to see his face. I couldn't control the shock on my face.
He stopped when I tensed, something pleasant I'd actually never been lucky enough to experience. "You said earlier how you're cousin would force you to kiss him. He didn't force...anything else right?"
Draco's chuckling stopped, and Harry felt a twitch inside him that he wanted to squirm around. But that would hurt his alpha, so he tried to stay still while he groaned.
A steaming bowl of soup was placed in front of me, and he sat across from me with his. Creamy tomato and herb he said. Whatever it was, it was so good. It was actually better than when the house elves make it, apparently, it was herbs that they just don't use. For the main, he'd made pork and potatoes with some fancy sauce and green stalk things. They were also really nice.
Only Hermione picked up her quill. Like me, it seemed nobody else had any idea what to call themselves. I caught Ron's eye and made a confused face, which he just smiled at. He mouthed something, though I only understood 'bit of fun'. So I guessed he wasn't taking it as seriously as we were meant to. I looked back at the little white strip as I picked up my quill. I didn't want to go obvious since this was a shot to make an ally without being Harry Potter, the crazy boy saying Voldemort was back from the dead, but I could be anyone. It was like Professor Benylin said, I could just get to know somebody without prejudice. So I scrawled my first idea down.
Harry denied that it was Draco’s fault because it wasn’t. It was Harry’s. At that moment, Snape re-entered the room, this two potion vials in his hands. He handed one to Harry, who gulped it down, and sighed happily. Then Snape started to scowl, demanding to know why Harry was trying to kill himself. That caught Draco’s attention, and he gaped at Harry, who was refusing to look at either of them.
"Last chance gorgeous," Draco breathed. "If you don't want me to shackle you up and fuck you senseless, get up and leave. Otherwise, your She-Weasel's gonna be pretty pissed."
Madam Pomfrey nodded and asked Harry to try and relax so that she could do a brief detection spell. Harry relaxed as best he could, given his current situation, and it didn’t take long to get a result. Madam Pomfrey smiled, announcing that the result was negative, so Harry wasn’t pregnant. Harry breathed out, not realising his breath had been held, and his muscles felt weak. He thanked Madam Pomfrey for wasting her time to help him and left the Hospital Wing. He thought about turning up late to his next lesson, but thought it would be better to get some rest, he was way too stressed.
Before he could prepare for his father's anger, the steward returned with a frown. He'd looked over every name, cross-referencing them with the crest their family was under, but he couldn't find the lion. Draco didn't let that get him down. It was a chance, not a certainty, and he wasn't going to let it stand in the way of his love. He looked back to the ring, trying to slip it on his finger without it budging. It was a place to start, if the ring fits then there's a chance it's his love.
She giggled an apology as she warned that she gets into little rants about human psychology, and prejudice was always a hot topic for her. She explained the ins and outs of the project. Individually, we had to create a pseudonym to go by and place them all in a box to be drawn into pairs randomly. From there, Professor Benylin would create enchanted notebooks that were linked so we could write to each other. Similar to the new email craze, but slightly quicker. The aim of the project was to create a bond with someone without knowing who they were, so there would be no prejudice.
Harry looked up at the empty cage on top of his wardrobe, and he thought of Hedwig. He really missed her, but sadly she died to protect him. Loads for people died to protect him, Dora Tonks, Percy Weasley…even Luna. Lots of people he cared about. If it wasn’t for Severus Snape helping Sirius fake his death, Harry’s Godfather would no doubt be dead. Sirius even saved Severus from dying, but that still didn’t mean they were friends, not even close.
I blushed and tried not to seem eager by shrugging it off, but I was desperate for any sexual activity between the two of us. And his mouth was bound to feel good. He grinned and took my hand, pulling me against him and telling me to jump. I was confused but did it, and he grabbed my ass so my legs had to wrap around his waist. He kissed me deeply, and I wrapped my arms around his neck to hold him close. He carried me off to my room...our room, and slowly lowered me down on my back. If it weren't for wanting his head lower down, I wouldn't have unlinked my ankles. He removed my robes with magic to avoid how long it would take to do by hand and kissed me again.
All through his first lesson, Harry thought about a demon’s ability to get pregnant, now that it was confirmed that he could, and was embarrassed that he’d forgotten it. That’s when the worry and panic set in, as he remembered they forgot to have that talk about protection, and that they hadn’t been safe for the whole month they were together. For the entire hour and a half, Harry sat there worrying over pregnancy, and Draco’s reaction if he was pregnant. He decided the best thing to do was to go and see Madam Pomfrey, so he’d know whether or not he was for sure.
”He isn’t. Malfoy is as well, it’s better than what Umbridge would have done.” She frowned, “I suggest asking your Slytherin pen pal for tips on what to get Malfoy, or Professor Benylin won’t be satisfied with your lame apology present.”
”. Harry grinned, laughing to himself that Hagrid had finally done something for himself. Hermione smiled, glad Harry liked his present.
I was near incoherent, bordering sleep, but he just chuckled as he stripped off, covering me in the blanket as he climbed in. He kissed me deeply before he turned onto his side, facing away from me. I rolled over to spoon him, and he nuzzled back into me. It was a small movement, but a sweet one. And that's how we slept, our first try sexually and the first time we've shared a bed. Not bad, not bad at all. And I whispered a thank you to him, for staying even when I tried to push him away. If he'd left, maybe it could have been someone else under his lips, and the thought almost killed me. Maybe I was close to falling for him, but I don't know. Give it some time, maybe I could figure it out, and be in a truly passionate relationship with love at each end. So at least now I have an aim for that.
I heard him come back, banging on the door and calling out to me. But I ignored him, I stood by my decision. I just didn't anticipate him using magic to get through. I heard a rattle, a charm to unlock the door which thankfully failed. Except then the door was blown off the hinges by Bombarda. He came striding in, displeasure clear on his face when he saw me curled on the sofa, and picked up the door. He used a spell I didn't know to fix the door back into place and turned to me with a scowl. This was not going to be a fun conversation.
I felt oddly weird. At first, I thought it was ridiculous that I was jealous of Malfoy being with Cho after I couldn't, but I was gay after all. But when I thought it over, I realised that it might actually be the other way around. Then I laughed to myself. I was being stupid, I'd never look at Malfoy that way. Even if he did want me then I still don't deserve that kind of happiness.
Literally pulled an all-nighter, so I wrote crap to waste time, and this is what came out, so that's why the plot is weak, but it was a fun idea.
I sat on my bed awkwardly while they looked at me with new eyes. Hermione started talking about summer events, insisting to Ron that she went in chronological order, so he couldn't shoot his mouth off yet. I chuckled slightly, enjoying their bitching. She told me about a holiday she'd had with her parents, as well as some other mediocre things she'd done in the holidays. It sounded rather dull, but I hung on every word. It beat talking about my problems, so I was grateful for the subject change.
About a month later, Harry was walking to Charms, and as he headed past his father’s office, he heard crying. He knocked twice and walked in, where he was faced with his father who had his head flat on his desk. Harry rushed over, asking his father what was wrong, his voice laced with concern. Snape looked up at Harry, his eyes red from tears and frowned that he was pregnant with a little boy. Harry congratulated his dad, giving him a bright smile and I hug.
"Maybe it's simpler than that, and I'm not a dickhead here." My face twitched, as though holding my tongue. "Maybe I'm just accepting things you aren't, things you're too stubborn to consider because of how you feel about me. I'm not good enough, I don't deserve you, and you won't make the right choice about it so I will."
"This morning, I was trying to apologise." Ron blushed, "I was wrong to react how I did over you and Malfoy, I was angry that you were making a stupid decision and making it seem so great. I just thought you should know better. But then I saw how happy you've been together. I thought he was gonna be a bit of a dick, but I didn't expect the forceful shoving. Good to know he can look after you I guess."
All the things he said, it was like in my nightmare. He could actually leave me because I was trying to be sentimental and make it special when I said I loved him. And he's not sentimental, I've learnt that at least over our time together. I should have said it last night. But I'll see him in class, so I'll be able to tell him then. I can fix this, cure his insecurities and we'll get past this. His outburst doesn't need to be too big a crack in our relationship. I can fix it. I have to fix it.
“Well I shouldn’t say, but I won’t tell if you don’t,” Snape grinned. “Not many people are going back, and it’s mostly Gryffindors, but they’re redoing the sorting ceremony for your year, it’s meant to mark a new year, seen as you are the first set of eighth years.”
Harry just sat there in silence, until his father ordered him to explain himself. Then he let loose on his anger and his eyes flamed, practically screaming that Draco was the one who didn’t want to be together, Draco was the one who thought it was better to wait until after they had sex to say he wasn’t interested. He was only putting himself through pain because he refused to forgive Draco for using him as he did, and the pain relief wasn’t worth it if he had to go anywhere near the sleazy wanker.
Draco was pressed up against a wall, his hands resting on Nott’s chest as they kissed. It was just how he kissed Harry. Harry could feel the tears fall from his eyes as his heart slowly shattered. He’d had such high hopes for their future, and now he knew that Draco never really loved him. It was why he didn't tell his mother. At that point, Draco turned to look at Harry, who couldn’t bear to look at him.
"Why not? We're building bridges right, you should trust me more." Draco smirked, "I'd do anything for the answer."
Ron nodded, agreeing with Harry’s solution reluctantly, and Hermione gave him a hug. She told him that everything would work out, and that if Draco didn’t come around then maybe he wasn’t really Harry’s soulmate. But Harry refused to give Draco the chance, it would have been fine if Draco had said they shouldn’t be together before they had sex, but he didn’t. He used Harry, took Harry’s virginity, and made Harry think he loved him, Harry couldn’t forgive him for that. And he wouldn’t.
"Of course you haven't. I'm sorry if you're disappointed now you know it's me, but don't let that hatred cloud your mind." He frowned, "the point of this was letting us be friends free from our reputations. There hasn't been a moment I've been dishonest with you, and I hope you've been the same. I've let you see the real me, and you have no idea how freeing it is to not wear the mask of my father. I need you to understand that at least."
"Boy! Duddikins needs to be bathed and dressed. Don't start slacking now, you do want to attend this ball, correct?"
Sirius barged into the room, scowling. Harry felt Ron and Hermione jump, but he just raised his eyebrows at his Godfather. Sirius walked over, visibly calming down, and sat beside Harry. He asked Harry if he could take a few strands of his hair because without it the ‘bastard’ downstairs wouldn’t leave. Harry nodded, asking why he needed it, and who was downstairs.
for the entire Great Hall to have paused their conversations and for every pair of eyes to be on us. Me pressed into Draco's side. I didn't think we'd draw so much attention. Dumbledore was sitting in his usual spot, his twinkling eyes confused by our hold, and I blushed a little. I tried to ignore Snape's glare and turned my head to look over to my friends. Hermione was holding Lavender's hand, who was holding Parvati's hand, all three looking like Susan Bones before she fainted. Ron was pale, looking at us in utter confusion, which made me disappointed. I was expecting that funny green colour, but I least I got sickly pale.
But his omega couldn't open his mouth, knowing his answer would be a cry of pain and nothing helpful. But burying his face in Draco's neck helped. He breathed in his alpha's scent, moaning before he realised what he was doing, feeling slick start to coat his legs instantly. He'd never gone through a heat like this, where he was barely aware of things around him except Draco and his desire for his prince. But this was the first time he'd felt like he was in heat with an alpha so close.
The pen landed on the floor, sliding down the bed curtains after I threw it away from me. I wanted it away before I wrote anymore and made a bigger fool of myself. My handwriting was already a cause for shame, looking like a 10-year-old wrote it under the script of an adult with really beautiful penmanship. It was really, very well written. I had to admire it. Maybe when the project was over, and we could be friends face-to-face, he could teach me to write better. Looked fancy and curly, sort of feminine. But I'd say that it was too early to say that, he might not see it as a compliment.
"Now, I'd say that's enough. Not a ball appropriate outfit, I'm afraid. You'll be staying here, boy." Petunia chuckled, herding her children out while Ron went to prepare the carriage with fury in his eyes.
And he kept that promise. His hips moved smoothly, despite being laid on his side. And every snap of his hips forward had Harry moaning out loud, feeling deliciously full but desperate for more. He begged, long and loud, not even sure what he was asking for any more. But there was something missing. And Draco knew exactly what.
. I don't know what happened, but my legs turned shaky and weak, and my eyes drooped shut as I couldn't keep myself standing, fainting into something warm and soft.
"Are you alright?" He said, stroking my arm and worrying his bottom lip. "The whole lesson I was worried about you, that dream seemed…intense."
He clung to me and I gripped him back. We wouldn't spend as much time together when Dumbledore gets back, but what would that actually change for us? Nothing. There'll be bumps, every relationship has bumps, but we'll get through them. I wasn't worried, and I think his insecurities were covered now. So that was it. Nobody can know everything, but I can believe that we'll work. I can hope for the idyllic 'together since we were young' life together. Maybe we will be, maybe we won't. Nobody can no everything about what will be.
"Now, I say we head over into your bed so you can't push the couch out while I'm sleeping, and I'll give you a blowjob before bed. Okay?"
My godfather released me and warned us all that dinner was nearly ready, and Molly didn't want to wait for them. Ron was out the door before Sirius, and Hermione followed out giggling. I wanted to quickly change out of my T-shirt, as nerves had made me sweat like crazy. So they left me in peace to do so. Just as my T-shirt was off and I was digging around for another one, Ginny walked into the room. She gaped at my back and I let her, I let her see all my problems, and just the tip of my troubled mental-iceberg.
“I hope I’m still in Gryffindor,” Seamus smirked. “And I hope Headmistress McGonagall lets me blow something up again, like the Slytherin dorms.”
Harry bit his lip to keep from crying as he kept his eyes on the floor. He'd made enough of a fool of himself without crying in front of the prince too. He heard the man clear his throat and looked up to see a sweet smile. It disarmed him completely.
Other than that glance, I couldn't bring myself to look in my enchanted notebook. I was telling my friends I was waiting until tonight so I could write to them from my bed for comfort. But I was honestly nervous about doing that as well. The idea of being myself to make a friend without fame was fun, but I was now terrified of actually having to do it. Maybe without my fame, I wouldn't be enough to hold their attention until they got to know me properly. Or maybe I'd be paired with somebody I think is boring or annoying and I can't talk to them. It's worrying that so many things could not work out with them and me.
"H-how," Harry struggled, finding it hard to find his voice. "How are you going to do that? The ball has started, and I've no clothes or money for such an extravagant party."
“You’ve been missing since the first lesson, and its dinner now,” Draco frowned, “Have you honestly slept that long?”
"Well, Severus had the idea for a potion strong enough to put him in this kind of coma, one that's really hard to wake up from, but he didn't know how he could spike his food or drink. Seen as he's as paranoid as Alastor Moody." He explained, "but then he heard an argument between my mother and aunt Bella, over how You-Know-Who had... taken a liking to me, as he liked my dad. He wanted my parents to offer me the Mark, so if I took it, he'd take me, replace my dad with a younger model."
Harry thought for a while when his mind came to one issue. “Male demons can get pregnant, but I don’t know about half demons.”
Harry nodded, already knowing where this conversation was going. It was where conversations like these always went. Phoebe proceeded to talk about the luxury of the fabric and the attractive pattern or the design. Apparently, the cut was also flattering for a slight form like his, and wouldn't it have been beautiful on Harry? But of course, he'd never get to wear it because he was a stupid servant boy and would never be able to afford a luxury like that. Not that he'd ever be invited to an occasion worthy of a beautiful outfit. Worthwhile society didn't even know he existed. And it would always be that way.
After Hermione started, nobody else wanted to give an example. They understood what it meant, but nobody wanted to be wrong after Hermione had given a correct answer. I got that. She intimidated people.
Draco thanked his father, surprised and overjoyed. Narcissa smiled sweetly to him, reaching to rub his arm comfortingly. She couldn't keep the smugness out of her voice as she smiled that she had been right all along. The ball had been a wonderful idea.
“About what you said,” Draco frowned. “I didn’t…I didn’t use you. I just couldn’t think when you were kissing me, or when we…you know.”
“So you constantly touching me through dinner was all my imagination huh? And what you said about my skin, I imagined that too, did I?”
I explained the basics of my new routine. Getting ready for bed, discussing my day and how I'm feeling with Gemini, then we get the evening question and try to learn about each other. Last night was my question, I asked what his opinion of muggle-borns was. The rules were that we had to be honest, so I was getting his true thoughts for better or worse.
He crept over to his wardrobe and winced as the door creaked. Harry turned around and Draco grunted, turning over but remaining asleep. Harry breathed a sigh of relief and grabbed a pair of pyjama bottoms to sleep in. Harry never slept in a shirt, it just made him feel restricted. He yawned, crawling into bed and falling asleep, thinking of Malfoy and how much he changed.
"Oh, I'm sorry," the omega blushed, peeking at him from under his lashes. "My name is Harry, your highness."
His father used to own this house with his mother. They were both alphas but didn't seem to care what the world thought of them. Their love outshined everything, and with it they made Harry. But Lily couldn't handle the birth, alpha bodies aren't exactly made for it, and she died. After that, his aunt and cousins came calling. Uncle Vernon had been killed, boasting to a stronger alpha and paid the price for it. Aunt Petunia and Lily had hated each other, but James couldn't turn them away. It wasn't safe for a beta mother leading her young beta daughter and infant omega son. As soon as he died, Harry was never told how, his aunt had taken control. Omegas couldn't inherit property, and he was only 3 years old when it happened. Too young to even try to fight it.
His eyes widened. I could feel his hesitancy as his body tensed, and he bit his lip again, though this time in indecision. I pleaded as I stroked the sides of his face. I promised to go slow, but I knew he would, and got up to lead me to our room. After a trip out to the kitchen to bring back the chocolate and cream, he came back in as I undressed. I was only in my underwear, and his eyes moved over me hungrily.
I wanted the ground to swallow me up, I felt humiliated, but I didn't want him to worry. "Honestly, you didn't need to worry, I wasn't having a nightmare…despite the 'distressed noises' I apparently made"
They all burst through to platform 9 ¾, nearly bumping into Frank and Lily, who greeted their big brother with a big hug. Frank hugged Leo, and they skipped off to load their stuff on the train. Aries helped Lily carry her trunks to the train, and boarded. They stood on the platform, Ron and Hermione, Draco and Harry, and Severus and Neville, waving to their children as they headed off on their first year at Hogwarts, as they headed off as one big family.
“Well, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potions, then Divination, Transfiguration, Astronomy and Alchemy.”
I waited in my bedroom, laid face down on my bed with my shirt off. He made me wait like he usually did. This happened weekly when I came back for summer, they loved to instil the fact that I was a freak into my head, but that was in place long ago, to the point I don't think it'll ever go away. I was thinking this over when the door opened behind me. I heard his footsteps come closer. The clinking of his belt being undone and removed rang in my ears.
Draco's breath came in pants, and he slipped out of Harry to lay beside him. He kept Harry chained where he was, and asked what happened between them now they'd screwed and he'd changed sides. Harry shrugged but tried to snuggle himself closer to the other boy. He didn't know if the blonde was offering him more sex, or more, or what. Things with Ginny meant simplicity and a definite in with the Weasley family, but after all this excitement in his life, Harry wanted more. Draco was more. Whatever way you looked at it.
Draco came back over to him, looking ashamed of himself as he sat beside his blubbering boyfriend, and wrapped his arms around him. Draco apologised for going off on one but swore to Harry that no matter what happened, he’d be there for him and that he’d always love him.
. I turned to my table and saw the green shade on Ron's face, his eyes flicking to the mark on my neck. It seems Draco knows just how to make me happy, something I'd never felt possible.
Harry blushed, shaking his head, and looking into Draco’s eyes. He expressed to Draco that he thought it would have been a good way to show him that Harry liked him, and maybe see if Draco felt the same. Draco gaped at Harry, saying nothing, and Harry started to lose his nerve. He made an excuse about seeing Hermione about homework and tried to leave, but Draco grabbed his arm. When Harry turned back, Draco pushed him against the nearest vertical surface, which was a bedpost, and Harry was sure he’d get punched. His eyes clenched in preparation until he felt something light and warm peck his cheek. He opened his eyes just as Draco planted his lips on Harry’s. Harry closed his eyes again, and fireworks lit in his stomach as he realised he was being kissed. Kissed by Draco Malfoy.
I dressed for bed after my relaxing shower and contemplated what the plan was. There was only one bedroom, with only one bed. It was a double bed, but that would insinuate I'd need to sleep beside Draco, and I'm not sure how I feel about him seeing me shirtless. It's the only way I can sleep comfortably. I could hear the blonde in the shower, and wonder what to do while I waited for him. What had he done while I was in the shower?
He fell asleep first, and I followed soon after, once I'd convinced myself tomorrow was the night. The night we'd do it.
He didn't speak for very long, just he welcomed Professor Lupin back to the DADA position, and the Sorting Ceremony didn't drag either. The food appeared before my eyes and I was famished. I went for dinner first, because Hermione was staring me down. I had to eat a plate of dinner before I could destroy the treacle tarts. I piled it up, so she couldn't moan and seen as I knew where the kitchen was, I could always pinch some tart later. I saw Lavender giggling with Parvati, and looking my way. It made Hermione roll her eyes.
They shuffled out, dragging the big chunks of mud out of the room and leaving smears. At least it would make things go a little quicker. The bright sun caught his gaze again, making him hold his hand up in frustration. This wasn't what his life was supposed to be, his father didn't want this for him.
Though the thoughts swirled through Harry's head, he would never truly say them. While it might help Dudley to hear a little truth and move him out of his delusion so he can thrive in the real world, it was only going to hurt him. His mother should be the one telling him the truth, she was more likely to say it delicately. Because while he might say horrible things to Harry, it didn't mean that Harry was going to sink to the same level. He couldn't help thinking sassy things, but he could certainly keep them as only thoughts.
"Come on Harry, don't tease me like this." Draco moaned, "your mind put those shackles on the bed, if you keep going you can tie me up."
The door opened, and Neville came in grinning, strutting right up to me to plant a big kiss on my lips. His lips were so warm, so soft. His cheerful smile faded with concern as he saw the worry on my face. He asked me what I was worried about, and I smiled at how easy it was for him to read my emotions, like an open book.
"Hey! What's wrong?" Harry turned as the young alpha stopped running, walking to him in almost a concerned way.
Draco looked Harry straight in the eyes as he sang, “I don’t close my eyes, I don’t fall asleep, cos I’d miss you, babe. And I don’t wanna miss a thing.”
Then, with the shirt dropped to the floor, and Malfoy’s eyes squeezed shut, as he twisted one arm to face Harry. The darkness of the mark stood out against the pale skin of the boy’s arm, and Harry saw the fear and regret in Malfoy’s scrunched up face. He should have been disgusted, and probably scared. He should have left the blonde standing there half-naked, and ran to tell his friends, and warn Dumbledore, but he couldn’t. He just looked at the shame on the other boy’s face, and all he could think to do was stand up and rest his palm on Malfoy’s cheek.
Harry couldn't form a proper answer, just a whimper before he put their lips together again, and started unbuttoning and removing his shirt. After a lot of fumbling and rolling on the carpet, Harry was laying over his unlikely lover, making them a pile of nudity and moans. Harry shuffled down Draco's body, kissing as he went until he placed a wet kiss on the tip of his erection. Ginny came into his mind, reminding him how hurt she'd be if he kept going, no matter how much he wanted to right now.
I nodded reluctantly, moving away before I was stopped. His left hand was curled around my waist, his arm holding me to his side. He insisted that as I didn't deny that we were together now, he wanted to make a proper public display of affection, to warn the other potential boyfriends away. As if the bright red hickey on my neck didn't speak for itself. I imagined walking into the Great Hall with his arm around me and could picture the nauseated look I knew would be on Ron's face. So I let him lead me to dinner.
Ron sunk away into a smug-looking Hermione, the table strangely quiet as everyone tried to hold their laughter. It was funny, but nobody was going to willingly let it show. It was one thing to tease Ron, another to let Goyle do it. A pang of sympathy and shame made my appetite vanish. It could have easily been me getting teased beside Ron, and still could be if Blaise decided to make fun of me. I picked up my book bag and fled the table, wanting to hide from the idea and escape to Herbology. I had the lesson with Blaise, but it was easy to avoid him when his friends were there to distract him.
“After the bond between a demon and his mate has been made, you’ll be happier when you’re around them, but if you are separated for too long, you’ll be in pain, and grow weak, like a vampire without blood. It becomes you're biggest weakness.”
His tone was snarky, he was back to normal. It was a relief. I ran to him and couldn't stop myself from throwing my arms around his waist. He held his arms up, wooden spoon covered by some kind of sauce dripping on the kitchen side. I slapped his arm and asked what he'd been doing all day. He gestured around the kitchen, where pots and pans held different foods.
“Based on the look on your face, Harry hasn’t been open with you, so I’ll explain,” Snape spat. “Harry is a half-demon, he got all his abilities when he turned 18. One of his capabilities is he can sense his soulmate, his true love, and that would be you.”
His mother huffed, "stop thinking of it like that. Think of it like this, if you don't have this ball and don't choose someone for yourself, you'll be marrying someone your father and I pick for you."
“It’s about… You-Know-Who,” the blonde stuttered, catching Harry’s attention fully. “And I’d prefer not to talk about this here, meet me outside the Room of Requirement if you're interested.”
However, the prince was working on the decorations. He was trying to secretly pull them down to avoid having his party. And trying to hide from his parents' incessant questions. He didn't want a giant ball to celebrate his birthday if it was all just going to be a ruse to choose a pretty girl or omega that he'd buy into being his queen. Because they'd either want to marry him for his wealth and status, or they'd want to refuse but their parents would push them to say yes because of his wealth and status. And he didn't want a foolish sham marriage like that.
"Or it's an alpha thing. I know sometimes it's hard to keep my hands to myself with 'Mione around, must be really hard on him after you ran off. I'd imagine the planning is distracting him so he doesn't drag you off and bond with you. If you know what I mean."
