He was sure he had stolen her soul, she was his eternal prisoner.
Daphne seemed to have a difficult time accepting this fact. "Why?" she asked.
"Did you get into a fight because of the stupid interview?" Potter clarified, now drying Draco's hand.
Screaming.
"You are being an unreasonable brat," Severus snapped.
"What happened?" he prompted.
Theo supplied cheerfully, "Crabbe called Daphne a cunt."
"Honestly Potter, how many friends do you have? Surely not enough to lose count," Draco mumbled lowly so only Potter could hear. Potter's eyes widened in recognition.
"Draco!" Draco stopped when Potter grabbed his shoulder.
He was starting to feel stupid.
Perhaps, as a sister, as a member of his household, the mother to their children he could care for her. Could he love her romantically? No.
Theo paled suddenly, looking over Draco's shoulder, Draco turned. Graham Montague was starting at them. Draco could sense Blaise and Theo distance themselves from each other. Draco glared at Montague, but didn't say anything, waiting for the older boy to make the first move. Montague was a year older than them, with broad shoulders and dark hair. Montague's jaw clenched. His opinion of Blaise had been clear, as he had the most to contribute in terms of abuse for Blaise.
Draco's bones felt too heavy for his body. He laid across the couch in the Common Room, his head in Pansy's lap. She seemed to be getting better at dealing with her grief, much to Draco's relief. Draco looked up at her, she was wearing makeup, he noted. Just like she used to, before this summer when everything went to shit. Her long, dark hair loose around her face. Pansy smiled down at him, her face still too thin, too pale, but still beautiful in the sharpness of her features. She was reviewing the notes Draco had taken for her, finally showing interest again. Draco smiled up at her.
This was not going according to plan. This was so very much against the plan.
Their Lord's voice rang against Draco's ears. His head was underwater. He couldn't hear Daphne begging for her life. He couldn't hear his own heartbeat, but he could feel the pounding against his lungs, stopping his breath. His skin buzzed with the thick terror that laced the air.
"She's going to miss our engagement," Daphne added.
just a heads up that this chapter has a bit more explicit gore than unusual. If you want to avoid that then skip the first bit until the the large space in between paragraphs :)
Draco, however, could still feel his eyes droop, the Room could probably tell he needed sleep. Provided for him was a too comfortable couch and a lit fireplace that made the room toasty. Draco enjoyed how relax he was, not feeling this comfortable in a long time. He welcomed the sleep, letting the book fall onto his chest.
"Yeah, sure," he mumbled, looking anywhere but Potter, whose table had gone silent.
"You wouldn't stop looking over at Potter during dinner, I think you even smiled, but that could be a trick of the light."
"He's…" he tried past the lump forming in his throat. He swallowed. His father has made all the wrong choices and keeps making them. Draco was going to be the one to pay - the Dark Lord will demand blood or service when his father's fragile illusion of standing finally cracks into pieces. Draco was useless to do anything but watch his family's demise. "He can be cruel," Draco finally concluded.
But he couldn't make himself care.
A roar of laughter escape Draco's chest. "I think, under the-" he scrunched his face in mock.
How pathetic was he? Draco had three civil conversations with Potter, but already their relationship felt more genuine than any of Draco's current friends. Well, the term 'friend' may be a bit of a stretch to label any of his relationship with his peers. Daphne, the person who he was honestly closest to right now, had threatened to kill him with her bare hands just hours ago.
A flat box wrapped in red paper appeared on Draco's bent knees.
Perhaps Draco should get out of this fucking house.
As the two blondes grinned at each other, Draco felt the weight leave his chest as he settled into the comfortable silence between the two. Daphne continued to smoke, the smile leaving her lips.
Severus's shoulders stilled.
Potter swallowed before nodding, "Yeah, we are, aren't we." Potter stepped away from Draco grasp, "I have to go, they'll be wondering where I'm at." Potter took slow steps backwards, his gaze never leaving Draco's.
He was sitting in a chair too large for himself. A feast laid out on the grand table that was in front of him. Warm bread filled a plate, a saucer of rich butter was next to it ready to be eaten. A roasted chicken still steamed next to a creamy gravy. A Yule ham was in the center of the table, appearing to have been perfectly prepared. Roasted potatoes, delicate vegetables and minced pies all waited to be enjoyed. His mouth drooled at the sight.
“So I take it you don’t like Umbridge very much?” inquired Draco, clinging to what was left of the conversation before they separate at dinner.
Silence cloaked the previous joyful collection of students. "Shows over," snapped Draco, , and the group broke away in silence. Bulstrode stood from the floor, her face bloody and her noise probably broken, but she left the room with a square jaw and strong shoulders.
"Well, it's not like anyone comes in here anyways." Draco was too tired to take offence. He was so tired. Tired of having to watch his back with every turn. Tired of blood clawing at the edge of his robes. Tired of the taste of death in his mouth.
Nothing. Not a mouse.
The grueling lessons with Severus were taking their toll. Draco himself was tired from the two nights a week he spent as an observer. He couldn't imagine how Potter must feel. Severus was a formidable, unforgiving teacher. Potter wouldn't back down, he wouldn’t ask for a break. The two would work into the late hours of the morning some nights.
He couldn't hear anything. Draco could only hear his own heartbeat. Even as he saw the twisted expressions of terror on everyone's face.
So that was what Granger and Skeeter's meeting was about. Draco bit back his grin. Potter wouldn't tell Draco despite his nagging. Simply shrugging and noting that he didn't want to ruin the surprise.
"I'm not. I'm a Prewett," Alfie scowled.
Draco blinked, not used to being snapped at, "Sorry, Professor," he apologized.
"Is it… are we safe to be friends?" Potter asked.
Potter unwrapped the package to reveal a dark green over cloak. The collar was high and had simple lining and clasp. "It's enchanted," he explained. "It'll always keep you pleasantly warm and there is some protective magic. Nothing fancy, but it should help in a pinch."
"Potter," he whispered, the words taken from his chest at Potter's proximity.
The gentle hand on his shoulder made him flinch. "I'm sorry," Potter apologized. "She was your friend, I shouldn't be so insensitive. I know you don’t like to talk about her."

She stepped in close to him, her eyes were full of fury. "It's Pansy, she needs you," she stated.
Draco entered the room that was thick with an artificial floral smell that laced the back of his throat. Professor Umbridge sat behind her pink seat in her pink suit with a pink hat, that, surprisingly, included pink feathers.
"Do I even want to know?" Draco questioned, sitting across from him.
The two slipped into a comfortable silence, hidden away from the darkness that they knew was closing in.
While Potter wasn't aware of Draco being a spy exactly, Potter did get the point that Draco was knee-deep in a shitty situation. A real fucking pisser.
“Have you mentioned this to anyone else?” was Draco’s calm response. Draco allowed Potter to see him in a casual pose, leaning against the sink and placing his hands on the sink behind him. In order for his relationship with Potter to change, Potter’s image of Draco had to change.
He gave the password to enter the Common Room, staying quiet as to not draw attention to himself. He entered, making sure to give the show of confidence. He could feel stares on him as soon as he opened the entrance to the Common Room. Everyone was silent as he entered. Whispers against his back.
Blaise and Theo separated, both red in the face. Draco gaped stupidly. Theo quickly buttoned up his shirt while Blaise buttoned up… his pants. Draco put his head in his hands, groaning in frustration.
Snape had honestly given Draco a look when Potter was finished mouthing off. Nothing obvious to the rest of the class, but Draco understood it as 'you talk to him.'
He was just about the hex the pest when he heard footsteps coming forth. He strained to see who it was. The muggle girl, Mafalda, was creeping alone the wall. Passing Draco's hiding spot and poking her head around the corner. From there, she could observe the entrance of the Room and not be seen. She was observing. Draco didn't hex her, instead, he watched to see what she would do. This was a good way to see if she could be trusted. Mafalda didn't pay any mind to the cat still staring at Draco, the cat that seemed determined to have Draco jinx him.
His attention was taken away when Madam Puddifoot took their orders. When he turned his attention back, Cho was crying. Potter was just looking down at his hands as Cho cried, admitting to her feelings of guilt over dating Potter so soon after Cedric's death.
"Your Professor asked you a question, Malfoy," Severus scolded.
There was loud crash and a string of incoherent curses from the Common Room.
Draco was revolted by himself. He carried enough hate for himself for both of them. Protecting Potter from himself was the least he could do.
"What does it matter anyway? You've already told her about Dumbledore's Army," Potter interrupted.
Everywhere Draco walks, he sees her.
Daphne stepped back, her cool temper knifing through Draco. He wanted to take it back, but he couldn't. Daphne didn't say anything as she turned, walking away.
"Merlin's fucking pants," Draco mumbled. Potter snorted next to him.
Draco dug the knife into the side of her neck. Her blood was so warm, almost hot has he pulled the knife out. He barely registered the clink as the knife hit the marble floor. Draco held Daphne's wrist so she wouldn't cover the deep slice in her neck.
Draco tried to hind his surprise with a simple, “Of course.” This was the first time the either of them had attempted at conversation during these walks; if Zabini wanted to talk, he would.
"Father," his voice was steady despite his shivering.
"Who's that from?" Pansy asked, "another of your secrete admirers?"
Ding.
Theo gently pulled at his sleeve before gently scooting down the bench. Draco picked up his plate, piled high with food to make up for Draco's lack of lunch. He followed Theo down the bench, leaving his bag as the yelling only got louder. Heads from all across the Great Hall turned towards the ruckus.
"No, I want to learn," Potter argued.
"Oh don't worry, Professor McGonagall already gave me a talking to."
Potter shoved Draco awake, class was almost over and Professor Binns was explaining an assignment which Draco wasn't interested in. Draco stretched before putting away his things, including the Potions book. Class was dismissed. Before he left, Potter slid a folded piece of paper to Draco, leaving without another glance. Draco should wait to open the note, someone could see. And yet...
He had to stop thinking about Potter.
They walked out of the Common Room and into the halls of the dungeons. "She needs a friend," Daphne explained.
"If you think that you could teach a dim-wit like Potter Occlumency with your lack of experience-"
Shit. Draco just rubbed his eyes, pitching the bridge of his nose. Sighing. He needed to change the subject. Damper the mood, but Potter was… flirting with him and Draco loved it.
Pansy pulled him in close, "her family is presenting her over the winter break, to her betrothed," she explained.
"She tripped. She just tripped, Professor," Draco snapped coolly, glaring at Severus.
The families outside the train said their last goodbyes. Warm hugs were passed from parent to child. Draco couldn't remember the last time his parents had hugged him.
"Draco, did you get me a Christmas present?" Potter smiled.
Thankfully, Draco had worked all summer on researching the cabinet. Keeping his mind clear of any prying eyes was easier if he was focused on a subject every few were interested in. The dry subject manner of his studies kept him steady whenever someone was prying into his mind.
"No," he growled.
They stood there, still under the invisibility cloak at Potter's suggestion despite having the privacy of a classroom. Their bodies warming the space around them under the cloak. They stood closer than what was needed. They could feel each other's breath on their faces. Draco whispered goodnight but Potter made no move to leave. 'This would be where we kiss goodnight,' Draco thought to himself.
He couldn't stop himself. He watched the crowd move and breath around each other. How many would be dead at the hand of this war? In a year from now, in five years from now, how many would be killed? Would the crowds be less full? Would they continue, but with the deep weight of oppression from an enemy they didn't know they had? For now, Draco could only watch.
Footsteps? Just briefly. Draco didn't stop his movement. Better they didn’t know he was expecting anything. He took his wand out of his sleeve, hiding the movement with a yawn.
"Lucky you that I'm not playing then."
"Alate Ascendare!"
"Did you really had to bring Ms. Weasley into this?" Potter asked from the fake head-lock Draco still had them in.
"You didn't use your wand. Why?"
"I can come with you to your lessons," Draco offered.
But he wasn't charming enough to get out of detention, so he had no idea how he managed to get out of detention.
Draco sighed internally, "Yes, adequate."
Fuck, this was going to suck.
"This wasn't your fault," Draco answered. He hated how cold his voice was.
With enthusiasm.
"Exactly, Merlin knows how your education was before," Umbridge agreed.
Blaise poked his head in, "Oh, there you two love birds are." He entered the compartment. Draco removed his hand from Daphne's knee. Theo followed Blaise into the compartment.
Potter nodded at them before leading the way. His wand raised cautiously as he walked out of the only other exit of the small office off of the time corridor.
"Yeah, she wants to know soon, too. To help with the shift of Headmasters and all," Draco explained. Theo was talking to him, but he wouldn't meet his gaze.
"Never. I promise," Draco swore. Believing with all of his soul in that moment that this was a promise he would be able to keep.
The girl almost lost her eyes while rolling them at Draco’s stupidity. Draco could feel his smile grow until the whites of his teeth showed. Giddiness bloomed in his chest, this was the first time in a long time that he had honestly enjoyed himself. He does his best to hide it.
"Snap? Why? What do you know?" Draco demanded.
Daphne nodded, "I'm tired of feeling like I can't control my own life," she agreed.
He was being impaled yet turning into smoke. He was on fire yet so cold. He wanted to vomit yet his throat had turned into ash. He was drowning in his own screams.
There was a sense to expect his panic to finally boil to the surface of his skin. For the detachment that he had slipped himself into when he stole Daphne's memories to strip away.
His gut was twisting in his stomach, coiling tightly. His bones turned into hot pokers that melted his muscles. His skin peeled away.
Draco left his dorm with an accidental slam, only to be met with the curious faces of the other Slytherin boys who had heard him scream.
"Wow…Draco, that's amazing," Goyle whispered.
"Yes, for now only the students that are vulnerable," he agreed.
Potter didn't pull away.
Maybe she skipped this lesson.
A figure walked pass the row of shelves Draco was in. His heart stopped. He laid his back against the shelf in some pathetic attempt to stay hidden. His heart thundered in his chest. His sweating hand on his wand. His mouth was dry, fear lacing his tongue. What had he been thinking? Assuming if he was just a little bit quieter, a bit more sneaky, he wouldn't get caught? Of course he was caught. He was a child fighting an adult's war.
There had barely been a moment to himself since that fateful night a only a couple of days ago. Those days had dragged on like years.
"I think you should go," Draco dismissed her. She gazed between him and his father, a question obvious in her eyes. She left quickly.

“But...,” Zabini sobbed. His shoulders were visibly shaking now, too much for the boy, he was gasping for breath in between harsh sobs that shook his entire frame.
"Surprisingly, I found that out on my own," he retorted to her teasing. "Just think about it," he promoted.
McGonagall hummed at his explanation. Draco took this as his dismissal, scurrying away.
Draco just spoke louder, "And how did you know what my favorite meal is?"
"I need a favor," Draco stated. Daphne's hesitation was clear, he supposed at this point that was reasonable. "I need to know what happened to Montague, I have my suspicions, but I need to be sure," he answered to her hesitation.
Draco sighed. He started to reread at the top of the page. His thoughts were too distracting for him to focus.
Almost all of the fifth years were here in this one crowded hall. Everyone from the DA and the Slytherins of their year had come to Daphne's childhood home. Old family friends exchanged stories of the bright life that had dwindled. Some people who just happened to meet her briefly still showed to pay their respects. Daphne had been truly loved. He hoped she had known that as he had cut her life short.
The blood washed away so easily in the shower. Draco turned the water as hot as would be allowed. His skin begged otherwise, but he let the water turn his skin red in protest as he soaked in the pain. The blood dripped down his body, turning the bottom of the bathtub pink then clear. Draco scrubbed his hair, his face, his body.
"Yes, you've already said that, do keep up," Draco chided.
Of course. As if making a suggestion at the wrong time wouldn't have your blood on the floor. "Thank you sir," Draco praised, "the Greengrass family has shown no signs on treachery themselves. I was wondering if perhaps my betrothal to Daphne could continue to her sister."
“I can assure you,” Potter began, “that this is very important-”
"Well, you will have to be lucky with someone else."
Finnigan glared at Draco, but Draco was careful not to give him anymore reason than he had to be angry. Whatever that reason was. Where was Professor Hagrid? Of course this would be the day that he would be late. Draco, wanting to deescalate the situation, turned away from Finnigan. He glanced at both Theo and Blaise, silently telling them to stay quiet.
"It's Valentine's Day," he stated instead of supplying Daphne with an answer. And Potter will be there. Plus, Draco had been meaning to find out what happened to Montague since he had returned last week from St. Mungo's. Daphne's sighed. She looked the part of a respectable betrothal, as she always did. In her usual pale blue, she stood out against the dark greens of the landscape around them, but somehow seemed to belong. "You're now worried about appearances," she was guessing, but Daphne was observant.
"You blackmailed him?" Draco realized out loud. "You forced him to let you join didn't you? Do you know how utterly stupid you're being right now?"
Daphne snorted, "You're a man."
"Well, I'm glad you two are such good friends, maybe Cho does have something to be jealous about," he lashed out. He needed to change the topic of conversation. Somehow, Potter always manages to drag into light what Draco's keeping in his closet.
Draco gripped his knife until his knuckles ached.
Potter would be easy to teach. He did pick up spells like some pick up stones. Not just spells, but Quidditch and friends and-
The battered group returned to the circular hall. Their breaths the only sounds against the smooth bricks. Potter was half way across the circular room. They were going to get out.
Here, at least, people left him alone.
"Want round two, bitch?" Bulstrode growled, leaving Blaise to move into Pansy's space. Bulstrode had half a foot on Pansy, the size difference more apparent than ever.  Crabbe took his stance next to Pansy, ready to fight. The crowd gave them room, but still watched the show.
"And I'm quite sure being dick cheese is not allowed," one of them retorted.
"Promise."
"Zabini? Theo, what's going on?" Blaise inquired, reaching for Theo with a nervous arm. When Theo pulled his hand back as if he had been burned, Blaise looked as if his friend had just gutted him.
Daphne was standing on glass. She had a knife to her throat. Her family had chains at their feet and they were about to be pushed into deep water. She made the only decision she could.
"How?"
"What are you doing?" she challenged, itches away from his face.
"I'll be happy to assist if you have any suggestions, otherwise I don't leave if he doesn't," Draco opened the book to the first page. He knew better than to suggest any adjustment to Severus, who had ignored him several times in the weeks they've been meeting. Reminding Draco with a sneer that he was the teacher and that Draco himself had already attempted at teaching Potter Occlumency. No one moved. Draco looked up from his book. Severus had yet to move from where he prompted himself up on the table. Potter didn't look in any shape to continue, his body slumped forward and his head down. They usually needed the push to stop, Draco would always supply the excuse. "Let's be done for the night," he gently suggested.
Potter's smile turned bitter. "Seems like the least of our problems, right?"
He almost was at the bottom of the page, he almost convinced himself that he had nothing to worry about, when he found the line of initials.
The cool grey ash floated above the warm fire before collecting in the center. Draco's hands started to sweat. Twisting into a ball, the ash changed from grey into a blood red, then to a deep black. The ball of ash only compressed tighter into a sphere, shaking with the force of compression. The air was trapped in Draco's lungs. He couldn't hear anything over his own heartbeat, pounding in his chest painfully.
The three turned to see Blaise hurrying to them. Bulstrode was with him, shoving other students out of their way.
"I am not."

With a huff Daphne countered, "That's because he's been in Professor Snape's office all day, we're probably going to have a replay of Weasley breaking Draco's nose by the end of the night."
(See the end of the chapter for
The house elf entered, Draco raised from his bed. He stopped upon seeing who was behind them.
His Lord was a known terror. Draco would be killed for just being himself. The path he walked, the very breath he took, was a death sentence. He liked men. If he did carve out a place in the world his Lord was going to build on the blood and bones of those who were too weak, he would forever be breaking himself to force himself into the role that would keep him alive. How much would he cut out of himself in order to fit into a world that he didn't want a part of?
"One more year after this, thank Merlin," Crabb attempted at conversation.
The plate from Draco's hands suddenly disappeared as Daphne shoved his entire meal into Pansy's face, Astoria holding Pansy by the tie to make sure the plate was well shoved, shutting Pansy up for once. Draco gasped in mourning of his lost meal as the entire hall started cheering.
"Just yours," he promised, "please Pansy, I had to face the Weasley twins today!"
Draco's temper cooled in his stomach, danger in his words. "You're the only one who knows where my true loyalties lie," he whispered. Saying the words made them true. Telling someone else could get you killed. Daphne's shoulders drop at his words, feeling the weight of his trust. Her temper left her then, as quickly as it came. She didn't know what to do. Draco was trusting her with his life, betrayal is death.
Draco sighs and looks away. “You were better than me,” he mumbles ever lower.
The snake, wrapped around his wrist since he fell asleep, slithers back up his arm until it disappears under his shirt. Draco’s eyes must be questioning, because Harry says:
“I’m not tired! I never am, for quidditch!”
“How can you live like that.”
He can’t really lie to them, though. Hiding the truth is one thing, blatantly lying is another.
“To a future where we won’t reminisce about the past,” Harry says.
Harry is still catching his breath, hands on his knees, and Draco stares at him with his usual blank face.
“Or we have spare rooms at the orphanage,” Potter adds. “Plenty. You could take one for the night, no one would mind. People do it all the time.”
and that
And, while he’s perfectly fine with being casual and not coming on too strong and keeping some distance, he doesn’t exactly expect Draco to find him kneeling in the vegetable patch, dirt to his elbows, and his hair tied back with a pink hair tie he borrowed from Gwen to keep it from constantly falling into his eyes.
“Hey, you’re Harry’s friend from Hogwarts!” says a girl who seems to be dirty from hair to toe as she stops in front of Draco. “His quidditch nemesis.”
His smile is so tender that Draco has to briefly look away.
“You wha—” Draco starts before being silenced by Harry’s lips.
“I what? I’m too Slytherin? Too Malfoy? Not good enough for the Chosen One?”
Draco arches an eyebrow to him. “Well, you better start believing again soon enough, because I’m going to crush your soul and your ego on that field.”
“Is me being your boyfriend so laughable, Potter?”
Draco lets himself be swirled in the frenzy of setting everything up and saying hi to everyone who arrives in the middle of it. Hermione greets him warmly with a knowing smile, Ginny instantly asks him if they can now discuss Harry’s kissing techniques, George says, as he shakes his hand, that he would love to travel back in time to announce the news to his fifteen-years-old self, and Luna hugs him like they’re old friends. With each new arrival, he grows less and less nervous, and even starts to relax a little. Maybe Harry was right, and it won’t be
When he leaves Draco at the door of Padma’s office, it’s almost ten and he’s both surprised at how fast time has passed and relieved that it’s over. Now, the only thing he has to fear is Padma’s reaction after her meeting with Draco.
No, Draco can’t cope with all of that.
“Yeah, I do. You just seize opportunities when they come, right?”
“Well, then, welcome to the Tonks and Lupin school and orphanage.”
She rolls her eyes and sighs. “Merlin. You better hope Padma doesn’t see any of this. Fuck, you reek, don’t come any closer. Go take a shower yourself, I’ll handle the filthy gang. Oh, hi, Draco. Here for the inspection, right?”
“Do you want to wait outside while I go change, or…?”
“Something like what?”
“Come on, you hero,” says Ginny as she puts an arm around his shoulders. “Help me bring all those broomsticks and balls back to the locker room.”
“Oh. Nice.”
Also, that tattoo artist's story would probably have been much more interesting than this one.
He’s won already.
“When it’s sunny we play quidditch with Harry!” screams Nina while standing up. “He doesn’t let us play with real balls but it’s still fun! I’m a beater!”
She smiles as he opens the door. “See you around, Draco.”
Padma points at him. “No. Do not say that. Harry is very competent, even if he pretends to not understand a thing about administration, for the same fucking dumb reason that he doesn’t want people to know he’s singlehandedly financing this place, probably. Which is why, even if I think it’s a stupid thing for him to put all of his money into this place, I do trust him when he says he can. He’s a grown man, it’s his own money, if that’s what he wants to do with it, who am I to stop him?” She sighs again. “Okay, I’ve tried stopping him, but he’s as stubborn as a hippogriff, so I stopped trying.”
“Yeah, I finally made some use of my brief and infamous past as captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team.”
Draco turns and arches an eyebrow, worried he’s gone too far. “I thought parents were off limits?” he says, to make sure.
He fears that less and less each time he sees Draco, though. Because he’s still here, even after everything else, and that has to count for something, right?
Malfoy shoots him a look that clearly says that no, he didn’t.
“Good morning, Hermione.” She told him to stop calling her Granger years ago, but the habit hasn’t caught yet. As their office are in the same direction, he has no choice but to walk with her.
“Yes, Potter went into great details about everything,” he smiles as he sits down.
When Rosmerta comes in with a new round of firewhisky, Potter raises his hand. “That will be the last one for me, thanks. I still want to be able to walk back home.”
“You’re right,” he says without taking his eyes off it. “I didn’t.”
Draco arches an eyebrow. “People?”
“That ended a month ago! And, spoiler alert, I don’t come here because of a deeply rooted fondness for kids, or quidditch, or fries, or whatever shenanigans you decided to pull me into that day. But you know what?” Draco says as he gets up. “If all of this is just
I have moved and spent the last 3 days moving boxes, driving and cleaning (in no specific order), and now the itnernet is terrible until my line is activated.
“Admit this is alright, then.”
“How are you doing? Still working on Harry’s case?”
It truly does. It’s a vast hall with glass ceiling, filled with plants and organized in a way that makes it look like a series of small enough conversation corners, and not a vast, empty room.
There’s some loud bangs on the door, almost making Draco jump.
“I was tired of other people branding my body, so I decided to do it myself.” He feels Draco tense a little, and lightly bites his skin. “I put my parents there, and my friends, and everything that made me feel like me.” His hands go up Draco’s flanks, ending up over his shoulder blades. “I needed to ground myself in my own body.” He trails kisses all over Draco’s jaw, feeling his breath hitch under him, up to his mouth. He then raises up, straddling Draco, and stares straight into his eyes. “I’m surprised you don’t have any, to be honest with you.”
Harry stares at him, then nods. “Yeah. Sure. When you want.” He leans forward and smiles as he kisses Draco’s neck. “You know where to find me.”
Padma shakes her head. “I don’t think he will ever not care about the place. He built it from his own hands. It’s his baby, more than all of the kids that we have here. He is passionate about it, I will not take that from him, and wants the best for it. I believe that. He also assured me, with proof, that, were he to die, his will states the orphanage would get most of his possessions. And we know we have other funding options to explore, like the ministry, or even a partnership with Hogwarts.” She smiles. “I don’t want it to happen, but we would find a way. We have competent people working here.”
Draco shifts uncomfortable on his chair, both at the mention of Dumbledore and at Padma’s stern tone. “Yes. A lot of generous private donors, were his words, as I recall.”
They sneak to the stairs and reach Harry’s room without seeing anyone.
Holding Harry’s hand against his belly, Draco whispers back without turning: “Okay. You’ve done all you needed to do in London?”
But Draco remembers the words from Padma and Hermione. He’s being unfair. Potter is apparently just being his usual generous self. Draco just never thought he’s actually be on the receiving end of it. That’s just how Potter is, probably. He shouldn’t try and see anything special in it.
“He let it slip once.”
“Anyway,” Granger continues, “we all saw and lived a lot of things before we turned eighteen, you included, that no teenager should have to see or live. And if I believed this helped us turn into the adults we are today, I also think it could have fucked us up beyond recognition. And I’m very glad that Harry, even if he has his issues, is living a relatively sane adult life today. But it took him a very long time to get there. After the war, there was a point where I thought we wouldn’t get him back. Learning that he was meant to die basically obliterated all his plans for the future, because he didn’t see himself with a future anymore. That’s why he didn’t come back to Hogwarts, that’s why things ended with Ginny, that’s why he never became an Auror, and a lot of other things. Of course, I tell you that today, with the distance I now have from it, and it’s only my point of view. At the time, we were all too caught up in the moment to interpret anything. In a sense, Harry was very lucky to have Teddy. He focused all of his attention and hopes on him, and his determination to give him the home and family he didn’t have himself as a child is probably what saved him, in the long run.”
“Is this ok?” he whispers.
She huffs and then walks ahead, a thin kid at her hand.
“You swore not to judge!” Harry says, pointing at him with his fork. “On Rose’s life!”
"Malfoy? Malfoy, are you there?" a knock on the stall. Draco wiped the tears from his eyes. Potter, what did he want?
"I thought you'd like the clipping," Daphne teased. Crabbe and Goyle both laughed, traitors. Draco grabbed the paper, tossing it out of Daphne's immediate reach. She scoffed, too comfortable to get off of the couch. When she was about to rise to pick up her reading material, she stopped in confusion.
She was holding him still with her stare. "What do you want?" he growled.
Chang was pretty, Draco supposed. She was short, but thick in muscle from Quidditch. What did Potter see in her? Was it because she was smart? Or was it her socialite attitude? Maybe Potter liked her for her long, dark hair.
This cause a tightness in Draco' throat that he couldn't pass. He couldn't speak. He looked down at his feet, over at the steaming food on his desk, the curtains, the lavatory door. He looked anywhere except at his father.
"Well Malfoy, this is a girl's bathroom," Myrtle pointed her nose high into the air as she floated higher, as if she had so many better things to do than talk to him.
Draco tried to soak in his last great feast. He wouldn't be returning for seventh year.
"What would you like to eat Hadrian?" I asked catching his attention.
It took me three months to healthily heal, and those were great months. No one defiled me or beat me, but as soon as my doctor said I was healed Draco raped me again along with many of the servants and other noble men. I fell asleep from the pain before they finished using me.
"Good your awake," Draco said getting up and coming closer to me.
"Hey Beautiful," he said making me blush as I sat down beside him. He wrapped an arm around me and put a bookmark in his book to give me all of his attention. "How are you?"
When he sat down it was clear just how uncomfortable it was. His mother is probably an uneducated swine and picked the dress thinking it would give him positive attention. In reality, most Alphas are possessive and only want themselves to see an Omega in such a short dress. An Alpha wouldn't feel comfortable with it unless they had a mating bite. After mated, we can tear apart anyone who wrongly looks at our Omega.
"Alright enough," I said loudly stopping everything going on in the room. "Abraxas and Scorpius go get your stuff together without yelling at your mother. It is your stuff he should not need to keep track of it. Delilah and Bree go get ready to go and stay away from each other or both of you will be grounded. Now, what is Flora having a fit about?" The last question was directed towards my gorgeous Omega.
I finished drinking my tea and went back into the large home we live in. I went into the kitchen to begin washing the dishes. Adaline and Ida couldn't decide what they wanted for breakfast causing more dishes  than necessary being made. It annoyed a little considering I'm the only one who does any house work, and I considered bringing the issue up with Draco, but he is already extremely busy with work.
"How," I questioned wondering what he could possibly do to earn my trust.
"I seem to have fallen for the youngest Potter," I said looking at them both to make sure they knew I was serious.
My wake-up call the next morning was my mother dragging me out of bed at four in the fucking morning. It was easy for her to manhandle me since she was 5'7 and I'm only 4'10. She dragged me into the bathroom and washed my waist-length thick black hair. When she was done she dried it and pulled it into a tight bun before adding a crystal pin. She next caked my face in makeup that would later cause me acne.
"If you ever tell my boy the truth," Draco growled while wrapping his hands around throat, "I will tear you apart then kill you." After threatening me he left as I fell asleep from the lack of oxygen.
"I will explain when you arrive. Just please hurry," After that was said I hung up and waited in silence. Soon my parents came through the floo that was in the room. They both looked at me but sat on the couch across from the chair I was sitting in.
"The twins messed up on a prank and now Jaden is in a coma," James said frustratingly.
When the Potter Omega walked in I felt a waterfall of emotions. At first, I thought he looked sexy in the dress he was wearing. Then when I saw everyone staring at his ass I felt jealousy. Even though I have nearly met him I feel protective over him and want to dig out the eyes of every person looking at him with lust.
"Can I ask you a personal question?" I asked him while looking at the fire.
"You wouldn't be happy to if you were put in dresses two sizes too small and forced not to eat because your mother thinks your fat. You wouldn't be happy if you were told all you'll ever be good for is being a sex toy since you you were six years old. You wouldn't be happy if you weren't allowed to go to an actual school. And you wouldn't be happy if your parents refused to get you everything you needed to make sure you safely go through heat." Sorry, he said after his little rant and a blush covered his cheeks.
I woke up with intense cramps in my stomach and a craving for sugar. I groaned at the situation knowing my period decided to grace me with her presence. Knowing if I didn't get dressed soon I would be punished if I didn't get ready. I just want to get back in bed with comfy PJs on than snuggle with Draco later, but no I have to do as I am told. I can't wait for Draco to set me free from this hell.
"You poor baby," he said once he got it and hugged me.
"Finally, took you long enough," my mother snapped before walking towards the portrait door. We ended up walking to the great hall in silence and when we entered all eyes were on us. I felt extremely uncomfortable with all the stares. Many Alphas and male Betas stared at my butt specifically as we walked. I tried to pull the dress down as much as I could before sitting but it was no use.  We were sitting at the Gryffindor table and none of them hide their lust.
Once I was ready I exited the room and met Blaise. Since my father is not coming Blaise will walk me down the aisle. Over the past few months, we have become close and he became the older brother I wished I had. He just smiled and led me to the garden that we are getting married in.
The crisp autumn air filled my lungs as I stepped out onto the backyard patio with a cup of apple brown sugar tea in my hands. Draco already went to work for the day and the twins were at school. I had a long list of chores to get done around the house before Draco gets home, but decided some relaxing tea will do me good.
-----------------------
🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
I found him in the room of my mother and was horrified to see my father assaulting as he laid their motionless with tears running down his face.
Harry's POV
"What's actually wrong with the whore?" my mother said confusing me on who they could be calling such vile names.
By the end of the night, I was dead on my feet. Draco took me home and helped me change out of my dress and into one of his shirts for bed. I laid down and closed my eyes feeling comforted when Draco crawled into bed and wrapped me tightly in his arms.
"I can get you help," Draco said looking into my eyes.
"Just my slutty twin," my mother sneered as the sound of sobs filled the room.
"I don't know if we can," father said plopping down into his chair.
"What did you do to him?" my mother screamed as she came up to examine my body.
"Kay," I answered as he picked me up bridal style. He carried me to our bed and set me down lightly. It didn't take long for me to fall back asleep even though I just woke up.
"Where?" he asked very concernedly.
We stepped into view and I saw Draco at the end of the alter waiting for me. He looked perfect in his neat suit and slicked-back hair. He looked like the perfect Alpha.
"Definitely not," she argued, "He will not be the next Zabini whore who can't choose one man."
"You okay beautiful?" he asked me removing his hand from my hip and using it to hold himself up.
Harry's POV
"Okay baby," I said calmly, "go upstairs and lay down. I'll get the kids ready then come get you."
We arrived at the train station and people were everywhere. The kids were still not fully behaving but it was better than before. Harry held Flora in his arms as we made our way through the barrier.
"And who is the Omega hiding," my Mother thankfully asked so I didn't have to. In honesty, it would be disrespectful as an unmated Alpha to ask about an unmated Omega who has not made his presence known.
Dear Mother and Father,
"Hey babe it's time to go," I said peppering his face in kisses until his eyes fluttered open.
"That would be very nice of you," I answered, "I'm Hadrian Potter."
"Sit," Draco said patting his lap. I went over and lightly sat myself on one broad thigh so I could easily see hime and reach the table. "Feed us both," Draco said so I did.
Its been five months since the trial and three months since Draco finished school. He recently took over his father's business and now Narcissa and Lucius are happily in France. Draco and I live in Malfoy Manor and have been happy. I have been thinking recently that it was finally time to take the next step in our relationship.
My pregnancy wasn't an easy one. My morning sickness was horrible, but no one helped me as I constantly emptied my stomach. My cravings were super intense but never fulfilled. My body swelled and because my body is small I couldn't walk after month seven.
"Are you okay?" I asked as I walked into the room. When the Onega opened his mouth to respond he began coughing harder and choking on his own blood. I went over to try and help, but there wasn't much I could do as he drowned in his own blood. I sat there as he clung to my arm and stopped breathing.
"I'm just not ready for anything more but kissing," I said preparing myself to be rejected.
"I think if we play our cards right we can marry him off to one of the Zabini boys," my father said calmly in contrast to my mother's rage.
When I saw the parents of the Potter twins walk in I didn't expect to see a beautiful Omega following them. He looked perfect with his curvy body that wasn't stick thin like most Omegas. His beautiful hair was pulled into a tight bun and by the size of it, he had a lot of hair. Out of everything though were his big bright green eyes that flashed with emotion. He is perfect and will be mine.
"I'm your Alpha and if I say your gonna get pregnant, you will," I growled and he nodded rabidly. I then choked him, not hard enough to kill him, but hard enough to make him pass out. Once unconscious I got to work making a baby not caring about his concerns or the fact he was unconscious.
"Of course," she said concerned, "but may I ask why?"
"Well I have one month to prove I am worthy of your trust and I will not waste it," he said then hugged me gently. I hugged back and instinctually sniggled into his muscled chest with a content smile. "I have something for you."
"It's beautiful," I said with a smile. "Why are you giving it to me?"
"Are you even paying attention," my father snapped. "Clearly that's what's going on. I however refused to break the law and no one was gonna marry Harry."
It was one in the afternoon by the time I was done the housework. Feeling a bit tired today I decided to take a nap on the couch knowing better than to mess up the bed. Somehow Draco always seems to know if I've made the bed more than once that day. I ended up sleeping for an hour before my alarm woke me up.
"Like hell," my mother yelled, "We are talking about an attack on my son and I refuse to leave. Just because I'm an Omega does not mean I am below a useless Beta like you"
"Well to put it simply," Dumbledore said, "no one is to blame. You Potters and even the Malfoys have permission to stay until Jaden makes a full recovery."
"Just shut up," she yelled, "We need to get someone with more money."
"I am glad to see you as well, he said and leaned down to kiss my cheek. I looked at him and my eyes were drawn to his lips. I quickly looked up but by the smirk on his face, I know he noticed.
"Um... anything they have will be fine," he said shyly. It was clear that he wasn't good at asking for things. That was a negative sign because Omegas should be raised to never be afraid to talk about their needs. I asked the elves to make him something simple but filling then led him to an old couch that sat in front of one of the fires.
When my parents were in bed I changed back into my Onesie and snuck out. I went to the entrance hall as Draco said and he was already there.  He was still in his clothes from the day and had a rectangle box in his hand.
"I don't feel good Dragon," I responded and laid up against his chest.
"I love you so much," he said and kissed me softly on the lips. I kissed back and soon was on my back with him over me. His hands began to wander under the hoodie I was wearing. His fingers danced over my skin as we kissed. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders as he pinched my nipples making me moan softly. When I felt him get hard I didn't panic like I did last time just continued to kiss the man I love.
"Why is he covered in blood?" I asked this time extremely concerned after the conversation I heard my parents have earlier.
"How do I know I can trust you?" I questioned since I had been hurt too many times. I didn't want to trust him than have him stab me in the back and treat me like trash. No matter what my parents say I know I am more than just an Alpha's sex toy but if he walks all over me it means I'm weak. I already doubt my judgment and I don't want to make a mistake.
He lifted the veil and when he saw my face Draco pushed me to the floor. He yelled about how I wasn't Jamie and my heart shattered. I wasn't wanted my father had lied to me and deceived Draco.
"At least it will give us a chance to find an Alpha for him," my mother bit out. "Harry, go to bed you will be up early to make you presentable before going to a place where so many respectable Alpha heirs are."
Harry's POV
"Should have thought about that before you snuck out," he yelled tightening his grip on the bitch as he dragged him.
We arrived at the Ministry where we would meet my parents then go down to the courtroom. Harry looked beautiful with his hair pulled back nicely thanks to me. He was dressed in a blue satin dress that unlike every other dress he ever wore was his choice. He stood close to me and clung to my arm. Everything about him was perfect except the bruise on his face.
When I woke up the morning after our wedding I felt sick to my stomach. Draco was still asleep so I carefully slipped out of bed and went to the bathroom. Just when I thought nausea passed I threw up in the sink since I wasn't close enough to the toilet. After throwing up I crawled over to the toilet just in time to throw up again. I heard footsteps and saw Draco in the doorway.
"I um guess so," he responded.
"Dad...Dad..." I yelled as I started CPR on the Omega. Soon my parents were running into the room. My father rushed over and checked the pulse of the Omega. He pushed me away and began doing CPR himself. Soon the stranger began coughing and breathing again. As soon as he comprehend what was happening the Omega broke down in tears.
When we got to the reception Draco took me in his arms and we glided across the dance floor.
"Well I'm sure if he did beat Harry it was well deserved," Jamie yelled back.
"What happened baby?" I asked while letting him hide his face in my chest.
"It's a symbol of my promise," he explained. "It's not a real flower so it will never wither. I am giving it to you so you have something to remind you of my promise to earn your trust. I know you have been through some stuff and it will be hard. But I like you and want you to trust me so I can help you."
"Sure," I said and we started walking. We left the castle and started walking in silence till we reached the lake. There we sat by a tree not saying much.
I quickly got a piece of parchment and scribbled down a short note. When I was done I made it to the great hall just in time for dinner. I saw a puffy-eyed Harry sitting with his head down and walked by him. When I walked by him  I slipped the note in his hand telling him to meet me in the entrance hall tonight. I saw him give me a tiny nod confirming that he will be there which made me smile. With the knowledge that I would see him tonight, I sat down with my friends and ate dinner.
Harry's Pov🍁
"You look very handsome today," I said with a small smile while still blushing.
"Great thinking we can't risk our money," I responded and heard the Slags sobbing getting louder.
"Yeah, I will," I answered with a smile. "Can you help me get out of my parents' custody? I know I said a month, but I want to be with you and they won't allow it."
As you know I have had feelings for Harry, the Potter Omega. Well, tonight he agreed to become my Omega and asked me to help him with something important. I have mentioned the abuse he has been suffering and he has agreed to let me help. I plan to get him emancipated since he is over the age of fifteen. I would like to know if it is okay for him to stay with you while I finish the last few months of my education. As soon as I finish you can follow your dreams and move to France. I will take my responsibilities and I plan to marry my Omega soon after.
When I woke up I was in my room again. I was still covered in birthing fluids and blood. When I looked to see where my baby was I didn't find him, I just found Draco sitting while reading.
"What's that?" I asked relieved that he wasn't mad that I didn't want to have sex.
"That's okay baby," he said and sat up pulling me up as well to cuddle intl his side. "We will go at your pace. I just have one question."
"Draco Malfoy at your service," he said and took my hand and kissed it gently making me blush. "Follow me beautiful," he said as he began walking. I just complied and followed him in silence.
As we walked to the kitchens I observed him. He looked tired and adorable in his pajamas. This is also a good opportunity to try and make sure he is being treated correctly. When Harry becomes mine he will be treated like a queen and will be showered in love. I will never let want again he will get anything he wants unless it could cause harm to him.
Using the bloody glass still in my hand I began stabbing my father. He tried to fight back but I was stronger and soon he was lying dead beside my sobbing mother. I rushed over to him and wrapped a sheet around his broken abd bloody body.
I went into labor when I was eight and a half months pregnant. I had been laying in bed rubbing my big belly and talking to the little baby resting within me. I remember being so excited to have someone who would love me. My water broke and I was rushed to the hospital wing in Malfoy Manor.
They dressed me in tight corsets and the traditional gown. Following tradition my face was covered blinding me until I was alone with my husband after the marriage. The night was magical and everything my wedding was expected to be. Until it was time for my Alpha to claim me and make love to me.
"I'm bleeding and it hurts," I groaned and wrapped my arms around myself.
"Good job baby boy," Draco said before kissing me gently. He patted my bum before he left to go upstairs to get comfortable. I picked up all his stuff and put it away so everything could easily be found.  Thirty minutes later Draco, Adaline, Ida, and their seven friends came down for dinner. I served everyone starting with Draco first since he is the boss.
Harry's POV
Draco L. Malfoy
"He is not," I said to treasure him. "They abuse him though. They make him wear clothes he hates, and the amount of skin they show gets him inappropriate attention from rotten Alphas. They also starve him thinking he is fat, which he is not he is perfect."
"I love you too my beautiful Omega," I said and quickly kissing him before he went upstairs to relax.  I finished getting the kids ready having to use my Alpha voice once in a while. Once they were ready I went to my and Harry's room and found him fast asleep in our big bed. I went over to him and gently woke him up.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked concerned making me laugh in my head. I decided I would panic him a little more.
I finished the letters and sent them to the right people. I was finally able to sleep when I finished. And it wasn't long before I had very hot dreams about my little Omega.
"Considering Draco has been proven the most powerful of his age and your boys are almost squibs I think it is possible," my Father told the man harshly while using his cane to add dramatics.
Once dress I put on light makeup and some flats before leaving my room. Both my parents were dressed and looked impatient.
"Will you do my the honor of making me the luckiest man on earth and marrying me?" he asked as he took a jewelry box out of his nightstand.
"Shh baby," I said trying to calm him and soon he did calm down. "You can stay here tonight. Tomorrow is the trial. Why did he hit you beautiful?"
Draco's POV
"I think you will," I said looking up at him. "I want to trust you, but I'm scared. My own family can't be trusted and I barely know you."
"Lily, darling," my father began, "You need to remember the point of keeping him. If we groom him right we can gain a fortune by wedding him off to any Alpha of our choice."
"Omega," I growled causing him to go still. "I want a baby. I want to see your belly get big because you are holding a sweet baby. Will you do that for me Harry?" I said all this while stroking his flat belly.
I and Harry have been married for 13 years now and have three Alpha sons, Abraxas Draco Malfoy and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. We have an Alpha daughter named Bree Narcissa Malfoy. And we finally have two omega daughters named Delilah Hadrian Malfoy and Flora Pansy Malfoy. After Harry gave birth to our youngest Flora who is two the healer said he would not be able to have another safe pregnancy. Harry was upset because he wanted more children but knew he could not risk the chance of him dying and leaving his kids.
It took a while but the pain finally numbed and I gave him the okay to continue. The first few thrusts were uncomfortable, but soon I was moaning mess under him. He was touching me in all the right places. It wasn't long before I orgasmed and fell limp under him. Draco kept going for a few minutes before coming deep within my body. He fell to the side of me and pulled out. Soon we were asleep neither of us realizing he forgot to use protection.
"What's goin' 'n?" he mumbled and I knew he would take my side in punishing the little shit.
I felt disgusted with myself as I walked knowing people were staring at things they should not be. It made me feel unsafe knowing that if an Alpha attacked me my father could do nothing since he is a Beta and weaker. Even some Omegas are looking at me wrongly making me want to break down in tears.
"I guess that would be okay," I said hesitantly. I really want to get to know him, but I'm also afraid of being hurt. I know that I'm far from being the perfect Omega. He might not like me if he gets to know me. I'm honestly a loser with poor education and no self-esteem.
"Your welcome beautiful," he said and hugged me again letting me cry into his chest as I broke down. When I calmed down he carried me back to the castle then to my room before kissing my cheek and going to his room. With a blissful smile, I went back into the rooms only to come face to face with my mother who looked very unhappy.
Draco's stomach clenched painfully. He could taste the bile gathering at the back of his throat. He gathered his resolve, building a wall of stone around his heart. He would not let Potter see him cry over him.
The way Potter looked at him, held his hand, laughed with him, made him feel himself. Draco couldn't risk his friendship with Potter over jealousy. Cho seemed good, even if she came from a place of grief. Perhaps their relationship would comfort Potter in his own grief. Draco should be happy for him, happy that he could share the burden of this massive burden he shouldered alone.
"Enough!" Draco shouted with authority he didn't know he had. Pansy rose quickly, out of breath but not out of fight. "Parkinson, stand down!" ordered Draco. Pansy stood against his order, her body tense, ready to lunge into the violence.
Draco hurried to dressed. Daphne was waiting at the foot of the stairs for him when he left the dorm. She was in her school robes, her hair in a loose bun and the base of her neck. Her face was framed by the strands of hair that were loose from her bun.
Warning: Non graphic depictions of torture and graphic depictions of  attempted suicide.
"What happened to your hand?" she observed.
"Obviously," Draco claimed.
"Because!"
Draco blushed at Potter's smile, "We don't actually celebrate Christmas, most pure-bloods follow the old traditions, but sure. Happy Christmas, Potter."
A cruel laugh escaped Draco before he could be bothered with manners, "Are we going to pretend you care about my safety now, Headmaster? Let us not pretend. Plus, I couldn't kill you if I wanted to."
"Detention, Draco," Severus commanded at Draco's outburst. Draco was more than happy to distract Severus and Potter.
They didn’t give him a chance to hear footsteps this time. They had been waiting.
"I…he's…Draco, you don't want to know this," Potter shook his head.
"Merlin…that, doesn't explain anything Potter. But so long as you're not taking me to the forest that students are, for good reason, not allowed in, I think we can manage," Draco teased.
"Than what is it like?" Draco challenged.
"What's got you all dreamy eyed?" Pansy took her normal seat next to him. Class was still a couple of minutes from starting, students were still filing in.
He made sure to look casually away whenever he heard quiet footsteps and hushed whispers. He just hoped no one would be tempted to hex him, but the Weasley twins were still out for him, so he kept his guard up. Anyone not in the DA he made sure to snap at, taking points from anyone outside his house. He ignored the many footsteps behind him, they stayed a good distance away, waiting behind each corner. He smiled, Potter would appreciate this. ***

"Aren't you going to help your little boyfriend, little bitty Potter?" Bellatrix's words scarred themselves into Draco.
Potter's grin only grew, "That's the Draco we all know and love."
Bulstrode was trying to grab Pansy's fist in feeble attempts, but Pansy was relentless, hitting her with closed fists again and again and again. It wasn’t long before her hands were covered in blood.
"Are questions allowed, sir?" Potter asked, his fake innocence lacing his voice.
"Why did you tell her about the DA?" Potter questioned.
Crabbe and Goyle sat across from him. Draco dulled out their conversation. His skin crawled as they kept glancing at him. They looked at him to make sure he wouldn't lash out, to make sure he wouldn't snap their necks.
"Try not to tackle any tiny geniuses," Mafalda called after him.
"Wait, hold on-" Potter interrupted.
"And you cheated in potions," he took Potter's hand as they walked together down the tunnel.
"Draco, you can talk to me."
"They're volumes?" his head hurt at the thought.
He skittled to a stop in the empty hall. Umbridge probably cleared the area of students, making sure no one could get away. If he looked over the corner he could see Umbridge braking the door down to the Room of Hidden Things. Bile tickled the back of his throat. Panic clawed at his back. He sobbed, buckling as he gripped his hair.
"Ah yes, you have had an eventful evening," their Lord excused Draco. "Go, get some rest."
Potter gave him a warm smile before pulling out the exact same box from his pocket, tossing the present to Draco. "You're kidding me," Draco caught the small box. Potter shook his head as he started to giggle. Laughter spreading to Draco as well whenever he opened the present to reveal the same box of chocolates he had gotten for Potter.
Potter squirmed under Draco's grip, uncomfortable against the wall of the hall. The two boys stared at each other, each waiting to make their move.
Potter shook his head, "I didn't mean like that, I mean… shit, I'm bad at this," he faltered, his head in his hands. "I'm mad at everyone," he tried, "but I shouldn't be mad at you. I know why you don't want to be seen with me. I know that you have appearances to keep up or some shit like that, at lease I assume, I could be wrong… I'm not very good at this. All I know is that the Ministry is dragging my name through the mud and even some of my closest friends are distancing themselves from me and I can't turn to anyone because even Dumbledore's ignoring me. But here you are, you're nice and funny and smart and… you talk to me, not the Boy Who Lived or the Boy Who Lied. I should be thanking you for that, for seeing me, but instead I just get worked up and I say hurtful things that I don't mean. Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you, and I'm sorry I said all those things about your dad. My point is; you have your reasons for doing what you're doing, and I'm okay with that. Because I like you," he finished.
The class emptied, leaving only Severus and Draco.
Draco really likes Potter's smile. "Yeah," Potter grinned, before leaving to lunch.
"Fine, twenty points from both of you because I can't tell you apart," he challenged.
"Which one was that?" Draco asked.
He left the small room, his legs shaking as he walked back to the Common Room, taking his time. He wasn't truly ready for whatever mess Pansy left for him.
"How much progress?" Severus insisted.
Through his laughter, Draco managed to correct, "Malfoys do not snort,
Well, not exactly. While the Gryffindor's were writing lines with Umbridge's quill, he and the other Slytherins had been permitted to use their own quills.
In the end, Draco let Umbridge decide who was on the Inquisitorial Squad. Now he was stuck working with a bunch of assholes.
Potter stared down at his mirror. "I didn't get you anything."
"Yeah no shit, his mom's a whore and he has baggage no one wants to touch," proclaimed Daphne.
Draco and Daphne had managed to sneak away unnoticed, but they would be needed soon. They sat on a couple of large overturned pots, originally used for plants. Daphne had only plopped down on the make shift stool, unworried about the pale blue cloak she wore so often. Smoke curled along the ceiling as they bitched about their respected families.
Draco lay in bed, staring up at the canopy. His eyes felt heavy from both crying and lack of sleep.
The how was what Draco couldn't come to peace with. How could she do this to him? How could she torture him? How could she see what Draco was trying to do to himself that same night and not comfort him? She had distanced herself from him, he could reach her, no matter what he tried. He could allow himself to reach out, to close the distance that had grown between them. Draco had allowed this distance to fester, constantly pulling away from her. He was also at fault.
They arrived at Hogsmead. The weather was almost warm, so students lined the outside of shops eating sweets. Hogsmead was a quaint town, but the thought of this place always made Draco feel lighter from the memories. The couples in the street caused the perfect backdrop to his and Daphne's 'date'. Appearances had to be kept, after all.
Draco swallowed his shock passed the lump in his throat.
"But that's the best part," something twisted in Draco joked dryly.
Draco would have to be more careful, his first and only mistake was meeting Potter at the same time every time they met. He wouldn't be able to go tonight, the risk was too great.
“We can take him home then,” Sirius offered.
Daphne nodded, perhaps she could feel the blood pulsing through veins would soon be dripping onto the ground. Making the town red with something other than Valentine's Day decorations. Perhaps she could tell how he was twisting himself, peeling his own skin off, before the war had even started.
Severus clenched his fist in anger, Draco met his gaze with his own icy glare. "Besides," he held Severus's gaze, "why would I want to hurt her?" he asked.
"I haven’t even killed someone with my bare hands, perhaps he just has the thirst for it. You know?" Bellatrix continued.
They were outsiders in their own lives.
Never one to back down from a challenge, "Please Potter, my date was most definitely worse than yours."
Potter as of late had been less and less predictable. Usually he can make the more reasonable decision, if he is not being instigated. However, Potter might have been so intrigued with Draco's move that he did not mind drawing the attention of every student in Hogwarts. Paranoia at Potter's rash behavior clawed at Draco's back. What was stopping Potter from stopping Draco in the halls again, demanding answers that Draco didn't know? Drawing the attention of anyone, everyone, to the fact that Draco is a traitor. With that in mind, Draco turned down a hall and began to take the longest and least predictable path possible to Charms. At the very least, he would have a chance to think.

He didn't have time to monitor other student's behavior, but he had gotten involved, so now what was he supposed to do? He could tell Umbridge, but her form of punishment was barbaric. Even if the Weasley Twins were pricks, they were undeserving pricks. Telling McGonagall would be more merciful.
"Three. Voldemort has tried to kill me… a lot."
He turned to Dolohov, whose back was to him as he stood over an unconscious Longbottom. Longbottom was stunned on the floor. Blood was down his chin from his horribly bent nose. His wand in two on the floor under Dolohov's foot.
Draco held his Lord's gaze, bowing slightly as his Lord walked closer.
"Duties?" Draco croaked. What duties?
"Theo is useless," he explained.
"Really? No one's certain pulsing broomstick?" Daphne bumped his shoulder with hers.
A hand suddenly shoved Draco forward whenever Firenze asked for volunteers. He stumbled, managing not to fall, but there was no way for him to scamper back unnoticed. "I'll go," he formally volunteered after he felt everyone's gaze on him, not really having an idea of what he agreed to.
