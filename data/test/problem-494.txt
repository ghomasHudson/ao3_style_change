But hope, he couldn't deal with hope because he knew if he let it in, it would eventually cause the pain to come back. The horrible, heart shattering pain, that had destroyed him once before. And he'd spent too long running away to have to feel that pain again.
They stepped into the lift, Harry automatically signaling for the Department of Dark Art's floor while Dracona stared at him. A Ministry worker in dark robes walked up to the lift, saw them, blushed and abruptly turned around. Dracona rolled her eyes to the ceiling as the lift doors slid shut, and they were alone, and it was now or never. And she couldn't afford for it to be never.
It only took them about ten minutes to track down to Bellatrix's vault, the cart stopping along a hard-rocky ledge and opening to let first the goblin out, then Bellatrix, then the rest of them. The goblin stared balefully at them, waiting as they piled out of the cart. As Blaise's feet touched the rocky ledge, a horribly feeling sunk into him. He just
"Harry, we can't…" he tried, but Harry tilted his head, his lips soft in Draco’s, biting his bottom lip and sucking it into his mouth, and Merlin when had he learned to kiss like that?
"Harry," Draco said, grabbing his wrists and pulling his hands away. "Have you told anyone about this?"
"That's not—" he tried, but Dumbledore was talking again before he could finish what he was saying.
"What are you doing?" Weasley asked. “I thought you were taking us to Umbridge.”
"Come in," Severus called, lowering his tea to the table in front of him as Lucius sat himself down in a separate chair. At least, they were both dressed.
And now, he wanted nothing more than to scream and beg and plead and worm his way out of this. He was disgusted with himself for even thinking of it. He clamped his mouth shut; he wouldn't give Voldemort the satisfaction of being anything other than defiant. Voldemort's hands were freezing and greedy against his skin, his lips on his throat and then teeth, biting, drawing blood. He almost cried out when he felt the fingers reaching down his pants, tangling in the hair there and then pulling.
6:00 o'clock, right?" Malfoy stared at him, an eyebrow rising with a mixture of annoyance and amusement.
"As far as I know," Borgin answered. He shifted and cleared his throat as if he was about to admit something that made him mildly uncomfortable. "But I don't know where the other cabinet is, or if it even works."
"Headmaster Snape," she said, and he was sure he didn't imagine the way her voice twisted mockingly over his title. She smiled widely at him, ever reminiscent of a toad as she stepped up to his desk. "I'll be needing to see Harry Potter, Blaise Zabini, Luna Lovegood, and Lucius Malfoy, if it's all the same to you."
"You know," Lucius said finally. "I could make it go away. I still have quite a bit of influence in the Ministry."
"We'll let you know if we find your father," Malfoy interrupted. "Otherwise, let
"But you don't even know what I'm going to ask you."
Draco whimpered, his legs trembling beneath him. He could
his emotions rule him. His father had always taught him it was best to keep a tight rein on his emotions, to show a calm, collected front, to never let anyone know what he was thinking. All that went up in smoke as he climbed; obviously
"I didn’t think you were that close to him," Harry said, green eyes locking on Draco with an uncomfortable intensity.
Well, his mistake.
"I couldn't agree more," someone said. Hermione jumped, and Ron scowled, his face coloring red as he stood.
"Oh," she blinked as if no one had ever thought to ask her this. And maybe they hadn't with all the strange things she said on a daily basis. "They're little creatures that crawl in your ears and make your brains go all fuzzy," she answered, smiling contentedly at him.
Draco lay in bed, glaring at the ceiling and thinking. No—he wasn't thinking because there wasn't anything to think about. Potter was absolutely wrong. His father was wrong. And still, he couldn't stop the words from echoing around in his head. 'Sometimes people do stupid things when they're trying to protect you. They think not telling you means you can't be hurt, but in the end all it does is hurt you more.' His emerald green eyes had been so open, so honest. Draco was sure he'd never seen another person look at him like that, much less Potter.
"Because she told me what she was going to do."
Draco filed hand in the hair as a trigger as he put both his hands on Harry's chest, gliding them down until one rested on his stomach and the other was laying on edge of his robe. Harry pulled away from the kiss, gasping and wide-eyed. His eyes flicked down to Draco's hands and then back up, and then he was kissing Draco again like he was going to die if he didn't, and Draco was reaching under his robes wrapping his hand around Harry‘s cock and loving the gasped groan Harry moaned against his mouth.
"Potter's trying to sneak out of the castle," Blaise blurted. He didn't know why he did it. It wasn't like telling Loon-
"Then why join this group?"
They were in the middle of the corridor, the only light being Blaise's lit wand that cast shadows across the stone walls and frowning portraits. It was past curfew, and if anyone passed by they would be in definite trouble. Well, Potter wouldn't probably be in that much trouble what with all the rumors of how much he wandered the halls at night, but it
"Wait—"
"He doesn't need to know," Harry turned his face abruptly away, his lips pressed flat, looking frustrated now.
"So, if I wanted a girlfriend, you wouldn't care," Potter snapped irritably.
"There are different kinds of abuse, Draco," Blaise answered. And Draco hated how his voice had gone soft as if he was afraid Draco would suddenly break.
"Father?" He tried again. "Wha… what's-."
"And why isn't it?" Severus answered. He sounded annoyed, perhaps offended, but there was nothing Lucius could do about it. He couldn't just snap his fingers and change the way he'd been raised to believe after all. Severus stood, depositing his tea on the table next to Lucius' and crossing over to the window. After a moment, Lucius joined him.
"Just so," Dumbledore answered, his eyes twinkling approvingly over at him. But Draco didn't want his approval. Not when the truth was that he had also reminded him of Dumbledore. The difference was that his father and Slughorn manipulated to help themselves while Dumbledore manipulated to help the world. Yet, somehow it didn't make it feel any better when he was the one being manipulated. Harry's emerald eyes flashed back to lock on his and Draco knew he understood what he was thinking, whether he agreed with him or not was another story. "I tell you this to put you on your guard, Harry. He will undoubtably try to collect you. You will be the jewel of his collection."
"Draco, I know you're in there." Lucius' voice called out. "You're the only one of these brats who could possibly know this spell." A pause. "I have some of your friends out here, the pretty blonde-haired one. You don't want me to hurt her, do you?"
"There's only one place he
"You're awake," Draco answered, looking up. Harry blinked at him, green eyes staring in that way he had when Draco was being particularly annoying. "Are you in a lot of pain?" he asked, leaning forward. He had to clench his fists against the impulse to reach forward and pat Harry down, to make sure Severus hadn't missed a spot, to make sure Draco really hadn't done permanent damage to him.
would rather have an unruly out of control werewolf than him, calm, in control, Lucius.
"Lovegood," Draco answered, and she frowned at him but stopped.
No, it wasn't that he hadn't been paying attention. He'd seen, it was just that he'd been hurt that Harry wasn't talking to him. As if he expected one success to make Harry suddenly trust him explicitly.
"And," Harry hesitated and then changed his mind. He just wasn't ready to admit that he'd rather be kissing Draco Malfoy. Not to Hermione and Ron. "Nothing," he muttered, "it's nothing." He sighed. "I should really be going to bed." He stood and headed to his dorm.
"I don't either, Draco," he answered. He wished he could snap his fingers and give Draco everything he wanted as he'd always done. But this time was different. This time they were both lost.
"Are you cold?" he asked, running a hand down Harry's back. Most of the blood was down the drain, the warm water up to Harry's chest, but he was still trembling against his hands.
"Hedwig?" Harry asked. The bundle Neville had was, in fact, Hedwig. And not only that but she was obviously wounded. "Neville, what happened?" He moved to take Hedwig and she hopped gratefully onto his waiting wrist, fluffing her ruffled feathers. He noticed she was holding one of her wings oddly and hoped it wasn't broken.
"Ron—" Harry started, but Ron was already stomping away, making his way toward the common room entrance. "Where are you going?" Harry scrambled after him, slipping out of the portrait behind Ron and struggling to keep up.
"You must know I wish to help you," Lucius said before Severus could speak. And Severus blinked at him, looking surprised and startled for a long moment, before his eyebrows come down over his eyes, and he frowned at Lucius as if waiting for some trap.
"I-," Draco started and then let out a breath. This, at least, was easier. "Yes," he took a few careful steps forward, coming close enough to talk comfortably with Lupin but still refusing to sit.
He'd been waiting by the fireplace for a long time. Too long to be acceptable. He'd known Narcissa knew what he was doing, but he didn't much care—she knew how he felt. They had spent one passionless night together a little over a year ago—after years of working themselves up to doing it at all. They'd both been relieved when Narcissa had turned out pregnant from it. It wasn't that they hated each other; they actually were good company when they were in the mood. It was simply that the marriage wasn't what either of them had wanted.
"I've screwed up so bad, father," Draco said, resting his head lightly in his hands. Lucius just looked at him. Draco looked tired. So tired, and Lucius had nothing to help him with.
that would have made Vernon want to explode more.
He wasn't exactly surprised when he found out that Slughorn had been the potions Professor, at least, not as surprised as Harry had seemed to be. The man just didn't seem like he had the guts to teach something like Defense Against the Dark Arts.
The East wing of the Fifth floor was completely covered in the swamp left behind by the twins and no one was able to actually cross it. Of course, if the hidden smiles behind a couple of teacher's hands were anything to go by they knew exactly how to end it, but he didn't feel the need to tell Umbridge that. Eventually, the corridor was just roped off and students were expected to make their way around as best as they could.
“This is bad,” Lucius said.
"What!" Weasley exclaimed.
"I promise." Harry answered, squeezing Draco's hand.
"Well, Sirius," Dumbledore said, continuing to smile. "I'll be off. I do hope you have a good rest of your summer." Sirius nodded distractedly as Dumbledore turned and strode down the street, looking as if he didn't have a care in the world.
"I think you should talk to him," Hermione said, which wasn't exactly new advice.
He'd refused to help when Dumbledore had said there was a chance at saving Sirius Black. He didn't care if there was a chance. If it were up to him, he'd let Sirius Black be kissed. He'd send him back to Azkaban to rot. Maybe he didn't commit the crime he was accused of, but he was still guilty of plenty. So, Hermione had gone by herself, insisting that she couldn't stand by and do nothing. He supposed she had saved him, he'd never asked.
They milled around the office for a long time, no one saying anything before the fireplace lit up into emerald flames and Dumbledore stepped out, followed immediately by Sirius. Dumbledore ignored him at first, choosing to walk toward his desk and place a featherless Fawkes down on his perch. Sirius, however, came right over to Harry. He hovered, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and looking down at him with a slight frown marring his features.
come and find him. But he didn't. So, Harry found himself trudging up to the infirmary like he did every day, but this time when he walked in, Draco's bed was empty. He stopped dead, staring at it and feeling panic shoot through him.
He clenched his jaw and forced his mind to constrict. He would feel fear, desire to help his lord, and nothing else. He would not think about Lu- No. He would feel fear, desire to help his lord, and nothing else. There was room in his mind for nothing else.
"Yeah," he muttered, sitting next to Luna. "Hey."
"No, reading memories, even thoughts is different. This is..." Draco trailed off, focusing on Harry. He blinked and then seemed to realize what exactly he was doing. He tensed, beginning to pull away, his silver-grey eyes narrowing and turning away until Harry couldn't read them anymore. But his walls weren't quite up quick enough for Harry this time. "My apologies," he said. "I shouldn't have—"
Lupin was only holding him by his shoulder now. He'd used magic to tie Draco's hands together behind his back, the robes coarse as they rubbed his wrists together. Harry was walked a little to the side, a little in front. He could still see them but was in plain view of Lupin, and Draco could tell from the set of his shoulders that he was panicking.
When Lucius had asked him, he had been nodding before he really knew what he was agreeing to. Because really, what was the point? There were no parents to force the issue, no people to impress with a big political marriage, no children they needed to have to keep the Malfoy line intact. There was no
After the third time Lovegood passed the center of the corridor, she stopped, and Draco watched as a door began to appear along the wall. It was large and ornate and moved aside easily when Lovegood pushed on it. When they stepped inside, the room was huge and filled to the brim with garbage. There were obvious pathways everywhere but where they're weren't pathways, there were mountains and mountains of junk on top of junk, and Draco wondered belatedly how they were ever going to find one single Diadem in the mess.
"Severus!" he gasped, his arms closing around Severus' waist and pulling him up before he could hit the floor. He grunted but made no effort to stand on his own. Lucius was too warm. He was always too warm on nights like these. "It's about damn time," Lucius muttered, and he suddenly felt like laughing. Lucius
The silence was so long Harry wondered if Draco had just walked away. He couldn’t bring himself to look up from the ground to check, and he flinched when he felt Draco’s fingers slide across his cheek, soft and affectionate before moving to lift his chin. It was harder to meet his eyes then it should have been—then it had ever been before.
is, for Quidditch—like I didn't see right through that."
"I did no such thing!" Lucius interrupted. "Harry went off on his own. I only went after him."
"What?!" Zabini said, and the girl just stared at him, her eyes bright and understanding and worried as she helped him lift Harry to his feet. He gritted his teeth against his cry of pain, and they made their way toward Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. And Lucius hoped against hope that there was something worth finding inside.
they became a problem… He was running down a windowless passage with Mr. Weasley right next to him…. Suddenly the memories warped, and Harry was drawing nearer and nearer to a plain black door, expecting,
"Nonsense," Blaise answered, his smile wide and charming. "You're right on time, everyone else is just late."
Severus was right, deep down Harry
"Well," Draco said, smiling thinly. He really was an absolute idiot. "I think I'd rather be anywhere else."
"I'm not allowed to want to kiss you?" he answered, and Harry's blush darkened. Draco almost smiled, but he stopped himself at the last second. It felt good to be able to get a reaction from Harry, to be the only one to get that reaction from him.
He'd never meant to involve Draco in any of this. Any of this. It was only supposed to be Potter; Potter that he talked to and—he couldn’t risk Draco finding out. He just couldn’t look into those silver-grey eyes and see the surprise and—
The next day brought a change to the way Hogwarts was run. Umbridge was made the high inquisitor. Harry shook his head, letting his fringe fall into his eyes as he wondered what
Lupin was in chains in front of him, his eyes sunken in, bags heavy under his eyes. He looked emaciated, horribly skinny, and Draco couldn’t help the sense of satisfaction that ran through him at sight. After all the manipulation Lupin pulled on him, all the hate he’d directed at Harry, he deserved to suffer.
," Malfoy said, breaking the silence after what felt like forever.
Thanks for all your wonderful comments!!
you looking for, then? You must be going for something."
"Have you forgotten our talk so soon, Draco?" Potter sneered, his lips twisting in an ugly smile, almost as if he could read what Draco had thought about him. "
"No," Harry answered. "I think I scared him when I drove him out of my mind."
"I wanted this to matter."
"This is my mind," Draco said. The landscape was done up in shades of blue and white, the air shimmering with blue flecked crystals that burned along Harry's skin like ice. There was low cut grass across the ground that itched Harry's feet and far off in the distance there stood a single towering building that could have been anything and was too far away to truly make out. It was completely breathtakingly beautiful, but the more Harry looked, the colder it seemed, the more dangerous it seemed. As it you could be lured in by the beauty and then frozen by the hidden ice within.
The most exciting thing that happened over the next couple of weeks was the so called 'flight to freedom' of the Weasley Twins. Umbridge had been furious about their departure while the rest of the student body was just completely overwhelmed with glee that
"You were never there for me. You never asked me if I was alright. You chose to believe in a version of me that suited you, and even when everything about me didn't fit that version that you'd made, you still convinced yourself he existed. That's not friendship. I'm not even sure what that is."
Draco was early to his scheduled meeting with Dumbledore. He didn't exactly want to be sitting in the headmaster's office, letting Dumbledore stare at him for an overly long time, but he would have rather been there than in the Great Hall while the rest of the student body came back from the holidays. Him being there for Harry's departure hadn't exactly been his greatest idea, after all.
As it turned out, Malfoy wasn't in his office when he finally mustered the courage to show up. There was no sigh of his grey eyes or his blonde hair, no sign of his absurd dressing or Harry's papers scattered across the floor as if he'd been sitting on his desk again. And the whole space just suddenly felt very empty without him there.
"Bullshite," Draco snapped.
"We should probably go to bed."
"So?"
"I hear you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?" Dumbledore said, twinkling blue eyes already moving over to Harry.
Malfoy broke off, hesitating for a long minute before joining the jeering. Harry ducked his head to hide the clenching of his teeth. He didn't care what kind of relationship he had with Malfoy, he had
"Have you considered the possibility I just don't want to be chased? That maybe you're really just an annoyance to me?" Harry answered, hearing the snap in his voice but ignoring it. Draco visibly recoiled, turning away from Harry with a scowl. And Harry hated the pang of regret that shot through him.
"I- of course, I-."
Warning: Minor violence
So, the simple truth was that there was no reason to be married. Lucius obviously just hadn’t thought it through. He was simply bound to change his mind before Severus even had to say another word about the arrangement.
"Shut it, Zabini," Nott snapped. “It’s not my fault the Dark Lord put a mutt in charge of Hogwarts when he could have just asked me!”
“Nott, I believe is only on house arrest because he's so young,” Lucius said, turning the conversation away. “But I doubt the Wizengamot will rule in his favor."
"What?" Draco blinked. Severus ignored him.
"Lucius," Dumbledore sighed as if he were being very put upon. "I can't give you anything yet. It will take a while before the Ministry will approve you being here throughout the school year. As for your son, he's already enrolled and will continue to be."
"What?"
"Draco Malfoy says I not to be telling Harry Potter," Dobby said, trying to grab hold of the desk again.
He paced across the room to get his wand, ducking under some misplaced spell that was most certainly not an
," Severus answered, narrowing his eyes dangerously, "because you already know the answer."
"You didn't," Draco said, turning back to Blaise, who simply smiled, winked, and released his shoulder. And then he was turning back to Longbottom, and they were disappearing back into the crowd.
"Everyone's staring," Neville said after they'd finally found an empty compartment. Harry dragged Draco down next to him, refusing to let go of his hand and give him a reasonable excuse to run off again. Neville and Luna relaxed against the opposite seats. "They're even looking at us because we're with you." He gestured vaguely to Luna and himself.
Eventually, The Dark Lord was satisfied, and he let Severus return to Hogwarts. He stepped out of the floo and almost immediately collapsed. He would have face planted into the carpet if Lucius hadn't caught him.
He hadn't meant to... Yes, he wanted to open Harry up, make him feel and trust Draco again, but not by hurting him. Draco had never really wanted to hurt Harry, not even when they were standing on opposite sides from each other, screaming insults and trying to get each other to come undone.
"But couldn't you already-,"
"And yet," Dumbledore said, his face solemn. "I must apologize again and ask that you repeat this nothing for us."
"He'll have his own room," Lucius insisted. "And I
“No further questions,” Rodrick Jones said. He stepped away from the witness stand, smirking blatantly across the open space. He was every bit as horrible as Lucius had warned, his persecution style aimed to humiliate.
much. "It's about the fact that
"I know," Draco murmured, clutching Harry closer to him, cradling him to his chest and tucking his head under his chin. And it was a long time before either of them spoke again. Long enough that he thought Harry had dropped the subject. Long enough that the bath water started growing cold around them, and Draco was about to suggest getting out and rinsing off. But then Harry was speaking, his voice soft in the still air of the bathroom.
"Potter," Professor Snape's voice had broken through his thoughts, bringing him back to the present. And he realized he was crying like a child, curling in on himself as if he really expected Professor Snape to hit him. He flushed and tried to step away but had to bite his lip to hold back the cry of pain. Professor Snape sighed and gestured to the door. He hesitated but Professor Snape just continued to watch him as he made his way out of the tunnels and up to the third floor corridor. He watched for Hermione and Ron, but someone must have already taken them, because he saw no sign of them as he passed through the tests with Professor Snape behind him.
He sat back in the seat, trying to tune back into the conversation. What was
look good turned purple. And it would be all your fault."
He'd saved Severus. But Sirius had died.
"You forgive me?" she asked.
may be in danger right now." Harry said. "I need to find him and help him."
Then Lucius stepped back again, closing his mouth and face off with an audible snap. He looked straight into Severus' eyes for another couple seconds before turning on his heel and leaving the office with a loud slam of the door. Severus watched him go, his eyes wide.
"I couldn't. You were-."
"You believe he has a right to be?" Lucius asked, truly curious though he couldn't for the life of him understand why.
Malfoy looked down at Harry, his lips parted as he panted and then his lips twisted, and he smirked, eyes dancing with amusement. A pang went through Harry's chest. He knew Malfoy was only using him to get off. To feel a sense of triumph over The Boy Who Lived. This would probably be all over school tomorrow. But right now, Harry couldn't think about anything besides that hand right above his aching member and Malfoy’s other hand wrapped tightly around Malfoy himself.
"Ron, you know-."
"Oh, and how comes your Animagus transformations?"
a new voice called, and Lupin sagged against the ground, leaving Harry panting and gasping and looking up at him as Luna and Blaise approach them.
"Fiendfire," he muttered.
"I suppose," Severus answered. He looked around the now empty office. He would probably have to move his things in soon, but he wasn't in the mood right now. Though if he was being honest with himself, he would never be in the mood. He would never understand why Dumbledore had insisted he become the new headmaster and not Minerva. But then, he would never understand half the things that went through the old fool's mind.
"Severus," Draco's father's voice was quiet, his eyes still firmly locked on the contents of his teacup. "Draco did nothing wrong."
"Hey," he said automatically, his hand half raising in an awkward wave.
“I know we haven’t been together officially for very long,” Lucius had said, and his eyes had shone, silver and bright and careful, his long hair falling down his back in a braid as he stood by Severus’ chair. “But I think it’s time we were married.” And he’d held out the ring, silver and emblazoned with the Malfoy crest as if it was something horribly precious and not… a ring with too many oaths that Severus would have to swear to keep.
Blaise was the first to spot him. Harry could tell by his muffled yell, and then Luna was shouting an answering spell, and Harry was turning too slow, Voldemort's snakelike face smiling coldly at them. Blaise and Luna had both been disarmed, their wands in the hands of two Death Eaters standing just to the right of Voldemort. They looked like twins; the same pointed thin features and blonde hair as they stared back.
“Probably why they tell you not to eat so much candy,” Harry answered, and Draco couldn’t help staring at him.
"Who?"
"Now where
"Hmm," Potter answered, raising an eyebrow. He didn't move, he just continued to lean on the wall looking for all the world as if he was completely relaxed. The Slytherins, however, were obviously panicked, sweating and shifting nervously. "Funny thing though," Potter said finally, "it didn't look to me as if Malfoy was having fun." He turned his emerald green eyes on Draco, intense and calculating. "Were you?"
"Of course, Father," Draco said, meeting his father's eyes for half a second before turning away.
Draco lunged, and Harry was
"Really," he said.
"Then why….?" Harry had asked that night on the astronomy tower back when he’d thought they still had a chance. Back when he thought it might work between them. He just hadn’t wanted to accept the truth.
"There was nothing I could have done," Harry whispered, his green eyes wide, desperate, flicking to Draco, back to Lupin and then locking on Draco's face.
HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST:
"We should keep moving," he said finally, and Draco knew better than to push any more at the minute.
The room was about what he expected, all whites, silvers, and greens with large furniture and a large blazing fireplace. Draco sat in the absolute center of the room, sitting crossed legged on a large Slytherin green couch.
"Where is here?"
Draco asks for help.
"No," Potter said, which didn't exactly explain anything, but his tone made it clear that further questions would not be welcome. So, maybe not the safe answer then.
"Because I wouldn't mean it, and, unlike you, I don't apologize for things I don't mean," Severus answered, not even bothering to look over at him. Lucius tightened his grip on his cane but decided to let it go. For now.
"If you want to," Draco answered, and then stepped away from him. It felt so final. He was always stepping away from Harry. But then he couldn't. He just couldn't. He'd been the cause of his mother's loss of sanity; he couldn't be the reason Harry lost his life too.
horrible," Draco said finally. Weasley was, after all the only probable conclusion to why Hermione was crying. She seemed to have a strange soft stop for him, which Draco didn’t understand at all. Hermione gave a strange little hiccupping laugh, but to her credit didn't ask how he knew it was Weasley's fault.
"This is where he killed him," Harry said, making Draco come up short.
Lupin the truth; it was a betrayal of Harry, and they were already on slippery enough ground. And yet, it felt as though he could trust Lupin. He felt as though there was nothing to really worry about.
"Yes, and now I'm saying he may need my help," he answered. Dobby trembled as he thought about it. Then finally:
"But-."
been there during Draco’s full moons.
“The problem is that we don’t have a solid enough defense for the accusation of Headmaster Snape’s relationship with Mr. Potter,” Woods said. Severus kept his head down, his hands clasped together on top of the table. This whole thing was so exhausting. He wanted to be back at Hogwarts, wrapped around Lucius. He wanted to be getting married. He wanted to not regret to way he’d let Harry stay so close to him for so many years. Harry had needed him, and that shouldn’t have made him look guilty, but few things about his life had been fair.
"I've never been up here before," Malfoy muttered, drawing up to the rail alongside Harry.
"But that's so wrong," Ginny shook her head. "To himself
"I…" Lupin hesitated. "I'm not sure. Someone's in the castle. It must be Nott; who else would have set the Fiendfire?" Harry frowned at him while Draco nodded.
"Well," Harry pushed away from his wall, stepping subtly toward the door. "I'll be going now," he turned, pulling the door open.
"What was that, my boy?" Slughorn said, turning back to them.
"Neville Longbottom?" Severus answered. "He's actually a Gryffindor."
," Lucius answered, and Severus flinched back, his face a mask of cold shock. And Lucius was forced to acknowledge just how right Harry had been. Severus really did think he meant nothing to Lucius. "I don't know how you've gotten the idea that you don't matter to me, but-."
"No," Harry answered, but Lucius was already waving his wand and there was tea on the table, pouring itself into a cup for him.
"He cast a charm on it," Severus said, his fingers so tight around the locket, his hand was turning white.
Honestly, Severus was surprised it had lasted three days.
So, he moved on. It was perfectly easy. As easy as it always was for him to look away when a pretty face drew his attention.
—why wouldn't they stop? His throat hurt, and he hurt, and he was trembling—couldn't seem to stop trembling.
." Draco shivered violently, his whole body wracking as if it were remembering the pain he was trying to suppress. "I almost got away once, that was when my father broke my ankle. Other than that…" He shrugged. "They were mostly just waiting for Harry to show up."
"Come along, Harry," Black said, stepping up alongside them. Harry immediately dropped his hand with a hard scowl.
"Well," Draco said, turning toward the Slytherin commons. "See you next Monday, Potter."
"I don't know," Draco snapped. "Maybe I'll ask Lupin for help since he apparently doesn't lie to me," and Harry couldn't help it. He flinched at the words, snapping away from Draco and feeling the words press down on him. Draco wasn't wrong to think it. Harry was sure Lupin wouldn't lie about werewolf things to Draco, where Harry lied about everything.
didn’t want to hear. Before Harry said something he couldn’t take back.
"When you got assigned to work the case with me, you said you didn't protest. Why not?" he asked again, and he would be lying if he said the answered hadn't been burning at him. Malfoy sighed, putting his fork down.
"You're trying to manipulate me,” he snapped. "I thought—"
He pulled his hand away from Harry's, leading him to set his own hand next to Draco's head, so he could prop his weight up. And Draco stared at his face, the tip of his finger against Harry's cheekbone, the bags under his eyes, down his nose, the hollow of his cheek, down his chin, and finally back up to his lips. And Harry opened his mouth, his breath hot against Draco's fingers as he panted, face flushed and eyes full of desire.
He could feel claws at his throat, the stench of death in his nose while his mother screamed behind him. He saw flashes of the starch whiteness of Malfoy Manor stained with blood as he choked on his own blood, Greyback’s eyes red and full of a madness as he leaned over him.
"What are you hiding from him?"
"Haven't we got a counterjinx for this?" Fudge was saying. "So, she can speak freely?"
"We should-," Harry started just to end the tension in the room, but Draco was already talking over him, apparently having anticipated how he would change the subject.
"Well, the feeling's mutual," Draco answered, trying to step around her. Pansy immediately moved out of his way, skittering a step away as if she was... afraid of him? But Nott was suddenly there, blocking him, smirk widening as he faced Draco.
"That was Chang's friend?" Draco asked, raising a hand to cover his smile. "What a shock."
"Severus," Draco answered, immediately sitting up straight in his chair and putting his book away. He wasn't about to be scolded for something stupid like posture or not paying attention just because Severus was so obviously agitated about something.
"Malfoy!" he snapped, trying to wiggle out of his grasp. "What are you doing!? Get
"Wait, Severus," he hissed. "I have a task for you, yet."
Needless to say, with Hermione breathing down his neck, he didn't have much time to sneak off to the Room of Requirement or work on the vanishing cabinet, no matter how much he needed to. Nott's beady eyes lingered on his back, the incessant reminder that he was being watched, that he needed to be making progress. More than once, he woke up in a cold sweat to a dream half forgotten that had involved torture and pain. He was never sure if it was his own or someone else's.
(See the end of the chapter for
else in the room did it too, he knew it was bad.
"I—I don't know what to think, okay?" he answered. He didn't know what to make of Snape and Draco's conversation. He didn't know if one—or both—were acting, playing at trying to get something from the other or if they were just talking about something he didn't understand. He didn't know if he wanted to know. He knew he needed to. "Right now, I just know that I can't trust him," he said, and Hermione sighed.
And then he understood. Draco hadn't brought him here because he'd wanted him. He'd brought him here because he'd needed to tell him about Occlumency. Harry flushed in humiliation, dropping his eyes to the ground and refusing to look up.
But in his head, he was determined. Determined not to leave it alone. Determined to speak to Lupin. Determined to get answers.
"And do you really believe he will be pleased if you hand the Ministry one of his secrets? One of his bargaining chips as it were?" he asked and was satisfied when Nott's look wavered. "Get out, Mr. Nott, and don't come back until you really have something to bargain with."
“That there was nothing I could have done,” Draco whispered, leaning forward to rest his head on Harry’s shoulder, his fingers squeezing his wrist.
Potter was a murderer.
However, the Monday after Potter's date, Draco was forced to accept the possibility that Potter just couldn’t make smart decisions, whether he was around Draco or not.
Draco would have howled, except Malfoy’s did not howl. "You've been letting The Dark Lord into your mind for
disturbed by something.
"I have no idea," Snape answered, still looking at Harry with his cold dark eyes. Snape turned away, closing the door behind him with a severe snap. And he didn't know why he had ever thought this man would help him.
"I think I'm starting to."
"I could have," Draco answered, his shoulders shifting as if he would pull away, and Harry half hoped he would. The other part, the part he tried to bury, hoped he would move closer. "I was out of control."
"Please," Pansy suddenly stepped forward, her voice low and pleading. "Please, we didn't mean it." Potter crossed his arms, looking down at her with no pity in his eyes. Draco shivered, Potter looked… he looked as if Pansy could drop dead right in front of him and he couldn't care less.
Hermione laughed while Harry and Weasley continued to look somewhere between confused and panicked.
And he still had no idea how they'd gotten into the alley. Not that he could care right then.
Harry went to move his hands but found his wrists still bound to the floor. His eyes widened in alarm, but Malfoy just quirked his lips in an almost smile. And he found himself relaxing. The tiny part of himself that was still sane was asking him
"I can't believe you didn't tell him," Potter said, not even bothering to look up from his grape. "As if waiting longer will make it better."
Harry forced a smile at Slughorn but said nothing as the man approached. It was obvious from his body language that he hated the attention, but this too Slughorn either chose to ignore or didn't see completely. Weasley just scowled as he was ignored, and Hermione gave a small uncomfortable smile.
"I can get you money," Harry promised. "Just let me and my friend go, then we can-."
“Hmm,” Severus said, and he was staring into the fire again, that unreadable look in his dark eyes. That look that Lucius had thought they’d gotten rid of after Voldemort had died. But ever since he’d proposed, it was like Severus had frozen.
Draco was clutching Harry’s hand in his, his fingers intertwined tightly against the coolness of the August weather. He kept looking back, asking what Harry wanted to do, asking if he was alright with something Draco obviously wanted, tugging him along by his hand as if he had no intention of letting go.
"Two mens be breaking in," she said, her voice a high squeak. "One of them had a nasty horrible ring. Yanla try to stop him, but he hads master in the drawing room, and Yanla not knows what to do. He says he wants money, but master no give him anything."
could do this to Harry. Only him.
"I know you're awake," the voice said. It was soft, thoughtful, and obviously masculine. And since Severus would never touch him like this and he was still angry with his father, that left only-
"How do you even know where you're going?" Draco asked, trailing behind Potter as they plotted along in the forest. Potter had showed up outside Draco's room after lunch, shoving his way in and saying that Draco needed to be in the forest as early as possible if he was still going through with changing in the forest. Draco had protested that he could do it himself, but Potter had just raised an eyebrow and ignored everything he'd said. So, there they were, tramping through the forest while Potter searched for a suitable place for Draco to turn that night.
"Why?"
"Then you should have come and got me!" Severus insisted, shaking his head, long hair flying everywhere as he did. And he looked agitated, angry, and… hurt. And Lucius was only just beginning to realize how hurt. "You should never have left without me!"
"Why did you try and run into a house after Dumbledore when you
Being in his bobcat form was always simpler. It always—always—put things into perspective.
They stepped out of the house in the early morning, not bothering to say goodbye. He figured they didn't much care where he was. Well, unless Vernon was feeling particularly abusive. Snape offered his elbow, looking down at him expectantly but making no other move to touch him.
"Yes, of course," Lucius answered, stepping aside to let Severus into the infirmary. He swept in, heading for Draco's bed with Lucius on his heels. Draco was on his back, the blood-stained clothes he'd arrived in gone, replaced by a crisp white button up and slacks. His throat was covered in thick white bandages extending partway down his chest.
He hated that Harry had every right to be.
"Now isn't the time to debate this," Lucius interrupted before Draco had the chance to retort. "You should rest," he told Harry. "And I'm sure we have work to do," he glanced at Severus, who gave one stiff nod before standing.
"Is that so?" Draco's eyes narrowed. "Is that what my father said? To stay away from me?" Harry stared, blinking at Draco for a long time before he realized exactly what he was talking about. And then he felt like laughing. If only everything was that simple.
"I am sorry for your loss, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said. "Though I still do not quite understand what has brought you to us?"
He climbed down from the Astronomy tower slowly, already feeling the ache for Harry start in stomach as he moved down the steps. He almost didn't notice the glare that was directed at him, and when he did, he thick coil of anger climbed inside him. Somewhere deep down, he knew it was irrational, but that didn’t stop him from being annoyed that his plans of moping about after Harry’s disappearance had been interrupted.
"What?"
"What?!" the Dark Lord hissed, his red snake eyes focusing on Severus with such malice that he was sure he'd just made a mistake.
want there to be a next time?" Draco asked.
"Well," Severus raised an eyebrow. "If that's all, you can go."
"Wow." Ron whistled. "What'd he do?” Hermione promptly smacked him on the arm.
"Very well," she sighed, pouring two cups of tea and handing one to him. He immediately set his down on the edge of her desk and locked his hands together in his lap. She sighed again but just sat across from him, her own tea steaming in her hands. "Did you see Draco?"
"Because I don't like it."
"Hmm," Lupin smiled easily at her. "Then I suggest you all get to lunch; I'd hate for you to miss it."
Draco returned Theodore's sneer easily, watching as he and Pansy glared back at him. It was just his luck that on a day like this, they would be the only students inside.
"Well, she only talks to Ravenclaws," Lovegood answered. "And very rarely about herself."
"Well, I don't really care what you want," Shacklebolt answered, staring Harry down from across his desk. He had on his no-nonsense face, which was getting progressively more no-nonsense since Harry had come in. But seriously. This was
"I love you," Draco whispered, his breath moving Harry's hair against his scalp, and Harry relaxed, tension leaving that Draco hadn't even realized was there. He brushed his hand against Draco's shoulder, feather light before slipping out of his arms, standing and stepping out of the bath, water dripping off him and onto the tiles below. He grabbed a towel, wrapping it around himself as if Draco hadn't seen him naked as he walked toward the door. He stopped with his hand on the knob, the door half open, not bothering to turn and look back.
Not that he could particularly make himself care what they thought. They had judged him the whole year 5
want anything to do with Harry. He’d probably sent Hermione a note so she could take the responsibility away from him, and Hermione had just gotten the wrong idea.
"Nothing
"What about Ron?"
“What does that mean?”
His eyes caught on startling green and he froze, for some reason unable to look away. Something tugged in the back of his mind, some reminder of something that wasn't the here—that wasn't the need for blood and death and hunger. He snuffled and took one lumbering step closer to the small feline in front of him.
"You upset
And Severus
Potter snatched the snitch from air, so fast Draco almost didn't see his hand fly out. Anger flashed through him. He'd distracted him on
"Like the room of requirement?"
So, he’d been in Severus’ private rooms, feeling as if he should be crying but knowing he wouldn't be able to. Cedric was dead. He owed it to him to cry. But he couldn't. Cedric was dead.
"Wait!" Harry said, pulling his hand out of Draco’s. “Are you saying you only got close to me, so you could spy for the Order?"
Lucius snapped his wand in the direction of Yaxley, who was just turning toward him and watched as the man collapsed. He heard Severus' voice echoing him just ahead, and Lucius pushed himself to run even faster, trying to catch up before Severus got too far.
"And I think we should focus less on repelling your attacks and more on stopping them from happening all together."
Thanks so much for reading! Your comments are awesomesauce!
Draco was a fallen angel, all white blond hair, shimmering eyes, high cheekbones, and sharp delicate angles that were somehow just as masculine as any other boy. He radiated beauty and Harry knew he had the power to break him with just a few words.
"I mean, there's Severus..."
And also, so sorry for the lateness of this one!
"Harry, wait," he said, crossing around the table as fast as he could. He reached out, but the twisted snarl on Harry's lips stopped his hand.
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly; Malfoy's eyes flicked up to him, then away. He put another piece of ravioli delicately in his mouth. Harry resisted the urge to sigh. He supposed he deserved the silent treatment after the way he'd shot down the previous topics. He didn't even know
Draco seeks an answer to his problems, Harry talks to a Mind-Healer, and Severus faces a new challenge.
"Why? Why can't I die if I want to?"
"Are you capable of laughing, Potter?" Lucius answered, moving across the room to sit crossed legged on the sofa, and Harry followed him over, sitting across from the pureblood.
"What lesson?" Severus sighed. "The fact that you still have a heart, Harry? There's nothing wrong with that."
"Maybe because I knew you'd act like a spoiled child," Draco said, and Harry flinched, opening his mouth to protest, but Draco talked over him. "Mourning wrongs done to you instead of saying 'congratulations, Draco, on not becoming evil like your parents.' Which by the way, is the only reason they let someone like me in. To spy for them because I'm
He jumped when the howl pierced through the air around them. The sharp unmistakable sound of a Werewolf howl, and as the breaking of branches and the rushing of bushes sounded, he suddenly knew without a doubt what Nott had wanted them to find. What Draco and Potter had been too preoccupied with to listen to him about. What he suddenly, horribly wished he didn't know about Draco Malfoy.
"It's lunch time?" he asked finally. Draco tried to check his sigh. As wonderful as yesterday had been, he couldn't let himself forget that Harry had other problems. Problems like not eating and not sleeping. Though admittedly, he seemed to have slept fine last night.
But that didn't mean being together was the answer.
"I came to speak to you," Malfoy answered. "Obviously."
"Into the forest?" Draco raised an eyebrow suspiciously. He took a step forward, reaching in his pocket and wrapping a hand around his wand. Just because Hagrid was supposedly in the order didn’t mean Draco would be opposed to hitting him with a good stupefy.
"He wasn't alone," Harry muttered.
"I don't care about your fun," Dracona stepped forward, her fingers tight on her wand.
"Harry," Draco groaned, already chasing after him.
He hesitated for half a second before dropping his now well lubricated fingers down to circle Harry's balls and then his entrance. Harry's eyes widened, inhaling a startled gasp as his fingers closed tightly on Draco’s shoulders. He pushed a little against Harry's entrance and was rewarded with a loud moan that sounded suspiciously like his name.
"Do you have any
"Or maybe they just skipped," Draco said, wondering himself if he owed Granger a curse.
"That's ok," Ron told her. "We're here to help."
"No," he answered, and Harry recoiled at the bite in his tone. Draco sighed, forcing himself to calm down. Knowing the idiot, he probably didn't have any idea what he’d done. Draco was almost sure Harry didn't have a deceitful bone in his body, but that didn't mean being subjected to an afternoon of his staring at someone else wasn't... painful.
"My father taught me fear is a weakness, Severus," he said eventually. "My father taught me that being anything but pureblood made you inferior."
"Not all the spells are dark though," Harry answered, and Draco's eyes narrowed.
“Ah,” Scrimgeour said. “Not to mention the mental damage I’m told he’s done on Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley and Zabini. I hear they were also attacked by him.”
"You little…" Severus took a step forward and Harry flinched on impulse, his body expecting a hit that his mind consciously knew wasn’t coming. Severus immediately relaxed his aggressive position, sighing and rubbing his face before barking out another order. "Grab my bag," he ordered, sweeping out of the room. Harry ran into Severus's office, scooped up his bag of healing potions, and chased after the Professor.
"Is it true, father?" Draco asked. "Will I be a… a we-were-," he seemed to choke on the word for a moment before giving up entirely and just looking at Lucius. As if Lucius could make it all go away.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked. "If you found Potter fleeing from the meeting you should have brought him to Umbridge immediately." Nott and Parkinson exchanged a look, neither of them looking particularly chagrined.
"Shut up," Blaise snapped at him.
"What's going on?" Draco asked.
The comment just didn't make sense, and even with Harry's fondness for turning a conversation around, and confusing Draco until he got out of giving any answers, there was something about the way he said it, the way he turned his head away, that drew Draco up short.
"I wouldn't!" Draco snapped. "I wouldn't. I wouldn't even know what to do with myself anymore," he said, his silver-grey eyes hard on Harry's face, and Harry really didn't know how to argue. He should; he should have been, but he didn't know
"Nothing, never mind," Draco said, and Harry just sighed, already turning away. Draco knew it was stupid; he knew he should just let Harry walk away, but he couldn't—not with that disappointed expression on his face. Not when he wouldn't see him for a month, and it hurt just thinking about how Harry would be around Ginevra for all that time, and he might just come back not thinking about Draco at all and—
"But-."
"I didn't—" Harry blushed, beginning to backtrack. Then he stopped himself, he hadn't spoken aloud, had he? Come to think of it, how had Draco known he had been thinking of alien planets, as well? "You're reading my thoughts?"
"Harry?" Draco asked, and Harry grabbed his robes, his hands clamping down on the material like he was afraid Draco was going to disappear on him, and Draco didn’t know how to pretend to hate him when he was shaking and upset, and Draco wanted—needed—to do something about it. He was so tired of pretending, of being angry. “What happened?” he asked. He raised a hand to Harry’s face, his thumb brushing along his cheekbone, and Harry shuddered, his eyes widening at the touch, but he didn’t pull away.
"No," Draco answered. "I want to stay."
"Was it nonsense or did we just not understand?" Lucius asked, one eyebrow raised. "And do you also remember how many trips she made to her vault when she first returned? How defensive she got when anyone asked where she'd been?"
“Hogwarts is running as well as it always is,” Severus answered, not bothering to take his eyes off the ring. “There’s really not much more to discuss.”
"I just wanted to apologize," she said, her voice loud and determined, and Draco felt Harry freeze against him in surprise.
"You and I are going to enter my mind." Malfoy told him, leaning over the table and pulling two goblets closer to him. "You're going to look at the defenses around my mind, understand how they work, why they're necessary, and what you would need to do to build your own."
"Do you need me for anything else, Headmistress?"
Beth, who still had her arms tight around Severus, had her mouth wide open, her scream uninterrupted as she pointed one chubby eleven-year-old finger off the side, and Lucius saw the shadow move this time.
"I doubt that," Blaise scowled. "I know that look on you, Draco. Something's wrong; maybe I can help you."
"Yes, he returned about an hour ago."
"What did you need, Lucius?"
"Speaking of homework," Granger said, throwing Draco a knowing smirk before turning innocent brown eyes on Harry and Weasley. "Have you looked at the Defense textbook?" Their eyes widened as they looked back at her.
"I'm not sure that's a good idea," Harry muttered, immediately blushing crimson.
been living under a rock the past year," Draco said, allowing himself one more undignified snort. "I mean, I know
"Are you alright?" he asked.
"I just saved your life," she snapped at him. "Don't ask me why I'm here."
"Ah, Mr. Potter," Umbridge said, her smile widening when she saw him. Harry just stared at her for a long minute before moving to sit in front of Severus' desk, sprawling out to hook his left leg over the arm rest, his face a picture of boredom.
"It can't be true," Draco said. Harry turned to him. Draco's face had gone deathly pale, his breathing unsteady and Harry was beginning to be really concerned about him. "Trelawney is a fraud. Everyone knows that!" Draco stood abruptly, wobbling where he was and shouting at Dumbledore. "It's not true!"
"Your sympathy will be his doom," Severus answered, raising his wand. "Get out of the way
"My room is right across the hall," Harry said, shifting his feet and rubbing the back of his neck uncomfortably.
he cared whether Malfoy talked to him or not. He should have been happy enough just finishing his food and leaving. Except he just wasn't.
"No?"
"Why do you keep
Draco and Harry continue with their date while Lucius talks to Severus.
"I want…" he trailed off as Malfoy's thumb stroked along his head, smearing precum along the shaft.
Draco's wand went flying out of his hand, landing
"And how are you safer here than at Hogwarts?" Draco asked, raising an eyebrow at the increasingly idiotic man in front of him.
"Dumbledore asked me to make a poison for him. Very rare and very expensive. I thought it was strange at the time, but he wasn't forthcoming with information."
“I don’t want to,” Harry answered, and suddenly his hand pressed harder, digging into Draco’s leg until Draco let out a shriek of laughter. He tried to scramble away, but Harry was suddenly
Then again it wasn't much better when he was awake. He couldn't stop himself from remembering the Department of Mysteries and the prophecy that had taken up residence in his mind. The prophecy that had cost him... No, they were never meant to be in the first place. That was the thought he kept in the front of his mind. That they were never meant to be in the first place. He repeated it to himself when he felt the pain start to sprout claws in his chest. They were never meant to be in the first place. There was never anything either of them could have done. And yet, the prophecy still followed him around, promising him that he would never have a normal life.
Draco Malfoy is deaf. His parents had spent countless hours trying to learn sign language so they might understand each other, but in the end magic was used for communication. That's how it's always been, and always will be. He tries not to let it get to him — sign language simply doesn't work for them.
and they would lay off. They liked him thin. He bruised easier, Harry supposed. It was just another thing for them to pick at, to make fun of, to torment him about.
Draco had smiled wide, cheeks and ears red, eyes clouded with so much happiness and affection Harry swears he should -
Harry wasn’t the only one to be making noise, of course. He found himself in a few awkward situations when the blonde brought over
After what Harry likes to call the ‘Lucius Malfoy’ incident, they make up. Malfoy knocks on Harry’s door a few days later and holds out his hand, introducing himself as Draco with a surprisingly shy smile. Harry smiles back. He meets Draco’s cats - Severus, Artemis, and Loki. There are very few incidents where they bother each other, but occasionally if Harry makes a bit too much noise, he’ll hear what sounds like a heavy book hit the closest wall.
Draco curls up into Harry’s lap and Harry falls asleep there, on the couch, with his sarcastic neighbor in his lap. He wakes up the next morning and his back and legs ache - he’s used to aches and pains; it’s not a big deal - but Draco isn’t there. He’d left a note there, saying he had to go run errands. Harry tries not to feel disappointed. Breakfast would’ve been nice, and Harry was a great cook. He promises himself he’ll invite Draco over one morning.
would echo into whatever room was on the other side of the wall. Harry found that decorating (and redecorating) was quite difficult, as Malfoy seemed to appreciate peace and quiet at all times during the day. Eventually, Harry decided he was not making any progress being quiet and made quite a fair bit of noise just to get through what should not have been a time-consuming task in the first place.
Draco turns to face Harry, who now joins him in front of the old castle. Draco looks at the sky, sees it just as clear as it had been twenty-two years before. Sometimes he gets nightmares from his years as a Death Eater. Harry holds him then, shushes him in the darkness of the night. He is the only one Draco has ever heard. Draco looks to the brunette, feels the urge to cry, nods. Harry's arms slide around his waist, and Draco peers into the man's eyes, drags a thumb down the stubble that grows along his cheek.
There was one night where Draco was exhausted after being out all day but insisted on being awake enough to sit with Harry. He’d fallen asleep after a few minutes in front of the fire with his legs stretched out over Harry’s lap. Harry squeezed at his knee, massaging his calf through his jeans. A sigh slipped through the brunette’s lips, knowing how determined the blonde had been to spend time with his neighbor.
It's May 2nd, 2020 when Draco stands in the very place he stood twenty-two years before. He stands where Voldemort had stood in his final moments, where the Dark Lord fell to his knees and Harry Potter became victorious.
Malfoy presses his face into Harry’s neck and then he’s crying, wet eyelashes pressed to the skin on the brunette’s throat, one arm trapped by Harry’s hand on his wrist and the other pressed beside them, fingers curling in Harry’s shirt. They sit like that for a long time. Harry guesses the man needed this, a warm body to turn to for comfort. Malfoy cries into Harry’s skin until he goes completely still, asleep against the man, at peace.
Harry had yelled back an annoyed,
and Harry flushed red before responding with a definite
Harry’s sure if Lucius Malfoy returned and asked him if he knew Draco, he couldn’t bring himself to lie. Draco practically lives in Harry’s house despite being just next door, so when he brings up moving in officially, they don’t hesitate. Draco drops a box while trying not to trip over Severus, and Harry laughs an,
Lord Voldemort had never been considerate. Narcissa Malfoy, who cared more for her son than anyone else, had attempted to teach him the spell — the Dark Lord always seemed to forget Draco could not hear him, and got angry when the boy did not respond to his simple queries. Severus had to remind him each time, forcing himself to keep from flinching when a sickening laugh burst from Voldemort's mouth. He found Draco's disability hilarious. While everyone else cowered in fear, the youngest Malfoy sat perfectly still. The Dark Lord's laugh did not frighten him; all he could hear was silence.
His teachers learned how to cast the simple spell they'd crafted wordlessly. They'd enhanced it enough that it lasted longer, until eventually a simple incantation was enough that Draco could get through the entire lecture without recasting. The spell was simple; it displayed the words they were speaking next to their head for only Draco to see. Navigating without his hearing was difficult, but he managed, as did his friends. He was born deaf after all, silence is all he's ever known. With the Dark Lord returning and his parents once again devoted themselves to him as death eaters, Draco found himself unable to keep up for a short time.
Hermione and Ron visited on a Thursday. Draco was busy, which gave Harry time with his old friends. Hermione asked Harry if there was someone new in his life as if she knew he had a new friend, and Harry had asked her why. There was an extra scarf on his coat rack, another pair of shoes by the door. Harry didn’t realize Draco had left his own mark in his house, but he didn’t do anything about it. There was cat hair everywhere on his bookshelves, over the back of his couch.
He sees his parents walking alongside the Death Eaters as they approach the castle, dust arising in his vision. Hogwarts is in ruins. Tears sting in his eyes and Draco fights them back, desperate in his knowing that the Dark Lord will soon call him forward. Harry is laid there, limp, chest completely still.  Draco is completely and utterly devastated.
There is no noise when he looks around at Hogwarts, there never has been. Students are dismissed every year on the anniversary of the end of the second war. The school is blissfully empty, spare Headmistress McGonagall and a few other teachers. It's strange not seeing Severus Snape roaming about, Draco decides. The man lies in Godric's Hollow now, next to Lily Potter.
Draco Malfoy knows the scar hasn't pained Harry Potter for twenty-two years. All is well.
It's May 2nd, 1998 when Draco Malfoy is set free.
knew damn well what his own address was -
This event did not stop Harry from singing in the shower, but he did continue a bit quieter, only because he’d gotten complaints from his other neighbors that the feud between the two men was affecting them too. Somehow, he’d forgotten Malfoy wasn’t the only one he lived next to.
There are only one or two nights that are particularly memorable from that point on, one specifically being when Draco had someone over again. He’d been gone all night - something Harry had noticed after he’d made quite the ruckus rearranging things in his bedroom. Harry had learned to ignore the sounds of grunts and moans drifting through the walls, so he wasn’t too bothered when he’d heard it begin, just sat down and accepted that he wouldn’t be sleeping anytime soon.
There's a ringing when he joins his parents, clutches his mother's hand. He is the only one standing that knows Harry Potter still lives.
speaking. It seems the blonde had suddenly picked up on Harry Potter radio, the brunette's thoughts transferring right into Draco's skull. Alarmed, Draco walks off, and decides to skip his first class. There's really no reason for it, but he cries.
as Draco called him - was a bit harder to spot as he loved to hide in the gaps between Harry’s books, among the shelves. He’d be covered in dust most times, having ventured into the smallest crevices of Harry’s living room before deciding he’d like to go back home with his rightful owner.
“My parents were ignorant. I had to leave. The things they forced me to do- to say,” Malfoy shudders, suddenly trembling again, chewing on his lips as to stop himself from getting sick or saying anything more. Harry now understands where his sarcasm might come from, having grown up in what seemed to be a very unloving and unaffectionate household. Harry
Lucius beckons for his son; Narcissa is cowered in fear. She whimpers his name, knowing he cannot hear her. She will stand with her son no matter the choice he makes — Draco, too, knows this. Lucius will see him as a blood traitor. Voldemort looks at the blonde with cold, unforgiving eyes, knowing Malfoy saw the words he spoke.
There was one particular event Harry remembers, shortly after the music fiasco, when an older man had appeared on his doorstep. It was easy to tell he was somehow related to the sarcastic man next door and Harry found himself suspicious when he’d introduced himself as, “Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father.” Harry wasn’t quite familiar with his neighbor’s first name, as it seemed irrelevant, but it was familiar
Harry says, mouths the words with it,
“My parents died when I was young,” Malfoy flinches for a moment and Harry winces, “My aunt and uncle took me in, and they weren’t so great either,” The man glances up over his cup, eyebrows drawn together, eyes flicking over Harry’s body before looking away again. They’re not close, far from it. Harry has never told anyone anything about his childhood ever, too afraid of being abandoned and frightened of reliving what he’d dealt with. His childhood brought nightmares every now and then. Sometimes Harry found himself unable to eat - he’d spent so much time going hungry it was almost routine to skip out on meals.
First silence, and then a sweet voice, foriegn and loud in Draco's head and in his broken ears. He stopped, startled, spinning on his heels in an attempt to pinpoint what he thought he'd heard.
“No, I don’t know your son. You seem to have the wrong address.” Lucius nodded, and he was out of the gloomy neighborhood not too soon after, driving off down the street in a fancy - and quite expensive - car. Harry watched him drive away, frowning to himself. He disappeared back into his house, and took it upon himself to shout to his neighbor, “Do you want to explain why
This enraged Voldemort, of course, as everyone feared him. They bowed at his feet with a simple cruel word, they followed his orders, but when he ordered Draco Malfoy to bow — well, the command simply went unheard. Draco was the only man to ever remain standing even after seeing everyone else fall to their knees, and that in itself spoke volumes.
Draco looks up and Harry smiles,
When those short hours end, and Draco is alone again, he walks out and stands in the very place the Dark Lord died. He looks up at the sky — the clear, brilliant sky — and has the sudden feeling he might cry. There's a hand on his shoulder, and then there's Harry Potter.
Harry questions, shifting so he's turned more toward the blonde. Draco thinks he sees Snape look at them a few times briefly, but he's not sure. It's not like he can hear the professor's thoughts — no, that's just Potter.
And it’s completely, utterly true.
He remembers what it was like when Molly saw the bruises for the first time - what it was like when she’d seen just how thin he actually was; she’d begged him to tell her what was happening with the Dursley’s on Privet Drive. Harry had reassured her he was fine, knowing he wasn’t, but not knowing what they were doing was completely wrong. Hadn’t they said he deserved it? He was a freak - different from Dudley and all his friends. Petunia never liked Lily, she never liked James, she never liked Harry.
Harry leans forward and takes the cup of tea from Malfoy’s hands before he spills it, setting it on the table and leaving a soothing hand on the man’s wrist. “You don’t have to explain,” Harry squeezes reassuringly at his wrist, “You don’t owe anyone an explanation,” Malfoy looks lost for a moment, trembling. Harry leans forward on instinct, dragging the man into his arms. Despite the lack of care in his childhood, he’s had plenty of friends to comfort in the past, he knows the drill, knows how to soothe someone. It drains his energy, but he’ll get it back later.
On one specific occasion, Harry yelled for quiet, heard talking through the layers of the wall, and was relieved to hear they’d continued much quieter. Malfoy brought over another partner the next night - Harry heard the name
. Draco despises him. His father does too; Lucius hates his association with 'mudbloods' and 'blood traitors.' Narcissa hasn't said much in reference to the boy, being a mother herself, unwilling to look at any young child with the hatred her husband has.
Harry Potter despised his neighbor. It’s not like Mr. Malfoy (who lives alone with his three cats) had done anything particularly rude. Harry just had a certain dislike for the man. Their first meeting hadn’t gone too well - Harry moved in a few years earlier. The street name was forgettable and the lane itself was a bit lonely, shadowed by rows of houses that lined the grimy sidewalks. Malfoy was a tad sarcastic, and Harry does think he could’ve been nicer himself. Regardless, there had been immediate dislike from both sides.
Harry refuses to admit he hears the man on the other side of his walls getting himself off, and then pretends he simply imagined hearing Draco whimper out a desperate
Harry sees Draco a few short days after that night and he looks as if nothing happened, offering a small smile to the brunette as he leaves for wherever he goes during the day. Harry nods at him, smiling back, and if he stares at Draco’s ass while he walks to his car, nobody has to know. Harry has the day to himself. He reorganizes his room again because he’s bored, not worried about the noise, and then reads the rest of his book.
Harry looks disgusted at the pairing as he slides into the chair next to Draco, green eyes flashing over the blonde's face. Potter opens his mouth and his lips form around words as he says something, oblivious that Draco is deaf, and Draco scrunches his eyebrows in confusion. Almost every student in Hogwarts knew Draco was deaf; it got around during his first year. It's strange that Harry doesn't know. Nothing is said in Harry's thoughts, save a few random comments to himself about Malfoy's silence, and so the blonde has absolutely no clue what the boy just said.
His teachers at school used to worry - Harry would refuse to eat. There were rumors he had an eating disorder. Vernon would talk with the teachers that fussed over how thin he was. He’d say,
Severus Snape is dead. Some of Draco's friends are dead. He's standing with all the other Hogwarts students when Voldemort shouts that Harry Potter has died too. This is the only time he casts Draco's charm — he wants to be sure everyone understands they're doomed. He doesn't hear Professor McGonagall's cries of terror when she sees Hagrid carrying the boy's body in his arms, doesn't hear the agonizing yelling from everyone behind him. Draco feels lonely. He'd gotten along with Potter after their fifth year, being able to communicate with him better than others, and he's sure that he'll never hear anything again.
In the complete silence he faces, Draco looks around at everyone who fought. They're dirty, bloodied by battle, some have their mouths open to yell out toward the apparent victor; there's a crushing echo in his head when he hears:
Draco's face twists up in disgust and then Harry smiles, all shiny white teeth.
It's a simple thing that Draco's picked up on; he always looks forward to potions. Snape paired him with Harry this time around, however, obviously hoping the Malfoy would do something to sabotage Potter's potion. Draco flinches when the sound of Harry's internal groan echoes loud in his head, straightening himself immediately in hopes he'll intimidate the brunette — Harry isn't intimidated easily. Draco slumps back down.
A few more sentences echoed in Draco's head and then he realized Potter
“It’s weird,” Draco frowns and Harry tugs at his arms, pulling him into a hug, a sigh punching from the blonde’s chest. There’s a long moment of silence where Draco simply breathes into Harry’s neck and then, “Sing to me?” and Harry laughs, quiet and genuine. He presses closer, resisting the sudden urge to pull his neighbor into his lap.
dad just knocked on
before he threw one of his aunt’s old ugly vases at the wall and then left the house for the night. He had one hell of a mess to clean up when he returned and decided the destruction wasn’t worth it when he saw Malfoy’s proud smirk the next morning.
before there’s nothing but quiet because refusing to believe the truth is much better than facing it.
Draco shrugs, taps his fingers absentmindedly on a crack in the table. How long had it been there? It feels strange under his touch. Draco wonders how Potter managed to figure it out so fast, being seemingly dim-witted.
It's a beautiful day.
Petunia had packed a few of her things, having no idea Harry would have one of the worst panic attacks of his life later when he unwrapped them, and the brunette somehow couldn’t bring himself to get rid of them while decluttering and decorating. Maybe it was her connection to his mother that kept him from being so angry. Despite the years he was forced to spend under the stairs, he hoped his aunt could somehow be as nice as his mom had apparently been.
"You look well," She had said to him, her words floating alongside her head for Draco to read. An embarrassed flush had spread over his face as he peered into Narcissa's eyes, muttering his thanks. "I have no doubt you'll treat Draco kindly. You are a good man, Harry Potter." Draco was glad to know she approved, although he knew she'd support him even if she didn't — the Malfoys had lived under authority of a Dark Lord for years; the last thing she'd want is for her son to feel just as trapped as they once had been.
Draco shakes his head, a frown tugging at his lips. Harry's head tilts back and his mouth opens. Although Draco can't hear it, he knows — Harry's laughing. Draco wants to feel disgusted, but he doesn't, his lips twitching as he fights a smile. A very small part of Draco wishes he could hear just so he might have the chance to listen to the boy laugh, just once. He buries that thought.
Draco nods, looks down at where he stands. His mother might live to see the day she's released from Azkaban. His father will not. Lucius Malfoy will die in prison, Draco knows, and he's not sure if he's glad.
Draco’s cats found their way into Harry’s house every now and then. He only saw timid Loki once, but Artemis and Severus shared a similar trait of being curious. Draco was a bit awkward the first time he’d come to get Artemis from Harry, flashing a shy smile before heading out the door, tabby cat in his arms. Severus -
Draco sat on the floor at Harry’s feet as he sorted through all of his books. He sat on the counter once or twice a week as Harry made lunch. He’d sit with Harry on the couch at night. Harry started lighting a fire in the fireplace every night just in case Draco came over. He’d sing to the man, and Draco would get tired before he’d say goodnight and go back over to his own place. It was nice having someone else around the house.
After a few glasses, Draco had laughed nervously and then leaned forward to kiss Harry, tasting like alcohol and something sweeter. Harry kissed him back, just a tad bit less drunk, placing a hand on the back of Draco’s neck and squeezing gently. They slept on the couch together, Draco laid on top of Harry with his face buried into the brunette’s throat.
"I can't hear you. I'm deaf, Potter," Draco says — speaking charms are always helpful here, heavily practiced ones that allow him to speak aloud clearly and without difficulty. Without them, Draco has no idea how he would get his own thoughts across. Sometimes he finds it difficult, and so he'll shorten sentences. Harry gapes at him, his mind radio silent, and they stare at each other for a few minutes. A few stray thoughts pass through Harry's head as the boy takes in this information.
Draco knew who it was immediately. He'd talked to everyone else in the hall, or had seen them talking. Potter, however, he had not. It wasn't that Draco could
“I didn’t have time for a warning, I,” Malfoy huffs out a breath, “I don’t have many good memories with my father. When he said he was on his way, I didn’t know what to do,” Harry makes his way back to Malfoy, taking in the new information and placing the cup of tea into the other man’s hands. There’s a long moment of silence where Harry really begins to take in his neighbor’s appearance, how young he looks despite being about Harry’s age.
Things didn’t change much after the kiss. Harry didn’t even realize it was like they’d been dating already. Draco shyly kissed Harry sometimes, relaxing once Harry returned it, and that was the only addition to their relationship. It was solid, so easy that it didn’t even seem to be happening in the first place. The dislike they’d had didn’t seem real. It seemed like they’d been together from the start, although they hadn’t.
to sound like
“All you had to do was ask,” Harry rests a hand on the back of Draco’s neck and squeezes there gently, “I’m sorry if it’s terrible,” Draco breathes a laugh into Harry’s throat, lips brushing his nape. Harry ignores it. His singing is off-key and terrible, but he sings anyways, and somewhere along the way, Draco falls asleep. Harry doesn’t remember ever having someone that depended on him, even a little bit. Hermione and Ron were dependant on each other and on their other friends. Hermione had her parents and Ron had all his siblings, too. Molly was like another mother for a long time, Harry supposes, but it wasn’t enough.
Draco knew who Harry potter was — everyone did. His parents were killed in cold blood by Lord Voldemort, his friends were both loyal and, in Hermione Granger's case, smart. He was the only one ever known to survive the
before the brunette sighs and drops any hope of making sure his neighbor is okay. The arguing could probably be heard a few houses down and had Harry a bit shaken, but he mumbles a

to ask about the name) - had snuck in through some open window or crevice in Harry’s house and had knocked over a can of paint. It took ages for the brunette to scrub his floors of the dark red paint, and, if you look close enough, there’s still a stain in the dark wood by the front door.
Harry was well into a book when there was a botched moan of a name and then yelling. He was surprised he didn’t hear the entire argument but nearly knocked his cup of tea off the table next to him when there was a very loud declaration of,
They only tormented each other more from that point on. There were things Harry did that
to his neighbor (doubting he could hear it) and climbs into bed.
Severus Snape was the one professor who never forgot to cast Draco's spell. The others slipped up sometimes, never having dealt with a deaf student like Malfoy apparently, but never Snape. In fact, if it weren't for the old Potion's Professor, Draco would've been in deep trouble with the Dark Lord. Ruthless as he may be, Snape tries — he'd catch up with Draco after meetings and although he brushes off the 'absurd conclusion' that he cares, he'll make sure Draco knew everything Voldemort went over.
“What?” Harry gives him a calculating look then smiles to make himself seem a little bit less intimidating.
Harry projects a thought,
The two constants were the silence and, as strange as it sounds, Harry Potter. Draco had never heard someone speak before, had never even heard himself think before, but as he brushed down the halls at Hogwarts, there was suddenly
Draco's lips part and he nods, allows himself to be embraced. Together they stand in the very spot Lord Voldemort perished, and Harry kisses Draco, cradles his cheeks and brushes his thumbs over his jawline.
Draco was curled up into Harry’s side when he’d asked,
There is a split second when Draco glances around, questioning the command, and then Harry tumbles out of Hagrid's arms.
"Charm." Harry nods. They finish class like that; Draco forgets to ruin Potter's potion.
"I've never heard anyone speak before. It scares me. Loud." Draco shrugs and Harry smiles again, amused at the situation. When he projects a thought again, it's softer, tolerable.
Malfoy was rightfully pissed off after this incident. There was a package delivered to the man’s doorstep a few days later, and Harry worked on practicing breathing exercises when Malfoy blasted music into the late hours of the night. The brunette could admit he’d barked out a laugh when a familiar song blasted through the speakers, completely sure his mother would’ve sung along to what was her favorite song if she were here with him.
Harry doesn’t have the keys to Malfoy’s house, and so he lays the man on his couch and goes upstairs to sleep. When he finds himself treading back downstairs, Malfoy’s gone.
There was a knock on said door a few moments later, and Harry allowed an aloof Malfoy slip past him, obviously shaken. There’s a moment of silence, and then the man opens his mouth, “I’m sorry,” He frowns, seemingly not happy with those words, “He kept bothering me over a visit and I figured, well- hoped, really, you’d send him away,” Harry’s eyebrows come together in a display of his confusion, drawing his attention to the way the Malfoy’s shaking, hands trembling despite the way he buries them into the sweater he’s wearing.
A certain few incidents had only caused more problems between them. For one, the other man’s cat - the black one, named Severus (Harry decided after a few moments of thought
"Potter" Harry slowly turned his head from the book he was looking at.
“I love you just remember that” Harry said loosening his head from Dracos embrace. “I love you too scarhead” Draco giggled. Draco pulled Harry in for a kiss a sweet and passionate one then disconnecting and returning to Harrys lips with a kiss that felt like it could be their last.
"Don't do that again, he doesn't need to know or see what that is at his age Lucius" Narcissa had said as she sat down to have her nightly cup of tea after putting Draco to bed. "He will have to at some point" "THATS NOT NOW" Narcissa had raised her voice at him "he's still a child let him have that, the dark lord isn't even alive Draco doesn't have to know about him now, please just let him have his childhood" Narcissa had pleaded.
Silence
They stayed wrapped in each other’s arms for a while. Draco who was slowly falling asleep suddenly opened his eyes startling Harry a bit “you ok?” Harry asked wide eyed. “Yeah but i forgot to say there should be a healer here in the next hour or so, I didn’t want you to be startled if someone turned up while I was asleep” Draco said sleepily while rubbing his hands over his face. “Why?” Draco a little bit shocked rapidly turned his head to Harry and lifted himself up.
1st year:
‘SON of a death eater, DRACO MALFOY switched sides during the battle sources claim racing to help ‘enemy’ HARRY POTTER then killing DANGEROUS dark lord supporter Fenrir Greyback.’
As Harry was nuzzling into the hand Draco ever so lightly brought his lips up to Harry's, lightly kissing them. There seemed to be a tiny spark between their lips as Draco pulled his off Harry's.
"DRACO COME INSIDE NOW PLEASE, I need to get you cleaned up before dinner” His mother had shouted out the door holding her hand out to the little boy who started to run over.
When Draco was 5 it was the first time he noticed the black smudge across his dads arm as he played around with him in the garden. It was all faded and reminded Draco of the balloons he had at his last birthday as it started off skinny at the bottom then got bigger at the top. It had been a hot summers day and wearing a long sleeve shirt while playing around with a small child wasn't the best combination, so Lucius had rolled his sleeves up reviling the the dark mark.
One day when Draco was studying in the library the first few weeks back into the school year one evening Harry Potter with has bag and robe draping off him sat to the left of Draco "don't start anything Malfoy, I couldn't find anywhere else to sit"
When umbridge had scared Harry's hand with ‘i must not tell lies’ Draco was the 3rd person to know after Ron and Hermione, they had met up in the astronomy tower a place umbridge hadn't really thought about controlling yet. Draco had held Harry's hand ever so delicately as he stroked it with his thumb and let Harry talk and ramble on as he listened to every word. As Harry started to stop his rambling Draco moved his other hand to cup Harry cheek gently stroking it, Harry leaned into the touch.
“obliviate”
“God i love you” Harry sorta whispered. Draco stopped for a second “I love you too” Draco said bringing harry closer. They hadn’t got to the i love you stage yet but it felt great to say out loud.
Draco had started to point at something, thinking it was behind him Lucius looked back not seeing anything when he turned back Draco was staring worriedly and curiously at his sleeve.
Harry and Draco after the battle has been won, it’s not all over yet though
“I love you too” Harry shouted as they shared one more glance before Draco opened the door and left.
“Ok so I’m going to sort the dorms and you sort the common room” Draco demanded. “Yes sir” Harry saluted and got his wand out to start casting spells, making Draco laugh as he walked out.
“Strange thing” Draco said turning back and hobbling back to sit on the bed. He opened up the prophet to see Harry’s face on the front with the title of something he couldn’t remember as Draco went straight to the pages about what happened. It took him a while to read all of it feeling an aray of emotions, then his eyes looked at a small section that had written about the death eaters, it had named ever single one and written at the bottom all had been ‘SENT TO AZKABAN TILL TRIALS COMMENCE’then to his surprise it had him in it.
Draco let Harry hug his friends goodbye and they apparated away to 12 Grimmauld Place, this would be their safe haven for now.
“Why am i here?” Draco asked. “I just wanted to see if you were doing ok after last year” Dumbledore said “good as i can, is there anything else?” Draco said bluntly.
2nd year:
A few minutes later an owl came in with a letter dropping it to Draco it was from his mother, she told him his father and ever other death eater had been taken and for what she knew put in Azkaban, she was spared as Harry had told the ministry she had saved him and that she was at the manor when he wanted to come back also that she was clearing out the manor. He remembered a conversation they had when it was taken over by Voldemort about how he wanted it back to when he was young when it was pretty and lovely that what she was doing.
He walked up beside Harry and slipped the letter in his robes and kissed him on the ear getting his attention just as he was nearing the potion room. Harry gave him a smile as Draco continued his way to the common room smiling back then turning his back to Harry continuing to walk till he heard the door to the potions room shut.
When Harry, Ron and Hermione turned up he couldn’t identify Harry how could he do that to the man he loves, the only man that could win this war.
“Why? Because I don’t need you collapsing on me after I just got you back, you were hiding out for months I’m assuming not in an actual house. Y...you also died, that’s twice now I just want to make sure you are ok love” Draco reaching out to touch Harry’s face stroking his cheek. “Ok, but I want you to get seen to make sure your leg and arm are ok” Harry stated reaching his hand to stroke Draco’s cheek.
The next time he saw Harry was going into the hall for lunch the next day, Harry clearly saw him there wasn’t a smile like normal, Harry seemed fine just normal well as normal as he could be, even though it was Dracos choice it broke him, he had no one to look after him now, no one to care, but Harry was safer in a way now.
A month or so later Snape came up to Draco at the end of potions class “I know you said to oblivioate Potter but were you serious Draco?” Snape asked. “yes i was, has he been thinking about me?” Draco asked curiously. “You pop up in ever session I have with him, i wanted to ask you before i did it, I’m sorry Draco but we can’t risk it” Snape said getting up “I understand” Draco said bitterly picking his books up to leave the class.
He ran out and hid behind some rubble as Harry finished off Voldemort, he won he did it, he knew he would.
“Wha-“
Silence
Being trapped in the room of requirements made Draco sick knowing he let in death eaters last year that basically killed Dumbledore. When Harry questioned him he wanted to tell him how much he loved him and how he could never do that but he couldn’t.
“I hope they are happy tears” Harry said walking into the hall. Draco ran up to him “thank you” “she saved my life what else could i do”
“What did you do to him?” Draco asked looking in the direction of Snape. “Both of you follow me” Draco helped Harry get up and let him lean on him as they walked.
“I’m...I’m sorry” Draco whispered, “Hey don’t say that, we’re all allowed to cry Dray” Harry kissed Draco’s forehead. “I’m guessing it’s over what happened yesterday? If so remember when you are ready, yeah?” “Yeah”Draco said coming out of his little hide away in Harry’s arms “I’m hungry” this caused a little chuckle from Harry.
For the third time in his life Draco cried into his pillow.
During the year Draco knew he couldn’t get away from Harry with all the suspicious stuff he was doing Harry wasn’t stupid or blind, it hurt Draco because he kinda thought somehow that when Harry sorted the weird connection with Voldemort that he would remember but that’s not how it worked.
“Before I go this maybe controversial in the wizarding world but I would suggest looking  up the doctors that deal with mental health in the Muggle world as having to be around he who must not be named and having to hold our world on his shoulders for years on end couldn’t of done a lot of good for how you feel” the healer said aiming it at both Draco and Harry. “Thank you” Harry said going to shake his hand, Krecher popping back in the room with a “I’ll show you out”
Narcissa was scared Draco was more like his father and that seemed to be true when she heard that Draco had insulted Ron Weasley trying to impress Harry, she was scared.
“Lets get to work then” Draco said getting his wand out casting a spell to fix the bridge Harry following suit.
Harry and Draco looked at each other with pain in their eyes, Draco held his hand out for Harry to take and he did with Draco pulling him in for a hug. Draco started crying and whimpering in Harrys ear, Harrys heart broke he pulled Draco in closer putting his hand in Draco’s hair trying to soothe him.
The next thing he knew was fire and not dying was on his mind, he had done to much to die in this way but Harry being the good man he was got him and Blaise out with Rons help.
“I didn’t want this, I didn’t want to die though, he..he knew about Harry, said he saw me in Harrys memory it was when i said i love you to him. He used the Cruciatus curse on me i told him I obliviated him, he seemed to believe me said he saw that too in a memory, said it was a stupid thing to do, could of used me to bring Harry to him and he forced the mark on me and gave me these things to do, I’m sorry”
“Draco Dray hey” Harry said softly as he rubbed his back. “I’m sorry Mr Malfoy if I have brought stuff up it’s just rare to see this many marks” the healer said, Draco brought his head up “marks? How can you see marks?” Draco asked confused he didn’t think the cruciatus curse left any marks on his body. “You or Harry here can’t see them, but when a healer has to make sure there isn’t anything internally going on they can also sometimes on rare occasions see where spells have been used on a person, your marks are situated on your torso and head, which is why it’s odd to see you in good working order”the healer explained.
During the next hour Harry and Draco made their way down stairs, Draco surprisingly to Harry started cooking for them. “Who taught you how to cook?” Harry asked as he dug into the pancakes Draco placed in front of him. “Mum mainly but when the servants would cook I used to help on the odd occasion, refine the skills mother had taught me” Draco beamed as started to make his own. “Are they ok?” Draco asked curiously after he didn’t hear Harry say anything. “Bloody wonderful Dray, you’re really good at this cooking stuff, the perfect wife” Harry teased “Heyyyyy” Draco whined sitting down in front of Harry, Harry started to stuff his face.
As Draco went to pour more batter in the pan a knock was heard, then small stomping feet past as kreacher went to get it. A few moments later kreacher walked into the kitchen with an middle age looking man. “Master the healer” then kreacher went back out the room.
Enjoy
“DRACO” he turned round it was Harry, he gave him a small smile and covered the bodies up. Harry was walking over “what are you doing?” Harry asked “no one here should be forced to collect their bodies a death eater should and as I’m the only one might as well” Draco said walking up to another body Harry following him “don’t you hurt?” Harry asked “I’m fine” Draco answered sorting out the body.
Everything started to calm down and people congregated in the hall. Draco had pain running through his arm and leg some blood coming out he went to get help Madam pomfrey rushed up to him gave him something to help him breath and got someone to bandage him up. He got rid of his blazer and tie moving himself to a little corner if the hall, he didn’t want to be seen.
Probably a few mistakes, sorry in advance.
"W...what it" Draco mumbled. "This is what the mud bloods call a tattoo my dear" luscious said letting Draco get a closer look.
When they started back he knew it was Harry hiding in the slytherin part of the train. He kinda knew why, he knew Harry saw him go into borgin and burkes. He didn’t know what to do so he waited for everyone to go, shut the blinds and forced Harry down.
Draco was zoning out, just starting at the door to the room when his leg and arm decided to be in considerable pain. Deciding he didn’t want to wake Harry, Draco hobbled to the door knocking a few things on his way turning back every time to make sure Harry didn’t wake up.
“The cruciatus curse....there are multiple” the healer said Draco hung his head down he didn’t want this now.
7th year:
“And if we don’t” Harry interjected. “Draco could be killed or worse tortured before he kills him or use him against you” Snape said dryly stepping forward.
In a mere few seconds they were standing in the middle of the courtyard in Hogwarts, looking like it was before the battle, no dead and rubble all clear. “You could have apparated us closer to the bridge” Draco whined. “Is your leg ok?” Harry asked with concern. “I was joking babe, my legs been ok today” Draco intertwined his arm with Harry’s as they walked the corridors.
As Draco woke the next morning he felt dead, was he dead, he could be dead that though left as he rubbed his eyes and turned over to see Harry all safely wrapped up in blankets obviously Dracos handy work, he didn’t want him to wake up cold, he deserved a good night sleep after everything.
Draco decided to leave the great hall he had some people look at him smiled they saw how he had fought after.
After lunch
He cried.
He shot multiple spells out killing death eaters he didn’t feel remorse the ones that didn’t flee were the worst of their kind actually believing in Voldemort.
“Mr Malfoy I would suggest you go to St Mungo's at some point just for a check up” the healer said then turning back around walking out.
Draco went to greyback body first and shot multiple spells at him making sure he was truly dead a few people came to see what he was doing. He disfigured his face he didn’t deserve to be known, he was the bottom of the pile as he collected multiple bodies of death eaters putting them in a neat pile, when someone has to take them away then he should make it easier for them.
While the place didn’t pay him hourly, he learned how to bat his eyelashes when it was appropriate to get whatever tips he needed for the night.
When Harry’s parents died, he was placed with aunt and uncle, who he had lived with his whole life until he turned seventeen. The moment he was of age, he moved out with the money he had saved up from working as a server at a local restaurant.
When they walked in, Harry looked up to see a man sitting at the desk and froze in mid step. The man was wearing an oversized cardigan that was patched and frayed  and had some scratches across his face. Harry was sure he had never met the man in his life, but a wave of deja vu crept over him. He could have sworn he had seen this man somewhere. The man looked up and looked over all of the students before his eyes fell on Harry.
Harry woke up feeling weird about his dream. He couldn’t even remember who or what the person looked like that he was talking to in his dream. But for some reason the conversation made him feel… happy? Giddy? He couldn’t really tell but he liked that feeling.
“Like Matt said, he obviously doesn’t want to disclose,” River said. When everyone looked back at their books, River turned to Harry and winked. Harry quickly looked down, not wanting to think too much into what that meant.
Harry cleared his throat, “Anyways, we should probably head to class. We don’t want to be late.” They all started packing their bags and headed to class.
The dream is nothing different than he has had since he was a young child. He used to think the flash of green happened when he and his parents were in a car crash when he was a one year old. But then, he could never explain the flying motorbike. Maybe he just thought it was gonna fly him away from his disaster of a life.
Harry could have been imagining it, but he thought the man’s eyes lingered on Harry longer than the other students. Harry came back to his senses and finally went to find a seat, ignoring his friends looking at him curiously.
“Soooo, Harry?” prodded his friend Claire. He internally rolled his eyes. The girls in his group were always asking him questions about him because he was so unwilling to tell people about himself.
He was just getting finished when he heard a loud bang. He looked up as his heart started beating quickly and reached to his forearm to- to do what he didn’t know. He then realizes someone had just dropped a large textbook and berated himself for freaking out over nothing.
After class Harry rushes out quickly, wondering why he was even feeling like this. Seeing Professor Lupin made him uneasy. He couldn’t understand why, but he felt like there was something he was missing.
“Oh, well I think it’s, um, well, Ren feels this intense longing throughout the books. He’s an orphan that has just been taken on this journey without his consent and all he wants is a family. And Benjamin is right there, but neither will let themselves accept each other. And that’s the saddest part about reading it because you as a reader understands that, but they don’t.”
Lupin was looking at him expectantly and it took Harry a few seconds for the question to catch up to him.
“So, what?” He questioned, raising his eyebrows and looking at her, trying not to smile.
Harry arrived at his first class right on time. Contrary to what everyone in his neighborhood was told, he actually liked school. The only reason he slacked in primary was because he would get punished if he did any better than Dudley. By secondary, he decided he didn’t care what happened to him. He knew if he didn’t have something going for him he would end up either miserable or dead by age twenty.
Harry wakes up as his alarm clock goes off. He rolls his eyes as he leans over to turn it off. He walks to his kitchen to make breakfast before he has to rush to campus. Harry reflects on his dream as he spreads butter on his toast.
Trying to calm his roaring heartbeat, he quickly packs his stuff up and leaves the library on his way to the coffee shop.  He typically would drink a cup of coffee before he starts, but believes it would only make his panic even worse.
He doesn’t even know why he would react like that. Yeah the Dursleys may have pushed him around a bit, but why did he reach for his arm like a reflex? Choosing to ignore it, he pushed through his shift and went home for the evening.
When he arrived at his last class of the day, his professor announced she was going on maternity leave starting the next class period and they would have a new professor the next week.
Draco stopped breathing and then let a breath out “im sorry” he walked away.
Over the next few weeks harry and Draco had met up in multiple places the library, abandoned class rooms and going down to the lake on the odd day. They talked for hours about anything and everything, the good things and the bad. Harry told Draco about the Dursley's and Draco in turn told him about how his father had taught him all the wrong things growing up.
As they were finishing “Harry...Draco” they turned round in unison “McGonagall” Harry turned to face her still casting the repairing spell.
“You two in here now” snape called out opening the door.
Draco went back upstairs, that nearly being an impossible task with how his leg didn’t want to cooperate with him. He sat down at the desk where the house elf had put the stationary he asked for, gulped down some of his water and started to write a letter to his mother reassuring her about where he was and that he was ok and when he would be back soon. Sighing as he finished he looked at how peaceful Harry looked still sleeping, looking at him you wouldn’t think he just killed one of the most powerful wizards to ever exist.
“Draco” Draco looked up and was faced with Ginny “i wanted to say thank you if it wasn’t for you i think greyback would have killed me” “its ok i just did what anyone else would” he smiled at her. “Im sorry for Fred” “oh yeah , he’s not dead though he started to breath again like it was magic” “thats good, you should be with your family though” “oh yeah, i hope you feel better” Ginny said then walking away.
He ran out his mums arms “POTTER” he shouted throwing his wand to him, Harry smiled. Draco ran for it to the castle he hoped his mum would leave he would defend the right side now.
They ended up in Dumbledore office. Harry passed him a piece if paper it was the note he wrote him “i opened it while me Hermione and Ron were hiding I didn’t understand at first but Dumbledore kept memories for me to look at when it was over” Harry walked over to the Pensieve.
Harry placed his hand on dracos cheek ever so carefully like Draco did to him a few seconds prior. “I don’t hate you before you say it” Draco looked like a fish with how far his mouth gaped open.
Draco didn’t know why but he walked to the potions room door to know if he could hear anything he didn’t for a few seconds till Snape “Im sorry Potter but this has to be done” Dracos breath quickened and he grabbed the handle of the door
Life Harrys how? Feeling 2 wands in his pocket Harrys and his he grabbed it thinking it was the elder wand when he was saving him from the fire yes he knew it was shitty thing to do in the situation but it was useful now.
For the next few years he did listening to his wife's plea.
Turning round all the corridors Draco couldn’t even recall where they were in the moment feeling a bit distorted but focusing on Harry using his robe to wipe Harrys face “do you want some water?” “Please” “accio water” Draco left his hand out till he felt a small cup in his hand then passing it to Harry to drink but holding it for him as he drank.
He saw a spell going for ginny Weasley he shot the strongest spell he knew it killing greyback he already looked injured he wasn’t surprised it killed him. Ginny kept still so he grabbed her and dragged her back to the great hall making sure she got back to her mum who was looking after Fred and lupin.
6th year:
“We dated, can you let me see us Draco, i felt something missing for ages and it was you, please” “sure” Harry used the elder wand to extract memories from Draco and Harry dipped his face in.
The next day Draco woke first, rubbed his eyes  and turned round facing Harry’s peaceful sleeping face. He knew he should probably talk to Harry about what happened but it was something he hadn’t been able to get through yet himself, when it happened it felt like years, like slow motion but as soon as it ended everything wound up like an vhs tape and it’s only just stopped and started playing at normal speed. As soon as the curse was lifted he was given the mark, his task, going back to Hogwarts, seeing Harry, sorting out the cabinet, trying to kill Dumbledore and then the war began. The fatigue from being under the curse wore off but the mental stuff it had left behind had been pushed to the back of his head and left, starting to grow, fester as it was unattended.
“You can’t do anything about it can you?” Harry asked “not really the person themselves has to just make sure they look after themselves after it has happened, Mr Malfoy has seemed to have done that fine on his own, obviously in cases it can never really be reversed, you are very lucky Mr Malfoy” Harry and Draco both knew who the healer was on about.
Draco realised during the summer after 4th year he didn't want this life of being a death eater, Voldemort had been using his home as a sort of hideout and the things he heard and saw were terrible beyond compare. Lucius had told Draco that he expects him to get the dark mark when the time comes, that night Draco cried into his pillow, he wished he didn’t listen to his father.
The next time Draco saw Harry was that night at dinner he smiled at him like they had been for the last month, that small thing kept Draco going in a way. Should i talk to him one last time? Draco debated at the beginning of dinner barely any students had arrived yet.
“What is it Dray?” Harry asked propping himself up wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. He showed Harry the little section “I just didn’t expect to be written” Draco said showing Harry the prophet letting him take it.
Maybe for now
When they were fighting for the wands he swore he saw that smile they gave each other during that month of not being together, god he was going mad.
“I should probably go find Ron and Hermione, get rid of this thing” Harry said getting the elder wand out. “I should probably go and finish off what i was doing” Draco said.
" I don't know what to do Draco I'm sorry" Draco looked a bit disheartened "just don't die then, what ever he throws at you" Draco whispered falling into a bit of a weird silence.
“Yes” Harry said boldly. “So all the times you were a prat was to keep you both safe” Hagrid aimed at Draco. “Uh yes”. “Hermione did find it weird that you laid off her and Ron in 5th year makes sense now ” Hagrid said.
Harry didn’t know how long they were like this, he didn’t care Draco was more important than anything right now. Draco had started to calm a bit so Harry started to sooth him by patting his hair down, something he remembered Draco liked.
Obvious when 5th year started Draco had to give his insults to Harry "I'm surprised the ministry is letting you walk around free this year potter, better enjoy it while you can i guess there is a cell in Azkaban with your name on it" he didn't mean it but he had to keep up appearances, with 2 death eaters sons who were also slytherin by your side it would be hard for Draco to trust anyone.
“I only just property got you and now i have to let go” Harry said holding Draco’s hand finding it hard to look at him. “Just make sure you win this war coming, forget about me” Draco said giving a weak smile and chuckle.
“Mr Malfoy” McGonagall said coming up to them “y...yes” Draco stuttered out “ don’t be scared, well done today you were brave today, I shouldn’t really say this but well done on getting greyback” “Thanks” Draco said “if you need anyone to help rebuild I’m happy to help” “thats ok us teachers are going to do a once over for anyone and do vital repairs right now, go home get rest and you Harry well done your parents would be proud of you and everyone else for that matter, we all owe you now” she said giving Harry a hug and went back to a group of teachers.
The 4th time he cried into his pillow.
"I know we hate each other but are you ok Draco"
“I looked up to you so much, the only thing you did was survive” “how did Your father not find out?” Harry questioned. “Simple i kept it from him, i talked to mother about you and how brave you must be and when mum wasn’t there i would talk to dobby thats how he knew so much about you” Draco confessed bringing his book to his face to cover his face from Harry, “sweet and creepy at the same time” Harry said as he chuckled a little Draco joining in a second later.
“Im sorry” Draco said suddenly “why love” Harry asked. Draco pulled up his sleeve “this” “you don’t have to worry about that ever i know why you had to, Don’t worry about anything now” Harry said.
“Ahh Draco” Dumbledore shouted coming out of the room behind his desk Draco got up walking up to Dumbledores desk standing there shuffling his feet about.
“How are you alive?” The healer bluntly said. “WHAT, why would I not be” Draco shouted a ton of worry settling it’s self on his shoulders. “What do you mean” Harry said putting his arm around Draco.
“Are you feeling any better now?” Draco asked letting Harry stand for himself “yes thank you” Harry sighed then brought his lips to Draco’s for a quick peck “At least I know you are a great nurse when i need it” Harry smirked “I’m shocked potter all you want me for is my skill and not my body” Draco now playing the dramatics, putting a smile on Harrys face.
“How are you both doing?” McGonagall asked as the 3 walked together to the great hall. “Well we saw a healer physically going to be ok” Harry looked at Draco “in other ways I think that might take time” Harry explained. “Understandable with the things you have both been through on the other hand it’s nice to see you both back together” she said smiling at the both.
