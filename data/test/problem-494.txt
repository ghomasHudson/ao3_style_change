‘Ahem. Yes.’ Mr Potter coughed, as if to cover something up. ‘As I mentioned before, I am under strict instructions to rule out possibility of both mental and physical abuse. For this, I need to check you for any signs of bruises and other afflictions. So if you would please undress?’
‘The Order?’ Draco echoed, he’d never hear Harry say anything about that at all. Harry rarely ever spoke about his childhood, although it had been strange how familiarly he had greeted Mrs Longbottom.
Harry pushed himself up, bringing Draco along with him. His hair was all messed up, and Draco brought up a hand to correct it, flattening Harry’s unruly hair with a smile on his face. In the meantime, Harry waved his hand again, dispelling the containment spell. “You can come in.”
‘I didn’t want him to touch me,’ Draco felt his cheeks flush and looked the other way, mumbling as he finished his sentence, ‘so I told him not to… you know…’
‘Thank you, Hermione,’ Draco said for what had to be at least the fourth time. ‘This has given me a lot to think about.’ He quickly glanced over at Harry, who immediately smiled a hopeful yet cautious smile.
‘I’ll leave immediately then, I told Hermione why I would be in late but I really don’t want to be any later than I have to be,’ Harry said in a rushed matter and he stepped towards the floo again. ‘Bye, Draco.’
‘You’re being so good, aren’t you? Just for me,’ his Alpha’s voice cut off Draco’s train of thought and he moaned again, ‘yes, yes, yes, just for you…’
And that was how Draco had ended up on Ginny’s twenty-first birthday party, sitting grumpily in the kitchen with Adelaide.
The fireplace roared, indicating Harry’s return and Draco threw an absentminded hello in his direction.
‘Miss Fawley?’ he asked and a hand carefully caressed his cheek. ‘Yes, it’s me, Draco. I just need to know the name of the man that visited you. Do you remember his name?’
He’d done some research on what type of books he’d need back at Grimmauld Place, hoping that it would safe him time just in case he couldn’t get rid of Harry for a longer period of time. He chose some books that sounded promising, fairly quickly.
‘I – okay.’ Harry sounded just as dumbfounded as Draco felt. ‘But as your Alpha I sometimes need to do those things. It’s my job to protect you.’
Hands gently caressed his face and swiped the hair out of his face. ‘Good boy, Draco, you did so good, so good…’ He moaned and tried to lean into the touch more. ‘Just go back to sleep, okay?’
“Wine, Adelaide?” Draco could hear Harry offering Adelaide, but he didn’t look up from little Alexander. He didn’t know what it was, but the child managed to monopolise his attention every time.
Draco leaned further over Harry, nearly cuddling him as he lazily moved his hips. “God, that’s so good,’ Harry breathed and Draco made a soft noise of agreement. He very keenly realised that this might be one of the last times they’d be having soft, fun, casual sex before the heat rage would overtake him, and continue to overtake him until he got pregnant.
“Okay.” Harry set everything up and then sat back down next to him. He seemed unsure of what to do, so Draco moved a bit closer and quietly cuddled up to his Alpha. Harry sighed and wrapped his arm around him. “I love you,” he murmured, barely audible and it took Draco a few minutes to respond, equally quiet, “I love you too, Harry.”
Draco thought, until a woman with brown, curly hair opened the door, looking dishevelled. ‘Oh, Harry, you’re home already! Well in that case I wanted to ask you about this new case we’ve been assigned and – ’
Draco turned to see the principle of Myrion, Pansy Parkinson, standing just a few feet away from them. It was the polite distance to keep when approaching Omegas who were accompanied by an Alpha.
Unsure of how to break the silence, Draco sat back, leaning into the couch pillows with a sigh. He wished he’d been able to join Harry, but understood that it had been impossible.
Adelaide laughed and patted her own ever-growing belly. ‘That makes two of us. And I’m fairly sure I’m fatter than you are.’
“Thanks, again.” Lupin laid his hands in his lap, stopping the motion almost as soon as Draco had noticed it. “I should go find Tonks.”
“That’s good,” Healer Roberts nodded. “If you haven’t been already, you might want to start doing some light exercise from now on - taking walks, yoga, that sort of thing.”
He sighed. Being alone wasn’t really something he was great at. A glance at the clock told him he had only two more hours to go before it was an appropriate time to drop by at the Burrow. He sighed again and walked into the kitchen. The chore list for today lay on the kitchen table and he picked it up, studying it as if he didn’t do these every day.
For a while, cuddling with little Alexander had cheered him up, but then the little one had fallen asleep and Adelaide had laid him in his cot.
‘I’m not going to either.’ Draco took a sip of his tea, trying to hide behind his cup. ‘I had to tell Mrs Weasley and Hermione and that was difficult enough.’
Unconsciously, Draco lifted his hand to place his fingers against the mark, prominent on his throat. “Yes, well... I...”
“Oh, Draco…” Adelaide sighed and she moved closer, placing her arms around him and holding him gently. “I’m sure next time it’ll happen…”
Draco buried his face in his hands, embarrassed. ‘No. I don’t know. Maybe.’ He peered at her through his hands and added, ‘I’m so sick of waiting. I feel horrible all the time. I just want to bond to that this weird longing stops.’
His Alpha kicked him down. ‘You are scum of the Earth. You should be happy we found someone that is willing to own you.’
Mrs Weasley sighed a little, making Draco add, ‘but he told me she had no other place to go so of course it’s completely reasonable to still live there and – ’
“I’ll get you something then.” While Molly got up and fixed Harry some breakfast, Draco moved even closer to Harry and rubbed his cheek against Harry’s. From the corner of his eye he could see Adelaide looking away, so he stayed close to Harry and only stopped rubbing his cheek against Harry’s when Molly placed breakfast in front of Harry. Even then he was reluctant to let go of Harry. Molly smiled. “Don’t stop on my account, dear.” She moved back a few steps and when she was far away enough, Draco quickly brushed his cheek against Harry’s one more time before pulling back enough so Harry could eat.
“I remember the salty air… it was windy,” Lupin continued to volunteer information. “I’d run away from home a few months prior, and had settled in Cornwall because it was easy, and there was no magical community.”
‘I don’t,’ Harry gritted out. ‘It’s my instinct. We barely know each other. Having a baby would be a disastrous idea.’
As soon as Draco’s body touched the bed though, he was gone, sleeping the deep sleep only drunken people sleep.
She took one out from underneath the counter and handed that to him, too. “Well, good luck.” She smiled warmly. “Don’t forget you can always contact us if you have any concerns, problems or questions.”
Apparition wasn’t a safe way to travel anymore now that Draco was pregnant and getting further along, so they went to Edinburgh by floo. When they arrived, he allowed Harry to pat the soot off of him. He found it endearing, especially because he knew Harry could care less about what they looked like. It was something Harry did because it gave him an excuse to be close to his mate, and Draco gladly let him. Maybe it made them look overly attached, and maybe other people thought it was tacky, but Draco liked it. It was these small things that made him feel loved and cared for, even though he hadn’t grown up with it.
“The room” - or what Draco assumed was the room the stranger had referred to - was no bigger than a hallway closet, and contained a bed with chains. Crabbe pushed him onto the bed, first chaining his ankles, then undoing the binding spell on his wrists, and chaining those to the top of the bed. “Enjoy your stay,” he said with a wide, wicked smile, showing his yellowing and rotted teeth. Draco once more gathered the spit in his mouth, but was too late to spit Crabbe in the face.
Healer Roberts seemed to make a quick calculation. “So you’ve been through five or six heats so far... That’s enough to be fertile.”
Draco blinked a few times to take in what just had happened and then cradled Alexander gently. “Okay, sure. Do you want to sleep in the guest room?”
Mr Potter stepped forwards and extended his hand. Draco stared at it bewilderedly. Omegas weren’t supposed to shake hands, they weren’t supposed to touch or be touched by anyone. Most everyone would bow for an Omega. What was he supposed to do now?
Now that Lupin had opened the gates for a conversation, Draco assumed it would be okay if he asked questions. “When…”
Where Harry’s magic usually felt soft, soothing and velvety, Healer Roberts’ was more prickly, but not uncomfortable. He sat it out as calmly as he could, keeping his eyes on her expectantly.
“Yes, that sounds great,” he answered automatically and he smiled in the same manner. Worry sparked through the bond and Draco tried to make his smile seem more real. “I’ll be fine, really.”
Harry ran his fingers through his hair, making Draco stop looking at the paper and look at his Alpha.
“Please, what?” he asked, pressing his hips against Draco’s arse while one of his hands sneaked to the front, ghosting over Draco’s thigh, a promise of more in every touch.
“We’ll head towards Crossroads first, for gifts for Molly and Hermione” he decided, looking at Harry for approval.
Breakfast was awkward. Harry mostly chatted with Molly and send sideway glances Draco’s way every now and then, making Draco blush – but try really hard not to blush – and Adelaide chuckle. They weren’t even allowed to sit together – well, they
?’ Harry’s hand started moving again, just a little bit and Draco closed his eyes, ‘yesssss…’ he managed to say, already lost in pleasure.
A few days later, when the tailored clothes arrived at the Burrow, Mrs Weasley pushed Draco and Adelaide into having a little fashion show. Adelaide had responded cheerfully, while Draco had tried to be a bit more reserved – but who was he kidding? He loved the attention.
It was over too soon - Harry’s knot slipped in with a wet noise and Draco whined, grinding his hips against the knot as if trying to get more out of it.
The tugging on Draco’s abdomen restarted and he closed his eyes for a second, feeling incredibly tired already. It wasn’t long before Bella presented their second child with a wide smile, handing her to Harry with the announcement that they had two girls.
‘I was surprised to receive your letter, Mr Potter,’ Miss Parkinson’s voice disturbed Draco’s musings, ‘as I happen to know that you are not Draco’s intended Alpha.’
It was one word that resonated perfectly in Draco’s heart, body and mind. He kneeled, dirty and covered in vomit, at his Alpha’s feet and bared his neck. Everything in him needed to hear that he was a good boy again, that his Alpha wasn’t angry with him anymore, it was all he lived for now.
The Alpha remained frozen in place for a few moments, but then stepped back towards Draco. “Okay... that’s okay...” Harry murmured. “Whatever you need...”
Draco turned to face Harry, wanting to say something about budget, ask how much he could spend, if there were things Harry would like to see him in, but was stunned by Harry’s bright green eyes. He’d seem them before, of course, and had stared at them more than once, but this time Harry looked…
So he tried to eat as little as he could, because he didn’t want to retch it all back up when his father was done with him.
With effort, Draco turned to the other side so he could see his babies. Almost immediately, the intense desire to hold them close to his chest sparked in him. He shook his head and tried to focus. “Okay. So…” Exhaustion crept back up on him and he blinked, struggling to keep his eyes open. “Left one, Victoria, right one, Elizabeth?”
P.S. I'm not really sure about the title, I mainly picked this because well, I wanted to upload something and this was an easy title. I was thinking perhaps I could make the title a play on the HP book titles, like "Draco Malfoy and the curious case of Omega abuse" or something. If you have suggestions, please let me know, I'd love to hear them!
“It’s a girl, yeah,” Bella confirmed as she reached over and carefully placed the first child on Draco’s chest, making sure that it would not put pressure on his ribcage. He instinctively curled his arms around the little baby, who was still weeping but much quieter now. “She’s so pretty,” Draco said, now actually crying.
She had known it wasn’t a bond mark – to bond, he’d have to go into heat again, something his body stubbornly declined to do.
“Hello, dickface.” Draco kept his tone perfectly even. He would not let his emotions get the better of him.
‘I thought I was fine at home,’ he eventually mumbled. ‘It wasn’t that bad… I just felt alone… most of the time but…’
“Mental health” was the title of the top one. After looking at the front for a while, he flipped it open. Once opened, the letters rearranged themselves into an informative text about a private fertility clinic situated in Edinburgh. It looked really pretty and the text was obviously aimed at Omegas, not Alphas.
He woke up due to cramps in his stomach and he pushed his hand against the spot where it hurt the most, groaning, in pain.
Harry laughed. “Haven’t had enough yet?” The lights twinkling in his eyes made Draco clench his muscles in anticipation and he shook his head. Harry laughed again and bent past Draco to turn off the stove, wrapping his arm tightly around his Omega in the process and started to drag him along towards the stairs. Draco stumbled up the stairs with Harry, and only when Harry wanted to move into the room that they were currently sleeping in because their real bedroom contained the nest, Draco refused to move along. He dragged Harry in the direction of the nest room, and while Draco could sense Harry’s confusion, he never commented on it.
Draco whined at the emptiness and wriggled his hips, hoping that doing that would chase away the empty feeling.
“Not that kind of expansion,” Molly answered. She shifted, and carefully took off Adelaide’s scarf, revealing a fresh bond mark at the side of her throat. It went paired by a smaller, twin mark on the other side - one for Arthur, one for Molly.
“Thank you.” Lupin’s voice was quiet, so soft Draco almost hadn’t heard it. “Crowds sometimes spook me.”
‘I won’t do anything you don’t want me to, or make you do things you don’t want to,’ Harry promised. ‘I talked to Hermione about it and she suggested that this would be for the best, as you might go into heat very soon again, and if I’d want to help you through that we’d have to file for permission at the ORO and at that point we might be too late… You’d have to go through it alone.’
“... so all in all, it’s only a matter of deciding what we want,” Draco recapped their visit to Edinburg for Adelaide and Molly.
Draco’s evenings were spent chatting with Adelaide and Molly (sometimes Arthur joined in too) and cuddling with Alexander. During the daytime he was at Hermione’s office, reading his charmed books and making notes on them.
Again, a warm, firm hand slid across his back, fingers grazed across his arse and started rubbing over his wet hole. Draco made needy noises, trying to lean back onto the fingers and rub his aching cock onto
“I feel like shit,” Draco replied drily. “Like you said, they cut me open less than 24 hours ago. What time is it?”
Harry and Hermione were in the office. The door was open. Draco unpacked his things in Harry’s bedroom –
‘Oh.’ Adelaide placed her cutlery down and seemed to hesitate before asking, ‘where are they now? I would have liked to meet them.’
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, breathing unevenly and letting out low, whiny whimpers. Harry’s mouth was hot, soft and wet, and it sent his system into overdrive almost immediately. “F-fuck,” he breathed, wrapping one hand in Harry’s hair and gripping it so tightly his knuckles turned white. It only made Harry chuckle, and that was what sent Draco over the edge. He moaned weakly as he came.
Draco moved his hips, leaning down on Harry’s fingers. ‘But I’m still so wet…’ He gasped as Harry started rubbing against his prostate.
‘Is it allowed for ORO employees to bring their Omegas with them when they do inspections?’ Draco asked.
‘It’s just really crazy at the ORO now and I’ve been reprimanded for not paying enough attention so I really have to focus on my job for a while,’ Harry explained.
‘I – I want to go home,’ he said tightly, trying not to cry. He was not going to cry over something as pity as this.
Harry remained quiet, so Draco continued: “I felt like maybe my feelings...” He swallowed nervously, hoping he didn’t say anything wrong, “...my needs were a nuisance to you. You are always so busy with work that...” Draco fell silent, unsure of how to finish his sentence.
“I washed it, it’s in the wardrobe.” Draco vaguely gestured at the closet before turning to step back into the bathroom. Halfway through the motion, though, he changed his mind and turned back to Harry, just in time to see his mate shed his working clothes. He leaned against the doorpost, watching with interest.
They waited a few minutes, until Adelaide didn’t look as if she was going to sick up all over the place. In the meantime, Harry offered Draco his arm and Draco took it, hooking his arm through Harry’s and pulling him closer possessively. Harry smiled at that and stepped closer to Draco. ‘Ready to go?’
Adelaide grabbed Draco by the wrist and dragged him into the store, ‘come on, I can’t wait to see what they all have!’
‘I’d like Draco to stay here, too,’ Harry requested. ‘As our bond is not quite official yet, I want to keep a good eye on him.’
“We’re looking for some furniture for the nursery, and anything that might be helpful along the way, too,” Harry said. “We haven’t had much time to look around yet. It’s all a little overwhelming.”
Do you think Harry and Draco are unfix-able or do you still see a future for them, knowing that Harry did nothing objectionable after he ordered Draco to obey? What kind of role do you think Draco will have (next to the one of being a victim) in the abuse cases?
‘It was really confusing,’ Draco complained, ‘I had no idea why you suddenly wanted to bite me like that, I thought you maybe had some weird kink you were too embarrassed to talk about.’
Also, my beta (due to an array of issues) has not beta-read this chapter. So if you find weird mistakes, if sentences don't flow that well... I'm sorry, I tried my best.
“Did you read my book?” The food Harry had brought was a near perfect copy of the suggested breakfast in ‘A pregnancy guide’.
Draco shuffled his feet around. “Uhm. No? But he’s such a dear, look at him.” He turned a little to show Harry how calmly Alexander was looking around, with his bright, blue eyes.
‘Look at how I’m doing it.’ Miss Fawley pulled out her chair and sat down gracefully, with her skirt whirling just the right way around her as she did so.
“Better make that meeting quick.” He was just teasing, but felt through their bond that the words made Harry tense.
“Isn’t it also a reference to Arthur?” he dared to ask as he sniffed up the lovely baby smell that hung around the new-born.
Draco lay naked in a puddle of his own vomit. His Alpha raised his wand once more, saying the word Draco so dreaded once more.
‘I – uhm – got a little upset when she said that Harry had left her to be with me and then… her still living with him.’ Draco fidgeted.
Draco liked it. Harry was nice and attentive and brought him gifts and didn’t force him into doing anything.
‘Maybe you could reach out to them and see if they want to meet sometimes,’ Hermione suggested, ‘we could check to see who of them are courting, Harry could owl their suitors and then…’
First of all, I'm sorry that this chapter is over a day late. I've been through some personal stuff the last week and it's prevented me from writing much at all. To make up for it being late, I've made this chapter a little longer than my usual ones.
Mrs Weasley raised her eyebrows. ‘I do not tolerate this kind of behaviour in my kitchen, Draco. Sit up straight and try not to look so cranky.’
Draco mulled this over for a short moment, then looked at his mate, who was surprisingly quiet. Nothing came through the bond, either. “What do you think, Harry?” he asked.
‘You never told me…’ Draco looked at Harry via the mirror, still pressing his fingers against the bite mark.
Draco stepped closer again, studying the moving tiny people, ‘okay…’ he said slowly, and then, much quicker, ‘don’t tell Adelaide I jumped and erm – you know.’
‘You can also contact me if you want Harry to visit again,’ Hermione added after a visible moment of hesitation, ‘or contact Harry, if you want to.’
‘That’s pretty normal for us,’ Draco defended the action, ‘we can’t be friends with Alphas because it’s not appropriate.’
suitable for Omegas.’ She bowed for both Draco and Adelaide. Adelaide, not being able to bow back easily anymore due to her pregnancy, responded in the manner appropriate for a pregnant Omega: she nodded at Miss Parkinson and patted her belly. Draco bowed back swiftly.
Harry sauntered off towards the garden and Draco set to follow him, but Mrs Longbottom grabbed into his sleeve in a surprisingly strong grip for such an old lady. ‘Not you. First, tell me: Why is the Malfoy scion with Auror Potter?’
Draco leaned into his mate, pressing his nose against his hair, allowing his light, fresh smell to clear his senses. “Come on. Take a break.”
Draco nodded slowly. “I do but... sometimes... I just don’t know what to do to or... well...” He drew in another deep breath, “Harry, I love you but I – I’m just not used yet to... sometimes I’m afraid of what you’ll think of me when I tell you everything about how I feel or what I think.”
“We’ll do once with the stimulants, and take a break if we need to do a third round,” Draco decided. Harry once more hummed his agreement.
“I can’t promise they’ll grant you a full pardon,” Harry warned. “Nor can I guarantee any relief of your current sentence.”
“Hmm…” Draco hummed, pushing himself upright. “I still feel like I don’t know her that well.” It made him feel guilty.
“I can try.” Draco shuffled his feet forward so that the man could - hopefully - smell him, recognise him as Omega, as safe.
‘I apologise, Miss Parkinson,’ Blaise hastily said, ‘really, I’m sorry, it’s just been so long and…’
Remus shuffled around in the kitchen, all the noises now familiar to Draco. The tread of his footsteps, the deliberate way with which he opened cupboards, the soft click of the kettle when it was placed on the stove - all were uniquely Remus. He was careful and deliberate with all of his movements. It was so unlike Harry, who had a much heavier footstep, and Draco imagined that Sirius would have a similarly unique way of moving around the house.
Thank you all so much for the lovely comments! I felt super supported (especially after the negative comments a few chapters ago) and I really like your suggestions.
“Me too.” Lupin straightened his back, and Draco could hear his joints pop. He made a face, but Lupin just laughed. “It doesn’t hurt.” He brought the paint cans in from the hallway, starting to stir and pour it. Draco grabbed the broom and swept the dirt, glue patches and nails the carpet had left behind up.
Someone slid an arm under his head, supporting him while he heard the sounds of pillows being fluffed. ‘Oh Draco… This can’t happen any longer…’
Harry pressed him back down. ‘I’m sorry,’ he whispered breathily, lips still against Draco’s pulse point, ‘I couldn’t help it.’
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him even closer, sniffing up his scent and murmuring, groggy, ‘I don’t want to go to work.’
Now that Draco heard her saying “eat and drink”, his throat felt like one of those planets that didn’t have any water on them, so dry. Food didn’t appeal to him… his stomach felt full somehow.
But of course, his mother knew and she opened the door, smiling at him. ‘Hello darling, I’ve got someone for you to meet.’ She stepped aside and a short, burly man stepped in. He was about as tall as Draco was, maybe a bit shorter, and dressed in regular office attire. For the most part, he looked quite acceptable. His hair, however… It was nothing short of an abomination. It was black and stood up on all sides, like some sort of explosion had taken place in there only minutes prior to him stepping in the room, despite obvious attempts to tame the thing. His skin was a soft, golden brown and he smiled at Draco, showing a lovely smile with straight white teeth.
“… missed you too…” Draco mumbled and he hooked his leg around Harry’s hip, feeling an unusual jolt of arousal spike through the bond when he did that. Having picked that up, he moved his hips a little until they pushed snugly against Harry’s. Just a little roll of hips would be enough to stimulate them and he could feel that Harry was already half-hard in his trousers. “I notice you’ve missed me a lot,” Draco smugly said, making Harry groan in frustration. “It was a long day, okay, today was terrible.”
Draco got up and offered Lupin his hand to help him up. When they were both standing, he made eye contact with the Alpha. “Would you mind letting my mate know where I am?”
. It was masculine, musky, warm and undeniably Alpha. He gripped the back of the kitchen chair, trying not to sway. Mr Potter smelled overwhelmingly Alpha-y and he could feel the need to submit trickle back into his mind.
When Harry came home, Draco had dinner ready. The girls were being watched by Remus and they were playing by the beach. It was a shame that Remus could not bring them to his home without Harry or Draco present, but there was only so much wiggle-room and grey areas in the law for them to use.
On Saturday, the trio went to Diagon Alley to do some shopping. As they arrived in the Leaky Cauldron, Remus slipped away from Harry and Draco, murmuring; “I’m meeting someone. I’ll wait for you here.”
‘Mister?’ A girl tugged into his free hand. ‘Mister, the big boys won’t let me on the swing.’ She pouted and Draco smiled at her. ‘Well, let’s go see if I can convince them to let you have a go.’ He ruffled the boys hair again, ‘keep on at it, those cookies look good,’ after which he got up and took the girl’s hand. ‘And what it your name, honey?’
Still rattled, Draco slowly let himself sink back down into the bed. He shuffled over to Harry’s side of the bed, pressing his head into Harry’s pillow, letting the scent overwhelm and calm him. His heart-rate went down to a somewhat normal level. He tried to relax his muscles, but couldn’t force them to. The alarm was still going off, making his ears ring and filling the room with saturated light.
Draco had heard this explanation at least a dozen of times before, but miss Fawley stayed patient, so he had to try to be equally patient. He scooted his right foot backwords, the left one over to the right and made the odd half-turn he had to make to end up in his chair the right way. Well, that was the theory of it. He couldn’t make the turn, but lost his balance and almost fell over, tripping over the chair legs.
‘What are wrackspurts?’ Draco asked confused and Luna patted him on the back, saying, ‘it’s okay not to know… not many people know… Wrackspurts... They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.’
They hadn’t bought anything for the baby yet - Draco wasn’t sure why Harry had not yet suggested it. He hasn’t said anything yet because somewhere, deep down - he felt fearful, afraid that they would fail, that he would never fall pregnant and then, be stuck with so many things they could never use.
Draco let out a relieved, breathy sigh. “I guess we’ll have to schedule an appointment at St Mungo's then.”
‘Ah, yes, I see. Walk on straight ahead and feel free to pick whatever you like from the racks. Anything you like we can tailor to your every need.’ The Beta gestured inwards, to the store. It was definitely wizarding space, because from outside is had seemed really small, but it was actually quite spacious. Harry let go of Draco and gave him a little, encouraging push. ‘Go on then, find some things that you like.’
experienced any mood swings and his heat was due in a week, so if this was all, it wasn’t that bad at all. Of course the daily potions tasted foul – they only seemed to get more disgusting as the days went by – but it was well worth the sacrifice.
“Remus can be vulnerable sometimes,” Harry replied. His tone was tense. “But he’s strong and stubborn. He’ll make it, with or without Sirius.”
When they entered the Leaky Cauldron to pick up Remus - but not before picking up a tub of mocha ice cream at Fortescue's - Remus was still sitting in the dark corner, now joined by a third figure.
Harry swallowed and shook his head. ‘You need a cold bath first. Come on.’ He slid his arms underneath Draco’s body, lifting him up and holding him close. Draco moaned a little and tried to lean into his Alpha more.
He turned to see Adelaide looking gleefully at him, ‘Harry says we’re done here. We can go home now.’
His mother looked positively furious. ‘If I may, Mr Potter. Omega skin bruises easily and Draco’s skin is particularly sensitive. Next to that he is a bit clumsy. If he walks into something it will immediately cause bruising on his skin.’
Draco crossed his arms in front of his stomach, obscuring it from the curious gaze of Miss Parkinson.
‘We won’t,’ Harry promised, dragging his lips over the sensitive skin around the bite mark. ‘When your temperature is down a bit more…’
Behind them, someone coughed. “Adelaide, I’ll be taking Draco home now. Thank you for keeping him company.”
It was one of those rare days on which he had nowhere to go, and so he had remained in Grimmauld Place. With no-one in the house but him, he finished his chores in a hurry and then sat down in the downstairs living room. He eyed the leaflets for a while before he finally mustered up the courage to take a look at them.
“Ah.” Hermione gave them both a cup of tea and closed the office door on her way back to her desk chair. “So…”
Memory-Harry balled his hands into fists and relaxed them again, clearly trying to remain calm despite his obvious anger. ‘Gin, I’m very serious about Draco. I don’t want you to say things like that to him. He’s still frail.’
Draco gasped and closed his eyes again as the praise washed over him. He started to pant when Harry slowly pressed his hand inside him, trying to relax his muscles to that his Alpha could fill him completely.
Whilst leafing through the Prophet, Draco could hear Harry and Hermione discussing the Omegas that were on their “possibly abused” list. After having visited most of the Omegas on the list, the investigation had come to a standstill once again and Draco knew there was a lot of pressure on Harry to wrap the cases up so he could return to his work at the Aurors.
After the imprisonment, Myrion was closed for a few months, until Blaise Zabini gained all the permits to re-open Myrion. He became the new principle and implemented a few changes immediately; a lot of subjects were cut and Myrion became open to sensitive Betas as well as Omegas. Alphas still aren’t welcome though.
“Kinda stressed,” Harry admitted when Draco didn’t start. “Work’s a mess.” He sighed. “Home is… I don’t know. Different.”
It was a quiet Friday morning when an owl flew through the open window of the garden, dropping a delicately wrapped package on Lupin’s lap before circling the kitchen and leaving it through the window it had used to come inside.
“Okay.” Lupin clutched the binder with paperwork even tighter, and started walking. A few steps in, Draco offered Lupin his arm, and Lupin took it with nimble, hesitant fingers.
Draco hesitated, wanting to find the right way to put his feelings to words, “it’s… I hate it that he’s gone so much.”
‘Very well.’ Queen Violet leafed through the paper and found something that mentioned the aforementioned name somewhere in the back. She cleared her throat and started reading. ‘Unusual appointment. Head Auror Robards has to temporarily do without one of the DMLE’s best aurors, has Mr Harry Potter has been appointed to help the Omega Regulation Office due to the influx of abuse cases. Mr Potter was not available for comment.’
Harry caught Draco in his arm once more and pulled him back, kissing him fiercely. “Okay,” he mumbled, “okay…” He let his free hand slide down Draco’s back, placing a light, toying pressure on the sensitive pressure point in the small of his back. It made Draco moan, and he stepped closer to Harry again. He initiated a lazy, open-mouthed kiss, allowing Harry to take the lead. When Harry slipped his warm hands underneath his shirt, Draco moaned again. The touch of his mate, however careful, was enough to set a fire ablaze in his body, sending hot tingles of want all through him. It had been so long - during the end stretch of his pregnancy, he had been too tired to do anything anymore, even if he had wanted Harry - that he forgot to reciprocate, hanging against Harry in a half-drunken daze.
Draco had to bite back the urge to yank his arm out of her hands. ‘Harry is courting me. Spending time with him when he is on duty is one of the things I’ll have to get used to therefore my Alpha gave permission to join him every now and then.’ It was the answer he and Hermione had come up with for when anyone cared to ask, although Harry had mucked up royally by saying something else to Miss Greengrass.
Harry shrugged. “I might have leafed through it when I woke up early this morning. I mean, if we’re going to be serious about...”  He didn’t finish his sentence and coughed a little awkwardly, something Draco had come to recognise as a sign of nervousness.
‘A sleepover?’ Draco questioned out loud, wondering if he’d heard Mrs Weasley say that correctly. ‘But I spend almost all my time at Grimmauld Place. Harry and I are together all the time.’
‘I know it’s – sweet Merlin there’s a route, look, Harry, it says, “see everything”!’ He pointed at the sign, but forgot to step off the stairs. Harry slipped his arm around Draco’s waist and lifted him up a little to that he wouldn’t trip.
Harry stretched and yawned, rubbing his eyes and leaving an ink mark on his brow bone. Draco chuckled. “I think it’s time for a break. How about a walk?”
“Yes,” Draco interrupted. “Besides, I don’t think I’ll be able to keep myself from rushing back into the nursery without it. You’ll have to restrain me.” As he spoke the words, he could feel the tug towards the nursery in his stomach, and without consciously doing so, he started to circle his mate so that he was closer to the door, already planning his escape.
During the next week or so, Draco collected things he thought he might need when he was ready to build a nest. Most of the things were his and Harry’s, though he did eventually acquire one of Molly’s aprons and a pair of mittens that Adelaide had worn throughout the winter. He’d manned up and asked Adelaide for the mittens, though he wasn’t sure how Molly’s apron had ended up in the pile of stuff he had collected. He suspected it was Harry’s work, but never mentioned it.
‘I’ll go get that file then,’ Hermione decided, getting up and looking at how Harry and Draco were still somewhat intertwined, ‘I think you two have something to talk about anyway.’
He put the book to the side, deciding to buy it and bravely started to examine his more adventurous picks, among those were, “Being bonded”, about Alpha-Omega bonds, “Spice”, in which he hoped to find some information about being self-lubricating outside of heat, and, definitely the most bold one, “Complete submission”. That title was self-explanatory.
With a flick of the guard’s wand, the man’s hands and ankles got chained to a pole anchored in the ground next to the fireplace. The man was pulled forward uncomfortably, falling to his knees and grunting as it happened. Draco now understood why Remus was on the floor.
‘Excuse me, but where did you get these bruises?’ Mr Potter pointed out a few bruises on Draco’s arms, and legs. ‘And the one on your back as well, please.’
‘It’s going to be just fine,’ Hermione reassured him, as if she’d noticed his reluctance. She gently took his arm. ‘Just bent forward with me…’ She pushed him forward to look into the pensieve and then he felt some sort of weird pulling sensation. He was being pulled forward, sucked into the pensieve.
Let me know what you think in the comments! (I love reading/getting comments so much, it's very motivating!)
“Take some time to think about it. I’ll make sure Bella comes in to check up on you and get you ready soon, okay?”
This time, Draco was the one to breath in sharply. “It’s not... it’s not a need in the sense that... it wouldn’t hurt me physically if I wouldn’t get pregnant.”
‘Uhm. Harry and Hermione are downstairs, in the kitchen. Hermione wants to show me Harry’s memories of erm – what I told you about. Is that okay?’
Strong hands lifted him out of his chair and Draco pressed his face against Harry’s chest, sniffing up that divine smell and moaning because of it. He rubbed himself against Harry, even more randy now that his Alpha was near.
‘It was filed away somewhere in the Department of Mysteries, god knows why, but anyway, he owns more than three Omegas, so he’s doing something illegal!’ Hermione led the way, running up the stairs.
Miss Fawley seemed momentarily confused, but picked up her role as Queen Violet quickly again. ‘Another rogue soldier, my King?’
Harry sounded frustrated and it was possible that he told the truth, but still, he had denied to be with someone when Draco had asked, and Draco was hurt. Functioning Alpha-Alpha relationships were almost as holy as a good Alpha-Omega one and if Harry had stepped out to one to be with Draco, that was something Draco could not accept.
They went for lunch at Grimmauld Place. Harry made sandwiches and asked, ‘what did you think of Neville?’
Draco turned his head back at her, surprised. ‘Of course I like him! Does it seem like I don’t?’ What if he hadn’t expressed his fondness of Harry enough, what if Harry thought Draco wasn’t interested after all?
She left and Harry took place in the chair he’d sat in before, too. It had been too quick for Draco or Astoria to stand up for him, but Harry made a dismissive gesture with his hand, ‘no need to get up for me.’ He took his clipboard and some parchment out of his satchel and went through the same set of questions with Astoria as he had done three months prior, so Draco tuned out of it a bit, not listening to what Harry said but trying to see if Astoria’s body language gave anything away.
Aaawwwriightt, what do you think? Will Draco muster up the courage to tell Harry about his wishes? Do you think Harry is unaware of Draco's wish to get pregnant, or maybe he does know, and is just not ready for that?
Draco nodded, slowly realising where she was going with this. But by the time he had figured it out, Adelaide was already out of bed.
Draco heard the urgency in Harry’s voice, almost like a command, making him step back, trying to escape the near-command and the pressure he could feel coming from his Alpha to say something,
It was the wrong question to ask, as no one answered it for a good forty seconds. The silence was awkward.
Harry stirred something in a large pan, not looking at Hermione. ‘I was hoping you could suggest to Ron and her that they visit Molly. Ginny could stay the night there.’
When they broke their kiss, both panting, Draco let his lips skate over Harry’s shoulder, along his collarbone and back to his throat, making him tip his head back. If Draco wanted to, he could make Harry surrender to him completely. The feeling of having that kind of power over his Alpha was strangely arousing. He moaned, then whimpered Harry’s name. “Need you, Harry.” He let his hands slip down, fingering the elastic band of Harry’s boxers whilst Harry’s hands did the same, undoing Draco’s trousers hurriedly.
By the time five o’clock came around, he went upstairs, showered, prepared himself, put on clean clothes and went back downstairs to finish cooking. Neither Ron nor Hermione were home yet, which was curious – they were usually home well before Harry.
“I can’t look,” Harry said, and Draco turned his head towards his mate, who indeed was still looking at the ceiling. Draco laughed, crawling in between Harry and the table, on top of his mate and kissed him elatedly. “It’s positive, it’s positive,” he laughed, feeling lighter than ever.
Draco sniffed a little, trying to smell whoever this was. He smelled something familiar and sniffed again.
After that you’d step into the store itself and you’d be surrounded by tall bookshelves that formed a maze through the store. In each section, there was a second-hand sub-section. Most second-hand books that were sold at Crossroads were still in a good condition, but they did have a section in the back in which you could find the books that were old and tattered. Molly always looked for books there, Draco knew.
“Riddle did,” Harry murmured. “They’d hidden because Riddle was kidnapping fertile Omegas - no doubt to use them in human trafficking or a breeding ring - and his eye had fallen to my mother. Sirius was the only person who knew of the safehouse.” He moved closer, wrapping an arm around Draco and leaning his cheek against Draco's knee. It seemed he was aware of Draco’s disinclination to grant him eye contact, but needed his mate’s soothing touch nonetheless. Draco yielded kindly, allowing it and running his fingers through Harry’s hair - it was soft, and wet at the edges, as if it had been raining when he left Azkaban.
‘Draco?! Harry’s here!’ Mrs Weasley called up the stairs. It was still early and he’d only just woken up, but hearing that Harry was here made him feel energetic and he got dressed swiftly. The Weasleys didn’t have much money to spare, so Mrs Weasley had tailored some of Mr Weasley’s things. Draco also had received a few things from Mrs Weasley’s sons. Everything fit him all right, but it was not the quality he was used to and some things made his skin itch. He knew he had to be thankful – which he was – but it did take some getting used to. When he looked in the mirror, he looked common. Not pretty. Not Omega-like. Just…common.
– and had left the door open as well. It was reassuring to know that he only had to lift his head to see his Alpha. The feeling of having him near made his nerves ease a bit.
Remus hummed. “Not awful, actually. We’re past the stage of organising and collecting all the intel he has, and the information has been deemed useful - they used it to track down Riddle’s hiding place. Now, the Wizengamot needs to decide if the information has been enough to lighten his sentence. I know Sirius was hoping for a pardon, but that’s wishful thinking. But I believe they may decide he can go to a low-security prison. Hermione is trying to argue that, for my health, Sirius needs to be rehomed in a Ministry convict home. They’re usually used to rehabilitate people that are low level, repeat offenders. People who commit shop theft, vandalism, that sort of thing.”
Draco closed his eyes, mustering up the courage to say it. ‘I – IthinkI’mreadytobondwithyou,’ he spluttered awkwardly
“Hmmm… sounds pretty awful,” Draco acceded and he rolled his hips a little, feeling Harry harden because of the movement. “How can I make it better?”
“Well, anyway, how are you and Harry?” Adelaide brushed their previous subject aside easily and looked at him curiously.
‘It’s okay,’ the Alpha muttered and he wrapped strong arms around Draco, lifting him up and bringing him back into the bedroom.
“Low-level,” Draco murmured, “I thought they were Braxton Hicks first. But now my back hurts too, and…” he made a face as the pain flared a little more, “... and the pelvic pressure is insane.” It was strange how he managed to talk to her. He hadn’t been able to with Remus  - seeing Healer Roberts soothed him more than he had anticipated.
He ended up catching a few more hours of fitful sleep before waking because of a sharp pain in his abdomen. Using one of the breathing exercises he’d learned at Sunny Springs, he started to breathe through it. This wasn’t the first time he was having Braxton Hicks contractions. “Stupid fake-ass contractions,” he grumbled to himself.
‘We’re keeping an eye on the Omegas on that list because we think that they might have something to do with the cases as well.’ Harry provided
‘Alright…’ Harry gave Draco a slow, deep, open-mouthed kiss, taking his breath away and leaving him whimpering in want. He bent back down, kissing at Draco’s pulse point and biting at it again, whilst gently pushing two fingers in and scissoring him open.
The next week, Harry was out in the field again and left early in the morning, sometimes to come back home past midnight. Draco stayed at the Burrow, because he just couldn’t bear to be at Grimmauld Place at night without Harry. He had tried – two nights – but it was awful: going to bed alone in a cold bed which he couldn’t seem to warm up with his own body heat, insomnia due to worrying about Harry and then when Harry crashed into bed late at night for a few hours of sleep, there was no cuddling to be done. Harry was simply too tired.
‘Draco, that’s unhealthy!’ Mrs Weasley reprimanded him, ‘you need certain things when you’re in heat, denying that could at worst kill you! And you’re still so fragile…’ She pulled him closer, hugging him tight, though awkward because Draco still half-sat in his chair, as was she.
“Okay.” Harry kissed him again and Draco sighed a little, not really wanting his Alpha to leave. “I’ll be home at six, okay?”
‘About his heats, about whether or not we treat him right and then he made our child undress, because apparently Potter had orders to check for signs of physical abuse! As if we would EVER do such a thing to our precious boy!’
Harry made a choking sound and then burst out into laughter, ‘a stupid fish? Where do you even come up with these phrases?’
Draco whimpered. He moved his hips against Harry’s hand, hard again, wanting to come quickly. But Harry took his time, gently stroking Draco’s cock, rubbing his fingers over his head before moving back down again to first him tightly, making Draco choke on his own breath. ‘Harry… please.’
“That’s good, considering you’ll have to take those for a while,”  Adelaide said, and Draco couldn’t quite discern whether she was teasing him, or was being serious.
‘I’ve got it,’ Hermione said, still sounding annoyed. ‘Here.’ She levitated the list over to Draco, who plucked it out of the air. ‘It’s getting longer,’ he remarked whilst checking the names. Some were unfamiliar, but he knew all the older Omegas on the list. ‘I’m not sure about the younger ones, but all the older ones went to Myrion,’ Draco slowly said, ‘maybe that’s what they all have in common.’
Harry frowned, ‘but you just told me that there were no prospects of switching owners within the upcoming six months, Astoria.’
“I’m huge.” Examining his side profile in the mirror was a horrifying experience nowadays. Despite efforts to prevent them, his stomach was littered with stretch marks, the skin pulled taut so tightly that touching it hurt. “I can’t believe I’m supposed to go on like this for four more
“Say that to the ORO and the DMLE.” He took a swig of his tea as if it was whiskey. “They decided on the current arrangement. Tonks was happy to take me. I guess her type is broken and abused.”
Draco moved back a little, pushing his hips back in Harry’s lap, moaning a little. ‘You took good care of me.’
Adelaide sat on the other side of the sunroom, feeding Alexander and talking to him in a low, quiet tone. Draco couldn’t make out what she was saying, and assumed it wasn’t meant for him anyway. He sat on the chaise lounge near the French doors, and if he lifted his head, Harry was in his direct line of sight. The nearness of his mate comforted him, and once again, he worried about what he’d do when Harry would go back to work.
Waking up from his second heat, Draco felt even more broken than the first time. He didn’t dare look at his hips, arms and legs, sure that they would be littered with bruises. They
Harry pulled him forwards until Draco folded himself over his mate. Placing his fingers against the sensitive spot in the small of Draco’s back again, Harry moved to work his knot inside Draco one more time, Draco being compliant and moaning his consent weakly as he did so.
Draco tucked his head under Harry’s chin, pushing closer to the warm Alpha, enjoying the gentle, soft touches too much to protest the words that accompanied them. He would have crawled inside Harry if he could.
He nodded and smiled submissively. She leaned forward to hug him a little and then got up. ‘Just stay right here, I’ll be back soon.’
Draco stumbled out of the floo and came eye to eye with a breastfeeding Adelaide. He awkwardly looked away. “Erhm… Hi.”
Draco sat back down again, looking at Astoria, not knowing what to say or how to start a conversation.
“Then we’ll go through first. Hermione will follow us.” Remus sent a dangerous look Hermione’s way, warning her of something that Draco didn’t catch.
They were quiet for a long time, until Harry tentatively said, “we still need to talk about your books.” He said it carefully, calmly, so as not to trigger Draco.
It surprised Draco time and time again how adept she was at convincing him to talk, even though they already had many arguments much like this one. “Just promise me you won’t tell Harry.”
“Good - good boy,” the Alpha praised in a hiss, finally getting his knot in and almost immediately coming, too.
‘Yes! Could you just shut up for a while and let me finish what I’m trying to say?’ Draco irritably responded. ‘I’ve thought about it a lot and I want to be yours. I don’t want to have to go back to the Burrow and I hate sneaking to your room when I stay the night – as if Adelaide doesn’t know I’m doing that! I want your home to be my home and I just – I’m ready to be yours.’
“Well, her primary goal was keeping you alive when you arrived.” Harry sat down next to Draco, allowing him to come closer. Being in physical contact made Draco feel safe - which was silly, because there wasn’t anything to be afraid of.
“I don’t know,” Harry murmured, “I was a child when it happened. Maybe prison is what he deserved, but Azkaban… it’s a rough place.”
he thought, feeling a bit disappointed. It was really fun to play with the children that were at the day-care at Myrion. He’d been annoyed first when Harry dropped him here so he could look around on his own, but now…
‘You are a bit reluctant at times… As if you’re not a hundred percent sure you want this yet,’ Adelaide said, biting her lip, ‘but that’s just what I’m picking up, I don’t know how he interprets that…’
Draco whipped his head back, finding Adelaide standing in front of him. His stomach flipped upside down, and he forcefully swallowed the nausea back down. “Sure. Thanks.”
Draco crawled to him, feeling brave and placing a hand on Harry’s groin. Harry was definitely ready for action and Draco could
“The potions do tend to have that effect.”  Healer Roberts kept her tone even and friendly, nondescript. “You could forego the stimulants - that way you’ll go into heat again at a more natural pace, although it will still come sooner than your regular schedule.”
“Don’t say that about yourself.” Draco reached across the table to touch Lupin’s hand. “You’re not broken. You’re healing.”
“I hope you’re happy.”  It sounded stiff and Draco blinked. “I am.”  He looked at Harry and couldn’t suppress a little smile. “Harry is the best Alpha I’ve ever had. I love him.”
tired. Can we arrange to meet and discuss everything some other day?” Tired was an understatement. He felt dead on his feet, and ready for another comfort nap in his nest. With the new plushies, of course.
As the days passed by without seeing his Alpha, Draco became grumpier and grumpier. Mrs Weasley had told him that Harry couldn’t visit until everything had been taken care of and formalised, but he hadn’t thought it would take
“Alright, let’s get to the fun part.” Healer Roberts left her chair and motioned for Draco to take his place on a large treatment bench. It had been covered in soft fabric and Draco couldn’t help but relax into it a little. Harry took his place at Draco’s side, one hand on the treatment bench and the other intertwined with Draco’s.
The sudden re-appearance of Miss Greengrass and Harry had startled Draco, but he tried to appear unmoved, as if the conversation between him and Astoria had been completely normal.
Draco shook his head. His legs would not hold him now, not now that he was burning and hot and wet… oh god, he was so wet.
The sheets he had weaved between the posters of the ground bed that formed the basis of the nest could go, too. He took them down and added them to the laundry pile.
Also, Draco kinda has a praise kink, doesn't he? I didn't even realise I wrote him like that but oops, I think I just did, haha
‘Okay, in that case, good luck honey.’ She smiled her utmost motherly smile at him and turned back around to finish her work.
“Shh…I’m not ready to talk yet,” Draco murmured as he found his way into Harry’s arms. Harry slowly brought up his arms to encircle Draco’s body gently, keeping him close but trying not to restrict him.
‘Yes. I have four tutors that visit me regularly,’ Draco answered relieved, glad that they were back to normal questions again.
Draco breathed in through his nose, letting Harry’s scent calm him a little and then nodded. “You’re right. I’m being irrational.”
‘No. I don’t want you to touch me.’ Draco made sure to articulate every word, so that Harry could not misunderstand him.
Will/did Harry bite Draco at the right point to bond with him? Does Draco know? Why didn't Harry want to take Draco at first, and why did he eventually do it?
‘Oh, sweetheart, honey…’ his mother whispered and she gently stroked his hair out of his face. ‘It’s okay… I’ll cancel all your appointments today, okay? Shhh, oh honey…’
Harry sighed. ‘I know.’ He ran his fingers through his hair again, ‘I guess I’ll go talk to Robards and request a team to confiscate Parkinson’s personal files. Maybe I can convince him to bring her in for questioning as well.’
‘Well – for the technical explanation you should ask Hermione – but it’s kind of like Muggle magic. There are these tiny squares on the screen, called pixels and together they form a picture, a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, only bigger. And to make the picture seem like it’s moving they let the new pictures follow up the previous one really quick. I’m not sure how they do the sound but – at least you know it’s not real people in there.’
It seemed endless, a never-ending siege, until suddenly everything died out. The spellfire stopped. The noises stopped. Aurors were rounding up whoever of Riddle’s comrade’s were left while others tended to the wounded, and others collected the bodies of the dead, carefully making a selection between friend and foe.
“Nothing! Just sit...”  Draco looked around, looking for a surface that was safe for Harry to sit on while he decorated, “... there.”
Draco stared at his tea cup, hoping to find the answers in there, and remaining quiet until he found the words to express how weird he’d been feeling.
Harry set Elizabeth’s now-empty bottle on the commode and burped her before answering, “they found Riddle’s hideout and sent in a team to bring him in, but it didn’t go so well. They needed emergency backup.”
Draco managed to stay with them for an hour, feeling incredibly bored and out of place, and then got up. ‘I think I’ll go to bed as well now. I’m tired.’ The fact that it was only half past eight made his lie uncredulous, but both Harry and Hermione nodded and wished him a good night.
“Later this week.” Draco placed a hand on his steadily growing - though still small - bump. “But so far everything’s looking good. So no worries here.”
. “Well. I assume you’re not here to socialise - I’m not. So, uh. I’ll just read until visiting time is over.” They were allotted a maximum of two hours every day.
‘Mr Potter is here to talk to you about the time Draco spent here, as well as go through some of his academic achievements,’ Miss Parkinson interrupted.
“Will do,” Draco answered, suddenly tired. He followed Harry with his eyes as he left the kitchen. When he was sure Harry wouldn’t hear him, he sighed deeply.
Draco turned his head, looking at his Alpha, feeling desperate, ‘yes, Harry, please, fist me.’ He could see that his Alpha was ready to take him and watched the internal conflict play out in front of him, until Harry swallowed and pressed his fingers into a cone. It was as if Harry had found his inner Alpha when he said, ‘you need it, don’t you? My perfect Omega.’
The shower was hot, much hotter than he actually liked it. He brushed his teeth ferociously, until his gums bled from it.
‘You don’t have to understand it,’ Harry said, fighting to stay calm. ‘And if I may remind you, this is my house and I am the real Alpha in this household. If you don’t like what’s happening here, feel free to leave.’
There weren’t enough seats to seat everyone at the large kitchen table, so everyone filed back into the living room. Molly took her place in front of the fireplace, and Arthur stood a step behind her, on her right side. She waited for everyone to quiet down, before stretching her arm towards Adelaide, who rose from her seat to join Molly and Arthur, fitting herself between them and playing with the edges of her scarf nervously.
Also, I've hinted at our (male) villain a few times, but not really given much information about him. Who do you think it is?
Draco wondered how long it would take Harry to pick up his soured smell, and decided to keep him waiting no longer than 72 hours.
When he padded back to Harry in the kitchen, he didn’t dare look at the stupid stick. He tossed it in front of Harry on the table. “It says to wait three minutes,” he announced, and Harry cast a wordless tempus to count down.
“You don’t have a choice.” Remus stepped closer, moving into Hermione's space and placing a supportive arm around Draco’s waist. “Let’s just get it checked out. It could be false alarm. Who knows.”
Okay so here is chapter 3, finally. I've been working on it for a long time, and I'm still not 100% satisfied but I guess I'll never be.
The Shepherd’s Inn was nicer than Draco had anticipated. Like the Leaky Cauldron, it had a downstairs pub, and rooms upstairs. The pub was, considering the fact that it was early in the morning, expectedly empty, save for a young redheaded witch wearing a long, sweeping dress manning the counter. It was dramatic, but the kind of dramatic Draco appreciated. She took them in, looking at them maybe a second longer than Draco felt was polite, then said; “name?”
‘Yes, sir. My family entertains a great deal of people on a regular basis and among our regular guests are many Alphas. It deemed us best to prevent anything… inappropriate from happening.’
He jerked his head back up. Behind Mr Weasley stood a familiar figure. He blinked, and then again for good measure. ‘Adelaide?’ he managed.
‘I gathered that much, even when you slept you kept moving,’ Harry answered a little breathlessly and then he moaned. Draco wondered at first, why his Alpha would moan, but then felt a new, hot stream of come dripping into his body. He moaned and wriggled his hips against the odd sensation of feeling his Alpha come when he himself was already done. It was weird, but felt… nice, somehow. It was reassuring to know that his Alpha wanted him, but he did wonder… ‘How’s that even happening?’ he asked as he tried to turn a bit to see Harry’s face.
The cold baths weren’t enough. Draco should have known. The emptiness gnawed at his insides and he craved for something, anything to fill his arse with.
“Just don’t think about it,” Draco interrupted. “We're here now, we'll just have to see what they can do for us.” He kissed Harry again, this time lingering a little. As the door opened and  Bella came in with a tray, another woman followed. Draco quickly rubbed his cheek against Harry’s in what he hoped was a comforting fashion before pulling back. Both women were looking at them and he blushed a little.
Harry sighed and reached out to Draco, pulling him closer. “You’re so perfect,” he softly mumbled again, lips against Draco’s ear and then moving to their bond mark, nipping at it lightly. Draco purred quietly, happy with the compliment but growing restless again. He felt a faint annoyance - so soon again? It was as if the fire inside him demanded more this time, was so allconsuming, so terrifyingly hot, he -
“We do,” Harry confirmed and Draco felt the cold, sharp fear that had been stuck in his stomach evaporate.
like they were bruised all over. Turning over on his back wasn’t an option either - he knew due to his nature it was nearly impossible to have ripped his arsehole, but it sure felt that way.
“I just changed the bedding. Didn’t wanna do it again,” Draco answered, not yet past his breathlessness. Harry laughed again.
As the door quietly clicked back into its hold, Lupin relaxed some of the tension he carried in his body. Draco offered him a chair and turned towards the kitchen counter to get them both a glass of water.
Draco quickly looked at Harry, who again smiled that hopeful smile, making Draco wonder what he was thinking.
Harry chuckled. ‘Yes, I have to. Molly was angry enough that I’d bitten you like that – she gave me a whole sermon about pushing you into things you’re not ready for. It was pretty terrifying. I don’t want her to shout at me again.’
Draco could feel her eyes sliding over them with new eyes, but she made no comment and filled out everything.
It was good, so good, Draco though he was going to faint again. But he didn’t. Instead he felt the rushing sensation prickling and tingling all over, moaning and whimpering thinking this was the best thing ever and he never wanted it to stop.
‘Oh, I’m not sure but my father visits him sometimes to see what he can do for me… I wanted to live at home, you know…’
Harry, on the other hand, has gotten used to sleeping in rather quickly since his leave of absence, and eventually the two of them had settled with getting up around ten every morning.
Draco placed his hand over Harry’s. “Don’t say things you don’t mean,” he murmured, trying not to get his hopes up.
I also tried to put in some things about Harry's day-to-day life and place Draco within that, because, let's be honest, those two are going to end up together and why not have Draco explore the domestic life in Grimmauld Place a bit?
When they let up a little, he sat up. They returned again, this time accompanied by nausea and a cold, flaring pain in his lower back. “Fucking hell.” There was no one around to hear it, but swearing felt good.
Draco eyed her stomach, ‘well, yes but you are pregnant and I am not. You’re getting heavier because you’re carrying a child in there, I’m getting heavy because of Mrs Weasley’s cooking’s and how much she feeds us. Maybe she’s preparing us for slaughter…’ he mused.
“Hello, can I help you?” A soft, female voice came from Draco’s side, and he turned his head, finding himself eye-to-eye with one of the store employees.
“This,” he said, and he handed Harry the contract, but not the letter. He left the letter on the table, unsure if Lupin wanted Harry to read it.
Clueless about the direction his mate was pushing the conversation, Harry rapped his knuckles against the table in what Draco interpreted as a frustrated manner. “The house is impenetrable, Draco, I promise you. I change the security spells every week, the floo is guarded and masked, and only a handful of people even possess the magic to see or sense the house, let alone enter it.”
The cases are slowly coming to an end! In the next 2-3 chapters (I think, it might be a bit more, don't pin me down on this!) the cases will be closed, and this story will come to an end as well.
‘We strive to create the perfect environment for both Omegas and their children,’ Miss Parkinson answered, sounding strict. ‘Hogwarts, however, is the perfect example of an environment
“We’ll write to her too,” Draco decided. He took the parchment and pens Harry brought, and stretched up to kiss his mate. “Why don’t you go lie down. We’ll write some letters and you can look them over before we send them out.”
“I’m not,” Hermione calmly attested. “But I am your friend, as well as a qualified ORO official, so you can talk to me about it.”
“Yeah, it is my stupid Alpha lizard brain,” he agreed, trying to use an appeasing tone. “But it’s me when I say I think you’re beautiful. I love you for
The other made a quiet, low, sad noise, and Draco didn’t dare guess why. Instead, he asked, “what’s your name? I’m Draco.”
Draco picked up a new set of potions at the front desk. “So, you continue taking these every day,” Bella instructed, “and then also take these,” she gestured to a set of red vials, “every night. They might make you feel like you’re itchy and sweating every drop of water out of your body, so if you do, make sure you drink plenty.”
Draco chuckled and kept moving until Harry responded and he felt the knot harden again. ‘No, never. You’re mine now.’ He moved his head back, exposing the red bite mark whilst locking eyes with Harry. Harry licked his lips and bent towards the mark to gently sink his teeth in it again. Draco moaned. He brought up a hand and tangled it in Harry’s hair, forcing him to remain near the bond mark. Just the soft bites, kisses and caresses where enough to bring him to completion again and he sighed, fully satisfied.
Draco gritted his teeth. Mr Potter was very nosy. ‘My father comes up with a fitting solution for the issue.’
needed. He knew better what to expect this time. It would be easier to fight. Maybe cold baths could keep it at bay for however long this was going to take.
Lupin put his cup back on the saucer with a clang. It made Draco flinch. Noises now reached his ears unfiltered, and as his pregnancy grew on, even the lightest of impulses could set him off. Lupin didn’t seem to notice, or didn’t care. He placed the package on the kitchen table. His hands were trembling. It was hard to get a grip on the silky ribbon that tied the package close.
“Come on baby,” Harry murmured as he dragged Draco along with him towards their bed. When they were close enough, Harry let his weight fall to the side, letting them fall into the bed. Draco playfully rolled over, away from his mate, only to be caged within Harry’s arms and legs seconds later.
Draco sat down with controlled motions, tucking his feet underneath him, keeping his face towards his lap, mumbling, “I know. But…”
‘Yes Miss Molly,’ he repeated, looking up to her. She smiled. ‘Just Molly, Draco. Just my first name.’ She squeezes his shoulder again and then left.
He closed his eyes again and carefully stretched his limbs, groaning when he felt a sharp pain sting in his abdomen.
Adelaide squeezed Draco’s leg and he looked up. She pointed at Harry and Mrs Weasley and Draco turned his head, trying to listen to the conversation that somewhere along his musings had gotten a lot more heated.
“I’m fine,” Draco grumbled in response. “Stupid Braxton Hicks. It’s nothing.” He settled on the empty chaise lounge and pulled up his legs. “Have we heard anything from Harry yet?” He made a weak attempt at pretending he was totally calm and not panicked by the situation at all.
They sat in silence for a while. Draco deepened and slowed his breath, acknowledging his relief and happiness and letting it settle deeper in his body and mind with every breath he took. He felt Harry’s tears against his shoulder, but was not worried. Through their bond, he could feel many of his own emotions reflected back at him. Harry was happy too.
Remus placed his wrist against the door lock, and the door opened. He let Draco step inside first. The visiting room was only marginally better than the other spaces they had travelled through to get here. It was more or less square, held an unlit fireplace, two dingy couches and a kitchen table with chairs that looked like they’d seen their best days fifty years ago. There were no windows.
‘When I viewed Harry’s memories, I came to the conclusion that the truth about either of your stories lies somewhere in the middle. To help you understand this, I have brought a pensieve. If you’d like to, we can view Harry’s memories. That is why he is here, so he can provide them for us now, as he was unwilling to part with them even for a short while.’
“I know.” Draco stepped over Riddle’s dead body, knocking the door open with his shoulder. “I can’t be in this room anymore.”
Nausea and panic tugged on his stomach as his captors disapparated away with him. The last thing he saw was Remus casually strolling around the pond with the twins, back turned towards Draco.
“If it’s too much I’ll apparate us home,” Harry said in a soothing voice as he guided the both of them in the general direction of Diagon Alley.
‘Heat not over yet, then,’ Harry decided softly. ‘Let me take care of you…’ His hand slid across Draco’s stomach, rubbing his cock gently back into hardness. Draco moaned, ‘hey, hey, I thought we just established we barely know each other, what right do you – hmww – have to do that?’
“Romantic, sure,” Draco chuckled. “I’m not opposed to it, but we have plenty of time.” He bent down a little to kiss Harry. “We don’t have to do everything at once. I’m not going to leave you in any case.”
The next morning, in the safety of his own room, he decided to take a look at the answer Mrs Weasley had provided him with. She’d written a long, informative letter in which she answered all his questions.
Draco studied Harry as he talked to Mrs Weasley. He found that Harry kept glancing at Draco, as if he was nervous or concerned.
‘I won’t.’ It had felt a bit like an order, so Draco tried to obey. The need to submit, to show his Alpha how good he was, how obedient, burned inside him and this half-assed order wasn’t enough to sate that specific need.
Harry hummed, wrapped an arm around his mate and walked them to their bedroom. With their last few steps, Draco stepped to the side, making sure they ended up in front of his nest room. If Harry noticed, he didn’t show it. Instead, he followed Draco in, taking off his shoes and taking in the new layout of the room. Draco had painted the walls a sky blue, the ground bed was pushed into a corner, decked out with blankets and pillows. He turned on the radio, and as the soft tunes of piano music filled the room, he pushed Harry towards his nest.
Draco let him, placing his hand not-so-subtly on his stomach to confirm the suspicion Harry now would have.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Draco murmured. “That was a lot of noise, wasn’t it?” He kept crawling closer and closer. “It can be too much, so many people… I hate it too.” He was now close enough to place his hand over one of the other man’s hands, and carefully did so. “Let’s breathe together for a while, okay?” He breathed in through his nose deliberately, counting to seven under his breath, holding for three seconds and then releasing his breath in a controlled way. It took the other man a few repeats before he could follow along, but his breathing evened out, and that was all Draco was trying to do. He moved over a little, so that he was sitting next to the other Omega, and carefully placed an arm around him. Instead of closing his arm around him, he let his hand rest against the floor so that the other was free to flee if he wanted to.
‘Certainly, my King,’ she chuckled and she waved her wand, conjuring coffee from the tip of it and pouring it into one of the tea cups, which she transfigured into an elegant coffee cup. ‘Would you like to read yourself, or should I read you something? And from which paper?’
‘That’s good,’ Harry said. ‘I’ve missed you, you know. This “not allowed to have contact while waiting for the papers” sucked.’
What will happen next? How hurt is Draco? Will he and Adelaide stay at Grimmauld Place anyway, or will they leave? What about the abuse cases?
He was hardly aware of what he was doing, of Harry’s eyes on his hand placement, riding his mate with abandon. Seconds before he felt his release coming, he shifted his hand down, fisting his own cock and moaning as he came.
In all honesty, Draco did not feel ready to take his babies outside. But he also knew he could not keep them confined to their home forever, and going for a walk would be good for them, and for himself. Even if it did feel like walking into a warzone.
His mother smiled again – it was so, so fake to Draco – and left to room, closing the door with a soft click.
Draco hastily obeyed, lying on the bed, flat on his back, staring at the ceiling. He could hear the soft clink of a belt being undone, and then the sound of a zipper. He moaned in anticipation.
“I can take them for a little stroll around the water,” Remus suggested, pointing at the small pond that was across from them. “You’ll be able to see us the entire time.”
Luckily, he didn’t have to wait for long. A soft knock – definitely his mother’s – on the door announced their arrival. For a moment, he panicked. No-one was here with him and he wasn’t allowed to speak if he hadn’t been given explicit permission to do so.
‘Can I just say you two are the most adorable couple I’ve ever seen?’ An elderly lady had stepped closer and smiled at them. Draco blushed and looked at the floor. ‘Thank you.’
“I had not expected it to be so much more intense than your regular heats,” Harry quietly agreed. “I now see why they were so adamant about the two weeks rest between inducing another heat.” His fingers brushed over Draco’s spine, feeling the bone protruding more than before. “You’ll need some time to recover….”  his voice softened even more, trying to hide the worry, “... to gain some weight, too.”
to be an Alpha, and the same goes for Ginny. I've always felt that Ron was more of a follower than a leader, therefore the choice to make him a Beta.
‘Quite so, yes,’ Harry agreed. ‘Well then, shall we inspect the spaces areas in which Astoria spends her time?’
“I’m going, are you sure you don’t want me to bring you to the Burrow?” Harry wrapped his arm gently around Draco and kissed him quickly.
Hermione cleared her throat. ‘I told Ron to take his sister with him and spend some time with their parents. They barely visit them…’
Draco looked at Harry, unsure of how to start, when Harry said: “I feel awful.”         Hermione nodded lightly. “And why is that?”
Draco sighed out of relief, happy that his Alpha had ordered him to do something. He got into the bathtub and sighed again, this time because the need dwindled a bit, giving him a more calm state of mind. He was still aroused and could feel his hole slick up, but it was better than before.
“Yes right now! The book is probably in the office, I’ll go get it.” Draco immediately got to it, leaving their room and dashing to the office. The book was right where he expected it to be, thanks to Hermione’s clever organisation system of the office library. With the book firmly in his grip, he quickly ran back again, only to find their bedroom door closed. He gave it a push, experimentally, but it didn’t budge. “Harry?”
Harry graciously never mentioned it, humming to himself as he finished dinner and plated up two bowls for them.
The walk to breakfast was a long one. Draco felt sick and shaky from his father’s treatment and not up to whatever was today’s schedule. He was about halfway the route, when he felt so sick and tired he had to sit down. There where to chairs of benches near, so he leaned against the wall and slid down. He pulled up his knees, wrapped his arms around them and rested his head against his little nest.
Draco hesitated for a little bit. ‘No, but if you see anything about… Harry Potter… I’m interested?’
They were quiet for a while, until Hermione broke their silence. “Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?”
He dreamed about it day and night, fantasizing about a little baby boy with Harry’s dark hair and eyes, but Draco’s slender build, or maybe a chubby little girl with Harry’s fierce eyes and Draco’s light, silvery hair or…
“Morning, love,” Harry responded, coming into the kitchen and kissing Draco’s cheek. He let his hand slide over Draco’s ribs, to his stomach, and murmured, “hello to you too, baby.” It made Draco smile, and he turned, curling himself in Harry’s arms. “How was the meeting?”
He found himself craving for Harry’s presence more and more, practically jumping at the Alpha when he came home.
‘Draco, darling, Mr Potter has an usual request to make.’ His mother looked at him sternly and Draco smiled innocently at her. ‘I’ll do whatever you want me to.’ He honestly didn’t put the soft, attractive vibe in his voice on purpose, but whenever he spoke such obedient words he somehow felt… more real. More like a real person. It made him want to purr out his words.
As if that had been the unspoken cue, the room erupted in sound. He could see the shaggy man and his guard flee into the kitchen and he let go of Harry’s hand to follow them. Harry tried to pull him back, and Draco murmured, “too much noise,” before slipping away.
Draco felt his lips curl up in a faint smile. Having only met Hermione a few times, he had the idea that she didn’t often forget things like that.
“It’s always like this,” Remus said, “even the heat rooms are… well, not heated. Nothing here is made for comfort.” He flashed his wrist to the last guard they had to pass to the meeting room, and Draco did the same. The intense, matte black still looked and felt unfamiliar and strange to him, especially because it only appeared when needed. He had never signed a magical contract before.
A warm hand on his back drew him away from his thoughts. He blinked and looked at Harry, who was smiling a light, kind smile. “Shall we go?” They’d booked a last minute room at the Shepherd's Inn, a wizarding establishment downtown, to celebrate the good news. It was high time they finally explored the city they so frequently visited.
“It would be a lot easier if you just took it, you know,”  Adelaide commented. “The longer you wait, the more you’ll torture yourself.”
‘You like the idea of knocking me up,’ Draco teased. ‘I had no idea you had such… hmmm, what shall we call it… kinks.’
Harry kept Draco close to him, and he kept away from the couple, far enough that Draco couldn’t smell them or guess if they were Alphas or not.
Draco was nervous. They both were, he could feel through the bond. But aside from the nervous butterflies in his stomach, he was excited. He couldn’t wait to carry Harry’s children.
He was silenced by Harry’s lips pressing firmly against his own and he opened his mouth, embracing Harry’s rough kiss and sighing a little because of how good it felt to have his Alpha claim him like that.
Lupin coughed, then straightened out his spine, shoulders and wrists with a few audible cracks and pops of his joints. “It must be the official reply from the ORO,” he said. Draco wasn’t sure if he’d said it for his sake, or just to give his voice something to do. It didn’t matter anyway. Lupin took the letter, broke the seal, and let his eyes slide over the words neatly written on parchment with what Draco didn’t doubt would be the signature dark purple ink the ORO used for all its communication. With a sigh, Lupin folded the letter closed again, and placed it back on the table. He pressed his thumb and index finger against his forehead, pressing his temples together before slipping his fingers over his nose, which he pinched in obvious frustration. His eyes were closed, too tight to be comfortable. He exhaled a shaky, defeated breath.
‘Hi there,’ he greeted them. They all looked up. ‘So I heard that you won’t let other kids go on the swing,’ he tentatively started, ‘which isn’t very nice.’
He wandered into the “myths/fables” section and picked out a book titled “The originals”, which contained stories about the supposed first-ever wizards to find out about their second gender. “Suitable for children” it stated on the back.
They set into motion simultaneously, following her down the familiar hallway and into Healer Roberts’ office. This was a well-practised routine by now, and Healer Roberts forewent formalities, immediately diving into it. “How are you doing?” Her eyes slid over both of them.
“Me too.” He set the glass of water down for Lupin and took the chair next to him. “Honestly, my instincts are on overtime right now,” Draco added with a low chuckle.
He pushed the blankets of his body and sat up slowly. The sour taste of vomit was still very apparent in his mouth and he reeked of it as well. He despised it. It made him feel like he was actually some worthless bitch, even though he knew he wasn’t.
‘Adelaide won’t be joining us when we look around, as there will be much stair-walking involved and that is not advisable for a pregnant women,’ Harry said smoothly, making Draco raise his eyebrows even more.
Armed with some money, bags and a shopping list, Draco and Lupin stepped out of Grimmauld place. Harry had been called into work early in the morning, and he’d sent a message an hour ago saying he’d be held up in the office all day. Draco had taken the chance to go out with Lupin, knowing Harry would’ve protested it if he’d been at home.
Everywhere across the floor there were lovely nooks and crannies where one could retreat with a book once they’d found something good. The whole atmosphere made Draco feel like he was welcome, and made him forget about feeling awkward when asking employees what books they’d recommend or looking at sections that weren’t really meant for Omegas.
Draco kept a few feet away, but placed himself in clear sight of the man. The woman growled, and it amplified the man’s uneven, panicked breathing.
So when Mrs Weasley sat down and looked at him expectantly, he drew in a deep breath and dropped the bomb, ‘I think I’m ready to bond with Harry.’
“Where do you want my clothes?” his voice a little raspy, his eyes still alert. Draco glanced around the room and shrugged. “Anywhere,” which seemed to be the magic word, because he’d never seen Harry get naked as fast as he did then. He could barely blink before he felt Harry’s warm body press up against his, and let out a soft noise of happiness. “I love you,” he whispered quietly, more feeling Harry’s low reply through the rumble in his chest then hearing it.
‘Do people often do that?’ Draco asked, ‘and why did she say that about not being able to… you know.’
going to go into detail when it comes to abuse, noncon or (as some like to put it) rape. That would cross my personal boundaries. So be assured, that even when such things are hinted or mentioned, it will not be something I am going to describe in detail. Sometimes, it will be mentioned though. After all, one of the main things in this story
,’ he begged again, whilst trying to bare his neck even more and at the same time moving his hips, trying to fuck himself on Harry’s fingers, that had stilled.
Draco pulled Harry back, using a strength he had no idea he had. ‘Bite me first, please.’ He pushed his head back, baring his throat for Harry in a wordless plea for the bonding bite.
“I found my advocates,” Remus announced in a quiet, but victorious voice. “Please meet Sirius’ aunt, Andromeda Tonks.”
Harry laughed and the warm sound washed over Draco, making him feel safe and treasured. ‘Don’t worry, Draco, those are not real people. I didn’t trap anyone in there, okay?’
In a bit of a daze, he found his way to the kitchen to make tea, only noticing Lupin occupying the kitchen table with a notebook and several thick books from their library opened when he turned to grab the kettle from the table.
“It’s amazing you managed to stay together,” Draco loaded up his paint roller again, turning to the last wall they had to paint. “That must’ve required a lot of determination.”
Draco nodded and she tapped her wand at each book. “Now to anyone, including you, they’ll seem like ordinary household books. When you open them, they’re the books you bought.” She wrapped the books in brown paper and put them in a paper bag. “Thank you for your purchase.”
‘Yeah, I like him too. Our parents used to be friends, y’know? Grandma babysat the both of us together all the time when our parents were out and about for the Order.’
As the days passed by, Draco grew more and more restless. Saying goodbye to Harry every morning was horrible and the fact that he sometimes went out on missions that took more than a day, making the Alpha absent from Draco’s life for sometimes two or three days, was terrifying. Sometimes he even had nightmares about Harry leaving him for such a mission. The thought that his Alpha might die in action –
“Thank you.” Draco stepped into Harry’s embrace, rubbing his cheek gently against Harry’s, needing to affirm their bond after their argument.
Draco closed his eyes again briefly in bliss, breathing out shakily. Harry loosened his grip on Draco’s hips a little, and licked over the bloody mess he’d made of Draco’s throat, making his mate moan weakly, and his cock rise again.
“Draco’s pregnant.” Remus’ tone had an edge, as if someone had sharpened a blade over his vocal chords, and it had left a hard-to-heal wound.
Draco bit his lower lip. It wasn’t really a problem, because, of course he had nothing to do and, of course he wanted to do something fun with Harry, but… ‘It’s just that Adelaide is going to St Mungo’s today for a check-up and I… I could come.’ Draco was really curious about Adelaide’s pregnancy, mostly because he’d never seen all of it from up close. Mrs Weasley also thought it was good for Draco to see how everything would go.
“It’s not there. I’ll sign it. I’ll come with you,” Draco repeated. “There’s no frequency limitation either. You could visit him daily.”
Harry backed up, pushing Draco back to the living room until they had both stepped over the threshold. He raised his wand again, making eye contact with Remus, who was still kneeling on the kitchen floor and cradling Sirius’ head. “I’m sealing the kitchen. He’ll wake up within an hour.”
After the visit, Remus retreated to his room and Draco headed up the stairs, to Harry’s office. He entered quietly, and upon seeing Harry bent over yet more paperwork, he joined his mate at his desk, planting himself on Harry’s lap. “Hey,” he said.
Adelaide seemed a bit giddy as well, as she had just provided Draco with a detailed description of how she slept with both Molly and Arthur.
“Yeah, I know…” Harry casted his eyes downwards before looking at his mate again. “My parents were both bonded and married. I… don’t know, it seems… romantic?”
“I remember you like it rough,” Adelaide teased and Draco felt the blood speed to his cheeks, colouring them in an instant.
The Omega complied easily, only moving his hips a little bit so that Harry hit his prostate every time he thrust in. ‘Harry… Harry… Harryyy…’ he moaned, ‘more, I need more, please…’
“Hungry,” Draco said with a chuckle. “Now that I’m not vomiting all the time, I’m hungry constantly. Mostly salty cravings.”
‘Very well. Now sit.’ She sat down at her desk. He pulled out his chair and, for the third time this morning, tried to sit down in the dainty way everyone wanted him to.
And used that smile and even made to show his neck! That horrible, horrible man can never come near our boy again. EVER!’
Draco shrugged, not wanting to dispute him. Mr Potter sighed and placed his hand on Draco’s knee. ‘It’s okay to say what you think, Draco. I won’t be angry with you and I won’t hurt you. Molly’d have my head if I ever would.’
‘Yes, yes, I got your letter, you’re here for my grandson, no use to flatter me like that,’ she said, pointing towards the garden, ‘he’s in there.’
Draco walked over to the swings where a group of boys stood. They were a bit older, he guessed that they were nine or maybe ten. Emma was about six, he estimated.
“Can we take these too? They roar!” He held one of them out to Harry, who took it from his hands and laughed when the plushie roared at him. “Sure. Just pick two.”
friends these days. I don’t know why she said that, because she gave me the impression that she was fine with us not being together anymore and me courting you.’
‘As the letter that has been send to you a few days ago, I am here to make sure that Astoria is being treated well and lives in an environment that is suitable for her situation. As mentioned, I would like to inspect her living quarters and talk with her for a little while in a private setting.’
“Almost twenty-five,” Draco murmured. “But I’ve been on heat suppressants from my fifteenth until I met Harry so... seven years...”
‘One did mention that some people quit their job after that,’ Harry nodded, ‘and that the bar was raised from
Draco nodded and let go of Harry a bit, so that his feet his the ground. He wavered, his jelly-legs barely able to support him. Harry held onto him with one hand and used the other to undo the buttons on Draco’s pyjama top. ‘You are never wearing these inconvenient things again,’ Harry murmured.
Draco turned his head sideways, whining, ‘please…’ He pushed himself up on all fours, presenting his leaking arse to Harry
She smiled at him and he got up, pushing Mr Weasley out of the way and hugging his childhood friend tightly. Instantly, he felt a small bump pushing against his stomach and gasped. ‘Adelaide you’re…’
“Potter,” Remus mumbled, sounding drunk. He pawed weakly at Sirius, trying to get him to come closer.
Victoria and Elizabeth were crying when Draco held them close to his chest, both at the same time, and he gently rocked them. They still smelled like him. It was a relief to him to realise that. His babies were still just that -
So how was it? Are you happy that Harry offered to court Draco properly? Or were you hoping it would come to bonding immediately?
‘I don’t want to be the victim anymore.’ It sounded weak so he repeated, ‘I don’t want to be the victim anymore. So don’t treat me like one.’
Draco stepped forwards and into Harry’s arms. “Oh, Harry.”  He pecked his Alpha on the cheek. “I love it.”
Mr Potter gasped for breath, making Draco look up at him again. Mr Potter was furious and Draco cringed, afraid the Alpha would hurt him.
Muscles moved without him wanting to and he rolled over on his stomach as last night’s events slowly trickled back into his mind.
‘Yes… When I was younger I did hope to be claimed, bonded… just like you… But that… It was just a dream. I don’t think my parents were planning on ever allowing anyone to have me. Father always kept saying they were saving me for someone but I don’t know who. Whoever it is, thought, he never claimed me.’
Remus was a great companion, though. He was kind, and patient, and completely chill about the whole ordeal - which could not be said of Harry, who was even more freaked out about leaving the home with their children than Draco was. That was the reason why he wasn’t the one accompanying Draco right now.
Lupin did most of the hard work, clearing out the furniture and ripping up the carpet of the small room Draco had chosen for the nursery. It was attached to his nest room, so he could go from his nest to the nursery without issues, but there was also an access door in the hallway. The nursery only needed the essentials - Draco anticipated he would spend more time with their babies in his nest than in the nursery.
‘Hi Hermione.’ Draco pecked her on the cheek and sat down. It was starting to become a normal thing for Harry to drop him off at Hermione’s office at the ORO, while Harry went to work in the Auror office. Their shared office at Grimmauld Place was rarely used now that Harry had returned to the Auror office. Hermione started before Harry started so she left the house early, usually with Ron, whilst Draco and Harry got up later.
“I was fertile and above all, we were a straight couple,” Adelaide said in a soothing voice, “you know how it’s always harder for two men to conceive.”
Like the title indicated, the net is closing... I haven't finished writing yet, but I've decided the last plot bits. I had originally hoped for 20 chapters total, but looking at my plans now, it might become a little more.
In the meantime, negotiations for Sirius had started, and Remus and his team - consisting of Hermione and Andromeda - had taken over the kitchen pretty much permanently.
He didn’t mind. He found himself enjoying Harry’s company more and more, looking forward to the light touches Harry managed to slip in whenever they stood close. Sometimes Harry managed to steal a kiss er two when Hermione wasn’t near.
At first, Victoria and Elizabeth were fine. But after a few minutes of sitting still, they became fussy. First Victoria, but quickly followed by Elizabeth. Draco didn’t feel ready yet to keep walking or go home, and bit his lip nervously.
lie to get his way, but… ‘No…’ he said reluctantly, ‘I just… If you’d rather have me go back downstairs then I…’
Hermione sighed. ‘I understand that, especially due to your past, you are sensitive to situations like these, but you haven’t given Harry the chance to explain anything.’
“She likes mothering over others. But since they’re a safe house, most of the people she meets eventually move away again. I think that’s why she doesn’t share much personal information.” With soft, soothing motions, Harry let his fingers slide through Draco’s hair, following its path down Draco’s spine. Draco relaxed into his touch. “I can’t wait until we have our own little one to panic over.”
Draco shook his head. “I talked to Adelaide about it and she said that she’s never experienced a need like I have.” He reluctantly added, “do you think it’s maybe the aftermath of… the abuse?” Even thinking about how he had been treated before made him feel sick.
He could hear the door creak, and then soft, careful footsteps into the room. “I made tea…” Harry said in a quiet, low voice. Draco pushed himself upright and groaned when electrical jolts of pain shot through his abdomen, hips, lower back and arse. “Fuck,” he managed, immediately out of breath.
Harry sat up a bit more, adopting what Draco had come to recognise as his “serious posture”. ‘Alright, tell me.’
Draco looked at his mother, hoping he could find a trace of emotion, of a sign that she was glad to see him... anything.
“I’m not sure,” Harry said, wiping a hand over his face and making an attempt at blinking away his tiredness. “He needs someone to oversee the negotiations and advocate for him. I applied for it, but my request was denied. We need to find someone to do it as soon as we can.”
At first it seemed a bit weird, but then he saw how his memory-self all but disappear in Harry’s embrace and somehow understood that that was what he had needed.
“On the streets?” Draco guessed, even though the thought made him cringe. An Omega should never live alone on the streets.
‘Oh.’ Draco patted his pocked absentmindedly, feeling only a few coins in there. Mrs Weasley had given him a some money, but it was just about enough for a book at Crossroads, which was the second hand book store, which was on the intersection between Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley. She had taken him there twice so far and it had been lovely.
‘I didn’t just leave her to court you.’ Harry drew in a deep breath and continued, ‘whatever Ginny and I had, it never really worked and me meeting you was what made it very clear to me that I didn’t want to be with her anymore. After visiting you at the manor Ginny and I talked about it and we broke up amicably. She doesn’t have any other place to live so we agreed that me could move to the fourth floor and that was it.’
A knock on the door, immediately followed by, ‘Astoria, Mr Potter would like to talk to you for a little while. Please be truthful when answering his questions.’
“It would be-” Harry abruptly ended his sentence, fixating his gaze on Draco and breathing in through his nose deliberately. He blinked, then let his gaze slide over his mate.
They arrived at the clinic via the floo and were welcomed by a friendly, smiling beta women. She introduced herself as “Bella, pleased to meet you!” Draco immediately liked her warm, bubbly personality. Harry shook her hand and Draco bowed graciously for her. Bella bowed back and led them through the corridors which were, other than in St Mungo’s, painted a sunny yellow and adorned with paintings, cards and other handicrafts. Bella chatted cheerily, although Draco wasn’t really listening; he counted on Harry to do that for him.
“Can we teach this one to not call me mommy?” Draco asked, although he knew it was most likely a lost cause.
Draco buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, murmuring, “I’m glad you’re home… safe…” but by that time, Harry was already asleep.
He still wasn’t pregnant. It wasn’t like he and Harry had been actively trying and he hadn’t gone into heat after their bonding, but still… He’d expected… something, especially since last time he’d felt that small bump. It had disappeared a few days after his heat though, leaving him feeling empty and craving.
He got dressed as quick as he could. When he put the trousers on, something white came rolling out of them. He bent forward and picked it up. It was a pair of soft, white, frilly lace socks.
Draco fidgeted with the edges of the parchment in his journal, took a deep breath and opened the booklet on the right page. “Okay so… ahm… Here’s what I wrote…” He drew in another deep breath. “Alpha-Omega bonds can be quite different from one another, but in general there are three categories. A basic bond, in which the couple has bonded during a heat and in which no other symptoms occur. A grade one bond, is one where the above has happened, but with the addition that the Alpha can feel snippets of the Omega’s emotions and/or feelings. This type of bond is most common. More special is the grade O bond, in which both the Alpha and the Omega can sense each other’s emotion and/or feelings and in special cases, there is something called the grade O-S bond,  where both can sense where their mate is and sometimes communicate basic needs through the bond.” He flipped the page and looked at Hermione expectantly.
“I’m pregnant.” Throwing the words out felt like such a relief, and his shoulders slumped down, the tension in his neck and back suddenly gone.
“I like Hermione too, you know. I don’t mind. And I’m sure she won’t mind either.”  Harry stepped closer and took the scarf from Draco’s hand. “If you want something from Adelaide or Molly, I could ask them for you. If you don’t want to.”
‘I can understand that, Harry never speaks of it anymore,’ Mrs Weasley said reasonably. ‘But why did you fight about that?’
Harry had gotten another six weeks off from work. A month extension to his leave of absence, and two weeks after that because Draco’s heat was due right at the end of Harry’s leave of absence, at the beginning of March.
, especially because he had the same response when Harry tried to leave the narrow room to let Draco work on his own.
“Sorry, does it hurt?” Harry sounded hoarse when he asked. Draco shook his head ever so lightly in a negative answer, even though he knew that Harry would immediately know it was a lie.
I considered doing the memories as if Draco stood in Harry's spot and then maybe write them in italics, but that gave little space for Draco's own observations, and I remembered that in the Goblet of Fire (the film, at least) the pensieve offers a sort of third-person-view, so I decided to do that here as well.
‘All taken care of,’ Harry answered, pressing his lips to Draco’s pulse point again and at the same time spelling away the remainder of both their pyjamas.
Lupin’s eyes darted around the room, before settling on the floor before Draco. It was to confirm Draco’s dominance over the situation, and it made Draco feel uncomfortable. Lupin was almost twice his age - there was no reason for him to try and placate Draco.
Draco shrugged.  “I don’t know, but I don’t mind.” He hadn’t really told Harry about how often he visited the Burrow, not to see Adelaide or Molly, but to see the little baby. Harry had just assumed he missed Adelaide and Molly, and never asked.
‘I’ll give you a few minutes to get dressed. I’ll be right outside waiting for you.’ She stepped out of the room quickly.
“Draco,” Harry responded, sounding nervous. He coughed, looked away awkwardly and then at Draco again, finally saying, “Draco, we need to talk.”
Harry closed his eyes and drew a deep breath, ‘it’s my body, trying to pump as much seed into as it can. To make sure you get pregnant.’ He sounded so embarrassed that Draco kept his mouth shut for a while, and then dared to ask, ‘can I? Get pregnant, I mean?’
“Ministry holding cell,” Remus replied. “They’re not moving him until negotiations are finalised. So he’ll stay there until they’ve decided where he’s going.”
“I’ve been thinking of the same thing,” Draco admitted. “If you want to go back to work, I think you should. Even though it makes me nervous and I’d rather have you at home.”
“I’m sorry I never told you anything,” Draco quietly began, “it wasn’t out of distrust, it was... I thought... I wanted to figure everything out myself first, before burdening you with it.”
Harry conjured a magical shield in front of them and kept Draco behind him. His sharp eyes analysed the situation, and he strategically let spells of his own fire into the chaos.
“Can we go see Adelaide?” Draco turned in Harry’s arms, facing him and analysing the look on his face.
Mr Potter looked away from Draco and offered Draco’s mother his hand. ‘Certainly, Mrs Malfoy. Thank you for having me. I understand that it is hard to let anyone near someone as sensitive as your son during these difficult times.’
Draco moved a little closer to his Alpha and felt Harry’s arm slip around his waist. “You know now,” he said softly, carefully.
She had red hair, just like Mrs Weasley’s, and a friendly smile. It still had sharp edge though, and the Alpha aura was unmistakeable.
“Not just soon. Now!” Harry’s out of breath voice reached Draco’s ears before he could see his mate. “Hey baby.” Harry touched Draco’s shoulder and then grabbed his hand. “I’m here.”
She made a delightful noise and smiled at him again. ‘And so sensitive too, honey, isn’t that great? Hmmm, such a good boy…’
Three days later, the files had arrived at Grimmauld Place. In the meantime, Draco had been cooped up inside the Burrow. But this morning, Harry had picked him up and he was nervous, waiting for the right moment to tell Harry he was ready.
“Well, that’s true, of course, but in a twin pregnancy, everything can be so much more exhausting. It’s okay to rest multiple times a day. Energy peaks and dips are part of the deal now.” She relocated her gaze to Harry for a second, then back to Draco. “Don’t push yourself because you think you should be able to do something. Your mate can take care of things you can’t do anymore.”
‘I think it’s just regular arousal,’ Harry commented calmly, still grazing over Draco’s soft spot. ‘But don’t worry, I’ll gladly take care of that as well.’
“Ah.” Hermione organised the papers on her desk and flipped open her notepad. “Well, go on then. I’ll be listening.”
Remus’ reaction time had slowed, half dizzy from his mate’s touch, but he managed to snag the lighter from Sirius before he could light a cigarette. “You can’t smoke here.”
‘… no other way…?’ That was definitely his mother. Draco could practically hear the flirtatious offer that was in there and wondered if she honestly tried to seduce a Ministry official. All officials that were send to visit Omegas where usually well taken care of, so as not to tempt them, therefore he thought that trying to seduce one was definitely a long shot.
“We’ll contact Sunny Springs if this persists,” Hermione decided, her tone leaving no space for protest.
‘We’ll see about that.’ Draco was determined not to let Harry touch him any more than was absolutely needed. It was not his aim to turn himself into a lunatic by refusing the Alpha touch he needed. But it felt like losing, allowing Harry to touch him, however much he needed it. He was still angry with Harry and this stupid heat was not going to get in the way of his anger.
Hermione reached across the table and took one of his hands. ‘Draco, this… I…’ She drew in a deep breath, ‘I could talk to Harry for you and see what he has to say about this. If he does not deny, or even confirm what you told me, I think you should try to build a case against him. Because what you described to me is most definitely abuse.’
Draco sniffed up her comforting, motherly scent. It made him feel calmer and more adept at taking decisions. ‘I… I think I want to talk about it with… Hermione.’
Adelaide came over Friday evening, carrying Alexander in one of those front-carriers and it looked like such a fun and intimate way to carry your child around that Draco felt a sort of second-hand disappointment when she started undoing it.
Bella handed them their teas and left quickly. Healer Roberts sat down and studied Harry and Draco in silence. Draco looked back at her and sipped from his tea. He subtly attempted to sniff up the air but the peppermint smell was too dominating for him to be able to diffuse any of the smells other than peppermint and Harry. The combination was a very calming one though and soon he found himself leaning back into the settee more and making himself comfortable.
By day three, they came to the amicable solution of Harry just lounging around and reading, while Draco did whatever he wanted to do.
So I'm not 100% satisfied with this chapter (do you see a trend here? Because I do), but I feel it fits the overall story well, and thought it was about time we returned to Harry and Draco a bit more.
The other men took two large steps forwards and hugged Draco tightly, making Draco cough, ‘too tight, Blaise,’ and at the same time, Harry, ‘please let go of my Omega,’ whilst Miss Parkinson made a sound of disapproval.
Harry sat down stiffly, ‘I had no idea teachers here were that close with their students.’ It sounded stiff and Draco briefly wondered if Harry was jealous.
Draco felt relieved to have both arms occupied with the child, for he knew he would’ve rubbed his empty stomach otherwise. “We’re fine.”
‘I’d like to take a look around the school and speak with some of the teachers that have taught Draco,’ Harry started, ‘and we would like to visit the day-care as well.’
Harry’s hand slid over Draco’s arse, squeezing every now and then. ‘Probably the last bits of heat leaving your body, it’ll be fine.’
Draco leaned back a little so he could look at Harry’s face. “You do realise it won’t legally matter?”
Back at Grimmauld Place, Draco set out to do the chores he always pushed ahead because he disliked them so much. He did the laundry and hung it out in the garden to dry, after which he did some garden work and prepared dinner.
‘Yes, sir,’ Draco said tensely. He didn’t want to get into trouble for breaking Ministry rules, or breaking his father’s rules so he tried to speak as little as he could.
Draco stiffly undressed, eyes firmly on his Alpha’s face to see if he was doing it right, to see if this was what he needed to do.
Living at Grimmauld Place was not as difficult as Draco had thought it would be, mostly because Ginny had moved out. He’d asked Harry about it, who had shrugged, “I didn’t want her here anymore. It’s my house, so she left”.
Due to someone noting that I should spend some more time on editing/grammar/spelling, I spend a lot more time in this chapter. I hope that is something you can notice.
Instead of deigning the stranger with a response, he gathered whatever spit he had left in his mouth, and spat the man in his face. “Fuck you,” he added, matching the coldness of the stranger’s tone.
But the damage was done already. Draco had retreated from Harry’s grip and stepped back, towards the stairs. Hermione grabbed him by the arm.
Sirius dropped the hand holding the cigarette, letting it fall into his lap, taking Draco in with new eyes. Draco let the side of his cape slide open, and placed a hand on his stomach as he mumbled, “twenty-four weeks now. We’re having twins.” When he saw Sirius look at his neck, he pulled down the collar of his shirt so that he could see the bond mark - Harry had opened it minutes before they left, and it was red, swollen and looked fresh.
Draco let out a small sigh of relief once he felt Harry enter once more, with strong, deep strokes. “... Alpha…” it was but a whisper, and mostly out of enjoyment, not a plea.
Draco slowly got back up and swung his legs over the edge of the treatment table. “I have been feeling really tired,” he admitted. “But I thought that was because pregnancies are always harder for male Omegas.”
Lupin and Draco accompanied Harry to the Ministry by floo. When they arrived, Harry patted the soot off Draco. Lupin looked at them, saying nothing.
go against a no-kill order, only to slay one of the most feared villains in wizarding history, whilst managing to keep a Ministry job. That’s awe-inspiring.” Draco plated them both dinner and placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder for a second as he passed by his mate, before sitting down across him at the table.
“Safe at home with Ron and Remus,” Harry said in a low, soothing tone. He forced a purr from his chest, trying to help Draco relax a little. “They missed their mommy.”
‘I… I think…’ he didn’t want to say anything offensive, since she had taken care of him and was so nice, ‘I think I’m ready to… get out of bed and… just a little while...’
Harry drew in a deep breath. “I guess we’ll have to try again in two weeks.” It was a statement void of any emotion.
“I’m not sure.” Lupin’s voice was low, and he seemed seconds away from disappearing into himself again, crawling into his protective shell, shutting out the world completely.
“And about pregnancies?” She sounded rather detached and that helped Draco push his embarrassment and his awkward feelings about that subject away, and dryly read his notes on that out loud as well. “Male Omega pregnancies are rare due to an array of facts. Firstly, while male Omegas have the capacity to carry children, their body wasn’t originally made for such a task. Next to that, in order to successfully and without assistance conceive, both the Omega and Alpha need to have a strong magical core. Most advisable is that they at least have a grade O bond. Even if the couple successfully conceives, most male Omega bodies don’t adapt to the pregnancy well.” Draco stopped there, looking at Hermione. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for when he looked at her – compassion? Empathy?
Draco slipped out of Harry’s embrace quickly and grabbed Adelaide’s hand. ‘We understand. Come on, Adelaide.’ They left the kitchen quickly, leaving Harry to discuss matters with Molly, as was the standard when steps like these were taken in courtship.
Lupin was ready to talk when he’d been staying at Grimmauld Place for four weeks. He gripped his mug of tea a little harder than usual as he joined Draco at the kitchen table for breakfast. Harry was already out for his morning meeting, and had foregone breakfast - as usual.
Hermione calmed down. ‘That’s all right, Draco. I’m just… I have some strong opinions on the matter that not everyone shares with me.’
Harry reached across the table to touch Draco’s hand, letting his rest on top of Draco’s. The physical contact comforted him, and, too tired to think about it anymore, Draco let the thought of Harry returning to work go for now.
“Healer Roberts will be with you soon.” Bella’s tone was chipper as always. “She’ll see how far you are along, and the most likely scenario is that we’ll still be able to deliver your babies via c-section.”
Fingers slowly trailed down and Harry hummed in surprise and satisfaction when he felt Draco required very little prep. “You must be in pre-heat already,” he mumbled before Draco caught his lips again, this time in a more demanding kiss. He moaned under Harry’s touch and spread his legs further to accommodate his partner. Harry had different plans, however, as he flipped them over, allowing Draco lay on top. He laughed hoarsely, leaning down to kiss Harry again and moving his hips down a little, taking in Harry slowly. They both moaned.
Adelaide handed him the grapes and he ate some. ‘I’m sorry that this happened…’ he muttered whilst eating.
It only took Harry a few minutes to come, and when he let go of Draco and rolled onto his back, Draco commented, “you have shit stamina.”
Draco stood up and tossed the test, not wanting to look at it any longer. He sucked in a deep, deliberate breath, steadying himself against the kitchen counter. “Let’s go get ice cream at Fortescue’s.” The words meant nothing, the emotion behind it, carefully hidden sadness, disappointment, the physical tiredness and soreness he still felt, were conveyed through their bond.
Draco closed his eyes and breathed out slowly, trying to ignore both his frustration and the pain. Some time passed, but it was hard for him to tell how much. The room around him was quiet.
Back in the Weasley kitchen, Draco needed a few minutes to re-orientate himself. In the meantime, Harry retracted his memory from the pensieve and readied the next one.
‘I’ve got him in a few files.’ Draco looked at Harry, sniffing up the air, trying to see if he could pick up on his emotions like that. His ability to scent emotions was slowly improving now that he was not taking suppressants anymore, but it was still hard to discern the scents and recognise emotions. ‘Do you know him? Who is he?’
It took exactly five weeks for the morning sickness to start, and it didn’t happen in the morning at all - it happened at night. Harry was cooking up some curry, and as Draco entered the kitchen, he almost immediately turned around, making it to the toilet just in time.
‘I don’t want it,’ Draco articulated even though he felt himself getting wetter with the minute, the need growing.
‘You can’t possibly be comfortable like that,’ Harry gently argued. ‘Come on, Draco, it’s time to shower and wash yourself. You can’t stay like this forever.’
“He remains such a mystery…” Draco managed, feeling the pull of sleep making him slow and drowsy under Harry’s soothing touches. Harry answered something, but Draco couldn’t make it out before sleep took him.
“Okay,” Draco murmured to himself, adjusting the sunshade on the stroller one more time. “Okay. Let’s go.”
The rainbow woman was kneeled beside him, instructing him through a breathing exercise. It didn’t help much. The man’s breathing became even more uneven and laboured.
‘What?’ Harry laughed sleepily, ‘you know I can’t.’ He slowly let go of Draco, pushing himself up and yawning. ‘We’ve got this new case and I feel we’re close to cracking it.’
Draco laughed and pulled back a little, “you’ll have to wait a little while longer, dinner’s just ready.” He slid free from Harry’s not-so tight embrace and prodded the potatoes with a fork. “Yes, I think it’s ready.”
Draco cowered away from Mrs Weasley, ‘please don’t hurt me,’ he squeaked, afraid that she might do things like that, too.
“Please try,” Sirius said, gripping Remus tighter and pulling him closer. Remus closed his eyes and let Sirius arrange his limbs however he wanted.
Harry shifted in his seat and Draco almost immediately scooted closer to Harry, grabbing his hand and intertwining their fingers.
There we have it. Effectively the last chapter of the story. Next week, the epilogue will follow, and then that's it for now. I don't see myself returning to this series anymore, although I hae been thinking about maybe writing a short about how Sirius and Remus met and became mates, but
‘There you go.’ Luna placed a bowl of soup in front of him, smiling at him as if he’d never said anything mean to her.
Draco eagerly spread his legs further, rubbing his hard cock against Harry’s jean-clad leg. Doing that kept his need away, but only for a little while as seconds later the gaping emptiness made him cry out again in need.
“Hmmm... Sure you don’t want to stay like this for a little while longer?” Harry inquired and he was right to, as it was already around four in the afternoon and they still hadn’t left their bedroom because Draco kept pulling Harry close for hugs and cuddling and attention. It was so nice to have his Alpha this close and to be smothered and get all his attention and... Draco realised that what he was doing was dangerously close to nesting and he wasn’t quite sure how he felt about that. So he gave a little experimental push against Harry’s chest, creating a tiny bit more space between them. It was more to test whether or not he was willing to part with his Alpha, than it was an answer to Harry’s question – he’d forgotten what Harry had asked anyway, but Harry was already letting go of Draco. “I’ll firecall Molly to see if it’s okay if we drop by.”
Harry gazed at her. “Did you think we weren’t?” It sounded defensive and Draco placed his hand on Harry’s thigh, hoping to calm him down.
‘Hmmww… Draco…?’ Harry murmured with a sleep-heavy voice, making Draco fall back into the bed and crawl close to his Alpha. ‘I’m right here…’
‘Fuck,’ Harry panted behind him and Draco could feel him coming again. He moaned involuntarily, ‘how does that even turn you on?’
Draco nervously hopped from feet to feet while Harry prepared the last memory. He could still feel the slight tinge of arousal in his body and hoped that the Alphas didn’t notice.
“I drew blood, though.” Harry’s lips shifted over the fresh mark as he spoke, making it increasingly hard for Draco to focus.
I don't know why but the whole chapter just feels so weird and awkward. At some point I considered putting up a message that said I'll be uploading a bit later so I could have more time to write a better chapter - at which point I stopped writing and went to bed.
Remus knelt in front of the fireplace, blowing the ashes out of it and stacking new firewood before lighting it with a lighter from his pocket. After, he remained on the floor, eyes expectantly on the door. His wait was short; only moments after the fire had been lit, the door creaked and opened, with a guard pushing through a man dressed in a faded red jumpsuit. His hair was dark, short and curly, a contrast to his bright, grey eyes. He was skinny, and Draco assumed the food at Azkaban wasn’t that great. It was hard to judge how tall he was, but if Draco were to hazard a guess, he’d say that he was about as tall as himself.
‘Christ Draco,’ was the answer to that and then he felt a knuckle push against his arse. Draco moaned and pushed back against it.
Side-along apparition was something Draco never seemed to get used to, and on top of that it was rather busy at the apparition point in the Leaky Cauldron.
Draco drank his tea, ate his oatmeal and smiled a watery smile at Harry, before taking the test and retreating to the toilet again.
Playing the waiting game was awful. Harry was tied to the ORO as long as the case wasn’t closed. He couldn’t go back to the Aurors until they had wrapped it up, so he had somewhat of a holiday. Hermione was still working, but she seemed to be bored as well.
Harry laughed a little, but it sounded just as awkward as Draco felt. ‘We could look up his file at the ORO to see if he actually owns all these Omegas – because that’s illegal.’
Draco smiled and gave Harry a quick kiss, making Harry chuckle. “Come on, let’s go find some Christmas gifts.”
This chapter has been such a joy to write, it practically wrote itself, haha. It has a few sentences in it that I'm very proud of - sometimes words just slide into place without me commanding them to do so.
(Poodle sneezes are so cute, don't you think? My poodle was sneezing all day and I nearly died of cuteness)
Lupin was a delightful houseguest. He wasn’t noisy, cleaned up after himself and almost never asked for anything. The first few weeks, he barely spoke at all. Instead, he wandered around the house with a dazed look on his face, as if he could not believe where he was. He spent most his time in his bedroom, and in the library. Draco had shared his collection of dingy romance novels with him, but it quickly turned out that Lupin wasn’t interested in that. Just like Draco had done when he’d been given the freedom to roam and read, Lupin read thick, informative books, picking books from the library at random.
Healer Roberts shook her head. “Not at all. Usually I can gather all the information I need to know by using a few spells. In only a few cases we need to use other methods, so if you’ll just sit still for a while...”
Neville shrugged. ‘I think she wanted me to be more like you. Always so prim and proper, refined manners and everything. I don’t really mind, I like being me, but it feels like I’ve disappointed her.’
They landed on the bed together and Draco clawed at Harry, desperate for him, feeling so hot, yet so empty. There was a gaping hole in him and he needed it filled, needed Harry to fill him, needed… ‘Please, please, please, I need – I need – ’
Everything felt like a chore, and he could barely bring up the energy or collect the motivation to do anything beyond sleeping, eating, and laying in his nest.
A woman entered. He did not recognise her. She carried a pile of blankets. Her face was completely blank. With robotic motions, she stepped up to him and shook out the blankets over his body. Then, she knelt next to him and placed a pillow underneath his head.
It was so awkward to look at that Draco turned away from the scene. It was embarrassing to see himself begging for Harry like that, but what was even more disconcerting was that he also started to feel somewhat aroused.
Mrs Weasley laughed, but it sounded more like crying. ‘I know, honey, you don’t have to comfort me.’
Draco wanted to ask why she hadn’t asked that of him, but she added, ‘it is illegal to ask an Omega to view their memories and next to that, you told me that your memory is somewhat cloudy so it would not have been fruitful to ask you about yours.’
“But you want him to,” Adelaide guessed. She stepped back into the sunroom and handed him a cup of peppermint tea, then sat down next to him.
He thought he might black out when he felt the last bit of Harry’s hand slip in and when Harry slowly moved his fingers into a fist, he was so close to coming, so close, but he didn’t know if…
‘No. Ron is always on Hermione’s side,’ Harry looked venomously at Hermione, ‘and Ginny is always against me to spite me.’
Mr Potter remained silent for a good while. Eventually: ‘why didn’t you tell me, Draco? Why didn’t you tell me, or anyone, for that matter, what was going on?’
“Good luck with your project,” Draco whispered back, and if Lupin answered, he didn’t hear before he left the kitchen, closing the door with a quiet click.
Across the table, Remus shrunk in size, pressing his limbs closer to his body and curling in on himself slowly.
White hot pain shot through his body and he cried out in despair. He couldn’t control his muscles anymore and they contracted in the most painful way. There was nothing else in every nerve of his body than the burning pain and the need to submit to his Alpha, to apologise for his behaviour, for trying to bare his neck to another man.
‘I see.’ Harry glanced at Draco. Draco smiled at him, trying to come across reassuringly. He wasn’t into Blaise. He was into Harry, and Harry knew that…
He could hear Harry moan, “fuck,” from outside the nest and made a soft noise of excitement in response to that. “Please, Harry…”
“Would you like some more guidance in the process?” Healer Roberts then suggested in a soft, non-offensive tone. “I understand it’s all a bit much, and it’s very normal and understandable to feel like you need more time, more space, or like you need to talk to someone.”
he thought dazedly as he brought his hand up to stroke Harry’s back. Slowly intertwining his fingers in Harry’s messy hair, he tried to focus on breathing through his nose because with Harry’s weight crushing him and teeth preventing him from moving too much, breathing became difficult quickly. ‘Harry…’ he managed to say, ‘I can’t breathe.’
But then Harry sat down next to him and it came back in tenfold. He rolled away, trying to get away from Harry, from the heat, the need.
It was on order he could easily follow and despite the need to be touched more, the need for more attention, he fell asleep in an instant.
With jittery nerves in his stomach, Draco lifted Elizabeth into the stroller, and then Victoria. Remus stood by the door, patiently waiting for Draco to be ready.
Draco, wide-eyed and expectant, watched his Alpha, waiting for the moment Harry would thrust up and start fucking him properly.
With a groan, Draco disentangled himself from the Alpha to push himself up on all fours, presenting himself to Harry for the first time in months.
They were quiet for a while and Draco considered pretending that nothing had happened during his last heat.
He felt Harry stretch out next to him. Draco hissed, because the motion juggled him and revealed new sore spots. Muscles he wasn’t even sure he had
‘Due to all this ruckus the Ministry feels as though it’s a necessity to pay all the registered Omegas a visit. We expect a Ministry official right after lunch, therefore your afternoon will be taken up by all that. We have owled miss Fawley and asked her to come this morning for your lessons instead. She will arrive at ten.’
“He is,” Remus confirmed. He scooted a little closer to Sirius, creating a maximum amount of physical contact, glueing himself to the other from ankle to shoulder. His arm was limply wrapped around Sirius’ waist, and Sirius had copied his posture. His fingernails dug into Remus’ side hard enough that Draco could see the outline of his ribcage even underneath the layers of clothing he had on.
Grabbing a handful of floo powder, Remus manoeuvred them into the fireplace, throwing the powder and calling out: “Sunny Springs!”
‘No, current owners or parents have to do that.’ Harry ran his fingers through his hair whilst pacing up and down the office. ‘After I left Draco and Adelaide at the day-care thing, I talked to some teachers that have been teaching there for over five years now. They all said that they were required to start teaching new subjects four years ago. Among those were lessons in obedience and submitting, which was something they all thought was weird.’
‘Of course not!’ his mother fumed, ‘he tried touching our boy and then he had to jump away because Potter had hurt him!’
‘I can’t remember.’ She pulled back a bit and he wanted to let her go, but she kept leaning into him so he awkwardly allowed her to do that and put his arms back around her.
His mother pulled back and stroked his cheek softly. ‘I’ll see if Miss Fawley can visit you, okay? Just stay right here…’
‘Mrs Longbottom, such a pleasure to see you again, it’s been a while.’ Harry greeted the elderly lady. She wore hideous clothes.
Harry’s arm sneaked around Draco’s waist as he casually said, “I’ll take care of the other things some other time, let’s go home.”
‘I know.’ Harry turned sideways a bit, so that Draco could see his face. His eyes, normally so warm and loving, were now cold and filled with an emotion Draco didn’t recognise.
I totally understand that it is crap to read a story wherein you can find consistent mistakes in spelling and grammar, and it is equally annoying to read a story that is not consistent when it comes to characters, the motivation main characters have, etc, etc, so please don't hesitate to tell me if something is off. Sure, it hurts my feelings because, well, I'm weird and sensitive like that, but it is sort off what I need to become a better writer.
Harry silenced him by kissing him, roughly and sloppily, with lots of tongue. Draco whimpered, feeling his hole stretch almost painfully to accommodate Harry’s knot. He heard Harry moan and pant, before he felt a hot stream of come fill him and Harry’s hips stilled.
Draco shrugged. “Tired.” He was tired all the time. “Low-level nausea. A little bloated, but it’s… okay. I guess.”
“More insatiable every day,” Draco laughed and he pushed his arse back a bit more. Harry muttered another spell and the kitchen door flew shut. He gripped Draco’s hips again, steadying the Omega as he easily pushed in, making both himself and Draco gasp.
Draco rubbed his sweaty hands across his trousers. What was up with these questions? No official had ever asked these kinds of things! ‘I don’t remember it well. If you want specifics you should ask my mother, sir.’
‘Yes,’ Draco confirmed and he leaned into Harry as much as he could. Harry sighed. He let his hands wander across Draco’s body, ending with both hands on his arse – again.
Mr Potter sat down first and Draco followed. They both were quiet for a bit, but the minute Draco started feeling awkward, Mrs Weasley came back with the tea. She placed her hand firmly on his shoulder and squeezed softly. ‘I’ll be doing some chores, but if you need me just let me know, okay?’
Both remained quiet as they entered the park. Draco was starting to get a little tired, and when he saw a bench, he steered them towards it. “I just need to rest for a few minutes,” he said. It felt like an apology -
“Okay.” Harry got up, immediately close to Draco again. They stood there for a short while, close but not touching. “You smell of metal and cold,” Harry sighed, sounding unhappy about that.
Draco looked over at the Alphas again, reassessing her age in his mind. She looked like she was in her mid-twenties, but if she had been one of Harry’s teachers… she would have to be at least in her thirties, maybe forties.
But however nice it was to have Harry visiting this often, Draco started to feel locked at the Burrow. He couldn’t go anywhere and the property wasn’t as large as he was used to. There was very limited space to roam free and Mrs Weasley was always
“Step away from him,” Draco repeated in a low, but non-threatening tone. To his surprise, the woman stepped back. First one step, then two, then a final third step. Draco kneeled, and crawled a little closer to the man. He sniffed. He smelled like honey, hay, soot and
“Sirius did that?” Draco asked. He did not want to believe it, but on the other hand… if he did not believe Harry’s words, that meant indirectly he was accusing Harry of lying.
They left Yellow Springs in silence. Outside, Draco let out a breath of relief. “I guess it’s really easier than we thought it would be.”
‘Draco, wake up.’ Harry shook the memory-Draco gently awake. ‘Come on, you need to get dressed. I’ll bring you back to Molly.’
As Draco wandered in, the Sirius Task Force - a name he admitted always made him chuckle - fell silent. It made him feel awkward, but he powered through, holding up two empty mugs and saying, “don’t mind me, I’m just refilling our coffee mugs.”
“David would’ve fitted just fine as well,” Draco muttered and he repositioned Alexander a little so he could hold the baby more comfortably.
Blaise frowned. ‘Well, of course there are concerned parents and owners, but we haven’t seen a decline in sign-ups.’
Sirius took Draco in with new eyes. “I see.” He grunted as he lifted Remus over him, creating maximum contact.
A gentle knock on the door woke the slumbering pair only half an hour later, and Harry gestured with his hand, opening the kitchen door wandlessly.
Harry blinked at the contract, taking some time to make sense of the words. “I don’t want you to sign this, Draco.”
P.S. Like I said before, I can't really promise anything regarding my schedule when it comes to writing and uploading. Uni's really killing me. Up until Christmas I have exams... After that it should get better soon, but again, I can't promise anything.
“Seemed like you were discussing some serious stuff when we came in for lunch today.” Harry’s tone was flippant, as if he did not care much, but Draco felt some uneasiness through their bond. “We were,” he said, adding, “Adelaide’s going to bond with Molly, I think.”
“Mine’s caffeine free,” Draco countered easily as he filled the kettle. “And Harry needs the caffeine. Without it, he’ll drool all over his paperwork. Honestly, he doesn’t need anything to fall asleep at night, just a glance at his paperwork does the trick.”
“I’m here, I’m here.” Harry dropped himself in the nest too, petting Draco’s soft skin from his feet up, skipped over his arse and placed one hand firmly in the small of his back, earning an eager moan from Draco. He shuffled a little closer, positioning himself in the ideal position whilst keeping the pressure on Draco’s spine, keeping him eager and compliant.
Draco did not know what to answer, and instead challenged the stranger - he could now pick up a vaguely Alpha-y scent - for eye contact.
The epilogue! I tried to deal with any loose ends there were, questions you as a reader might have after reading "Roots of a new life".
Lupin placed his now empty mug on the kitchen table. The rim of it had left a mark on his hand. “I mated with the wrong person.”
“I’m so proud that you’re investigating these things on your own,” Hermione gently said and she squeezed his shoulder supportively.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He couldn’t offer Remus much solace. He had no certainties to offer. “You don’t have to make the choice today,” he instead said, tone soft and low, “just take today for whatever it is, and don’t think about tomorrow, or next week. We can’t see the future, and I don’t think we should try.”
Draco placed their teacups on their desks and wandered into the library-part of the office. The books were sorted by main subject, and then alphabetically.
‘I won’t I won’t, I’ll do anything, please,’ Draco whined and he pushed his arse back against Harry’s hands.
“Sign what?” Harry stepped into the kitchen, pulling off his sooty robe and hanging it away. Beneath his work robes, he was wearing a navy blue sweater and dark grey jeans, a look Draco wished he’d see his mate more often in.
“They had a visiting arrangement. The DMLE and the ORO have taken that away from Lupin and his mate,” Draco said, although he was sure Harry already knew. “It came to an end recently, and they dumped Lupin with Tonks, who obviously wasn’t the appropriate match for Lupin.”
‘Have you seen today’s headline?’ His mother’s voice cut through his train of thought and he quickly looked at the headline.
The witch paid it no heed and pointed out the stairs next to the bar, explaining - with a heavy Scottish accent - how to get to their room.
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him a little closer, murmuring something Draco couldn’t quite make out, but that didn’t matter, he could feel how Harry felt through their bond.
“I just need to finish this.” Harry tapped the parchment he was working on before closing his eyes for a few seconds. “Merlin. I’m tired.”
‘No it was good,’ Draco panted, ‘just unexpected and – nnngghh!’ He threw his head back, pushing it into the pillow as Harry bend forward again and swallowed his cock whole. It was overwhelming to feel the wet heat on all sides and at the same time feel his arse being filled by Harry’s rapidly moving fingers. Arousal coiled tightly in his stomach and he lost his grasp on lucidity, barely being able to utter, ‘Harry, I’m – I’m…!’ before coming.
Draco tapped the bottom of the stegosaurus and then shook the plushie a little, making an appeased noise when it wasn’t making any sound anymore. “I like them.”
I'm not sure how I feel about this chapter. It has some things that I'm proud of and really like, but some of it is just kinda bleh to me. Hopefully I'll be back on my feet for next week's chapter!
“I know it can be overwhelming for first-time parents, but I have no doubt that you’ll both do wonderfully,” Healer Roberts said. “You may want dubbelcheck what options you have for parental leave. Most employers offer more time off, or the same amount of time off but with more pay.”
Sometimes, he could hear sound from the outside, but it was always muffled, and he could never make out any words. At most, he could guess the gender of the speaker - higher timbres for women, lower for the men.
Harry murmured low, soothing words in Draco’s ear and held his hand as Healer Roberts started the procedure.
“I’m staying right here,” Draco promised as he raised his hands and twisted his fingers into Harry’s hair, pulling him closer.
All the colour surged back to his face now and Draco felt horrible for flushing like that. ‘I had been feeling out of sorts for a few weeks. My mother was aware of this fact. Then I woke up the night of the fifteenth of September at five-thirty am in the morning, in heat.’
The stranger wiped his face clean with a cloth, and although his expression remained neutral, Draco could feel his anger emanating and permeating the air. It made the hair on his arms stand up in terror, even as he was determined to not show his fear.
Draco all but jumped out of the couch, towards his Alpha. ‘What?!’ Before he knew it, he was next to Harry and then on the chair that was always there so he could sit near Harry whenever he needed to. He curled his fingers around Harry’s and repeated, much softer, ‘what?’
Harry didn’t tease. Even without their usual prep, he all but slid in. Draco gasped for air, muscles tensing and relaxing almost immediately again as a response. He pressed his forehead against the tiles, seeking release but not remembering how.
‘That’s… great,’ Draco said, surprised that she would admit doing such a thing and wanting to better herself as well.
P.S. Small shout-out to the loyal reader that was the only one to comment on last chapter. (DiverTazSC)  Thank you!
Draco nodded lightly, making sure not to move his head too much, afraid that it would amplify the sick burn in his throat and esophagus. “He’s trying to get his mate back.”
‘That’s okay,’ Harry said in the same soothing voice he had used during Draco’s heat and Draco was surprised to feel a jolt of arousal go through him.
The next morning, Draco’s heat was over again and while he felt sore from being pounded into the matrass more times than he’d been able to count, he felt amazing.
Draco managed an indignant laugh and weakly hit Harry in his shoulder. “You promised we wouldn’t use archaic language in raising them.”
Draco checked his room at the Burrow one more time to check of he had left any of his things, and then checked his burrowed trunk. It was all there, so he shut it. He sighed. Leaving the Burrow made his decision to bond with Harry so definitive. It made him feel insecure. But it was for the best this way. Usually, Omegas were on a relatively frequent schedule when it came to their heats, so moving into the Alpha’s house was something that could be easily planned. Draco’s body, however, had proven to be very unreliable when it came to his heats. So he and Mrs Weasley had concluded that it was better to move in with Harry immediately, so that when his heat kicked in, they could bond easily and in privacy.
Mrs Longbottom grimaced at him, ‘well, go join him then.’ She let go of his sleeve and Draco quickly walked into the garden, where Harry and Neville were already chatting amicably.
Mrs Weasley patted his knee, ‘now, that’s unfortunate, but it happens. Do you think Arthur and I never quarrel about things?’
Her anger vanished instantly as she came closer and placed her hand on his arm, preventing him from cowering away any further. ‘I would never, Draco,’ she said softly, in a soothing voice. ‘Did Harry hurt you?’
The door slammed shut and Draco sighed, already moving a bit to free himself out of Harry’s embrace. Harry’s arms tightened around him, whilst whispering, ‘we’re not doing anything illegal…’
I hate to have it posted so late, but then again... I don't want to say it's perfect now, but I do feel like it's been quite some time since I've felt this satisfied about a chapter.
Adelaide hesitated, he could see. ‘It’s… I’m so… I’m sick all the time.’ She gave him a watery smile, ‘but at the same time it’s so lovely. There is something of my own growing in there. I can feel it there every day… I can’t help but already be in love with it.’
I wanted to take some time to build the relationship between our lovely main characters some more, as well as showcase the change in Harry's demeanor. What do you think is doing on? Why is Harry so agitated and WHAT IS UP WITH THAT WEIRD BITING KINK?
“I know…” he murmured. “It’s just…” He looked at the baby in his arms so he didn’t have to look at anything else. The light weight was comforting and made it easier to speak on. “It’s just that every time… the last three heats… I had this bump… you know…”
Harry's leave of absence seems to do the job; he and Draco are growing closer. What do you think about Harry reading Draco's book? About how he protected Draco from Narcissa? About how Draco slowly seems to realise that this really is his life, that there's no catch?
‘I think these will fit you, they are my husband’s, so they will be a little bit big but it should do for today.’ She gave him a set of clothes. He sniffed them hesitantly. They smelled of beta, but she had said it would be okay, so…
