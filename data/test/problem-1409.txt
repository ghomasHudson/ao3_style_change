“Remus asked me last week if I would be alright with meeting with Harry…um Evan here and keeping it a secret from the rest of the family. So I went to meet him for lunch today. Since he just doesn’t want to have anything to do with Ron and Ginny, I thought it was safe enough to bring him back here.” George explained easily after one last mock glare at a still sniggering Evan.
Evan pulled all his magic into his skin. With a tight control on his magic, so the other wizard couldn’t sense it, he reached out and shook the blonde wizard’s hand, giving him a tight smile. He barely touched the blonde before pulling his hand away.
“You weren’t broken, Ev. Just a little lost. And you becoming who you are now is all you. We just nudged you a little in the right direction.” Ryan said, pulling Evan into a hug.
Evan fidgeted nervously as he waited in Angela’s office, calming when she threw an exasperated glance his way. He knew she would protect him if need be, and he could defend himself; he knew that he probably had nothing to worry about, but still, he couldn’t help himself. Finally, there was a knock on the door, and Angela’s assistant announced Malfoy.
“May I ask why you wish to keep such a secret?” He asked, examining Evan closely. He would address the man’s issues with Hermione later.
“I will need you to take a magically binding vow, either an Unbreakable vow or wizard’s oath that you will not reveal my birth name to anyone, in any way. And I will only deal with you, not your partner. No matter the circumstances, I will never have any contact with your partner.” Evan said, steadying himself for the inevitable questions. He could see the anger stirring in Malfoy’s eyes, and he was sure the man would say no.
George barrelled into the café and pulled Evan into a bone-crushing hug, laughing and thumping him on the back.
“Oh, hey. You’re up. Is it that time already?” Evan said as he saw Scott placed a plate of pancakes and bacon on the table in Evan’s spot.
If Jamieson could forgive him, with his dark past, and trust him enough to reveal himself, then what must Hermione have done to the man to cause this much anger? He could admit to himself that the woman kept herself separate even after all these years of working together, so he didn’t really know as much as he would have liked. He would wait and see.
“Hey, George. How’ve you been?”Evan asked with a small smile, even if it was still weird to him to see just George without Fred by his side.
“I- I wasn’t ready. I hate it. So much. The magical world has taken so much from me. I never really want to talk about it. I couldn’t even talk about it to my therapist because of the Statute of Secrecy. That means only family gets to know about magic. You’re my family, so I can tell you. Telling anyone else would be illegal, and if I was found out, it wouldn’t be pretty.” Evan shrugged a little.
Draco huffed and mumbled something about oblivious Gryffindors under his breath before turning the page and continuing the conversation as though nothing had happened.
As it flew into his hand, he heard them gasp and started to grin. It was quite nice to show off a little.
Evan grimaced and shrugged, opening his mouth to reply when they heard a commotion outside. The shop assistants were obviously trying to prevent someone from entering the office area. All three of them turned around when they heard a very disgruntled voice grumbling loudly.
He didn’t mind the fans, even if their questions were a tad repetitive; it was the fake smiles and schmoozing that the recording executives insisted on that really ground him down. Right now, he was stuck with one of the worst of the lot. Evan wasn’t even sure if the man actually liked his music or was just making empty conversation because his boss wanted him to. For some reason, the man reminded him of Fudge, which was just not a good thing for anyone. He sighed again internally and allowed his eyes to roam the room, trying to spot Scott or Angela so he could ask if he could leave anytime soon.
“You, my darling boy, are more than worth it.” She said, cupping his cheek in one perfectly manicured hand before she kissed the other cheek and smiled at him. “I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow.”
It had taken many, many days and trips to different stores for Harry to find the perfect ring and even then he had had to get it custom made based on an idea that had been sparked by a conversation with Luna. He really hoped Draco would like it.
“It’s actually just one thing, but the other follows from it.” Evan continued his nerves making his voice slightly higher pitched than usual.
“You never really explained that to me.” Scott asked, “You just said they made it unbearable, and you had to leave.”
Harry had been tired, exhausted by the war and the toll in lives and emotions. He had just wanted a quiet life, but his friends, his so-called family, had disagreed. They had been pulling him in different directions, insisting he join the Aurors or go back to Hogwarts and marry Ginny Weasley. After years of being Dumbledore’s puppet, Harry had just snapped. He told his ‘friends’ to stuff it and walked away without a backward glance. He would never allow anyone to control him as he had for eighteen years.
Everyone started getting up from their seats and moving towards the dining room, leaving Evan alone with Ryan.
Draco looked up, startled. He hadn’t thought about it like that, but that was exactly how she was. Granted, he was a former Slytherin and wasn’t into revealing things about himself, but she still knew more about him than he did her. Even when he had bared his own feelings of inadequacy to her after one too many drinks, she had remained calm and collected and never offered anything about herself. At the time, he had brushed it off as Hermione being closed off after her best friends had left her all alone, but now he was wondering if anyone even knew the woman. Or had ever known her.
Evan paled but straightened his spine, prepared to face this ghost of his past, as he didn’t seem to have a choice. George immediately rose to shield Evan from view, but Evan put a hand on his arm to stop him, shaking his head imperceptibly at the older man when George glanced at him.
Scott went back to the coffee machine to start it up again. He knew everyone would be wanting more coffee.
“It’s still very beautiful. Is it the same spell you used to save us from the Dementors?” Scott asked, watching the heron.
“So, umm, why keep it a secret for so long?” Ryan asked softly, uncertainly. He looked slightly hurt, and Evan rushed to reassure him.
“You poor boy. I’m so glad you survived and came to us.” She said, hugging him close. Then she pulled away and continued, “Of course, your real eye colour would suit you best, love. And it is a gorgeous colour. Now, how about you show us what you can really do with your magic?” she asked briskly, changing the subject a little as she could see that Evan was getting uncomfortable, as he always did when people focused on his looks. It was strange for someone who lived so much of his life in the limelight, but she had always found it an endearing trait.
Angelina looked up, and Evan was struck by the fact that, like George, she hadn’t really changed much in the intervening years; sure, they both had some slight greying at the temples, but both still had their youthful dispositions intact, and he was grateful for it.
“I know I’m technically not supposed to, but I’ve been helping Evan with his PTSD and panic attacks since he stopped visiting the therapist. I guess she took him about as far as she could dealing with the abuse. Now, unless I can find someone who is in the know about the magical world, which Evan still doesn’t want, I’m going to be helping him the rest of the way. He’s come a long way, even being able to talk about the past without a panic attack.” Scott said, still rubbing Evan’s shoulder comfortingly. Evan threw him a grateful look.
Draco mentally shook himself and shelved his questions for later. And there would definitely be a later. Now that he knew that the man in front of him was Potter, many things made so much sense about the man’s music, and it only increased his desire to know more about the man. This man who had thousands of wizards and witches worshipping him and just walked away from it to forge an entirely new path for himself, away from it all, and succeeded.
“Mmmm yes…Draco…unghhh.Right there. Of course. Your wish is my command, love.” Harry gasped out between moans as they lost themselves in each other.
He listened, his glass of firewhiskey untouched beside him and reminisced. He had worked through his issues with years of mind-healing and therapy, but somehow this smooth, melodious voice helped soothe his soul so much better than anything else ever had. Draco knew there was no way he would give up on getting to know the man. If not a lover, he would settle for just friendship, but he had to be honest with himself. He desperately wanted this man, this wonderful human who could so easily see inside his darkness and pull him back into the light with just his music.
“Now, what have you done?” She asked, fondness in her voice unmistakable as she eyed Evan until he took his hat off and met her pretty brown eyes, “Harry!” she exclaimed in surprise.
. He-he wants to marry me? You really think so?” He asked his voice rising into a squeak in his excitement.
“Later. First, we celebrate the fact that you actually got my hints. Frankly, I was beginning to despair.” Draco teased.
“Alright, I’ll go with you.” He said, conjuring a hat and jamming it on his head to hide his scar and eyes as best he could.
“You’re a very good boyfriend. He’s a lucky man.” Hermione said pressing a kiss to her friend’s cheek and turning to look at the display that had caught Draco’s eye previously, “Hmmm” she said thoughtfully.
“So who is Scott? Boyfriend?” Draco asked, needing to know the answer more than he would ever admit to.
Draco sat back, surprised at the anger he could feel radiating from the other man. He hadn’t expected this much after all this time. Potter – dammit Jamieson, he would have to remember the new name if he kept his client. And he realised he would be keeping Jamieson as his client; he wanted to know more about this man, and staying his lawyer was the easiest way forward. He may be angry about the man’s attitude towards Hermione, but he had already come too far to back off now.
“Yes, Evan. I’ll explain.” Remus said, smiling fondly at the man who had become as much of a godson to him as to Sirius.
“George is fine, Evan. If you really want, I can ask if he would be open to meeting you sometime?” Remus asked gently, placing a soothing hand on Evan’s fidgeting ones.
“I don’t know. Angela said the firm’s name was Granger and Malfoy, though.” Scott answered, still uncomprehending.
“I, um, don’t know. I’d have to ask Remus. I haven’t really kept up with magic much, as you can see. You really think green is better?” Evan asked, flushing a little in embarrassment at the appraisal, before turning back to Mama Jem, who had been quietly listening to them talk. “Mama Jem?” he asked.
“Yes?” Draco prodded. He wished the man would just get on with it already. All this fidgeting was getting on his nerves.
Scott nodded, “Like glue.” He asserted, and with one last nod to himself, Evan straightened his spine and walked forward and stepped through the door to go back to the party.
It seemed he had put his foot firmly in his mouth. But something about being so easily dismissed had put his back up and made him lose all control of his sharp tongue. He hadn’t been this impulsive since the last time he had taunted Potter. Apparently, the music had brought back memories better left forgotten. He berated himself for it and for not listening to the man’s music before the concert. Maybe then he wouldn’t have been caught so off-guard. Perhaps it wasn’t too late, he mused as he left the party and wandered towards the concession stand that was still selling merchandise. He bought the two albums Jamieson had released so far and then apparated home to listen to them in solitude.
“Yup, smile and nod along to whatever Angela says, and you should be home free in an hour or so,” Scott said encouragingly.
“Go on then open it,” Harry said walking into the room and going down on one knee in front of Draco.
“Elder wood.” Harry replied just as quietly, “Is this what you wanted for Christmas, my love?” he asked.
Harry smiled despite himself. This childish side of his lover was always endearing and amusing, even if it was too early in the morning to be dealing with it. Sometimes he thought he got both a kid and a boyfriend in one when he moved in with Draco. He pulled the blonde into a tender kiss before pulling away and ruffling his lover’s soft wavy blond locks.
“She never said a word about you or the Weasel. She doesn’t talk about herself much.” Draco admitted hoping it would get Jamieson to reveal something.
Evan smirked at Scott and mouthed, “Relatively.” Both men chuckled softly as they followed after her.
“Does my baby want a new cloak then?” He asked as he was dragged along behind Draco when the blonde started walking.
“Is that from your new lawyer boyfriend?” Scott teased, and Evan balled up a blank piece of paper and threw it at him. He dodged easily and laughed along with his cousin.
“Oh, yeah, sure,” Evan said, pulling the amulet out from under his shirt and pulling it off his neck. “As you can see, not really all that different. Just a change in eye colour, some softening of my features and no scar. Believe me, it's enough to throw most people off. I was known for my glasses, green eyes and scar—only someone who really knew me, like Granger maybe, could tell it was me. And even then, I think I’ve changed a lot in the last twelve years. I’m at least not the scrawny underfed boy I was then.” Evan continued as they gasped and looked at his new features.
“There’s the rub, innit.” Evan sighed. “I guess it’s time to finally come clean with everyone?” He asked, looking up at his cousin inquiringly.
“Oh um, I’m wearing a goblin-crafted glamour that hides what I actually look like. I haven’t looked like myself for nearly twelve years now.” Evan said, shrugging a little shamefacedly.
He quickly shifted through his schedule and sent an email to Jamieson’s agent, requesting a meeting with the man. Then finally, he went back to his research into the man. Surprisingly or maybe not so surprisingly, he found nothing about the man except that Evan Jamieson was not his birth name, and the name had been changed about ten years ago. What was really surprising was that the man’s birth name had been hidden from everyone, and there was no way to discover what it was or anything about the man from before he had changed his name. Someone had done a very thorough job of erasing Jamieson’s identity prior to June of  1999.
Once Harry heard Draco’s footsteps receding he turned over and grinned to himself. Hopefully, today was the day he would get engaged to the love of his young life. He got up and bounded down the stairs after the blonde.
“Yes, alright. I will make sure Hermione doesn’t come anywhere near you. Would you like me to draw up a contract to make it magically binding? Give you more protection?” Draco asked, looking up at Jamieson as he got up from his chair and walked towards the window, staring out of it. He hadn’t missed the automatic flinch at the mere mention of Hermione’s name. It made him even more curious.
“He wants a very specific kind of jewellery.” She said. And when there didn’t seem to be any spark of comprehension she continued, “The kind that means you stay together forever?”
“Is there someone here who can act as our bonder?” The blonde asked, trying to stall as his mind raced to figure out what he was missing. The man was familiar, but he just couldn’t put his finger on it. He was probably wearing a glamour at any rate.
“Tomorrow, alright? With everyone else. I just don’t want to think of them anymore today.” Evan answered, giving Scott a pleading look.
Evan sighed and relaxed into the hug. They would be alright, he thought as he felt Ryan relax as well. Together the two men went in to breakfast.
“So you don’t want Hermione to know where you are. Is that how you treat old friends?” Draco drawled, his anger at how Potter – no Jamieson – had treated his friend coming to the fore.
“I usually don’t, but in your case, I’m willing to make an exception.” Draco drawled, smirking at the singer.
As he downed a hangover potion and got ready for work, he found himself playing that song on repeat. He was still humming that song to himself as he walked into work, a small smile on his face. He would find a way to get to know the man. He was Draco Malfoy, and he always got what he wanted, he mused when his partner’s voice cut through his thoughts.
Evan read the words and smiled. It was a mixture of lawyer-speak and the Malfoy of old that he remembered, and he found he was looking forward to meeting the blonde lawyer again. He
“Can someone explain to me why the fuck I am awake this early in the fucking morning?” She cursed, taking a cup of coffee from Scott with a grateful look.
“Don’t give me that look, young man. I’m sure this will be relatively painless. Come along now.” She said as she made her way to the first group of record execs.
“Hello, darlings. I’m sorry I’m a little late. There was some traffic on the motorway.” She said, handing out hugs to everyone until she stopped in front of Evan, “Alright, so are you going to explain what happened last night? And why you took such a sudden dislike to the lawyer?” she asked, tipping his face up to look into his face.
“It’s not your responsibility. The important thing is that you are alright.” Scott stated determinedly. He would protect his cousin in every way he could.
some paper and a pen and scribbled a quick reply telling Malfoy to meet him at a nearby café at noon.
“I take it, that wasn’t what you were expecting to happen?” Scott asked, seeing the look on Evan’s face.
He was just glad he hadn’t lost any of his family over this. He had hoped at one time to integrate both worlds he lived in, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to any more. The magical world hadn’t brought him anything but trouble in all the years he’d lived there. But maybe it was time to give it a second chance. It was something to think about.
“I’m fine, Scotty. Don’t worry. It’s just – you remember me telling you about the blonde git who used to make my life hell in school?”
Evan could see the disbelief on their faces, but he was glad that they were at least listening without interruptions. Evan picked up the story again and told of his eleventh birthday and Hagrid; he glossed over the numerous owls and his uncle dragging them all over creation to avoid them; he also omitted the pigs’ tail, for which Scott threw him a grateful glance. He continued with the Diagon alley shopping trip and mentioned his first meeting with Malfoy and saw the recognition in Angela’s eyes.
“I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, swear on my magic to never reveal in any way Evan Jamieson’s birth name to anyone without his express permission,” Draco said, his wand in his hand lighting up as the vow settled. “Will that do?” he asked, half-angry and half-curious.
A silvery shape flowed out of his wand, and instead of the stag he had expected, it coalesced to form a bird, a heron if Evan wasn’t mistaken. He gaped at it along with everyone else.
“That’ll do.” Evan agreed and pulled his amulet off. He heard the gasp from the blonde and looked up to meet his eyes.
Evan was torn for a few minutes. He thought he might be ready to let some of his old friends back into his life, but he wasn’t sure how they felt about him anymore. And he didn’t want to put George in an awkward place with his family as Evan was definitely not willing to have anything to do with Molly, Ron, or Ginny. He debated this internally before nodding firmly.
He had never thought anyone would understand what he had been through during the war and in the years after when he had been desperately trying to redeem himself and make a name for himself away from his parents.
“I don’t think there’s anything you could tell me that would change the way we care about you, young man.” She said, and Evan could see the others nodding as he ducked his head.
Harry had snuck down in the middle of the night and hidden the ring in Draco’s stocking. Now he pretended to be asleep as his boyfriend tried in vain to wake him up. Finally, Draco lost patience and huffed.
“Fine.” He said sulkily, and Evan swept out of the shop, ignoring everyone and the sounds of George berating his errant sibling behind him. As soon as he reached the apparition point, he apparated to a park he had been to before for a concert. It was mostly deserted now, and Evan glanced around quickly before apparating again, this time back home where he knew Draco would be waiting for him.
“Right, of course. Yeah, sure, you can pick me up at seven on Friday.” Evan said, feeling stupid; he should have known that.
Evan let out a choked laugh at that, “That bitch, that hypocritical bitch.” He gasped, laughing almost hysterically.
Draco nodded and took the offered hand, and the other man nodded almost to himself and walked out. Both men had to suppress their surprise at the jolt that ran through them at the touch.
“Indeed. What an honour. I shall do my best to fulfil your every wish my fiend. So what is it your heart desires?” Harry asked yawning and stretching his hips rolling up into Draco’s creating a pleasant friction against his morning wood.
Harry was woken up by his boyfriend bouncing up onto his bed. He sighed and pretended to still be asleep. The previous day had been long and boring and it was the weekend dammit, he would sleep-in if he wanted.
“Come, sit. And….I’ll try to explain.” Evan said, gesturing to the seat beside him, “It’s kind of a long story.” He began rubbing the back of his neck.
They had a delightful breakfast with Scott teasing Evan about his new boyfriend and Evan deflecting by teasing Scott about the new hire at his agency that Scott fancied. It was something they had never gotten to do as teenagers, and they both relished these opportunities.
Sending numerous applications for apprenticeships and being rejected repeatedly until surprisingly, Hermione Granger had helped him out by pointing out that if the magical world wouldn’t accept him, then maybe the muggle one would. Studying along with Hermione and getting accepted into the law program with the Gryffindor brainiac. Finishing muggle Law school and apprenticing with law offices in the wizarding world later to learn magical law again along with Granger.
George shot him a mock, hurt look for this even as his wife glared at him, and Evan sniggered at him.
“The reason we agreed to meet with them was that they promised to increase your audience. In light of what you just told us, I’m guessing they would be able to promote you in the magical world as well. Is that something you would be interested in? Or is it too soon? Or never?” Angela asked, insistently even as she peered at him intently, searching for signs that she was pushing him too far.
“I wouldn’t bet on it.” He mumbled almost to himself, earning a cuff on the shoulder from Scott and a glare from Jemima, who were closest to him and had heard him.
“Thanks,” Evan said, relaxing against the blonde man. He could take a few more minutes to relax with his cousin. “So, how bad is it out there? Who does Angela want me to impress today?” he asked after a few minutes of comfortable silence.
Evan waved back, a grin spreading across his face as he watched the blonde walk away. He really had to admire the blonde’s arse in that suit. It really showed it off to perfection. He had a date.
He then told a much-edited version of his life for the next seven years ending with his running away from the fame and infamy in the wizarding world, where everyone wanted something from him. When he paused to grapple for control of the emotions his memories had brought back, Scott rubbing his back a sympathetic look on his face, he saw his friends, his family staring at him, shock and something else he couldn’t quite place on their faces. Evan buried his face in his hands.
“Let’s go home,” Scott said and pulled his cousin along to the elevator that would lead them to a private car-park where they had parked the car before the show.
“I think I’ll be fine. It was just the shock of seeing him after all these years and in such a place. I could even deal with meeting Malfoy, I think. Just -just stick close, alright?” Evan asked, throwing his cousin an uncertain glance.
“Of course. There’s no way we could have managed in that small flat all four of us for so long without a little magic. It’s nice to have it finally confirmed, though.” She answered, shrugging nonchalantly, and Evan grinned at her, relieved beyond the measure of it.
The blonde was quiet for the rest of the day but Harry could tell he was plotting something so he let him be. These days Draco’s plots were usually not harmful to anyone, not even himself.
“Good morning. Did you even sleep last night?” Scott asked, concerned as he saw the dark circles under his cousin’s eyes.
Evan just grimaced, “More like nightmares wouldn’t let me sleep, so I stayed up working on my music instead of sleeping.” He replied but waved away the concern he could see in the blonde’s eyes, “But never mind that. You have the contract?” he asked, changing the subject quickly.
“Don’t worry so, love. I’m sure it’s not as bad as all that.” She said, smoothing a hand through his messy hair. “Unless you’re sick? Are you sick?” She asked, pulling back a little to study his face.
“In fact,” The redhead began looking inquiringly at Evan, “Why don’t you come by the shop right now? If you’re not doing anything else, I mean.” He asked.
Evan was only startled out of his creative fugue when the owl soared into the music room and settled on the chair next to his piano. He blinked uncomprehendingly at it for a few seconds. It wasn’t Remus and Tonks’ bird, so it had to be Malfoy’s. He reached out and took the letter from the bird, being careful of its sharp talons as it looked like a fierce bird and very carefully reached out to pet it. Surprisingly it moved into his touch and soaked up the affection he was giving it. Evan chuckled.
“I’m fine.” Evan said, but at Scott’s snort, he sighed and added, “I’m fine now. I’ll be just fine. But I need to leave now. And don’t commit to anything with Malfoy and his firm, please. I’ll explain everything to you tomorrow?” He finished quizzically.
“What? I can’t even drop by to see my brother now?” Ron asked belligerently, not bothering to answer her question. Then his eyes fell on Evan, and he stopped, stared and flushed violently. “You!” He exclaimed, glaring at the singer.
“Yes. I think I might like that,” Evan said before looking up sharply. “But you will explain about Ron and Ginny and Molly to him, won’t you?”
Remus also seemed to think that Malfoy might be amenable to an Unbreakable or Wizard’s vow to keep Evan’s identity a secret if it meant a new client. The firm was very big on client confidentiality apparently and thriving from all accounts. So Evan reluctantly agreed to meet with Malfoy in Angela’s office. There was no way he was inviting the man into his home.
“Hah, like you were ever a boy scout.” Scott snorted, and Evan chuckled, making the blonde relax a little. If Evan could laugh at jokes about their terrible childhood, then maybe he really was as fine as he professed to be.
Harry looked at him quizzically but when he showed no sign of saying more he pushed it to the back of his mind to puzzle over. Did Draco want to spend Christmas with his parents again? It would be really hard to arrange with Lucius in Azkaban but not impossible. But that didn’t sound right either, Draco had not been interested in ever visiting his father in all the years that he had been in prison so why now? Nothing made sense but maybe Draco would give him some more clues to work with. Harry really wanted to get this right for his love.
Draco then decided that they had probably had enough of poking the past with a stick, so he changed the subject back to Evan’s music and the different types he enjoyed. The conversation then wound around them with an ease they would never have expected in their younger years, and by the time lunch had arrived and they had both consumed it, the two men seemed well on their way to being friends. Both quite surprised by the ease with which they interacted with each other.
Evan looked around and saw that Ridley was looking at him, eyebrows raised in curiosity. Ryan seemed slightly worried, and Jemima just looked fond.
Evan spoke to Remus, and the werewolf had nothing but good things to say about Malfoy’s firm. He didn’t mention Hermione as he knew how much Evan hated the mention of his former friends. But Malfoy had apparently turned his life around, attended muggle law school and done well for himself by establishing the firm with Hermione, where he handled the muggle side, and she dealt with the magical side for the most part, although there was some overlap sometimes.
“Well, not really. I mean, I have a bad history with both of them. Granger, who I assume is Hermione Granger, used to be my best friend. I used to trust her until she betrayed me and proved she was just like everyone else. Always wanting something from me. Malfoy, on the other hand, I’ve forgiven. He was a prat, but if he’s willingly working with non-magical people now, then I could work with him. But definitely not Granger. Malfoy and me, we were kids. He made a lot of mistakes, but he wasn’t really responsible for them, and he seems to have turned his life around.” Evan shrugged at the end.
“Hello. Been waiting long?” Draco asked as he sat down opposite the brunette, unbuttoning his jacket as he got comfortable.
“I look alright?” He asked. Scott gave him a thumbs-up, and the brunette nodded to himself and prepared to step out into the melee.
Harry and Draco were strolling through Diagon Alley window shopping on their way to meet with Ginny and Hermione for lunch when Harry noticed Draco seemed to be absorbed in the display of Twilfitt and Tattings. He moved closer and wrapped his arms around the blonde’s waist.
“There you go. In. And out. You’re doing great, cuz. Come on. There you go.” Scott breathed encouragement, and he sat down next to his cousin and pulled him into his arms.
Harry was upset. He knew that Draco had given him plenty of clues. But he just couldn’t figure it out. Why was he having so much trouble with this thing? He knew Draco better than anyone else, at least he thought he did. So why was this so difficult. He really didn’t want to be the reason Draco was disappointed on Christmas day. Harry sighed and decided to talk to Hermione. Maybe she would know what Draco was hinting at.
“Of course. Evan, I wanted you to meet Mr. Malfoy here. Mr. Malfoy, Evan Jamieson.” Angela said, pulling on  Evan’s arm lightly to include him in the conversation, much to Evan’s consternation.
“This calls for a proper celebration.” Draco continued as he stood up and dragged Harry back upstairs.
Angela eyed him up and down to see if he was alright and upto the next couple of hours of meet and greet she had set up for him, then nodded to herself in satisfaction as Evan just smiled ruefully at her.
“Ok, I haven’t tried this in years, but this is a fun spell that leaves me feeling really good. So, here goes nothing.” Evan said and swished his wand, yelling, “
“You may not have known everything about me, but you did know the most important bits.” Evan felt compelled to point out, “You knew I was a scrawny, half-starved broken boy. And you took care of me, and my cousin when he showed up. It’s because of you all that I am who I am.” Evan stated vehemently.
Harry was getting desperate when Draco finally took pity on his clueless boyfriend and pointed out the advertisement for shares in a diamond mine.
Evan smiled weakly at him but said nothing. There was a knock on the door, and both men turned to see Ridley stroll into the room. Her pretty dark hair pulled up into a high ponytail, dark eyes sulky with the early hour.
“Of course, I’m allowed to go back there. I’m only his bloody brother, after all. Not some stranger.” Ron muttered as he barged into the office.
“I’ve had a couple of messages from the Malfoy bloke. He seems persistent.” She said without preamble, and Evan sighed. He should have expected it. Malfoy had never been one to just let go of things. “Are you sure you won’t work with him? What if we can make sure you only work with him and not his partner?”
“I read somewhere that herons are representatives of transformation and renewal. You’ve certainly done that.” Ridley pointed out, and Evan nodded, pleased to have this proof that his efforts to grow and change, even if he did miss the stag that used to represent his father.
“Enough of that now. So tell us. What is such a big secret?” Jemima asked, her curiosity rising the more Evan stalled.
And that was the truth as he saw it; he was more himself now than he had been then. A reality that was what he needed to see, to remind himself of so he could sleep again without nightmares. He worked on his new tune so lost in his music that he didn’t notice when Scott came downstairs and started making breakfast or when he let in a large eagle owl carrying a missive.
give the Lupins a call tonight so they can be there in the morning.” Evan mused aloud, and Scott agreed with him.
Brooms for the whole family was what the tag said and it showed a picture of a family of four, mom and dad and two kids on brooms happily tossing the Quaffle around.
“The silly prat hasn’t been able to keep a job for long, but now Dad got him a job at the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and this is honestly the longest he’s had a job. Hope it sticks. Gin is playing for the Harpies and has a new boyfriend every time I turn around. She’s just too busy to visit with her brothers or come home, except during the off-season. So we don’t see them much anymore. Honestly, I don’t really go home much anymore either. We, that is, Bill, Fleur, Charlie and Ang and me, meet up sometimes for dinner at Bill’s place or my place whenever Charlie’s in town, but that’s it. Mum tried to insist on weekly dinners with the whole family for a while after the war, but it didn’t last long. What with Percy acting like his usual prat self and Mum’s irrational hatred for Fleur and Ang, it just wasn’t feasible.” George continued to prattle as they made their way the short distance from the café to the Leaky Cauldron and on, to his shop.
“I…umm..there’s something I need to tell you all,” Evan said slowly as Ryan wandered in, still looking half-asleep. It made Evan wonder how the other man had managed to drive there while still asleep. Luckily it wasn’t too far, but still.
As he searched, his eyes locked on a blond head, a blonde of a colour he had hoped never to see again, and Evan froze in place. He could barely breathe; his heart was pounding loudly in his ears. He couldn’t see, he could barely think, his palms were sweating, and he knew he would start shaking any minute. Evan didn’t know what he said to the exec he had been talking to or how he managed to get away, but he somehow found himself sunk to the floor with his head between his knees in his dressing room, trying to catch his breath. He was shaking, and there were tears running down his cheeks, not that he noticed, but that was how Scott found him sometime later.
“That is the same blonde git. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. A lawyer now, apparently.” Evan said, grimacing a little. His eyes, now blue under the glamour, looked a little lost and a little sad. “I’m actually quite impressed that he’s working with muggles now, actually,” Evan said as he managed to gather himself. “But I don’t think I can do any work with them. The Granger mentioned?” he said, and Scott nodded again, understanding dawning slowly as Evan spoke.
“I’ve been thinking about asking him for a while now. Just wasn’t sure how to do it. Christmas morning sounds perfect actually.” Harry said smiling broadly.
“You’ve never been my friend Ronald Weasley. I wanted nothing to do with you then, and I want nothing to do with a failure of a human being like you, ever.” Evan spat, his faked calm crumbling under Ron’s obviously drunken anger. “George, Angie, I’m sorry I have to cut this short. But I think I should leave before I do something I will regret.” Evan said, turning to the other two.
“Y-you. M-mirror. Ch-chair. T-table… f-flowers, a-and sh-shoes.” Evan managed to gasp out. The soothing motion of Scott’s hand on his back, helping him focus a little.
“If you pay close attention over the next few weeks then you will know my love. But you have to pay attention. Think you are upto the challenge, Santa baby?” Draco asked even as he moved his arse to better accommodate Harry’s hard cock and started rutting against him.
“Sounds like you enjoyed the concert at least. Is he really as good as all that?” Hermione questioned, following him into his office.
Draco wasn’t sure what exactly had just happened. The man hadn’t even given him a chance to speak. He’d just left. Barely spared him a glance. Like Draco didn’t matter. He hadn’t felt this slighted since he was eleven and offering to be Harry Potter’s friend. Ok, admittedly, the man did look a little pale and shaky, and the man with him and his manager had both been very solicitous of him, but still, nobody dismissed a Malfoy that easily.
“Potter.” Draco gasped in shock. He had wondered where Potter had gone, but he had never imagined this. The man looked so different. Even without the glamour, only those bright green eyes and the scar were the same. And even the scar was a pale, faded version of what it had been when Draco had seen it daily across the Great Hall.
“I didn’t say anything.” Evan protested, still smirking at his cousin. Angela just gave them both a knowing look and didn’t say anything more, and both men grinned back unrepentantly. She just shook her head at them fondly.
“Coffee. Please.” Ryan groaned, his brown hair sticking up every which way as he had clearly just rolled out of bed. Scott came forward and handed the extremely grateful man a cup of coffee and ruffled his hair before going back to get another cup as Mama Jem walked in, as pristine as if she had been up for hours, and she probably had, visiting the market to source fresh produce for her restaurant.
“I don’t want them to find me. One whisper, just one and then it will be all over. The press will swarm, and my quiet life will be a thing of the past. I don’t want any bloody magicals involved in my life. Even Teddy doesn’t know that I used to be Harry bloody Potter.” Evan spat, anger rising in him at the thought of how he had been misused by the magical press in the past.
He listened as the singer crooned, completely transfixed by the man. There was no denying the man was gorgeous, with shoulder-length dark hair caught in a messy tail at the back and a fit, so very fit body encased in a three-piece suit that was currently missing its jacket, showing off the beautiful black and red brocade vest.  He was hot enough to make even Draco, who always had his pick of partners, drool, but it was those lyrics that he sang so beautifully that really captured the blonde’s attention. He was caught between wanting to run away from the man who seemed to understand so much and a desperate desire to find out just who this stranger was who knew him so well.
The man was rather fit in his dark blue, pin-striped, three-piece muggle suit, and Evan couldn’t help admiring how well his former rival had grown up. He had certainly filled out in all the right places. Looking up to meet Malfoy’s eyes, he was surprised to see the other man giving him just as frank an appraisal. Evan himself had dressed semi-casually in fitting trousers and a white button-down shirt, with no tie or jacket. It looked like Malfoy liked what he saw as well. Evan flushed slightly and averted his eyes.
Draco didn’t reply, he just huffed and continued walking, ignoring any further attempts to talk until they reached the Leaky Cauldron and saw Ginny and Hermione.
Remus looked up, surprised. He hadn’t heard Evan ask about anyone in the wizarding world, ever. This was new, and he hoped that this was a sign that the Mind-Healer was helping. Even if most had been opportunists, there had still been a small number who had been true friends, and Remus had been sorry that Harry, now Evan, had let them go along with everyone else.
“Yes, yes it is.” He sighed smiling down at his boyfriend as he swallowed hard to get rid of the lump that had formed in his throat.
“I knew it! Never mind. Next year I’ll write you out a proper Christmas list.” He grinned before pushing his fiancé down onto the bed and straddling him.
Hermione hummed and looked back at the display turning over the clues in her head until she finally broke into a grin.
“Very good. Now come on. Breathe with me. In through your nose.” Scott said encouragingly. “And out through your mouth. There you go. That’s it.”
Harry still had no clue what his lover wanted for Christmas. No more clues had been forthcoming, at least not obviously enough for Harry to notice. Harry was sure that Draco would be obvious with his clues since he knew how oblivious his Harry could be on occasion.
Scott slung a companionable arm around Evan’s shoulders, and the two men walked into the room to be greeted by Angela Linton, Evan’s manager/agent. She had been the one who discovered him all those years ago and paid for music lessons and cosmetic surgery to correct his eyesight and get rid of the ‘horrendous’, according to her, glasses he used to wear. Without those, plus the mild glamour that changed and softened some of his features and hid his scar Evan was sure that nobody from his former life would ever recognise him. Evan owed her a lot for basically taking care of him and making sure that nobody in the music industry took advantage of him.
It brought back the madness and fear from his sixth year with the doomed mission Voldemort had given him and Potter stalking his every step. Draco was more sure than ever that he would have to meet the man. He needed to know who this man was who could so easily see into his very soul. It shouldn’t be too much of an issue since he had VIP passes to the after-party. He was very sure he would get to meet the singer there. He would make sure of it. Being a lawyer specializing in entertainment contracts definitely had some perks. Draco smirked to himself as he lost himself in the rest of the music. It was a wonderfully smooth, deep voice that caressed the notes and blended beautifully with the lyrics, and Draco had no doubts that the songs had been written by the singer and no other. He found himself shuddering with arousal as that beautiful voice seemed to caress his very soul.
George nodded understandingly, and Angelina smiled slightly at him, but she didn’t really move her focus from the drunk in the doorway.
“Ah, the decadent lifestyle of musicians. Waking up at noon and partying all night.” Draco commented, smirking teasingly.
Evan sighed and got out of bed. He was glad that his room had permanent silencing charms so he wouldn’t wake his cousin with his nightmares. It was enough that one of them was losing sleep. They didn’t need to share that as well. Especially as Scott had a job that required him to be alert and awake all day as opposed to Evan, who didn’t have anything on his schedule other than writing new music for the next couple of weeks.
Evan nodded and rested his head on his cousin’s shoulder. “I’ll think about it. And talk to Remus about the firm’s reputation in the wizarding world and everything.” He agreed tiredly.
“Think about it. There were wedding robes in the window. The broom ad was of a family, which is what he said he wanted. A diamond mine…..he wants a diamond. Yup, I think he wants you to ask him to marry him. I always knew Draco was smart. This way you know he’s going to say yes and he didn’t even have to directly ask you. Brilliant.” Hermione exclaimed grinning.
“Anyway. Let me know soon, alright. I don’t think he’s going to just let it go.” Angela said as she waved to them and left.
Harry had been sleeping rough, although his magic made it much more comfortable than would be expected, and he even missed the tent that they had used during the previous year. He was still warm and dry, if a little scruffy and hungry. He had been trying to find a place to sleep for the night outside a restaurant, believing that it was empty when the twins had seen him and believing him homeless and destitute had dragged him into the restaurant and fed him. That was where he had met mama Jem as well.
“You know, you could always get him to swear a magical vow of some kind if you need to. There’s something like that, right?” Scott pointed out as he leaned on the counter next to Evan.
, Mama Jem’s place. They had also no longer been Harry and Dudley but Evan and Scott, which had been almost a relief for both of them.
“Oh, he’s better, so much better in person.  And even better than his absolutely amazing talent is that he’s gorgeous. So damn beautiful I hope he’s not straight.” Draco sighed, leaning back in his chair and putting his feet up on the desk.
“So that’s why you told me not to make any deals with Malfoy and Granger?” Angela asked. She had been quietly listening to them for so long.
“Um, no. It was supposed to be a stag. I guess I’ve changed so much since I last cast that spell, so it changed?” Evan said, making it a question at the end even as the bird flew gracefully around the room.
“I can do most of it if you want. You just need to provide them with proof. You are getting better with the actual magic these days. With the visits from Teddy and the Lupins.” Scott said slowly.
“I get it, ok. I get why you didn’t say anything. It just stings a little that there was so much about you that we never knew.” Ryan said, sighing a little.
“In a minute. We’re waiting for Angela.” He replied. He had decided not to involve the Lupins as it might be better if it was just family. The Lupins were also family in a way, but they weren’t as close to Harry, and Teddy only knew Evan as his godfather and knew nothing of Evan’s previous life as Harry Potter.
It had been a fairly busy and cramped six months of four people sharing a flat meant for two people. If not for Harry’s surreptitious use of magic, they would never have been able to fit. But at the end of it, Dudley had managed to get a place at uni to study psychology despite his dismal record at Smeltings, and Harry was halfway through his studies for his GCSE and had been promoted to wait-staff at
“Good night then? Do we have a new client?” Hermione asked, smiling up at him from her desk as he passed on his way to his own office.
“Draco, then. And yes. I wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t want to know.” Draco drawled sarcastically.
“Hmm, mayyyybe. It’s a clue anyway.” Draco said turning in Harry’s arms to press a chaste kiss to his lover’s lips.
“Oh, he is. Now I just need to get him to speak to me. And not have to go through his manager for everything.” Draco remarked, his eyes pensive as he formulated strategies.
“Oh, but you are gorgeous, aren’t you. Those green eyes really do suit you better than the blue. Not that the blue is any less gorgeous, but the green really suits you. Couldn’t I convince you to go without the glamour then? Or maybe adjust it just a bit, so the eye colour stays the same. We can tell your fans you got contacts?” Angela asked, coming forward and tilting his face one way and another.
Making friends with the girl and figuring out she was just as lonely as he was without her two friends. Both boys had seemingly disappeared, Weasley into his grief and his family and the Golden Boy to parts unknown. Not even Hermione, for she was definitely Hermione now, knew where Potter had fucked off to. Nobody had heard from him in years, and as far as Draco knew, only his godson, Teddy, got birthday and Christmas presents from him.
“I’m fine. If I need to, I’ll come talk to you. Scout’s honour.” Evan said, feeding the owl another piece of bacon.
Draco allowed it. He knew how it went. Who among their generation didn’t have occasional nightmares. He pushed the folder towards Evan, tapping it with one long, pale finger. Evan nodded and pulled it towards him, opening it up to read through. He knew better than to sign anything without reading it.
For all his preparations, he had been completely unprepared for life in the muggle world. He had no ID and no degree. He had no way of even finding a proper job in the muggle world, and so six months after he had run away with his money rapidly running out and yet unwilling to admit defeat and contact Remus for more, he had run into the twins, Ridley and Ryan Jenkins.
“Hmm, maybe we can ask them to come by, and they can do the show part of the show and tell,” Evan answered wryly. “But, no. This is my responsibility. I can’t chance the Granger know-it-all figuring out who I am. And I’m pretty sure she will. So there’s no way I can do business with them. Malfoy on his own shouldn’t be too bad. He’s changed a lot, Tonks was saying. She’s his cousin, and he’s been visiting with them lately, she said.” Evan said with a shrug.
“Oh, um, what would you like to see?” Evan asked, stumped and trying hard to blink away his tears. He held out his hand and summoned his wand from his bedroom, where he had left it.
“It’s fine, Ms Linton. I understand. Musicians. Too much drink or drugs?” Draco returned derisively. He knew he had made a mistake when he saw the protective light of battle ignite in the woman’s eyes.
He had a feeling that solitude and a good bottle of firewhiskey would be what he needed to listen to the man’s music. And he was so very right.
“Oh, I know. I just never thought you’d admit it out loud.” Scott teased, ruffling Evan’s messy dark hair that was currently unbound and curling every which way despite its length. It seemed that even growing it long didn’t really tame the messiness unless it was bound back in a ponytail.
Harry had been feeling weird all day. Since the moment he got out of bed, he had been extremely restless, like something was off. His body was heavier than usual and he felt a bit feverish. Shrugging it off as the aftermath of staying up late for work the night before, Harry had started his day as usual. But, as the day progressed, the uncomfortable feeling just got worse.
He thought about one life he let himself dream of, a long time ago. The dream that was cruelly crushed and dumped to the ground by someone he trusted with his everything. And now that someone was no longer here, in this world.
Draco felt Harry clenched around him and he groaned from the pleasure, collapsing to bury his face in the crook of Harry’s shoulder. “Harry.”
He lost track of time. The whole world blurred beyond them, leaving just the two souls intertwining in their sacred ritual. In that moment, the pain they suffered in the past and would suffer again in the future stopped matter. It was just them, Harry and Draco, in the present, and in
This had got to be a prank. The Gryffindor bunch must be so bored out of their minds since McGonagall ruled the Eighth year students out of the Quidditch Cup and tried to find a new source of entertainment. Draco wouldn’t put it past them to see harassing a former Slytherin bully as a good laugh. He just hoped they thought of something better than sending the Saviour himself to deliver impossibly bad jokes to him.
Draco gingerly took his journal from the crate. With slightly trembling fingers, he opened the cover page of it, and a little metal thing fell to the ground. Puzzled, Draco picked it up.
“Seems like the git is rubbing off on me.” Ron chuckled and fondly shook his head. “No one is surprised, Harry. The two of you have been obsessed with each other
He tightened his arms around his boyfriend. His heart hammered into his ribcage as the guilt immediately tripled. “But I’m here now, right?”
Draco scowled harder. “I don’t think it’s any of your business, Potter,” he muttered, managing to keep his voice even.
Obviously, Harry hadn’t been paying any attention to his class, so he was startled out of his mind when Slughorn suddenly appeared at his table with his hands on his hips. Harry’s hand slipped and the contents of his vial was splashed onto his face. The glass vial dropped to the ground and broke with a loud noise so that everyone’s eyes were suddenly on him.
Draco’s lips twitched at the corner but his perfect composure remained. “Why, Harry, of course I had to,” he said. “And just so you know, it’s not brown. It’s very dark green, the colour of wet moss.” Draco couldn’t contain a small chuckle as he corrected him, dropping his posh mask.
Draco obeyed without question, tugging a string in Harry’s heart from the trust. Gently, Harry let go of his left hand he had been holding and outstretched the arm. He took the gift out and paused for a few seconds, stealing glances at Draco while the blond had his eyes shut.
“She said the prince’s hair is so soft,” she translated. “And she will definitely brag to her friends about touching your hair.”
“You should’ve come to my room, Father. You told me to come to your room whenever I have a bad dream.”
“I like to cement the moments of my life when I thought things couldn’t be any worse,” Draco said slowly, “so that every time I had a bad day, I could read it and tell myself I survived something bigger before. If I thought my day was worse than what I had written, then I would write it down in case I survived again and I need to look back in the future.”
Astoria eyes the couple again, her face unreadable. “Well, we can’t ask the deceased for an explanation, can we? Let’s just be reasonable and move on,” she said flatly, her tone impassive.
Gita pulled her wand and waved it around in a wide circular motions. Quite fascinated, Draco watched as lines started forming on the grass, making a considerably big rectangle with a tiny square in one corner. “So this will be your court, everyone in the game stays inside the lines. That square is where the players will have to stack the piring,” Gita continued to explain. “Oh, and the opponents can’t move with the ball. They have to either hit the player on their spot or pass the ball to their team member.”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed again. It was about time someone brought that up. He was sure Weasley and Granger wouldn’t be delighted with the truth.
Harry responded by clenching his ass on nothing, and yes, he was just as slick—if not more than before. “
“Will you believe my argument now or do we have to go for another round?” Draco asked eventually, bringing up their debate from earlier. “Because honestly, I need a respite. Maybe
Harry felt Draco’s breath against his neck, soft and calming. “I used some intense persuasion to get my way.”
It was, as many disasters in Harry’s life, preluded by Hermione’s wrath. This time, however, the wrath was not at all uncalled for.
Draco knew his attempt of answering the question himself would only lead to more questions arising. Resolutely, he flipped to the next page.
Harry snorted a laugh, partly because of Malfoy’s words, but mostly because of the utter disbelief in his face. “Maybe because it is not jewelry? It’s a toy. A Muggle one.”
It was so frustrating because even though Malfoy clearly had nothing to do with him, Harry’s body refused to understand. All it cared about was to react to that strong scent Malfoy was exuding. A scent that only Harry could smell.
The trip back to Ajawera was mostly uneventful. Draco felt like he was navigating himself from the Manor in Wiltshire all the way to this small village so far away almost full in autopilot. It didn’t feel real—his return to this place—until Draco saw the first sight of vast rice fields under the bright sunlight and people tending to them with delicate magic. After his lung inhaled a greedy gulp of clean air that was dense with ancient magic, the fact that Draco was here again finally dawned upon him. Finding that everything was still very familiar for him, he made his way through the village’s narrow paths.
“I did, didn’t I?” Draco sighed in a mocking tone of regret. He put his hand on top of Harry’s chest, feeling his rapid heartbeat gradually return normal. “But if I’m honest, it’s pretty crazy how we are here now, forty years old husbands living a normal life,” he said quietly. “There was one point in my life I was so convinced I had no chance to grow old. Growing old with
But, not five minutes later, something stopped Harry in his tracks. Malfoy who was close on his tail bumped into his back.
“That’s even more suspicious,” Granger said, frowning more deeply. “Why would Harry leave you with his personal belongings?”
Little did Hermione know, her teasing became a jinx because Harry did fall over right at the start of the aisle, as soon as his eyes landed on the figure waiting for him on the other end. He tripped and fell face first from the sight of Draco, his soon-to-be-husband, looking extremely breathtaking in his fitting navy suit, his hair—now almost shoulder-length—was styled elegantly back with just the slightest waves framing his face.
It also took Harry some time to understand Draco’s love language. He was not vocal about his feelings, apart from disagreements, and tended to be closed off towards Harry. He later found out it had to do with his rigid pureblood upbringing in which showing something, especially as vulnerable as love, was frowned upon. So, without vocal expression and grand gestures, Harry learned to note the small details when Draco’s feelings would show.
As he stared at the vast ocean, Draco felt the tiny waves crashing at his feet, as though trying to calm the storm raging in his chest. As though Harry, now part of the sea, was soothing him. The thought brought a small smile on Draco’s face.
Malfoy clearly didn’t expect the compliment. He flushed a little—a pretty pink shade, Harry thought absently—and curved a pleased smile. “Thank you, Granger.”
He glanced at Harry, humming an off-key tune as he walked. Absently, Draco thought the Potters could really use this magic in the First Wizarding War. If only Harry’s parents could Apparate baby Harry to safety, away from the Dark Lord in his plan to end him, maybe he wouldn't have ended up as The Boy Who Lived. Maybe the First War would end differently. But no, Lily Potter had to sacrifice herself to protect her son.
.” Draco flopped to his back on the grass after the last child was gone, his voice was still breathless from the exertion. “I hope that helps you learn your place, Potty.”
And something shifted, too, between Malfoy and the Golden Trio. It was as if being trusted by Harry had given him a green light to step up their friendship. Harry could feel it, the difference happened in the blond’s behaviour around them. There was something softer in it, warmer. Their interactions became more intimate instead of simply practical. It was like Malfoy had allowed himself to
Oh, how Draco wanted to pull his hair out at that moment. Or maybe Potter’s hair. He didn’t understand what was happening, what Potter’s motivation was that kept him determined to tell Draco his crappy jokes. If the fact that he was completely clueless about the whole ordeal was not enough to drive him mad, Potter’s lack of understanding of humour was certainly sufficient for that.
It had been a long day. Draco made a little mistake in Potions class and Slughorn was not holding himself back from going in on him. He knew better than to expect anything more from Slughorn, no matter how ridiculous his teacher had been. He had set his cauldron just a tad too hot, making his potion boil before it was supposed to, and Slughorn wasn’t hesitant in the slightest to tell him how much of a failure his project was, completely discrediting every perfect piece of work he had done in his class until now.
When Malfoy finally turned his head to Harry after a pause, he didn’t look angry anymore. His grey eyes only seemed tired. “It’s okay, really. It’s—it’s whatever, okay?  You don’t have to apologize, but I would truly appreciate it if you stop doing that from now on.”
He reached out to caress his long fingers on Harry’s cheek and leaned forward to kiss him, covered in batter and all. Harry, still dazed from the revelation, kissed him back breathlessly.
Harry sobbed, he was so hard and his body was getting tired. He was almost there, the climax was right in front of him, but it was somehow still out of reach. “I can’t,” he cried, desperate for the release. “Please, so close.”
Draco Malfoy was chatting with Hagrid, his posture looked casual enough but his pointy face had a solemn expression on it. Harry couldn’t hear what Malfoy said from where he was standing, but whatever it was, it prompted a big, hearty laugh from the half-giant he was talking to, attracting attention from a few students.
“Of course,” he replied firmly. “It’s… we haven’t been friends with him for long. It’s… it feels a bit awkward when he is all down and sad while we don’t know what to do about it. Just try asking him, yeah? Work something out.” He cast a sideways glance at Harry. “And maybe do something about your crush on him while you’re at it?”
“Ah, that one is just like Apparition. The kids think of the place and the magical link will let the parents know about the location. If they approve, the parents will send their kids there, and bring them back again when they think about their home. Or when it’s their time to go home, I guess.”
Malfoy laughed softly. “You better try asking that to Granger. Also, please tell her and Weasley about your problem while you’re at it.” He pulled him up from his bed and stirred him to the door of their room. “Now go.”
“I know it! The cold doesn’t bother you because you secretly have this ice power but you’re hiding it,” he went on. “How does it go…
Draco inspected the bludger-like ball in Gita’s hand and furrowed his brows. “The ball seems quite… unique?”
“Mother told me. An Auror on the shift in Azkaban did it, apparently for some kind of revenge. They fired the Auror, obviously, for professional misconduct, but the Ministry is hiding the details of the death, saying to the public Lucius died in an accident. They have the reputation of Auror force to keep after all,” he said in such an impassive tone so perfect that Harry knew he was faking it.
Despite the tasty feast, Malfoy was frowning. Scowling, really, at his breakfast. The furrow between his brows was obvious even for Harry who had been silently observing him from across the Great Hall. Beside the blonde, Parkinson was chattering, likely to herself, with some enthusiastic hand gestures that Malfoy only responded to with occasional absent-minded nods. Harry wondered what Malfoy was thinking; what gave him such a long face so early in the morning.
Suddenly, Malfoy leaned his body over Harry, his pale neck barely an inch from Harry’s nose. A silent invitation to breathe in his scent.
Malfoy still seemed like he was considering leaving but then something flashed in his eyes, something like a determination, and he marched all the way to where they were sitting.
“I said I’m—,” Harry's sentence was cut as a shudder ran through his body from his proximity with Malfoy, making him double over. He wanted to just curl up on the stone floor and die of embarrassment as his cock throbbed under his robe.
He kneeled in front of Harry and hauled him up back to his feet, his lean body showing off the unexpected strength. He put a steadying hand on his arm. “You really made me go down on one knee twice just to marry you, huh? You’re playing very hard to get, Harry,” he said mirthfully, the edges of his eyes crinkling.
"It was you, wasn't it? Potter’s trusted acquaintance," he asked with barely any preamble, quoting Engel’s words.
“I’m glad,” said Draco, ruffling his son’s curly platinum hair. “Actually, I have another gift for you. Not as great as the broom, of course.”
The sun was steadily shifting to the west when Gita led them to a wide gazebo made entirely from wood, located between a vast rice field and an empty ground. In the gazebo, around twenty children from various ages were waiting for her, sitting leisurely cross-legged on the wooden floor. As Draco walked toward them, he observed that they were cheerfully chatting with each other in a language Draco recognized as the local tongue. The sight was somewhat picturesque, just a bunch of happy kids gathering with a stunning background of all green.
Draco looked up to find a teenage girl walking carefully toward him. She was quite short, but her skinny figure made her look taller than she actually was. Upon catching Draco’s eyes, the girl gave him a tentative smile. Something about that expression felt so familiar to Draco.
However, even that simple wish was crushed as soon as he voiced it to his partner before their departure.
Still amused, Harry reached out to pat his shoulder before walking away, leading their investigation with a pleased smile on his face. Malfoy was right, they had to finish sweeping the entire area before dark and the temperature dropped even lower.
Maybe it had something to do with their different traits. Harry had been so used to people around him acting bold and straightforward in showing their feelings. Like Hermione earlier when she dragged Harry for an angry interrogation after she witnessed the Potions essay incident. He didn’t mind. That had been the only way he knew how people cared about him for a long time, even since the first time he knew anyone cared about him at all. But maybe the straightforward actions hindered them from reading more about what's beneath the surface. Preventing them to stop and discover what’s hidden.
“Dinner’s on me,” Harry finished his joke with a grin, ignoring the unimpressed look Draco gave him and the thick air of confusion blanketing the Slytherin table.
“As you can probably tell,” Malfoy said, his tone conversational despite the rough edge in his voice after the intense sex. “I can’t pull out yet. It might get a bit uncomfortable after a while, I hope you don’t mind.”
And it was so much better than he expected. Teaching was quite simple and surprisingly very rewarding. He loved being around young witches and wizards discovering the wonder of magic in the very castle he always considered his home. The youthful spirit of Hogwarts, filled with both innocence and mischief, was something that Harry could only feel and relish now that he was an adult. Not to mention he got to teach the subject which had always interested him at the same time deeply exploring the intricate art of it.
Harry wanted to be a reason for Malfoy to smile like that again. It was normal to want a smile on your friend’s face, right? For now, Harry was sure he wanted to be Malfoy’s friend. The warm feeling in his chest whenever the blonde was near might indicate something else, something stronger, and Harry would love to explore it if Malfoy gave him a chance.
It took Malfoy three seconds to process Harry’s words—Harry mentally counted it. And when the words finally seeped in, Harry witnessed as a blush slowly crept onto Malfoy’s pale cheeks. The shade gradually grew darker as the pinkish blush ended up almost beet red by the ninth count. It was such a stunning sight that Harry had to look away with his racing heart.
Draco kept staring at him, completely floored, as if he talked in Parseltongue. After what felt like a minute of baffled silence, Draco abruptly huffed a laugh. The laugh gradually grew louder until the blond wizard was cackling from his belly.
Suddenly having Molly in the room raised Harry’s anxiety level up to several degrees. It meant it’s almost time to go. ”Er—thanks, Molly. You’re very gorgeous as well,” he said faintly.
When McGonagall decided to room him with Malfoy during his return to the Eighth year, Harry was bracing himself for the inevitable disaster that was bound to happen.
That just made Harry want him more than ever. After that night, Harry finally accepted the sexual attraction he had for Malfoy. It was so much easier to admit your desire when you knew it wasn’t directed toward a bad person. Malfoy had turned to be a different man than the snobby teenager he was and Harry wanted to know him better.
A smile formed on his face as the strange realization hit him. He felt a lot better than before, warmth spread from his core to every inch of his body. Just like the Snow Queen, Malfoy’s kiss numbed him to the cold.
Hermione, hands playing with her own slap bracelet, observed the two of them in silence. Her eyes glinted with a calculating look. “Why are you still Malfoy?” she asked absently, almost to herself.
“Can we start walking again or you’re still not done regretting your stupid life choices?” Malfoy said impatiently, bringing him back to the present time. The question was evidently rhetorical as he set off without waiting for Harry’s answer.
Draco didn’t try to decipher him. He hadn’t, for a long time. He couldn’t remember the last time he hoped to make sense of this man, but it had been too long. He knew if Harry had any intention to share, he would. But it had been almost five years since they started this arrangement, their secret meetings, and Harry never left a crack open for Draco to see what’s inside.
A small pang of jealousy bloomed in Harry’s chest from the image of Draco cuddling with Parkinson or Zabini. He quickly shook it off and mentally scolded himself. It was inappropriate, being jealous of Draco’s friends. The ones he was currently missing, at that. Instead, he tried to focus on the body in his arm. Thinking on ways to comfort the mourning boy.
Draco wanted to point out that he was certainly not Alice, but it seemed to be an insignificant thing to say when Potter was in front of him pretending to knock on an imaginary door. He might as well be an imaginary character if he wanted.
What welcomed him was an almost empty vault with just small heaps of coins in one corner, next to them was a stack of wooden crates. Draco knew the Potters weren’t nearly as wealthy as the Malfoys used to be, but he knew there should have been more than this.
Gently—in contrast to the almost feral expression on his face—Harry ran both his palms down Draco’s torso, making the man shudder. He caressed Draco’s chest and sternum, down to his flat belly, tracing every single scar he once left there. Draco could feel those hands tremble slightly.
He mentally cursed himself for letting his thoughts stray and cleared his throat lamely. “So yeah, I present to you, a slap bracelet.”
“Good morning, Scorpius.” Draco landed a peck on the crown of Scorpius’s head. “Ready for breakfast?”
If only Malfoy would let him. The Potions professor hadn’t been avoiding him once again, this time even more relentlessly, making sure he wouldn’t cross paths with Harry despite how much Harry tried to corner him.
“Well, yeah… I mean, no. I want to thank you, yes, but it’s not why I’m here.” Harry gulped when he saw Malfoy raise his brow in question. “I’m here to take you up on your offer.”
Sitting on top of a hill as the sun set for the day, head filled with memories of Harry’s green eyes twinkling with adoration, Draco could only relish the warmth of
If he asked to stay, Harry would let him, right? After all, Draco had convinced himself that one unreadable emotion in Harry’s green eyes was love. It had to mean something.
“Yes, a local game. I think you’d like it,” Gita said with a grin. She clapped her hands and raised her voice to get the children’s attention, then she talked in her language, complemented by broad hand gestures. Draco of course didn’t understand her words, but her students surely did as they erupted in loud cheers and hurriedly ran to the empty ground next to the gazebo.
“Gorgeous dress,” Draco breathed, looking back and forth between Gita and her mother. “Both of you look amazing.”
“What’s the big deal? You’re just gonna walk down the aisle, say your vow, and then the ceremony is basically over. You’ll be ready to be off Britain with the ferret face for the rest of your life. Or at least for as long as your honeymoon lasts,” Ron grinned and wiggled his eyebrows. “A full month across Europe, Harry! That’s just so very Malfoy of him.”
Without waiting for a response, Draco stormed out of the hallway, leaving a dumbfounded Potter behind. As he walked away, Draco cursed himself and his traitorous, rapidly beating heart—the sight of Potter’s earnest eyes still etched in his mind.
Draco looked around him to the people sitting in a small circle, Harry and Maya on each side of him. The night was warm but breezy, a perfect time to have a relaxed dinner outside. Draco didn’t visit someone’s house often—the Malfoys liked to entertain guests more than being one—but every time he did in the past, it was always a stiff and formal occasion when he had to pay extra attention to his table manner or his father would scold him as soon as they were back in the Manor. Never in his wildest dream Draco thought of a dinner invitation when they all sat on the woven mat on the floor and just openly laughed between their meals.
means prince. She said you look like a prince from a fairytale with that blond head of yours. She wants to touch your hair to see if it's real.”
would mean for them at the moment. They stared and stared, until one of them—Draco couldn’t be sure who—leaned into the little space left between them. It might be both at the same time, or one prompted by the other to meet in the middle, but it didn’t matter as soon as Draco felt the soft press of Harry’s lips on his.
Harry laughed again, quietly. Draco hadn’t been an hour in this foreign place but he already loved it. There was something here that shifted whatever was between the two of them. Maybe it was the air, or the tropical heat, or the fact that no one here knew or cared about who they were. The liberated feeling was reflected in the easy way Potter laughed, how much he smiled, his light posture, and Draco could feel it affecting him as well.
Draco tightened the grip in his hands as his face broke into the most brilliant smile Harry ever saw. The grey eyes gleamed in raw emotions. Happiness, contentment, pride.
Harry didn’t get what he wanted at first, then Draco tugged his hand again, firmer this time, so Harry was pulled to shift next to him. Understanding, he moved to climb the bed, the mattress dipped with his weight. He shuffled awkwardly until he sat close next to the blond.
Harry laughed harder, making his whole body shake in his playful mirth. “Well, blame yourself. You signed up for it.”
It took Harry no less than ten seconds to kick his brain into functioning again. Snapping himself out of his dazed state, he scrambled to follow the graceful steps of Draco Malfoy, slipping on the slippery snow and almost falling for the fourth time that afternoon.
The four of them sat together in the common room, surrounded by a few piles of books as they always did every evening these days. Malfoy, true to his words, helped Harry catch up with his studying, patiently explaining everything Harry didn’t understand and assisting him in organizing his goals. Tonight, though, Harry was left on his accord to write a review work on his Charm lesson while Malfoy worked on his own assignment. Hermione was deep in her Arithmancy book and Ron lounged next to her since he finished his work of the day early, as unusual as it was.
All that form of self-reliance fascinated Draco. He never realized the complicated way his society operated back in England until he threw himself to this place where everything was so simple. Everyone seemed to naturally possess powerful magic, as it was the one thing that kept them going for so long.
Hermione hummed. “Yeah, that would be very useful for our Charm project. I think I saw some books on that topic, I’ll get them next time I go to the library.” She pulled out her quill and began to scribble a reminder on the back of her palm like she always did.
When those warm fingers found their way to touch the cold skin in his hips, Draco pushed away breathlessly. “Inside,” he gasped.
Draco remembered when Harry told him to try that with his own child one day. And Draco finally did it.
Malfoy gave him another skeptical look before relenting and taking the spot by Harry’s side. “Here, let me help you walk,” he said, circling his arm around Harry’s waist to support him.
Grinspoon’s speech went on and on and Harry considered a few ways to get away before he hexed the man’s balls off. Just as Harry thought the man was done spouting bullshit, Grinspoon started bringing his “unfortunate childhood” into his lecture and Harry was one breath away from losing his cool when someone appeared beside him.
“But you’re obviously in pain, what…,” Malfoy trailed off, giving Harry a careful once over, from the sweat on his temples to his shivering body. Harry watched as a realization slowly dawned upon him, his grey eyes widened impossibly. “
Just as the heat in his body crept dangerously near his crotch and Harry’s rational mind decided to bolt out of the room, a voice was heard from his side.
“Then what would you do on those rainy days?” Harry whispered, leaning in to press their foreheads together.
The beach was as beautiful as Draco remembered from the first time they visited it, the blue of the ocean complemented by the scarlet shade in the sky as the sun crept to the west. The whole place was also as empty, the only sound that could be heard was the crashing of waves and the rustling of strong wind. As they walked hand in hand on the soft sand without a word, Draco pondered how similar this was to the time they stepped on this beach.
But, of course, things could always be worse for Draco. From the corner of his eye, Draco saw a mop of unruly dark hair emerging from the end of his supposedly empty hallway. He tried to bite down a groan. Draco was too tired to run away from Potter right now. Maybe Potter was just walking by, he hoped silently as he slumped in his stance.
He didn’t realise the severity of this problem right until Slughorn almost kicked him out of class for not doing his work and Hermione made it her top priority to get him to understand how
"Salazar, Harry," he says, eyes glinting fiercely with mirth, slight surprise, and pure delight. "If I knew that a bit of highlighter and lipgloss is all it takes to seduce you, I'd have put them on much sooner."
“Ron!” Hermione shoved his shoulder but she herself was visibly holding back a laugh from the image. Harry, on the other hand, was openly laughing with Ron.
Scorpius’s room reminded him of the one he had in his childhood, partly because he intentionally built it on the same side of the Manor so the window faced the same area of his garden that he loved the most, and partly because he decorated it himself while remembering the little things he liked from his old room. Morning light streamed into the room through the wide window, illuminating the soft blue wall with various constellations painted on them. Many toys were scattered on the plush carpet, a pair of mini broomstick figures were still hovering from the ground—Astoria had forgotten to deactivate the spell again last night.
Yes, Harry was an omega, and it wasn’t the first time the scent of an alpha had enticed him, but it was never exactly like this before. No scent, not from an alpha—or anyone, had made Harry feel a desire so fierce and overwhelming. No one had made Harry almost lose every single shred of his self-control like Malfoy and his very alluring scent.
It was seven years ago. Draco should have known it was too much to ask for him to move on and leave everything in the past.
He felt Harry almost scrambled to reach for his hand, gripping it in his. One glance at Harry’s face was enough to tell him that Harry felt the same thing, the green eyes were wide open in wonder and disbelief. Draco scooted closer to press the side of his body to Harry’s until he couldn’t tell who was shivering from the two of them. Maybe they were both shivering at this point, not at all because the winds got colder as the sun retreated, but because of the raw power of magic surrounding them.
Both of them were sitting on the floor, cross-legged, on the wide porch of Maya’s house. Maya’s mother, a woman in her early thirties, had been insistently offering them their third helping of rice and spicy chicken despite Draco’s polite refusal.
“Wait, wait,” Potter blurted out, putting his hand on top of Draco’s parchment to prevent him from packing it into his bag. “Where do baby cows eat lunch?”
And that's why Harry and Draco sat shoulder to shoulder on the couch watching a YouTube video that evening. Draco seemed to be very fascinated, asking Harry about all foreign icons on the website (
But of course his friends didn’t understand. They wouldn’t. They didn’t have the same mission as Harry did at the moment. Deciding to ignore his friends, Harry glanced across the hall again, only to find Malfoy pushing his barely touched plate away, like he was done with his breakfast. Harry couldn’t have him leave just yet. He had to move fast.
He shook his head, looking lost again. “I—” he sighed. “It’s… quite complicated. Things with Father.”
Like tonight. They both attended a Ministry gala, and, as most people knew, Harry hated this kind of formal event so much. Everyone would somehow think it was completely acceptable to harass him with their opinion on him. Whether it was false admiration of his heroic deeds, or blatant disappointment when they realised Harry didn’t live up to their impossibly high expectations. He reached the point where he couldn't even tell which he hated more.
A couple of weeks later, Harry has been thinking that there's something different from Draco. Subtle, but Harry notices nonetheless. And that's
Harry hummed and rested his cheek on the blond head. “Did you really come all the way back from South Korea just to yell at me?”
Ron shook his head in disbelief and let out a low laugh. “Merlin, you’re really obsessed with that Muggle toy, aren’t you?”
“I don’t know, Potter,” he said slowly, trying not to raise his voice and offend this newly mental wizard in front of him. He wasn’t sure how dangerous it was if someone as magically powerful as Potter got his head damaged—and Draco didn’t want to chance it. “Please let go of my parchment.”
Instead of answering, Draco circled his arms around Harry’s neck to pull him closer, deepening the kiss. Soon, Harry’s thrusts started to falter as he went deeper and faster, indicating he was getting close. He sneaked his hand between their bodies to reach for Draco’s cock, jerking him off in sync with his hips.
Quietly, Maya studied his expression and shifted closer to put her warm hand on Draco’s arm, her black eyes shining with concern. “You miss him, too, right?” she asked. “I also miss Harry. You’re not alone. You have everyone here.”
“Well, that sounds like an irresponsible thing to do if you put it that way.” Gita frowned a little, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. “But like I said, it was not exactly Apparition. The protection bond between parents and children is so easy and natural to use once it was formed. We don’t even use a wand to perform it.”
Harry was so happy to hear him genuinely laughed that he almost forgot to respond. He grinned widely. “I’m not exactly famous for being good with words, am I?”
He didn’t seem interested in exchanging more pleasantries. Malfoy quickly turned to Parkinson again. “Pans, I think I should—”
“I… I saw you in the Owlery one night—and I didn’t mean to stalk or anything, I just happened to find you there when I was wandering the castle. And you… you laughed with the owls that night. Like, a genuine laugh.” Harry paused, wondering if he even made any sense. “I want to hear that again.”
Maybe it was in his blood. Did the Malfoys originate from the Arctic? This one certainly looked like he belonged in the eternal winter. The color of his hair was so light it was almost matching the pure whiteness of the snow around them. Hell, it’s not just his hair, everything about Malfoy was icily pale. His eyes were a shade of grey Harry never saw in anyone else, and his skin was so fair it almost seemed translucent under bright light. And now he was wearing all grey attire as though he was intentionally trying to blend in.
“Of course, the Portkey here is only registered for local administration. No one could get that data to know we are here.”
Draco squeezed his eyes again, tempering his outburst. “You panicked. Of course. Of course, Potter, your natural survival instinct will choose the most dangerous and grandiose escape from death. How could I forget, you refuse to think about anything until it’s already happened.”
"What is a concealer, Harry? What will it conceal?" Draco asked after pausing the video for the 14th time—and they're only two minutes in.
Once the goblin opened the door with a small gold key, Engel gestured him inside. “After you, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Ah, right, so the ball is magically created for children games like this. You can throw it as hard as you want and you won’t hurt the person who gets hit. Though, it will give you a temporary purple stain to make sure you can’t pretend it misses you.”
Harry’s grin widened. Malfoy could act impassive and untouchable all he wanted at work, but he knew the blond had a special soft spot for his cousin. He could never deny the child anything he asked, and Harry was amused to find out that Teddy asked
Harry seemed to catch on and hurriedly fumbled with his pockets, trying to find the key without taking one of his hands off Draco’s waist. Draco watched him produce the key after a long rummaging and struggled to open the lock, clumsily dropping the key to the ground after his failed second try. Growling in frustration, Harry bent down to pick it up.
“If only I hadn’t realized my sexuality when I was twelve, Professor Malfoy would surely have been my gay awakening,” said a Hufflepuff boy to his friend, both of them casually leaning on a wall.
fascinated? He explained that he got it from a Muggle toy shop as a bonus when he bought some gifts for Teddy. He didn’t give it to his godson as he thought the baby was too young for that kind of toy. At that, Malfoy hummed and slapped it onto his own wrist a few times. Eventually, he declared in a very solemn tone that
Malfoy nodded again and turned to Harry. “I was about to show you something.” He eyed the mostly empty parchment on Harry’s lap and frowned. He no doubt knew Harry forgot his homework. Again. “But you seem busy right now. See you later?”
fitting. He couldn’t be sure if Harry chose this place with such a name on purpose, going as far as finding a small island right on the equator line just to find an escape that had a mockingly suitable name. Either way, Draco loved this village already.
Draco absently thought how it should have scared him how he could instantly understand Harry’s vague question, how he could almost read his mind when they snuggled close like this. “I don’t know, sixth year? Fifth? Maybe even before that, but I only fully realized it after the whole Voldemort business escalated,” he answered, his tone was surprisingly light like it never before when he spoke about the war.
. The glow is not blinding or anything, but it's certainly unmistakable. Especially now when Draco grins at the small banter he's having with the waiter. His cheekbone is raised with all its shining glory.
“You! To your left!” Draco shouted to a little boy from his team, not caring if he might not understand what he said. The boy dodged the shot just in time.
Trying to keep up, Harry fell down for the third time that afternoon with a yelp, the soft snow welcomed him with open arms. From where his limbs were heaped on the ground, he heard Malfoy sigh, long and impatient, as if his partner's suffering was too much of a bother for him. Despite that, Malfoy offered his gloved hand to help him up.
His thrusts were getting harder, almost desperate. Harry pulled himself up to his elbows on each of Draco’s head, pressing their foreheads together. Against his lips, he whispered, “call me by your name.”
When it was over, Draco didn’t rush to swim back to the surface. Who would have known drowning could be so blissful? Harry lazily cast a quick Scourgify on their sticky bodies before slumping over Draco, lying his head on Draco’s still erratic heart.
The intensity of fingers in his arse and delicious sucking on his cock soon became too much to handle. Draco felt his climax building fast, low in his belly. He tried to suppress another wave of shudder.
The green eyes stared straight at Draco, the gleam unreadable. “But wouldn’t it be nice to also write down good memories to be remembered?”
“Merlin, Harry,” he tried to speak in the middle of his roaring laughter. “You almost gave me a heart attack, you look like you just murdered someone. What on earth are you thinking?”
Hermione was regarding the invention with her curious eyes. “That's fine spellwork, Malfoy,” she said eventually.
“I don’t think I even know how much is ‘learning enough’,” he said, a bit put out but still intrigued by the idea of not forcing himself to study everything.
This time, Draco felt invincible. He wanted to stop borrowing time for them to be together. Right here, right now, Draco was ready to steal it all, to own it, to let them have
—he would play chess with Ron, and casually tease him for losing as though they had been doing it throughout their schooling years.
that another row of laughter erupted from the guests. “But falling for each other we did, because what are we if not a pair of rebels? We were done living for other people. We had enough of that. Now is time for us. Together. For as long as we’ll have each other.” He stared intensely into Harry’s eyes, baring his soul. “We both have the craziest, messiest lives anyone could ever imagine, and it’s likely won’t be any easier from here. It’s you and me after all.” He grinned slightly. “But we have each other now, and I vow to walk with you through our imperfect lives, today, tomorrow, and until we can’t walk any further.”
Harry did not know before, but he did now. And he relished the way that knowledge made him the happiest in a very long time, even more than when he had discovered he loved Draco.
It could have been funny, if only Malfoy’s scent, suddenly flooding Harry’s senses, didn’t feel like a punch to Harry’s gut. He doubled over in pain, biting his lip to muffle a cry from the violent blow. In the next seconds, he felt the temperature of his body rise quickly.
Harry didn’t realize he was still ogling at his partner until the pair of eyebrows he was indiscreetly staring at with an absent thought of
It started by being civil with one another, as they had Harry as a mutual friend and it was a standard rule of decency to be tolerably nice to your friend’s friends. They greeted each other awkwardly and tried some tentative talks at first. But really, it didn’t take Malfoy very long to fit into more comfortable and friendly dynamics with them.
What should someone do when their crush was inches away and asking for a kiss? Harry didn’t know, so he just nodded, stunned and a little more than dazed.
Thankfully, Malfoy obliged, adding his second and then third finger. Without words, he fucked Harry open with his fingers, stretching, and prodding. Like the fingers on Harry’s cock, the ones in his ass were just as efficient, every thrust brought a wave of pleasure rippling all over his body. Harry shivered in pleasure.
Gathering his Gryffindor courage, he slipped his hand between Draco’s fingers. The immediate grasp that answered him was a great relief. Draco turned to him with a little lopsided smile.
Maya’s mother furrowed her eyebrows and pushed the plate of her chicken in red sauce closer to Draco, her black hair waving as she shook her head and talked in her language. Gita snickered a bit before she translated, “she said you look so skinny and need to be fed more.”
His question was cut short as Harry suddenly had his mouth on his, kissing him deeply. Harry’s hand shot up to Draco’s jaw, tilting his head a little to allow him to deepen the kiss. His other hand was on his hip, urging Draco to roll on his side for a more comfortable position. Soon, Draco let his own hands roamed Harry’s body in return, lifting his shirt a little, making the grass below them tickle his skin.
It took Draco a few seconds to understand that Gita had commanded her students to choose the team they wanted, and the result was somewhat unbalanced. Most of the girls wanted to be in the same group as Draco, while most boys chose Harry—either because they didn’t want to follow the girls or because they thought having Harry as their team leader would be more beneficial, which was kind of insulting to Draco. He might not look as strong as Harry at a glance, but he was confident he could beat the man in a ball game.
But then his brain registered what Neville just said and Harry stared at him with a frown of confusion. What kind of question was that? Of course, there was something wrong, Malfoy was sitting with the other teachers as if he belonged here!
The whole classroom was silent for a moment until Hermione broke it with her shriek, “Harry, your face!”
Harry smirked, coming up to face him. “You need more stamina to keep up with this old man, darling husband.”
It was not hard to fall even harder for this whimsical village. Ajawera was nothing like anywhere Draco knew before. It was located in the middle of Indonesia’s most popular tourism destination, but this village was very obscured and secluded. Draco and Harry were the only visitors at the moment. The Balinese wizarding community was so small, only comprised roughly one thousand wizards and witches living together in their relatively vast land, almost fully self-subsistent. Living in the fertile land of Agung mountain’s valley, they grew their crops for personal consumption using intricate farming spells and charms, independently brewed the Potions to cure their sickness, and created practically anything they needed by themselves.
“Thank you.” Harry tried to smile but it mostly came out as a grimace and he hugged George quickly, tapping his back. “You’re going to be okay. I know it’s hard and it hurts but it gets easier with time.”
i hope you enjoyed! it was very short, sorry :( but its mostly a transition to the second act of the story. next chapter is going to be... pretty eventful. hehe
After combing through his hair – which was, as always, unnecessary – he went back to the room and the three friends apparated to the Ministry. The security was reinforced, there were guards everywhere and everyone was controlled with very expensive looking objects in case some of Voldemort’s fanclub members wanted to get revenge for their master. Harry and his friends, who had been nicknamed the “Golden Trio” by the Prophet, walked to the Department of Mysteries, where the trials were to take place, and Harry stepped inside, not sure if he was ready to testify, but telling himself it was going to be fine.
“I don’t despise you, Malfoy, stop being such a drama queen. I wouldn’t have saved your ass during your trial if I despised you. You saved my life.”
“How was your vacation?” Ginny asked him, looking at him with kind eyes and a soft smile. Merlin, Harry had missed her. Though they weren’t together anymore, she was one of the few people who always brought out the best in him, who made him feel so safe and cared for. They didn’t always understand each other, but they tried, and she really was one of the most important people in Harry’s life.
“I understand. But I think they mostly get close to you to get a better look at me. I mean, I’m pretty handsome.” He said smugly.
“Harry! Ron! Guys, I’m so happy to see you.” Neville exclaimed as he walked towards them and gave a quick side hug to each of them. He looked good and healthy, though a small scar could be seen on his eyebrow, a reminder of his bravery. “Bill and Fleur are just over there.” He gave a nod towards the entrance of the Great Hall where, indeed, the married couple were talking with Professor Sinistra. “And I think I saw Percy and Penelope somewhere.” They chatted for some minutes, and then Neville left to go find Hannah Abbott.
When they entered the castle, however, it was different. People were staring at the reconstruction work, chatting excitedly, sharing stories… But Harry’s thoughts were interrupted when someone called their names.
Harry laughed lightly, he knew Draco was agreeing with him but had too much pride to admit that the famous Gryffindor was right on that one. He was starting to know him better than the blonde thought.
The mood at the Burrow is a bit warmer than when I left. I think Molly’s new way of coping is to feed us until we explode and take care of us like we were all terminally ill. Everyone is still distraught, of course, but healing. I hope you’re healing too.
Harry didn’t see Draco again that week, but they did communicate a bit through letters. They talked about mundane things, like what they were up to that week. Harry learned that Draco had been working on some potions lately in his flat, and had already received complaints from neighbours because of the foul odour that sometimes emitted from his cauldron. Harry told him that he was still working on the house, and by Friday afternoon he was almost done.
yes i cried writing the conversation between george and harry. hope you enjoyed<3 don't forget to leave a small comment if u want, it always makes me so happy to read feedbacks!!
The door opened, and Molly Weasley gave Harry such a warm and happy smile he could feel all of his troubles go away.
“Shut up. I never investigated you, I just… Checked up on your devious plans.” He replied, making Draco laugh as well.
The receptionist took their information, gave them their keys, and the men went to their room in an uncomfortable silence. This was awkward. Great start.
“Shut up, Malfoy, it’s just cigarettes. I’m not on drugs or some shit. Just a nasty habit I picked up while trying to save all of your asses.”
“Nice work today, right, Harry?” Said Ernie McMillan as he approached him, a proud smile on his face.
“Oh, that. Yeah, McGonagall mentioned it to me.” Harry shrugged. He didn’t really care, it’s not like he was counting on going back. Fixing the castle had been therapeutic, but he didn’t know if he was ready to go back to being a normal student just yet. It felt unrealistic to go to potions or charms class after all that had happened in the past year.
Lunch with Ginny was – surprisingly good, and not awkward at all. They talked as they always had, and everything was just so platonic. Harry didn’t know what to think about the situation, but he didn’t mind. He really loved Ginny, even though he didn’t know in which way, and she always made him feel better. Her presence soothed him.
The young man was waiting in front of the muggle coffee shop with a single rose in his hand, waiting for his handsome date. When he saw Harry apparate a few feet further, he beamed at waved at him. The chosen one waved back and quickly walked towards Draco.
He was about to apologize grumpily before recognizing a voice which belonged to none other than Ginny Weasley. Was she still his girlfriend? Harry didn’t know, probably not, but he was glad to see her.
The next day, Harry woke up at 9am. He had only managed to get a few hours of sleep, and he was exhausted, but his body just didn’t want to go back to sleep. So he went to the bathroom, took a shower, and looked at himself in the mirror – he looked like shit. His dark circles were worse than ever, his skin looked pale, he was getting skinnier, as if he wasn’t skinny enough already. He couldn’t believe the person staring back at him was, well, him. It felt as if someone else was in his mirror, a stranger who looked awfully familiar for some reason.
“We always go out.” Harry chuckled. “I don’t really like celebrating it anyway. Don’t worry about it. How do you even know when my birthday is?”
“Oh, Harry, I just couldn’t imagine letting you deal with this alone. And I missed you. Ron is going to join us in a bit later, getting up before 8am isn’t really his thing.”
“Why did you never mention it?” Draco sat down on Harry’s bed, making himself a bit too comfortable for his taste.
“No, it’s… We met accidentally one night, at a club, and we talked a lot after that.” Harry said, trying to keep as much detail as possible to himself. He didn’t want to tell them about the sort of vacation they’d had together. That was a story for later.
“Right.” Harry frowned a bit, staring at Draco’s face. That was something he seemed to be doing a lot these days. It was also something he did a lot in school, but back then it was because he always thought Draco was conducting an evil master plan.
“I should go back to the Ministry, I have a lot of work… But I had a really good time with you, Draco. And we could, if you want, go on another date sometime?”
“Wait, wait. Are you seriously jealous?” Draco asked, laughing. “Honestly, Scarhead, I’m wounded. I’d never hook up with Blaise, I don’t go for the straight men.”
So he stood there. He didn’t know how to cope with this. He couldn’t stop it – Hermione had told him countless times to visit a Mind Healer, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to do so. He couldn’t let anyone see his weaknesses. It was too hard.
“I don’t care about the stupid Prophet.” Harry interrupted him. “We were starting to become friends and it was fun going out together and I hate that we’re back to practically being strangers.”
He got up and went to the shower, scrubbing at his skin a bit less roughly than he usually did. His entire body was already very sensitive and bright red, rashes covering his chest due to scrubbing his skin with his fingernails on the really bad days under the burning hot water. He found that doing this was the only thing that made him feel some sort of control over his body, which had never been truly his before that night of May, not really.
“Inside with Lee and Oliver. I needed a break.” George answered, loosening his tie. Harry stared at his hand for a few seconds and looked away. Realizing he liked men also made him realize just the amount of blokes he had been attracted to at Hogwarts but had mistaken for friendship or admiration.
“I don’t really know yet. I think I’m going to take some time to figure things out. And I’m sure Professor McGonagall would let me come take my NEWTs as an external candidate or something. But I really don’t feel like being a student for a whole year again.”
Harry was running as fast as his legs could bear. He ran into the lobby, ignoring the confused-looking security guard, and ran up the stairs. All the man could think about was getting to the room before Draco had the chance to leave or worse. What if he hurt himself? Harry knew the man was very vulnerable, and this situation certainly wouldn’t help. He had seen it, he wasn’t stupid. He had seen the rashes around Draco’s dark mark when he thought Harry wasn’t looking, he had noticed the scars on his back, he had noticed how sometimes Draco wasn’t really there, how sometimes he would make self-decapitating jokes that were a bit too dark to be funny, how he had once said while drunk that Harry was the only thing keeping him alive as a joke, but it wasn’t really a joke, Harry knew that, and deep down Draco knew it too. And Harry had pretended not to remember. What an idiot.
Harry unrolled the small piece of parchment and sat down on his bed to read it, a cigarette tucked between his lips.
The young man was surprised by his own confidence, but he really wanted that kiss. He wanted to know that these weren't just words to make him feel better.
Harry nodded, and Draco could see all the sincerity and compassion in his eyes. He didn't usually like pity but it was Harry bloody Potter and he wanted everything from him.
Harry watched as his nemesis buried his face in his hands, he was trying to hide his vulnerability, but the raven haired boy could see right through him.
Ron’s ears turned a nice shade of tomato red, a sign that he was embarrassed, probably because he knew they were right and he was only making excuses to not dance.
“I may not know you well, but after being targeted by your daddy’s friends for years, I think I can recognize a murderer when I see one. And you’re not one. And I’m not asking you to stay with me, just… I want to have fun. And considering the state I found you in yesterday, I think you do too.”
“I might be gay but I still have pride! She could’ve gone with her to the ball and avoid me the embarrassment! Merlin, I seriously wanted to slap her.”
“Ugh, don’t get me started on that one.” Harry rolled his eyes as Draco mentioned Dumbledore and quickly downed his drink. These days, thinking about that man only made him want to break everything in his sight, but at that moment he was too wasted to get angry.
So he let the tears flow, let his feelings of sadness and guilt and fear overwhelm him. He let himself go for the first time in weeks, because sometimes holding it all in hurt even more. He felt so helpless in these moments, he couldn’t stop thinking about all the people he had lost, all the families that had been destroyed because he hadn’t been quick enough. If only he had managed to destroy the Horcruxes sooner, if he had surrendered to Voldemort as soon as the Battle had began…
We are pleased to inform you that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is hosting a ball in honour of its successful reconstruction on August 20
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered as the elevator stopped on the atrium floor. They stepped out and made their way to the apparition points.
Once they were done with dessert, McGonagall announced the Weird Sisters, and Ginny immediately dragged Luna to the dance-floor. Harry looked around the room as a lot of people were standing up to go dance and caught Draco’s eyes looking straight at him. He maintained the eye contact and Draco suddenly stood up, going out of the Great Hall.
“Harry’s right, you shouldn’t be rude to them. Slytherin or not, we all went through a lot of shit last year and we shouldn’t waste our time judging one another.” Ginny added.
“You’re right. We’ve all been through too much to continue these rivalries.” Fleur said, smiling. “Come on, Bill, let’s go to our seats.” She wrapped a perfectly manicured hand around her husband’s muscular arm and they went to sit at Percy and Penelope’s table. Charlie hadn’t been able to come, he was too busy with his dragons in Romania, and Harry suspected he’d rather spend time with them anyway.
And they went on like this for the entire night. Just drinking until all of the alcohol was gone, laughing until their stomachs hurt, and bickering over and over. It seemed so normal, the conversation flowing naturally, as if they had done this their entire lives. As if they were old friends. And of course the alcohol helped, but Harry felt comfortable with Malfoy. He knew it wouldn’t last, of course – once they went back to England, they were probably never going to speak again. But he was just so happy to be able to spend some time with someone who didn’t treat him either like a martyr or an idol. He finally felt like he had found someone who truly, deeply understood him.
“You’ve been in the loo for like 30 minutes, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, a stern look on her face that reminded Harry a bit too much of McGonagall. “We thought something happened to you.” She sniffed the air, her nose wrinkling. “Have you been smoking again? I thought you stopped!”
Malfoy was as broken as him, and Harry knew what this could lead to, and he hadn’t done anything, and now the boy was Merlin knows where, drunk, alone, confused, probably very pissed at himself, and had apparated while under the influence which was incredibly stupid and so dangerous, and Harry’s thoughts were all over the place, and he was starting to have a panic attack.
Ron knew very well that the two had broken up, but since he wasn’t always the most sensitive when it came to this type of stuff, he probably didn’t realize how uncomfortable his question could’ve seemed. Thankfully, since Harry and Ginny were still good friends, they didn’t mind. Harry laughed as Ginny reached over the table to punch her brother’s shoulder.
Harry held the covers close to his body, trying to calm down his erratic breathing. He was being completely taken over by anxiety, and he was used to it, but it didn’t make it any less hard. He just had to wait for the wave to pass.
As everyone stared, the pain and suffering they were all feeling, reminiscing was so intense it could almost be touched. The last time most of them had been here, the courtyards were destroyed, lifeless or injured bodies were lying on the ground, people were screaming, fighting, dying. They’d never felt such pain before and going back made them feel it again, made them all go back to that night of May.
sorry for the late update! i was having a bit of writer's block but i'm back now. thank you for reading and i hope you enjoyed!
Everyone was up already, but “everyone” wasn’t a lot. The few people who had decided to stay were McGonagall, Hagrid, Flitwick, Lisa Turpin – a seventh year Ravenclaw he had never talked to –, Anthony Goldstein, Ernie McMillan, and him. Some other people would come by to help during the day, mostly professionals sent by the Ministry and volunteers from all over the country, but they were the only ones permanently staying at Hogwarts. Either because they wanted to help, or because they didn’t have any family to go home to. The only times Harry had left the castle during the past few weeks was to go to funerals.
Harry smiled slightly and held the letter close to his heart. He missed his friends, he really did. Even though the way they babied him sometimes annoyed him, he knew it came from a place of deep love and care. After all they had been through together, after all the fights, the pain, but also the joy, the laughs… He knew nothing could ever come between them. Not even his own dark thoughts and terrible mood swings.
His nights consisted of night terrors, waking up in a cold sweat, insomnia, falling asleep again, and repeat. His days consisted of this sad, mourning face staring back at him in the mirror. Harry was staying at Hogwarts during the reconstruction. Professor McGonagall had told him to stay with the Weasleys, to take care of that later, to get some time off. But he didn’t want that. He didn’t want to stay with the family who mourned over their dead son, or brother, or twin. He needed to stay occupied. Or else he would go down in a spiral of self-hatred and guilt. So, everyday, he woke up, forced himself to eat something, and worked. He worked on restoring the castle, on giving it back its grandeur until he couldn’t feel his body anymore. Then, he would force himself to eat something again, and go back to sleep in the temporary dorm Professor McGonagall had set up on the grounds. It was sad. But it was all he could bring himself to do. He had to feel useful. Everyday, the few people who decided to stay at the castle to work on the restorations looked at him with admiration, and it only made him want to bury himself underground. What was there to admire? He didn’t save the world because he was brave. He saved the world because it was the thing he had been programmed to do since he had first gotten there when he was an 11-year-old child.
Blaise and Draco were chatting, Draco leaning against the wall of a shop on the other side of the street, Blaise in front of him, and Harry felt like they were definitely flirting. He cleared his throat and went to lean on the wall beside Draco.
“Am I part of them? To you?” Draco asked, his voice so low Harry wouldn’t have heard him if the room hadn’t been so quiet.
“I’m much more of a Slytherin than you think, Malfoy. The Sorting Hat wanted to put me there but I asked it not to because I’d heard all Slytherins were evil dark wizards.”
This didn’t mean he had compassion for Death Eaters – he hated every single one of them with a burning passion. But Draco was an exception. When Harry had had visions of what Voldemort had been seeing during the war, he’d seen Draco torturing people, and he didn’t think he could ever forget the look of sheer horror on the boy’s face. Because that’s what they both had been. Boys. Not men ready for war.
“About what? Because if you’re talking about what I think you’re talking about, I’m going back to sleep.”
“Gryffindors are stupid! They act all brave and shit but really it just shows their lack of survival instinct. And I’ve seen you in class and exams, Potter, you always had that dumb confused look on your face. It was sad, really.”
However, when Harry woke up on May 29th, he knew these weren’t going to be like the others. It was the Malfoys’ trials, he had no idea what to do about Lucius, who he knew had wanted to leave Voldemort’s side, and he wasn’t ready to face Draco.
Ginny and Luna were talking very closely, Ron was still talking with George, but Hermione was staring right back at him, her eyes full of questions. Harry just shook his head and gave her a look that clearly meant ‘I’ll tell you everything later’, so she just got back to her chat without insisting. A few other people around the bar were staring at them, but Harry just ignored them. He didn’t owe them an explanation.
The raven-haired boy nodded curtly at him before leaving, walking fast towards his dorm. He just wanted to lay down and take the time to mentally prepare himself for what was going to unfold over the next few days.
“Happy birthday.” Draco said as midnight came, smiling at Harry. Before the brunette could even realize what was happening, the blonde had two hands on his hips, and his lips on Harry’s. Whether it was because of the alcohol or something else, Harry kissed him back, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck. He was in a total daze, not thinking of anything except for the soft lips kissing him, the warm tongue against his mouth. He pressed his body against Malfoy’s, wanting the moment to last forever. He felt invincible.
But he didn’t say anything. He shut his mouth, just as he had for the past weeks. He bottled up his feelings, and ignored them. He didn’t have the right to complain. Not after all they had sacrificed to help him.
It felt good for Harry to finally have someone who understood his jokes, who knew that he didn’t actually think they were funny but used them to cope. Draco always made him feel the same thing, every time they saw each other; understanding.
His only comfort was hanging out with Moon. It probably seemed stupid, but he loved talking to the owl and telling her about his troubles. Harry truly felt like she understood him, just like Hedwig had. He remembered late nights at Hogwarts, especially in his last two years, where he would stay in the Owlery for hours just to talk to her. And she always listened. Or didn’t fly away, at least.
He looked at her and she smiled gently at him. He had daydreamed about seeing that smile and those beautiful eyes again for weeks, months when he was on the search for the horcruxes, but now he wasn’t sure how to feel about this. About them and what they used to be. About her.
Draco immediately nodded enthusiastically, he really wanted to go on another date with Harry. He liked him even more now.
Ginny put her hand on top of Luna’s, squeezing it. Harry didn’t really pay attention to the gesture, he knew how girls could be with their friends, they were most of the time much more touchy than boys.
When he finally went back to his room at the Leaky Cauldron, he collapsed on his bed and for the first time in months, his dreams were filled with grey eyes instead of red ones.
He looked around and calmed down slightly as he watched the decorations in the Great Hall, that had been transformed into a ballroom for the occasion. It had never looked so splendid, not even for the Yule Ball. There were chandeliers floating all around the room, giving it a beautiful gold lighting, and the ceiling was a velvety black colour, dotted with stars. The five tables had disappeared, leaving only round tables encircling a dance-floor. There were already a few people sitting and chatting, and Harry’s eyes caught sight of silky platinum blonde hair that he could’ve recognized among millions of others.
“Oh poor me, I don’t have the Chosen One’s pity, how can I live in peace now?” Draco laughed as well, and took a sip from his drink. “You know, your friends are going to be suspicious if they see you hanging out with me. They’ll think I’ve put a spell on you.” He added.
“Yeah, it’s… It’s nice. Really. It’s a good idea, I’m just not thrilled to go back there, but it’ll be fine.” Harry forced a smile, not wanting to seem like a buzzkill. Ron apparently didn’t have a problem with that.
Ginny grabbed Harry’s hand, holding on tightly as they moved towards the main entrance of the castle. Nobody was uttering a word in their small group, they didn’t need to. They knew what each other were thinking about.
“There’s this thing called books, Potter, you should open one once in a while. I mean, Hogsmeade is such an old village. The architecture has barely changed since it was founded centuries ago. It’s insane! Same for Hogwarts, it has looked the same since it was bloody built. I love it, don’t get me wrong, and I wouldn’t change it for the world. But wizarding homes… Everything is just so old.”
Draco took a seat on a barstool next to him, getting a cigarette from his pocket. Merlin bless the bars that let you smoke inside.
i'm so sorry for not updating in a month pls don't hate me. i'll try to update a bit more often but i think i'll just ask u to get used to the long wait between updates. :( i hope you liked it anyway!<3
“Don’t be a dick, Ron, they’re not all bad. Just because their parents are Death Eaters doesn’t mean they are too.” Harry said, frowning.
He pushed the glasses up his nose and sat up quickly, taking in his surroundings. Unfamiliar. Where the hell was he? He had been planning on coming back to the Burrow early in the morning as to not raise suspicions on his… Nightly activities and just pull an all-nighter. This wasn’t part of the plan. Was he in a hotel? In muggle London, again? How the hell had he checked in so late at night? Well, at least he was alone and not with a random stranger, but he really had to stop spending so much money on hotel rooms or else he would end up broke.
As he finally arrived in front of their hotel room, Harry opened the door as fast as possible, hoping to see Draco there, hoping he was overreacting, that they were going to pretend this never happened, that everything would be fine, that they could continue this weird friendship they had developed over the weeks.
“Every single girl is going to fight to get a dance with you anyway.” Ron responded and Harry snorted. He wasn’t wrong. Although dancing with a man wouldn’t bother him either… He really should tell his friends he also liked men one day. But it could wait. Just for now.
Draco laughed as well and settled the bottles on a chair he had transfigured into a small table. He also took out two frozen pizzas from the mini-fridge, heating them up with a quick spell before settling them on the table as well. Harry’s stomach growled when he saw the food, he hadn’t eaten all day, and had barely eaten the day before.
The Malfoy blushed deeply and felt himself melt under Harry's gaze. He was so beautiful and the blonde man definitely didn't deserve him. He opened the coffee shop's door and looked at Harry with a beam.
“I don’t know. I mean, I’ve thought about it many times over the summer, and everything would just be so different. I would’ve had such a different life, different friends. And I don’t know how things would’ve turned out.”
Draco nodded understandingly and they finally arrived to the ground floor, just a few feet away from the Great Hall. There were a few people there, but nobody seemed to notice them.
Harry laughed loudly, he liked how Malfoy made fun of his title of saviour. Almost everybody treated him as a hero, but the Slytherin laughed about it, and it might’ve seemed rude to others, but Harry knew it was just how Malfoy was. And it felt nice to not be put on a pedestal he didn’t deserve.
“Honestly, Potter, what was it like growing up with muggles? I mean, seriously, muggles! It must’ve been boring as fuck.”
He was greeted by Neville, Seamus, Dean, Anthony Goldstein, Ernie MacMillan, Lisa Turpin, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Terry Boot, Padma and Parvati Patil, Oliver Wood, Alicia Spinnet, Roger Davies, Cho Chang, and Susan Bones. There were a few other eighth years and over, but he’d never really talked to them, so they just nodded at him before going back to their business.
The young Malfoy awkwardly waved at him with a huge smile on his lips and quickly walked away from the man, feeling like a complete fool, but a happy one. He really liked Harry and was thrilled about the idea of going out with him. He couldn't wait to owl Pansy, his best friend about this, she was going to be so jealous.
“I spoke in his favour at his trial. And McGonagall wouldn’t have invited them if she thought they were dangerous.” Harry sighed. “We’ve been fighting for too long, guys.”
Just like people, the sun rises in the morning and sleeps at night. That’s how life goes. An endless circle, always doing the same thing, over and over. Everyday. Nothing changes. That’s how Harry Potter had been feeling for the three weeks. Three weeks since the war ended. Since he killed Voldemort. He always thought that everything would be alright after that – he was wrong.
“What do you think?” Harry asked, a bit nervous. He didn’t know what he wanted Draco’s answer to be.
“It was good. Really good, actually. Quite unexpected. I didn’t plan to travel, I originally just wanted to stay in muggle London, but… It just sort of happened.”
“Didn’t dissuade you from coming too, I see.” Harry responded. He sat as well, knocking back his shot of Firewhisky. If the others wanted theirs, they could come and get them.
“I’m full of surprises.” Harry chuckled, and they started walking again. Very slowly. Neither of them wanted to get back to the party because they knew they’d have to go on their separate ways. Harry didn’t care that others saw them interacting but he didn’t want Draco to have to face the repercussions. He had already been getting nasty looks, he didn’t want to make it worse for him.
In these moments, the man completely lost track of time. Nothing felt real. Had he been in the bathroom for 15 minutes or 3 hours? He wouldn’t have been able to tell.
“Of course I wanted to speak with you. I mean…” Harry took a drag of his cigarette, the smoke in his lungs and alcohol running through his veins giving him courage. “I thought we were starting to become friends.”
Barely a few minutes later, after they had talked about trivial things such as what Ron had eaten that morning, Harry went to the bathroom and splashed some water on his face. He looked at himself in the mirror and barely recognized the person staring back at him. He sighed and got dressed in simple but fancy robes that Mrs. Weasley had sent him for the trials.
I have also decided to go back to Hogwarts for my eighth year. Professor McGonagall came to the Burrow to talk to Ron and me about it personally, but I think she was mostly hoping to see you there. I told her you were on vacation. Which isn’t really a lie, right? She told us you weren’t planning on returning, but asked us to tell you that you would always be welcomed at Hogwarts, whether for studying or visiting.
The Great Hall had been the first place, along with the entrance, to be fixed. It looked almost brand new. The fake sky was a clear blue, with no clouds in sight, sunlight filtering into the room. It was beautiful. Clearly Professor McGonagall’s work.
“Honestly, Potter, you’re a wizard, you should start acting like one. This spell isn’t that hard. How you could even survive last year is beyond me.”
However, Harry’s increasingly good mood faded a bit when him, Ron and Hermione walked in the Great Hall to greet Bill and Fleur. His eyes landed on the exact place where he had killed Voldemort, and flashes of confronting the man who called himself the Dark Lord before having their final duel rushed back to him. His breathing sped up a little, and he tried to calm himself down, but Fleur seemed to notice because she squeezed his shoulder, giving him a reassuring smile.
“Are you going to insinuate that I’m secretly in love with you every single time we talk? It’s getting old, mate.” Harry said, sighing.
When everyone was finally seated around the Great Hall, Professor McGonagall made her entrance and went to the middle of the dance-floor for her speech.
“Your house-elf is back, friends.” He said as he lay the glasses on the table before taking back his seat.
“What was it like back there, at your school? I mean, I've seen students from Beauxbatons during the Triwizard Tournament and Ron's brother married a French women but I've never been there.
“Oh, uh, yeah, I’m sure. I want to move on from all of this. Taking my NEWTs just seems pointless, now.”
Harry had found a picture of Sirius and Regulus hidden away in the latter’s bedroom, though. They seemed to be around 13 years old, and were both wearing fancy evening robes. Sirius had a cheeky smile, his eyes gleaming with mischief. Regulus looked very solemn, clearly behaving with more decorum than his older brother, but Harry could still see the corners of his lips twitching as he was trying to repress a smile.
PS: I used Moon because she came at Hogwarts for some reason and I recognized her immediately. She’s very smart. Hope you don’t mind.”
And then Teddy’s round face and purple hair came into his mind, his godson, the only person who made him want to keep living. He hated the fact that he had only seen him once when he had visited Andromeda, but he needed to sort himself out before coming into that perfect baby’s life. He needed to live, to be stupid, but mostly he needed to find himself. And then he would be ready. He couldn’t let that child feel a single moment of sadness in his life, he wouldn’t allow it.
That day, and the next, went by in a blur. Harry testified, as did a few other people, and the newly appointed Wizenmagot didn’t even have to deliberate before sending the Carrows, Rookwood, Avery, Crabbe, Yaxley and Goyle in Azkaban for life. Every trial took around an hour or two but each of them felt like ten hours to Harry. He was exhausted, and seeing the faces of these terrible people who had hurt him and tried to kill him so many times made him want to jump off the astronomy tower. But it was alright. It was going to be over soon and everything would go back to normal.
starting at 8 o’clock. All of our students and important names of the British wizarding world are invited and are authorized to bring a plus-one. We would be glad to have you attend.
“Alright.” Draco’s eyes lingered on Harry for a few more seconds, and he then regained his composure, filling up their glasses with pure vodka with a simple flick of his wand.
“Do you ever regret it? Choosing Gryffindor over Slytherin.” Draco asked, startling Harry a bit. He had already asked himself that question, and he didn’t really know what the answer was.
Five days had gone by since Harry had come back to the Burrow. That was enough to remind him why he had decided to leave. Staying with the people he felt most guilty to have hurt triggered his panic attacks and night terrors like crazy. There wasn’t a single night where he didn’t wake up in a cold sweat at least twice, and it was now becoming a habit for him to have to go hide in the bathroom to have a panic attack in the middle of the day. Seeing so much grief in the eyes of those he had considered family for so many years absolutely broke his heart, and the worst part was he felt so, so guilty for Fred’s death. If he had just surrendered to Voldemort sooner…
“Fine.” George sighed, looking at the ground. “It just hurts coming back here, you know? Every bloody thing makes me think of him.”
“Wait.” Harry said, and when Draco turned to him, he presented his hand for the blonde to shake. The parallel was striking. “I offer an official truce and civil relationship. And maybe a blossoming friendship if you’ll have it.” He offered Draco one of his rare sincere smiles.
The rest of the night went by in a blur of conversations, dancing and laughter. At one point, Luna had dragged Harry to the dance-floor and forced him to dance with her and Ginny, which had actually been quite fun. He had talked to a lot of his former classmates, and with some younger students he didn’t really know. He had even chatted with Blaise Zabini for a few minutes, and the man was actually quite nice. He wasn’t the stuck-up jerk Harry had expected him to be.
“He was nice to me.” Luna responded, her eyes and voice always so dreamy. “When I was a prisoner at the Manor. It was very boring there. But he tried to come talk to me and give me more food as much as he could.”
“Don’t forget a stupid Gryffindor was better than you in potions in sixth year.” Harry retorted, smiling.
However, the mood was ruined when someone accidentally bumped into them, and as they were separated, something seemed to snap in Draco. His eyes became dark, he clenched his fists. He took a step back and stared at Harry like he’d seen a ghost.
But it wasn’t all pain. This place held some of their best memories too, like going outside after completing their exams, Harry and Ginny going on evening walks when they’d gotten together, going to the lake to play with the Giant Squid. And seeing it grow back to life after it had been destroyed by these Death Eaters was like meeting an old friend they hadn’t seen in a while. The atmosphere felt warm, and light. Like all the darkness that had clouded the air for two years had disappeared at the same time as the bodies, blood, and wreckage.
Harry put his bag down on the floor and threw himself on the first bed, spreading his limbs so as to be in a starfish position, his face mushed into the many pillows. Was this what being in Heaven felt like? He had a huge smile on his face. Even his bed at Hogwarts wasn’t that comfy.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, please let me know what you thought in the comments!! Don't worry, the angst is coming soon. This is just the calm before the storm.
